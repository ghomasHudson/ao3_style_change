“I didn’t realise it was today,” Steve says in a rush. “The anniversary, I mean. I’ve been so caught up in the idea of spending Christmas with you that I—”
“There’s some benefits,” Tony says, pushing himself up on Steve’s chest and locking eyes with him. “I’m a lot bendier like this, recover faster, and hey, no nasty scars either. Can’t really see the downside for you.”
“But I knew that I—I didn’t know you—” Steve gently puts the nightlight back in the box, trying to wrap his head around what this means. “You mean you—”
“Him,” Tony says, walking over to Steve, still cradling the baby in his arms. “Adam. Look, Steve, look how tiny his hands are.”
“Thank you,” Tony says, meeting Steve’s eyes reflected in the mirror on the wall. He wouldn’t swear to it, but Tony thinks he can see Steve’s ears turning red, and something settles in Tony’s chest upon seeing that.
“Yeah,” Steve says. He kisses Tony’s fingertips as they pass over his mouth. “I don’t know what to do.”
Steve catches Tony by the arm before he can vanish into the bathroom again and lifts him up, walking over to the bed with him before gently putting him down. “Stay,” Steve says, squeezing Tony’s shoulder. “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to—”
“Actually I’m sure there are several movies about him revealing his secrets,” Steve says, knocking their shoulders together. “This was nice of you, Tony.”
“Yes,” Tony says. “She knows. It depends on how she is, whether she remembers, but she was told. She gets told whenever she forgets. I make sure she does.”
The morning sunlight is slipping through the thin curtains, casting a golden glow over Steve’s skin, and Tony watches the rays play across Steve’s face as he reacts to what Tony’s doing to him. It’s quiet in the bedroom, the silence only broken by Steve’s low gasps and groans, and Tony would swear they’re goddamn best sounds he’s ever heard in his life.
“I’m not gonna—” Steve pauses, his finger sliding inside Tony. “God, you’re so—I’m just leaking out of you.”
And Steve does know, as he watches Tony’s face slip into a soft smile before tangling their fingers together and picking up his mug with his free hand, waiting for Steve to do the same. Steve knows because he
“You—” Steve cuts himself off and frowns. “Tony, you’ve been watching me jog down the beach every morning.”
“Well, now you just look adorably confused,” Tony says as he stands up, putting his phone away and picking up a bunch of flowers. “Hey,” he says, pushing up on his toes and kissing Steve softly. “She’s going to be happy to see you.”
“My son Tony Stark is cradling? Yes,” the woman says, glancing over at him. “Oh, I didn’t—it’s very nice to meet you Captain.”
Tony swallows around the lump in his throat as he looks at Steve, seeing the hopefulness in his expression, and the lines between his eyebrows giving away how nervous he is. There’s only ever going to be one answer Tony can give. “Yes,” he says, squeezing Steve’s hand. “Of course I do. I still love you, I’m still
“Yeah, yes, I—” Tony shakes his head and gets in the shower. “Just didn’t expect to end my day with a wet and naked you.”
Looking at the watch, Steve presses the sides and switches it on, hoping like all hell that it’s still going to be able to transmit to Tony, because he can tell they’re deep underground. There’s layers of concrete surrounding them as Pierce walks further into the building, and Steve finds himself cataloguing how to get out if this is an ambush. There’s no route out that he can see aside from where they came in, and he’d have to rely on his speed and healing if it came to it. Steve hopes it’s not an ambush, he doesn’t want to die like this. Not now.
“There’s a hotel over the street that does an amazing hot stone massage, give me five minutes and I’ll get you booked in.”
Steve leans against the wall of the elevator and closes his eyes. “Thank you,” he says, feeling Tony squeeze his hand. “I don’t—”
Tony hums, his fingers stroking along Steve’s shoulders. “I’ll ask some people,” he says. “We’ll figure it out. SI already has specific scholarship funds targeted to immigrant kids, but—”
Steve takes a hard look at Tony and sees how tired he is. He walks around the desk and tentatively rests his hand on Tony’s shoulder. “Did you get any sleep last night?”
“It’s fine,” Tony says. “And as for the one night thing, it’s not like I’ve been sleeping around with this in my chest.”
“You’re grieving,” Steve says. “After Bucky died I sat in a bombed out bar and drained whatever was left and found out I couldn’t get drunk. If I’d been able to, then—” Steve pauses, his fingers tracing a pattern along Tony’s leg over the blankets. “I don’t know what would’ve happened.”
“I’ve been called worse,” Steve says, taken aback when Tony laughs. It lights up his entire face, making the stress he carries melt away, and Steve’s struck by the urge to make it happen again. “It—the note said what my mom would make me for my birthday,” he says, once Tony’s laughter dies down. “No one else would know that, no one alive, anyway. So I took a chance on believing him. Myself.”
“Yeah,” Tony says softly, tilting his hips a little. “This body definitely hasn’t done this before.”
Tony’s hands are gripping the sheets, sweat running down his spine as he waits for the next hit. It’s the anticipation that gets him every time, listening to Steve’s movements, wondering if he’s done with his hand or if he’s going to pick up the paddle.
,” Tony cries out at the quick succession of blows from Steve’s hand, lighting his ass up as his legs start to shake. “More.”
Clint raises his mug and shrugs. “I feel betrayed, sure, but not by you. Kinda pissed SHIELD have apparently been setting me up to get killed.”
.” Tony pauses, trying to gather his thoughts, when something occurs to him. Narrowing his eyes, he looks up at Steve. “You want it,” he says. “You’re worried about me, sure, but you never—” Tony glances down at Steve’s crotch and raises an eyebrow before looking up and meeting Steve’s eyes again. “If you wanted to get off, all you had to do was ask.”
“You okay?” Steve asks, his hands resting against the small of Tony’s back. “We can go back in if you—”
“Okay,” Tony says with a smile. “You can’t cook and I don’t want to. There’s stuff for sandwiches in the fridge, though, and there’s some bread I got from that lady down the street.”
Tony smiles against the sheets, his knees wobbly and only just holding him up, but then—. Then he hears the swoosh in the air of the paddle before it comes down on his ass with an audible smack, and he howls like a goddamn demon, his knees finally giving out.
“If you’re trying to talk me into wearing them, you’ve won,” Tony says against Steve’s neck, unconsciously pushing up into Steve’s touch. “Jesus Christ, Steve.”
“Guess I’ll put myself in your hands,” Tony says, a shiver running down his spine as Steve’s fingers trace the length of his side down to his waistband.
Steve rolls off the bed and ducks into the bathroom, grabbing a washcloth and dampening it under the faucet. When he comes out, Tony hasn’t moved from the bed and Steve just stares at him until Tony notices.
“Mmmf,” Tony says as he walks over and drops onto the couch, tipping his head back and closing his eyes. “Sometimes I really hate being me,” he says. “Not often, but sometimes.”
“I—” Steve swallows, taking in the sight of Tony, blood instantly going to his cock as he looks him up and down. “You look—wow.”
“No you’re not,” Tony interrupts. “You’re not intruding, you—” Tony makes a frustrated noise as he reaches out to grab onto Steve’s forearm. “Steve, you’re the only thing in my life that makes sense. If it weren’t for you, I’d be locked in the lab churning out weapons while Obie sold them to terrorists.”
“Gorgeous,” Steve interrupts, snatching the photo out of Tony’s hand. “Tony, do I think you looked hot like this? Yeah, I’m not going to deny it. But that’s because it’s
“That I do, Captain. Now let’s feed our spiderling before he passes back out.” Tony steps up behind Peter and leads him to the table to sit.
Tony reaches up and thumbs Peter’s nipples, rolling and pinching them. “Baby, God, you and Steve are going to kill me. This is… it’s everything. I’m not even going to be sore tomorrow because I’m going to die a happy man tonight.”
Steve shuffles them a bit so Peter’s head is resting on his shoulder and he has his arm around his waist, holding him gently before asking, “Can you tell me what happened? I promise I won’t be mad at you. Nothing you could say would make me think less of you, you’re the sweetest fella I’ve ever met, so could you tell me please?”
Just as Peter’s hands start to travel up Tony’s back, Tony steps away, and leans against Steve. “Goodnight, Peter,” Tony says with a smirk.
“Devious little boy, Baby. Going to stay plugged full of my cum and present it to Stevie tonight? What I wouldn’t give to watch
tonight. He grabs a tube of lube from his bag and lifts his leg onto the chair, wincing a little as he pulls out the plug. He relubes the plug and generously applies more to his hole before inserting it again. After a quick stop to the en-suite to wash his hands, he climbs on the bed. Arranging himself on knees spread wide, with his shoulders down and head on the pillow, his ass is directly facing the door. He takes that last minute of his mental countdown to take some slow relaxing breaths. Just thinking about Steve seeing him was making him too excited.
Peter stares at him for a solid minute before breaking out in laughter. Tony, trying not to smile, pulled off his hat with a faux glare and stalked toward Peter.
“I keep telling you that you should sit in a real chair. One of these days the friendly neighborhood Spider-Man is going to be walking around looking like the geriatric Spider-Man if you keep hunching over your laptop like that,” Steve calls from across the room, eyes still drawn to Peter’s abdominals.
Slowly pulling out, Steve lowers Peter’s legs off his shoulder, causing him to tip onto his side, allowing Steve to spoon up behind him.
The middle of December comes faster than Peter was expecting. Between his classes, the extra time in the lab for his Fellowship program and trying to come up with the perfect gift for May, Peter’s exhausted as he comes home from his last final. He’s thankful that Spider-Man has taken a small break too these last few weeks, or he would have flown past exhausted and right into
both of their heartbeats racing along with his own. He can smell Tony’s expensive aftershave and the charcoal smudges on Steve’s shirt. He’s so hard against Steve’s leg but tries not to rub on him.
Peter rubs his face with his sleeve and takes a few hitching breaths before answering, “I’m sorry Steve, I must have led Tony on. I must have encouraged him in some way, I tried not to, but I wanted, I did say yes when he asked. I’m sorry for doing that to you Steve.” Peter turned his face into Steve’s shoulder more to hide and felt, rather than heard, Steve take a deep breath before slowly letting it out.
Tony begins pulling at Peter’s sleeve and reaches to grab his sweater on the hook by the door as they pass.
Tony smiles before answering. “I don’t want to interrupt your plans for tonight Pete. Text me when you’re headed home?”
“I’m gonna come, Baby. I’m gonna come and fuck it right into you and keep going until I come again. Tony can only take two before he’s stuffed. We’ll have to test later how many you can take. You know how Tony likes his experiments.” Steve huffs out a stilted laugh.
Peter flops over to the side and stretches his arms over his head, reaching for the armrest on Tony and Steve’s perfect couch. He sees Steve’s eyes wander away from his canvas, set up in the evening light, toward Peter’s exposed stomach where his shirt rides up. Peter had been finishing a paper for school with his laptop, on the couch, for the last hour as Steve captured the reds and golds of the skyline in oil pastels, but now that it was finished and submitted, he could lay down for a bit, rest and stretch his body out.
Steve kisses Tony first and then dips to kiss Peter again before commenting, “How about a date first? Let us treat you right Baby?”
Peter can see Tony look to him for guidance on how to tell Steve. He nods to Tony before ducking his head back into the blanket pile. Tony places his hand onto where Peter’s shoulder could be, and announces. “Peter’s Spider-Man.”
Tony, so I should have made sure to talk with you about it too. It’s ok that you like Tony, Peter. I’m also ok with Tony liking you.”
“Do you want this Peter? Do you want me?” Tony asks with a low growl that sends sparks up Peter’s spine.
“Thanks FRIDAY!” Peter says as he addresses the camera in the corner, before turning to Tony, “Level 17?”
“We’d both love that,” Steve says before Tony cuts in, “Because we love you, Peter. We want you with us every day. In our lives, in our home, in our bed and with us in the field.”
When they arrive at Peter’s door, Steve approaches first. Reaching with one hand, he tips Peter’s head up and steps in close. They share air for a long moment before Steve gently kisses him. Touching their foreheads together, he murmurs, “Thank you for the wonderful date.” Steve kisses him chastely one more time before stepping back.
Peter grabs bowls and the box of Honey Puffs, Tony grabs the spoons and the milk and they meet at the table. After making their bowls, Peter finally asks, “How did you find it, anyway?”
“But then- why are you guys still living here in this tiny apartment if you have an amazing tower and penthouse there?”
. He wishes Tony would have warned him, but is secretly glad that he hadn’t. Learning this about Steve was part of the reason he was there, after all.
With his final kind word, Steve pulls all the way out to watch Peter’s hole try to clench around nothing, before pushing all the way back. Steve did this again, and once more before Peter complained, “Sir! Please!”
“Tony, you can science him all you want later. Important stuff first,” Steve announces. “How much do you need to eat a day to keep up with Spider-Man stuff? Have you measured your metabolism?”
Peter leans back into Tony’s space, almost touching noses and quietly whispers thank you before kissing Tony gently. Peter lingers for just a moment, before bouncing back to his spot on the couch, inspecting the large handful he is now holding.
“And I keep telling you that it doesn't work that way, I’m super flexible and I don’t even stay sore for long,” Peter retorts, aimlessly scratching his stomach, occasionally reaching up his chest, just enough to raise his shirt a little more. Peter hears the pastel drop onto the tray and the stool abruptly skitter across the floor, and smiles without opening his eyes. Peter also hears the elevator door ding open, but he doesn't want to distract Steve from giving
Peter lifts his hands up to his face to stare at them before twisting and looking at the rest of his body enclosed in the most amazing Spider-Man suit he has ever seen. Trying to calm his racing heart, he looks up at Tony and asks in a stilted tone, “How do I take it off?”
As Steve talked, he led Peter to the small table that contained their lunch. Sitting Peter on a tall stool, he handed him a box and chopsticks just in time for Peter to launch into the details of his web fluid
Tony laughs, shocked at the deadpan delivery and the impish smirk that Peter wore while he said it. “He’s perfect, Steve. Can we keep him?”
“There’s been some mixed signals, but as far as I can see, you want this. You want this as much as I do.” Tony says as he grips Peter’s hips with both hands now.
“Don’t worry, Tony. I’ve got him. I’ll give him what he needs.” Steve answers as he flexes up into Peter’s warm wet mouth. It only takes a few more minutes of him using Peter to make Steve cum. The only warning Peter gets is a low growl and the tightening of Steve’s muscular legs before his mouth is full. Peter swallows most of it, but not his last gush. Peter scrambles up into Tony’s lap and presses his prize into Tony’s surprised mouth, kissing him wildly so some of Steve’s cum drips down Tony’s face. When Peter leans back, he smiles at the mess he made of Tony’s perfectly trimmed beard. Steve groans and leans over to lick at Tony’s cheek before kissing him as well.
"Science is art." Tony informs him primly. "Science is everything. Beside, Petey loves science. Don't you?"
"He has enhanced reflexes and we assume healing- we haven't needed to test that out, thank god. Bruce checks up on him every month. Other than that, he's just- he's a boy."
Steve shakes his head and turns to watch Peter play on the balcony. "You should have told me, Tony." His voice is thick with grief over lost years.
"Yeah." He turns to look out the window, where JARVIS is projecting holographic butterflies and Peter is running around like the bundle of energy he is; jumping and swiping at them, confused when they don't land in his hand. Tony thinks maybe that scientist added some cat DNA in there too. He's downplaying everything, of course. All of this is...too heavy. They'd buckle under the weight of it. There was a time, a simpler time, where Tony and Steve had talked about adopting, so this- this in some cruel twist of fate is a dream come true. There was a time where the look of awe and pain on Steve's face wouldn't exist and this penthouse at the top of Stark Tower wouldn't just be for two. He can't handle Steve's look of 'on the brink of tears' because it makes him feel bad and he shouldn't have to feel bad. He's been a fucking spectacular father for the past four years. "Took you longer than I thought it would."
That's enough for Peter, and damn if that doesn't make Tony feel good. Peter comes full out sprinting inside, the balcony door shuts behind him and his little red face bounds up to the kitchen and into Tony's arms. Tony leans down and scoops him up, settling Peter on his hip as the boy taps the arc core like always. "Hey bud," he grins, kissing his temple as Peter snuffles into the crook of his neck. "Ya hungry?"
That's true. Tony ruffles Peter's hair and the boy grins; mouthful and strawberry lips. It's a charming sight. "Anything he ever wants." He agrees. "And more."
On the walk back (because no, Tony doesn't take the car everywhere. Happy needs a day off sometimes) Steve clears his throat. Peter's engrossed in tapping Tony's arc reactor, so is unaware to Steve's question. "Do you think maybe...I could spend the day with him? You could come too, like I was today, I want to..." he clears his throat and tries to be more concise, a solider through and through. "I want the chance to get more familiar with him. I love him more than anything and I've never even had the chance to be alone with him."
Steve frowns, glancing between the paper and his son. Peter looks a little paler now, and he steps forward; guilt written into every inch of him. Steve begins to worry. "Dad, please," he begins, "let me explain-" he reaches forward, like he can actually grab the paper and make this whole thing go away.
There's a sharp knock to the door of the penthouse and Tony pinches the bridge of his nose. Of course. Of course, even after presumably knocking out all of his security (and he's going to need to hire some better people) Steve still finds it impolite to just barge in and has the outright audacity to knock. Peter turns around in startled surprise at the sound, he was so engrossed in his playing, and Tony strokes him thumb over his cheek. "Let him in, Jarvis."
Peter wriggles out of his grip and does a little backflip off the couch that has Steve reeling but no one else is all too surprised. He races across the floor and jumps into Nat's waiting arms. She kisses him and leaves a bright red mark of lipstick just by his eye. She brushes the hair out of his face and examines him critically. "Took you about three seconds too long to get out of your dad's grip there, partner."
Steve looks outraged and he steps up onto the raised platform on the kitchen. "Tony," he growls, "if you'd swallowed your pride and called me I would have come back-"
sound mind he knew we were the best so he took some of your DNA, took some of mine, mixed them together and..." he tipped his head towards the balcony. "Along came Petey, so they say." Scratch what he said before- that explanation is the understatement of the century.
"Very impressive," Tony grins, kissing Peter's nose as the boy throws his arms around him and kisses Tony's nose right back. "Are you hungry?"
The brunet sighs exasperatedly. "Why would only Harry and Peter come out? They're not exactly having a smoke break. Why leave...those other ones inside?"
He wants to confront it and yell, but he also wants to do what Steve has asked. It's not like him, he knows, because the second anyone wants anything from him there's nothing he'd rather do less. Aside from Peter, of course. Tony would give him anything and everything. But this request has been so reasonable and earnest that even the great Tony Stark had a hard time saying no. All Steve wants is to watch Tony with Peter for a whole day. Just pick up on the whole parenting thing. Just...see their interactions.
"You spoil him," Steve says, not a judgement but a realisation. Tony shoots him a glare anyway as Peter cluelessly sips on his third strawberry milkshake. "No, it's not a criticism," he adds, even though Tony knows that. "I just-" he smiles a little, and it lightens up his whole face and Tony has to look away before he does something stupid like ask him to come over here so he can kiss him. "It's good. You always wanted something to do with all your money and now..."
He has the satisfaction of watching surprise flit across Steve's face. His perfectly symmetrical, American patriotic face. "You'd..." surprise turns to hesitancy, "how would..."
Soon, Peter's sitting on the couch eating a plate of carrot sticks and he has his head cocked and he's staring at Steve curiously. Steve shifts a little and rubs the back of his neck. "He gets that from you." He says nervously and Tony half smiles because that's true.
it's been five years. That's half a decade- half a decade of silence, of trying to 'find himself' or whatever else stupid thing the Captain's been doing for all this time and Tony is...Tony can't...
He beams, looking very proud of himself because that's the magic word. Tony knew this was coming, which is why he stops outside the little cafe with perfect timing. He really is excellent. The singular waitress nods, trying not to look star-struck as she ushers them in. She makes a swooning sigh at what is presumably Steve behind them, but she knows better than to comment.
It's a reasonable question. "He metabolises fast." Tony murmurs, eyes stuck on his son and voice low. "Really fast. He has to eat a lot, right buddy?"
because the latter is a little to Tony-Howard and he shudders to think about it. "Would you like me to introduce you?"
Tony glares at his perfect profile. "You shouldn't have left." He spits, just as self-righteously. He's so
"Everyone is." Tony says again, and he does mean for his words to cut because he does want Steve to hurt. Just a bit. Hurt like Tony hurt all that time in the wake of Steve's disappearance. "Thor, Strange, Wanda, Rhodey, hell, even Loki. We all banded together. For Petey."
He watches as his husband hovers awkwardly by the counter. Peter stiffens but doesn't look up from where he's prodding at something metal.
"Dad, dad, no," Peter insists, so sincere that Tony relaxes minutely. "Okay, it's like this. You...you and Pop are amazing. You've given me everything I've ever wanted, but that makes me feel like sometimes-" he looks up at the ceiling and Steve watches intently. "Sometimes it's like I haven't
Steve looks shellshocked and for a brief, ludicrous second, Tony thinks that this is what's going to scare him. That having a child is okay, but having a child with abilities will be too much. But of course, that isn't the case. "Natasha and Banner are...they're a part of his..."
JARVIS doesn't reply. Tony assumes his AI is doing his job, so he futilely attempts to relax and turns back to playing with his son. Peter is happily sticking the pieces of lego together and babbling all sorts of nonsense that Tony just nods and hums to. He's still in his pyjamas and his light brown hair is up in tufts that seem to defy all gravity as he brandishes his new ship like a sword. "Look, daddy!" Peter yelps, despite the fact that Tony is lying on his side right in front of him on the floor and not across the penthouse like his screaming would suggest. "Look!" He shoves the ship in Tony's face and makes all sorts of noises that Tony's never heard a ship make. "I made boat. It's a very fast boat and-and it can go underwater."
Turns out the boy has been patient and good. He gets off the couch and walks over to Steve slowly, and places his tiny hands on his knees. Steve stares down at him like Peter hung the moon in the sky and Tony knows the feeling- the whole world is shifting, everything that matters is changing and the most important thing in the world- is now this little boy. "Peter," Steve whispers; wretched.
Steve's never heard Tony like this, and though he's beginning to comprehend what exactly is happening, he's not sure it warrants this level of response. "Dad," Peter tries again, voice teary. It breaks Steve's heart. "It isn't like that, I swear. I just- Harry thought it might be a good idea-"
When Peter's halfway through his pancakes, chocolate smeared around his mouth and munching away happily, little legs kicking under the table, Tony gets him a milkshake and wipes his face with a handkerchief. He eats his own bagel in a slightly more civilised way, but he commends Peter's enthusiasm. Besides, it makes him feel good in a very primal way to see his son eating; getting nourishment and looking so content. He's a good provider.
Tony understands the appeal. He also knows that Steve prefers to learn by watching, while Tony likes to learn by doing. It might be nice if someday...if someday Peter can be influenced by both of their methods. So, he ignores the shadow as best he can and briefly admires the way that Steve can blend into the background of anywhere. Be almost invisible despite his broad shoulders and irritatingly perfect hair. He's only been back in the Tower for two days, but he seems relatively settled in the guest bedroom.
Steve smiles blindingly, and it's so much like Peter's smile that it hurts. His son is Steve's son too. He knows that, of course. But does he have to be reminded of it? "Thanks, Tony."
Steve frowns and cocks his head, tapping the book thoughtfully before he sets it down and pads dutifully over. "I haven't got to that bit yet." He looks over Tony's shoulder and peers at the black and white footage. Harry and Peter have emerged from the library, and are talking to each other. He arches an eyebrow as Tony replays it, wondering what it is he's missing. "Uh...you may have to help an old man out?"
Steve wakes up slowly, drifting back into the land of the living with the Cold War book across his chest. He blinks awake and takes in his surroundings. He's conked out on the couch in the living room, and he can see Peter hunched over the kitchen table, an old computery-thing splayed out in front of him and tools in hand. It's late afternoon and he knows now why he's woken up. Tony's footsteps. He closes his eyes and pretends to still be sleeping, opening them only when he hears Tony step foot in the kitchen.
"Auntie?" Steve whispers to himself, and Tony feels another pang of guilt that he instantly swats like a fly. Steve is staring at Natasha like he can't quite believe it, and Tony's not surprised. If you haven't been around the past four years to see this develop, it's going to look weird to see an assassin suddenly become a caring, maternal role model.
"Hey, Tony, why are all your security guards passed out?" Natasha asks, reeling to a stop at the sight of Steve. Tony buries his head in his hands as Steve stands up, nodding his head slightly. "Okay. I didn't realise, that-" she gestures to the hallway, "-makes sense now. Okay." She looks at Tony, who meets her eye as she gives him a supportive glance. "It's good to see you again, Captain." Is all she says to Steve, even though she knows how hard this has been for Tony. She can be magnanimous like that sometimes. Especially when Peter is involved. "Hey, mini-monster." She greets as soon as Peter sticks his head out from behind the large figure of Steve.
"That's all you though." He points out, proud of the way Steve relaxes and reaches out for a piece of the crunchy, orange vegetable.
"Oh, yeah, I'm sure you would have," Tony quips unsarcastically. "You'd have come back right after your huge speech about leaving, with a chip on your shoulder the size of the Hudson. You'd be a perfect parental figure: resentment personified." The thought is completely ridiculous. Steve had been adamant that he needed time. That he needed to be on his own for a while. "I wasn't going to give you a reason to come back when you'd made it so clear you didn't want to-"
"I knew it." Tony swears, shaking his head in disgust. "I knew we should not have let you be friends with that Osborn kid. I mean, this entire thing has been set up. Manipulated. And now you're going against family,
"Daddy, daddy, daddy, daddy," Peter giggles, from his perch on Tony's hips as they walk down the sidewalk on Saturday morning with their patriotic shadow. A number of people are looking and a few are trying to take pictures but nobody's running up to them so Tony counts it as a win. There's no such thing as privacy, after all.
Tony waves him away. "Privacy doesn't exist anymore, Captain Icicle. It died so the internet could live. Petey knows that. C'mhere, tell me what you think of this building." He turns around and rolls his eyes at Steve's book. "Put that nonsense away, I can summarise: Russia bad, America bad, Russia tries to be good, America...I'm pretty sure Gorbachev meets Ronald McDonald."
He tilts his head helplessly. "Is this a bad thing?" He queries, because it sounds like a good thing, but from the look of betrayal he gets from Tony, he can assume it is. "Well, uh, Peter, you shouldn't have...won an internship?" The condemnation tapers into a question.
"Auntie!" Peter squeals, setting the plate down and making to get up but Tony steadies him with a firm hand.
Tony sighs, and sets down his empty coffee cup and rubs the back of his neck. He's fidgety, nervous and awkward the way he only ever is when something has cut deep. "Why don't you...explain. Everything." He suggests, taking a seat. Peter looks up at him warily; doubtfully but Tony just gestures a little impatiently with his hands. "Come on, Pete. You don't hide stuff like this from me. From us. Just...tell me. What is it? You don't..." his voice becomes a touch softer and Steve's heart breaks hearing it, "...you don't want to stick with SI? Do you think I should be turning the board towards more to Bio-Tech? I don't- do you not want to become CEO someday-"
"Four years." He reminds, "he's saved the earth, he's saved other planets, he's risked his life. He's changed, Mr American Flag. In the way that some people do. And in the way that other people don't." He isn't sure quite what he means, but it has an impact which is all he cares about. Steve looks...he looks tortured. Tony feels guilt well up inside him again. Jesus, what is with that? "Okay, enough of this. Peter," he clears his throat and Peter stops trying to make a tower out of carrot sticks. "We need to talk to you."
Steve laughs, and it's a warm, lovely sound. Even Peter seems enthralled with it and he turns to look over at the man, before Tony snaps his attention back to the pancakes because
Possessive envy and paranoia fill Tony's body but he tries his best to let it go. "You can." He says haltingly, "but I'll have some of my guys tailing you. Not me because..." I don't think I can bare to see the man I used to love bond with the thing I love more than anything? Nope. Because I'm a jealous bastard? Not quite. "I'm busy." Nailed it.
"I'm gonna need you to go ahead and get security to not let him up here." He says, trying to keep his voice light, "tell him I'll reschedule and call him as soon as I can."
Steve looks...the same. Just the same. Either he isn't ageing, or being in the woods for years on end is very good for you. Steve looks like the same, blue-eyed wonder that Tony met and loved all those years ago. He's decked out in a white tee and a green jacket and his hair is the same perfect blond as before. He does look more...settled. Well rested. Better than he did the last time Tony saw him. Steve steps in, scans the room and then locks onto Tony- and there's so much on his face, so much in his eyes- before they lock onto Peter.
Steve rolls his eyes and teases his husband and says that it's perfectly natural if their teenager is hiding something. That's what teenagers do, after all. And there really is no need for Tony to send drones after their son at all hours of the day. It doesn't stop Tony from doing it anyway, of course. Very rarely can Steve stop Tony from doing something he wants to do. So, instead, he merely watches as Tony pours over the security footage from the drone and sees...absolutely nothing of any interest. Peter is a good kid, and he sticks to his schedule and he hangs out with Harry, Ned and MJ and they're all very happy together.
"Is it not...a breach of his privacy, watching him like that?" Steve had asked one day, looking up from his Cold War History book. He squinted over at his husband as he scoured over the footage and clicked dubiously to enhance a building that Steve was fairly certain was just a normal library.
“Good to know,” Steve says, resting his hand at the base of Tony’s spine, his fingers lightly stroking the strip of skin exposed above Tony’s waistband. “Morning.”
The rest of the team files out when the meeting comes to an end, leaving him with Steve, and Tony just wants to sink to his knees and let Steve take care of him. He won’t, not in public with the glass walls all around them, but he’s itching to. Wants to rest his head on Steve’s thigh and let him do what he wants. Rubbing his hands against his own thighs, Tony can feel Steve’s gaze on him and he looks up, raising an eyebrow.
“People have done stupider things,” Tony says, finally looking up and meeting Steve’s eyes. “It’s been a long time.”
Steve lifts Tony up to carry him over to the bed, not wanting to let go, and places him on the bed gently. Leaning over him for a moment, Steve brushes their noses together before he smiles at Tony. “Stay,” Steve says as he steps back from the bed. He strips out of the uniform as quickly as he can, his gaze concentrated on the way Tony’s all spread out on the bed for him like the best goddamn gift he’s ever been given.
“I do,” Tony says, taking them when Steve holds them out. “Thank you. I’m sure I have something that can work as a vase somewhere around here.”
“I wish I’d met her,” Steve says softly, his hand resting on Tony’s hip. “You could, if you want, tell me about her? Later?”
After being made to leave his phone, and the initial scan of his body, Steve’s lead into a lobby style room where he ignores the couch and instead stands, arms folded across his chest as he waits. It doesn’t take long before Pierce walks in, and Steve wonders if he should’ve switched the watch on before Pierce came in.
“Of course,” Steve says. The doors close, and Steve doesn’t move from his spot in the elevator until it reaches the floor he came in on. Stepping out, he collects his things from security and isn’t surprised when he has an escort following him to the boundary of the property. They see him off with a salute, and Steve sticks his hands in his coat pockets before heading towards the nearest subway station.
“You were adorable,” Peggy says, glancing at Tony before looking back at Steve. “He really was, Steve. Mop of messy hair with big brown eyes, getting into trouble as soon as he could walk.”
“It’s fine,” Tony yells through the door. “I know what it did and I’m just going to stay in here until it goes away.”
“You’re so relaxed already,” Steve says, his thumb sliding over Tony’s hole. “Don’t even need my fingers.”
The last person he had this with was Pepper, and Tony doesn’t know how to feel about that considering how it ended.
“Not just that,” Steve says, pressing a swift kiss against Tony’s lips. “Your ass is high on the list as well.”
Tony unwraps it carefully, like he’s worried it’s going to vanish from his hands, and Steve’s so nervous he wants to rip the paper off himself to get the waiting over with. Instead he watches Tony’s face as the gift is revealed to him.
“Hey, no, he was your friend,” Tony says, reaching over and covering Steve’s hand with his own. “You don’t have to feel guilty about that.”
Steve notices Natasha and Clint approaching and he holds up a hand to stop them. “Quinjet,” he says. “We’re going home.”
“Promise,” Steve says as Tony walks away. Steve can hear the low rumblings of the two of them talking, and if he concentrated he’d be able to listen in, but that seems unfair to them both so he doesn’t. Instead he looks around for distractions, taking in the well maintained building, the nurses walking through the halls looking busy but not rushed, and the laughter coming from another room.
“Sleep, Steve,” Tony says, reaching out and tugging on a strand of Steve’s hair that’s flopping in front of his face. “I’ll still be here in the morning.”
Tony nods before he slowly looks Steve up and down, noticing the subtle bulge in his sweatpants, and he tries to keep the wicked grin he’s feeling from creeping over his face. “Okay,” he says, noticing that the flush on Steve’s face has gotten darker. “I’d like that.”
“What if I’m just doing this because I miss my life before the ice? If he is what we think he is then he’s not even the same person I knew, what if—what if he can’t be made whole when we find him?”
He’s still feeling a chill after he’s dried off and he pulls on the cosiest sweatpants he owns, along with some thick socks, before he notices the sweater on his bed that wasn’t there before he got in the shower.
Tony groans at the feel of Steve’s hand on his cock, and he’s about to say something when Steve’s mouth is suddenly on him, pressing an open mouthed kiss against the base of his cock. His hand tightens in Steve’s hair involuntarily, and when Steve looks up at him, he nods. “Please,” he says in a hoarse voice, and the sweet smile that Steve offers him goes straight to his heart.
Taken aback by the seriousness in Tony’s face, Steve nods. “I know, Tony,” he says firmly. “I know.”
“Maybe you should’ve been more direct,” Tony says as Steve’s hand cups his face, thumb rubbing against the stubborn grease stain on his cheek.
“I’m trying,” Tony says with a sigh. “We’ll see if she rebels when she’s a teenager. But enough about my spawn, why aren’t you getting out of bed for a run?”
Steve laughs, taking Tony’s mug from his hands and putting it down. “We’ll see,” he says, leaning in and placing a quick kiss against the corner of Tony’s mouth. “We’ll see.”
The next three hits come quickly, one after the other, and Tony’s throat is sore from screaming, his cock is so fucking heavy between his legs. There’s tears running down his face, and Tony knows his bottom lip must be as red as his ass with the way he’s biting it. He’s completely overwhelmed by everything, his mind so at peace it’s making him wish he could stay in this haze forever.
Despite Tony’s proclamation, it takes another twenty minutes for Steve to coax him out of bed, and another fifteen on top of that before they make it to the kitchen where, thanks to FRIDAY, the coffee is already brewing.
“You’re going to owe us an explanation,” Natasha says over the comms, her voice still hoarse. “You know that, right?”
“Shit,” Steve bites out, and he barely has time to move before Bucky’s throwing it back at him. Grabbing it out of the air, Steve runs full force at him, and can see Tony aiming repulsor blasts at Bucky from a distance. “Iron Man, stay on him,” he says, voice as firm as he can make it.
Steve laughs softly, watching the lights from the tree play over Tony’s face, making his eyes seem even warmer than they usually are. He’s not an idiot, he’s lived with this low level attraction to Tony for years, but ever since Tony came back to the team it’s grown. After Ultron, Steve missed Tony without even realising it. He’d come visit, bringing new tech and uniforms, and stealing off Steve’s plate when they all ate, but it wasn’t the same.
Tony shrugs. “I just put out the call for traders, paid for the stalls, covered the permits,” he says. “Wasn’t much.”
“Mom set it up,” Tony says with a gentle smile, the smile he always gets when he talks about his mom. “She found it hard, living here without her family, and she wanted to help people. The scholarship funds were a part of it, but she also did outreach with the kids the money went to, tried to find ways for them to fit in.”
Tony lets out his own groan when Steve twists his fingers in Tony’s hair and tugs a little, like he’s wondering how much he can get away with. The noise he elicits from Tony must reassure him, because his next grip is firmer, less cautious, and it spurs Tony on to work harder, wanting to know what it’ll feel like to have made Steve come. Looking up at Steve, Tony wonders what he’s thinking as he watches Tony on his knees, mouth stuffed full of cock. Steve’s free hand brushes Tony’s cheekbone gently and it’s such a contrast to the harsh grip on Tony’s hair that all Tony can do is stare at him.
Steve tries to get better with babies, he really does. It doesn’t seem like people are going to stop handing them to him anytime soon so he tries to learn not handle them like they’re bombs. But he’s still so big, and they’re so small, and as soon as they start crying he freezes up and doesn’t know what to do.
It’s a different building tonight and, judging by the amount of security around, Steve doesn’t think it’s a temporary one like last time. It can’t be their permanent base, Steve knows Pierce isn’t stupid enough to bring Steve in that closely, but it’s somewhere important and that makes Steve uneasy. He’s suddenly sure that whatever they’re going to show him is a lot worse than he initially imagined.
Steve sighs but, resigned to what he has to do, he gets out of bed and follows Tony into the bathroom. After washing up, he pulls on some clothes and smiles when Tony hands him an SI branded hoodie. It looks well worn, and would be oversized on Tony, but it fits Steve just right.
“I’m just glad I knew enough to keep them for myself,” Tony says. “Not that these would’ve been a blip on the radar in terms of my behaviour back then if they’d got out.”
It’s like the air has been sucked out of the room, and all Tony wants is for that to happen, right now. “Never should’ve encouraged you to talk dirty,” Tony groans. “That’s some kind of punishment alone.”
“Sounds good,” Steve says, taking the bottle and draining it as Natasha walks out of the gym. After putting away the gear from earlier, Steve leaves the gym and heads up to his room where he quickly showers and gets dressed. Snagging a baseball cap from his dresser, Steve heads down to the lobby where he finds Natasha waiting for him.
, and Tony could kind of tell that from watching him running all shirtless and sunkissed on the beach in the mornings over the past week, but having him in his space is—well, he’s glad for the excuse of escaping into the kitchen to pull together some food. Which, for Tony, involves opening a couple of bags of chips and pouring them into bowls before grabbing some dip from the fridge and shoving it all on a tray.
“You,” Steve says. He glances down between them at Tony’s cock where it’s pressing right up against Steve’s abs, pre-come making a mess of Steve’s t-shirt. He adjusts his grip on Tony, pulling him the smallest bit closer, and bites his lip to suppress a smile when he sees the way Tony reacts.
It’s not just taking a hit to the head and waking up somewhere he doesn’t know with chains around his limbs, it’s waking up with a fucking gag in his mouth and for a moment he—.
Steve goes quiet as he watches Tony thank Luca for the food, the candlelight making Tony’s eyes shine, and he’s suddenly hit with the realisation he could very easily fall in love with Tony.
Wanting to stay as undercover as possible, Steve passes on taking a car and instead hops on the subway and weaves his way to the Bronx, following the instructions sent to his phone. It’s a nondescript building, and he there’s no outward signs of anything suspicious happening, but then he wasn’t really expecting there to be. Steve looks around a little before walking towards the entrance, and when he pushes at the door he’s surprised that it opens without a fuss.
Sliding his fingers inside Tony, Steve shakes his head. “If you’d worn this in front of other people I would’ve got us arrested,” Steve says, slowly fucking Tony with his fingers. “Wouldn’t have been able to resist taking you as soon as I saw you.”
“Why do you find that so hard to believe?” Steve asks as he sits down on the bed next to Tony. “You’ve gone on about what a hot twink you were in your twenties for as long as I’ve known you.”
Tony pushes his face even closer to Steve’s neck, pressing his mouth against Steve’s skin in a soft kiss and soaking up the warmth from Steve’s body. “Love you,” he says quietly, needing Steve to hear the words and understand that Tony means them, will always mean them, because no one else has ever taken the time to make him feel like this.
“Elegant change of subject,” Steve says. He’s got his gaze fixed on Tony like he’s searching for something, and Tony only just resists squirming under it. “How are you?” Steve asks. “Really?”
Being careful not to smudge the lines on his skin, Tony gets on the bench and shifts until he’s on his side with his arm over his head. He feels a cushion being placed at his back and he cranes his neck. “What’s—”
People used to hand babies to him all the time on the tours, just shove them unthinkingly into his hands like they didn’t realise he could crush them. It was
“You’re not,” Tony says. “As much as I would love to think I’ve singlehandedly given your life meaning, I know it’s more complicated than that or you.”
Taking it back from Tony, Steve slips it on. There’s no visual difference to a regular watch that he can tell, and there’s definitely no weight difference. “You don’t think they’ll take it from me?”
After showering and getting dressed, Steve finds Tony in the kitchen, hunched over a mug at the table. Steve pauses, a fond feeling stirring in his chest even as he wonders if Tony’s moved since last night. “Tony?”
“I don’t know what you call a real one, but the best Christmas I had as an adult was in France one year with the Commandos,” Steve says, remembering. “We’d hunkered down in a small village, Dum Dum had managed to charm the stockings off some dame, and her family took us in to feed us. They didn’t have much, but they had a farm, and they shared what they could.”
“This isn’t cooking,” Steve says, shooting a look over his shoulder. “It’s grilling. There’s a difference.”
“JARVIS? Have you alerted the others?” Steve asks as he leaves Tony’s bedroom and heads to his own floor.
“You called her Aunt Peggy?” Steve asks, looking over at Tony. “I didn’t know—not that—” Steve cuts himself off and sighs, rubbing a hand over his face, the late hour catching up with him. “Her file said she was still alive?”
Steve pauses, glancing at Tony. “It’s—am I doing more bad than good by wanting to track him down?” Steve asks, almost scared of what the answer will be. “Getting rid of Hydra is important, I know that, but—”
Rumlow rolls his eyes before he hits a button. The elevator doors open and Steve steps inside, slightly surprised when Rumlow doesn’t join him. “It’ll take you to the eighth floor,” Rumlow says. “I’ll be right here with your phone.”
“Not that I remember,” Steve says. “I know she had a sister who didn’t come over with her, but that’s it. I wish I knew more.”
Steve shoves his sunglasses up into his hair, his brow furrowed. “No, I—” Steve pauses, like he’s trying to gather his thoughts. “It was while you were in space, I think. When I didn’t know if you were alive, and I realised I couldn’t imagine my life without you in it. Even when we were apart I at least knew you were alive. But then when I saw you with Pepper, I couldn’t say anything, no matter what I was feeling.”
“And you’re not giving yourself enough,” Steve says, setting his jaw stubbornly. “No one else even asked me what I wanted when I woke up, you—you let me live.”
“24 hours, Steve,” Tony says, raising an eyebrow. “You think I was joking about wanting to ride you while I’m this age?”
“In the back,” Steve says eventually, an amused look on his face. “I’m going to shut down the front of the shop, less chance we’ll get a drunk banging on the window.”
Steve looks at him, meeting Tony’s gaze, and Steve would swear the atmosphere around them thickens. Turning his hand over, Steve links their fingers together, the warmth of Tony’s rough palm against his making him feel things he didn’t know he was allowed to feel. “You’ve been right before,” he says quietly, not sure if he can get the words out. “About me. About what I want, who I am.”
“I still have your college sweatshirt,” Tony admits. “It stopped smelling like you years ago, and it’s falling apart, but on my worst days it made me feel better.”
“Shut up,” Steve says, his eyes fluttering closed, eyelashes casting a shadow over his cheekbones in the early morning light. “You know it was.”
“Guess I’ll just have to make you see what I see when I look at you,” Steve says, reaching for his glass of water and taking a sip.
When the elevator reaches Tony’s floor, Steve pushes what he’s seen to the back of his mind and walks straight to Tony’s bedroom, knowing Tony’s following him. Shrugging his coat off, Steve drops it on the couch and turns to look at Tony only to find him staring at him with wide eyes. Steve pulls at the edge of his t-shirt and tugs it over his head, holding it in his hand for a moment before it follows the coat onto the couch.
Tony shakes his head, an embarrassed look crossing his face. “You’re really going to start that already.”
The bullet went straight through, and JARVIS assures him there's no damage that his body hasn’t already repaired, so Steve sits back as Tony cleans him up.
“I didn’t call because I didn’t want to be told you were dead, or have you pick up and laugh at me,” Steve says, shaking his head, a wry smile on his face. “Some days I wasn’t sure which would be worse.”
Pushing himself off the bed, Tony grabs a robe and wraps it around himself, loosely fastening it as he shifts from foot to foot, trying to see how steady he is. Judging himself to be okay, he yawns. “I’m going to shower,” he says. “And to clean the dead rat out of my mouth.”
Steve keeps his face neutral, but he can feel Tony going stiff next to him, and he taps his fingers against Tony’s hip. “Glad you got out okay,” he says before lifting his mug and finishing his coffee. “Tony, what time are we leaving?”
“Keep your ears and eyes open, there’s nothing else we can do,” Tony says with a heavy sigh. “Hey, question, if I’m right and Hydra are part of SHIELD, how do you know you can trust me?”
“I—another me, from a different timeline, he told me Bucky was still alive. I had reason to believe he was telling the truth. Natasha knows some of this.” Steve pauses and reaches for Tony’s hand, tangling their fingers together, pulling strength from his touch. “What she doesn’t know, and what I didn’t know, is that Hydra have infiltrated SHIELD. To the highest level.”
“Tell me what you need,” Steve says, his voice low, like he knows exactly what it is Tony isn’t asking for.
It’s painful, there’s no getting around that, but there’s a soothing rhythm to it, the gentle buzz of the machine rumbling against his skin as Steve inks lines into his skin. Tony can tell how people get addicted to it, he’s halfway there and they’ve barely got started yet.
Tony lands next to Steve, flipping his faceplate up and meeting Steve’s gaze. “Steve? Steve, you with me?”
“And I told you to fuck off,” Tony whispers, remembering the sterile hospital room and Steve by his bed, looking exhausted. “I never wanted you to see me like that. I—I was embarrassed, and I knew what you were thinking.”
In his explorations, Steve’s fingers brush over the fabric of the skirt, and he’s suddenly struck with an idea. Tugging at the fabric, Steve grins when it gives way easily under his strength, and he pulls harder until it’s ripped from the gold around Tony’s hips.
“Of course, you must be a busy man.” Pierce eyes him. “There are some in our organisation who think I shouldn’t be doing this. They say I can’t trust you. What do you think about that?”
The corners of Steve’s mouth turn up and he rests his palm against Tony’s lower back. “You caught me,” he says. “I don’t know what to do about... everything.”
“You’re just—I want to see you,” Steve says quietly, trailing his fingers down Tony’s neck, tugging on the loose collar of the hoodie that’s exposing Tony’s collarbone. “Please.”
If Tony could cry, he would, but his dehydrated body won’t cooperate, and instead all he can feel is his body shaking with the need to cry, but Steve—.
“Almost a week,” Steve says before he reaches up with a sponge and dabs it at Tony’s face. “You—there’s burns, Helen’s coming in with the portable cradle, but we had to treat the infection first. No broken bones, but some of the wounds were deep, and your mouth—the gag cut into your skin, that’s why we couldn’t take it out at the warehouse, but you’re going to be fine. You hear me? Tony? You’re going to be fine.”
“I wanted to kiss you,” Steve says quickly. “I don’t know if you thought it was a joke, or that I was ticking something off a list, or—but I wanted to do it. Been wanting to do it for a while.”
If Steve thought he wouldn’t be able to let Tony go after the market, that’s nothing to how he feels right now, pressed back against the counter with Tony invading all his senses. Tony’s everywhere, and Steve doesn’t want to lose this, ever.
Steve’s arm curls around Tony’s waist as they both drink their coffee, Steve soaking in the warmth radiating from Tony’s body while he half listens to Clint talking about the mission he just got back from. “Wait,” he says. “Clint, go back, what happened?”
Tony’s not sure what the protocol is for having someone who you could’ve fallen in love with sitting in your vacation beach house in a pair of black shorts and a loose salmon coloured t-shirt, but he’d like a guide for it right about now, thanks.
Everything hurts, and Tony doesn’t know what day it is, he doesn’t know how long it’s been since he was taken, and he doesn’t know—.
“You’re a pain in the ass,” Tony says. “I can’t believe I have to talk you into tattooing a wedding band on me.” He laughs as Steve leans in over the table carefully and kisses him. It’s too quick for Tony to really indulge in the feel of Steve against his mouth because all Steve’s doing is proving a damn point, and Tony knows it.
“It feels like I’ve never had you inside me before,” Tony says, bottom lip red from where he’s been biting at it. “Didn’t expect that,” he says with a grin. “Kind of like it.”
They don’t talk on the way home, Steve cradles a bunch of the cookies in his lap as Tony drives them back to the compound, a sense of dread settling on his shoulders. Steve wants to say something, knows he should if only to apologise to Tony, but he can’t find the words. He should’ve just kissed him on the cheek instead of—.
Steve’s chest rumbles with a laugh, and he takes his hand away, ignoring Tony’s frustrated whine. “Now you know how I felt when I saw those photos,” he says, seeking out Tony’s mouth and kissing him. Tony’s arms wrap around him, pulling him down, and Steve goes with it until they’re sprawled out on the couch trading lazy kisses. His hands slip underneath Tony’s sweater as the polaroids fall to the floor, and Steve can’t bring himself to care. Not when he’s got the real Tony underneath him making all kinds of sounds.
,” Steve grunts out as he follows Tony over the edge, his cock pulsing inside Tony as he comes. “Christ, Tony,” Steve breathes out through the last of his orgasm, both his hands gripping Tony’s hips as he rolls to the side, taking Tony with him.
Steve glances at the magazine, making a face when he sees the headline. “You have to stop showing me these rags,” he says.
“Two potentially retired superheroes freaking out because they don’t know what to do next? It’s kind of sad, you gotta admit.”
Steve’s sure he should say something here, but there’s suddenly so much of Tony’s skin in front of him that his brain feels like it’s shorting out. It’s not like he’s not used to seeing Tony’s naked body, but—. Somehow this feels new, seeing Tony like this, and Steve itches to touch him.
“Why weren’t we doing that before?” Tony asks, brushing his fingers over his mouth. “Shit, Steve, I—wow.”
Pierce hums, not taking his eyes off Steve, and Steve resists shifting underneath the gaze. “Follow me,” Pierce says after a moment. “You’ll have to go through security protocols again,” he continues as they head towards a service elevator. “High level assets are down here, you understand.”
The next morning Tony goes out on the balcony and watches Steve jogging down the beach like he has done every morning since he first spotted him. This time, instead of hiding behind the plant in the corner, he stands in the middle of the balcony, hand wrapped around a mug of coffee, and waves back when Steve waves at him.
“From being CEO,” Tony clarifies. “Passed that onto Pepper before I went into rehab, should’ve done it sooner than that but, well. You really didn’t see it all in the news?”
“Why are you making this into a fight?” Tony asks, confused. “Steve, I thought we were on the same page here? I thought that—” he breaks off, his shoulders slumping. “I thought you knew that we wouldn’t be doing this if it wasn’t going to be serious.”
“Because I think you’d look incredible,” Steve says. “God, Tony, seeing those photos of you—all I could think is how good you’d look in that outfit now. How amazing your ass would look covered in lace, your legs in those stockings, and that I’d be the only one getting to see you look that perfect.”
“Wasn’t asleep,” Steve says. “Natasha came to see me and said she, well, said she’d look into Bucky for me, and now I—”
Not wanting to let go of Steve’s cock, Tony tilts his head up just enough for Steve to catch his mouth in a soft kiss. Working Steve’s cock slowly, Tony tries to take his time, wanting to be able to explore every inch of Steve, wanting to learn all the ways to get Steve off.
“There’s so many jokes I could make right now, I want you to know that,” Tony says. “I’m holding back.”
Steve hums, his eyes closing, and the last thing he remembers is the touch of Tony’s lips against his forehead.
It’s not until Tony turns away from the mirror that he realises that’s the first time he’s stood in front of a mirror and not immediately had his gaze drawn to his scars.
Steve watches as Tony pokes the parcels under the tree before he gets up and joins him on the floor by the tree. “Can we leave the gifts we got each other for last?”
“No, I do,” Tony says, walking over to the counter, smiling at the man there. “Natasha recommended you.”
“You brought the wine, so figured I should provide something,” Tony says, taking the glass Steve hands him. “And I don’t mean to sound so much like a book club member, fuck.”
“Last night you said you wanted me in a bed,” Tony says, raising an eyebrow when Steve looks up at him. “Looks like we’re in a bed.”
Tony rolls his eyes and picks up his wine glass. “Stay. Asshole,” he says as he slumps back against the couch, his knee knocking against Steve’s thigh. “We can watch a movie.”
Tony’s pressed up right alongside him, and Steve feels ridiculous. He’s faced off against Nazis, and Gods, and whatever that thing was that came up from the sewers last month but—. Fuck, he’s terrified. “I’m not—it’s not that,” he says, even though it is. “Babies, they don't like me. I’m too big, I guess, they always cry and I don’t know what to do with them.”
“It doesn’t matter what you believe,” Steve says. “I’m not here to prove my loyalty to you, and if you want to make me, well. Try it. See what happens.”
“I know you’re awake,” Steve says. Tony feels the bed shift as Steve perches on the mattress. “Tony—”
Steve holds Tony’s wrists over Tony’s head, raising an eyebrow at Tony before he wraps the fabric around them. “Good?”
It’s fabric, the gag, but secured around his head with something stronger, and Tony doesn’t like the thought of that. It implies—.
Not needing more than that, Tony wraps a hand around Steve’s cock and presses a sloppy kiss to the head, warmth spreading through his body when he hears the groan Steve lets out. Tony lets his mouth get wet, spit spilling down Steve’s shaft, and he jerks him slowly as he runs his tongue over the head, knowing Steve’s eyes are on him, following his every action.
After kissing Tony once more, Steve resituates himself between Tony’s legs before he grabs the lube and slicks his cock up. “You want it like this?” Steve asks, running his hands up Tony’s legs.
“You—” Steve cuts himself off, unable to find the words for what he wants to say. Running his hands up Tony’s back instead, Steve cups the back of Tony’s head and draws him down into a kiss, the feel of Tony’s mouth against his grounding him. He indulges in it, Tony all around him invading his senses and soothing his twisted up feelings. When Tony pulls back, Steve chases him, grabbing another kiss before he laughs softly, his hands settled on Tony’s lower back. “I got lucky with you,” he says quietly, meeting Tony’s eyes. “You know that?”
“That’s not exactly the word I would use,” Steve says absently, looking at Tony. He’s seen pictures of Tony from his twenties, but he never—he hadn’t been attracted to him aside from the general Tony of it all. All the pictures and footage of Tony in his twenties Steve’s seen involved the public Tony, the Tony that puts on a face and fake smile and covers up his emotions.
“Clint got back just after you left to go running,” Bruce says in explanation. “Set off the alarms.”
Steve jumps at Tony’s voice, dropping the pictures on the floor, suddenly painfully aware of how tight his pants are. “I was just—” Steve stops talking as Tony kneels down, picking up the pictures.
Steve’s bare leg rubs against his, and Tony shifts a little until he’s got Steve’s thigh up against his cock, the slight pressure taking the edge off what was becoming a situation. He can feel Steve’s cock resting against his own thigh and the kisses Steve’s giving him get a little sloppier, a little more desperate, and Tony’s okay with going wherever this is gonna take him.
“You don’t,” Natasha says, taking a sip from her mug, her usual calm demeanour shaken. “And you hope he doesn’t find you.”
. He really did. It just fell short, and now Tony’s left hiding in a beach house trying to piece himself back together.
“Just so you know,” Clint says, an imprint of a spatula standing out on his face amongst the other bruises and cuts from his last mission. “You two are disgusting.”
Steve’s curled up on the couch, the Christmas tree that arrived at the compound one day twinkling away in the corner, a book in his hand and a mug of steaming hot cocoa on the coffee table when he hears the elevator ping.
“Yeah,” Steve sighs, closing his eyes and tipping his forehead until it’s resting against Tony’s. “I just missed you so much.”
Steve’s above him, but Tony feels surrounded by him, like every single part of his body and all his senses have been overtaken by Steve as he fucks him. Tony’s high on the thrill of it, every single moment driving him higher, leaving him boneless and desperate to come.
Steve laughs, feeling a lot lighter than he did five minutes ago, and he nods. “Okay,” he says. “One day.”
“I kissed you, in the middle of the Christmas market,” Steve says quietly, sucking in a breath when Tony’s hands slide around his waist, fingers tapping against the small of his back. “How much more direct could I be?”
“I assume you want me to pay,” Tony says, smiling when Steve rolls his eyes. “But if you don’t want me to leave, well, I’ve got no plans.”
Tony nods, the hand on Steve’s forearm sliding down to tangle with Steve’s finger. “Yeah,” he says, squeezing Steve’s hand. “That sounds good.”
Sam smiles as he contemplates Tony’s scrap of paper again. “Steve’s the traditionalist,” he says eventually. “I’ll hook you up with him.”
“Makes life easier,” Steve says, throwing his keys on a small table before they walk into the living room. “It can be hard to get around when my leg starts to ache.”
“Natasha and Rhodey, they found you, I—until they did, I didn’t—the thought of you not—” Steve wipes his eyes with the hand that isn’t holding Tony’s hand. “I was so scared,” he whispers, barely audible to Tony’s ears.
Steve startles when something lands in his lap, and he looks up to see Tony smiling. “What happened to those reflexes?” Tony asks as he drops down on the couch next to him.
“Birdbrain forgot that,” Tony mumbles against Steve’s neck. “I don’t know what he did but it woke everyone up.”
“I don’t—what thing?” Steve sticks his hands in his pockets and ducks his head as they pass by a crowd of people.
“Yeah,” Tony says, standing up and offering his hand to Steve, who looks surprised but takes it. “I need to show you something before you agree to do it, though.”
All the meeting with Fury reveals is how pissed off he is with the World Security Council, and Steve’s sure he didn’t need a meeting to figure that out. As he’s leaving Fury’s office, he sees Rumlow in conversation with another Strike Team member and he’s thrown when Rumlow nods at him and taps two fingers against his collar in a deliberate move. Steve returns the nod, and after he passes them, he hears Rumlow’s footsteps following him into the empty elevator.
A half smile crosses Steve’s face as he glances at the poster before he joins Tony on the couch. “When I came back, I eventually got a VA counsellor. I didn’t want it,” he says with a heavy sigh. “But I’d promised my Ma that I—before she died, I said I’d get help, so when they called, I agreed. But I can be stubborn, and I thought—. I don’t know what I thought. I was really messed up. The guy I got assigned to, he took a whole lot of me not talking, and then one session he gave me that poster and said he’d give me a similar one every session until I started talking. It was what I needed, I guess. Someone who was equally an asshole.”
“You’re gorgeous like this,” Tony says as he strokes Steve’s cock. “Squirming on the bed, so desperate to come.”
“I don’t know,” Tony says as he looks up at the ceiling before turning his head to meet Steve’s eyes. “Been a hell of a year.”
It’s been a long time since he’s had someone take care of him. Been a long time since anyone has wanted to.
“Good,” Steve says. He runs a hand through Tony’s hair, messing up his already unkempt bedhead, and laughs when Tony tries to see what he’s doing. “Tony, I don’t know the right thing to say here, hell I don’t know the right thing to say in a lot of situations, but having you with me—I wouldn’t be able to do this without you. And part of me feels like this is where I was always meant to end up.”
“Then we’ll get you doing it,” Tony says, his fingers tugging at the ends of Steve’s hair. “Whatever you want.”
Steve sighs, rubbing a hand over his forehead as he gets in the elevator, the relief at finally being home sinking into every facet of his being. “Good evening, Captain Rogers,” JARVIS greets him. “Sir will be glad to see you.”
“Yeah, I’m not having you push yourself and pass out on me,” Steve says. “We’ll do the outline and shading, and then see where you’re at. It’s not a judgement on your pain tolerance,” Steve continues before Tony can protest. “I’ve seen bigger men than you not be able to take it for more than a few hours.”
Tony’s words punch Steve’s orgasm out of him like a thunderbolt, his entire body trembling with the force of it as he spills inside Tony. “Fuck,” he breathes out, his face pressed up against Tony’s cheek. “You really—”
Tony lets out a short laugh as he puts his glass on the table. “Even if you were, you could do a lot better than a broken down old man.”
“I swear to god, Rogers—” is all Tony manages to get out before Steve’s kissing him, and he smiles into it, reaching up to tangle his hands in Steve’s hair. It’s an awkward angle, but he can taste the mango that Steve was eating earlier, the slight salt on his lips from his dips in the ocean, and it’s so goddamn close to perfect.
“Please,” Tony says, like it’s the only word he can find. His brain has finally silenced to the point where all he can concentrate on is the need for Steve to hit him, to make him hurt, to get him to the point where he’s so desperate he’ll be coming without any stimulation on his cock. “Please,” he says again. “Steve, I need it.”
“You’re fine,” Tony says, adjusting Steve’s arm until he’s holding her against his side, her legs kicking him in excitement. “There, see, you’re good, she’s safe.”
Tony’s cock is leaking precome all over his stomach, and Steve can’t resist running his hand over the mess, pressing his fingers against the soft skin, but avoiding Tony’s cock. Bringing his hand up to his mouth, Steve meets Tony’s eyes and licks it, a grin crossing his face when Tony groans.
“You look in pain,” Steve says, stepping forward and catching Tony’s chin, gently tilting his face so Steve can see the bruise. “I don’t like it.”
Before last night, the most Tony regretted in relation to Steve was not jumping him the moment it became clear all his faculties were intact and that Tony hadn’t defrosted a brain dead Captain America.
“Yes,” Bucky says, shooting a look at Steve, and before Steve knows what’s happening, Bucky turns on his heel and runs, vanishing into the park.
Instead of answering, Steve sets off on a run, rounding the corner of the block in record time only to see Tony surrounded by a bunch of kids of varying ages. “Uh—Tony?”
“I’m not saying that for sympathy,” Tony says, picking up his mug. “I just want you to know, that’s something I’m making peace with.”
Steve’s brow furrows as he looks at the shoot. They’d dressed him up in a deep blue suit, a stark white shirt with the first few buttons undone, and the hairstylist had fussed with his hair until it fell the way she wanted it. He doesn’t look like himself, and he wonders if Tony is right, if people only see him as an all American man. Steve sighs, slumping back against the arm of the couch a little. “I hate that,” he says when Tony raises an questioning eyebrow at him. “I’m not that.”
Tilting his head back, Tony looks at Steve, a smirk crossing his face. “Dirty play,” he says. “You want to do it? Want to bend me over your knee and spank me?”
“Can’t have you walking around naked,” Tony says. “It’s selfish of me, really, don’t want just anyone seeing all of you.”
“You’re crazy,” Tony says, staring at Steve who is standing in the water, moonlight playing over his skin, with his hand outstretched. “It’s dark, and I—”
Steve stands looking through the mirror, his arms folded across his chest to stop himself from clenching his fists as he watches a man being dragged into the room and forced into the chair. He’s shirtless, one arm made of metal, and when they strap his head to the headrest, Steve finally sees his face.
“No,” Steve interrupts, visions of how Tony flew the bomb into the portal flashing through his mind. “Sticking together sounds like a plan.”
Tony’s the one to break the kiss, his chest rising and falling with every breath he takes as he stares as Steve, his eyes wide, and Steve’s suddenly terrified by the thought he’s done this too soon.
“I know you are,” Tony says, biting his bottom lip. “You know, if you’re having trouble sleeping, then—”
“You think I don’t know how to sneak around my own tower?” Tony raises his eyebrows. “Give me a little credit.”
“Taking me so well, sweetheart,” Steve says, running his hands all along Tony’s body, one gripping the back of Tony’s neck. “Always do, like you were made for me.” With a grunt, Steve bottoms out, his crotch snugly against Tony’s ass. “Perfect.”
“Maybe later,” Steve says, resting his head against Tony’s chest, smiling when his hearing picks up the sound of the arc reactor. “Can we just stay like this for a while?”
“Daycare in the building,” Tony says. “Flew them out when the firefighters couldn’t get to them. Steve will you just—on your hip, you can balance her on your hip.”
“I’ve never—” Steve breaks off. “This is all I have in my life,” he continues. “I work, I go home, I go to the gym, and sometimes my friends drag me out to a bar where I nurse a beer all evening because I’m too scared to find out what could happen if I get drunk.”
“No, I—it’s fine,” Tony says, watching the coffee filter through the machine. “It was a private clinic in New England. Quiet. Small. Which is what I needed.”
“And you couldn’t go back to sleep?” Steve asks, holding a mug under Tony’s nose in the hopes of coaxing him awake.
But then Bucky pauses, like he’s being given instructions, and Steve squints, suddenly noticing the comms device in Bucky’s ear. It had been hidden before, but now that Bucky’s still, Steve can see it, and he would bet his goddamn shield that Pierce is on the other end of that device.
“For wrapping a bow around my cock? I’m sure that's just what the Army was thinking of when I signed up.”
“Not even a drunken one when in college,” Tony says. “But I unfortunately know my pain tolerance is high.”
“Whatever you want,” Steve says, grabbing a bowl of chips and a tub of dip from the tray and leaning back, his shoulder brushing against Tony’s arm as he settles in.
The way JARVIS says that makes Steve’s stomach twist and he stops in front of the elevator. “JARVIS? If Tony needs something, if he—I can trust you to use your best judgement, right?”
“What do you want me to say?” Steve asks. “Come here,” he says, face softening as he gestures with his hand. “Let me see up close.”
Steve returns the smile as he puts his gloves on, and he gestures to the bench covered with saran wrap. “Hop up,” he says. “On your side.”
“Keep staring like that and you’ll make me self conscious,” Tony says, a lazy smile on his face as he runs a hand down his body and grips his cock. “Thought you wanted—”
“I think maybe it would be easier with a friend,” Steve says before he looks up. There’s the smallest hint of a smile on Tony’s face, and that gives Steve a little bit of confidence.
“The biggest thing here,” Tony interrupts. “Is that SHIELD is compromised. We can’t trust anyone working for them. Fury seems to be clean, but we don’t know for sure. We don’t know how deep it goes, and I don’t know how we prove what’s going on.”
There’s an intriguing flush on Steve’s face as he shakes his head. “Not for me,” he says. “Unless you count takeout and a book as date night.”
“Oh, Rhodey’s a lost cause,” Tony says with a smile. “Sometimes I think he enjoys pulling me out of scrapes.”
“If you try and run off, I’ll come after you,” Steve says as he helps Tony slide to the floor. “Look, if I overstepped, then I’m sorry, but—”
Natasha told him it would be worse if he tensed up, so he doesn’t, but the anticipation makes him hold his breath until the machine hits his skin, and he lets it out slowly.
Steve lets her get away with the deflection because the smells coming off the food truck are mouthwatering and by the time they get to the ordering station he feels like he could eat everything on the truck. He lets Natasha order for him, slightly overwhelmed by the amount of choice, and ends up with an entire platter of meat, pita, and salad. Taking their food to nearby steps, they sit down and start to eat.
There’s a soft look on Steve’s face as he reaches down and touches Tony’s cheek. Tony turns into the touch and closes his eyes, savouring the feel of Steve’s skin against his. It’s not even close to being enough to quiet his brain, but it’s something. His eyes fly open when Steve’s hand vanishes, and he bites back the noise that would’ve all too easily escaped his mouth.
“You really know how to brighten my mood,” Steve says, looking over at him. “It’s not that I thought all the evil in the world went away when I crashed into the water, but Hydra still being around? Bucky possibly being an assassin? Not exactly what I expected from the future.”
Once he’s naked, Steve gets back on the bed, Tony underneath him as Steve traces the contours of Tony’s body, kissing him deeply and reacquainting himself with the feel of Tony up against him like this. It’s been too long since they’ve had the time to really be together, both of their lives being far too busy lately, and Steve’s missed it more than he can say.
“What?” Steve looks back up, his brow furrowed. “No, Tony, it’s not about you. Not like that. You just—you’ve been through a lot, and I’m intruding on your life by being here—”
Time passes, and he’s almost finished with a sketch of two men and their baby having a small picnic when his phone buzzes in his pocket. Closing his sketchbook, Steve fishes his phone out and there’s a warmth in his chest when he sees a photo of Tony flashing on the screen.
“Such giddy optimism,” Tony says, and Steve can’t tell if he’s being mocked or not. “Let me guess, SHIELD have put you up in a no window, one bedroom apartment that would make me cry if I set foot in it, right? Wait, don’t answer that. If you want to set yourself up in one of the non-destroyed rooms then feel free. I guarantee even with the new giant air conditioning space it’ll be cosier than whatever Fury’s done for you. And—”
“Yeah,” Steve says, the corners of his mouth turning up as he smiles. “He still works for the VA when they need him, but when I took over the shop, I needed people I could trust and Sam was a natural choice.”
Tony’s taken a seat on a bench by the entrance to Peggy’s building and Steve can see him fiddling on his phone as he patiently waits for Steve to get his shit together. Just knowing he’s there is—Steve appreciates it more than he can say. If Tony hadn’t come with him, Steve would’ve just turned around and gone home, if he’d even made it this far to begin with.
“I’m always going to say bigger is better,” Steve says with a low chuckle. “But with the numbers, if you want them worked into the roses, then I’d take up the whole side so that they’re not lost in the design.”
“To the PICU,” she says and, noticing the frown on Steve’s face, she smiles. “The pediatric intensive care unit,” she continues. “It’s two floors up.”
The big screen flicks on, and Steve glances over at Tony as the movie starts. “If you’ve got work to do—”
When Tony walks into the back room he immediately spots the sunset painting Steve sent him a photo of, and he pauses in the middle of taking his jacket off, taking in all the details Steve somehow managed to get from the photo Tony sent him.
—” Steve winces as he feels the knife slice into his thigh before it’s quickly pulled out again by Bucky.
Tony’s practically vibrating with excitement as he takes it from Steve, turning it so Steve can see the sides of the face. “When you get through security, after you’re sure they’re done scanning you, make a show of checking the time. Put a slight amount of pressure on the edges and that will activate it so I’ll be able to hear you. It’ll also record everything you hear, and I’ll be able to track you, so you won’t ever be alone.”
There’s a look on Tony’s face that makes it seem like he doesn’t believe a word Steve is saying, and Steve doesn’t know how to find better words, so instead he does the one thing he knows how to do. He kisses him, holding Tony’s face in place with both hands, and tries to put into the kiss all he can’t say, all the words he could search for an age for and never find.
There’s a stricken look on Steve’s face and he turns on his heel, almost fleeing the bathroom, and Tony’s left standing there like an idiot. “What the fuck?” Tony mutters to himself as he follows the direction Steve’s headed in, only to find him sitting on the edge of the bed, his head in his hands.
Fingers stroking Tony’s skin, Steve smiles softly. “I’ll take it,” he says, soaking in the warmth from having Tony’s body underneath him, one of Tony’s hands playing with his hair, and he thinks maybe, just maybe, this is exactly how his life was meant to turn out.
The needle hits Tony’s skin and he breathes in slowly, acclimating to the sensation. It’s a different kind of pain this time, compared to the line work, and his mind turns over as he tries to place it. The line work was sharper, more exact, but getting colour is almost blunt, a constant scraping against his skin. Tony wonders what it says about him that he enjoys it.
“Fuck,” Tony says, his heart thudding against his chest. “Dinner. Okay. I can do dinner. I think I can do dinner. JARVIS?”
Suspecting it is one thing, but seeing it with his own two eyes is something very different, and Steve forces himself to watch. Bucky’s unnervingly compliant as they shove something in his mouth for him to bite down on, the metal straps on the chair holding him down at the command of one of the people in the room.
“Not yet,” Steve says, looking around at the agents already there sweeping the park. “My guess is SHIELD are taking care of that end.”
“They don’t mean anything. I’ve had awards from more places than I can count, but do any of them actually mean anything? Did they change anything for the better? No. Luca’s father? He worked on a project that meant we could develop ways to grow food in inhospitable climates. That’s worth complimenting.”
“I don’t know what you mean,” Tony says, looking around for something to put them in before giving up with a sigh. “JARVIS? Got anything I can use as a vase?”
“Okay, we don’t have to bring up my stealth skills,” Tony says, closing his eyes and tilting his head back up to the sky.
Steve buries his face against Tony’s neck as he chases his orgasm, his entire world narrowed down to the feel of Tony’s warm skin underneath him, the scrape of the gold bikini against him, and the sound of their bodies moving together. Steve can’t get enough of it, and he groans, pushing inside Tony one last time, his hips stuttering as he comes deep inside Tony.
The modern world isn’t much better, people ask all the time if he can hold their babies for photos, and Steve still doesn’t know how to say no without offending them. It’s easier when Tony’s with him. Tony
“If you want, I thought dinner tomorrow could—” Steve breaks off and shakes his head. “I have no idea what I’m doing here,” Steve says, squeezing Tony’s hand lightly. “I hope you know that.”
“What’s going on?” she asks as she sits on the couch, taking the space Tony vacated. “Come on, we all know there’s something weird going on here.”
“Oh,” Tony says, taking a step back. “That’s—I would say good, but for all I know you were being fired on with my weapons as well, so—” he cuts himself off and sighs. “Sorry. I’m glad you’re alive.”
“Shrapnel’s a bitch,” Steve says. “Ripped up my quad, got an infection, got shipped out so I wouldn’t lose the leg.”
“I am sorry,” Tony says, turning the jug around on the table until he’s satisfied. “For what I missed. For what I did. I thought a lot, after getting out, about finding you, but—”
“Get out of here,” Tony says, smiling as she does just that, Adam’s chubby cheek resting on her shoulder. “What were you saying before, Steve?”
“I don’t care about that,” Steve says. “You’re the person who’s made this century feel most like home, and, before you start thinking it, I’m not doing this because I think I owe you, or whatever your brain will cook up, I just—I like you, Tony. And I want to see where this goes.”
Steve’s already running before Tony finishes his sentence, and he knows Clint is right behind him. The sight that greets him makes him skid to a stop. Bucky’s there, with his mental hand wrapped around Natasha’s throat.
“Oh,” Steve says. “I don’t—how can I tell her that when I don’t even know myself? Not that—I didn’t mean that I don’t—” Steve sighs. “I’m screwing this up.”
“Well, I’m not inviting them in here,” Tony says. “And good lord, who knew you were such a snuggler?”
“You’re doing pretty good already,” Steve says, offering Tony a small smile. “I guess it feels strange sometimes, everyone knows so much about me, but there’s this side of me no one ever asks about.” Steve takes a moment before he shrugs awkwardly. “I don’t even know anything about that part of me.”
“Twenty one, twenty two, something like that,” Tony says as he looks at one of the pictures. “I’d just taken over Stark Industries, was still a mess, obviously, and I—you know I don’t even remember who I was with when these were taken?”
“Happily fuzzy,” Tony says. “But quieter.” He’s not lying, he can feel his brain relaxing back to it’s usual state. “Thank you.”
Steve gets off the couch and picks up a ball, throwing it across the workshop, not thinking anything of it when Dum-E brings it back to him, but there’s a groan from Tony. “What?”
Steve awkwardly scratches the back of his head before he meets Tony’s eyes. “I care,” he says. “I know you have work to do, and us invading your life only added to your workload, and I’m not trying to be a bother, but—”
At some point during their make out session, they must have fallen asleep because Tony wakes up half on top of Steve and half wedged against the back of the couch, his head underneath Steve’s chin with one hand tucked in the waistband of Steve’s shorts.
Steve feels his cheeks flush as Tony waves the photos at him, and he scratches the back of his neck awkwardly. “I guess.”
Tony lets out a choked sob as Steve pushes into him again and again, one hand gripping his hip so hard it’ll bruise. He’s so tempted to try and get a hand on himself, but just as he’s thinking of it, the pressure on his neck from Steve’s hand gets harder and Tony’s coming so hard his mind goes blissfully blank.
“Bit late for me to start getting shy,” Tony says as he finishes slipping off his jacket. He drops it on the chair like before and tugs his t-shirt over his head, holding it as he turns so Steve can see his side. “How does it look?”
Steve frowns as the market comes into view. “I’m not most people,” Steve says. “And I want to give you a gift.”
“Wanna come while you’re fucking me,” Tony says, his voice strained. “Used to be able to—didn’t need anyone touching me.”
There’s a muffled cough from Steve and he swallows his mouthful of burger. “I’d be careful who you say that to,” he says once he’s done. “Hi.”
Head swimming from the praise, Tony catches Steve’s mouth in a kiss and runs his hands all over Steve’s still clothed body until he can cup Steve’s cock through his pants. “Fuck me,” Tony mutters against Steve’s mouth. “Steve, I want it, make me feel it.”
“Fuck,” Natasha swears under her breath, the only sign that she’s rattled by this. “I didn’t know for sure, Steve, I’m sorry.”
It seems like forever before they make it back to the tower, and Steve heads straight for the workshop, thanking JARVIS as the doors open. Tony’s working on the armour when he walks in, one of the boots on the table in front of him and Steve steps into Tony’s eyeline. “Can people hack my phone?”
“Thank you,” Tony says, the words sounding awkward in his mouth. “So. Do you want to keep hashing over my problems, or do you want dinner?”
“Hey,” Tony says, climbing onto Steve’s lap, knees either side of Steve’s thighs. “Anything for you. You know that.”
“What are you thinking?” Tony asks as he looks at Steve, his cock hard again and resting against his stomach.
“Okay,” Tony says, stripping the hoodie off and dropping it on the floor. “You want me, you got me.”
“More than I’d like to,” Tony says, eyeing the space on the couch before biting the bullet and joining Steve. “Uh, Pepper, she—there were some friends she had and they—” Tony stops talking and takes a sip of the wine. “This is good.”
“I mean, I like kids, you knew that before we got involved. Never really had anyone to think about having kids with, but—”
“Sometimes, sure,” Steve says honestly, a tired smile on his face. “But there’s still good out there. Vaccines, people still look out for each other, the food’s better. What we do makes a difference, or will make a difference, I have to believe that. And I see people out there fighting everyday to make a better world. That gives me hope.”
“You do, now,” Steve says, brushing Tony’s cheek with his nose. “Also I really don’t want to get out of bed.” He closes his eyes as Tony’s fingers run through his hair. “How about we stay here?”
Feeling his cheeks heat up, Steve looks down at the pan and picks up the hot chocolate solids, dropping them in with the slowly heating up milk and watching them melt.
The Tony in front of him right now is in a pair of slightly baggy sweatpants along with a hoodie that belongs to Steve, and that’s making him look even smaller than he is. The edges of his face are softened, not as sharp as they usually are on the face Steve sees every day, but his eyes—they’re still Tony. Still got the warmth that Steve fell in love with years ago.
Tony puts his mug down on the counter before he takes a few steps towards Steve and gently lifts the mug out of Steve’s hand. “Obvious, huh?”
“And you’re wearing the sweater,” Tony says, a smile in his voice that’s all over his face when he looks up at Steve. “You like it?”
“You think they were giving him a version of the serum,” Tony says, staring at Steve. “You—if you’re right, then if Hydra are still around and have had their own super soldier for years, how could anyone not know?”
“What? Oh, yeah,” Tony says, wondering what it was Steve was going to say. “He’s charging, he’d be rolling over to say hi if he weren’t.”
“I know,” Tony says. “But, I mean, we find you, make you fight again, and you discover that the whole self sacrifice thing was kind of pointless since Hydra are still alive and well.”
Tony swallows, his eyes sparkling as he looks back at the painting. “It’s amazing,” he says in a hoarse voice before gently resting it against the couch. “Open yours.”
“Then don’t,” Steve says, running his hands up and down Tony’s body. “We’ll stay here until you’re ready.”
“We have field agents,” Natasha says. “Deep cover across the world, if we expose all of SHIELD’s secrets, they’re all in danger.”
The gag in his mouth is soaked with his blood, and the metallic taste hits the back of his throat with every swallow. It hasn’t been taken off him in the time he’s been there, not even to let him eat. Not that he’s been fed. The man slowly pours water through the fabric, soaking it just enough that Tony stays alive, and Tony despises how fucking grateful he has to be for that.
There’s a rap at the shutters next to the wide open door Tony has at the back of the beach house and he frowns, glancing at the time. It’s not late, but he’s not expecting anyone given that no one actually knows he’s here.
“After Afghanistan, things changed,” Tony starts. “I changed. Not just the business, my purpose, but my body. And none of it was done with my consent. At least this is my choice.”
“Babies cry, Steve,” Tony says, looking at him, his face way too close for Steve to be comfortable. “That’s what they do. And anyway, I’ve seen the photo ops, babies like you.”
“Sure, Mr Stark,” Cynthia says, propping Adam up against her shoulder. “I’ll be sure to work on that.”
“Huh,” Tony says as he leans back against the couch with a sigh. “Rhodey’s working,” he offers. “And Pepper, well, all I know is she’s not spending Christmas with me.”
They say their goodbyes, and Tony drops the phone on the bedside table before turning his attention to Steve. “Morning,” he says, running his hand through Steve’s hair. “Sorry about that.”
“Holy shit,” he breathes out after a moment as he pushes himself up enough to pull out of Tony before he reaches between them. Grasping Tony’s cock firmly, he strokes him, enjoying the familiar weight of Tony’s cock against his palm. “Come on, sweetheart,” he says, watching the way Tony’s tongue swipes over his bottom lip. “You’re always so good for me, you did this so well, and I—”
, but he couldn’t say anything. The only time he had, the stage manager had looked at Steve like he’d admitted to wanting to eat babies and told him to suck it up and get on with it.
“I want to bend you over the bed,” Steve says in a low tone, his hand running down Tony’s body and gripping his ass. “I could make you raw, make you beg for it, and fuck you so good you won’t even know you’re in pain until afterwards when you try sitting down.”
Tony turns away from Steve’s searching eyes, fixing his own gaze on the ugly macrame hanging from a nail in the wall opposite him as a form of distraction, but all it really does is make him feel slightly nauseous. “I don’t want to be an asshole,” Tony says, looking back at Steve. “But you—were we ever friends?”
“Right, I did, yep,” Tony says, wiping his hands on his legs. “So. Clean clothes. Non sweatpants clothes. I can do this.”
“Natasha tells me it’s addictive,” Tony says as he passes by Steve, heading inside and trying not to notice how good Steve smells. “This could be the start of something.”
Brushing the shattered glass off himself, he stands up, puts the sceptre back in the case and looks around. There’s no sign of his double, and Steve doesn’t understand how he’s ended up back with the sceptre when his double was so determined to get it. There’s an echo in his ear and he’s reminded he’s still linked to the rest of the team. “Stark? Anyone? What’s happening?”
“We can’t yet,” Steve says, his thumb stroking over Tony’s wrist gently. “Your skin—we have to wait. I’m so sorry, sweetheart, I know, I know.”
“Yeah,” Steve says, feeling his cheeks heat up even though he knows there’s no way Tony can know what he was just thinking. “Christmas market.”
They’re on another visit to the local children’s hospital, and it’s going fine, generally. No one’s shoved a baby in his arms, anyway, and he’s comfortable sitting at a low table and doing art with the older kids. Looking up from his half finished outline of The Hulk for the kids to colour in, Steve realises Tony’s not in the room anymore. Quickly finishing it up and putting it on the table for the kids to attack, Steve stands up and walks over to one of the volunteers.
“That would be within my parameters, Captain,” JARVIS says, voice sounding almost pleased. “I will endeavour to do so.”
“Now, if you want to eat the pineapple, I’ve heard that—” Tony grins against the kiss that cuts him off and wraps his free hand around Steve’s waist, pressing his fingers against his skin. Tony can feel the sun through the window hitting his skin, and the knowledge that they have another day ahead of them with nothing to do fills him with what feels like happiness.
,” Tony says. “I’m making you a new suit, I was designing you one anyway, but given that the idiots at SHIELD gave you a suit that couldn’t hold off a knife, let alone a bullet, it’s jumped to the top of the list.”
He didn’t realise how fucking tough this would be, and he really wasn’t planning on having a suddenly alive Captain America in his life at the same time as he’s been trying to reframe SI to do... something. Something better. Something
“I don’t—” Tony breaks off, leaning back in his chair, and shrugs. “Okay, I’ve been thinking about your buddy, and if Hydra are still around, then they need a cover, they need a big cover. A cover that would get them access to information they need.”
“I woke up here and I had nothing,” Steve says, his hands in his lap. “Everything I knew was gone, and the next thing I knew I was fighting aliens with people I barely knew. But that day, inviting me to stay, inviting all of us to stay, you made it easier. You made everything easier.”
It quickly turns dirty, Steve’s tongue slipping in his mouth, and Tony falls into it. He never thought he’d get this, never thought for one second that Steve would return his feelings, and Tony’s a little scared that when he breaks the kiss, this is going to end. He hates how much he doesn’t want this to end.
“Yeah,” Steve says. “Uh, Sam will give you the details if you leave your number, but we close at 7, so plan on getting here around then.”
“I still can’t believe you did this,” Steve says when Tony breaks the kiss, brushing their noses together.
Steve’s slightly distracted by the flush on Tony’s cheeks, but he drags his eyes away from him and looks at Peggy. “Is it—I mean—”
“Rhodey would warn you against playing ‘who is more pathetic’ with me,” Tony says, leaning back against the counter. “I always win.”
“I have a stylist,” Tony says with a shrug. “It took some persuading that we wouldn’t wear them where people could see, but she couriered them over this morning.”
Steve ducks his head. “It was—I always hoped you were doing well, but I—” Steve breaks off and looks back up, meeting Tony’s eyes. “I was scared. I didn’t want to find out on the news that you’d died.”
,” Tony cries out as he comes, spilling all over Steve’s hand, his body jerking. “Fuck, I—let me touch you, please, I need—”
“Well. I mean it,” Steve says, his face heating up. “You’re one of my favourite things about this century.”
Getting back in the bed, Tony realises he’s too awake to go back to sleep, and he sits up with his back against the headboard just staring at Steve sleeping in his bed so peacefully. He’s about to press his thumb against the frown lines between Steve’s eyebrows when his phone rings.
“Sure,” Sam says, his face turning serious. “Look, if Natasha told you to come here, I presume you trust her judgement, but let me reassure you anyway. We won’t tell anyone you’ve been here, we have a lot of high profile clients and that’s because we’re trustworthy. We have a private room so you don’t have to be tattooed out here in front of everyone,” Sam continues, gesturing at the area just behind the counter where there’s a couple of people being worked on. “We can also do after hours appointments if it’s needed, whatever you’re comfortable with.”
“Good,” Tony mumbles against the sheets. His body’s trembling with the effort of being on his knees, and he knows his lower back is going to be screaming at him later, but Tony doesn’t care when every single movement from Steve is getting him closer to orgasm. “Fuck, Steve, I need—”
“Want to crawl into bed with me and cry?” Tony asks. “You’re safe with me, if that’s what you want to do.”
“I did,” Steve says, one hand stroking Tony’s thigh through the sheet, sending shivers through Tony’s body. “I do. I don’t know how to make you realise that.”
“You’re not in any immediate danger,” JARVIS says. “But given the circumstances, I would advise you take a look at the reactor sooner rather than later.”
They stare at each other a moment longer before Steve shakes his head and turns, calling goodbye over his shoulder as he walks away. If Tony stands there a little longer than he should watching Steve walk away, then that’s between him and everyone else on the street, apparently, judging by the crowd by the firetruck. Tony notices one of Steve’s buddies say something to him, and Steve looks back at Tony, lifting a hand in a wave that Tony returns awkwardly before he closes the door.
“I have someone,” Tony says between kisses. “She, uh, could make what you said you wanted. In our colours, I mean. Custom.”
“Yeah,” Tony says softly. “She is. She’s got alzheimers, I visit her sometimes, she—well. She has good days, more bad ones lately.”
“Uh huh,” Tony says, slumped against Steve’s body. “Didn’t expect that when I came up here,” he continues, lifting his head to meet Steve’s eyes as he slowly comes back to himself.
Letting Tony guide him through the hallways, Steve tries not to think too much about what he’s about to face, how wrong it could go, and before he knows it, they’re outside Peggy’s room. Steve pauses, watching Tony fiddling with the flowers he brought from New York. “You go in,” Steve says. “See how she is. If she’s good, then—then I’ll come in. If not, we can—I’d cause more pain if she’s not cognisant.”
Reaching up, Steve attaches the fabric to the loop on the headboard Tony built in for moments just like these, and fastens it just enough that Tony won’t be able to wriggle his way out of it. “I think I can make it up to you,” Steve says, wrapping his hand around Tony’s cock and smiling as Tony pushes up into his light grip. “What do you think?”
“Yeah, that’s kind of the problem. I can’t stop, Steve, if I stop then—” Tony breaks off and shakes his head. “I can’t stop.”
Tony walks over and looks at the stencil, his mind automatically filling in how it’s going to look when it’s coloured, and he feels a frisson of excitement run through his body. “Yeah,” he says, a big smile breaking out on his face. “Let's do this.”
“No, Tony, it’s—look, Sam invited me to come home with him, but I said no. I’m fine being here at the compound, I promise. And, hey, I’m not alone,” Steve says, glancing at him. “You’re here.”
“No, you weren’t.” A sad look crosses Peggy’s face and she reaches over to hold Tony’s hand. “I am sorry, Tony, that I wasn’t around more.”
Steve lets a tight smile cross his face before he looks away from Pierce. The elevator is quiet, the churning of the old mechanics the only sound, and Steve wonders who owns the building, if this is potentially a SHIELD building with Hydra hiding in plain sight.
There’s an answering hum from Steve as he tilts his head in Tony’s direction, and Tony takes that as a response.
Steve laughs. “I don’t want a spa weekend,” he says. “I wouldn’t be opposed to a massage, but not from a stranger.”
“You seem pretty keen on it,” Tony says, his head bumping against Steve’s chin as he fidgets on Steve’s lap.
“Not cool, Nat, not cool,” Clint says, sticking his tongue out at her. “We’re with you, Cap. Whatever you need.”
“Yeah,” Tony says, a soft smile crossing his face, the lack of laugh lines throwing Steve off for a moment. “Fuck me.”
“Part of being a team, right?” Natasha says, the corner of her mouth turning up in a hesitant smile. “If we are all a team?”
“I sent a year doing nothing but therapy and meetings,” Tony says. “There’s a lot I had to work through, and it was better for the company if I didn’t come back right away. But I kept inventing.”
“Tony, no. I wanted you to be happy, however that came about. If it didn’t involve me, I would’ve dealt with it. I did deal with it, for a long time.”
“That’s what she said,” Tony says, almost absently as he gets up from the couch. “But yeah, no, you—JARVIS?”
Of course, he could be thinking that because Steve’s fingers are rubbing softly against his hip and Steve’s mouth is working on a damn hickey on his neck, but Tony’s okay with being a little philosophical if it’s getting him this.
“Because I’m not going to look like this,” Tony says, holding up one of the polaroids. “I’m old, and I’m—”
“Well, good,” Steve says, finishing his coffee and standing up collecting the dishes and loading them in the dishwasher, feeling Tony’s eyes on him as he does. “That’s my pick, then.”
“I told you,” Steve says as his fingers fiddle with the edge of Tony’s shorts. “That’s not what I meant.”
There’s a heavy sigh from Steve, and he kisses Tony behind the ear. “One more,” he says. “Then I’m fucking you.”
Steve’s hand grips Tony’s cock firmly, and Tony groans when he realises that Steve’s using his own come to jerk Tony off. “Not gonna last,” Tony says. “Please, I—
“I know,” Steve says, punching Bucky in the throat, his eyes widening when it barely has an effect on Bucky. “I don’t want to kill him.”
“Then stay,” Steve says. “I won’t be long, and my place isn’t far from here if you want to, I don’t know, have a late night snack?”
“Ma died,” Steve says, looking uncomfortable. “There wasn’t much of a reason to stick around in New York after that.”
“Over here, Cap,” comes Rumlow’s voice, and Steve looks over to see him waiting by an elevator. “Need to scan you.”
“There’s a lot about me they didn’t write in the history books,” Steve says, stepping inside the elevator and raising an eyebrow when Pierce doesn’t join him.
“It’s not the shoot,” Steve says. “Not really, it’s—” he breaks off and runs a hand through his hair. “You know, after seventy years in the ice I thought maybe I’d wake up to a more tolerant society, but people still think there’s some kind of American ideal, and they think I’m it because of the way I look. They don’t realise my parents were Irish, that Ma had her accent until the day she died. No one ever asks about her.”
“Your GQ shoot,” Tony says, flicking the holoscreen up so Steve can see. “You look very... all American.”
“I’m a post divorce insecure mess, surprise,” Tony says as Steve pushes himself up and sits on the towel with crossed legs. “You don’t have to—” Tony breaks off, rolling onto his back again, and waving a hand in the air. “It’s fine.”
“You’re telling me,” Steve mutters, looking at the note before folding it up and putting it in a pocket. He was so sure that it was Loki before and now he doesn’t know what to think. Taking his cowl off, he shakes his head and walks to the elevator, where he’s whisked away without needing to press a button once the doors close.
Steve shifts, his arm coming to rest on the back of the couch as he looks at Tony. “She’s a good customer,” he says. “I’ll have to figure out a way of thanking her.”
“Too much? It was too much, wasn’t it? Too soon, really, I shouldn’t be saying things like that when we haven’t even slept together, and—it’s fine, we can forget I ever—”
“You’d be surprised at how similar it is, actually,” Steve says with a small smile, reaching over and tapping Tony’s knee lightly. “You don’t have to perform for them, Tony.”
“It’s Christmas and I’ve got you in my bed,” Steve says, his fingers rubbing a small circle against Tony’s skin.
Even though they’ve exchanged numbers, Tony’s not expecting any contact from Steve, so when he gets a text a few days after they’ve parted asking how he’s healing up, he has to pause in the middle of a meeting. He doesn’t know if this is something Steve does with every client, but he responds anyway, and is pleasantly surprised when it’s the start of an ongoing conversation.
“They were a secret division of Nazis, Tony, they weren’t exactly advertising back in the forties. And if they do have him then maybe... maybe they don’t use him all the time, maybe they—Tony, this could go deeper.”
“I don’t know,” Steve says with a sigh, standing next to Tony. “It reminds me of what’s underneath, I guess.”
It’s chaos, the fire department is working on getting the flames out, and Steve can see people injured and confused in the crowd. “Iron Man, you help the fire department with search and rescue,” Steve says through the comms. “I’m going to do what I can down here.”
His cut and bruised hands start shaking and Tony stumbles towards the bathroom counter, gripping the edge of it. Breathing deeply, Tony keeps his eyes open, trying to keep himself steady, and it’s—. He can do this. He can.
“We are,” Tony says. “If you’re done here, want a ride back to the tower? We’ve got time before the reservation.”
“No, you got hit pretty good last night,” Steve says, the corners of his mouth turning up in a soft smile. “Reminded me of me. Smaller me.”
Steve does, and this time it’s not tentative at all, it’s a kiss like Tony remembers it, with Steve giving everything he has. Tony slides his hands around Steve’s waist, trying to pull him closer, and suddenly all he wants to do is wrap his legs around Steve and make him walk them to the nearest flat surface. Instead, he breaks the kiss, his hands resting on Steve’s hips, and Tony sighs. “Fuck,” he breathes out. “I didn’t mean—”
Steve shrugs. “I don’t know. These last few years, it’s—I can see why other places were fearful of a man wearing the flag. I can understand that, and I don’t know if that’s who I am anymore. Don’t know if that’s who I want to be.”
“Your ass is so red already,” Steve says, a series of short sharp slaps making Tony groan. “And I haven’t even got the paddle yet.”
Tony’s making thoughtful noises as he scans the list, and Steve sips his hot cocoa, suddenly very sure this Christmas is going to be like no other he’s ever had before.
He wants to take his time, he does, but Tony’s so goddamn tight around him that Steve doesn’t think he can. He just wants to get lost in Tony’s body, wants to fuck him hard until he’s filling him up, making him cry out in pleasure, and from the way Tony’s clinging to him, that’s exactly what Tony wants as well.
Tony does end up having to tap out after the linework and shading gets finished, and they make an arrangement for him to come back in two weeks when he should be healed enough for Steve to start adding colour to it.
kiss. It’s slightly awkward, having caught Tony with his mouth open in the middle of speaking, but then Steve cups the back of Tony’s neck, tilts his head a little more and—. Suddenly it’s the best thing Steve’s experienced since he woke up. Tony’s soft lips against his stirs something low in Steve’s gut, and he wants Tony even closer. Wants to pull him onto his lap and not leave room for any doubt about Tony being Steve’s favourite thing in the future.
“Can’t guarantee it, but anything else would either take too long to fabricate, or would have to be on all the time and would definitely get you caught, so we’ll take our chances with this.”
“Okay, right. If there’s something I can help with, that Tony wouldn’t ask for, please let me know.”
Tony drops his hand to his lap and shrugs. “Sure,” he says. For a moment, all Tony is aware of is the sound of the waves outside lapping at the shore, the scent of the sea air floating through the still open door, but then—.
When Tony gets to the shop on Friday, Steve’s outside in a leather jacket eating a burger and Tony pauses, letting himself take in the long line of Steve’s body. The longer he looks, the more he starts to regret his choices. It’s not like he didn’t know Steve was attractive when he met him, but knowing that and realising they’re going to be alone in the shop with Steve’s hands on him for hours is an entirely different prospect.
“Fuck,” Steve mutters under his breath. He doesn’t dare go and disturb Tony, not wanting to push him to the point where Tony won’t talk to him, but after putting the cookies in the kitchen, he finds himself walking down the hallways towards Tony’s room anyway. Pausing at the door he can hear Tony inside, and he almost brings his hand up to knock, but changes his mind. Instead, he leaves Tony’s bag outside and heads to his own room.
“When we get home, I’ll have JARVIS play you the footage,” Steve says, a smile crossing his face as Tony makes a face at him. “Peggy, please continue.”
Steve laughs, trailing his fingers along Tony’s back. “I guess she wasn’t so bad. Glad we found her parents quickly, though.”
“The press,” Steve mumbles into a couch cushion. Feeling like an idiot, he rolls over and stares up at the ceiling, looking at the patterns the holoscreen lights are making. “I don’t understand how they can—all I want to do is help.”
“I won’t wait up,” Steve says, before turning and heading to the elevator. It’s waiting for him, and Steve tries not to show what he’s feeling on his face as he gets in. Rumlow’s standing there when the elevator doors open at the lobby, and Steve holds his hand out for his phone.
There’s a thoughtful hum from Steve, and Tony would swear the air feels thicker. “This might sting,” Steve says. “Slow breathing.”
It’s easy, Tony realises, as he stands and sips at his coffee, watching Steve throw pineapple into a bowl, and he thinks he should be scared of that. It’s only been a few days and Steve’s slipped into his life like he’s always been there, like this is how they were always meant to be, and that’s—.
Looking over, Tony sees him leaning against the doorway. “Oh,” Tony says, looking back at the painting. “Really?”
Tony makes a wounded noise and huddles closer to Steve. “You should feel lucky I’m allowing you to live,” he says, shooting a glare at Clint. “Your new arrows are being put on the back burner,” he continues as Bruce hands him a refilled mug of coffee. “Bruce, however, will be getting stretchy Hulk pants as soon as I can make them.”
Tony pushes himself into a sitting position, his head screaming at him as he does, and he has to take in a few deep breaths to stop himself from puking. “I have to,” he says, looking at Steve.
special day today’,” Peggy says, her shoulders shaking with laughter. “Oh, Tony, sweetheart, you looked ridiculous. Bright red lipstick all over your mouth, eyeshadow around your eyes and on your forehead, it was so funny.”
Tony’s face softens and he takes a few steps towards Steve, sliding the car seat handle to the crook of his elbow. “Hi,” he says in a soft voice to the baby, who gives him a gummy grin in return. “How about we show Steve here how to get you comfortable?”
Everything’s blurry, and the gag is still in his mouth, but—. It’s Steve, it is, it’s Steve, and he’s there, but Tony can’t speak and he just wants—. With his now free hands, Tony goes to pull at the gag, but Steve’s hands stop him, and Tony looks at him in confusion.
“We don’t have to drag this out,” Tony says, waving a hand in the air. “Yes, my fifty four year old ass still has a crush,” he says with a self deprecating laugh. “It’s pathetic.”
“Well,” Steve says, shrugging. “You’re not wrong. Apparently when the world isn’t ending, I don’t have much to do.”
, come on, not now,” Tony’s voice drags Steve back to action, and Steve throws the shield at Bucky, but Bucky catches it with one hand.
“No, I—it’s fine,” Tony says as he adjusts his tank top from where it rode up. “I forget, sometimes.”
It’s a market day in Union Square, and he picks up some snacks along with some apple cider before settling in a quiet spot in the park to people watch. When he’s finished his food, he takes out the small sketchbook in his pocket and a pencil, and sets about challenging himself to do quick sketches of people who pass him by. It’s grounding, Steve likes the way sitting in the square on a busy day lets him be part of the modern world without having to actually interact with people. There’s some teenagers dancing a little way away, and Steve concentrates on trying to capture their movements, the fluidity of their bodies, attempting to make them come to life in his little book.
“That's all I can ask for. I’ll let Tony know that you need some time.” Steve nods at Peter and heads back to his apartment.
“Well, if that isn’t the best sight to come home to,” Tony comments from the edge of the room after making eye contact with Peter over Steve’s head. Steve startles, slightly biting the nipple he had been laving, causing Peter to yelp and Tony to laugh. Steve glances up at Peter’s face to see him grinning at Tony, and bites him again, free hand pinching his other nipple at the same time. Now both Peter and Tony groan, Peter at the dueling feelings and Tony at the sight that they make.
at that, but concentrate here, now. You’re saying thank you remember?” Tony teases, as he threads his hands through Peter’s soft hair. Peter moans as he increases his attention on Tony’s cock, sucking him down as far as he can before moaning again, using his hand to roll Tony’s balls and letting the suction and vibration work for him before bobbing up for a breath and sinking back down.
“Um,” Peter starts, but Tony interrupts. “Nope, no saying no. Free food Pete! I remember college, never turn down free food.”
“Well, that’s all the gifts I need tonight,” Tony starts as he walks toward them, only pausing to toe his shoes off, before stepping onto the plush rug, “Steve, you always know just what I want. Good thing I brought something for Peter, he’ll need it after your rough treatment.” Tony smiles as Steve rolls his eyes in exasperation.
. They spend the rest of the afternoon in Peter’s lab, comfortable with each other, occasionally laughing, with Peter elbow deep into his project and Steve with his sketchbook.
Tony holds Peter tightly against him until Peter pulls away, leaning in just enough to leave a smacking kiss on Tony’s lips, and then standing up. Completely self confident, Peter walks nude across the workshop floor to his backpack that he had dropped when they walked in. Rifling through one of the small pockets, Peter pulls out a dark read and blue swirled butt plug. Resting one foot on a chair, he bends forward, placing his loose hole directly in Tony’s sight. With a groan, Peter slides the large plug into place before standing and heading back toward his pile of clothes.
Peter pauses, turning and reaching to grasp Steve’s hand with his free one, still holding Tony as well. Looking at Steve’s blue eyes, he says, “Never before have I felt so accepted and cared for by anyone else.”
“Alright,” Mr. Stark says with a chuckle and a smile, “No one’s dying here today. What’s your name kid? I can’t just keep calling you kid, and it’s Tony, not sir, capiche?”
Peter startles up from his equations in the lab at a knock on his door. He can see a tall shape through the opaque glass door. Glancing at the clock and seeing how late it was, he runs to the door and throws it open.
“Perfect. I’ll make lunch then, you need to eat more than sugar cereal,” Steve says as he walks into the kitchen, eyebrows raising at their bowls and the box still on the counter.
Peter’s sure that he’s never seen anyone skirt around the table that fast in his life, but the feel of being pressed up against Steve is something he’s never experienced before. Tony’s taller than him but not by much, Peter now has to tip his head back all the way. Steve is so tightly coiled that Peter can feel his abs flexing under his shirt as he clings to Steve during their kiss. Kissing Tony felt warm and decadent but kissing Steve felt like a live wire. Sparks traveled up his back and into his hair where Steve was pulling on it. Peter could feel the tension in the air, spidey senses flickering with the unknown feelings. Then it got impossibly better when Tony stepped up behind him and pressed him further into Steve, kissing his neck and nipping at his ear. “I think you like this Petey. Do you like us both touching you? Both kissing you?”
Tony and Peter are working side-by-side, both absorbed into their respective projects when Peter’s stomach roars in protest of the long hours they’ve put in today.
Peter flies apart at the thought of Tony taking two loads of Steve’s cum, and his body being used like that so Tony can
“I’m always hungry. Could we just have cereal, though? I’m not burning my apartment down this early in the morning.”
He had pulled the sheets up to make the bed and is arranging pillows when Tony appears in his bedroom doorway.
“A gift? You got me a gift?” Peter questions excitedly as he sits up, practically pushing Steve’s face away from him in the hurry to look at his box.
Steve sets the bags down and starts pulling out the food as he continues, “I don’t mind coming to you actually. I know your work is important, but so is taking care of yourself.”
“Hey sleepyhead.” Tony teases, “Had a busy day today, did you? I waited for your text, but after a few hours I just decided to come home. And what do I find? You. In my spot, that’s what.”
When Peter learned that he had been granted a Stark Fellowship to pursue his Masters degree, he had almost fallen over with excitement. He had graduated from Columbia that spring and had moved back in with Aunt May for the summer, taking a break from work and school for the first time in years. Peter had bolted from his room at May’s tone as she came in with the mail early July, to find a large packet from Stark Industries with his name on the front. Not only did the Fellowship cover tuition, private lab time and a generous food allowance, but it included a private apartment near campus, rent free, including utilities and everything.
“Yes Tony, reservations and everything, so why don’t we stop chattering at Peter’s door and try to make those reservations for once, hmm?” Steve says with a smile at Peter, while turning Tony’s shoulder toward the elevator.
Pulling out his phone to distract himself for the last few minutes of waiting, he had just launched Instagram when there was a knock on the door. Peter rushed to answer it, almost breathless with excitement. Steve was standing at the door, hands on his hips, intentionally blocking Tony from rushing in. Peter glanced around Steve to see Tony with a very large, excited smile and almost bouncing on his toes.
When Steve stood to turn on the lamp in the corner, Peter realized how late it had gotten. Standing from the very comfortable couch, he thanked them for a great lunch and a fun afternoon before heading home.
Steve moves to sit both himself and Tony on the couch by Peter before continuing, “I found out a while ago now. After your disastrous first attempt at asking Peter to join us, I picked him up and startled him. He
“Is it a fancy Rubix Cube? It’s just a bit bigger, but it doesn’t seem to have any moving blocks,” Peter teases, as Steve finally moves himself off the floor and onto the cushion next to Peter, bracketing him in between them.
“Well hello to you too, Baby. I thought you were with Tony today. Not that I don’t love to see you, but what are you doing here when there’s a new lab to explore?” Steve questions as he follows Peter into the apartment.
Peter jumps, flipping midair to land lightly on his feet, barely making a thump, but startling Tony nonetheless.
“What do you need, Baby?” Tony questions, as Peter throws his head back, panting, and presses his hips down harder against Tony’s belly.
“Sure Tony.” Peter smiles, still laughing, “I’m very thankful. So thankful in fact that I already made coffee.”
Tony hangs up and immediately sticks his tongue out at the phone, before he turns to Peter. “Breakfast, Pete? Are you hungry?”
After sliding on his boxers and pants, Peter looks up at Tony to find his eyes completely glazed over, still staring at the spot Peter was standing at near the door.
Peter looks closer at Steve’s smile and doesn’t see recognition. He sighs a little with relief that he was enough in the shadows that maybe Steve didn’t see him, and smiles back, before complementing his food again.
Peter wakes, snuggled into Tony’s side, the morning light streaming into the room past the edge of the curtains, the smell of bacon in the air. He turns and burrows his face into Tony’s armpit, feeling the rumbling of Tony’s chest as he laughs.
“If you really want to, I could use another hand. Can you climb over it, through the door and lift that side? Looks like my help’s abandoned the job.”
“And it’s a little early, your semester doesn't end for another few weeks, but we could ask you now.” Steve reaches for Peter’s hand to hold as well. “Peter, we would love it if you would consider moving back to the tower with us.”
“Can I change first?” Peter asks, looking down at the same clothes he wore the day before, all rumpled from sleep.
“Yeah, Baby, I can do that for you.” Tony pushes Peter’s hips away as he says, “Stand and strip Baby, just take it all off. Save the strip tease for next time.”
“Alright, fine it was, but it wasn’t supposed to explode. Sometimes science just happens like that!”
Tony laughs as he walks to the left side of the bed. “I usually sleep on this side, so scoot,” Tony says, as he pushes Peter's arm and hip across the duvet, then folds his side of the blankets down. “Fair warning, Steve’s a furnace and it’s made me a cuddler.”
“No Mr. Stark sir. I’m definitely going to die right here on the floor. If not from my Clif bar, then from the embarrassment of doing
“Yes.” Peter moans, “That’s it- yes! What I’ve been waiting for. So much better than boys my age, Daddy.” Peter’s quads are tight as he bounces himself atop Tony's cock, barely slowing as his second orgasm sprays against Tony’s ruched up shirt.
“Almost Baby, gotta lube you up here, hold on to me kid,” Tony says as he presses one slick finger into Peter but finds no resistance.
The lock disengages and the door opens just in time for Tony to exclaim, “Boring! Boring?! FRIDAY? Light ‘er up!” The monitors all click on, the holograms pop up beautiful and blue and best of all, the lights on the row of Iron Man suits on the back wall all start to glow, giving off a warm uplit glow.
“Steve! I’m so sorry I’m late!” Peter starts in a rush, before sprinting back toward his desk to grab his coat.
, but I...” Peter fumbles with his words, flustered at the offer that he’s always dreamed of, joining the Avengers as well as the option to move in with them at the tower. Peter looks down at the table, organizes his thoughts for a moment, and then smiles at Steve and Tony before explaining. “What if I want to join the Avengers but stay in your room?”
Steve brings them all chicken soup and warm crusty rolls and lets Peter eat two bowls before clearing his throat and glancing at Peter nervously.
“I’m sorry Mr. Captain America Steve Sir! I’m so sorry! I won't, I mean, I can’t.. I’m sorry!” Peter practically sobs out before he runs out the door and across the hall, locking and chaining his door before falling to a heap on the floor.
“I just missed you kid, and I thought that maybe if you had any questions then I could answer them? Steve’s not home, he’s a little upset with me for ‘not being an adult and having an actual conversation’ with you. Can I come in?” Tony looks hopeful, but rushes on to fill the silence, “I mean, I won’t if you don’t want, I’ll go away and leave you alone if that's what you’d prefer, I mean it would kill me to not see you anymore, but I can leave. Yeah, I’ll go, sorry..” Tony turns to leave at the still, unmoved, seemingly uninterested face that Peter was still sporting.
“Baby, I can't even stand right now, you killed me dead, and you still have energy to get up and work? To be a young superhero I guess. FRIDAY? Will you show Peter around and throw up a few of the more recent projects on the holo for him? I’m just going to, I don’t even know, take a nap or something right here.”
Once inside the building, they decide to head to Peter’s place for dinner so he can change into something more comfortable. They eat the pizza on the couch, snuggled, and watch the next episode of BSG.
“At least one more, Daddy. Fuck me hard and come with me,” Peter replies with a grin and a cheeky wink.
“Mmm,” Steve starts, “I can almost find it, I’ll have to look closer though. Can I look closer, Baby?”
going to tell you, I was! I just hadn’t had the time yet, and things were still so new, and you guys hadn’t mentioned Spider-Man at all when you were talking about super hero stuff and I just didn’t really know how to bring it up? Also why are we awake, talking about this at 6:45 in the morning on a Saturday?”
Peter reaches through the blankets for the coffee and snuggles into its warmth for a moment before Tony clears his throat and asks, “So, do you have any questions about anything Steve said?” Peter just shakes his head no, still holding his mug tightly. “Ok then, wanna watch a movie? I can stay and just hang out, if you want.”
They sit and just eat without discussion for a while before Peter coughs a little, trying to clear his throat. “This is really good Steve. Thank you for making supper for me.”
Tony’s head shoots up from where he was slurping his last noodle up, “Really? You have one of my Fellowships? No wonder you live here, but I thought I met everyone the night of the Meet & Greet. Did I meet you and forget?”
“Pete?” Steve calls as he turns the knob. Steve staggers as he steps in and looks toward the bed. The light of the setting sun is illuminating Peter’s skin in reds and oranges as he lays there, offered up.
Peter takes a single step toward the couch before tapping his wrists and watching the tech flow off his body, into a pair of thick red cuff type bracelets. Peter looks back up toward the couch in time to see Steve reach out and place a comforting hand on Tony’s shoulder, Tony looking devastated.
Steve continues, “So the kitchen is ruined, as is most of the living room, and Tony’s lab below had some water damage. It’s being worked on, but it’s going to take a few months. This apartment was the only property that Tony owns that was open and close enough for me to head into the office.”
own.” Tony corrects, “So this is home until the contractors give the all clear, which, considering the mess it was, probably a while.”
Peter rolls into Tony instead then, mumbling, “Mean,” at Steve who lets out a laugh before climbing out of bed and pulling on some sleep pants from his drawer.
“Ready Sir? I think that if we go up and you twist clockwise and move 3 feet to the right, we can get it in the door without scratching anything.”
Tony grins at him and sticks his tongue out at him childishly before answering, “I don’t really, just a few things Mom taught me a long time ago. Tomato sauce that simmers for 6 hours, check. Toast, will burn it every time. This is perfect actually,” Tony says, reaching out for Peter’s hand, “I make the base components, and Steve masterfully mixes it together. We work together to have it turn out well. It’s just like our relationship. And in this pasta dish of life, we’re just needing some cheese. Something to bind it together.”
“Thanks Tony. I’ll be here, you have a good rest,” Peter says with a kind smile and a gentle kiss, before getting up and chatting with FRIDAY about chipset on the holo-table.
Finding a mover had been easy, not that Peter had a lot to move, the number was included in the housing part of the packet. All he had to do was call the company and tell them what date he wanted. May and Peter had gone thrift shopping for more furniture with the first allowance disbursement and then had spent the day making the 5th floor apartment a home. Peter had also found himself a new-to-him suit, because along with the details of the Fellowship award was an invitation to the Stark Scholarship Meet & Greet in August.
“Peter,” Tony groans out, feeling the wet seep into his shirt. Tony gathers Peter in toward his chest, pressing Peter’s head onto his shoulder. Peter responds with kitten licks to Tony’s neck, moving up to nip at his jawline, before heading to his ear to whisper, “I need you to fuck me, Daddy.”
Peter’s eyes flutter open slowly as he smiles euphorically at Steve. “Yesir. Looking atcha, ‘s so good Sir.”
“Peter.” Tony quietly says, almost directly into his ear which makes Peter shiver and lean back into Tony’s space. Tony rests one hand on his hip, steadying him. Peter feels the heat of Tony’s hand through his thin shirt and it causes goosebumps to erupt across his body.
Tony pops over to his own bathroom for a change and quick brush of his teeth before heading back to Peter’s. Peter changed very quickly into his least embarrassing sleeping clothes. No matter how worn in and fluffy his Hello Kitty pants are, plaid flannel and plain white tee are on the docket for tonight.
Slowly resuming his strokes, Steve looks at Peter, from the top of his curls, down his rippled abdomen covered in his own cum, to his flushed cock. Steve takes a swipe of Peter’s cum from his stomach with his thumb and sucks on it for a moment, before repeating the action, only feeding it to Peter instead. Peter moans at the contact and sucks greedily on Steve’s thumb, pulling back to nip around the nail before sucking it deep into his mouth. Steve can feel the vibrations of Peter’s moan run up his arm and straight to his dick. He pulls his spit covered thumb out of Peter’s mouth and swipes his hand down Peter’s chest, through his own cum and then onto Peter’s cock, tugging at it quickly so they come together.
Walking in, Peter’s amazed at the difference one evening had made. From the mostly bare apartment that it had been, it looks almost homey now. Throw blankets and pillows on the couch, a painting in the hallway, a few metal parts strewn along the coffee table next to a mostly empty Stark Industries mug.
Tony wakes first, feeling Steve's eyes on him and glances over with a fond smile. He arranges the blankets a little more over Peter as he continues to snuggle into Tony’s shoulder. They sit together quietly for another 15 minutes before the smell of rich tomato sauce and cheese starts to permeate the house and causes Peter’s stomach to growl, waking him.
And that's it! Huge thanks to TellMeMoreAgain for their amazing comma corrections, anything I missed is completely my fault, I don't listen very well. Also, thanks to the Starker&More discord board for spawning this creation.
Tony responds after sipping his espresso, “You mean did we look for you and choose to live next to you in order to seduce you?”
Peter feels a slick finger press into his body next to Tony and groans, but nods at Tony’s questioning eyebrow. Tony smiles at Steve, “Go ahead babe, he can take it.”
Peter feels ready to come apart again already, Steve’s like a jackhammer, steady and quick, slamming in and yanking out over and over. Peter feels fuzzy and warm, almost floating in sensation when Steve pulls out and flips him over to his back. Steve grabs his ankles bringing them both up and over his right shoulder before pushing back in. Steve pauses there and pets Peter’s face tenderly, from his hairline over his cheek and to his chin.
Steve gives Peter’s shoulders a little squeeze before shifting him to sit up and face him a bit more, deciding eye contact and honest facial expressions were more important than a cuddle at this moment. “I think you are a wonderful young man and I think you are perfect for Tony. He’s happier when he gets to see you and spend time with you in the lab, you intrigue him intellectually in ways that I never could. Tony wants to date you, and I’m hoping that I could get to know you better too.” At Peter’s shocked face, he continues, “I know that we’ve had some dinners together, and this may seem strange, but Tony and I have talked about it. But only if you want to! I know this is a big ask of you, and we kind of dropped it right on your lap, but will you think about it? Please?”
When Steve answers the door, Peter brushes past, leaning up to dropping a quick kiss on Steve’s lips as he goes.
“You know it. Says that you need protein and carbs and stuff. I’m just happy to get to eat with you.”
Over the course of winter break, Peter saw Tony or Steve every day. Often he would find Steve in the workout room in the building and more than once he found Tony in the Laundry room with one of the machines taken apart down to it’s nuts and bolts. Granted, it worked much better after Tony had tinkered with it, but it seemed silly that a tech mogul like Tony Stark would be the washing machine repair man.
With a dark chuckle, Steve asks, “No, Baby? If this wasn’t what you made then why are you showing it to me?”
Peter laughs, tipping over onto the couch, laying on his back. He hears the sink run and Steve drink before it’s running again. Steve returns with two glasses, but pauses at the threshold, staring at the couch. Tony’s reclined, relaxing into the plush couch. Peter lays on his back with one leg bent up and one leg off the side of the cushion. Both have hard cocks resting flushed on their stomachs.
Peter turns to scurry out of the room before seeing Steve whisper to Tony and point to him. He definitely misses the grin that Tony gives his retreating back.
to be on time anyway,” Tony grumbles as he steps through the open door, Steve and Peter close behind.
Peter spins, as if startled by Tony’s touch, and vigorously attacks Tony's mouth with his own. Peter grips the sides of Tony’s shirt as he steps them back against the empty work table.
Tony fusses with the remote for a bit before picking A New Hope and shifting closer to Peter, with his arm resting on the back of the couch. Peter makes it just through Leia’s impassioned plea for Obi-Wan when his head tips onto Tony’s shoulder fast asleep. Tony smiles down at the brown curly head, gently removes the mostly still full mug from Peter’s hands, and snuggles him in a little closer before closing his eyes as well.
“Already poured and on the table Tony.” Steve replies as he’s dishing heaping spoonfuls of pasta and cheese onto plates.
“That’s it?” Steve asks incredulously as he runs his hand through his hair, scratching out his helmet hair.
The last day of break, Peter finds Tony working on the motor for the elevator when he asks, “Tony, why are you disassembling the Elevator?”
“Yeah yeah, chuckle it up over there old man. Some of us need more than coffee and spite to get us through the day.”
They work together to get in the apartment, which is just a bit larger than Peter’s, and into the living room.
“I love you both, too, and I’m definitely moving into your home, and into your bed, and onto your team. You’re exactly what I want."
“Sure do, Tony,” Peter grins as he steps out, into the garage under the building, leaving a stunned Steve behind. “Great idea. A+ work today.”
Peter’s moan causes Steve to grip his hair tighter in response to the vibrations through his cock. Steve mostly holds Peter’s head still, as he thrusts up with his hips into Peter’s waiting mouth. Steve, flushed and shaking, nods to Tony for him to take back over, wanting it to last longer. Tony grips Peter’s head again, bringing his face down to his balls that Tony is holding taut for him to suck. “Good boy Pete. Taking us so well. So sweet for us.” Tony says, as Peter smiles up at him, mouth full of Tony. Peter sucks hard and starts humming and it makes Tony pull his head away. “God, Baby, you can’t do that to me.”
