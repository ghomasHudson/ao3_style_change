“You must be exhausted,” Steve said quietly, running his fingers through Tony’s hair, kissing his temple. “Love you. Get some rest.”
do it.” There was a deciding pause, and suddenly Steve’s body heat was gone. Tony could feel him slide his hands his chest, lingering around his belt. It took him a second to realize Steve was on his knees. Tony was positive he’d never been more hard in his life. The party seemed a million years away now, as Steve made quick work of his belt. For only a second Tony’s hazy brain wondered how many times Steve had done this, he was so good, so efficient-
Between the thought of that and what he wanted for breakfast, he managed to get back to sleep, situated mostly on Steve’s side of the bed.
Tony blinked. “Sleep? After all those promises?” Tony asked, positively disappointed.
“Don’t be so dramatic, it’s just a little bit of swelling.”
Steve hit the guy three times. Once in the face, once in the chest and once in the gut. That should have taken him down, it should have been enough, but the guy reeled forward and hit him hard in the face anyway. Blood erupted from his nose, and he saw black spots in his left eye.
“Maybe i’ll tell you another time.” He said, quietly getting Tony out of his clothes and under the blanket. “But for now we got to sleep.”
Steve smirked.
“What?” Tony asked, swallowing hard as Steve poured a healthy amount of lube over his fingers, looking Tony dead in the eye as he did so.
“Sometimes you just can’t.” He said quietly, trying to tame the mess that was her hair. “Is there food?”
“ Don't you want a ride?” he called at Steve’s retreating back. Steve turned around and shook his head.
“ Don’t worry. He won’t see a thing. Now, can you tell me about the Howling Commandos?”
For now, he rearranged Morgan on his shoulder as he walked her away from the field and into the house he'd built, now for them.
“You don’t get to make demands, Tony. I’ve had a while to think about this. All on my own.” Steve ground down hard, punctuating his statement.
“You’re shitting me.” Barnes sat forward in his seat, mouth slightly open. “ I didn’t...I thought they’d caught him for good. I figured it was over when they arrested him..I stopped following the case-”
"Steve," Clint called. Steve turned to look at him. He'd given his phone to The Kid, she frowned as she attempted to scroll through it. "We gotta teach this kid to sign."
Tony got up and stretched, his back popping as he twisted and put his arms up. He made his way to the bathroom, scratching the back of his head. He didn’t even realize the shower was running until he was right in front of the door. It was slightly ajar, Tony smirked to himself as he pushed it open, but was stopped dead in his tracks by what he saw.
"What I want to know is who the hell sent him on a mission with this thing on?" The final bead finally popped out and Tony's shoulders sagged. "Done. Get me some wipes so I can clean him up."
Steve stared at Bucky, at first not understanding the significance until he replayed Buck's words in his mind. He gasped and his eyes widened in fear at the name Stark. "No. No, no, no ... Buck, I can't!"
Tony moaned as Steve kissed around his hole before plunging his tongue inside. "Steve."
Bucky kept watch over Steve until he settled into a peaceful sleep once again. He hoped with everything in him that Bruce was right and Steve would wake soon. He needed to know his best friend was going to be alright.
"You want me?"
"Hey, you okay?"
Tony closed his eyes and sighed. "I really do need to finish last-minute tweaks to the arm, but if I head down to the lab now I can probably have it done by six."
"Nah, it's probably better if I do this myself."
"Miss you more." Tony breathed as Steve's lips met his. The kiss didn't last nearly long enough for Tony. "Stay safe. Come back to me."
Henderson stopped Steve with a tight grip to the back of his neck the moment they left Phillips' office. "You will follow six steps behind me. Keep your gaze on the ground. Don't talk to anyone. The moment we are in my quarters you will strip and kneel. Any deviation from these orders will result in swift and severe punishment. Am I understood?"
"And what about Captain Rogers?" Howard asked.
"Sir, I'm fine. I'm leveled out. I don't need to go down." Steve finally managed to get a word in. Besides, he didn't
"I can't stay, and neither can you, Tony. We need to leave as soon as possible. A quinjet is already inbound."
"I have attempted to access the compound on multiple occasions with no success, Sir." Jarvis replied and Tony recognized the hint of frustration in his AI's voice.
Tony shrugged before slipping on his pants, both going commando underneath as neither planned to leave their rooms any time soon.
"Yeah, well, I'm just ready to be home now."
So sorry about the delay in updates. I started a new job and it's cut into my writing time.
"Wonderful. I look forward to having you home soon."
"Levels are holding steady, I think." Pepper bit her lip as she watched the information on the holo screen. She was always happy to help Tony when he needed it, but this really was out of her depth.
Nodding, Steve rounded the large island and opened the fridge, his eyes widening at the contents.
"You the guys from Washington?" The man with the light asked.
"I'm afraid so. This could have done some serious damage. Jarvis, give me a scan. I don't want to take this out until I know how bad it is."
"Yes, Sir."
Nodding, Bruce strode from the room.
Leaning his shield against the wall by their bed, Steve shook his head. "I just don't get it."
"Who is the president?"
"Neither do I." Tony beamed when Steve met his gaze and realized Tony was talking about him. "Come on, let's eat."
"Hey, Dad." Tony hid behind his mug of coffee.
Noting the emotion in Bucky's eyes, Tony cleared his throat. "Right, well, we need to take a few measurements and run a couple of tests before I can build your actual arm. Dr. Strange will be here in about thirty minutes to walk you through his end of things. Shall we get started?"
"Excuse me?" Something wasn't adding up for Bruce. But then he remembered the history of Captain America and realized they couldn't be talking about the same Stark. "Are you referring to Howard Stark?"
"This is your one and only warning to behave yourself," Henderson growled, tightening his grip.
Natasha looked to the group. "Bruce, over here."
"Something like that never really leaves you. Have you told Tony?"
"That's the hope. But we aren't making any promises. At the very least, it will respond to your commands and move like your right arm." Howard smiled, thrilled at Bucky's reaction to the limb.
Tony nodded. "It's been itching, and the grey is lightening."
This room contained a large bed, although slightly smaller than the other bedroom, and was decorated in warmer colors than it's counterpart on the other side of the floor. The bathroom was painted in a soft blue and contained another large tub and shower. Off the back of this bathroom, however, they found a room with a massage table and shelves stocked with every imaginable oil.
"I'm going to head up to the penthouse. I think I need to sleep again. Been what ..."
"Yes! Please yes." Tony clenched around Steve.
"The mission?" Clint asked as he tossed blueberries into the air and catching them in his mouth.
"Wait patiently."
"Stark Tower is about to become a beacon of self-sustaining clean energy."
Once clean, Steve shut off the water and toweled dry before slipping into the extremely soft black pants which waited for him. Although the shirt was a bit snug, Steve found it to be most comfortable. Once dressed, and mostly clear-headed now, Steve peered at himself in the mirror before heading out in search of Bucky who still sat in the living room.
His limbs loose, his mind calm, and his head floating, Steve barely heard the command. When it was repeated his eyes open and he peered up at Bucky who gazed back at him with a wide smile.
Tony rubbed his eyes and yawned. "Well, guess I can't chat with him today. When he's available, send him a message that I need to meet with him for a bit and get the cast done. Sooner rather than later. Once I get it I can have his arm done in a day."
"Yeah, Buck. It's not like we're living in the same apartment, again."
"I thought about getting someone from Sub Search, but I just don't feel like dealing with it tonight," Tony admitted. He wanted a nice, simple evening at home. Although doing a scene with a sub could be relaxing, he didn't really want to deal with all the negotiations that came with it tonight. Plus, he was feeling fine.
Finding towels folded on the countertop with a change of clothes, and the shower fully stocked with toiletries, Steve turned on the water to warm up before seeking out the shaving kit. He took his time, relishing in the seemingly endless hot water as it massaged his muscles, relaxing him even more if that was even possible.
"Ah!" Steve cried out as Henderson bottomed out in his ass.
"Yes, please!" Tony cried out. "Come on, Steve. Almost there. Please. Ah!!!" Tony's body shuddered as his cum splattered against the stone of the bench. His ass clenched around Stevie as his body shook with the force of his release.
When they reached the common floor, Bucky turned to Steve before stopping out. "He's not going to love you any less, or see you any differently."
"Yep." Tony sighed and turned to face Pepper, hand buried deep in his pockets.
Howard scrutinized the mark. It was an 'S' in a script and the tail wound around the letter to form a circle. "Yes. He put this on several of his early inventions before he developed the Stark Industries logo."
"Yes, Sir."
"Of course, Sir." The windows immediately blacked out and the lock on the door engaged with an audible click.
"It was my pleasure. I'll see you two around."
For the first time since Bucky arrived in the room, Steve noted the man's empty sleeve. "Buck, what happened?"
Approaching the open elevator, Tony chuckled. "Take me home, J."
"Well, at least one of them is. Must be the ice." Bruce knelt beside them and scrutinized the ice around them. "We need to get them out of here and warmed up."
"She also tell you what we found yesterday?" Steve dropped to a bench and wiped the sweat off his face with a towel.
Steve blinked his eyes open at the soft command. With more effort than it should have taken, he released his death-grip on the blanket, burying his face into the thin pillow and trying to suppress a groan of pain.
"Oh, God. Here I come." Stark shoved his cock down Steve's throat one last time as his cum flooded the sub's throat. He leaned over Steve and moaned in pleasure as he orgasmed.
Tony peered off into the corner of his lab for a long moment as he considered his answer. "Truthfully, no. If Rogers wants to share, he should be allowed to do so in his own time and with whomever he trusts. I can't assume he would want me to know, especially with me being related to one of his tormentors."
Coming to the end of the hall, Bucky pushed open the door to the last room and stepped inside.
As with the other bedroom, there were two walk-in closets. However, instead of a third storage closet, they found a room with a lower ceiling which was stocked with all manner of soft blankets, fluffy pillows, and had the softest of carpets as its floor.
"Was about two blocks from home when I was pulled into an alley. Couple a guys grabbed me, put a bag over my head, tied my hands, and tossed me into a van. Was little then, tried to fight back but there were too many of them. They were too strong." Steve turned away from Tony, looking to the corner where Dummy and U were docked and charging. "When the bag came off we were in a warehouse. There were about a dozen or so other people there. They were bringing in people off the street, checking to see who was a virgin and who wasn't. Those that weren't, well, the guys were sampling the merchandise. We were kept in dog cages until they were ready to load us up."
"What's wrong? Is it your arm?" Steve sat, his expression worried.
"Thanks, Pal." Bucky stepped through the open door and stopped a few steps into the apartment.
"Everyone, suite up!"
for a mission behind enemy lines is a good idea?!"
Clint landed the jet smoothly and shut it down as the ramp lowered. Steve sighed as he stood, lifted his shield from where it was propped against the seat next to him and turned toward the exit. The familiar form of Tony waiting for him at the end of the ramp brought a hint of a smile to his face.
"We'll find them, Steve." Natasha squeezed Steve's shoulder before following Clint to the jet.
"Let's just see what we find, shall we?" Tony clipped onto the line which would lower them into the belly of the beast.
"Hey, let's get you showered and relaxed. I'll check in with her in a couple of hours and help if they need me. For now, though, how about a shower?"
"This is urgent," Coulson explained.
"Thanks for coming by." Howard shook Strange's hand.
"Stark, the belt?" Henderson knelt beside Steve with a gleam in his eye.
"I won't say a word, but it would probably be best if he hears it sooner rather than later." Bruce pointed out. "Tony is arranging accommodations for you both. You will have an entire floor of the tower to yourselves for the foreseeable future. He figured you'd rather stay out of the public eye for a while. At least until you get acclimated to this century."
"Widow, Hawkeye, we've got incoming," Tony reported over the comms moments before gunfire erupted.
"Sergeant Barnes, come on in." Howard strode forward and offered his hand. "I'm Howard Stark Jr. It's a pleasure to meet you."
"Everything you should need has already been delivered to your private quarters. If you find you are lacking anything, prepare me a list and I will acquire whatever you need."
"Maybe give them a couple of hours. You resemble Pops the least, so Bucky may be okay with you going in there to get the cast done. Coordinate with Bruce, maybe you can do it while Rogers is sleeping."
"Anything yet?" Clint perched on the counter beside Natasha as she peered at a tablet and sipped coffee.
We first find our boys right after Captain America returns to camp with the 107th.
Deciding there was no other way to broach the subject, Bucky chose to simply rip off the bandaid so to speak. "Steve, we were frozen in the Valkarie for seventy years."
Tony's arms wrapped around Steve's waist, pulling him even closer against his body. When Steve pulled away to suck in a breath, Tony whispered in his ear, "Let's go. I can be late."
"Steve, if you don't finish what you started, so help me I'll ... Oh!"
"I'm glad you trust me. This doesn't change how much I love you." Tony stood and held out his hand. "Shall we call the team in? Make a plan to bring in these bastards?"
"What about off the books?" Tony walked over to the worn couch and dropped into the corner.
"What? I wanted to treat you. I'm allowed aren't I?" Tony grabbed his hand and pulled him towards the couch.
Steve thrust back into Tony. Hoping he could bring Tony to orgasm quickly so as not to leave him hanging.
Steve closed his eyes and drew in several deep breaths to help calm his racing heart. "No, I'm fine."
"Better than I have in ages. Thank you."
Agreeing, Bucky shut the bathroom door and slipped out of the hospital gown. When he slipped under the hot spray, he sighed.
"The late Howard Stark began a search for the Valkyrie beginning the moment the war ended. When he passed away, his son, who helped found SHIELD, increased the efforts with their help. The Valkyrie was found due to a shift in the ice which uncovered a wing."
"Why do you ask?" Howard leaned against the counter and eyed his son.
"It just doesn't sit right with me. We're missing something and my gut is telling me it's a critical piece of information."
"The laptop which Miss Romanov retrieved automatically connects to a satellite. This feeds information to what appears to be their main hub of operations. It is well encrypted and the signal difficult to trace. Although, I have made significant progress since it was brought in."
"Tony." Steve groaned, wanting nothing more than to finish, but also struggling not to immediately respond to a call to assemble.
"No, we aren't playing that game, Stevie." Bucky tapped the bottom of Steve's chin, a gesture which had Steve returning his attention to Bucky instead of the soft fibers of the blanket he sat on. "I won't let anyone hurt you. This is the safest place we can be right now. No one knows we're here except for a handful of people. We can keep it that way as long as we want until we're ready to face this crazy world we're now in."
Heading back down the hall, and through the living room, Bucky led Steve the second hall. They found another bathroom, and another room which Bucky suspected would be another office. He pushed the door opened and stepped inside.
"Could be." Bruce stood, stretched, and yawned. "When you figure it out, can you send me the files? I'll deliver then to the guys next time I check in on them."
"No, but he's not a Dom. Will he be able to help Rogers?"
"Well then, help me up so I can go over there. Maybe I can coax him back to the land of the living."
"They could be better. He's going to have to go down in the next couple of days."
"God, he feels so good!" Phillips began to thrust into Steve's mouth, slowly forcing the sub to take him deeper with each movement.
"He's been working overtime on Sergeant Barnes' prosthetic."
"You are cleared to leave whenever you're ready. Just head out to the elevator at the end of the hall and ask Jarvis to take you up. I'll see you in a couple of days to ensure you're both doing well."
in the medial realm, but they had yet to decipher what exactly what. Natasha was working with Bruce and Jarvis to upload all the electronic files on the premises to the secure Avengers servers, but they weren't hopeful. There didn't seem to be much to go on. Clint was doing a final sweep of the compound. They found a whole building with cells in them. Evidence indicated several women were kept in each, but there was no sign of anyone in the entire compound.
"Hey, let me know when they're an hour out. I wanna freshen up for Steve."
Steve watched as Tony pulled his pants down over his hips and to the floor. He stepped out of them and his breath caught in his throat as Tony kissed the head of his cock. His hands slid into Tony's hair as he sighed. "Tony."
"You're no help."
"Hey, Sarge, what's going on?" Gabe's gaze landed on the huddling form on the bed. "What the hell?"
"Pleasure to meet you, Bucky. This is my son, Tony. He's the mastermind behind the arm." Howard gestured to Tony.
"Come on, why don't you lay down and rest."
"Sir?" Steve came to parade rest, hands resting in the small of his back and feet shoulder-width apart, in front of Phillips' desk. "You wanted to see me?"
"I'm okay for a bit longer. Wanna hold you." Steve moved so both of them were under the spray of hot water and held his boyfriend close for several long minutes.
to fix the coffee pot on our floor," Tony muttered as he sunk into an empty seat, sighing in contentment at the first sip and Steve's presence at his side.
Bruce shrugged. "Still don't really get why I had to come with you all. It's not like we can't ID bodies back at base."
Once Steve was cleaned up, Bucky wrapped him in two blankets and settled him on the bed. It took quite a bit of time, and even more encouraging, to get Steve to eat or drink anything. Finally, Bucky settled in behind Steve, wrapped his arms around him, and pulled him close.
Tony couldn't help but laugh with his dad at the admission. "So, you want to help me melt this thing down? I don't suspect Rogers will ever want to see it again."
"You want to know what I love most about him?" Henderson paused for effect as he lifted the first item from the table. "No matter what we do to him, no one will know because of how quickly he heals. He takes everything so well."
"Working on it," Tony growled before claiming Steve's lips again.
Half an hour later, Barnes was wheeled into the surgical suite.
"That was the plan." Tony beamed as he met Steve's gaze.
"Come here."
"Wonderful. Well, it's gotta come out." Tony detached the anal plug from the belt before pouring a generous amount of lube into his hand and spread it around the cock cage in the front before gently easing Rogers out of it. Once that was accomplished, he poured more lube into his hand and gently worked some around Rogers' hole. Grasping the plug with one hand, Tony pulled it out a small bit before covering the exposed part in a generous amount of lube. Slowly pushing it back in a couple of times go push the lube inside, Tony then pulled it out more. "Fuck!"
"I never thought I'd see a sub's den in my life," Bucky muttered.
When morning came, and the Doms were thoroughly fucked out, Steve was finally released from his bonds. He dropped to the floor, landing on his hands and knees. His whole body shook with exhaustion and the need for release.
Clint's laughter carried across the room to them as Steve carried Tony towards their room. "Why do they even bother getting out of bed."
He would never admit it to his father, and hoped he would be able to hide the fact, but he had been up all night. The calm he found while cooking with his mother completely gone upon his return to the penthouse. He had checked in on their guests through Jarvis and learned Rogers had been restless, most likely with nightmares. Tony had wanted nothing more than to go to medical and sit with the solder, to comfort him, but instead respected Barnes' wishes and steered clear. After an hour of pacing, while Jarvis had the surveillance from medical playing, he headed down to the floor where Rogers and Barnes would be moved once discharged from medical. The renovations had been completed two days prior, but Tony still walked through the entire apartment ensuring everything was in place. Once happy with the end result, Tony went to his lab and began upgrades on his Iron Man armor. He hadn't slept a wink.
Moments later Jarvis chimed into the room. "Any previous injuries have healed, however, there is a ninety percent chance he will tear when it's removed."
"The perfect specimen if I may say so myself." Stark walked over and stood between Steve's spread legs. His hands traveled up Steve's toned legs to his hole. "I can't wait to get in here. He's always so tight."
While Henderson and Stark spit-roasted Steve, Phillips took great pleasure in shocking Steve around his clamped nipples, along his arms and legs, but mostly along Steeve's cock, balls, and hole whenever Henderson pulled out for a fraction of a second. The electric shocks to his rim and inside his hole proved the most painful and would cause Steve to gag around the dick in his throat.
"Yeah." Steve dropped the armchair beside the bed and pulled his boots off.
Howard waited patiently, understanding his son would share his thoughts in due time.
"I'll check with Bucky, but that should be fine from our end."
Tony grasped Steve's hand and chuckled as his boyfriend pulled him tight to his chest, wrapped both arms around him, and kissed him deeply. He melted into the kiss.
"Hey, we're going to end this today. Put a stop to these guys' reign of terror. Then we can go home and you and Tony can start planning your happily ever after. Geez, Steve, if anyone deserves to be happy it's you."
"A chastity belt." Tony scrutinized the device before pulling out lockpicking tools.
Natasha shook her head, "Not yet. Jarvis estimates another thirty minutes."
"Did he wake up?"
"You always know just what to make me for dinner." Bucky lifted one of the pieces of grilled cheese and took a bite. "This is delicious. You did so well for me."
Bucky groaned as his left arm felt as if it were on fire. As he clawed his way to consciousness, he realized it couldn't be true. The guy with the red face blasted his arm off, then he and Steve went down into the icy ocean with the Valkyrie.
"God, Tony. You're so fucking tight!" Steve pulled out until just the head of his cock remained in Tony before plowing all the way back in, angling his hips to hit Tony's prostate. "Gonna fill you up. Maybe I'll even plug you so you remember who you belong to when you're in your meeting."
"Mr. Stark."
"This looks delicious."
Clint scanned the area with his bow in hand, covering his downed teammate and looking for any sign of their captain.
"Yeah, sure." Tony kept tying furiously, barely responding to Bruce.
"I may have been curious as to how the good Captain is doing." Tony finally admitted as he spin the image between them.
"When have you ever asked me to come see you when you're binge working?"
"Howard, how are you?"
After the commotion died down, Tony instructed Jarvis to order them a celebration breakfast, complete with bottles of champagne.
with it?"
"When did mom's name appear?" Tony asked.
The fact Stark included a den on their floor spoke volumes to Bucky as to the character of the man. "This will be your room, I think."
"I'm afraid not. You're in good hands now, though. Tony will make sure you get the best medical care Stark Industries has to offer."
"Yeah, yeah."
Heat coursed through Steve as he pulled back and made quick work of Tony's suit jacket, tie, and shirt. He draped them over the back of a nearby chair before turning back to Tony who had was pushing his pants and boxers down in one swift motion.
Stark repeated the motion three more times before Henderson pulled out of Steve's mouth. Drool dripped to the floor and Steve couched as he was finally able to draw in a full breath.
"Dad, what do you know about Grandpa's work with Captain America?"
Bucky led the way through the apartment as they explored. To the left was a short hallway. The first door was a large bathroom, and across the way was a laundry room. Beyond that there was an office with a large desk and several bookshelves.
"How is that possible? Where are we?" Steve asked again.
"Hey, Buck. Sam. Welcome back." Steve strode forward and pulled both into a quick hug as Tony went in search of coffee.
"Hey, stop for a second and listen to me." Bucky grasped Steve's hand and squeezed hard to regain Steve's attention. "Howard Stark is long dead. You don't' have to worry about him anymore.
"See, my heart knows that. My brain is sometimes slow on catching on though."
Tony nodded as he rubbed at his left wrist. "Want help?"
Tony began going through the lines of code, giving Jarvis more instruction as he worked.
"Where's Steve?!" Tony demanded over the comms.
"Tony, what's this?" Bruce had just stripped Steve of his wet uniform in order to dry and warm him more and was beyond surprised at what he found beneath it.
After perusing the contents of the pantry and refrigerator, Steve finally decided on comfort food. As he gathered the ingredients for several grilled cheese sandwiches, soft music began to play over speakers in the ceiling. Steve settled into his task. As the sandwiches cooked, he pulled out a tray and added sliced cucumbers, baby carrots, peeled orange slices, grapes, and cantaloupe. Once the sandwiches were perfectly cooked, he cut them into quarters and arranged them neatly beside the fruit and vegetables. He added two glasses and the pitcher of ice water he prepared with cucumber and lime slices as well as a couple of napkins and carried it to the living room where Bucky relaxed in front of the biggest television Steve had ever seen.
Ignoring the archer, Steve carried Tony to the elevator. Only when the doors closed behind them did either of them speak again.
"Hey, someone's gotta. 'Til the end of the line, Pal."
"He's fine for the most part. In shock, but that's to be expected. Barnes managed to get him to fall back asleep. I'm keeping him overnight for observation, but barring any unforeseen complications, they both can be released in the morning."
Henderson came to Steve's side and grasped his cock. Although Steve couldn't see his face, he knew Henderson was grinning as he squeezed Steve's cock painfully.
Down each side of the long room Steve stood in, there were medical exam tables, the ones with the stirrups that gave Steve the chills. There were several ultrasound machines parked along one wall, and beside each exam bed was a table laden with a multitude of medical exam tools.
Tony's stomach dropped as he suspected he knew where this story was going.
"Sarge? Captain Rogers?"
"Understandable." Tony shoved his hands into his pocket. "I can bring down the equipment down tonight. I have a meeting with R&D in the morning, but we can get started after lunch if that works for everyone."
"Guess it's a good thing their floor is ready." Tony peered into his lap and traced the faint outline of his soulmark that was slowly starting to appear. "How are his levels?"
"You are most welcome."
"So, do you think they've finally found Captain Rogers and Sergeant Barnes?" Banner wondered, looking from Tony to Coulson.
Steve's brow furrowed as Tony moved to sit up beside him, crossing his legs and scooting close until his knees touched Steve's side. "Tony?"
"Deal." Phillips accepted the clamps and pulled out of Steve's.
"Yes please!" Tony finally opened his eyes and met Steve's gaze.
"Got on a plane and headed west. Jarvis is tracking the flight and will let me know when he finds it."
"Perfect. We'll see you then."
Steve's eyes rounded as Tony opened the box. Nestled inside was the most gorgeous ring Steve had ever laid eyes on. It looked to be made of silver and gold marble inlaid with blue and red gemstones. Tears welled in his eyes as he met Tony's gaze. "You amazing, wonderful, kind, generous, loving man. Of course, the answer is yes. Three thousand times yes!"
"The people who saved us, one of them is the most brilliant engineer of this time. He's building me a robotic arm. One that I'll be able to move and feel with as if it were a real limb."
"Steve." Tony whimpered as Steve pulled the plug halfway out before sliding it back in with a quick thrust. "Ah!"
"Can we talk?" Steve's arms wrapped around Tony's waist.
Bruce chuckled at Tony and shook his head in amusement. "What did you need?"
"Alright. Let me know when you figure it out?"
Forcing himself to face the inevitable, Bucky opened his eyes and looked to where his left arm used to be. A small cry escaped.
A constant beeping reached his ears and it took him several minutes to realize it wasn't just one, but two machines making the sound. Understanding there was only one way to learn what was going on, Bucky slowly blinked his eyes open.
Howard noted his son now appeared exhausted and wanted to ask about it, but recognized Tony's demeanor indicated he wouldn't easily open up about whatever was bothering him. Choosing to table the conversation for later, he approached the open case and smiled at his son's work. "You realize this is supposed to just be a prototype, right?"
Two hours later they still hadn't found any sign of Steve.
Slowly pulling off Steve's cock, Tony released it and gazed up at Steve.
"What?"
Bucky nodded slowly.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Yeah." Steve settled beside Tony with a contented sigh.
Thank you all for your support of this fic. I hope you continue to enjoy the story.
Scrubbing his hair clean, Tony found he was looking forward to the evening with his parents. He always felt better after spending time in the kitchen with his mother and he was certain tonight would not be any different. As he replayed his conversation with his father, he laughed.
His heart dropped as Bucky spotted Steve, curled up under a thin blanket on his too-small bed. Steve's body trembled and Bucky heard him breathing erratically. Rushing to the bed, he dropped to a knee.
Tony detected a hint of a smile on his lover's face. "Just think, I'll be waiting for you when you get here. Still have all your cum in my ass from this morning, and this plug has been teasing my prostrate all day. I'm gonna need some amazing sex tonight."
"Sir, the Avengers are returning to the tower. ETA five hours."
"But this is
"It's a trap. Move back!" Bucky called as Steve began to backtrack.
"How come nobody spotted it before?" Clint asked.
"Yeah, well, this one's bigger than our entire apartment building ... gotta make sure you can find me."
"Love you too. Now go save the world, Captain."
Tossing the gloves to the trash, Howard gripped his son's shoulder. "There are several of his journals in storage. I've never had a reason, nor the desire to peruse them. I'm thinking maybe it's time."
"I'm sorry we couldn't sneak in a couple more days." The Commandos had begun taking extra time on their missions in order to give Steve a break from Henderson. Oftentimes they would be able to help Steve out by gently dropping him when they were in a safe location. However, due to their timetable, they were unable to do anything to help out this time.
"Thanks, Buck."
"What do you mean years?"
"That's what Bruce is here for. Positive ID and all that." Clint commented.
"Success." Bucky settled into the barstool on Natasha's right. "You guys?"
"You are the only person to access my personality code, Sir."
"Good. What do you want to do now?"
"May I?" Phillips held out a hand as he stood with his cock deep down Steve's throat again.
"Then yes, I agree to submit to the tests later this week." Steve slid off his bed and shoved his hands in his pockets. "Can we go now?"
"Where is Stark Sr?"
"It's my pleasure. If this procedure works as planned, we can help a
"What?" Bucky's brows furrowed in confusion.
"We're going. Wheels up in ten." Steve ordered. "Jarvis, send everything to my tablet. We need to develop a plan in the air."
"Thanks, Doc."
Steve used two fingers to catch some of the cum dripping from Tony's ass and used it to lube the plug. He then gently pressed it into Tony, pulling another moan of pleasure from him. "You know I'm going to have a hard time thinking about anything but your gorgeous ass now."
"Of course, Sir. Is there anything else?"
"Only once or twice." Tony peered up at Steve. "You're losing your mojo, Cap."
He toed off his shoes just inside his bedroom door and flopped face down into his pillow. He was asleep in moments.
"What?" Howard snagged a pair of gloves and slipped them on before lifting the device. "Wanna tell me why there was a chastity device in medical?"
The night before had been nothing but perfection. Sex in the shower, a delicious dinner watching the sunset over the city, cuddling with Steve, an accepted proposal, then more sex. The reaction from the team was the icing on the cake. All were ecstatic over their engagement which was a relief. Tony had been slightly worried over their reaction, all fears which had been unfounded.
"We've got o go wider on the public awareness campaign. You need to do some press. I'm in DC tomorrow, I'm working on the zoning for the next three buildings."
Tony stood with his hands in his pockets at the edge of the landing pad and tracked the quinjet's approach over New York City. Palming the small box in his pocket, and clenching on the plug he still wore from that morning, Tony hoped Steve would be pleased about his plans for the evening.
"Fuck!" Bucky lowered his head to Steve's bed.
"Of course they are. I was directly involved." Tony smirked.
Henderson slapped Steve on the back of his head. "Stop making excuses."
"May I suggest we keep any Starks away from Steve or me for a while? Stevie isn't going to handle being under a Stark's roof again very well."
After searching through a stack of cushions, Bucky moved one to the floor in front of the couch, then settled himself in the corner.
"Look at that." Stark shook his head in amazement. "He just keeps getting better and better."
Several moments later, Steve pulled out and helped Tony stand. "I don't know what I did to deserve you."
When Tony peered back at his workstation, he grinned. Of all the precious stones on his table, the cornflower blue sapphires and the rubies looked the most striking side by side. "Yep, this is perfect. J, let's get to work. I want this done before Steve gets home."
"No problem. Now go on, I bet you're looking forward to a hot shower."
"Needed to save you. Couldn't lose you." Steve muttered, tear-filled eyes fixed on Bucky.
"Thanks."
"So?" Bruce perched on the stool across the worktable from Tony.
"J?" Tony opened the wine and poured two glasses as the window in front of them turned opaque, giving them an unobstructed view of New York City at dusk.
Tony dug in his pocket for a toolbox slightly larger than the palm of his hand.
"I'm sure it won't be much longer." Bruce moved to check Steve's vitals as Bucky rubbed at his sleep-filled eyes. "Tony and Howard should be down in the next half hour to run your tests. You can take some time to freshen up if you want. I don't mind sitting with him."
"Geez, warn a person would ya!"
Tony pulled his phone out and scrolled through Twitter as the elevator took them from the Avenger's levels of the tower to the executive offices of Stark Industries. They were almost to the board room when Pepper's cell indicated a message. She paused and Tony, not wanting to face the demanding board alone paused to wait for her.
Hours later, Steve entered Henderson's quarters, stripped off and folded his uniform, and sank to his knees. He was already dreading tonight's session, and a quick glance around the room caused that feeling to increase. Based on the items laid out, it was going to be a long, painful night.
"Course you do. Tasha told me something was bothering you. Spit it out."
"I'll be waiting. Probably not very patiently though."
"What?!"
"Mmmm, morning Tony." Steve grinned as he lay his chin on Tony's shoulder. "How long until your meeting?"
"Pepper, you're killing me. The moment, remember?" Tony flew up the side of the tower to the landing pad. "Enjoy the moment."
Steve's gaze moved to the brunette at his bedside and his gaze began to clear. His voice was raw from disuse. But he managed a single word. "Bucky?"
"I like you already, Bruce. Now, can you tell me why he isn't awake and I am?"
Tony nodded. "Why would a Dom lock him up like that? Especially before a mission?"
"I assume. Light her up."
"Thanks, J."
"Women."
"Copy. Finish searching the grounds. Bucky and I are working through the basement now." Steve kicked in another door then followed Bucky inside, clearing the room easily.
"Steve, I need to clean you up." Bucky shifted Steve so he lay on his side, then climbed over him and knelt on the floor. Dipping a rag in the warm water, Bucky began to clean the blood and cum off of Steve's front. Although the lacerations were relatively shallow, there were a lot of them. As he worked, Bucky noted many of them were already healing and he couldn't help but wonder what all was affected when Steve went through the procedure.
Steve grasped Tony's hand and pulled him up before pushing him down onto the bed. Tony scooted up towards the headboard and Steve followed on his knees, his lips finding Tony's again, pushing his tongue into his lover's mouth as he covered Tony with his body.
"I shouldn't be surprised, but you continue to amaze me, Son."
"Been working on the prototype for Barnes' arm. I still have a few tweaks to it, but it'll be ready by tomorrow."
Howard and Maria continued their conversation as Howard rode the elevator to the garage. Both looked forward to an evening with Tony, something they didn't get to enjoy as often since Tony moved into Stark Tower upon his last college graduation.
Tony gasped as Steve pulled the plug out and set it on the shelf in the shower before plunging two fingers into Tony's hole.
Steve's eyes widened in shock as he pulled his soft blanket tighter around him. "Who found us?"
"What? Why?" Tony's brows furrowed at the serious expression on Coulson's face.
Bruce turned to the supply cabinet.
The sound of the doors locking echoed across the lab as the wall of windows turned black.
"We found the Valkyrie."
"Come on, give it to me."
The lights automatically came on, lighting up the large, open space. Steve stopped two steps behind him and gasped at the sight. Across from the door was what appeared to be the living room and through the glass wall, they had a clear view of New York City.
"Unknown. From what we can tell, there have been close to two hundred women brought through the last couple of months. We have no idea what they are doing with them while there, or where they're taking them when they're done with them. They typically stay about a week before some are shipped out."
"You keeping them from doing a backtrace?"
"Yes, but I didn't say what building we are in." Recognizing he could put it off no longer, Bucky blurted out, "We are in Stark Industries' headquarters."
"I'm sure your mother will appreciate it, Sir."
Tony headed for the elevator and yawned again as it lifted him to his apartment. He went through the motions of readying for bed on autopilot.
"Thanks, Bruce." Tony dropped the belt into a trash bag and left the room. As the Dom made his way to his lab to dispose of the trash, his heart ached for the young man on the table. As a Dom he would never expect his subs to wear a device such as the one Rogers was locked into. But, he was also aware that not all Doms viewed their subs the same way he did.
"Thanks, Jarvis." Steve tossed the dirty towel into the basket before taking the offered sleep pants from Tony. "You were prepared."
"Can you imagine what the world is going to say when they find the Dom who essentially put an end to World War Two?" Their driver commented. "I mean, I know I've looked up to the man since I was a kid. Always wanted to be as strong as him. Books say he's the highest Dom on the charts, in the history of ... like ... ever!"
"What if they're in there?" Natasha met Clint's gaze.
"Here." Bruce handed over a large bottle of lube. "Is that what I think it is?"
"Of course, Sir."
"J, can you get in." Tony didn't like the thought of innocent women being harmed.
Striding to the table that held the supersoldier, Tony's eyes bugged out. "Jarvis, lock the room."
"His son, Howard Junior, took over his father's company, and
Steve sniffled, "I can't wait to meet them, Buck."
When they reached his penthouse apartment, Tony headed for his fridge and a cold soda. He hoped his father didn't notice his trembling hands.
"Found Bucky." Natasha dropped to a knee beside her boyfriend, helping him sit against the wall.
His breath coming in short gasps at the sensation of Tony's warm mouth on him, Steve forced words out. "Tony. Bed. Now."
“You shoulda,” Steve huffed, his eyes closed. Tony laughed.
“Honestly Nat I know you know it’s against code-”
“I gotta stay healthy, Tones.” Steve had taken to calling him that. It made him laugh, a nickname of his nickname. “I wouldn’t be able to sleep anyway.” he added, a little less cheerily.
After finding Natasha a towel, he ushered her into he kitchen and shut the door quietly.
He’d been this way he was since the beginning. Since he was a kid. The first time had actually been an accident. He’d been pinned on the ground, a bigger kid leaning over him, hitting him relentlessly. Until Steve had  grabbed a rock and broke his skull. For the first time in his whole life he’d felt powerful, he’d felt in control. For the first time the anger and the pain that always, always simmered just under the surface of his mind was gone, and he was free from it. The feeling was addicting.
“ I went to the boxing gym last night. The other guy won.” He said, offering her a smile she didn’t return. She simply stared at him, as if she were deciding whether or not he was telling the truth.
“You worried he’s got his hands on her behind your back?” She asked. Steve could hear the humor in her voice, though he couldn’t find it himself. He didn’t like that thought. He didn’t like that thought one bit.
“I thought you lost this number, Rogers.” Her voice was somehow smooth and crisp at the same time, washing over him from the phone's speaker. He straightened out the sheets so there wouldn’t be any wrinkles.
Tony didn’t have to wonder long how he’d do it, however. Because when he finally made his way through their quiet apartment and into the bedroom, that lights were already on.
Steve woke with a gasp, wincing at the pain in his shoulder. He’d woken and slept three times, but without being able to see if it was day or night that didn’t mean anything. It was long enough for infection to set in his shoulder. The skin around the wound was hot and reddened. He’d flushed the wound out with water from the tank of the toilet situated in the corner of the room. For the first time in a long time he thought he might have a fever. It was hard, but he paced the length of the room to keep himself awake. He genuinely wasn’t sure how or if the serum would react to infection. It was nothing he'd had to worry about since the war. Tf something wasn’t done soon…
“I did it because I wanted to,” Steve grit out, grabbing Tony and rolling them over, so Tony’s head was bracketed with his arms.
“You know what else?” Steve asked, smiling. Tony didn’t have to see him to know that he was. It was a smile that came out in his voice.
When the doors opened to the penthouse, Steve stepped out quietly. Tony was sitting at the kitchen counter, still dressed up in his suit and pouring over files.
“Bullshit, you’re always hungry, you eat more than any person I’ve ever met in my life.” Obviously, it was the wrong thing to say, because Steve seemed to sink back into himself, almost like he wasn’t even present. “ Hey, no, Steve-I didn’t mean it…” He wasn’t exactly sure what to say, he had no clue what was going on in Steve’s head.
"I don't. I haven't asked. She's already confused enough, I don't want to make it worse." Tony said, looking down at Morgan where she slept on the couch.
“No-I mean yeah,” Tony stuttered, shifting to sit up fully, feeling more of Steve drip out of him as he did so. “But I also mean like-“ Tony paused, struggling with words, waiting for Steve to fill in the blanks.
“Steve it looks like he beat the shit out of you, your eye-.” Tony said getting up and lightly grabbing Steve’s face, turning it from side to side, inspecting him .
“The tests are good.” Tony echoed, turning off the intercom.
“It’s okay, I got ya,” Tony said, holding a crying Morgan in his arms. It’s been three days, and she was still dreaming about the ‘bad men’. Tony decided he was going to get to the bottom of it once and for all. He remembered how slowly things had come back to him, mostly in dreams. He remembered his own terror, and his heart aced for her.
"It breaks every rule in the book." She said carefully. "Observation is one thing, contact is another."
“Why?” Steve repeated, hoisting the guy up, forcing him to stand at the ledge. The guy fought him, tried to get away. Steve kind of liked it when they did that.  It was to no avail. Steve was bigger and stronger, and the guy wasn’t going to go anywhere unless steve wanted him to.
"Asking me to do what?" he asked, suspicion creeping into him now. "What're you talking about?"
Steve was shaking too, by time those twelve blocks were up. He was worrying the Kid now, her anxiety shot up through him, he had to let go of her hand.
Tony just smirked and kept walking.
Steve struggled once more against the restraints. This wasn’t normal, was it? The restraints weren’t anything special. They were simply straps. He should be able to free himself—but even every ounce of strength he had wasn’t enough. What was happening?
“What do you think they’ll do to her? For earlier I mean. There’s got to be consequences-“ Tony stopped talking, movement in the cell in front of them distracting him. The kid was sitting up, looking dead at them.
Which would be soon. Steve grunted as Tony took both nipples between his fingers, rolling them between thumb and forefinger. Steve’s hips actually lifted up off the bed, which Tony found to be incredibly hot, seeing as he totally thought he had Steve pinned.
When Steve pulled away, Tony had to catch his breath.
The Kid was asleep on the floor in the closet. Steve had taken a few spare comforters from the linen closet and set them up for her, attempting to gradually get her used to sleeping in a bed. Bruce said it wasn't good for either of them, but if he was honest he couldn't sleep in the bed either. In the room. There was too much space. It wasn't even his room. The one he'd had when he'd moved in hadn't been used by him in years even before he went on that mission, and belonged to someone called Peter Steve had yet to meet. Clearly couldn't go back to the one he'd shared with Tony. So he was in a guest room, on the floor of the walk in closet, his knees pulled to his chest, waiting for the familiar sounds of the little girl's snores before getting up.
“ Dad it was an accident-she spilled her milk, she’s just a -” Steve’s breath caught as he heard a loud slap. Moments later a kid, he looked to be about sixteen,  exited the building, holding the side of his face. He was trailed be a little girl who had to be no older than six, she was crying, and Steve’s heart broke. He started running again, almost wishing he hadn’t stopped.
Yes, this was going to work. Perfectly. Now all he had to do was spend the night with Tony.
“You are literally the healthiest person I know, I don’t-” Steve cut him off by flopping on the bed, his big solid body pinning him down and effectively shutting him up.
“Fine. What about you?” Steve asked, dropping the towel and very purposely bending down to open his drawer of the dresser for a pair of sweatpants. Even from where he sat Tony could tell he’d still be lose. He'd be able to just slide right in and make Steve come all over again, ruining the open drawer or clean clothes. The thought made his dick throb.
It took him forty five minutes to locate Natasha, which meant she was in a mood to be located. He cradled the phone between his ear and shoulder as he made his and Tony’s bed, listening to the dial tone, knowing she’d pick up.
“Jesus fuck if you don’t get inside me-“ Steve cut Tony off with a kiss.
There was an achingly long moment of silence.
“Why don’t you take care of it yourself?” Natasha asked, she didn’t sound hesitant. Simply curious. Steve scoffed.
Tonight was going to be terrible.
“Ten thousand should be enough to get the lights back on, right?” That was really all it took. Barns snatched the money from her wordlessly, opened the envelope and looked through it.
"NO!" Steve gasped for air as his heart clenched.
"Yeah, well, I knew you'd pull me back in." Bucky wouldn't admit he had been terrified he would fall into the ravine below the tracks. "But let's not dwell on what could have been."
Steve nodded and peered at his feet. "Remember two summers before you shipped out?"
Maneuvering his way through the city, Tony reported in. "Good to go on this end. The rest is up to you."
"Of course, Sergeant Barnes. I have placed the floor on lockdown which can only be lifted by yourself or Captain Rogers."
"You can really make this so I can
"Jarvis?" Steve whispered when he couldn't take the silence any longer.
"I'd like to check your heart, lungs, reflexes, and draw some blood to ensure all your levels are within the optimal range."
Tony wasn't surprised when an hour later Steve called. "Hello, Captain Sexypants."
"Try and get some rest, Bucky. You need to heal too."
"Tony." Steve whispered, his eyes glistening with unshed tears.
Bruce realized he should have explained things a bit more. "You and Captain Rogers were frozen in the ice for almost seventy years, Sergeant Barnes. It's 2012."
son is the one who designed and built this tower. He lives in the penthouse. He is also the one who is building me my new arm." Releasing some of the pressure on Steve's hand, Bucky rubbed Steve's arm in a comforting gesture. "Tony is kind, and generous, and has promised not to set foot in our apartment, or to even introduce himself to you without your express permission and only after we have settled in."
"You probably should."
Glancing at his watch, Tony sighed. "Forty minutes."
Bucky leaned against a pillar beside the bench and crossed his arms over his chest. "Yeah."
"Tsk, tsk." Stark shook his head as he stood at Steve's head. "You're supposed to remain silent." Stark pressed into Steve's throat with one snap of his hips, grinning when Steve gagged.
Bucky's head snapped to the door of the tent as Gabe's voice reached him. "Who all is there?"
"Alright."
"What would you like to view, Sergeant?"
After several long moments, Tony lifted the chastity belt and gestured to the locking mechanism. "Is this Grandpop's?"
A couple of things:
"You alright?" Bucky bumped Steve's shoulder.
Tony shed his clothes and tossed them into the dirty clothes basket as soon as he entered the bathroom. Facing the shower, Tony froze and simply stared through the glass. Steve stood below the hot stream of water, hands braced on the wall and head under the spray. "God, you're gorgeous!"
"So that's why these abductions are getting under your skin." Tony released Steve's hands so he could wrap him up in a tight hug. He swallowed and blinked hard to keep the tears at bay. "We're going to find them. I promise."
"I've emptied this room." Bruce gestured to the room directly across the hall from the soldiers. "I'll sit with the captain in case he wakes while Barnes is with you. If that happens, be forewarned he will ditch you to be at Rogers' side."
"No change. His vitals are all normal, he doesn't seem to be in any pain, and all of Jarvis' scans are coming back with normal results. The best I can guess ..." Bruce shrugged. "He's just not ready to wake up yet."
"I really think you should stay in bed, Sergeant."
Bruce nodded, thankful Tony came to the conclusion on his own. "About that. Bucky asked us to look into what happened to Colonel Phillips and a man named Henderson. Apparently, it's important to Rogers."
"Gotta make this go down." Henderson slapped Steve's unwanted erection.
"Seeing that facility, just brought it all back." Steve swallowed hard before lifting his gaze to Bucky. "I thought I was over it ..."
Steve's eyes fluttered back closed at the praise as the rest of the tension drained from his previously tense muscles.
Tony wrapped his legs around Steve's waist then leaned up enough to kiss him. "I love you in me. So full, so perfect."
"No, and that worries me."
When Tony finished drying him, Steve grabbed a towel and smiled. "Your turn." He ran the towel over Tony's back and down to his legs before placing his hands on Tony's hips and turning him around. He then started at Tony's feet and worked his way up, placing a kiss on the head of Tony's cock after gently drying him, then up his chest. Finishing off with a long, deep kiss on the lips.
"Might I suggest the Andy Griffith show?"
- Howard and Maria Stark are alive.
Steve sighed in contentment as Tony lovingly washed him. He would never tire of Tony touching every inch of him, and getting to do the same in return.
Tony rolled his eyes. "Grow a spine, Jarvis."
"Thanks, Pep."
"Maybe it's Henderson."
Steve slapped Tony's ass. "Come on. We better go before Natasha comes looking for us."
The massive television on the wall came to life, and Bucky was quickly drawn into the show. The sounds of Steve working in the kitchen behind him soothing.
"I have
Strong, familiar arms wrapped around his waist as he waited. "Morning, handsome. I hope you slept well." Tony beamed as Steve pressed a kiss below his ear.
When Tony looked up, his brows rose in surprise. Before them was a huge piece of metal sticking out of the ice and a man was walking on top of it. Moving past that, he noted more of the red lights making an outline on the ice. He was baffled at just how large this place apparently was.
"Get a room, guys!" Natasha called from the couch.
"Doesn't mean I couldn't miss you. Honestly, knowing you were sitting back here in the tower, for
"Where to?"
"But, who then?"
"Yes, Bucky." Steve slowly stood and gathered the dirty dishes.
"Technically we already did," Steve smirked.
"Ah. Well, he can't touch either of you anymore."
Later that evening, Tony curled around Steve in their bed. It wasn't late, and neither was exceptionally tired, but Tony recognized Steve needed the comfort. Something about the mission still didn't sit right with Steve and was making him anxious.
"That woman deserves a raise," Tony muttered.
"Why don't you get him ready for me, Stark." Henderson clicked open the top of a bottle of lube.
"They're not to set foot inside that plane until we get there." Tony ordered.
"How long until we can start craning it out?" Coulson inquired as the approached what appeared to be a hill in the ice.
(See the end of the chapter for
Henderson allowed his gaze to linger on the Sub in the room. When Phillips told him he would become Captain America's Dom, he'd been elated. He finally had a chance to force the strongest Sub to submit. Something which would bring him immense pleasure in bragging about.
Glancing at his father, Tony stood and gestured for his father to follow him. "I just came from medical where I found this." Tony ripped open the bag and dumped the contents on the table.
"Perfect. I'll get everything set up and see you all tomorrow." Tony pushed off the wall and headed for the elevator.
He wondered how long the peace would last.
"They had to take the arm. There was too much damage."
"We've got something," Steve reported as Bucky moved into the space.
"Nope." Tony declared but wasn't able to keep the smug expression from his face. As he settled into his seat at the head of the conference table, he began designing his next project. He hoped he would have enough time to complete it before Steve returned from his mission.
"Yes." Bruce pulled back the curtain between the beds. "His vitals all look good, no lasting injuries. Any he
"Already done, Captain."
"Thanks, Jarvis." Tony sagged against the back wall of the elevator. He could guess who was waiting for him, only one other person had full access to his lab without going through Jarvis.
"Tunnels." Clint shook his head as he approached his teammates. "Buried deep under the kitchen. Only found it when I went in the basement and looked around more closely."
"An organization by the name Strategic Hazard Intervention Espionage Logistics Directorate, or SHIELD."
Once Steve was out of sight, and he heard the shower running, Tony dropped his gift for Steve in his nightstand drawer. "Jarvis, place the order for dinner and have it ready in an hour."
"How does it look?"
"I don't know what you're talking about." Tony tweaked Steve's nipples again, eliciting a moan of pleasure.
As it turned out, it didn't take five minutes. Three hard thrusts and Steve spilled into Tony which triggered Tony's own orgasm. Both lay there, wrapped in each other's arms, gasping for breath.
"So, Doc, can we blow this joint?" Steve resisted the urge to cross his fingers in hopes the answer would be yes. He didn't want to appear too eager, however, he hated being in any medical facility. Even if it were the nicest he'd ever seen, and the doctor was nothing but kind.
"Man, if the foyer is this big, I can't even begin to imagine the size of the apartment."
As the elevator began to rise the three floors, Tony leaned down and began to tease Steve's nipple with his mouth and tongue.
"God, Tony. So perfect, laid out and open for me." Steve lay his hand on Tony's knee and slid his hand up towards Tony's erection. "Beautiful."
Tony exited the elevator, case in hand, and strode directly for the room where they were going to do the scans and tests for Barnes' new arm. Setting the case on one of the tables, Tony headed for the coffee pot in the corner of the room, thankful someone brewed a pot. He sighed on the first swallow.
"But your arm ..."
Steve waved as he headed for the room filled to the brim with art supplies. It didn't take long to find a brand new sketchbook and a pack of pencils. Grabbing both he headed to the small sub den in his room. Closing the door behind him, and settling into the softest cushions Steve had ever seen along the back wall, Steve opened up to the first page and began to draw. He spent several hours in the corner of his den as images of the Howling Commandos, and Bucky filled the first several pages of his book. He couldn't remember the last time he was this relaxed and settled.
"Have a good evening, Son. Love you."
"Smartass." Bucky playfully shoved Steve's shoulder. "At least let the doc take a look at you."
"Couple days at most." Steve's right hand slid up Tony's side and caressed his cheek. "I'm going to miss you."
"You did so well for me, but now it's time to come back up. Do you think you can do that for me?"
Smiling, Steve stood, grasped his hard cock, and lined up. "No more waiting."
"I don't know, Dad. I've still got work to do."
Tony took in Steve's length, savoring the taste of pre-cum as his lover pushed into him. He could feel the head of Steve's cock in the back of his throat and he hummed in pleasure.
"Captain, I sense an abnormality in your heart rate. Do you require assistance?"
"Does he have anyone to take care of him?"
"I think you're overdressed." Tony eyed Steve's pants seductively. "Let me help."
!" Tony gestured angrily to the items now scattered across the top of his workbench. "I mean look at this, Dad. How the hell could anyone think locking him up in
"Yeah, but what about the women they've taken? Will we be in time to save them? Or are we already too late?"
"Yes, Sir," Steve growled before lowering his gaze to the floor. He didn't know what kind of punishment Henderson was considering, but Steve couldn't risk it being public in any way. Whatever was going to be done to him, he needed to keep it behind closed doors.
Before Bucky could ask about it, the elevator opened and Steve and Tony joined them in the communal kitchen. The expression on Steve's face a complete opposite from the previous day.
Natasha smiled as she spotted Bucky and Sam approaching from the elevator.
"Sorry. But you really do need to attend the board meeting. They almost walked out until I told them I'd come find you."
"What worries you?"
Steve swallowed hard, wishing it were that easy. Bucky's almost fall would certainly come up in the mission debrief with Carter and Phillips. Which meant Henderson was sure to punish him for not protecting his men.
Steve's eyes lit up as he poured lube into his hand. With one hand on Tony's knee, Steve reached down and circled Tony's hole before slowly pushing in.
"I should be asking you that. You're the one that hung off the side of a moving train." Steve clenched his fists at the mention of Bucky's close call with death.
"It's a perfect combination of both of us," Steve whispered as Tony slipped the ring on his finger.
After a long moment, Steve nodded.
"Guys, I found them." Bruce's calm voice came over the comms.
"Although I can't be sure, this may mean he is starting to wake. It may still be a while though, so please don't get your hopes up."
"Indeed, Sir."
The AI paused for a moment, long enough Steve began to wonder if he would get an answer.
They spent the next hour carefully extracting Rogers and Barnes from the ice. When they finally freed the men, Tony gasped at the sight of Barnes' left side. Most of his left arm was missing.
Knowing exactly what Steve needed at the moment, Bucky squared his shoulders and laced his next words with authority. "We're going to our apartment now. You're not going to say a word until I say otherwise. You will stay by my side, within touching distance, at all times and you will not speak unless spoken to. Am I understood?"
Sighing, Tony closed his eyes and forced himself to calm down. "I have one other question for you, well, two. For now anyway."
Clint, Natasha, and Bucky followed the tunnel to the end. When they came out the other side, there were tire tracks heading in both directions down the road. Tony and Sam followed the road in opposite directions, searching for their missing Captain.
"Everything alright, Son?" Howard Stark Jr. asked as he crossed the room with furrowed brows, not missing the bag on the table.
"Sir wishes for the residents to feel at home which can only happen when they have been assured of their privacy."
Bruce knelt to look over what he could see of the two men. Sergeant Barnes was laying on the ground and Captain Rogers was draped over his right side. Barnes' left side was buried under the ice so they could only see the right side of his face. It appeared as though Rogers was protecting Barnes as much as possible. "Tony, can you have Jarvis scan them? I just want to make sure nothing is going to blow up when we try and move them."
Before the war, Steve had heard of such a thing as a sub den but had never seen one before. They tended to be a space only the richest could afford seeing as they contained soft blankets and pillows with which a sub could build themselves a nest. The rooms were a safe haven for a sub. A Dom was not allowed to enter without the express permission from their sub, permission which must be granted each time.
The door at the end of the hall opened into a large master bedroom with a bathroom. The white tile brought plenty of light to the room and Bucky wondered who in the world would need such a large tub or a shower which could easily hold five grown adults and still have room. Back in the bedroom, they found two walk-in closets, as well as a third closet that could be used for storage.
Once Tony hit the button to brew more coffee, he turned back to the floating image in the center of his worktable. Bucky's arm would be a work of art when he was done with it. He got lost in his work and was surprised when Bruce appeared before him.
"We may never know the answer to those questions."
"No way!" Clint's eyes widened as he spotted the familiar red, white, and blue shield Captain America used. "Think they're still in here?"
Meeting Steve's gaze, Tony smirked. "Yes, Captain?"
Soft music began to play over the built-in speakers and the lights dimmed to fifty percent through the penthouse while Jarvis adjusted the thermostat to bring the temperature up a couple of degrees.
"Any idea what had Cap so out of sorts yesterday?"
"Good, I want you to take the dishes to the kitchen and wash them. You can have Jarvis walk you through using the dishwasher, or you may wash them by hand. You choose. Once you're done cleaning up, go shower, decide if you want to shave. I've been told everything you need will be in there. Once you're done in the bathroom, come find me."
Steve couldn't stop the blush which crept up. "Tony." He softly chided.
think I would let him near you if I didn't trust him?"
"Activate the 'Woo the Captain' protocol."
"Kneel up for me."
"Time to tell me what's bothering you." Bucky tossed Steve a bottle of water before opening one for himself.
"A whole floor? Geez, Stark." Bucky led the way to the door and placed his hand on the glowing square in the wall.
In response, Steve picked Tony up, his boyfriend wrapping his legs around his waist and his arms around his neck as their lips met.
"Tony, we're about to head out on a mission. Are you sure?"
"My name is Bruce Banner. I'm a doctor. Although, admittedly, not usually this kind of doctor."
Bucky stood and pulled Steve into a tight embrace. "I'm so happy for you, Stevie. You deserve all the happiness in the world."
Finally, the wide flat tip of the sound touched the head of Steve's cock. He would have sighed in relief if he could suck in air. Moments later, Henderson slipped a ring attached to the base of the sound around his cock, locking it into place. A cock ring soon followed, cluing him into the fact that he wouldn't be able to come for hours if Henderson got his way.
"As I said, I alone handled his care. Not everything made it into the file either. I figure he would rather be the one to decide if certain facts become known to the public." Bruce explained carefully, as he promised Tony he would.
"Come on, stop teasing me!" Tony cried as Steve hit his prostate again. "You've kept me waiting
"We're working with a neurosurgeon, Dr. Strange. Our goal is to integrate the arm into your nervous system so you can sense temperatures and touch with it." Tony met Bucky's gaze. "We want it to be as much like a real arm as is possible. After everything you've done to for our country, this is the least I can do for you."
With gentle hands, Bucky looked Steve over. Anger boiled inside him at what he found. "I'm gonna kill them."
Steve nodded then leaned his head against the wall as the elevator took him to Tony's lab.
Nodding, Tony turned to Pepper. "I gotta ..."
to go down for someone he didn't know, didn't trust. It was not only unpleasant but harmful to the sub as well. "Please, Sir!"
Tony lifted his hips slightly in invitation. "Less talking, more fucking."
"I'm not in." The last thing Tony wanted to deal with on a night where he should be celebrating, is the agency ruining things. "I'm actually out."
Bucky turned his steely blue eyes to Bruce. "It's not what he did to me, but what he did to Steve."
"It's me, Gabe. I've got Dum Dum, Falsworth, Morita, and Dernier with me. We wanted to take you guys out to celebrate."
Steve's cries of pain were fucked into him as Phillips shoved his cock down his throat, cutting off his air supply and pressing his balls to Steve's face. As Henderson let the sound slowly sink into Steve's cock, Phillips fucked his throat. The jarring sensation, along with the fire of the barely lubed sound sinking into him, brought tears to Steve's eyes.
"I'm going to stay here and watch a bit more television, then head to bed. If you need me, you know where to find me, right?"
Tony smiled softly at the joy on Rogers' face. He was still working on Bucky's arm when Jarvis asked him if he could answer Rogers' question about who found he and Barnes in the ice. Tony agreed without hesitation but then asked Jarvis to bring up the live feed from the soldier's room.
sorry for making Pepper come after him.
"Sergeant Barnes. Captain Rogers is awake." Jarvis' voice interrupted Tony.
Reaching the garage, Tony chose a more subtle car to drive to his parents. He didn't want anyone following him, or disrupting what was going to be an enjoyable, calming evening with his family. Pulling out of the garage, he turned in the direction of the mansion.
As Steve drifted off again, this time into a deep sleep, Bucky whispered into his ear. "It's going to be alright, Steve. You're going to be okay. I've got you."
Steve eyed the bed but didn't say a word. Although he wondered if it was as comfortable as it looked.
Bucky drew in a deep breath and sat up. He must've fallen asleep in the chair beside Steve's bed. His friend had been plagued with nightmares throughout the night so Bucky had come over to grasp his hand and offer what comfort he could.  He hadn't expected to fall asleep. "Yeah, long night."
Tony almost laughed at the tone of voice his AI used. Almost as if Jarvis was rolling his eyes at him.
Steve and Bucky walked side-by-side to the elevator.
Bruce turned to the cabinets on the wall to retrieve what was needed for the tests and pulled up Steve's medical record on his Stark tablet. He worked quietly as Bucky shared about his time since he awoke in an attempt to keep Steve at ease.
When they reached the elevator, the doors were open and waiting for them. "Jarvis, to our apartment please."
As they passed through the door, Steve drew in a deep breath to center himself. As the lock clicked behind him, Steve began to remove his uniform, folding and placing it neatly on a nearby chair. Once he stood completely naked, Steve swallowed hard and lowered to his knees.
"They're alright. Bucky is healing nicely. I spoke to him this morning about the possibility of a prosthetic. He was excited about the idea of a robotic arm." Bruce chuckled, remembering the excitement in Bucky's eyes as he explained what Tony and Howard wanted to attempt on his behalf. "You can start with whatever scans or molds you need when you're ready."
"Sir is in his lab."
When Steve pulled the door open, a tunnel was revealed with blinking lights. Both men picked up sound carrying.
"Let's do this." Bucky grinned as he met Steve's gaze."
"It was a bust. The place was cleaned out when we got there." Natasha frowned. "Something about it got to Steve though."
Although they found themselves in a time neither of them understood, in a place neither would have willingly gone in the past, Bucky felt a sense of home begin to settle in. It would take time, a lot of it, but he could see himself and Steve settling in nicely here.
"Hey." Steve dropped to the couch beside his best friend, noting the cushion had been put away while he was cleaning up.
"Sergeant Barnes is currently occupied with Captain Rogers, Sir."
Shifting in his seat, Tony's smile grew. He had spent the entire day thinking of Steve. The pressure in his ass from the plug every time he moved was a reminder of their morning together before Steve left, and something to look forward to when Steve arrived home. With a looming deadline, Tony shifted his attention back to his current project. One he hoped Steve would be excited about once he shared it.
"Yes ... no ... Kinda?" Tony moved around to the other side of the table. "This is a prototype. Had to make sure all the joints and everything would work right. We want it to be functional, but still light enough it's not going to put stress on your back or ribs so the final product will be made out of a different metal."
Steve stood and pulled Tony in with an arm around his waist. "Love you, Tony."
"What?"
Bucky allowed Steve several minutes to peruse the room, a small smile on his face. Tony would never understand what this room would come to mean to Steve.
Steve smiled, squeezed Tony's ass, and headed for his locker to gear up.
Henderson shoved his thick cock into Steve's hole in one sharp thrust. "By all means, enjoy yourself."
Sniffling, Steve lowered the blanket enough to peek at Bucky over the top.
"Yes. Please!" Tony kept his gaze locked with Steve, doing all in his power to keep his expression semi-neutral when Steve reached for the bedside stand.
Turning to Steve, Bucky held out his hand in invitation.
"Penthouse, J," Tony instructed before pulling Steve's shirt over his head.
Steve chuckled. "I don't know what I would do without you, Tony."
"Wonderful. I'll make sure we have the necessary ingredients. Do you think it will do the trick?"
Although Tony is normally one to chat away to avoid awkward silence, he senses Steve's need to speak in his own time. So, keeping his mouth shut, he grasped Steve's left hand and rubbed his thumb over Steve's ring.
Bucky took Steve's hand from Natasha and peered closely at the ring on his finger. "Steve?"
"Sure, let me just wrap up your shoulder. The stitches need to stay in for a couple more days." Bruce rummaged in a drawer for the needed supplies and quickly wrapped Bucky's shoulder. "I brought fresh clothes for you too."
"Bring up the surveillance. We need to see what's going on." Steve ordered and the map faded away as the pictures from the satellite appeared.
"Alright, J. Show me where we're at." Tony entered his lab with a flourish, still grinning from ear to ear.
Curious, Tony walked over and stood at Coulson's side.
"I love you." Steve pulled Tony close, wrapped his arms around him, and kissed his fiance.
"Sergeant Barnes seems to be assisting Captain Rogers into subspace."
Tony proceeded to gently clean Rogers up, then Bruce checked for tearing. Miraculously, there was only a small bit that appeared to already be healing, even if it would take some time.
"Need supplies, but I can't leave him."
"I'll always do my best." Steve kissed Tony once more. "I love you."
"They were wrong." Tony's gaze shifted back to Rogers. His body lay mostly naked on the table. "This, dear Brucie, is a classic example of a Dom exerting complete and overwhelming control over their sub."
Tony snorted. “ You know for that whole ‘apple pie’ thing you’ve got going on you’re pretty practiced in the smooth talking department.”
Their pace down the hall was slow. The Kid wasn't a strong mover, really. She'd lived her entire life in that cell. She'd never needed to be.
Not as stunned as he was, however, when Steve grabbed him in a loose hold and kissed him. Right there in the middle of the sidewalk.
“ They wanted me to obtain information.” Steve said slowly, swallowing thickly. “ They said ‘by any means possible’ and they told me to use torture as a tactic. I didn’t want to do that.” Of course Steve hadn’t wanted to do that, he was Steve, he was sweet, kind Steve. Tony was positive that outside of boxing, he wouldn’t hurt a fly.
“Tony didn’t tell you?” Steve asked, unable to help the edge to his voice. He knew for a fact Pepper didn’t like him. That she could read him like a book. It wasn’t every day he met people like that. The fact that she was one of Tony’s closest friends was nerve wracking, and Steve did his best to avoid her at all costs.
“I told you you were going to walk around all day with my come in your ass and that’s what you’re going to do,” Steve said, raising his brows matter of factly. “No one ever said I had to tell you when.”
“ I really need you to focus here, Steve.” Tony said, sounding like he was speaking carefully.
“ Don’t, Tony. You’ve got work to do. Don't even worry about it. I was thinking about making you dinner tonight though. To make up for last night.” Steve sat down in one of the chairs opposite Tony’s desk and Tony smiled.
“Dear, dear.” Maria murmured, wiping her sons tears. “I’ve missed you.”
He’d told her maybe a dozen times that they’d be found. He regretted each time more than the last. It’d been a long time. Long enough that his hair was beginning to creep over his ears. He never let it get that long anymore.  There was no guaranteeing what was going on out there. That the team even knew where he was. They were searching for him, they had to be, but he’d had people searching for him before, hadn’t he? They’d taken eighty years to find him then.
The man in the white coat shrugged his shoulders.
She simply stared at him blankly. He wasn’t sure why he was so disappointed. It was quiet for a long moment. She didn’t move her hand.
I don't know why, Kid. You'll have to ask someone..." Steve trailed off, words dying in his mouth. The Kid shifted in her chair to look behind her, matching Steve's line of sight. "Hi, Tony."
from that popsicle, but he was sucking hair, his cheeks hollowing. The sensation is new and confusing and exciting, it burned just under his skin and made him bite lip.
Steve made a noise that let Tony know he didn’t believe him, and Tony sighed, going back to his tablet.
Steve turned around to face him.
“I finished earlier than I thought I would. I’m glad you’re here already, I was afraid the food was gonna get cold.” Steve said, setting his stuff aside. The swelling in his face had definitely gone down, but the blue black discoloration was still there.
“You can’t just burst into someone’s place like that-”
“I know I didn’t have to do it,” Steve answered. Tony licked him again and again. Short, wet stripes with the tip of his tongue, just enough to feel good but not enough to satisfy. Steve’s face was red as a lobster.
"Yes, darling. I use it for special occasions. That's what it's there for."
Tony.
He hadn't seen her since he'd arrived. He'd been told she was off on a mission. He wondered if that had been the truth. By the surprise on her face, he figured that it was.
"You're making sandwiches!?"
"Hey," Steve said quietly, bumping Tony's shoulder with his own as he placed the roast beef meticulously on the bread. "I'm sorry. About the other week. The ring thing. That wasn't fair."
Things had been fine at first. Immediately SHIELD had been notified, at least as immediately as possible. Tony hadn’t been sure what to do with himself in the moment, and for a good forty-five minutes he paced around his workshop trying to ensure himself that he wasn’t actually truly lost his mind. He must’ve asked Jarvis a hundred times if Steve was actually standing in the communal kitchen barfing up two day old pizza. Tony supposed it had been Jarvis who’d notified Shield, because within the hour agents were crawling all over the building, and leading a withered Steve out of the building, the kid holding on to him so hard he was already bruising. Bruising! Tony’d seen the man thrown through entire buildings without acquiring a single bruise, but there he was, tiny finger prints pressed into the little meat he had on his shoulder. He looked like a skeleton walking.
When the food stopped coming, Steve released a long, contented sigh. Bucky ran his hand through Steve's hair again before gently guiding him to lay his head on Bucky's thigh. Settling into the new position, Steve continued to drift in rarely found subspace.
Steve laughed as he stood. "Thank you, Buck. For taking care of me."
Steve shrugged. "He still loves me."
"I can assure you I haven't shared the contents with anyone and will maintain confidentiality until you state otherwise. Only those approved by you will have access to them." Bruce locked his eyes with Steve. "Trust me when I tell you that I understand the need for privacy."
"I'll alert Stark Tower's medical bay we are on the way. They'll have a private wing and I'll have Happy bring in extra security." Tony's gaze stayed on Roger's frozen form. He felt drawn to the other man for some reason.
Tony glanced at the clock on the wall, noting he finished earlier than expected. "Looks like I have time to clean up."
"What?"
"Have you forgotten about Barnes already?"
Drawing in a shaky breath, Steve finally allowed his gaze to roam around the room. It was clear he lay in a hospital bed, the beeping machines, IV in his hand, and the scent of disinfectant indicated as much. But, there were also things he couldn't place. Many of the machines looked foreign to him. "Where are we."
"Steve!" Bucky rushed into the room and pulled his best friend into a hug.
Steve's forehead touched Tony's and he let out a frustrated laugh. "Just our luck."
"Touche."
"You can go down here. Be careful. Reports said there were explosives on board and we don't know how stable they'll be."
"Huh, Cap's finally going down. That's gotta be good for his levels."
"Hey, be kind to yourself, Buck. You're a good man, always have been, and she can see that."
"No."
Bucky pushed off the wall and dropped to a knee in front of Steve.
"There is still a lot we don't know about soulmates. But, we do know one doesn't gain a soulmark until their soulmate is born."
"And he loves you. Which is why you should share with him why you're struggling with this mission. He's worried about you, I can see it in his eyes."
"Now, I'm exhausted. Get out of here." Henderson slapped Steve's ass again before standing and turning away.
"Steve!" Tony's face lit up when he spotted his fiance standing just inside the door to his lab. Recognizing Steve's 'I need to talk' face, Tony instructed Jarvis to keep working, rounded the worktable, and moved across the lab to where Steve stood. "What's wrong, my love?"
A loud moan of pleasure ripped from Steve as he bottomed out and orgasmed. Both arms wrapped around Tony, holding him close as his body tremored with release.
"Hold on, Stark." Natasha barked as Bucky's gaze met hers.
Natasa sidled up to Steve. "There's nothing more we can do here, Steve. They're long gone."
"Yeah. Clint's pushing it to get back. I don't like the fact we couldn't do anything to help those women, and he knows it's put me in a bad mood."
Bucky blinked rapidly as he began to gain consciousness, the world around him slowly coming into focus.
"My thoughts exactly. Turns out the history books, and dear old Grandpop's stories are full of lies. Rogers isn't a Dom, he's a sub."
"Still no change. It seems as though he may be having a nightmare."
"What do you have?" Bruce approached, quickly spotting the ice-covered bodies on the ground.
"Wait, what signal?" Tony perched on a tall stool as holograms of Jarvis' progress popped up around him.
"You did, Buddy. You saved me and hundreds of others." Bucky carded his fingers through Steve's hair. When Steve melted into his touch, Bucky wanted to cry. "I'm going to take care of you, Stevie. You did good, real good. And now I'm going to take care of you until you're safe again. Okay?"
Coughing, the men only made it a few steps before Steve's knees gave out and he fell to the ground. Moments later his world went dark.
"Of course, Sir."
"Sir, Agent Coulson of SHIELD is on the line," JARVIS reported as the armor began to be stripped off TOny.
"No news. Something lighthearted."
keep me appraised of their condition and call me the moment they wake."
"I've got a door." Steve prepared to open the door as Bucky shifted his aim.
Bucky shook his head. "No. Wish he would though."
"Bring it up, let me at it. And quit sassing me."
"Jarvis, ask Bruce to come see me when he's done with Rogers." Tony drained his coffee and growled in frustration when he discovered his coffee machine was empty.
"I heard you tried to kill one of your men." Henderson moved further into the room and paused at a table where several items were laid out in preparation. "You know that sort of behavior must be punished."
"Sir is aware of Captain Rogers' artistic abilities and wanted to supply a room for him to use for such endeavors."
A fourth finger pressed into Steve, and Stark began to stimulate his prostate. A hand on his own cock a clear indication they wanted him aroused for whatever was to come next.
"Mind if I try out that new wand Stark made you?" Phillips lifted the small device from the table, amazed at what Howard made.
Bucky left Steve to his work, allowing him the chance to begin the slow slide into subspace. He snagged the folders off the counter and peered inside on his way to the couch, quickly closing them once he noted the contents and placed them on a shelf in the living room to show to Steve tomorrow. Today was for dropping Steve into subspace and allowing him to drift for a while. The files would do quite the opposite.
"Are you sure you want to know?"
"Alright." Bruce held his hands up in front of him, attempting to keep the man in his bed. "I'll help you, but you must stay in a wheelchair. You don't have the strength to be standing on your own as of yet and I'm willing to bed Rogers won't take too kindly to you being injured yet again on my watch."
"Jarvis?"
"Ok, Jarvis. Save everything and send a copy to Dad, Bruce, and Doctors Strange."
Only when Steve ended his third circuit of the room did Bucky reach out and grasp his arm. "Come on, let's check out the rest of the place. You can come back here later."
She answered on the second ring. "Hello?"
"I'm certain I don't know what you're talking about, Sir."
Steve glared at the man, allowing all his anger and frustration in the situation to be clear, even if only for a moment.
"It doesn't matter, because I still have you. Besides, I'm getting a new one anyway."
Once all five of them were on the ground, Coulson reported that they were in to those topside. Flipping on the high-powered flashlight, the deploying the small drone be brought so JARVIS could scan the structure, Tony began to look around.
Steve opened his eyes and peered up at Bucky, trusting him to know what he was thinking while he continued to follow the order for silence.
"'Til the end of the line. See ya tomorrow."
"I hope so. It's killing me knowing there is someone out there for me and not knowing who they are."
"Look at this, Phillips. He's taking my whole hand." Stark marveled, watching his arm disappear into Steve's ass.
"But I've been sleeping for seventy years." Steve pinned Bucky with his gaze, a hint of a smile on his face despite the multitude of emotions.
"So what you're telling me is that it might be another three months before I learn for sure who my soulmate is?"
"You're not playing fair."
Pausing in his pacing, Steve met Bucky's gaze. "Yeah. I spoke to Tony."
Blowing out a breath, Tony decided to just spit it out. "I took that off Captain America."
When they entered the living room, Steve stopped and peered at the coffee table. It was set with two covered dishes, a large bowl of salad, a basket of rolls, a bottle of their favorite wine, and two large pieces of chocolate cake. "Tony?"
"Get your ass in here and shut the flap. Have everyone else stand guard outside. No one comes near here." Bucky ordered, his gaze shifting back to Steve who whimpered below him.
"Scan complete." The door before them opened. "When you're ready to set your security protocols, I will be happy to assist."
"Jarvis, tell Tony this is perfect, and thank you."
"Care to stop beating around the bush and just spit it out?" Howard joined his son, resting his elbows on his knees as he peered at Tony. "Look, I know you found Barnes and Rogers. You had Jarvis call, as well as send me his and James Barnes' medical records after all."
Steve cried out around Henderson's cock, a sound which caused the Dom to laugh at him. "What's wrong? Can't take it?"
"You have got to be shitting me!" Bucky muttered with a shake of his head.
One hand grasped Steve's neck as the other reached to the nightstand and snagged the lube they kept handy. Passing it to Steve, Tony lay his feet flat on the bed and his knees fell to the sides as Steve rose to his knees between Tony's thighs.
Coulson paused to peer at Tony. "SHIELD medical can take them."
Steve's brows furrowed. "How?"
Steve stood in the middle of the large room baffled. Clearly the people here were doing
"We should probably finish up in here so I can feed you." Tony sighed, hugging Steve tightly and laying his head on Steve's shoulder.
"How long you been on-site?" Coulson asked, falling into step beside the man.
The moment the door closed behind him, Bucky was at his side. "Come on. Let's get you to bed. You need all the rest you can get before we go after Schmidt tomorrow."
Tony snagged another soda from the fridge and headed for his lab. It would be cutting it close, but if he assigned someone else to move the equipment they needed to medical, he would be able to focus solely on the arm and nail down the last few details before it was time to leave.
"Sorry, Sir."
"It would be my pleasure!" Henderson grinned from ear to ear.
"Yeah, maybe." Tony pushed off from where he was leaning against the table. "In the meantime, I can get started on the rest of the prosthetic. I'll be in the lab if you need me."
Bruce chuckled as he finished scanning the latest readings. Once finished he looked up to see the hopeful expression on his patient's face. "You are medically cleared, provided you see me again at the end of the week so I can check your levels again."
"We already suspect he was taken advantage of. No, scratch that, he was abused. Dad's going through Grandpop's old diaries to see what else he can learn about his involvement."
Henderson followed moments later with a shout.
"Don't I always?"
"I've already informed them they won't get a paycheck if they do. They know we're on our way. We'll be there in a couple of hours." Coulson gestured for Tony to go ahead up the lowered ramp into the jet.
"Maybe their name will appear soon."
Phillips passed Henderson a bowl and Steve cried out as his penis was dipped in ice water. When his erection subsided, Henderson lifted an item from a box at his side. Steve noted it was anal beads, the largest of which appeared to be only slightly smaller than Henderson's fist. He braced himself, knowing Henderson wouldn't bother covering it in lube before pressing it into him.
Steve and Tony entered operations command hand in hand. The rest of the team was already assembled, and after narrowing her eyes at the two men, Natasha launched into the mission brief.
"Steve didn't have a soulmark."
"You're probably thirsty. Water?"
Pulling his fingers from Tony's ass, Steve chuckled at the whine of loss from Tony. He poured a bit more lube into his hand and rubbed his cock as he leaned over Tony. With one hand bracing him, Steve slid slowly in. Both gasped in pleasure.
Henderson started fucking Steve in long, slow thrusts while Stark fucked his throat. Grabbing Steve's hips, he began to increase his pace, pounding into the supersoldier, and leaving bruises on his hips.
"Sleep well, Stevie."
Bucky shook his head to clear it, pushed himself to his feet, and swallowed hard. "Let's find him.
"Of course, Sir.
Cautiously making his way forward to what had to be the main controls, Tony spotted something in the ice at the bottom of the single seat. "Ah, guys!"
Bucky heard Gabe's soft whispers to the rest of the guys outside, trusting the gentle Dom to get what was needed to care for Steve. While he waited for supplies, Bucky settled into Steve's bed, gently shifting him until Steve lay in his lap. Carding his fingers through Steve's hair, massaging as he went, Steve curled into him.
"Think he can take you up to your elbow?" Phillips traced Steve's rim with his fingers, amazed at the stretch.
"Jarvis, privacy mode please," Steve instructed before shifting to face Tony, grasping both of his hands.
"Alright, J. Save our work, send the details to Dr. Strange, and then close it down for the night."
"You disconnected the transmission lines?" Pepper confirmed. "We're off the grid?"
"Hey, Tony."
"How so?" Tony's brows furrowed, wondering if there was more between the two men than originally thought.
"Missed you." Steve breathed as he leaned his forehead against Tony's.
Bucky's heart dropped more the longer he worked. There was evidence of more than just knife play, but what really angered him was when he went to clean Steve's back and noted someone seemed to have fucked Steve with no preparation or lube. Steve's hole was torn and bloody, cum and blood still dripping out of him.
"Look at him." Phillips approached the bench where Steve lay restrained and his gaze traveled over every inch of bare skin.
Lifting the chastity belt from the table where he tossed it, Tony turned to Bruce. "We don't tell anyone what we found. I'm going to dispose of this, and you take care of the rest of him. I'll be back in a bit."
Steve looked down to where Tony held his hands. The memories from that night resurfacing.
"The icy water put us into some type of cryostasis or sleep. I won't pretend to understand or explain what that means. But, know this, we are seventy years in the future."
Steve sat on the end of the bench and lay back. Lifting his feet into the stirrups, he adjusted himself so his ass hung off the end of the short bench and his head rested in the headrest. He then lowered his arms to the side so they would be within reach of the restraints in the base of the contraption. Henderson then approached and began to strap him down, starting with the chest and hip straps. Once all the restraints were in place, he adjusted the stirrups so Steve's legs were spread as far as the bench would allow. Steve could feel the familiar stretch of his muscles and tried to relax for what he knew would be a long night.
"They were probably sharing body heat and got frozen together. I'll have support get down here to give us a hand." Natasha carefully made her way across the ice-covered floor of the plane to where the ropes they used to get inside still hung.
"Five miles south. It comes up beside a road. Found tire tracks. Already have Bruce going back through the satellite feeds, but there is no way to know when they left. They could be anywhere by now."
"That's the plan."
"Sir has allocated a floor for your living quarters," Jarvis announced. "If you'll place your hand on the security panel to the right of the door, I'll add your biometrics into my system."
"Yeah, we knew that too."
"I'm going to have so much fun with you." Henderson declared as he enjoyed taking in every inch of gloriously naked supersoldier. "Let's get started, shall we."
While he waited, Tony rolled Rogers onto his side to examine the rest of the equipment. His gut clenched when he spotted an anal plug attached to the bottom of the belt.
Shaking his head in amusement, Bruce headed for his floor. As he readied himself for bed, he asked Jarvis to wake him should Rogers or Barnes need him. He hoped, though, that both would sleep peacefully through the night.
"I have the notes from Doctor Erskine from before Project Rebirth. I also have notes from Peggy Carter. When she heard you two had been rescued, she sent over her own files for us to use instead of the official ones on file. She indicated I was to be the only one with access to them, and that they are to be used for your medical treatment alone.
"But ... " Steve swallowed hard, a million thoughts running through his head. " ... what about ..."
"They're at it again, J."
"Okay." Steve closed his eyes and considered their options. "There's nothing more we can do here. We'll head back, get some rest, and be ready to go as soon as Jarvis gets us a location."
"How many people know?"
"Yeah, Baby. Fill my ass. Give it all to me!" Tony encouraged, wanting nothing more than to feel Steve pulsing inside of him.
"Do I have to come back here for it?"
Tony turned to Steve, regret clear on his face. "I can't go. Not unless this is another alien invasion. You know Pepper's been harassing me about this board meeting for months. I can't miss it."
A knock at the door distracted Henderson for a moment, and Steve closed his eyes and swallowed. The only reason someone would approach Henderson's quarters right now would be if he planned to share. When Phillips and Stark strode in and the door locked behind them, Steve swallowed hard. The package Stark left by the door only brought dread. Those packages never meant anything good for Steve.
They slowly made their way through the structure into what appeared to be the main deck. The huge bank of windows in front of them showing nothing but the darkness of the ice.
Moving much slower than usual, Steve shifted into a more upright position.
Steve grasped the back of Bucky's shirt as the elevator began to move. Whether it was from fear, uncertainty, or simply Steve's submissive side finally coming out again Bucky wasn't sure. Upon reaching their floor, Bucky led Steve out of the elevator and into the foyer. The space was larger than their apartment in Brooklyn before the war.
"And how will you know what that is?" Bucky wondered what kind of records these men had access to.
"Send in Henderson!" Phillips called to his secretary, ignoring the pleas from the supersoldier standing before him.
Tony watched as the team boarded the Quinjet and it disappeared from sight.
"Buck ..." Steve's eyes began to water, his gaze fixed on Bucky's shoulder.
When the elevator stopped, Tony pushed off the wall and strode through the open doors of his lab, tossing the trash bag to a worktable on his way to the coffee maker in the corner.
"Where?" Steve adjusted his grip on his shield, ready for a fight.
"He never had a soulmark. In all the years I've known him, and we met when we were kids, he never once had the slightest bit of grey on his wrist. Why would he have one now?"
"It'll take us some time to go over what intel we found. Relax, Cap. We'll call you when we've got something." Natasha clapped Steve on the back as she passed.
"I'm going to cum."
"Hey." Tony wrapped his arms around Steve the moment he was in reach. "Do you need to debrief?"
Bucky met Bruce's gave and nodded.
"Good, now that he's plugged let's get to the real fun." Henderson moved back to the table and came back with nipple clamps with sharp teeth.
When Bucky and Steve spoke of the person who would get the chance to spend the rest of their life with Rogers, Tony couldn't help but smile. The thought of the captain being cared for, cherished, his every need seen to. His imagination began to run away with the thought and an image came to mind. One of Rogers kneeling at his feet, his posture perfect, his gaze peeking up at Tony, a small grin on his face, his glorious body naked save his collar so Tony could caress every inch of his body with his gaze.
"Save my work and shut it down, J." Tony stood and strode for the elevator, snagging the three files on his desk on the way out. "Take me to Rogers' floor."
"Of course, Sir. And might I add my congratulations."
"Oh, hush now. Let the man do his work." Phillips knelt beside Steve's head and detached the headrest before stripping his clothes off and tossing them to the side. "Here, this will help you remain silent."
"What all do you want to do?" Steve recognized the doctor as the man who was at his bedside when he woke but was still wary of the stranger.
"Pretty close."
"And no hookups to anything outside the compound. No power or phone lines. Completely isolated." Tony switched the picture that was zoomed in. "They're totally off the grid."
"Tell her five minutes," Tony ordered as he encouraged Steve to pick up where he left off.
Tony Stark stared at the coffee maker, wondering why he hadn't upgraded the machine to brew faster. After a long night in bed enjoying his boyfriend, the last thing he wanted was to be awake. Alas, Pepper had been hounding him about the meeting today and he couldn't miss it. So, coffee would have to do the trick and keep him awake.
His head already fuzzy by the time he reached the kitchen, Steve couldn't stop a small smile from forming. Pausing and drawing in a deep breath, Steve surveyed the room and considered what he would make for Bucky. Although he would love to be fed, to continue the slow slide into subspace, he wasn't entirely sure what Bucky had planned for the evening.
Pushing back to meet Steve's thrusts, Tony was unable to decide which was better. The fact he could feel every inch of Steve's long, thick dick in his ass as he kept up a brutal pace and Steve's grip on his cock working him in time with his thrusts were both equally pleasurable.
"STEVE! BUCKY! ANSWER ME!"
Bruce's brows furrowed for a moment before realization began to dawn on him. "He wouldn't have had a Dom if he had a soulmark."
"You're right." Sighing, Steve stood. "Jarvis, where's Tony?"
"Of course." Tony led Steve towards the couch set up in the corner and tugged him down to sit beside him.
Rising, Steve crossed the room to the bench. It had been months since Howard Stark provided Henderson with adamantium restraints and the Dom used them as often as possible. This particular bench had a removable headrest, straps for his ankles, thighs, wrists, chest, and hips, as well as adjustable stirrups for his legs. Today the stirrups were high and wide.
"Steve." Tony grasped Steve's arm. "Plug me."
Bucky stood, offering a hand to Steve and pulling him up from the training mat. The two supersoldiers had been training for over an hour and Bucky could still see the tension in Steve's shoulders.
