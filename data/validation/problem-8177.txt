"I know that part wasn't," Steve said. "But, Tony, we almost lost Peter, and—and that was because of me, and—what if your father hadn't been able to make that serum, then—?"
As much as Steve wished that Thor's dramatic entrance would have marked the end of the battle, it was not to be. The war dogs just kept coming, backed by the two huge aliens who were now marching among them, the male alien's hammer flying every which direction as Steve swung and punched and batted and leaped and twisted and ducked until he was certain that his body was simply going to come unglued.
Apparently he hadn’t been the only one who thought things had gone well.
"That's the one," said Bucky. "Apparently this Richards guy completely painted the walls of his lab with himself, and Banner, well… from what Peter found it didn't go any better for him."
Tony glanced up at Steve, squeezing his hand again when Steve nodded.  “No, Mr Wilson, he’s not.  But I think with your help, he could be.  When can you get here?”
“Oh, yeah,” said Peter as he stuffed a Dorito into his mouth.  “I aced my geometry test and a pop quiz in civics, and—”
Glancing up at the clock, Tony was shocked to see that it was almost 11pm, Peter’s bedtime on weekends.  He let out a groan as he hoisted himself off the couch, sniffing as he made his way back to the living room to find the television muted and Peter already half-asleep, with his head tipped back against the couch and pieces of popcorn scattered across the floor in front of him.
“Nah, that’s okay,” said Ned.  “I’m almost done with that project anyway.”
Dad pursed his lips, shooting Peter a sharp glare over his shoulder. "I don't need either of you worrying about me, Pete. And Papa knows that too."
of it.
echoing against the surrounding mountains.
"Maybe it has something to do with Toomes or that Smythe guy?" Steve said. "One of them could've talked?"
And his poor, sweet son.
"Yeah, I'm fine," Peter said, ducking as Uncle Bucky aimed at another suit at least twenty metres away, landing a perfect shot between the thing's neck and shoulder. "Where's Papa, did you guys find him yet?"
"But it’s true!" Peter cried. "No one else did anything with JARVIS besides me and Dad, so—?"
"Peter?" Steve asked, gently shaking his shoulder. "Wake up, little guy, please? I need to see you open your eyes, okay?"
"Okay, so I've mentioned a few times about the orbital defence system, yeah?" Tony began.
"I am perfectly capable of completing both tasks at the same time, sir," protested JARVIS. "Please stand by."
Gwen bit her lip, leaning in closer. "If you want my honest opinion, I think it's because my dad's been having second thoughts about how he feels about the Spider-Man. You wouldn't know since you haven't been over in a few months, but my little brothers still talk about him constantly, and so do all of their school friends. They all thought he was someone they could look up to, and maybe relate to a bit since it seemed like he was a lot younger than the rest of the Avengers. And they've all been pretty bummed ever since he disappeared."
"No, I think I'm too hungry to sleep," answered Peter. "Can we please stop and get some food on the way home?"
"Oh, I'd be careful about that if I were you, Falcon," Papa warned. "Don't go getting your hopes up too high."
And right on the heels of those thoughts came the guilt. Peter had been planning on sitting his dads down the day after their anniversary dinner—that day—to tell them about the HYDRA files that he'd decoded. He had been hoping that they both would've been in a good enough mood to appreciate what he had done without getting too upset about the fact that he'd done all of it behind their backs.
"Pretty sure the entire universe knows how much you hate resting, Dad," Peter said. "It's not exactly breaking news."
"Barbaric?" Steve said bitterly. "Yeah, I agree." He dropped his chin to his chest, shaking his head. "The government hadn't even figured out the power outages yet, but they still didn't think twice about trying to kick us out. If it hadn't been for Bucky and his family, I'm not sure what Ma would've done."
Which was something, at least. Still nowhere near enough, but Steve was grateful for it anyway.
Peter shrugged. "Pretty much anything, I guess. I don't get to go outside very often so it's mostly stuff I can see through my bedroom window." He shifted closer, lowering his voice. "I'm also helping my dad a bit with one of his side projects, but I'm not allowed to talk about that. It hasn't been approved yet."
Dad smiled as he reached for Peter's hand, giving it a light squeeze.
Peter thought.
“You're not gonna mess up my leg, Tony,” Steve says, as firmly as he’s able.  Tipping slightly sideways, he holds up the armoured finger.  “Just give me a count to three, okay?”
Unfortunately, clicking on the Project Rebirth title under Howard Stark's name only got him back to the same information that he'd already read, causing Steve to grit his teeth in frustration.
"Call me, Tony," Tony interrupted. He'd always hated being called Mr Stark as it always made him want to turn around and look for his father. "Please."
"Look, Captain, please forgive me if I'm way outta line here, but I know you and Mr Stark lost your son in the snap," Scott quietly continued. "And over a year ago, you guys helped me get my daughter back from what seemed like an impossible situation, even after I tried to break into your house. And so I'd just—well… if this crazy idea could somehow work, then… I guess I'd just really appreciate the opportunity to do the same for you. And for everyone else who's lost someone, or someones."
"Стив?" Uncle Bucky said as he raised his shiny black rifle. The Chitauri speeders and scaly whales were still circling around Thanos and his aliens, finally coming to hover behind them as Thanos let out a wide, leering grin. "What do we do?"
“Then what was the point of coming here in the first place?” Steve exclaims, his voice rising with every word.  “Are you telling me that Strucker can just hop to another dimension whenever he wants?  ‘Cause if that’s the case, then this whole raid was just a big waste of time!”
Gangrene, Uncle Bucky had called it.  Tissue death caused by a lack of blood supply, often accompanied by severe infection.
Tony tilted his head, pursing his lips. "I'd say you're more than just a bit rattled if you're pulling stuff like this now."
“Okay, so… who does he report to?”
"I am ready, Тони," he said firmly.
"Uh huh," Peter answered. He turned to look at Steve, his bottom lip poking out. "I'm ready, Papa."
"Oh, I bet!" said Peter. "And I'm sure you remember all of 'em, huh?"
His voice trailed off as he looked over at Steve, pleading silently with those puppy-dog eyes of his that he knew neither Tony nor Steve could resist. It had been almost three weeks since the fire monster attack at the movie theatre, which, aside from a few local news stories, had garnered a surprisingly small amount of attention for an Avengers-level type of threat. Thanks to Bucky and Peter's heroics no one inside the theatre had been seriously injured, and the Stark Relief foundation had already covered all of the medical bills and the salaries of the first responders involved, which Pepper had made sure to let slip to the media.
. At least for the moment."
"Dad!" Peter said as his mask retracted, his curly hair flopping every which direction. "That was so cool what you and Uncle James did to that ship!"
And no matter how hard Steve tried to convince him otherwise, no matter how much he had begged and pleaded, Tony couldn't bring himself to hear him.
"They are," Tony said, so flatly that Steve's blood ran cold for a moment. He traced around the rim of his cup with his finger, his beautiful brown eyes filled to the brim with fear. "They… it's like they were just sitting there in the background of my mind, biding their time until we were able to destroy HYDRA, and now—"
"Eh, it's coming," answered Tony. "I'm hoping to get it done before we leave for Italy, that way we can test it once we get back."
"Then he would've given you such an ostentatious tongue-lashing that you probably would've been too afraid to ever show your face around me again," Tony said, nodding when Steve's eyes went wide. "And you think I'm joking? I actually watched him do it not once, but three separate times!"
"Sir?" he said. Steve had made sure to have his mental compartments as neatly arranged as possible before stepping inside the office, and was now literally begging them not to fail him.
"Good day, Captain Rogers, Mr Stark," Stacy said as he stepped over to their table. Steve reluctantly got to his feet, shaking Stacy's outstretched hand.
"But—"
Steve pursed his lips. "I think a lot of it depends on who you ask," he said. "And I also think that you just might be a little bit biased."
"Yes, Mr Stark," Lang said rapidly. "It is very, very clear. Like, crystal clear. I swear it. For the record."
(See the end of the chapter for
"No—" Steve started.
Tony said, sounding just as wrecked as Steve.  He began rocking his hips forward, pulling moans from them both.  “Holy shit, Steve, I’m not gonna last long.”
"Here, kiddo, take a sip of water, yeah?" Uncle Bucky said. He handed Peter his water glass, nodding in encouragement as Peter took three small sips. He did need to calm down, both for his own sake and for Papa's. Freaking out wasn't gonna do Papa any good now.
"Yeah," Steve said, his smile widening slightly.
"That's better," Tony said once he was finished, blotting at a drop on Steve's chin that had managed to escape. "Bruce said he'd be back in about an hour, so—"
The first thing Tony noticed when he opened his office door was that somehow, Steve had managed to become even more handsome than he'd been just earlier that day. Dressed in a blue t-shirt that clung to his broad shoulders and exactly matched his eyes and those perfectly worn jeans that showed off his magnificent ass to perfection, he was quite literally a living, breathing wet dream standing right there in the hallway.
“Hey!  I wasn't gonna laugh at you!” protested Ned.  “I was just gonna… sympathise.  Yeah, that's it.”
And what a restful break it was. Aside from his wonderful vacation to Ireland with Tony and Peter, Clint and Natasha had spent a month out in Indiana with his sister-in-law and her family along with the Maximoffs, while Sam and Bucky ended up with season tickets to the Mets, inviting George Stacy to join them whenever he was available.
It had been the ice again. The Arctic ice this time, with the sounds of shattering glass and groaning metal rumbling in his ears and the freezing-cold water searing right into his lungs to choke the breath from him as he sank, lower and lower and lower…
“What, Steve?  What?” Tony asks, just as hoarsely and pained as Steve.  “Got some famous last words you want me to transcribe for you?  I s’pose my handwriting is decent enough.”
"O-okay," Steve finally said, forcing the words past his dry, scratchy throat. He allowed James to hoist him to his feet, stumbling a bit on his wobbly legs as he attempted to look around, to take inventory of who was still there, and who they had—
"Dad? We're gonna find him, right?" Peter hated how pathetic he sounded, and how
No choice but to drown.
"All right then,
"Nothing much," Peter said with a shrug. "But apparently his mom found out that we're gonna have a new student starting in our class who's supposedly smarter than me."
do? 'Cause I gotta admit I haven't seen all that much evidence to the contrary, and—"
"Maria, go to him!" Howard ordered, pursing his lips as he regarded Pym. "And you! You know damn well that I had absolutely nothing to do with the power plant bombing! We have an alibi! Maria and I were at the hospital with Tony when it happened!"
Tony could only shake his head, his tongue refusing to cooperate as he pointed an accusing finger at Steve, who immediately set down the tray, hurt and confusion marring his blue eyes.
"Oh my God, Tony, you scared me!" Steve exclaimed as he brushed the sweat-matted hair from Tony's forehead, his skin so dry and hot that it was like touching the one of the tarred Brooklyn streets in the middle of summer.
Steve silenced him with a kiss, a soft, chaste kiss that nonetheless still caused warmth to spread across his chest, especially when Tony's fingers burrowed into his hair to hold him in place. It was almost too much warmth, given the fact that his skin still felt like it was at least a hundred degrees.
Steve thought, since Tony had recently outfitted the entire building with their defence drones, complete with a long enough range to target the competition site if necessary. That plus the fact that all of their teammates were also planning to attend the competition were the only reasons why Steve was able to be so calm about it. After the committee meeting, Steve was not at all looking forward to returning to Washington D.C.
"Only the best climbing trees that I've ever seen, buddy," Tony said. He ruffled Peter's hair, trying hard to contain his emotions. Over the past few days he had cried enough tears to last a lifetime, but still they insisted on coming. "And Papa and I can't wait to see you climb 'em."
Peter still needed to work fast.
At first Tony didn't believe him; he may have been drunk and stoned out of his mind most of the time but he had always been careful when it came to his hookups, be them with boys or girls, and had never had any reason to believe the occasional oddball claim that he had fathered a kid out there somewhere.
"Yep. Uncle Sam and Auntie Nat are driving me tomorrow."
"Yes, I am, Stark," said Dr Strange. He looked down at the rather odd, oval-shaped pendant that was hanging around his neck, pressing a button at the top. Then he crossed his arms in front of it, contorting his fingers as he drew them slowly apart to reveal a glowing green stone hidden inside the pendant.
"I like to visit my ma," he continued. "She used to be a nurse, actually, before her arthritis got too bad and she had to retire." He tugged on the tight collar of his shirt, clearing his throat. "I also like to draw, when I have the time."
And any attempt to remove one of them would simply destroy the whole thing.
Tony's eyebrows knitted into a frown. "Mmm, we'll see," he grumbled. He wound his arms around Steve's neck, tugging him closer. "Now, I believe that we were starting something here."
Peter knew he didn't have too long, though.  Even on a good day Dad’s naps were never longer than an hour or so, and with time being the essence that it was, well… Peter knew he needed to hustle.
"Copy that," Tony said, circling back towards the far section of the bunker just in time to see what he hoped was the final suit crash down onto the ocean-drenched rocks.
"It's catastrophic," Steve said quietly. "On a level we probably can't even quantify."
"I'm coming!" Peter said again, sucking in a deep breath as his mask closed over his face. Then he raised his right arm, palm facing the sky, and launched a web at a nearby tall pile of debris, giving it a quick tug as it latched itself on. Lifting himself off of Titan's floor, Peter quickly launched a second web through the portal, bringing him through. He flipped in the air before landing gracefully on the Wakandan plain, his mask retracting as he saw his dads standing about three metres away, clutching each other's hands like they were the only things keeping them upright.
"Ready?" Tony whispered once Steve was settled.
"Okay, Pete, let's just try and stay on task here, yeah?" Tony said with a sigh. "Now, as I was saying, we only need to get the gauntlet off, and I think between all of us, we should be able to—"
"Tony?" Steve said as he looked behind him into the ship, obviously searching for Peter. Tony could tell the precise second when it dawned on him, when his eyes changed from pure elation to fear, and tentativeness.
Oh well. At least he hadn't been expecting a response.
"Yeah, babe, it is." Tony breathed in as he took Steve's hand. "I knew there had to be something fishy about that new janitor at the school, I just
"Huh?" Peter whispered as he turned on his heel, leaning closer to the cracked door. He felt a small pang of guilt for eavesdropping, but if the guy really was talking about his father, then was it still technically eavesdropping?
He heard Papa's heart skip a beat, his arms tightening around him.
There was no response, and the intellectual part of him hadn't been expecting one. But Steve still felt a sharp stab of pain when he pulled back and saw Peter just lying there, completely unresponsive. It was almost as if he were—
All definitely
“See?” says Mags.  She places her hand on Tony’s shoulder, leaning closer.  “You know, my dear Lorenzo and I were married for fifty-five years before he passed, and every day I come in here I still expect to see him there in the back, yelling out orders just like he used to.  It’s been almost ten years now, and still not a single day goes by where my very bones don’t ache for missing him.  He was the love of my life, and everyone good deserves a love like that, Anthony.
"Oh, shit," Tony muttered as he scrubbed a palm down his face. "Ahh, when is the dance again?"
"Okay, okay!" Quill said, backing away slightly. "I never said I wasn't gonna listen!"
"Steve… baby," Tony whispered as he ground his hips down, moaning at the delicious friction and pulling another moan from Steve's throat. "Oh hell, honey, it's been way too long!"
Planting his feet, Steve swung his right fist and hit the bag again, the satisfying
"Hey, if we're doing some sort of pizza-eating contest then I wanna be in on it too!" protested Clint. "I know I'm not a goddamn god or anything, but I'm pretty sure I can hold my own when it comes to pizza!"
"Huh?" Peter blinked as he shook his head, his eyes so scratchy and raw that they felt like they'd been coated with sand. "Sorry, I was just… I'm just kinda tired, and—"
And he'd be packing Tony and Peter off to Asgard, instead of sitting on their bed trying to stop shaking.
Peter shook his head, almost daring his mind to disprove what JARVIS was saying as he reread the page.
"Yeah, for now," Tony muttered under his breath. "Doubt it'll hold 'em off forever, but it's at least a start."
Tony rolled his eyes. How was it that he still wasn't used to how well Peter could hear now? "Yeah, well, why do you think your room's on the opposite side of the house, hmm?" he retorted. "And regardless of the reasoning,
to save him.
"Okay, but please, just listen to me?" Goosebumps covered nearly Peter's entire body from the shivers running down his spine, and the battle sounds were getting louder and more frantic. The odds did not seem to be in the Avengers' favour at the moment, so Peter needed to be out there, helping his family.
"Not without Steve, Dad," said Peter. "I'm serious."
"Only that your relationship with him wasn't that great," Steve said, laced with sympathy. "And that Howard never really recovered from his arrest and trial."
Tony hesitated for only about three seconds before setting down his Thermos. He still didn't believe that he'd be able to actually sleep, but the thought of curling up next to his boy for a couple of hours did sound pretty nice.
“I am never too busy for you, sir.”
"Not at the moment, Senator," said Tony. "Creating something that's as effective as the Iron Legion isn't exactly something that can be done overnight. Or inexpensively, as I'm sure you're aware."
Steve thought, the words echoing inside his mind.
"But—!"
"Why, Captain," Tony said, feigning innocence. "Are you trying to flatter me?"
Steve’s full lips curled into a soft smile.  “Mmm, I know.  But I’m still gonna.”
Immediately Tony stepped back, raising his hands. "Yeah, yeah, sure thing. Just let me know when you need a break."
"Okay, that's my cue to sign off," said Carol. "You two have fun, I'm gonna call James."
"Yeah, but then who's building the stuff on the other side?" asked Tony. "'Cause even though it may look easy to just copy a design, it is not as simple as it seems."
Tony immediately thought.
Peter had also encouraged Steve to ask Tony out on their first date, explaining that the homophobic standards Steve had grown up with were no longer acceptable. Steve could remember like it was yesterday how happy he had been when Steve told him he and Tony were getting married, and how proudly he had carried out his duties as Tony's best man during their ceremony.
"Steve, we gotta let Wanda help!" Natasha called. "She can take those things out!"
Which, as it turned out, was a lot easier said than done. Going from being practically bedridden and unable to do much on his own to being able to lift the front of Dad's car with one hand to retrieve a fallen tool had not been all that easy to adjust to.
" Tony begged. He placed both hands on Steve's shoulders, his brown eyes glassy as they pleaded with him to listen. "Please, just go get cleaned up, okay? I promise nothing else is gonna happen while you're in the shower."
Which meant that the weekend probably wouldn’t turn out to be any different from most of their weekends.  Dad would get caught up in some project that just had to be done “right now”, and Peter would be left on his own.  Again.
"The Maw is one of my most devoted children. A devotion that stretches beyond the borders of universes," Thanos continued as the Voldemort alien stepped over next to Thanos, Steve's rage spiking at the smug look on his hideous face. "And now, once I have rid this planet of all of its pesky and annoying little people, he will be properly rewarded with it. And he will do with it whatever he pleases."
Peter grimaced, trying to step back just as Tony reached for him, pulling him into a quick hug.
"All right." He tilted Tony's chin up to kiss his lips, his breath hitching when Tony quickly deepened the kiss, his hand curling around the back of Steve's neck to hold him in place as his tongue plundered his mouth, searching for his own. Steve could taste the faint traces of peppermint and chocolate on Tony's tongue, and he quickly lost himself in the touch, taste, and feel of his husband as Tony's other hand slid down to his ass and squeezed.
"Yeah. Okay," Steve whispered back. Then he closed his eyes, breathing in the scent of Tony's hair as he allowed sleep to take him, no longer afraid to dream.
"Look, bud, I didn't mean to snap at you, okay?" Tony said gently. "I think we'll all feel a lot better once this is over."
Tony's eyes narrowed, then widened as the realisation hit him about three heartbeats later. "Uhh… how, exactly?" he asked. "'Cause wasn't he listed as one of the—one of the—"
And, as such, Tony was absolutely
I can’t wait to hear what you think of the first chapter!  Please don’t forget to hit the kudos button and leave me a comment!  💗
“All right.  Since you're already familiar with Colonel Rhodes here, Obie, we’ll move on.”  Releasing Steve’s hand, Tony moved over to Bucky, clapping him carefully on his right shoulder.  “This is Sergeant James Buchanan Barnes, U.S. Army Special Forces, honourably discharged due to injury.  In his almost nineteen years of impeccable Army service, Sergeant Barnes served five tours under the leadership of Captain Rogers, the last of which was cut short due to his severe, career-ending injury, for which he received the Purple Heart medal.”
Steve nodded as he reached for the glass of water on the bedside table, downing the whole thing in three large gulps.
"Um, because it wasn't just an internal conflict," Tony said slowly, almost as though he was talking to Peter when he was a toddler. "Those helicarriers were programmed to target millions of innocent civilians, as I'm sure your committee members read in the thousands upon thousands of pages of data that Agent Romanoff made available to the public."
“Yeah, sure,” grumbled Peter.  “Well, if that's really the case, thanks.  It sucks.”
Steve's entire body was prickling with fear as he reached for Tony again, winding his fingers into his hair and tucking his head under his chin. He had heard far too many stories of families being ripped apart by Hitler and his Nazi regime during the war, soldiers who didn't know where their loved ones were or if they would ever see them again, and Steve just couldn't fathom how he could handle being separated from his own family.
Or, at least not while on only one waterski. He had gotten the hang of two skis pretty quickly, but trying to ski on a single was still giving him trouble.
"Yes, that's correct," said Steve.
"Get these jeans off. And the rest of your clothes too, while you're at it," Tony ordered as Steve tore away from his mouth to suck another mark into his neck. "A body this exquisite should never be covered. In fact, I might even make it a new house rule. No more clothes for you."
"Aw, yeah!" exclaimed Sam, playfully knocking Bucky on the shoulder. "See? I knew you could do it, man, I knew you could!"
Dad was the one who had the messed-up history with Peter’s mother, not Peter.  And Dad was the one who kept clinging so tightly to Stark Industries, when Peter really could’ve cared less about it.  He had watched his father kowtow to Obie’s stupid demands on his time and his intellect for his entire life, and he was
"Nah, I've got the next five songs already queued up, so I thought I'd come over and see how the commoners were doing," said Flash.
"Yeah, but—"
If he were truly brave, he would’ve had the operation on his shoulder that he’s so desperately needed ever since shortly after his gold medal race, instead of wasting tens of thousands of dollars on cortisone injections and useless physical therapy that only served to increase his pain level and prolong the inevitable.
"Care to share your interesting thought?" Steve asked. "Does it involve the technology from Beck's proposal?"
"That's right," answered Steve. "Your associate, Valkyrie, was leading them. She was riding a Pegasus."
“Ow,” Peter grumbled, rubbing the back of his neck as he yawned.  “That hurt.”
Peter drew in as deep a breath as he could before driving his elbow into the wall three times in rapid succession, forming a spider web of cracks across it as he tried to break a hole big enough for Chief Stacy to fit. He cried out in pain as massive wood splinters and razor-sharp pieces of drywall drove through all of his layers of clothing and into his skin, trying to maintain his grip on the wall with his sweaty fingertips as the monster let out yet another deafening roar.
"Okay, okay, just don't let up," Dad said as he took hold of the gauntlet. "Pete? Need your help here, buddy!"
"Ah, yes, Mr Stark and Dr Banner," said T'Challa. "I have heard of them both as well. My sister would be very eager to meet such a group of well-renowned geniuses, as she is one herself." He cleared his throat, nodding towards Thor. "I am guessing that you are about to inform me that you believe there is something of great importance hidden somewhere inside my country. Is that correct?"
Which meant that he would see this battle through to its end, whatever it took. He would lead the fight against the massive alien army being summoned through an interdimensional portal from at least three different universes, because that was his job.
"Nice going, Wanda," Steve said. "Keep it up."
"Then I know I will." Tony glanced over at the drawing, at the three of them looking so happy and healthy and together, and the tears he'd been trying to hold back finally broke free, tracking down his face to pool in the scraggly stubble sprinkled across his chin.
Bucky jumped slightly at the first sharp whistling sound of the pressurised air, but kept his eyes firmly on Peter the whole time, watching his face and smiling at his boyish joy at getting to work on something so unusual as a high-tech metal prosthetic arm. In addition to his almost-constantly running chemistry experiments, Peter had been assisting Tony with his work practically since he'd been old enough to walk, but he still approached nearly every new project with the same excitement as if it was the very first thing he'd ever been allowed to participate in.
"Well, 'cause there's nothing there," Gwen said. She turned the screen towards Tony, which showed nothing but ocean waves crashing against a rocky shoreline. "According to your JARVIS these are the exact coordinates that Peter transferred to his phone, but unless I'm missing something, I can't see anything there."
"Okay, okay," Steve said as he squeezed Tony's hand. "But we can assume that it's someone with ties to the government, since it was a Damage Control server that had the information, can't we?"
"Uncle Bruce and I will bring you to school in the morning, okay, bud?" Tony said. "You got your alarms set?"
"Yeah, I know you are, but—"
Tony huffed out a sharp breath as he snuck a glance over at Steve, who was pacing back and forth about five metres away, his gloved hands gripping his belt and his jaw so tight it could looked like it could cut through vibranium.
"Tony? Sweetheart, are you okay?" Steve asked, obviously alarmed as he gently wiped the tears from Tony's cheeks. "Are you hurt? What happened in there?"
the nurse cooed once Dr Goldman had left. "
"Well… I'm sure if you asked 'em real nice, the nanites in your suit would display it for you. Kinda like an outsider's HUD," said Tony. "You could make it look like you're trying to protect it, when really you're—"
"Yes. Thank you," Steve whispered as he pressed a kiss to Tony's forehead. "I love you, sweetheart."
Besides. Peter would want him to try. Always the optimist, was Tony's boy.
Tony gave a quick nod, deliberately relaxing his shoulders and unclenching his fists the way Sam had taught him. Peter had always been far too perceptive for his own good, and Tony had never been all that great at hiding his emotional state, especially when he was already stressed.
“Jesus, Pete, will ya keep it down a little?” Tony hisses.  “And what the hell are you yapping about?”
"But I don't wanna talk about that now," Peter cut in. He pulled his notebook out from under his blankets, flipping to a page titled
And it wasn't that Steve didn't trust Tony. On the contrary, he trusted Tony implicitly, just as he knew Tony trusted him, and the two of them always worked very well in the field together. They worked instinctively, and could anticipate the other's movements so easily it was as if they'd been fighting together all their lives. It had been like that ever since the Battle of New York.
Tony cut off as he came, spilling over Steve's hand as he thrust up into Tony's body once, twice, three times before his climax slammed into him like a freight train, and he cried out his release into Tony's shoulder as Tony collapsed against him. With the last vestiges of his strength, Steve carefully eased them back against his pillows, tucking Tony's head under his chin.
"Radiation?" exclaimed Tony. "Holy shit, Steve, that's not exactly—!"
"Yes, sir, that's correct."
"She does not believe it will do any good," Drax spoke up. "Now that Thanos has the Time Stone, it does not matter how long it takes us to repair the ship. We are doomed either way."
Thanos paused, a smile stretching across his lips that was so full of irony and sarcasm that it made Peter's belly swoop.
"Стив, you know that asshole was just trying to get to you," Bucky said gently.
“That's fine,” Peter rushed out.  He raked his fingers through his hair, grimacing as they got stuck on a particularly stubborn knot.  He’d needed a haircut about three weeks ago, but Dad had been too busy and he never let Peter go by himself.  “You said an hour?”
Mantis nodded, her huge eyes wide. "I will be right behind you."
"Just please do it quickly, Sharon!" Steve said, his heart nearly tearing in two at Peter's panicked gasps. "Please, he's terrified, and—!"
Steve thinks as the water finally clears from his ears.  The roars of the crowd are nearly deafening as he removes his outer cap and goggles, placing them on the deck under the starting block before gliding across his lane over to Schmidt.
"But you are," Natasha cut in, her expression morphing into one of such anticipation that Steve's belly swooped. "He's talking about somehow reversing the snap. Of bringing everybody back. And in order to do that, we'd need—"
"Phoenix One, standing by," replied Steve, his calm voice hiding the nervousness that only Tony could hear. He had held Tony so tightly the night before that it had been hard for him to breathe at times, but Tony hadn't minded in the least. Especially since when they'd driven to visit Peter earlier in the evening, Peter had asked him if he could stop calling him Steve and start calling him Papa instead.
And then, once he was there and had a visual on Papa, Peter could figure out a way to send Dad a signal, letting he and the rest of the team know where they were.
"Neither can I," Tony said, suppressing his own shudder. "I was so scared and out of it that I thought I was hallucinating when you came sliding down that sand dune."
Sam called as he swooped down from the sky, directly in front of Steve's parallel-universe counterpart. "
"Um…" he said, clearing his throat. "My Uncle James is here, actually they both are, so… I need to get going."
Steve nods as he takes another sip of his juice, nearly choking when it tries to go down the wrong pipe.
"Basically," Tony said gently. He slipped his hands around Steve's waist, ghosting his fingertips just above his waistband. "JARVIS'll find something, honey. We still have about seven weeks before this guy gets inaugurated, so—"
“Your handwriting is beautiful, Tony,” he says, with as much sincerity as he can muster.  “But it’s not as beautiful as you.”
"Yeah," Peter said somberly. "That's exactly what I'm saying."
Peter breathed in as he looked at his two incredible dads, the dads who had literally gone back in time and battled several universes worth of aliens to ensure that he would be able to sit there, in that kitchen, wearing that comfy hooded sweatshirt that smelled like his girlfriend.
"Yeah, that's one of the first things I checked on, Cap," replied Clint. "It's been visually accounted for in its vault, and according to JARVIS the vault hasn't been opened since the last time Bruce opened it, which was six days ago."
"Mr Lang owes twenty thousand, three hundred and forty-four dollars and thirty-eight cents, sir," answered JARVIS. "As of today."
, Steve thought. As often as he used the "going for a drive" as an excuse for his afternoon disappearances it had been a pretty long time since he'd actually just gone for a drive, and there was a pretty nice lake not too far from the base that Steve had been thinking about heading to for awhile anyway.
Tony slid his fingers over Steve's lips to silence him, rolling his hips up to meet Steve's and delighting in his husband's sharp intake of breath.
"Yeah, I know," Steve said quickly. "I'm just…" He trailed off, not quite sure how to finish his sentence.
how do you do it?"
"Tony," he said on a gasp as he took the hint and tugged off his shirt, tossing it behind him and kicking off his shoes as Tony pulled off his own shirt. "Sweetheart, I—"
Steve's heart fluttered as he released the breath he'd been holding. He had tried so hard to picture what Peter would look like once he was healthy again, and had also been very nervous that he'd somehow get it wrong and make Tony upset.
all of it just so HYDRA could get their hands on him.
"It was such a pleasure serving you gentlemen on this fine evening," their waiter said as Tony paid the bill, giving him a three hundred dollar tip. "I hope you have a both have a lovely evening, and happy anniversary."
“Yeah, bud, I do,” Dad said, rather wistfully.  “All right.  What’s it called again?”
"Dude, you okay?" Ned hissed as their teacher stood up to deliver the morning announcements.
"No, I don't," Steve repeated, a bit more emphatically as he lifted his head and cupped Tony's face, bringing their lips together in a slow, deep kiss. Tony let out a whimper as Steve's tongue plundered his mouth, one hand gliding down the length of Tony's back to slip underneath the hem of his t-shirt.
"I'm gonna head back to the jet with this stuff," Bruce said, balancing at least five different pieces of computer equipment in his arms, along with several books on computer languages and theories and a Russian-English dictionary. Steve found it mildly amusing that with all of his vast knowledge and with JARVIS at his disposal, Bruce still preferred to use real books as references as often as possible.
😣 = the angst is killing me!
Because the war between Langara and Meridia had been waging for decades, longer than he'd even been alive, and for Tony to propose a program that would not only force the military to give up its super-secret potential weapon of mass destruction, but then take that weapon and offer it to the citizens of Meridia as well, Langara's sworn enemy…
"Not on the first date, Buck!" Steve wheezed. "I'm not—I'm not—just
“I’m ready, Tony,” Papa said firmly.  His fingers curled around the arms of the chair as he settled his head back against the headrest.  “Let’s get started.”
"That's right," said Clint. Steve watched as he instinctively stepped forward, partially in front of Pietro, and couldn't help but smile softly. For someone who never thought he'd want to be a father, Clint had definitely stepped up to the plate with the twins.
“Oh, good grief nothing,” said Tony.  “If the cat’s been fed, then let’s get out of here before the roads get too messy.”
"But you like her?"
“The system has been disabled.”
A blast of fear suddenly hit Tony like a repulsor shot, nearly causing him to double over. He'd been hoping against hope that somehow all the SHIELD people had been wrong, because… well… none of them were him.
Steve blushed, looking down at his plate. "Yeah, I did think of that, but Peter seems to pretty much run the other way whenever I try and hold your hand in front of him, so I'm hoping it won't be too much of an issue."
He'd have to remember to thank him later on.
"And why does he need this particular device?" Steve asked.
With an audible gulp, Steve gave a nod, pressing one final kiss to Tony's lips before climbing onto the motorcycle, heat tearing through his chest as Tony climbed up behind him and wrapped his arms around him.
"Gwen, honey, Colonel Rhodes is right," Stacy said gently. "You've helped us with so much already, but it's almost four in the morning and we should really be getting home now."
It was always good to know exactly who you were up against, and Steve wanted to collect as much data as he could before he finalised his plans, even if all of the garbage spewing from the mouths of the pro-registration senators had almost made him angry enough to punch through the living room wall more than once.
But Tony supposed that was all beside the point at the moment.
"The differences in the design of missile silos in the United States and the Soviet Union," Ned said. "It was actually kinda interesting. It seemed like however we did stuff, the Soviet Union wanted to do it differently. Like the exact opposite."
"All right, I think that's the game," Steve said, brushing the snow from the front of his ski jacket. "Whew, little guy! You're pretty good at this game!"
“Mr Stark told me his son completed all of the swimming classes at the Y by the time he was seven,” says Lorraine.  “He also said that the kid’s doctor recommended that he try swimming, so it sounds like he has some kind of medical issue.”
"Yeah, that's what I was thinking too," agreed Tony. "Which is why it's even more important for you two to stay as vigilant as you can. We've already discovered that Meridia was copying almost all of our tech, and—"
Rhodey breathed in, glancing at Sam. "Tony, I don't—I don't know how to tell you this, but—"
"As do I, Captain," Stacy said firmly. "Keep him safe, that is. As both a father and a law enforcement officer, it's very important to me that all of the people under my watch are kept as safe as possible, and that includes all of the occupants of that Tower of yours. Especially when two of them are right now in the company of my daughter."
A sharp stab of guilt pierced Tony's chest at JARVIS's words. It was completely inexcusable that someone other than himself or Peter had been able to override the elaborate security systems at the Tower, and it had haunted him ever since they'd left the hospital down in Miami following the battle in the HYDRA bunker. In fact, developing new and improved security measures had been frequently keeping Tony up at night since then, in-between battling Steve and Peter's nightmares. He had already uploaded the initial program of something he was calling the Iron Legion into his old suits, and in fact had also begun building new unmanned suits for the exact purpose of extra security should it become necessary.
“Hey, buddy!” he said as Peter slid into the front seat next to him.  “How was school?”
"You think Auntie Nat and Uncle Clint would feel like going too?" Tony asked. "I can arrange for one of the luxury boxes, that way there shouldn't be too much scrutiny, and—"
by the beginning of the year," Uncle Bruce said as Dad pulled his car onto the street. "She's already got the first draft undergoing review."
With not even a body to bury.
"It's okay," Steve said quickly. "I just… I know what you're doing is important, but—"
"Indeed, sir."
"Ah huh," Steve managed as he tried to climb down from his cockpit on his shaking legs, grabbing the ladder when his knees threatened to give way. He'd been so upset after Tony left that morning that he hadn't eaten any breakfast, and with his overactive metabolism his blood sugar was now in danger of bottoming out.
Was he?
"No, no. I wasn't checking up on you, if that's indeed what you were asking," he said. "There are a few things that automatically get flagged whenever anyone conducts a query for them in the database, and Howard Stark's name just happens to be one of those."
Oh, and then there’s the
Taking his seat, Tony scanned the various senators facing him from the oval-shaped table. Senator Davis sat to the right of the committee chairman, some old guy from Oklahoma who in Tony's experience seemed to be chairman in name only, always deferring to his colleagues whenever anything of actual importance was discussed. He picked up the pitcher of water in front of him, pouring both he and Steve a generous glass as Rhodey and several other high-ranking military officers took their seats in the rows behind them.
It'd been something that Steve had requested after he'd managed to convince the other X-302 pilots to go along with Project Phoenix, a feat that had both surprised Tony with its ease and not surprised him. For all of his nice-guy,
"Well, anyway, it's all in the past now," Steve said. He pulled Tony into a tight hug, trailing his fingertips up and down his spine. "Look, it's been a pretty long day, so why don't we go to bed? Try and get some good sleep?"
"What did you say to Steve," Peter interrupted. "When you were yelling at him, what did you say?"
Scrabbling for Tony's hand under the table, Steve gave it a quick squeeze before clearing his throat.
"Okay, then…?"
"Hey, hon-ney," Tony sing-songed as they broke apart. "Wanna go take a shower with me?"
"Yeah, but not as cool as what Carol did to the second one," answered Tony. He ruffled Peter's hair as he quirked an eyebrow at Steve, giving him his
"It sucks, doesn't it," said Tony. He pressed a soft kiss to Steve's clammy forehead. "Not being in control."
Tony rasped as Steve broke away from his lips to kiss down to his neck, sucking on his sensitive pulse point just hard enough to leave a small mark. He was usually very careful to not leave any visible marks on Tony's body out of fear that he might somehow get him in trouble, but this time Steve figured that it didn't much matter. Aside from the fact that their room was almost certainly bugged, it's not like Colonel Phillips hadn't already guessed what went on in there practically every single night.
Dr Strange had told them only a few minutes before Thanos showed up, and Peter was nearly strangled to death in the battle that followed. Dr Strange had said that he'd viewed fourteen million, six hundred and five possible outcomes, and that the Avengers had been victorious in only two of them.
Which also meant he probably shouldn't mess with it.
"Okay, well, send this over to Bruce, get some fresh eyes on it."
"He wasn't in there this long, Clint, you know that," said Auntie Nat. "Just long enough to—"
Tony stared at him for a long time, his lower lip quivering. "The data accessed from the server turned out to be the design schematics of my Iron Legion suits," he said. "Which means that whoever it was—"
"Ah," Gwen cut in, nodding as if she understood. "They've been gone for over a week now, haven't they?"
"Yep. See you guys soon."
"'Cause he's an asshole, honey," Tony said plainly. "Just like Howard was an asshole. And they didn't like each other because they were both the same kind of asshole."
“And, last but certainly not least,” Tony continued, shooting Steve what he hoped was an affectionate wink.  “Captain Rogers is also the man that I’m in love with.”
"No one'll know the difference, hon," Tony whispered as Thor started one of his rants about how he was planning to rip the gauntlet from Thanos' arm by ripping off his actual arm, a manoeuvre he had insisted on practising during their most recent training sessions.
"Yes, sir. There was nothing else."
"Long as you do the same," Tony murmured.
As soon as Ms Sharon left the room Peter sniffed, swiping the tears from his eyes. It wouldn't do any good for Dad to hear that he was upset.
“I promise, buddy,” answered Tony, for probably the umpteenth time.  “As soon as you get inside those doors.”
Resting his chin on his arms, Peter studied the puzzle, finally connecting a piece of one of Hedwig's wings. He was reaching for another when Gwen's fingers closed over his wrist, halting him.
"Yes, sir?"
I can do this all day.
Instinctively, Peter grinned, even as he shook his head. "I don't know, dude. I don't exactly understand all the rules for that stuff yet. Especially since they seem to change a lot, and without warning."
Steve's shoulders sagged as he gave Tony a rather sheepish look. "Tony—"
"Yeah."
"Sounds good." Steve held out his arm, which Tony eagerly took as they headed out of the room and back up to the main floor, nearly running headlong into Nick Fury as they stepped off the elevator.
Then they'd all be arrested. Every last one of them.
"Ah… well—" Peter started.
He had just downed the last of his coffee when there came a series of three sharp knocks on his door, with Steve poking his head in a second later.
Not too surprisingly, after a long day at school, a swimming tryout, and eating enough pizza and breadsticks for three people, Peter only makes it about fifteen minutes into his history questions before he starts nodding off.  After making him promise to finish his homework in the morning, Tony waves him towards the bathroom to brush his teeth and get ready for bed.
"Tony," he began, tightening his grip on Tony's hands. "There's no way I could ever convey how much you mean to me in just a few short sentences, so let me simply say this. When I met you, I was a bitter, broken, shell of a man hiding behind a rank and a fancy flight helmet. I had believed for so long that if I could just achieve the next goal, and then the next one, and then the next one, that somehow I would just magically become happy."
"Yeah, well, that's probably a good thing," Pepper said with wide eyes. She tapped the files in front of her with her pen. "Anyway, Tony, I have a favour to ask of you. I just got a bunch of performance reviews to sign off on, and as I've been going through them I've been noticing a few… discrepancies, I guess is a good word. I was wondering if you wouldn't mind—?"
"No!" Tony said firmly. He honestly didn't think he could bear hearing Steve say it again. "Don't you dare say it, you understand me? Everything's going to be just fine, so," and he clenched down on Steve's fingers, wiggling his hips," why don't you just get on with it, yeah? 'Cause my patience is starting to run very, very thin."
would someone go in behind Tony and change the document?  It just made no sense?
"Sweetheart, stop. You're so much stronger than you think," Steve said, gently but firmly. He cradled Tony's beautiful face in his hands, pressing soft kisses to his forehead, nose, and finally his lips before pulling back to meet his eyes. "I love you, Tony. I love you with all of my heart and soul and everything in me, and no matter what happens—"
There was no doubt in Tony’s mind that Peter deserved so much better than him.  Someone who didn't come with all of the tabloid fodder and the oh-so-flattering nicknames, and the heightened risk of being snatched off the street by some raving lunatic just because his surname happened to be Stark.
"We know because the containment vessel that I built to carry the thing is made from a metal that absorbs vibrations," said Tony. "It's the same metal that's powering the space-faring X-302s."
"We're too."
"Nuh uh, sexy man. I get to go first tonight," Tony said. He tapped Steve on the shoulder. "On your back for me, okay? I've been wanting to get my mouth on you all damn day, so you're just gonna have to let me."
Especially when he knew that Peter would much rather be able to see his own father than some person he'd only just met.
"And even less so if the so-called enemy turns out to have been their very own government the whole time," said Sam. He shot Colonel Rhodes—
"Oh, you have some plans for me?" Steve asked, raising an eyebrow. "This I've gotta see!"
He broke off as he saw General Okoye emerge from the Wakandan army, accompanied by five of her warriors and another young woman, whom Steve recognised as T'Challa's sister, Shuri.
“Maybe for you,” Schmidt spits out as he rips the cap from his head, tossing it in the general direction of the deck.  “You may have won this particular race, Rogers, but that does not mean that you are superior.  I have been an Olympic champion four times, so no matter what you accomplish, you will never be as good as me.”
"Tony," Steve whispered, so reverently that tears pricked Tony's eyes. One hand glided up his back to his neck, his fingers weaving into Tony's hair. "My sweetheart, my beloved husband, you don't owe me anything. Not a single damn thing."
"Yeah, a couple," Sam said as he elbowed Bucky in the arm. "More like a couple at MACH-2. Gods, Steve, I'm pretty sure even some of our old aircraft couldn't've kept up with you this morning, much less one of us mere mortals."
Pleasure that Tony gave him.
And as the team leader, it was his responsibility to make sure that the team was ready when that day came.
"Oh," Peter said as he slumped back down into his pillows. He raised his left arm, scowling at the two separate intravenous lines flowing into it. "Well, at least there's that."
And all that plus the fact that he really, really,
"Tony—"
"You thinking Tony's the one for you?" Bucky asked, quirking an eyebrow.
Tony disconnected the call before Gwen could respond, which he regretted a few seconds later but quickly brushed off. The Stacy girl was nice enough, but Tony wasn't sure he'd be able to talk to her again unless Peter's condition changed, which at the moment didn't look like it was going to happen anytime soon. He'd have to get Steve to do it.
"Carol?" Steve asked, not taking his eyes off his enemy. "Do you copy?"
"Freight car!"
It was Steve. Bruised and battered, but it was still him.
Typing the last of the code, Peter pursed his lips, his trembling index hovering over the ENTER key.
As if on cue, both Tony and Peter turned to look behind them, where Antennae Lady—Mantis, apparently—was standing with Mr Clean—Drax.
"I will remain here until the prince is secured, Captain," Thor said grimly. "Go!"
"Yeah, I do," Steve said with a sigh. "Sorry."
Well, then again, Steve supposed it kind of had been.
he screamed inside his mind.
"All right," Tony said softly. "We can try."
“Hey, now!” Tony protested as he curled his fingers around Steve’s arm.  “I’m pretty sure there’s no such rule that says we ever have to stop,
Stacy shook his head, rather proudly. "No, I didn't. And not only because he saved my life."
"So, you were trying to break back into Mr Pym's house to return the suit… that you originally stole from his house?" Steve asked.
"Tony, just… wait a second!" Steve cried, the fear in his voice gripping Tony's heart like a vise. "Are you
"Tony," Steve said quietly. "It's okay, sweetheart."
"Wasn't your fault, Steve," Natasha said firmly. "And it wasn't Tony's either, in case he's asked."
"Yeah, okay, but no matter what Steve's reasons are, it still doesn't give us the right to go against his wishes," Uncle James said. "Now, I can see what he says the next time we talk to him, but we're trying to keep the conversations to a minimum to preserve his oxygen, so I'm not exactly sure when that's gonna be."
"Copy that, Cap."
He even had thought to grab some extra napkins, just in case Gwen started to cry towards the end. Auntie Nat had cried when she saw it with him, so he wanted to be prepared.
Steve's look of pure, barely-contained bliss combined with his rather stern Captain's voice was so incredibly erotic that Tony almost came right then and there. Most of the time during their lovemaking sessions Tony would've already given Steve either a handjob or a blowjob to help him take the edge off, but other times, like this one, Tony just somehow knew that Steve didn't want it. That he wanted to push his self-control to its limit, just like he pushed himself on his morning runs.
Peter sighed, nodding. "Yeah, I know. But he was pretty excited about the space-capable aircraft, wasn't he?"
"At your service, sir."
"Uh, maybe because you were already freaked out enough after that whole thing?" Tony said with a frown. "And it didn't work anyway, so what's the big deal?"
don't talk like that. Peter loves you so much. Even before I really got to know him I could tell that he adored you beyond words. He was always talking about how smart you are, and how important your work was." He curled his arm around Tony's shoulders, hugging him close. "You're his hero."
"Tony—" Papa started, with Dad cutting him off with a single sharp look.
"Or possibly on this William Baker person," said Steve.
But now they were both finally healed, and as far as Tony was concerned that meant there were no more excuses.
Tony's cheeks instantly drained of colour, his lower lip shaking. "You saw…
Dad screamed, his words interspersed with repulsor fire. "He's gonna kill him!"
"Huh?" Peter said. "Um… no, I don't usually watch my dad while he shaves. Sorry."
"I'm not testy," Steve snapped, huffing when Bucky raised an eyebrow. "I just don't think we should be so quick to judge someone when we don't know what's—"
The penthouse was dark and empty as the elevator doors slid open, a painful contrast to the levity that had filled it just that morning, when the three of them had left for work and school.
"Yeah, but half-god of what, idiocy?" Dad retorted. "And an idiot with a gun is a pretty dangerous idiot, bud."
He was safe.
He supposes he’s had it coming.  Sharon was still pretty upset with him yesterday for his lousy progress on his range of motion, so… nothing like a looming crisis to finally get Steve to step up his game.
"As soon as you can, J," he said. "Did ya hear that, big guy?"
"He's been asleep for awhile now, so I'm sure he'll be starving soon enough," said Tony. "As soon as Bruce gives us the okay we'll get him out, yeah?"
Shifting in his chair, Steve brought Tony's hand to his lips, kissing it over his wedding ring. He had lost so much weight on his journey back to Earth, over seven kilograms, that even his fingers, normally slender and long—
"Oh, can't complain too much, Mr Leeds," Dad said with a smirk.
"Tony, you told me yourself that your house was a mess the last few times you were there, and I'm sure my ma's friend would appreciate the business," added Steve. "She's an Air Corps widow too. Her husband was killed about a year ago."
Steve pursed his lips. "I am
He broke off as he started coughing again, clutching his aching stomach muscles.
"I highly doubt that," said Steve. "All right. While Bruce is heading back to New Asgard with Thor, I think the rest of us should concentrate on researching methods to repel the effects of these stones, and that we should get started as soon as possible. Dismissed."
"Don't think I would've minded a little warning in this case!" Gwen sniffed. "Now I'm thinking that everyone's gonna die!"
a bunch of times in some of his online forums, and had seen a few pictures of what the book covers looked like.  But in all of his travels to England and elsewhere, he’d never been able to actually find one of them.
Settling back in his chair, Steve opens his bottle of apple juice and takes a long drink, trying to figure out the easiest way to get Natasha off his back without being too rude about it.
"Um… well, I s'pose it would depend," Peter stammered, giving Gwen what he hoped was an appreciative look. "Papa would never do anything specifically against the wishes of another country's government, so—"
—Steve had never, ever said something as bold as that to Tony.
He was getting way,
"Uh huh. Well, then it says that the autopilot can only be overridden by the ugly alien dude that we blew out the hull when we were saving you, so… I'm thinking that means we're pretty much out of luck."
Thanos is this lady's
"I'm fine too, as you can see. No permanent harm done," he said. "And, if it's all the same to you, I've just about had enough with the three of us taking turns getting hurt." He hadn't quite thought about it like that before, but there hadn't been a single one of their more epic battles where at least one of them wasn't either presumed dead or seriously injured, and that definitely needed to stop.
Tony chuckled as Peter scrambled to fetch his fishing supplies, winding his arms around Steve's waist as Steve's arm wrapped around his shoulders.
Steve instantly smiled. "Yeah, I do. I just… I didn't know if maybe I'm trying to push things too fast or something. I don't have a lot of experience with this kind of thing."
Climbing into his cockpit, Steve sucked in a deep breath as he pulled on his harness and helmet, trying to clear his mind. At the moment he absolutely needed to focus on his flying, there would be no room for mistakes up there with the threat level still high and with new patrolmen joining the shift, not to mention the grey clouds he'd seen accumulating in the sky on the walk to the hangar. Steve had flown with John Sheppard and Major Kowalski before when he'd substituted on other patrol shifts, and while they were definitely talented pilots, it still felt very wrong for Steve to be up there without Bucky on his wing, keeping watch over him like he always had.
"And you're jealous of Uncle Bucky," Peter murmured into Tony's chest.
“Yeah, bud, I get it,” Dad cut in.  “I ended up ruining all their plans.”
"Look, I'm not gonna rehash our argument again, mostly 'cause I just don't want to, but honey, as much as I hate to tell you, it probably won't be the only one that we ever have, and I can't have you going out there and trying to get yourself killed every time that we do. Okay? Especially now that Pete's latched onto you already, I can't have him worrying about you every single time you take off."
He looked up as the door opened again, gulping as General O'Brien slowly stepped through. He was a smaller man, someone Steve's ma would've described as "stout", with greying brown hair and dull brown eyes. His uniform was flawless and impeccably pressed, his boots so highly polished that Steve could make out his reflection as the general stepped forward.
"Okay, okay," Steve said, far too calmly for Tony's taste. "But sweetheart, it's only three thirty in the morning, and I'm sure that Peter's asleep, so—"
It was the beginning of August; there was no way there could be ice on the lake.
"Uh huh," Peter whispered, grateful when he didn't sway on his feet as Dad released him. His throat was still burning and it was getting harder and harder to keep his vision from slipping into its honeycomb-like state, but if it meant getting off of Titan in one piece, he would do whatever it took.
"Are you all right, sir?" JARVIS asked.
"Not quite, but at least it's a bit better now," Peter answered. He pecked her quickly on the forehead, brushing his thumb across her cheekbone just as the bell started to ring, nearly causing him to jump out of his skin. He cried out as he slapped his hands over his ears, barely able to regain some of his composure as Gwen took his elbow, guiding him into their classroom.
"Yes, we do," Steve said firmly, gripping his shield. "We fight."
"Tony?" he said, tilting his head like he was trying to place him. "What're you doing here?"
"Well, it's probably safe to assume that the alien dude was supposed to deliver the Time Stone to his boss, don't ya think?" Tony asked. He pressed his palm to his chest, tracing the outline of Steve's dog tags with his fingertip. "Which means we're probably aiming towards Thanos right now."
Gwen's eyebrows knitted together as she nodded. "Oh. Well, I'm sure he's not the only one."
The woman nodded. "It was a long time ago, back in what you would call the year 1995. He… helped me figure out a few things."
-safety-controlled—invisible bunker down in Georgia to rescue Steve, so Tony was certain that he'd be able to handle himself well enough now.
With a soft groan of frustration, Steve digs into his pocket for his keys and quietly unlocks the bottom drawer of his desk.  Reaching inside to the very back, he pulls out a polished wooden box and places it on his lap.  After turning so his back is facing his dividing wall, Steve unlocks the box and raises the lid, his heart skipping a beat as his eyes land on the three gleaming gold medals resting inside, each carefully nestled in its own velvet-lined compartment.
“All right, hon, there we go,” Tony murmured as he finished tying the most perfect Windsor knot Steve had ever seen.  He shot Steve a quick wink as he smoothed his palms across the shoulders and down the sleeves of Steve’s Greens Army uniform jacket, tugging gently on the cuffs.  Then he carefully adjusted the Bronze Star medal pinned on Steve’s lapel and stepped back, eyeing him up and down.
was—together.
"Oh, shit!" Tony muttered as he scrambled to gather up the piles of papers strewn about his workstation. "JARVIS, uhh, you've—you've gotta—
"Which is why you're the lady in charge, Pep," Tony said proudly. At the moment he couldn't honestly remember if the company had even conducted regular performance reviews when he'd been CEO. "But just out of curiosity, who's the project leader that's got you concerned?"
"Watch out!" he cried, pushing Sam and Bucky back just as an ear-splitting crack of thunder exploded across the neighbourhood and Thor literally dropped from the sky, landing on the pad in a sizzling sparkle of lightning.
"I see," said Bucky. "And those plans wouldn't happen to be with anyone specific, would they?"
"I am absolutely positive," Steve replied. "I love you, Tony, and I want to marry you. Will you marry me?"
"Oh, it is, is it?" Steve asked, a rather mischievous gleam in his eye.
He no longer deserved to live.
"Got it," said Peter as he finished tapping the cinnamon into the mug. "And your ma used to make you this when you were little?"
"He must be talking about the Iron Legion," Peter murmured. "And if that's the case, then—"
"Tony!" Steve suddenly said, struggling against his damaged abdomen to try and sit up. "Tony? Is it—are you—?"
With a gasp, Steve's eyes flew open, flitting around the room as he took a quick inventory of his surroundings, realising a second or two later that yes, he was safe in his bedroom at the Tower, and not still embedded in one of his nightmares.
"Okay, so then—"
sticker that Tony placed next to it after the jet's last turbine upgrade. "JARVIS, what's our current arrival time estimate?"
and he slid to the fire-covered floor, going completely limp. Peter just knew that Gwen had sent her father in there to look for him thinking he'd been trapped by debris or something, and there was no way Peter was going to let him be further injured because of him.
"Just some small plans that I made," Steve murmured, winking as he kissed the tip of Tony's nose. He slipped his phone from his pocket and turned on the music player, with Tony letting out a wide grin as the crooning voice of John Legend filled the room.
Tony's heart skittered at the fear in Steve's voice, at how defeated he sounded. He had been able to hold himself together pretty well after the committee meeting, better than Tony had, actually, but this newest revelation seemed to have tipped him right over the edge again. Speaking with the rest of the team once Peter was in bed, Steve had barely been able to keep his voice from cracking when he brought up the senate bill, something Tony knew didn't escape their teammates' notice.
“I was looking them up because I thought I could show Steve some of the information about them,” Peter replied.  “But since all of the trials for the neuromuscular drugs have been suspended, now I can’t even do that.”
"Well, it's a good thing you haven't completely lost yourself," Steve said once Tony had settled back against his pillows. He picked up the mug of tea, holding it up to Tony's mouth. "Careful, okay? It's pretty hot."
"Can I make love to you?" Steve asked, low and breathless. "Please?"
"Yes, but they still should've told him about it, Tony," Steve said firmly. "Because it worked. That serum transformed me from a skinny, sickly waif of an eighteen-year-old into—"
Expanding the hologram, Tony quickly become so engrossed in his work that he didn't even realise Peter had entered the lab until he opened his mouth, nearly causing Tony to jump out of his skin.
"On his own merit? Hell no," Tony said bitterly. "But, you add in a brilliant engineer like Quentin Beck, who's apparently been siphoning off my designs for almost the entire time he was employed at Stark Industries, along with some stolen Chitauri or Project Insight tech, and voila. You could make some pretty powerful weapons. He could have the military salivating with a single demonstration."

They hadn't stepped more than a foot inside the gym when Peter heard Ned yelling their names. "Peter! Gwen! I'm so glad you guys are here!" Peter grimaced as Ned hurried over to them, an extra-wide smile on his face. "Wow, you guys look nice!"
The fact that they were all banking on the prison being in a coastal area, and not in some other inaccessible place like on top of a mountain or something was something that Tony chose to conveniently ignore most of the time. Intellectually he knew it would be a lot easier to supply a building that was near water than in a mountainous region, and emotionally—
didn't want to.
"It's all right, Pete," Dad said quickly as Gamora stepped closer to Thanos, a rather triumphant smile on her face. "Just keep going!"
He strongly suspected that Uncle Bucky was reporting back to his dads, if not quite a play-by-play synopsis then at least on a regular basis, which he was actually okay with. Maybe it would help them see that even though he happened to be the son of two of the Avengers, he could still just be a normal kid who wanted to spend some time with the girl that he liked.
"I will," said Steve. It was absolutely
"Yep, that's what I meant," he said. "Sorry. I keep forgetting you guys don't understand my Earth sarcasm."
"Oh, yeah?" Peter said. "What'cha do it on?"
“Researching?  Researching what?” Dad asked, his eyes going wide as he skimmed the document displayed on Peter’s monitor.  “Explodable bullets?  Pete, where the hell’d you find this?”
Peter gulped as he looked down at his long, piano-player fingers that reminded Tony so much of his own mother. It still saddened him from time to time that Maria Stark never had the chance to meet Peter, because Tony had no doubt that she would've adored him. Aunt Peggy had done her best to fill in for that grandmotherly role, at least until her mind got too far gone for her to remember him, but it still wasn't the same.
"Sure seems that way, babe," Tony murmured. "I almost can't believe it.
After posing for several pictures graciously taken by Sam, Tony and Peter headed down to the garage. The plan was for Tony to drive Gwen and Peter to their restaurant for dinner, then have them escorted the two blocks to the school by Stacy and his partner, who were both on duty that evening. Stacy had also volunteered to drive Peter home after the dance ended at midnight, which Tony had uneasily accepted after being encouraged by Sam to do so, but at the moment he still wasn't quite sure if he'd be able to go through with it.
Gwen gave a nod, her pretty green eyes wide with fear.
"We shall."
When in fact, it’s all been because he’s been too ashamed to admit that he
Depressing the trigger, Steve watched in awe as the satellite launched from his aircraft, abruptly stopping about five seconds later and turning so its pointed end faced the planet.
Shoving his hair from his eyes, Peter laid back against his pillows, glancing longingly out his window. It was an absolutely beautiful day outside from the looks of it, the kind of day that would've had him racing around on his bike or climbing the massive tree in the backyard. Dad used to joke that trying to contain Peter on a warm sunny day was like trying to force an explosion back into its bomb casing.
"Looks like I'm about four minutes behind Steve," said Captain Barnes. "And my numbers match up with JARVIS's too."
If only it really were that easy.
"I'll talk to him after dinner tonight, okay?" said Steve. "Are you thinking sometime this weekend for the experiment?"
"That's what I was hoping," Papa said as he ruffled Peter's hair. "Sleep now, little guy. I love you."
"Well, now he's got another chance," said Peter, pointing to his lines of code. "As long as the code is sound there's really no good reason not to do this, and then his name will be spoken with reverence around the entire world. I mean, can you think of a better way to honour him?"
"Gwen's fine, little guy," said Papa. "She and her family are safe at the Compound—I mean, the Tower."
Because if he hadn't known better, Tony would've thought that it sounded like
He hears a sigh, which no doubt is accompanied by one of his father’s famous eyerolls, followed by footsteps on the wooden hallway floor as they approach his bedroom.
"Yes, so I saw," Grandma said. "But unfortunately for Joseph, even though he was a pilot as well—and a damn good one, I might add—his family wasn't in the proper social circles, so he was sort of looked down upon by most of the Air Corps elite."
"I knew you'd say that," Peter muttered. "But I really think he's trying this time."
"All right," Steve said once his cowl was in place. "Tony, I'd like you and Peter to start working on some manoeuvres similar to what he's done with James and Sam. You guys instinctively worked really well together during the battle, so let's work on getting those instincts as sharp as possible, okay?"
Steve paused for a moment to glance at Tony, his lower lip trembling at the the look of pure admiration on his face, something that Steve never, ever grew tired of. Tony had told him many times how much he loved his "Captain America pep talks", and Steve was immensely grateful for his support.
"I believe those were your words, sir, not mine," replied JARVIS. "I was merely asking a simple question. The fact that you chose to construe it into a commentary on Master Peter's tendency towards absentmindedness was not at all due to my influence."
Hurrying back to the elevator, Peter tapped his foot impatiently as he rode another five floors down to where the stockrooms were housed, waving his Stark Industries ID badge across the electronic lock. The computers were kept in the same area as the rest of the electronics, cell phones, and tablets, and while the regular stock laptops weren't quite as nice and didn't have as much memory as his own that was custom-made, he only needed to add a bit more processing speed to what he already had, so it would hopefully be enough.
"Nah, not yet, I'll probably start it this weekend," answered Peter. "It's not due for a week anyway."
"Then we must hold them off," T'Challa stated. "Evacuate the city. Engage all defences. We must not allow anyone to destroy our beloved home."
Tony paused to allow his words to sink in, his heart fluttering at the awe breaking out across the faces of each of the pilots. Peter had told him there'd be no way that any pilot worth his uniform would be able to resist the possibility of being the first Langaran to fly into space, and as usual, he had been absolutely right.
"Yes, I'm pretty sure we know, Mr Lang," Steve said, somehow still managing to keep a straight face. "Seeing as we are the Avengers."
Steve frowned, eyeing the top floor of the building as he and Bucky trotted into the parking lot. None of the team members had gas masks available, which he had a feeling he was going to hear about once he got home.
"Yeah, he was," agreed Tony. "Gods, Steve, I really wish you could've met him."
"Yeah, I will."
And a few minutes later, freshly cleaned up and tucked into bed with Tony’s back snug against his chest, Steve closed his eyes and slowly breathed out.
"All right," Phillips said, finally concluding his soliloquy. "Mr Stark, if you will."
"He did," Steve said proudly. "He even grated the cinnamon for me."
“Oh, sure,” Peter says, raising an eyebrow.  “But I highly doubt that’s all you were looking at.”
"Who the hell are you?" Tony yelled, grabbing onto the man's shoulders and shaking him. "I asked you a question, you asshole! Why did you attack my son?"
Image Papa said over and over as he worked to unearth his friend.
"You'd be still running your own company," Pepper said with a sly grin. "And who knows where we'd all be then. I'll see ya later."
Tony told himself over and over as he drove back to the base. Peter was the strongest person Tony had ever seen, and he'd already made it much longer than the doctors had ever imagined. There was no way he'd ever give up on himself now.
Alt-Steve shook his head, his fingers pressed tightly to his ear. "
(See the end of the chapter for
"Aw, hell yeah!" Mitchell shouted as the entire crowd erupted into cheers. "That's what I'm talking 'bout!"
"How—how I'm feeling… um…" Peter paused as he glanced around the basement room again, lingering for a second or two on Howard, then moving to the crowd of people looking down at them from the anteroom.
"Yeah, not now Pete," Dad said hoarsely, rummaging around in the mass of papers next to him. "I need to… um… I need to find—"
"Yep," answered Blaster Peter. "We're the Guardians of the Galaxy."
Tony nodded, blotting his chin with the washcloth. "Your ma was a pretty neat lady, yeah?"
"What, mention the fact that your kid is nothing more than some freaky science experiment gone wrong?" said Rumlow. "You know, I saw all the records. Those scientists, they were gonna create an entire army of creatures like him. But all they ended up with was some weak, scrawny kid who's afraid of his own goddamn shadow. What a waste—"
Steve leaned against the bike as he watched Peter enter the school, dropping his head once the doors had closed behind him. As much as he might have liked trying to go back to bed once he got home, there was no way that he could. He and Sam had a meeting at ten, one that Steve had already rescheduled three times, and he wanted to get some more work done before that.
"Waiting on your order, honey," he replied as he slowed to a hover about fifteen metres over Steve's position, causing Steve to chuckle. It wasn't exactly professional to be using personal endearments out in the field, but Steve knew that it was pointless to call him out on it.
Gwen sniffed again, nodding before she blew her nose. "Yes, I will. Thank you, Captain. And I hope—I hope Mr Stark will be okay soon."
The way his hand fit perfectly inside Steve’s, the way Steve’s arms fit perfectly around his waist, and the way their lips slotted perfectly together.
" Tony rasped as he tilted his head up to meet Steve's lips. The kiss was hard and frantic, and Tony whimpered as Steve cupped his cheek, his tongue slipping inside his mouth to stroke against his own. Tony knew that they both had been using sex as a distraction far too often lately, but at the moment he also didn't give a damn.
"And here we are," Mrs Stacy said as she reentered the dining room, carrying a large silvertoned platter laden with a huge three layer cake. She set it down in the middle of the table, handing Gwen a cutting knife.
Why, why,
"Definitely," Peter answered, even though he had no idea if Dad would let him go or not. "There's no way I'm gonna just sit home and cry. That'd be like letting them win."
Again he was silenced, this time with Tony's lips against his. "Don't be sorry, honey," Tony whispered. "Let's just get this done so we can go home, yeah? I mean, not that you don't look damn good in that uniform, if I do say so myself, but I can say that I've just about had enough of HYDRA's lack of hospitality, and I know Pete misses us."
"Long as you don't eat 'em around Петр", Bucky said sternly. "It'll make him sick if you do."

And now, if Tony’s right and they really are trapped here in this Twilight Zone-esque place, then that means there’s a real possibility that Steve’s going to be responsible for losing not only his own life, but also for Peter losing his father.
Only one chapter left!  😊
"Dad, it's fine," Peter cut in. "You don't have to worry about me." Papa, Uncle Sam, and Uncle Bucky had left for a debriefing with Director Fury up at the Compound over an hour ago, and Peter knew that Dad was already anxious to join them. Peter's dads had warned him that the debriefing might become an all-day event, and had even gone so far as to arrange for him to hang out at Gwen's house after Decathlon practise, something that Dad and Papa never did unless they had no other choice.
"That's okay, I'll go and check on him now," Steve said. He patted Peter on the shoulder. "Did you remember to pack your snacks?"
"Sounds good." Peter pulled on his jacket, swinging his backpack over his shoulder as Gwen packed up her index cards.
—seemed more bony, causing his ring to wobble a bit as Steve carefully pressed it to his cheek before lowering their joined hands back to the bed.
"No way," Tony said rapidly, earning a frown in return. He brought his hands up to rest on Steve's biceps, giving them a light squeeze. "We need to get started on your suit now."
“The printers are more important, Obie,” Tony said firmly.  “Ms Roberts’ team has already been robbed multiple times, at the cost of thousands of dollars.”  He didn't bother mentioning the poor aid worker who’d gotten killed, as he knew Obie wouldn’t’ve given a damn anyway.  “Being able to manufacture their own medicines on the spot as they need them will save the Foundation a ton of money in the long run.  The printers are cheap, and the chemicals are cheap.  They are worth it.  And our assembly lines can more than handle the workload.”
"Yes, Captain," answered JARVIS. "Master Peter is currently sleeping peacefully, with all vital signs within his normal parameters."
"Oh. Yeah, sure." Peter pushed himself up to a sitting position, watching Uncle Bucky from the corner of his eye as he set up the chessboard on Peter's lap tray. As stoic as Uncle Bucky usually was, Peter could tell that he was struggling now, with his jaw clenched and his lips tightly pursed. He'd ended up being the person who had sat with Peter for most of the night, so he also looked about exhausted as Peter felt, with his skin paler than usual and dark purple circles under his eyes.
"I ask myself that every single day," Steve whispered. "Multiple times."
He'd even confessed to Steve the night before that he had a son, something he'd been dreading telling him ever since their first date. But instead of freaking out like he'd expected, Steve had actually seemed excited, telling Tony that he was very much looking forward to meeting him.
Sighing, Tony scrubbed his palm down his face and reached for his coffee cup, grimacing when he realised it had already gone cold. He really needed to install a coffeemaker in the lab, and too damn bad if Steve thought it was a lousy idea.
Bucky's blue eyes gleamed mischievously. "Aw, now c'mon honey, you always say that your money is our money and my money is our money, so—"
"Can you give me a location on the server, J?"
"Really?" Steve said. "That soon?"
Instead of answering, Peter reached inside the hologram, expanding a small section and leaning in closer. "Can I tweak something in here?"
"You look really nice too," Peter said. "You know Dad's not gonna know what hit him when he sees you. He always loves it when you wear your super-fancy uniform."
Especially since Obie had already tipped the Joint Chiefs off that something “incredible” was coming.
Now, there were no groundskeepers. No first-generation Italian men dressed in overalls and gardening gloves and whistling as they went about their work. By some miracle, none of them had been seriously injured when the Winter Soldier's bombs hit, and though Tony and Steve had eventually decided not to rebuild the home, they had made sure that all of the employees were well-compensated for their sudden loss of employment.
Peter nodded as he picked up his own orange, taking care not to crush it as he attempted to peel it. He had grown another two centimetres since the trip to Italy, and had already managed to rip yet another backpack zipper and another two pairs of shoelaces. Both Papa and Uncle Bucky had been arm-wrestling with him in the evenings to help him learn to control his strength better, but he was getting to the point where he could beat them so easily now that he wasn't sure it was actually doing him any good anymore.
And then maybe, just maybe, Tony and Peter could finally walk away from the legacy of making things that blow up, and embrace one of creation instead.
you just look incredible!"
"Yeah, but does that mean he's okay?" asked Peter. "He's not dead?"
“Pete!”  Tony squeezed his eyes closed, sucking in a deep breath.  The image of Steve’s six-foot-plus, two-hundred-pound self launching at his son and tackling him to the floor was still a bit too fresh in his mind for him to want to be having this conversation, but he knew from experience that Peter wouldn’t just let it go either.  Not without an explanation that he deemed reasonable.
The fish sufficiently fed, Tony recapped the container and exited the room, heading back to the kitchen to put on some more coffee. He leaned against the counter while it was brewing, fighting the urge to ask JARVIS if Peter's bus had left for the museum yet. He had offered to drive Peter and his friends there himself, but Peter had declined, giving Tony some excuse about the school's liability insurance stating that all of the students needed to arrive together, or something to that effect.
—into the most important battle of their lives.
“What’s going on, Obie?” he asked.  “I was just about to go get Pete, and—”
"Tony, please, just stop!" Steve pleaded. He drew Tony close again, squeezing him so hard that he grunted. "Please, sweetheart, don't talk like that. You're so much stronger than you think, and it hurts me to hear you say things like that."
"Look out!" one of them screamed, pointing over Peter's head as the monster's fist slammed onto the floor, opening another gaping chasm of liquid fire. Peter yelped as he leapt onto the back of one of the chairs, assuming the knees-out position that Auntie Nat had taught him to better balance on narrow surfaces. The floor strike had managed to light the debris blocking the main doors on fire, consuming the pile as it burned, so maybe all Peter needed to do was—
"And I think Clint and Nat should head down to Florida like they originally planned," said Bruce. "Then once Peter activates his chip, Clint can get in contact with us and we can all converge."
The splash of the hot water raining down onto Tony's chilled skin and tight muscles felt like tiny electrical shocks prickling throughout his body, and he let out a shiver as he backed further into the huge master shower so Steve could step inside. There was a shower on the Quinjet, of course, but given that it was barely large enough for Steve to fit inside by himself and that Tony often was piloting the jet at least half of the time, the two of them usually just waited until they were home and could shower together in peace.
"Right away, sir."
And it really could not have come at a better time. For as much as Steve's confidence had been padded by his teammates' optimism, he knew that what they would be facing as soon as they entered that quantum tunnel would be the most difficult challenge they had ever faced.
"Thank you," Tony said with an exaggerated sigh. "But… only until we get back, right?"
Based on the calculations that he'd completed when he first discovered the prison, Peter knew he had only about forty-five seconds before another suit was due to zoom by. He quickly got to his feet, and was still brushing sand from his chest and arms when he froze, the all-too-familiar ice bolt racing down his spine.
As Peter finishes his two laps, he looks up to see Dad talking with Mr Rogers, gesturing in the same animated way he uses with his rich shop customers.  As the water clears from his ears and he removes his goggles, Peter can’t help but notice that Dad’s even standing a bit different.  His shoulders are pulled back and his back is straighter, almost like he’s trying to impress Mr Rogers.
"Yeah, okay."
"Mmm," muttered Tony as his right eye cracked open just wide enough to glare in Steve's direction. "You first."
Peter shrugged, trying to smile. "Nah, it's okay. I have two dads that are both pretty cool, so I think I'm good."
"Hey, buddy!" Dad said from the screen, with Papa sitting next to him in what looked like Dad's lab in their Compound apartment. "You doing okay?"
"And I can't wait to see him for myself," Steve said. He pressed a hard kiss to Tony's forehead, brushing another tear from his cheek. "I'm going to be looking at this picture the entire time that I'm gone, okay? At the two people who I love more than anything else."
"Yeah, I guess. Smart enough to snag you, hmm?"
"Or, he might be even more eager for our help since the Avengers can be dispassionate," Natasha spoke up. "Is there any evidence that this might've been an inside job?"
"Just… first tell us how you feel, little guy, okay?" Steve begged. "We can explain everything to you after that."
, if it’s all the same to you, I’d like to introduce your compatriots,” Tony said, dripping with the kind of sarcastic false sincerity he’d had mastered since their very first semester at MIT.  “If you don't mind, of course.”
"My dad has a few friends at the Bureau," Gwen said, her face falling a second later. "And also because there's circumstantial evidence that the Spider-Man had contact with Toomes shortly before he was arrested, so… as soon as my dad heard about that he pounced on it."
“Sure thing.”
Peter suddenly heard Dad say, his heart lurching at how worried he sounded. "
"You haven't answered me," Steve said as he raised his head again. "
"Ah huh," Tony said. "And so… after Hank Pym put out the word that he was looking for someone to break into his own house, you jumped at the chance?"
As it was, Steve hadn't been able to sleep more than an hour or so at a time since the battle. What sleep he did manage to get was restless, like he was just waiting for something else horrible to happen.
"Yeah, well he was right."
"You think they've got any aircraft that are space-capable?" asked Carol. "I mean, that one that almost got Steve was an X-302 plain as day."
"Oh, but you'd be okay, right, Mr Super Soldier?" Tony snapped, his shoulders sagging when Steve's eyebrows knitted together. "I'm sorry, honey. I'm just…"
Steve's dewy cheeks flushed pink as he shifted on his feet. "In the hangar you looked like you were upset, so… I just wanted to make sure that everything was okay."
"Oh, yeah, I'm sure it does," Gwen replied. "Thank you, though. My dad would've flipped if I would've broken my computer only six weeks into the school year."
Steve's words, meant to offer comfort to his distressed friend, still hit Tony as hard as a sledgehammer.
"Copy that," said Steve as they lifted off. As soon as they were through the Wakandan force shield and on their way, Steve switched on the autopilot and tipped his head back, running a shaky hand through his hair as James located the emergency radio broadcast.
Steve's heart felt as heavy as a lead ball as he made his way down the hall and out to his motorcycle, pausing before he started the engine. If he was half as brave as he liked to think he was he would just admit to his teammates how he was spending his afternoons and just get it over with, instead of sneaking around all the time like a cat burglar or something.
"Hey, Nat," answered Steve. He wasn't really in the mood for company, but he wasn't about to tell her that. "What's up?"
Peter patted his right jacket pocket, the ring he'd helped Dad make for Papa sitting right where he'd put it.
Actually, on second thought, if the recent nightmares he'd been having were any indication, then maybe not. Waking up shivering with his sheets drenched in sweat after dreaming that his body was falling apart like a dry leaf was
And if that was the case, then all Steve had to do was wait. Hopefully just a few more seconds.
"Hey, buddy!" he exclaimed as he stepped inside, Peter's brief moment of panic that Dad had somehow come by himself after all squashed as soon as he saw Steve, his hand tightly holding Dad's.
Steve sniffed, swiping at his near-useless eyes. "I'm—I don't know, sweetheart, and I'm—I'm so sorry. I didn't—Tony, I'm—" He lifted his head as the emergency vehicle's siren began to sound, whisking his best friend off to the hospital. Steve had felt him breathe in as he'd carried him out of the aircraft so he knew Bucky was still alive, but he had no way of knowing how badly he was hurt or if he'd ever be able to fly again.
"If we want to concentrate the fighting in one place, that's probably the best way," said Natasha. "It'll also bottleneck their advance, which should slow them down a bit."
"Well, thanks for helping me get ready. I'm still not really used to wearing suits."
“Gee.  Thanks for the vote of confidence,” Tony muttered.  “Got any suggestions on how I can do that, Mr Relationship Expert?”
"Aways so sensitive," Tony murmured. His lips continued down the column of Steve's throat as Steve fumbled with Tony's shirt, then his undershirt, finally dropping them both onto the growing pile of clothing. Then he slid his hands under Tony's gloriously round ass, hauling him up and carrying him over to the bed, laying him down onto the freshly washed sheets. He crawled up over him, looking into his husband's—his
"Sam's right, Stevie," said Bucky. "What's up?"
Tony huffs out a sharp breath, throwing up his hands.  “Christ, Pete, what’re you wanting me to say?  Yes, I looked at the guy’s face.”
“Sure thing, bud.”
“Um… ‘cause unless you can find someone else who’s making these explodable bullets, then I’d say attacking our own Special Forces is pretty horrible!” stated Peter.  “That means someone knew they were there and tried to take them out!”
"Yeah, we're ready. Is Pete still asleep?"
"Mmm," said Bucky, poking his sharp elbow into Steve's side. "Seems like you've already got one though. I swear, Stevie, I've never seen you like this before. It's like you're in a trance every time the guy shows his face. I was even embarrassed for you back there!"
Tony could still feel the imprint in his throat left behind from his heart, and the deep, visceral ache from his knotted stomach as he and Steve had clung to each other's hands, waiting for Peter to emerge from the portal. If he'd been able to think a bit more clearly in that moment—impossible, of course, but hindsight was always twenty-twenty—Tony wouldn't have been as surprised that it took Peter a few extra seconds to step through. As much as both he and Steve believed that their boy was reckless at times, which Tony supposed came with the territory of being an enhanced teenager, Peter did usually take at least
But, based on the massive bomb that Uncle Thor dropped when he blasted himself onto the Tower right before Papa left, and what Peter had overheard while Papa was down in Namibia, he wasn't surprised that the team had a lot to discuss. He only wished that he could be in on it, instead of having to watch—or listen—from the sidelines. Again.
Fury tilted his head.  “Did you not just hear me?  I just told you that area is extremely precarious, so—”
"I agree, Sam," Tony said, double-checking his readings. "Vitals are good here."
And while Steve still wasn't sure if he agreed, he also knew better than to argue.
As long as they could pry it out of the government's sticky hands, of course. According to Grandpa, the government had in their possession more than enough of the stuff to not only power the individual satellites, but also create a big enough containment vessel for the main power source that would—hopefully—be strong enough to prevent anyone from tampering with it.
“Uh huh.”  Handing Dad his towel, Peter jumps into the water, gasping for breath as he resurfaces.  Then he slides on his goggles and pushes off from the wall.  The pool is slightly longer than the one at the Y, which Peter realises means it’s measured in metres instead of yards.

He tightened his arms around Tony's pillow, wishing so badly that it was Tony instead, and was then immediately wracked with guilt at the very thought. Because he knew exactly why Tony wasn't in the bed with him.
“Papa?” he said, his sweet voice laced with such awe and wonder that tears instantly welled in Steve’s eyes, spilling down his cheeks before he even knew they were there.  “Is this—?  Are you—?”
"The suit performed beautifully, sweetheart," he said as he pressed their foreheads together. "Better than I could've hoped. I'm just—not quite used to it yet."
“I’ve got it done, Obie,” Tony interrupted.  He took advantage of Obie’s temporary shock to twist out of his grasp, sucking in a deep lungful of air.  He’d always
“Ah, a bunch of beefy, wanna-be NFL players high on their own testosterone,” Tony scoffed.  “That entire gang wouldn’t know their heads from their asses unless you were there to remind ‘em.”
"Dad!" Peter exclaimed as he bolted upright, his face flushing hot. "We don't—she doesn't, I mean, her entire family was there!"
"Cool. See ya."
Tony let out a sharp gasp, his lower lip shaking as his tortured eyes met Steve’s.
If only he could keep her at his side every single minute of every single day. Then he would maybe,
"His name's Peter," Steve spat out, his hands clenched into tight fists at his side. "His name is Peter, and he's the sweetest, most genuine kid that I've ever met in my life, who misses his dad with every single one of his waking minutes, and—" The rest of Steve's words died on his lips as he took in the expression on Phillips's grizzled face, one of shock mixed with anguish.
"Yeah, well, I don't think I'll be doing it again anytime soon," muttered Peter with a huff.
"How 'bout I suck you off first, hmm?" he murmured into Steve's ear. "Take the edge off a bit?"
"He asked me to tell you that he hopes you're feeling better, and that he misses you."
"Not too bad, buddy," Tony said. "They didn't wake you up to talk to me, did they?"
"Well, before you go diving in headfirst you just think about how your ma might react once she finds out you're lusting after a Stark, okay?" Bucky said, not without a hint of snark. "The guy may be good-looking but he's got enough baggage for a trip to the moon and back, so… maybe that'll be enough to help you think twice about it."
“Cool,” said Tony, thanking his lucky stars that he’d had the foresight to link JARVIS’s programming into the security cameras inside the warehouse.  “Tell ya what.  How long do we hold onto those video archives in the warehouse?”
"I love you," he murmured, hissing as Tony took Steve's cock in his hands, slicking it up with the lube before lining it up. As soon as he felt himself breach Tony's body, Steve dropped his head back, moaning wantonly up to the ceiling as he gripped Tony's hips. Tony felt
He shoved Steve's arm away, clearing his throat as he rolled onto his side. "Now, if you wanna say 'I told you so', then just do it now and get it over with. But don't you even think about trying to take me anywhere I don't wanna go, you got that?"
"Whoa!" Bucky said as Steve pitched forward, grabbing onto Steve's arms. "Steve, are you okay?"
"Tony…" Steve said, dropping his chin to his chest when Tony tilted his head, giving him his best rendition of Peter's puppy-dog eyes. "All right, but I don't think I'll be able to get any sleep. Not with…"
"Yeah, little guy, everything's fine," Steve said after a short pause. "Dad and I just have to make a quick trip to D.C. tomorrow night, we have a meeting to attend on Monday morning."
"Now, how 'bout we swerve onto something a bit more fun, hmm?" Sam said as he leaned forward. "About those Mets…"
And who else had been snapped? Dad obviously hadn't been, but had Papa? Uncle Bucky? Gwen? Ned?
"Good boy," Tony murmured. "Now, we've got a little over two hours before we need to go get Pete, so go on and get all hot and sweaty while I go and daydream about getting you all hot and sweaty. Okay,
was the effect that Peter had on people. He was like a bright ray of sunshine on a cloudy day, spreading happiness and joy to anyone who was lucky enough to encounter him.
"JARVIS," he said, grateful when his voice didn't crack. "Can you call Tony please?"
Tony's heart gave a painful lurch. "We can figure something else out if we get to that point, yeah?" '
He wonders if Phillips is watching.  And if he is, what he’s thinking.  With the angry words that Steve shouted at him during their last conversation, he wouldn't be surprised if Phillips wanted nothing more than to completely wash his hands of Steve.
"Well, if nothing else, you sure look damn good in it," Tony added. "Not that you ever don't, but you know what I mean."
And since Steve absolutely despised the crutches that he had been forced to use in order to get around the penthouse, he decided to forgo them as well. They were noisy, and made his armpits sore, and there were hopefully enough handholds between the bed and the bathroom for him to avoid having to use them.
In that moment, both Steve and Tony had abandoned all pretense of trying to pretend that everything was normal and had pounced on their sweet, precious boy, trying to pour an entire year's worth of hugs into one huge family embrace. Steve had even been so overwhelmed that for a second or three he had been seriously tempted to just take his boys and run. Away from Wakanda, away from all of the battles and armies, and the genocidal maniacs hell-bent on destroying half the universe.
Then maybe, just maybe, with the Tesseract returned to SHIELD’s control and all of the HYDRA moles flushed out from their hiding spots—
That had been two nights ago, and ever since then both Peter and Tony had been bending over backwards to take care of Steve, and spoiling him completely rotten in the process. Tony had even already made Steve a new wedding ring, spending several hours in the lab to make sure it was as identical as possible to the one HYDRA stole from him, which made him even more determined to not wake Tony from his sound sleep just because he needed to use the bathroom.
"Well, I guess I'll see ya around, Captain."
said Image Papa, so petulantly that Peter cringed.
looks. "Spoken like a true adolescent boy," he said, his eyebrows all scrunched together. "No, buddy, I'm not afraid in the slightest."
A pause followed, like Obie was daring him to back down.  “Well, okay,” he finally said.  “As long as it doesn’t go any longer than that.  Don't want the Army to start thinking that they need to run back to Hammer Industries or something.”
Steve stared into Tony's eyes for several seconds before giving a brief nod. "Okay. Thank you."
"Oh no!" gasped Peter, shaking his head in a feeble attempt to clear it as Chief Stacy's body hit the wall with a sickening
"Yeah," Steve murmured, swiping at his eyes as he glanced back at the tunnel, shaking his head at how something so incredibly technological could be locked inside such a simple ugly brown van. "That was—that was—"
"Just a gut feeling, what Steve would call an instinct," said Tony. "I'm gonna be looking over Beck's stuff again tonight, but at the moment—"
"It's not gonna do us any good to get bogged down in what ifs, Steve," Sam said firmly. "Let's just take care of the obvious problem, all right?"
Not that Tony was an expert or anything, but in his pre-Peter life he had borne witness to more than his fair share of desire enhanced by a stiff drink or three, and it was a lot nicer than Tony was willing to admit to see a similar thing in Steve's eyes unencumbered by the influence of alcohol.
Of course it will.  That’s kinda the point.
"Wait, what?" he exclaimed, giving his head a quick shake. "Uncle Thor lost an eye? What the hell happened to him, was it Loki?"
Picking up his stack of stuff,
"Yeah," Steve croaked. "Go—go ahead, Sam."
But apparently, just like HYDRA itself, Rumlow didn't like to die very easily.
"No, it's not," agreed Steve, his tone suggesting that he suspected what Tony was implying and did not like it. "Which means our objective is still to find Thanos and take him out."
He'd been doing a lot of that lately, the enjoying of things that he'd never before had the time or the means to enjoy. Simple things like taking a bath together with his husband at the end of a long day, and working in the garage with his son, who, despite the fact that he was growing as fast as an out-of-control weed, was as healthy as he could possibly be.
. That was her name—gave a nod. "He fought very bravely, like you. You should be proud."
"Clint's fine at the moment," Natasha cut in. "He and Pietro are playing cards in the living room. Or napping. One of the two." She leaned forward, placing a comforting hand on his upper arm. "Do you feel like talking about it?"
A bad dream.
Nothing like going into the trial of the decade as united as they could possibly be, right?
"Yeah," Sam piped up from the opposite end of the counter. "Damn sneaky kid! I caught him trying to swipe one of these drumsticks right off the platter!"
And the first thing he had noticed—after the echoes of Hulk’s thundering roars had died down, at least—were the bright blue eyes of Steve Rogers staring down at him, glassy with tears as relief washed across his grime-covered, but still-gorgeous face.
"You really shouldn't listen to silly rumours," Gwen said, sharply enough to cut through the blood rushing past Peter's ears. "And besides that, I highly doubt the
"All right," he finally said. "We'll do it."
"Steve?" he asked as his belly swooped in fear. "Steve, are you still there?"
Apparently vibranium didn't appreciate being used as a punching bag.
Some father he was.
“Yes, thank you,” says Dad.  “I’m pretty sure you just made the kid’s year.”
At least he wasn't the only one concerned for Tony's welfare.
"All right, all right," Steve said, holding up his hand. He cleared his throat again, his eyes sweeping around his teammates all gathered in a circle and ending on Tony, who gave him a single nod.
His list taken care of, Steve tucked it back into his pocket and carefully sat back down, gripping the edge of the countertop as he tried to get a hold of himself.  His heart was still thudding against his ribcage in a staccato rhythm, like he’d just finished one of his morning runs, and he could tell his face was still bright pink, if the waves of heat idly spreading across his chest were any indication.
"Oh boy, Control this is… well… this is just really damn fast!" he cried.
"Okay, so…?" Tony prompted once they were seated. Steve could tell that he was frustrated and trying to hide it. He had been bugging Steve to talk with Sam ever since the water monster attack, and then even more so after Peter's horrible nightmare, but Steve kept insisting that he was fine, that he could handle things on his own, just like he always had.
In fact, they still didn't agree on the proper way to squeeze toothpaste from the tube, which was just stupid because
"JARVIS!" Steve said, his heart in his throat. "JARVIS, where's Peter?"
Tony rasped as Steve broke away from his mouth to trail kisses down his jaw to his neck, sucking on the lightly stubbled skin of his pulse point. Tony's fingers worked themselves into Steve's thick blond hair as his hands slid down Tony's sides to his ass, lifting him to straddle his lap.
"We're gonna figure it out, little guy," Steve said, a lot more calmly than he felt. "Somehow, we'll figure it out, because that's what we do."
Steve gave a sigh; he'd been hoping Tony wouldn't ask that. "I'd like to. He seems sincere enough, and if he really thought that Peter was Spider-Man he could've arrested him or even gone to the press right after the attack at the theatre, but—"
"Dad, just stop arguing with Grandpa, okay?" Peter said, his lower lip shaking. "It's not gonna change anything."
"Well, we can hope, right?" Steve said as he kissed Tony's forehead. "Rest now. I'll come back once your soup's done, but call me if you need anything before then, okay? Please?"
Wouldn't they be able to scrub the ashes clean from Tony's hands, and somehow knit them back together into his beloved boy?
Once again Gwen's cheeks flushed that deep pink colour, and she looked down at her tray. "Well, you're the first boy I've ever had over to the house, so… I think part of it was Dad just trying to scare you a bit. Seeing if you were… worthy of me or something."
An actual smile stretched across Tony's lips, the first Steve had seen on him all morning.
"I guess as long as Sam's okay with it," he finally said. "And as long as you can listen to him, 'cause he's gonna be in charge until we get Steve back."
"Yeah. Can't imagine why," said Uncle Bucky. "Jesus, that makes our 1940's medicine sound high-tech!"
At least, aside from the nightmares that had plagued him almost every single night.
"What?" Steve said, whipping his head around just in time to see what appeared to be a black hole forming near the destroyed force shield. Instinctively, he raised his shield, his heart jumping into his throat as he waited to see what he hoped he was wrong about.
"Yeah, we got it!" exclaimed Peter as he flipped to a landing. "Way to go, Uncle Bucky!"
"I will," Peter murmured. "And, Gwen, I gotta tell you, um… I… ah—"
"That's normal, Tony," Bruce said from the opposite side of the tub, preparing what appeared to be a splint for Peter's hand. "Even lukewarm water will feel uncomfortably hot at first against frozen skin, but he needs to get in there as soon as possible."
sputtered Strange, still staring at Peter in fascination. "Does this have anything to do with his coma?"
Tony shook his head, shuddering as he pressed his face into his pillow. "Loving me is a losing game, honey," he murmured. "Better to quit while you're ahead."
"Tony?" Steve said over the comm. "How's everything looking down there?"
"Oh, really? Well, you'd be one tall-ass hobbit, that's for sure," Sam said, laughing as he tore off a chunk of his blueberry scone. "So, how many breakfasts have you had, then?"
In fact, if he had to guess, he would've said that they were waiting for just the right moment to strike. Kinda like how Dr Strange had been waiting for the right moment to bring them to Wakanda.
A few days that seemed a lot longer than just a few days.
"Yeah," Peter stated as he slid his arm into the contraption up to his elbow. "Okay, okay. I'm ready."
“I’m shutting down the company’s weapons’ division, effective the very second the last of our outstanding orders are fulfilled,” Tony said, ignoring Pepper’s shocked gasp.  “And I’ll need this statement ready for release at that precise time.  Can you do that for me?”
"Right," Tony said with a sigh.
"Copy that," Steve said softly. "We'll be ready."
And the fact that they
"You're such a sap," Tony said as he clinked their glasses together and took a sip. The beer was rather good, smooth and rich with none of the "beer" aftertaste that Tony didn't like. Before Steve, Tony could have counted on one hand the amount of times that he'd actually drank beer, always preferring Scotch as his drink of choice, and not the cheap stuff either.
“Tony—”
"Well, then I guess we'd better get going. Let's get this over with."
And, knowing Papa, he probably believed that he actually could will it to be true.
Sam gave a nod, leaning forward. "You know, I just gotta say, that kid is absolutely brilliant. He hadn't even had a hold of Bucky's datapad for three minutes and he'd already broken through the Air Corps firewall."
'Cause Captain America never took no for an answer. Not when a yes would be better.
"Are ya hungry?" Tony asked once they broke apart. "Pretty sure Clint was planning on heating up some frozen pizzas for lunch."
"Yes sir, as well as the proper training of the pilots who will be charged with delivering and positioning the satellites," JARVIS said. "That is the only factor which dips the odds below one hundred percent."
"It should be," Peter said. "There's not a single person in my class who doesn't think that Uncle Thor's just totally awesome, and they all think the rest of the Avengers are pretty cool too. In fact, Gwen was just telling me that her little brother talks about you guys all the time around his own friends, and I'm sure he's not the only one. This has to be just a subset of the government who just wants to control everything."
"A new hammer?" asked Peter, his voice muffled against his father's chest. His heart rate was finally starting to return to normal. "Can he do that?"
"Aw, Dad, it should only be a few more minutes," said Peter. "You can make it, can't you?"
Peter's shoulders dropped as he frowned, rolling his eyes. "Oh, come on, really? We can
"Hmm," Tony said with a smirk. "I'm sure you could entice me, a hot, sweet guy like yourself. And I'm also sure that something like a blowjob would only add to that enticement."
"Oh, man," Quill said, his head tilting towards Gamora as he began to blow apart, his hand clinging to hers until the very last second.
“I’ll have to think of something,” Tony muttered as he started searching for the car keys he knew had to be somewhere.  He finally located them down between the cushions on the couch in the lab, where he had been spending his nights ever since Steve left.  For someone who had always adamantly refused to spend the night with a lover, Tony had gotten so used to having Steve in his bed with him—he liked to joke that Steve’s fast metabolism made him the perfect space heater—he had found that he now couldn’t sleep without him.  Couldn't sleep without Steve’s heavy arm anchoring Tony to him, and the comforting sound of Steve’s slow, steady heartbeat lulling him to sleep like a lullaby.
"Not sure that they're much good for anything without the suit," muttered Lang. "But yeah, I think he does."
"Which means that you and I need to get into that kitchen before the boys take it over again," Natasha said to Wanda. "Otherwise, there's no telling when those pies will get done."
"Wanna talk about it?"
"Hmph," grumbled Mr Stacy. "Following rules. And which rules does he follow, exactly? Who gets to decide what rules the Avengers follow, hmm?"
Tony dropped his head, pressing his palm to his chest.
Sam jerked his head to the two huge pots of potatoes cooling on the stove. "Soon as those are mashed and the gravy's done simmering, we should be ready."
Setting down the notebook, Steve grabbed his cowl and picked up his shield, sliding it into place on his left arm. He was wearing a brand-new Captain America uniform that Tony had just finished making for him the previous night. The rest of the team had new uniforms too, including a new Spider-Man suit for Peter and suits for Wanda and Pietro Maximoff, who Steve had allowed to join the team with the understanding that they wouldn't be assisting with missions until he believed they were ready.
“Goddamnit,” Tony muttered as the simulated sparks faded away.  He’d already checked the missile’s fuel line, the outer hull construction, and the control chip for the separation sequence and found nothing amiss, which meant that the problem either had to be inside the missile design itself, or—
"Cap!" yelled Uncle James. "Cap, we have incoming!"
"Well, all right," said Natasha, a slight smirk playing on her lips. "But you know what usually happens when we leave Bucky, Sam, and Clint idle for too long."
Settling on one of his nicer t-shirts and a pair of dark grey pants, Tony grabbed some clean underwear and headed towards the bathroom he shared with Peter. His throat tightened as his eyes landed on Peter's shampoo bottle sitting on the shelf in the shower, tipped over onto its side like it always was. His washcloth was still there too, draped over the faucet, and the rubber duck he'd had since he was three, sitting just where he'd left it.
"Don't you come near him, you understand me?" Tony warned, his right repulsor aimed directly at Steve's chest. "You goddamn HYDRA scum, you stay away from my son!"
(See the end of the chapter for
"Your family," Uncle Bucky murmured. "That's… that's…" He broke off, letting out a kind of morbid chuckle before turning very serious. "Peter, I don't—I used to think that the Starks were… well… that they were—"
"You know that I won't," Steve said quickly. "I'm just glad he's okay."
"Uhh, far as I know your girl's back in New York," Uncle Bucky said, obviously confused. "It's only her dad that came with us. Why?"
he thought as he turned instead to the task list he had made that morning, crossing off his meeting with General Arnold.
"Tony?" Steve asked. "What're you thinking?"
It was almost as though Phillips was being encouraged to do so, but why and by whom Tony had no idea. Rhodey was a possibility, but since his position within the Air Corps was rather precarious as well Tony highly doubted he would risk it further by bringing up the personal life of one of the Corps' civilian contractors to his boss, no matter how close he and Tony were.
"Yeah, I got that impression," said Steve. "I'd barely stepped inside his room and he was already wrinkling his nose at my uniform."
“Nope!” Tony yelped, raising his palm at the screen.  “You have now lost every single right that you had to call me that.  From now on, I am only Mr Stark to you.  Or better yet, Iron Man.”
Peter nodded as he opened the truck door, setting one foot down on the pavement and jumping back just as fast when a fancy sports car suddenly screeched to a halt in the parking spot right next to them. Peter frowned as Flash Thompson climbed out of the car, tossing him a wink as he slammed the door closed and sauntered towards the school.
“Yeah, you might be right,” he says.  “Maybe I should just wait and see, hmm?”
And, knowing them, they probably weren't planning on telling him how the hearing went either.
"Yeah, you and Papa said there'd be no need," interrupted Peter. "Especially if it worked on Uncle Bucky."
“Oh, yeah,” Papa said with a contented sigh.  “Now this is what I could do all day.”
"Yes, please, JARVIS," Steve cut in. He gave Tony an apologetic look, earning a dismissive shrug in response. "Thank you."
"Steve?" Tony repeated, his voice frantic. "Honey, do you copy?"
"Turkey and Greece," Peter said quickly, pride welling up inside him when he noticed Papa's smile.
He cut off with a loud groan as Tony took Steve's cock into his mouth, wrapping his slick fingers around the base as he took him as far as he could. Steve was big, and not even Tony could deep-throat him for long, but by the way Steve was gasping and shuddering above him, he didn't seem to care.
Well, at least Peter had one father who was strong now. Super-soldier strong.
The day that had lived in infamy ever since.
Which means that by the time he hits the turn, he’s in so much pain that he can barely see, much less force himself to keep raising his arm out of the water.
"Steve?" Tony said over the comm, followed immediately by a repulsor blast aimed at the water monster's head. "Babe, is he breathing?"
😣 = the angst is killing me!
Making his way to his lab, Tony retrieved the nanite case he'd finished constructing while Steve was down in Namibia and pressed it onto his chest over his t-shirt. He had designed the case to adhere to both fabrics and skin, and was currently trying to figure out which option he preferred.
Steve's blue eyes crinkled at the corners, his lips curling into the slightest of smiles. "Yes, I think so. We'll arrange for transportation back to California for you, Mr Lang."
—Tony dug the pads of his fingers into Steve's biceps, feeling the lines of hard muscle hidden beneath his Army dress shirt. Steve was so incredibly strong, but Tony worried that even he was going to eventually falter under the enormous pressure of trying to battle all the demons that life kept throwing at them. Pretty much ever since he'd been found in the ice it had been one thing after another, with very few breaks in between.
“Probably more than you might suspect, Tony,” Steve murmured.  He knew Tony was pretty concerned how this whole shakedown was going to affect company morale, but the way Steve saw it, knowing for certain that someone was no longer working for a war criminal would certainly do nothing but increase morale, wouldn’t it?  Even more so since Tony had at least a ten-item list of new projects he was going to launch almost as soon as the arrest was made.
And less than three seconds later, he was out.
“Agent Brock Rumlow is the commander of the STRIKE team, sir,” answered JARVIS.
Peter rolled his eyes, plopping back onto the floor. "Dad, I know that. But in all the times that I've been around Mr Stacy, I've never, ever had that ice-cubes-down-my-back feeling that I always get around the bad guys. Not even once, not even when he was ranting about the Avengers the very first time that I met him. So there's no way he could be a HYDRA agent, 'cause if he was, I'd know."
"I've been waiting for this!" Rumlow screamed as he landed next to Steve. He swung his right arm, connecting his fist directly in the middle of Steve's chest and sending him flying backwards into some kind of merchant stand as several nearby vendors and customers scattered into the retreating crowd. Steve gasped for air, trying desperately to stamp down the panic he always felt whenever he got the wind knocked out of him.
"I do very much apologise for the very untimely interruption, sir," JARVIS suddenly cut in. "But there is a new memo coming in from the Department of Damage Control, and it is marked with extreme urgency."
Tony glanced over at Steve, raising an eyebrow in question.
"Please what, sweetheart? Tell me what you want."
"As long as it's okay with Uncle Bucky, Peter," Papa said sternly. "I don't know, he and Uncle Sam may already have plans for that day."
Besides, Steve had already made up his mind, and already discussed it individually with Bucky, Thor, and Bruce, and the rest of the team as a group. At the moment his plan was that if something were to happen to him, Thor would immediately find Peter and transport him to Asgard, leaving him in the protection of his guardian Heimdall before returning for Tony. Once Peter and Tony were both safe, Thor would then return to the Tower or Compound and assess the situation, continuing to evacuate the non-enhanced team members if he thought it viable while Bucky and Bruce/ Hulk attempted to hold off any potential opposition. Once everyone was sequestered on Asgard, they would then monitor what was going on on Earth via Heimdall and formulate additional plans from there.
“They end up being life-changing,” Tony finished.  He brought Steve’s hand to his lips, kissing his knuckles.  “Pretty sure I’ve experienced something like that myself a time or three.  But hey, that’s that whole saying about hindsight, right?”
Which meant that once again, Steve was left with nothing to do but wait.
"I'm not trying to babysit you," Steve cut in. "I just… don't want you to be alone right now, okay?"
Regardless of the reasoning, aside from a few mob-like skirmishes that George Stacy and some of his FBI friends had taken care of, with a bit of help from Clint and Natasha, the Avengers as a team hadn't had to worry too much about keeping in shape.
“Quiet, please,” calls the announcer.  A few seconds later, the cheers of the crowd fall silent, until all Steve can hear is the slight whoosh of the water as it washes over the tops of the gutters, and the thudding of his own heart.
Both of which were impossible, from how Peter saw it. Even if they had somehow managed to observe Papa reentering the atmosphere, Captain Barnes's reentry point wasn't the same as Papa's, so firing at Papa's reentry point wouldn't have resulted in anything besides a really bright light and a bunch of frightened birds.
A reality that really slammed home the day he received a phone call from a doctor at the hospital, telling him that a baby had been born earlier that night whose mother had named him as the father.
"Mom makes the best cakes," Gwen said. "People even order them for parties and stuff, so I think you're gonna love it."
"Well, then I'm glad I saved you the trip," said Steve.
Steve nodded, swallowing hard. "Thank you."
Or that Tony couldn’t maybe use an hour or two to himself, as foreign as that might sound.
it was, Tony," Steve said. "And he also said that so far none of the SHIELD scientists have a clue what it was either, so—"
He felt Steve's bandaged fingers under his chin, turning his head back to look into his eyes. "Tony, I'm telling you right now that we're going to do this," he said. "I know it may not seem like it, but there are a lot more of us who feel the way you do than you might think, and I know we can do it. I
"I never said it was normal!" Peter snapped, throwing a quick glance at Gwen's partially opened door. When no footsteps came running to investigate, he sucked in a deep breath, squeezing his hands into fists as he tried to calm down. "I never said any of this was normal. My family's about as not-normal as you can get, but hey, most of the time I just roll with it. But tell me this: if it'd been your dad that HYDRA had taken, and you knew they were doing horrible things to him, and you also knew that you could help him, but that if you told anyone else it would put all of the rest of them in danger, wouldn't you have done the same thing?"
Even Brock said he might show up, which Steve would really appreciate.  Ma didn't seem all that thrilled with Brock when Steve introduced her to him a couple of weeks ago, but Steve is hoping that’s only because she’s still getting used to him dating guys instead of gals.
"JARVIS, can you please soundproof the room?" Steve asked as he kicked the door closed, his blue eyes already darkening in the dim, bluish light. Steve cupped Tony's cheek in his right hand as Tony's legs wrapped around his waist, his body already buzzing with electricity. He absolutely
"Base, please confirm receipt of transmission?" he barked into his comm. "The damn thing's getting really close!"
"Yeah, Ned, I know that," Peter said, rather shortly. "But the leader in Moscow was still in control of everyone. Those other countries' leaders were just puppet governments installed by Moscow in rigged elections."
“Thirteen?” Steve says, raising an eyebrow.  “So you think that—?”
"Can she keep it up for that long?" Dad asked.
"So do you think I should get her like a whole bouquet, or just a couple of flowers?" Peter asked as they squeezed inside the tiny floral shop across the street from the police station. He had asked if he could buy Gwen some flowers before their date, which Steve had thought was very sweet of him, but since he and Tony didn't really celebrate Valentine's Day—Tony thought it was too commercialised and silly, and Steve wasn't the biggest fan of it either—Steve hadn't thought about just how busy the place would be, or just how many flowers would be crammed inside such a small store, the combined scents of which were so overwhelming that it was already starting to give him a headache.
It was also a project that Obie had no clue existed, as Tony had kept all of his tinkering on it off of the main Stark Industries servers.  Only the pharmaceutical scientists, himself, and Peter were aware of its existence.
"Well, it helps when you play a lot with someone who can run really fast," said Peter. "And I've even managed to tag him a few times."
No.  The only swimmers Steve feels could challenge him for the gold are his teammate Bucky, and Alexei Shostakov, the new champion from Russia who seems hell-bent on taking over the loud-mouthed jerk slot from Johann Schmidt.  Steve narrows his eyes, studying Shostakov’s face as he laughs at something Batroc said, and wondering how it’s possible that there could be another 100 freestyle swimmer who’s as bullish and arrogant as Schmidt was.
No longer at all cold, Peter turned back to his panel just as the ship veered to the right so sharply that he nearly tipped over. Dad grabbed onto Peter's arm to stabilise him, glancing down at him in alarm as he checked over the instruments.
Which they easily could, or the discussion would've already been moot. With how frequent Steve's goofy timeline nightmares had been coming lately, Tony had the eerie feeling that something big was about to happen, and soon. Thor, Bruce, and Loki had finally taken off with the Tesseract in their newly repaired ship about a week ago, and while Tony hadn't expected to hear anything from them until they got back, every day that passed with no word was only making his twitchiness, as Peter would call it, that much worse.
Bucky glanced up at him then, his tight jaw twitching. "Y-yeah," he stammered softly. "Thanks."
"Is breá liom tú," he whispered, trailing his thumb across Tony's cheekbone. "Is breá liom tú an oiread sin. Inis dom conas is féidir liom tú a shásamh."
I am sorry 😢
Gwen tilted her head, eyeing him for a few heartbeats before reaching for his popcorn bucket. "All right. I guess the timing isn't really all that great, huh?"
"Up," Tony suddenly heard from next to him, nearly sending him off the bed. Swallowing hard, Tony glanced down to find Peter staring right up at him, his huge eyes full of confusion.
"Think you might've cracked this one, honey," Tony said with a slight frown. "Again."
"I think we all are," said Tony. "I think Pete's anxious for us to get home too."
"No," answered Papa, his worry wrinkle on full display under his cowl. "And I don't like it."
him. One because he'd honestly never had a successful romantic relationship in his entire life, and two, he just could not afford to get too distracted from his work. He and Peter had come way too far for Tony to jeopardise it all now just because he'd fallen under the spell of a pair of bright blue eyes.
He should’ve known that Natasha would be waiting for him, ready to pounce with her twenty questions on how his meeting with the Starks went yesterday afternoon.
“No, you shouldn’t’ve,” agreed Peter.
“Maybe,” said Tony.  “And you’ve got all the press releases ready to go, Miss Potts?”
"Right." Tony huffed out a sharp breath. "But then Pete came along and saw what I was doing, and he decided to take it about a hundred steps further."
If anything, Howard started drinking even more, leaving him even more vulnerable to the near-constant whispers from Obadiah Stane.  Whispers saying that unless Howard did something soon to “protect the company”, it was going to be yanked right out from beneath his feet.
"No, Tony, it's not," Steve said firmly. "There's no excuse for anyone who deliberately neglects their child, I don't care what the circumstances are."
"I'm not exactly sure, it's pretty complex," Gwen replied. "But if I had to guess, I'd say it's a communications link between him and…" She paused, squinting at the screen. "Does someone here wear hearing aids?"
"Well, we'll just have to deal with that once we're there," Steve said. "And like Fury said, the Avengers will be there as diplomatic liaisons, so too much of a show of force might send the wrong message. But I won't hesitate to call for backup if I think it becomes necessary."
"Why?" Peter asked. "Did something happen to New Asgard?"
"You never even saw a doctor once we came back from Afghanistan, sweetheart, so how can you be sure that there's nothing—"
Intellectually, Peter realised it was only a bill, which meant that it wasn't law yet and there was still the possibility that it wouldn't get passed. And, given the massive bill in which it was hidden, there would definitely have to be at least some debate on the subject.
"All right. I love you, buddy."
He felt Tony’s lips brush across the top of his shoulder.  “Okay, honey,” he murmured.  “How ‘bout we go back to sleep then, yeah?  It’s still pitch black outside.”
Peter's lips stretched into a smile without him even having to think. "Maybe. She's… definitely different."
If he had just gotten rid of Obie when he'd first thought about it, not too long after he had brought Peter home from the hospital, then maybe none of this would've happened. But he had been too afraid, too worried about possibly jeopardizing the company—and Peter's inheritance—that he didn't want to rock the boat. Despite all of his faults, Obie was a decent enough CFO, and Tony hadn't wanted to make any major changes to the company's infrastructure while he was still learning how to parent a very high-needs baby.
"Yeah, but then when it ended up being a lot more destructive than it should've been, they went and blamed Howard because he was the only scientist officially assigned to work on the tesseract," said Tony. He slumped into his chair, his fingers tight around Steve's. "He really was framed. And the guy who helped frame him is just sitting pretty over there in Merida, propped up by the very government that should've had him arrested."
"Damn right, Captain," said Major Lorne. "Whatever it takes."
"It does appear so, sir," answered JARVIS. "I am currently detecting no anomalies."
"Oh, yes. I noticed that last night, even," she said. "That little crinkle that you get above your nose is the exact same as your father's. But what I've also noticed, just in these last few minutes, is that you're a lot like my son as well. And I don't only mean because he was also a sickly child. I mean you're both kind, compassionate, and loyal."
Even so, Steve was rather proud at how well he’d managed to keep himself together in those harrowing seconds between Peter informing him that his father was on his way, and when Stark
"Yeah, that might be a bit difficult," Steve laughed. "But other than that, count on us around this time every night, okay?"
As soon as he hung up the phone Peter grabbed his notebook, flipping through the pages until he found the big question mark he'd scribbled there earlier. Of course it made a lot more sense for them to use an element to power their new satellite system that didn't require frequent replacement, and based on what he'd learned from Grandpa before everything started going to hell, the vibranium would work perfectly.
"Fine. Have it your way," he finally said. "My kid's probably stronger than you anyway."
He and Tony had just finished eating a light meal when there came a knock at the door.
"Oh, that's okay, I probably had more time to work on mine anyway," Peter said. "You can finish it now if you want."
Steve felt his cheeks flushing for the umpteenth time.  “Thanks, little guy.  You were right, this is a lot of fun.”
This holiday had been so good for the team. Not only had they all been working their fingers to the bone pretty much ever since the ice incident up at the Compound the previous summer, but Steve also hadn't quite realised just how low the overall team morale was getting until he noticed an immediate difference almost as soon as the jet departed New York City's airspace.
"Call the hospital!" Tony shrieked as he fumbled with the fingerprint authentication for the oxygen connection, swearing when his shaking fingers refused to cooperate. "Goddamnit Howard, didn't you fucking hear me? Pete's colder n' hell! He's dying!"
that! That was totally
Steve shook his head, his eyebrows knitting together into a frown. "Well, that's a relief. But it also doesn't make much sense. Does it?"
"Yes, it does," answered Steve. "Never thought I'd ever go through this again." He kept his eyes firmly on Peter as Ma directed Sam and Sharon to lift him into the capsule. The anteroom Sam had mentioned was already almost filled to capacity with Steve's Air Corps teammates, including the entire A-shift, B-shift, and most of the C- and D-shift pilots.
As soon as James turned around, Steve climbed up the ladder and into his cockpit, placing the drawing of his family right next to his altitude gauge. He stared at it intently as he pulled on his helmet, his oxygen mask dangling over his right shoulder.
"You know I don't mean it like that," Steve said with a sigh, reaching to cup Tony's cheek. "I'm only trying to keep you safe. That's all."
“Good.”  Dad pressed a kiss to the top of Peter’s head as the doors opened up into their penthouse apartment to the sound of JARVIS welcoming them home.  “Does pizza sound okay for dinner?”
"Well, too late," Tony stated. "And especially if you go and do dumb shit like that again. It's bad enough that you're up there five days out of seven, but still—"
“Wait,
"We sure are, sweetheart," Steve stated, as emphatically as he was able. "Whatever it takes."
"Well, we might beg to differ on that one," Clint piped up from behind Natasha, placing his hand on Wanda's shoulder. "Wanda here is pretty damn powerful, and I bet if she put her mind to it, she could at least put a couple of dents in the thing."
"Steve," Bruce suddenly said, startling him. "Steve, I'm really sorry, I know you're upset right now, but we've gotta get moving. This isn't over, and we—"
Which was perfectly fine with him. He would much rather hold onto his papa's "I've got you" than the rest of the pure hell he and Dad had endured inside that cave, the first level of apparently many to come.
"Not unless you count another goddamn riddle as 'useful'," grumbled Tony. "Said something to the effect of, if he tells me what happens, then it won't, or some other such bullshit."
But his final word was lost in a burst of static, one so loud that Steve flinched. He squeezed his eyes closed, breathing in deeply through his nose. He couldn't afford to lose control now.
“JARVIS is our UI butler that I told you about, huh, Steve?” added Peter.  “He runs our whole Tower!”
"Have you met him yet?" Bucky asked. "Tony's kid?"
Which is good.  Because Steve’s patience, never one of his strongest suits, is rapidly approaching its breaking point.  Dealing with such constant, unrelenting pain for the last four-plus years has been nothing short of hell, made a million times worse by his humiliating failure at the Olympics sixteen months ago.  Add to that Ma’s death, the mile-high stack of medical bills that he has yet to make a decent dent in, and his overall shattered trust in humanity thanks to his asshole ex-boyfriend has turned Steve into nothing more than a fragile shell of his former self.
"Check on the calendar of Quentin Beck, one of the R&D supervisors. I need to set up a one-on-one with him regarding his holographic proposal."
“Um—” Obie started, his jaw snapping closed when Steve shot him a glare.
said Davis. He pushed his glasses up the bridge of his nose, peering at the sheet of paper in front of him.
Especially after the events of the last year.
Peter never sees what sport he actually wins in, only that he does in fact win.  To him, the actual sport never matters too much, only his desire to excel in it.
Leave it to Steve, who had been just about as pure as freshly fallen snow before he met Tony, to quickly become the biggest tease Tony had ever been with.
"I'd like you to go to our room at the barracks," Steve said. "Ask Sam or Carol or Colonel Rhodes to open it up for you if you need to, but… at the back of my sock drawer there's a small, black box that's got your ring inside it, and—and I'd really love it if you could find it and put it on for me. I want to imagine you wearing it when I look at the picture of the three of us."
“Buddy, I know that,” Tony said carefully.  “I know all of that already.  But—”
Steve cupped Tony's cheek, pressing their foreheads together. "No, we can't, sweetheart, but we don't have to worry about it right this second either. Let's just try and enjoy this a bit first, okay?"
Steve gulped, forcibly squashing his panic demon back down. "I'm—I'm not, or I guess I don't mean to. It's just… Tony, we know that HYDRA knows about Peter, so if they really are tied in with our government then that means there are government officials out there who are either already aware of him, or they will be soon."
"You didn't see anything like this when you were in the tunnel, did ya, Cap?" Uncle Clint asked.
“Oh.  Uh huh,” Peter said, not without a touch of melancholy.  He crumpled up his chip bag and slid off the stool, picking up his backpack.  Then he stopped short, glancing between Steve and Tony like he was contemplating something.
"Yeah, I will," said Natasha. She smiled as Steve tossed his crushed-up bottle into the recycle bin. "Enjoy your run. Looks pretty nice out there today."
“Yeah, I do,” Steve says.  Because he definitely knows what that’s like.  He’s been living it for the past sixteen months.
can do, Tony. Us, as a team. Not just you. All right?"
"Okay, but that still doesn't explain why you didn't tell me?" The adrenaline coursing through Tony's veins was starting to wane, seeping from his body in spades and leaving him feeling like a wrung-out washcloth.
"No, you told me what you thought I wanted to hear," said Steve. He trailed his fingertips along Tony's cheekbone, the touch just as feather-light as he was strong. "Right?"
“It’s all right, honey, that’s just the interface connection,” Dad said softly.  He gave Papa’s hand a squeeze, cradling it between his own.  “Just try and relax, okay?”
"Steve," Natasha said as she came into the room. Steve had been holed up almost exclusively in Tony's lab since they'd been back, thinking that if he was surrounded by his husband's beloved equipment and bots it would help him stay more optimistic about his and Peter's safe return. So far it hadn't exactly worked like he'd hoped, but it was at least better than trying to sleep in his and Tony's bed by himself.
"Long as you're back by the beginning of August or so," he said once they had paused to catch their breath. "And preferably both in one piece."
"Do you think that the general, that he somehow—?"
"About as well as I think you should be doing," Sam said evenly. "I just want to make sure that you know that you're not alone here, okay?"
Gulping, Steve nodded, pressing another kiss to Tony's forehead. "JARVIS, can you please turn off the television?"
And while that didn't bother him, or at least not too much, it was just another reminder that people saw him as some sort of a hero, and saw the Avengers as the Earth's protectors. All of which meant that Steve couldn't afford to let them down.
“Mmm, been up past midnight loads of times,” Tony grumbled.  His beautiful plush lips curled into a smile as Steve set the computer on the bedside table and settled in next to him, draping his arm across his waist.
Tony huffed. "That's 'cause your suit learns and adapts from your thoughts, Pete! It's nanotechnology! Listening to thought commands is one of its perks!"
"You know that I do," Steve said, low and husky. "Tell me what you want, mo grá. Please."
“Tony, I can’t believe that incredible young man calls me ‘Papa’,” Steve said as Peter and Bucky began shadowboxing, causing Sam to burst out laughing.  “How in the hell did I get so lucky?”
It was as though the boy was literally wasting away. Most of the time in the hospital Peter had been shielded by his mass of blankets, but now, out in the open, it was painfully obvious to Steve just how thin he'd become.
"Stop," Bucky said as his spine went rigid, his head shaking frantically from side to side but his eyes still wide behind the glasses. "No, I don't wanna, please don't—!"
"Uh huh," Peter murmured. "'Night."
"Sounds good to me," said Steve. "I can't wait."
"I see," said Mr Stacy. "So then I suppose you don't agree with the theory that if the Avengers hadn't managed to piss off the god or alien or whoever-the-hell-it-was that brought all those…
"I'll tell you soon, okay?" he said, frowning when Steve's worry wrinkle deepened. "I promise. Just… not right now."
"Mmm, fine. I gotta put my Decathlon stuff away first."
"That's good, Scott," Steve said evenly. He was trying hard to hold onto his patience, especially since Tony would probably be waking up fairly soon. "So, the Quantum Realm?"
"Sounds good," Steve said. "Let me know when they get here."
"No, no, I'll get it," said Colonel Rhodes as he sat down next to Carol. "Long as you guys promise to quit whining about it."
"Well, I'm surprised you can't still hear Bucky with all the whooping and hollering he was doing," Wilson said, laced with amusement. "Guy's gonna scream himself hoarse before he even gets out there."
"Cause it's for the best. At least for now," Phillips said firmly. "Now, how much longer till the next satellite deploys?"
Peter wasn't about to stop hanging out with Gwen just because her father seemed to be a first-class jerk, but he did have to admit he hoped that she could come to the Tower next time. Peter knew Dad had already researched Mr Stacy exhaustively, and he was such a smooth-talking charmer that there'd be no way he'd ask Gwen such personal questions to her face.
Gamora rolled her eyes. "Peter—"
There was a short pause, as if JARVIS was contemplating Tony's statement. "I do recall Captain Rogers repeatedly expressing in the past that he has no interest in wearing armour, sir?"
“I mean it, Tony,” he adds.  “I can keep watch for a while.”
"All right," Steve said. He pulled Tony closer, tucking his head under his chin. "Even though the friend is a girl?"
this!"
"Well, young Peter was near death when I found them, and Tony was gravely injured, so they were first airlifted to the base hospital for rest and recovery, and once it was determined that Peter was well enough to be moved, we returned to the United States."
And managing to think of nothing else.
"As Captain Rogers so studiously noticed, this engine bell here is in fact a rocket booster that's designed for extra-atmospheric flight, otherwise known as space travel. As such, the aircraft itself has also been equipped with brand-new inertial dampening technology that will allow the pilot to manoeuvre easily through the vacuum of space without experiencing the massive G-forces that would otherwise cause him or her to black out. Now, I'm sure all you guys are pretty antsy to test this stuff out, so Colonel Phillips has asked me to let you know that while the Air Corps currently has no concrete plans to utilise these new features for actual space travel, I have been charged with developing simulations in which each pilot will be able to participate once they have been able to demonstrate superior proficiency with the normal operations of the aircraft."
The pain he had endured from losing Peter, the pain that he and Steve had struggled for an entire year to contain, was something that Tony wouldn't wish on anyone.
As soon as the Stacys were gone, Tony sank down onto the chair at his workstation, scrubbing a rough hand down his face. This was not at all how he had expected the evening to go.
Thank you so much for all of the lovely comments!  I’m so glad you guys are enjoying the story! 💗
"Thank you, sweetheart," Steve mumbled after a few minutes had passed, barely able to move his jaw enough to speak. He realised a few heartbeats later later that he needn't have bothered as Tony was already asleep, his hand cupping Steve's shoulder and a light smile on his full lips. Carefully, Steve shimmied down on the bed just enough to grab onto the blankets, pulling them up over them before pressing a final kiss to Tony's forehead and closing his eyes.
He was shocked that he'd even been able to stay conscious during Steve's mad firefight, given how long he'd held his breath during that final confrontation. Rhodey had explained to Tony that he'd asked Colonel Phillips for permission to join in the fight as soon as the missiles started flying, and while Tony knew that Rhodey had been one hell of a pilot before his accident, the fact that he'd still been able to hold his own—
"Yeah, it was actually Steve's idea, so we're running with it."
All that remained was for Steve to trust in his teammates, none of whom had ever come close to letting him down.
It was futile.  Just like when he had sunk to the bottom of the Arctic Ocean.
"Very good, sir. Oh, and there is also a message from Senator Davis, wishing to inform you that the final Damage Control convoy departed from Washington D.C. as scheduled."
"Hey," Tony murmured, just loud enough to be heard over the water splashing down on their bodies. He took Steve's left hand, placing the palm of it against his chest over his heart so Steve could feel his heartbeat. On the nights where Steve had nightmares, the first thing Tony always did for him once he was calmed down was to place his hand over his heart, showing Steve that yes, he was still alive and with him.
That plus the fact that the moonlight shining against Steve's glistening skin made him one of the most beautiful things Tony had ever seen almost made him climax right then and there, and he wasn't ready for it to be over just yet.
Steve's jaw was twitching like mad as he glanced down at Tony, his lips pursing at Tony's affirmative nod.
"But you said you saw Groot, right?" asked the raccoon, Rocket. "He was there?"
"Y, E, S," he said, his voice barely above a weak croak as he tapped in the letters, relief hitting him like a massive wave as he watched JARVIS's familiar code begin to fill his screen.
"Mmm," Peter grumbled. He was starting to wish that he had figured out a better cover story for Uncle Bucky than just being Papa's old friend from the war. Technically, Uncle Bucky was still an international fugitive, and it was only through the extraordinary abilities of Dad and Director Fury that he'd been able to basically hide in plain sight within their family ever since they brought him to the Tower. He wasn't technically confined to the Tower, but he never left it alone, always had his metal arm covered by a jacket or hoodie, and never was gone for long periods of time.
“There,” he murmured as he pressed down on a particularly sensitive spot on Steve’s scalp, earning a soft moan in response.  “Better now?”
"Don't listen to anymore of that bullshit? It's just gonna make you mad, honey, and it probably won't matter in the end anyway. I'd rather you go down to the gym and bust up your knuckles again than listen to those idiots blathering on all afternoon. JARVIS will let us know if anything important comes up, you know that."
“Tony!” he cries, trying not to panic.  “Tony, are you there?  Can you hear me?”
"Dad, look out!" Peter screamed as he took off running, jumping towards Thanos and capturing his left hand with a web, pulling against the gauntlet with all of his strength. "You're just nothing but a big huge bully! Why don't you pick on someone your own size?"
The conversation continued but Tony barely listened, too focused on his husband to pay more than the minimal amount of attention until Bruce and Helen arrived. Steve's eyes never left Tony's face as Helen conducted a quick initial assessment, starting two separate IV lines before giving Steve an injection of a pain medication that was just strong enough for Tony and Peter to be able to lift him onto the stretcher without hurting him too badly.
"Thank you," Steve whispered as he closed his eyes, hoping against hope that the rest of the night would be uneventful.
"Very well," said T'Challa. He pressed his finger to his ear, contacting his security people. "At my signal, open northwest section seventeen."
asks Natasha.  “You can’t tell me you’d be blushing this much if you were worried Stark was straight or something?”
"JARVIS? How are Tony's vital signs doing?" he asked quietly.
"That's it, gorgeous. Don't hold back, I'm right here."
"Okay. Have a good night!"
"Ha," Thanos scoffed. "And where do you think he brought you?"
"If you need me to repeat my question, Captain, I'll be happy to do so," O'Brien snapped. "Otherwise, I would greatly appreciate it if you would grant me an answer."
Tony frowned. It was a bit weird that Agent Bartlett hadn't yet returned Tony's call, he'd never had any reason to ignore him before.
“Thanks, J.  I owe you one.”  Pocketing his phone, Tony pushed open the door and raced inside, heading straight for the back.  Finding the doorway labelled Restroom, Tony paused, softly knocking three times before sliding it open, his eyes going wide at what he saw.
Uncle Bucky's lower jaw dropped, snapping closed a second later as his eyes narrowed and he squirmed uncomfortably on his chair. "Um… well… that's just… that sounds absolutely
But it was only about three seconds later when Peter felt the ice bolt race down his back again, just before an ear-splitting noise caused him to whip around. Peter stumbled as what could only be described as some kind of huge, flying metal demon swooped down from the sky and latched onto him with its claws, carrying him off in the direction of the frozen lake.
Especially if it helped to ease his husband's mind a bit. After Steve's month-long sejour in the almost-invisible HYDRA prison five months ago, Tony was still hyper-aware of anything he and the rest of the team could do to help shoulder some of Steve's mental burden. Tony—with Peter's help—had made sure that Steve kept his regular weekly therapy sessions with Sam Wilson, but knowing Steve as well as he did, Tony found it unlikely that he was allowing himself to work through the trauma he had endured as well as he should.
"Dad, I'm fine," Peter said, muffled in Tony's chest. "It's the middle of the night, what's going on—?"
Tears had flowed freely down Steve's cheeks as he'd watched his sweet, brave son pick him up off the freezing concrete floor, whispering comforting words as he slung his papa's arm around his shoulders and attempted to carry him out of the bunker, only to fall victim to the same mind-scrambling visions a few steps later.
"It's about time you all showed up!" John said, raising his large mug of beer as Steve pulled out Tony's chair. "Cam and I were already arguing over who was gonna pay for the next round!"
And he wouldn't trade it for anything. Not a single, goddamn thing.
"Mmm, fine," muttered Tony. "I guess we'll just have to agree to disagree on that one."
Gwen shot him a grin, reaching over to squeeze him on the knee. "Then I guess it's a good thing my dad's not here then, hmm?"
"Ah. And I'm guessing that one of those perks was someone who you were supposed to marry?" Peter asked. "Someone who your father considered proper?"
"I'm not gonna lose you, sweetheart," he repeated, almost more for himself than for Tony.
"So you don't think there remains an immediate threat?" Steve asked, his fingers twitching in Tony's.
