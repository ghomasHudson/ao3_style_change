It was here, with Peter and the ducks and their digestive systems, that he began to ground himself once more. Talk of Rogers and “Auntie Nat” and “Uncle Clint” seeked to bring Tony back to reality, and he soon found himself being able to enjoy sitting in itchy grass next to a boy he had only known for about a month, feeding fruit to the attention whore of birds.
“It’s nothing, it’s nothing, Mr. Iron Man just likes to be a little silly sometimes,” Tony explained. Peter seemed satisfied enough with this answer, nodding thoughtfully as he watched the bath fill with water.
Now Steve was really stumped, because if it wasn’t the Arc Reactor, and it wasn’t the physical contact, then it had to be something mental. Of course, they all had their fair share of mental scars and inhibitors, but being afraid of a small child? Steve couldn’t wrap his head around what the problem was. Because as far as he knew, Tony had never had a traumatic experience of a kid attacking him, and it sounded really unlikely that would have happened. There was a reason, but Steve didn’t even know where to begin.
It had been so sudden. One second Tony had been fuming, screaming about all things wrong with his childhood, and the next Captain Rogers was enveloping him in one of the warmest hugs he had ever had. Not like Pepper’s hugs, which were subtly warm, soft limbs lightly resting against his body and small hands splaying against his shoulder blades. No, Ste-
Tony opened his mouth as if to retort, and Steve could almost heard the inevitable ‘no I haven’t’, but then the man closed his mouth, realizing it was no use arguing with Captain Rogers.
Peter looked like he was thinking very hard on this one, staring straight into Tony’s gaze. And then the kid must have reached a conclusion, because he looked very self-assured with himself as he said, “No. No, I don’t want to call you Dad.”
“We. Uh,” was all he could stutter out in his flustered state, in an attempt to inform Gladus that he was neither a Dad nor a human in a happy relationship. But before Tony could stumble through saying anything more, Peter gave her an enthusiastic nod, looking to Tony as if the mechanic made the world spin on its axis.
“I am aware I am not Howard! I am Tony, and Tony is deathly afraid of taking care of a five year old by himself!” Tony spat back, arms folding aggressively across his chest, nails digging painfully into his arms in attempt to ground himself against the rising panic.
Tony gaped at her, mouth opening and closing, trying to find the words to tell her she had everything all wrong. That really, she was making everything worse, and that she should really stop pushing the idea of Steve and him together deeper and deeper into the recesses of his mind. But she looked so convinced in her statement, and Peter was looking at him with big brown eyes, and Tony literally didn’t know what else to do but nod and stare at the both of them as if they had a third eye. His shock (and slightly dissociative state) left him with the ability to do only that.
He swore it had been the Arc Reactor. But it was obvious now that he had been wrong, and maybe Peter’s lips on Tony’s chest may have not been the best thing to help whatever was going on.
“Mr. Steve always wakes me up now,” Peter informed him, confusion written on his face as if he didn’t know normal people did not wake up at the ass crack of dawn. Tony had to get this kid away from Steve Rogers; the Captain was restricting the boy from getting a good sleep-in, teaching him horrible Captain America morals. A sudden nightmare-causing image flitted through Tony’s mind: a future Peter, getting up early every morning to go on a morning run like his dear old pop, not knowing any better. An oblivious Peter, who had been raised on healthy eating habits and daily exercising. Tony shivered at such a horrifying image, knowing the idea would haunt him for many nightmares to come.
Steve shifted uncomfortably on the plush couch he was sharing with Bruce, thinking of the media’s grabby hands. How they twisted up stories and made up love affairs between them all like it was some fun game. What stories would they craft about Peter? One night stand gone wrong? Pete
The familiar click of Pepper hanging up was the response he got, and once again, he was alone with the five year-old child. Those big brown eyes blinked owlishly at Tony from his seat at the table, Poptart devoured without a crumb on his plate. A living human vacuum. Pete’s mouth, when it came into contact with any sugar or pizza, could have been classified as the world’s eighth wonder.
After his hair was sufficiently wet, Tony grabbed hold of the “no-tears” shampoo, ready to sue the shampoo company if he saw any sign of salty water in the boy’s eyes. Peter eyed the bottle in Tony’s grasp skeptically, uncertain eyes drifting up to look at the man.
She let go of his hand and gave him the once-over. Tony looked down in momentary panic to see if the black tape had somehow peeled off the arc and revealed his telling feature, but there was no hint of light peeking through.
“Mister Steve and I always go see the berry lady. She’s nice and old,” Peter informed the mechanic with an air of certainty that Captain Rogers possessed most of the time. It brought a quick smile to Tony’s face.
“I don’t know, maybe because I ruined the memory of your good friend? You always seemed to enjoy telling stories about him. I thought maybe you wouldn’t want to hear it,” Tony explained, looking up into Cap’s blues. The super soldier raised an eyebrow at the mechanic, “Okay, don’t give me that look, I guess it was a little stupid.”
The air was suddenly knocked out of him as Peter got more enthusiastic with using Tony as a bouncy cushion, and large calloused hands shot up to grasp small arms, “Please stop Pete, just woke up. I have a,” he yawned before continuing, “heart condition…”
I hope you guys liked this chapter! Don't forget to leave a comment and/or a kudo! I've been loving all of the feedback I have been getting thus far, it makes me happy to know that you all are enjoying the story! Have a lovely day <3
But somehow dragons were real, and they could be defeated, because the desert and the cave began to recede from the peripheral of Tony’s vision until all that was left was the grinning child. And this was really something else, because only moments before, Tony had been so scared. But now, he felt a ball of happiness settle in his chest at the sight of Peter; a sort of happiness he had always associated with Pepper, Rhodey, and more recently, Steve.
“Sorry little dude,” Tony mumbled to the hot-rod red appliance. He then turned to the coffee maker, which had been patiently waiting for him to collect his coffee. He thanked the machine, pouring himself a mug full and sighing when the caffeine burned a hot trail over his tongue and down his throat.
For those of you who know me as the author of Recalibrate, don't worry, I am not abandoning that fic. This is actually the fic I work on when I can't get a chapter of Recalibrate down on the page, so have no fear!
Steve would have thought the billionaire would have been invested in the discussion at hand. They were talking about everything. Budgets, safety, adoption process, furniture; all things Tony Stark normally took control of, insisting he be the one to oversee the “behind the hero” work. Usually Steve didn’t approve of his need to take over everything, overworking himself to the point of exhaustion. But this time, he needed Tony to be the enthusiastic planner he always was. He needed help on this, because he was honestly at a loss.
?” Pepper’s voice shrieked, and he had totally planned on not telling her about Peter. He had known she was going to react like this, had known she would immediately dive into all the reasons why this ‘wasn’t a good idea.’ Although he agreed with her, Tony did not want to hear about all the ways she thought he was incapable; he didn’t need to hear all of the things he kept telling himself.
Steve’s mouth wasn’t working, but even if it was he didn’t know what he would have said. Tony continued on, now looking at the torn hem of his shirt. His voice was much quieter now, as if he had scared himself with his outburst.
They’d never hugged before. There was some handshakes passed between them throughout the years, yes. And there had been a side hug once; although that one hadn’t really counted, because carrying a bleeding Tony off the battlefield, supporting him as he limped, wasn’t actually a hug. So why Steve felt the need to hug the shorter man was beyond him. It probably had something to do with how broken the man looked, as if he had been keeping the weight of the world in his heart. And now, Steve was simply seeing what Tony felt every single time parents or kids or families were mentioned. It made sense, the need to be as far away from Peter as the genius could get. He now understood the clench in Tony’s jaw that came with every story Steve told of the late Howard Stark.
The man in question had gone pale, lips a thin line of obvious discomfort. It was the same expression Tony had in the library when Peter had kissed the Arc Reactor. He had thought it had been because of the mental scars the the device in his chest carried. But it was now obvious to Cap that this expression had nothing to do with the reactor, and everything to do with Peter.
Tony gently began to help Peter undress, rolling his socks off with the utmost care. His ankles were so small, so thin, and Tony could cover the child’s foot with one hand. If he wasn’t careful, he could accidentally snap any bone in the small boy’s body; that scared the shit out of him more than anything ever had. And the “things that scared the shit out of him” list was incredibly long, so he was respectively freaked.
Tony helped pat the five year old dry as the now-dirty bath water got sucked down the drain. Peter yawned sleepily as the older man toweled the brown locks dry, and thank Odin’s hairy ball sack that the child was feeling sleepy, because Tony had no idea how the hell he was supposed to get Peter to bed if he was wide awake.
Peter reluctantly let go of Tony, pouting while looking at Steve as if the good Captain had done the child wrong.
Steve Rogers? As in Captain America? He thought it would be a good idea to leave you alone with a child?”
“Thanks Pete,” he croaked, pulling his hands out of Peter’s hair and reaching for the water cup, which had been left to lazily float along in the water. He was carefully washing out the suds, holding his hand to Peter’s hairline as instructed, when the boy asked yet another question.
Steve notices something's up with Tony, and tries to get it out of him. He may get more than he bargained for.
Peter was excited to see just where Iron Man worked, almost vibrating next to Steve. He gently held the young boy’s hand, hoping to keep the kid by his side, because although Tony had been proofing the tower, he assumed the man had not thought to proof his own workshop.
“Let it go? Look, if we’re adopting Peter, I need to make sure everyone is on the same page. And right now, we are not on the same page. Pardon my french, but ‘not good with kids’ is bullcrap, Stark,” Steve immediately cursed himself, he was already getting angry. And when he got angry, then Tony would, and they would soon ping off each other until it became a screaming match.
“Well that just doesn't make sense. We meet kids all the time out in the field, you love signing their drawings with red crayons. Why is Peter any different?” Steve questioned, taking a step forward and trying to keep his voice calm. The last thing they needed right now was for him to get angry at Tony for keeping his walls up. He took a step backward in response to the Captain’s advances, not needing comfort nor closeness in this conversation. Steve made a note not to move forward again, not wanting to do anything to cause Tony to bolt.
Holding his hand was Peter, decked out from head to toe in Avengers merchandise. Something that Clint Barton had everything to do with.
Tony cursed himself once more, the name “Steve” rolling by too easily, too slippery to grasp and stop before completing its thought. He had been trying, really trying, because he did not need his crush on the good Captain. He had never needed to be crushing on the man to begin with, but now he really needed it to stop because if Steve started hugging Tony on the regular, he would be doomed. Might as well take himself out of the Avengers, because he was now a puddle of warmth, and Stark men did not become puddles of warmth.
Tony sighed, running a hand through his sleep-mussed hair. He was tired, and he hadn’t gotten his coffee yet. Arguing with a five year old was the last thing he wanted to do at the moment.
“You put paper towel on it! Now it’s going to taste like paper towel!” Peter argued, squinting at Tony as if this was obvious physics; as if transferring taste between objects by touch was as real as gravity or Newton’s Laws.
It had been one of Tony’s first hugs since breaking up with Pepper; definitely his first hug after the Civil War, and he immediately knew all future hugging experiences were now ruined. Nothing would ever come close to the hugs Steve Rogers delivered. It was like a huge band-aid, binding his many wounds and promising healing with time. Tony didn’t believe in magic, avoided it at all costs; scoffed at the concept as if it were stale gum stuck to his shoe. But in that moment, with drying tears on his cheeks and throat raw from screaming, Steve’s arms felt like magic.
It was at this point that Peter let go of Tony’s hand, rushing towards Berry Lady as fast as his little legs would let him. She crouched down to meet him as he approached, giving him a kind hug that was well received. Tony watched on skeptically, measuring the interaction between the two and preparing to rip the child out of her hands at any sign of creepiness. But nothing bad occurred, and once the hug was shared, the two began to hold an animated conversation.
Everything was okay though. They could deal with one less adult; some people with kids only had themselves to babysit. So the remaining Avengers could deal with one less person in their parental unit of four, right?
“Tony? Tony, what was that?” Pepper interrogated, something akin to anxiety in her tone. Tony could almost see her leaning forward on her desk by her elbows, ankles crossing and ungodly high heels clicking together. Her perfect eyebrows were probably raised in the particular way that she reserved for Tony’s many questionable decisions. The same expression had become known worldwide, when some photographer had been able to capture the moment Pepper realized Tony Stark was getting in a race car to ‘recklessly drive fast’ in the streets of Milan.
“JARVIS?” Tony addressed to the camera he knew was hidden in the corner above his head. If he squinted hard enough, he could make out the swivel of the device, turning to focus on him.
Knowing what she was probably thinking, knowing what conclusions she was coming to, Tony told Pepper all about how Captain Rogers had stumbled upon a newly orphaned child and had somehow thought it a great idea to take him home. He left out the details about the panic attacks and the general difficulty he had with being around Peter. But Pepper knew him well enough; she probably knew what Tony was going through without him saying.
Thank you all for reading and sticking by this process. Again, I'm super sorry it was such a long wait. Hopefully this chapter will make up for it!
“You’re a strong, brave monster,” Tony said with more emotion than he had intended. But Peter grinned happily at that, kicking the air with his now shoe-covered feet with a delighted shout. All emotion the man had let through in those few couple of words was more than worth the little monster’s joy.
“Tony! Why haven’t you answered any of my emails? I’ve been trying to contact you-” Pepper Potts began, and wow, it suddenly felt like he could breathe easier, despite the frantic tone. Pepper had always been able to calm him down, to ease him with her familiar worry-filled words. And after such a long time without talking, having been too preoccupied with Peter and the team, her voice was like crawling back into a warm bed after weeks of business travels. Tony hadn’t noticed how much he had missed Pepper Potts. Sometimes, he conveniently forgot how much he loved having her in his life. The therapist thought this had something to do with not wanting to give himself good things. Tony just called it ‘being busy’.
“Monster, monster!” Peter screamed, sending his sock flying with a particularly strong kick to where the bearded man’s face had been before he ducked. And damn it if Tony wasn’t losing his cool, because machines never acted this way and it had taken seven fucking minutes to get that one sock on his tiny elusive feet and now he was getting aimed kicks to the face and of course Howard’s wonderful parenting would automatically take over before Tony could think.
“Tony, I’m sorry, there’s nothing I can do,” Rogers addressed quickly, sprinting down the hall towards the stairs, and there was no fucking way he was going to let the good Captain go so easily.
Rogers looked up from the overflowing duffel bag. Sky blues met chocolate browns, and “Steve” settled on Tony’s tongue once more. He wanted to bite the word, kill it with a gnash of his teeth, but it felt too sweet on his taste buds; like a candy he just couldn’t bare to resist.
“Hey Pete? What do you and Mr. Steve do on Tuesdays?” Tony asked, checking the goat themed calendar magnetized to the fridge to ensure that it was, indeed, Tuesday. The toaster beeped happily, the toast springing up from the slot Tony had placed it in. He pulled the food out of the toaster and set it on a plastic plate, thanking the appliance as he did so.
“Uncle Thor’s Poptarts!” Peter exclaimed, and Tony had a suspicion that Peter would have refused the toast no matter how much butter was on it, because the boy hadn’t had an ounce of hesitation before answering. And Tony knew that if Cap had been there, Rogers would have said no and then proceeded to suggest an apple instead. But Tony didn’t feel like forcing healthy things onto the small boy; he felt like giving Peter an actual happy, maybe-not-incredibly-healthy-because-of-it, life. And if he got into Pete’s good graces by allowing him to have some sugar in the morning, it was no skin off of Tony’s back. He was willing to allow such a sugar-filled breakfast as long as the boy would forget the butter soaked toast.
Tony looked over to Peter at that moment, wondering if their loud conversation was possibly bothering the boy. However, he simply looked content. This could easily have been because there were Poptarts waiting in the toaster for him.
And holy shit she totally looked like a Gladus. Tony would have guessed Margret on the fly, but ‘Gladus’ fit this woman like cookies and milk. Which he was almost certain this woman fed to her grandchildren when the parents weren’t watching.
“Pep, honey, you’re killing me here. I already told you, this is why I’m calling you in the first place. There
“I’ll call you Mr. Tony then,” Peter declared. Tony’s hands paused in the boy’s hair as a spike of pure joy rocketed through his heart. For something such as a name, something that really shouldn’t matter, he was over the moon. Being Peter’s favorite hero no longer included just the suit, but now also included the man who wore the suit. And he was sure it didn’t mean anything, being called Mr. Tony, but it felt like everything to him.
And fuck him, because if this wasn’t one of the most wild emotional roller coasters he’d ever been on.
“Listen, I’m just- I’m not good with kids, okay? They cry and scream, they always want food. They’re different than machines, and I just prefer machines,” Tony said, waving his arms about in a desperate attempt to make Steve believe him. But no matter how hard Stark tried, he would always avoid eye contact with the person he was lying to. Tony’s eyes flickering from one object to another was a dead give away.
bothering Iron Man. Because no matter how thin the ice was, he missed seeing the sleep-deprived genius. It reminded him slightly of Wakanda, when Steve would sit around and jump at small noises, turning and expecting- no,
So, consequently, that night found the small group around the unusually empty dining table, eating pizza and conversing about their days. It was almost enough to help Tony ignore the doom lump in his airway, pretending that the metaphorical meteor that was undoubtedly on a coarse straight to their living room was, in fact, not coming. This fake ignorance only lasted for a few moments, however, until Natasha’s phone rang, vibrating in her pocket.
Tony sputtered for breath, lungs shrinking tight in an automatic reaction, left over from his days spent in Afghanistan. He gasped, airway deciding to cease all function as his heart rate spiked. He could feel Peter and the bathroom starting to disappear; the white tiles threatening to become dark and desert hot, the bathtub flickering between reality and a large washbucket. The alien towel gripped in Tony’s hands felt subtly similar to the cloth restraints the Ten Rings had used on his hands. He swore he could feel the familiar sandy grit under his dirty fingernails.
hugs were a damning warmth, burying him in such a comforting heat that it was hard to believe the man had lived in ice for seventy years.
When Pete opened his mouth, Tony expected him to say something along the lines of ‘are you sure you know what to do with that’ or just plainly ‘I don’t trust you’. Instead, Peter asked, “Why does Mr. Steve call you Tony?”
“Does Dad number two here like berries, too?” Gladus asked sweetly, and Tony was about to confirm that he thought berries were pretty alright, when his brain finally caught itself up to speed and realized what Gladus had really just said.
Tony called back, voice thick with sleep. Tripping over pants he had left to rest on the floor, he ran out of the guest room in a quick sprint to the room a couple doors down. But Peter wasn’t laying in his bed, and the flying Iron Man was nowhere to be seen, “
“Too hot! Too hot!” Peter insisted, stomping his feet on the mat as if trying to set out a fire. Tony groaned. The water had been fine, he swore. But apparently it hadn’t been cold enough, because Peter was now glaring at Tony as if every wrong thing with the world was because of him. He took a deep breath, settling the slight frustration that quietly lay deep in his stomach. It was so subtle, it almost felt like a leftover genetic reaction from Howard Stark. Lovely.
“Steve, you should talk to Tony about this. I tried to convince him to talk to you before you started to hunt him down. But he didn’t take my advice, I guess.” Bruce explained, his shrug heavy and defeated.  The super soldier nodded in silent understanding, patting the scientist on the shoulder softly before standing up, adjourning the discussion for the moment.
And he really didn’t have much of an issue with this new rule. Having clothes to walk out with meant he wouldn't have to walk bare into the chilly, colder-than-Peter’s-boner-water air. And if it meant Tony could snatch up a white SSR shirt that was much too large on him and not get an odd look, well. That was just a small bonus.
By the time they reached the tower once more (taking a little longer than expected, due to the fact that Peter decide it necessary to take a twenty minute stop at the park of screaming children, seemingly forgetting he was ever hungry in the first place), it was past lunch, and grumpy Peter made it clear that he would not be eating the mediocre peanut butter and jelly sandwich Tony had prepared unless they both ate lunch on the living room floor. And of course Cap would have never allowed such a rebellious act, but Tony wasn’t up for forcing the kid to sit at the dining table, and therefore allowed the command with little hesitation.Tony, more than happy to procrastinate work and bring Peter out of his foul mood, decided to join the boy for lunch on the ground with his Godzilla, Scooby-Doo, and out-of-place Obama figurine. Tony could only assume this was somehow Clint’s doing.
But the man was still reeling from the dread of possibly blinding Peter, so nothing could have prepared him for the cup full of water that was thrown right in his face.
It took a few seconds to recover from being caught off guard before Tony could process the question. As he thought on how to answer that, he squirted a bit of the shampoo into his hands, rubbing it together in his hands. Reaching for Peter’s head once more, and ever so gently scrubbing it in the brown locks, he answered, “I guess because it’s my name.”
Those sky blues looked so raw in that moment, the honesty that they conveyed almost blinding to Tony. Cap believed every single word he was saying. He trusted Tony every bit as he did the rest of the team, and there was no doubt in the man’s mind that Tony would fail.
Rogers stomped off after the call ended, grumbling about “gym” and “could you take care of Peter for a while”, so that’s how Tony Stark ended up spending a good chunk of his time putting puzzles together with Peter Parker, praying to a god he still didn’t believe in that the child would stay entertained. Once Cap had come back from his workout, less tense and slightly more relaxed, Tony had all but shoved Peter back into the Captain’s care. That was the day they realized Tony had a limited amount of time he could take care of the child before anxiety and panic settled deep in his bones once more. Luckily, Tony had been able to keep it together until he reached his workshop, but the team made sure to keep his “Peter exposure” at a comfortable level from there, on.
“Shit! Shit!” he chanted, hands flailing for the boy’s alien themed towel. As soon as he got his hands on it, he quickly brought it to Peter’s face, rubbing at his eyes with a frenzied concern. Of course, leave it up to him to fucking
And anyway, he was highly suspicious that Bruce was getting laid by whoever had summoned him. Tony was not about to cockblock the doctor from some well-deserved stress relief with his inability to take care of small children.
Tony attempted to reign in his frown at these words, following briskly behind Cap as they walked down the stairs to the communal floor, where Natasha would most likely be waiting. He did not want to call Bruce. He shouldn’t have to, because ‘Stark men are made of iron’ and surely Tony was stronger than to be bested by a five year old.
Peter’s eyelashes fluttered against his small cheeks as he hesitantly opened his eyes. Big brown eyes locked onto worry-filled ones, and Tony had never felt so relieved in his life, “I’m so sorry buddy, I’m the worst bath giver. Like, the worst of the worst. I should be fired.”
He took three, cautious steps to the genius, arms hesitantly outstretched in an invitation; asking permission. Steve expected Tony to shy away, to turn around and ask him to leave. Which Steve would have done, because looking back on what he had said, he felt mortified. He felt like he had broken the world in two, and this hurt so much worse than it had when he had been alone in Wakanda.
Tony Stark attempts to avoid confrontation from Captain America and a 5 year old boy. It does not go as planned.
Barton had slightly dragged his feet on the way out, not used to the team exuberantly reassuring him that he was not needed. He voiced his suspicions that the team didn’t want him  with the way they were almost asking him to leave. But he was soon out of the tower, and their human count was down to five.
They hand-held their way back to the guest room, where the mini Iron Man began to fly around, tracing the perimeter over and over again. Peter curled up against Tony’s chest, hand lightly resting against the Arc Reactor’s blue light. He had stiffened when the warm skin made contact with the shirt covering the device, but talked himself into relaxing as best he could. This wasn’t Obie or a vibranium shield. This was Peter Parker.
“I dunno, how’d your first date with my head of security go?” Tony shot back, teasing without an intent to hurt. But suddenly, the mood shifted over the phone. And wasn’t he just great at shifting the mood? Going too far was something he was an expert at; one of the very many things that eventually pushed Pepper away. And sure, maybe that had been a bit too harsh to say. Meeting in the middle had been a sore subject when it came to their relationship. It had been a major reason why Pepper slept on the couch most nights towards the end of their relationship; why they had such loud arguments when Tony came home late in an Iron Man suit with scorch marks.
And damn it, Tony’s weak heart was pumping against the arc reactor like it was trying to get out. He honestly didn’t know what would happen if Peter said yes in that moment. Would he accept his fate of being Dad? Would he spiral into panic? Would he scold Pete with the whole of Central Park watching? Would he dive headfirst into the lake in hopes responsibilities stayed on land? Anything was fair game in that moment.
Tony was at a loss for words. An unusual phenomenon, something Pepper had always vehemently insisted did not exist. A speechless Tony Stark? Impossible. Yet there he sat, staring at the holographic screens, his tongue light and lying awkwardly in his mouth without the weight of words sitting on it.
“Of course, Sir,” the AI responded, the coffee maker chirping and whirring in what was probably a ‘good morning’ of sorts. It was one of Tony’s latest creations, adding an AI to the coffee machine. So far, things had gone well. This was, of course, not counting the one time the poor machine had started stress-making cold coffee, traumatized by a loud argument between Clint and Tony a few feet away.
the kid didn’t know what he was talking about. The title of dad was heavy and strong, and Pete was probably throwing the word around for every Avenger that took care of him. Surely, Peter Parker did not see Tony Stark, a piping hot mess, to be his certified caretaker. Hell no. Absolutely not.
They were having an Avengers meeting, everyone sitting on couches and chairs as they discussed the newest pressing issue: Peter Parker. It was Monday, and they had all agreed to eat lunch over the topic in the communal living room. Which had been the first sign something was off, because Tony had come out of his workshop without even a grumble of frustration, eyes glued to the Stark Pad held tightly in his grip. Not a single word was uttered from Tony’s direction, not even a chuckle.
For a brief second, he considered calling Bruce. Tony didn’t know a quarter of what Bruce knew on how to take care of a child; Peter’s chance of injury would marginally decrease if Dr. Banner was there instead. But Tony was a Stark man, and Stark men were made of iron, and if a five year old could best the man behind the Iron Man suit, it would be high time to retire. He would be left alone to tinker with old cars, ridicule DUM-E, and mourn the good ol’ days. And although there were worse things than a lonely retirement, Tony wasn’t quite ready to accept this fate. He could not call Bruce Banner.
“Well, alright. I’ll make it just shy of boner killer and not too close to lava, yeah?” Tony chuckled, speaking to himself again, and for some reason he was surprised when Peter answered. He had not meant for Pete to hear him, his mind for some reason assuming the boy could only hear him when he wanted to be heard. It was safe to say Tony had been hanging around robots for too long.
Tony grabbed a Poptart pack out of the brown sugar box, which was Thor’s favorite flavor based on all the raving the Asgardian did about it. Sometimes, the mechanic suspected Thor only came back to Earth for the Poptarts, and not for his friends who lived on it.
“Calling Ms. Potts,” JARVIS announced from somewhere above Tony’s messy brown head. The sounds of plastic toys smashing into each other acted as an on-hold telephone music of sorts, filling the communal floor with silence before the CEO of Stark industries graced the room with the all too familiar tone of frustration.
“No, no, trust me, Captain America is still very much a blushing virgin,” Tony chuckled, restraining himself from adding that he would be happy to change this fact.
But unlike the other Avengers that had been spotted, Rogers did not stop his daily runs in Central Park. The man had an ability to pretend something wasn’t happening, and if the World War II vet ever felt too watched, he would simply take a run through the park’s woods and leave the cameras behind him in a trail of his own dust.
“Cap, please,” Tony tried, but the blood pulsing in Steve’s ears was too loud, too deafening to focus on the shorter man a few long steps away.
Peter settled into the bath with a satisfied smile on his face, and Tony let out a breath without even realizing he had been holding it. He had passed the first step,
this has been a good talk. I’ve gotta go work on some… stuff, Pepper will kill me if I don’t. Ciao. It’s been real.”
It would have been so easy to follow these images, to get sucked into them, suffocating in the memories. He almost felt the start of losing himself, body beginning to curl inwards subconsciously, when his gaze fell to the boy in the bathtub.
“Is it a problem with being responsible for kids? Because Peter is responsibility and all the kids you gave autographs to weren’t. That’s a mighty fine difference.”
Grabbing the butter out of the fridge and a knife from one of the kitchen drawers, he prepared Peter’s toast with an inexperienced hand. It was toasty enough to be crunchy, which was a good sign. But the butter was melting in pools, and maybe butter pools was what Peter liked?
It was a jerky conversation, full of stops and fast-spoken words, and before Tony knew it, Nat was already hanging up.
, because his friend had abandoned his own son to look for Steve, “You deserved so much better than that. You know that, right? And,” Steve swallowed around the word, feeling sick for even having to say it, “a-abuse is not something to mess around with. I’m saying this all wrong of course. I guess I just want you to know that I care. And if you want to, I can help teach you how to take care of Peter. Or anything else. I just want to help.”
It was obvious that, in that moment, a line was crossed. Because Tony’s angry red turned to a sickly pale green, eyes widening at the mention of Stark Senior.
“Did he teach you to be angry?” and fuck, this kid was getting to the bottom of this faster than Rogers or Bruce or any therapist ever had. Peter blinked up at the older man, whose face had gone cold and guarded, staring back at the child as if he had been asked something as simple as ‘do you like apples?’ Peter must have sensed he had done something wrong, because next thing Tony knew, the tiny body wriggled into his lap, the back of his head resting up against the arc reactor. The movement shocked Tony out of his dark thoughts, and the man looked down to see Peter looking right back up at him, an awed look on his face as if he hadn’t known the bearded man would look upside down at this angle. His tiny hand was holding the sock he had flung almost minutes before, offering it to Tony.
It was obvious that the man had not been alerted by his AI that the two were at the door. His head bobbing continued, mouthing the words along to the song that Steve only vaguely recognized. And for a second, Steve didn’t want to enter the workshop. He wanted to keep watching, Tony singing along to songs and surrounded in Arc Reactor blue. He loved seeing the man in his element. It was some of the only times that the man looked unburdened by the world, finding freedom in guitar riffs and drum solos.
Peter responded with a quick and precise nod, large brown eyes still locked onto Tony as if in defense mode, watching the man’s every move and assessing whether he was in danger. The older man’s heart sank to the floor.
Clint nodded in agreement, “The media will pounce on this once it gets out. And they will find out, we can’t keep the kid locked in the tower his whole life.”
Cap tried again, “There’s something off. And I don’t know why you’re being silent about it. You obviously aren’t okay with Pete, and-”
The man smiled wearily at the assassin for a moment, before looking down at his hands yet again, “We all have our things. Some things we don’t want to deal with. There are somethings that don’t belong in SHIELD files. Sometimes, there are things we don’t want other people to know about. Tony might not always take himself seriously. He sometimes plays the ‘playboy’ card in hopes of making himself seem like an open book. But Tony hides things too.”
“It’s okay young man,” Gladus said, comforting the pale adult that was clearly shaken, “I’m not an intolerant buffoon like some people these days. Two men are just as capable as a straight pair.”
As for future updates, I can't give you guys a set schedule. I'm starting a new job this summer, as well as moving in with my partner (it almost sounds like I'm a real adult?), so there's a bunch of unknowns this summer and therefore I won't be able to promise anything. However, I have not given up on this fic, and seek to finish it (hopefully in the next five years XD).
He knew he had to call Pepper. But he had been avoiding doing such for as long as he possibly could. Because, well. She hadn’t a clue of the reason he had been so radio silent. And he had a suspicion Pepper wouldn’t react too casually to the idea of Tony Stark taking care of a small human. But not telling her that he was basically 3 days behind on his work would throw her off her schedule, and she would be consequently livid. Tony did not need a livid Pepper when he had a five year old to take care of.
He watched as the man chewed at his bottom lip, before fingers began tapping yet again and eyebrows relaxing from their furrowed expression. The mask was on, and Steve resisted the urge to sigh.
The genius was taken aback for a second at the blatant display of care, and he would have stayed shocked for a longer period of time if he wasn’t in the position he was in now.
They went to sleep that night, Tony staring straight up at the ceiling as Peter slept on his chest, breathing deeply and twitching with a dream. The word “Dad” rang through his head, bouncing around as if a happy, yet anxious animal. He falls asleep to Peter’s breathing, a smile lightly on his face.
Despite the haze of quasi-panic, Tony was still able to hear Peter talking. And the boy was quickly, and concerningly, becoming a mini-Rogers. The little monster was lecturing him about why they had to feed the ducks berries instead of hot dog buns, because Mr. Steve said that ducks couldn’t handle digesting bread, and of course Steve (damn it, Tony’s fucking brain used that word so endearingly) was worried about the digestive systems of ducks.
“Right. Okay. We can do this, right?” Tony assured himself, sighing deeply as he crouched down to where Pete sat. The boy nodded and wiggled a sock-covered foot at him, gesturing for him to take it off.
“Do you… miss your dad, Pete?” and he really had to tread lightly here, because he wasn’t sure how aware children Peter’s age were understanding of death and the permanence of it all. Tony had had the misfortune of being completely aware of what death meant, when his parents had bit the dust. More aware than he would have liked to have been, seeing as how his habit of excessive drinking had started then. A habit he was still trying to kick to the curb.
“Oh god Pete, Mr. Steve is gonna kill us,” Tony muttered as he observed the mess they had created. The bathroom was wetter than it had ever been or needed to be, and it was going to be a bitch sopping up with towels.
Peter squealed in delight as he was tickled, limbs flailing, sending large waves of water over the bathtub edge. Tony’s jeans were absolutely soaked, but he really couldn’t give a shit, and only realized the damage after the tickling ceased, as per Peter’s strained “No, Mr. Tony, no, stop!”
It's the first morning of taking care of Peter since Cap left, and Tony feels like he's up the river without a paddle.
If someone had told him that finding Peter had been some part of God’s plan, he would have believed them in a heartbeat. There had been such raw vulnerability in those brown eyes; it had broken Steve’s heart in two and immediately stitched it back together with vibranium sutures. He had always thought the concept of “love at first sight” had been so naive when he saw it in the films. Now, he wasn’t so sure they had been far off the mark.
Tony had almost forgotten he and the boy were part of the very exclusive ‘my parents died to mysterious accidents’ club. His heart sunk at the fact that maybe the boy was still waiting for his dad to come home, waiting for that plane that would never come back to land.
“I’m on board with it,” Natasha announced, pulling Steve away from the long stare he was giving the unaware mechanic, “It’ll be difficult, of course. Peter’s not going to have a normal life.”
Lunch on the floor lead to Peter feeling cautiously chaotic with the rule-breaking high, because by the time lunch ended, jelly and peanut butter had somehow gotten itself all over the boys face and in his hair.
She winked at him as if they had just shared a secret, a knowing look in her eyes as if he had told her everything without uttering a single word.
Now left alone to talk, the two men looked at each other, the silence settling heavy between the two of them.
“I want toast!” Peter protested, and evidently the child didn’t give two shits about the man’s weak heart if it meant he wasn’t going to be getting toast. His grip on Peter stopped the boy from bouncing however, so at least that was a plus.
Tony’s face was beginning to get red as the anger rose within him, and somewhere deep in his mind, Steve tried to remind himself that getting frustrated was not helping anyone. But he was too far gone to care.
Happy 100th to Steve Rogers! I don't celebrate the Fourth of July because I don't really feel patriotic for the USA as of late. However, I'll celebrate Steven Grant Rogers' birthday any day!
Tears streamed down Tony’s face as the man finally broke, screaming as he had never screamed before, “
he wasn’t going to be getting any work done. The R&D department was not going to be happy. Not that Tony had ever been affected by the glares the board gave him, but it always made him uncomfortable when someone expected him to care about something that he didn’t.
*EDIT: for some reason, my editor's computer changed all "Gladus" to "Gladys", so if there's any that I missed, please let me know!*
“Tony. Breathe,” Cap instructed, gripping the shorter man’s shoulder as he did so. An act of grounding, something Rogers had probably learned in some team building YouTube tutorial, but it was working wonders.
They all turned to the billionaire in question, whose gaze briefly flickered up from the Starkpad. Once he realized all the attention was on him, he quickly looked back down at the screen, successfully avoiding everyone’s stares. Something was obviously wrong. Tony didn’t reply to Bruce’s question, even though he would normally jump at the opportunity to talk. He loved to converse like there was no tomorrow, and rarely ever went quiet, especially when the discussion was something important. And in Steve’s book, raising a child was a very important subject.
As Tony made the guest room bed, situating himself only a few doors down from Peter just in case, he contemplated what it would have been like to have a dad willing to give him baths. A dad willing to feed him his favorite foods, or make him flying toys to zoom around his room, making him feel safe. A dad that would play with him while keeping their anger at bay, or teach him how to use bow and arrow. A dad to dress him up in stars, spangles, and stripes, or a mom to teach him how to cook russian cuisine.
Quite truthfully, the confrontation went as well as it could have. Tony had still seemed slightly disoriented when they had left, most likely due to the fact that Peter liked to communicate love with touch and the genius wasn’t on board with this. But Steve left the library feeling refreshed, knowing that everything was resolved and now the team could move forward with raising of Peter. Because they had fixed the issue with Tony. Peter promised not to touch the blue circle, and that’s what had obviously been the problem, so now they were
For a second, Tony had to fight the urge to snap. The sudden need to get angry, to scare the boy off from ever asking about Howard again. It was the automatic response to anyone when they asked about his dad. But then, that’s exactly what his father would have done. What his father had taught Tony to do. And although off-putting, adults knew how to interpret Tony’s harsh words as his defensive nature. But a child knew no difference. There was no way in hell he was about to discourage Peter from asking questions.
“Boner water is good,” Peter agreed, nodding and patting his hands against the surface of the water, watching the ripples with content. Hell, Cap was really going to kill Tony when he got back, but at least it felt so worth it in the moment.
“But your name is Iron Man,” he argued, head following loosely along with Tony’s hands, and the man wished that Pete would hold his head steadier because it looked like it was about to  just roll off his body.
The light was almost serving as a night-light for the child, blue light falling across the now-sleeping Peter’s cheeks and highlighting the small smile on his lips. Somehow, to Tony’s astonishment, the boy was happy in his arms, was happy to rest his little palm on the humming blue circle. And if it was helping Peter feel safe, if it was making him smile, then Tony supposed he could allow the contact just this once.
“Peter isn’t different. Not at all. I’m just not good with kids, Steve, that’s all. Just let it go-”
“Yeah, okay, but Cap has an unusual sleep schedule that most people don’t follow. Because unlike Cap, we’re sane,” Tony grumbled, sitting up in the bed and causing Peter to crawl off of his body. Truthfully, the genius had no right to talk bad about sleeping schedules. Yes, the Captain got up early, but he also went to sleep early as well. Tony didn’t ‘go to sleep’. ‘Passing out’ was a far more accurate phrase.
“Okay!” Pete exclaimed, the widest smile Tony had ever seen forming on the boy’s face, as if this was the most exhilarating thing he could agree to.
It was take-away night, and Peter had chosen pizza, to the surprise of literally nobody. Tony had once said the boy ate pizza like an opioid addict popped pills, an analogy that had Cap sporting a disapproving frown and Clint snorting into his pepperoni pizza. The analogy was painfully accurate however, no matter how much Cap disapproved of it. They ate pizza at least two times a week because Peter insisted. Tony would have stopped it by now if the child didn’t get so damn happy when the pizza man arrived, treating the acne ridden, most likely high-as-a-kite teen as if they were the second coming of Jesus or David Bowie.
Everything was not solved. Something was off with Tony, despite having cleared the air and confronted the issue. Confronting always worked, had always resolved whatever the genius was having a hard time with. Evidently, however, something had gone wrong in the library, because Tony Stark had not spoken a single word.
The boy rocked on his heels for a few seconds, looking from the super soldier to his idol, trying to figure out if he really could hug Tony. Peter must have decided Stark was telling the truth, because in the next moment, the boy was in Tony’s arms, laughing and throwing his little arms around the man’s neck.
“Okay. Okay. I ruined the toast even more. Fine. What do you want instead?” Tony asked, taking the paper plate from Peter and setting it on the counter next to the coffee machine. He tried not to let the annoyance seep into his tone, because being a picky eater was nothing to be ashamed of, and getting angry at the kid because he didn’t want ‘paper towel toast’ sounded like a waste of time.
There was a deep rumble on the other side of the line, and Tony immediately knew that a Fury-sized meteor had just interrupted their dinner. And honestly, Tony should have guessed the goddamn meteor was Nick Fury, of course it was that man’s fault.The assassin's face went stony and her lips pressed into a thin line as she got her orders, green eyes turning dark and serious.
“Toast is ready, Pete,” Tony announced to the unseen figure, who popped into view and dashed to the dining table at the mention of breakfast. He set the plate of buttered toast at the boy’s seat. He watched as Peter picked up his toast, nervous that Peter wouldn’t like it. He didn't want to see the look on the boy’s face when he figured out that Tony was a sub-par adult, unfit to give Peter what he needs. Tony hastily turned to the coffee machine, too inexplicably nervous to watch the recognizable look of disappointment settle on Pete’s face. The genius watched the last few drops of brown liquid fall into the pot, trying not to listen for cries of disgust.
“Tony, I really don’t need to hear about this again. What you subscribe to on your off time is not my business-”
Tony had no qualms at first, when they walked by the Heckscher playground. He had already resigned himself to the idea that this was not the place they were supposed to be. But when they passed the baseball fields and then crossed the first street that ran through the park, Tony began to worry. Because this was taking much longer than he expected and he could almost feel the groan of his joints at the unexpected amount of walking. He was fit, sure, there was no doubt about it. It took a certain amount of muscles to do the superhero stuff that Tony did. But long walks when the stress was piled high did nothing good for his body.
Cap hadn’t mentioned nightmares, but Peter was paler than the super soldier's fair Irish skin, and the poor boy looked like he had seen a ghost.
Despite these few mishaps, life in the tower was happy. Tony was oblivious to the warning signs as he always was, and he was hitting an all time high with his personal inventing and production rates in the workshop.
Peter’s legs immediately went still, but the fear in his wide eyes was nowhere near worth the abrupt cooperation. Tony could see every moment of his childhood, such as a duck from a drunken fist, reflected in Peter’s eyes; could see the pain Tony had felt when he would receive double the force of the second swing for ducking from the first.
Doctor Banner gave quick goodbyes to them each, asked Tony to look after a colony of bacteria he was cultivating in his lab, and then Bruce was gone.
He stifled a yawn as he walked out into the hallway, telling stories of Bucky having made him exhausted as well. A glance at the clock and oh boy, it was way too early for Tony Stark to go to bed. But taking care of a five year old was draining; they had so much energy. And nobody was there to point out that Tony was making a healthy decision, so there was really no reason
“What? What’d I do?” Tony questioned, hastily pulling Pete out of the bath water and setting him back on the fuzzy bath mat.
That being said, he wouldn’t trust himself with a kid either. In fact, he was sure he was having an aneurysm right alongside the social workers, because taking care of a child was too much for his weak heart to handle. He would have gladly passed the torch to literally anyone. He trusted the homeless hippy that lived in the alleyway a few blocks down and only ate prunes more than himself when it came to child care.
” and dear Lord Tony was starting to get loud, but Steve didn’t honestly care anymore. He had forgotten that Peter was in the room, Tony’s screams zeroing the whole universe in on him as they always did.
He wasn’t ready to have any claim over any child, no matter if they were Peter or not. All his mind could play back to him in that moment was the constant mantra of “Howard,” over and over again, like his brain was desperately trying to remind Tony just exactly why he had such an aversion to the title. As if he could forget.
He sucked in a sharp breath through his clenched teeth. That didn’t make sense at all, there was no plausible way he had lost his sense of time that much. Tony racked his brain, distinctly remembering he had set multiple alarms to remind him, fully knowing that he would forget.
After Peter had finally gotten his shoes on, it didn’t take long until the unlikely pair hit the streets, the boy’s small hand wrapped in a death grip around Tony’s three fingers. Those big brown eyes were flitting every which way, trying to take in every sight of the busy life that was Midtown Manhattan. And Tony couldn’t blame the kid for attempting to choke the life out of his calloused fingers. To any human, the busy life of New York was overwhelming, much less for a kid whose only family remaining had been murdered by giant scary robots less than a month ago.
The elevator doors opened, and they were met with heavy rock music, shaking the glass panels of the workshop across the hall. Peter quickly let go of Steve’s large hand, instead clasping both of his hands to his ears, music too loud for his sensitive young ears. The Captain did the same, super serum having enhanced his hearing, making Tony’s workshop sounds too loud for his eardrums.
There was a pause from the other end of the phone; a deadly silence in which the world ceased to turn. Pepper hadn’t spoken once throughout all of his explaining, and without talking to her face, he couldn’t measure whether she was beyond pissed or cautiously indifferent. Tony waited with held breath, sitting stiffly on the bar-stool and staring down at the sparkling granite. His coffee rested on the counter next to the toaster behind him, having been forgotten in the bustle of Poptart preparing and conversing with his ex. The mug looked too lonely, and Tony
“Tony?” Steve asked, watching the man’s shoulders tense up as he jabbed at the screen harshly, “Is something wrong?”
“Mr. Steve takes me to the park!” Peter exclaimed. This was quickly followed by the sound of plastic toy colliding with plastic toy; there must have been an epic battle going on.
Steve gave Clint a hopeful smile, appreciating the reassurance, knowing that he would be feeling much differently if he didn’t have the team supporting him. He then turned to Bruce, sitting next to him on the couch. The doctor was staring intently at Tony, who was still tapping furiously at his Starkpad, offering nothing to the conversation.
“A… Uh. Hm,” Tony dug his fingernails into his knees, thinking about all the words he could use to describe what “a Howard” was. Most were inappropriate for the current audience.
“You’re a monster, you know that?” Tony grunted as he tried to grab hold of Pete’s flailing right leg, shoe-less and soon to be sock-less too, by the looks of it. How Tony had managed to put on the left shoe was a mystery.
The rest of the team sat in silence as they watched Tony’s retreating figure almost sprint to the stairs. The man never used the stairs, unless he needed to get out of the situation so fast that waiting for the elevator would be too slow. The only other time he had seen Stark take the stairs was when the team sat him down to talk about PTSD, and specifically, what was written in his file pertaining to Afghanistan.
“Unless you know a different Captain America, then yes,” Tony grumbled in response, taking another swig of coffee and deliberately ignoring her last question, “Cap insists on pushing his parental responsibilities onto me whenever he can. If I didn’t know any better, I’d think he’s roping me into a non-consensual parenthood,” but of course, he did know better. He knew that Cap didn’t see Tony in such a way that he’d want to ‘co-parent’ with him. Hell, Tony wasn’t even sure the super-soldier knew gay parenting was basically accepted nowadays.
The rest of the day went by smoothly enough, despite Peter seeming bored and agitated by Tony’s lack of ability to entertain while working on the new Stark smartphone prototype for the inevitable meeting the next day; a task that was no longer avoidable, despite how much Peter disapproved. And it ended up being clear that Peter didn’t have nearly the right amount of energy spent throughout the day, when the child didn’t immediately go to bed after a “James Buck” story. Peter’s plea to sleep with Tony and “his chest nightlight” was begrudgingly agreed to, and next thing Tony knows, Peter spends another night sleeping in the guest room with him.
The silence was finally broken by a long sigh, full of unhinged frustration. Tony grimaced in his luck. Berating it was.
“JARVIS, I had reminders in place, didn’t I? Why didn’t you tell me?” Tony spat, stress folding on itself and settling back on his shoulders. It was a heavy, familiar feeling, and not at all welcome. Something in the back of his mind supplied that this stress had not rested on his shoulders since spending all of his time taking care of Peter Parker, but Tony quickly ignored this.
“Where are you going? Don’t leave! It’s pizza night!” Peter protested, slamming his fist down on the table as he had probably seen Tony himself do a couple of times. It would have been funny, small hands curled in angry fists, if Tony wasn’t focused on what this meant for him.
Tony’s mind wandered as he leaned on the counter, staring at the empty space at the dining table on the other side of the kitchen. He had so much to do today. He had been slacking slightly on his Stark Industries responsibilities ever since Peter had become apart of the tower life. And not because he was parenting (which was
“Mr. Tony! My eyes!” the boy shrieked. All of the violent splashing had caused the sudsy water to hit Peter’s poor face, irritating his eyes with an uncomfortable sting.
“R-Rogers, I can’t- Howard was a drunk-” Tony suddenly sounded like he was pleading, and Cap really should have reeled it in, should have noticed that the man was needing the fight to stop immediately. He should have realized that he was suddenly in very dangerous territory. But he would go to hell before doing so, because Tony Stark was always able to rile him up and make him say things that were mean and biting, and this time was no exception.
But suddenly the blaring music shut off, JARVIS saying something indescribable from inside the workshop, and Tony whipped his head around to look at Steve, eyes wide in surprise. He looked as if he had been a kid caught with his hand in the cookie jar. And for some reason, Steve’s chest suddenly felt light and fluttery, causing him to give the genius a soft smile and a small wave. Tony evidently didn’t know what to do with the smile or the wave, because he frowned at the Captain before focusing his attention back on the thing in his hands. He saw the man move his lips, and suddenly the doors to the workshop slid open.
The woman shook his hand with a firm grip, grin on her face as if she were making fun of how formal he had introduced himself. By the way her wrinkles curved perfectly to the smile as if she never stopped, he could only imagine how happy of a person this woman must be, “I’m Gladus. It’s very nice to meet you.”
to see the short man stumble by, goatee with a five o’clock shadow and shirt streaked with oil stains. But Tony would never be there, and he would only feel the pit in his stomach grow deeper, knowing he’d lost something that had been important to him. The feeling of missing something that he didn’t appreciate when he had it… Tony’s absence had been what made him feel alone. He had been sad when Bucky went into the cryofreeze unit, of course he had. But Tony’s missing presence was what had made him feel alone.
“Of course darling,” and damn this lady was the classic Grandma neighbor, everything down to a ‘t’. Even her voice sounded like it had an overabundance of love and a need to make cookies, “How could I ever forget? You and your dad deserve nothing but the best berries.”
It was only then that Tony announced it was time to head back home for lunch. They both said goodbye to Gladus, who handed them both a wipe for the berry mess in their hands and a small basket of cut strawberries for the road. Peter squealed happily at the strawberries, forgetting all about the salty tears on his cheeks, munching on strawberries all the way home.
Tony looked down at his shoes and hastily detached his fingers from the hem of his shirt, using the backs of his hands to wipe away the wet, salty trails on his cheeks. He sniffled as his arms fell to his sides, and he finally looked up at the super soldier once more. Tony’s brown eyes were bloodshot, glassy from tears, and Steve was suddenly able to move again.
“Did you have a bad dream?” Tony mumbled to the boy wrapped around his legs. Peter gave a few jerky nods and sniffled.
“Got everything?” Natasha asked the Captain, who nodded quickly. They both gave Peter a goodbye peck on the cheek, Rogers gave some last few encouraging words for , and then they were gone.
Watching Peter, Tony felt an odd light lift in his chest, coupled with a deep throb lower in his rib cage. Emotion only slightly notched itself in his throat. Not the kind of emotion akin to the coming of tears, no. It felt more like fear.
Steve was surprised to see a red tint flush on Tony’s cheeks as the man smiled, watching it slightly darken the man’s tan skin. He tried to catch his breath, because there was suddenly something about Tony he felt he was missing, but desperately needed to catch. Something so familiar, and if he stared a little bit longer, maybe he’d recognize it…
Tony’s mind wildly scrambled to find an answer, which should have been easy because he was a genius. He had made a new element while dying. He could find a convincing argument for a five year old child.
Was it that obvious that he avoided calling Cap by his first name? Peter had only been around for a little while. If the child had realized by now, the rest of the Avengers must have known for ages. Oh god, what did they think? Did they know why? Did
Because of this, I made this chapter extra long (10,000 words instead of the usual 6,000); hopefully that will somehow make up for the gap in story making!
Pepper sighed deeply from the other end of the line, and for someone who didn’t know Pepper, they would have assumed she was extremely angry. But having known Pepper for so long, Tony knew she was smiling alongside her eye rolling and exasperated exhaling. He allowed himself a small grin as he gazed into the coffee mug.
He choked on an inhale, the need to laugh and the need to reprimand himself fighting for air. The five year old watched on in concern, and the mechanic just
“Howard was a dick,” Steve grumbled, a slight bout of anger snaring in his stomach. He felt betrayed,
“Pete, do you like your crusts on your bread?” Tony asked, the coffee maker gurgling happily in the background.
“Pepper, honey, nobody uses email anymore. That’s only for ‘Bed, Bath, and Beyond’ newsletters or porn blog updates, which by the way I honestly don’t know why I keep getting, because I unsubscribed forever ago-”
“So I think it’s safe to assume Stark isn’t actually okay with this whole Peter thing,” Clint announced. Steve wanted to scold him for making light of the situation, but he settled for a withering glare instead. It would not do any good to upset another teammate at the moment.
“Where are you going, Mister Tony? We have to go see the berry lady!” and he knew kids spoke gibberish sometimes, but Peter really was not making sense.
“Yes, yes, toast. Coming right up,” he conceded with a sigh, bare feet meeting the guest room carpet as he sat on the edge of the bed. Peter squealed in delight, scrambling off the bed and sprinting out of the room, running feet thumping down the hall towards the kitchen. Tony followed behind the boy, albeit much slower and without an abundant amount of energy.
Tapping ceased, finger held inches from the screen, and Steve knew he had addressed the situation too directly. It was always the freeze, a slight pause in whatever Tony was doing, before the mask slipped tight over him, becoming tight lipped about any emotions. Steve always hated these moments, watching the man close up when he deemed someone had gotten too close. He knew he wasn’t a friend, knew that they were both on thin ice around each other ever since Bucky, and he really had no right to be thinking he deserved to see under the well constructed mask. But darn it, it was hard to forget how it had been like when they were friends.
Tony fumbled with the plastic cup, accidentally dropping it into the bathtub with a splash. Peter apparently found this hilarious, because he laughed like a maniac, patting his hands on the water’s surface over and over as if he were playing patty cake with the liquid.
The pair walked up to the glass sliding doors, hands plastered to the side of their heads as they peered in. Tony could be seen at his metal workshop table, banging his head to the music as he fiddled with something in his hands. Blue holographic screens surrounded him, causing an eerie blue glow to reflect in his brown eyes. His Arc Reactor shone through an Aerosmith shirt, fabric thin from many times of wear. So much blue. Whoever insisted Tony’s colors where red and gold had never met the man, because the color was so obviously the electric blue that he surrounded himself in and housed in his chest.
“You okay down there, Pete?” Tony asked, crouching down slightly as they walked in order for the small boy to hear him. Peter’s head snapped to Tony in surprise, large brown eyes softening as he looked into the reflection of the man’s sunglasses. He gave the taller man a couple of nods before once more turning his attention to their path ahead. Tony guided Peter through the crowd in weaving movements meant to avoid as many people as possible.
“The “Star Spangled Man with a Plan’ is trying his best, I've already told you. I’m only trying to meet him in the middle which, by the way, I am doing because that’s one of the things you complained I wasn’t doing. The fact that he’s stopped ending his emails with “I eagerly await your letter” is progress,” Tony protested, because he was not about to let Pepper use Cap to make a point about ignoring her many messages.
“Um, well, you see-” he tried, his voice feeble and quickly tapering off as Pepper quickly interrupted him.
Tony tried to avoid thinking about Bucky. No, he wasn’t angry anymore. The man had been brainwashed, of course he wouldn’t have done what he had if his head had been on straight. But thinking of Bucky lead to thinking about Maria Stark in that grainy security footage, screaming and crying and not understanding what she had done to die in that moment.
“Howard only taught me how to fight. He didn’t teach me how to love a kid. He didn’t teach me how to love anyone. He taught me how to love things that didn’t have feelings. Things that can’t hurt you. I made DUM-E when I was twelve. I learned to love machines. Because that’s how Howard taught me to parent. Which is, to not parent at all…”
“The… ‘berry’ lady?” Tony asked, the pair stopping in their tracks in the middle of the walkway because apparently, taking Peter to a playground was not what the child had in mind.
And if Pepper knew this state of shock was caused by a hug from both Captain America and a five year old, she would have never let the genius forget it. It was moments like these that Tony was glad they weren’t together anymore, because Pepper would forever have held that over his head.
He expected Peter to agree, to declare that Tony was indeed the worst; a failure because he couldn't even get one freaking bath right. Instead, the boy began giggling, as if the self deprecation was entertaining.
There was a silence that followed, but the barely-there crackle of static indicated that JARVIS was very much listening, and had not powered down to leave Tony in the quiet.
“Tony, you can’t put off your work today. I needed the new models for the Stark smartphone line three days ago. R&D is expecting a prototype; capable and functional. Please tell me you at least have the sketches,” and damn if Pepper didn’t sound completely done with the whole of Tony’s existence. He couldn't necessarily blame her, she was CEO of a company where the inventor liked to create in sporadic outbursts. Therapists had concluded it was his way of distracting himself from emotions that his brain decided were better left in the subconscious. They had seemed very serious when they had told Tony as such, but quite honestly, his brain filing away unwanted emotions didn’t really sound like a bad thing.
Okay, so this is my first delve into the Avengers/Stony fandom! I live off of reviews, and any critique you want to give me :) I'm excited to get into this story and contribute to the fandom!
The Captain must have seen the panic flit across the mechanic’s face as they walked out of the room, closing the door behind them, “I’ll be gone for a week at most. I’m sure if you give Bruce a call he’ll come back early to help you out.”
Cap huffed, bowing his head and closing his eyes, hand pausing at their frantic work. The pause in hectic movement felt like taking a deep breath to Tony, as if the air between them had settled with a simple pause of motion. Even so, his piercing grip on his own arms did not let up.
The boy nodded again and detached himself from the man’s legs, instead reaching a small hand out and curling it around two fingers on Tony’s right hand.
In a haze, he paid Gladus the two dollars needed for the biodegradable basket of blackberries, and followed Pete as the boy ran to the edge of the lake to feed the ducks. Tony never really saw such an activity as feeding ducks to be so exciting, but here Peter was, throwing berries in the lake with such enthusiasm, as if his life would amount to this moment, and only this moment.
he could hear desk drawers opening and slamming shut, possibly looking for a Starkpad to contact her new lover with.
“I dunno. Not something one normally brings up,” the genius muttered, words muffled by their embrace. Tony sniffed again, this time accompanied by a shaky, steadying sigh. The Captain liked to think the comfort was helping the man, running his hand up and down his back, chin resting lightly on his head.
