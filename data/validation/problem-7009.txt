Steve darts back into the house to get his sketchbook as Tony pushes through the water, doing countless numbers of laps. Occasionally, he pauses at the end of the pool – leaning over the glass edge to look down at the ocean below. The sunlight glints off the dark red of his helmet, and he should look ridiculous, but he doesn’t.
“You left your keys,” Steve informs him as he sits down in front of Tony. He sets the ice pack on Tony’s knee, watching the other man as he grimaces and moves it onto the fabric of his shorts, a red mark left behind on tan skin from the sudden cold. “Here.” Steve pulls the keys out of his pocket, extending them towards Tony. Tony takes them, his fingers brushing over the inside of Steve’s wrist – every movement is calculated.
The last time he had been in a hospital in Berlin, there had been a new piece of machinery in his chest.
Steve reaches out without thinking, his fingers brushing over the shaven side of Tony’s head, Tony’s eyes close at the touch. This is the first time Steve has touched him since the hospital – mostly due to Tony’s self imposed incarceration in the second bedroom.
“I’ve missed you,” he murmurs, his tongue pressing past Steve’s lips, running over his teeth, the inside of his cheek, his tongue. “God, I’ve missed you so much.”
“Alright, fine. Fine. You don’t want to talk about it? Fine. I don’t want to talk about it.” Tony wipes at his lips with the napkin he had spread across his lap, his hands mercifully steady. “You can ask about the kid, I can ask about Nat – but we shouldn’t… You know… Otherwise, we’ll both just fight. The last time I fought with you, I nearly died, so…”
Steve’s hand wraps around him and Tony’s hips buck at the touch. Half a dozen quick, tight strokes of his hand, and one well-timed twist of his wrist and Tony shudders apart in his arms, gasping his name breathlessly.
Gently, his fingers curl under Tony’s now smooth jaw, tipping his head away from his abdomen. Tony’s proximity to him had been distracting, and arousing. His breath had been hot, Steve’s skin had heated in response to it ghosting through his shirt.
UN officials start getting up from the table, Tony still lost in thought, trying to figure out exactly how Wanda would be able to sleep with Vision – could Vision fabricate external genitalia?
Tony’s breathing grows harsh, and there’s rustling on the other end, like he’s trying to twist out of the phone booth to see anything he can tell Steve.
? But that would be cruel, and Tony is already cringing away, as if Steve’s rejection will feel like a physical blow. “Course you can, Tony. I won’t even complain if you snore.”
Steve holds the scissors above Tony’s head, his hair slipping between the teeth of the comb that Steve runs through it. Tony holds his breath as the scissors snick through his hair.
“Why does it matter?” Tony snaps, but he looks up at the dark sky regardless, flecks of snow landing on his eyelashes. He loved the snow – he used to – but Siberia had taken that from him. Afghanistan had stolen the beach from him, and Siberia the snow. “Yeah, it’s snowing."
Then again, he had endured a five year long dry spell. There had been opportunities, yes, and he had almost given in – but in the end, they were never Steve Rogers, and he was never truly interested.
Steve admires Tony’s profile as he cooks, the way his jaw sets, the curve of his nose. He moves with a quiet confidence through the kitchen, never second guessing himself as he tosses ingredients onto the pan. He idly wonders how many relationships Tony has been in during which he’s allowed himself to cook for his significant other. Pepper, for sure – and now Steve. Soon, Tony is humming under his breath, a slight smile on his face as everything seems to be coming together. Steve has seen this expression before, but only when Tony was working on a suit – always working.
Tony sighs as he looks at him, leaning back against the door. The sunlight pours in from the curtains, which stir at the slight breeze – Tony had opened the windows before going to the bathroom, wanting to breathe in fresh air. The light dances over Steve’s back, shadows and glow, catching streaks of gold in his now dark hair. Tony’s mouth had left a purple bruise on the curve of his shoulder, so Tony leans down over the bed and presses his lips to it. Steve stirs, his hand grabbing at the hem of Tony’s shirt, trying to pull him down onto the bed.
No one seems particularly convinced, but the discussion ceases. Steve will step out into the woods tomorrow, onto the platform that Bruce and Scott have built, and he will return the Stones to their rightful locations. That’s not all, though, he has Tony’s spare Pym particle. He had tucked it into Steve’s pocket alongside the soil samples Bruce is occasionally working on. All he needs is one, anyways – there’s no use coming back here, not when he can see Tony. See him alive. Spare him.
“We’re not even friends,” Tony snaps. “We’re work colleagues, if anything. You work with me because you have to, because I give you neat stuff. Just once, I wanted – I wanted you to like me, the minute you met me. Because you were my idol, Steve, honest to God. Yeah, you caused a bit of a sexual crisis for me, too – but at the end of the day, I wanted to be you as much as I wanted to sleep with you. And now you can’t even bring yourself to see something from my point of view, because you’re so… sickeningly self-righteous. Dad never featured that personality trait in his stories – no, the mighty Captain America was
“Mr. Stark,” Peter’s voice is strained, trembling hands hovering over the ruined flesh of Tony’s abdomen. “Mr. Stark, you’re going to – what can I do? How can I help?”
The surgeon raises his eyebrows, “Then it’s a damn miracle he got out of there with only a skull fracture and internal damage – usually we see broken limbs.”
“You’re a romantic,” Steve says dryly, but his heart feels a little lighter in his chest. “I don’t consider being in love with you akin to damning myself.”
“Don’t be stupid,” Steve assures him, though the blonde moves towards him, lifting an arm to steady him. Tony’s fist lands hard on his abdomen, and he hears air puff out between Steve’s lips.
Steve moves to pull his hand away, but before he can, Tony’s grabbed it – his fingers lace between Steve’s easily, and he hears Tony sigh.
Tony hates hospitals, and just like that, he can hear the dull ringing of the vitals monitor sounding the alarm – blood pressure rising, pulse racing.
“I could kill you,” Tony says quietly, fingers still hovering. “I could. I’ve got a suit now, with me. All it would take is a tap of my fingers, and I could blast your fucking brains out. I should have, in Siberia – but I held back. I held back, and you didn’t.”
Steve picks up his keys, climbing off the step – his knees ache, and he must be imagining it – surely the serum would prevent degenerative joint pain. “Sure. Wanna come?”
He sets Tony’s hand down, lifting up the other. “Rookie mistake. You’re lucky you didn’t break your fingers. They’re just gonna hurt like hell for the next couple of days.”
Tony swallows again, Steve can feel his heart racing against his chest, and as he waits, he brushes his fingers over the patch of dark hair just above Tony’s reactor. Tony’s breathing hitches.
Tony glances at the sun, squinting against it. “Is it? Oops. Don’t worry, Cap, I’m just… Making improvements.”
“Why’d you come back to New York?” Steve asks quietly, the dark hair on Tony’s arm soft against his fingertips – there’s not much left of him that hasn’t been hardened by years of solitude.
“I can’t believe you betray the Yankees like that,” Tony shakes his head, pulling Steve’s comforter up over his shoulders.
It takes two passes of 108th and Madison before Steve finally catches sight of him – or someone that could be him. A body is sprawled out facedown in the beginning of an alleyway, a socked foot visible in the dim circle of light from the streetlight above it. Steve runs over to the shadowed form, hoodie slung over his shoulder.
“Yup,” Steve shakes his head slightly, watching Tony’s shoulders shift down as some of the tension leaks out of them. “I’ve been bleeding for a while now, I think I can handle a couple more minutes. You want to walk out of here with catcher’s mitts for hands?”
“I mean – I have an electric razor…” Steve looks over at Tony curiously. “Don’t you usually get like… three hundred dollar haircuts?”
“I’m not going to punch you, Tony,” Steve says, gesturing to one of the chairs. “Go on, sit down. I’ll help you unwrap your hands.”
“Oh ye of little faith,” Tony’s voice echoes from the bathroom, and Steve grins, stretching out on the bed – wonderfully sore. His smile fades when Tony emerges from the bathroom, wearing his trousers and shirt from the night before – and drowning in Steve’s leather jacket.
The world, having lost so much already, does not take note when Tony Stark disappears. Steve Rogers does. Once every three months or so, Pepper Potts would alert him to a large cash withdrawal made from Tony Stark’s private bank account. Always in big cities – Miami, Seattle, Las Vegas, Dallas, New Orleans – never New York. Steve would throw himself onto the Quinjet the moment Pepper notified him, and he would spend a week in the city Tony had made a withdrawal from, hoping to catch sight of him. Five years had gone by, and he had never seen Tony – no one had heard from him, not even Pepper. The only reason they knew Tony was alive at all was because of these large withdrawals, made on the first of every third month. Steve would watch the grainy security footage on the flight, blue eyes focused on the blurry image of Tony Stark – bearded, with shaggy hair, and always wearing sunglasses.
“It’s beautiful,” Steve says honestly, closing his eyes as Tony’s fingers move swiftly over the keys with more confidence.
“You might wanna take your shirt off, unless you wanna get hair everywhere.” Steve is knelt down in front of his bathroom cabinet, digging through medical and cleaning supplies on the hunt for the razor.
He sighs, turning his head to look out over the dock. It’s early afternoon, and Steve hadn’t sent him his flight details through a text as he usually did. Tony watches the boats rock with the waves, tensing when a flock of seagulls fly overhead.
“Why are you wearing a helmet?” Steve asks as he shades over the crest of Tony’s bicep, frowning down at his drawing.
He starts to pace, his hands behind his back, wondering what Steve would think if he just bolted. Even if Steve pulled his punches, it would sure as shit still hurt, right? Was Steve even capable of holding back? Tony really doesn’t want to have his head busted open, but it might actually help alleviate his headache – and just because Steve was holding back didn’t mean that Tony had to. Maybe he could beat some sense into him.
“Tony.” Steve stops a few paces in front of him, keeping his distance. He reaches out a hand towards him, and then lowers it to his side.
Steve’s hands move to rest on his own hips, looking at him thoughtfully. “Yeah, that sounds nice. Are you gonna wash up?”
“Tony,” Steve shifts in the armchair, uncomfortable with how the conversation is progressing. “You tried to kill him.”
“Is it snowing?” Steve asks him suddenly, his tone is cautious – but Tony swears he can hear a faint hint of terror. Thousands of miles away, and unable to catch Tony were his feet to slip – and they likely will, even in the cold, he’s dripping with sweat.
Steve makes his way to Tony’s room the following morning, his breakfast roiling around in his stomach. He holds a bouquet of sunflowers in his hand, recalling Tony’s favorite flowers – there was always a vase of them in their apartment in Paris. Steve had not been to that apartment in over five years, whatever sunflowers they had left there had no doubt withered and died. He peers his head in the doorway to Tony’s room, watching sunlight play off of the copper strands of Pepper Potts’ hair.
Steve isn’t in the shower, though, and he’s (unfortunately) completely clothed. He’s wearing blue shorts, which makes Tony laugh, he’s never seen Steve’s bare legs before. They’re muscular, of course they are, but pale.
The line goes dead, and Steve’s lips curl into a snarl, barely resisting the urge to throw the flip phone at the door and crush it beneath his foot. Instead, Steve throws open his front door and takes the steps down to the street two at a time – the engine of his motorcycle revs between his thighs, and he twists the throttle – he had never seen Tony cry in his life.
Natasha Romanoff sounds cautiously optimistic, which is a first for Steve since Thanos. “Steve? Scott Lang is here. You’re gonna wanna come hear what he has to say.”
Tony will rub the back of his neck hesitantly, fingers shifting through dark brown curls. Steve’s fingers will itch to knock Tony’s hand away and run his fingers through Tony’s thick hair, but instead he’ll reach forward with his left hand and unzip Tony’s jeans in turn. Tony will arch against him when Steve’s hand wraps around the both of them, and he’ll press his face against Steve’s neck with a muffled sob.
Steve’s arms are around him, catching him before he can hit the ground, and Tony could weep as he catches a faint hint of Steve’s cologne swirling around him. The smell makes him feel sick.
“Are you complaining?” Steve’s voice is low, his fingers brushing down the bumps of Tony’s spine, running over the curve of his ass.
“You want to bill me for the cottage?” Tony fixes the napkin on his lap as his main course is set in front of him – a filet of beef, roasted fall vegetables, and a nice scoop of mashed potatoes. American enough, he had figured, for Steve’s palate. “I’ll gladly pay half.”
“I said leave — fucking leave, get out of here!” Tony reaches behind him to grab his pillow, ready to heave it at Steve’s head, but Steve is already retreating.
“I got clipped by some shrapnel,” Tony says dismissively, extending his hand to Steve, pen trembling slightly in his grip. “Nothing I’ve not experienced before. The Accords, Steve.”
The back of Steve’s head smarts as Tony shoves him forcefully against the door, he hadn’t expected this reaction from Tony – in fact, he thought that showing himself as Steve Rogers in Russia would please Tony.
“Pep,” Tony’s voice grates, her fingertips brushing over his jaw, and the vitals monitor silences as he relaxes.
“I have a flight,” Tony repeats halfheartedly, allowing Steve to pull him down on top of him as he kisses him slowly.
Tony is an addict, though, to many things. Alcohol, chiefly. In the 90s, a smattering of drugs. Now, he wants to hear Steve say his name – needs to hear Steve say his name.
Tyra: “Yeah You! So, you think this just a typical episode of Top Model, Uh-uh. The last two seasons we had a whole week of auditions to pick out the finalist, this season we already picked the top 14.”
The servers are each labeled San Junipero and assigned a number... San Junipero server1, San Junipero server2... and so on
Okoye, Shuri, Wanda and Hope claim the Tokyo Room. And both Peters, Nebula and Carol claim the Milan room. Everybody is ecstatic, but Tony is walking in and out of rooms seeing everyone has a bed.
“And is Peggy here?” Tony gestures.  “No, she’s…” Steve indicates ‘somewhere else’.  “Elsewhere?” Tony questions.  “Yeah” Steve answers.  “Uh-huh” Tony pauses, “you want to go to bed with me?  We could be back at mine like…” he clicks his fingers.  “I never did anything like that” Steve says super nervously, with a slight blush in his cheeks.
Steve walks onto set. Lots of whistling and catcalling commence, Steve just smirks. Hero name: Captain America. Item to sell: Jewelry (shield covered in diamonds.) Steve begins to pose. Phil: “Steve was amazing, every pose he did was super editorial and definitely sold more than his shield.” *Steve, 26: “I rocked that photoshoot, so I hope I get best photo.”
Steve stands beside the road, almost the middle of nowhere.  He looks at a napkin in his hand, with a scribbled map on it, given to him by the barman.  In front of him is a gate with a dirt track behind it.  Beside it, on a small pole, is a sort of entry buzzer with the word 'Quagmire' where the residential name would be.  He pushes the button.
The doctor leads Tony to a small private room.  He opens the door for Tony, then waits outside the room.  He follows Tony as he walks inside.  Tony can hear the soft beep of a monitoring device.  The percussive rise and fall of a mechanical ventilator.  "He won't be able to physically respond in anyway, but he can hear you." Dr. Banner starts heading out the door, "I'll give you some privacy."
“San Junipero’s a party town.  All up for grabs,” Tony replies, “midnight’s two hours away”, he continues.  Tony’s inched in a little more.  Steve is almost shaking now, with nerves and excitement.  “That’s not long”, Steve replies.  Tony brushed confetti away from Steve’s neck.  Then, leans in and talks quietly, almost in his ear, “Why waste time sitting here?”.  He puts his hand on Steve’s inner thigh.  Steve exhales as if with vertigo.
"I was married to a woman, a long time I was married... I always 'knew', I mean, I would be attracted to other guys, coworkers, friends, some waiter who'd serve me..."  Tony laughs at his memory, "There were crushes, My god were there crushes."  His face hardens slightly, he continues, "Never acted on any of it.  Never did anything.  I was in love with her, I
Moments later she’s standing beside him, watching him progress over his shoulder.  It takes her a to pluck up the courage to speak, “you’re good at this.”
“Old times’ sake,” Tony slightly pauses, “I’d figure they were kind of a fashion statement-” “Really?” Steve says shockingly.  “-but then the rest of your outfit is… not”
It's 1987 on a look out point looking out to San Junipero.  Steve sees a plane fly by, he gets up. He climbs into a black Toyota MR2 and drives it out of the lot.  He slides a cassette into the deck and hits play.  It's Belinda Carlisle,
Shortly afterwards, a young gal named Natasha spots Steve on the Bubble Bobble machine.  She’s faintly preppy, a bit like a young Molly Ringwald.  She’s holding a drink with a straw which she seems ill-at-ease with, she’s nodding her head in time to the music, badly.
Tony starts talking, "I'm saying there's plenty of other guys for you Carol.  Ones you should actually settle down with."  "The locals?"  Carol says disgusted, "they're like dead people--"  Just then a nearby party- going group walk past- a man, whoops.
Nebula, Carol, Shuri and Hope start crying, because this is it, there’s no chance they’re going to make it. Tony is telling Peter Parker that everything is going to be okay. Steve is now looking determined, putting an arm around Thor and Okoye.
"And I'm dying." Tony holds Steve's head up, "Whatever you are can't scare me.  Let me come visit.  I wanna say hi."
“I joined the avengers a few months after they left.  It was only Tony, Rhodey, Peter and I as the avengers.  Whatever mission the UN gave us we completed.  When he felt comfortable, he told me about his childhood, and his love for you.  He then told me his plan.”
“While fighting you, Sir had to take drastic measures.  From what he observed, you were willing to keep him alive.  So, he did what he never wanted to do.”
Tyra: “Next person is… Virginia.” She breathes a sigh of relief and heads over to the stage. “Could, Bruunhilde come on over.” Fist bumping the air, she gladly walks over. “Next model is Maria!” Tyra says with enthusiasm. And Maria lets go of the people holding her and runway walks over to the “
Phil: “Welcome. I heard some of you whisper the name of the lady next to me, miss Erin Wason. Today you will be in a runway show, wearing jewelry designed by Erin.” The models cheer.
Tony is racing, at speed, down the freeway.  A coastal road.  Steve winces slightly as they skid around a bend.  Tony in a voice raised over the engine, "RELAX, WHAT'S THE WORST THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN?"  Steve looks out the window.  Then back at Tony, "How long have you been here?" Steve asks.  "Sorry?"
Tony interrupts, "Well if you just want someone to fuck, there's options, hang out at the Quagmire again--"
Tony wants to address something, "So.  This 'marriage'...?"  Peggy finishes her coffee and exhales.  "State's got a triple-lock on euthanasia cases," counting on her fingers, "you gotta have sign off from the doc, the patient, and a family member.  Stops people from passing over just 'cause they prefer San Junipero flat out."  Elderly Tony sardonically looks around the dowdy cafeteria, "Who'd want to leave all this wonder?"  Peggy chuckles lightly before she starts talking, "Anyhow Steve's family?  Big time religious.  Don't come to fucking see him- pardon my tongue- but they're big time religious, and they won't sign."
Tyra: “We hired 12 actors to pretend to be fellow models, and we’ll announce them as the finalist. While the true contestants think they’re going home, we’ll reveal the truth. Harsh? Honey, the modeling world is even more harsh.”
Steve takes a few moments to breathe in and out.  “Fine.  I’ll Listen to you.  But this won’t change my mind about Stark.”
The Milan room. “I Fucking Fell in The Pool!” Carol exclaims as she says coming back from a shower. “Hey, I slipped if that makes you feel any better.” Quill tries to comfort. *Carol, 25: “First challenge and I humiliate myself in front of Erin Wason and Runway coach Nick Fricking Fury” she pouts, “he’s never going to let me forget it too.” Nebula just cackles from the top of her bunk.
A happy Steve walks out of the New York room and sees a sad Tony sitting in the lounge alone. He walks over, “Hey what’s wrong?” he asks. Tony looks at him with gloomy brown eyes and replies, “I don’t have a bed, so I’m getting to know the couch.” Steve chuckles a bit, then sits next to Tony, “Come on, I have a queen, we can share.” He pulls Tony up and takes him into the New York room. Steve leads him to the bed, “Here, I don’t care what side you sleep on.” “Thanks,” is all Tony can say.
The executive producer gathers everyone in front of the stairs. Everyone looks so defeated. Then, the producer begins to speak. “Tyra always feels bad about this and likes to say goodbye before you all leave.”
"Steve hardens, "I don't want you to.  I don't want you to see me."  Steve is emotional, "I mean I'm scared-"
San Junipero, sunset.  Steve stands by the side of the road, waiting, staring at the waves crash onto the beach.  He has no thoughts, his eyes reflect the sunlight in the distance.  Suddenly, Tony pulls up in his 1987 Jeep, 'I Need Love' by LL Cool J is blasting on the stereo.  The red jeep has a giant white bow on the front, and Tony is wearing a puffy 80's white tuxedo.  Steve laughs, and with instinct, has his hand on his peck, and is almost out of breath from the laughter.
just sex."  Carol is a little wounded,"But.  No..."  Tony takes her hand, "I'm done with attachments.  I went down that road.  For a long time.  And it's... I can't do that again.  No roots."  He puts his hand on her cheek, "We had fun.  I'm sorry" Tony begins to turn around, "Enjoy the town for god's sake."  Carol nods, she knows she's beaten, Tony heads for the bar.
Erin: “Not only will you be wearing my jewelry, but you will also be wearing clothes designed by my friend, mister Alexander Wang.” The models are hysterical, they cannot believe they are walking in an Alexander Wang fashion show.
Various shots of Steve, Nebula and Thor posing in front of a grey background while a camera is taking their pictures.
Tony touches his face, "You want to get in my car?"  Steve looking at the floor, nods.  "Then let's do that" Tony continues.  Tony leads Steve out via fire escape, walks to the car.  He opens the passenger door.  Steve hesitates, starring at the car a moment.  "I got to lift you up and put you in?" Tony teases, Steve gets in.
A voice suddenly appears, “You clearly never knew Sir.  Captain Rogers, how do you think you won the fight against Sir.  He was a futurist, he always had extra suits for reinforcements, do you really think one destroyed suit is the reason for his demise.”
Tyra: “That’s right, me and the judges sat through hours of tapes and selected our finalist. We wanted to start the competition right away, but I want to have a little fun. So, why not pull a prank on our finalist this episode.”
"Can we just enjoy tonight?" Tony is Trying to change the subject.  Steve checks his watch, "It's ten to midnight, you're out of here in ten and we gotta wait a week to meet again."  Tony tries to reassure himself, "You know I'm just a visitor..."  "For how long? Couple months?  Then what?" Steve asks more aggressively.  "We're not discussing this..." Tony is trying his best to end this conversation. But Steve isn't allowing it, "Then you'll be gone, just gone!  You could have forever!"  Steve is now sounding like a San Junipero sales ad and Tony isn't buying it "Forever?  Who could even make sense of forever..."  "How ever long you want then, you can remove yourself like that..." he snaps his fingers, "it's not a trap, it's... look at it!"  Steve gestures around.  He then taps the hood of the car again insistently.  Still tapping the hood, "Touch it," Steve says confidently.
Tony closes his eyes and lets out a breath. He’s a weak, broken man. What’s the use in pretending otherwise?
When conversation between them lulled, Bucky often drifted off into what looked to be a daydream at first glance, eyes filled with longing, subdued and far away.
and tell me that you fucked up. I want you to stop hiding behind the serum and the shield and all the Captain America bullshit and just be Steve.”
“I know.” Steve shoved his feet into a pair of slippers and followed the nurse out of the room, down the hallway, and into the cafeteria.
As quickly as it comes it fades, leaving a lingering sensation of pitiful desperation that makes Tony want to retch again.
Flat and detached, as if he’s talking about someone else’s broken body, he explains, “I had a few broken ribs. One of them had dislodged some bone shards in a few places and collapsed one of my lungs. With the pre-existing heart issues, it was touch and go for a while there.”
He also knows that when he doesn’t rise to the challenge, it’ll take the wind right out of Tony’s sails. Tony gives him an uncertain look, then throws the Accords down on the conference room table.
Steve drew a rattling breath and clenched Tony tighter against his chest. “I promise. I love you, I’m sorry. I love you so much.”
Security clearances are altered and necessities are ordered. He overrides the master protocols that existed for Steve the last time he’d set foot in the building and deploys a small army of cleaning bots to the individual apartments for maintenance and upkeep that hasn’t been completed since repairs had resolved the hole Wanda’d blown through the Compound.
It hadn’t been a big concern – they had an eclectic mixture of family and Steve wasn’t even sure if he could have children after the serum. Bucky hadn’t brought it up outright, but had shared similar sentiments in passing. If anything, they’d expand their family in other ways if it came up.
By the time he gets back to the Compound, he has five new text messages from Rhodey, and one from Pepper which turns out to be from earlier anyway; a reminder for dinner that evening that he ignores, for now.
It’s a valid question because Tony remembers how destroyed he was after the last time. Which was supposed to be
He doesn’t get Bucky. Not really. But he can begrudgingly admit that he likes him more and more as time goes by. It’s not so hard to see why Steve cares for him.
“And you were such an ass.” Steve rolled onto his side and pressed Tony into the mattress to run a hand through his hair. He kissed the sleep from his mouth, watching him stretch luxuriously like a cat reaching into wakefulness.
“At least call Steve. Call him down here so I don’t – I can’t – I don’t want to hurt you again.” He felt pathetic and close to tears. “Tony, please.”
“Anything you want. One, two, a half dozen. Although with Peter it really does feel like we have one already, sometimes, doesn’t it?”
The arm is easy enough to install, Shuri having cleaned up the joint and taken care of the majority of the docking port work back in Wakanda. They work for almost two hours before the arm is attached and functional, running through a series of tests like a dream.
Steve opens for him, readjusting and tipping his hips up, reaching out with his arms, curling around Tony entirely as the wet heat of his body welcomes Tony inside and Tony can bury himself to the hilt. Everything narrows into Steve’s eyes on his, the clench of his ass around Tony’s cock, the taste of his mouth, and Tony drives into him with slow rolls of his hips.
Everything else is fuzzy behind Steve, but it feels familiar. Maybe they’re in their bedroom in the Tower, sinking into the oversized mattress.
A desperate whine dragged Steve back from his memories and he jerked his head up. Tony was still asleep, his face contorted against the pillows.
It’s been weeks now, and nothing comes to mind. He finishes errant projects, developing a series of new plans for upgrades for the Avengers, and revisiting where things are at in clean energy these days. Tony can’t help but feel that all of these things are simple fillers, activities he gives himself to pass the time while he does nothing at all.
The sobs come at double-time, taking over until there’s no air left in his lungs. The grief feels like a downpour.
There isn’t a thought in Steve’s mind, not a whisper of plan or the next move. They’re gone. They’re
There’s no hurry, no desperate flurry to race against the clock. Steve sucks marks into Tony’s neck, working his way down to his collarbone. “I dream about you every night. Only you. Always you. Then I wake up alone and I wait all day to see you again.”
Tony must be flushing pink all over, he thought absently, shocked to the core with the intense desire Bucky was radiating across their bond.
Peter is making excuses for why he really needs to be getting home, even though Clint and Sam are already at him to commit to a day to spar with them both.
. As if he amounts to less than garbage and all that matters is a series of letters and numbers wrapped up in gold-titanium alloy. As if the man inside is devoid of value. As if Tony himself is—was—nothing at all.
There’s no answers to any of the questions. There’s nothing more they can say, and the world doesn’t need any more platitudes. The whole world weeps, and they aren’t going to be able to fix it this time.
what they do, what they’ve always done, but he doesn’t want to fight anymore. He’s so tired, and they can fight tomorrow if they have to. He just wants to feel Steve all around him and maybe pretend that things really can go back to normal this easily.
Tony seals their mouths together, sucking Steve’s tongue into his mouth right before he flies apart, the orgasm ripping through him and stealing all the air from the room, let along his lungs. For a moment, he swears that he’s reached some higher plane of existence, that Steve has fucked him right into the fourth dimension.
Bruce had brought him a durian, which had stunk up the entire Tower and led to the strict implementation of a no-smelly-foods-in-the-house rule. When Clint brought him a wedge of blue cheese later that week, they made him try it on the roof. Smell wise, it had hardly compared by half.
He starts with Bucky and what they made him into, most of which Tony already knows, and Steve knows why he starts there. Maybe it’ll soften the blow, but when he gets to what Bucky’s done to his father, his mother, it’s like he’s holding Tony under water and watching him flounder. It’s as if Steve’s the one that’s taken his parents away from him.
“Greedy.” Bucky grunted in his ear, picking up the pace now that Tony’s perched on his lap. He was hitting that sweet spot with every thrust and it was just on the right side of too much. Tony’s mind seemed to come apart at the edges, unravelling as he let his head loll back, taking in Bucky’s pinched brow between the slits of his eyelids.
Tony and Steve are in Siberia, only Peter is there instead of Barnes. It can end one of two ways: Tony watching as Steve beats Peter to death with the shield, the Spider-Man mask floating past his feet in a river of blood, or Tony, feeling Steve’s life slip away through his fingers as he and Peter destroy Captain America and fight for their lives.
When Bucky suggests a late-night spar, Steve follows him out of the room and Tony finds himself alone again. As if by magic, Bucky appears more and more, verbally stepping between him and Steve whenever Steve engages Tony directly. When things heat up during meals, or in the middle of a drill, and even when they’re all piled around the conference room table, Bucky is a constant source of safety between them.
“Cutting it close, babe.” Tony taps a finger against his cheek and pads across the room to root through the heap of clothes for his boxers. Strips of fabric from where Steve has literally torn his clothes off his body make him groan, exaggerated for Steve’s amusement.
Pulling a body pillow he’d acquired from somewhere in the Compound – Wanda’s, maybe – closer to his chest, Tony pressed his face deep into the blankets. The nest had started slowly, scenting of all of the Avengers, until it had morphed into something else entirely.
Steve hesitates in the doorway and doesn’t speak. He opens his mouth more than once, but the words don’t come.
Steve imagines it would be a challenge to find any man without regrets in his life. Perhaps his regrets are more massive than most, revolving around missed opportunities and the mistakes he’s made along the way but underneath that regret is a surprising sense of peace. It settles heavily on his shoulders and is not entirely unwelcome.
“Tony? Tony!” Tony stares at him, wide-eyed, before he starts to convulse. His body bends and shakes at inhuman angles and Steve can’t look away when he starts to gasp, ugly, disturbing sounds wretched from his throat. “Fuck. Fuck, no. Tony, no! Please, no. We did it. You did it. Tony!”
Rhodey pats him firmly on the back, and clearly sees the worry that’s bubbling just below the surface because the pat turns into a grab and Rhodey’s pulling him into a hug. It lasts just long enough that Tony feels the anxiety ebb off at the top.
It had been a secret for years, and a dangerous one. Alpha-Alpha relationships were simply not done. Not before Steve went into the ice anyway – hadn’t that been an unexpected surprise – because back then, depending on who you asked, it was a crime against the natural process.
“Shh,” Tony presses his forehead into the space between Steve’s shoulders as he struggles and Tony’s voice goes soft. “It’s okay. You’re beautiful like this Steve, so small and perfect. You don’t have to be Captain America here. Just let go, honey.”
Slumping against the window, Steve has to hold him up while Tony’s breathing evens out and he shuts his eyes against the technicolour blur of New York at night. Why he’d ever left New York for Malibu, he’ll never know.
Tony hopped off the couch and pulled Bucky up after him. “We don’t need him. I’ll tell you everything you need to know.” He assured Bucky, Steve trailing after them laughing as if he were an afterthought.
Steve just laughs, shaking his head as he reaches for the catches and pries the shirt off, Tony’s fingers following soon after in a searing trail up from his stomach to his chest.
A man he’d been protecting and hunting down for over a year without so much as a word to his husband.
Whatever the reason, he stays, eyes locked with Steve’s stormy blues that give him a window into the squalling emotions underneath.
Steve undresses in the same clinical way he always has, something leftover from the war that he never managed to shake. Even when Tony would strip him slow and languid, pausing to enjoy the little cuts of skin that appeared beneath shirts or through parted buttons, Steve would get flustered and pull everything off all at once.
Happy insists on watching old reruns of Downton Abbey, and when Pepper visits, she covers Steve in blankets when he drifts off on the couch. When he wakes, there’s a marker in his book placed on the coffee table. Pepper smiles across from him in the overstuffed armchair with the same softness he’s seen her offer Tony when he’s passed out on the leather couch in the workshop.
. You don’t get to make that call. Never again, understand? We don’t do this. You don’t ever do that, and so help me Thor, if you do it ever again, I’ll fucking kill you. I’ll bring you back to life just to kill you myself.”
“We’re not perfect people.” Tony tugs at Steve’s wrist, dragging him back down until Steve’s face is hovering over his own.
They laugh together before Tony finishes showing off all the additions he’s made to the floor, fielding the rest of Rhodey’s questions about B.A.R.F. from where he’s sunken into the centre of an over-indulgent bean bag chair.
“He’s not going to like that.” Steve grumbled low in his chest, concerned, but still scrambling up after him and rooting around in his dresser. It was two pairs of shrunken sweats tossed towards the garbage before he came up successful.
So, what if it would be nice for Clint to have a new style of exploding errors for their target practice tomorrow? Sue him.
It’s easy to see that Steve is letting him have this, letting him take what he wants because in all other things Steve Rogers is an immovable block of stone. He tugs Tony up against his front, plastering them together and slipping a hand under the back of his jacket to ruck up his shirt and get at bare skin.
“I’ve got you. You feel so good—couldn’t stop if I wanted to. Never going to stop.” Tony drives back into him, slamming against his hips until everything narrows to the rough glide of Tony’s cock against his prostate and the way his fist flies over Steve’s cock, twisting under the head until stars dance at the edge of his vision.
“We wouldn’t be here if there were anyone else,” Scott cuts in. He’s twitchy and awkward. It makes Steve grit his teeth and shove his hands into his pockets, going for an air of casual he doesn’t feel. He shoots a sharp look at Morgan when she appears back in the doorway, and she scampers into the house.
But it’s also Bucky holding Steve back, physically, when he gets in his face and telling him to knock it off when he pushes too hard. It’s the hard line of Bucky’s body separating them when Steve crosses the line again and again.
The glitter of his wedding ring catches Steve’s attention, and suddenly the anticipation dissolves into something different, something more significant. He swallows hard, the prickle of tears in his eyes because this is his husband.
Steve turned away, emotion thickening in the back of his throat. Across the room, something moved behind the criss-crossed, reinforced glass.
“Let me make myself incredibly clear,” Tony says quietly, breath wafting over Steve’s face. He smells like mint with the undernotes of rich, decadent coffee and everything Steve’s ever loved about their life together. With a deliberate motion, he lets his tongue dart out and lick his bottom lip, rejoicing at the way Tony’s eyes darken and stay transfixed on his mouth. “None of this, not one goddamn second, has ever been about Barnes.”
Dr. Strange arrives at one of the smaller meetings of the newly enacted and, frankly shaky at best, Accords Committee. The timing couldn’t have been better, and Tony suspects he’s done that on purpose, because all the notable representation from across the globe, and the key players from the World Security Council are present and on edge.
They’re two magnets, spinning around each other, preparing to collide. Everything in him is drawn to Tony, even now, even like this. Steve’s been so fucking lonely with the weight of the world on his shoulders and there’s something inside him itching to let it go. If Tony wants it, he can have it.
The pair stripped Tony near naked in seconds, pants shucked off and boxers tugged low enough that the head of Tony’s cock was already free and trapped tight to his belly. He was hard, leaking already, and gooseflesh rose over his skin as one of Steve’s fingers dragged along the tip, spreading slippery moisture across the head.
“Tony,” Steve says softly, crossing the room and wrapping his arms around him. Tony goes like a ragdoll, pulled into Steve’s embrace. He kisses the sweaty hair under Tony’s ear. “You’re already my family. But if you want to add kids to that equation one day, I’m not going to say no.”
Tony can feel it in the way that his stomach doesn’t register hunger, and the cold has stopped aching in his extremities. The ache in his chest has disappeared too, it hasn’t hurt in days.
“Yeah, I’m fucking hurt.” Tony's left hand is trembling violently against the desk. Guilt cloys in the back of Steve’s throat, rife with emotions he’s not prepared to deal with.
“Barnes can fight his own battles and you can’t make Steve be something he’s not. It’s horrible to watch, Tony. Like some kind of self-flagellation and you hardly deserve to be punished anymore.”
Tony grits his teeth, the urge to punch Steve a quick violence that rises and crests on a wave of resentment before shifting into something more.
Three months had passed since the Battle for Earth and each new day felt increasingly bleak and dreary. The Avengers were recovering, each in their own way, alongside the rest of the world and Steve remembered the words he had spoken so many times before in his support group.
“Maybe in a way, it is. This doesn’t come natural to me, Tony. I’m not sure it ever will. It’s killing me not to tell you what I think. But do I know that I should keep my mouth shut?” Steve ducks his head and gives Tony a rueful look. “Absolutely.”
“You can’t do this!” Steve keeps screaming it, over and over again. “You can’t do this! Don’t fucking do this!”
Steve was gentle, oh so gentle, when the first hints of a nightmare had started. They’d prepped Tony beforehand to make things simpler, and Steve had been able to slide right into Tony’s body as if it were made only for him.
at least six times more before he slams his hand down on the override button and the sequence disappears. The restraints holding Steve in place spring free and he slumps forward, gasping.
Their midwife, Anita, is a kindly looking older woman with steady hands, and she gives him a knowing look that leaves embarrassment prickling on the back of his neck. He’s being ridiculous. Women give birth every day. An infinite number of parents raise happy, healthy children, but he’s scared.
Tony sighs, twirling a multitool over and over between his fingers. He doesn’t look up, because Peter’s a smart kid and he’ll probably see right through him if he does. Even though he’d never said anything, Tony was pretty sure that Peter was aware of his history with Steve.
Four years after The Snap and one year before Steve and his entourage show up at Pepper and Happy’s lake house, the letters start.
It isn’t the first time Tony’s forgotten about his enhanced hearing, and he stiffens when he hears Rhodes and Tony talking through the door. They’re just on the other side of the suite, through the closed connecting doors, getting ready in the living room that opens into a broad, elegant kitchenette.
It still felt wrong to hear it out loud. Forbidden. A secret he shouldn’t have shared with anyone. And yet he wanted it more now than he had anticipated, memories from decades ago flaring back to life.
Is that what he is? Powerless? Because in Tony’s arms he feels like he’s invincible and it’s never felt like this before. Tony sees something in him that Steve has never seen in himself and he hates that Tony’s decided to do this now, when he’s barely holding himself together.
With misery comes a distinct feeling of rage not dissimilar from the rage that had followed Steve for months after Bucky had fallen from the train. A rage that hollows away into that dangerous place inside himself and calls for retribution. A useless, pointless feeling because in seconds Tony has simultaneously taken everything that’s ever mattered to Steve and robbed him of his ability to get justice for the crime.
Steve makes his way down to the workshop slowly, savouring each step through the Tower. He lets his hand slide over the back of the oversized couch, rewarded with visions of Natasha and Clint piled onto Thor, all curled under a blanket with Bruce scribbling in a notebook at their feet. In his mind’s eye they’re all so young, finding meaning in place and family for the very first time.
“Ninety-eight this July!” Steve calls over his shoulder, darting across the gym. An arrow zips by his shoulder, the crackle of electricity at the tip buzzing in his ear as it goes.
Steve presses his forehead into the arc reactor again, rolling back and forth and there are tears landing on Tony’s belly now.
“Later.” Steve’s voice is pinched as he forces the word out. He presses his forehead into Tony’s chest with a shuddering breath. “We have to talk about this. Promise me. I can’t, not if we won’t–”
“Fuck,” Tony says eventually, sounding more coherent. He rubs Steve’s nose with his own and cups his cheek. “Fucking hell, Steve.”
Afterward, it’s too quiet and Tony focuses on the even paces of Steve’s breathing. They lay side by side like something out of a grotesque romantic comedy, sheets pulled up for a modicum of modesty that means nothing when you’ve been together as long as they have. That, and Tony’s told his own husband—ex-husband— he wished he had killed him. What need does he have for modesty now?
Steve catches sight of Tony across the battlefield, whooping with joy with Peter in his arms before Bucky comes barrelling towards him, rifle pointed at the ground. The metal arm slaps hard on his back as Bucky embraces him. Steve breathes for the first time in half a decade.
“Nah, he’d have told us. Plus, you remember last time? He’d be poppin’ his top if he was and gettin’ all squirrely on us.”
Tony had been thinking of Bruce when he’d designed it, painting one of the walls in a mural to the Redwood forests that Bruce was so fond of. He had pictured Bruce in here many times since Ultron, folded into crossed legs, eyes closed, head leaned back on the painted wall while he meditated. Sometimes Natasha was there too, collapsing in on herself in a complicated yoga pose.
Tony keeps his hands carefully curled on his knees, angles them away when Steve’s shifting movements have a wisp of his pant leg brushing against Tony’s. The last time he’d been this close to Steve, Tony’d fallen back to square one, a broken heart and a stomach full of bitterness, blackened around the edges with sorrow and grief.
mean aside from Iron Man needs to be the priority. Full stop. Even if the insignificant gooey jelly-bag inside is no longer, the team can still reap the benefits of all this firepower, right? It’ll be fine. Hopefully we’ll never have to use it.”
Steve doesn’t let him get anywhere near it, dipping and weaving through the battle. Aliens drop around him, but he knows what’s coming if he fails. He knocks Tony aside with the shield, and for a brief moment, he thinks Tony might blast him. The mask hides his expression, but Steve can hear him shouting inside the armour. He can practically see the ferocious flames in his eyes.
He wants to sink to the ground and beg Tony to believe him that he’s trying and he’s so goddamn sorry. He hadn’t meant for it to go on this long.
that you’re being an asshole and you’re going to ruin everything. Stop telling everyone how to live their lives. Stop goddamn pushing. If Barnes doesn’t want to go, don’t make him go. If Barnes doesn’t want to be an Avengers, he doesn’t need to be a fucking Avenger. You may be the Captain but you’re not God, Steve!”
They must lay there for a while, Steve losing himself in the warmth of Tony’s bed. He drifts long enough that the tips of his fingers start to tingle from the path they’ve been stroking up and down Tony’s flank.
“I don’t want to be like Howard. And if that’s who I am in your story now, that’s okay. I can figure out how to live with that. But you’re not Maria. If you were, we wouldn’t be here, would we?” A flicker of a smile crosses Steve’s face, half-hidden in the inconsistent light.
Tony’s limp body still feels heavy in his arms, even more unbearable under the weight of Peter’s disbelief as he staggers to his knees next to them. When Peter curls over them, his desperate pleas echo in the silence but Steve can’t think of a damn thing to say.
“It’s bullshit, Rhodey. Seriously. Sure, he says I’m sorry, but it’s just for not saying anything. Not about all the lying that went on leading up to everything, or what he did to our team, or to
“Tony,” Sam blurts in surprise as he comes through the doorway, announcing his arrival. It takes everything in him not to just turn on his heels and run. “Join us, we’ve got enough to feed an army.”
Steve’s eyes flutter closed and his mouth drops open into a soundless gasp as Tony swallows him back down to the root, holding him in his mouth and down into the entrance to his throat, swallowing hard. Two hands tease into his hair, careful with where the snap has damaged the right side of his face, and hold him still before starting to rock Tony back and forth along the length of his cock.
Tony looks away, resting a hand on the edge of the open coffin. The church has long since cleared out, and Sharon had given him a knowing little nod. Smoky incense curls around them, and Steve is at a loss for words.
“No,” Steve’s voice is soft and simple, and he shakes his head gently with the slightest shift in his eyebrows. He looks almost sympathetic as if he can see that Tony is uneasy, which must mean he just doesn’t care enough to listen.
Steve snorted, nose wrinkling in distaste as Clint’s familiar smell came to mind. “It never would have been Clint. He smells like papaya.”
The look Steve is giving him alone, guarded but openly hopeful, is enough to make his stomach rebel.
“Don’t be gross,” Clint throws the TV remote at him to bean him in the head, except he snatches it out of the air before it makes contact and hucks it back.
Steve was supposed to be here long before now. Damn the hospital and their incessant discharge protocols.
It’s a small weakness that Tony’s wearing them at all, but Steve had loved them—something about fashion in the forties and seeing a part of that on the person tying him to the future—and Tony loves Steve, regardless of whether or not he should.
Steve was all too happy to be the team guinea pig if it meant the majority of the people he found in the future would hang around just a little longer. Through fermented fish and eye-wateringly hot peppers, they found each other in food and comradery.
“Aw, he’s just playing around Stevie. Don’t get your panties in a twist. Speaking of which, Tony was just telling me about that pretty red number he got you last week.”
Steve grips him tight, keeping Tony close and near immobilized as if he’s just along for the red. He feels safe and secure, as if he’s flying even, kept afloat by the gasps that breeze alongside his shoulders and tickle the back of his neck.
“Fuck you, Barton.” Tony snapped, plucking the tablet off the table and shoving back, chair legs scraping against the floor.
Bucky was off like a shot, but Steve held back. Tony was smiling at him, genuine and open, washing away all the fears that Steve had sheltered over the last few months. He tilted his head askance, and Steve just shook his head, wrapping his arms around his waist and pulling him in.
Slowly, they figure out how to make a life for themselves. When it’s clear the world no longer needs the Avengers, thrust into an unofficial exile, Steve hangs up his suit and shoves the shield into the back of an unused closet. The Iron Man suits, all but one, stand like funeral monuments in Tony’s workshop in the basement of the Compound.
Steve sets a slow, teasing pace that the mood doesn’t call for, so Tony shoves his hips back and urges Steve to fuck him harder. When he doesn’t immediately comply Tony swears under his breath and kicks him again, this time in the side of the thigh.
“Every time, Tony. There’s not a moment that goes by where I don’t mean those things, over and over again. You have no idea how badly I wish I’d – how much I wish I had been able to tell you, before.”
“I have a lot of regrets about a lot of things,” Steve says slowly, choosing his words carefully. “But not this, Tony, never. It’s a shock, yes, but—but it’s amazing. I never thought… I never anticipated that you’d—”
There was absolutely no way that Steve could handle another Barnes-Barton prank war. If not for his sake, he wasn’t so sure that Tony’s heart could take it, either.
After, it was easy enough for Steve to drop back into the fantasy and lose himself in what it might be like to have Tony in his bed with him, sated and relaxed. Tony would be so warm with his legs tangled with Steve’s as they traded soft, loving kisses. The chill would be gone and Steve could spend the rest of his life in perfect contentment, at peace and fulfilled. They’d never leave the bedroom, if he had any say in the matter.
“And why, pray tell, would you do something like that for little ol’ me?” Tony asked, tone light and teasing as he stepped into Steve’s space.
Bucky segues the conversation into a story about his little sister, who Steve had apparently been fond of–and sweet on, depending on which of them you asked. Tony sits quietly, numb hand folded in his lap beneath the other, listening and forcing himself to be still.
“He’s not staying in Wakanda.” Tony’s anger wafted through in a fresh wave as Steve shot Bucky a helpless look. “Also, in the future, if you could let me know if I have an audience, I’d appreciate it. Just, please, tell me you’re not taking this call in bed. No, actually, don’t tell me, I don’t want to know. Gross–”
By the time Tony wakes up, he’s got quite the tan – and a bit of a sunburn on the back of his neck. He yawns, blinking his eyes open behind the sunglasses, and frowns when he sees Steve.
The punching bag swings back as Tony lands another hit against it, jarring his arm all the way up to his shoulder. He snarls, left arm cocked back, and hits it again. It has been a long time since he’s boxed, but today has been particularly stressful – hell, the past six months have been extremely stressful. Sweat trickles down his back, soaking into the black tank top he had thrown on with shaking hands, his designer suit lying crumpled in a heap in the locker room. Wrapping his knuckles with white tape had been easy enough, tugging on the boxing gloves with his teeth had been a struggle, but now he’s here – completely alone, able to throw as many punches as he wants.
They spend the rest of the morning and afternoon by the pool, Tony swims for hours, never ceasing even when Steve offers him lunch. His drawing of Tony is complete by the time he climbs out of the pool, and Tony glances at it as he passes by, rubbing a towel through his hair.
“I know the lie you tell yourself,” Tony replies, “And the lie you’ve told me. But you know the truth, Steve, so say it.”
Rhodey cautiously gets to his feet, grabbing at the edge of the table for support. He makes his way over to Tony, his hand grabbing at his shoulder, squeezing.
Natasha drives – aside from Happy, she is probably the only other person he would trust to get him someplace safely.
And then – Tony’s eyes will light up – an idea that just might work. He’ll lean forward again, not as hesitant, and press his lips to Steve’s. The kiss will be slow at first, though Tony might let out the faintest whimper as he brushes his fingers through Steve’s soft blonde hair. And then, he’ll be sitting on Steve’s lap, his arms wrapped around him, tongue in Steve’s mouth. Steve will melt into the kiss, remembering Tony’s last words to him.
Tony is joking, but there’s a solemnity in his expression – Steve wants to kiss him again, but slowly, and murmur into his skin that he’s in it for the long haul.
Tony is standing in the middle of Steve’s room in a pair of black briefs that seem too tight, too suggestive. He’s stood naked in front of Steve before, lain naked beside Steve, hell – Steve had seen every inch of his body. Kissed every inch of it.
The vitals monitor starts to ring warningly, and Steve looks at him with such desperation – like Tony is taking what hope he had left and crushing it beneath his foot.
“I made sure the pants were tight on purpose,” Tony admits, his arm wrapping around Steve’s waist. “I know how to accentuate my assets, as it were.”
Tony turns back to face him, grinning. “That’s right, I am. I expect you to say nothing but that for the next twenty four hours.”
“I saw the look on your face with the last swallow,” Tony leans forward in his seat, a plate placed in front of them, oysters glistening. “It’s a great vintage – but I drink wine firstly to get drunk, secondly for the taste. Since you aren’t going to get drunk, I won’t make you suffer. You ever have oysters before?”
Steve swallows, and he almost snaps at Tony, almost tells him how unfair it is to mention Peggy to him while they’re both naked in bed. It’s like a betrayal of her memory, but he knows that Tony won’t see it that way – because Tony had told him time and time again how happy Peggy had been while married to Daniel Sousa.
“I don’t know…” Tony sounds far away, his hands in his pockets. “I’ve just got a weird feeling, you know?”
Tony tenses in his arms, his hand grabbing at Steve’s wrist, ready to pull his hand away from him. Steve’s breath is hot at the base of his neck, his lips trailing over the bruises his teeth had left behind. “No. I don’t just come here for…” The admission makes him nauseous, because it’s too honest – too open. He doesn’t just come to Steve for sex – it has never just been for sex, as much as he tried to deny himself.
He tries to laugh, but Peter Parker is at his side in an instant, and for the love he bears the boy (as much as he tries to deny it) he does his best to keep his grip on reality.
“What are you planning?” Bucky stands in the doorway of his room that night, the soft orange light from Steve’s bedside lamp glints off of his arm.
Steve can hear him thinking again, can see the tension tightening the muscles in his shoulders. “Stop thinking,” he says, pressing down on the ice pack. “It’s not conducive to healing.”
“You’ll hear me fall if I’m not,” Rhodey replies with a wry grin, waving his hand. “Go on, go on. Give a shout if it’s something poisonous.”
Tony rests his forearm against the counter and buries his face against it with a melodramatic groan. “I should have gone to the hairdressers.”
“It’s to Vienna,” Tony says, getting to his feet. He’s gotten dressed, and Steve knows that it will take a lot of convincing to get him out of those shorts and back into bed. He turns to face Steve, his expression guarded. “Where’d you put my suit?”
“I have to take this,” Steve says breathlessly, apologetically, running his fingers through Tony’s damp hair. “Sorry.”
Steve tsks slightly, and Tony’s fingers curl against the stone – by what right is Steve judging him? Or did Steve think that he drank too much? Did Steve worry that Tony was an alcoholic?
Steve pauses, “I — In all honesty, no. He achieved what he set out to do. The Infinity Stones are gone — he destroyed them.”
The curved blade made out of his own suit plunges deeper, Thanos looking at him almost in pity as the end of the blade punches out of his back. Tony’s feet slip out from under him, but there’s a large hand in his hair, combing through dark curls, and really –
Tony’s hands grab at Steve’s wrist where it’s plunged beneath his briefs, fingers stroking over the juts of his wrist bones. He’s breathless and hot and feels incredible. Steve gently eases his soiled underwear down his thighs, fingers brushing along the insides of them, listening to Tony murmur his name.
Steve climbs out of bed and grabs his sweatpants off the floor from where he had abandoned them, holding the phone tightly with his free hand. “Stay on the phone, Tony, can you do that?”
“Tony?” Steve reaches up to touch at his own lips, still smarting from the burn of Tony’s goatee, the sting of his teeth. The door to the gym slams shut, Steve’s blood slowly trickling down the curve of his jaw and onto the mat below.
“Tony…” He whips his head over to the side, focusing his gaze on Stephen Strange, the man sounds incredibly morose – like Tony is dead already. “Tony, there was no other way.”
Pepper gives him a long, knowing look. “I know what you look like when you’re in love, Tony, in case you’ve forgotten.”
“Tony,” Steve hesitantly touches his chest – the arc reactor isn’t there. “Tony, did they – take -?”
“Steve… Seriously. I’m not marrying you. I’ve seen what marriage does to people. The only person I’ve ever known who has been truly, deeply, happily married was Peggy.”
“You can do the dishes,” Tony says with his last bite of food, hopping off the stool and walking back to the sitting room. “Seems only fair.”
Tony reaches up to press his fingers against the steri-strips pulled tight across his skin. He pulls his phone out of his pocket, the screen shattered at the base. The cursor blinks again, waiting for him to type out his thoughts and feelings to Steve Rogers.
“Are you telling me that you don’t want me to cook?” Tony laughs, and Steve rests his forehead against the door at the sound. “Believe me, Steve, my desire to poison you has lessened a tiny bit since yesterday. I’ll take a bite off of your plate before you eat so you can be sure of your safety.” He opens the door, taking half a step back when he sees that Steve is standing in the doorway. “Anyways. Ross is breathing down my neck,” he squeezes past Steve, doing his best to ignore the fluttering in his chest at the close contact. “I can’t afford to be seen eating dinner with a not-blonde but maybe-blonde if you squint muscular looking guy.”
Usually, he would shy away from something so bold out in public, but tonight, he leans against Steve’s side. He’s waited too long to play coy, and should someone want to take their picture, they would have to use a flash. Then, he would sic Steve on them and have him beat them senseless. A foolproof plan.
Steve looks down at the menu, a flush spreading up his neck, and Tony knows why he can’t meet his gaze. He gently knocks his foot against Steve’s again.
“Maybe Gamora didn’t die after all,” Tony suggests, and Steve squeezes his arm tighter. Sighing, Tony looks up at the crest of the mountain, squinting – this place is awfully foggy. He wants to ask FRIDAY to run an analysis on the atmosphere – but Steve is already snippy with him for getting distracted.
“That’s worse, that is much worse. I’ll just have to close my eyes while you use the kitchen scissors — just make sure you cut evenly.”
“Why?” Steve sounds so lost, even as Tony starts putting the vials into the other man’s pockets. Steve won’t know what to do with them, but maybe Bruce will – or Peter, if they get him back…
Tony’s expression is suddenly wistful. “I came here with my mom, when I was a boy. She’d get a coffee, I’d get a gelato… I used to love that aquarium – I’d spend ages in the shark tunnel.” He shakes his head slowly, “But I’ve grown up, and she’s not here. So, no, Cap. I won’t spend my forty fifth birthday at the aquarium. How about we just go for a walk? We can stop at the hotel so you can put your bag in our room. Thing probably weighs fifty pounds.”
“I love you,” Steve argues. Tony gives him the wounded look he’s taken to making in response to Steve saying that.
“Tony?” Steve turns the keys, motorcycle humming to life, but Tony is still slumped over. He grabs him by the collar of his thin t-shirt, pulling him back to rest against Steve’s chest. The way Tony’s body flops lifelessly against Steve terrifies him, and his trembling fingers press just under Tony’s jaw. There’s a pulse there – thready, weak, and arrhythmic, but there. Steve holds him as tightly as he can risk with Tony’s internal injuries, and speeds to the nearest hospital.
Tony shrugs his shoulders with such fluidity that Steve once again wonders how a man could be so tense and so relaxed all at once.
“Steve,” Tony climbs up on the stool beside him, and Steve takes a huge mouthful of pasta to hide his grin when he notices Tony’s feet dangling off the ground. “You come from a time where anything beyond stale bread was a luxury. I don’t begrudge you that, I’m just making sure you take baby steps.”
“I’m not going to eat a chocolate croissant naked,” Tony replies, his back still to Steve, though Steve’s jacket drops to the floor beside his feet – and then Tony’s shirt, and his trousers. “Crumbs will get everywhere. This is as far as I’ll go.”
Steve takes a seat in the armchair closest to him, his hands on his knees, looking at Tony intently.
Tony almost says yes. The word forms in his mouth, he can taste it on his tongue. If Steve turns himself in, Ross will get off of his back – his world will become a little less stressful.
Possessing the flip phone that now sits on the glass top of the desk is probably more than an inch out of line.
Tony scowls, putting the vial back into his pocket. “I’m not entirely excited to reach the top of the ominous misty mountain, Steve. Did Nebula even say what’s up there?”
“Tony?” Steve asks carefully, his hand shifting over Tony’s side. Tony tenses at the touch, exhaling sharply between gritted teeth.
“I left.” Tony shrugs. “I know you guys were keeping track of me – or at least, Pepper was.” Tony doesn’t look at him, he’s giving Steve an out, a way to deny any interest in Tony’s whereabouts for the last five years. “I made those big cash withdrawals because I didn’t want you guys knowing my every move like you would if I used a card. I floated around – never stayed in one place for longer than two weeks. A lot of the time I helped with rebuilding efforts. Infrastructure’s crumbling, you know? The manual labor was good for building up muscle, and nobody asked any questions when I finally dropped the self-confident, arrogant attitude I’ve been hiding behind since I was old enough to know better.”
“I don’t, but I’m still offended.” Tony has his hands clasped together, resting over his chest, and the comforter is thick enough that the light of his reactor is completely obscured. Steve has not seen him without it since he returned it to Tony in the hospital. Tony is tense, it radiates off of him, and Steve reaches out to poke Tony in the forearm. “Ow.”
The place Steve had chosen for them to stay surprises him – thus far, they had both chosen rather reserved locations. The only requirement had been a bedroom and a door that locks. This house looks vaguely similar to the Malibu mansion – definitely not as sprawling – but the house clings to the cliff-edge, and when Tony opens the door of his car, he can hear the ocean crashing against the rock below.
He exits out of the contact list, opening up the main menu and clicking on missed calls – assisted by the exclamation mark beside the icon.
“I love you,” Steve murmurs in the dark as Tony pulls the duvet up over them, slinging an arm over Steve’s chest.
“Uh, no, actually.” Steve shifts the newspaper between his hands, looking back at the print while Tony gets comfortable next to him. “Just reading up on the Series.”
Both Tony and Steve are unremarkably stuffed to the gills by the time their dessert arrives, chocolate cake with a raspberry sauce, and Tony sighs in torment as he picks up his fork.
As if in slow motion, Tony watched Bucky slide his head to the side and reveal his gland. Steve’s mouth sealed over it and everything went white.
“Tony—” Steve can’t take her. She’s so small and delicate, a dark flush red with a shock of brown hair on the crown of her head. She’d be even smaller cupped in Steve’s massive palms, and he can’t possibly hold something so fragile.
Tony lingers behind him, fingers slipping down the back of his neck to massage at his shoulders, and Steve relaxes into the touch. He drifts on the thoughts of how easy things have been. There were so many times they could’ve broken. Maybe at times they’ve bent but they’ve never snapped.
“What did I do?” Tony asks despite himself, voice cracking as shame rises up to stoke the ache in his chest into a sharp, piercing pressure. “What did I do that made you stop trusting me in the first place.”
Steve had looked back at him then, and Tony didn’t see pity or worry or guilt in his eyes. Captain America had shifted Bucky Barnes in his arms, helping the other man stay upright, and had looked at Tony with hatred in his eyes. The shield had clattered to the floor, a few feet away from Tony, and the two men had left him there to die.
“Oh, thank you, Dr. Rogers,” Tony simpers sardonically. “Whatever would I do without you? Not conducive to healing, fuck off. I have to think, because I’m the only Avenger who has the brains to navigate a fucking… treacherous political climate – but, oh, excuse me, I forgot. You don’t want to talk about it.”
“Look. I know five years is a long time, and just because I’ve managed to – you know…” He can’t bring himself to say ‘forgive you’, but Steve fills in the blank for him. “Doesn’t mean that you’ve not… uh… moved on.”
Tony tenses in his arms, pushing himself up off of Steve slightly. “You’ve got to be kidding me. Now?”
“I — I lost the kid,” Tony manages to hold back the sob that comes with those words, manages to stamp down the almost overwhelming grief that comes when he thinks of Peter Parker disappearing under his hand.
“I dyed it,” Steve admits with a grimace, looking up as a waiter appears at his side with a bottle of wine.
, with a note that read ‘Thinking of you.’ Tony had taken the roses with him when he had visited the grave of his mother that day – wanting to get them out of his sight.
Steve moves to stand beside the toilet, eyes wandering over the crooked, raised line on Tony’s abdomen. It had sheared through muscle, and Tony’s flesh had done its best to knit itself back together, but it was more than imperfect. Steve’s hand dangles at his side for a moment, and then his fingers stretch and touch the rough skin on Tony’s back. The blade had slid through him – through the entirety of him. Bruce had mentioned it briefly, but in the moment, Steve had been so focused on Thanos – on vengeance. It didn’t matter to him what state Tony was in – because he had lost Sam, Bucky – countless others. He had been unable to stop Thanos, and Tony had fought him – and Steve needed that intel before searching for the titan again. Steve does not look back on his behavior that day fondly.
Tony’s hand drops away, and he presses his face against Steve’s abdomen as he stands in front of him, his arms idly reaching up to wrap around Steve’s waist.
“Steve,” he says breathlessly, arching against him as Steve’s lips press to his throat again. “Steve, I’m not – I’m not using Neosporin as -.”
“I had a dream,” Steve admits, “A nightmare, I guess. I needed to hear your voice. Where are you now, Tony?”
Steve rests his chin on Tony’s shoulder. “I’ve had those since before I was in the ice – they’re a part of me. And now you’ve got them.”
“Dead,” Red Skull says, at his side in an instant, and Tony windmills his arms to keep himself from falling over the edge in shock.
“For sex,” Tony says flatly. “Is that not obvious? How do I get it through your thick skull, Steve? I come to you for sex, that’s all.”
“Not bad?” Steve takes the steps two at a time, his hands resting on Tony’s shoulders, squeezing. “It’s great! Feels brand new.”
Steve walks alongside Tony down by the port, his arm brushing against the other man’s gently, as much contact as Tony would allow them in public.
It is as isolated as Tony had feared – a stout, stony looking home. There’s a grey car parked in front of it, much less ostentatious than Tony’s rented red Jaguar, and there’s smoke pouring out of the chimney.
“Yeah, I’m finding it hard to get away, actually. I need a beach vacation,” Steve says dryly, watching as Tony picks up his left hand and starts to wrap it for him.
Tony looks up from the table when the bell above the door jingles, as he had been doing for the past fifteen minutes. His neck aches from the sudden jerk of his head up from the menu, but this time, he’s rewarded with the image of Steve’s bulking frame in the doorway. He still has that beard, though it’s thicker now, and Tony idly wonders how it would feel against the inside of his thigh. He reaches up, adjusting the knot of his striped blue tie at his throat, the silk comforting against his fingers.
There’s a car waiting for him at the front of the building, and Tony dips into his moderate grasp of German to request that the driver vacate the wheel. There’s some confusion, some bickering back and forth into a walkie-talkie, and Tony speeds off while his driver-slash-captor is standing with his back to him.
Tony jumps when the table he’s sat at is nudged forward, a fresh cappuccino and paper cup of gelato placed in front of him. He looks up in surprise, and Steve kisses him so quickly that it’s over before he can protest.
out of this. You’re here, and there’s nothing I can do about it – but you are not going to get involved. I’m going to – you’re going to stay safe, and then I’m going to take you back to Aunt May, and she’s going to ground the shit out of you.”
“Looks like you’ll have to improvise,” Tony’s voice is muffled against the fabric of Steve’s t-shirt. “You’ve got to be almost done, this is taking forever.”
Steve blinks, hands forming fists between his knees. “Right – yes, I absolutely want to see him.” He gets to his feet and staggers forward, the magazine slipping off of his lap and landing face down on the floor.
Steve carefully closes the newspaper and sets it on his nightstand, reaching out to turn off the lamp and plug in his cell phone to charge. “Can’t help it. You don’t even care about baseball.”
“I’d hate to break up the set,” Steve’s words drip with rage, disgust, disappointment. Tony's boyhood dreams of Captain America being proud of him die in some perverse, dark alleyway in the back of his mind - a painful death.
“I do hear you,” Steve insists, climbing out of bed. He wraps his arms around Tony’s waist, holding him close, the night’s cool breeze playing over his warm skin. “I hear you, Tony.” His lips press to Tony’s neck, feeling his pulse quicken at the touch. “You don’t want to get married. Okay, we won’t get married. But you don’t come here just for sex.”
“He had a bad night – this is the first time he’s slept since I got here. I think they had to give him something – he won’t… He thought he was on Titan for a bit – wouldn’t stop screaming.” Pepper sniffles slightly, rubbing at her eyes. “It was terrible.”
“It was the oysters,” Steve replies with a grin, watching Tony’s eyes widen. “You knew exactly what you were doing, don’t argue.”
“I hate children,” he had snapped at Steve months ago, mostly a lie – but now, as he stares at Peter Parker, he thinks that he may have been spilling an inner truth without even realizing it.
Pepper is pulled away by a nurse, and Tony doesn’t struggle much as a sedative is injected into his IV, though he’d really rather not be impaired – Pepper needs to know details, but not the nitty gritty. If he doesn’t tell someone the truth behind the night of December 16
“I’m sorry, Tony,” Steve murmurs, shaking his head. “I have to. I’ll be with you, I promise. I should call an ambulance.”
“I’m watching you, Stark,” Ross had threatened. “If I think you’re an inch out of line, I’ll throw you in a cell to rot.”
Gently, he tugs the blanket down Tony’s chest – Pepper makes a small noise of protest when Steve pulls Tony’s hospital gown gently by the collar. Steve reaches into his back pocket for the arc reactor, and places it over Tony’s chest, feeling the pull of the magnets beneath his skin.
“No,” Steve replies, his hand slipping away from Tony’s as they continue to walk. “Just that her sister disappeared here, and Thanos got the Stone.”
“Tony…” Steve stands in the doorway to the kitchen, looking at him – even with his back to Steve, Tony can feel his eyes on him. “Can I – uh – get you something to drink?”
“Just ice it for a minute, Tony,” Steve requests, grabbing his wrist as he sets his supplies down on the table beside his chair. He can feel the bones of Tony’s wrist shift in his grip, can feel his pulse, strong and swift.
“Fine.” Tony can’t believe the word comes out of his mouth, and hope is growing in his chest again, no matter how many times he plucks it out. “Fine. But I’m not – I…”
“Ours,” Tony corrects. “For this, obviously.” He gestures between them. “But we better not meet here next, I want to keep them guessing."
“I’ll be right back,” Steve says, twisting the throttle, the engine roaring at his touch – maybe Tony had improved the bike…
“They took my shield,” Steve says casually, following after Tony as he sets off down the hall. “I’d like it back.”
“I did,” Steve says through the door as Tony shuts it between them. “I got some bits and pieces, though, nothing major… I thought we’d go out to eat.”
“You know, Steve,” Tony says as he opens the door to the hotel for them, the lobby quiet. “Something’s up.”
He’ll pull back, resting on his haunches, cheeks flushed. Steve will do his best not to stare at Tony’s lips, just as soft as before, just as perfectly shaped. Tony will reach out and rest his hand against Steve’s deadened right arm.
“You’re still bleeding,” Tony pulls his hand away once Steve’s finished, staggering to his feet. “What about that enhanced healing factor?” He’s back at the drawer of medical supplies, pulling out rubbing alcohol and a pad of gauze.
He catches a woman as she falls in front of him, the phone clattering against the concrete. Tony helps her upright, but she pushes him aside the moment she’s back on her feet.
“Oh, he’s great,” Tony is still smiling, and Steve never wants that smile to leave him. “I’ve sort of – taken him under my wing – as my protégé? You know, like Batman and Robin. He’s sorta my Robin. Brilliant kid. Smarter than me.”
The intern checks his watch, staring at it for a long moment – Tony leans over his wrist, glancing down at the watch-face.
Tony frowns at him, picking up a pillow from where it had fallen off of the foot of the bed, and chucking it at Steve’s head.
He laughs wildly, admiring Steve’s form in the darkness, and then groans as Steve rests his full weight against him.
There is no other explanation for the weight there, it’s almost like the entire globe is resting between his lungs, pushing down on him. He tries to lift his hand to touch his chest, but his arm is heavy too – which makes sense, because as a dead person, he really shouldn’t be able to move at all.
But when he had thought about it… he’d allow himself only the briefest moment. Quick, self-indulgent fantasies in the shower when everything had still been raw and painful, only a few times in their early days back at the Compound. It had been cathartic, he’d told himself, healing the aching parts of him torn open after he’d broken his partner’s heart, and found only a shell of his old friend and lover.
“Hey, hey what is it?” Tony scrambles forward, concerned, but Steve just tugs him into his arms. He can still see him that very first time Tony kissed him, when he tasted like Mediterranean spices and hot sauce and sweet, delectable honey. When things were new and fresh but practically nothing in the face of all they’ve built together.
Tony’s fingers pause inside him as he reaches down to jerk him off, hard and fast. It’s no use begging this time, Tony’s already compiled all the data and he knows exactly what this body can handle. With the orgasm hovering just beyond his grasp, Steve slumps forward as Tony brings him right to the edge and lets go of his cock, keeping him trapped against the couch.
FRIDAY had greeted him moments before with a moderate tone of resentment, and Steve assumed he deserved that much. Tony had every right to still be angry and FRIDAY, by extension, was entitled to her anger as well. The familiar reminder that,
“I told him that I knew what he had done and that he should be ashamed of himself and that he’s lucky you’re even alive after Siberia, so he better stay away.”
Peter holds a grudge almost as tightly as Tony himself. Not quite what he had been thinking when he’d used the word protégé.
He gets a flash of short, manicured nails sliding across the hair of his scalp, head pillowed on her shoulder after a particularly difficult day. The whisper of her pet name for him once.
Steve flushes, licking his lips as another bolt of arousal rushes south. His cock twitches in Tony’s grip, and Tony waggles his eyebrows at him, sucking him back down and pointedly pushing Steve’s hand down on his hair.
He learns that Tony can create masterful stories off the top of his head that keep Morgan’s attention for hours. He learns that Tony can design safety items far better than anything on the market, and that Tony becomes so in tune with Morgan he can predict a tantrum before it happens. The fear of becoming his father disintegrates with time, and Tony softens, becoming the gentle, guiding hand that she flourishes under with more love than any child would ever need.
more time. You don’t get a lot of chances at make up sex like this, Steve, we’ve got to take it when we can get it.” Steve chuckles a little laugh into his mouth. “And for the love of Thor, don’t leave any more marks on me. I’m not going to be able to hide any of this.”
“Don’t snarl at me, asshole. I couldn’t care less what you think you feel. You destroyed the bond the day you picked him over me.” Tony’s words landed like acid, corroding Steve’s face into something grim and twisted.
Tony’s never thought about it that way, the utter disrespect of Steve barging his way in all those years ago a familiar memory. But a nail in the coffin? A behaviour Tony had come to expect from Steve, that hadn’t surprised him in the slightest. Maybe it should have and a swell of pity and nausea rises in his stomach when he thinks about the Tony Stark he was all those years ago. A thing to be walked over.
It doesn’t matter what Steve is doing today, Tony decides. It’s not Tony’s problem and it hasn’t been for weeks. Today is just like any other day even if the melancholia is lingering in the corners of his mind.
“We’re going to figure this out, Steve. I promise. I have some new ideas for B.A.R.F., and who knows what Shuri could do for him. She’s got a phenomenal mind. We’ll figure this out.”
Tony sighs, dropping back into the chair across from him. He shoots Steve a lopsided grin with only a touch of self-deprecation, and Steve will take it. “When’d you get so smart, huh?”
“Get him ready for you, Bucky,” Steve, always quick to whisper orders framed as suggestions, told the brunet as he knelt at Tony’s side, pulling back one of his thighs. A whisper of a gasp escaped as Steve held him open wide, giving Bucky perfect access to his hole and making him shudder.
“It’ll be nice to work with you, Peter,” Steve offers, and Peter doesn’t reply, just nods his head sharply before his eyes flick over Bucky, standing not too far behind Steve.
The muscles in Tony’s back shifted and bunched as Steve urged his body into his lap, lifting Tony effortlessly across his thighs to wrap an arm around his belly. With his face still turned against the pillows, Steve could watch as Tony’s eyelids fluttered again while he slid his palm over the length of Tony’s erection. It wept over his fingers, already a mouth-watering shade of red and begging to be touched.
The light from the arc reactor feels too bright, lighting up all the new lines Tony traces in Steve’s face. The divots that have formed and remained along the expanse of his forehead, pinched between his eyebrows. Such a serious, intent focus.
Tony slides down and kneels between his thighs where Steve spreads his legs a little wider, relishing the masterpiece that is Tony Stark curved over his cock, lips shiny with spit and fingers glistening with lube.
FRIDAY advises him that the team is gathered together in the common space, debating over what to order for dinner, with only Lang and Rogers absent.
“Talk to me, Steve, tell me what you’re feeling.” Tony bites down on his shoulder before he turns his head and presses his nose into the curve of Steve’s neck.
“No, just stop. Just—Steve, seriously. Let’s just pretend this didn’t happen and go on our way until we have to see each other again. Why draw this out? What could this possibly be doing for you?”
Steve is immobilized in the automatic restraints keeping him secured to the armchair, the visor over his eyes hiding his face. There’s a distorted grimace smeared across his face, his jaw clenched tight, and his hands are shaking where they grip the arms of the chair. If Steve had truly wanted to, he could have been out of his seat in a flash. The restraints weren’t meant for anything more than a gentle reminder not to move and jostle the visor when the participant was immersed in the display.
The question hangs heavy between them, unspoken. Tony almost asks, he really does, with his mouth opening and closing helplessly. There’s a lot he could say. Is this the time to be saying things?
Tony’s expression softens when Steve reaches under the pillow and reveals the velvet ring box. It pops open, and Tony reaches out for the silver ring despite himself.
