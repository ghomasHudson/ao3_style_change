‘Nat, what’s wrong?’ he asks, seeing the tense set of her eyes and the determination in her stance.
Bucky is more aware of the person walking next to him than he is of where Hulk might be. And considering one is walking almost silently, and the other is a giant making more noise than Tony and Peter left unsupervised in the lab, that’s quite impressive.
‘Please tell me you’re joking,’ Scott’s eyes are wide.
‘Wait you speak Groot?’ the rabbit asks.
‘Don’t you start going paranoid on me, Pool, or I swear you won’t be able to talk for webbing for a year,’ he growls.
‘And that’s all?’ Rhodes asks from next to him.
‘I promise I won’t tell anyone, especially Tony,’ she rolls her eyes, then grins, ‘or Bucky.’
‘Are he and Captain Rogers in a relationship?’ Vision asks, sending Wanda into fits of laughter.
‘You cannot just walk in here and demand to see my patients!’ Doctor Blane is shouting as they approach Bucky’s door.
Peter decides it’d be more suspicious to argue so just does as he’s told, feeling slightly uneasy as Mr Nelson closes the door behind him.
The older man laughs. ‘This is what he usually gets like in the few days before.’
Steve grabs Tony and pushes them both down to the floor between the two rows of chairs, half-covering him with his own body.
‘She stayed to await my return with the stone,’ he cackles, ‘we did not think it would need more than three children to collect them. Clearly we were mistaken. And now Proxima will return to warn Thanos of your strength, and nothing you can do will stop him.’
‘Don’t let him get under your skin,’ Bucky advises as he leaves him alone.
to do something?’ Tony asks quietly.
‘I’m still impressed that Tony thought to put an attic in this place,’ the man’s voice drifts down.
‘I’m the sensible one who teaches him some rules
anything-’
‘I never did before the spider bite,’ Peter replies, voice gaining confidence, ‘so I couldn’t suddenly start and be awesome at it. Not when I’m supposed to be a nerdy kid that can’t stick up for himself.’
‘The law firm from the gala,’ he explains, ‘Nelson and Murdock. They might help you out, and no one would expect you to use a small law firm like that; if they had the odd bit of support from the law team at Stark Industries, then it could be a good option.’
‘Hey Doc!’ Peter waves from the sofa, Strange gives a smile and wave back just as Loki enters, his arms full of materials and Rhodes coming in behind him.
I hope you enjoyed this chapter. I thought it was only a matter of time until Tony and Peter had a bit of a rocky moment in their father/son relationship. Poor Tony probably won't have any hair left soon!
‘Complete with flashing warning lights and sirens,’ Valkyrie sighs. ‘You guys just couldn’t play nicely could you?’
‘Thank you, Mr Parker,’ the guard hands his pass back to him and winces. ‘Would you mind not letting Mr Wilson know? I’d rather not-’
‘We’re careful. He says he doesn’t want to ruin the goody-goody image,’ he knows his voice has gone a little sour but he can’t help it. The more he’s got to know Deadpool the more he wonders if the guy is actually as bad as people have made him out to be.
‘You wiped the security footage?’ Bucky checks.
‘Have you been successful?’ he asks as Valkyrie takes the seat next to him at the bar.
With the death of Thanos’ last lieutenant at the hands of his brother, the rest of the army does not stop fighting, but it certainly becomes less co-ordinated. Loki strides across the battlefield towards the blond, letting his Asgardian visage slip into place, though not removing the crown from his head.
“Would you believe me if I told you that no one has ever asked me that question before?”
“Okay but,” Steve clears his throat, Tony’s arm still around him is distracting to say the least. It’s mere friendly contact. Only, it’s
“Just hearing your voice is enough,” Steve charms, “you know what they say about too much of a good thing.”
“What do you want, Tony,” Steve finally says, consciously wrapping his arms around himself, looking rather naked in nothing but a pair of boxers.
and finish off the night with Pizaa Hu-”.
It takes a moment of Pepper just staring at Hogan’s discomfort with the situation before she moves towards him. Once close enough, she wraps her arms around his shoulders.
“Well I’m sorry Rhodey, but I think I should have a say in who my husband is gonna be,” Tony grins.
At the last red light before his street, he finds his mind drifting once again. Maybe there is a reason he can’t get passed all of this. Maybe there is a reason he can’t stop thinking about Steve and the kiss. There has to be a reason why it hurts so much, those few times that Steve had looked at him over the past few days and he’d seen nothing but ice in those usually fiery blue eyes.
And Steve’s wondering if Tony is slipping back into Stark mode as they ride up the elevator, because his boss is suddenly quiet and passive when he himself is itching to wrap his arms around the dark haired man again.
It should be hilarious, and not just because Mr. Tony Stark of Stark Industries actually has Marvin Gaye’s album warm and ready on his hotel room stereo. It should be hilarious because not only does he have it, but he is also dancing to it. Steve should be in tears, itching for his phone to tell his best friend that Tony-fucking-Stark is lip-syncing and dancing along to what could easily be declared the most derivative song to use during foreplay. But the humor of it all is completely lost due to the explicit fact that the way Tony is moving his hips is hypnotically arousing.
At that moment, he wishes it would momentarily malfunction, because he’s suddenly far too anxious.
“Could you be a darling and upgrade the entire floor’s PCs with the new software?”  Stark says, sliding into a black Armani jacket that compliments his tailored waistcoat and does nothing to hide how perfectly the dress pants incase his thighs. Thighs that were wrapped around his waist for most of the weekend, Steve scolds himself for recalling. “And each tower needs to be individually encrypted and licensed with the twenty digit cryptogram that you’ll find I’ve so generously slipped into the back of the book for you,” Tony looks as though he deserves praise before adding, “- typed in teeny tiny, itty bitty font. It was far too complicated for me; pretty sure you’ll definitely have to read the manual.”
Stan doesn’t bother arguing with the man. He goes back to his table, sits back and folds his arms as Howard bitterly shoves the photographs back into the envelope they came in.
“Can you look down, Tony,” the photographer shouts, “just with your eyes, not your head?”
Tony couldn’t have withheld the next moan, writhing beneath the larger boy when the pleasure escalates just a tad more than he’d expected.
Steve is half way down the corridor when his stride stills suddenly. An eerie sensation floods his gut as he strains his ears to verify that what he’s hearing is correct, but he still makes no move to get closer to the source.
Sharon closes his portfolio and studies him from across the table. She can see his face plastered on the cover of a magazine already. She can picture fans screaming Steve’s name. She can see him telling his pitiful life story on the Oprah Winfrey show. The smell of money is so strong it makes her mouth water.
Brock sits up, his feet firmly on the floor as he runs a tired hand over his unshaven jaw.
“Don’t think too hard,” she crosses her arms, “makes you look stupid. I lost my job because of your little stunt so that makes me almost as pitiful as you.”
The limo slows and Steve’s heart begins to thump uncontrollably. He regrets not training his eyes out the tinted windows because they’re suddenly surrounded by scores of fans. The uncontrollable crowd is screaming and jumping, holding up signs and dying to cross the belly high fencing that’s blocking them. The men in uniform are possibly the only things keeping them from leaping over the simple obstacle between them and their idols.
“Fuck the script,” Tony chuckles, moving away from tasting Steve’s flesh long enough to look him in the eye.
He looks over at Tony.
Tony nods with a polite smile and then doesn’t really care if he’s being too forward when he pushes, “about his father, Ms. Wanda?”
“Yeah I know,” Tony agrees with his back towards Steve, pouring a fresh pot of coffee into a mug. One of the promotional mugs that Lee keeps on his shelf. It’s a beautiful black mug with Tony Stark’ name and face on it. “Like these rich kids on television have nothing better to do with themselves other than party and screw each other.”
Feverishly, Tony lets his body get taken over by the insanely new sensation.
only in it for the money. I wasn’t kidding when I said I don’t give a shit about the fame though. But, that doesn’t matter because I got what I wanted. Without having to go through all the stupid song and dance.”
Steve tries hard not to look over his boss’s shoulder, because Bucky is hanging himself with an imaginary noose in the next cubicle.
“Two more seconds,” Tony mumbles.
He too is dressed in all black and also has tattoos. But the sleeves that the tank top lacks offers a full view of all the intricate ink stokes sliding and swirling down each ripple of muscle from shoulders to wrists, veins jutting out on his forearms. And he’s wearing biker jeans; the vintage-looking, distressed denim is faded in all the right places and ripped without seeming ruined. Even the boots don’t make him appear as though he’s overcompensating for anything, but perhaps it’s because Steve personally knows this guy doesn’t have to.
*****
“Steve can join us.”
As far as Tony is concerned, he’d received enough apologies to last him a lifetime within such a short span of time.
Hogan raises a brow when Pepper stands. Her imaginary dance partner mustbe quite a charmer because she certainly looks like she’s enjoying herself as she sings softly along with Mr. Rogers.
“You know what?” Tony says, making his way through the lobby, “I think I’m gonna head out. I found what I was looking for.”
Pepper doesn’t waste time walking to her room. She doesn’t even wait to see him make out the couch. But she does turn to him just before shutting her bedroom door.
“Okay,” Tony finally speaks after a particularly long and uncomfortable silence. “No party, I swear. We can just hang out. We can try that, right? I’ll even tell my driver to take the night off and we’ll take a cab and get some cheap beer and greasy questionable burgers and just…hang.”
“That isn’t what I meant,” Tony defends himself in vain.
There is clearly no luck of that this time around.
When all that the man does is - so very helpfully - point Steve in the general direction of the pub with the tiniest tilt of his head, Steve feels stupid once noticing that half the patrons fit his description. Including the band.
“Is this a bad time?” Bucky asks and Steve can’t help but roll his eyes this time.
“Perhaps there’s a reason I don’t,” Hogan quips bitterly, “have you thought about that?”
She knows he won’t understand, not now. He won’t see peoples’ efforts to protect him. Not her efforts or her husband’s. All he can see is the people who are supposed to love him, ripping him of the little

“My God, “she gives him a pitiful smile as she shakes her head. “You have a lot to learn.”
“They’ve been rumors that your hit show,
joy he had to satisfy themselves.
He looks down at the youngest Stark.
“Your mother’s in television?”
“My dad started it,” Tony says casually, “but it’s mine now. I’m kinda sick and tired of being Robert Downey Jr. I mean, the show was great, the people were great but it’s over now. And you know what, everyone is expecting me to take on another role as the high school heart throb with good hair and a bad attitude, but I’m not gonna do that.”
“Are you kidding me,” Tony lays back down with his hands behind his head, “You were a few seconds away from needing an exorcism.”
He wants answers, that much is obvious. He expects excuses, and could care less about what they might be. He can’t envision an apology, at least not a sincere one.
“That’s enough Lee,” Hogan says, placing a hand between his client and the overly passionate producer to act as a barricade.
As the reporter announces that they’re going to crossover to viewers take on the revelation, Steve finds himself completely absorbed by what the outcome will be.
Tony isn’t sure what he wants from Steve. If he wants them to talk about what happened or just hopes they’ll just pretend it never happened. He tries to convince himself that it was nothing. It was a moment that got out of hand due to the initial kiss which was only brought on in the first place due to a line in the script. It would never have happened any other way, not without the script.
Because the second Mr. Stark walked into the building that morning, everything suddenly became far too real.
“Oh,” Stark looks around himself, putting on a bewildered front, “because I was just talking about how we’re going to be able to push our revenue incalculably, I always find that thoroughly amusing.”
And then he thinkst about how every single thing over the past few months has been completely unexpected. From getting the role in the movie, to embarrassing himself in front of Tony when they first met. From their first kiss in front of the world to Tony showing up at his door admitting his feelings. Their heated nights together and the initial bust of the affair. Every single moment had been a rush.
“I’m sorry, that was terrible,” the boy says nervously, “Can I try again?”
“He was with me,” Pepper admits.
Hogan thinks with a slight shake of his head. Anyone watching the two can easily tell that Peggy is far past mesmerized by Tony and is doing next to nothing to hide it.
One would easily believe that this is their joined debut and not the premiere of
“You were called too, huh,” Pepper grins at a very groggy looking Hogan.
Although the boy had looked close to tears seconds before, the few words from Tony instantly brightened his mood. So much, in fact, that he nearly loses his step on the way out of the audition room.
Steve raises a confused brow when he hears the boy on the bed laughing lazily.
doing is leaving you. I don’t care what the hell you say.”
,” Tony smiles genuinely, “Lee can’t stop talking about you. So, what do you think about the script?”
Steve decides that he likes the unexpected since it’s what’s expected when being with Tony Stark.
Tony’s face is also noticeably smoother, eyebrows darker and lips glossy. Or are they just wet? It doesn’t matter. Not when the white vest he’s wearing is clinging to his chest and the undoubtedly brand new dark jeans hang low around his waist. They are definitely brand new, Steve can practically smell that new store smell.
, Lee concludes in his head. His blood instantly boils at the thought, betrayal at its finest.
“I have nothing to say to you, Tony.”
“You say that as is if you actually know how to laugh yourself,” Pepper quips.
“Come on,” he smiles, grabbing Steve’s hand and leading him out of Hogan’s kitchen.
Pepper will butter it up too much and leave the boy hopeful. Hogan will find some way of making it seem like its Tony’s fault. Howard, Stan thinks, the man will downright just rip the poor boy apart.
“You ready?” Jarvis asks, pretending not to listen to the conversation.
His next door neighbor pauses briefly before sighing. “And here I thought the call was for me.”
Landing a role in a Marvel Production was also a major surprise for Steve. He’d known about Marvel for years, the company’s ratings higher than any other in the film industry. It was still a surreal feeling that he’d rubbed shoulders with the best of the best, even though he was sure that was all going to be behind him now.
Only, it’s different this time.
She can’t risk letting him know.
How can they when they’re seconds away from seeing Tony Stark, in the flesh.
And Steve officially has no idea what to believe anymore, the cheesiness of Stark’s choice of words suddenly conflicting horribly with the sincerity in the man’s eyes. The shaky pleas as he reassures Steve that he’s ready. The way he accidently moans Steve’s real name through the initial stretch of Steve’s throbbing cock inside him.
“Anyway, why are you here?” Pepper continues when Hogan doesn’t speak. “Do you have any idea what time it is?”
Tony shrugged his shirt on.
This time it’s Tony who moans and as he feels his jeans tighten, he can’t remember to give a shit about what they’re doing. Or the fact that it’s Steve he’s doing it with. Though lust is fogging most of his judgment, he realizes he has never felt so instantly and insanely aroused in his life.
“Send Mom my love,” Tony says, and then scoffs after a moment, “I’d like to think you do. You’ve got an odd way of showing it.
“Could you maybe give me a minute,” Tony tries on a smile.
“Yes, Sir,” Steve allows unnecessarily and Stark does so, not before giving Steve one last look as if to thoroughly make certain that he has the go ahead.
Steve is having a hell of a hard time holding Tony’s gaze, but still refuses to look away.
Tony can’t help but laugh at the completely perplexed look on Steve’s face.
“That is thoroughly amusing, Sir,” Steve nods keenly.
Even though Howards has said he knows, playing dumb seems to be a safe way out.
door.
“Company, that’s all,” Steve shuts the door after Tony. “I swear I’ll call you back. Later.”
“Yes ma’am,” Tony nods politely.
It’s on the outskirts of town preceding a highway to the next. From the looks of it, Steve can picture the front of the place lined with parked Harley’s on a busy night, but he’s thoroughly grateful that this is not one of those times. In fact, were it not for the lights turned on in the motel rooms above and the handful of stationery vehicles scattered in the lot, Steve guesses that the only things keeping business up and running are the tiny Stop n Go gas station and the ATM machines; small stop necessities for out of towners passing through.
Steve places his hands on his hips as Tony laughs it off.
In reality, Mr. Stark was no longer Neil Patrick Harris, the desperate, horny mix of submission and domination, a switch he’d been able to switch far too expertly at whim. The man who walked in was Steve’s boss, hardened face in scary Armani from head to toe. Eyes empty and posture reeking of infinite power.
The two are let in by one of the maids who has undoubtedly already received instructions to lead them to the second floor study.
Tony’s eyes dart to the front row, to the exact seat. The same place he’s been paying so much attention to all night. He’s sure he isn’t the only one who’s noticed.
Tony being his only concern.
“Tony, please?” the same man with the headphones from earlier urges Tony to keep following him. “Peggy is seconds away from announcing you.”
; I didn’t mean to insult you like that. I’m sorry.”
“Because the movie was beautiful,” Tony shrugs, “weren’t you watching?”
“Honestly,” Steve says thoughtfully, “I can’t begin to tell you how lucky I feel. I mean, I thought my agent was gonna have me doing modeling bits forever. Then she spoke about this senseless teenage show, and I mean, I was grateful for her major effort, don’t get me wrong. I just, always thought if I get into the business I’d do something meaningful. You know?”
. “I said that thing about
Hogan’s eyes shot to Howard’s, the two staring each other down with equal determination.
Steve wishes it had been harder.
“I’ll be in the lounge if you need me.” Steve places a kiss on Tony’s lips. A kiss that Tony threatens to deepen had he not pulled away on time.
“So,” Steve closes the distance between their bodies entirely, resting his head on Tony’s shoulder while nipping his neck. “I wanna go to bed now.”
“He would’ve done it regardless, Hogan. You know that.” Pepper calms slightly before continuing. “Besides, I’ve done nothing for that boy other than what I’m paid to do.”
Steve feels Tony’s thighs close around him, pinning his hips, making Steve’s resolve slip further as Tony kisses a hot trail from his shoulder to his chest.
Steve finds himself completely unprepared for this situation as Ms. Wanda parks the car in their driveway-
Steve’s hands are skillful, dominant and completely overwhelming.
Bucky freezes as the elevator comes to a fitting halt and his mouth parts like the doors. Although Steve is well aware of his friend’s stunned gaze fixed on him the entire time, he’s grateful that the new loud company will be joining them for the rest of the ride down to the foyer. But his crowded peace is fleeting and the moment they exit, the second the tirade of accusations - more so than questioning - begins.
“No you don’t,” Hill quips, “You get to sit in and watch if you promise to blend in with the chairs.”
Tony waves a dismissive hand, immediately feeling uncomfortable by the way that Steve’s in awe with him and what he owns. Steve has been like this from the second the trip began.
“Where are you?” Hogan asks quietly, obviously aware that she’s far too deep in thought.
“Like hell you are,” Howard stands abruptly and his wife follows suit.
“I probably never will,” Tony says, a thoughtful frown creasing his brow.
“Depends what you’re looking for,” Brock shrugs unnecessarily, his voice thick with innuendo.
*****
Steve smiles as he hears Ms. Wanda laugh. It’s a tender high pitched laugh that makes her face brighten up entirely. He can picture her clearly in her hideous floral apron and pink slippers. Her white hair is probably bunched up in a bun that looks years from untangling and her freckled, wrinkly cheeks are surely just as oddly rosy as usual.
A deep sigh escapes Tony as his eyes flutter open. Instinctively, Steve puts distance between them, only to be pulled right back.
“Stop!” Pepper snaps, shoving Tony’s foot out of her lap. “Don’t spoil it; I want to read it for myself.”
and a tip.
“I’m falling for you too, Steve,” Tony interrupts.
Steve had told Tony he was falling for him. That he liked him. That he wanted to be with him. Not in so many words, but it was known, by both boys. Steve had feelings for Tony.
“I thought
From the first surprise he got mere months ago.
He’d made a promise to Howard, but he’s already prepared to break it.
Hogan pulls out one of the chairs for Pepper before sitting down beside her. Silence drags on for a moment before Hogan decides it’s gone on for long enough.
Even now as he sits in the boardroom and Bucky taps his thigh under the table, showing Steve a caricature of Mr. Stark being mauled by lions, all Steve can do is glare at his friend before returning his attention back to the boss. Because Tony has been looking directly at everyone but him and Tony has asked the room for suggestions only to deliberately talk over Steve when he is the only one willing to offer one and then Tony adjourns the meeting having discussed every point on the itinerary apart from the very valid one Steve had wanted to bring to attention regarding his department.
Tony grins a little too quickly in her opinion. Or maybe it’s just her over analyzing things. She isn’t sure.
Sharon lifts a brow, thoroughly loving the man standing in front of her at that moment. He’s completely rugged and smells questionable, but she’s prepared to marry his mind.
*****
There was no question in Pepper’s tone and all three men seem to know better than to argue with her.
,” Tony adds, “pure bullshit.”
“However, I think I can manage to get away with a tiny spoiler,” Tony announces, regaining his childhood ease. “It’s a true life love story. It’s called,
“Please,” she gives him her hand, “call me Sharon.”
Tony grins at Steve, finding amusement in the situation. It all feels so complete.
“Was it a manhunt?” Tony smirks.
“I think you’ve got more than me,” he says, picking one up and then flipping it over to read the back.
“My dad,” Steve begins, “he’s, like, this extreme biker type. Used to play in two rock bands, blazed green, has fierce tattoos. He wanted to name me Harley, for God’s sake.”
Steve forces his eyes open, not seeing much at all. He lets out a sharp breath when Tony rolls his hips a little too skillfully for him to ever claim he can’t dance. Then Steve realizes, as Tony’s teeth sink into his shoulder, there is no way he will be able to get a word in if he lets this continue.
Tony’s never been so grateful that he’s a brilliant actor before; otherwise everyone would see just how much it all really hurt.
“Bucky?” Steve stands abruptly. “You’ve been speaking to him?”
Tony muses at the beauty as he rubs Steve’s shaky thighs. He only wishes it was his hand that could be held accountable for bringing Steve over the edge, but he knows there’s always next time. He knows there’ll be many more next times.
“Jesus,” Tony half chuckles, half groans when Steve rubs a little harder against him, teeth fascinating tighter. But smartly, not hard enough to leave a mark. “I thought it was only woman who get frisky after a little wine.”
“That’s true, Tony,” Peggy encourages, “and soon people will be saying,
“I was angry, Steve. I was so mad at you,” Tony gives a short nervous chuckle. “But when I found out everything … when I found out why you did what you did, I got even angrier.”
“Mr. Stark?” Steve stammers out, barely believing the realization himself. More so when a complete look of confusion crosses the man in question’s face.
But something else intervenes. Something large gets in the way and it takes Tony a second to realize that it’s Hogan.
Steve only half takes into consideration that Tony is on his side of the bed as he crawls under the covers.
“Well then, what did you mean?” Tony retorts.
“Nope,” is all the response Steve gets. And he would’ve made some silly joke by feigning shock over the fact that the other man can actually speak had his request not so rudely just been shut down.
Tony wants to offer her a smile, but he doesn’t. He knows it will shake.
“Ready,” Tony confirms. He grips the bar tightly, pushing just enough to unhook the barbell, before lowering it down to his chest. Tony lets out a strained breath as he pushes the weight up, fully convinced that Jarvis is doing next to nothing to assist him.
Steve wants to open his mouth, defend himself. At least say something.
“I’ve got a feeling you’re gonna tell me,” Tony rolls his eyes.
“Oh don’t give me
“Where is he by the way?” Clint asks. The man is so rapt in the moment that he doesn’t notice Tony’s expression waver.
He skims his hands over Steve’s muscled torso and then his strong back, trying to move calmly as Steve grinds his hips against him.
“Thanks Tony,” the cameraman smiles, returning Tony’s thumbs up.
“He’s just not
That afternoon, it was decided by both boys a nap was necessary. Especially after long road trips and emotional visits.
Tony ceases what he’s doing; looking down at the spot his lips have last touched as if memorizing the location he has to pick up from.
The guitarist gives Tony an unmistakably knowing grin as he keeps playing the acoustic version of a Coldplay song that Steve knows, but can’t pin.
He nods, sitting in the seat across from hers as she fully opens the blinds, spreading light into the once dark office.
The gym is partially empty just as Tony likes it. It’s probably the very reason he chooses Friday nights to do his main workout of the week.
“Oh forgive me,” Steve says, sarcasm dripping in his tone. “Forgive me for not knowing that Tony Stark likes kissing boys, just not the gay ones.”
It did, indeed, feel like the end to him.
Tony sighs, a hint of relief in its texture. He pulls the case away from Steve who hadn’t even realized he was clutching it with white knuckles, fingernails denting plastic.
Tony’s only slightly annoyed by Ms. Wanda’s inability to stick to one topic at a time. There’s something far too sweet about her for him to get completely irritated.
“Last night,” Steve’s eyes snap to Tony’s for the first time since sitting. Tony’s pleased and so he continues. “You left me last night.”
“Do you know what’s really working my last nerve?” Howard asks, eyes cast down at the magazine splayed out in front of him.
*****
Tony grins at his assistant, scoffing down another huge bit of deep fried dough before speaking. “Blame it on my trainer,” Tony says simply. He proceeds to munch on his third donut as Pepper watches him in disbelief. “There’s a table full of food that nobody’s eating. What the hell?”
He had already pictured what the column beside his photographs would read:
“Hey, listen,” Steve speaks as he waves his co-star inside. “I’m gonna have to call you back.”
If at all possible, Howard’s anger rises.
“Save it,” Howard raises a hand. “What I want you to do is get Sharon Carter, see to it that her license is ripped from her and she never works in this city again. I’ll deal with the rest.”
Steve eases into the water  gracefully. With the grace of a crocodile slithering in to stalk its prey.
Tony looks up at Steve, face flushed as their breathing slowly calms in unison.
Howard’s  been expecting his son to show up, but in all honestly, not so soon.
Tony’s gaze is making it impossible for Steve to stare long enough into his eyes to try to read what was coming next.
Pepper rolls her eyes, hardly believing it.
Thor complies and for the next few minutes they go through the dialogue. Lee listens contently while Rhodey jumps from scene to scene. Hill speaks fluently, thoroughly engaging herself in her various roles. And it’s easy considering how well Thor pulls his own weight.
Bucky left him.
“Thank you,” Tony stands, letting out his hand and trying not to pay attention to the venomous glare his agent is giving him. “You’ll be hearing from me.”
Steve eyes the empty space on the bed beside Tony. In the state that he’s in, it looks like the best decision he will make all night. It isn’t long before Steve is shrugging his pants off and kicking them into the mass with his t-shirt and jacket and the rest of Tony’s clothing.
*****
Tony Stark want?”
invited Tony. Can we just get on with the task at hand and pretend he’s not here. No offence Tony.”
“That whole
Steve extinguishes his fears.
“Where are we going?” Steve asks, quickly gulping down his cereal while wondering how Tony had pulled a disappearing act with his own.
“No,” Steve shakes his head as if that will help clear it, “I’ll get it done.”
It’s only a coincidence that as Steve walks down the corridor of the studio, his eyes happen to fall on Maria Stark.
“Tony,” his mother warns.
It’s nothing like anything he’s ever been in, windows going all the way up to the ceiling and unnecessary decorative pillars parting them, lodged in every corner too. It’s all gentle creams and impossibly white linen, the carpet posh enough to make its softness known through Steve’s socks when he toes off his shoes. Even with the high lamps slightly dimmed, Steve can make out the calculated swirls on the wall, crevices too deep to be wallpaper yet too distinctive to be stencil.
“Who is this ‘Mr. Stark’ you mistake me for,” Tony lets his unshaven jaw glide across Steve’s as he slightly backs away, “he must be handsome.”
Steve releases Tony from between his lips, taking in the musky male taste as he moves up Tony’s body. Slowly and incredibly torturously.
Steve is not going to be alright at all.
Tony only feels half embarrassed about displaying such affection in front of the man when Steve takes his hand. He decides to relax when all Joseph offers was a pleased smile.
behind the safety of his shatterproof glass walls. Observing between barely parted blinds. Just enough to oversee flaws while overlooking hard work. Steve had been in that very office just that morning, the reasoning behind Stark firing him weighing down just as heavily as the rejected engagement ring in his front pocket.
*****
“Oh, don’t let me get started on that,” Steve scoffs. “I swear, the only reason why people watch that show is in the hopes of Tony Stark taking his shirt off-”
“The fact that your son is all over magazines kissing a boy who happens to be his co-star in a gay movie that you are thoroughly against him having any part of,” Pepper says with pause.
I do it for Peter because there is no way my Baby Boy is going to be able to cope if he loses Tony.
Tony can’t stop the big grin on his face. ‘It is indeed, Mama.’ He gives Steve a wink before turning and heading down to meet Peter and his aunt.
‘Screwing the odds,’ Sam grins and chinks his own against Rhodes’.
She presses a kiss to the top of his head. ‘Yeah. Yeah I’m fine, Baby Spider. We should probably head back though, it’s nearly eight.’
Opening his eyes he moves just enough to be able to look at the soldier. ‘Good morning,’ he presses a kiss to the man’s lips, slipping an arm out from between them to keep his head close.
‘No way really?’ Peter looks between the two red suited men. ‘I heard Miss Natasha saying they were trying to get intel on you.’
‘Well, what is it then?’ Valkyrie grumbles. ‘Not all of us have been here before you know.’
‘At least it isn’t Mr Stark,’ Ned tries to comfort him.
Peter pauses in his work, his head tilted to one side as he thinks, worrying his bottom lip and with a look of concentration on his face that is so familiar he’s actually beginning to wonder if Peter isn’t actually a long lost love child of Tony’s younger years. The teenager nods, bringing Bruce from his musings. ‘I think he would have done. HYDRA would have created him, if not someone else, if you guys hadn’t. AI is one of the big races right? Someone would eventually have given him some form of life, maybe not the exact way you guys did, but definitely in some way. I think, from what I’ve heard, he was
It’s one of those moments, those perfect moments where he’s just blurted out the truth of his soul; now all that he has to do is lean in an inch, kiss the boy and all will live happily ever after.
“I really am sor-”
She holds his gaze as he passes, no spite in her expression at all.
But Steve thinks, perhaps, simple respect in the workplace isn’t the only thing that Steve has really wanted from Tony all along.
Tony smiles as he watches Steve hug his father as best as he can without disturbing the hospital apparatus. Apart from the shaggy grizzled hair and dark morning shadow, there’s no mistaking the obvious resemblance between the two.
“He’s Tony Stark’s co-star.” She sighs, her confidence making Brock itch. Of course he will listen to her now.
“Hey, Mr. Hollywood,” the grin is apparent in his dad’s voice, the usual carefree haze in his tone. “How’s it feel like being a celebrity?”
Of late, Tony has been sick of being reminded about that. Somehow, the woman’s reaction only amuses him.
The young lady makes her way to the door and closes it behind her.
There’s no doubting it. Mr. Stark knows everything.
As Tony leaves the kitchen, Steve is left to wonder why he didn’t.
Although Steve’s mind is working in overdrive, given his circumstances, he doesn’t have to wait long to figure out exactly why he’s been called in once again.
“Must’ve left it in car,” Tony shrugs, looking from Pepper who’s still trying to calm someone down to an irritated Hogan. “What’s wrong?”
“I’m afraid I can’t give that –”
He’s worried about Tony. Concerned about his career, yes, but most of his emotion is directed at the boy. His family. His future.
“It’s okay,” Pepper comforts whoever is on the other end of her cellphone, “We found him.”
“Well,” Tony starts, “at first I wasn’t really sure if I wanted to do it. Even after the talk show fiasco. But then I actually sat down and read the script. Pepper, it kept me up all night, I was hooked. This story has to be told, and I want to be the one to bring it to life.”
But this
For the first time in a while, Steve looks up at Tony, vaguely noticing him digging in his pockets.
“On second thoughts,” Tony straightens, sliding the disk labelled ‘Let’s Get It On’ into his jacket pocket. “Jack in IT can take care of it in the morning. Enjoy your evening Mr. Rogers”
“Tony,” Stan begins. “Take a seat. Let me finish.”
Tony moves away just as Steve leans in.
Tony has to restrain from rolling his eyes in front of thousands.
Brock jumps back into his rusted, black convertible, mouthwatering from the invaluable photographs of gold he has to deliver to Sharon.
Maria’s hands on his wrists slows him.
A sensation he’d been sure he would never feel again.
Maria holds still, holding her breath subconsciously as she watches her son sought through his emotions in front of her.
drive right over here like I told you to?” Howard turns on Hogan, who looks stunned by the abrupt rage turned on him. “What the hell am I paying you for?”
compromise?”
The photograph on Steve’s nightstand catch Tony’s eye. It’s a family photograph. Bright smiles all around with Steve looking a lot younger.
“Mr. Stark,” another reporter shouts, interrupting Tony’s escape. Tony turns to see who it is and finds no reporter he knows in particular. Tony likes new reporters. They’re even grateful for a simple smile like the one he offers as he walks over to her. “Mr. Stark, my name is Laura from Hawkeye.”
“Hmmm,” Joseph sounds skeptical. Then as if an after-thought, he adds, “Bucky wasn’t too pleased about it.”
That contact from before. The pace. The movement. The feeling. It’s mystifying to say the least. Why he wants it. Why he has to fight to move off of Steve.
Steve feels his pulse quicken from the look Tony’s giving him. Why the hell is he so afraid to believe Tony? Is it for his own reasons? Is it because the boy who has just said those words to him was Tony Stark?
“Do you wanna go out there for me?” Tony asks. “Do you? Because I don’t mind, but I think the audience might be just a little disappointed.”
Steve rolls his eyes at the tackiness of the case in his hand, chuckling at the scantily dressed cowboys who apparently ‘find sweet, hot love in the barn’, when a presence looms over his shoulder.
Tony whispers the same curse that Pepper screamed out loud in her head.
“Steve,” Tony raises both brows, concern filling his brown eyes. Steve realizes he’s probably given himself away. “Why don’t we do this? Why don’t we just pretend that I’m not Tony Stark? Pretend there’s no upcoming movie and no fans. No parents, no tabloids. And just see where we end up.”
But not quite like this.
“You never did,” Howard says a little too calmly. Steve looks at Mr. Lee who’s still uncharacteristically quiet in his seat. “I don’t blame you that he’s…. changed.”
He’d absently noticed the welcoming plainness of the place as he’d walked up the short driveway. It’s one of those old fashioned family homes, conservative and well kept, complete with front porch and a porch swing.
Tony takes a deep breath, trying to calm himself down when his father starts speaking again.
see it, Tony. Don’t you?”
He is Tony Stark.
Steve’s mouth is warm, tongue unbelievable. Teeth just enough.
And he’s beautiful. Steve is really beautiful.
Tony’s shaking; Steve can feel it when Tony’s chest touches his back.
Tony feels guilty for not picking up on something this huge.
Steve begins to speak, it’s his cue to do so. But he’s interrupted by Tony’s lips over his.
“His name is Steve Rogers.”
“He postponed last minute,” Steve shrugs, pouring milk into both bowls before sliding one over to Tony.
“Because I’ve only just taken over the family business less than a week and all that you said there is just gibberish to me,” he says nonchalantly with the smallest of shrugs. “Now, if you want a beer, I can get you a beer. But if you want that fancy nonsense I’ll get you the bartender.”
“What changed, Tony?” Steve asks, leaning back against the shorter boy’s hard frame.
Steve gets ready, clearing his throat. He has the opening line in the scene and knows it by heart due to repetition. Instead, Steve’s taken off guard when Tony jumps right to the line proceeding the kiss.
He wonders if Tony Stark ever wishes that he could be just a Steve.
With such a delightful crew and an awesome look, Tony decides that Hogan couldn’t have picked a better brand for him.
Tony knows he’s doing way too much thinking. Even while he’s doing his best to block out scornful looks from his father and judging looks from his friends. He’s trying to block all of them out completely; yet making the effort still brings them up nonetheless.
But today is different. All cellphones are off and appointments aside. They have gotten this far in the script, and Steve is determined to get through the entire thing at least once before the big day, but Tony isn’t making it easy.
“I’ve got it, don’t worry.”
Hogan almost lets himself grin in thought.
“You wanted to see us Howard.”
Waking up at the hospital to Tony Stark’ face was what he’d thought would be the biggest and only surprise for the day. Though completely pleased by this, he was extremely nervous from the uncomfortable silence that had surrounded them on the long car ride back home. He’d tried not to doze off so as not to miss any moment that Tony might decide to speak to him. But Tony’s shoulder was apparently more comfortable than he’d thought, and shortly after resting his head there, he was out for the next hour.
“Tony, listen to me.”
Until that kiss.
“Stark?” he frowns, “I think you may have me confused with someone else. Now, this one here,” Steve’s boss ignores his astonishment, stepping into Steve’s personal space in a way that brings them chest to chest as he reaches past the blond man to pick a case off the shelf, “this one still makes me wanna salute the troops and sing Sweet Home Alabama.”
“Stop,” Bucky looks as though he’s about to go squint. “That is just way too complicated and fucked up.”
“The nut.” Hogan mumbleds.
Tony paces back down the corridor, swinging his car keys around his index finger. If Lee had noticed the awkward silence between the two young men, he hadn’t let on.
But he’s lazy and it’s amusing and Tony’s laughter is really contagious, so he fights against but doesn’t free himself from the body that’s restraining him.
Tony didn’t see Steve that day. They were in the same building on two occasions, they never crossed paths. Pepper picked up on this almost instantly. Mentioning it to Tony was completely out of the question. So when Tony pushed an extra load of weights and did more pull-ups than necessary, she decided to let him work off his anger the way he saw fit.
There’re several magazines, but only one is open. Pepper dares a glance over at the page on display and then immediately wishes she hadn’t.
Hogan clears his throat, a completely obvious yet subtle warning that she is seconds away from getting them both fired.
“I assure you, this will be worth your while,” she continues calmly. “He’s about to be-”
They really needed to talk.
“That’s what you said, like, an hour ago,” Tony frowns, propping himself up against the wall as Pepper digs in her pockets for her apartment key.
Steve’s grin suddenly falls away when Tony looks at him almost solemnly. Not solemn, annoyed, that’s what it is.
“My dad is not talking to me,” Tony grins, “remember? It’s been weeks.”
He doesn’t realize that he’s holding his breath as the distance vanishes between them.
As he strips out of his clothes, taking in every detail of the room as he goes along, a strong part of him wants to just go against his promise and drive the extra miles to see Steve.
Tony mouths the words,
“Tony,” Howard speaks steadily, “I did what any father would do. I protected my son.”
With a few parting words and waves, Tony and Steve leave the room, letting Mrs. Wanda get her chance to see Joseph Rogers.
Tony’s face instantly changes and Natasha feels shivers of joy run down her spine. She loves it, loves getting under her guests’ skin.
“You need to talk to Steve.”
Tony laughs hard.
Tony watches the two boys run to the front porch. To where a young dark-haired man is seated on the porch swing.
“Now, who else in my wing can say they get one hospital visit by two celebrities in one day?” Joseph chuckles.
“Well, if nobody else is hassling to take a few impromptu images of my client, I’ll just have to do it myself,” there’s a smile present in her voice. “He’s not exactly a live wire and if I’m going to get this kid famous he’s actually gotta be known.”
Tony only half cares for Steve’s standoffishness.
Tony looks around himself, blankly taking note of his surroundings. Steve’s hotel bed is unmade, pillow still softly dented. The light from the television is the only thing illuminating the room.
But, Tony’s passion is what Stan loved most, and as he sees Tony’s temper flare and his sureness ooze stability, he can easily believe that Tony is a little more than just smitten by Steve Rogers.
The dressing room door swings open. Howard Stark strides swiftly in with Hogan right behind him. Tony can almost swear he can smell brimstone.
“Looks like you have a visitor, Steven,” Ms. Wanda mutters. It’s completely obvious that she’s less than pleased and Tony finds himself more confused than curious.
As Tony walks away, Steve wonders why he doesn’t feel satisfied that the balance in power has not only been restored, but has altogether shifted. And it’s weighing in his favor. The thought of no more victimization should feel magnificent. The idea of getting away with insubordination long enough for Tony Stark to know how it feels, to feel what he’s been putting up with, Steve should be basking in the glow of power he now has, the type Tony had tortured him with all this time.  Steve will finally get the respect he deserves.
“Why didn’t you tell me before?” Tony asks softly.
Of how she has to let him go.
father could join us some time.
“As usual, I can’t say much,” Tony admits with a smile, “It’s still in its baby stages, you know?”
Steve feels the little bit of perseverance he’d mustered to prolong the show disappear the moment Stark moves past his balls and reaches for his hole. Because Stark is a hardcore man of authority he has unimaginable power and uncountable riches, yet here is, wide-open and vulnerable, giving himself to Steve so certainly.
“Howard,” Lee begins, “you can’t seriously be bla-”
“Come on,” Tony rolls his eyes, “everyone knows that half the stuff that comes out of Romanovs’ mouth is complete bullshit.”
“Oh,” Tony nods down at him and then towards the door, “you can wait in the office if you’d like.”
Tony feels his tongue slip between Steve’s lips and Steve moans.
. Jesus, we can only handle one Keanu Reeves at a time.”
“Not in the least,” Hogan shrugs, and then grins when Tony playfully hits his arm. “You gonna be okay out there?”
“Tony?”
The smiles on the girls’ faces are infectious and Tony finds himself grinning wildly despite himself.
Steve covers the ground between them, falling into step with Tony as he immediately continues down the hallway.
Steve feels his suddenly exposed cock throb when Tony’s eyes fix on it. Feels it leak when Tony spreads his legs wider, taking his own cock into a loose fist. Giving it a few distracted strokes before squeezing the base. As if he too realizes there is no way in hell that round one is going to last very long at all.
Steve notices the frustration on Tony’s face. His voice has become considerably louder as well. It snaps Steve out of the little fight they are having and brings him back to their surroundings.
“Dad, I already confirmed on national television that I’m doing it.”
“The producer?” Howard scowls harder. “What were you doing at a studio when I told you to be here at exactly three o’clock?”
“Oh, ok.” Bucky scoffs. “You shag a couple times in the span of a month and now suddenly you know him?”
Not a lot amuses Bucky, Steve knows this. That’s why his tiny hint of shock goes a long way.
Either way, he can’t seem to shake the feeling.
“Kills himself?” Pepper cocks her head to the side. Still uninterested.
“I’ll give you a ride.” Tony decides, and Steve is glad that they’ll at least have a little more time to spend together.
The kid is clearly humble and comfortably tense, like humility is amour he never leaves home without.
would be the inevitable final walk of shame that comes with it. But both pale in comparison to finding his replacement in his seat before the leather even had time to get cold.
She likes the idea that both of them have grown in more ways than one.
“I would have to say when my father-in-law made his full recovery,” Tony says, becoming slightly serious. “I mean, doctors said he would never walk again. I’ll tell you now; he’s doing a lot more than walking.”
“So what,” Brock raises a brow, “You want a few snaps of the kid. Why?”
“You’re not done,” Jarvis states accusingly.
And Rhodey really does mean it.
“Nitro Cold Brew,” Steve holds the glass up to a very startled and horribly sexy-looking Tony. Tony always looks most edible when his hair is still a mess and his robe is barely tied and he’s so thrown off routine that he looks as though he might fumble an equation that a first grader can answer in their sleep.
“Four and a half years does seem pretty long though.”
“Just call me Sharon.” She says, oozing triumph.
She knows that everyone’s looking at Tony in a different light, but doubts anyone notices the change as much as she does.
“Would you like to take a seat sir?” a lady in the control room asks him. Hogan almost doesn’t hear her, his eyes fixed on one of the many screens and his heart beating thunderously.
Steve grins, plotting revenge in his head. His sole target being Tony, since he had the one appointing teams.
“How are you feeling?” Steve asks, not moving too far away from his dad’s side.
For a moment, neither of them says a word. Tony’s trying to remember Steve had told about it, but he just hadn’t being paying attention. Maybe he hadn’t listened to Steve well enough at all.
“But you don’t understand.”
“It’s a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Rogers.”
For some completely unexplainable reason, he isn’t taking into account the fact that his father has also viewed the very same photographs.
“That’s really low, Lee,” Hogan roars. “You have no right putting that kind of responsibility on him.”
“My god, but you’re a tease,” she accuses, calming from her laughter. “How are you, my dear?”
by everyone else. What he was to say was already written, what he was to feel was told to him. How he had to act was directed.
Howard finds what he was looking for and tosses the envelope onto the desk between the two of them. When Tony simply eyes him, Howard gestures towards it, encouraging his boy to open it.
Tony’s sure Lee assumes the silence is there for all his own reasons. Tony’s sure Lee saw right through his calm, quiet facade and noticed every time Steve stole nervous glances at him in return. Tony wonders how good an actor Steve Rogers actually is, because he did a pathetic job of disguising his embarrassment the entire time in Lee’s  office.
“I should have told you,” Steve nods, “but I couldn’t have accepted anything from you. It would have felt like I was using you or something.”
,” Pepper laughs when Hogan decides to assist Kenny Rogers with his lines. It isn’t a mocking laugh and Hogan doesn’t take it as such. The low chuckle that comes from Hogan, however, still does shock her.
They’ve been through at least two dozen boys, all auditioning for the same roll. Lee inwardly questions his decision to agree with James Rhodes to aim this roll at a newcomer. But then, Rhodey is renowned for assembling the best casts in film, he’s been doing it for years. And so Lee, though exhausted, decides to let go of the reigns and let the master do his job.
*****
Hogan and Pepper don’t know what to do with the magazine that’s shoved in their direction across the table.
“Oh good god,” Tony is placing the coffee aside and already turning to push Steve away as if only just remembering what day it really is, “how many times have I told you how I feel about –”
“And in other news,” Natasha Romanov’s smile is thoroughly malicious, “Tony Stark, star of the hit show,
“Tell me it isn’t true?” Tony doesn’t care that he sounds desperate to hear it.
,” Bucky’s at least mindful enough to lower his voice when his outburst earns the two of them some disapproving looks from passers-by. “Whatever happened to the past year of you convincing me not to worry because
“Sharon,” Brock begins, “I’m really sorry. I never thought that would happen. I assumed I could make it a win-win situation. I pocket a few extra k’s and you get Steve Rogers known. I was still going to sell the images either way.”
Tony and Steve stand in front of each other for the first time in what feels like forever, Steve searching Tony’s face, while Tony distracts himself by straightening up the disorientated boy in front of him.
,” Tony says mockingly, “
“You’re just
Tony Stark is no virgin. But he certainly feels virgin to this.
“Oh,” Howard finally says, shoving the photo back into the envelope, “I had no idea I was paying you two to fuck on the job.”
In reality, Mr. Stark was no longer staring into his eyes and holding him passionately. The man who walked in was downright ignoring him, changing course when their paths threatened to cross and holding up a finger with his ear pressed to the phone on the three occasions Steve had felt brave enough to deliver the meeting’s agenda personally. Steve had found himself even missing his Monday morning dose of hearing how incompetent he was.
“Is something wrong?” Steve asks softly as he exits the bathroom. He’s wearing a pair of jorts and a t-shirt and Tony is actually relieved his at least dressed.
It isn’t like Steve is a stranger to the joys and ease of the internet, he’s just stubbornly old-fashioned. Steve often jokes about how he’d still be using a typewriter if it could email. So as much as Bucky tries to make Steve realize he is living in the 21st century, there are still certain routines that he refuses to shake off.
“Whatever you’re having,” Steve says, not really wanting to think. Because if he does he will realize that he is in a hotel room in Manhattan on a Friday night with his boss who made it perfectly clear that he wants them to outdo every gay porno in Brooklyn. He instead steps out onto the balcony, wanting to get some fresh air into his tight lungs and the view into his muddled brain. But he only makes it two steps onto the deck before a hand is turning him around at the shoulder and strong arms are wrapping around his waist. Steve stumbles back until his lower back hits the railing, Stark’s lips over his the entire time.
“Okay, Sharon,” he says carefully. She can sense his nervousness and she loves it. “My name is Steve Rogers. I haven’t actually been to one of these things in years so I’m not quite sure what to do or what I was supposed to bring. I brought my portfolio though.”
“I’m strictly behind the scenes for this one,” Tony admits. “I’m enjoying it more this way, in fact. It just makes it so much better my being here tonight that it’s the same night the world will be introduced properly to Sam Wilson, who happens to be the lead in our production.”
The audience’s reaction is a mixture of astonishment and enthrallment and applause. Peggy is stunned to a nervous laugh.
“I know why you’re here,” Steve notices Stan’s look of defeat as Howard proceeds, “I know why you tried your chances at this business. I’ve done enough research on you. Somehow I knew you were going to be trouble.”
“I see.” Natasha nods, inwardly impressed by just how much the young star has grown. “Well, I understand Steve is here tonight.”
Every memory with Steve Rogers has been a lie so sweet that its truth becomes as bitter as bile.
into his stereo in the lounge. It successfully removes all the distorted chanting rock music that Tony had been blasting all through dinner.
“Dad,” Steve speaks softly.
“Pleased with yourself?” Howard mumbles, the second the door is closed and they’re alone.
A young man standing a few feet away behind his son.
“Yeah,” Steve sits up a little straighter, hope rising. “When I was six. I did a skit for Drink-O-Pop.”
Hogan knows that everyone thinks Tony’s just being unassuming for show. Hogan knows it’s just who Tony is.
She observes him almost as if she’s inwardly coming to terms with something. She looks at him with only what Steve can pin as concern.
“Better,” Tony loses no momentum. “Zane tries one last time. He drops everything, packs his life into his car and drives miles and miles to the one place he thinks Jake just might be. I mean, he literally leaves everything behind for a chance. He doesn’t even know if it’s a sure thing, but he goes. He remembers Jake once mentioning a place to him, in one of their many conversations. So he goes there. Day, night, day trip. And when he finally gets there, he
“Anyway, he’s stayed around for dinner a coupla times. Watched a little teli, just the usual,” Joseph says cheerfully. “Hey, he’s here now Wanna speak to him. I’ll put him on.”
“It’s about these two guys, young guys, my age,” Tony begins, “and their living out this, perfect love affair behind everyone’s back. I mean, they are madly in love with each other. Then three months before the year is over, Jake, well, the one guy just disappears. His family leaves town. He goes without telling anyone. Not even Zane, the lead actor. My character.”
It’s hope. Hope that maybe Steve has been speaking about him to his family. His family has made an effort to know who he is.
But all of that fades when he peers through the peephole of his apartment door.
Begged him to stop apologizing.
And right then, he so desperately needed to.
As much as Hogan hates it, Tony’s faded jeans look even more ripped than the last time he’d worn them and his once piercing white shoes are now grubby.  Hogan wonders how he’s ended up with the
When Hogan gets out of the bed, Pepper’s grateful that he’d at least bothered putting his briefs back on before confronting her. Somehow, arguing with a naked seemed uncouth.
the premier.”
“You won’t regret this Mr. Stark.” Lee shakes Tony’s hand, shooting Hogan a triumphant look as he does.
A stern look from Hogan wipes the smile off Tony’s face; reminding him of where he is and what situation he’s in.
Tony feels defeated.
“What are you talking about?” Tony’s instantly sitting up and Steve immediately feels like he has to explain himself.
Tony looks down for a second as if deep in thought. “I need you, okay? Don’t let my father win again. He’s not gonna ruin this for me. If you want me to leave... If you.... you wanna leave me, let it be because you don’t want me anymore.”
Steve steps closer to Tony, only barely dodging being run down by a burly man with a screaming infant in his arms.
They’ve been doing this all morning, admiring random craft displays in the busy flee market. Tony has purchased two engraved dog tags that are intricately hand-made and he’s even talked Steve into joining him in a round of questionable falafels that tasted worlds better than they looked. But frankly, Steve is more than ready to go somewhere much quieter.
Howard hasn’t yet looked at his wife. Not once the entire time she spoke. The vein bulging on Howard’s forehead is akin to the timer on a bomb. Pepper finds herself holding her breath.
Bright eyes, warm smile. Beautiful.
“I guess I should at least let them know I’m alright.” Tony mumbles.
Tony sighs with a smile as if he’s nervous about the fact that he’s actually going to give Steve an honest answer.
The television set.
Maria can feel it coming, and it almost hurts too hard for her to continue.
“Can we take five?” Tony sits up, looking up hopefully at his lean, muscled trainer.
“Oh,” Tony says accusingly, “Do you have to like, report my every move to him?”
It was the
“I’m not trying to,” Tony shrugs. Momentarily, he forgets to hold his own weight, leaning onto Pepper a little more clumsily and causing them to stumble in the posh apartment building corridor.
Stark holds Steve’s eyes and Steve is incapable of not shrinking under his boss’s attention.
It’s a badly drawn caricature of Mr. Stark being struck by lightning, a lot better than the one he’d drawn of Stark being eaten by a shark during their last boardroom meeting. Steve hides his chuckle behind his fist, feigning a cough. It isn’t due to Bucky’s poor sense of humor; it’s the look of accomplishment on his face that always cracks Steve up.  The same mischief from years ago when they were being reprimanded by the principal for tugging Pepper Potts’ pigtails.
His heart is slamming against his chest, head heating over with pain. His jaw clenches with rage.
It’s overwhelming.
Steve wants to roll his eyes, but he can’t. As dizzy as he is he feels it might make him lose his balance because Tony’s closeness is making him a lot more than embarrassingly hard. Tony’s intentions seem clearer by the second. Tony’s game starts to make sense. And so Steve shocks himself by saying; “He’s a royal asshole.”
Steve not only sees it in Stark’s eyes, he feels it pulsate against his thigh. He hates that he forgets to forget that his best friend is always right. He hates that he forgets all the horrible ways his boss has treated him. He hates himself for voicing the insane thoughts that suddenly hold way too much truth.
“This color’s not cute on you,” Sharon says, referring to his idiocy and doubting he knows it. He further proves her point by looking down at his own pants and then back up at her.
“What? I mean so little to you that you’re just gonna leave without saying goodbye,” Bucky frowns and Steve frowns harder because Bucky is rummaging through his box as he says it. The short time in which it takes his best friend to relieve him of his cactus, stapler and
It isn’t clear who’s more shocked to see who. Tony raises a brow and Pepper takes an exasperated sigh of relief while Hogan’s frown just deepens.
Tony is merely a bonus.
After an entire day of feeling a whole lot less than nothing, Steve decides to do exactly what Tony Stark is doing, pretend that nothing ever happen in the hopes of them both somehow forgetting it ever did long enough for everything to go back to normal.
Even so, there is no way Bucky can be right about this one.
“No, don’t worry,” Bucky shrugs, letting go of Tony’s hand, “I’m actually really impressed. You really aimed high, didn’t you?”
“You see, Tony,” Howard says, walking around the table as Tony lifts the envelope and carefully pulls out its contents “You see what happens when you trust the wrong people. When you refuse to trust the right ones. Steve Rogers hired some two-bit photographer to follow the two of you around just waiting for the perfect moment to get that money shot. He used you.”
But what Steve will miss most of all about being with Tony Stark is the way Tony made Steve feel worth being with. Like they were in some sort of collective reverie that started with Tony’s intake yet didn’t end on Steve’s exhale. Like the mere touch of Tony’s fingertips against his temple could erase every bad memory and trace in new beautiful imageries filled with hope and happiness. It could only be that fake thing stupid people liked to label as love and Steve had hoped they’d share that idiocy forever.
Steve notices Tony blush, withdrawing slightly. He half wishes his father hadn’t brought that part of Tony up, but can hardly blame his old man for it.
“No way,” Pepper gapes genuinely.
*****
Tony tosses the pillow aside and props himself up on his elbows. A tiny wave of anger flashes through him when he realizes that Steve has far surpassed his own high score.
Her laugh is somewhat melodic with a cruel undertone. “If you can’t be a shady agent why not become paparazzi, right?”
All day it’s been dull.
“Yeah, I’m sorry. I am.” Steve tears his eyes away from the vehicle’s interior long enough to look at Tony. “It’s just; when you said you’ll pick me up I didn’t expect a limo. I mean, I should have, but I didn’t.”
“You can play the guitar?” Tony beams and Steve feels  pitiful for feeling so awesome by the fact that Tony’s genuinely impressed by what he could do.
Steve feels his back hit the wall. And it’s only a few feet back, but unexpected nonetheless. Tony’s lips once again come over Steve’s for the fourth time that day.
“Why?”
“I don’t care, Hogan.”
“We’re doing things my way,” Steve barely recognizes his own voice as he kisses Tony at a very bad angle in a very good way, “I wanna see your face every single second I’m inside of you.”
As the audience slowly begins to make their way out and the stars of the movie prepare themselves for the inevitable interviews, Steve glares at Tony once again. He’s been doing it throughout the entire movie. Tony was either pretending not to notice or really didn’t care.  All Steve had received from Tony was a questioning shrug the single time that Tony wasn’t ignoring Steve all together.
“Absolutely nothing.” Tony replies.
He wonders what Steve must be going through. The entire family, in fact.
“Yeah, okay,” Hogan chuckles evilly, “wait ‘til you hear what it’s about.”
“Hope to be hearing from you soon,” Brock makes an awkward escape for the door, “There’s only so long that I can hold onto the copies before the tabloids get them.”
“Well, Tony Stark,” Natasha grins, “It’s certainly been a while.”
He makes his way to his study, fully aware that his son is right behind him.
There were many things Stan Lee had always liked about Tony. From the moment the young man was still a boy, following Hogan around with a smile that brightened sets and an eagerness that drew masses.
Then there are the numerous times that Tony’s phone will ring, Hogan demanding Tony right away or Lee phoning either or both boys to ask them to meet him at the studio. As production day was growing closer, Steve and Tony seemed to be having less and less time to get ready for the much anticipated performance.
“Give it up son,” Tony feels one end of the battle dwindle as he pieces everything together. Only, there were certain parts of the puzzle that just refused to fit. Even with the truth being told to him, by the last person he’d ever expected it from.
Sharon makes a silent prayer that she’s crushed him just enough to make sure he doesn’t go knocking on anyone else’s door any time soon. She hopes he thinks he needs her.
Brock is the master of scandalous shots.
Steve looks at Tony, their eyes locking. Steve is trying to search for honesty in Tony’s words, truth he can’t seem to pin with the grin still present on the other boy’s face.
“Tony-” Hogan interrupts, giving the boy a stern look, “-does not have to make any decisions right now. He has enough on his plate, Lee. You know this.”

“Elevator-making-out is so archaic, isn’t it?” Tony smiles even as Steve forgets to pause the kiss. Because Tony’s mouth is just as smart and talented as Steve feared it would be.
“You don’t understand,” Tony can tell that Steve is trying to convince himself that Tony is delusional.
“What are you gonna do?” Steve asks carefully.
Is Howard, very indirectly, questioning Tony?
“I’m shocked.”
“I always wanted him to,” Howard shrugs. “I wanted you to give it up even more though. But Steve Rogers made it so easy for me after our meeting today.”
“I saw it,” Steve is startled by Tony’s voice beside him. “Not bad, huh?”
“Well, don’t lose sleep finding another,” Clint shrugs when he notices his question has somehow become rhetorical, “You’re Tony Stark, after all.”
When Lee had finally finished speaking to the two young men, Tony had simply shook Steve’s hand and said his goodbyes.
“Stars and stripes,” Tony chuckles. “Are you serious?”
“Well it’s a good thing I don’t work for him, then. Isn’t it?”
“That’s too bad,” Thor shrugs.
It makes Tony wonder why everything is so different now when he looks at Steve. Before, it was a fellow, obviously attractive, co-star. Now, he’s the essence of all Tony’s desires.
“I’ll call my driver,” Tony offers, this time in no mood to try and get Steve to stay.
“Resting, mostly,” he gives an uncomfortably nervous chuckle. “She passed away a while ago.”
“You’re not ready?” Howard frowns, not missing a beat as he grabs the plate off his son’s lap and pulls off the napkin that had been tucked into the collar of his black shirt. Tony cringes for the make-up artist when his father grabs the powder brush out of her hand. “My son does
“Ah, Howard,” Hogan says simply with mock fondness. He is, however, grateful that Pepper has also taken it upon herself to slip
The man who
Steve holds the door in place, a strange look crossing his face that tells Tony that Steve obviously thinks something really bad has to have happened for Tony to be on the other side of his door.
“That was a long time ago, my dear,” Hogan states calmly, “back when the man still knew how to laugh. There is no way he is going to listen to my advice. Especially not where Tony is concerned.”
Tony considers Steve; the boy’s hair a mess, bright blue eyes oozing the sort of delight that actually makes him start a little. The smile on Steve’s face is genuine, his cheeks flushed pink and  lips just as rosy.
Stan thinks it wise to get rid of the photographer before Howard’s shock wears off and something else takes over.
“I needed to talk to you,” Tony confesses, barely above a whisper.
Steve is so grateful that he doesn’t even have to try not to laugh because there is something about touching Tony again that has him incomprehensibly aroused.
Pepper opens the door and Tony follows dangerously close behind her. So close that she can feel his every move.
The last scene has all eyes glued to the big screen ahead. Then the music fades out as does the screen until the entire place was filled with blackness moments before the credits roll.
“I thought those things were only for famous people,” Steve says earnestly, clearly having separated himself from everything despite the golden invitation in his pocket.
“What just happened?” Bucky hangs over the partition and Steve notices his friend is already all coated up and ready to bolt, just in case Stark comes back and makes him stay behind too – guilt by association. Stark has done it before. “You just said no to Stark and corrected him in less a minute. How are you not fired?”
‘Thanks, Karen. It’s good to hear your voice. Guys? I’m suited up. Deadpool’s got a comms link and is taking Ned to the roof. Can someone take him to the jet?’
‘Nott and Dagr shall return tomorrow for more orders, until then I think we should rest,’ Loki concludes.
Strange and Wong exchange a look, and Wong nods. ‘Alright,’ Strange says, ‘we’ll be here tomorrow at noon. In the meantime we shall see what information the Sanctum and Kamar-Taj possesses on the Infinity Stones.’
Boothe goes to raise his hand but Wade shoves past him and grabs the cue off of Peter’s last opponent. ‘You can play me, Baby Boy.’
‘Maybe not,’ he concedes. ‘And I certainly wouldn’t have let anyone go with him.’
‘I’ll speak to May,’ he replies, ‘and see what their plans are.’
‘What? Where did
‘What should we do?’ Mantis looks between Wanda and her carefully cut out cookie shapes.
Rhodes laughs. ‘Mama I promise we’ll be fine. We’re not looking after ourselves anyway the rest of the team is here, plus Laura and Clint are coming for Christmas so she’s going to be in charge of the kitchen.’
‘Hey, Steve? Isn’t it your turn to cook tonight?’ Sam says from the sofa.
Tony chuckles next to him. ‘Bet you’d never thought you’d say
‘Funny that he chooses
‘Well we’re the right place to come for mercs,’ the man replies, looking around uncomfortably, ‘but I’m still not sure this is the place you want to be, kid.’
Tony takes on some reports. Peter let's Deadpool help out on a patrol, but things don't go according to plan.
‘Now,’ T’Challa sighs, ‘now we must reveal that HYDRA has been involved in the committee. I am hoping that it will tip the scales in our favour. Show that the team needs more independence to be freer from malign influences.’
‘I would have got him out somehow. And this is different, this is the whole team being targeted.’
‘What the fuck you talking about, Francis?’
‘You just
‘Steve!’ he sees Sam waving to him from where he’s ducked down by some representatives, trying to keep them out of the line of fire.

‘Getting us all back, dealing with the Council, making sure there’s everything we need at the facility, protecting us from Ross, upgrading weapons and armour, and now this new found PR war he’s decided to declare. I could go on but I think you get my drift,’ Bucky presses the button to call the elevator and Steve leans up against the side.
‘I did both,’ Steve says with sudden clarity. ‘Oh god, Rhodey-’
‘How do you mean distracts them?’ another person asks.

‘Yes,’ Peter rolls his eyes. ‘Wears a red suit, won’t shut up, absolutely nuts, has two katana and
‘Considering you’ve been sat in those same sessions I have with him for the past few weeks, are you honestly that surprised?’ Bucky’s tone is softer now as he comes to rest on the railing next to him.
‘I can’t leave him, Nat,’ he replies, going back to the front of the truck with the other two following close behind. ‘Not after Wakanda. I don’t care if he can come back-’
Any further conversation is interrupted by a strange fizzing sound, and orange light appears in the room, steadily growing larger into a circle.
write them and send them out.’
‘It’s bugging you isn’t it?’ Rhodes asks him.
They play a couple of games, and Peter notices the woman starting to relax the more she’s around the mercenaries; she’s learning, just as quickly as he did it seems, that the group is fairly harmless unless it’s towards each other.
we?’ Sam asks, looking out the window. The rest of the team have gathered behind the pilot seats, peering out curiously at the looming structure in front of them. Tony feels so tense he’s waiting for every tendon in his body to snap.
Deadpool freezes. ‘Uh, you’d really rather it stayed covering my face.’
‘Since when?’
‘Ah screw you,’ Bucky gives him a playful shove. ‘Come on Scrooge. Trust me you don’t want an excitable Spider-Man coming to find you. No amount of training can prepare you for that.’
Frustrated he lets it fall onto the table in front of him and leans back on the sofa, hand automatically reaching out for a glass, before remembering that he hasn’t poured himself a drink. He’d told himself he couldn’t until he’d made the call.
. ‘There’s one more thing we need to do though.’
(See the end of the chapter for
Sam huffs a laugh as they see the two soldiers wrestling on the ground. ‘Hey, Nat? You see what I see?’ The two soldiers have stopped before the finish line and they’re fighting as to who will get there first.
‘Why don’t I take Loki?’ she suggests, taking Thor’s brother from him, ‘and you can see your friends and tend to our people.’
‘I thought you were going to tell us if it got worse,’ Bucky demands, looking down at Peter, his voice still deadly, as was the look in his eyes.
‘You never cease to amaze me you know that?’ the love in his blue eyes makes Tony a little dizzy, so he just kisses him in response. ‘Now I think it’s time for your present,’ Steve grins, sitting up again and reaching over to his bedside table to pull a box from his drawer.
Tony waves him off as he heads towards the bar. ‘Long day,’ he says. ‘Man I need a drink. Anyone else want one?’ he offers as he pulls out glasses and a bottle of whiskey. Steve shakes his head but the others nod.
‘Don’t you worry we’re putting the super soldiers on him,’ Sam laughs, ‘they’re the only ones who’ll be able to help if he falls over anyway. You’ve got me, and Tony’s got Bruce. Mainly because Hulk likes Tony so if Bruce Hulk’s out Tony’s safest.’
‘Lead the way, Vis. Clint you ok here?’
‘Who said they was Strange’s orders?’
‘Right I’m getting bored. You’re taking too long to tell me the evil plan. Let’s skip to the fun part: where I get to hear it between your screams of pain.’
‘Wait, you’re cooking?’ Steve asks. ‘What do you mean it’s your turn?’
‘Ten seconds,’ she tells him, ‘eight…seven…’
Wade laughs and presses a kiss to his lips, still grumbling Peter tries to hide his smile with a frown. ‘Of course you encourage them by existing. Didn’t old Tin Can encourage
As always here's your sneak peek:
Still laughing Wade picks him up and sits him on the desk, moving to stand between his legs and pulls him back into a hug where he’s now tall enough for his head to rest on Wade’s shoulder. ‘I couldn’t resist.’
He smiles and takes the offered hand. ‘Peter Parker.’ She feels a twinge in her heart at the familiar first name with such an unfamiliar face, and wonders briefly what her brother would have made of this guy. When he releases her hand they continue walking and he becomes serious again. ‘There’s seven more of them, all but one are wearing those bomb vests. They were all with the hostages when I left. My mask is in my rucksack halfway down the seats; if we can get it I’ll be a lot more help. Mr Stark wants me to keep my identity hidden as long as possible. If we can get close enough I can web it, but they’re quite likely to notice so we’ll lose the element of surprise.’
‘My guess is it’s those two idiots wrestling again,’ she replies and as they round the last corner she eases back. ‘Yeah, why am I not surprised?’
‘I can see where she’s coming from, all of his, shall we say less than genius ideas, all came about after something traumatic happened.’
‘Vis,’ Tony says in warning.
‘Oh stop your fucking pity party. He forgave you. Made that very clear. You’re just scared is what it is. It’s much easier for you to flirt and dance around commitment, like you always used to before the war, to feel like you used to before all the bad shit happened, but you’re scared of letting anyone get close enough to see the scars that got left behind from everything you went through.’
even consider that relationship I mentioned.’
Wanda bursts out laughing and stands up. ‘Oh no. You’re getting nothing from me, Cap,’ she says, and tugs Vision out of the room.
‘Sure, Tony,’ she says.
‘But anyway, it got broke and he just put it away. So I thought: hey I know some smart people, I’ll see if Negasonic Teenage Warhead can fix it.’
‘He can’t seriously think I’m going to run off with half the team again,’ Steve’s incredulous.
It’s a harsh laugh that scrapes past the inventor’s lips. ‘But you could in Siberia?’
First though, he needs to knock Bucky’s punk ass into the floor.
, he grumbles under his breath. Sitting forwards again and running his hands over his face.
‘Hey is it time for Hallowe’en already?’ the merc asks as they take in the stranger. ‘Did I miss like half a year or something?’
‘Well I take it I should join the other team to make things even?’ Vision says, returning from where he’s been helping Rhodes to set up the goals.
Loki sighs. ‘You’re lucky you’re my favourite Avenger.’
‘How many more times?’ Valkyrie roars from the other end of the table where she’s sitting opposite Thor. ‘We are not doing the poxy opening dance because I flat out
‘I don’t really have much of a fucking choice do I?’
‘You expect me to give away our grand plan?’ the leader sneers.
Natasha sighs. ‘Sam it’s barely been half an hour, and we’ve been busy getting things sorted in that time. Please don’t be difficult.’
‘Tony still not forgiven him for the last explosion I take it?’ Bucky leans next to him, handing him a mug of something hot.
‘I love you.’ Steve repeats. ‘What’s the other condition?’
‘You sure you’re ready for this, Tony?’ Rhodes asks, keeping his gaze fixed on the aircraft.
‘-Mantis, Quill and Nebula. Should do them for anyone else we’re inviting?’ Wanda finishes.
‘One minute and I’ll be there,’ she promises, deciding to throw some caution to the wind and go for speed. She races along the corridors, her mind going to the flash drive tucked safely in her belt.
‘Oh come on now we need more information,’ Sam says, putting his cutlery down, and Steve gives him and Bucky his best ‘Captain America’ stare, but it doesn’t faze them one bit. ‘Is she cute? Is there just one? It’s not a crazy cat lady is it?’
Peter struggles to his hand and knees from where he’s fallen against the wall. He’s learned a very important lesson today: Bucky has always held back in a fight since he stopped being the Winter Soldier. If it weren’t for his spidey-senses he’d be dead. He’s also struggling to fight his friend properly, not wanting to hurt him even though it’s obvious that Bucky currently doesn’t have any issues with doing the same.
‘What do you want me to do?’ Tony asks, raising an eyebrow, still apparently unconcerned at the gun in his face.
‘Could they do that?’ Bucky asks.
‘You need help?’
‘Good thinking,’ Sam tells him. ‘You want some pain killers?’
‘My name is Lorena, my king,’ the female answers.
‘Not overly well,’ Tony admits. ‘He didn’t come to visit as often as the others, but when he did we always got up to some hair-brained scheme that he’d come up with. Mom caught him teaching me how to make things explode once and nearly threw him out the house, luckily Dum Dum was there to charm her and calm her down otherwise I don’t think he ever would have been let back in the house again.’
‘Unfortunately, not,’ is the reply. ‘Otherwise, I would have done so already.’
Thor laughs and holds his hands up in surrender.
Before Bucky can respond the link is firmly shut, giving him a sharp pain in the side of his head. ‘Ow,’ he grumbles. ‘Bastard’s on his way,’ he tells the other two, throwing his bag into the trunk and then slipping into the backseat. Tony’s already in the driver’s seat and Steve’s waiting by the trunk for Loki to appear.
‘You alright, kid?’
Tony raises an eyebrow. ‘You could beat his punk ass any day, that’s no excuse for you to be eating on the ceiling.’
Now where the fuck am I going to start with summarising all the shit that happened in – what did she call the damn thing? Oh yeah! ‘Another Chance’. What a shit name. Mind you not like ‘HYDRA Rising’ is any better. Spoiler much?
‘I’m pretty sure that’s
‘I really don’t think he’s going to be considered cool,’ MJ scoffs, ‘this is Peter we’re talking about.’
‘I don’t speak Old Norse, Pete,’ Tony rolls his eyes, ‘or read it, you’d have to ask one of the-’
‘Aww but I like that one!’
‘She says she’s playing lifeguard until she’s finished reading some reports,’ Sam replies. ‘Then she’s going to, and I quote: have us drowning in our own tears of frustration.’
‘Apparently so. Or at least tonight they are,’ Peter sighs. ‘Even Karen can only pick up domestic call outs on the police scanners, and my spidey senses are saying everything is boring.’
‘Peter?’ Wanda comes over with a small smile on her face. ‘I just got you a little something extra.’ She looks a little nervous as she hands him a small box.
‘And now you hurt because of it. Even
‘Nope. I never met the guy before personally, and I haven’t mentioned to him how well I used to know his grandfather. But yeah, small world right?’
much.’
‘Well,’ Steve nods in the direction of the trees where a tall figure has just emerged, a spear in their hand, behind them begins to appear the army, ‘looks like they’ve arrived.’
‘Where is he?’ Tony asks as Steve joins them, tightening the straps on his shield.
‘Sorry!’ he yelps, dropping Peter so quickly the teen struggles to keep his feet.
Hope you are all getting into the Christmas spirit and are slightly more prepared present-wise than I am!
‘That’s why he’s collecting them now; and he appears to have a gauntlet that is able to contain their power,’ Loki finishes.
As I've said in the final chapter of Tales From The Training Room I'll be taking a very short break from the Another Chance series just so I can write some other things and stop the series from getting stale. I've had so many lovely messages from people saying they hope I'm not leaving this series and I promise you I'm not. I've already written a separate IronStrange one-shot I shall post in the next few weeks, then I have a request I'm going to write, and then I'll be back on the next instalment of Another Chance. Basically I'll just be taking longer breaks before starting each new instalment of the series whilst I write something non related. If you do have any requests for any pairings or scenarios with any of the characters please do let me know. There's already a list on Tales From The Training Room so head on over there and see what might be coming up!
‘I’m…I’m Spider-Man.’
‘He always been like that?’ Rhodes asks.
‘Shit is so going to go south, Deadpool,’ he says, pulling the mask back on. ‘But hey you’ve been in worse shit storms.’ He goes to his room, making sure to take out the DVD from the television as he passes it.
Despite his previous scare, or maybe because of it, Tony bursts out laughing. ‘Kid, I may be made of bricks but you certainly aren’t. You trying to break every bone in your body?’ Steve pulls him to his feet as Bucky scores.
‘You’re welcome, Baby Spider.’
‘You- I- I can’t- I need to get the fuck out,’ before Peter can say anything Wade has pushed away from the table and all but run out of the restaurant.
1991,’ he answers. He’d stayed long enough after the accident to pack what he wanted and then left. Locked the door and hadn’t been back since.
‘Get rid of this lieutenant, same as the other one,’ Steve says, ‘then we need to get back to the facility and work out how to keep us all safe while we see where Thanos is going to strike next.’
those people died.’
Loki grins and turns to face the speaker from where he’s leaning against the balcony rail looking out over the grounds of the facility. ‘Don’t you think if I were hiding from Thor I would have chosen somewhere he couldn’t go? Such as the labs?’
is putting him off during this presentation. He’s already nervous as hell and doesn’t need any of you making it worse.’
Steve shrugs. ‘I just…they were some of our closest friends, Buck, I feel bad not knowing some of this most basic stuff about where their lives went except from the slim reports that Fury gave me when I first woke up.’
‘Oh come on it smells so good in here I had to try something!’
‘Shit,’ Bucky breathes.
‘What’s your name?’ Steve asks.
Love always,
Vision looks at the woman in the seat next him and finally understands why the rest of the team get so nervous around their respective partners. The ballet is coming to a close but Wanda is still completely enthralled by the display on the stage, but Vision can feel the small box in his pocket pressing against his side and, if he was capable of it, he’s sure he’d be sweating.
Peter nods and smiles and races upstairs to go see the new arrival, nearly sending Steve flying in his excitement and calling an apology over his shoulder.
‘Yeah, just didn’t eat enough at lunch. I’ll be fine,’ he reassures his friend. Harry reaches into his bag and passes him an apple.
‘Next our only female Avenger to be starting off the dancing tonight, the Black Widow: Natasha Romanoff.’ Steve watches Natasha all but glide across the floor, her long black dress dragging slightly behind her. ‘And last but not least, our country’s finest, Captain America himself: Captain Steve Rogers.’
‘Just because we won’t be anything more than friends doesn’t mean I’m going to stop trying to look after you. Not after everything you’ve done for me.’
‘Can you blame her?’ Steve asks, eyebrow raised.
‘No I wasn’t old enough to swing the axe myself as a kid before I left, and Mom was always a bit worried I’d want to and get carried away if I went to get it so my grandfather always went to get ours,’ he answers.
Steve looks from Loki’s shocked face to the four Jotun in the cave entrance, nudging Bucky over to their two friends.
signature behind it and I just…if he
‘Not that it isn’t nice to see you,’ Sam interrupts. ‘But what brings you to our neck of the woods?’
‘I’m on it,’ Wanda says.
‘His fault,’ Natasha points at Fury.
A/N: Hi everyone, hope you enjoy this chapter. I apologise profusely.
‘It tastes better than marzipan,’ Sam says, licking his fingers clean.
‘I’m certain that is an impossibility,’ comes the smooth reply as MJ and Ned head to the counter.
‘You and Nakia seem to have become very close,’ he smiles.
Loki smiles. ‘I’m glad. It’s a copy of something from Asgard I had made on travel along the hidden paths of the universe, something that I personally found particularly useful and I thought he would find it interesting. Though if he attempts anything from there before he is ready I shall have his head.’
As Tony passes Peter on his way back up he ruffles the teenager’s hair. ‘Hey kid? I think he’s learned his lesson. How about you get him out of the webs before he starts ripping down the wall?’
‘I bought basically
‘Speed, Steve, we need speed right now. We don’t even know for sure it is Thanos yet.’
‘Maybe when we can actually be a bit more…open though,’ he sighs, hoping the sunglasses do a good enough job of hiding the disappointment he’s feeling.
‘Oh come on Buck you know you deserved that,’ Steve laughs, ‘you’re just sore because you know FRIDAY’s going to have recorded it.’
Peter lets the corners of his mouth lift up a little at that. ‘I’m sorry I shouted at you,’ he says quietly. ‘I just…it took me by surprise and freaked me out.’
‘Because I was under the hope that the fair lady MJ would accompany us and provide me with some solace during this trial.’
‘Mr Wilson? Miss Maximoff would like me to tell you that if you call her abilities ‘freaky mind powers’ again she will make it so you cannot speak for an entire twenty-four hours,’ FRIDAY’s voice intrudes into their moment. ‘She also wants me to tell you to stop panicking, Mr Parker, and to stop overthinking. For one thing you are giving her a headache, and for another she wants to remind you no one is going to slip up outside of the private rooms. She’d also like you to know that you are thinking louder than the boss does, and she would like some sleep at some point tonight.’
‘Will webs work?’ another voice laughs and they turn around to see Peter and Sam joining them.
‘I have missed you,’ Loki admits, not taking his eyes from the figurine, ‘I didn’t want to admit it at first, but fighting together against Thanos, and spending time with this team of misfits made me realise how much I did miss you whilst I was travelling.’
‘Maybe I’m just hoping I can bury you under enough stuff that you can’t come back and haunt me again, Wade,’ Francis taunts him, spinning two axes in his hands.
with Deadpool and the drug dealers. He’s been so distracted since then he may have been slipping a bit with his homework. ‘I’m really sorry Mr Wheeler, I must have done it in another book and left it at home.’
I'd also be interested to see where everyone thinks we might be going with this series. Do leave your predictions, you never know you might give me some inspiration for a different track!
‘Exactly what it sounds like, Widow,’ Wade says, ‘the fuckers have got people down here they’ve been experimenting on. Some of them aren’t in great shape either. If we don’t get them out they’re staying on this one way train to the pearly gates.’
‘Yes, but we’re making them to eat later not straight away. We have to bake these first,’ Wanda tells her.
to not have to hide that I just freaked out a bit. Thinking about everything that I won’t be able to do or say while they’re here, and the fact that
‘There’s a reason that Steve, Nat and Wanda are the ones to go with Tony, kid,’ Rhodes had explained to him. ‘This shouldn’t be too dangerous, and Ross only wants a small group to go, so Tony’s taken two of the Avengers who were most prolific on the opposite side of the Accords situation to show the Council and the public that we’re all able to work as a team again. Wanda’s gone because they need her fire power, and so she can show everyone the control she has on her powers again. If he’d taken me or Vision with him there would still be murmurs that he doesn’t trust the others properly, that’s why we’re there. It’d be even worse if he took in an unofficial member of the Avengers in as well. Tony’s having to use every opportunity to make a PR statement without being too obvious about it.’
‘Why do I get the feeling you’re hiding from your brother?’
‘It’s Hammer,’ he finally gets his voice to work. ‘Hammer got out of the prison.’
‘Any ideas for yours yet?’ the metal-armed man asks, pointing to the clay in the tricksters hands.
‘I still don’t fully know what’s going on Wade,’ Steve fixes him with a hard look, ‘and I’m trusting you with the lives of two of my best friends. Don’t make me regret it.’
Jotunheim shall fall upon them.’
‘See what I mean?’ Tony ignores his boyfriend and says to the teenager, who tries his best to hide his smile by ducking his head. ‘I’ll be fine, honey, now let’s go make sure Thor and Bruce are alright.’
‘I have to,’ he croaks out.
Natasha pauses for a moment, then forces herself to speak. ‘Can we not go to the facility?’
‘Comforting,’ Tony rolls his eyes, ‘good thing you were a brain surgeon and not a shrink or you’d have been shit at your job.’ He sighs. ‘Avengers? We need to collect the stones. I’ve got the Mind Stone on my gauntlet. Anyone else got eyes on a stone?’
There’s a brief silence, then there’s a hand on his arm. ‘Steve look at me, please.’ Steve does as Tony asks him. This close Steve can see there’s flecks of gold in the dark eyes, and they are looking at him with an intensity that makes Steve want to believe anything that comes out of his mouth. ‘I swear to you I had no idea this is what was happening, I honestly believed everything was alright with your friend. I also swear to you that I shall get this sorted out and your friend
Please do let me know what you think of this chapter, I really do appreciate hearing what you think about what is working and what isn't (even if I am being terrible at responding!)
‘I hate you,’ Steve groans, burying his head in his hands again and trying to block out Bucky’s sniggers. Though he doesn’t try that hard. It’s good to hear him laughing again.
‘Like you did all the way through this you mean?’
‘Oh piss off, Sam.’
‘Nat’s not going to go. She’ll scare the therapist.’
‘Tony I’m not sure that’s-’
‘Uh…Wanda can you-?’
‘Could that actually happen?’
‘You wouldn’t-’
‘Mr Stark! Mr Stark do you feel that this may be some form of karma for all the people that were killed with your weapons from your time-’
‘Rhodey’s on the phone to Pepper now,’ he nods. ‘I just got off the phone to T’Challa. He’s told us to let him know if we need help; he’s got Shuri heading over on standby to stay at the local outreach centre. He was going to come over with her to the facility, but I told him to hold fire for now. We don’t need Ross trying to get hold of him when we’re not sure where Tony is yet.’
Tony pulls him into his side into a one-armed hug. ‘He really got into your head, didn’t he?’
Peter gives him a small smile. ‘I’d appreciate it if I could wait.’
Loki snorts from behind him, the only one of them not wearing a coat. ‘I agree wholeheartedly.’
‘He tried convincing me the Star Wars prequels were not a travesty to mankind. Get him out of the room.’
Tony is quiet before he replies, eyes never leaving the two soldiers training in front of them. ‘We kissed in the lab before you all came back. I’ll admit, Nat, I was tempted to start something with him then, but it wouldn’t have been fair on him. I felt like I was cheating on Steve, even though nothing was happening between us and I didn’t know if anything ever would. I had to move on from Steve before I could see if anything could happen with Bucky. So no, nothing really happened.’ Out of the corner of his eye he sees the woman start to say something a couple of times and then decide against it. ‘Come on, Widow, I know there’s something else you want to ask.’
‘If you do speak to Wong and he can organise a portal for you to save time,’ Strange turns to Sam. The other man simply nods in thanks. ‘I take it that means you and Peter are accompanying me?’
‘Yeah a name
Peter pauses. He knows he shouldn’t. He knows he should keep going. Tony doesn’t have long. But for just one second he considers it.
‘Stop doing that!’ the dark haired man roars, glaring at the smirking god of mischief sitting at the breakfast bar. ‘He’s bad enough as it is without you encouraging him!’
Peter watches as the merc leads his best friend to the nearest stair well and up to safety. ‘Karen? Patch me in to comms.’
‘My apologies,’ Thor looks sheepish. ‘Is there any of the sharing mead left?’
‘It wasn’t all bad,’ Tony says into the quiet that follows, walking half in a trance through the room towards the piano. The last time he’d seen his mother she’d been playing it. ‘It was just…’ he struggles to find the right word. ‘It was
Natasha opens the door and nods for Tony to go in; Steve drops the arm that has been around his waist and presses a kiss to his forehead. ‘I’m right outside if you need me,’ he reminds him.
He wonders.
‘It’s not the fact that we made the weapons that makes it hard for me to sleep at night now, it’s the fact that I
Peter nods. ‘I hope so. I think they’d get on really well.’ He gives the man a smile and sits up. ‘Thanks, Sam.’
‘Breathe with me, Tony,’ Steve’s voice says from behind him, the vibrations from his chest seeping through his back. ‘In. Out. In. Out.’ Feeling the chest behind him rising and falling in sync with the words helps Tony follow the instructions. Slowly he starts to relax. His body begins to tremble as he does. Gradually Steve’s hold becomes less of a restraint and more of a hug, keeping him grounded.
‘Come on, punk, let’s see how many more times I can knock you on your ass.’
‘And the Avengers will host it? So it’ll be us raising the money for charities?’ Sam asks. ‘What charity is it for?’
‘I’m not sure the rest of the superhero gang is going to be happy to see me.’
‘Excuse me? Who died and made you my mother?’
‘Well the stone’s power had always been controlled with Loki’s sceptre before right?’ Peter says, pushing away from where he’s leaning against the table and walking forwards. ‘So what if Ultron thought he had to find a way to control the stone without the stone controlling the new body he was creating and
‘He’s inside the bridge, boss, I think Beck might be in there too.’
‘Hey!’ he turns round to see a grinning Wade.
‘Looks like our luck is changing,’ Natasha smiles.
‘Alright who’s going to help me finish off the dinner this year?’ Mama Rhodes asks as she stands up from the sofa.
‘We need to find out what they want,’ Steve reminds her. ‘Why did they wait until now? Why not when they had Bucky and Wanda?’
Two weeks after their late night chat finds Tony and Bucky lounging on the sofas of the common area with Rhodes; the latter two are nursing beers, but Tony’s being sensible and sticking with soft drinks.
Tony sends a quick text to May to let her know that Peter was on the roof and they were talking him back down into his room. ‘What’s this you were saying about Wade, Pete?’
‘I can’t believe you talked me into this,’ Peter grumbles as he opens the door to Sister Margaret’s.
‘Get your boyfriend to protect your popcorn, he’s generally good at not letting stuff near you,’ Tony ignores Bucky’s grumbling.
‘That’s better,’ he gives the teen a smile. ‘And secondly? The only person who thinks you have anything to prove to Tony is you. Everyone else can see he thinks the world of you, Peter; and just because he may snap at you when he’s caught up in a situation like that, or because the two of you might have a disagreement about something, or maybe because you get a detention,’ he shoots him a grin at the last one and Peter blushes bright red, ‘isn’t going to change that. He’ll be more upset if you just go along with something because you think it’s what he wants. The important thing about any relationship, whether it’s with a friend, family member, mentor or partner, isn’t that you never disagree, it’s what you do afterwards. Just look at the Avengers. You were there when we all had the mother of all disagreements, but we’re back together now aren’t we?’
‘I’m trying…wait, Peter’s back in control, boss, he’s cancelling the orders for EDITH to strike.’
‘He did
‘You know how to box?’
‘Wade focus,’ Natasha rolls her eyes with a smile.
He smiles at her, fighting back traitorous tears at her words. ‘Don’t you worry, Mama, a lot of them will be gone with a couple of conversations I’m having today.’
Tony looks down at Vision’s lifeless body. He had already guessed that. ‘How many more of us, doc?’
‘No it’s a travesty.’
‘I think it’s time we got back to the courtroom,’ Wanda cuts through any responses. ‘Wade get your ass back on your roof.’
It feels like it takes an hour, but it can’t be much more than ten minutes, before the debris are safely deposited in the park and she is sitting on a bench trying to catch her breath when the emergency services arrive. Pedestrians they managed to get out of the way of the falling building are coming over to thank them, some have brought them both food and drink to try and help give them back some energy. Vision diverts the police from asking her questions, sensing her tiredness, and fields all the questions himself.
‘Why? So you can wallow in more self-pity? Dark and brooding only works for so long, mate, otherwise Buffy would have stayed with Angel.’
‘Of course,’ Peter puts on his best smile. ‘I’ll speak to you later, old sister.’
‘Didn’t want him to be the one to make me wrong about giving you that gun,’ he croaks, before his eyes slip closed again.
‘Well it might not be a bad idea,’ Strange muses, ‘for us to be able to practise fighting against other abilities. It would also help us to learn more about each other’s skill sets, and to test our own against strong fighters.’
‘Is he talking about the situation or my face?’ Wade asks Peter.
‘Roger that, Captain,’ Tony salutes and then readies his repulsor blades again. ‘Oh, Squidward is back up. Hey Wong. You hanging in there?’
He’s been down here with quite a few members of the team: Natasha has been his main teacher; he and Tony have come down a couple of times to test out his suit upgrades; Bucky and Steve have both taught him ways to use his strength; even Sam’s brought him down for the occasional session.
‘Yes, sir,’ comes the reply.
So now it was just the group of superheroes that had been left to their own devices. What’s the worst that could happen right?
‘Have they sent any further reports?’
Steve cuts off Tony’s rambling with a kiss, not breaking away fully until the genius is relaxed once more in his arms. It also gives him the opportunity to think.
‘Who else is around?’
‘Any of them?’ Hammer echoes. ‘Or just the intern that’s more a son than an employee? Or the dear Captain who you’ve become more than a little closer to? Or what about the Soldier who so desperately wants your heart?’
‘I’m more worried about me if they find out he’s the one I’m dating,’ he responds.
‘Are you certain you are ready for this?’ Thor asks, looking at his brother worriedly.
‘Bucky where are you?’ he shouts into the comms. ‘You alright?’
‘You don’t seem as enthusiastic as Thor about the celebrations,’ Wanda says tentatively to the trickster.
Peter opens and closes his mouth a couple of times trying to think of a comeback. ‘That’s not the point,’ he says eventually. ‘I only thought about becoming a superhero
, Bruce?’ she asks, defensive as old feelings were fighting their way to the surface. ‘Last I remember you and Hulk decided you were better off alone.’
‘Have one of my beers, Baby Boy,’ Wade throws one that the teenager catches easily, barely turning his head.
As always do let me know if there's anything you'd like to see in the future, or any characters you would like me to try and bring in.
‘Oh you should know not to be so formal by now!’ Mama scolds him, making the other two laugh.
Peter sighs. ‘For the
‘Sam, leave it.’
‘I- thank you,’ Tony says. ‘I could get FRIDAY to send over the scans?’
‘Peter,’ May sighs, and seems to have an internal struggle for a minute. ‘Peter I need you to look at me.’ When he pulls back he can see unshed tears in his aunt’s eyes, and what seems to be guilt swimming in them. ‘We didn’t tell you at the time, we were going to when you broke up for summer because we didn’t want it to affect your school but… Peter, Ben was about to retire from the Force on grounds of ill health.’
‘We were right behind you,’ T’Challa appears next to Nakia. ‘We should get Sam back to our vehicle where we can send him to help. Wanda too.’
Steve confronts his greatest enemy: dancing. Peter runs into an acquaintance and gets a little more than he bargained for.
to be an ally.’ He looks back at Tony. ‘And Loki? You were pretty quick to help him out before we knew he’d been under mind control when we first fought him.’
‘Got some intern stuff tonight, sorry Ned. We could do tomorrow?’
‘Tony? Oh god did I-?’
‘Actually,’ he rubs the back of his neck, ‘I don’t. I mean, if you want to then obviously we will but…I’d rather keep it. If that’s alright with you?’
‘Except Carol of course. And Phil. I was so glad Phil came back. Maybe I should have got Phil to come here, he’s good at cleaning up messes. Always cleaned up after you guys.’
to be here and help you, alright? Now don’t give me time to overthink things. Let’s get started.’ He turns the machine on before anyone can argue with him.
‘What’s borderline mutiny?’ the genius asks, yawning and rubbing his eyes.
‘My dear Agent Romanoff, I thought you were one of the best spies in the world. Please tell me you actually know
‘It’s… it’s someone more from Spider-Man’s life than mine,’ he admits.
‘Tony’s words were along the lines of: we’d have to buy the equivalent of the Amazon rainforest in Christmas trees to stand a chance of denting his bank account, so we’re allowed to go crazy if we like,’ Steve sighs. ‘You ever been to cut down a tree before Quill?’
Everyone laughs and Natasha comes to give him a kiss on the cheek. ‘Just as long as you’re alright. Don’t try and make it a regular thing now, not unless we’re there with you.’
‘But Bucky’s stealing my popcorn!’
‘Well I do miss the hunt,’ she admits, but at the hopeful look on Thor’s face she rolls her eyes. ‘No, Thor, that is not an invitation for you to start convincing everyone to do the hunt.’ Her king pouts, but she ignores him. ‘We also used to do tournaments afterwards, though, as a way for warriors to show how much they’d progressed through the year.’
Still the hands won’t let him go, but now he has air he has more strength to fight back. To save Yinsen. Voices are shouting at him but he gave up trying to understand the words not long after he was taken. He always got the general gist.
‘No, I got rid of that one. Just don’t feel right unless I’ve got a gun under my pillow.’
‘They’re killing themselves,’ Okoye says in disgust, watching as the aliens fall against the powerful shield.
‘-save it, Cap. I don’t want to hear any of it. You left. You
‘Hail HYDRA,’ she grins, and brings the building down on top of them.
Just like last time.
‘My king this is not-’
‘You can’t tell anyone,’ he’s aware his voice is verging on hysterical. ‘
‘You’re not useless to me,’ he tells her, ‘I never had a friend to come back to before, you have no idea how much that’s going to help when I’m in there. I’ve got you to lean on, Wanda, even when you’re not there next to me.’
‘Or did someone forget to tell him?’ he raises a challenging eyebrow. She doesn’t respond, just wears her most innocent expression as footsteps sound at the top of the stairs to the basement.
‘Let me.’
’ Peter groans, walking over to the mercenary and using his strength to pull the man’s hand from his face. ‘Look at me will you! My name is Peter Parker, and I’d love it if you’d spend Christmas with us here, rather than by yourself drinking yourself into a stupor.’
Peter starts up the large staircase, looking at everything on the shelves on the way up as he goes, though he doesn’t dare touch anything for fear of breaking it. ‘Man I can’t wait to ask the Doc what half of this stuff is,’ he mutters to himself. ‘Now,’ he reaches the top and looks along the corridor, ‘at least I don’t have two choices, so straight on it is. Hey, Doc? Doctor Strange, you here? It’s Peter! Peter Parker.’
‘Don’t tempt me,’ Tony laughs. ‘And for god’s sake don’t let Bucky catch you two kissing or you
is good enough for Peter.’
‘What made you change your mind?’
‘Nat! I found him!’ Bucky shouts, grinning down at the merc below him. ‘Nice of you to wait for us, Wade.’
The nurse sniffs, not looking up from her computer screen. ‘Sergeant Barnes got taken up to one of the private suites.’
Loki blinks up at him. ‘Did- did I just hear him correctly?’
‘Peter? What are you doing here already? I thought you weren’t due until after lunch.’
‘Didn’t think I still deserved to do it without checking,’ he replies, and is relieved Tony doesn’t ask as he reaches to turn the water off before helping him stand up again, and helping him out of his underwear before getting him into the tub.
‘He’ll keep coming back until he finally convinces Tony to let him tinker with an old Iron Man suit,’ Rhodes says through a mouthful of spaghetti. ‘Tony you’re never getting out of cooking again.’
Then there’s hands on him, rolling him onto his back. His head is being held by someone and there’s more shouting. His stomach is on fire and it gets worse when he coughs.
‘I’m sorry,’ the merc says, his voice quiet. ‘But I couldn’t let him kill you and I couldn’t let him unmask you, Spidey.’
. I just…I’m scared in case it does.’
‘Um…not wanting to interrupt or anything, but how many trees exactly do we need to take back with us?’ Quill interrupts the already familiar argument.
‘Yibambe!’
Steve throws his hands into the air. ‘Do you know what? I give up! This is exactly what you were like before: you’re so focussed on one thing you can’t listen to anyone.’
‘A fool that saved us,’ Valkyrie points out. ‘Odin knows he’s never going to be my favourite person, but he did try to kill Thanos to protect you.’
‘FRIDAY would you mind letting T’Challa know we shall be in Wakanda soon?’ Steve asks the AI.
Peter pulls her into a one armed hug, putting his own spoon back in the tub. ‘It still feels like you’ve only just lost him doesn’t it?’
‘Sure thing, Mr Stark,’ he says running up the stairs.
Peter feels his face flush red, but tries to hide his embarrassment. ‘Miss Natasha what are you doing here?’
‘Well,’ he chuckles, taking a step back from the dark haired man, ‘in another world, Tony, if Steve had been slower I would have made you mine.’ Just as Tony’s brain processes what he’s said, Loki turns and walks back along the corridor. ‘Goodnight, Tony, and Merry Christmas.’
have a fight with it. Then you’d argue about what the rules would be.’
‘As in Steve Rogers, Captain America?’
‘In my room?’ Tony clarifies. ‘Tonight? I thought you didn’t want to move too fast,’ he teases the blond.
‘So you all ready to give us your big performance, Stevie?’ Bucky grins as he joins him at the wall.
cool-’
He opens one eye and cracks a smirk. ‘Nice get up. You here to save me from the evil government men, Agent Romanoff?’
A/N: Hi everyone, hope you've all had a good week. I think I've finally responded to all your wonderful comments, if I've missed any I am so sorry.
‘Oh no you don’t,’ Sam says, ‘stay down soldier.’
Steve ducks as the seat next to him explodes in gunfire. A figure drops down next to him and he just manages to pull back his punch in time.
A/N: And there you have it ladies and gentlemen: the end of my first Marvel fairytale. I couldn't help add a huge amount of family fluff in at the end. I was on a dog walk and suddenly had the image of Tony telling their fairytale to a little Morgan and Peter and just had to add it.
‘I will, see you later,’ he waves back at her as he walks through the portal Doctor Strange had set up nearly two weeks ago. ‘Woah,’ he says out loud as he takes in the building he’s just walked into. ‘This is awesome.’ He looks around, taking in the large staircase, and the cabinets on all the walls surrounding him. No one had actually been to the Sanctum before so he’d had no idea this is what would greet him.
‘Wade-’ he starts, but can’t speak past the lump in his throat.
‘It’s the man in the big red suit,’ comes an irritated voice from the other side. ‘I’m here about our mutual friend, Deadpool.’
‘Wade…are you…have you been knitting all those extra Christmas sweaters by yourself?’ Peter knows he’s still gaping like a fish, but the sight of the merc, curled up on the bed surrounded by wool and a half finished Ant-Man sweater on his lap is something he’s still trying to make sense of in his mind.
‘Well, Stark I must admit I’m impressed. You weren’t lying when you said the brainwashing wouldn’t work on him anymore,’ Ross’ sneering voice comes through the speakers.
always end up tagging along?’ the man counters.
‘I wouldn’t have called it ‘begging’ exactly. And you needed the help in the end!’ Rhodes replies, offering Bucky a drink.
I'm sorry Vision still died. I hope Wade's reappearance into the story made up for it!
‘Yeah fine, just a tiring day at school you know? Teachers just droning on and on and-’
‘And how come you don’t get brain freeze?’
‘I say we get burgers,’ Peter replies, pulling his own mask back down over his mouth. ‘Or chilli dogs. There’s a great place for chilli dogs not far from here. Race you to the bad guys.’
Bucky laughs. ‘That guy was never going to stop fighting, Stevie, but I think he may have found a way to carry on after he got married.’
‘And here I was told you were polite,’ Tony looks down as Hammer continues, FRIDAY is about sixty percent done. They just need him to continue talking a little longer. ‘I’m guessing the other gentleman is the Winter Soldier? Well now I do know some people who would just
‘Well obviously you haven’t been as much of a jerk to them as you are to me,’ Steve says, trying to keep his friend’s spirits high. ‘Kind of a feat considering you took all the stupid with you.’
Thank you so much to everyone who has left comments and kudos on this story. I did have a review left on another site asking for a double update this week just as I was getting everything ready to post. Now let it never be said I don't give you what you ask for: so here's a double update coming your way!
‘Peggy?’ Steve looks surprised.
‘Drakov’s daughter? The hospital fire?’ Loki feels a sinking feeling in his stomach, something like guilt.
what was going to happen just so he could maintain his stupid air of mystery,’ Tony finishes. ‘What no comment on that one?’ he asks Natasha. She just shrugs in reply.
‘What? Since when did you know Daredevil?’ she demands. ‘We’ve been trying to track him down for months.’
it, Rumlow.’
‘Yes boss.’
Steve laughs and shakes his head. ‘Are we talking difficult as in he’s in a really bad mood and snapping at everyone, or difficult as in he wants to try and make it round every bar in New York in one night?’
, he thinks as he speeds back towards the facility, fairly certain he’s breaking every speeding law in the country.
‘Miss Maximoff agrees with you,’ FRIDAY’s tone is amused, ‘and says she needs enough therapy from the boss’ brain without needing to add anything from yours to the mix. She also says she is glad that for some reason she can never hear Mr Wilson’s thoughts or she’s sure she’d have been sectioned by now.’
She laughs. ‘Sounds good to me.’
Wanda grins and slings an arm around the teenager’s shoulders as he stomps over. ‘Fell right into our trap didn’t he, Nat?’
‘You going to tell me what’s going through your head?’ Steve asks his best friend.
‘Nope,’ Steve laughs from behind him.
‘Please tell me he didn’t insult you to your face,’ Bucky begs.
‘Sorry Mommy Spider,’ Peter teases, ‘but you’re against me and Wade which means you’re going down!’
‘Oh hell no am I letting him beat us!’ Bucky growls, grabbing for Sam’s ankle. The ex-assassin grunts and Sam dodges to the side just as Natasha darts past him to tackle the man on the ground.
‘Captain,’ Strange greets him as he moves further through the group, ‘congratulations.’
‘Hey me and the kid are going to be the dream team when it comes to taking you down, Rogers,’ Bucky laughs, holding his hand out. ‘Bucky Barnes.’
Thor knows he can’t win this fight. The Titan is too strong. But he’s not going to give up and roll over like a coward. So he struggles to hold Stormbreaker away from his chest and snarls at his enemy above him. The blade is just about to pierce his armour when something smacks into the side of Thanos’ head, knocking him off balance, and then flies back the way it came, hitting him on the other side of the head as it does.
‘Anything from the illusions side of Beck’s work that might be able to help us here? Do you think they could fool satellite images?’ Steve asks Tony.
As one the Jotuns send their ice powers forwards, creating a wall of thick ice that spreads out in front of the machines; Bucky can see shimmering light through the wall and knows Loki must be enhancing it with his Asgardian magic. When the machines hit the ice the shockwave can be seen in the strain of the Jotun warriors.
As always here's your sneak peek:
‘Nat,’ a weak voice from his arms has Steve looking down, ‘don’t.’
‘Alright. Heads up, Queens,’ Steve chuckles. The punch he aims, however, goes for his stomach. Peter steps to his right, feeling the soldier lose his balance momentarily before righting himself.
team of Avengers love it if I killed you. So would all these readers!’
‘Nothing can be worse than MJ making us do a horror marathon,’ he counters with a laugh.
‘Something tells me we’re going to be splitting our time tomorrow between cleaning and investigating,’ Wade says, running a finger along the table and holding it up for everyone to see. ‘Because I’ve eaten off some questionable surfaces in my time, but I’m drawing the line here, Tin Can.’
‘No,’ the blond replies, coming to lean on the railing next to him, ‘I’m here to see if my best friend is alright.’
‘Aww you know me so well.’
‘I knew it!’ Thor laughs from where he still lies on the ground.
‘No I was totally freaking out when I first met everyone. Like seriously these guys are awesome and they’re the
Loki frowns, considering the offer. ‘Eight.’
‘-but I didn’t think to keep the team out of them. Now we’ve got proof Ross is connected to HYDRA, and who knows how many of the others on the Council as well. I’m sorry,’ he ignores Rhodes’ comment. ‘I’m sorry to all of you that I didn’t see this as a possibility and try and stop it then.’
‘I can’t use my magic,’ Wanda adds, ‘in case that’s of any use?’
‘Natasha, we should hurry,’ Vision urges from further along the corridor.
‘I called in a couple of favours,’ he explains. ‘Well and owe a favour. Those are all areas of high activity with weapons distribution, most probably from HYDRA activity.’
‘I love you too, Pete.’
but I’m not sure I like it.’
‘Can we get back to the dance please?’ Steve cuts across the argument, looking the most uncomfortable Loki has ever seen him.
were going to have the biggest impact even if I didn’t think they were true; I was…I was doing exactly what
‘Tony,’ Steve’s voice breaks through his musing. ‘Stop avoiding the phone call. You’re inviting them round for Christmas not asking for Peter to be involved in a nuclear war.’
‘What the hell Buck?’ he demands, glowering at his friend from the floor.
‘Tony,’ Steve sighs.
doc, I can’t miss Peter giving this presentation.’
‘Meanwhile,’ she mumbles to herself, grinning as she spots the entrance to the main office, and no guards in sight, ‘I’m missing out on all the fun.’
‘Hey guys, your friendly neighbourhood Merc-with-the-mouth here! So Lyri asked me to give you guys an update on what’s happening with the next step in this series. Honestly, writers these days are getting so fucking lazy their characters have got to do their work for them! She says it’s because she’s busy, but I wouldn’t believe her. Oh hang on….’
Tony looks at Steve and grins. ‘Oh yeah… surprise?’
‘You and me both. But Steve when Nat and I were talking to Peter… it scared me how much he feels for Wade. I don’t think
‘It’s our turn to look after him, Pepper,’ Natasha says, handing the woman a tissue which she gratefully accepts.
‘He set it up not long after we all left,’ Wanda’s voice comes from behind him. He turns to look at her, standing next to Vision.
‘I joined the Air Force because of her,’ Sam nods in agreement.
‘I did murder their king,’ Loki points out with a dark smile, ‘and attempted to destroy their world. I would not blame them for wanting to see an end to me.’
The team launch a raid to get Tony back, everything seems to be going well until they run into a familiar face.
‘I know,’ he says quickly. ‘I know, we need to be less direct than would be ideal. I never intended to try and take him out physically. Though I’m sure you and Barnes could manage it between you,’ he says with a half-smile. ‘But all that would do would create a space for another person to step into. One we don’t know quite so well.’
old.’
‘We need a couple more minutes.’
A/N: Hey everyone! So, I really hope you don't hate me for the argument between Peter and Wade? Because I still love you all, especially my reviewers! So yeah, things have kind of come to a head, because we all knew Deadpool was going to kill someone eventually and Spider-Man wasn't going to like it.
Steve’s face falls as he realises what he’s said. ‘Oh god, Tony I didn’t-’
‘Because he started throwing dough in an attempt to start a food fight,’ Sam answers from the other end of the counter where he’s still got a little bit of flour stuck to one eyebrow.
‘Alright all of you stop!’ Tony snaps.
he scolds himself. He feels Loki’s presence pushing at the corner of his mind, but ignores it and stumbles to his feet and follows Natasha.
be if you wanted me to-’
‘What took you so long?’ the man coughs. ‘You stop for drive thru or something?’
‘And stop right there,’ Tony cuts across him, as Wanda’s laughter increases in volume.
‘Aren’t the shops going to be closed by now?’
‘None taken,’ the man responds.
‘You are most welcome,’ he gets a smile in return. ‘Now, how would you like to help me with some of these books? I am doing more research into the Infinity Stones, but I’m afraid I’m on to looking for indirect references now to see if there is anything that might help. As you can imagine it is not as quick as the other research.’
‘Will do, Wade,’ Weasel says, a small grin on his face. ‘By the way you seen the action over at the pool table? There’s a newcomer taking everyone’s money and he pinned Buck to the bar.’
‘Its fine, Captain,’ Vision says, ‘we’ll meet you at the jet.’
‘I’m just hoping we get acknowledged by the team when we arrive, then we get to be as cool as you will be for this entire trip,’ is Ned’s response.
‘Something I could have told them myself,’ the mystic user grumbles.
Steve sighs. ‘Yes.’
‘No it’s fine I’ll speak to her,’ he replies, much happier again. ‘Anyway I’m going to go put my stuff in my room. Be back soon!’
‘I have so many questions’,’ Bucky shakes his head.
‘Um, not really,’ he answers.
‘And Cassie’s alright with not seeing her dad for a bit?’
Tony smiles. ‘Good. Now I’ve got the obligatory ‘Dad’ talk out the way.’
‘No promises,’ he grins and laughs as Steve sweeps him up and carries him to their bathroom.
The girliest screech Tony has ever heard has him banging his head on the bottom of the boiler the next morning.
(See the end of the chapter for
‘You make a new friend?’ he asks the youngster as he joins him where he’s leaning against the bar.
‘Did you manage to contact them?’
‘Feeling worse for having to see what you actually look like,’ Scott responds.
‘It has to be. Thanos used Gamora to get the stone, so there has to be a way we can use the stone to get her back,’ Quill’s voice is almost desperate and Peter unconsciously tightens his grip on Wade’s hand, receiving a reassuring squeeze back. He knows how much it hurt to
‘Not sure that’s a good idea, Tin Can,’ the man responds, holding out his hand, ‘but I appreciate the offer and I’ll consider it.’
Natasha had worried that T’Challa might go on a revenge filled mission like he did when his father was killed, but he had been more subdued this time and had followed Okoye’s suggestions without comment. Something she knew had worried the King’s Guard.
‘May I?’ Loki asks after a few moments of silence, holding his hand out.
‘Peter, sir,’ the kid finally looks up from the floor, and Tony can’t quite place the look in his eyes.
‘Or start creating havoc,’ Wade grins.
“You will be challenging the entire industry,” Lee goes on, “You will become the pediment of entertainment. Think about it.”
He doesn’t have a come-back to that one. None that won’t be akin to a cheesy line in a porno flick that is. So as his laughter dies away and an odd silence fills the room, Steve finds himself dwelling on less amusing topics. Issues that have to be smoothened out if he’s ever going to have peace of mind.
“Doesn’t mean he’s not following up on you,” Pepper informs. She pretends not to notice Tony’s hands slithering around her slender waist.
Steve turns back to glare at him, shrugging his arm out of Tony’s grasp.
He clears his throat.
“So you know what’s expected of you?” Howard says, like Maria is not even there. “No more mishaps.”
“Well according to the column, you were kissing quite a heart-throb.”
Howard grabs the plate out of Tony’s hand again and this time filters the contents into a tiny trashcan in the corner, completely ignoring the look of pain on his son’s face.
Steve doesn’t even skip a beat before he’s pointing an accusing finger at Tony’s
“You wouldn’t have answered.”
“I’m sorry,” Steve chokes out a sobbed chuckle, smiling down at his father.
“You know what? I think I’ll rather just go back to my hotel room”
“Double if you get a few in with Tony.”
“That’s my point exactly. It isn’t true so who the hell cares,” Tony shakes his head. “You haven’t even given the plot a chance, dad. It’s a really great story-line, but the second you hear the word, ‘gay’, your tail goes between your legs.”
That was exactly a month ago to date.
“Yeah, I see,” Rhodey says, shuffling through photos once again. “This is very different from your norm. What made you decide to try out?”
A chance that Howard Stark has no concrete proof. A chance that he can still save Tony.
There’s a soft knock on the door.
“You lost your job?” Brock’s eyes widen slightly.
“Oh no,” Hogan mutters under his breath, his temper and loss of control rising.
“Stark senior not taking it well?”
“You were still gonna get them published?”
As Tony closes the front door, he fights the tiny urge he has to eavesdrop.
“I’ll call that damn good acting then,” Joeseph rests back down again with a chuckle. “And its Joe to you, son. Haven’t heard enough about you,” he looks at his son, “I’m hoping that’s gonna change.”
Tony notices how the spiky-haired man makes every order sound like a question. Of course he can look down and turn left and raise his head. He keeps himself amused by this since the more he thinks about it, the less sense it makes.
He’s exhausted, bones subtly aching, but mainly just exhausted by Tony Stark.
As he thinks about it, he’s not so sure that it’s something he should be proud of. Especially not with the way his head was still spinning.
The drawn out curse, the focused controlled breathing, the way Tony’s entrance rejects the intrusion has Steve thinking his assumptions just might be entirely accurate.
Now, Steve is seething when a stack of folders are placed on his desk exactly ten minutes before he’s about to pack up and head out for TGIF drinks with the boys.
“Tony,” she scolds, “We’re almost there.”
“Don’t you dare compare me to that man,” Hogan states sharply and Pepper can tell that she’s actually offended him. “I’m nothing like him. You weren’t there from the beginning - I was. I was the one who got him to school every morning, who made sure he was okay. I sat through all his troubles and listened to his girl problems when he hit puberty. I’ve always been there.”
Sharon Hendricks scoffs.
Only Steve. Nobody else.
Disappointed by her reply, but hardly shocked, Hogan rolls onto his back and stares up at the ceiling.
“Yeah,” he says before hitting the phone against his head and then immediately regretting it.
“Yeah,” Tony finally lets Steve go to press the button for the ground floor. “Weren’t you listening to Mr. Lee? The premier for
Tony Stark managed to work himself up so much that night that the next morning, an incredibly bewildered Pepper got it handed to her when she merely mentioned the name, Steve.
Tony looks around at no one in particular, feeling slightly uncomfortable for Steve once again.
“Technically, I wasn’t driving,” Hogan says carefully, cowering under Howard’s icy glare.
Tony Stark peers into the empty room. The vicinity that had once held Steve Rogers’s belongings now looks like just another hotel room. The luggage is gone, the gifts are nowhere in sight. All that’s left is a dedicated maid and hotel furniture.
They all look at each other once Thor Odinson leaves the room.
“I was talking about Mr. Rogers here,” Harold had corrected without skipping a beat. Without noticing Tony’s eyes darken and narrow and fix solely on Steve as if they were the only two people in the entire 30-story building. “If you need anything at all, he’s your guy.”
“When you start making the right decisions.”
And this time Tony does laugh and Steve can’t help but do the same, even though their hands are still clasped and his boss’s lips look so inviting in that curve that Steve can actually taste them.
“Finally, someone with some sense,” Steve laughs, suddenly a lot more comfortable and undoubtedly due to the fact that he thinks that someone actually shares his view. “They’re just shoving how better their lives are in our faces and people actually buy into it.”
“Aren’t you cute,” Sharon struggles to mask her amusement, while she inwardly does cartwheels.”
The studio is packed, not a single empty seat in the house. Tons of eager fans sit cheering, not listening to what the talk show host is rambling on about, and none of them really caring what’s being said.
Maria’s seated beside Howard, both parents watching the television gravely.
,” Tony raises a mischievous brow. “So what, like, you’re only gay on weekends or something?”
, Hogan thinks, with a shake of his head.
Steve’s shorts drop to the ground and he steps out of them, dark boxer briefs fitting him like a second skin.
He misses home.
“And what’s happening in this picture?” Howard continues as if he is preaching to a second grader.
Deciding against thinking such, Tony looks down at what he has. Looks at what he isn’t prepared to lose. It makes him brave.
Hogan hits the pause button and the room becomes silent. All eyes fall on Tony.
“I’ll give you a call some time,” Sharon says dismissively, placing his portfolio aside before sorting through her own papers.
Steve’s suddenly wracking his brain to remember what Tony had told him about a Natasha.
“Oh,” Ms. Wanda raises her brows, looking behind Steve as he enters the kitchen, “Bucky not staying for Dinner? How tragic.”
The kissing was great; Steve wouldn’t begin to deny that. But the affection was way better. The way Tony had literally just laid in his arms. Steve under the covers and Tony on top. The bridge keeping a level of innocence between them.
Steve moves gently, resting his head on Tony’s shoulder and draping an arm over his chest as he tangled their legs together perfectly.
Usually, Lee would find amusement in Tony’s focused sarcasm, but not at this moment. He can’t even bring himself to try.
Tony grins with a low half snort half chuckle as he continues to kiss Steve’s collarbone.
“Well, Bucky, I lied,” Steve balances his cargo onehandedly as he glides the little piece of plastic through the employee login and swipe card system for the last time. Within seconds it will be deactivated and Steve will no longer be permitted into the Stark’s Industries building at will. A year ago this would’ve been the happiest moment of Steve’s life. Far too much has changed in a year. “This is hardly the first time a man has lied about his true feelings in order to keep his emotions guarded.”
It all feels wrong.
It was useless.
“He’s been stopping by,” his father confesses casually. “He needed my advice on the new ink he wants. It’s a good thing he came to me too because what he’d had in mind-” Steve’s farther makes a gagging sound that would’ve usually made Steve laugh were Joseph speaking about anyone other than James Bucky Barnes.
“Would you calm down and stop drawing so much damn attention to yourself,” Tony stands too. He reaches for Steve’s arm to stop him from walking down the narrow aisle towards the exit doors.
Tony isn’t about to blow his cover just yet, not when he can see amusement brewing in the oblivion outlining the situation.
“And I suppose the money you rake in on account of  his fame has absolutely nothing to do with it.” Brock grins.
“Don’t you dare say perfect,” Bucky scolds like a mother at wits end.
It happens really quickly and unexpectedly. Tony is able to clumsily get to his feet just before his father can get to him. His father has never hit him before; Tony’s never had to worry about it in the least. But something feels different in those few seconds and all Tony can do is get ready to defend himself.
?” Tony interrupts with a smirk.
The red-haired, red lipped, red horned Vixen of gossip on television. She lives off of the blunders of celebrities, preys on their every flaw. She steals their secrets and stirs them with her pitchfork after adding her own spices, generously dishing out mounds of it to starving, worshiping fans who seem to lick their bowls thoroughly clean every time.
When he opens the docket, the headshots that follow make his heart race. Breathtaking in their simplicity, portraying Steve exactly how Tony remembers him.
“I thought I was being thrown in on the deep end alone.” She continues, “Howard sounded really pissed on the phone.”
Steve concentrates on Tony’s ear, delighting in the shade of red it turns under his fingertips.
“I had to,” Steve states. “I went to the other spare room. It would’ve been kinda weird if Hogan or Pepper found us in the same bed when there are half a dozen other ones in the house.”
The cold shoulder was annoying him, but he also realized he wasn’t making much of an effort to reconcile with the boy either. Mostly because he didn’t know what he would be apologizing for. So what, Steve has feelings for him. It didn’t mean he suddenly owed Steve anything. That he had to return the feelings.
Tony lets out the breath he’s been holding, relaxing the muscles he’s been flexing and rolls his neck until it clicks.
“You let him drive?”
Tony thinks for a while, taking in the audience disappointment. With a tilt of his head and a twinkle in his eye, Tony sits back and clears his throat.
*****
He isn’t sure if it feels more erotic because it’s wrong or it’s wrong because it feels entirely too erotic.
Brock always feels comfort in what he does; reminding himself that it’s the celebrities who put themselves in the situation they’re in in the first place. They chose to be in the spotlight, they made that decision knowing full well what came with fame.
“Let’s just say, thanksgiving never gets boring.”
Once the boy is awake, everything will become real again.
“Natasha,” Tony acknowledges, “anything for my favorite fabricator.”
“Wait, don’t tell me, don’t tell me,” Tony says sarcastically, “I’m in trouble?”
“He told me he was going out with friends,” Pepper lies with a shrug. “I’m certain he’s fine. Just, why don’t you lay off him for a while? Give the kid a chance to actually be a kid. Don’t you think he’s going through enough?”
“Okay,” he relents on a sigh, “but stretch. Keep your bones warm, okay.”
At whom?
you’re talking about,” Tony smiles.
“Uh, no thank you,” the boy smiles nervously, “I’m just waiting for Mr. Lee.”
So what’s different now?
Tony chuckles, diverting his gaze away from the dialogue of the opening scene, long enough to look at himself in the mirror. The elevator walls are lined with mirrors. The lobby is lined with mirrors. Tony knows it’s a clever trick to make rooms appear much larger than they really are, but it is beginning to annoy him.
Tony’s jeans dropped to the ground with a light thump and loud jingle. And Steve can’t decide whether he wants to push Tony away to enjoy the view or keep kissing him. He decides to enjoy the best of worlds, brazenly reaching between their two warm bodies and groping Tony too expertly for Tony to believe that it’s Steve’s first time doing this.
“Gotta give the guy credit for trying,” Tony shrugs.
“Don’t fight me,” Steve encourages softly as a third finger joins his other two, “let me in. Look at me.”
Pepper gives Tony a look. One that makes him laugh. One that says,
Even better - million dollar sequence of shots.
And it’s sort of really lovely to observe. Tony’s eyes sparkling, looking thoroughly content just being there.
“You didn’t let me finish,” Tony accuses with that sarcastic grin that drives Pepper crazy.
Bucky rolls his eyes dramatically and shoots himself in the head with two fingers. He manages to duck behind the barricade just as Mr. Stark turns to see what has Steve so distracted. When Stark looks back at Steve its equivalent to a look that one would give a person caught defecating in the middle of an intersection during rush hour.
Steve goes silent, eyes going wide as he looks at the picture on the coffee mug that’s being handed to him. Looking from the mug to the smiling sender leaves no room for questioning. Sure, the mug does portray a well-groomed young man, with perfectly spiked hair and a bad-ass attitude. And sure, the person standing in front of him looks the complete opposite with his hair all shaggy, dressed like an ordinary kid with a friendliness that matches the intensity of his bright brown eyes. But Tony knows Steve finally sees it.
Tony presses his ear against the door.
“Well what do you know,” she says, “nine fifteen. Take a seat kid.”
Steve’s laughter quickly dies down when a certain look crosses his father’s face. He tenses slightly when Joseph moves his hand to his cheek.
Eventually when his father does pick up the phone, he’s wondering if his call is too much of an inconvenience to even bother going through with it.
Then Tony looks up at him, grin broadening.
“Well, Peggy,” Tony begins after little deliberation, “I’m taking on a role as the gay protagonist in a Marvel Productions film.”
Only this…. this is different.
“When do I ever?” Tony whispers.
Despite Steve’s best effort to look friendly and thirsty and incapable of pouring his own drink, the man behind the bar is unmoving. He isn’t at all a tall man, but the muscles bursting at the seams and chest of his black short sleeved top make him look as though he’d be able to hold his own in a fight against another man twice his size. His arms crossed over his chest don’t only pronounce his muscle further and show off his very intricate tattoo of a hawk, but it also makes him appear standoffish and every bit as though he’s absolutely not intending on catering to a single one of Steve’s requests. Yet somehow, Steve still manages to find his polite voice. Even though the scrunched up look of animosity he’s receiving couldn’t even be done better by a pro wrestler on steroids and cocaine.
“That’s what’s scaring me,” Hogan reaches to grab Tony’s arm again, but Tony’s too quick. “Tony, you should-”
“I gave him the morning off,” Steve says triumphantly as he urges a very sceptical looking Tony towards his breakfast with his hands on the shorter man’s hips.
“Truth be told,” Tony places the DVD back into its slot, “these are all rubbish. What do you say we ditch this place and go make our own?”
On more than one occasion he’d wanted to give up, wondering if it was really worth waiting for. Wondering if the spot he’d chosen to park in was overlooked the wrong side of Tony’s agent’s house. He knew he had the right address; Sharon had called ample times to clarify. But he’d chosen that spot since it was the only place one could look down into the yard and still have ample camouflage.
*****
He remembers the ruckus in the kitchen from when all four of them battled for control over just how much mince should be added or garlic was needed. He remembers the ten minute debate on how bolognaise was not bolognaise without anchovies. Then there was also the short bustle to get mozzarella cheese away from Tony, one which he was still glad he won. Because, all in all, dinner turned out great.
And Steve is torn between thanking the guy and lecturing him on proper customer service etiquette, but the new owner is already disappearing behind a pair of retro swinging doors. But when the doors swing open once again, all debates between gratitude and orations are knocked out of him as hard as the wind from his lungs when he locks eyes with the dark figure that emerges.
“I will do whatever you want,” Tony frowns, “you know this. But the one thing I’m
Steve is only half listening to Tony, not bothering to laugh with him. He’s still hung up on the single word Tony had blurted obliviously.
Hogan purposely refuses to look at it. Tony and Steve, lips locked in front of the world.
“Uh huh,” Pepper says, seeming no more interested than when Tony had begun.
Hogan nods as does Pepper. Usually they would have debated, but something about Howard’s demeanor today makes them both choose against it.
Steve watches Tony drop the remote control onto the couch, clutching the cellphone to his ear with the other hand. He watches Tony walk to the front door. He flinches, snapping out of his trance when Tony shuts the door behind himself.
to listen to me.”
“No, don’t do that,” there’s a mixture of authority and worry in his voice now. “You’re not, Tony. You don’t know what you want. You don’t know what you’re doing.”
“That’s right,” Howard agrees simply, shocking them both. The calm in Howard’s voice is unsettling.
was actually the one aiming high,” Tony grins, staring Bucky right in the eye.
“Right,” Tony sits up in his seat, absolutely loving every second of this, “whose next?”
Stan Lee considers not mentioning anything at all, but that will only be holding off the inevitable. And he knows that if Tony is going to find out from anyone, it should be him.
Not even the knock on the door can remove either boys’ smile, though the intrusion is slightly annoying.
“Ms. Hill,” the assistant says timidly from the door, grabbing everyone’s attention, “Thor Odinson is here.”
“Not young enough for you,” she quips. It’s always hard saying no to Tony. And not just because he’s as gorgeous as he is. Not just because he’s sweet and smooth and downright the only decent guy who’s ever shown any interest in her. There’s a whole list of reasons she has to want to say no to him. Even though it seems harder every time.
“Please, just Steve is fine,” he replies politely. “And yes please, I could use a cup.”
“Hello,” Tony finds his words a second later than he would have liked. It isn’t like the person standing in front of him has bothered speaking either. “I was wondering if Steve Rogers is here.”
Maria Hill, however, is thoroughly involved in what’s going on. Even more so than Rhodey . No one expects any less from Hill. Her ability to find entertainment in the most boring of situations is exactly what makes her one of the best directors in Los Angeles. A vicious rose amongst thorns, having no trouble showing the male-dominant industry exactly how tough she is.
He moans again when Tony’s tongue slides deeper into his mouth, battling his own. Tasting and exploring and introducing Steve to a hunger that he didn’t even know was manifesting in his entirety.
“What are you talking about Mr. Stark?” Natasha chuckles almost evilly. “Everybody only has one.”
“Not unless yearbook pictures count,” Steve chuckles. Then he inwardly curses himself for his own flippancy.
“Way.”
The song could have stopped. Neither could really tell because all else fades away when their lips touch.
“I dunno,” Pepper shrugs, “-to give you a few words of encouragement? To make sure you don’t screw up? The usual.”
“Probably management,” Steve says, moving out of the bed. Tony grabs his wrist to stop him.
“But, it’s not too late to change things,” Howard continues. “We can still get out of this in a way where everyone wins. Like I said Steve, I know what you need. I’ve spoken to Sharon Carter and I
“Slow motab,” Pepper vouches for herself, her slender form making Tony raise a questioning brow. Pepper looks at the make-up artist, expecting contribution; instead, the young lady just huffs and continues to apply more powder to Tony’s already faultless face.
He can’t.
“Please,” he’s slightly taken off guard by the enthusiastic hand grabbing him, ushering him in without room for objection, “Come in. Oh my, can I get you anything.”
“I just got off the phone with Howard,” Pepper says, returning to the kitchen.
In reality, Tony Stark is not simply just the boss anymore, Mr. Stark is also the man that Steve had sex with, showered with, shared plates and sipped bottles with. And he is certain that, to Tony Stark, Steve is just the jackass who walked out on him without saying goodbye, commandeering incriminating evidence that could destroy Stark’s empire in the process.
nervous?” Tony says incredulously, “Hell, I’m pissing my pants here.”
“What does
“I am, aren’t I,” Tony chuckles, wondering why the hell, of late, it sounds like the worst kind of insult.
The crowd goes wild.
She knew she shouldn’t be thinking that, but she can’t help it.
“Come on, Tony,” Steve fakes a frown, “I wanna sleep. Let me go.”
“I mean,” Tony goes on, “is there something wrong with me?”
“Nothing’s wrong,” she assures, putting out her cigarette in the ash tray on her desk, “I’m guessing I know why you’re here.”
Steve feels responsible.
“Is that all Mrs. Romanov?” Tony askes, taking the utmost pride in knowing only a select few celebrities are able to render her speechless like that.
“I’m great, ma’am,” Steve says, forcing a smile into his voice. “Can I speak to my dad?”
And the picture is titillating, Steven concedes as he slowly removes his own pants. It’s ferociously erotic by the sheer illicitness of the camera’s participation in what they’re doing. What Steve is about to do to Tony. What Steve will so eagerly turn around and let Tony do to him.
“Let’s get out of here,” Tony grins down at Steve before placing a kiss on his forehead.
He gratefully accepts the towel he’s offered from an assistant, giving him a thankful smile before wiping off the fake sweat that had been sprayed on him throughout the photoshoot. When he pats his back dry as best he can, Tony tries his best not to ruin the temporary tattoo that’s been plastered onto him.
Tony turns his head further back as he’s instructed to do so. There’s an awkward strain in his neck, but he decides to ignore it. It had been there for almost a week now and he isn’t going to accept it as anything other than a bad night’s sleep. He keeps reminding himself to buy new pillows, but never gets around to it.
‘Steve’s so going to bust your ass for throwing training equipment around.’
Peter turns around and shoves the pillow into a cackling Wade’s face. ‘Remind me why I put up with you.’
Tony smiles and reaches over to squeeze the teen’s hand. ‘I promise. As long as you promise to check in every few days alright? And if you do need anything you call Happy and I’ll make sure he always has his cell on during court time.’
‘Hammer came to Midtown High,’ he explains, cursing when his hands fumble in his bag and only come out with one shooter. ‘Iron Man turned up to help but he’s on his own until I get suited up. There’s soldiers everywhere, I think they want one or both of us. People are going to get hurt. Please Wade.’
He can’t help it, he bursts out laughing. ‘Are you actually
No one talks much as they collect their bags and head down the ramp. Instead of taking them to the front door, Tony leads them around the side.
‘Keep me updated, Tony,’ is the all the response he gets before the line goes dead.
Steve notices a couple of the hands going down and some people looking a little sheepish.
‘Come on, we’ve more weapons at the car,’ Nakia tells her, slinging one of Sam’s arms over her shoulders as Natasha does the same with his other. Between them they manage to duck behind debris and weave their way back to the Wakandan car. ‘Put him inside,’ Nakia says, ‘the glass is bulletproof, it’ll keep him safer. I’ll get the weapons.’
‘You should be freaking out,’ Wade croaks. ‘Why are you not freaking out? I’m going to have to fucking freak out for you!’
‘You do it to everyone as well!’
‘Boss? Captain Rogers is on the phone for you.’
‘You expect me to know every intern that comes through our doors when I’m busy Avenging?’ Tony asks, wishing Wanda would hurry up.
‘What’s that grin for?’
‘You’re just upset you didn’t get to join in,’ he grins, watching the blond out of the corner of his eye and knows he’s guessed right when Steve clears his throat.
‘So,’ Wade says, breaking the silence, ‘I take it Hulk wins?’
‘I thought Mr Stark’s parties were notoriously outrageous and loads of fun? This is boring as hell,’ he says.
‘It’s never been physical before,’ Ned tries to defend him. ‘This was the first time it’s happened,’ he shrinks back as Bucky turns his dark look to him. ‘Well that I’ve seen anyway.’
He convinced May to let Ned stay round the night before, the two of them were up late organising their own version of what Peter had seen at the facility. He’d told Ned the team had worked out that they must be in New York or the general vicinity, and all routes in and out of the city were being monitored so there was no way they’d managed to get him out without their knowing.
A few of them seem to nod in acceptance. ‘Very well, if you do not have any questions or any more concerns, then we can conclude this meeting,’ the British representative says.
‘Yes,’ Tony says, hating the heaviness in his heart as he says that and leads his secretary back into the party.
Shuri bounds out from behind Bruce, a huge grin on her face. ‘My favourite white boy!’
(See the end of the chapter for
‘Hey!’ the archer throws a pillow at Tony which the inventor just side steps out of the way of.
In the end Wanda insisted on escorting Sharon from the premises. Bucky had given him a smile and nod before following them out; whether to give Sharon a piece of his mind, or ensure Wanda let the woman leave in one piece he wasn’t sure.
So next up will be a special, but I won't be posting it for a couple of weeks as I've got some really busy weeks coming up. Do keep an eye out though, it's going to be called 'A Spider's Week Long Interview', and then the proper sequel will be uploaded. Check out the special though, because there'll be some hints as to what's happening in the sequel!
‘In my defence,’ he starts as soon as they enter the workshop, ‘I was going to tell you this afternoon and then we kind of had other worldly visitors ruin the moment.’
Love always,
‘FRI?’
‘I know you like him, you know,’ his voice is quiet but steady as they continue to walk, ‘everyone thinks I’m kind of crap with this stuff but I’m not really. I see the way you look at him, and I see the way he looks at you.’
to go there didn’t you?’ Steve groans from next to him, not even attempting to get the room to calm down.
‘It won’t,’ she tells him, resting her head on his shoulder. ‘Why do you think Pete let Venom go?’ she changes the subject.
‘Nice of you to return to us, Winter Soldier,’ one of them taunts him as they open the door to his cell, ‘we’ve got someone who very much wants to see you again.’
