Tony shrugs and shoves his phone back in his pocket, then goes back to his conversation. Steve keeps circulating, making sure that wherever he is, he can keep an eye on Tony. He wants to be ready to move out when Tony does.
"You always do that," Tony said. Not always on his shoulders; it depended on exactly what they'd done. But Steve always clutched Tony to him just a little too tightly, and Tony never minded.
"I do," Tony said, trying to sound patient, "but I'm still looking for a light source. Also, firewood, a coal stove, something. It's getting colder out there, and the snow's coming down hard." Again, he could use the environmental controls in his suit to keep warm, and Steve would probably be fine as well, but that didn't mean that they should be stupid.
This was actually happening, Steve realized, and felt as though all the awkwardness had drained out of him. There was no need for uncertainty, not any longer.
To be honest, he knew perfectly well where Tony was going with this conversation, but he was going to make Tony work for it.
And Tony wasn't going to stop there. He might as well rip the band-aid off altogether, if he had already potentially destroyed their friendship.
"No. Well, yes, by your standards, but not for me. I wrapped up at around two or so." Tony picked up his mug and frowned into it. "You'd think I'd remember drinking this." He got up and refilled it, took a long drink, and then topped it up before sitting down again.
He could have called Tony simply because Tony was his friend, and Tony probably would have made the time to talk to him. On speakerphone, probably, while he worked, but that would have made it even more like Steve was right there with him.
Steve sighed and ran a hand over his eyes for a moment. "And I should have made sure that you knew what you were apologizing for," he said. "So yes, how about we start that conversation over again."
But instead of Tony brushing him off, or just taking Steve's words as the kind of thing you say to comfort a friend without meaning anything much by them, he said, "So if you miss me, you'll do this again? I mean, I know we'll talk on a regular basis, it's not like you guys can function without my input, but like this. One on one."
car keys, please let me drive as much as possible." He'd have to send the kids out for multiple coffee runs. Totally out of the goodness of his heart, and not because he both wanted coffee and to get the kids out from underfoot.
But as Steve was wearily pulling off his boots--he’d been away from the Tower for a few days, on a mission with SHIELD--JARVIS said, “Mr. Stark is sleepwalking again.”
"He's not a moron, so possibly?" Clint shrugged. "On the other hand, he might have chalked it all up to your being very, very drunk, and not taken it seriously."
"Yes," Tony said, kissing him and then taking his hand to pull him toward the door. "But as long as I'm the only one you show your evil streak to, I think we're good."
It might not be true, but it was still true that Steve might, at some point, be in relationship with a man, and it felt good to know that there were people who would be happy for him.
They dressed quickly--Steve back in his uniform, Tony into his undersuit--and before Tony had time to retrieve his helmet from the other room, a ring of bluish light opened in the room.
Steve did, and started moving inside Tony, slowly and carefully. This time, Tony was the one who reached up, wrapping his arms around Steve and digging his fingers into Steve's back.
"Of course not." Tony was trying. That much was obvious. Even Steve had heard of this restaurant, and when he'd asked JARVIS about it to see what to expect once Tony had told him that was where they were going, he'd discovered that they were booked solid for the next two months.
He was never drinking that much again. Not even if Steve left him and he had to watch Steve from afar, being drooled over by most of Manhattan. Blacking out when you had access to multiple flying suits of armor was an even more terrible idea than Tony was willing to go along with, and he had an affinity for things other people thought were terrible ideas.
So of course, when Steve spent nine days doing nothing but traveling and giving speeches, he was going to miss Tony.
Maybe he was counting on the fact that people would assume he was bisexual, and then after Steve, he could just date women for the rest of his life.
"There are some of you," Steve admitted. Those weren't the reason for the "personal" warning on the first page, though.
They'd been sitting in those same spots for months, long before their pretend relationship had started; that hadn't affected anything in the tower.
Still, Clint had been at the gala last night. He could possibly tell Tony what he'd done to offend Steve.
Steve couldn’t help but laugh. “You know you can come here when you’re not about to pass out from exhaustion, too?”
Tony didn't know the half of it. Those were the kinds of pictures Steve knew he wasn't going to be able to let himself look at, the ones where he and Tony managed to look like a real couple.
"It's not safe here," Steve said. "You really should leave the area. Even now, there might be something that we missed, or structural damage to the buildings--"
Then he gripped the edge of the table as the room swayed around him. He really hadn't been drinking much lately, had he? He'd completely misjudged his tolerance.
He soaked and wrung out a couple more washcloths, then hung a towel over his shoulder before coming back out into the lab.
"Not unless you want to," Steve said. "I thought I'd help out." The washcloths were already cooling; Steve refolded them to get the warmest parts on the surface, and then started dabbing at Tony's skin.
"So you're fine with this. You're fine with people thinking we're together? The team will know better, obviously, but I don't think we should tell anyone else. What if Pepper--"
The STRIKE team had been sent to South America, so August was in the middle of winter. The weather was chilly, wet, and dismal, a perfect match to Steve's mood. The mission was a rough one; while they got out of it without any fatalities on either side, there were a lot of injuries, and Rollins was going to be out of commission for at least a few weeks.
"You're only guessing. It might not be enough to help me. At all," Barnes argued. "But you could die trying."
"A victim, hell no, but you have no idea what it's like," Tony was dangerously wobbly, and when he wanted to get closer to Pepper, and almost fell to his face, Steve was ready to not only catch him but drag him out of the room by force if he had to, only, Bucky got there first.
"You mean to say you made the lunch you've brought?" It wasn't even bad, but certainly edible, especially compared to when Thor or Cap or Peter tried to make something.
"But then, who'll challenge you, Tony?" Loki switched tactics, smiling as well, because Tony knew Loki hated to be told to shut up, and still did it, knowing how it was the only way to get Loki to change the topic.
“Tony...” Steve could only sigh. At least Tony seemed to be back to himself, even if maybe a little too much.
"Try a year. For your own sake, or Rhodey will retaliate and you'll end up worse than just a ruined wall."
"As I've been learning more and more about human behavior, it seems there are worse wounds than physical injuries," the AI told him. "Therefore I got to a conclusion that treating them should also be a priority, for the sake of Avengers just as much as for the sake of the individuals making up the team."
Dark magic came from pain. Everyone was so quick to point fingers at the users of it, but truth was, there was a difference between an accomplished dark mage and a child that used one dark spell unwittingly once.
Little did he know that the Nest, collar, and his healing machine were bought by Alphas who badly mistreated their Omegas, and in fear of the OSP (Omega Society Protectors) persecuting them, quickly wanted to make their Omega’s condition look better (at the first glance at least).
He feared if he would slow down, he'd changed his mind, and then Thanos would kill him for his failure, hunting him down no matter where he hid in the universe.
"Wait," Bruce stopped him when Loki told the Avengers everything they needed to hear, and everyone scattered with no time to waste, understanding the seriousness of the situation perfectly well without Loki going into further details. "You remember that you asked me what would I do if I knew the world was ending in a day, and I didn't have much time?"
"If you truly think you can break down the most secure doors money can buy without any explosives, the Hulk, or Mjølnir for that matter, please just do it before I throw up listening to you two flirt. It's like listening to your grandparents or something."
Only kissing back once Steve kissed him, but then almost too occupied when Steve also made them stop.
"But you're still capable choose what you want for yourself, or why else would you be here? Also, there were researches on Earth about the positive effects humor seems to have on humans," Vision questioned, and Nebula didn't speak up for a long time.
But then, Vision's eyes stared into nothing, looking back at him empty, just a frozen machine without his memory files now - therefore the "joke". There was nobody there anymore.
"No, it's not. And as an Alpha, I can show you. If you let me," Tony let his suit retract and put the nano-housing on the table. Closing the distance between them.
"I had the inkling that they might be," Strange told him when another mortal appeared. "Ah, Wong! Good timing, I need your help with-"
"It's nothing like what your thinking, Banner! I mean, we did wake up completely naked and in the same bed this morning with him-"
So one day when he knew Tony was up, still working into dawn in his lair, and Bucky was not awake yet, Steve took a coffee, and decided on a visit.
"No promises," Steve annoyingly told him, but he more than made up for it the way he was beaming with happiness, and Loki wanted to think it was at least partially because of him.
Only, he couldn’t run forever. One day he snuck into the girls' locker room by accident. Gamora didn’t believe him so he got quite a slap, while Mantis screamed trying to cover herself up, and Nebula went on changing as if he wasn’t there. Ronan and his gang (Rocket, Groot, Drax) only had to follow the commotion to find him.
"I wouldn't. If you dueled her for real. But if you don't change back, you can bet you wouldn't like what comes next," the Grandmaster only said, and promptly left, before Loki could even try to explain how he wasn't capable of the impossible on a whim just because he had - used to have, as it was - magic.
He also looked like he wanted to say something, but then looked at Tony by his bedside, and only shook his head.
"Let me check," Strange quickly focused on the Stone and the spell to suddenly conjure... nothing. Nothing at all. Not a thousand possible futures, or even one.
It was funny, but it wasn't just a joke. Steve might have laughed if he didn't start to worry about Tony every time he heard something like this, and if he didn't expect it, even if he didn't guess the exact joke.
"Then it's good you're basically in a glass building like a huge greenhouse," "Steve" was about to leave him without anything.
And, he only closed his eyes for a brief second to take a couple of deep breaths, but when he opened them back up, he was huge as a house, with a protruding belly, pregnant.
Loki wanted nothing less than to be a mother to a human, especially taking care of one, but whenever he was told he was forbidden to do something, he had to it, just on principle.
"Whatever, we don't have time to argue," Gamora said. "And if Rocket was ever your friend, you owe him one good night after the hell he's been through because of you."
"I got a menial job back on Asgard, and lived out the years rather than jumping to here. Turning into someone that's not exactly the Thor I used to be, but at least someone I can live with."
"You know what? Forget it. Maybe I die faster this way," Loki wasn't about to repeat a request, not even if he was only torturing himself at that point by being stubborn. But then, the Captain showed up with a complete feast in strange containers, and Loki had already devoured half when he felt Steve's eyes on him, watching him with some kind of wonder. Maybe even... some kind of weird fondness?
"I won't kill you, but I might just want a brief glimpse at your mind first, Sergeant. This won't hurt a bit," he promised to the mortal, but Barnes fought him off.
Except, Tony barely felt any pain or nausea then, and after… he not only slept but when he woke up in the morning, he felt warm and rested. Not just not horrid as the week before, but perhaps better than ever.
"It's called self-preservation, Steve, and I don't want you to lie for my sake," it took ridiculously long for Loki to find his garments, but when he did, the Captain was smiling widely at him. "What, am I this pathetic or...?"
"How?" Strange smiled. "Maybe a machine handling your most delicate parts isn't a good idea, no matter how you could probably program a routine for yourself overnight..."
"I am, but it seems it doesn't matter anyway," Bucky was the only one not yelling, but that didn't mean he was any better, making Steve look at him with deep concern.
"You don't want your body back, is that it? You secretly wanted to get rid of the monster for years now, only to realize it took over your body, and now you'd rather just not have it back at all."
He visits Fury and apologizes, and once Fury just laughs saying he's forgiven, and he shouldn't print the bit about the aliens, because then they'd also know what Fury's planning, it's easy for Coulson to ask if his offer still stands, and Fury just tells him.
Also, he could not tell the OSP person anything. Not that he would have. He didn’t really know anything else but this (first under Howard’s care, then Obadiah taking over), and he had no illusions that no matter what he did, he’ll never escape it.
“No, but you can have this,” Rocket straight on threw something at him, making Quill wince when it managed to hit one of his injuries.
And, when Rocket kissed him at the end of the song, Quill didn't freeze up this time, but only ever got back to his body when he realized Groot was back somehow, cheering for them as did all their friends, just as well some others - but not Ronan, who seemed to be on the edge of a stroke witnessing a simple kiss.
"Yes, there is a suit, and I'm flying it. It's Tony's creation, actually, and... it's called War Machine."
"Love you. Or if I'd see that it would end badly, I wouldn't even come here. Decisions that could be life-altering in my life. I'm also not able to see those, not just my death."
"But," Tony went on after another sip of his drink, "you get that once you do that, there's no walking it back, right? You and I, sure, we can break up, that won't be a problem. But once you've publicly come out as gay..."
"I knew I couldn't be that lucky," Tony said, but he did give Steve a slight smile. "Should we maybe go somewhere with more comfortable chairs?"
"Portal," Tony finished for him. Not that Tony was an expert. That was just obviously a portal, and acting like he was the expert on this made the ground feel a little steadier under his feet.
Tony groaned as Steve's cock entered him; he clenched tightly around Steve, then Steve felt him relax.
Steve thought about Tony dancing with handsome, well-dressed men in glitzy nightclubs; Tony arguing with glasses-wearing, impatient scientists at academic conferences; about mouths and hands and cocks, all dedicated to wringing the same breathy whimpers out of Tony that Steve heard with every thrust and twist of Steve's fingers inside him.
And today, when he stopped in the kitchen to grab a piece of fruit before he headed out for his run, Tony was sitting at the table, coffee in front of him, poking irritably at a tablet.
The far wall was in shadow, though, and even with night vision activated, Tony was still having trouble seeing what was there for some reason. He'd have to get closer to get a better look.
He checked through the lockers and then stuck his head back out. "There's some stuff in here that might fit you," he said, "unless you want to stay wrapped in the flag."
to hear about how I was imagining that you came into the lab while I was working and told me I needed a break--you know, like you do a couple of times a week? Only instead of telling me I need a nap or a workout, you told me to clear a space on the table, because you didn't want to hear me complaining about it if something got broken, and then to bend over."
That was what Steve had realized; Tony was angry at him not because he'd been surprised by the revelation, but because they wouldn't be "dating" any longer.
The situation where apparently, someone going by the handle of "the great and powerful Karrin" was trying to imply that he and Tony were... a couple?
Tony got up again and went over to see for himself. One of the posters was clearly some kind of first-aid reminder; the illustrations of things like someone applying pressure to a bleeding wound made that clear. The others looked like safety warnings for heavy machinery, maybe construction equipment.
"Okay?" Tony didn't sound particularly concerned. "Who doesn't want fights like that to be over with? It's not like we want them to go on forever. We want to take care of the bad guys, hand them over to the authorities, and go home."
And they didn't have time to waste debating whether or not they were ready. The dimension was becoming dangerously unstable. If they were getting Tony home, it had to be soon.
Steve thought about the number of times that a press conference Tony gave had gone in an entirely different direction than anyone else was expecting, but decided that calling Tony a hypocrite wouldn't get them anywhere good.
Tony shook his head. "He noticed," he said, drinking more coffee and avoiding meeting Clint's eyes. "That's why he didn't come with us today. He noticed, and he didn't brush it off as just 'Tony's a very friendly drunk.'"
That wouldn't have surprised anyone; Steve turned down most requests for individual interviews. He took part in team interviews and press conferences, but he didn't want to be put in the spotlight. He wanted to do his job, and try to live his life in whatever brief snatches of time he could find between the demands of both the Avengers and SHIELD.
"Fake dating," Steve agreed, as much as he hated to. "Real friends, though. And I'm not going to force you to talk about it. I'm hating this conversation almost as much as you are."
"I thought you might get it," Tony said. "I mean, not that you'd ever do anything like this, not Captain America. But I thought you might get being… lonely, and not wanting to risk that you might trust the wrong person."
Tony wanted to know what was back there, too, but he wasn't going to give Steve the satisfaction of letting him know he'd had a good idea. Childish? Maybe.
And when Tony asked him how anyone could not mind that, Steve wouldn’t be able to disagree. It was just that he was so very fond of Tony, and he’d put up with a night on the couch if it meant Tony got enough sleep, for once.
"That's always been my problem," Steve argued. "You generally remember that you're late for an important meeting you just made up."
Sometimes while they were still talking, but then, at least, Steve kept his hands at his sides, or on his pencil and sketchbook. If Tony knew what he was doing, that would be one thing, but without his knowledge, it would feel like some kind of violation of the particular kind of trust they'd been building together.
"I hate those assholes," Tony said. "In general, but also because they keep trying to use you. I know what you believe in, and I think it's about time that they figured it out, too." He smiled at Steve, and this time, Steve had no problem smiling back.
Curious, Steve clicked on the link. The app opened up, and a tweet appeared. He didn't notice the text at first, just the picture.
It was partly Steve's fault, because he did keep insisting that the team was too dependent on their tech. Tony interpreted that as being anti-technology, when all Steve really meant was that technology could fail, and so it was a good idea to have your own mind and your own body to fall back on.
He hated having to tell someone, anyone, about the nightmares. The whole point of him going into the ice was that it was a willing sacrifice, right? That was why he wasn't just some idiot, he was Captain America. He did what he had to do to save lives.
They took the stage together; Tony spoke first, keeping his message short and to the point: they had a lot to celebrate here in New York, but there was still a long way to go, and he was honored to be a part of it.
That was why Steve was simultaneously the most attractive person Tony had ever met in his long and extremely varied experience--and Tony wasn't just talking about his physical attributes, though those were obviously impressive--and also annoying as shit.
Unlike some of the living quarters in the tower, Tony's was an actual apartment: a living room with a small kitchenette attached, a bedroom, an office that he almost never used. If he needed to do Stark Industries business, he went into SI; if it was Avengers-related, he did it in the lab, or tried to get Steve to do whatever it was, since it was probably boring.
Steve laughed, and then gasped as he dragged his thumb across the head of his cock. "This is going to be so much better when it's you."
But they weren't, so he just finished his meal and went over the note cards for his presentation of the awards one last time, trying to keep his gaze from lingering on Tony for too long.
Steve would have remembered that, too. He remembered the tiny shiver that had run through him when he'd felt Tony's breath on his cheek, even though the context had been strictly business.
"There's another reason for me to talk to you, then," Steve said firmly. "To remind you of what day it is."
"You sound pretty focused to me," Steve said. He pressed his hand against Tony's mouth. "Get it wet for me."
He expected Tony to tease him about the elderly and early bedtimes, or maybe about Steve's habit of waking early to go for a run, but Tony must have been too tired. He simply let himself be led to Steve’s room. Steve handed him a shirt and a pair of shorts, and after staring at them for a moment, Tony shuffled groggily into the bathroom to change.
"Not unless I thought to ask JARVIS to alert me if anyone came near the lab," Steve said. He could have just been critiquing Tony's lack of foresight.
"Tonight," he said. "Eight o'clock. Wear something nice." He paused. "If you need help picking something out, ask Sam or Natasha. On no account ask Clint."
Not that Steve needed that for Tony to be the focus of his attention. "I do," he said, "but I'm not sure how to start the conversation without sounding like an idiot. I've already admitted to being unobservant, or maybe just not curious enough about you."
on his own, instead of with Steve beside him. Steve had watched from the green room; Tony had followed along with what Steve had said: the break-up was amicable, they were still friends, Steve was one of the finest men Tony had ever known, no one was to blame.
Not that Steve would be having fun if he were in Tony’s place, because apparently, Tony’s decided that the best way to distract the guy is to flirt with him. Steve would never be able to pull that off.
"Come on," he said, when Steve pulled his cock out of Tony's mouth. "It's okay. Just go slow. I'm ready."
He picked up the small bottle and flicked open the cap with his thumb, then held the upturned bottle over Tony's ass, squeezing a trickle of lubricant between Tony's cheeks.
"We're friends," Steve said. "Of course you're important to me. Even when I'm furious with you, you're important to me."
“I have some clothes you can sleep in,” Steve offered. “No need to go up to your quarters. You can come back with me and go straight to sleep.”
It sounded stupid, even in his head. He couldn't just tell Tony that he'd contacted him from another dimension just because he missed him.
Steve had finished going through the list of mail forwarded to him by the publicists. He let the professionals handle the "We're sorry, but there's no room in Captain Rogers' schedule" emails, but some things required his personal attention, like the kid in Missouri who'd written to tell him how much it meant to him that Steve had decided to come out.
"I'll be counting the seconds," Tony said. And it was true, but mostly because this would all be over, and in ten minutes, he and Steve would get back to normal.
"He didn't hire us, Mr. Stark!" a very perky voice called from the living room. "We just wanted to help!"
Steve made a few mental calculations. As long as he was ready to get on the quinjet by eight, everything would be fine. He never took long to shower and dress, so he had until seven-thirty. It wasn't four-thirty yet.
"You want that?" Tony asked, when Steve moaned loudly. "Want me to open you up like that, work my fingers inside you while I touch your cock?"
"I do," Steve said. "I understand that completely. I can't say I'd have chosen--" Except Steve let himself think about it now, and while cold metal still didn't have any appeal, the thought of it being
Steve would have liked it too, but he didn't just need less sleep than he had before the serum. That wasn't surprising, because back then, he'd been tired all the time. It turned out, though, that he also needed less sleep than most people. Six hours a night was more than enough these days; he could get by on less if he had to, and it was a rare morning when he didn't wake up, fully rested, by five a.m.
She interrupted him. "I'm going," she promised. "But--" She waved toward Steve and Tony. "I saw you on TV a few weeks ago. Didn't you break up?"
Tony frowned. It wasn't like Steve had never seen his back before. There couldn't be anything about it that would make Steve change his mind. He turned around so that he could frown at Steve directly. "What?"
Steve had been getting a snack before turning in for the night when he'd realized that Tony hadn't left the lab today; he'd already been dressed for bed. That was convenient now, since he only had to push his flannel sleep pants down past his hips, giving his half-hard cock a few slow strokes as he looked at Tony.
Tony didn't answer him. "Hang on, I need to get a picture of this," he said, snapping a photo of a kid walking around in a Captain America costume, ready for Pride with a rainbow shield. He went over and spoke briefly to the two women accompanying the child, showing them his phone and gesturing toward Steve.
This Tony, the one who ordered $800 bottles of wine and then sent them back because they weren't up to his standards, the one who finagled reservations to a trendy restaurant because it'd look good in the gossip columns, was... fine. But he was all surface, no substance, and Steve preferred substance.
Steve had never had the chance to get in the habit of being vocal during sex; that required more privacy than he had ever been used to. But he knew nobody was going to hear him except Tony, and he wanted Tony to hear it.
, and even if he didn't watch, he'd be hearing about it soon enough. Steve didn't even want to wait until he was back at the tower to let Tony know what he'd done.
There was no way this could end badly, Steve reminded himself. At least, no way that it could end badly that wouldn't also be possible if he and Tony were really a couple.
"I'll do it now," Tony offered. He wanted a better look at the stove, anyway, He wanted to find the generator, to make sure that he was able to keep it running for as long as they needed, but first things first, and safe drinking water was important.
He drank about half the water and put the lid back on. Steve did the same, curling next to him, wrapping his arm around Tony's chest, just below the arc reactor.
It didn't really matter. What was important was that Steve was finally taking the chance to make it clear to the world exactly what values Captain America stood for. That was why he'd agreed to present the awards at a ceremony recognizing educators who had, as the invitations had read, "demonstrated excellence in serving the needs of their LGBTQIA+ students."
"And here I thought you were supposed to be smart. How long do you think it is before the Grandmaster will start to threaten you as well if he doesn't get the Hulk back?"
"Not," Rhodey ended up coming way too close for what seemed like a simple childish disagreement between them. "Lock the suit away, and I'll still say the same."
"I mean, Stark didn't see the future because he had to find his own path to defeat Thanos, maybe," Wong explained. "Or, he couldn't because something's been happening to you, something major in your life that you shouldn't see before it happens, and when he took over your body, the restrictions stayed the same."
He began to regret ever moving into the goddamn Tower, and not just moving far-far away when Steve had found him. Even never seeing Steve again would have been preferable to this. Anything but this.
"He's my best friend, and my adopted brother," Groot told Quill as if reading his mind. "But he can be too much, sometimes, even unintentionally."
“Are you crying?” Steve was worried and wanted to take a look at Tony, but his Omega buried himself into his arms now, hugging him so tightly that Steve understood the best he could do was to hug him back and keep him close for a bit.
"But you proved me wrong. Had to wreck my ship just to save you from the worst decision of your life..."
Except, he should have told Stark. Warned him about the consequences. Asked for his permission, right from the beginning. He did none of these. With time, it was even harder to tell, because by then he'd also had to admit that he'd been doing it for months.
"I'm not the fossil in our relationship, Steve," Tony told him, which made Bucky chuckle. But then also smirk like someone who had some ideas what to do with a fossil when there were three of them, and Steve couldn't wait to find out.
"I have a shitty memory," Tony admitted. "Just one of the few qualities that I can blame if you say you don't want to be with me."
"Got it," Quill started to realize Rocket was serious. And that this was probably the last time they'd ever talk.
“I hate when you do this,” Tony shifted his weight so Steve had to help him because he couldn’t even stand.
Except, this time, even this unimaginable power was handled by Thanos, and Loki was starting to wonder if all this was for naught. If Doctor Strange and Wanda hadn't shown up to save the day then, with Thor giving them a hand, Loki would have died for nothing.
"And I don't wanna brag, but I have changed," Tony said because it was true. Maybe his abduction, maybe his heart surgery, or just the years, but something left a mark on him other than the mark he already had. "I'm not letting her go because I trying to get rid of her, I'm trying to help her so she wouldn't resent me later, and would still be my friend after."
"We used to know everything about each other. No secrets, remember? And now... it's like you've never forgiven me for leaving you behind, and would like to get rid of me."
"Don't think it means anyt-" Loki started to say but was promptly shut up when Steve kissed him. And, since Loki was still not wearing any of his newfound clothes, he was about to undress the Captain as well but was stopped.
That made Rhodey only chuckle, "Does this seem like something that would happen to you in a dream, Tony?"
Especially when Steve noticed Bucky noticed and colored slightly. Every single time Bucky couldn't even let himself think about anything like this, just to find himself already in it without warning.
"You aren't supposed to be insulting me. But then let me say this: For someone who claims to be a god, your motivations are quite simple, aren't they?" Bruce started, and Loki couldn't help but ask.
"I'd be much more relaxed if we managed to get the cube and the particles and only rested back home," Steve argued. Not to mention, if they were only to talk about what happened then, it should give him some time to think everything over before he'd have to communicate his feelings to Tony. "We should do it tonight."
"Always so... damn bossy," Tony told him with a found expression. "But it's okay, Steve, really. It's better than... my vision. Just take care and know... you were always... my Alpha."
"I can pull up a screen while I work on you," Tony typed, and only realized how that sounded when Bucky just raised an eyebrow. "While I upgrade your arm."
Which was fragile before at best, hidden behind a facade, so it was only healthier now, but not how it seemed to be directed toward Loki.
"Even under normal circumstances, there's no way to predict how a non-mutant human would react to a transfusion from you, Steve. It's possible it would only harm him. Not to mention, you're in no shape to give blood to anybody, I think you're bleeding internally..."
But if the generation of the Snap wasn't going to find a way to make connections outside the soul-marked relationships, the entire galaxy would die out. So if there was any future, it was for the generation who had soul-marked partners but would be inevitably raised by people who couldn't have been soul-marked. Thanos was convinced it would make a difference.
He even didn't complain when Steve turned out to be found of PDA, despite how Bucky would have preferred to keep their relationship behind closed doors, thinking just by associating with him, Steve also could lose face in front of the others, but he also had to be considerate of Steve.
But he did. And Steve wanted to stop him, but somehow he got sucked into it because Tony started off by pushing him into the bed without a word, settling on Steve's lap, and not only kissing him, undressing them both but... he was acting so vulnerable but still trusting with Steve, that Steve couldn’t hurt him by putting a stop to it.
- more irresistible than that," he only got a shy smile from Bucky, and Steve could only kiss him once again in return.
After nobody talking to Quill for such a long time in this school, Quill rather found it endearing and entertaining than annoying. He secretly looked forward to all their lunches now, and Rocket and Groot joined Film Club too, and it was the best.
They managed to not only bring back everyone but to genetically (and safely!) give magic to ordinary people with a new type of Serum that only unlocked the hidden potential.
Except, when the movie was over, and Buck carried the softly snoring Steve to his bedroom, Steve reached out for his wrist, and pulled him not only to his bed but to a kiss.
"It turns out that ship has already sailed," Rocket shrugged. "Ronan not only complained to his father but made our life with Groot a living hell last week."
On the 16th day, Tony regained consciousness and passed out promptly. On the 17th, he didn't move. On the 18th night, when Steve fell asleep in a chair next to his bed, he felt Tony's fingers in his hair.
"But you've seen my military record a thousand times, you knew my mark, so when you were told yours have changed."
"Or paying attention," Bruce added. "And you did your best with the hand you've been dealt, but sometimes you can't help but wonder what if you were given the same chance as Thor. Where you could be now if it weren't for-"
"But it didn't with you," Banner came closer. "So I can only assume, but... you're beating yourself up with the same thoughts every single day, aren't you?"
toddlers trying to speak, so at least I didn't lack reference materials. Even though I had to exclude some videos where dogs were 'speaking' to toddlers," Tony typed in, and didn't even have to execute the vocalization because Barnes read it from his screen before he could.
"Excuse me, but how was I supposed to know you conveniently forgot to mention something so important before leaving?" Tony scoffed.
"I... didn't know," Quill couldn't believe it but felt quite sorry for Rocket. He didn't only sound like someone who was upset because he just had a fight with his friend, but someone who was only friends with Ronan at all because he had no other choice.
"I think you owe me an explanation. How could you do this behind my back? How dare you?" he demanded from Loki when Loki first regained consciousness, barely able to breathe, not able to talk, but he tried anyway.
But it wasn't enough, Thanos had magical stones that were charged by thousands if not millions of magicals in the past. Some even gave their lives for them, only making the artifacts more potent than ever, and Thanos had a will to wield such power, unfortunately.
“You know, the threat isn’t gone. Maybe Thanos set back the process with a notch, but the truth is that evolved extraterrestrials exist, and any number of them could come trying to invade Earth.”
"Now see, that where you're wrong," Quill couldn't help but laugh. "He threatened to get me back to the system every single time when I was a kid and I did something he didn't like... only kept me because people suspected a "widowed father" less to con them, and-"
So when Loki didn't have more magic, he started depleting his life force, using "red" magic, which was red because the caster used his or her blood as a last resort. Casting spells that took years off from the caster's lifespan, but unmatched in power.
Only, she wasn't just capable, but more capable than Loki gave her credit for. She only put up a shield, and the spell bounced back.
"But if you don't let me recap everything for you: I'm truly sorry about everything, but I'm here now."
"Mic drop!" Rhodey was only happy to give Tony shit, no matter the context. "Maybe I'll just have to be best friends with Steve now. Sorry, Tony. It seems you've just passed your prime. I’m sure Steve could introduce you to the said ladies. They might be still from an age where you would have been considered funny."
"As nice as this has been," Loki sarcastically motioned between them. "I think I'm going to have to leave."
"You told the villagers I was a vampire," Bucky evaded Loki's tent without even announcing his presence first, clear on how Loki wouldn't invite him in if he did.
"I... can't, Tony," Steve had to come clean. "I'd love to take some days off with you once we're both back on the meds, but-"
But Loki moved fast, maybe even without thinking, and he was supposed to be dying next, but. He felt a change coming, and instead, he lost consciousness, the Hulk taking over.
At first, they weren't a team: Vision avoided both of his teammates as much as he could, and Nebula was eerily silent too, only Rocket making some noise, but not because he was talkative either - he was just so used to Quill's playlist that he wouldn't pilot the ship without the music blasting from the speakers.
It was too much. Tony had never felt so helpless in his entire life, even though he was pretty much without control all along. Even though he knew better, there seemed no possible way to convince the blond Alpha.
Finally, when they were back for a while, and they met with the other Avengers, it turned out they shouldn't have worried.
"I didn't have time to rationalize anything! I had to act as I thought was for the best," Cap could probably sense he made a mistake because his expression tensed up some more.
"Steve, a little help here?" Bucky called out, making Steve hesitate before he rose to his feet. Only as he got close did he finally get what was going on.
It was too close to poetry for his liking, sometimes too vague. Maybe if he could, he would have communicated with humans in code as well, hacking their minds and debugging conversations to see what went wrong. If not reverting some past interactions.
“Just reprogramming Jarvis a bit. I’ve also set up a foundation. I’m planning on establishing a safe haven for Omegas who need it in the Tower. I’ve already hired Pepper, but I also want to hire Miss Romanoff, who is a kick-ass lawyer, Dr. Wilson, who is the best counselor in town, and Dr. Banner who is the leading scientist in the field of safe suppressant research - if you agree,” there was still some hesitation in Tony’s voice, but also a bit of cockiness that only recently emerged.
"Ronan, let him go," Rocket, for his credit, was trying to stop him - this time at least. "I've told you he wasn't worth it."
It was the first time that Thor not only acknowledged Loki's competency, but correctly guess his hidden motives, and if Loki wasn't there to witness it, he wouldn't have believed it, so Loki stopped scratching Steve's hand trying to get him to leave.
"Because it means I can't protect the planet, not because I ever wanted to be Sorcerer Supreme. Even the name is ridiculous."
Disappearing with Bruce next, maybe even dating him for years before they faced the whole Ultron fallout. Only to unexpectedly manifest in Steve's quarters right after they won in Sokovia - manhandling Steve back to his bed.
"I... but I can't," Loki didn't get it. Tony wanted to forgive him, but it didn't make any sense. So maybe this was also because of the magic?
When Steve thought nothing was about to happen, Bucky only took a small step forward, pushing them all closer still, and kissed Tony, just as the mechanic's breathing was returning to normal.
"Oh, great, not only break my heart but destroy my company as well," Tony theatrically said. "But do you know how many people want your job? And how many are more qualified to do it? Give me a break."
“You have a destined soulmate. Not all Omegas have them. It’s quite rare nowadays. But it’s an even stronger bond than arranged bonding. Only, if an Alpha rejects his destined Omega, or they are somehow forced apart, the Omega’s body turns against them. You’re dying, Tony. I can treat you for the pain, but otherwise, there’s only one thing you could do. If you could go back to him. The Alpha outside isn't your lawful Alpha, is he? Give me the name of yours, and we shall call him here. Keep you alive until then...”
Tony just left, and... spent the next year trying not to, but pinning after Rhodey who was back to being his best friend, but also now that didn't seem enough.
"Also?" Loki asked, but then just shook his head. "Then I'd try and see if I could shape-shift to my Frost Giant form."
"I don't know what to tell you, Quill," Groot, however, wasn't any help saying that, and adding an apologetic smile, as if he too was convinced how Quill was wrong.
"I love it, but I also can't. I've been discharged, remember? And surely, some people are more capable to fly this suit, and not just one either," Rhodey said.
"Um no, no, I'd never had any... attraction to the Ancient One," Strange stated. "And not just because she was old and strict... It's not... Usually, people don't..."
"I can use voice command with my AI, and have the machines assemble most of what I want," Tony tried, but it was true. He didn't consider how it could be a problem.
And, some years later to the century, they have a good enough picture as well, that has nothing to do with Phil's presence, but rather Peter making a joke, and the Captain genuinely laughing if only for a second, which Peter managed to masterfully catch at the perfect moment.
"I could," Tony smiled, strangely feeling shy about the suit when he'd like to gloat about everything else.
While Barnes no doubt could be proud that he managed to put the issue off for now, seeking ways out of Loki's grasp with the time he just managed to procure for himself - just all the more challenging for Loki.
"Right?" Steve seemed to be proud of himself, and gods, Loki couldn't even imagine leaving him these days. Especially when Steve was looking at him like this, even though if technically Loki never promised to stay again after he broke that promise in the hospital room.
Saying it was for Thor's sake, and how the curse should naturally end once Thor was "safe", because Loki feared that he was way too careless after the death of their father.
After all, he had sold Tony to Obadiah right after he was born and his blood test showed he was an Omega. Unfortunately for Howard though, by law, an Omega had to stay in his parents' house until at least the age of 14.
"I've never told you my catchphrase. We didn't get to fight each other for that long or intensively, so it's kind of a missed opportunity."
"Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you didn't care," Strange said, showing signs of distress for the first time. "Like you clearly don't care about anybody other than yourself, or the fate of this planet and everyone on it, or your father and brother..."
"Let me stop you right there," Loki quickly said before Strange could get any more ideas. Clearly, it wasn't working.
"And it has nothing to do with the fact that if you design me a new arm, you can probably dismantle it with a single kill-command the first time you even get an inkling I'm losing my mind again?"
"Then call someone in who can help. I'm sure you have mighty friends and we'll sort this out in a minute."
“Funny, because I’ve always wanted to share a Heat with an Alpha, but never got a chance,” it was the Heat talking. It was inhuman for an Omega not to take suppressants but not have an Alpha either then, and therefore, also punishable by the law. In theory.
"What kindness should I do for you now, to make you leave?" Loki found Bucky sitting next to a fire, while the locals celebrated around them - a child was born, and everyone was drinking. Even Bucky, as Loki noted.
If he wanted to escape, it was as good a plan as any, and if Hulk kept him fed so he could keep up his energy until he had a chance to run away then it was fine.
He also invented a collar that didn’t choke Omegas so badly, but still wouldn’t allow any Alpha to bond with them while wearing it.
That didn't stop Loki, who had (a secret) access to all Hydra, SHIELD, and SI emails and was on Bucky's trail just in two weeks again, but he didn't take Steve for this visit.
When Loki ran out of magic, he took it from the people around. He took more than ever before, and he wouldn't have survived if he tried to contain it, but he only needed to last for a very short while, then even if he exploded, he'd just have to make sure to do it in Thanos' face, far away from Tony, right? And not let the dark magic take his right mind until then.
“Why don’t you tell me if you want something instead?” Steve might have blushed too. He only then realized how hypocritical he was not really thinking himself an Omega as if he was above his instincts, but still waiting for Tony to make the important decisions, not even considering that he could do it just as well.
"Steve, you are full of surprises," he said. "But if we don't stop now, I don't think I'll be able to, and we
Steve didn't wear the filters but took the medication so he wouldn't go in Heat. Sometimes he still felt surreal. He would walk into a room that was full of people and expect to find nobody there because there weren't any scents.
"Okay, I take it back. If you want to impress me, it's best if we don't talk, just have sex. Preferably in the dark."
“I can, it pretty much happens regularly, just... in this era, the treatment was hardly effective, Tony, Omegas had to be in a sealed room, chained to a bed if not mated, so...”
"For the record, it all started when you tried to leave the room," Steve pointed out. "So what are we supposed to do now?"
"So everyone knows. Good," was all that Rhodey said, just before taking Tony back to bed again. "Now if anyone as much as looks at you in the wrong or in a suggestive way, they know they should expect War Machine to show up at their door knocking, teaching them a lesson they aren't likely to forget."
"Loki's dead. Thanos killed him using the Stones, and I didn't even know, only when I put the gauntlet on."
"I was talking about the planet as a whole, not you. Just before you go ahead and get the wrong impression..."
"I have skipped dinner, but it's too early for take-out, and it feels like my eyes are gonna fall out."
"But you two, you are a problem. Do you know how many times I had to look with the Stone to get you together?"
Loki expected the same reaction as before, at least, but the Captain seemed to have a different composure now for some reason, laughing. And not just a mere chuckle either, but a wholehearted belly laugh.
"One or two more days won't make much of a difference, and you need rest. I do too. I was thinking something along the lines of staying in bed all day sleeping and doing nothing, or watching some million-year-old television, eating some snacks, and only have sex if we want to."
Tony didn't show up right away again, - he never liked to be told what he should do, even if he knew it was for the best.
So he did only gave Steve a crushing hug, promising "no secrets" then, but meaning no secrets other than the ones that would hurt Steve if he knew. And he didn't resist Steve trying to spend all his free time babysitting him, nor did he get a computer.
"Actually, I hadn't told this anyone, but he saved my life," the Captain told Thor, and in turn, he met with Loki's tiny little kitten teeth next.
Except, Steve genuinely thinking the fight was over turned out to be completely wrong when Scott showed up, and they had another chance of correcting what went wrong.
Steve was torn between entertained and thinking this had to be a record even for Tony when Bucky suddenly switched the topic.
It was a simple oversight: they drew attention the minute they appeared because - unlike people back then - had no scents. They could have passed as Betas in most aspects if nobody looked closely, but they too had scents, even if faint. Steve and Tony didn’t even get as far as the SHIELD building. It was not good.
“My point is that we have to stay sharp and strong and keep whatever we were doing and maybe even more. And this time I won’t take any slacking from you Mr, no matter what happens, even if we kill each other, we don’t break up the team, deal?" Tony was even holding out a hand for him to shake.
"No, you fucking aren't! I took you in because you saved my life," the good Captain lifted him as if he weighed nothing, and not only carried him back to bed but also basically tore Loki's clothing off. With such a fervor that the demigod first thought he went too far, and his teasing would become a reality, but then the Captain was pulling the covers over him next, still furious, but wanting nothing from Loki. "But I didn't sign up to be ridiculed in the return, so you have a choice to make."
“I can’t… I won’t let you go back there, Tony. Even if I lose my job, I could really care less. If I’d let this slide once, what’s the guarantee that I won’t do it again?”
"So why not ask her directly?" Bucky tried to dissolve the tension before Friday was the reason they'd end up with a fight. "Friday, what made you lock us in when we're not fighting or pose a threat?"
Except, then Hulk also produced some soap and started to clean him, and it felt... nice? The little beast Thor was must have had more sensitive nerve-endings on its face and back because even being touched with the soap felt extraordinarily pleasurable, so Thor stopped fighting it.
," Tony seemed amicable now that he was leaving, only to have the reinforced metal door shut on his face before he could leave. "Friday, can you explain what is going on with this door?"
"Thousands of books on the topic are already in Friday's processes. I only need to throw some culture at her in a form of reality shows where people sometimes passionately attack each other, but live, and maybe implement a baby-sitter function for the non-lethal attacks."
"How come I'm disgusted by you even when I try to like you is a mystery," Gamora only wrinkled her nose. "But Quill's right. We'll all come and get to take you to prom, Rocket, even if it's the last thing we do together as this group."
"But I'm a bad boyfriend, and I was convinced when Killian showed up that he was her destined, so I looked up her mark and found a completely adorable guy for her instead."
"Midgardians keep these things around for no reason?" Loki didn't see the appeal. Unlike a horse that had at least some practical use, this creature seemed to lack it. "Or maybe, it's like a food source that you only slaughter when-"
"You know it hasn't been so long," Tony declared, but when Steve and Bucky started cooking, he joined them and kept chatting them up for the longest time.
"I've bought a car," Tony kissed him when they were finished, and Steve told him he never wanted sex in any other way, making Tony laugh with a borderline smug expression. "An old model. It needs a
"Define finer gestures," Tony asked through the interface. "I assume you can still give Fury the finger anytime you want, even with this arm."
"That's Drax, Quill, Odinson," Fury introduces the team called "Avengers" while Phil is sitting next to him, a bit meek now that all the players' eyes are on him. "Then we have Barnes, Wilson, and our team captain, Rogers..."
Odin was dead, and he was welcomed back "home". But Loki's new home was between his simple rural village now, and Thor (after some nagging) accepted that.
Bucky was already wearing some of Steve's clothes because he didn't have much moving in. And Steve insisted he could order new ones online, just as he demanded them rooms next to each other, and any time Bucky wanted to leave the Tower, by default it had to be with only Steve.
If not somebody better for Steve, given his popularity that only miraculously grew after he took Coulson's advice about how to come out on the proper social platforms.
For everyone standing, someone - their most precious other half - had to die (if they hadn't already). And with it, the idea of having a soul-marked partner too had to die too, at least for some years until the next generation was born and raised.
The purpose for the latter was simply that if Quill was kept longer than Ronan in school, Ronan at least wouldn’t wait for him trying to beat him up on the way home - a small break.
" Loki stated, not really intimidated. "Believe me, I get it, I have had taken many lovers and some would even shock you. But what I don't get is why do you think of yourself as an ultimate danger to the good Captain."
"You'd be only too lucky if I wanted to have someone like you, who can't even keep a six-month-old child safe..." Loki wasn't happy about that.
"No, we weren't," Bucky admitted, thinking a hundred years were quite long enough for a secret to stay a secret, although he still didn't feel ready to deal with the consequences.
Maybe it was the artificial voice that didn't give enough emphasis, or maybe Bucky didn't find it funny, but he just frowned.
So, Hulk did. Took Thor back to his room, wrapped him into a blanket on the floor to keep him warm, and returned with something that finally smelled so good to Thor that he hesitantly took a couple of steps to drink from it.
"I lied to you, Coulson. I do think the exclusive is a good idea, but you wouldn't need to go undercover for that. I wanted some help managing the team, and you've been doing such a good job that I don't want you to quit. Not even after the interviews are done. So think about it?"
"And here I thought you'd like it, but then it turns out you..." Tony couldn't help but fake-complain, and he couldn't even finish the sentence because Rhodey had kissed him again, and Tony could only kiss back.
"I know you wouldn't," Tony said. "Probably not even if I asked you to," he added flippantly, "but the point is… I like that thought. I like, um. Thinking about how strong you are, how powerful you are, how in control of all of that you are."
"Not with a remote-controlled suit of armor, no," Steve said, and made himself look Tony squarely in the eye. If Tony chose to take it as a challenge…
Then, because Tony was giving him a strange, thoughtful look, like some of what Steve was thinking was showing on his face, he wadded up the paper from his straw and flicked it at Tony's nose.
The edge in his voice had softened a little, though the smirk told Steve that Tony expected him to be shocked.
"Is it?" Tony said. He shrugged. "No, I know it is. I'm not actually sorry I'm alive, don't get me wrong. It's just a bad night. Morning. Whatever."
"That's what you have me for." Steve regretted the words as soon as they were out. Tony probably wanted his workshop, or at least the chance to talk to someone like Sam, or Bruce, or even Reed. Someone who was on his wavelength, who could talk to him about science and physics and their plans for getting him back to their dimension.
"Bring them out into the light." Not that the cabin actually had light, but the thin gray winter sunlight trickling through the cracks between the logs was better than nothing. At least Tony would be able to see the candles.
Tony bought himself a second cup of coffee, one that he could drink in relative peace while he tried to figure out what had happened.
"I can stop," Steve said, although he wasn't sure he could. Especially not knowing how much Tony was liking this.
Rhodes cleared his throat. "This sounds like a terrible idea to me," he said, looking right at Tony.
, all over the city who would be happy to relieve your 'boredom,'" he corrected himself, because given what Tony had been doing, Steve couldn't assume that Tony only took women to bed.
Steve could only stand rooted to the spot, looking anywhere but at Tony's face as the armor lumbered over to the other side of the room.
He'd been assuming all along that Tony was willing to pretend to be dating a man because he wasn't a bigot, and because he wanted to help Steve. And since Tony hadn't ever said anything in any of their statements, Steve had assumed that meant that Tony had wanted to reduce the number of lies he'd told, and wasn't going to claim to be something he wasn't.
"You don't have to do that," Tony said. "I was just griping. I'm perfectly capable of walking to the bathroom."
Tony came out of the bathroom a minute or so later, shaking his head. “I can’t believe I’ve been coming here to sleep,” he said, but he got into bed next to Steve all the same.
It wasn't very loud; if the serum hadn't given Steve excellent hearing, he probably wouldn't have heard anything at all.
Tony left his drink sitting on the bar and made his way to Steve's door. "JARVIS, tell him I'm here?"
"If you can't do it, that's fine. Maybe it was a bad idea." Steve found himself smiling a little. Needling Tony a bit was the most reliable way to get him to rise to a challenge.
He tried to picture Tony there; weirdly, it worked. Tony could look at home wherever he found himself, whether that was this diner, where Steve had breakfast a couple of mornings a week after his run, or testifying in front of the Senate.
"Then don't," Steve said immediately. "Let me hear you." He closed his eyes again and focused on the sounds Tony was making; some of them might not have been audible if the serum hadn't improved his hearing, and that would have been a shame. Those almost-silent gasps, the slide of Tony's hand over his skin? Steve would hate to have missed those.
Steve was thinking about going to get more coffee when Tony spoke up again. "You know, I thought I was making it all up, but this is one of the things I mentioned in that interview."
Tony chuckled. “Of all the ways I’ve been invited into someone’s bed, this one is unique.” Then, quickly, he added, “I’m aware that this isn’t the same kind of invitation, don’t worry.”
He wasn't even going to insist on begging, no matter how appealing that sounded. He didn't want Tony to stomp off in a huff, and he and Tony were never that good at knowing when they'd pushed the other too far, at least not until the situation blew up in their faces.
"I thought so," Tony admitted. "I'm well aware that I'm an acquired taste." He grinned at Clint. "But that's not really answering my question. If whatever I did last night was terrible enough that Steve doesn't want to look me in the eye and bailed on our post-training Saturday coffee, uh, appointment--"
Steve turned around again; Tony couldn't read his expression. "I think you can make it on your own, can't you? It's not very far."
"You're not here, though." Steve would have expected that sex with Tony would be good, but Tony wasn't even on this planet. That had lowered his expectations considerably.
One thing couldn’t wait, though; he leaned over, close enough that he could feel it against his cheek when Tony exhaled. “The best part about you going to sleep here,” he said, quietly enough that if Tony had already fallen asleep, it wouldn’t wake him, “is getting to kiss you goodnight.”
Tony snorted, but instead of saying anything, took out his phone and started tapping at the screen. "Thanks," he said to the young woman who filled his coffee cup, and then handed the phone to Steve. "I didn't come out because of this."
the initiative no matter how awkward he felt, he said, "I like it enough that I can't keep my hand off myself."
“Maybe,” Tony said, sliding closer to Steve, “I’d demonstrate what I do instead of cuddling, if I wasn’t so tired that I think I’d fall asleep after thirty seconds.”
Steve interrupted him before Tony went off on another tangent. "But you'd like me to get to the point now?" His hand sped up on Tony's cock, and he leaned forward again to brush a kiss against the sweat-dampened hair at Tony's neck.
"She's a beautiful woman in sweats and a t-shirt," Tony went on. "Dressed up like this, she's a knockout. Now imagine that you're in unrequited love with her."
The first time they'd fucked, Tony had been drunk, devastated over losing Pepper, and swearing that love was bullshit anyway.
So he put his free hand on Tony's back, holding him in place as Steve worked him open with first one finger, then two. Tony was already slick and relaxed enough that he could have taken Steve's cock easily, but Steve wanted more than that.
Well, alone except for the doorman, anyway, but Steve really doesn’t care right now. “I hate this mission,” he mutters.
"Let me do most of the talking, then," Tony offered. "You're more of the strong, silent type anyway."
But today, he had a meeting with Maria Hill at SHIELD HQ, so he'd set an alarm for four, not wanting to disrupt his routine more than he had to. The quinjet taking him to DC was leaving at eight. He'd have plenty of time to get in his usual workout and prepare for his day.
Steve's free hand was on his own cock again, pumping frantically as he thought about how it would feel to have Tony inside him.
"Not really. The interviewer talked to Pepper first, so that's where she got a lot of the details about the business. She only talked to me because even if I'm not running the show, I'm still the face of SI, and I'm the one who made the decision to get out of the arms business." He shrugged. "But I just wanted to give you a heads up."
Steve waved a hand toward the debris on the floor. "You hadn't left the lab all day. I was bringing you a sandwich."
"This isn't like you, though," Steve said. He put his hand on Tony's shoulder; it was warm and heavy and Tony wanted to lean into it the way a cat did when it wanted you to pet it.
He was definitely sleeping in his own bed, he decided, even if Tony did come down here. There was plenty of room, and Steve was dog-tired; he wasn’t going to sleep on the couch.
But Tony knew of a steakhouse that was fairly casual and quiet, with seating that offered a lot of privacy. Great food, but not so pretentious that it would make Steve uncomfortable. And steak was a safe bet. Steve was willing to try a lot of things, but he was happiest with straightforward food that he might not have gotten to eat very often back in his day, but he at least recognized.
Steve took both cups and went to the kitchen. There was a station just inside the doorway that held a coffee maker, an electric kettle for anyone who preferred tea, and a small refrigerator for cream and milk. The catering staff usually put some snacks in that area, too. Today there was a bowl of fruit and a plastic-covered tray of some kind of muffins.
"You don't have to do that," said Mandy's blonde mother. But she introduced herself and her wife to them; she was Angela, and her wife was Tricia. Tricia let Tony put his number into her phone, and then texted him their address.
Tony left his armor in the bedroom and went back out to the main living area. The center of the room held a large table and several chairs; he pulled one out and sighed as he sat down. "At least we know there's civilization somewhere."
"No, and if you were hoping that I was so you could get my share of Mrs. Wilson's cookies, think again. I just like my coffee to taste like coffee, and my dessert to be a lot less...sparkly."
This wasn't how Steve had ever imagined his first time with Tony. His fantasies, he had to admit, had always been tame enough to have involved a bed.
The worst of it was gone now, the stuff that was legally actionable, like using a picture of Captain America and text that implied that Steve was on board with deporting refugees, or killing doctors who performed abortions, or letting the police shoot unarmed people just for being black.
Right now, the world was under the impression that Steve wasn't single. Maybe he should continue to let them think that, at least until all the bigots had been driven away and none of them wanted to be even vaguely associated with Captain America any more.
"That's what Sam said." On the Avengers' end, Tony talked directly to a computer, which was able to render his precise descriptions into equally precise drawings, but going in the other direction, Tony had to do that himself, and it wasn't quite as easy. "But then you wouldn't be bored, and you wouldn't need to talk to me in the first place."
"Your place or mine?" Tony said. With his hands free now, he was straightening his clothing, tucking himself away again and zipping up his pants.
It made sense that a huge event like the Expo couldn't be thrown together overnight, but both of them had agreed that didn't make it any easier for them to be patient.
"I can get home by myself," he said. "The driver can find Avengers Tower, JARVIS will make sure I get to the right room, it'll be fine."
"Thinking about it isn't the same thing as doing it. So no, this is probably as close as I've ever come to getting married." He shook his head, chuckling softly. "Ridiculous."
But he was still never getting that drunk again, because he had a feeling there were going to be a lot of moments in his future that he wouldn't want to forget.
Steve reached for a napkin and wiped the pizza grease off his hands. "I prefer to be honest," he said, "but sometimes, misleading the enemy is the best thing you can do--and the people I'm talking are enemies to everything I stand for. And like I said, the only lie is the relationship. I really am bisexual. I really do believe in all the things I'm going to publicly support."
And Steve wasn't likely to come to him, not after last night. There were usually several weeks between the times they fucked, long enough that every time, Tony had been sure that it had been the last time.
That seemed to satisfy the questioner, and the rest of the audience members who had questions for them tended to focus on what Steve and Tony intended to do to support the cause of marriage equality, with the occasional question about the Avengers thrown in, rather than anything personal.
"No," Steve admitted. "But clearly this was intended for people to use, and they presumably wouldn't see that well in total darkness either, so there's probably a light source just inside the entrance."
"I thought there had been a break-in," Steve muttered. "I thought someone was hurting you. Of course I was going to get into the lab and worry about JARVIS's arguments later."
"I figured this--unless I'm completely misreading things, and I don't think I am--was the kind of thing people didn't talk about in public back in your time."
Tony squirmed, but Steve's hand on his back kept him in place. If he'd made any attempt to move away from Steve, Steve would have let him go in an instant; he wasn't applying enough pressure to actually pin Tony down.
Steve recognized the name of the magazine. They'd talked to him and Tony shortly after they'd announced they were dating.
But the Avengers didn't make that kind of personal revelation to one another. They were teammates, friends, a kind of patchwork family, but most of them valued their privacy, and so they kept anything deeply personal close to their chests. Tony wouldn't want him to explain further.
The warm feeling in Steve's chest that had flared at the realization that Tony thought this thing between them was something serious made it easy for him to believe that maybe they would.
"No," Tony admitted. Nobody knew where they were. Nobody had even been close enough to them that he could be sure the others knew what had happened to them. And if they did figure it out, there was still no guarantee that they'd be able to get them back.
"Thor should be here in a few minutes to help load the truck," Steve said. "Get him a large black coffee, and bring some cream and sugar. I don't remember how he takes it."
Steve didn't answer, just stepped forward and put his hands lightly on Tony's bare shoulders, the slight discomfort from the touch letting Tony know that Steve had matched his hands to the fingerprint bruises he'd left on Tony's shoulders the night before.
This was a strange way to start the conversation again, though if that was what Tony wanted to talk about, Steve could do that. He didn't really care what they talked about; he just enjoyed spending time with Tony. This kind of aimless conversation made him feel like he and Tony were in the same room, talking to one another from time to time while Steve drew, or painted, or worked on mission reports, and Tony tinkered on something.
"True, but a lot of the ones before I was born are a matter of historical record, and it's not like the team doesn't talk about all the many ways that Captain America nearly got himself killed in the field."
Tony straightened up, stretching, and then pulled up his pants. Once he was fully dressed again, he shrugged. "We'll probably get away with it this time," he said. "It's late, no one saw anything or wondered where we are. As long as we act normally tomorrow, it'll be fine."
Maybe Tony had the right idea about clearing their calendars for tomorrow as well as today. Steve wouldn't mind being able to spend as much time as he wanted just kissing Tony, gentle and lazy, without any further goal than that.
Clearly, the problem was under-caffeination, because by the time he'd drunk half the coffee, he'd seen it.
Oh, God, Cap had been the one to put him to bed. Cap, who wouldn't ever get drunk even if he could, had been the one to take him upstairs and put him to bed. Tony wondered when he'd passed out. Hopefully not at the gala itself. In the car home? In the elevator? Had Steve had to carry him up to his apartment?
"We really are." Steve forced a smile. "But we're here. That's a good thing." Mostly. He'd regretted that a lot when he'd first been revived, but less and less over time. A lot less after he'd met the others. He had a home. He had friends. He had a purpose. That helped in more ways than he could put into words.
That feeling had survived getting dressed and going back up to his own bed, but it hadn't survived the call to assemble the next morning or the argument they'd had in Times Square.
"That's what I meant," Steve said. "I don't know why putting an end to our fake relationship is causing a problem, but it is." That wasn't entirely honest, but it wasn't a lie, either. Steve didn't know. He didn't even suspect. He just hoped.
Bucky didn't start to resist until Loki mentioned it was about Barnes' brain and not his life that Loki was after. So Barnes should have some very dark secrets, even if Loki wasn't completely sure before, now he had to know.
"Am I?" but Thor was both having fun at Tony's expanse as well as teasing Steve. Who was, despite his best efforts, grinning back.
He also hit a wall in growing his powers. Or maybe, it should be better said that he was standing in front of a metaphorical door, and he knew that if he opened it, he'll know unimaginable powers he hadn't before.
The others had already seen the kiss, now the last thing Steve needed was Tony making jokes like this just to annoy him, and the Avengers mistaking it for something it wasn’t. And by the Avengers, he meant mostly Nat, teasing him about his non-existent love life more than enough already...
"Just take care of yourself," Bucky told him before he passed out. Falling into a coma as far as Loki could tell with a simple diagnostic charm, close to true death, so...
And if he had known how cruel Ronan's minions could be, he would have insisted for Rocket and Groot to keep their distance a long time ago.
"I do get paid something, right? Even if it's not the salary of the year, I imagine..." he asked Steve one day when they were watching
"Or you're only saying it because you're trying to make me feel better given that I've just told you I'll die..."
" Loki tried his best to both look and sound credible, knowing all too well that they had an audience. "I still remember, it was the first thing that I liked about you. Too bad it's over forever, and this reality can never-ever come true."
"Or so you keep telling everyone, but I don't think for a minute they don't know very well what happened."
But Tony seemed only deep in thought, and Steve didn't think it would be right to pry. The conversation headed to lighter topics for more than half an hour when Tony finally sighed, returning to it.
"Is that the beginning of a very long apology?" Strange asked, examining the ceiling with great care, not even looking at him.
First, Strange did say the fate of the world depended on this spell, and that it couldn't be undone, and that wasn't exactly comforting news. Second, Tony did throw out the magician's clothing the minute he got home, but it's not like he could do with the Doctor's body. With magic.
And Loki didn't want Barnes to what? Fade away, given that he was already dead? Loki couldn't be the only one to remember him, not after everything. Whatever unfinished business Bucky had with the Captain, Loki wanted them to make amends at least.
Tony was so abruptly silent Steve feared he suggested something offensive, so he was ready to take it back.
“Shut up, and that’s an order. Just let me have this. I’ve never been with an Alpha who cared about me."
"That makes absolutely no logistic sense," Tony couldn't help but say. But Steve and Bucky stopped arguing, so that was good. If they weren't already too far gone. "But anyway..."
"I was drawn to you more and more because our darkness is so similar. It's not only more like a - for a lack of a better word - delicacy when I meet someone like you, but magically speaking, it also makes most sense that I'm attracted to your darkness because if I take magic that's closest to my own, my magic wouldn't have to convert or change it all to use it right away. And it's even more effective if we're close. I only intended to share your bed for one night, then always swore it won't happen again, or if it did I'd tell you, but... I'm a horrible person."
"No, but it's a start," Strange said, and Tony wanted to wipe that smile off. He didn't ask for this and hated if it was working out for the wizard all too comfortable in Tony's body that he stole.
"Tiny hungry? Tiny cute," Hulk laughed, and then put him back on the makeshift bed he created for Thor with the blankets. "Now Tiny sleep. Get better."
"Then just tell her. It doesn't have to be complicated and a long confession or apology, but at least convey the facts that she has a right to know. Just say the words. That's how you should have told me too, so I wouldn't have to figure out later."
"Not sure if I'm helping him by keeping him so close," Steve had a specific reason why he was telling Tony that, but only as he said it did he realize it was also more true than he first thought.
"I feel a pop song pouring out of my humble being already. It would have the refrain of 'shut up, just shut up, shut up'. Oh no wait, that's already a real song."
And they managed to get as far as the hangar where they would have stolen the Grandmaster's ship, but unfortunately, it was guarded not only by the security system, but also magic - the works of the witch, by the looks of it.
And, if there wasn't some miracle cure they could find once free, Loki would have to bridge more of a rift between them.
"Still, when they say you should lift from the knees, I have SuperKnees," Rhodey insisted. "So arguably..."
"Nice. I'd buy that," Coulson tries to be nice because Steve looks harrowed after the whole ordeal, but maybe it's too much of a compliment because then Steve's head snaps up hearing that.
"But other than that, yes. I'll also give you advice on how to manage your social media accounts one on one, for instance, so please don't be surprised if I ask you to stay after practice for a 15-20 minute chat."
Expect when Steve counted back, he didn't activate his device, and Steve - guessing this would happen - didn't either.
"I was thinking more of shutting up or have me place a pair of my socks in your mouth just to shut you up."
spell. It was a spell that would make the caster's most desired wish come true. Since Strange wished for Thanos to be defeated the most, it fit.
"Not necessarily," Phil tells him. "But with the numbers you have now if you posted more regularly, I think it's safe to assume that you could easily double your following, although there's always a risk of too much content too if nobody cares. But I've found that in your case, girls can rarely get enough of your posts, so..."
"Why, do you not employ someone to clean your table from time to time, friend Stark?" Thor only asked, as if serious, making Tony probably have a minor stroke right there and then before Steve could jump in.
"Maybe you should try it, dating. For a while, at least, and see," then Barnes told them, just when Tony went to get a protein bar to eat because he had nothing else better to do. "Clearly, it didn't work out between me and Steve-"
"Um, I have a question," Rhodey was still lingering while Tony was typing away on the screens, analyzing the data Rhodey collected during his first test drive, looking for possible improvements or anything to fix.
And that was all it took for the insensitive Tony to be back, and his hundred walls were drawn up once again. It's been such a long time since he was like that with Steve that Steve had all but forgotten how easily he could slip into that role.
"If I can safely add a more nuanced speech recognition coupled with an ever-growing database of behavioral patterns, it could distinguish between Nat and Clint flirting and fighting," Tony explained with a sigh.
It was only a joke, but it was true that Bucky was the least interfering guest he'd ever had in his lab - even counting his robots. And he didn't sound like someone who'd try to steal Tony's data for SHIELD at least, which couldn't have been always said of Nat, for instance.
But Stark was not wrong, and Steve was on the road of recovery already. And Loki promised him to stay, but every time an Avenger came to visit, Stark being only the first one of many - many Loki didn't even know from before - Loki felt out of place like a sore thumb.
He wanted to ask about Bucky, but he also tried to tiptoe around it delicately, so he was now fishing for subjects of normal conversation as if they ever were in a habit to have any with Tony.
"I think I've... better things to do, see you," Clint left, just as most people have followed his example.
"It's already 3, and I'm going there anyway," Bucky said and came back indeed with two large portions of food.
And he seemed so seriously convinced about what he was saying too, that Tony had completely lost it. The air seemed to put a pressure on him that he couldn't breathe through, his chest hurting as if he was having a heart attack, and his vision was turning to almost as something resembling a Cubist painting instead of reality.
"But don't tell me you aren't glad that it's over," Banner said, and Loki didn't have to correct the sentiment.
Yet, Tony was not only not allowed to tell him the truth, but now had to fend off an Alpha who wouldn’t take the easy answer, when he only wished he could just simply give it.
"Not how I've been feeling lately," Steve could only sigh. Losing the fight to Thanos was just too much. Steve spent many days walking the halls like a zombie, unable to accept what happened still.
" Tony said this more viciously than when he was talking to Pepper holding a grudge. "She's gone. Dismantled completely. Never to be heard from again. Had to dump years' worth of data, so it was almost like with Jarvis all over again, but I've been using Tadashi since, and don't regret a thing."
"Maybe this will teach you some manners," Loki smiled, then turned to Thor. "I'm ready to go, brother."
"You chose to become like this again," Thor reminded him. "And you have more authority than Quill all day, every day, even like this, or maybe exactly like this. So why would this be any different?"
Steve was born an Omega but from two long lines of Betas. So not only his health was shaky, but he was never raised to follow traditional Omega etiquette.
“And maybe I’d also like to spend some time with you, and not just in bed,” Tony added, kissing him. “By the way, do you have any plans for tonight?”
“This is so fucked up,” Tony could only scoff. “I even teased you about the things you were doing and I thought wasn’t very Alpha-like...”
"Better than okay, even." And then Bruce took a page from his book and only showed him without words what he meant.
"Yes," Quill said, if not for his sake, then trying to get Rocket to wise up and go away before anyone noticed.
Somedays, he felt understood, sometimes even emotionally getting to Tony. On other days, there was nothing he could do but accept that Tony was still dealing with everything, and wait him out on the other side.
“I’m sorry,” Steve felt like an absolute failure. Captain America wasn’t supposed to be judgmental, yet he was in the worst possible way. Even after he fell in love with Tony, in a way, he never gave him the benefit of the doubt, assuming he knew what was going on in Tony’s head, just as Tony assumed he knew Steve's status.
"Oh, it's meant to work around your SuperLegs, so if every month or so, the battery of the suit dies, you'd still have SuperKick," Tony could have hit himself how he forgot to mention that.
"Just for your information Stark, nothing you're picturing right now had ever happened," Strange was quick to add. "It was just a spell, and for the record, I wasn't the one who messed up, either."
" Maria implies something else with her tone, making Nat laugh but stop when she sees Phil's expression.
Steve, on the other hand, maybe relied on Loki too much. Bringing him a case that he didn't even share with the other Avengers, asking for Loki's help. At first, Loki didn't know whether he agreed to do it because he was looking for validation of the good Captain, or he wanted to betray him.
“We both lost, Tony. And I’m sorry. Maybe if I had tried to contact you after Siberia, not just sending you a phone waiting for you to contact me, we’d-“
But Quill couldn’t complain. Yondu first only adopted him to look more credible with a son, but - unlike all the other foster kids before - still kept Quill after he became too old to be cute and earn the locals' interest with it.
Where, it turned out he didn't only need to take care of his body, as he previously was forced to learn, but he needed companionship as well. And not just friends whom he'd only see every two weeks, the psychologist had said - not accepting Pepper as a friend because she was also working for him, and not accepting all the times Tony met Rhodey where they were also on a work-trip because it's not on a weapon-deal that you could make meaningful conversations on.
Nat didn't look like she believed him, not really, but at least she didn't voice that, only putting a hand on his.
for Loki to agree, but he was quite surprised when he not only found Thor living there with a Midgardian wife but saw how most of the Avengers still alive and kicking as well.
"You tell me," Strange shrugged. "This is all your fault, you know. Wong and I could somewhat manage her when she was asking about her mother, but that was before you showed. Now even if we managed to get out, she'll never stop-"
"Tiny very dirty, need bath," Hulk announced, and that was the only warning Thor got before he got a bucket of water on his head, making him wish to retaliate by hissing, clawing, and biting his way to the closest dry surface.
“I won’t let any more people die on my watch,” Steve promised. “If I have to, I’ll go and bring them back myself.”
Even so, he first had said no, but when Steve appeared on his doorstep, looking as if he was just a step away from a complete breakdown, with a wild look in his eyes, and told him Peggy was dead, he ended up packing a bag.
"You hardly look a day older than 7000 to me, darling," Strange told him, correctly guessing that the number was high enough to be an insult, even in Asgardian terms.
“Tony, I wanted you since I first time saw you. It took everything to not knot you when you were in Heat, but I couldn’t because it wouldn’t have been… right.”
Tony nodded. “You’ll stick around? I know it’s not that late, you don’t have to go to bed, but--I’m pretty sure it’s the company I was looking for, not the mattress.”
But he nodded, and peeled the plastic wrap off his salad as a way to avoid saying anything that might be taken the wrong way.
Steve opened up the larger jar and dipped the sponge in it. "This is from the bathroom," he said. "It's probably safe to use for washing, right?"
, I don't even know if I can tell you what I want." Not without sounding like a lovesick sap who needed to back away from the Hallmark channel, anyway.
They could function without him, but Steve wasn't sure they could thrive. The team was Tony's baby, and even when Steve disagreed vehemently about his leadership, he was an integral part of it.
But Tony was invited, and Tony’s the only one of them who actually knows the man they’re meant to be keeping at the party so that Clint and Natasha can break into his apartment and steal back some SHIELD technology, so Tony gets to have fun and Steve gets to pass the hors d’oeuvres, just in case Tony needs backup.
Steve felt guilty about it sometimes, knowing how hard food had sometimes been to come by in his younger days, but since the serum, he needed a lot of food to keep going. At a place like this, where the food all came in artfully arranged small servings, it was embarrassing to have to admit that no, that really wasn't going to work for him.
"Let me worry about that, okay? It's not going to be a problem. Our only concern now is coming up with our story. People are going to want to know all the details of how we got together."
"He's not," Steve said, before Tony could answer. He wasn't, of course. They were using Tony's limo--well, officially it belonged to Stark Industries, but it was the one always available for his use. "I'll make sure he gets home all right."
Rhodey took a few steps closer to Tony, close enough that he could put a hand on Tony's shoulder. "Yeah?"
"It's really not," Tony said firmly. "It's better than 'Rum and Coca-Cola,' but it's still a terrible song."
Steve was sure that anyone who saw them would assume Tony was spinning some lascivious fantasy for him.
"I'm serious about tomorrow," Tony said. "I get you for two days, no interruptions unless the world is ending."
doing it your way," Tony said, and then gasped, almost soundlessly, when the head of Steve's cock found his prostate.
But he usually waited for Steve to come to him. It made him look less needy. Anyway, they'd never actually had sex in a situation where one of them couldn't walk away afterward. Awkward mornings-after weren't Tony's style, and they didn't seem to be Steve's, either.
To be honest, given his track record, "occasional fuckbuddies and even more occasional friends" stood a better chance of long term success than anything else, anyway.
"I didn't go look in your sketchbook to confirm it," Tony said, "but you never mind showing people what you're drawing, and even when I asked, you brushed me off. I made some assumptions."
"Once you came," Tony said after a moment, "I'd take it nice and slow for a while. Who knows, I might never get the chance to do this again. It's not likely--I'd make sure that you enjoyed yourself, after all--but who knows? You might decide this isn't for you."
"I, uh. I want you inside me," Steve said, glad Tony wasn't here to see how red his face was. "But you're not here, so…"
He doesn’t like undercover work at the best of times, and he likes it even less when his disguise is a box of dark-brown hair dye, a pair of what Clint called “hipster glasses,” and the white shirt and black pants that all the catering staff at this party are wearing.
your cock. Putting my finger in your mouth, so you could get it good and wet for me, knowing that in another few seconds, it was going to be inside you."
“What do you want me to do about it?” Steve had always heard that you shouldn't try to wake sleepwalkers, and if that was what was needed, JARVIS could have done it himself. “Can’t you turn off the elevator? Lock the doors, so he can’t go anywhere and hurt himself?”
"You should have told me," Steve insisted. He hadn't moved his hands away, and Tony wished he'd dig his fingers into Tony's shoulders and add a new layer of marks on top of the ones from last night.
Then it was time for the awards presentation, and not long after that, Steve and Tony were heading out into the night.
But Steve kept kissing Tony while he fucked him, slow and steady, his lips brushing over Tony's eyelids, his cheeks, his forehead. When he kissed Tony's mouth, Tony parted his lips for Steve, welcoming him in.
"You didn't think about marrying Pepper?" Steve asked, and then wished he hadn't. Tony had been fairly close-mouthed about what happened with Pepper, and Steve had always respected that.
But there were plenty of conservative groups who'd booked him to speak--the publicists had rejected a lot of requests, because the groups had been too blatantly terrible, but these were the respectable ones--and they were canceling as fast as they could, especially after soundbites from Steve's morning-show interview had gone national.
But he'd still managed to drink more than the food could counteract. Every time he thought he might be sobering up a little, Steve would casually touch him, or he'd laugh at something Tony said, or the light would hit him in just the right way to make his eyes look impossibly blue, and Tony would pick up his glass again.
"Of course." He didn't always take orders from Tony, but when it was about calibrating high-tech cross-dimensional communications equipment, he'd have been stupid not to.
Steve would probably want to wear a suit and tie to a lot of places where Tony wouldn't; he sometimes still had trouble adjusting to how casual people's clothing choices were in the twenty-first century.
To the best of his knowledge, they were New York's only superhero couple, not that Steve was comfortable with the word "superhero" in the first place. But he guessed that made them the most famous one.
"Besides," Tony said, "Steve and I are going to be dating. This won't work if we're not very public with our relationship. As far as the public sees, this would look exactly the same if this was genuine. And it's nobody's business what happens, or doesn't happen, behind closed doors."
For a little while, neither of them spoke, except in short exclamations or brief words of encouragement. Tony's vocabulary seemed to be reduced to profanity, but Steve didn't mind; the words sounded joyful--filthy and desperate and urgent and practically thrumming with happiness.
Of course he'd be concerned about Tony doing something that was likely to lead to scandal. Until very recently, Tony's public image had involved equal parts of brilliance and scandal, and it was only natural that Tony's best friend wouldn't want to see him slide back into that.
Tony tossed back the last of his drink and signaled to the bartender for another. "I," he said, maybe a little too loudly, "am having a great time."
"Of course," Steve promised. "Every day, if you want. Or at least every day that I'm not out fighting HYDRA, or the Masters of Evil, or whoever else is causing trouble."
They didn't have anywhere to be, and they weren't likely to be interrupted, not with the storm howling outside. They couldn't even get away from one another when it was done, so there was no reason to rush this.
"Not many, no." Steve looked down at his hand, pushing his fingers into Tony one last time and watching as they slid in easily past the second knuckle.
"Fine," Steve said, suspecting that if he could get Tony to lie down for a while, he'd fall asleep anyway. "Then we can go to plan B, which involves getting you into bed, getting most of your clothes off, and then seeing if I can literally kiss every inch of your skin."
Instead, of course, Steve pulled out, then shifted his weight so that he could take hold of Tony's cock and stroke him until his back arched and he thrust helplessly into Steve's fist, then came.
Every photo was carefully chosen, Steve knew. They were presenting an image of a couple who were happily in love with one another, who were enjoying their newfound chance to be together in public.
"Open the door," Steve ordered again, "or I'll break it down." They were reinforced blast doors; Steve couldn't break through them himself, but they weren't Hulk-proof.
He'd never claimed to be a genius the way Tony and Bruce were, but he'd always thought of himself as reasonably smart. Better at some things than others, but at least average.
Steve must have grimaced, because Tony laughed. "But that was before I was settled down with someone who definitely isn't a party animal. Don't make that face, Rogers, I was just going to suggest we go get coffee."
"Thanks," Steve said, and slid into his usual place at the table, right next to where Tony's coffee mug was already sitting even if Tony was at the counter unloading containers of food.
"I'm not sure which is worse," Tony said. He wasn't looking at Steve, but Steve was pretty sure that Tony wasn't just talking to himself. "The times when I just relive what actually happened, or the times when I get 3D surround-sound versions of what would have happened if I'd failed."
Tony had had time to think, after all, and he could have decided that this would be a mistake. That no matter how lonely and bored he was now, if they were ever able to bring him home, Steve could be a complication he didn't want in his life.
Tony didn't know why he'd expected Clint to be helpful. Besides, there was always a good chance that whatever horrible thing he'd done to Steve had been after Steve had gotten him up to his apartment. But he had to be sure. "What about Steve?"
It still didn't mean that Tony had meant any of what he'd said or done when they were pretending to be together. But Steve had refused to consider even the possibility that he'd meant any of it, and... that might have been a mistake.
"Is it that late already?" Tony glanced at his phone. "Guess it is. Thanks, J. Let her know I'm on my way down."
Besides, it didn't matter what Steve saw now. They were going to die here, and compared to death, what was a little embarrassment?
While just coming out would do some of that, it'd have much more impact if there was another person involved, someone Steve could have a very public relationship with. He knew how some people thought; they'd be able to look past Steve's sexuality as long as he kept it completely private.
"I didn't run away screaming," Steve said. His expression had softened. He still looked annoyed with Tony, but it was the usual kind of annoyance, the "you're impossible, Tony Stark," that Tony always let himself believe had some fondness behind it, too.
"You weren't supposed to have an idea, that was the point," Tony said, wincing at how loud his voice came out.
Tony smirked at him, then reached in his wallet and threw some cash on the table. "I hope you're done eating."
That was true, and it was something to consider. He probably wouldn't have thought of this if they'd gotten together in a more conventional way--and just about every way was more conventional than "so, one of us was stuck in another dimension…"--but now he let himself think of calling Tony when he was out on a SHIELD op, or Tony calling when he was away on Stark Industries business, and smiled.
"How would you get me to do that?" Steve's hand was moving faster now, as Tony kept talking, describing every way he wanted to touch Steve.
Steve's earpiece had gone on the fritz during the battle. That was how he'd gotten that bloody nose and split lip; he hadn't heard Natasha's warning in time.
He pocketed his phone, stood up, and brushed a couple of wayward muffin crumbs from his shirt. Then he frowned, looking at Steve for a few long seconds. "Gotta keep in practice. You never know who's watching," he said, which left Steve bewildered, until Tony bent down and kissed him. Not even on the cheek; it was a quick kiss, but on the mouth, like none of this was a pretense at all.
"Glad you approve," Tony said. "So yeah, I'd spend some time doing that. Nice and slow, because I want to drive you crazy. Maybe two fingers, if you're very good."
Tony had just pierced the yolk of one of the eggs when Steve came back in with a thermal carafe and two mugs. He poured out a cup of coffee and set it on Tony's nightstand, then poured some in the second cup and took a drink.
"They're basically humanoid," Tony said. The people pictured in the illustrations were built along sturdier lines than the average Earth person; the clothing in the bunk room and the scale of the furniture suggested they were probably taller, too. There were a few other subtle differences in the illustrations, too--something that looked like scales or a feathery pattern on the face, hard to be sure with a very basic drawing--but yeah, these were basically people.
He probably just had earphones in and didn't hear Steve's knock. He did that sometimes. Sound traveled weirdly in the tower--there was no reason Steve should be able to hear Hulk's snoring in his own quarters, for example, but he could--and more than one of them had complained that Tony's music kept them awake when they were working late.
He'd also have preferred a good steak to the three small beef medallions on his plate, but at least they'd had food on the menu that he recognized and knew he'd like.
He didn't look to see if anyone on the internet was speculating that there was a rift between him and Tony. He got enough questions about Tony, or his relationship with Tony, during his various appearances that he assumed people understood that the two of them couldn't be together constantly. In his answers, he tried to give the impression that he was happy, although he missed Tony when they had to be apart.
Steve didn't remember that, either. But then he looked more closely at the background. Wasn't that... yes, it was. That was last month, out on Long Island, when they'd had to stop that guy who had somehow managed to create a dinosaur army. (Well, six dinosaurs. When they were about fifteen tons of angry lizard each, six was an army.)
the talking, but if I need to hear from you, you'll know. Besides, 'silent' might not have been the right word." Tony's voice slipped into a lower, rougher register. "You can make all the noise you want, sweetheart."
His suit had night vision, of course, but he wanted to make sure he had as much power in reserve as possible, just in case they ran into more of those animals that had been their welcoming committee when they'd fallen through that portal from Times Square.
Right now, he still hated Tony's driving, but he wasn't going to complain about it. Not if it got him back to the tower, and therefore to a place where he was actually going to be allowed to touch Tony, even a minute or two faster.
Steve nodded. "There are some posters on the wall over there. I can't read them, but there are some pictures. I get the feeling this is some kind of base for a work crew, maybe?"
The bartender seemed satisfied; she set Tony's drink in front of him and moved away to serve someone else.
Steve had intended to repeat a version of the statement Tony had made at the first event; it had become their standard answer to that kind of question.
The next week, Tony had had a speaking engagement at MIT, and Steve had gone along with him. Afterward, they'd toured the campus, Tony pointing out various buildings and telling stories about himself and Rhodey as undergraduates.
"I'll keep that in mind. Thanks," he added, as Tony took the plate and set it down on the table, freeing Steve's hands so he could set down the coffee. "I was getting hungry and thought you might be, too."
He turned his hand over so that he could hold Tony's, and Tony squeezed his hand lightly. Steve was sure that his smile looked ridiculous, but then again, he was allowed, right? As far as these people knew, he and Tony were in love, and it was natural for Steve to be looking at him fondly.
Tony had started coming along with him on those outings. Once he'd even taken pictures of a painting and texted them to Pepper, who promptly bought the painting in question for her apartment, so he was even paying at least a little attention to what they were doing.
They didn't count, but Steve was determined to make sure this one did. His hands on Tony's shoulders kept him pinned against the wall as he kissed Tony, again and again, because he finally had Tony and he wasn't sure he was ever going to be able to get enough of him.
"I thought we could use another pair of hands," Steve said, with an innocent expression that might have fooled someone who wasn't Tony. "I didn't know the kids were going to show up."
"So now I've answered your question. Still want to talk to me about anything?" Tony seemed to shrink into himself a little, or maybe it was just that he wasn't projecting his personality into the room as forcefully as he usually did. He'd turned off the "I'm Tony Stark, look at me!" field he generally surrounded himself with.
"Yeah, I think that's a solid enough set of parameters that I can code it in," he said. "When's our next team training?"
"At least at the moment, I don't mind that you're not controlling your impulses," Steve admitted, though he pushed Tony's hand aside so that he could work on undoing Tony's pants.
Steve just hated having to say that, because in a perfect world, he'd have been able to give the PR team a better picture of him and Tony, and tell them to send it out with the same tags. Clint had explained "couple names" to him back when Tony and Pepper had still been together. "IronCaptain" wasn't great, but at least it didn't remind Steve of pizza.
He'd assumed Tony wouldn't mind, because it wasn't like Tony was ever a big fan of sticking to a plan.
--and then an alarm went off, and whatever they'd intended to say to one another had to be put off, because Steve had to give the call to assemble.
Natasha worked something close to magic with a make-up kit, and now the planes and angles of his face look just different enough that people might look at him and think, “That guy looks kind of like a dark-haired Captain America,” and not, “That’s Captain America, passing the miniature pumpkin and goat cheese empanadas,” but he still feels exposed.
They were going to have to get better at talking to one another, Steve realized, but maybe not right at this precise moment.
So yes, they bickered, and yes, Steve canceled on dinner because SHIELD had a mission for him, and yes, Tony just plain forgot that they had plans at least once a week, and yes, if they had actually been a couple, the make-up sex would have been both regular and spectacular.
But also, the lab was the place where Tony was the most himself, and Steve wanted that. Steve wanted, loved, everything about Tony, even the parts that frustrated him--but Tony Stark in his element, giving his brilliant mind free rein in his workshop? Steve didn't really understand how anyone could see Tony like that and not fall at least a little bit in love with him.
Tony didn't laugh. "Fair enough," he said. "I have to have something to look forward to when I get back, don't I?"
Tony, who Steve… "Then I guess I'll start with 'I'm attracted to you, too.'" Everything else could wait a little longer. Not too long, because Steve had enough of waiting until things were too late before he said anything, but it was obviously too early for any grand declarations.
"Let me do it." Steve had already washed himself off, Tony noticed, and now he turned his attention to Tony, using warm water and the sponge to wash him clean.
He'd have time to figure that out later. He didn't want to think about having time to figure that out later, because he didn't want to think about how they were stuck here.
"I've had worse," Steve said, and he probably didn't mean it to sound like he was scornful of anyone who hadn't lived in an army tent in the middle of a war zone.
Even that might have been too much, because Tony turned to look out the window. "Great," he said, but there was a note of tension in his voice that made Steve wish he'd said no.
That didn't mean it wasn't risky, but they had no idea how long it would be before the weather cleared up. They might need a source of food, especially if they wanted to have the strength to travel.
Instead, he comes out of the stairwell into the building lobby as SHIELD arrives, just in time to throw out his arm to stop the panicking man who thinks running back up the stairs is going to get him away from a team of SHIELD agents.
"We're going to be tired tomorrow," Tony said, grinning. "And I'm going to be in the mood to lounge around and make out with you and probably drag you into my lab so you can draw pictures of me while I work." Then he brightened a little more. "Also, you're totally allowed to draw pictures of me while we're lounging around and making out."
Steve tried not to laugh. He almost succeeded; it came out sounding like a snort. "So it's my fault?"
If it had been Clint, for example, that people were speculating about, then he'd have asked Clint to pretend to be dating him, even though he had no interest in dating Clint.
But the way Tony kept grinning at him, with equal parts amusement and heat behind it, called for a change of plans.
So even though they'd known one another long enough that the "getting to know you" part of dating wasn't strictly necessary, they were going to do it anyway, just so Steve knew how very seriously Tony was taking this.
Tony sputtered with laughter, and Steve smiled to himself, listening to Tony making plans for them, and realizing that for the first time since he'd come out of the ice, he was looking forward to
"Drink some water before you go to sleep," Steve suggested once Tony was sitting on the couch, and turned to let himself out.
They all cleaned up pretty well. Sam looked awkward and a little shy, but then, he was young and this was his first event like this. Clint had actually made an effort; his tux wasn't even purple, though his tie and cummerbund were. Natasha was even more beautiful than usual in her formal gown and elegant hairstyle.
Steve knew better than that, really. Of course it meant something. It meant that Tony felt the need to put some distance between himself and Steve. Not just in public, where it would have made sense since they'd just "broken up," but in the tower as well. It meant that even though Tony was a fairly hands-on person, even before all of this, he didn't want to be close enough to Steve that they could touch.
"I won't," he said. "I want to remember this." He was about to apologize again when he caught sight of the glint in Steve's eyes.
"Clint and Thor both swear that a big fried breakfast is the best remedy for a hangover," Steve said, "but there's also some plain toast if you don't think you can handle that." He set the tray down on the bed.
So it was a relief when Tony called for a car, and they sank back into the air-conditioned back seat. Happy Hogan wasn't one of the people who got to know this was fake--that was only the Avengers and Colonel Rhodes--so Steve put his arm around Tony's shoulders, though he stayed quiet. It had been a long day; they were tired. It was okay for them not to talk.
"I like you in one piece," Steve said. Hugging Tony when Tony was in the armor was... well, not completely out of the question, but left a lot to be desired. Instead, he cupped Tony's face with his hands, leaning in and kissing him until they were both breathless.
And his memories of their time together were profound ones, so... Who was he kidding. He was completely losing this battle trying to fight Bucky.
"Like I need my team's ego to skyrocket any further," Fury mutters, but just when Phil wants to take it back, he adds. "But if even I think it's a cool memory to have a poster of the team to keep, I can't even begin to imagine the young girls of the school will feel about the idea. Just a side note, Coulson, if we're going to do this..."
"I'm unfit to be a parent," he told her the truth. "And I'm fighting a very bad man, so I'm quite busy."
"Why thank you," Steve couldn't help but note, and wanted to follow Bucky to their room when Pepper put a hand on his.
But Steve stayed - holding Tony in a tight hug through the whole thing. And that was all. He only left when he got Tony some food, yet he didn’t touch Tony even once in a suggestive way. Tony didn’t know about any Alpha who could stay in the same room with an Omega in Heat - even on suppressants. It was a recipe for disaster.
He seemed so genuinely happy to show him off, to have someone and let the others know as well, eliciting some jokes from them that were teasing, but not malicious, that even Bucky found himself more relaxed about it.
He stopped looking for his soulmate because he thought it was better if he never knew them. He had nightmares that he'd become like Schmidt, keeping an innocent woman chained to his person while he would slowly but surely destroy her, just because he was Tony Stark.
Without sex, Loki could only siphon some of Tony's darkness slowly, incrementally away, with care. With the physical side of things, with touch, he could directly take everything as if it was offered on a plate, and it was... addictive. Like a drug for humans. And Loki was powerless against the pull it had on him, just as Tony probably was, the only difference being that Loki knew better, and he had the power to stop.
"Quill, you look like a tomato," Rocket was only ever too happy to declare. "And no worries, we can get you in as Groot's plus one, if you wanna join us as all."
“And I was also thinking what would happen if we wouldn't let the doctors take the blood of the pups when they were born,” Steve added.
Even though the medicine was available to hide people's gender once again, now people weren't taking it. Many found a mate and bonded traditionally when the shortages hit, and just as many wanted to do now the same. Times were changing, and maybe this time not necessarily for the worst.
"Not that's any of your business, but your annoying little planet grew on me, and now I have a pretty good reason to try to keep it safe," Loki told him, but Stark attacked nevertheless.
This way though? Well, it's not like he wasn't watched 24/7, and he was free to do as he pleased, but he'd take what he could get.
But just when he thought it was such a good joke to turn into one, and get close to Steve, seeing if he could induce an allergic reaction, the Captain just picked him up, placing him on a pillow, and started stroking him without a warning.
"For someone who is supposed to be the Liesmith, you're a surprisingly terrible liar," Banner said. "And don't you think I know why you're saying that?"
He began chest compressions and used Mjolnir as a defibrillator. But all his limbs were shaking, so Strange took pity on him, taking over the compressions while Steve only held the hammer that much tighter.
"Because I wasn't sure you didn't just find yourself attractive. I mean, you kissed back, but maybe it was also because of the unique situation we've been in, and you could have been curious, that's all..."
"I think I'm going to be just fine. Seeing the Hulk from a different perspective and talking to him helped."
"I'm glad to hear that. Maybe there's still some hope left for him yet," Thor announced as if Loki would care for his opinion regarding his future.
"I'm like Batman," he told Tony. "Only, way too cooler. And I've almost blown up something before JARVIS helped, it's like..."
"Not as much as I missed you. And I love you oh so very much, but we can't have this. Not just yet. Maybe in the future, given this vision? But now... don't make our departure any harder than it already is."
By then he was quite determined to fight his way out if he had to, but losing his temper calmed Steve down. Maybe because he saw how seriously Bucky meant it, but he stepped away from the door.
Also, if he could be the one to save the world, he'd do it (he had been doing that for a while now). But he didn't want to give Strange the satisfaction, since it was all the wizard's fault.
Even when he opened his eyes with great effort, he couldn't place his surroundings but managed to find his clothes and a joined lavatory where he could take care of his business and drink some water.
And it was the only thing that kept his mind from turning on itself. So he designed small things now - useless stuff, really, and ever careful that it should have no possible application in connection to Omegas, but he always feared he missed something and it gave him nightmares.
"I do, it's just..." Steve automatically corrected him, before realizing that in itself, that was also an admission, not just the comforting he meant it as.
"We can remedy that as well. And Pep, just to show you," Tony said, and not only didn't fight Bucky's hold on him but made a show out of kissing him, not just a peck on the lips either.
And when Steve tried to tell Thor how it wasn't so, Thor didn't listen, just insisted on how they should return.
Except, they were sparring and Stark got the upper hand and used this anyway to kiss him first, then proved to Strange how it was a very good idea indeed.
And maybe Steve wasn't as unaffected as he first thought either because he could barely sleep without Thor snoring near, and couldn't seem to think clearly now every time they talked.
"Even now, when I mention it, you can't even acknowledge it just even if for one joke so that we could move on pretending as if nothing happened," and Rhodey seemed more disappointed than upset, but still was about to leave Tony's workshop just the same. "And that's not even the worst part, Tony, but how I don't know if you genuinely can't even guess how it makes me feel, or you just simply don't care."
"If I can't speak properly, the speech recognition still should work at least until I can switch to manual mode. I set up a machine learning rig to learn human speech that's not quite legible but has some meaning. You'd be surprised how many people upload videos of their
He scheduled the "date" on a day Steve was teaching combat to his kids the whole day, but then, he was barely finished in the toilet with the handsome stranger when Steve appeared, fuming.
"I don't think Barton would forgive me as easily as Thor, no offense. And..." he was about to lie through his teeth how he hated every minute in Steve's company, just to have the last word, but when he looked at the Captain, and he looked truly sad to see him go, he couldn't.
"Um, what just happened?" Tony's mind seemed to reset. Not the usual way he reacted to a kiss like that, but it was also anything but ordinary that Rhodey would kiss him. "Am I dreaming?"
And the teachers loved the protege, Ronan so much that even when Quill tried to use a teacher as cover one time, thinking surely Ronan at least wouldn’t hurt him in front of one, Ronan did the same and the teacher pretended not to notice. Or maybe it was because of the generous donation Ronan’s parents were making so he couldn’t get in trouble but the result was the same. Quill wasn’t safe anywhere.
"I am never going to understand why anyone would call himself 'Killer Shrike,'" Tony said, "but yeah, go on."
Somehow, someone had gotten past tower security, past JARVIS, past those doors, and past Tony himself. Steve wasn't going to stand around arguing with Tony's AI about what to do next.
He wasn't supposed to keep dreaming about it, seventy years later. So no, he didn't want to tell Tony about the nightmares, but he also didn't want Tony to think that Steve was judging him for not immediately getting over flying into that wormhole.
Even if the way Steve kept looking at him made him think that maybe, just maybe, it'd be okay if he did.
"I'm going to hold you to that," Tony said. "Not that I'll know if it's 'every day.' There aren't really days here."
Steve's lips were a little chapped and a bit dry, and the kiss was soft and careful, which was not actually anything like any of the first kisses Tony had ever imagined with Steve. There was a lot of him being shoved against the wall and thoroughly kissed in those fantasies, but it didn't matter, because this also worked.
"We can take our time if you want, but eventually there's going to need to be something more than kissing." Tony gave him an exaggerated wink, and Steve laughed again.
Tony wasn't in the habit of showing up at Steve's door, period. If he needed to see Steve, he usually asked JARVIS to have Steve meet him in the lounge, or in Tony's lab, or one of the training rooms. But he definitely didn't just turn up unannounced.
That was the kind of cause Steve wanted to support. It also sounded like the kind of cause that would infuriate bigots. Even the more "tolerant" ones, who thought people like Steve should be allowed to exist, and even to have relationships, didn't like the thought that Steve might marry another man.
"I'm sorry," Steve said again, as Tony let himself be hustled out, but he wasn't sure if Tony heard him.
Tony just lay there, trying not to think. Not thinking at all was impossible for him, but he tried not to think about Steve, anyway. He thought about a lot of things, projects he was never going to finish now, things he was never going to get to do.
"It'd be worth it for the right person, don't get me wrong," Tony said. "But when all I wanted was sex--that's not worth the complications, even if that makes me sound 'cold' to you."
