"What in the hell kind of file is this?" Peter murmured as he blinked again, allowing his vision to relax into the honeycomb-like state that it tended towards when he was tired. The technical term for it was compound vision, which was commonly found in insects—although not spiders, funnily enough—and Peter usually hated it as it often gave him headaches if he didn't get his glasses on in time, but now…
A second later his monitor lit up, displaying what appeared to be nothing more than a sharp gust of wind followed immediately by the drone shot, followed by another strong gust.
"Tony!" Steve yelped, rereading the sentence again just to make sure he wasn't seeing things. "Look—!"
“Steve, it’s okay if you wanna kiss me,” Tony murmured as his hands came to rest on Steve’s biceps.  “I—”
"As long as you wash your hands when you come back inside!" Steve called after him, earning a breathless, "Uh huh!" in return.
"That's a good boy," Grandma murmured. She smoothed the hair from Peter's forehead, carefully cupping his cheek. "Let's get your teeth brushed, all right?"
“All right,” Steve said, searching his muddled brain files for any previous reference to a Doctor List, and coming up empty.  “So, why am I here?”
"And Dr Erskine was able to overrule all four of the previous rejections?" asked Davis. "Just like that?"
"Yep," Peter said proudly. "Including orbital maintenance and calculating the go/no-go points, so if it works, it should pretty much eliminate the possibility of human error."
"Steve!" Tony cried as Steve stroked him, gripping his hip with his other hand as Tony's movements began to falter. "Honey, I'm—!"
"Override Hufflepuff sixteen," Peter said firmly, hmphing as he heard the telltale blip that indicated his override had taken hold. "Now, please, when Mrs Stacy arrives at the Tower with Gwen's brothers, please allow them access to the penthouse, okay? Tell the boys that they can play with my Legos while they're waiting."
“Mmm,” Tony grumbled, rolling his eyes.  He should’ve known that Obie’s “urgent matter” would be about something ridiculous that was still over three months away.
Raising the container, Pietro leaned in closer, squinting at what was inside, which, if Tony didn't know any better, appeared to be a human, dressed in some kind of goofy Halloween costume.
"Oh, shit!" cried Peter as a deafening cracking noise suddenly split the air, the same exact sound that he'd heard up at the Compound when he and Papa were waterskiing, right before he was pulled under the water. Twisting around, Peter let out a shriek as he saw the ice start to split, the crack growing wider and wider as it approached him.
"He's gonna be fine," Steve said, more for himself than anyone else. "Once he wakes up, he'll be right back to his old self."
"Well…" Steve trailed off, his nervousness evident even thousands of kilometres away in space. "I was—I was gonna wait until I got home to ask you this, but… just in case, I wanted to—"
"Then I suggest you get ready to go, but make it look like official Stark Industries business," said Sam. "Which means taking the SI jet, no visible armour, etc."
“I love you too, honey,” he murmured.  Then he pressed a soft kiss to Steve’s lips and stepped back, taking his hand.  “What do you say we go change into some more comfortable clothes and then go pick up our kid, yeah?”
"Holy shit," Dad said slowly, his hand holding the tablet dropping to his lap. "Those goddamn sons of bitches are really going for it."
separate paternity tests at Howard’s insistence, Peter Edwin Stark was entitled to a share of Stark Industries equal to that of Tony’s, and that was something that Obadiah was apparently not prepared to allow.
"Aw, c'mon, Bucky," said Sam from Bucky's opposite side. "You know the dude's just trying to warm up a bit more. These baseball players aren't used to playing in such cold weather."
Unfortunately, the fact that Bucky was due to be discharged from the hospital sometime in the next two or three days meant that they had to coordinate Peter's transfer over to Ma's house sooner rather than later. As much as Steve trusted Sharon, neither Steve nor Tony wanted her to have to be solely responsible for Peter's safety, especially since her cover depended on her continuing her job as normal and Peter wasn't her only patient. Peter, of course, had tried to convince them that he would be fine where he was but Steve and Tony weren't having it, finally forcing Tony to use the "because I said so" excuse to convince him to cooperate.
Two things that Steve had never dared to hope he would have, and now the two things that he wanted more than anything else.
"Oh God, it hurts!" Peter cried, fumbling as he tried to slip his mask back on. "Please, make it stop!"
Bartlett's eyes flicked briefly from Steve to Tony and back to Steve again before nodding towards his two partners. The two men started to approach Steve from opposite sides, almost as though as they were trying to corner him.
Once again Gwen's cheeks flushed that deep pink colour, and she looked down at her tray. "Well, you're the first boy I've ever had over to the house, so… I think part of it was Dad just trying to scare you a bit. Seeing if you were… worthy of me or something."
"Oh," she said on a gasp, her hand reaching for him before abruptly pulling back. "Is—is it okay if I hold his hand, Captain? I promise I'll be careful, I just—"
"Beats me, but you know what Colonel O'Brien always says about bugging out early, so we probably should wait till we hear something official," answered Joseph. He sucked in a deep breath as he checked his fuel gauge, located right next to the printed photograph of his wife. "Just hope he doesn't take too long, I'm already almost running on fumes."
"Do you know when he's coming back yet?" asked Gwen. "He's been gone for a while already, hasn't he?"
Slowly, Peter released his grip on the table, flexing his stiff fingers. "Um… well, that's a bit surprising I guess, seeing as how adamant he was that the Spider-Man was some kind of menace to society."
"Yeah, buddy, I'm here," Tony said, gently stroking his cheek. "Everything's okay, Pete. You're safe now."
Howard nodded, his expression almost stunned as he gestured towards Sharon. "Ms Carter, if you will?"
"What's the big deal?" Steve exclaimed. "Tony, in case you haven't noticed, you're a pretty big deal to me! And you know I don't like it when you keep secrets from me!"
"Guys, ladies, this is it," he began. "All our lives have been leading to this single point in time, converging right here, on this very moment. You see, for over twenty-eight years the citizens of our country have been nothing but pawns being moved across a massive chessboard, positioned to protect the king and queen. Only in this game, there’s never a chance to actually win because the people playing keep changing the rules. Field borders are redrawn, goalposts are moved, and stakes are changed almost constantly as more and more of the pawns, knights, and bishops are sacrificed." Steve paused, glancing around his circle of teammates who were all intently listening.
And then there was the conversation he and Tony had once had about Steve's serum procedure. Tony had questioned Steve about it purely out of his own scientific curiosity, but now Steve was regretting how candid he'd been with his descriptions. The pain that Steve had endured during his procedure had been excruciating, not something that he would wish on anyone, and he had explained that to Tony—and to Peter, for that matter—not even considering the possibility of their current circumstances.
"No, I don't, little guy," Papa answered. "According to JARVIS, this Scott Lang fellow was kind of a modern-day Robin Hood, stealing money from wealthy executives who had cheated their customers and returning it to the customers. He was recently released from prison."
CW: Steve experiences a short flashback in his chapter, and there is also a very brief mention of another character’s suicidal thoughts.  Please be safe 💗
"May as well just keep going," Peter muttered. He reached for his bag of peanut m&ms, popping three into his mouth as he opened the next file.
It got so bad on one particularly awful night that Tony broke down, begging Steve to call someone, a doctor or someone at the VA who could maybe come and talk to him.  But Steve adamantly refused.  He’d already tried that.  Already tried talking with doctors and counsellors and other vets, and it had only made things worse.
“They’re here, Tony!” Steve rasps, gasping in relief as he’s finally able to peel open his eyes.  “Our team, they’re here, and they’re gonna get us outta here, and—”  He breaks off, overcome as he threads his fingers through the icy strands of Tony’s hair.  “And then, once Dr Cho says it’s okay, I’m gonna take you out on a real date and show you such a good time that you’ll never forget it.”
Finally, a soft smile stretched across Tony's lips, followed by an amused chuckle. "You're such a sap."
"Pretty sure it's one of those things where if you have to ask, you can't afford it, honey," Tony murmured. "But why does it matter?"
"Hey," James suddenly cut in from the doorway. He jerked his head, indicating for them to follow him.
“Okay, so… are ya gonna just sit there and stare at me?” Tony had finally asked, crossing his arms.  “‘Cause in case you haven’t heard, we’ve got a crisis going down in Sokovia at the moment, and—”
"No, it's not," said Uncle Bucky. "But then, neither's what you're going through. It's all just a bunch of bullshit."
"Uh huh," Peter murmured, winding his arms around Steve's waist so quickly and forcefully that Steve had to grab onto the counter to steady himself. "I'm just glad Dad's got you to take care of him now. Whenever he was sick before he just toughed it out 'cause he didn't have anyone to take care of him. He'd never let me see him, 'cause he was afraid I'd get sick too, and I always got so lonely 'cause I missed him."
"Tony!" Steve said sharply, startling Tony as he wrapped his arms around his rigid body, pulling him tightly against his chest. Tony tried to fight him at first, not quite awake enough to understand what was going on until he felt Steve's fingers weave into his hair and his warm breath on his ear. "Shh, sweetheart, it's okay. It's okay, I've got you."
“Yeah, I’ve been wanting to come in here ever since I saw the flyer on the lamppost by my school,” said Peter.  “I love bookstores!”
looks. "Well, what're you thinking, Sam? My husband's been held captive by a bunch of raving Nazi lunatics for almost a month, and now my son's got it into his head that he's the only one who can save him. How in the hell do you
"Cause it's for the best. At least for now," Phillips said firmly. "Now, how much longer till the next satellite deploys?"
And despite Bucky's concern that falling in love would somehow make him less of a pilot, it hadn't at all turned out to be the case. If anything, it had made both Bucky and Sam even better.
He had honestly been surprised that he'd been able to sleep at all, especially since his—and Tony's as well—sleep had been so horrible for the last several days. He'd been prepared to lie awake the whole night, to just hold Tony close as his mind ran though their complicated plan over and over again. It wasn't until Tony had already fallen asleep and he'd been just on the cusp of it that Steve realised there really was no point for him to dwell on it. Their plan, although complicated, was sound, with every person involved committed to it one hundred percent.
"Holy shit," Tony breathed, his eyes briefly fluttering shut. "So then you've pretty much decided that being sneaky is the only way we're gonna be able to do this."
Tony watched as the photographer gulped and nodded, backing away just as another leapt forward and snapped a picture right in Peter's face.
Uncle Bucky's lower lip started to shake as he reached his hand over to the notebook, his fingertips tracing along the outer pencilled lines.
Yet another slam of metal against metal followed immediately by a booming crashing noise, and Peter leaped from his high perch on the wall, landing gracefully on the hard concrete floor. Racing towards the raucous sounds of the fight, he arrived just in time to grab onto the fake Iron Man's arm and keep him from firing his repulsor at Papa, who was doubled over and clutching his side.
The fact that Peter seemed to have magically disappeared as soon as Doctor List and Wanda left his cell only served to prove that the edges of Steve's sanity were being slowly chipped away, leaving nothing but his demons behind.
"Gwen, honey, Colonel Rhodes is right," Stacy said gently. "You've helped us with so much already, but it's almost four in the morning and we should really be getting home now."
That at least got Steve to smile, however fleeting it was. In order to help combat Tony's irrational fear of the dark, he and Steve had started playing music in their room after the lights went out, courtesy of the hand-crank record player that Steve's mother had given him after his acceptance into the Air Corps. Steve had even taught Tony how to dance, a skill that Tony had always wished he'd been able to learn but could never find the time—or the right partner. Since Tony had moved in it had become a tradition of sorts for the two of them. He and Steve would return from saying goodnight to Peter at the hospital, grab some snacks from the mess hall, and then spend a good twenty or so minutes just slow-dancing together in the middle of the room, the music combined with Steve's closeness working to chase away the demons that Tony had always feared might attack him in the dark.
"Well, it may be how it is, but that doesn't mean any of us have to like it," said Papa. "So please, little guy, don't feel like you have to hide anything from Dad and me, okay? If you're struggling, we want to know so we can help you."
"They made you put the schematics on a public server, didn't they?" he asked, low and tight. "The Armed Services Committee? That's how they were able to get them?"
I can’t wait to see what you think!  Please don’t forget to hit the kudos button and leave me a comment! 💗
you feel so incredible," Steve choked out. He slid his arms underneath Tony and pulled him onto his lap, allowing his cock to slip in even further. Tony's chest was heaving by the time Steve was fully sheathed, and he buried his face into Steve's neck, clinging to him for dear life as Steve gripped his hips and began to move him up and down.
He surged forward then, catching Tony's lips in a desperate kiss as the three agents yanked on his arms, tearing him away. Tony immediately lunged for him, only to be stopped by Agent Bartlett's palm on his chest.
"Hey, buddy!" Tony murmured, his brown eyes shiny with tears as he took Peter's hand. "How're you feeling?"
“Pretty sure I never will be.”  Steve was just leaning down for another kiss when Peter reappeared from the back, groaning in mock-disgust.
It was just a bit weird for Peter to be surrounded by people again, after being forced to spend so much of his time alone. Even before his hospital stay he'd gotten used to being mostly alone. Grandpa had been there at the house, but during the day he was always either out wandering around or stocking up on his whisky, and didn't really pay much attention to Peter unless it was to tell him yet another story of how he used to work for the government, or chastise him for spending too much of his time drawing. And of course Dad had been there too, but with how overworked he always was Peter had been lucky to see him twice a day, in the early morning before he left for work, and at night just before curfew began.
"Ahahaha!" Steve heard from behind him, turning in a daze to find Bruce poking his head up out of his armour, laughing maniacally. "You guys are so screwed now!"
There's no way Tony would've survived. No way that either of them would be here now if it weren't for Steve.
A few swings later, Steve got his chance. As Rumlow attempted to pull back his right arm, Steve grabbed onto the gauntlet, ripping it off Rumlow's forearm and tossing it aside. Rumlow snarled as he popped a blade from the tip of his left gauntlet, swinging it wildly as Steve continued to dodge the repeated attempts, finally landing a particularly hard punch directly to Rumlow's kidney, sending him flying as he screamed in pain. Steve marched over to where he was sprawled out, writhing in the dirt, and grabbed onto the front of his uniform, hauling him up onto his knees.
Arriving back at the penthouse, Steve checked in on Tony—who was thankfully still asleep—before returning to his papers in the kitchen, managing to get the outline of another semi-decent plan worked out before Tony finally wandered in, bleary-eyed and yawning, just like Peter had been a couple hours before.
Steve sighed, shifting slightly on the bed. "Yeah, she was. One of the strongest people I've ever met. Besides you and Peter, of course."
“Well, I'm sure he’s keeping them well-entertained,” Tony said.  He gave the papers a quick flip-through as they walked towards his office, nodding in appreciation once they reached the door.  “Let’s hope we won’t need Happy, but it’s good to have him there just in case.”
"Which is probably why it's good that you're surrounded by distractions," Natasha said, smirking. "Right?"
"Dad!" Peter choked out, his vision already transforming into the honeycomb-like state it assumed when he could no longer keep his focus. "Dad, help!"
"Yeah," Peter murmured as he cupped her cheek in his palm. He leaned in, pressing their lips together in a kiss that instantly sent a burst of warm fuzzies scattering throughout his body, and had him panting by the time they broke apart.
"All right." Sucking in a deep breath as Bruce took off again—it was very unnerving for Steve to see an Iron Man armour on the field that wasn't being piloted by Tony—Steve braced himself as he looked up, his jaw dropping as he saw the same alien that he and Tony had fought against in New York step through the deactivated shield, right next to the female alien they spoke with before the start of the battle.
"Hey, buddy," Dad said, sounding so exhausted that a knot rose in Peter's throat. "You can probably figure out while I'm calling, yeah?"
Another gunshot flashed from deep inside just as Steve regained his footing, passing so closely to his nose that he felt the heat coming off the bullet as it zoomed by.
“Mmm.  Okay,” Tony said warily.  As soon as they entered the rather noisy pub, he leaned closer, whispering, “Seriously, hon.  If you're not feeling up to this tonight, we can always—”
"As you wish, sir," JARVIS replied. Bucky flinched when the scanning beam appeared, but thankfully it was over before anything else could happen.
"All right then," Rhodey said, clapping a hand on Tony's shoulder. "Then I suggest we let the guests get home and start packing, 'cause Tony and I should leave for D.C. before dawn."
good." He quickly pecked her lips again, hating the fact that he had to tear himself away from her. "I'll see you soon, okay?"
Peter frowned, trying really hard to not roll his eyes as he felt Gwen squeeze his hand. It was at least the third time in as many minutes that Ned had turned around to ask them some silly question, making it impossible for Peter and Gwen to hold any kind of meaningful conversation.
"Yeah, okay," Tony murmured. There was no way in hell he'd be able to rest with Steve out in space, and he knew Phillips knew it, but at least he was trying.
Another noise squeaked its way from Steve's throat, his lips pursing just enough for Tony to notice. Davis was actually going for the jugular, right there in front of God and everyone.
Ned quirked an eyebrow. "Oh. Well, that makes sense." He squinted, leaning closer to his screen. "Where are you guys right now, anyway?"
replied the nurse. As soon as Dr Goldman was out of sight, she turned to the respiratory therapist, who was still writing down Peter's vital signs. "
"Well, at least that's something," said Uncle James. He ran a palm down his face, his eyes narrowing as he looked at Peter.
Steve jerked awake as the early-morning Wakandan sunlight began streaming through the tall windows of Shuri's lab, letting out a soft groan as one particularly strong beam hit him directly in the face. He breathed in, rubbing at a stubborn crick in his neck as he reached for the glass of water Shuri had left for him on Tony's bedside table the night before, downing the whole thing in three large gulps. The cool liquid made him shiver as it made its way down his throat and into his completely empty stomach, earning a sharp glare when it growled in protest.
Natasha's grey eyes were glassy as she wrapped a large towel over her soaking wet clothes. "You don't need to thank me, Tony. Peter's the closest I'll ever get to having my own child, so… you'll never need to thank me for taking care of him."
"Ah, that's a yes," Tony said as he tapped the hologram back into place. "Just remember to keep the schematics of the chopper handy when you're rendering, yeah? Don't wanna get it built and then realise it won't fit, 'cause that would just be embarrassing."
"I'm sure Sam wouldn't mind helping you study, Buck," Steve said. He checked his orbital trajectory, gripping the stick with a firm hand as he readied his index finger over the power button. "All right. I'm coming up on the go/no-go point in five, four, three, two, one—"
“Good,” Fury said, just before the screen went blank.  As soon as he was gone, Tony stumbled backwards, barely grabbing onto the edge of the counter before his legs gave way and he crumpled into a heap on the floor.
"No, it's not, and you know it," Steve said, rather petulantly. "Being alone is the absolute last thing that you need right now, so I'm staying right here. You can ignore me all you want, but I'm not going anywhere."
With a shaky nod, Peter pursed his lips as he peeked over the edge of the platform, the cloak imitating his every movement. Tony could hear him muttering to himself as he took in the scene, thinking almost against his will of how proud Steve would be if he could see him.
"Steve, it's always helpful to get this stuff out, right?" Sam gently prodded. "It's not good for anyone to keep things bottled up, mainly 'cause then you're never sure when it's just gonna start bubbling over and make a huge mess."
"Not really, Tony." Steve pulled back, his hands cupping Tony's shoulders. "We have got to stick together on this stuff, okay? And that means we can't be hiding stuff from each other, especially stuff that could affect not only us, but the entire team. Okay? Please?"
“But—!” Peter said, even though deep down he knew JARVIS was right.  So far everything that he’d found could very easily be explained away by coincidence, or an accident, or just people being greedy.
"Tony? Oh, you're home. What're you doing in here?" Tony suddenly heard from the hallway. He whipped his head back to find his father leaning against the doorframe, tying the belt of his ugly-ass robe around his waist. "I'm trying to sleep, what's with all the racket?"
Pressing a quick kiss to Tony's forehead, Steve took his place on Peter's opposite side, laying down next to him and carefully draping his arm across his waist. Bruce, Natasha, Clint, and Bucky were all working in Tony's lab, already trying to figure out what had happened, but Steve knew they wouldn't bother them for awhile unless it became absolutely necessary.
Peter rolled his eyes, plopping back onto the floor. "Dad, I know that. But in all the times that I've been around Mr Stacy, I've never, ever had that ice-cubes-down-my-back feeling that I always get around the bad guys. Not even once, not even when he was ranting about the Avengers the very first time that I met him. So there's no way he could be a HYDRA agent, 'cause if he was, I'd know."

"So, does your family usually do anything special for Thanksgiving?" Gwen asked, peeking at Peter over the screen of her laptop. The two of them were sprawled across the floor in her living room surrounded by their schoolbooks, with Peter flat on his stomach balancing chemistry equations while Gwen sat at the coffee table, working on a paper for their history class. Peter had already finished his paper on food rationing in Europe during World War II, thanks to some inside information from Papa and Uncle Bucky.
"Please allow me to introduce the rest of our team, if you don't mind," Steve quickly said. He introduced each of the rest of them in turn, explaining once he was done that Bruce was currently working with Thor and his people in New Asgard and had been unable to attend.
"Then we must hold them off," T'Challa stated. "Evacuate the city. Engage all defences. We must not allow anyone to destroy our beloved home."
Searching the debris-laden battlefield, Steve located King T'Challa standing within a group of his warriors, all holding their body-length shields over their heads.
"No, no, it's okay," Tony said quickly. He reached for a bowl of chicken broth sitting on the bedside table, bringing it under Steve's chin. "Bruce says you've gotta drink this before you get anything else, even though it'll probably only last you about three minutes or so. But if you're able to hold it down okay, he'll bring you something more substantial when he comes back."
A flash of anger shot through Steve, and he was just about to retort when he felt Tony's fingers curl around his wrist.
"Peter knows to call us first," Dad said, rather shortly as he took Peter's backpack from Gwen and handed her the towel. "C'mon, buddy, let's get you home, yeah?"
Instead, Steve discovered only a few months before that the enemy he had sacrificed his life to destroy had apparently been in hiding ever since the war, just waiting for the right time to rear its ugly head.
as it sank into the icy Arctic water. Tony's head immediately snapped up, his brown eyes wide with fear as the street outside the Sanctum suddenly filled with the screams and shouts of terrified people, and the honking and crashing of cars.
"Yes, sir. Quentin Beck is indeed employed as a project leader in the Stark Industries Research and Development department. He holds a Master's Degree in Engineering from Stanford University, and has been employed at Stark Industries for almost exactly ten years."
“Oh, yeah, I’m sure you could, Mr Stark, but I’m afraid that I already have plans,” Steve said, ignoring Peter’s exaggerated groan.  “You see, I’m going to be spending the weekend upstate with my husband and son, so—”
"Yeah, I know," said Steve. "I just…" He trailed off, feeling more and more foolish with each passing second. Even Bucky, who'd grown up with most of the same mindsets and sentiments as Steve, had found it easier to open up over time.
"Oh, it's just a saying from a show that I liked when I was really little, before the government took it away," Peter said quickly. "It basically means that you just gotta keep on going until things get better." He paused, again weighing his next words carefully. "And you've still got one arm to hold Uncle Sam with, right?"
Definitely a hell of a lot different from his usual mundane pitches to the military brass.  Although Tony had to admit that it was sometimes amusing to watch as a group of jarhead peacocks dropped to lick his shoes everytime he stepped into the room, actually presenting an innovative idea to a group of top professionals, and then have those very professionals pester him with questions until he had them convinced, had given him such a rush of adrenaline that he’d almost been able to forgo his coffee for the rest of the day.
"She does not believe it will do any good," Drax said softly. "Now that Thanos has the Time Stone, it does not matter how long it takes us to repair the ship."
Steve smiled, too sated and content to even attempt to move at the moment. There would be time enough for that later.
"Well, maybe if we manage to round up the rest of his buddies he'll be more likely to start talking," said Clint. "The dude can't stay quiet forever, can he?"
Chief Stacy frowned, pursing his lips. "Look, Captain, I'm not exactly sure what your son might've told you about me, but—"
"Hey, Pete?" Tony said, gently shaking his son's shoulder. "Buddy, you keep trying to faceplant into your popcorn, so why don't you head on to bed, yeah?"
"Holy shit!" he exclaimed as he leapt to his feet, faster than Peter had ever seen him move before. "There's a spaceship! We're all gonna die!"
"Yeah, but that's the thing! What if it wasn't?" Scott asked. "What if we could somehow control the chaos, and fix all of… this? What if there was a way that we could enter the Quantum Realm at this point in time, and emerge in another point in time? Before Thanos?"
Peter gulped as he opened his laptop, ducking down behind it. "Yeah, well, Papa tries to keep us all pretty healthy, so…"
All of the lovemaking they had been doing might've had a bit to do with that as well. It had been a long time since Steve and Tony had been able to enjoy this much sex on consecutive nights, and Steve was soaking up as much of it as he possibly could.
It had been Obadiah who had arranged to have Tony and Peter attacked and captured in Afghanistan. It had been Obadiah who'd had Peter ripped from Tony's arms in that freezing-cold cave and dragged away to be experimented on, and it had been Obadiah who had then hooked up with Aldrich Killian, who tried to convert Peter into another Winter Soldier.
Peter nodded, feeling not too unlike one of Papa's bobble-head baseball figurines. "Where'd you move from?"
"And you had better be careful about how loud you say things like that, ya hear?" Rhodey warned him. "Especially now."
But to Steve's horror, the creature only batted the shield away as if it were nothing more than a cheap plastic frisbee, sending it flying into a clump of trees near the bank where it lodged about five metres off the ground. Stunned, Steve hesitated for a split-second, just long enough for Tony to get back to his feet and wrap his armoured arms around Steve's waist.
But Doctor List only shook his head, the smile dropping from his face as he clutched his clipboard to his chest.  “I am afraid, Captain, that your noble sacrifice was all for nothing.  You see, HYDRA has been what you would call lying low, biding its time.  And now, once I am through with you, it will be stronger than ever!”
"Nothing else is gonna happen, so get that out of your head right now," Tony said sternly as he patted the bed next to him. "Just… c'mere, okay? There's no way you could sleep with your skin all raw and blistered to hell anyway."
In fact, if guilt could ever be converted into usable currency, Tony was certain that he'd be a billionaire several times over.
A chorus of affirmative murmurs floated up from the team as Sam spoke up, "So, pretty much just another day at the office then, right Cap?"
about to waste it. Not when the lives of his husband and son, not to mention billions of others, were depending on the outcome.
," he said slowly. "The third engine is a reserve engine that would only be used in the event that the aircraft were to exit the planet's atmosphere."
"No, thanks, JARVIS, I'll do it myself once I get cleaned up. Can you please tell Peter that I'm almost there?"
“Um… hey there, kitty kitty,” Tony called through the door, stamping down his embarrassment before it had a chance to take over.  “Ah… is Steve home?  I really need to see him.”
Anger welled up inside Tony, so burning hot that he felt he might self-combust. "So you're saying… that our government willingly sent those two assholes over to Meridia just so they could reproduce our tech?"
"Ah, sure," Steve answered. He grabbed two bottles of Powerade from the newsstand set up in the lobby, exchanging pleasantries with the elderly Korean War vet who ran it while he paid. Tony had set up an ongoing weekly donation to the newsstand that Steve knew more than covered the cost of he and Sam's daily Powerade bottles, but Steve wasn't about to use that as an excuse.
"So, when does your papa get his new cast off?" Gwen asked as they walked down the hall to History after lunch, Ned having made a beeline for Betty's locker as soon as the bell rang.
“I had a really great time tonight,” Steve cut in, gasping as he realised he’d just interrupted Tony.  “Oh, I’m sorry!  I didn't mean to—”
“Pete’s actually gonna start swimming,” adds Tony.  “He’s being coached by a guy who works over at Empire State.”
, he couldn't see how they could avoid it. Strange had said there were only two ways for them to be victorious, and Tony highly doubted that one of them consisted of them just standing around watching as an endless army poured through a wormhole.
there's no way in hell I can say no to that," Tony managed once he regained the ability to speak. A low growl escaped from his throat as he cupped Steve's face, capturing his lips in a bruising kiss before reaching down to the floor for the bottle of lube. With shaking hands he slicked up two of his fingers, plunging them into himself as Steve curled his hand around Tony's cock, causing him to cry out.
He broke off, his pale cheeks flushing pink as Steve's heart nearly broke in two. Being eleven was awkward enough without being so sick that you couldn't even use the bathroom on your own.
He breaks off as Tony slowly turns to look at him, his beautiful face so ashen beneath his beard that it appears almost grey, and his eyes so red-rimmed and sunken that Steve hears his heart audibly crack.
Oh, Tony’s mom helped in the very beginning, teaching Tony how to hold his tiny baby, how to feed him and diaper him and get him to burp without urping up every single ounce he’d just eaten.  She even took a few of the godawful middle-of-the-night sessions, when Peter would do nothing but scream his tiny head off for hours and hours and hours, leaving Tony so frazzled that he felt like his very skin was buzzing.
"No, no, that's okay." Steve squeezed his eyes closed, pressing his palm to his chest. Peter was okay. He was safe at home, sleeping in his bed. "Just… please tell him that I love him once he wakes up in the morning. And that I'll see him soon."
Unfortunately, Steve could now understand where she was coming from. He had only known Peter for a few months, and yet it was still so unbelievably hard for him to have to leave Peter there in that hospital bed every single night, all alone, with only a notebook and his monitors for company.
"Yes, we do," agreed Papa. "Sam, James, do a quick reconnaissance flight. Don't cross their line, just see what you can see and come right back."
"Yeah, it's about—" Steve started, choking on the rest when he realised he'd almost said too much. "Yeah, it's—it's somewhere underground. King T'Challa believes it's not too far from the palace, but—"
"Not yet, but JARVIS is working on it," Tony said. "If nothing else, we'll at least have one of the drones targeting those coordinates by the time we get there."
Readying his shield, Steve crouched down behind it, barrelling through the side wall of the trailer with Natasha directly on his heels. As soon as his feet hit the ground outside, he paused and assessed the area, signaling to the two Wakandan guards to approach.
Oh, he knew Steve would disagree, and maybe there was a part of Tony that might've too, deep down. But the fact of the matter was, Tony had become so tangled in his chains of guilt and grief over Peter that he couldn't even think about anything else. Couldn't feel anything besides the horrible, gut-wrenching pain, and couldn't hear anything besides his own inner voices telling him that he hadn't done enough to save his precious boy.
He did have a feeling, though, that even aside from the lost fuel, the damage was probably far worse than what Nebula suspected. Which meant that the only way they'd be able to make it out of Titan's atmosphere was if their luck happened to change.
"Yeah, yeah, I know what I used to say." Dad paused, sucking in a deep breath. "Look, buddy, you know I like to sound off a bit when I'm upset, but—"
"Okay," Tony repeated, trying hard to keep his expression neutral even as he wanted to scream at the unfairness of it all. Steve had been so relaxed, so happy before they had walked off the plane, and now it was all shot to hell in only a couple of minutes.
Turning out the overhead lights, Steve crawled onto the bed, carefully removing Tony’s glasses from his face and placing them on his bedside table.  He went next for the computer, chuckling when Tony’s fingers instinctively tightened on it as he tried to pick it up.
"The suit's wrecked now anyway, isn't it? You sure saw to that," he grumbled. "Can I go to sleep now?"
"Ah, I see," said Uncle Sam, giving Uncle Bucky a knowing glance. "Well, then I guess you're just outta luck now, hmm, Sir Bucky?"
Steve lets out a sigh as he takes a sip of his juice.  He supposes he may as well tell her, since she somehow always manages to find out anyway.
"Yeah, I kinda gathered that when the homeroom teacher called you Mr Stark-Rogers," said Gwen. "Isn't your dad Iron Man?"
"This is just a nightmare," he whispered. "Only it's even worse, 'cause I can't seem to wake up from it, and—"
what he's saying," Phillips said firmly. He turned to Tony, pursing his lips. "Do you remember when I told you that I had a contingency plan in place for your boy?"
"Well…" Steve said as he stepped forward, leaning down to peck Tony on the lips. "I might've just arranged for the three of us to take a trip on one of our brand-new airliners, and—"
"Man, I am so glad that we don't live in the suburbs!" Peter said as he slammed through a wooden fence. "This really sucks!"
—door. Steve had insisted on calling his barracks room "their" room ever since Tony moved in most of his clothing, but it still hadn't quite sunk in yet. Having lived in Howard's small house for his entire life, Tony wasn't used to having something that he could call his own. He'd even gotten up the courage to tell Steve about the log cabin he'd been lusting over for the last several years just a week or so ago, after which Steve had proceeded to pull out his sketchbook—
"He was," Steve replied. "And as far as I know, he didn't even realise that he'd been snapped. None of the people who were in Wakanda seemed to notice that anything was different."
"But we can't," Tony interrupted. He swallowed hard, glancing down at the glasses still in his hand. "Now that we know it works, we just can't." He didn't add that he was even more afraid of what HYDRA would do to Peter if they ever managed to get their hands on him again than he was of Peter using the glasses. It wasn't something that he felt like saying out loud, and knowing Steve, he was probably already thinking the exact same thing.
The man’s smile grew wider.  “Of course it’s okay,” he said as he picked up a well-used bookmark from his counter, placing it inside his book before setting it carefully down.  Peter couldn’t help but notice how deliberate his movements were, almost like he was afraid he was going to mistreat the book.
He wouldn't put it past Brock to try and break into his place sometime and go searching for the medals, thinking he could pawn them off on eBay or something.  Even Ma, being the smart, perceptive woman that she always was, waited until Steve had kicked Brock out of his life before presenting him with the box, not wanting it to fall victim to Brock’s tendency to claim for himself anything of Steve’s that he deemed valuable.
It seemed like an entire year passed as Tony stared up at Steve, his lower lip shaking. "Okay, honey," he finally whispered. "I won't."
Dad's lips twitched as he glanced over at Papa, just for a second, giving him the 'it's-all-right-honey' eyebrow. "I don't see why not, bud. I'll tell Happy tomorrow morning to plan on having the guards available for the school, okay?"
Tony thought, tapping his fingernails against his tablet. He briefly wondered if Strange had known then that he was going to die, or if it came as a surprise later on.
"We'll be happy to put Mr Pym in touch with Maria Hill, one of our deputy directors here at SHIELD," said Steve. "I'm sure she'll be able to figure out a way to keep this Cross person from trying to do… whatever it is he's trying to do."
Colonel Phillips continued on, waxing poetic about Anthony Stark's many achievements in an obvious attempt to impress the assembled group of Air Corps pilots, but Steve could barely listen, his jaw tightly clenched and only a single thought running through his mind.
"Yeah, I know." Steve had even checked in on his ma just the previous afternoon after leaving the hospital with the intention of telling her all about Tony, only to spend the entire hour or so he was there trying to fix a broken door on one of her kitchen cabinets.
"Yeah," Tony said, so high-pitched and squeaky that he sounded like a toddler. He cleared his throat, swallowing hard.
“Well, that was your fault for sleeping with her!” Obie exclaimed.  “You know you’re not supposed to sleep with ‘em until the third date, Tony, what the hell’s wrong with you?”
“Tony, be careful!” Steve says as he grabs onto a jeep as it races by, knocking the driver out with a single punch.  “Those cannons—we really need to get inside!”
Steve nodded against his chest. Of course Tony would know exactly what was bothering him. "I think that's the worst part of all this. Back during the war I knew my mission, and I knew how to formulate the plans that I'd need to complete the mission. And things didn't always go according to plan, 'cause it was a war, and stuff tends to happen that you didn't plan on during a war. But I still knew the objective, I knew who the enemy was, and I knew what I needed to do to take them out. But now… I guess ever since the whole mess with Project Insight, I can't say that I know who the enemy is anymore. I mean, SHIELD was completely infiltrated by HYDRA and no one even realised it until it was almost too late, and now we don't know how many of them are left or even who they are, and it just makes me so angry! And now if they've been able to manoeuvre their way into the government, then… what's to stop them from doing exactly what they'd always intended to do?"
Papa let out a heavy sigh, shaking his head as he scooped out a huge bite of ice cream from his glass. The little crinkle between his eyebrows that Dad always called his worry wrinkle was on full display, and Peter always hated when Papa was worried.
It was his healing factor, working overtime to try and keep him whole, and just now losing the battle.
"Yeah, for about an hour. Thanks." Tony didn't add that he hadn't been able to get back to the hospital since then, having been swamped during the days and working through the night the past three nights trying to input all of Peter's code into his computer. Rhodey had even found him there just the previous morning right after the end of the blackout period, passed out cold on top of Peter's incredible drawing of the mother bird and her three chicks.
"Yeah, but that's only an excuse," Uncle Bucky said. "The thing is, I never even questioned it. My ma and papa never talked about it. We had Stevie over at the house just about every single day, and he'd be wheezing and hacking and running that steamer thingy of his all the time to try and help him breathe, and no one even questioned it. It was just how things were."
Dad reached for Papa's hand then, and Peter instinctively wrinkled his nose at the look Papa gave him, that sickly sweet, "I adore you beyond reason" look that he gave Dad at least a million times a day.
And it wasn't that Steve didn't trust Tony. On the contrary, he trusted Tony implicitly, just as he knew Tony trusted him, and the two of them always worked very well in the field together. They worked instinctively, and could anticipate the other's movements so easily it was as if they'd been fighting together all their lives. It had been like that ever since the Battle of New York.
"Um, I think he's nodding off again, sweetheart," Steve whispered into Tony's ear. He jerked his head in Peter's direction, forcing Tony to hide his chuckle as he watched Peter's curly head nearly flop down into his huge bowl of popcorn and then snap right back up again, his eyes blinking rapidly behind his glasses.
They hadn't stepped more than a foot inside the gym when Peter heard Ned yelling their names. "Peter! Gwen! I'm so glad you guys are here!" Peter grimaced as Ned hurried over to them, an extra-wide smile on his face. "Wow, you guys look nice!"
"Fix… things?" Tony asked, his throat bobbing as he swallowed. "Fix what, exactly? And if Lang didn't get snapped, then where the hell's he been all this time?"
Because Tony wasn’t just a guy that Steve had picked up in some out-of-the-way dive pub.  He was Tony Stark, the famous billionaire whose young son was waiting for him to come home, and Steve wanted to do this the right way.
"Uh huh," Peter said, his narrow shoulders sagging in defeat. "Good thing it's a Saturday, hmm? So I can help you?"
Steve nodded as a tear rolled down his cheek, his long artist’s fingers slowly curling around Tony’s wrists as he got to the final shirt button, halting his frantic movements.  “I know, sweetheart.  Tony, I
Stepping up behind his starting block, Steve breathes in, focusing on the soft ripples shimmering across the surface of the clear blue water as he brings his right arm across his front to stretch out his tricep.  He slowly counts to three—
“Ah, sure,” replied Colonel Rhodes.  “But so long as you didn't add anything since I last checked ‘em over, I’m pretty sure everything’s here.”
Then again, based on everything he'd heard about Wakanda and their tech, Steve supposed he couldn't be too surprised. The shield tucked securely next to his legs on the floor was only a tiny example of the effectiveness of the Wakandan technology, and it had been good enough to cushion his leap from over twenty stories up.
“Uh huh.”  Handing Dad his towel, Peter jumps into the water, gasping for breath as he resurfaces.  Then he slides on his goggles and pushes off from the wall.  The pool is slightly longer than the one at the Y, which Peter realises means it’s measured in metres instead of yards.
"We're really sorry we're so late tonight, little guy," Steve said as he pulled Peter into a huge but careful hug, one that Peter had taken to calling his papa bear hug. "There's… there's been—"
"Well, good, 'cause I'm definitely gonna hold you to that," Tony said. He pressed a long, lingering kiss to Steve's lips, trailing his thumb across his cheekbone. "C'mon, honey. I bet Pete's already getting suspicious."
“Thanks,” Sam said with a short nod.  He tugged gently on Bucky’s hand.  “C’mon, babe, let's go decompress for a while, huh?”
Wanted to watch as their newly-reunited family worked together to defeat the most nefarious villain the Avengers had ever encountered.
"You are so fucking sexy when you come, baby," he murmured once Steve peeled open his eyes. "God, I've missed you!"
"Here," he said as he handed the squishy, buttery soft hoodie to Peter. "If nothing else, it'll help keep you warm tonight."
"Well, train wreck is a rather appropriate metaphor." Tony tossed the towel into the nearby hamper and wound his arms around Steve's waist, hugging him from behind. "At least now we know who we have to watch out for."
“I will.”  Tony reached for his son, pulling him in for a careful hug.  “Don't be afraid to ask for help today if you need it, okay?  I don't want you hurting your finger even more ‘cause you're too proud to ask Ned to carry your books for you.”
"'Cause the chips only work one-way," explained Natasha. "We can hear what he's doing, but he wouldn't be able to hear us. It's for security reasons, in order to keep location tabs during scouting missions."
"Good morning, beloved," Tony whispered, just before he sealed their mouths together. Steve let out another soft moan as his arms curled around Tony's back, moving Tony to straddle him. Tony gasped into Steve's mouth as his own half-hard cock slid against Steve's, heat blooming across his chest as Steve's hands slid down to grip his ass.
"You're so beautiful, sweetheart," Steve murmured just before claiming Tony's lips. The kiss was sweet and almost chaste, with Steve's tongue running across Tony's lips just before he pulled away to trail kisses down his jaw and neck to his chest, and the kaleidoscope of scars directly over his sternum. Having met Tony when he did, Steve had never seen him without the scars, first with the arc reactor and then without, and while intellectually Tony knew that the sorry condition of his chest never bothered Steve, he sometimes couldn't help but wish that they would just go away already.
was the effect that Peter had on people. He was like a bright ray of sunshine on a cloudy day, spreading happiness and joy to anyone who was lucky enough to encounter him.
The teacher pursed her lips. "Then I would appreciate having your full attention during these announcements, is that clear?"
"Okay, well, I guess that doesn't matter anymore now, does it?" Steve said with a frown. "But since we're both going up against the firing squad tomorrow morning, don't you think I should be as prepared as possible?"
"Mmmhmm," Tony hummed around him, and that was all it took to yank Steve over the edge. He cried out as he came, his shouts of pleasure echoing off the candlelit walls of their bedroom as he practically melted into the mattress, his entire body tingling with residual current.
"Mmm. Thought so," Tony said. He swiped a slice of garlic bread from the tray, ripping off a piece and stuffing it into his mouth. "Which one was it this time?"
"But with the arc reactor, he should probably get checked out, don't you think?" Peter asked, his sweet brown eyes wide with worry. "But let me guess. Dad said no, right?"
once he knew for sure that HYDRA no longer had any control over him, then he would show his dads what he'd found, and hopefully convince them once and for all that he was way too valuable to be sent away.
of the arriving elevator prevented Steve from replying, and he clamped his mouth shut as Tony manoeuvred him inside. He had witnessed what he'd coined as the Stark Stubborn Streak several times in both Tony and Peter, but he'd never had it personally directed at him until now.
"Yeah, and I'm pretty sure Tony's the only one who's up to that particular challenge," Sam said with wide eyes. "Now, that being said, how 'bout we schedule a regular time to talk a couple of times a week or so, yeah? Preferably during the daylight hours? Today's Wednesday, so say… Tuesdays and Thursdays after lunch?"
"Can I have you tonight, sweetheart?" Steve asked, brushing his lips across Tony's in a soft kiss. "Please?"
"Yeah, babe, just relieved." He turned the glasses case over in his hand. "If it hadn't've worked, and Pete would've had to see Bucky… well… let's just say that I'm
"Стив, we did it!" Steve heard Bucky call over the comm as they crossed the aircraft landing area outside of the palace. "They're all fading! Every last one of 'em are fading!"
"All right, hon," Tony said, muffled against Steve's chest. "Then we should tell the team, yeah? I mean—"
“I was looking them up because I thought I could show Steve some of the information about them,” Peter replied.  “But since all of the trials for the neuromuscular drugs have been suspended, now I can’t even do that.”
Tony hesitated.  “No, I’m not.  But if you don't mind sending me a reminder text this afternoon, I can promise that I’ll do it then.”
Tony's cheeks paled into that ashen, greyish colour that never failed to make Steve's heart skip a beat or three, as it always meant that he was either terrified, or horribly, horribly sick.
"Yeah, I know," Steve whispered. His heart leapt into his throat as the processional music began, with all of the seated guests turning to watch as Peter led Ma up the centre aisle to her seat on Steve's side. Howard was already in his seat on Tony's side, along with his date for the wedding, the woman Steve had hired to clean out his house.
With a final surge forward, Steve lunges for the touchpad, hitting it square in the centre with the very tip of his middle finger.  As his momentum carries the rest of his body in, he curls his fingers over the gutter, sucking in a lungful of air as he turns to look at the clock.  He blinks several times as the results come into focus, at first too afraid to actually believe them.
"You were always going to lose," Thanos said, his raspy voice scraping along Steve's fraying nerves like a straight razor. "Because I am inevitable."
Thankfully, by the time Uncle Sam's car pulled into the school's parking lot on Friday afternoon, Peter's mood had brightened to the point where he was practically vibrating with excitement. Gwen had stored her stuff in the school's office all day, and was now clutching the handle of her small suitcase, her other hand threaded through Peter's arm.
Steve gave a nod, closing his hand over Tony's as they manoeuvred their way towards the exit. Tony's mind was swirling as they hurried back to the Stark Industries building, berating himself over and over for not seeing it sooner.
Tony could’ve sworn he heard the UI sigh.  “There have been a total of eleven attempted calls, sir, between the hours of 9:30pm and 1am.  As per your instructions, I informed Mr Stane that you were not taking calls until normal office hours began at 8am.”
"Forgive me if this sounds cold, Tony," he said. "But this has been going on for twenty-eight years now, and your boy's not the only one who has suffered."
Tony was even certain that a couple of them had decided to return to Italy, to retire in the home of their ancestors.
Attempts that weren't yet going quite the way that he had planned as of yet. Peter was an immensely graceful boy most of the time, well on his way to mastering ballet with Natasha and managing flying through the air on his webs as easily as if he'd been doing so his entire life. But his grace during ballet and in the air apparently hadn't exactly translated to the water yet.
"Well, that sure looks cozy, bud," Dad said, giving Papa his most adoring googly-eyes as Papa set his plate in front of him. After serving himself, Papa sat down in his chair, reaching for each of their hands.
"Did Colonel Phillips mention if anyone had gotten a look at Bucky's aircraft yet?" Papa asked. "Do they know where the beam hit?"
"Yes, there was!" Tony snapped. He yanked his hand again, pulling it from Steve's grasp before rolling onto his side, facing away from him. "You weren't there. You didn't hear him as he grabbed at me, begging for me to help him. It took him longer to fade than the others, and he felt every single bit of it. And all I could do was stand there and watch. I was
“Ah.  Yeah, I guess that would make sense,” Tony said as he pulled into the Tower garage.  Rhodey had told him plenty of not-so-great stories about airmen getting hazed to the point of severe injury if their squads suspected them of being anything other than heterosexual, so he figured the other military branches had to be similar.
Gwen gave Peter a smile that sent ribbons of warmth coursing through him, which was good because it was absolutely
“Sounds like a plan,” Tony said, giving him that quirky smirk that Steve already adored.  “Goodnight, Steve.”
Shifting in his seat, Peter rested his chin down on his stack of books and glanced up at the clock again, the second hand almost taunting him with its metronome-like ticks. He had always wondered why the teachers even bothered to hold regular classes on the last day of school, when they all knew that most—if not all—of the students would rather be anywhere else. With his final exams completed and his standing as the top student in the class safely intact, Peter's mind had wandered far and wide throughout the day, focusing on just about anything besides whatever his teachers were discussing.
A smile of relief stretched across Tony's lips. "That's more like it," he said as he tipped his head, pressing a slow kiss to the underside of Steve's jaw. Steve shivered in response, and Tony let out a soft chuckle. The successful test of his new armour had managed to ward away the last lingering heebie jeebies from his nightmare, at least for the moment, and now he couldn't help but notice that he had his insanely hot husband in his arms, wearing nothing but a thin pair of sleep pants and a t-shirt that showed off his deliciously firm pecs and abs to perfection.
"Well…" Steve said as his smile grew even deeper, revealing the dimple in his right cheek—and oh gods, that
Hadn't he spent the last two-plus years ensuring that that very thing was impossible? Ever since Obie and his HYDRA goons had managed to override JARVIS and break into the Tower in order to steal Peter from right under his and Steve's noses, Tony had sworn up, down, sideways, and diagonally that he would never,
"So… how's Captain Rogers doing?" Phillips said, rather slyly. "Seems like you two have gotten to be pretty close recently."
Unsure of what to do, Peter hesitated just long enough for the monster's next punch to land squarely on his jaw, sending him flying at least ten metres to crash against the outside wall of the prison, right next to a sign that read Seagate Penitentiary.
"Yeah, sure," Gwen said. She shifted her stack of books into one arm, holding out her hand. "Give me your phone."
And hopefully all of that, plus the three woolen blankets he was huddling under and the hot cocoa he was drinking, would be enough to get them through the fireworks show, ringing in yet another new year.
"Or something," Tony said with a wink. He tugged Steve's face closer, pecking him on the lips. "Don't worry about Pete, honey. He wouldn't get so defensive if he didn't love you."
Tony huffed into his pillow, biting his lip again as Steve carefully worked him open, nearly sobbing once he finally pulled out his fingers and laid down next to him, rolling Tony onto his side.
"Yeah, that's what Стиви used to say," Uncle Bucky said, chuckling. "You really are a lot like him."
Steve let out a shiver at the mention of HYDRA, just enough for Tony to notice. Even though HYDRA was finally completely dead and gone, Steve still didn't appreciate having to hear its name mentioned.
"The next pitch will decide the game," finished Bucky. He turned to Steve, giving him a rather sly wink. "Just like that one game that we watched… what year was it?"
"All right, that's enough," Papa said. He tugged on Peter's shoulder, drawing him back to lean against him. Peter let out a sigh as he settled in, sipping on his milkshake with the comforting sound of Papa's heartbeat beneath his ear as Dad scooted backwards until there was no space between the three of them, with Papa's hand resting on his arm.
nods as he slipped both hands around his waist. "I've just been thinking… Peter has his school break coming up in about six weeks, so maybe it would be a good time for us to get away for a few days. I thought maybe we could go back to Italy? We've always said that we wanted to take him there sometime, and I know I wouldn't mind going back either, so… what do you think?"
"But… don't you think he'd wanna know if his papa was deliberately killed?" Peter asked. "'Cause I think he would."
"That is correct," Gwen said, flashing her million-watt smile at him. "And do you know the man's name who started it?"
"Is Peter doing okay?" he asked as he pulled on the t-shirt, raking his fingers through his mussed-up hair. Peter had been having nightmares recently too, the poor boy, on top of all of his other odd symptoms that had so far managed to stump not only Tony, but also his entire team of medical specialists. They had scheduled an appointment to meet with an acquaintance of Director Fury's who was a genetics specialist, but that wasn't until the fall, and both Steve and Tony were rapidly becoming more and more concerned about Peter as the weeks went on.
"And so does Dad," Steve said with a frown. "Because I know he didn't sleep hardly at all while I was gone."
“Oh, nothing I wanna get into now, bud, okay?”  He stepped over to Steve, rising up onto his tiptoes for a kiss.  “Hey, hot stuff.  You doing okay?”
"What did you just say?" Tony demanded, his blood pressure spiking. "'Cause it damn well better not be what I think I just heard!"
Dad’s eyes narrowed, then suddenly snapped open so wide Peter thought they might pop out of his head.
“What’s gonna be so much fun?” Tony asked as he suddenly burst through the door in a shower of snowflakes.  He made an immediate beeline for Steve, planting a kiss on his lips.  “Well, hello there, good lookin’.  You wouldn’t happen to have any plans for the weekend, would ya?  ‘Cause I am certain that I could show you a good time if you’d let me.”
"Huh?" Tony said, barely coherent against the crushing weight of his fear. "But the doctors always told me that if Pete ever had to go on a vent, that he'd—that he'd never get off of it!"
"I highly doubt that," said Steve. "All right. While Bruce is heading back to New Asgard with Thor, I think the rest of us should concentrate on researching methods to repel the effects of these stones, and that we should get started as soon as possible. Dismissed."
It took about three more seconds for Steve's mind to finally catch up with itself, and he was barely able to stop his eyebrows before they knitted together into a frown. Tony had suspected that O'Brien's insistence on a personal meeting couldn't mean anything good, and while Steve had tried to assure him that his concerns were unwarranted, his usual optimism, already tempered by his own guilt, just didn't seem to want to cooperate.
"Yeah, and I'm still not convinced that the two attacks aren't related." Tony slid his hands down the sides of Steve's back, slipping his fingers underneath his bulky sweatshirt and tight undershirt to ghost across the soft skin just above his waistband. "Coincidence my ass, there's no way you can tell me this second attack wasn't because of the first, even if it wasn't by the same people or group."
The door to the store was locked when Tony pushed on the door handle, not too surprising since Steve didn't open until noon on Mondays.  He tried knocking on the window, thinking that if Steve was in the back or something he’d still be able to hear him.  When no answer came after the third loud knock, Tony pulled out his phone and dialled Steve’s number, his heart hammering as he waited for him to answer.
Tony's eyebrows immediately shot up. "Now wait just a goddamn minute, Nick. You promised me after Steve got attacked that all of HYDRA was finally accounted for, and now—"
Tony nodded, tapping his chin. "All right. And if we did that, and I just happened to meet Hulk's fist with mine head-on, then—?"
"Tony? Who's Tony?" said Hammer. "Oh, do you mean Anthony? As in Stark? As in Stark Industries? Well, if that's indeed who you're referring to, as far as I'm aware Anthony Stark doesn't even run Stark Industries anymore, isn't that true?" Hammer heaved a heavy sigh, his lips pursed in indignation. "And I'll bet that poor Howard is rolling over in his grave as we speak because of it. To turn the company that he built with his own sweat and tears over to someone who's not even in the family, and essentially stealing it from his own grandson, no less? I mean, that poor kid! If that'd been my father, I would've been absolutely furious! Just livid!"
"Well, let me know if you need any help later, okay?" Steve said. Tony had mentioned something about venturing into his lab the night before, which Steve had been absolutely ecstatic about. It had been months since Tony had done anything other than set a single tentative foot inside his workspace, and Steve was hoping that once he got in there, he would maybe feel compelled to start tinkering again.
"Not at the moment, Senator," said Tony. "Creating something that's as effective as the Iron Legion isn't exactly something that can be done overnight. Or inexpensively, as I'm sure you're aware."
stuff to fit in the new set.  Of all of the semi-rare stuff that he had, these new books were the rarest, and therefore deserved the highest place of honour.
accept that!" he cried as he launched the shield again, this time aided by a sudden blast from Carol Danvers that was powerful enough to both take out the alien and slam Thanos down onto his back.
"Colonel Rhodes is on standby in D.C., and Nat, Clint, and the twins just arrived at the Tower, along with Gwen Stacy and her family. What should I tell them?"
"Hold on there, superman, just give me a minute!" Sam retorted, adjusting his sunglasses as he twirled the ball in his hand. Steve watched as he wound up, sucking in a sharp breath as his left foot rose from the ground and he initiated his swing as soon as Sam released the ball, hitting it square on and sending it flying. Shielding his eyes with his hand, Steve watched as the ball sailed in a perfect rainbow-esque arc right over the fence while Bucky just watched it go, not even bothering to try and run after it.
"Eh, I wouldn't count on that!" Cam said as he took out yet another surface-to-air missile. "You know Phillips doesn't like telling us anything until it's only like two days before!"
Peter nibbled on the end of his pencil, thinking. "How 'bout a big tree? You know, the kind that kids like to climb? There's a big one in the backyard of my house that I used to climb all the time before—" He broke off, biting his bottom lip. "Well, when I was little. Didn't you used to climb trees when you were little?"
Setting down the datapad, Peter rolled his neck, rubbing at his aching shoulder for a moment. He should've known that he could count on Ms Sharon's help. She had always been so good to him, one of the nicest people he'd ever met.
"We thought we'd pick you guys up tomorrow morning after breakfast and take you to the base, let you clear out your room at the barracks," Sam said. "And I'm pretty sure your bike is still parked out there too."
"I'm not gonna be injecting Finley with anything, Ned, okay?" Peter said. "And especially not some other animal's DNA. I'm not gonna create some mutant, glowing fish in my bedroom."
"Oh, I really hope you can come, Uncle Bucky!" Peter continued. "The Decathlon finals are held in the spring, and that's a really nice time to be in D.C. with all the cherry trees blooming and stuff. And then we could take you around to see some of the landmarks! I bet you'd love 'em! Papa and Dad even got to see the Smithsonian exhibit on the Howling Commandos on one of their trips down there!"
“Right behind ya, Cap!” Tony says as Clint swings down from one of the nearby trees, landing on the backseat of Natasha’s jeep.  She immediately guns the engine, aiming for the road that runs alongside the northernmost guard towers.
"Mmm," grumbled Tony as he broke off a big piece of the muffin, shoving it into his mouth. It was coming up on the time for him to check in with Steve, and he was both anxious for it and dreading it. Hearing Steve's voice would at least remind Tony that he was still alive, but having to tell him that they were no closer to bringing him home than they were six hours ago was going to be so incredibly painful that at the moment Tony had no idea how he was going to be able to handle it.
—said as he landed on the grass about five metres away. "Now, quickly tell me how we can dispose of this rather troublesome creature!"
"Oh, I definitely am," added Steve, wincing as soon as the words left his mouth. Bucky was right; he was
"Well, contrary to what you might sometimes think, we're not completely unaware of the fact that you and Gwen haven't been able to spend much time together recently, so… we've already arranged it. Bucky and Sam said it was fine, and Dad's already spoken to Chief Stacy about it as well."
Tony started. He honestly hadn't given even a speck of thought to his choice of words when he'd said that. He'd only said what felt natural.
Steve let out a soft smile. "Yeah, I do." He flicked his eyes over to the pantry as he reached for the freezer door. "Can you find the boxes of chicken broth in there for me? We're gonna get started on some soup."
Because without a medal in this race, his chances for participating in the relay have just dropped precipitously.  And without the relay, then he’ll leave Athens completely empty-handed.  Which means—
Tony's lower lip started to shake, his eyebrows knitting together into the look of anguish that Steve had come to dread.
Mags’s entire face lights up so brightly that Tony’s convinced she almost tripped the power circuits.
"Yeah, well, don't thank me, little guy," said Steve. "I'm pretty sure this was one of yours and Dad's algorithms."
That will be the legacy of Captain America.  Not as the leader of the Avengers, but as the man who missed his chance at the very love he’s desired for his entire life.
Steve frowned, fighting against the strong urge to cover Peter's ears as he tucked him even closer. "Why, Thor? "he asked. "What's going to happen?"
"Steve… baby, please move," Tony whimpered as he wiggled his hips, pulling a strangled gasp from Steve's throat. He was so full that he felt as though he might split in two, but yet he also felt
looks, so there they sat, watching as the various senators inputted their votes on the bill containing the Superhero Registration Act.
"Yeah, there is," said Tony. Of course Peter wouldn't program his own health issues into JARVIS's matrix. He still was under the impression that his life wasn't worth any more than anyone else's, which was absolutely ridiculous. Peter was arguably the most intelligent person that Langara had ever seen, and the thought of losing someone like him before he'd even reached puberty was—well—
And then Winter Soldier turned on his heel and walked away, with the rest of the image dissolving into pixels as soon as he was out of sight. Silence fell across both the anteroom and inside the panic room, with nobody daring to move until Sam finally quirked an eyebrow in question.
Uncle Bucky attempted a smile. He only managed what Peter would call a kind of quarter-smile, but he supposed it was better than nothing.
Gwen smiled, sending a bolt of warmth down Peter's spine. So far, aside from a few rather stern side-eyes from Chief Stacy on the way to Gwen's house, there hadn't been all that much awkwardness between them. Peter didn't even feel the need to be constantly talking, which he often tended to do when he was especially nervous.
"Is there a reason why you're wearing a shirt tonight?" Steve gently asked a few seconds later, pinching the almost threadbare fabric of Tony's tank top between his fingers. "'Cause if it's because you're cold, I doubt this thing is gonna help all that much."
And even now, over three months later, it was still hard for him to admit just how close he had come to never seeing them again.
"Mmm," Tony moaned softly as Steve finished with the soap and reached next for Tony's shampoo, proceeding to wash his hair with such attention and care that Tony couldn't help but moan again. Steve was so physically strong; an attribute that he had demonstrated on so many occasions that Tony had long lost count, and yet he was so gentle with Tony that it no doubt took more of Steve's strength to reign himself in than it did to express it fully.
"I'm not scared, I'm mad," Peter said sharply. Now that his dads knew what was happening, the fear that had consumed him ever since the previous night was being rapidly replaced with anger. "Who do these people think they are, thinking they can just single us out because we're a bit different from them? It's the worst kind of discrimination, and I can't believe that you think we should just run away from it instead of fighting back."
"There is," said Tony. "Which means that along with the time-space compass I'm gonna have to build, Bruce and I will also have to write an algorithm for JARVIS so he can help us eliminate the universes that have no chance of being the right ones."
"Стиви!" Bucky yelled again, his voice now laced with the very same panic that was threatening to pull Steve under, holding him under the freezing cold water until all of the air was pushed out of his lungs, and he had no choice but to give in.
Silence stretched across the landing pad, with Steve's thudding heart the only detectable sound as Peter looked up at him, his brown eyes wide with the fear he was trying very hard to hide.
Steve wasn't sure how long he was floating in his sea of sensation, his limbs deliciously weightless as Tony pressed a few final kisses to the inside of his thighs before crawling back up his body, trailing the pad of his thumb softly across Steve's cheekbone.
Uncle Bucky's eyebrows knitted together as he glared at Peter. "You heard us?" he asked, low and tight.
"No no, that's not what Phillips meant," Uncle James said. He let out a heavy sigh as he looked at Papa. "In fact, I'm supposed to relay a message to you, Captain. Three days from now, before you'll be cleared to return to active duty, you have a meeting scheduled with General O'Brien at 0800 hours."
"Thank you, Mr Harrington. I really appreciate it," Papa said in his Captain's voice. He leaned sideways, looking around the practically drooling teacher and begging Peter with his eyes. "Peter, are you ready to go?"
"Nah, Pepper's just concerned because she's one of the most well-organised, Type-A people I've ever met," Tony assured him. "It's the main reason why she was such a good assistant. She can crack a whip almost as well as you can, which, if you haven't noticed yet, someone like me happens to need every now and then."
"Carol and I will take off at the same time as the assigned A-shift patrols, which means that you guys," and he pointed to John and Cam, "along with Majors Lorne and Kowalski will be our air support."
"Yeah, and probably where he got his tech too, so I guess that makes sense." Peter paused, wondering if he should even mention the proverbial elephant in the room. Mentioning HYDRA around Papa was touchy, and the last thing Peter wanted was for him to get upset.
But apparently, the same HYDRA asshole who had caused Peter's Spider Sense to flare up even before he understood what it was had just been biding his time, waiting for the right opportunity to strike back at them. And Tony had not held anything back when he'd informed Fury how unhappy he was about it.
Steve stared at him for three more heartbeats before his shoulders dropped and he stepped back, raking his hands through his hair. How Tony could still believe that surviving yet another potentially traumatic event wasn't important was beyond him. Steve's memories of that entire time were awful, and not only because of Tony's flight through the portal or because he was tossed out the window. Natasha had been right during the briefing, the Mind Stone had been playing tricks on the entire team without them knowing, causing Steve and Tony to have some of the most brutal arguments that they'd ever had as a couple.
"There's no telling," said Bruce. "But I'm guessing it'll be soon. Like, really soon. And if he manages to get his hands on all six stones, then—"
He was so thoroughly exhausted by the time he crawled back up to the penthouse and into his room that he just collapsed onto the bed without brushing his teeth, with one final thought flitting across his consciousness.
Still, watching as Steve and Peter tossed a frisbee back and forth on the beach or splashed around in the sea brought back a lot of memories of their early days at the Malibu house, when Tony was still reeling from their experience in Afghanistan and obsessed with hunting down the people responsible for it.
"Such as two other civilian scientists who supposedly died in lab accidents," Tony said. "Bruce Banner and Reed Richards."
"Yeah. I'll… um… tell my dads about it." He huffed out a sharp breath, wincing as another bolt of tingling pain rushed up his spine, nearly causing him to cry out. The nerve pain was always the last thing to go away after a peppermint exposure, and it was pretty awful while it lasted.
“Yes, Pete, I promise,” Tony said.  “Just… try to be patient, yeah?  Steve and I have quite a bit to talk about, so it might be awhile.”
A sharp stab of guilt pierced Tony's chest at JARVIS's words. It was completely inexcusable that someone other than himself or Peter had been able to override the elaborate security systems at the Tower, and it had haunted him ever since they'd left the hospital down in Miami following the battle in the HYDRA bunker. In fact, developing new and improved security measures had been frequently keeping Tony up at night since then, in-between battling Steve and Peter's nightmares. He had already uploaded the initial program of something he was calling the Iron Legion into his old suits, and in fact had also begun building new unmanned suits for the exact purpose of extra security should it become necessary.
"And cue the monologue in three… two… one…" Rhodey said as Thanos came to a stop in front of the Chitauri, a leering smile stretching across his puffy purple lips.
Steve thought. But before he could continue Obadiah Stane suddenly appeared, walking right up to Image Peter and bending over him, examining him like he was a lab rat.
"Then I know I will." Tony glanced over at the drawing, at the three of them looking so happy and healthy and together, and the tears he'd been trying to hold back finally broke free, tracking down his face to pool in the scraggly stubble sprinkled across his chin.
And it wouldn’t just be limited to defibrillators.  Theoretically, as long as Tony’s math was correct, the possible uses of the new power source were endless, which meant that the sky was literally the limit as to what Tony could do with it.
"Mmm. Well, don't say that too loud around my papa, 'cause he'll latch onto it right away," warned Peter. "He and Uncle Bucky love baseball, and they aren't above trying to talk your ear off about it if given the chance."
"Yeah, I saw Betty putting up some signs about it," Peter answered, internally kicking himself. Normally he'd be jumping for joy at the possibility of getting to go to a dance with Gwen, but at the moment…
As someone who’d never believed that he'd feel comfortable sharing Peter with anyone, now Tony couldn't wait to see the two of them spending time together outside of a hospital setting, where Peter could be his true, boyish self and Steve could finally see him in all of his healthy glory.
Papa shot Dad a look, one of those looks that could convey any of about a zillion different things, depending on the circumstances. This time it was determination, appreciation, and most of all, adoration.
"Everything looks good here," he muttered, more for himself than anyone. He really had no reason to believe that the mission wouldn't be a roaring success. JARVIS had proven that he could function flawlessly during the two weeks of full-mission simulator sessions completed by Steve and his teammates Bucky and Carol, and so with the final blessing for the initial trial mission given just three days before by General O'Brien, the time had come for Tony and everyone else to find out if Project Phoenix actually had wings.
"And I do." Steve pressed a final kiss to Tony's lips. "Are you ready to go? Ma told me that she'd have dinner waiting for us once we got there, so…"
"Yes, that's correct," said Gwen. "Just make sure you don't sound like you're uncertain though, we don't want to give the competition any kind of edge. State all of your answers proudly and affirmatively, even if you're not quite sure if you're right."
"Mom makes the best cakes," Gwen said. "People even order them for parties and stuff, so I think you're gonna love it."
"Oh, really?" Tony snapped as he turned his back on the insufferable doctor/wizard, heading to what he assumed was the bridge. "And you don't happen to find that the least bit ironic, considering that goddamn rock you're wearing around your neck?"
I can’t wait to see what you think!  Please don’t forget to hit the kudos button and leave me a comment!  💖
“Yep,” Tony replied with a sigh.  He took another sip of coffee as the glowing blue hologram grew brighter and a bright red dot appeared inside the main fuel component of the missile, indicating that it was about to fire.  The red dot grew in size until it simulated an explosion, demonstrated by a red line following along the inside of the missile, which then burst out into a shower of sparks that resembled a Fourth of July fireworks display.
"Hey now. What's that supposed to mean?" asked Steve. "You were a hero that night, little guy. Dad and I couldn't be prouder of you."
"Whoa there, Стиви," Bucky said, catching Steve just before his legs gave way. He lowered Steve to the ground, crouching down in front of him. "It's okay. He's gone. Rumlow's gone now."
"All right," Steve said. He pulled Tony closer, tucking his head under his chin. "Even though the friend is a girl?"
Peter sighed.  Leave it to his father to twist everything around to make himself look like the bad guy.
And while Steve was grateful for the extra protection that the suits provided, especially for Peter, he did not like how stressed out Tony had become because of it, and his complete failure to help alleviate even a tiny amount of Tony's stress even less so. Steve always had far, far preferred to be on the offensive instead of defensive and had always despised waiting, so this whole waiting-around-for-something-to-happen and trying-to-prepare-for-anything mentality he was in was not only harder than hell, it was also just plain annoying.
a sweet sight to wake up to," he murmured, his face still partially smashed into Steve's pillow. Steve loved how Tony always seemed to take over Steve's side of the bed after he got up. "Can you just stay like right there for about the next hour or so?"
That finally got Dad to smile. "Oh, yeah. That makes more sense." He stepped back, checking Peter over from head to toe, giving him a playful bop on the nose. "You sure clean up pretty good though, bud."
The corners of Steve's lips twitched into a smirk as he reached for Tony's waist. "Oh, really? I can't say that I'd noticed."
Steve snorted as he grinned. "Well, then I guess you'll just have to take a shower with me. Is Peter still down with Thor and Bucky?"
"Oh gods, Tony, look at you," Steve said as he hit that spot again, his blue eyes so dark they were almost black. "I wish you could see how beautiful you are right now,
, but close enough for government work.  The fact that it took Steve asking Tony out on a date three separate times for him to finally say yes—and then only because Peter literally begged him—was a testament to both the stubbornness that Fury had so aptly pointed out, and the depth of Tony’s fear that the super soldier just might have what it took to finally tear down his iron walls for good.
"Oh, and that always tends to go well," Sam said, rolling his eyes. "Do we know what kind of biological it was?"
“Oh, I do!” Steve said as he drew Tony even closer, releasing his hand to slip his arms around his waist.  “I really do, I just—is it—is it okay if I—if we—?”
"Yeah, especially with the nasty type of pneumonia that he had," Sharon said with wide eyes. "Kids really are resilient, you know?"
Pushing himself up from his chair, Tony dropped the tablet onto the table with a clatter and shuffled back over to Peter's bed, climbing in next to him and brushing the hair off his forehead. His heart gave a leap when he thought he saw Peter's lips twitch at his touch, but it was there and gone again so fast that he realised a moment later he had probably only imagined it.
As optimistic as he liked to pretend he was, Steve highly doubted it. The Langaran government had been searching for a permanent solution to their country's energy problem ever since the Battle of the Continents, and yet here it was twenty-eight years later and they still couldn't seem to come up with something better than turning everyone's lights off every single night.
"Will you turn over for me?" he asked against Tony's lips. "I thought I'd start you off with a backrub."
Uncle Bucky gave a nod, sniffing as he pushed himself up from the chair. "Yeah. Yeah, I do." He shot Peter a wink as he opened the door. "Thanks, kiddo."
"I'm on my way!" Steve said as he shoved the throttle forward as far as it could go, bracing himself as the aircraft sped down the runway and a wide smile stretched across his face. There was nothing quite like the feel of that very first flight.
Sweat was pouring off his body by the time Steve jogged to a stop outside the barracks door, his arms and legs so overloaded with lactic acid that he could barely feel them. He walked in a wide circle for a couple more minutes, occasionally stretching his quads and hamstrings and shaking his arms loose as he sucked in huge gulps of air, trying to re-oxygenate his overworked muscles. He did not want to tighten up suddenly during his flight later that morning.
Something about the description caught Tony's eye, but it wasn't until the third reread that he realised that it sounded an awful lot like the speech Aldrich Killian had given in his presentation for Aminacin, shortly before he broke into the Tower and kidnapped Peter.
Steve sniffed, nodding.  “Yeah, I am.  I just… it’s funny how certain things just seem to happen that don't seem like such a big deal at the time, but then—then—”
"I mean, it's totally fine if you do," he quickly added. "I just… it's probably not all that fun. Is it?"
"That's what I was hoping," Papa said as he ruffled Peter's hair. "Sleep now, little guy. I love you."
Tears welled in Tony's eyes, trailing down his cheeks before he could stop them. "This is mostly due to him, Colonel. He's the one who developed the UI, and designed a lot of the hardware, and—"
"But I didn't say a single word about Peter," Steve added. "Not by name or by implication. I only spoke about you and your father."
"You're gonna make us late for dinner," Tony gasped as Steve broke away, kissing down his neck to his chest before dropping to his knees in front of him, teasing the sensitive skin of Tony's thighs and pelvis as the hot water rained down across his back and shoulders.
“You're not just some college girl working down in data entry, Tony!” Obie had shouted.  “You're Tony Stark, the goddamn CEO!  And you need to set an example!”
"Pictures of what?" Ned asked as he suddenly appeared behind Peter's left shoulder. Peter jumped, almost knocking into Gwen as he grabbed her hand, tugging her around.
“Tony, I didn't mean it like that,” Steve says again.  He attempts to move, as he’s just realised he’s half-sitting on top of his shield and it’s not at all comfortable, but gives up almost before he begins.  “I’m just—”
"Fuck, baby, you feel so good," Tony said on a moan, his eyes rolling back as Steve slowly withdrew his fingers, adding a bit more lube before pressing them back inside. Normally he would take more time, starting with one finger and working up to two, but somehow he knew that on this night, Tony wouldn't tolerate him going that slow.
"Mr Stark, new evidence has recently been unearthed from the wreckage at the destroyed power plant, and if you don't mind, we'd like to ask you a few questions," said the officer. He stepped back, holding out his arm. "If you would come with us, please—"
Tony thought, confused. The pilot wasn't familiar, as Tony was certain that he would've remembered someone that unbelievably hot, but by the way he was glaring at Tony it almost seemed like he knew him, and for some reason had already decided that he hated him.
"Honey, we can't just lock him in his room all the time!" Tony said, firmly but gently. "As much as I wish we could. But he's fifteen now, and finally he has some decent friends that he wants to spend time with and who want to spend time with him. And this girl, Liz, she's just as big of a nerd as Pete, so I'm guessing they're all just gonna be sitting around eating pizza and playing Trivial Pursuit or something. Not exactly what I would call a wild party."
And the whole time Steve's eyes never left Tony's face, as if he were afraid that if he looked away, Tony would disappear.
Tears stung Steve's eyes, welling up before he could hide them or blink them away. In a flash, Tony's expression changed from annoyed to comforting and he tugged on Steve's arm, leading him over to the couch against the wall and gathering him into his arms as soon as they were seated.
"Steve," Natasha said as she rushed forward from a nearby clump of trees, grabbing the shield from Steve's left hand just as he pitched forward, nearly slipping from James's grip. Steve grunted as he struggled to regain his balance, lifting his head slightly to meet her eyes, which were just as shocked and sorrow-filled as he felt.
Steve nodded as he wiped the spit from his mouth and pulled on his cowl, positive that his face was as red as Tony's armour. "Yep. Ready whenever you guys are."
"That won't be fast enough!" Tony rasped, his heart threatening to pound out of his chest. "We've still got Carol coming in, and—"
"Well, that is indeed good news," said Thor. He retook his seat at the head of the long conference table, around which already sat the rest of their team. Including James, who had apparently just flown in from D.C.
"Oohh, honey, that's good," Tony said once he'd swallowed, clearing his throat. "What magic did you use to conjure up this concoction?"
Steve heard Tony say just before he reappeared inside the training dome. For a moment, he felt frozen, his arms aching to hold his son and unable to comprehend why Peter wasn't here, when he had literally just seen him, alive and well.
"Okay, so, who'd they ask?" asked Cam. "'Cause I thought Howard Stark was supposed to be the so-called expert on that kind of stuff back then."
“What in the goddamn hell is this?” Obie bellowed as Fury finished fastening the cuffs.  “Tony, are you really gonna stand there and let this happen?  After everything we’ve been through together?  C’mon, kid!  I’ve known you your whole life!”
Pepper’s brow furrowed as they reached the ornate wooden door to Tony’s office.  “That's actually what I’m trying to tell you, Mr Stark,” she said.  “Mr Stane is waiting for you in your office.”
Tony grinned, one so beautiful and carefree that Steve could almost forget that they had just finalised a plan to save the universe.
And maybe even offer another layer of protection for him as well. Because while Steve didn't believe that Peter was in actual danger, or at least not at the moment, with the way things were getting murkier by the second it certainly wouldn't hurt for Peter to have two more people to help watch over him when his dads couldn't.
"Precisely," answered Thor. "In fact, I've reason to believe that that gem is also one of the six infinity stones."
What Tony now had to decide was if his love for Steve would be enough.  Both for Steve, and for himself and Peter.
With a somber shake of his head, Uncle Bucky slapped his palm against the remains of the wall and disappeared outside, shouting instructions to the people already gathered outside to move away from the theatre. Peter waited until he was completely out of earshot before grabbing a discarded baseball hat from the disgusting floor and shoving it onto his head, pulling the hood of his hoodie up over it. He didn't have anything to cover his face, but he highly doubted that anyone would be looking too closely at who he was as he attempted to figure out a way to get the trapped people free.
And of course, Toomes was absolutely refusing to say a word to anyone without having a ridiculous immunity deal in place first, which Steve was taking as a personal affront. He was so frustrated that he had already punched through the wall in Tony's lab once, and barely been halted by Bucky a second time.
Or eye-fucked, as Bucky so cleverly liked to say, something that Steve had witnessed between him and Sam more times that he cared to recall. Those two were definitely crazy about each other, as were Carol and her boyfriend, from what Steve had seen.
"It's all right," Tony cut in. "It's… actually good that I know about what's going on, 'cause… well…"
“There's nothing down here to watch for.  And besides, you are injured, and I am not,” Tony says slowly, like he’s talking to a very small child.  “Therefore, you need the rest.  End of story.”
"All right, Captain, in ya go," said Colonel Rhodes as he opened the car door, holding out his hand for Steve's arm. Tony quickly jumped out, hurrying around to help Steve into the wheelchair. With his poor vision he hadn't realised that Colonel Rhodes had brought him around to the special emergency entrance reserved for military personnel, so at least any of the people who saw Steve would know why he was there. As soon as Tony wheeled him inside three doctors sprang into action, setting up a solution to soak the gloves from his hands and cutting the boots from his feet as an ophthalmology specialist was called in to examine his eyes.
"Oh, that sounds good. I'm looking forward to it," Peter said. He looked down at his unfinished dinner, shoving a few more bites of fish into his mouth so he didn't look too rude, even though everything he'd already eaten was just sitting in the pit of his stomach like a massive brick.
"Aww, why the hell for?" Clint whined as Natasha started dragging him from the lab. "I like the red so much better…"
for him. That I'd tear the whole world apart if I had to, just to keep him safe." He raised his head, locking eyes with Steve. "And, that I'd never, ever make him wonder if I loved him."
"Oh, Dad, I so wish you could've seen it!" Peter exclaimed as Steve and Thor came up behind him. "Ned and Gwen and I were all just standing around outside waiting for our rides when Flash came out, and he was trying to be all cool and stuff because apparently his dad just bought him a new phone, and he was trying to tell us that it was so much better than our StarkPhones because it can take panoramic videos, but when I tried to tell him that my phone can take panoramic videos too he called me an idiot and said that I didn't know anything about videos 'cause I never take any videos, which is just
"I'm sorry, sweetheart," he whispered as he loosened his vice-like grip, massaging Tony's fingers. "I'm just—"
," Lang said as he gestured between Tony and Steve. "That whole thing where you have a complete conversation with just your eyebrows? 'Cause let me just say that that is really, really cool, and I am way jealous."
Madison Square Garden was already packed to the gills as Peter, Gwen, and their three chaperones made their way through the winding concourse up towards the luxury boxes. Uncle Thor was leading the way, but since he was pausing every few seconds to sign an autograph or smile for a photograph, it was taking literally forever for them to get to their seats.
"Dad probably means the Spider-Man," said the oldest boy, causing Peter to freeze. "He really doesn't like him, even though I thought he was cool."
"Thank you, Colonel," said Steve. He offered him a salute, which James reluctantly returned. "Please—"
Sniffing, Steve closed the sketchbook, swiping at his eyes as he took out his phone. Based on the time, Tony would be leaving to pick Peter up from school in a few minutes, no doubt with Bruce in tow. They'd probably stop somewhere on their way home to get Peter something to eat, and then spend most of the afternoon and evening in Tony's lab, working on their various projects. Tony had told Steve that he was very close to getting his nanotechnology finalised for his next armoured suit, which meant that he'd be bringing up the possibility of building Steve a nanite suit as well, something that Steve had already tried to refuse more than once. He and Tony were very different in their preferred fighting styles, and Steve had absolutely no desire to wear armour.
“Steve,” Tony says, drumming his fingertips on the table.  “He told us to call him Steve, remember?”
Peter sniffed again, swiping at his nose with his sleeve as he pondered.  “Just some orange juice, please,” he finally said.  “I’m not—I’m not really all that hungry.”
"Right," Bruce said. "So that would involve us going back in time, wouldn't it? And also involve us having to deal with all of the possible ramifications of going back in time?"
"I think he's implying that after flying for over twenty hours in relatively close quarters, that the air you'll be expelling from your mouth might not be very pleasing to whoever this prince is that we're about to meet," answered Natasha. "Which, in your case, would be the truth."
Bucky's head jerked back. "Whoa, just hold on a second. You're telling me that someone's refusing to operate on a sick kid just because… well… why, exactly?"
Tony nodded, offering a quick, "Thanks, J," before smooshing his face back into the pillow, wishing like hell that JARVIS didn't have to make such a distinction.
"Information from me would not be secondhand, and you know it," Steve said through clenched teeth, his jaw twitching madly. Tony could tell he was trying hard to hold back his temper. "I just don't think it's worth putting you through this when it's not necessary."
"Sure as hell seems like they were waiting for us!" Carol yelled as she rolled to avoid an oncoming missile. "Watch your backs, boys!"
“It’s exactly what it says it is,” he replied, relieved when his voice didn't quiver.  “It’s called a pharmaceutical printer.”
“Ohh,” he rasps as his blood pressure suddenly takes a nosedive.  He immediately rolls onto his side and squeezes his eyes closed, breathing in through his nose as he tries to staunch the raging flood of pain and nausea threatening to overtake him.
"So, how're you feeling?" Steve asked as he pulled the chair over to Peter's bed. It really was the most uncomfortable thing that he'd ever sat in, and a small part of him wondered if that was the case in all of the childrens' rooms or if it was just yet another way to discriminate against Peter's family.
"Oh, I bet you had loads of fun," said Peter. "Um… so I don't know how much you've told Steve about—"
"Well… this whole movie date thing reminded me of it. Something that George Stacy said to Pete that night he was was over at their house."
"But we still haven't made much progress with that data from Mongolia, or managed to locate any of the people on that list," Steve said. "And after what George Stacy said to Peter at that dinner, I'm just… it's no wonder he was too upset to notice the peppermint in that cake. I still can't believe how rude Stacy was to him, Tony. It wasn't Peter's fault that the Chitauri killed his partner, but he made it sound like we personally pulled the trigger."
Steve grinned, showing off the dimple that gave Tony heart palpitations. "Well… I try. There's no way I can compare to you or Peter though."
"Jesus Christ, Pete!" he gasped, gulping for air as he took in his sweet son, who was dipping into a full-sized bag of Doritos. "Buddy, you've gotta quit being so damn quiet!"
The fact that there were still a few pretty heavy secrets between him and Tony wasn't helping matters. Unfortunately, Steve couldn't seem to figure out a way to bring up the fact that he had met and gotten to know Peter before he'd even met Tony that didn't sound stalkerish or otherwise creepy. Tony had already told Steve all about his son, including his name and the fact that he was in the hospital, so Steve really had no more excuses for not telling him besides his own fear.
Scott paused his frantic pacing, tilting his head up towards the ceiling. "Ahh… I'm actually not—I mean, I don't—I don't exactly know, so—"
“He was in the Army, Dad,” Peter stated.  “From when he was eighteen years old till just a few months ago.  And what he said was that even though the whole Don't Ask, Don't Tell thing had been repealed, it still really wasn't safe for people like him to be out in the open, especially in the kind of unit he was in.  So I took that to mean that he’s gay, and that he had to hide it until he got out.”
"Yes, and you still love me," Steve said. He brushed his lips across Tony's in a light kiss. "Let's go to bed, sweetheart. I think we could both use an earlier night."
sketchbook—and show Tony an absolutely drop-dead-beautiful drawing of that very same cabin, complete with a fully-stocked fishing boat out on the lake that held himself and Peter, with Tony standing by the house waving at them as they motored away.
"Did you honestly believe that I would remain unguarded?" Thanos sneered in Steve's direction. He jerked his head over to where one of his minions stood a few metres away, one of the very same aliens who had landed in New York at the beginning of this whole mess.
It was always good to know exactly who you were up against, and Steve wanted to collect as much data as he could before he finalised his plans, even if all of the garbage spewing from the mouths of the pro-registration senators had almost made him angry enough to punch through the living room wall more than once.
Tony caught her hand before she could exit the tub. "Thank you, Nat," he said quietly, with as much sincerity as he could muster. "Pete is damn lucky to have you."
"Breathe, sweetheart," Steve murmured in Tony's ear as he kissed up and down the cords in Tony's neck. He groaned once he was fully sheathed, his forehead thudding against Tony's shoulder as he breathed in a shaky breath. "Oh God, Tony, you feel so incredible. I'm not—I'm not—"
Steve thinks as he tries to discreetly rub at the sore spot, swallowing the grunt of pain that tries to break through.
"Well, at the risk of sounding patronising, Pete's always been able to see right through anyone," said Tony. "I'm pretty sure those eyes of his are magical or something, because he can detect someone's bullshit from further away than I can even see."
Steve’s “obsession” with hunting down HYDRA and finding Bucky caused Tony to think he was in love with Bucky.  Which means this whole time Tony was sacrificing his time, money, and time with his son to help Steve find Bucky because he wanted Steve to be happy.
A mission that proved to be futile, as minute after minute slowly ticked by. Steve watched through their bedroom windows as the stars moved across the sky, telling himself that he wasn't scanning for possible incoming attacks, but knowing he was only lying to himself. And then, as the first tiny slivers of light began to peek through the surrounding skyscrapers, he shifted again, carefully tucking the blankets up over Tony's shoulder before sliding out of the bed and padding towards the bathroom. He still wasn't planning to go running, as his foot did need the break, but there was no sense in just lying in bed when he wasn't asleep. Time was short, and there were plenty of other things he could be working on instead.
"You kinda sound like you're trying to start courting her when you haven't even been properly introduced yet, Rogers," she said. "And I would've thought you would've known by now that that is no way to treat a lady."
"Gotcha, Tony!" Sam yelled as he landed directly on top of one of the suits, aiming his guns at its neck. "Good call!"
"She means she figured out that Peter is Spider-Man, Mr Stark," Stacy said. "And that he was leaving to go search for Captain Rogers."
“Dad’s right, Papa,” Peter said as he hurried over to Papa’s side, reaching for his other hand.  “You can do it!”
"Hey, little guy," Steve murmured as he got to his feet, holding his arms open for a hug that Peter stepped into without any hesitation. Steve closed his eyes as he buried his nose into his son's downy soft curls, tears pricking behind his closed eyelids.
A wave of emotion suddenly hit Steve square in the chest, and he gasped, prompting Tony to grab onto his hand.
Steve just had to trust Tony. Which he did, implicitly. Then he had to come up with a new plan for the impending battle in Wakanda that didn't include him.
"Have you heard the new rumour going around?" the guy asked in the loudest whisper Peter had ever heard in his life. He glanced around, leaning even closer. "There's some people who think that the Avengers went back in time. You know, to fix stuff?"
Smiling so wide that his cheeks hurt, Peter replaced the phone on his bedside table and clutched his polar bear to his chest as a wave of sensation washed across him, remembering the feel of Gwen's tiny hand in his own, and the way she had hugged him as they said goodnight.
Dad let out a sigh, one so heavy it probably would've knocked him over if he hadn't been sitting down.
What he did know, though, was that aside from helping his ma, there's no way Steve would change anything that had happened.
After quickly brushing their teeth and changing into sleeping clothes, they were just about to crawl in next to a sound-asleep Peter when Steve's datapad began to beep, indicating an incoming message.
looks. "Uhh, yeah, it kinda does. No surgeon means no surgery, which means my heart, and therefore me, is pretty much outta luck."
Tony blinked.  “Um… so then why the hell were they assembled?  We don't usually assemble hardware before it’s ordered, do we?”
him.  Steve had only been gone for less than four hours, but it already seemed like days with how empty the penthouse felt, and Tony had never liked emptiness.  While Steve still kept the Tower apartment he had moved into after the Battle of New York, Tony couldn't remember the last time he’d actually stayed there, preferring to spend his days—and nights—with Tony and Peter in the penthouse.  Tony had even remodelled one of the spare bedrooms into an art studio for Steve’s recent birthday, and, with Peter’s encouragement, had been
"Come on in, Peter," Pepper called through the door, her secretary having already announced that he was on his way.
Crawling over to his husband, Steve carefully laid Peter down on the floor next to Tony before pressing his lips to Tony's forehead, his ashen skin already ice-cold.
“But—!”  Papa broke off as his eyes flicked first to the image, then over to Dad.  “But… sweetheart, this is—this is when I told them I was leaving, that I was gonna come to New York and open my store.  When I told them that I never wanted to see or hear from them again.  And—if I change that, then what happens?  If I hadn’t come here and opened my store where I did, then I wouldn’t’ve met Peter, or you, and—”
“That does appear to be the case, Master Peter,” answered JARVIS.  “Which I find extremely curious.”
"So, anyway, I was thinking," Peter said to Gwen as they slowly shuffled out of the gym after practise. Peter had to admit that he was getting excited for the big competition, as Gwen had proven herself to be just as capable of a captain as Liz and their team was really whipping into shape.
"So, I was thinking," Steve said once their entrees had arrived, the finest steak and lobster that New York City had to offer.
"I'm sure it wouldn't be the first time," Steve answered. With a final squeeze, he raised his arm and sat up, helping Tony off the bed.
"Little stick coming, Pete," Tony warned, his heart lurching when Peter let out a whimper. "It's all right, buddy. I'm here."
"It's no problem," Steve said as he opened the door of the one-bedroom guest suite. "I'll leave some clothes outside the door for you, and if there's anything else that you need, just ask JARVIS for help. We can reconvene after you've had a chance to get some rest."
It took Steve about three seconds for it to fully sink in, his heart thudding so erratically that he felt lightheaded. It all made perfect sense now. Peter's eyes and hair were the very same shade of brown as Anthony's, his nose was the same shape, and, now that he thought about it, Steve had even noticed a few similar mannerisms.
"Ready for the most intense, most difficult battle of your lives?" said Dr Strange. "Because make no mistake, this battle we are about to enter will be just that. I have seen firsthand what can happen when certain powerful beings ignore the dangers that come with meddling with different dimensions. Or universes."
"I'm thinking I should give you another neck and shoulder rub once we get home," Tony murmured. "You seemed to like it the last time."
that Fury's fucking analysts only calculated a three point four seven chance of another space attack, or whatever the hell it was that Fury said. I still believe that an attack is imminent, and that we, as a team, need to be prepared for it."
A stab of pain pierced Steve's heart. All those nights that he spent listening to his mother sobbing into her pillow, cursing the name of Howard Stark.
At the moment, though, Tony didn't feel like listening to the boisterous god of thunder. In fact, all he really wanted to do was curl up in his husband's arms and go to sleep.
"Not like I'm gonna turn down the opportunity to see you naked," Tony said with a wink, earning a weak half-smile from his husband as he got started on Steve's hair, saving his bruised and swollen face for last.
"Yeah, only if Thor promises not to shout with glee every three seconds," Dad said as he took his turn kissing Peter goodnight. "And I thought
"Yeah, I will," said Natasha. She smiled as Steve tossed his crushed-up bottle into the recycle bin. "Enjoy your run. Looks pretty nice out there today."
and I'm just so scared that I'm gonna drown again!" His long fingers curled around Tony's forearm, pressing it into his chest. "I'm so
Clint raised his eyebrows. "Yeah, yeah, all right. And we'll all obviously keep our eyes peeled, so—"
"Oh come on, Steve!" Bucky said. "In trouble with who? It's not like everyone else doesn't already know what's going on between you two!"
Peter let out a heavy sigh. "Yeah. And… he got kinda loud at one point and Ms Sharon had to ask him to leave, so… I'm not sure when he's gonna be back."
The document continued on for several pages, spouting more nonsense about HYDRA's philosophy of total world order through what basically amounted to controlled chaos, the same type of rhetoric that Dad, Papa, Uncle Sam, and Auntie Nat had found hidden in the old SHIELD bunker up at Camp Lehigh that had housed Zola's consciousness.
"Duly noted, J," said Tony with a sigh. He curled his hand around his left arm, squeezing against the tingling pain that always flared up when he was anxious. "Go ahead and run another diagnostic while I talk to Steve, make sure he's okay with starting production."
Clint bursts into laughter over the comm.  “Way to leave Cap hanging out there, Thor!” he yells as Steve flips over the handlebars of his bike, launching it directly into the path of an oncoming truck full of guns-blazing HYDRA soldiers.  He cringes as the truck explodes, taking the bike right along with it.
I’m always eager to hear what you think!  Please don’t forget to hit the kudos button and leave me a comment!  😊
"That'd definitely be handy," Tony answered through his mouthful of sauce-laden bread. "Things tend to go a bit faster when he's around, with the whole summoning lightning thing and all. Even if he does act a little too Shakespearean for my taste sometimes."
"Yep. I'll be here." Tony's heart fluttered as Steve pressed his fingers to his lips, then to the screen before it went blank, something he did whenever they were separated.
"His heart rate's a bit elevated, which isn't too surprising since we just moved him," Sharon said, removing her stethoscope. "It's something we should keep an eye on though."
"Please, don't get up, sweetheart," he said again as he handed Tony a pair of his sleep pants, tucking him under the covers once Tony had pulled them on. "I want to remember you lying in our bed just like this while I'm gone, with that look of contentment on your beautiful face."
"Well, I suppose I could give it a look-see," Tony said. "I'm sure Bruce and I could figure out some way to jury-rig it into flying again. But there's no way I'm leaving here until we know that Pete's gonna be okay, and since we don't know how long that's gonna be—"
For an entire month they kept him, drugging and torturing him to such an extent that Tony was positive that the only way Steve had managed to keep himself alive was out of sheer stubbornness. By the time Peter discovered HYDRA's hidden base and alerted the rest of the team to Steve's location, he was so badly injured and otherwise out of it that when he first laid eyes on Tony after the ensuing battle, he honestly believed him to be yet another HYDRA apparition.
Steve also couldn't help but notice that in addition to having the same eye and hair colour as Anthony, Peter's hands were also the same, with beautifully long fingers.
Doctor List looked so genuinely taken aback by Steve's statement that Steve would've laughed if he thought it wouldn't hurt so damn much.
With a choked-off gasp and his eyes still tightly closed, Steve shifted slightly, trying to manoeuvre his hand underneath him so he could at least push his body up off of the freezing cold floor.  But he’d barely moved a single millimetre before the pain suddenly ramped up to a completely unbearable level, and he had no other choice but to cry out.
A huge thank-you to my wonderful betas She’sLikeTexas, JehbeeEh, and allthesinnersandallthesaints ♥️
In fact, on second glance, it was almost funny how one-sided it looked, kinda like the entire Avengers team had assembled to take on a simple bike thief or something. The warg creatures were all pretty much done for, their ugly carcasses littering the plain while the Giant-Man and Hulk squashed out the remaining stragglers, and the aliens seemed to be in full retreat, forming a line about fifty or so metres away with Thanos at their centre, the gauntlet on his left hand and forearm shining in the bright Wakandan sun.
“Papa missed his scheduled check-in, buddy, and Fury’s worried that he might’ve run into some trouble,” Tony rushed out.  “So once I figure out a few things, I’m gonna go in and try and find him.”
of the Nazi deep science division, as the entire world became painfully aware of with the reveal of Project Insight.
"But do you think you could find a ship?" Steve asked, almost frantic now. "My—my husband, and my son, they were taken aboard one of Thanos' ships at the very start of the battle, and we haven't seen them since."
"Yes, goddamnit!" Tony shrieked, even as his heart sank down to his knees. Emergency medical transports were expensive, costing more credits than he earned in an entire year, but Tony knew that he didn't have a choice. There was obviously no way that he could trust Howard to keep an eye on Peter while he drove him to the hospital, and since civilians weren't even allowed to be on the streets without a military escort during blackout periods Tony couldn't risk the chance of being pulled over.
decide on what we manufacture.  So as long as we’re not reneging on any of our contracts, I can do whatever the hell I want.”
On this night, though, Steve seemed to be almost as impatient as Tony, pulling him flush against him as his tongue slipped between Tony's lips to taste him. Tony whimpered as their tongues stroked together, the hints of tomato sauce, garlic and wine mixing in with the inherent flavour of Steve more intoxicating than any whisky or drug had ever been.
—had just walked right into the biggest stone, steel, and concrete trap they had ever seen in their lives, and one that was completely invisible to the outside eye.
"And neither does calling me Stevie," Steve snapped. Bucky's eyes immediately went wide, causing Steve to raise his hands in apology. "I'm sorry, Buck. I didn't mean it like that."
And Tony wasn't upset with Peter for saving Stacy. It was absolutely the right thing to do, and in Peter's shoes both he and Steve would have done the same, but that didn't mean he wasn't terrified of the possible implications of it. Concussions often messed with a person's memories, so there was a slight chance that Stacy might not even remember exactly how Peter managed to save him. But if he did…
"Well, maybe 'cause your fingers are still white from gripping the handlebars?" Peter said as he jerked his head towards Steve's hands. "And your back and shoulders were all stiff too, like you were afraid something was gonna happen on the way here or something."
Tony cleared his throat, giving Phillips what he hoped was an appreciative nod as he set the first of his slides into the overhead projector and switched it on.
"Tony," Steve murmured as they reached the building. He pulled open the door, stepping back to allow Tony to enter first. "Sweetheart, your mind's been whirring nonstop since we got back here yesterday. Are you sure this is still such a good idea?"
He jumped as someone knocked on his door. "Come in!" he said, hastily closing his notebook, tapping it with his fingers as the door opened and Dad poked his head around it, his face lighting up as soon as he saw Peter.
And while the computer was so old that it took almost five minutes to completely boot up, it was at least better than nothing.
“Ahh, why don't we hold off on the battle stories till after we take the bunker, ‘kay there, Thor?” Clint says.  “‘Sides, they always sound better after a few beers.”
Because while Steve has become sort of used to being in constant pain, he’s not a masochist.  If he had a choice, he would much rather bury his head in the proverbial sand than spend the rest of his life having to live with the knowledge that he allowed himself to be used in the worst kind of ways by someone who was supposed to love him.
"Nah, I wouldn't've called that a palace," scoffed Quill. "Ego's place was a palace. Knowhere was just… kinda like a nice house. A big nice house."
"That's good." Peter paused for a moment, and Tony could just picture his adorable pursed lips and scrunched-up nose as he debated on whether or not to tell him something.
"Yeah, and when he did go he was bored out of his skull," Tony grumbled. "None of the goddamn teachers could even attempt to keep up with him, so they just labelled him a problem and didn't even try."
“Hey, now!” Rhodey suddenly called from the direction of the parking lot, Agent Danvers on his arm.  “Who said you guys could start having fun without us?”
"Just stay just like that," Peter said as he slowly swung his legs over the side of his bed, taking care not to get tangled up in the numerous wires and tubes attached to his skinny body. His notebook and most of his bedding hit the floor as he inched closer to the edge, pausing once he was there to suck in a deep breath, the all-too familiar sound of rattling lungs nearly making Steve's skin crawl.
"Well, then it's a good thing I'm here," Steve said. He tapped his palm on the counter, returning Sharon's smile. "Thanks, Sharon."
"There you guys are!" Peter exclaimed as soon as they stepped inside, his round face so pale and drawn that Tony's heart gave a painful lurch. He had been trying hard to deny the fact that despite being in the hospital Peter's condition was still steadily worsening, but it was getting to the point now where it was almost impossible to ignore.
But then again, O'Brien had been in control of the country for twenty-eight years, and not once had he ever mentioned anything resembling peace. In fact, it seemed as though in recent years that he'd grown even more warmonger-like, insisting on bigger weapons, more aircraft, more soldiers and pilots, and more and more sacrifices by anyone who wasn't military. There was even the odd rumour or two that the old general was ill, starting to lose his mind, but they were so hushed that no one ever dared to say them out loud.
Steve exclaimed, gaping at his husband. Tony had never mentioned anything about this to Steve before. "You never—wait, Loki did
"Tony," Steve said, giving Tony's hand a quick squeeze. "Okay, Mr Lang, so you do understand that Tony here is not his father, right? And I'm sure I don't have to list for you all of the ways that Tony and his company have helped not only the people of New York, but all over the world."
"You think they've got any aircraft that are space-capable?" asked Carol. "I mean, that one that almost got Steve was an X-302 plain as day."
As they had originally planned, the entire team was in D.C. with Tony to watch Peter's competition. Even Bucky had made the trip, keeping as incognito as possible with sunglasses, a baseball cap, and an oversized hoodie covering his metal arm.
"I'm pretty sure that's not at all how it's supposed to work, Ned," Peter said through clenched teeth. "But can we go inside now? It's cold out here!"
Peter shook his head, not meeting her eyes. The last thing he wanted was to ruin the only date they would get for the entire summer.
"Yeah, they're almost all he owns. He wanted to get me a red one, but after Papa read something in a magazine about how cops tend to go after red cars more often, they decided on the blue instead."
"Maybe not," Tony finally said. "But everything that happened afterwards was. You not only managed to destroy your own life, you also destroyed Mom's and made mine pretty much a living hell. I can't go anywhere without people throwing me dirty looks just 'cause my last name happens to be Stark! And then—" He broke off as tears welled in his eyes, remembering Peter's freezing-cold, pasty-grey skin on that horrible night when he nearly died in his own bed. "And then, your ignorance and incompetence nearly killed my son! Peter almost
"Not too much, babe, yeah?" he said as he worked himself open. "You've already got me so damn close from that naughty mouth of yours."
His voice trailed off as he looked over at Steve, pleading silently with those puppy-dog eyes of his that he knew neither Tony nor Steve could resist. It had been almost three weeks since the fire monster attack at the movie theatre, which, aside from a few local news stories, had garnered a surprisingly small amount of attention for an Avengers-level type of threat. Thanks to Bucky and Peter's heroics no one inside the theatre had been seriously injured, and the Stark Relief foundation had already covered all of the medical bills and the salaries of the first responders involved, which Pepper had made sure to let slip to the media.
"No, don't you be 'Tony-ing' me right now," he snapped. "You know damn well that I'd much rather be woken up with a kiss and a soft, 'hey sweetheart, can you help me hop on over to the bathroom?' or something like that as opposed to you smacking your face into the floor 'cause you're too damn stubborn to admit that you need me to help you."
"Yes," answered Steve. Thanks to their new diplomatic alliance, he and Tony had been discussing with King T'Challa the possibility of the three of them visiting Wakanda over Peter's upcoming spring break. "King T'Challa informed us just a few days ago that he was able to commune with his ancestors and confirm this theory. The Soul Stone's current location is in Wakanda."
"Longing," Sam said in a clear, firm voice, watching as Bucky's jaw twitched and his teeth clenched. "Rusted. Seventeen—"
As the announcer finishes introducing the rest of the field, Steve presses his palms against his goggles again before covering his head with his second cap, a white one emblazoned with his name beneath the American flag.  He had at first been resistant to the idea of wearing two swim caps, as he honestly preferred to wear zero most of the time.  But since Coach Phillips nearly had a coronary when Steve suggested sticking with only one after his semi-final, he gave in.
The elevator doors had barely slid closed when Steve turned to Tony, curling his arm around his waist.
"That's normal, Tony," Bruce said from the opposite side of the tub, preparing what appeared to be a splint for Peter's hand. "Even lukewarm water will feel uncomfortably hot at first against frozen skin, but he needs to get in there as soon as possible."
“Well, have you found a date yet?” Obie asked.  “‘Cause if ya haven't, I’ve got this one girl who’ll work out just great.  She’s blonde, and—”
Steve gave a slight shrug. "I'll figure something out. But the most important thing is that you're not alone anymore, Tony. There's the two of us now."
Peter hadn't realised how tightly he was holding his fork until he looked down and saw that it was starting to mould to his fingers. He loosened his grip, trying to bend it back without looking too obvious as he struggled to think of a response.
For a moment Dad only stared at him, his chin trembling as about a thousand different emotions flew across his face. "And why would this so-called friend of Stacy's tell him that?" he finally asked.
"Oh yeah," Peter answered. "Papa and Uncle Sam do most of the cooking while the rest of us watch football and try and stay out of their way. Then once they're done we eat and play games. Or fall asleep on the couch, in my Uncle Clint's case. He always says that's what you're supposed to do after eating Thanksgiving dinner."
"No," answered Dr Strange, bobbing his head from side to side. "Well, yes, actually. But like I said, it really doesn't matter now."
Last-minute confessions of love only happen in books, not real life.  And as much as Steve might hate to admit it, even if they’re currently experiencing something out of a goofy science-fiction television show, it’s still real life.
"Uh huh," he said as he licked his dry lips, his brown eyes a bit less confused now. "Dad? What—what happened to me?"
A soft noise escaped from Tony's throat as Steve drew him impossibly closer, his hand splaying across Tony's abdomen as he tried to soak up every single second of their closeness. Warmth bloomed across Steve's chest as he recalled how Tony had woken him in the middle of the night, how Tony's lips had brushed across his neck as his slick fingers curled around his erect cock. As soon as Steve had peeled his eyes open Tony had climbed on top of him, rubbing Steve's cock against his ass as he pleaded with his frightened brown eyes for Steve to help him chase the nightmares away.
"Absolutely," said Steve. He cupped Tony's cheek, brushing a soft kiss across his lips. "What else can I get for you?"
"Mmm," said Ned. He leaned closer to his screen, lowering his voice. "The Daily Bugle says all these security breach rumours are just a big scam to make the Avengers look better because of that anti-vigilante legislation that got shot down. I'm not sure how many people actually believe that, because, I mean, you gotta look at the source, but—"
"Yes, but unfortunately I doubt that your security will be good enough," said Thor. "Which is why it is imperative that I accompany you on this mission. I absolutely must discover if my vision was correct."
"Got it!" Peter said as he took off running, launching his web at the target's arm as it flew by. Steve gasped as the target used the web rope as a slingshot to try and fling Peter off, sending him flying as he yelped in surprise.
"Home," Steve said, attempting to nod as his hand came up to cover Tony's. "I want—I want to go home."
"Damnit," Tony muttered. "All right, then I need you to get a hold of George Stacy right now and ask him to pick up both Pete and Gwen inside the entrance to the museum. Give him the Cliff's Notes, just enough so that he knows what's going on. Then let Pete know that Stacy's on his way, and tell him to wait there at the museum with Gwen until he picks them up. Tell Stacy to take the kids back to the penthouse and wait there until they hear from us."
Grabbing his polar bear, Peter stuffed the plush animal under his chin as he took out his History textbook and opened his laptop, getting to work on the essay he was writing about the origins of the Civil Rights movement.
"Now the key to a smooth re-entry involves mainly two things," Tony continued. "The first rule of thumb is to not try and re-enter too soon, or prior to your go/no-go, because… well, Captain Barnes, what'll happen if you attempt to break your orbit too soon?"
Tony's brown eyes crinkled at the corners as he smiled. "Not a thing at the moment, hon. Just keep the kid happy, which you're damn good at."
He hadn't wanted to admit it, but that had been the first time he'd been able to picture the three of them together, as a real family.
Peter gave a nod. "Yeah, me too." He honestly couldn't imagine how worried Papa must be, while still trying to coordinate the rest of the team with the Wakandans.
In fact, he had already suggested to Tony that once everything was back to normal—or at least, the Avengers' version of normal—that they should take a well-deserved break and return to that same Italian coast, this time just the three of them.
And while it wasn't exactly the future that Tony had envisioned for Peter, he and Steve had long-since decided that as long as their son was happy, that was really all that mattered.
of yet another breaking finger sending shivers down his spine so harsh and icy that white spots began to dance in front of his eyes.
"Call the hospital!" Tony shrieked as he fumbled with the fingerprint authentication for the oxygen connection, swearing when his shaking fingers refused to cooperate. "Goddamnit Howard, didn't you fucking hear me? Pete's colder n' hell! He's dying!"
"That's right. I am," answered Steve. He leaned back in his chair, pointedly ignoring his growling stomach. "And I'm not gonna let you give up on yourself. I love you too much to let you do that."
"Sounds great." Picking up the hand mixer, Steve got to work, mashing the perfectly boiled and seasoned potatoes while his teammates bantered back and forth behind him. By the time he was done and everything had been brought out to the table, set perfectly by Bucky and Bruce, Steve's cheeks were sore from smiling.
Tony's eyes immediately went wide, then slammed shut as he fought the strong urge to grab Stacy by the scruff of his neck and slam him up against the wall until he told the truth.
"It doesn't matter if you believe me or not," Tony said as he slipped his fingers underneath Steve's waistband, palming his glorious ass. His breath hitched as Steve shuddered, right before Steve's hands suddenly slid down Tony's body to his thighs, hoisting him into his arms.
"Oh, yeah. Papa’s told me a bit about that," Peter murmured. Papa had told Peter the story about his super-serum procedure a couple of times, but it was still hard for him to imagine his papa as anything other than the tall, strong man that he was.
After crossing the street, Peter hurried over to the bookstore’s storefront, smiling widely as he noticed the hand-drawn artistry covering the plate-glass windows on either side of the door.  The left side featured a fully-loaded bookshelf drawn in a rainbow of colours, complete with bookends and three tipped-over books on the top shelf, while the right side was the picture-perfect reading nook, complete with a squashy beanbag chair, an adjustable reading lamp set on a small table, a glass of water, and a bowl filled with something that looked like popcorn.
"Ahh, was that supposed to be a compliment?" Ned asked, staring at the door to the gym as it swung closed again. "'Cause—?"
For all of Tony's nervousness, the dinner went remarkably smoothly. Sarah had prepared one of Steve's favourite meals, some kind of sausage and noodle dish along with some homemade bread that wasn't like anything that Tony had ever eaten before, but tasted absolutely amazing. Whoever it was that ran the mess hall at the barracks had absolutely nothing on Sarah Rogers.
It wasn't easy to eat pasta and seasoned bread with only one hand, but Tony managed, finishing off his entire plate as he and Steve talked. It was yet another thing that fascinated him about Steve, he was just so easy to talk to. He listened without any hint of impatience or boredom, never tried to interrupt, and always asked such relevant and interesting questions that proved that he wasn't just giving Tony lip-service, he actually seemed to care about what he was saying.
"Mmm," Steve mumbled, grimacing as Tony slid his freezing-cold palms across his husband's chest, searching for possible signs of injury. Usually it didn't take Steve this long to figure out that something was wrong, especially since Tony's nightmares tended to be noisy, with a lot of kicking and flailing around. Steve's Army- and serum-sharpened senses never allowed him to miss the fact that something wasn't quite right.
The boy scowled. "It was in Social Studies, Dad, a section on bullying and how to stand up for yourself. We watched a video."
"No," Steve said as he covered Tony's lips with his fingers. He sucked in a shaky breath, squeezing his eyes closed in a vain attempt to stop his tears from flowing. He knew exactly why Tony didn't want to hear what he had to say, but he still needed to say it. For his own sake as much as for Tony's.
"No, Clint, they're just as human as we are," Steve answered, with only a touch of impatience. "And since we've already verified the coordinates twice, I think asking a third time might be pushing it a little. Wouldn't you agree?"
It was silly how easily those three little words could relax Peter, almost as much as the steady heartbeat beneath his ear. "
"Hopefully at his next appointment, Dad's taking him back next Thursday morning," answered Peter. "He was pretty upset that he needed the second one."
"Yeah, yeah, I know," Tony muttered. "Just… work as fast as you can, but no cutting corners, yeah? We can't risk anything getting into the Tower's systems that's not supposed to be there."
With a single nod, Steve tucked his shield into its corner and settled into the pilot's chair, flipping the various switches as James sat down next to him.
"Buddy, how long has Steve been coming to see you there at the hospital?" Tony blurted out. May as well just get it all out in the open.
Grabbing the blanket he'd set aside for the picnic, Steve hurried out of his room and headed down the hallway toward the mess hall, finding the usual array of sandwiches, bags of chips, and fruit that were the typical diet staples of the evening and overnight patrol crews.
And then, in spite of having a giant axe embedded in his chest, Thanos raised his gauntlet-covered left hand, embossed with all six of the glowing Infinity Stones, and snapped his fingers.
"Captain," Thor said over the comm. "I have seen Prince T'Challa and his warrior guards safely to their transport. How can I assist you?"
"I'll tell you soon, okay?" he said, frowning when Steve's worry wrinkle deepened. "I promise. Just… not right now."
"Master Peter is currently sleeping comfortably, Captain," JARVIS said gently. "However, I am afraid that I cannot say the same for you."
Steve smiled proudly as several of the other committee members nodded in agreement, tilting their heads together to share their own stories of the legends of Captain America. Tony watched as Senator Davis's expression morphed into something that could only be described as murderous, only for a second or two before he was able to regain his composure.
They rode to the hospital in a blur of blaring sirens, with Rhodey, Sam, and Carol following behind in Rhodey's car. As soon as Steve was wheeled through the doors the doctors sprang into action, hooking him up to IVs and checking him over for other signs of injury.
"He's gone!" Steve cried, groaning in pain as he tried to roll onto his side, halting when his hands cried out in protest. "Oh God, Nat! He's—he's gone! My boy is gone, and now… I'm just so afraid that I'm gonna lose Tony too!"
"I can assure you that Peter will be well taken care of, young lady," Papa said in his Captain's voice. "Now, is there someone we can call for you?"
There was no longer any doubt in his mind that Davis not only was HYDRA, but that he also knew about Peter.
Peter heard another blip inside his mask just as Dad got suddenly launched across the destroyed street, bouncing inside a roundabout over a block away. Peter cried out as he slammed to a stop against a clump of trees, only for the massive alien to launch his hammer and grab onto him, hurling him back across the circle right at Uncle Bruce.
"Aaarrggghhh!" Peter groaned as he slammed the top of his computer closed and buried his face into his blankets, his glasses digging uncomfortably into the sides of his nose. He had just spent the last three hours decoding the longest HYDRA file on his list, and for all of his work he had found exactly nothing of value.
Tony stopped him with a hand on his arm, his upper lip curling into a sneer. "Honey, it can't be fixed. This guy attacked Pete, and now he's gonna die for it."
Deep down, Steve knows Natasha is right.  That just because one guy turned out to be a controlling, narcissistic asshole doesn't mean that all of them are.  And, based on the limited interactions Steve had with Tony Stark yesterday, the man definitely did
"Oh God," Steve gasped as his belly gave a violent swoop. "Nat, did Fury send anyone down to search the vault yet?"
"Ah, Scott?" Steve said, grunting when Scott nearly jumped out of his skin. "Um… this is Captain Rogers. Can you please tell us what you're doing here?"
“So, have you ever set a leg before?” he asks, trying so hard to sound casual, and failing so spectacularly that he lets out a choked-off laugh, causing Tony to raise his eyebrows.
Peter thought as he resumed work on his essay. There was no point in getting Dad's hopes up if it just turned out to be another dead end.
Three months ago, Tony would’ve answered Obie’s question without hesitation, his eyes firmly trained on the impeccable knot of Obie’s tie instead of his face.  And three months ago, Tony likely would’ve returned to his office with his tail between his legs, berating himself for once again forgetting the real purpose of his company.
he begged, finally getting the suit to shift just enough to avoid crashing into the wall before guiding it to a semi-smooth landing on the concrete floor.
Another sharp cry from the table sent a massive shiver rocketing down Steve's spine as Image Peter started thrashing from side to side, trying to break from the metal bands holding down his limbs.
"I know," Steve said as he cupped Tony's cheek, his thumb tracing softly along his cheekbone. "But I'm going to anyway." And then he dipped his head and kissed him, one of
“Sounds awesome!” Peter exclaimed.  “Oh, I can’t wait for this weekend!  It’s gonna be so much fun!”
As soon as his screen went blank, Peter flopped facedown onto the bed, hard enough to send his polar bear bouncing over the side and onto the floor. Sighing, he leaned over to grab the bear, hauling him back up and setting him down on his pillow. He'd been really hoping that his dads would've come home from D.C. that evening, but for how tired they'd both looked Peter supposed he wasn't surprised they were spending an extra night there.
He also seemed to be a bit more relaxed, with his eyes brighter behind his glasses and his shoulders less stiff, like something heavy had been lifted from them.
"No, he's not," Tony cut in. "Steve adopted him, but they don't share any blood. You wouldn't know it, though. Pete's so much like Steve it's almost scary."
"Well, unless you're about to tell me that you were just eye-fucking Phillips then I'm guessing that you think Stark is hot!" Bucky said with a laugh. "And if I'm wrong and you really were eye-fucking Phillips, then I don't think I wanna know, so—"
"Steve," Tony said softly, drawing Steve's attention back to the monitor, where Tony was pointing to the last line of displayed text.
"Don't you think that if the wizard's aware of how we win and he's still refusing to leave, that we should maybe do the same?" asked Gamora. "He said he saw over fourteen million possible outcomes, and only two of those were victorious!"
"Oh Jesus, Pete, I'm sorry," Dad said as he raised his head, his eyes scanning Peter up and down before holding out his arms. "You cold?"
The mantra repeats on a loop inside Steve’s head as he climbs onto his block.  Slowly and deliberately, he slides forward until his toes are just over the edge and then bends over, swinging his arms behind his back three times.  His left shoulder twinges slightly on the third swing, but he ignores it.  This is no time for annoying shoulder twinges.  Not when there's a gold medal on the line.
"Goddamnit!" Tony yelled, grunting in pain as he dove down, trying to shake the stupid thing off his tail. That was the third direct hit that he'd taken in that very same spot, and he was definitely starting to feel it. "Rhodey? Where the hell are you?"
It was a good thing Steve knew the route between the hospital and the base as well as he did, because driving with Tony practically plastered to his back was so intoxicating that Steve almost felt like he was drunk, something he had never before experienced. The Project Rebirth serum had made it such that he was unable to get drunk on conventional alcoholic beverages, and before the serum he had always been too sick to want to indulge in anything more than the occasional sip or two. He'd barely pulled into his barracks parking spot and cut the bike's engine before Tony was grabbing his hand and practically dragging him towards the door, with the two of them barely making it inside his room before Tony's hands were on him, sliding underneath his t-shirt.
Anger welled up inside Steve's gut, so strongly that it almost frightened him. He hadn't even met the child yet and already felt very protective of him. "Okay, but you're not saying that his parents—that they're—?"
Tony's eyebrows shot up in surprise before he even realised what he was doing, and he let out a small cough, gritting his teeth when he felt a hot flush creeping up his neck. While he knew that the Air Corps pilots had to have some minimal level of intelligence in order to get to fly all the fancy fighters in the first place, in all of his years working as a civilian liaison Tony hadn't had a single one ask such a question.
The soothing sound of waves lapping against the beach slowly pulled Tony from the deepest sleep he'd had in months, maybe even years. Against his usual instincts, Tony allowed himself to awaken slowly, his limbs deliciously heavy and his mind at peace, something he'd once feared he would never experience again.
"You are welcome," Papa said, with a rather conspiratorial grin. "Now, will you please try and get some sleep?"
"I'd—I'd like to help you, Mr Stark, if—if I can," said Gwen. "Maybe if I could take a look at Peter's computer or something we could figure out where he's gone?"
"That would definitely not be the best place to have that conversation," he muttered to himself. He let out a heavy sigh, raking a hand through his still-damp hair. He had thought about asking Tony if he could take him out to the hospital one night and visit with Peter then, but that seemed more like an end-around to his problem instead of a real solution, and Steve had never been comfortable with end-arounds. It always seemed too much like cheating.
"I want you," Steve growled low into Tony's ear, his lips traveling up and down Tony's neck and shoulder. "Ba mhaith liom tú chomh holc sin. Please, sweetheart, can I have you?"
Steve hesitated a moment before responding. Tony had promised him that he could build him a nanite housing unit that looked exactly like part of his regular uniforms and, true to his word, he had. To any outsider, his new suit appeared to be no different than his usual Captain America uniform.
"Yeah, well… maybe I'm just trying to not be so type-A all the time," Peter retorted. He didn't want to admit just how much time he was wasting daydreaming about Gwen. "Like I said, I'll start on it this weekend."
Unfortunately, Dad still needed to find some hard proof that Beck did actually steal from Stark Industries. They had Beck on record as saying that he'd had more of the CTX-616 manufactured, but since he was still a Stark Industries employee at the time it didn't count as proof that he had stolen it, so Peter was hoping that he would find something about it hidden inside the HYDRA files.
Dr Cho gave him a kind smile as she gently patted his arm. "I'd like you to take it easy for the rest of the night, and make sure to stay warm. Heating pads on the most painful spots will help with the tingling. You should be okay by tomorrow, but if you wanted to stay home from school I wouldn't be opposed."
"Nope, nope, I'll be fine," insisted Bruce. "Just need to work the kinks out a bit first. I'll be ready."
"Oh, like we're the commoners," Ned said. "You do know that Peter's dad could literally buy your dad's entire company and turn it into a ping-pong hall or something, right?"
Tony rolled his eyes as he blew across the rim of the cup before taking a careful sip, shivering as the coffee burned its way down his throat and into his empty stomach.  “If you're trying to imply that in my old age I've somehow forgotten the definition of insanity, then A, you're wrong, and B, okay, you’ve made your point.  So run it again.”
"Thanks. I'll see you soon." And then he stood up from the bed, took hold of his shield from its spot by their door, and stepped out of the room, finally allowing Tony to release the floodgate of tears that he'd been desperately holding back.
The first thing Tony noticed when he opened his office door was that somehow, Steve had managed to become even more handsome than he'd been just earlier that day. Dressed in a blue t-shirt that clung to his broad shoulders and exactly matched his eyes and those perfectly worn jeans that showed off his magnificent ass to perfection, he was quite literally a living, breathing wet dream standing right there in the hallway.
The most important thing was making sure Steve was in an environment where he felt safe.  Sam had described untreated PTSD as being similar to a live wire, dangerous and unpredictable, and ready to ignite at the slightest provocation.
"Okay." He heard Steve draw in a shaky breath, letting it out through his teeth. "Now, I'd like you to picture that I'm getting down on one knee, and I'm asking you to—"
"Oh gods, Tony," Steve groaned. He bit down so hard on his bottom lip that Tony winced. "You don't—you don't have to, but—"
Peter wasn't a baby anymore, but that didn't mean he didn't still enjoy being babied a bit when he was sick, and he had to admit that Dad and Papa were very good at it.
There's no way he's going to be responsible for leaving a young boy fatherless.  Especially after growing up fatherless himself.
Tony leaned back in his uncomfortable-as-hell seat, trying to find a position that didn't aggravate his already sore back and shoulders.
“T-Tony!  Are you there?” he tries to call, managing only a weak sort of croak.  “Tony?  Wh-where are you?”
In fact, if he never saw him again at all Tony was fairly certain he would be just fine. For almost his entire life Howard had brought Tony nothing but pain and anguish, and Tony could no longer afford the energy it took to try and fix things.
Sucking in a deep breath, Steve turns to face Shostakov head on.  “I think I’ll survive without you,
"No, probably not," Steve said. He leaned forward, pressing a soft kiss to Tony's lips. "I'd like to introduce you to her, and I'd like to do it soon. Would you be okay with that?"
"That's forty-eight for, and fifty against, honey," Tony said quietly, his voice quivering. "It didn't pass."
"Quill does hate Thanos," Tattooed Guy said as he and Gamora came up behind them. "Because Thanos is Gamora's father."
“The simulation was successful, sir,” JARVIS stated once all the sparks had faded.  “Congratulations.”
"I'd just like to take him, please," Steve insisted. He shifted so he was leaning against the back of the tub, holding his arms out for Peter. "Please."
"I know, and I'm sorry. You just—you've been doing so much for me already and I know it's been wearing you out because you're trying to heal too, and I'm just so ready to get his stupid thing off of me that I thought—"
, if it’s all the same to you, I’d like to introduce your compatriots,” Tony said, dripping with the kind of sarcastic false sincerity he’d had mastered since their very first semester at MIT.  “If you don't mind, of course.”
"Steven Grant Rogers, I love you," he said as he slid the ring onto Steve's finger. "I love you because you not only did you take the time to get to know the real me, but that once you did, you still chose to love me anyway. And with this ring, and in front of these witnesses, I promise to love you and only you, for the rest of my life."
The sound of the flipping switch echoed throughout the vast basement laboratory, causing Tony to jump as the blue solution began flowing into Peter's arms, legs, and torso. Steve grunted, his fingers tightening around Tony's as he recalled the feel of the freezing-cold liquid burning its way throughout his body, following the paths of his main muscle fibres.
And Steve just can’t have that.  Not when Ma’s health and financial security are at stake because Brock turned out to be a complete asshole who—
“Good afternoon, Master Peter,” JARVIS said as Peter stepped inside his bedroom.  “I trust you had a good day today?”
"Up?" Tony said as he reached a shaking hand towards Peter's face. 'Up' was what Peter always used to say when he woke up from his naps as a toddler, and was also the very first word he spoke after he woke up down in Miami.
“Tony,” Steve says as he shimmies closer.  He raises a tentative hand and places it on Tony’s knee, relieved when Tony doesn’t jerk away at his touch.
Steve broke off as the pink flames of embarrassment crept up his neck to his cheeks, along with a hefty dose of pride.
Which, as it turned out, was a lot easier said than done. Going from being practically bedridden and unable to do much on his own to being able to lift the front of Dad's car with one hand to retrieve a fallen tool had not been all that easy to adjust to.
But he was cut off by a massive crashing sound, followed immediately by three repulsor blasts and several gunshots. Hammer jumped back with a frightened, "Whoa!" just as Peter pulled himself to his feet, stumbling towards the window of his cell and pounding his palm against it.
If he was ever going to convince the military leaders to give his more outlandish ideas a chance, Tony knew he would have to blow them away with his more conventional ideas first, and that meant being as prepared as humanly possible. Even if it was only something as simple as teaching the next round of cocky flyboys how to navigate the newest line in aircraft finery.
"Stand down, you HYDRA piece of shit!" he said, strong but mechanical, almost as if he was being controlled by something.
Thankfully Sam took the hint, changing the topic to the upcoming baseball series between the two most winning teams in the country. Having grown up adoring pretty much anything that had to do with baseball, Steve threw himself into the conversation with abandon, grateful to get his mind off of the Stark family for at least a few minutes.
"I'll tune us in to the government's emergency channel," he said as Steve fired up the engines. "Hopefully they'll know something that's helpful."
"Yeah, call me Tony," said Tony. "And from what Pete's told us, with how hard Miss Stacy's been drilling them, I doubt there's any way they can lose."
"What kind of meeting?" demanded Dad, his hands clenching into fists. "He's not gonna try and blame Steve for this, is he? 'Cause that's just—"
"Everything ready out here?" Steve asked as he exited the panic room, stepping up between Peter and Tony. "Bucky says he's as ready as he'll ever be, so…"
"Yeah, I know it," answered Steve. He took a single step, whimpering at the pain in his burned feet as Tony's arm tightened around him.
"Pete, we don't need all the nerdy details," Tony said quickly. "So, Strange, you're telling me that you can't?"
"Nope," Gwen said, still poking around inside the freezer. She pulled out yet another carton, one that read Hulka Hulka Burning Fudge. "I think I'll go with this one. Do you think Dr Banner likes fudge?"
of the near-constant nebulisers, the hushed words of the doctors as they struggled to get his blood oxygen levels back to normal, the various respiratory therapists who took turns pounding on his chest to help loosen the mucus, and the haunted look in his ma's eyes as she remained by his bedside, barking out any order that she felt the other nurses happened to miss.
As Lorraine returns to her desk, Steve leans back in his chair, hissing in pain when his left shoulder protests him attempting to cross his arms.  He lets out a sigh as he carefully rubs at it, remembering Sharon’s instructions that he work more on his range-of-motion.
“Ahh,” Peter said with a nod.  “Yeah, I guess that makes more sense.”  He snuck a glance at the man, noting that the nametag pinned to his denim button-down shirt said “Steve”, written in the same block-like font used for the aisle labels.
What Tony was preparing to do by stepping inside that store would literally change everything.  Change his life, change his son’s life, and change his entire company.
“Oh please, Captain,” Doctor List cut in.  “This is all really just a waste of time.  The fact remains that—”
of people treating him like nothing more than some helpless little kid, when he'd been the one who had come up with most of the Phoenix mission in the first place.
Obie’s eyes briefly narrowed before he threw his head back and laughed, clapping his hand on Tony’s shoulder so hard that Tony grunted.  “Ahh, that’s a good one, Tony!  You had me there for a second or two!”
O'Brien had been damn lucky that there'd been a force shield separating him from Tony, because Tony had been so fucking angry in that moment that he probably could've ripped apart a vibranium shield with his bare hands.
"It's the week before Thanksgiving," answered Gwen. "They want to give us plenty of time to prepare beforehand."
"So, have you been out to see the kid yet?" Carol asked once she set her glass down, waving the waitress over for another. "How old is he now?"
The next morning he'd repeated the question, especially once he realised that his father was nowhere to be found. But again his mother refused to answer, only telling Tony that Howard was away and that she didn't know when he'd be back.
Papa shot him a rather rueful smile. "Well, I'm hoping Wakanda won't be as stressful for him as New Asgard has been. And we'll all be down there together, which should help too."
which is about a kind of a weird scientist guy who creates a sort of creature that everyone views as a monster. But the monster's not really a monster, he's actually just kinda lonely. You know, trying to find his place in a world where everyone's scared of him. And so he asks his creator, the scientist, if he'll make him a companion, someone else like him so he doesn't have to be lonely anymore. But the scientist says no, you see, 'cause he's already afraid of his own creation, and he thinks if he makes another one that he'll lose control of them both."
“That is correct, Master Peter,” said JARVIS.  “Captain Rogers informed Mr Stark that he had dreamt of the day when his compatriot lost his arm.”
"Well, like I said, Rhodey pretty much had to talk me down from the ceiling, and after that I just kinda stared at Pete for awhile, until he started to fidget and squirm. Pete never liked being in his car seat or stroller all that much, he always preferred being held, so it didn't take long for him to get antsy. And then when I didn't pick him up right away, he started to cry, and—"
"I've never been a fan of wasting words," Tony said as Stacy moved over to Gwen, gently shaking her good shoulder. She woke with a start, her face screwing into a look of despair as she noticed Peter still lying in bed, as still as could be.
"Right," said Natasha after a short pause. "Then I guess we'll go see if Sam's gonna make anything for dinner."
"So, is your entire family going to be coming to the Decathlon finals?" asked Ned. "My mom's already been bragging to her book club about getting to stay in the Stark Industries building."
Not that Tony was an expert or anything, but in his pre-Peter life he had borne witness to more than his fair share of desire enhanced by a stiff drink or three, and it was a lot nicer than Tony was willing to admit to see a similar thing in Steve's eyes unencumbered by the influence of alcohol.
And, knowing how stubborn they both were, Peter highly doubted that it had gotten resolved. The two of them could go round and round on the same topic for weeks and still not resolve things.
"Is that your house that got blown up?" asked the smallest of the boys, who was sitting to Peter's left. "We saw it on the news!"
Grandma nodded, briefly cupping his cheek. "As you should. Bucky and Sam should be here in about an hour or so, once Bucky's done with his physical therapy. I've asked them to bring along some board games, would you like that?"
“So, Steve?  Would you wanna come over for dinner tomorrow night?” he asked, shooting Tony some new variation of his
Grandma sighed, wringing her hands, her knuckles so swollen and bent that Peter was surprised she could even move them.
Steve gave a nod, shooting another furtive glance towards the ball field. "My ma heard about it from Bucky's ma, who'd heard about it from Bucky's dad," he began. "Colonel Phillips, well, he was only a major at the time, but anyway… he'd apparently been conducting certain drills with the cadets, trying to find who he considered worthy enough to test out the serum. Once my ma heard about it she called him up and demanded that he come to the house, telling him that she owed it to my papa to let me be given the serum."
After encouraging Dad to at least drink some water along with his coffee—Peter wasn't brave enough to try switching him to decaf—Peter hugged him goodnight and headed back to his room, where he found JARVIS just about finished with the drone upgrade.
Oh well. It was still a very small price to pay for getting to watch his dads get married, an event that Peter had had no intentions of ever being able to witness.
“Yeah, bud, I do,” Dad murmured into his hair, squeezing him close.  “Pete, I… I don't deserve you.  I never have.”
"I'd really rather not talk about that dinner, if it's okay," he muttered, shoving a French fry into his mouth.
"Oh, and now who's not giving himself enough credit?" Tony retorted. "What about that thirty page essay he's already written for that decathlon competition that's not until April, for Christ's sake? Most of the inspiration for that came from you! And he's got a lot more of your mannerisms and facial expressions than you think, honey. You just can't see it because you can't see yourself, but I can. Plus he's as sweet as they come, and we all know that there's no way in hell he gets that from me, so—"
"Yeah, okay, but…" Peter said, shivering as that eerie, ice-cold bolt ran down the length of his spine. As if crashing down onto an alien planet wasn't bad enough, something else was about to happen.
Tony's heart gave a painful lurch. "We can figure something else out if we get to that point, yeah?" '
"Have you heard back from your FBI connection about Toomes?" Steve asked after several heartbeats of silence.
"You've mentioned that a couple times before," he said, his fingertips tracing around Tony's engagement ring. "Can you tell me more about what you mean? How did Peter save you?"
"I'm not gonna let you slip away from me," he murmured as he brushed a stray hair from Tony's forehead, his heart fluttering when Tony let out a soft moan. He had been so out of it when Bruce first started working on him that he became combative, insisting that he didn't deserve to live after losing Peter and that Steve and the rest of the team should just let him die. It eventually got to the point where Steve had to physically hold him down so Bruce could start an IV, nearly sending Steve into a full-blown hyperventilating attack once it was finally placed that James was just barely able to talk him through.
Just like he’d been when he had grilled Tony about the printers, Obie was sitting in his office, leaning back in his chair and surrounded by his thick cloud of cigar smoke.  He had sat there for several seconds after Tony arrived, just staring at him with that disgusted expression on his face that Tony had come to loathe.
"His name's Peter," Steve spat out, his hands clenched into tight fists at his side. "His name is Peter, and he's the sweetest, most genuine kid that I've ever met in my life, who misses his dad with every single one of his waking minutes, and—" The rest of Steve's words died on his lips as he took in the expression on Phillips's grizzled face, one of shock mixed with anguish.
“What?  I can’t tell my husband that I find him sexy as hell before lunch?” protested Dad.  He held up his left hand, displaying the titanium ring on his finger that Peter had helped Papa pick out.  “Pretty sure this says that I can tell him anytime I so choose, so I would suggest, buddy, that you just get used to it.”
"It's gonna work, mo grá," Steve murmured, pressing a kiss to the top of Tony's head. He trailed his palms up and down Tony's back, sending pleasant shivers of heat through Tony's body. Heat that he hadn't felt since
"D-daddy, P-papa's down there, we g-gotta g-get him out!" Peter cried, his lips as blue as his papa's uniform as he continued to punch against the ice, leaving smears of blood all along the thick cracks that had formed. Tony grabbed onto his wrists, struggling to get Peter to stop before he could cause any further damage.
Steve was just about to reply when he heard a sudden crackling noise off to his left, causing him to jump back. He immediately grabbed for Sam, shoving him behind him just as some kind of glowing golden circle of light appeared about a metre or so away. The circle was rotating counterclockwise, throwing off massive sparks as it grew wider and wider until it was large enough for a man to step through.
"Down in Miami?" Peter exclaimed. "But that was months ago! If his arm's been damaged for that long then why didn't he say anything sooner?"
"I know you are," said Steve. "Just like I know that Peter's in his room right now, waiting for me to help him with his homework. But Tony… I guess I just never thought I'd have to live in constant fear of losing one or both of you, and now… it's like we're stuck between a rock and a hard place. I don't want Peter to suffer, and I can't imagine how awful it's been for him, and for Bucky too, but at the same time—"
"Don't you even say another word, Steve," James ordered. "Just get the mission done. That's an order!"
Steve’s upper lip curls into a slight sneer.  “I think it means that you should get out of my face before I make you, Shostakov,” he says in a low voice.  “Now.”
Steve nodded as he carefully took the tablet off Tony's chest, his heart jumping in relief when he saw that the soft blue glow of the arc reactor was unchanged.
—beautiful upper body. He spent some more time lavishing attention to Tony's scar before moving down his sternum to his abdomen, dipping his tongue teasingly into his navel as Tony's fingers wove into his hair.
If they got one single tiny little thing even the slightest bit off, then the whole thing would fall apart. And quite possibly take all of them with it.
“Tony,” Steve choked out as soon as Rhodey left the room, his blue eyes wide with unshed tears.  “Sweetheart, I’m sorry, but can we—can we
"All right," said Steve. He grabbed onto a piece of pipe sticking out from what used to be a utility shed, pulling himself up on top of it as he scanned the area. "Tony, there's one more coming up on your three o'clock, and Clint—"
"No!" Steve tried to protest as Colonel Rhodes exited the car, walking in his carefully measured steps towards the emergency entrance. Tony had explained to Steve that he and Peter had designed the brace that Colonel Rhodes wore to stabilise his damaged spine, and that Tony had had to get special permission from General O'Brien to be allowed to use the materials he'd needed for its construction. When Steve had asked him why the general had been so reluctant to allow him to build the brace, Tony couldn't give him an answer.
He had taken around five or six pictures when Uncle James suddenly appeared at the slightly opened door.
"Yeah, and I think I'm gonna head on out too," said Uncle Sam. He nudged Peter with his elbow. "Bucky and I are planning to watch the baseball game tonight if you wanna come down."
"You're such a sap, Rogers," Tony said as Steve kissed down to his abs, which contracted at his touch. "But I'm thinking that I'm gonna need a bit more Brooklyn from you tonight."
He had done some research, as he usually did whenever he had a question about something, and had read on several popular medical websites that people struggling with grief and depression often had very little interest in sex.
"I swear to God, big guy, you had better have called me in here for something more than this," Tony interrupted. "'Cause I'm sure it's no surprise that my patience is wearing a bit thin lately, so—"
“It wouldn’t be on the shelf for sale if I wasn't okay with it,” Steve said, smiling softly.  “And while it is a fair price, at least in my opinion, it is still pretty expensive, so… don't you need to ask your parents first?”
"Longing," Sam said, clear and even. Steve flinched as Peter's limbs immediately went rigid, fear evident in his huge brown eyes.
And a few minutes later, freshly cleaned up and tucked into bed with Tony’s back snug against his chest, Steve closed his eyes and slowly breathed out.
