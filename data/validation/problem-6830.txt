That was in the past, and as an adult, Steve completely understood where his mother had been coming from. He didn’t hold it against her - she had just been looking out for her little boy. And after literally being on ice for years, he guessed she was right to be wary of the cold.
“And if you want to do that, that’s totally fine, but if there’s something I did I’d like to know so I -”
“Oh, Steve. I’m so sorry . . .” Tony began to say as he crouched down in the grass next to Steve. “I know you’ve seen me act differently the past few weeks. And I’m sorry. This must have been so scary to deal with. And I just . . . sometimes it’s hard to even believe that our team is real. We have secret spies, a super soldier, a Hulk, the god of thunder - it sounds like fiction. So it’s hard for me to say that something’s not possible, because hell, look at us.
“Yeah, I think so. Thank you Tony, for finding me again.” Steve took a hand and softly caressed the side of Tony’s face.
Steve laughed, and realized that this time with Tony had been the most relaxed he had been in months. He allowed his thoughts to wander, thinking about what it would be like to cuddle with Tony on the couch Christmas morning, hot chocolate in hand and watching snow fall over the city.
“Well, there are a few things. There are a couple of mountains nearby, so we could go skiing. Also plenty of mountain trails, if a hike interests you. And there’s a couple of small towns near by that kind of have the “Christmas village year-round” kind of vibe that I’d love to check out.”
That was all Jan could respond. Tony tried his best to avoid Steve whenever he could for the next week or so.
They chatted, and walked down the boardwalk. They stopped to play some carnival games - Steve was great at the bottle stand game, Tony better at ring toss - and collected some tickets and stuffed animal prizes which they immediately handed over to some passing children.
“You’re gonna make us dance in front of the whole class, aren’t you?” Tony asked, in a jokingly exasperated tone.
The front gate of the campus was filled with smoke and fire. Tony flew up to above the smoke to scan the area.
“You want me to get a feel for his reaction? I’m the god of mischief. Yes, I’m good at knowing when people are being deceitful. Although I’m not sure America Man is
The third time Steve had returned, it had been ahead of the 4th of July celebrations. Given how recent the Battle of New York had been, it had been determined that it would be a boost for public morale for Captain America to celebrate Independence Day - and his birthday - back in New York.
“And that’s not all. Since we’re here in New York you let me know where you want to go and I’ll take you out anywhere, my treat.”
Frustrated, he left the gym to grab food from the common area. He looked at the clock - already after 8 PM - and was shocked it was so late already. The common area was unusually empty for this time of night.
But then they found Tony. And now they were home. But being home didn’t prevent Steve from feeling uneasy, from fearing that Tony, as well as the others, would be ripped away from him again at any moment. Steve had yet to confess his true feelings for Tony because it almost felt like it was tempting fate. And he knew that the unease wasn’t just felt by him.
Tony ignored the flutter of warmth in his chest when Steve smiled at him, just like he always ignored when his feelings for Steve reared their head.
Tony didn’t have to ask, he knew Steve wasn’t going to let him go, that there wouldn’t be a safer place than by Steve’s side. He knew Steve would be there in the morning, and they had finished, and Steve tenderly cleaned them both off, Tony quickly fell asleep hugging Steve.
Tony laughed and leaned over to kiss Steve again. Steve was truly happy, knowing any day he would get to wake up next to Tony would be a great one.
“I own it. I told you I might have a place. Just wasn’t sure if I had sold this one or a beach house I had last year. Had to check. But looking at it now, I’m glad I kept it.”
Tony cleaned up and walked over to the common area. Steve was sitting on the couch, the TV off and the lights dimmed. When Steve saw Tony he immediately stood up.
Steve heard a scream - his own - let out involuntarily as the pressure of teeth tore into his side. A blur of a big dark mass was on top of him, and Steve took a hard swing of his shield to the creature’s forehead, causing it to release him and run off.
“Oh I . . . well, I like my classes this semester. Not sure what I want to take next year though. And I told you, I’ve loved working on armor and learning so much. I might be signing up for some mission in Europe for the first half of the summer, but I’m not sure. Staying here for spring break too.” Steve trailed off with a sigh.
When he returned to the dorm, Sam immediately noticed that something was wrong. Steve explained what had happened.
Steve had never even thought about the possibility that Tony could have feelings for him like that. He let out a whine, wishing he could talk. He had already cherished the bonds they had been building as a team and as friends - but more? The possibilities were endless, and Steve felt his heart swell. He was letting off happy grunts and began to wag his tail in excitement; for a second he had even forgotten that he was still a wolf.
“Steve! I think it’s the new security system. Either it’s been disabled, or tampered with. I’m gonna go check it out.” Following his hunch, Tony zoomed along the inside of the campus wall until he found a control box. He quickly plugged his suit into it and began to hack it.
“I’m sure you all will. And I haven’t seen him but I think I remember seeing a training session of his reserved for the obstacle course around now. Maybe check there?”
“You got up to go with Loki to go talk to Steve, to get that second opinion? And from my understanding from how defensive Scott was getting: a few weeks you told him to make a robot, he and Clint made a robot that would throw footballs so they could practice going long to catch it, except Scott is better at making robots than catching footballs, and the football thrown went too fast right over Scott’s head and right into yours as you were just turning around.”
Sore between tubing and the long hike, Tony changed and made his way to the hot tub when they got back, giving Steve an inviting glance as he exited to the yard. Steve quickly changed and joined Tony outside.
He would be patrolling with Steve. Tony would get to spend an entire night patrolling with Steve! The flurry of excitement and butterflies quickly flipped into panic.
“Just thinking about work. We’ve got a few new products launching soon, a new foundation to help support education starting up, and of course, uh - well the gala.”
Tony laughed and shifted in his seat, pulling Steve in for a kiss. As Tony tried to pull away, Steve pulled Tony back in with a hand on the small of Tony’s back. They continued to quietly kiss, snuggled together on the couch, until they heard an “Ahem.”
They continued around the room, hanging bows and garland, stockings on the wall and big snowflakes on the windows.
Tony sighed. “I haven’t told anyone this, but . . . once in a while, I’ll have a nightmare. About getting lost in that no-tech dimension, away from all of you. Or being stuck on Battleworld before I found you all. Just nightmares filled with that dread, of wanting to scream for help and knowing there was no one there to hear it.”
“Yeah. While I didn’t realize you had feelings for me, it was pretty obvious you did care and that you were shaken up. Deep down I didn’t want to jeopardize that.”
After cleaning up, the two both crashed into bed in each’s arms, asleep the second their heads hit the pillows.
it’s nothing like that at all. I - I -,” Tony stammered, feeling like the air had been punched out of him. “I promise you’ve done nothing wrong. The issue is with me.”
Tony had learned to push his feelings down. Steve was nice, but sometimes just seemed so distant, quiet. Not eager to upset the team dynamic by confessing his feelings for someone that didn’t seem interested, Tony was more than willing to keep his mouth shut.
Steve tapped his head. “Eidetic memory. I’m a visual learner. I just needed to see how these chefs were making things. The rest was easy enough to follow along. And as it turns out now that I know how to cook without burning the kitchen down, it’s actually pretty fun, and makes me feel pretty accomplished.”
“I tried. A couple of times. Once I freaked out because you were so damn handsome swinging on those monkey bars, and a couple other times were, uh, interrupted by a certain pair of football fanatics.”
The second time, it had been during one of their frequently occurring study sessions. This term, they were both in a class that covered adapting technology on the battlefield. Professor Pym had been adamant about assigning group projects this semester and paired Tony and Steve together, going in alphabetical order.
The next day, after a successful night of interviews, fireworks and music, Tony approached a sleepy Steve. “So I called your boss and asked if they’d be so kind to give you a couple days off have a proper birthday celebration. Beyond any world-ending scenario, you now have your first weekend off in I assume - what? Like 75 years?”
Tony put his visor down and began to scan the ball pit. “Okay, alien life. Small, there’s a few dozen here, they’re actually just resting above the actual ball pit. No detections of venom or poisons.” Tony reached forward and put a hand out to the ball pit. One of the creatures that looked like his armor crawled over and into his hand.
Tony noticed that Steve was dressed up, a collared shirt that showed off his waist very well with ironed slacks and shoes.
Steve felt a pull toward the window; he walked over and stared into the night. The moon slowly came into view over the treetops, and as the moonlight grew brighter, Steve began to feel a change.
By the time they had gotten to the end of the pier, the sun was starting to set. Steve walked over to the safety railing around the pier while Tony sat on a bench and took out his phone to take pictures. A few snaps back of the boardwalk, a video of the waves rolling in on the beach, and then he turned his attention back to Steve.
Tony broke away first, beginning to look and fuss over Steve. “Steve, Steve, are you okay? Are you hurt?”
made me nervous and distracted. I honestly didn’t think I’d be seeing you there, those mixers can be fun but sometimes they’re an awkward nightmare.”
“Earlier this year it felt like we were really close - working on projects and missions together, hanging out, you even helped me run for class president. But we don’t do that anymore, not really. Not beyond the class time and work that we have to do together. You used to tease me and joke around with me a lot more. I promise that didn’t bother me - I liked it, but - it just feels like you’re holding back, I guess?” Steve confessed, as Tony’s head began to spin as he was processing what Steve was saying.
“OH COME ON!” Steve shouted. Steve was usually pretty calm, very levelheaded. Desirable qualities for a team leader. To hear him sound so annoyed was unusual - not that Tony constantly paid attention to Steve’s temperament, of course.
“Got the exact same talk from Sam. Many times. Bucky too. They deserve medals for having to put up with me.”
It certainly had been a difficult few months not only for Steve, but for the whole team. This was the first Christmas season since Battleworld. It was now the last weekend before Christmas, and some members of the team had opted for a quick weekend away out of the city, or time with any family or friends. They would all be back for Christmas, as big holidays tended to be an invitation for trouble, so they took some time to themselves now. But today the tower was relatively quiet.
“Any idea what you might want for Christmas?” Tony asked. “I know we usually do Secret Santa but after a year like this I’m getting multiple gifts for everyone anyway.”
“It’s okay, Tony. Let go, I’ve got you.” Tony spilled over Steve’s hand, a sensation that caused Steve to finish inside Tony a few thrusts later. Tony pulled Steve in for a deep kiss until Steve pulled out and rolled over to Tony’s side, both men completely spent. They took a moment to just enjoy the other’s presence, until Steve pulled Tony up to clean them both off.
, Jan. I can’t get a hold of this, this bundle of feelings, it’s just so wild and delicate and it makes me feel like I’m always about to combust and I don’t know how to deal with that. And if I do ask? And he says no? Or it doesn’t work out? I - I wouldn’t -”
He didn’t stop until he burst through the door of his bedroom. He dropped to the floor, curled up against his bed and texted Jan, trying to catch his breath.
Curiosity got the better of Tony, and he joined them all on the couch. Tony’s plopping down on the couch was the only thing that seemed to break Steve’s concentration from the TV. He mumbled a quiet, “Oh hey, Tony” with a small blush behind the ears, as if he had a sudden awareness of where he was again. It was pretty adorable, Tony thought, getting comfortable and turning to the TV.
They both laughed. Steve was happy to just get any answer, let alone such a playful response from Tony. So he wasn’t ready when Tony turned the questions back on him.
After a couple of hours and a stop at a local store for groceries and supplies, Steve pulled up to the cabin. It looked like a scene out of a painting. The log cabin was large, with a covered wrap around porch that overlooked a downward hill leading to a quaint frozen lake that was surrounded by a ring of tall pine trees. The cabin had a beautiful stone path peeking through the fresh layer of fallen snow.
The sessions were fun, and in hindsight, probably the catalyst for Tony’s crush getting worse. Spending alone time with Steve just confirmed that he was as much as a cute dork that Tony thought he was. Hours spent debating designs, watching Steve make sketches, pouring through history books from the Timeless Archives, examining models of armor from the past, Tony tinkering with wires - a lot of time spent in close quarters alone.
“I wouldn’t worry, Tony. I’ve seen your moves at Club A. I think you’d do great,” Steve said, his focus buried in fitting armor plates together so he couldn’t see the new large blush across Tony’s cheeks. Seeing his opening, Tony took a deep breath and began to ask.
Steve laid in bed, not quite sure what to do with himself. It was the evening, but too early to go to bed. Not that going to bed would make much of a difference anyway - it had been a long time since Steve was able to get a solid night’s rest.
“You absolutely don’t need to apologize, Tony. You’re still helping as much as you can and I really don’t mind doing the manual work.” Both of those things were true - as temporarily restricted as Tony was, when Steve would encounter a problem he would bring it to Tony who usually had a quick fix without even needing to look at a computer screen for it. And in the meantime, Steve enjoyed learning how to solder and wire and use new tools. After a few days of building armor, Steve realized why Tony liked doing this so much.
“Would you wanna go to one of the nearby towns and wander around?” Tony asked. He didn’t acknowledge the night before, so Steve didn’t push the subject for the moment.
“Steve - no - of course - of course I feel the same! Please don’t apologize, just a bit surprised.” Tony smiled and threw his arms around Steve’s neck and kissed Steve back. A huge wave of relief rolled through Steve’s whole body and his knees slightly wobbled.
The box was full of pictures he had JARVIS print and little mementos of their relationship. Tony began to sort through the contents.
He wanted to talk to Tony but he didn’t think Tony wanted to talk to him. Was Tony scared of something happening to him? Was Tony scared
Once again, a question that seemed innocent enough. If Tony was planning a trip, he would need to know how many people were going, right?
They left the medical wing and trudged over to Director Fury’s office, with Steve taking Tony’s hand in his with an affectionate squeeze.
Tony laughed, “Listen I’m in my suit, it’s too heavy I might accidentally squish one of these tiny guys!”
“I mean honestly, Tony I really didn’t think you were into me. I even made an opening for you of sorts, hoping you’d take the bait and just ask me out but you didn’t.”
Most of the team seemed to not notice, still giving Steve space to recover. Most, except for Tony. Steve walked around the compound with the sensation that someone was watching him; he’d peek over his shoulder and see a blur of a person jump behind a wall, or in less concealable places he’d catch Tony staring at him only to have Tony immediately look away when caught. Tony wouldn’t say anything, just watch. Steve’s head hurt too much to try to figure out what was going on.
“I danced with a few girls, and that was nice and all, but all I could think about was how cute Steve had looked. I’m doomed to just be a sappy mess forever, aren’t I?”
“What the hell was that?” Tony heard Sam say as he turned the corner and sprinted back to Stark Tower.
“For sure? Honestly? Battleworld. The look of pure joy when you saw me, how you ran to me and swung me around in that huge hug - no one’s ever looked at me like that before.”
Tony first pulled Steve into a small bakery, mentioning an apple crumb pie he had seen from this bakery on TV once. They then moved up the street to a quaint antiques store, where Tony bought a sign from an old blacksmith’s shop. Steve made them stop in a diner for some eggs and bacon, and the two continued to peruse the town for the rest of the morning.
Steve tried to get up and immediately crumbled back down to the ground. “It’s me - I need help, I’m down -” Steve managed to croak out in pain. He’d been hurt before - shot, jumped out of a several story building, hit plenty of times but somehow this injury was different. He felt a burn begin to course through his veins.
Steve snapped out of his thoughts to see a cup of hot chocolate in front of his face, and as he took it he looked up to see fluffy snowflakes falling past the window. Tony sat down on the couch and cuddled right beside Steve.
He peered into the water and sure enough, the face of a fuzzy brown wolf stared back at him, yellow eyes shining brightly in the night. In a moment where Steve thought he should be panicking, he found himself to be calm. The pieces of the past couple months clicked together, it wasn’t all in his head.
It had been a few months since their unexpected camping trip by the lake, and Steve still thought about that night fondly. The crisp air, swimming and telling ghost stories by the campfire, snuggling up at night - it was a great way to make the best of a bad situation, made even better that he got to do all of that with Tony. It had also been a surprising opportunity to enjoy being out in nature, something Steve barely got to do now in his busy life as an Avenger but never got to enjoy as a child.
“Yeah, that sounds great. We can go back to Stark Tower, it’s one of the tallest buildings on campus anyway.”
The first time was three months ago, at the start of the new term when Tony thought he had finally gathered up the courage to ask Steve out on a date after their winter break. He had thought a lot about how he’d ask, but as Jan had reminded him, Tony had asked dozens of people out before, so why should this be any different?
Tony let out a small laugh. “It’s silly, thinking about now. I wanted to ask you out so badly and was too terrified to do it. Didn’t know how. But Jan would always tell me -”
As they reached the halfway point up the Tower, Tony tried to break the silence with a “So, Cap, I -” but was cut off as Steve pulled him into a kiss. Not hesitating, Tony immediately threw his arms around Steve’s shoulders, letting Steve pull him in closer as Tony returned the kiss and Steve’s hands began to roam down Tony’s back to cup his ass. Tony rocked forward slightly, wedging his knee between Steve’s legs. No time for thinking, just acting, and Tony felt like a jolt of electricity was running through him.
The thoughts casually grew to imagining what a date with Tony would be like - dancing, holding hands, and even their first kiss.
“Like shit. They said I have to stay overnight, bad concussion. No internal bleeding or anything like that, but they want to make sure.”
The next few days got weirder and weirder. Steve’s nights were filled with wild feverish dreams of sprinting through the woods, running through streams and hiding behind trees. He woke up feeling like utter garbage, and his days were spent with a low but ongoing migraine. His head hurt; when he went to the kitchen the smells of everything were too much; and he had a nagging pull in his gut - beyond any lingering pain from almost fully healed bite - that just told him something was
of all people? Sure for a few days. But you’d been lethargic for weeks. And yes, I noticed. I monitored. I didn’t want to cause a fuss if nothing was really wrong, so I just watched at first.
Out of the corner of Tony’s eye he watched Steve reach over and pick up a blue one. It sat in his hand and wiggled the little head wings in delight.
Tony didn’t stay much longer. Steve felt bad; it was clear to him that the sight of his injury must have shaken Tony up pretty bad. He knew Tony had seen a lot of terrible things in his lifetime - but it still couldn’t have been easy to see a teammate get hurt. He felt a pang of guilt - he and Tony had a bit of a complex relationship. They hadn’t seen eye to eye when they first met, but Steve was glad to be wrong about his initial impression of Tony. Though they sometimes disagreed, Steve cared about Tony. He was caring, funny, and compassionate; they had different personalities but under Tony’s sarcastic remarks, his handsome smirks, and his showy lifestyle there was a realistic man who knew he could help others, and felt the responsibility to do so. Steve respected that, and like with the rest of the team he wanted to continue to build that bond with Tony. He hoped that this incident wouldn’t cause Tony to pull away.
Meanwhile, Steve could hear footsteps surrounding him but still couldn’t see his enemies. The smoke was covering the source of the beam but it wasn’t enough to cover the ground. He should, at the very least, be able to see the legs and feet of whoever was around him.
“Aww, sorry Tony. I’d offer to stay and help, but I’ve got a training session with Ares I have to prepare for. He asked if I could help demonstrate some tactics to first-year students. Same time next week?”
Steve let out a sigh of relief, and pulled Tony a little closer, and together they watched the snow continue to fall.
“Oh, uh, you know, just passing through! Bye!” he said, and Tony, convinced he must be the same shade of red as his armor, turned and ran back in the direction he came from, leaving an incredibly confused Steve behind.
He began to grow woozy. He looked down to see blood, and his head began to spin. The last thing Steve remembered seeing before passing out was Tony slamming down beside him in the Iron Man suit, face plate flinging open.
“Steve, I love you. I’ve always admired you since I was a kid, definitely had a crush on you when I was a teen - but meeting the man himself? You’re kind, and loving and compassionate and o protective of our team. You make me feel safe and you make me want to be better. You’re my best friend and I just - I can’t imagine waking up and not having you there.”
the pit. The red and blue balls began to vibrate, and a series of mumbling began to sound out from the pit.
Tony entered the room with a small, quiet knock. Steve was happy to see Tony, but was immediately thrown off by the odd look on Tony’s face.
“Oh, you’re finally awake. I’ll go get the nurse,” the aide said, walking out before Steve could even respond.
“Well I’m sure he’ll be running back around to do twenty more laps before you can finish your iced coffee, so you can get another look.”
“You know those two are just going to head over to Groot’s Grove and join the party, right?” Tony asked, pointing over his shoulder at Teddy and Kate as they walked away.
Steve immediately felt a little out of place. A few girls sent Steve flirty smiles in his direction as they entered.
Suddenly, Tony head “Watch out!!!!” from across the quad as he turned around. The last thing he remembered was a brown blur zooming in his direction, and then things going black.
Tony sighed. Jan was right - not that Tony would ever admit it - and this would be a tiny step and a good way to maybe get a temperature on how Steve felt about him.
“My stomach always does a little flip when I see you. You make me smile and want to be better and learn more about the world. You’re so brilliant and kind and I admire you so much and now I’m rambling and listen it’s totally okay if you don’t feel the same I just needed you to know -”
And definitely not the brown wolf whose reflection he had seen in his dream. Steve quickly changed and took a cold shower to wake himself up. After his shower he got dressed and went to the common area to grab some food.
For Tony, it meant pressure. The pressure to keep cool, not be a nervous wreck, to answer Steve’s questions and be present for their work - not daydreaming about how nice it’d be to be cuddled on the couch together as Steve stroked Tony’s hair.
Steve began to explore Tony’s mouth as Tony began to slowly roll his hips, where he could already tell Steve was half hard.
“Sir, next time, can you just let Tony build a new security system for us? He’s pretty great at it.” Tony sat up at this unexpected praise from Steve. It felt like a small boost in confidence he hadn’t felt in months.
Tony felt himself melting. How moving it was to have Steve put his heart and soul into making this meal, and this night, just in the hope that Tony might feel the same. The thought sent a jolt through Tony’s body and propelled him forward. He gently reached over and cupped Steve’s face, meeting Steve’s lips in a sweet, tender kiss.
“Sorry about your Dodgers, by the way. Must have hurt to see that they moved to LA.,” Tony said, as he began to sip from a lemonade as they strolled away from the boardwalk and down a pier.
The last time Steve had gone skiing, it was to chase after HYDRA agents during the war. The pursuit had been stressful (you try balancing ski poles and a shield at the same time) but Steve spent the morning replacing all of those memories with better ones of racing Tony down a slope and grabbing hot cocoa afterward at the ski lodge.
“I just don’t understand what’s so complicated about this. You like him. A lot. Why can’t you just let him know?”
The news was currently on the weather report. “And the skies over the tri-state area are expected to be clear for tonight’s supermoon. Before you go to bed make sure to take a peek outside and you should see a beautiful big full moon somewhere in the sky. It’s sure to be a treat,” the meteorologist said.
But before Steve could finish talking, Tony entered code needed to alter the programming for the cloaking device. Suddenly, where Steve had been standing alone in the smoke, he now found himself surrounded by AIM agents, guns raised, next to a massive tank whose beam continued to assault the campus walls.
“When you said ‘global emergency’ I didn’t think we’d be having an impromptu pizza party,” Tony said, putting his visor down to do a quick scan over the tsums. “Oh! They have skeeball! Want to go play a round while your buddies eat?” Tony asked over his shoulder to the tsum sitting there.
And Steve did as he promised, passing small appetizers to Tony as they walked through the museum and Steve pointed out artists or pieces he knew. They made their way to the rooftop patio, and the slightly cool spring air made Tony move closer to Steve for warmth as they stared out over the last remaining bits of sun setting over the river.
All too often Steve’s dreams would return to the no-tech dimension, the vision of Tony stuck behind in that vivid hell. Nobody knew about the nights he would wake up drenched in sweat, how frequently Steve would catch the sunrise as he spent another night painting or working out alone.
Tony smiled. “Steve, if you were so ready to make our relationship more public, why didn’t you say anything earlier?”
The doors first opened to Steve’s apartment, but Steve continued the kiss as the doors closed and the elevator continued up to Tony’s suite.
is ever upsetting you, or you need to rant or cry or vent about anything, I’m here for you, Tony, no questions asked. I’m not going to pester you about it, or make you talk about something you don’t want to, but I care about you, and I’m here to support you however you need it,” Steve said, letting go of Tony’s hand and leaning back in his seat.
“I think so? They were, uh, pretty unresponsive when we asked. Cap just gave them the look - you know the one - and they said they’d ‘stay out of our hair’.”
He watches Tony turn, blinking stray thoughts away so he can pay attention.  "Hey," Tony responds, wary like he always sounds at the beginning of a conversation these days.
“No,” Rhodey replies.  “That’s because of that one fight with the Vulture you had kid.  You know, the one where there were a metric ton of arc reactors that could have broken in the fall and you could have
“But you will admit Dad has weird fascinations with mustaches though,” Tony groans as he stands up.  “Okay I know you’ve dealt with the weird Zero Point energy lady but seriously Howard Stark’s time traveling son is too much?”
“Why tell when you can show and experiment?” Tony mocks, and Shuri prods something in the wiring of the arm that makes Tony yelp.  They both laugh outrageously, before Shuri pulls backs the instrument and asks how his pain levels are.
The chill in the face of the king had burned.  “We want nothing from the Avengers, let alone the Starks.  Keep your blood money Iron Man.”)
The first time Steve sees Tony, since everything - all he can notice is how much of the same he is.  Talking a mile a minute, sunglasses across his eyes, wild gestures.  He’s chatting with the Spider-Man kid, grinning while T’Challa’s younger sister explains how very wrong they are for making assumptions about something.  Bruce is just outside the group, and every once in a while Tony looks back to make sure he’s still there.  Still a part of the conversation.  Still right there.
The words Natasha uses aren’t the ones that can be translated easily. She switches between languages as she goes, sifting through images on the holographic projection as she speaks lowly. Steve’s stilled in the back, where he was shifting uncomfortably on the sleek modern furniture that Wakanda tends to favor. She knows he misses his well worn place in the couch in Tony’s lab. She knows a lot of things, and Natasha regrets not knowing more in this moment.
“So I have some stuff to finish up here, be home tonight, and we’ll see about heading out tomorrow.”
Steve huffed as he moved along the sidewalk unsure as to what his next move would be. All he'd learned is that most places were eager to sell you something very expensive and not very practical. Steve knew he was a practical man, he wasn't sure if he'd always been, but he was, but both he and Anthony had rather unpractical lives.
Tony growled, as Steve felt him manhandled around and sitting him down, Steve moved to get out of his lap but Tony tightened his arms around him pulling him close once more.
Steve didn’t look up, staring sightlessly at the bar, seeing that soft smile, and those inviting lips.
“Morning beautiful,” Anthony called sitting before his tablet. Steve could see the bright lights of Shanghai behind him.
Fury looked taken aback for a moment before he snorted in soft laughter, shaking his head he pulled a stack of files from his desk tossing them across his desk.
Steve waved a hand exasperated, “Can we stop talking about Buck's sex life, and get back to talking about what I would like to do to you?”
Tony couldn’t stop staring, Steve’s shirt was beyond indecent the damn this was skin tight and boarding on see-through. His fiancée was giving him that smirk again. Tony scanned the room feeling a little possessive and jealous at the hungry eyes that were following his fiancée.
James nodded, it was not the ideal conditions for a rescue, the severe snowstorm was good for cover but not so good to get out of again. They had no idea just who or what was waiting from them in the base below; he hated flying blind.
“I love it,” Tony said brightly grabbing one of the plastic menus and eagerly reading it over. Surprised Steve glanced down at his hands, “Any recommendations?”
Steve looked up from where he was fussing with his cuffs, running an appreciative eye over his boyfriend, looking handsome as sin in his perfectly tailored deep red suit.
Anthony snorted trying to mask it with a cough, both of them dutifully raising their glasses as the crowd echoed the toast. Steve sipped his drink as Anthony nudged him in the ribs, "Be nice Buck went to a lot of trouble to plan this.”
“We could move here, I can work part-time at SI and you can paint, take the West Coast art scene by storm.”
Tony rolled his eyes, "Steve that's Clint, the terrifying-looking woman beside him in Natasha, and the confused looking man in the corner is Bruce.”
“Shit Steve,” Tony’s other hand tightened on his hip as he thrust up Steve meeting the movements, as he panted, throwing his head back he drove himself on Tony again and again. Stars blinking behind his eyes, it felt so goddamn good. He reached back burring his hands in dark hair as Tony panted brokenly in his ear.
“What are you doing here?” he rasped, looking the kitten over. It was malnourished, he could feel the fragile bones through the matted black fur. Gently using his real hand, he felt along the kitten's limb checking for breaks or injuries, only to realize the cat was missing it's front left leg.
Buck was nodding turning to Sam to explain when Tony leaned back looking up at Steve, “I didn’t tell you last night, but that was a sweet thing you did for the kid, thank you.”
He rolled his eyes before he lifted his head to look at his Aunt May  frowning at him from the doorway.
The video flipped to Steve practically bent in half in a window sill fast asleep, Tony took a moment to recognize Shuri’s workshop.
His therapist had thought perhaps it had to do with his own self-fulfillment and self-actualization, that maybe he was looking for something that defined him as a person; maybe a hobby would help. Something that was his own. He was still trying to draw on occasion but it didn’t quite feel…right.
Tony rolled his eyes but was pleased to be heading home. Settling in the car he glanced at his phone trying to keep the pang of disappointment at bay. No missed messages.  He sighed pocketing the device staring out the window as they left the city behind.
“Here are some chips maybe take these in, and I’ll start some popcorn.” Tony grinned at him, before leaning forward a kissing him on the nose.
Peter was belting it out and Steve was bopping along to the music as flew the jet, a small smile about his lips. The video faded out again to another round of photos that had the occupants of the room laughing as they recognized themselves, Tony glaring at Bruce when he saw the photo of the three of them.
“Fuck….yes…love you….yes, yes,” he started moving in earnest then hips bouncing and shifting erratically as he moved around back bowing in pleasure. Steve held on, watching as he took his pleasure-loving every moment of it.
Tony resisted the urge to roll his eyes, he was well used to Steve proclivities now; he wasn’t fussed with the short answers.
Right away Tony had decided to book a two-week vacation somewhere warm, he knew how much Steve disliked the cold, not that he would say a word. His imagination had already conjured up a fantasy of sun, surf, and them; clothing optional.
Steve nodded, and Peter sucked in a breath, eyes lighting as he opened his mouth to speak,  but before the kid could get going the bigger man set a gentle hand on his arm.
Steve gave a small embarrassed squirm, torn between wanting more and wanting him to end his sweet torture.  He felt Tony's strong hands gripping him tightly, unsure what he was about to he glanced over his shoulder just as Tony licked a broad stripe across his hole. The air punched out of him as he couldn't keep silent now as the other probed and prodded, pressing against the tight ring of muscle as he slowly drove Steve insane. Whining he couldn’t help but press back against the teasing tongue.
Bucky blinked, “I don’t get it,” his brow furrowed and Tony, greatly looking forward to watching Sam stumble through that explanation, very suddenly found himself being lifted off the couch and thrown over Steve’s shoulder as the super solider was all but running for the stairs.
Tony had no idea what to say, they must have had a serious existential crisis in the last few hours because they had been dead set against anything he’d been trying to sell.
Anthony's ministrations soon had him hard again, and he found himself shifting the lithe man slightly so they could grind together. Tony huffed a small moan before he reached for Steve's left bringing his metal fingers to touch the most intimate part of him, pressing the fingers into himself.
“Tony, I have the last of the RSVP’s, and the final count for the caterer, I swear she is terrified of Bucky at this point she had to make a last-minute change and-” Pepper cut of and Tony turned looking towards the women curiously.
Tugging his boots back on he stood, it wasn't ideal to fight in the buff, but he wasn't going to back down either. A small gasp behind him caught his attention, as he quickly turned gun aimed as he glanced over the counter, relaxing his finger on the trigger just a quick when he realized it was ten or so civilians huddled together hiding.
The static was getting worse, “Outside…..city…” Steve’s voice was getting further away;  distant fuzzy.
Steve still a little unused to the open displays of affection, he found himself flushing. Nodding gathering the bowls and chips heading back towards the living room.
The kid nodded waving to them as the pair disappeared back into the trees just as mysteriously as they’d arrived. Rocket shook his head as he watched them go, Quill was telling the others more about ‘Christmas’.
Really it didn’t matter as long as he got Steve. Laughing wildly, he tugged on the helmet and swung onto the back of the bike holding tight to the warm body before him, as they sped into the night.
“Danvers," the stone-faced Steve Rogers greeted, beside him the kid was leaning out of the portal phone in hand.
Anthony was still talking to Strange, the men in deep conversation, while Sam and Clint, apparently in the Halloween mood, had started making plans to marathon their favourite scary movies when they got back to the compound. Steve moved to join them, standing with the small group, but watching Anthony.
The thought made him turn slowly over, Anthony by his side slept peaceful and deep. The blue light in his chest pulsing with the steady beat of his heart.
He felt Anthony sigh against him, as he kissed the top of his hair, “What you thinking about?” he rumbled, feeling more than hearing the quiet chuckle.
In his arms, Natasha gave a faint groan of pain. Carefully lifting her higher he trailed after the pair as they cut through the base. Within moments they were outside in the middle of the blowing snow.
“Now, I think there was a promise made involving me and those shorts…” Steve husky voice sent a thrill down his spine.
Steve Rogers was an odd man, but then again so was Tony Stark, together though…there was something so wonderfully sweet about the pair of them.
Bruce tried to smile reassuringly, “Tony I’m sure there is a reasonable explanation for everything.”
His mouth was heaven, and it had been a while…he felt a familiar warmth pooling in his groin, a delicious tension building. Gently he moved his hand to tap Anthony on the shoulder, a warning he was already close. Anthony hummed taking him deeper, hand moving to work what he couldn’t swallow.
Sighing Steve detoured into the park as he continued to work through the problem in his mind. It was quiet in the park as he wandered hands buried in his coat pockets. There weren’t many others out on the blustery November day, and Steve paused a moment to enjoy it. Just as fluffy white flakes began to fall. He eyed the snow with resignation, why couldn’t they just go south? Maybe he could convince the team they should just set up operations on the West Coast during winter.
Heart beating painfully in his chest he hurried to the bedside, “I’m here Anthony,” he assured the panicked man gathering him close. Steve could feel his slender form shaking, as he held on tightly.
Nodding Steve briskly poured the beers, and made up the cocktail before turning his attention to the final man, dark brown eyes looked at him as soft lips curved up in a smile, “Hello beautiful, Scotch neat please.”
The others were still reading off Tweets, some rather raunchy others a little thoughtful and positive about how the Winter Solider was redefining masculinity for a modern age. Many of them more than willing to take Tony’s place as the Winter Soldier’s love interest.
Anthony sighed then, kissing him on his nose, “I know you don’t remember, but Christmas is…it’s the best. Getting together with everyone you love, having a tree to sit around, eggnog and Christmas classics on TV…skating…”
Peter shook his head, “What are you doing here Sergeant, I mean Sir I…” he trailed of thoroughly embarrassed now.
Pep nodded, “Absolutely, I have a friend with a gallery, she loves to showcase up and coming artists.”
Anthony hummed as he smoothed his hands over his shoulders, Steve butted his forehead affectionally, “Presentable?”
Until Tony’s ringing phone jolted them all upright. Everyone blinked in surprise Tony annoyed dug the phone out of his pocket swiping it open.
Curious Tony waited watching, Steve looked neutral, as the young girl approached. Bright blue eyes watching her, and Tony hid a smile, Steve was not confident around children. He could fight with aliens literarily one-handed, but Tony knew this child had him terrified.
Anthony was the first to stir, absently mumbling into his sweat-slick collar bone, "That was goddam amazing."
"Businessman in a hotel bar, finding a lonely man sitting at the bar,” he started, seeing Anthony discreetly adjust himself.
Steve shouldered his rifle, pulling his mask down as he joined the others just outside the front doors of the Stark Industries building. He’d finished clearing the building and had spotted the others out front.
Steve grunted, he could, but he was going to a high school, with children. He really didn’t want to scare them and more often than not his outfit had gotten that complaint from the media. Maybe he could borrow Buck’s uniform? It had worked once before, kids loved Captain America.
Briskly he strode off, Peter hurrying after him, the kid's head was whipping around so fast it made Steve’s neck ache in sympathy.
He shook his head teeth grinding as he thanked Friday heading for their bedroom, he’d get a shower in before Anthony got home.
Steve looked up at him and Tony knew he was seeing him. He smiled down into the sweet face, he looked more like himself.
Steve felt his lips twitch leaning down to whisper in his fiancée’s ear, “I bet you he’ll cry again.”
Steve nodded hesitantly, they had cuddled on the couch together…but the bed seemed different, somehow more intimate. Tony must have sensed his hesitation, “Would the couch be better?”
Everyone they knew had been invited, and the place was a who’s who of hero’s and assorted friends. It was ok though, Steve wasn’t feeling on edge or cagey, he knew these people, he was having a good day. He noticed Anthony’s drink was empty, and he took the glass from him, his love throwing him a smile in thank you as he chatted on with Strange.
“Parker, Peter Parker,” the kid was before him, eagerly shaking his hand. Hank winced kid had a serious grip.
He didn’t say anything, couldn’t as he blinked eyes suspiciously wet. He felt Steve lean against him as he tangled finger in blonde hair, not a word said between them. Sometimes, Tony had learned, silence speaks far louder than words.
He nodded, the teen hurriedly to get him more. Steve moved back a little more into the shadows, content to watch the kids having fun. At least it beat watching horror movies with Buck…guy was the biggest chicken…
Standing Steve quietly headed for the shower, he felt sticky, and grimy his long blonde hair greasy. Striping he tossed the clothes in the hamper before he stepped into the shower letting the warm water soothe his achy limbs. He felt like he was coming out of cryo, the stillness and inactivity had always made him ache, but for once his mind was surprisingly clear.
Steve blinked again, trying to bring his hand up to rub at his face only his limbs wouldn’t cooperate. Frowning, his still hazy mind took a moment to register the reason. He shifted again feeling the clink on handcuffs around his wrists.
Janet blinked at him confused, but before she could no doubt ask more, the man in question was stepping off the elevator. Hank raised a brow, he was a rather imposing figure despite his casual appearance. The jeans and hoddie did little to mask the aura of power that seemed to follow him.
Clean Tony grabbed the oversized towel holding it out as Steve carefully stood, resting his one arm on Tony’s shoulder for balance. Tony wrapping the towel around him, he dried the big frame, whispering soft words of love and support as he got him in fresh clothes.
Anthony grumbled and whined and Steve helped him upright settling him against the pillows and he brought the tray to his lap. Anthony looked awful, pale and sweaty, dark rings around his eyes. Steve encouraged him to eat a few bites of soup, and a cracker before pressing some medicine on him.
“It is,” Wanda sighed content, leaning her head on his shoulder as they moved through the crowed streets. She had been a little hesitant when Vis had asked her to go to Louisiana with him, but now she was glad she had. It was nice to get away from the bustle of the compound for a while.
“Our bartender will get you whatever you like,” she simpered. Steve eyed her before focusing on the group gathering around, all arguing loudly about what they wanted to order.
He clenched his teeth at the stretch unable to help the small whimper that escaped his lips. He felt Tony slide just past the ring of muscle and pause, Steve breathed through his nose as he tried to relax, Tony was pressing kisses to spine again murmuring against him.
Steve caught his breath as Tony was moving again, reaching past him, he heard him rummaging in the bedside table before he was back, pausing to wiggle out of his own boxer briefs and tossing them away. Steve found his eyes straying down, unable to help the small whimper that fell from his lips.
Steve’s quite chuckle trailed off to a gasp of surprise as Tony pulled back, and flipped him onto his stomach with ease. Feeling an odd thrill run through him, as Tony lifted his hips, he buried his face in the pillows his entire being focusing on Tony’s hands and lips as they worked their way down his back pressing kisses and sweet words against his skin.
Those bright eyes crinkled again and Anthony was laughing, Steve hummed pleased, he loved the sound of his laugh.
Permission given he buried his hands in dark hair as Tony teased him, his movements methodical and slow. He seemed in no hurry for it to end, playing Steve like a fiddle as he brought him to the brink before pulling back, kissing his way back up his chest he paused.
“Because when was the last time you broke Twitter with the way you looked?” Rhodes innocently sipped his beer and Tony frowned at him, he knew damn well.... never. Sure, he had a lot of followers, and always got a lot of retweets but he’d never the sort of attention Steve seemed to be getting. Rhodey’s words found their mark; he couldn’t help the sudden unease in his chest.
“Don’t think I will,” Steve teased seconds before he swallowed Anthony’s indigent snort, kissing his husband thoroughly. He had no doubt his husband would pester him about it, his brilliant mind demanding answers, for now though…for now, he'd hold onto those memories, of a sweet smile, and protective arms holding him close.
The fight picked up then and the chatter fell by the wayside as they fought on. Steve was still thinking though, mind working through the possibilities. Really, he didn’t care where they went, whatever Anthony wanted was fine with him they could honeymoon in the penthouse of the tower and he’d be happy.
Finished he put his bag away and headed to the kitchen to get some lunch, curious at how quiet the common areas were. Usually, there were people all over.
Bucky was chuckling as Sam landed the jet and Steve was up and running. He ignored his friend, shouldering his bag he immediately headed for the workshop, hurrying in he felt his heart sink as everything was dark and quiet.
She hesitated a moment, "I think I just had a major issue with this Swiss investor I was just leaving to see….I'll have to bring Tony along if that's ok with you?"
“Are you ok love? I called, you didn’t pick up…” he trailed off, realizing just how suspicious he was sounding. He trusted Steve completely, there was no way…
He could see Anthony’s lips twitching, Sam seemed to be having apoplexy, and Bucky was blushing. Steve felt his own lips twitch up at the corners, Sam was leaning on Bucky trying to suppress his giggles.
The doors at the far end of the hall banged open drawing his attention then. Curious Peter squinted, a massive figure was striding towards him, footsteps echoing heavily in the silent hallway. Suddenly nervous he shifted uneasily, there was something oddly familiar about whoever it was.
(One night when he wasn’t supposed to be up, he had heard Howard and Maria shouting, and he had huddled near the banister, hidden in the shadows as Maria has yelled, “You are going to kill him with your inaction.  Are you willing to create another Steve Rogers for you to carry as your cross?”
When he opens them, Rhodey is falling, and he’s on the ground in Germany watching a version of himself trying - failing - to get to him.
Steve grabs his hand and pulls the warped metal from him, but it’s too late, and he laughs and laugh as he slumps against Steve.  He’s going home now.
Tony bites his lip and presses his face into the pillow and grips Steve’s shoulders, unable to do anything beyond keeping from moaning loud enough that the people three floors down could hear him.
Steve glances at the nearest camera and rolls his eyes before putting a hand on the door knob.  "Three inside, cameras look like two scientists and someone strapped to the table.  Room must be soundproofed because they didn't react to your fight at all."
Smiling softly, T’Challa replies, “Ah yes.  He spoke about how much he missed your companionship and how you would know the right things to say in this instance.  He told many tales of how you had handled situations with grace and humility.”
Tony closes his eyes and knows, knows it down to the depths of his bones, this is it as Thanos starts sprinting to cover the ground, a loud roar echoing from him as he shoves everyone out from in front of him.
The grin grows, and Tony can feel one growing on his own face in a strange echo as hope thumps heavily in his chest.  The other reaches out a hand, and says, “Want to cause some chaos Tony?”
“You always give up a little too easily,” a voice speaks, softly as though it’s something the wind carries with them.
Eventually, Steve paints Tony the way Tony looked at him. Fond and happy, across the lab. Back in the days before Steve could find words, with parts of the suit strung out around him, and if Steve closes his eyes, he can hear JARVIS and Tony arguing.
“I hate you,” Tony says with a passion that makes Barnes chuckle, before adding, “Where am I dropping you off?”  There is another whale coming towards them and Tony would rather get on that now rather later.
They stand out there for a while, watching the construction workers finish up for the day and take off until it’s just the two of them, leaning against Tony’s car, grinning like fools at the half built building.
“Protect!” T’Challa yells, and Tony quickly glances back to the King.  The remaining Wakandian warriors seed the field, putting themselves between the superhero’s and Thanos.
“So all I have,” he says, waving his arms around him.  “Is my usefulness as an Avenger, which only exists if I can use technology.  But I can’t. I don’t know how to build anything any more. I’m useless.”
Steve tears his eyes away from Tony and watches the shadows moving back and forth in front of the glass. It's Clint settling beside his frame, and something in Steve clenches, because he knows this moment.
“Nice of you to show up,” Tony says as he scrambled to pull out a secondary arc reactor out of his jeans pocket and pin it to his chest.  The bots stream out across his skin, suit rebuilding. Friday hums as she connects with the suit and brings the screen up.
"I can't," he starts and then stops. Struggles to find a way to say, every big plan I've ever had has fallen apart on me.
The second time, he opens his eyes to panic and lights that are too bright and familiar-yet-not voices shouting words he can’t recognize.  It’s like the words are spoken and he let’s them fall in one ear and out of the other. He closes his eyes against the light and ears against the noise and thinks,
And Tony just tenses at the sudden feeling. Just for a second. He’s hissing in pain hisses at the pain, biting back a scream for about five million different reasons. There are tears at the back of his eyes, burning, threatening to come out. Because it fucking hurts. The stretching burns his entire body. But everything with Steve always burns. White hot knives every second, so it's not much different from anything else in his life that is twisted around Steve Rogers.
Steve nods and waves, heading out the door.  Tony crashes down with the next wave of pain, eyes shutting as he goes to the ground until it dissolves and then reforms.
Maria had been angry though, reckless when she sneered and said, “Oh of course, only you and Peggy can mourn him while the rest of us sit outside the door.  We can’t breach your inner sanctum.” She had grained then, vicious. “I wonder why you and Peggy never married but you would make each other miserable, but did you never realize that two miserable people were better than four?”
There is a weird play on Steve’s face before he shrugs.  “Just getting used to the feel of all this,” his eyes dart downwards before meeting Tony’s gaze again.  And isn’t that a hell of statement. Technology, superhero fighting teams, aliens, reality TV - all encompassed in one neat statement.  Tony has to hand it to the guy, he can pack a punch even when just talking.
"The Joint Counter Terrorism Centre will be splitting out with a new division called S.W.O.R.D. It has been deemed by the UN that current Deputy Task Force Commander Everett Ross will be taking charge of this new group. They will be the man power behind the additional investigation into all the enhanced individuals during and after the Vienna bombings." He nods to the shorter man who slid into Ross' place beside him moments earlier. "In addition, Commander Ross and his team will be the enforcement behind any decisions the UN makes at this time."
Steve sighs, lowly, before calling out, "I really don't want to fight you" as he puts his hands up.  Tony snorts on the line, and the corner of Steve's mouth kicks up, just barely, but Tony's got the cameras trained on him from multiple angles, tracking any motion in the room and altering him to it in bright orange circles, so of course he catches it.
Natasha and the others will stay because if Tony and Steve fail, the device will tell her, if her memories don't. And then she can try to come back, with Clint maybe. There are other waves after, in case. Plans C, D, E. Because they can't let the snap happen.
He stands there and watches as Rhodey disappears into the next room. Something in him crumbles and rebuilds in the moments it takes to catch his breath. Something ever so small but vital. He stands there, rumpled suit, aching feet, and wet face until Rhodey yells, "You coming Tony? I need an audience for all this awesome."
Kid you’ve worked on improving the SI prototype for the past 2 months.  I’ve seen your crazy hours, including those weekend ones you think SI doesn’t know about,
The fourth and final time, he wakes up to that same blue lights from before bathing the room in a soft glow.  He looks up to a wall of glass peering out into a world he doesn’t know of bright lights, unfamiliar buildings in different shapes.
“About the search?” Tony queries as he shuts down the compound schematics floating behind him. He still hasn’t told Steve. Maybe he won’t ever share this secret with him one on one. Something in his chest shifts at the thought, and Tony can barely breathe for a moment. “J told me you and the flying ace were in Russia last. You find any clues?”
But they aren’t friends enough for those sorts of talks.  Those are the discussions for Rhodey or Pepper, who lean close, so close and look at him like he’s something already far outside their grasp.
Tony shrugs, flips the phone from one hand to another.  “This is me happy,” he defends, feeling the rising anger in his tone.  He winces at the sound.  It’s sharp and rings hollow, enough that it feel obvious, like everyone knows.
Spock is green eyed and female and has a looseness in her gestures Tony never saw in the Quinto version but something Nimoy deployed in those same movies.  She puts her hand up in the Vulcan salute. Kirk puts their hand up against the wall as well. “Live long and prosper Spock,” they say in a raspy low voice.
Bruce had watched as his fingers darted around the hologram, flicking between plans, lines of code, quick sketches and videos that that various blurry faces.  He still doesn't miss the vibrant shield in the middle of the image.  The rest of it is too blurry to make out before Tony switches to the next items in the folder, but there is a giant shield and a silver arm.  A shiver goes down his back, goosebumps blossoming in it's path.
Steve's eyes meet the ceiling in confusion before the beeping registers and then he sighs, a tired worn sigh of someone who knows a hospital too well.  Tony watches as he closes his eyes, like he expects to be alone in the too white room with the loud beeping.
“How would you know?” Tony bites out, bitterness bleeding into every word.  “You’ve been MIA for a few months.”
Tony laughs, clear and free before pulling Peter in close.  “When you hit a certain age, you stop having shame about talking about someone behind their back and just give them a warning before you start some rumor.”
You're in the biomedical group. Minchen is an idiot but he has decent ideas. Perez actually knows how to do good work, so he's your mentor.
“Are you keeping an eye on me now?” Tony asks darkly one day. It’s been a bad one, something going wrong with the project and he’s taken it apart and put it back together three or four times now. Steve’s watched, quietly over the top of his book, lips pressed together knowing anything he says will only make it worse.
Natasha watches as he moves back to the chair, a half slide he gracefully incorporates into his movements when Tony has been drinking for a while. She tightens her grip on the cushion of the chair, and thinks about the briefings she has been a part of. The Soviet Union of her childhood, with the fear rank in the air and the hunted look in everyone’s eyes.
“What use if a futurist who can’t see the future?” he spits out.  “I should have died in the ice because I am useless. I am nothing and I can’t
He pulls up a chair and straddles it, watching Rhodey as he makes his way through the usual exercises. Rhodey's legs buckle fewer times. The familiar soft whine of the calibrating motors is missing front the room now.
“I’ll take care of all of it,” Howard repeats, and Tony closes his eyes so he can stop wondering what exactly he means.
Steve stops them when they are close but not too close into Tony's space. He's been careful about that since they began to share the lab. Tony looks at him sometimes, gaze heavy with something, but Steve won't make him uncomfortable. Won't take more than is freely given.
“Okay,” Steve echoes. They both smile, and for the first time in a long time, it feels like they are on the same page
Still he looks across this unfamiliar room with an unfamiliar view and sees Steve and knows there are a million explanations, but hallucination is the first one he grabs onto. But, he would never imagine him like this.  Worn and older, softer in sleep. A mixture of the calm face, worn with age, lined for the first time in Tony’s life.
Steve takes them to the bed, holding up Tony one handed as he pulls back the comforter before depositing Tony on the bed with a soft bounce. Tony stays there, vibrations still there, buzzing until his skin feels like a swarm of bees about to take off, head feeling like something is closing in on it, and chest too tight.
He swallows hard, and Tony has to push the tears back as he smiles.  “He would have been an amazing father.”
Forcing air out through her nose, evening it out, she lets that regret fall away. She can’t hold them in. Natasha would drown in them if she did.
Tony is silent, watching the replay of the footage.  “She’s lost some of her control.”  He glances back and sees Vision nod hesitantly in agreement. “The collar from the RAFT must have set her back.”
Both times were within the initial ranges they had tested, briefly, back before Germany.  The system hadn’t slowed down yet.  He selects the tab about the version 2 of the suit schematics and double taps before putting the tablet back down.
Tony finishes his whiskey.  “I thought we were working on creating distance from our two families now that Mom and Dad are dead.”
It’s Steve who moves first, reaches up and pulls Tony to him, bringing them crashing together with a bruising kiss that is fierce and punishing, and Tony doesn’t sink into it. They don’t - not this. He pushes back, fighting back just as hard, scrambling for a hold, digging his nails into the back of Steve’s shoulder blades, while Steve is creating an impression of his hand all the way to the bone on Tony’s hip.
He turns back and Vision’s eyes are clear, a small smile on his face.  “Wanda thanks you for her worry,” he replies. “But yes. My systems are running perfectly fine,”
Tony knows the holes in his heart are in specific shapes.  There is Maria, Jarvis, Ana, Peggy, Daniel, and even Howard.  They are cauterized wounds, but they are still there.
“So you could say I have impacted his life negatively,” Tony says, finally, and lets his head fall between his bent knees.  He can feel the pull on his spine, the tightness there. He stretches forwards and feels the pull ease.
Instead, a quiet beep from Fry makes Tony turn to the right, and besides him is Vision, floating.  “Hey kid,” Tony says, a little stunned. “You good?”
“What?” he says, eyebrow raised, but Steve doesn’t take the bait, just kind of sits back and watches.
(His fingers are shaking on the paper.  He can see his breath and his vision is blurry, so he has to keep blinking back tears.  “Your teammates. Your
Tony echos the goodbye, watching as Steve leaves the room.  Every step is heavy, like the world is pushing down on him, crushing him with every little step.  Like Steve is growing smaller with every step.
When the stone speaks again, it sounds like him at eight, voice high pitched and overly enunciating the vowels,
After a moment, he pulls off, pulls back, and settles breathless beside Tony. Fingers still curled around each other, hip bones pressing and sweat soaking the sheets.
" with a familiar glee from before the snap, before Siberia, from before the Winter Soldier or Ultron.
Pepper straightens, plastic smile on as Peter takes the stage.  He carries a tablet with a wide grin, but nothing else. Peter catches Tony’s eye and his face brightens to an impossible degree.  He makes a gesture from training, a slight roll of his right shoulder, and Tony glimpses the woman behind Peter.  She’s an intern, Tony knows the moment he sees her purple badge.  The metal of her prosthetic leg gleams against the light fabric of her sundress as she takes a seat.  It’s not the usual thin rod though.  It’s a slim metal thing made to look like an actual leg.
T’Challa’s face is open and honest, but Starks have been banned from entering Wakanda since 1943, and Tony remembers the conversations he had back when the palladium poison had blackened his veins. He remembers the denial and anger.  He remembers the cool anger of T’Challa’s father when they met last, right after Lagos.
He turns some tales, exaggerating some points that make Rhodey look ridiculous because this will be retold and create some saga that ends in more stories or a prank war and honestly that is what they all need now as Steve starts on dinner.
There.  That's the accords endgame I keep forgetting to tie up.  This was going to be part of the other thing, but it's kind of a key plot point, sooo..
“Michael is dead,” Peggy replies, short and furious, and hurting so deep that she still has to grab on the desk.  It’s been ten or so years, and it still hurts her this deep.
(There are moments between, but they slip through his fingers like water.  All he can do is hold onto the more solid ones keep them close to his chest.  It’s hard in situations like the one he was in.
Tony takes the escalators down, staring down at this phone where streams of data from the last test of the nanobots display.  His mind is curiously blank when he looks at the data, like they are foreign and don’t make any sense.
“I have some news,” Steve says from his place. Tony carefully makes sure his expression doesn’t change.
Thanos scrambles away, and Thor curses loudly before No-Nose brings a shit-ton of bodies streaming at him.  He ducks, and then calls down a lightning strike again.
Between the latest Hawkeye and Captain Marvel, Tony is able to figure out that Steve is the senior Avengers leader.  He has taken a step back in the last six months since Tony was found. He’s back up and team trainer. They commiserate over Steve’s relentless style.
There is a pause, and older Tony influences the scene with the barely a whisper of a thought. "Jarvis," he looks back up. "You're my friend, right?"
“I’m not her,” she replies softly, half curled around the desk and leaning hard.  Her gun is beside her, her hair is pulled back and her lips are red. Peggy stares at him like he isn’t real, like he may save the world or destroy it and she doesn’t know what to do with him.
Tony rages with, “You didn’t even tell me about my parents, and you may have known my Dad first, but he was a bastard.  My mother didn’t deserve that.  I didn’t deserve to have my inability to handle my alcohol haunt my days because I would probably kill my wife like my father did, driving drunk.  Why do you think I have a fucking chauffeur?  Because I can’t drive?”  He scoffs and drinks a little too heavily for the next hour.
Tony grins, one of his carefully crafted playboy smiles he’s perfected over the years of events, galas, balls, in her direction.  “I’m all better. Isolated the issues and got the armor held together with duct tape now instead of just hopes and dreams.” She doesn’t look relieved yet, so he schools his face a little more serious and lowers his voice as he adds, “Carol, I’ve got this.”
“The Winter Soldier,” Steve snorts before shaking his head.  “Buck hated winter. Loved Spring, always made jokes about women blooming out of their winter jackets and other nonsense like that.  God, he would hate it. Hate the title. Hate who he’s become.”
“Working on a new element?” Tony asks, jamming his hands into his pockets and carefully maintaining his distance to his father.
“That’s not how it worked and you know that,” Bruce returns, voice even.  He’s watching as Tony moves, like he’s eyeing a caged animal.
But that’s what he is, under the suit and the smile and the sunglasses.  Under the bravo and the quick grins. He’s just a man, trying to hide his broken pieces, the dents in his heart, the washed out color of his soul.  He’s just a man, trying to solve problems and make the world better. That’s why he’s Ironman, just a man in a suit. Nothing extra.
Steve knows Tony as loud and dynamic and always moving, and he knows himself well enough now that he isn't like that. He's quiet, forceful to a point of rash and chasing what he thinks is right right off a cliff. He has never used words like Tony has, wishes he had.
So, he narrows his focus on what he can understand.  He’s in the future. Steve’s older, but alive. So is he.  Technology has changed. But he’ll figure it out. He always does,
“You know any other person in the world would have balked at that? If you married and we separated you’d be taken care of for life.” Anthony’s look was sad but thoughtful.
Tony nodded, holding his hand as they stood quietly before the piece, around them the brightly lit gallery faded away and it was just them.
“Mr. Parker called earlier this week to remind you, Sargent Rogers was the only one available at the time. He did make a note of it on the board in the kitchen.”
“Thanks, Mr. Stark,” he breathed looking like he was maybe close to tears. Anthony tapped his chest the metal folding away into the housing unit. Steve shook his head at the gasps of amazement around him.
Tony held on for dear life, “Though you were sleeping,” he laughed giving Steve’s backside a teasing smack.
He wasn’t sure how long they stayed like that, but Tony thought perhaps he dozed a while when he came back to himself the movements had stopped and he was resting comfortably in his fiancée’s lap.
"Not anything to write home about," he assured him remembering the constant ache in his limb and chest, the struggle to breathe, the chunky glasses and bulky hearing aid.  He moved his hand to rub at his ear without thinking.
“Usual hon?” The waitress appeared snapping her gum and looking at him. Steve nodded, and she turned to Tony raising a brow.
“Anyway,” Tony shifted, trying to mask the wince as he faced him, Steve watching his movements closely, curiously.
Gently he picked up the black ball of fluff raising him to eye level. The kitten was tiny, fitting in his palm easily.
He opened his mouth, to say what he wasn’t sure, but Steve gently shushed him and Tony snapped his mouth closed, warm fingers were closing his eyes before he felt Steve slide his fingers against his head and begin to slowly massage his scalp.
Steve hid his wince, he should have known that was what he wanted. Fury had been trying to get him to run training for a while now. He had no interest in working with, training, or otherwise engaging with the overzealous youths that Fury was trying to warp. Hell, he'd destroyed the old SHIELD system and wasn't keen to see it infiltrated once more.
Tony couldn’t stay away, he was moving closer to the pair, heart trying to beat out of his chest. She offered him a small smile then and Steve nodded, not a single word exchanged between them before someone was rounding up the kids and moving them away and somewhere safe. Tony watched them go as he came to stand beside the man still kneeling in the debris-strewn street.
“Mr. Parker is calling,” the lightly accented voice replied. Steve wracked his spotty memory for the name.
“Steve, love,’ he made a show of butting into the group standing before his fiancé, “You have to come with me for a moment, there is someone you must meet.”
Tony called back his helmet as he approached the group, noting it was mostly kids now. Despite the ruin around them, they were looking at the three with wide awe-filled eyes yelling questions and jostling each other trying to talk to Cap and Falcon.
Steve nodded before he glanced the teen who was now on the ground laughing as the little furry things climbed all over him.
Steve dozed on the couch, eyes half-lidded as a movie played quietly on the screen. Content he glanced to his dozing boyfriend propped up against the other end of the couch, tablet falling from slack hands, and a small black cat curled in his lap purring for all he was worth.
“There’s a lot of tweets about people offering to be ridden by Steve,” Clint chucked as he scrolled through the feed.
A distant sound made him pause, his hearing was garbage without his hearing aid, but he was sure…it came again. He held his breath, heart pounding hard in his chest, it was almost like a clanging, people yelling?
Steve tried to focus on his breathing getting his racing heart under control as Tony swiftly moved them.
“It’s been 70 years Buck,” he chastised, Anthony laughed at that, an absent giggle that did wonderful things to his sore chest.
A few of them looked put out, a few glared, whatever he didn’t care. Looping his arm with Steve’s they made their way across the room, “Thanks,” Steve rasped.
Adding crackers, and ginger ale to the tray he picked it up heading for the bedroom. He was worried about his boyfriend, Bruce had assured him it was just nasty flu, but his heart broke for him. He didn't get sick, or at least he couldn't remember the last time he’d been sick.
“Incoming,” Natasha jumped in and the teasing was pushed aside as they focused on the fight. At least Tony tried his best to focus, but he was damn glad the suit all but operated itself. He just hung grimly on as he fought back another wave of nausea.
Steve felt his head bobbing again, Tony smiled leaning up to kiss him on the cheek before he was moving back out of the bathroom.
Steve wanted to snort, Anthony had been sick, and if people wanted to call him on that they were assholes….he felt aa cold rage start to simmer if they thought for one minute…
Sighing he shook his head setting down his glass and stuffing his hands in his pocket before moving to join his fiancée who was currently besieged by a group of interesting-looking individuals.
“No, it’s a precaution Anthony, you’ve worked hard for everything you have. I will gladly sign a prenup if it meant you’re protected.”
Sam chuckled, leaning back in his chair looking thoroughly impressed, “All this to get everyone together for Tony’s party?”
Grunting he gave them a nod turning to go when a tentative voice stopped him, “Ummm…Sir, Sargent Rogers,” he paused glancing over his shoulder at the who’d women. His identity wasn’t a secret, his trial following the Accords as well as his very public relationship with Anthony Stark had seen to that.
Steve cracked a grin to himself, as he glanced around the wide-open field he’d fallen into. They were in farm country, the rolling green hills seemed to stretch for miles.
“Well Doctor Strange took us here, and we’ve been looking for you for a while and we saw aliens, and there was this weird guy and-”
“Damit!” Sam cursed as they did their best to work them back, but it was soon apparent that they were heavily outnumbered. Bucky grit his teeth, he wasn’t going down without a fight. Charging headlong into the group to draw their fire, he threw his shield again and again.
Tony hummed and Steve felt warm hands pulling his pants away, leaving him naked and exposed. Instinctively he tried to curl in on himself, hide his skinny form. He felt warm kisses press to his knees and he peeked around his fingers, Tony smiling at him softly, eyes warm and full. Steve relaxed a little letting his legs fall apart as Tony settled between them, kissing up his inner thigh.
Within the hour, the last of them had been neutralized, and was Steve shouldering his rifle before he made his way over to the others.
He stood then, feet on autopilot as he left the others still reading off Tweets as he retreated to his workshop. Dejectedly he sat at the work table running a hand through dark hair, this shouldn’t be bothering him, he was grown man he was secure in who he was…he knew Steve loved him.
Steve could see he was getting upset, gently he reached out his right hand burring his fingers in dark hair as he gently massaged.
Steve watched him carefully, those clever eyes had taken on a far off look, and he suddenly understood. This wasn’t about him, not really.
His phone vibrated on the table he looked down recognizing Pep’s number. Curious he answered glancing at his date, “Heya Pep.”
He caught Anthony to his chest as the man collapsed forward with a small moan of contentment, nuzzling into his neck with a sigh, “Great start to Christmas…” he mumbled.
Tony nodded drifting lightly before he woke with a start, “NO!” he bellowed scrambling upright and grabbing at Steve mindlessly, “No don’t leave me again.”
"Where are you going?" Buck asked frowning, on the couch, Peter looked up, quickly gaining his feet Steve stayed him with a gentle wave.
Tony was still mad he’d missed it, but this, this helped. Chuckling he opened his own Twitter, he didn’t often use his personal Twitter he had people that looked after the company social media and a lot of what he did was proprietary or Avengers work. He was also, as much as he hated to admit it, not all the into social media…and that was dating himself a bit.
Nodding he yawned and stretched sliding out of the car with a brief thank you to the driver. Shivering against the cold he paused a moment glancing upwards; it was snowing. Smiling softly he shook his head following Pepper inside.
Ducking his head Steve easily captured his lips, kissing Anthony sweetly. It was soft and chaste to start but soon turned heated and messy. Anthony wrapping his arms around his neck, Steve easily taking his weight. Lips and tongues duelling, Steve smoothed his hands down the slender man's sides, moving to his hips he easily lifted the smaller man feeling Anthony wrap his legs around his waist.
Turning his attention back to Steve he pressed a kiss to his forehead, keeping his voice as even and composed as he could, “You’re ok love, you’re ok, you’re safe, safe and sound.”
Steve was silent a moment as he thought, expertly clearing out six more of the ugly invading aliens.
“No,” Steve shook his head slowly, “We wanted to invite you to the party at the compound on Friday,” he rasped.
It was bad enough they’d had to deal with this ludicrous mess because some power-hungry scientist had wanted money, and they’d also missed out on all their plans; Steve he was not going to let them tear down the love of his life.
Peter opened his mouth the argue that he was a big boy and he’d be fine, but a loud knock stalled out his words.
Captain America, as well as Clint, Natasha, and Bruce had all apologized, Cap multiple times as he seemed thoroughly chastised. Beside him, Tony grunted still glowering at all of them, clearly not as willing to forgive.
Steve hummed gently holding him close, Tony leaned into him unbidden memories bubbled up from his youth. Somewhat painful awkward memories, he’d been fast-tracked through high school, starting MIT young. He'd missed out on this…all this… he heaved a sigh resting ahead on a wide shoulder.
Tony sighed as he glanced at himself in the mirrors, he wasn’t really in the mood to be shopping right now. Both he and Steve were supposed to be here for their fittings, but his fiancée had been called off with Sam and Bucky to investigate a potential HYDRA resurgence. That had been a week ago, a very lonely, very quiet week. He hadn’t been able to reach him either, they were in a com blackout at the moment, and Rhodes had been pushing him to make some decisions about the wedding.
They hurried in, “I am like dying right now, the Winter Solider showed up at our cabin!” Tony heard Ned hiss at his friend as they hugged.
Steve unpacked his bag, a touch reluctant, before chiding himself for feeling that way. Anthony wanted to do a ‘traditional Christmas’ and he was being selfish. If seemed so important to Anthony, the way he’d lit up talking about their Christmas’s before…before the mess with Hydra and SHIELD, before the Accords.
Tony nodded firing off a reply, of course, he had Laura and the kids, he hadn’t really expected Clint to be free.
Leading him back into the bedroom Tony helped him sit on the side of the bed, stepping between big legs he towelled his longer hair dry. A warm arm encircled his waist drawing him closer.
“We haven’t really got the full story though,” Bruce noted amused, Tony hummed in agreement, that was true he was dying to hear it from Steve and Peter. Glancing around he frowned where had they gone?
He started working harder on the cuffs, worriedly eyeing the door as he struggled to get loose. He had no idea what was coming but…
Rocket shrugged, “What the hell close enough, “ he sited and fired, the others erupting from cover around them.
Bruce returned the smile, “Interesting actually, they’re making some incredible strides in the fields of gamma studies.”
Tony was around the booth, helping him, capable hands handing him the inhaler as he spoke in soft tones. Steve inhaled, chest easing and embarrassment rising, he’d be lucky if Tony didn’t walk out on him.
It wasn't quite sleeping, it was hazy in between where his mind was blessedly blank and the nightmares couldn’t touch him. Vaguely he felt Anthony shift out of his grip, soft lips press to his cheek before his mind drifted out again.
Tony reared back, “Steve love, it was ridiculous, I was at the fitting for the suits and the kid barged in I sto-”
Another finger slide into him stretching him, filling him, the burn was sweet and he ached for more. His arms shook with the effort to keep him up, his knees aching, but the fingers were pulling out of him, "Tony…" he moaned lifting his hips higher.
He was working himself up again, the tears pressing in as his sniffled, then suddenly Steve was kissing him soft and sweet, and so perfectly. Tony couldn’t help the soft stuttering sobs as he leaned into the contact, needing to know this wasn’t a dream, Steve was awake and in his arms…his husband was going to be ok.
Setting down the tray he settled on the edge of the bed carding he right hand through dark hair, “Anthony,” he rasped watching as his face scrunched up and he coughed weakly.
"We can't wait," he said adjusting the shield on his arm and gritting his teeth, beside him, Sam sighed and nodded as he prepared as well.
Steve huffed, “He conferenced in Rhodey as well, the poor guy was in the middle of some secret debrief. Buck is tenacious though.”
The unknown figure hummed holding something up to him, Steve gave up trying to make out what it was.
Opening the text message, he carefully clicked the link it sent him to a website. A website that sold something called, Enso rings. Curious he scrolled through the page a small grin turning up his lips.
He heard the distinct sound of a phone taking a picture and turned back, the women was staring at him pale-faced a hand over her mouth phone held out before her.
But the “Steve conversation” was one that they had all the time. Tony, who in the past had zero issue flirting with girls - some might say even a reputation for being suave - couldn’t seem to get it together to ask out Steve.
Steve stood at the railing at the end of the pier, looking out over the water and into forever just lost in thought, and Tony felt a tug on his heart.
The next object Tony looked at was a napkin - the O’Leary’s Steakhouse logo in forest green where they had eaten the night they got together. It hadn’t been how Tony thought it might happen, but the memory stirred some heat in him just the same.
“JARVIS, raise the alarm. Alert Director Fury about an incoming attack, and that all hands on deck are needed. Red alert. Iron Man and Captain America responding first right now,” Tony shouted as the security siren went off.
Jan offered a compassionate smile and brushed her hand through Tony’s hair sympathetically. “Oh, Tony. I know it has to feel so painful, and if you want me to drop the subject I will, but is not knowing really better than just knowing?”
However, you are all at this school to train to become heroes, protectors, and defenders of the innocent. So
Steve woke up early the next morning, and just held Tony in his arms. He eventually felt Tony stir, and shuffled so the other man could look at his face.
to say ‘hey, can I buy you a coffee?’ because there’s no stakes in it. Either they take me up on it, and we have a couple hour hang out, I get to know them a bit and maybe it leads to something, maybe it doesn’t, or they just say no and I can just let it go, no hard feelings and move onto the next person who might be interested in having a little fun.” Tony looked down and started picking at the grass.
"It's not you," he says. "It's me. I'm flawed. Hell, everyone knows that. I see the forest and not the trees sometimes, but you're the freaking Amazon to me and all I can see is what I wanted the Accords to be." For us.
Steve huffs a laugh and waits a beat before he takes off for the doors.  Tony watches the camera with half an eye as the 3D model of the building and surrounding area tracks Steve's movements (blue for his tracker, always blue) against the bright red glow of the other heat signatures.
Vision begins plating a second platter with fruit.  He swiftly slices pieces of watermelon under Tony’s watchful gaze as he gnaws on the celery stick.  Bruce, Tony can see out of the corner of his eye, is carefully following him.  When the room passes in silence for a minute, Bruce finally says, “Tony what is going on?”
Nothing to hide behind.  Nothing to fear. It’s disconcerting, but he can’t help but feel warm and comfortable.
There is a faint smile on Yinsen’s face as he wipes the cold sweat from Tony’s face with a ragged handkerchief.  “No.  You don’t strike me as the easy type.”
He sips on a flute filled with fake champagne as he looks around the room, the scrawling sketches, painstaking detailed designs that turn into fully fledged 3D models painted until they look like scaled.  It’s a room filled with the statues to the past in the style of today.
“I was wondering if you wanted to come to mine for Christmas,” she queries.  Her tone is light and airy, like they are talking about the weather.
A shot rings out again, and she deflects it downwards.  There is a moment before her eyes widen and she stops the bullet.  It limply drops, only viewable based on the red glow, to the ground a foot away from a mother and child, rushing away from the scene.  The mother doesn’t see it, but the child looking over her shoulder has wide eyes.
Tony rubs a hand behind his head, caught off guard a little bit. He had wanted to be here to see the kid in person, but had expected suspicion instead...this.  "It's Tony," he offers.  "Heard we were training the next generation."
“A little of everything,” Natasha retorts.  “You know how well I don’t like choosing just one thing.”
There are few things Tony remembers about his mother these days, but he remembers how she and Ana used to sit around this table, whiskey glasses in hand and bursting into peals of laughter every while or so. Sometimes Aunt Peg was there, bright lips curled as she mentioned some story about Jarvis or Howard. Mostly Howard when she had that smirk.
Tony lets Steve carve out some time for him to straighten himself up and put the book down to look Tony seriously in the eyes even though he’s carefully avoiding look in his direction and throws, “I’ve learned my lesson Cap. No more robots. You’re free to go.”
It’s easier this way Tony knows.  It doesn’t wipe away the gross cling of the knowledge he is using someone he likes, he respects, like that.
Something tilts and then he’s the younger version of himself, and he’s looking up at her.  There is something singing in the back of his head.
Tony shrugs.  “Don’t put your life on hold because I am still adapting.  I’ve got some gadgets to strip down and rebuild. If I’m going to be of any use here, I need to figure out how technology works.”
Then her grin twists, shooting a look at Clint.  "A lady never bites and tells," she informs them, and Tony starts laughing, while Clint chokes on a chip.  Thor just stares at her, eyes heavy with something he can only see as he studies her.  And Bruce, Bruce just watches them all very carefully.
“I said drop by,” Tony says.  “Not barrel roll into my lab and freak out the guy who has a condition tied to his heart rate or the guy with an actual heart condition.”
Honesty, raw brutal honesty, always makes him want to drink. He goes back and opens the fridge and grabs a beer. It's Clint's brand. Tony only knows because it has a sticky note on it that screams "CLINT'S BEER. DO NOT TOUCH TONY." He's never been good at following directions, especially in the form of sticky notes.
The hologram flickers for a moment as she takes actively control of it, and Tony makes a note to fix that issue. Can't have a new tablet doing something like that before it hits the production cycle. "Got it. Standard notification procedures?" she queries.
The old mansion's dark outside the window as he sits down at that tiny table in a dated, yet tasteful kitchen.  It’s the old house in New York, and he hasn’t been here in a long time.  Hasn’t been able to make it through the gates, even through he still pays for the lawn to be moved, houses to be cleaned, property taken care of.
Tony shrugs and looks down at his hands and sees them shaking.  He crosses them before looking back up at the uneasy group. “We need to suit up.  The shield’s numbers are falling, the strategy is set. We’re all fighting. Any extra protection will bring unnecessary attention to the stone bearers.  Knock down the bad guys and then tackle the giant grape soda.”
"You sure you don't want to come with?" Steve asks, leaning against another treadmill as he has watched FRIDAY and Tony banter back and forth about sass levels and being sent off to be the test project for the incoming interns for the next summer.
Peggy rolls her eyes, “We are professionals at saving the world Tony.  We’ve been going it longer than you have been alive.”
The window is cold, Tony aches inside and out, and all he can see when he closes the eyelid of that grainy footage. But he smiles. "Yeah. Tell me Rhodey."
The projections of Central Park begin to take over the room, the fans kick up, and the group of white robots light up. Names display across their torsos. Bruce starts looking a little green.
No one had needed to know, Tony had told himself.  No one needed to worry.  He just needed to get these regulations downgraded, then bring them up. It was his role in the Avengers to deal with the political and PR BS.  He could do this, take care of this, and move on.
Ana nods sincerely, while Maria drains her glass in the background.  “That is a good reason Tony,” Ana says. “What would save the world from?”
He take in a deep breath and feels it rattle in his chest.  He closes his eyes for a long moment, praying he doesn’t hallucinate again.  Tony can’t play it off well enough in this group of people, not with how he is right now.  Not in the middle of the plane.
Tony gets off the bed, tugs the IV out, and puts his hands on the windows.  He doesn’t know this place. This location. He looks out into the brightly lit night.  There are brightly colored holograms, showing two women talking before leaning in close and shifting into text
He rolls his shoulders and nanobots replicate more missiles and give him an increased shoulder area to launch them at Thanos before shrinking down again.  Then he hurtles down to Thanos, hoping to grab him unaware.
The murmurs grow louder at that, and Tony can see more than a few smirks in the crowd. Ulrich has a wince across his face, so Tony's on the mark there. "So really, Ben Ulrich of the Daily Bugle, what are you dying to ask me?"
Red Wing slides in and tazes a group of five who slump down.  This gives Captain America just enough space to step back and duck the next punch at his head.  Falcon drops into a nearby group with a flying kick.  They go at it for a while, and Tony is clutching the ARC reactor enough that it is biting into his hand.
“Then maybe you shouldn’t die and leave me trying to solve the problem of all the things we never talked about and a company I wasn’t ready to take over before I knew who I am or want to be,” Tony yells.
“Yeah,” Howard stands and goes for the scotch.  He turns back and inclines his head, but Tony shakes his no.  “Why?”
"You said this was one of the only places where you could be Steve," Tony finishes, palms flat on the table. "Is that still true?"
Tony slumps into the nearest chair as soon as the Ambassador hangs up.  His face is in his hands, and there is a throbbing behind his templates that aches between heart beats.  Tony can feel the rushing of blood in his ears.  He takes a moment, two, three, four, before he straightens.
Over T’Challa’s shoulder, he sees the Secret Avengers stepping out to the balcony, various degrees of wariness on their faces.  The king catches his gaze and turns, sliding one hand around Tony’s shoulders.  “It seems we have  a guest visiting us,” he greets the others.
“I didn’t raise you to believe in the inevitable or destiny,” Maria shouts.  “I raised you to make the most of a situation and then solve the problem.
Steve can see the moment Tony looks past Natasha’s shoulder and makes him out.  He doesn’t look surprised.  He just looks tired.  Like some lines have been chiseled into his face.  Steve yeans for his sketchbook to capture this moment.  Tries to memorize the way Tony looks at him, everything that is different and the same.  This is a moment he doesn’t want forget.
Tony launches himself into the air, checks the campaign below him, and sees that the others have it underhand.  They actually may be winning based on the quick number Friday pulls up.
Tony goes. "Won't be as good as if we went to visit Julian and got some chiliaquiles. Breakfast nachos. Think of that deliciousness Rhodey!"
Steve gets lost in people.  In memories. Tony knows. Tony’s used it for than he wants to admit to skirt around some of the things he doesn’t talk about.  Doesn’t want to bring up. He slides in a comment about Wanda, about Bruce, Thor, Natasha and Steve will pick up the thread, follow it down until something is finished.
It just takes one story before Tony feels settled again, discussing the next steps and joking with Steve like he's right there.
It’s the same slopes he remembers.  The same ones he studies after the moments when he nearly reaches for a drink when he watches as Steve goes down - blood flowing freely between his hands.  The same hands who pulled the shield down on him armor, and Tony thought
“You mean, am I mainlining main meds or morphine to deal with the phantom limb issues I’ve got going?  Or does the fancy new fake arm hurt any more than I am used to?” Tony asks, and Steve knows this tone, the middle ground between serious and a joke, and Tony’s hoping you take the easier route so he doesn’t have to have this conversation.  But he wants you to ask.  Really ask, because it’s time for that conversation and he knows.
A proximity alarm tells him about the hand Steve puts on his arm. He has the face plate pull back as he faces him. "Yes Cap?"
It eases from the early Avengers in their costumes to a model of them all sitting the manor, laughing and throwing popcorn at each other.  Clint has a bandage over his nose, like he always did, Jan’s young and face soft as she leans in on Hank - both still have their rings. “It’s great Tony,” Steve says finally.
Because he needs to be alone with this, wants to be alone with this. Doesn’t need Steve for this. Doesn’t
“Yes,” Tony replies.  “But I can still feel it you know.  Even after everything, I can feel it.  Like it’s still there.”
There is a noise in the distance.  “Friday,” he queries. “What is that?”  And the screen in front of him tries to triangulate in the lower right hand corner as he takes down another speeder with a repulsor blast, and then has to duck at another whale goes crashing down almost on him.
He steps back, hand falling to his side as he realizes the entire thing is fake.  A replica. Non functional.
It was crushing, but something he has suspected in the moments leading up to watching the way Steve’s face had hardened.
He had tinkered with it - once.  Pulled down the equations and the schematics that had been hidden in dust.  A single blood sample that was suspiciously never labeled but under various locks and key.  The DNA patterns didn’t match him or his family, but it had matched Michael’s in varied ways.
Eventually, Steve runs out of words.  So, he looks down at his hands, unable to continue further.  “So you get it," Tony states after the silence rings a little too loudly between them.  “You have to push away the fear and wrap it in humor because if you don't you'll be swallowed by it.”
“Oh, don’t give me that look. And I brought over pizza. I’m helping.” Tony kneeled down and opened a box of pizza, showing it off to the tsums. “Here, babies. Come here! It’s pizza time.”
“Oh, okay - you know,” Tony said with a pause to think. “I might just have a place. Are you . . . looking to go alone?”
Steve held Tony up as he stood up in one fluid motion, carrying Tony to the bedroom. Steve let go of Tony over the bed, Tony landing with a bounce and Steve crawling on top of him. Steve continued to kiss Tony’s neck as it was Tony’s turn to caress Steve’s body, running his hands wherever he could across Steve’s chest and back.
The doors opened and they stumbled their way out of the elevator, kissing and making their way toward the bedroom. Along the way they had lost their coats and shoes, and Steve picked up Tony and gently bounced him onto the bed, the moment where Steve climbed between Tony’s open legs the first real moment they had separated since they began kissing.
Steve walked Tony to one of the smaller conference rooms, one that had the curtains closed so no one could see inside. Steve opened the door and gestured for Tony to enter. When Tony did, he saw an elaborate meal on full display. A table setting for two lay on the conference table, with a beautiful spread of food next to it. The harsh fluorescent lighting was replaced with many candles across the room. Soft music played in the background.
A few months later, after a couple of small missions here and there, Tony thought about how he hadn’t seen the team in a while. The holiday season had already started, and maybe it was the hustle of the season, to prepare for gatherings and festivities with friends and family, that just made Tony miss the new teammates he had gained over the past year. A couple of weeks before Christmas, he decided to invite the team for an early holiday celebration.
While Steve would gladly take the couch - it was Tony’s cabin after all - Steve knew better than to try to argue with Tony by offering to sleep on the couch himself. If he tried to go to sleep on the couch he’d wake up later being carted off to the bed by some kind of robot, or Tony in the Iron Man armor himself, and while the latter had admittedly been a passing fantasy of his, Steve wasn’t about to start their week together with an argument about a bed, and certainly not one as large as the one inside this bedroom.
Steve by not telling him how you feel and giving him the chance to respond. I know it has to be scary to worry about affecting your friendship, and the team, but if you’re just killing any chance you could have together before it starts, aren’t you basically in the same place you’d be in if you ask him out and it ends badly? You’re still miserable, and not seeing anybody. When’s the last time you asked someone out?”
Loki looked back Tony. “Well didn’t you once say you were ‘everybody’s perfect match?” he asked in jest, but Tony didn’t respond besides a pout and looking down at the ground. “What? No jokes? No boasting about how you’d be the perfect boyfriend or a great night out? Ooh. You really are lovesick. Ew.”
“Now what are we going to do with you?” Tony said, looking at the ornament with a Black Widow logo on it. “I think you’d be great here,” Tony said as he placed the ornament on an open branch near the window. He then looked at an ornament designed like Steve’s shield, and smiled and put it toward the top of the tree.
Tony continued to put more memories into the scrapbook - lots of pictures of their time together, trips they took, special dates. But there was one more date that Tony wanted to recognize. He sifted through the contents of the hat box until he found it - a program for the Stark Industries Gala, the first one after they had begun dating.
He strolled over to the obstacle course, where Steve could sometimes be found helping other students with their conditioning training. It was clear today’s session was almost over, given that Sam and Bucky were horsing around to the side as Steve was on the monkey bars, swinging back and forth playfully between the bars.
“You sure you don’t mind spending your birthday doing photo ops and media appearances?” Tony asked, looking through Steve’s schedule with concern. “It is your birthday after all.”
Tony missed when he first met Steve, when it was easy to deflect his feelings by teasing him. But now? His crush had gotten so bad of late, that when they didn’t have a topic to talk about, like in their study group, Tony got flustered.
“Steve, I’ve gotta say I’ve dreamt of this for a long time. After all we’ve already been through? We honestly have to make up for lost time. Don’t worry, Steve. I’m not going anywhere.”
Tony picked up the fork and dipped it into the dish. The first bite of the risotto was heavenly - creamy, and the rice perfectly done. He turned to compliment Steve, who had actually covered his eyes so he couldn’t see Tony’s reaction.
He felt the wind on his fur, heard the crunch of sticks and leaves as he sprinted across the woods, running over rocks and around the trees, jumping over small streams. Just running, running, running.
“Oh, they already know, they’re just arguing in the waiting area right now about who can see you first. I’ll send someone in on my way out,” the doctor replied.
Tony watched Steve walk out quietly and as soon as he was out of earshot, Tony said, “JARVIS, contact Nick Fury. Tell him world isn’t ending, just have a favor I wanna ask of him.”
He felt himself begin to swell, his perspective shifted, first growing higher, the rip of his clothing sounding out as he began to growl - not scream,
“Well, you dropped immediately, Loki got pissed and charged at Scott saying he killed you, and Steve came back for another lap -”
Tony hadn’t mentioned a single word about the night before, so Steve took it as a sign not to bring it up. But Steve was a man who was good at many things, and worrying about Tony Stark was one of the things he did best. So as they drove back to the cabin, Steve continued to weight the pros and cons of bringing the nightmare up. It couldn’t hurt to at least let Tony know he was there to listen, right?
Tony looked at the several course meal in front of them. “You should feel accomplished, look at this spread.”
The evening of the gala, Tony still had a knot in his stomach. Happy pulled the car up to the front of the museum, transformed with a large red carpet. Tony took a breath, and looked at Steve, who provided a reassuring smile. They stepped out of the car to a wave of camera flashes.
didn’t know how to deal with my feelings. I’m so sorry, Tony - if I had known you thought that I would have just come clean ages ago.” Steve took Tony’s hand and gave it a loving squeeze, sitting in silent contemplation for a moment.
They drove to a small nearby town that had a prominent Main Street - and as Steve parked the car, he couldn’t help but feel like he had walked into a picturesque movie. Small stores lined the street, with locals strolling down the sidewalks, walking dogs and pushing strollers.
Steve sighed. “Yes, it’s a Chuck E. Cheese’s but there’s something here we’ve been asked to investigate inside it.”
“Security system? But he’s got me, what more of a security system does he need?” Tony asked with a wink.
. Not team captain, not super hero, no carrying the weight of the world on his shoulders - just Steve.
Despite that, it was still fun to see Steve get this excited over something. But after a long afternoon in front of the TV, Tony needed some mental stimulation, and he stood up and left for the workshop.
“Your helmet hair. Cowl hair, I guess? Anyway, it’s cute, a ruffled bedhead kind of look. It’s good on you,” Tony responded with a small smirk at seeing a light blush appear across Steve’s cheeks as his hand lifted to his messy hair.
“You know, you look really great tonight, Tony. Where do you get your suits from?” Steve asked, as they began to walk around the market.
Between Steve’s look, his bright smile, the way the workout had made his hair messy, how cuddly he looked in the sweatpants and how nice it was when Steve’s shirt rode up, Tony was totally thrown. Completely flustered, the confident Tony that had just strolled right to the obstacle course immediately vanished. Tony was frozen like a deer in headlights, and panicked.
Tony took the supplies to his bedroom, spread them all out on the floor and jumped up to grab a box from his closet. A old hat box, handled with care, Tony carried it over to his pile of supplies and opened the lid.
Tony couldn’t find the words to articulate how much Steve meant to him, but Tony knew that there were other ways to say ‘I love you’. Steve had already found one.
Steve sighed and looked down at the floor around him as the tsums continued to munch away. Sure, they were still going to have to sort out who these little guys were, but even Steve had to admit they were pretty cute.
Steve’s wolf ears picked up a familiar whoosh approaching from behind him. He turned around to see the Iron Man suit flying toward him, slowing down and landing a little distance away. The helmet flipped off and Tony stared at him in concern.
Tony was still quiet. Steve knew this wasn’t the concussion - he had seen Tony talking normally with Jan and Rhodey just the other day - so it was clear something was off.
The first few passes went alright. Teddy noticed an open maintenance shed toward the back of the campus, although when they investigated there didn’t seem to be anything out of order. For the next sweep, they agreed it was best for the purpose of a learning exercise to have Steve and Tony go with one of the younger students each. As Tony passed the maintenance shed with Teddy again, it was locked as they had left it. They returned to the front of campus, grabbing the snacks as they waited for the others to return.
When the new school year had started, and Tony helped Steve with his campaign for student body president, they had spent a lot of time together. It further solidified Steve’s feelings for Tony, but it wasn’t until the end of the fall term that he finally brought up his crush with Sam and Bucky.
“I’d like that,” Tony replied, sitting up in bed. His usually neat hair all tousled and sticking up from being pressed into the bed. Steve chuckled.
“Well no, I think you already dropped by the time he reentered the quad, but he first went to break up the fight between Loki and Scott before he noticed me hovering over you.”
Tony turned over his shoulder and smiled. “Oh hi, Cap. Of course you can help! The more the merrier. Figured this would be easier to do without the usual whirlwind of the team around, but I could always use a hand.”
He reached a clearing with a small lake, just like he had seen in his dream. The bright full moon reflected off the lake. Steve trotted over, without hesitation. He knew, and he wanted to see it for himself.
want to come with me, I'd love to have you. Uh, come with me. Come along with me.” Steve blushed some more as Tony smirked, a naughty thought clearly passing through his head as Steve realized how vaguely suggestive that just sounded.
When it finally seemed like the pieces of wreckage had settled, Steve pushed his shield up, forcing a heavy piece of the tank aside as he sat up, slightly dizzy. He looked over and saw Tony standing in the rubble with him.
“What happened?” Steve sat up in confusion, for a moment unable to figure out where he was. He looked around to see the outside of the compound, still nighttime, and he was laying in the grass. Tony stood above him, crouching down to inspect Steve’s condition. Steve looked down to see small cuts and scratches over different parts of his body, and realized he was actually naked.
“Fantastic,” Steve said, catching his shield as it bounced off the fifth agent’s chest and spinning to kick a sixth agent in the gut.
When they arrived back at the cabin, Steve stopped the car in the driveway and reached over to stop Tony’s hand from unfastening the seat belt.
Once they were settled in, Steve and Tony spent the rest of the day together on the couch, curled up in front of the fire as soft jazz played from the stereo. They both had their feet up on the large ottoman. Steve threw a blanket that had been on the back of the couch over both his and Tony’s legs.
“Yeah! I was going to ask if you wanted to hang out, and then I got knocked out. And you carried me like the hero you are, and I wanted to die afterward.”
“Because I knew you were anxious about it. How we’d be received. How I’d handle it. You care, and you protect people as much as you can. It’s one of the things I love about you.”
Tony looked at the beautiful color filling Steve’s cheeks as he took one hand to cup Steve’s face. Steve looked into Tony’s eyes and was absorbed by how they sparkled in the moonlight.
“And finally, the installation of the new security system has been finished around campus. Many outside forces have begun to recognize the strength, power, and capabilities you all possess. It’s good to put people on notice, but that can also attract . . . challenges. Our new campus security system will provide more peace of mind as you all train and build skills. Some of the features include anti-stealth technology, reinforced walls around the campus, and motion sensors. As you know, while there is no formal curfew at the Academy, I hope these new security features may inspire some of you to use more, uh,
Tony laughed, and took Steve’s hand. “Okay, but Steve, don’t you see? I have feelings for you, you have feelings for me. None of that past awkwardness matters now.”
Steve hadn’t felt this relaxed in his entire life. He hadn’t realized how heavy the weight of being Captain America had been on his spirit until he didn’t have to be that. The team was fine - they checked in twice a day - and for a week Steve could just be
“Steve carried you. Picked you up bridal style and ran you over to the medical wing. Said it would be a hell of a lot faster than had we waited for assistance to arrive, which is true. I ran after him, but you know there’s no way I could keep up. I think you were only out for a little over a minute. You were still pretty woozy but were already awake by the time I arrived.”
Not in his usual outfit, Steve’s workout clothes consisted of a long-sleeved academy t-shirt and gray sweatpants. Tony, already mesmerized at the sight before him, watched as Steve’s shirt rode up slightly as he hung from the bars, revealing a nice bit of skin. Tony began to feel warm and fluttery as he stared at Steve - staring was the right word, at this point - until Steve turned around and caught Tony looking.
“Seriously, Steve. You’re making this too complicated. Just ask if you can buy him a drink and chat him up,” Sam said.
Tony quickly flew them both across campus to the medical wing, Steve hugging Tony tightly during the short trip. The trip to the medical wing was quick; only some minor bruises and cuts between the two, and a small burn on Steve’s leg that would heal quickly.
After they returned to the cabin Steve took a relaxing long shower, some of which was spent trying to ignore how wonderful Tony looked in his ski suit.
Jan shrugged. “Not here, but I think he might have gone back to the quad to chew out Scott. Widow texted me to ask what could have possibly happened to make
“Thank you so much, Tony, I love it! It’s so sweet and lovely, and . . . has some blank pages?” Steve looked a bit confused as he began to turn through the second half of the book, which was all blank.
“Oh god - Tony, no - I never wanted you to think anything like that. If anything, maybe I just put myself at a distance because
“Woof? Woof. Of course you’d say woof. Why wouldn’t you say ‘woof’? . . . Do wolves say ‘woof’?” Tony began to ramble, clearly nervous.
A couple of weeks later, Tony had made all of the arrangements. They set out by car, driving upstate.
Confused, Tony followed Steve inside the Chuck E. Cheese. There was something off about the beeps and music from the arcade machines, the lights all on, the restaurant area still covered in trays of pizza and cups of soda like someone was just about to come back - but no one there.
As they began to walk down the red carpet, Steve made the first move, linking his arm through Tony’s as a swell of murmurs flowed over the crowd. They paused to pose for more pictures, and Tony grew more confident as his slid his arm around Steve’s waist and then they continued their way into the museum.
But Steve woke up the next morning with Tony in his arms, the other man having made his way across the bed during the night.
They both washed up and changed into pajamas. Tony got into bed first, claiming the side of the bed furthest from the door. Steve climbed into bed soon after, getting comfortable under the warm blanket. He was right about the bed - at the moment there was a comfortable foot and a half between them with more room to spare.
Tony began to move in, and Steve slightly tilted his head, as they both moved together, lips almost touching and -
. An arrow zoomed over Steve’s head and into the chest of the AIM agent directly in front of him. The next second, a large slab of rock was hurled from behind him and crushed a few of the agents to his left. Taking the agent’s moment of hesitation, Steve raised his shield and tossed it.
Tony guided Steve outside to a large shed in the back, where he pulled out a large tire and rolled it to the edge of the hill that led down to the lake below.
Before he knew it, Tony had spent the rest of the day on the couch with the others, getting just as hyped up about frying techniques as Steve was.
Tony began to zoom back to the fight, where he could now see the figures of Hawkeye and Hulkling assisting from a distance as she continued to raise her bow and fire and he made quick use of the new piles of rubble. Tony turned and could see lights going on around campus. People were waking up, and they would have assistance soon, but not just yet. He flew in closer. “Cap, Hawkeye, Hulkling, keep those agents busy, I’ll work on a way to stop this tank.”
And then having the team torn apart again, scattered across time and space, only to then be tossed into the chaos of Battleworld.
“What you asked me, earlier? Tony, I was so scared and so lost when I thought we were never going to see you again. And that I was never going to get to tell you how I truly feel. And the team went through so much and I’m still scared that I could lose any of you, and especially you, Tony. I don’t need anything for Christmas. I already have you back. I don’t need anything else.”
Steve loved how easy it was to talk to Tony. Despite how different they were, there was always something Steve could learn from Tony, and he loved how Tony lit up when he spoke about something that mattered to him. Steve laughed to himself, thinking about how unfortunate it was his eyes needed to stay on the road and not on Tony.
Tony looked at the gala program again, and then finished fastening it into the scrapbook. He added some more pictures, put in some more captions and stickers, and finally satisfied, looked at his project.
“Okay change of plans. I can distract the tank, but I’m not sure how close I can get. How you doing down there?” Tony asked.
And a few hours later, Tony heard a knock at the door. He looked up to see Jan, relief to finally see a friendly face.
Pepper laughed. “Well, as many times as you and your teammates have ‘protected’ the school by reducing parts of it to rubble, Director Fury wanted to add additional defenses. New technology, reinforced walls. That kind of stuff.”
Tony heard it all - “don’t be scared!”, “he’s nice!”, “he’s sweet!” - but that didn’t change how strongly Tony felt about Steve, and how scared it made him to feel that way.
The creature fit right into the palm of his hand, and while Tony was still a bit nervous the creature seemed perfectly content.
“Already ahead of you. Ordered both during the last commercial break. Damn this addictive network,” Tony said, scrolling through a website and picking out new bakeware for the communal kitchen. He turned to look at Steve.
The house itself was open plan, with the majority of the space dedicated to the kitchen and living room. In the living room, a big flat-screen television was next to a large fireplace surrounded by comfy couches. There was a beautiful wood dining table to the side. The kitchen had even fancier appliances than the one back at the tower and included a wine fridge, marble countertops on top of forest green cabinets. Other open live edge wood shelves lined the wall of the kitchen.
The quad was decently filled; a few students here and there looking over textbooks in groups. Two students were practicing fight training as another girl looked over flash cards. A boy nearby had sparkles coming out of his hands, which Tony assumed to be a spell of some sort. A couple cuddled under a large tree, and a few students were laying in the grass like Tony and Jan were, just appreciating the nice day.
“Oh! Yeah. It’s on the roof right now. Wanted to see how exposure to the elements would treat it. We could go check on it if you want?”
After Tony’s concussion, he was forced to take it slow for a few weeks. He missed a week of classes, was only allowed limited use of technology - as little screen time as possible - and couldn’t be very active. So Tony wasn’t out on missions, couldn’t be in his lab, couldn’t fly around in his armor - and was limited in how much classwork he could do.
Steve plopped down on the couch, amazed at his own boldness, still in disbelief. Did he hear that right? Tony felt the same about him? The Tony Stark, the genius, one of the most caring men Steve ever knew, actually had feelings for him too?
It started with a chase through the forest. Steve was on the tail of members of a HYDRA cell, his teammates also in pursuit and scattered around the forest. He could hear the crashing sound of the Hulk smashing trees, the speeding sounds of motorcycles as Nat and Clint followed behind him, and the whooshing sounds of Tony and Thor just overhead.
“Why can’t you just tell him how you feel? I honestly don’t get it, Tony. You’re making yourself miserable over wanting to be with him so badly - just ask him! You used to ask out girls all the time, no problem. Steve is one of if not the nicest person on this campus. He doesn’t bite! Just ask him out for a drink or something.
“And you’ve got the super soldier grace keeping your ass off the ice right now,” Tony replied, and just as the words left his mouth, he lost his balance, shuffled his feet quickly, and in doing so made Steve fall down too. They both plopped down on the ice, and looked at each other in silence until they burst out laughing.
Tony laughed as he could feel his heart do a little flip. He already had feelings for Steve, but now he could feel himself plunging deeper, falling for Steve more and more with each passing second. “Steve, I’m sure I’ll love it.”
Steve was currently covering his head with his shield as bits of rock and concrete pinged off the shield. He could hear the roar of the beam continuing to cut through the exterior walls of the campus.
“No. God I wish it was that simple,” Tony responded, propping himself back on his elbows. By this time, Steve had made another lap back to the quad. Tony watched Steve run off, and Loki and Jan watched Tony. Loki looked up to see who Tony had been staring at.
He turned around and saw a beautiful strawberry ricotta cheesecake on a pedestal and realized it looked familiar.
Before Steve could even speak up, Tony pulled a nurse aside and said, “Hey I think I found him sleepwalking outside but he seems to have gotten a bit scratched up. Can you get someone to clean him up?”
Steve takes a breath before adding, "I love how you love so fiercely. Once I was worried you would burn yourself out loving others, but now, I think you could survive taking a hit."
, he thinks firmly.  He’s been here for three years, and he can’t still call it the future.  It makes the therapists take too many notes.
She whacks him in the arm, but it’s Daniel who crosses the room and grabs onto Tony.  His grip almost too firm, but enough to root him in the now and not the sudden pain swimming in his system.  “You know me. You know who I am.” He meets Tony’s eyes, trying to say things he can’t get out. “I always take care of you,” he says, softly.
(Parker is there and Steve sees the full body freeze Tony has when he sees the kid before he shakes it off.
Vision, from behind him, with Wanda walking close at his side, hands almost touching, narrates, “Peter has taken the lead with point 1056.  Captain Rhodes now takes second place.” Rhodey waves it off, halved over from laughing too hard. “I maintain third place, with Dr Banner in last.
Tony flicks open a new screen, rough prelim schematics he originally had for the next armor version after he had finished some test runs on the 46th.  “Only if the anomalies are outside the 28% range in a majority of cases.”
Natasha catches it and is about to call him on it when Tony yells, "Let's get this show on the road Cap!"
It’s like someone else has stepped underneath his skin and joined him there.  But that is what the stone is, he guesses. It’s familiar in a strange way, Tony notes, and maybe he’s always felt like this and he’s only known it now.
“Or make them the X-men’s problem, but then again Xavier would have to be willing to fit the bill when his kids destroy something.  I’d rather it be you, you are better about causing as little property damage as you can.”
She mouths something, he can’t hear it before the face shrinks until FRIDAY is standing there, a person.  The words “Stark Expo 2305 coming soon” appear beside her. Tony stills, thoughts completely missing in action as he stares out at the window.  FRIDAY cocks her hip and leans against the words and winks at him.
Steve scoffs and rolls his eyes, like he is saying, you already buy everything around here, but whatever.  Tony doesn’t call him on it, just grins back.
Steve’s sharp intake of breath tells Tony he heard something of that, maybe felt it more.  The connection’s shape still changes from time to time.  He still gets it, and leans close.
The window is cold, and it helps with the headache he has pounding between his ears. It sounds like a heartbeat. "Apparently Dad pissed off Hydra, and they sent the Winter Soldier after him."
“Yes,” a higher pitched voice says from the foot of his bed. “But thankfully, I like getting to fix broken little white boys.”
Tony takes a breath, lungs expanding until it hurts, holds it in for a moment longer than he should before letting it out in a rush. “You don’t need to babysit me.”
Tony ends a call as Steve strolls in, still sweaty and a towel being rubbed against his head.  He looks at Tony fondly.  "You've been talking to Pepper more," he offers because Steve always notices.
He sighs. "No. You're a reminder of the good times. The Avengers. The dreams we shared, the idea that we could save the planet instead of tearing it apart. The chance that we could right our wrongs."
Howard’s eyes narrow before he nods to the glowing arc reactor he has pinned to his shirt.  The suit is hidden, ready to jump into action if he needs it, but not now. “Palladium is a bad way to die, especially in the chest.”
Tony runs his fingers around the edge of the white surface and watches as it reorients to face him.  He presses the temperature icon that brightens before going holographic presenting a week long forecast, hour by hour options available and the condos’ internal temperature schedule corresponding for each day pop up to the right.
His mother stands and whispers something in Dad’s ear.  Dad’s frown deepens.  “Okay, okay you harpy,” Dad bites out as he stands.  “I’ll do it.”
Steve stills, thinking about the canvases he has littering Tony's lab. "I'll have the lab cleared out this afternoon."
There is something dawning in Steve’s face.  A light in his eyes that Tony used to know as his expression twists.  “I worked it out with the attorney of the Avengers. There was a clause and a fund we put together years ago, in case of sudden return to existence.  I’m using some of it to get a place, get myself set up.”
Natasha grins, “In the war criminal law, there is a line in the one hundred and eighty page document that would allow war criminals to be microchipped. It would be put in the brain to make sure no one would remove it. The technology used would be from Pym Technologies, which was made back after Janet Van Dyne went missing. Pym had a lot of ethically questionable inventions from that time frame.” Scott starts forward and reaches for a phone. “Oscorp bought the technology, and Norman Osbourn isn’t well known for his ethics and morals.”
Tony stands from where he has been leaning over the table.  The lab is clean of clutter, orderly.  Bruce’s machines have migrated into his lab.  Tony still isn’t sure when that happened in the past couple of days.  Just that suddenly Bruce was in the lab with him all the time.
He turns back to the facility.  “We can train the younger ones to take our places here.  I know you have been tracking those kids around town.  We can become more co-hensive and be less afraid of learning our limits and hurting someone out here.”
“We good Fry?” He asks before she affirms, and Tony watches the countdown go to 20 feet, 15, 10, 5, and throws his arms out repulsors crackling as he braces for impact.
Tony imagines the long walk to his room, and the open doors, the glimpse at the dust collecting, the windows open. All those things he needs to clean up, package away. "I have everything I need at the Tower."
The Skrull’s smirk grows bigger.  “Don’t you know? We’ve already taken New York.  The rest of the planet will follow.” It squeezes harder, and Tony chokes for a moment.  “But you won’t be here to see it.”
“It’s just a date, Tony. It’s not like you’re asking Steve to marry you,” Rhodey added, reaching over to grab a handful of popcorn and throwing one piece at Tony.
They waited for awhile on a sofa outside of Fury’s office, Tony’s head on Steve’s shoulder as Steve kept his arm wrapped around Tony. They sat quietly, both facing forward. His eyes flickered around the room - filing cabinets, desks, a water cooler - and fell on a bulletin board for school events. The pink and yellow Spring Formal poster popped out against the other flyers.
“Sure, why don’t we try with those scarves over there?” Bruce pointed and just like that, Steve and Tony were left alone.
“Of course I am, with a big strong hero to catch me,” Tony responded with a large grin, still on top of Steve. They both laughed, then paused as they stared at each other, Tony only a few inches above Steve’s face. Steve could feel his stomach do a million little flips as he could sense Tony’s thoughts racing a mile a minute.
“Well, I’m sure me and my teammates will find a way to make some more rubble despite Fury’s additions. Speaking of my teammates, have you seen Steve? I wanted to talk to him.”
“You scared us out there, man,” Sam said, sitting down by Steve’s bedside. They chatted for awhile, Sam clearly trying to distract Steve from what had happened. Steve felt better after talking to his friends already, even though he was still in a tremendous amount of pain.
“STEVE!” Tony screamed in horror. He hadn’t known what Steve was planning to do, but first, he couldn’t see Steve, he didn’t get a response from Steve, and then there was an explosion. The threat of missiles now gone, Tony plummeted back to the ground and frantically began to search through the rubble.
“I’d love to, Tony,” Steve replied happily. “But I’d like to think I wouldn’t have to wait the next few weeks until the formal for a date with you. Can I take you out to dinner next weekend?”
The third time Tony tried? Well, that had been the worst. Tony had been laying with Jan in the grass on the quad a couple of weeks later, enjoying a quiet and warm early spring day drinking iced coffee and eating some snacks. Tony rolled over onto his stomach and propped himself up onto his elbows to people watch.
Oh god. You’re right. It’s official. Let the registrar know. I’m going to go by ‘the Awkward Nightmare’ from now on.”
Tony put a hand on Steve’s front to calm him. “It’s okay, it’s okay Steve. Relax. It’s okay. We should get out of here. We can walk for a bit back toward the compound if you’d like.”
“Tony, oh god, this whole time I thought you weren’t interested in me! I wanted to ask you for a dance on Valentine’s Day but you seemed so nervous and distracted I backed off.”
“Slowly. With baby steps. You are putting so many stakes on this that it will never happen if we don’t relieve some of that pressure,” Jan said, and when Tony looked at her he could tell the gears of her brain were fully in motion.
On their third day, the weather wasn’t too great, with a small snowstorm blowing in. Steve and Tony had grabbed breakfast at a local diner, but otherwise spent the day in the cabin relaxing, Steve painting a landscape by the window and Tony tinkering on a small robot.
“Can you stand?” Tony asked, and helped Steve up after he nodded in the affirmative. Tony wrapped an arm around Steve’s waist as Steve put his arm over Tony’s should for support. They quietly walked out of sight, turning a corner when Tony stopped, picked up Steve bridal style.
They broke apart to see Director Fury in the doorway. “When you two are ready,” and gestured into his office. He turned and walked inside, mumbling something about “young people.”
Between the amazing food and how sweet and endearing his new partner was, Tony knew in that moment that he was in love.
“The night you got attacked, you absolutely scared the shit out of me. I genuinely thought you were dying, and I was terrified that we were going to lose you. And I spent days trying to wrap my brain around what could have happened to you to cause that much pain. You’ve taken a beating before just fine. But a bite hurting
They made it back to the compound, and Tony stepped out of the Iron Man suit to properly sit down with Steve in the grass. They sat there quietly, Tony providing reassuring pets to Steve’s head as the full moon receded back past the treeline. With a bark, Steve began to shift back, first standing on his hind legs, full werewolf form, and then back to human.
Steve shrugged. “Eh. There are worst ways to spend your 94th birthday. Not really like I was gonna have plans anyway. . .” Steve said, trailing off quietly. He stared down at the floor, away from Tony’s gaze. “Guess I better go get ready.”
“Uh, thanks,” Steve said. Over the past several months, Steve couldn’t help but notice Tony’s flirtatious comments. And because he had liked Tony so much, Steve never knew how to handle it. Tony also had a reputation of flirting with most people, even if he didn’t intend to do so. But just a small smile from Tony would make Steve’s stomach do flips, so how could he properly judge what was casual flirting and what was something more?
Tony had run to the kitchen to grab some snacks to return to his workshop, so he hadn’t been paying attention to what Steve was watching on TV when he first walked into the common area. Curious to see what got Steve worked up in a kind of fury usually reserved for a losing sports team, Tony peeked his head into the living room to see what the problem was.
“C’mon. We’re going. Get dressed.” Sam dragged Steve out of the dorm and to the club, where a sizeable crowd was dancing, drinking, and flirting.
The first item he pulled out were ticket stubs from their outing to Coney Island, a few months after the Battle of New York.
The energy of the city and the moment got to be almost too much as they entered the Tower, making Tony feel like he was going to bubble over and explode like a shaken up soda.
