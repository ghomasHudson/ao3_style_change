The reporters turned to look at him, some of them directing their cameras on him. Steve held up his hands. “I’m sorry to hear that,” he said, honestly. “We have a fund set up to contact for any damages that happ—”
“I suppose so.” Steve reached into his pocket and pulled out a small box. “Here. For you, Tony.”
Clint raised an eyebrow. “Uh…
Tony rolled his eyes. “Cap says thanks for the hand.”
Like always.

Carol’s face appeared at the edge of the screen. “Oh, hey Tone! Why are we seeing you in bed naked?”
“I know what he said.” Sam kept smiling, waving at the cameras. “Just keep walking, Steve. People are gonna say a lot of shit.”
Tony ended up standing next to Steve, a bit to the right but close enough to still be near the microphones. This wasn’t unusual. As co-captains, they tended to take on public appearances together. Steve was always grateful for Tony’s help. The man was charming to a fault—as Steve well knew—making these sessions run much smoother than if Steve had been left to bumble through on his own.
Steve’s eyes hardened. “That’s funny coming from someone who’s trespassing.”
Steve chuckled. “Fair enough.”
If you get down in the dumps about still being single, it’s okay to wallow for a while. But keep in mind that sometimes it’s all about math. The more people you meet and touch, the more likely it is you’ll find the one!
And, even though Johnny rarely brought it up, Peter knew how much it was hurting him to keep his soulmate a secret from his family. Johnny was so close to Sue, Reed, and Ben—even Namor, in an unexplainably odd way. Even
14: Tony did not want his mark to cover half his face.
They approached Steve and Bucky. Tony tried to make it look less like Carol was forcing him. He wasn’t entirely successful. When the two men saw them walking over, Steve’s eyes softened. That was nice. Tony felt sort of squishy inside at that.
Tony shrugged, good-natured but resigned. “Look, if you get a red, white, and blue soulmark with Captain America, I mean.” He shook his head, smirking. “It is what it is. My beautiful face has become even more of a symbol than it was before. I’ll be hearing country-related jokes for the rest of my life.”
Tony leaned forward into the microphones, taking off his sunglasses and folding them into his vest pocket. “Like Cap said, we’re looking into it. Usually the bad guys leave some kind of calling card, but not this time.”
Carol smirked. “Nothing, really. But it’ll make a great story.”
Tony nodded. “Yeah, yeah. Let’s get down to it.” He looked at Reed. “Did you get the files I sent over?”
“I’ll take it under advisement,” she teased. Then she tilted her head and asked seriously, “What’s wrong?”
The waitress came back in a few minutes and took their order for dessert—two milkshakes.
“What?” Tony asked, exasperated. He shook Bruce’s hand off. “Can we maybe focus on the fact that I was wrongfully accused of attacking a civilian’s store?”
He made it to the rooftop without really considering how flying instead of driving would change his conversation strategy. It became suddenly, explicitly apparent when he saw Tony in his suit, putting on his helmet. Steve was going to be in Tony’s arms—super close—and unable to see his face—not close enough.
daydreams about Steve—he had never gone through a scenario in which the mark took away a part of his identity. He’s imagined the typical ones—a handshake, tap on the shoulder, touch on the back of the hand, or even an accidental mark on his lower back after his shirt had ridden up. Given the nature of their work together, Tony thought there might be other opportunities, too. Maybe Steve would have to carry him out of a collapsing building, and the suit would somehow be broken, obviously; it had to be to allow Steve to touch him. So he might end up with a strong handprint around his wrist or ankle, or maybe his waist. Or, if it went the other way, he might have to rescue Steve. In that case, he imagined getting Steve to safety before pulling off his gauntlets, and marking Steve in the process of getting him medical attention.
“I can’t!” Johnny exclaimed, throwing his hands in the air. “What is this, the Atlantean inquisition over here? Give me a fucking break!”
He had to know. Steve made a promise that he would try. Maybe he could test the waters. See how Tony reacted to the idea of them becoming closer. Spending more time together.
Tony frowned. “I didn’t say it yet.”
on this side of the line.”
Tony licked his lips. “Yeah. I was going around to wish everyone a good holiday. Not sure what some of us celebrate, though.” Tony looked around, happening to glance at T’Challa and Ororo making conversation with the Asgardians who could make it: Thor, Loki, Sif, Angela, and Sera. Jane was also standing nearby, speaking intently with Bruce, Hank, and Jan. “Do you know if Wakandans celebrate Christmas or Kwanzaa? Or some other Wakandan-specific seasonal holiday?” Tony paused. “Is it racist to ask? As in I don’t want to assume they celebrate Kwanzaa, but maybe I should?” He quickly continued, “And is it Yule in Asgard? Yuletide? Is that an Earth-only thing?”
Cassie sighed. “No, it’s not that. It’s just they’ve been in a mood ever since the new soulmarks.”
you, it is nothing like any of that. Okay? Everything’s fine between me and him.”
Steve quickly added, “We’d rather not have to bother you in the middle of your own work. But since Doom is your specialty…”
“Tony.” Steve’s voice had a hard note to it. “It’s okay if you don’t want to go out with me. But you need to eat.”
Tony looked at Steve with incredible fondness in his eyes. “You’re getting there, soldier.”
Steve could understand that. He didn’t like any attention he got while he was out, either. “And you, sir?” he asked, looking at the other man.
“It’s a mixture of red, blue, and white,” Steve protested.
“It’s New Year’s Eve,” Bucky said. “I thought people didn’t exchange gifts?”
Tony turned around, removing his faceplate and smiling at Castle. “Your body armor, as promised.” He gestured to the pieces he had placed upon a staircase that was falling apart. “The most advanced prototype Stark Industries has to offer.”
“Okay.” Steve barely waited a second before he pressed on, “Then why do I feel like something’s wrong?”
Steve leaned back, stretching his legs out on the floor in front of him. He could watch whatever this was for a little while. Tony needed more time; Steve was sure of that. He could give his soulmate some space. They had to visit the Fantastic Four later today to follow up on those potential doombots, anyway. For sure they would talk then.
Bucky shrugged back. “I think it’s a combination of everything. You and Tony are Avengers co-captains. You save people on the regular. And you never show your personal life to the press.”
Steven [9:10 pm]

“I’m Captain America. Privacy wasn’t ever an option once I took on that mantle.” Steve thought about how to explain it to a civilian. “When someone takes on being a superhero, they know they’ll be in the public eye. Sometimes I wish things were different, but I wouldn’t trade it for anything.”
[9:07 pm] You already have.
“Sadly, I can only imagine.” Tony sighed. “My life is so tough.” He brightened up. “Hey, but not as tough as your guys, right? I mean, you suddenly have three kids. That’s huge.”
In another minute, Bruce, Sam, and Steve came back in the kitchen. Bruce and Sam went to get pizza right away, but Steve walked over to Tony.
“Focus. Focus!” Bucky clapped his hands together. “Stevie, we are
“Hmm. Okay, but what about the human body, though?” Tony asked, leaning forward as he prepared to scrutinize the answer.
Steve’s face fell slightly. “Oh.”
He could do it. Just one picture. That’s all he needed. Just one.
19: Steve was absolutely, without question, the most important person in his life.
“Oh, wow,” Matt said, straddling the cliff between shock and over-acting. “What a
Cassie spoke slowly, her voice already amplified by her larger form. “I need all non-Avengers to clear this area. Please drive away from the gate.”
Johnny shook his head, closing his eyes and breathing in hard through Sue’s hair. “He’s going to… ugh. I don’t even know.” He tried to calm down, but it was hard to push aside that he’d just betrayed his soulmate’s trust in the one way he was explicitly asked not to. “This is so bad.”
Steve whistled. “Low blow, pal.”
Bruce hopped on the comms, chiming in, “He does that. Got a visual on a bunch of the bots darting into the sewers. Chasing them down.”
positive outlook.
He could see her mind racing, suggesting all the ideas she must have been thinking for too long. “Was he in a fire, or does he have a fear of fire, so he can’t be with the Human Torch? Is he a racist, so you rejected him?” She licked her lips, nervous and unsure but determined to press on. “Did you try to rescue him but it was too late, and now he’s dead? Or in a coma? Did he move across country, or to another continent?” Her mouth opened and closed, trying to say too much too fast. “Did-did he reject you? Is he straight? Is he in a cult? Does he hate superheroes? Does he have a severe mental or physical disability that requires constant supervision? Because we could do that! We’re rich enough.” She shook her head. “Or, maybe, is he obsessed with following around a celebrity? Like a paparazzi? Did he want to exploit being with you? Is he obsessed with being with a celebrity, so you didn’t feel comfortable with him? Is he obsessed with, um, a video game or something? Does he never leave his house? Does he have some belief that you just can’t reconcile? Like, flat earth or anti-mutant or something?”
stripes on your soulmark.” He waved at Tony’s cheek. “It’s got the colors, but that doesn’t make it the American flag.”
. I wrote this great fic last year that people really seemed to enjoy, and now here the universe is, giving the people what they want!”
“Unfortunately not yet,” Steve replied. “We’re looking into it.”
“I love him, though.” Bobbi spread her hands out helplessly. “What can you do?”
Johnny made a face. “Ew.”
The man held the gesture for another few seconds before he smiled at Steve through the window. Dropping the salute, he nodded at Steve and proceeded to continue walking down the street, away from the diner.
“Are you saying I’m
would we focus on that? You just got your soulmark. That’s obviously the bigger deal.”
Steve turned red. “Oh, no, I didn’t mean—”
“—just saw Captain America save Tony Stark from an oncoming attack, resulting in a soulmate match! This could not have been a more dramatic reveal for the two longtime partners—”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I can only imagine it must be a relief to know you were meant to be with someone.”
Tony seemed to have the same idea as Steve, since they shared a brief look before Tony clapped his hands together. “Well, it’s been fun, but we have to get to work on this before the copycat strikes again.” He looked at Steve. “I sound ridiculous. Let’s go.”
Steve dropped his pencil and pad, leaving them on the table as he stood up. “F.R.I.D.A.Y., please alert whoever’s available.”

Tony eyed him balefully. “Why do you have to bring that up?”
“It’s okay,” Steve said, although he wasn’t sure that it was.
“You weren’t wearing your armor,” Steve argued. “You could have been seriously hurt!”
Foggy shook his head, waving his hands in between them. “Oh, please, just keep us in mind if you ever need any legal help, and we’ll call it even.” He handed over their business card.
The Stein @ChaseChaseChase * 29m
A holographic screen projected about three feet in the air above Tony’s bed. He narrowed his eyes at Rhodey, who seemed far too happy.
Tony unlatched and removed it, placing it on the table near the window, out of the way of their eating area. “Can’t go a minute without seeing my handsome face, huh?”
“It kinda looks bad now,” Clint pointed out.
Steve looked up at the ceiling, a habit he knew was silly but still couldn’t shake. “Sure. Thanks, F.R.I.D.A.Y.” He peeked into the workshop before deciding to just walk in.
Tony burst out laughing. “God, no! Could you imagine?”
The sudden flurry of even
“Interesting that you keep bringing up soulmates,” Carol said, fooling absolutely no one. “Have you touched Steve yet?”
Because it felt right, Steve flipped their hands around and brought Tony’s up to his mouth. He kissed the back of Tony’s hand, pressing his lips firmly into his soulmate’s skin.
Bruce had also brought along work, but when Steve had asked why he was even coming, the other man simply replied that they needed a Hulk there and Jennifer was already in court for the day. Clint was asleep.

“It doesn’t make him smart,” Rhodey explained. “Just smug.”
“Ugh, tough luck,” Carol replied. “But why didn’t you ask him after?”
Slapping a hand on his forehead and feeling like a completely love-struck buffoon, Steve shucked off his uniform and changed into a new pair of boxers. He would normally sleep just in his boxers, but he couldn’t quite shake the feeling that he should cover up more to show that he was respecting Tony’s wishes. So he pulled on a tank top and headed back to Tony’s floor, heart pounding as he stared the soulmark on his palm.
“I’m an artist,” Steve replied. “I’m not great with words.”
Clint coughed loudly into the comms.
“We’re in our suits. You really want to go scare some people like this?”
The camera began following Steve and Sam as they quickly headed to the car.
“You don’t understand.” He laughed, incredibly unhappily. “The more you talk, the more it’s clear you have no idea what you’re talking about.”
“Tony,” Bruce said, reaching over to gently place his hand on Tony’s knee. “Come on.”
But all these reporters were really putting a damper on what should have been a happier occasion. Steve steeled himself. He just had to wait out this initial storm. Once people calmed down, he’d be able to have a conversation with Tony. In three,
“Honestly? We should’ve left it sooner.” She ate more pizza, regretfully gazing into the distance.
Steve’s eyebrows went up. “I’ve always loved the idea of soulmates, Tony. It’s why I was willing to wait however long it took to meet mine.”
“It’s very couple-y,” Tony added because he’d never learned to shut up and he wasn’t about to start now. “You know that, right? Giving a key to someone is a thing that’s a milestone in a relationship.”
“No, I won’t, I promise,” she said, speaking slowly. “I just… don’t understand.”
Tony blinked at them. They didn’t have to yell so loudly and in unison like that, honestly.
“The other Avengers are gathering for lunch,” F.R.I.D.A.Y. stated.
And that’s it! The seven steps to snagging your soulmate. Learn them, live them, love them. Don’t forget to reblog this around everywhere, you heathens! ;)

“We’ll take your questions after a short recap of yesterday’s fight,” Steve stated. He sucked in a breath and began a retelling of what happened in the fight with the robots. He quickly covered the basics: they’d received the complaint reports, went out to investigate, discovered the miniature robots causing chaos, tracked them all down over several city blocks, and destroyed them before returning to base.
Tony held up his hands. “Okay, you all suck, I’m hanging up. Goodbye.”
Tony looked over at Sam, then to Steve. “What happened? Who said something?”
Tony laughed. “No, Cap. She means how Wanda matched with Carol and Rhodey.”

Rhodey smirked back at her. “You’re not going to outplay a player, Danvers.”
“Great,” Tony muttered.
Rolling her eyes, Cassie replied, “Fine. I’ll tell them. But this, you owe me for.”
“I had a few errands to run.” Pietro shook his head. “You can’t expect me to be at your beck and call.”
The car was ready to take them to the press conference, but Tony was running late. Steve didn’t mind waiting. This particular media storm had been scheduled unusually early. Eight in the morning wasn’t a great time for anybody. He figured they were trying to get it in before a large portion of businesses opened up at nine. Still, Steve wished they had chosen to do a primetime conference. He was an early riser, but the rest of his team had greeted him with baleful eyes and annoyed chewing as they piled in the car.
This was just like all the other times Tony had commented without receiving anything in response. He didn’t mind showing affection towards Steve. A lot of people had affection for the guy; Tony knew he wasn’t alone. And maybe that’s why Steve stayed silent about it. Tony’s compliments got lost in the crowd. That was fine. He didn’t really need recognition—or anything—from Cap. He knew they were close. That was enough.
After a tense moment, Castle put down his guns, holstering them with a grunt. “What.”
GertRUDE @FarLeftDinoFem * 23m
“Ah, but you didn’t organize this party. I did,” Tony pointed out. “And I had to work around everyone’s schedules. Actually, if you recall, both of you were unavailable during Hanukkah because you were visiting Magneto.”
“Yes, it’s fantastic, but that’s not what I was talking about,” Tony answered. “What you said on the watch. ‘Love, S.’”
“Go ahead.”
“How egotistical do you have to be to name everything after yourself?” Sam got up for another piece of pizza. “Soon enough we’re going to hear Latveria is Doom Country or some shit. It’s already got Doomstadt.”
“Now let’s get back to my ultimate Bioware gaythrough. Yes, I’m still planning on doing Mass Effect after this. And no, I’m still not going to skip Andromeda because I am not
Steve picked up a pencil and crossed one leg under the other as he began to sketch… whatever it was he spent his time drawing in the workshop. Tony wasn’t sure, exactly. “Your machines love you. They just also like me.”
“So, sort of both,” Natasha said, deadpan.
Reed blinked. “Well. That’s true.”
Tony’s mouth dropped open as he stared at Johnny. “You have a secret boyfriend? I’m honestly impressed. I didn’t know hiding things was your style.” He gestured to Johnny’s soulmate mark: a thumbprint on the front upper shell of his left ear that matched a fingerprint on the back in bright red and blue with small white stripes shooting across it. If anything, it resembled someone quickly pinching his ear, but Steve had never heard that story.

Pepper peacefully replied, “We’re a unique superhero team. We utilize unique solutions.”
Some of the reporters were following after them, asking questions, but a lot more were running to their news vans and assembled cars. Bobbi was already climbing into their car when they got there. Sam pushed Steve in first. As soon as Sam closed the door, the car took off, heading for Avengers Tower.
“Yes. Because I do love you, Tony. And I have for a long while.”
Steve crossed his arms over his chest defensively. “What? I don’t.”
The camera stayed on Steve as he got into the car, recording as it drove away.
Everyone broke down laughing. Spider-Man nearly fell off his web, dangling by three limbs before he readjusted himself.
“How is that even possible,” Bucky stated, disbelieving. “I feel like you guys touch each other all the time.”
“Yeah?” Steve asked nervously.
, Steven. Give me time!”
“Use a mug!” Tony gestured to the collection of mugs they kept on the table holding the coffee machine. “That’s literally why they’re there!”
The fourth, and final: Steve was the only person close enough to Tony. He saw the brick. He could act as a shield.
Tony blinked. “Guess I’m keeping it then. Maybe a wardrobe change?” He laughed lightly. “Have to do something about the mark.”
Rhodey slowly raised one eyebrow. “You just got your soulmark with the love of your life. What
Tony swallowed hard. He gripped Steve’s shirt tighter. “I don’t want to start our relationship off on the wrong foot.”
“I’m trying to.”
@FarLeftDinoFem I don’t really feel marginalized tbh
Tony blew out a breath of air his eyes sliding shut. “If that’s what you want, fine.” Tony’s eyes flashed back open and he pinned Steve with a furious glare. “ It started with the Accords which, I’ll admit, came at a bad time for me. After Ultron I was struggling with the guilt of the destruction I had caused, Pepper and I had ended things, it was-” Tony felt his chest tighten when he thought back. “Not a great time.”
__________
“Then why are you here?” Tony wasn’t here for pleasantries and he sure that was clear by now.
"My hand was beginning to hurt, it sort of cramps up when I draw in the cold." Steve explained, probably sensing how tense Tony had gotten.
“What was that?” Steve was back on his feet, he looked like he was going to go barreling out after that alien. His eyes were wild. “What did you
He settled on:
He thought he might have heard footsteps and people approaching him. He hoped they would see his smile and that would be enough to keep them going. Because the battle wasn’t over, they just had the advantage on the opposing team.
“You’re not.” Steve skated them over to the side of the rink, waiting until Tony grabbed the railing before letting him go. He did a little spin for show and Tony rolled his eyes.
Steve watched Tony for a few fleeting moments, his jaw still tight and anger still visible in the lines on his face. His fist clenched and unclenched and then he walked away, murmuring something to Natasha as he left.
“What’s wrong? Why are you on the ground?” He asked, confused and worried because nothing was making sense. His mind jumped to Rhodey and Vision, and he got up again. If Natasha was alright for now, he had to go find the others.
“Might fall ‘sleep.” Tony mumbled, and Steve smiled fondly before pressing a kiss to the top of his head. He smelled faintly of grease, coffee, and lavender soap. It was so inherently Tony that it made Steve feel safe and warm when for years all he had known was the cold.
“Stop, stop doing that. Expecting me to know things I couldn’t possibly know. Will you just talk to me without riddles? I can’t take it anymore. The world is ending and I’m sick of this shit.” Tony stood up, resting his palms on the surface of the dark wooden desk. He was fed up and exhausted. He couldn’t do this anymore not with Steve.
Rhodey smiled larger than Tony had seen in awhile, like he had an inside joke Tony wasn’t a part of. “I can teach him some dance moves.”
__________
He dreamt of the cold and Siberian huskies. He couldn’t decide if the huskies were more like dogs or wolves, but when he approached them they jumped on him and nuzzled at his neck. He felt a stinging pain and realized they were just getting close to sink their teeth in.
Steve began to move them backwards towards the desk and if Tony didn’t have a mouthful of Steve’s expert tongue he would have protested. There was no way his first time with Steve was going to be against a desk. Once Steve had his fill of exploring Tony’s mouth and making his brain short circuit, he pulled away to tug at Tony’s zipper.
__________
“The Guardian’s can take care of up there, we need you on the ground. Plus, they have help.” Steve stepped through the threshold, eyes wandering around his old space. Tony knew some of his things were laying around but he didn’t care if Steve noticed. World ending threats tended to do that to a person. Tony was ready for honesty.
Tony had a sense when it came to the bad days, most likely because he wasn’t immune to them either. He’d hang out around Steve more than usual, probably resisting the urge to ditch him for his workshop. He’d listen when Steve gave orders out on the field and he wouldn’t object or blatantly disobey.
He went off to help Peter more than once. He worried about the kid more than he cared to admit and wanted desperately to do right by him in a way no father figure had done for him. But the amount of trouble that kid got into was unreasonable, and that was by Tony standards.
Their breaths mingled together, and Steve only moved away when Tony’s tongue had thoroughly explored every inch of his mouth and he need a full breath of air. Tony’s lips were still well within striking distance as he did so, and they were red and shiny from the kiss.
“You let the alien get away!” There was utter distress in Steve’s eyes but Tony wasn’t sorry for what he did. He would have done it a million times over. It was a stone and Steve couldn’t possibly think Tony would have chosen it over his life. Over both of theirs.
Tony smiled, turning his head to look over at Steve. When had he gotten so close? Tony could make out every speck of green in his eyes, and wasn’t it annoying that Zemo was right about that? Green just like the ominous stone. “I think it’d bring out the color in your eyes. Plus, everyone likes flashy.”
Tony paused, eyebrows knitting together before motioning for her to follow him. He went down the hallway with his attention focused ahead, hearing Natasha’s nearly inaudible footsteps beside him. He had to stop himself from breaking out into a run but it didn’t take long for them to find Vision and Rhodey.
“That’s not how that works.” Steve shook his head, dragging Tony closer to himself. Tony let it happen, he was past arguing or trying to dissuade the hulk of muscle. “You have to admit that it’s fun.” Steve said but Tony shook his head resolutely, and Steve must have taken that as a challenge if the look in his eyes was any indication.
Tony took a step back with a grin pulling at his lips again, pronouncing his smile lines. "And you, my friend, you’re standing.”
He debated what to text, running through different options and deleting each one with a small shake of his head.
“Get the coffee going, would you FRIDAY?” Tony was on the search for paper towels when he forgot why he wanted them. Frustrated, he nearly ran a hand through his hair before remembering there were bandages in his way. Tony gave up and sat down at the counter.
Tony couldn’t have hid his glee at her appearance if he had tried. Even FRIDAY had sounded excited when announcing her presence to the rest of the compound. Vision was still awkwardly making his way down the stairs and Rhodey was on the couch when he saw her.
“It’s not real. And you’re the one who didn’t want to slap a band-aid on this, or did you forget?” Steve hissed under his breath, like one of their teammates could be lurking around and would overhear their trademark bickering. Tony knew they were all already used to it, they’d had heard years of it. Maybe Steve just wanted everyone to think they were fine and the team could work again. Tony couldn’t bring himself to care anymore.
Rhodey had stood before of course, even walked, but never without either the help of Tony or the bars he had set up.
He was alone but Tony knew he didn’t feel that way. He couldn’t possibly with all the Avengers back and buzzing around. Steve probably felt enough just soaking up their happiness without any of his own. He caught Tony’s gaze and his hand beckoned him over, an invitation Tony hadn’t realized he had been waiting for. His feet urged him to move forward but he resisted, if only for a couple of seconds.
Tony was strong enough to put on a brave face.
Tony wasn’t sure exactly how much time had passed. He wasn’t sure exactly how long he had been staring at the flip phone. He was aware that he could just ask FRIDAY but he really didn’t want to know.
“What?” Steve asked mechanically and Tony couldn’t peg any anger which meant it was being carefully disguised. Tony had a feeling Steve would already know his response.
“Shoot for more realistic goals.” Tony felt one side of his mouth twist up, and he walked around to the side of his desk. His right hand sliding against the top and collecting dust. “Anyways that’s all I got. You remember the rest, no need to get into the gory details of the story.”
__________
"I can't believe you've been hiding this from me all these years. You're an artistic genius. And I especially like this dashingly handsome man, he seems really smart to me." Tony turned his head and met Steve's gaze. The honest truth, undisguised by his usual boisterous attitude spilled from his lips. "It's really nice."
Tony’s eyes lifted from the cup, roaming over Steve’s face until they settled on a spot above his eyebrow.“Well that explains it, you were off painting murals of me.” Tony teased, but he wasn’t wrong, in fact he had it exactly right but Steve didn’t mention it.
Tony turned his head when he heard the boom of Thanos’ voice. His fingers instinctively clutched tighter around Steve’s limp body.
“I love you.” Tony was the words, he was the breath they floated on. He was the air and he was the sky. Tony was a bird and finally, after so many years-
Steve shoved his hands in the pockets of some seriously hideous cargo pants. “Wanted to check in, make sure everything was….okay.” He sounded hesitant, like he might set Tony off with poor word choice. Too late for that.
Tony chuckled, turning back towards the counter and the awfully nice bartender who Tony had noticed had been staring at him a little too long to be casual. “Sweetheart, do you mind getting me a drink? Preferably something strong.”
Steve was a stubborn as always when he shook his head, eliciting an annoyed noise from Tony. “I told you, I gave up Captain America when I dropped that shield. And you’re only trying to give it back to me to help but you don’t even think I deserve it.”
The rest was slow motion. Before Tony could get a good look at the alien, who he was fairly sure was from the Black Order, it was striking forward and Tony had to make a quick decision. He knew what he should do, and he knew what he was going to do before he even moved.
There was a sudden burst of light and Tony lifted Steve’s shield to deflect it and stop it from blinding him. Once the surge passed, Tony lowered the shield and looked around. He thought the dust might be receding. He thought everything looked brighter. He thought that this might be what rebirth looked like.
Tony was probably going to get hostility until he gave in to Steve and his stupid insistence that they talk everything out. Tony would probably bend, he knew himself well enough to not kid himself but he probably wouldn’t bend as soon as Steve wanted him too.
“Stark.” Tony looked up, knowing that voice all too well. Standing in front of him in the flesh was Barton, looking royally pissed off. Tony pushed Dum-E towards the door to go help Peter.
“Ross told me he wouldn’t deal with me if we were still dating since you are a criminal. Not just because of bad optics and the criminal thing but also because he thought that it would skew my judgment too much if we were still together. I couldn’t risk telling him to shove it and I was a little mad at the time, admittedly. So I told him we weren’t together anymore.” Tony explained, glancing over at Steve apologetically. He knew how much Steve had despised not being able to tell people about their relationship before. Even though the circumstances were impossibly different, Tony felt bad.
“You’re not talking about the team, are you?” Steve’s face twisted into something much darker and Tony thought he might hate himself. He could have chosen this opportunity to let things go and make something better out of the shambles of their old teamsmanship but instead they were going to stay shambles.
Natasha pulled away enough to give him an appraising look. “Don’t shoulder all the blame, we all had a part to play.” She patted his shoulder and pulled away fully. She began towards the couch to address Rhodey.
“-ony! Please, please, you’re alright. Oh god.” Steve’s arms curled around his bleeding stomach, trying to staunch the blood flow. Tony knew it was too late for that. His head fell to the side and he caught sight of Peter and he seemed to be crying.
Rhodey laughed. “That’s very flattering.” He sat down beside Tony, his newest exoskeletal brace making a small noise as he did so. Tony peered down, wondering if he had to make some adjustments.
Steve shrugged almost bashfully, bending down to drop his notebook. Tony opened his mouth to ask why when Steve began to shrug off his jacket.
The ground scratched the skin on his forearms, causing it to peel and producing his blood for the broken ground underneath himself. His suit and his many backups were now loose parts and broken metal, leaving him vulnerable. That was the last thing on his mind.
“We’re home.” Tony said excitedly, pushing the door open. He kicked it closed behind them with his foot and without warning he was being pushed backwards. Tony’s back collided with the door just as Steve stepped forward and pressed a demanding kiss against his pliant lips.
“She should know you’re taken.” Steve insisted and Tony leveraged Steve’s shoulder to lower him enough to place a kiss on his bearded cheek. Tony was still getting used to the beard, but he didn’t hate the way it felt. It was just distracting.
Steve turned away, eyes drawn to his drawing balanced next to the window. “That’s the only thing?”
Steve stumbled for a moment before establishing his balance and spinning back around towards Tony, nearly doubled over with laughter now. And Tony couldn’t find it in himself to be seriously frustrated, not with
On those nights, Steve would usually refrain from bothering Tony. He didn’t love the fact that he stayed up so late and lived off minimal amounts of sleep and loads of coffee but he didn’t know if it was his place to say anything. They were together but they hadn’t been for long. Steve wasn’t exactly sure what they were, he wasn’t even sure if he could call Tony his boyfriend. Their teammates didn’t even know about their relationship.
“Tony! Stay with me, come on. I can’t lose you.” Steve’s fingers curled around his chin and Tony caught sight of him again. In his last moments he decided there was no place he’d rather be.
Steve's fingers tightened around strands of Tony’s hair and Tony’s hand came up to cup his cheek, his thumb moving in a circular motion across his jaw. Tony’s tongue swiped across his lower lip with intent to deepen the kiss, and Steve obliged, his mouth opening wide enough for Tony to slip his tongue past his parted lips.
“No, I don’t want to do that.” Steve assured Tony, handing him a package that was oddly shaped. Tony shook it curiously, trying to get an idea of what it was.
“We have to do something.” Tony stared at the burner in one of his hands and the jewel in the other. Steve would tell him not to, but he couldn’t just sit back when he could do something.
Tony’s suit flew to his body and materialized into his armor in mere seconds. He stepped in front of Steve and held up a repulsor, charged and ready to fire.
Tony was no stranger to the press, his whole life had basically been a big press tour, but it hit a little too close to home when he had to listen to complete morons comment on things they didn’t understand.
Painting had made him lose track of time, or more accurately painting Tony made him lose track of time. He was only about halfway done with painting he had been working on, leaving the Tony on his easel with only an upper body and a faint background. Steve thought it looked good anyway.
He extended his arm, figuring a handshake was probably more appropriate. Natasha shook her head at him, eyes flicking to his extended hand. “Put that down.” She told him without any real intensity. And then she threw her arms around him.
Steve could make out Tony’s face now, and his eyes were trained on the television with focus that would make anyone feel significant. Steve wasn’t exactly sure how he ever got that focus on himself, but he certainly hoped it would never go away because he was happier with Tony than he had ever been before.
Tony was really still trying to understand what Rhodey was saying. Maybe it was just the drama of the whole situation with Vision and Rhodey was just over exaggerating. He couldn’t even begin to fathom why Steve would care, or react like how Rhodey was saying he had.
Steve sighed, digging his hand underneath his shirt to lift out his dog tags, and sitting on the chain beside them was a ring that matched Tony’s. “I know, I could never forget that.” Steve assured Tony with a one-sided smile, dropping the chain beneath his shirt once again.
It was 3 A.M. and Steve couldn’t stop tossing and turning. He was exhausted, he could feel it in his bones, but his mind kept poking and prodding when he closed his eyes. An easy solution would be finding Tony.
“We need you if we are going to beat this thing, alright? I-” Tony paused, drawing in a breath of air, he held back the words that threatened to escape him. “We didn’t have backup and we weren’t powerful enough to beat that thing.”
Rhodey nodded, focus wrinkling his forehead. "Good, I think. This feels almost too easy.” He lifted his gaze from where they were attached to his feet.
“I might not have disclosed everything about this ice skating rink.” Tony admitted, leading Steve towards an obviously old and broken down waiting area. “This place was abandoned and destroyed but I sort of fixed it. I was going to do more with it, even learn to skate and try to impress you, but you came sooner than I expected.”
Tony dropped his chin in his hand, tapping his fingers against the counter as he waited. He turned his head and sure enough, he had forgotten all about the scotch he had ordered earlier. He was leaning over to get it when he heard footsteps walking towards him.
“Not exactly, but Admiral Ackbar sure does look like a lobster.” Steve couldn’t exactly see Tony’s expression but he imagined he was close to laughing.
__________
He was on some sort of bed, maybe a couch, and above him were two very disapproving faces. He blinked heavily, trying to make them out but the red hair and the broad shoulders were dead giveaways.
“The Accords weren’t ideal and god knows I didn’t do the best job of making my case for them but it meant we all got to stay together. It meant something like Sokovia might never happen again. And that was enough for me.” Tony raked a hand through his hair, fingernails brushing against his scalp. “I’m usually the last person to go with the government, I literally had to fight them tooth and nail to keep my Iron Man suit, but this time I was willing to go along.”
Tony was still trying to make a decision when Steve began sucking kisses into his neck. It quickly became far too difficult to think about much of anything, let alone make a decision. Tony let his head drop to the side exposing his neck for Steve to ravage.
Tony pulled away, untangling a hand from Steve’s hair to place on his chest. He sucked in air gratefully, trying to steady himself and retain some composure if at all possible. But he couldn’t help his eyes from drifting down to Steve’s swollen, wet lips. He could still feel the scratch of Steve’s beard against his skin.
“Shh!” Tony slapped Steve’s chest but it was light and Steve barely felt it. “Don’t say that out loud. People could hear you and my reputation would be...obliterated. Could you imagine what people would think of me?”
Instead he had stood there, staring, not completely sure what his face looked like. Did it betray his anger? Did it show the lack of trust he felt?
Steve pulled Tony flush against himself, closing even the smallest of spaces lying between them. His lips were impatient against Tony’s and Tony could barely manage a breath between ferocious kisses that burned his lips.
“I deserved it, don’t worry your pretty little head about it so much.” Tony could sense Steve’s frown of righteous indignation without even looking at him. He brought his drink to his lips and swallowed about half of the cup in one go before putting it down.
He thought of the desert and a ripped jacket wrapped around his head.
“Maybe.” Vision stated thoughtfully, a very rare smile appeared on the android. “Do you think they will come home?” He sounded awfully hopeful.
“Tell me about it. I
Tony’s must have looked dumbstruck because Steve looked to be biting back a laugh. Tony blinked, trying to clear his head. Steve was in front of him. And it didn’t seem possible but it was true. Steve who he had been holding onto through memories and frequent calls but none of it was the same as the real thing. Steve physically in front of him,
"Not sure." Tony stepped into Steve's space, peering over at his sketchbook. "May I see?"
He could fathom being left in a freezing bunker in Siberia. But not this.
It didn’t feel like very long before they were pulling up to the compound. Steve sat up and in turn, Tony sat up as well.
“You heard me.” Tony tucked his hands underneath his armpits. “I don’t want to talk to you.
Steve stripped them both of the rest of their clothes with impatience while Tony laid back and admired Steve’s body. Tony almost told him to slow down a little but he couldn’t bring himself to do it when he desperately wanted Steve. It was a frightening, all-consuming thing.
“I’m falling.” Tony clung to Steve convinced that he was slipping despite not moving. Steve’s arms wrapped around his middle and kept him upright, anchoring him.
Tony looked down, he’d also forgotten about the jacket. Before he had the chance to respond, fingers gently nudged his chin up and he met Steve’s gaze with wide eyes. His eyes dipped down to Steve's lips as he attempted to judge the situation.
“Several. Promise.” Tony affirmed, and Steve covered Tony’s hand with his own before tugging it towards his lips for a soft kiss placed on his palm.
“Eat my dust.” Steve called from up ahead and if Tony wasn’t so focused on not slipping up then he would have fallen over laughing. Tony huffed amusedly, pushing himself to go faster, even as it grew harder to handle his speed.
“Yeah, yeah, don’t go getting all sentimental over it. It was one pot of coffee, keep it in your pants Rogers. I’m trying to save the poor pedestrians trying to cross the street. Actually dismiss that previous statement, don’t keep it in your pants. I hear sleepy sex is the best kind and we should really try to figure that out for the betterment of humanity and all that. I’m trying to win the Nobel Peace Prize, in case you forgot-” Tony rambled as they walked over to the elevator, still tangled together.
Steve obviously wasn’t going to be the first to say something, and that irritated Tony in a fairly insignificant but bothersome way. Somehow the man was always under his skin. Apparently time didn’t change all that much between them.
“Yeah.” Steve agreed with a sigh, leaning forward and kissing Tony again. It was short and sweet and Tony savored it like a dehydrated man might savor a couple of drops of water. Not nearly enough to quench his thirst, but it was a start.
Tony felt his anger spark, and that could really only exacerbate the situation. “Rogers, I couldn’t just sit back, okay? This isn’t my field of expertise but Bruce isn’t here and there was a viable replacement for the mind stone in the palm of my hand.” Tony’s fingers twitched subconsciously.
The decision to save as many lives as possible was never an easy one and it wasn’t fair for him to expect the average person to understand that. But he was just so tired.
Rogers hit the nail on the head with that one, or at least the pompous bastard assumed he did.
They slept together most nights, unless there was some sort of mission that kept them out late. Or on an off day when they couldn’t quite face each other because a mission had gone south and had caused an argument.
He must have dropped it when he had hit his head, evidenced by the scratch marks on the phone. It was apparently indestructible because it was still in fighting condition. Tony was about to pocket it when he realized Steve had probably given it back to him. He didn’t know what to make of that. He flipped the phone open and saw a message.
“And our nightmare.”
Tony had nearly caught up to Steve when suddenly he was going far too fast and his skate went too far forward, resulting in Tony falling on his ass and landing backwards on his elbow. Tony groaned, noting the sound of Steve turning around to the tune of grounding ice under his skates.
“No, it’s not but there
Tony leaned into it while simultaneously pushing at Steve’s chest. Steve backed up enough for Tony to get a word out. “We did not wait this long to not make it to the bedroom.” Tony cleared his throat. “You up for a mission?”
“We practically talked every day.” Steve pointed out, but the way he leaned into Tony’s touch proved that he had missed Tony as much as Tony had missed him. Steve covered Tony’s hand over his chest with gentle fingers.
He walked up to the counter, glancing over at the coffee machine. The pot was full and the coffee was still producing steam which meant Tony had come up from his workshop for fuel and had passed out in the process.
“I’m going to fall.” Tony protested but began to move, dragging his feet across the ice, always feeling one second away from a deathly skid but Steve’s hold wouldn't allow that to happen. It was a comforting safety net that was for sure.
“What I mean, is that we will talk about it and we will work through it. We always do. That’s what marriage is. But right now I just want to enjoy this time we have together because I don’t know when I’m going to see you again.” Tony said, firm and with unwavering resolve. “And frankly, nobody else is going to patiently teach me how to ice skate.” He tacked on, just to relieve the heaviness beginning to shroud around them.
Ross considered him for a couple of fleeting moments. His eyes were tight with scrutiny and he looked anything but happy. “I didn’t.” He brushed past Tony and by the time he turned around Ross was long gone.
They lost the stone. The alien had already disappeared.
“We’re going to beat Thanos. I swear it.” Steve’s hand dropped and he was watching Tony with a pained expression. Tony had thought the phone call would have cheered him up but now he just seemed like a small boy from Brooklyn.
“Because I’m dating Captain America. So I win. Game over.” Tony stood and dropped his controller dramatically. Steve dropped Tony’s coffee mug at the same time.
It was the skyline, elegantly crafted and almost animated in style but featured most prominently was a figure. A frankly ridiculous looking figure with pajamas and an overflowing jacket. But there was something glowing there that made the man seem much less lonely than he could've been. And there was a soft light emanating from the figure's chest, the only distinguishing feature save for the rowdy hair and famous beard.
“It’s not what it looks like-” Tony began but his eyes caught on the shoes the man beside him was wearing and those weren’t Rhodey’s shoes. They looked oddly familiar and Tony gripped the drink in his hand as tight as he could without creating a mess. Something wasn’t right.
“But you’re the good when everything else is bad. You are better than any other person in this messed up world. Honestly, I admire you Steve Rogers. And tomorrow I will jump into the heat of battle with you and I won’t bat an eye. I just have one more thing, to say-” Tony shut the phone, looking down at it. “I’ll save it for tomorrow.”
Tony leaned against the railing and peered down at the roads down below. He watched a sampling of cars drive by and then he turned his gaze back towards the tall buildings looming ahead. They seemed darker now, the whole night seemed ready to swallow him whole.
“Who said I don’t want to go out with you?” Tony asked, affronted.
“There you go.”
Tony immediately pointed to a map of the city. “Are you running a predictive algorithm?”
@niconoir HAHAHAHAHAHAHAH sqwak squuaaaaak

Castle began running down the street, continuing after the thief.
“Norman Osborn stole one of your prototype suits,” Steve tried.
Tony slowed down and aimed for the rooftop landing site—something all superhero teams had if they owned property. The Fantastic Four’s was a bit different. It was designed to accommodate space travel, so there were extra safety precautions and a more highly structured landing pad.
He slid his cell phone out of his pocket and quickly thumbed over to one of his most-used contacts: Hot Stuff. It only took a few moments for his boyfriend to answer.
omg its still so good. everybody needs to rewatch this video. i just noticed clints mouth open and closing like a birds. fucking goldmine
“You know, I’m really not pushing,” Steve eventually replied.
Of course you will [9:29 pm]
Steve shrugged. “Yeah. But I got some help from some lawyers—”
Tony groaned. “Fine, I’ll up your processors so you can stream your shows faster. Happy?”
Tony was real. They’d been friends for so long that Steve knew how high the risk was of confessing. He wanted more, but he felt a fear deep in his gut that saying anything to Tony would mean losing him. It was ridiculous. They were already so close. Surely, Tony wouldn’t cut him off?
“Steve. It’s going to be fine. Just give him some time to figure things out.” He let go of Steve and stared at him, apparently willing his friend to see reason.
Tony slowly spun the milkshake glass around and around with his gauntleted hand, eyes focused on the condensation collecting on the table. “Were you?”
It took him over a month to show Johnny his face. Revealing his identity was a huge risk. He trusted Johnny implicitly. But he knew mistakes happened, and his rogue’s gallery was filled with supervillains who targeted his loved ones. He explained everything to Johnny—about Uncle Ben, Gwen, and realizing he couldn’t take another hit like that. Johnny had understood. Johnny always understood everything Peter threw at him.
Carol elbowed Rhodey. “Yeah, overnight parents. That’s a thing now.”
“We don’t live together. I go off on missions all the time. I don’t understand why this is different.” Wanda bit her lower lip. “Can you try to contact them again? Please?”
“We did it because we had so many shared Avengers activities, and you know that.” Tony narrowed his eyes at Steve.
Clint cleared his throat. “Also? I’ll continue flirting with my wife, thanks.”
Definitely.
“If we get over a hundred dollars in donations, my boyfriend will dress up as Captain America and join me for a co-op stream! You guys will get to vote on the game! And, before you ask, no, he doesn’t look like Cap, but I don’t look like Tony and them’s the breaks.”
“Tony.”
Tony flew in front of Castle’s face and pulled up his faceplate—not to block his progress, but to really look at him. “This isn’t a war zone, Castle. This is New York.”
Spider-Man groaned incredibly loudly. He took the comm out of his pocket, turned it on, and groaned into it even louder.
Steve flinched.
“Slightly better,” Tony muttered.
None of that was particularly shocking. His workshop was a dangerous, busy place, after all, and he had told everyone time and again to watch where they were walking, wall-crawling, slinking, sneaking, flying, teleporting, dancing, stomping, swinging, and super-speed running. What he hadn’t expected was for Wanda to gasp right as Rhodey and Carol exchanged shocked, wide-eyed glances.
do you think—”
Tony snorted. “Trust me, it’s hardly our first.”
Look, how desperate are you, really? If you’re like the rest of us, then why not eliminate your shame and go for an ‘accidental’ kick on the train, bus, or subway? There are worse ways to find your match. No shade.
Tony shrugged. “It doesn’t mean anything.” He called the elevator to bring them down to the workshop. The suits had to get put away before anything else. “So he’s used to my comments. So what? The team’s full of sarcasm and snarky remarks. I’m not the only one he hears shit from.”
Laura nods back at him. “It is, it really is.”
Tony spread out his hands. “You’re right. I’m very memorable.”
[__]     < >     <3
“We already talked about it.” Steve slowly drank his soda, taking a moment to clear his mind of everything but this. He wanted Tony to have his full attention. Sometimes that took a bit of effort after a fight that left them with no real answers. “What else is there to say?”
Steve laughed.
“Watches,” Foggy said. “This place has high-quality watches with unique elements. And they engrave them. Go look around, shout if anything in particular strikes your fancy.”
much.”
“Great work. Any sign of Quicksilver?”
“I’m going to assume that this somebody isn’t a threat?” Tony stepped out of the office, hearing relative silence. FRIDAY didn’t answer him and when Tony went to the door he saw Rhodey glowering at the intruder who was currently enveloped in the shadows.
Steve loomed above him, looking far more concerned than what Tony thought to be healthy. “Are you okay?” He stretched his hand out towards Tony and Tony took it but instead of pulling himself up, he pulled Steve down beside him.
“You can’t quit, you haven’t even done anything.” Steve pointed out, fingers dancing across Tony’s hand in an irregular pattern.
It was a miracle they found a moment alone. Thanos had all the infinity stones now and the infinity gauntlet to go with it. Everyone was just waiting for the inevitable. The moment he finally attacked. Tony’s bets were on tomorrow. So were Natasha’s.
Tony rolled his eyes, fully aware Steve couldn’t see it since he was turned away but he didn’t want to turn around. “Now
Steve nodded like that’s exactly what he expected to hear, and yet he didn’t seem all too pleased. Steve opened and closed his mouth a couple of times, as if not sure exactly what to say anymore. His practiced speech running from his brain. When it finally seemed as if he had settled on something, Tony spoke up to stop him.
Tony wasn't sure how much longer he stood lingering before heading back inside. His mind felt heavy as he did so.
Steve was looking at him now, and Tony couldn’t tell exactly what was running through his head but he thought he saw hints of regret.
Tony pushed forward. “And then there was the airport debacle, and really all I wanted was to keep you and your team from becoming criminals. I wanted you guys to stay and not give up being Avengers.” Tony shook his head, fingers tightening around the desk and turning his knuckles white. “If we could’ve just talked, I would have been on your side and Rhodey wouldn’t be-” Tony trailed off, his eyes dropping to the desk. “As soon as I realized I was wrong, I came to help you.”
“Stop, stop! I get it.” Tony laughed breathlessly, and Steve moved his hand around himself, drawing Tony to his front. Tony retained his footing by some miracle. “Look, for a man who was stuck in ice for so long, it’s only fair that you know how to manipulate it like magic or something. But I hate magic and I didn’t live in ice, so I’m not as good at this. Shocking, I know.” Tony caught his breath, fingers frighteningly tight around Steve’s.
He ran his tongue along his teeth, wondering how much longer it would be until sleep finally came. He couldn’t even bring himself to get up and go to the gym. Steve sat up and switched on the lamp on his bedside table. Tony always reminded him that he could just ask FRIDAY to turn it on for him. Steve hated doing that, it felt wrong, so he always turned it on manually and Tony always smiled.
Tony flipped the phone open with his thumb, his movements quick and sharp as if he expected the phone to burn him. The whole thing was an abomination to modern technology and Tony really wanted to inform Steve that what this shitty phone was doing to him should be considered criminal.
“Well, that should be interesting. Why aren’t these “super powered people” Avengers?” Sam asked, raising his eyebrows and crossing his arms over his chest. “I mean, are we even Avengers?”
“Sometimes I forgot what these ten years have done to me.” Tony gestured towards his chest but Steve caught his hand and held it against his own chest. It wasn’t a tight but rather a gentle, reassuring pressure.
“I should be thanking you. This is the nicest gift I’ve ever received.” Tony carefully tucked the drawing back into the packaging, afraid of wrinkling the paper. He rolled the small disco ball between his fingers. “I’m putting this next to my car keys on my keyring. Or maybe I’ll hang it on Dum-E, but I’m scared he’ll break it or himself.” Tony put it back in the packaging beside the drawing. He secured it all and tucked the gift into his hoodie before pulling Steve up for a kiss to express his thank you.
“Mind being a little less subtle than that? Clint and I have already begun placing bets on when the tabloids are going to come out.” Rhodey rolled his eyes, eyeing the scotch on the counter with disdain. He was slowly inching it away from Tony.
“I was..trying to figure some things out on my own but-” Steve sighed, pulling at his hair. Tony thought it looked painful. “I think it would be good for the team get together and bond?”
It was dreadfully slow progress, and Tony knew there were other Avengers he should be looking out for. Problem was that amongst whirling winds and explosions, he couldn’t see anyone else. He could only see Steve.
“There’s a cute ice skating rink just a walk away from here. I know, because I’ve been eyeing it for weeks. The trouble is that I can’t skate.” Tony explained, tilting his head back to get an upside-down look at Steve.
It made sense at first, that Steve wouldn’t try to bring up the man that had murdered his parents while he was still trying to repair things. Not that he hadn’t come to his senses on that issue, but it still hurt and would probably always hurt. But now he was curious as to how no one had mentioned him.
Steve was late for movie night, which was a rare thing. He was the biggest advocate for team bonding, which made it almost mandatory for him to attend team bonding activities. Even if he spent that time joking around with Tony, whose eyes lit up when he laughed.
Steve looked up, the lines on his forehead making themselves known. “You do?” Tony watched as Steve slipped back into his uniform, buckling it up and bringing himself closer to the destruction of tomorrow. Tony wondered breezily if he should feel vulnerable still naked in the bed with only a sheet hiding him from the still heated air around them.
“I suppose so.” Tony agreed absentmindedly. “You didn’t fall in love with anyone else while I was gone, right?” He asked, just to make sure, as he glanced down at Steve’s lips. He'd meant it as a joke but his tone betrayed his neediness.
Tony turned his head toward Steve, biting back laughter at the sudden spark of jealousy. “You’re such a snoop, but don’t worry she doesn’t hold a candle to you, babe. Or an iPhone flashlight, because nobody really uses candle’s anymore.” He patted Steve’s back, attempting to be semi-comforting. “She’s harmless.”
Speaking of Rogers, Tony hadn’t been seeing much of him around other than passing him in the hallway just once. He hadn’t been aware that Steve had come by at all, and Tony realized how just as soon as Steve passed by him without a word or even a cursory glance. Tony had paused in the hallway, throwing a glance over his shoulder to be sure he wasn’t seeing things. He was pretty sure he was the one who should be acting like a child and ignoring Steve, not vice versa.
“Fine.” Tony conceded, clunking towards the skating rink with one hand on Steve’s arm. Steve walked beside Tony much more gracefully, and Tony already knew he was amused. “You’re an ass. You better be the best ice skater in the world.” Tony shoved his laughing figure onto the ice without warning.
A very different ending.
He looked good but so different. If Tony didn’t know him so well, he might not have recognized him. He had overgrown hair that was beginning to look more dirty than blonde. And Tony couldn’t miss the newfound beard that was gracing Steve’s chin. But none of it really mattered, the differences were nominal and insignificant.
that gave this to Rhodey but he couldn’t deny that it might be able to replace the mind stone.
Steve must have read his thoughts because he winced, and looked away. His hands began to rub together in front of himself. “Don’t thank me for that.” He muttered under his breath, Tony barely picked up on the words.
“Where have you even been? The whole team has stopped by except for you.” Tony informed him, rubbing his aching jaw. The tension in his body was making his muscles stiff. He tried to relax himself but he found that he couldn’t. He wasn’t equipped to deal with this.
After a few minutes, Steve finally stepped away, eyes unreadable. Tony opened his mouth to say something but Steve was too faraway to hear him. He was somewhere where the road they had stepped on wasn't an option.
Conversations with Ross never went much further than that, and when Tony was greeted with silence he ended the call with an empty bottomless feeling. He turned his head and stared out the window where birds flew without a metal suit.
“There’s just a lot we haven’t really discussed that’s not exactly great to talk about over the phone.” Steve reasoned, and Tony remembered their silly war well enough to know exactly what Steve was talking about. Tony remembered it all too well. He just couldn’t bring himself to rehash it all, not with Steve here with him for the first time in 242 long days.
“I’m not mad.” Steve finally said after a few moments of silence, sounding almost completely genuine. Tony blinked in surprise but took the chance for what it was.
They were so close that Tony was dizzy with the feeling of it, and he had to force himself to break away for air. He could barely breath, barely even think but he needed more of this. More of Steve. Because maybe he had never seen it before, or simply ignored it, but he
Tony could feel Steve’s smile against his head and could feel his breath against his hair. Tony was content to just stay like this, surrounded by Steve’s warmth and overwhelming presence.
Once he was done, he lowered Tony’s foot but didn’t stand immediately. Tony was about to ask him why but then he was pulling something out of his pocket. Tony cocked his head to the side, befuddled. “You can’t propose twice, that’s against the rules I think. Plus we’re already married and I’m not divorcing you just to get married again. Unless you really want to do that, in which case I guess I’ll do it with you.”
"That’s what you came for, right? You can take it and you can leave. Or better yet, shove it up your star spangled ass.” Tony had imagined dealing with Steve with more poise than that.
“I know.” Tony responded dumbly, prying Steve’s hands away. “I couldn’t-”
“No reason. Oh wait, maybe because my husband decided he’d rather be a war criminal than spend time with me.” Tony laid his head down on his folded arms. “Give me the scotch back.”
“Just Steve is fine.” Steve answered, smiling at Happy. “How have you been?” Steve asked and Tony leaned his head against Steve’s shoulder, glancing out the window at the city. Tony thought of Steve’s shield sitting in his lab and felt a pinch from an old wound.
In hindsight, unwinding with the one person who has the distinct capability of winding you up, not a great plan. But Steve was sitting on a ratty blue couch that had somehow ended up in the sleek compound and seemed almost natural in it’s place.
Steve’s eyes flickered to the table for the first time then. "I don’t want it back.” Steve had eloquence and poise like he dealt with situations such as these every weekend. Tony wanted to throw the shield at his face. He figured it was a good thing he hadn’t kept it in his hands.
“I’m so sorry you thought that.” Steve looked genuinely like he was dying a little inside. Tony wanted to comfort him, and
“I know, but I haven’t exactly been helping with the subtlety.” Tony admitted as he sat down beside Steve to remove his skates. Steve was already done and he was watching Tony with a distinctive furrowed brow. Apparently Tony had missed even that.
Rhodey was huddled over Vision and Tony forced his feet to continue forward, even as they begin to feel less like skin and bone and more like lead. Vision was on the ground, his usually vibrant color looking drained. Tony didn’t recognize anything else as being wrong until he noticed the lack of the stone that usually sat on Vision’s forehead.
He was being towed along by Steve’s hands behind his back and they were moving far too fast. Tony closed his eyes, containing a girlish scream. It reminded Tony of flying in his suit, freeing and liberating in its own right. Tony hadn’t felt this light in months.
“I nearly stabbed you with the blade on my skates.” Tony let Steve know, shaking his head at how ridiculous that sounded. And Steve looked down at the ground as if remembering the skates and their whole plan.
“No way, you are benched until-” Tony put a hand to his chin, pursing his lips. “How’s 2025 sound?”
“Steve?” The drink slipped from his fingers but Steve caught it, releasing Tony to do so, and placed it on the counter.
“I can tell him to get lost. Him and his new beard.” Rhodey informed him with firm and unbreakable devotion that Tony appreciated more than anything in that very moment. Tony thought of the burner sitting in his jacket pocket, he thought of the crumpled letter sitting in his waste basket for umpteenth time, he thought of a shield sitting somewhere in storage where he had tossed it.
Everything about the way Steve looked at him, so unlike he ever had before. It was surreal to say the least. His attention was so solely focused on him that it alone could steal his breath away.
Natasha shrugged with just one shoulder, lifting and dropping it in a subtle movement. “Vision did wake up and then he flew away. We aren’t sure about his memories or anything like that, but he is alive. Or as alive as an android can be.” Tony opened his mouth to ask about Wanda but Natasha was already a step ahead of him. She usually was. “Wanda went after him, we are hoping she can bring him back and calm him down. It’s the only reason you didn’t get an even bigger lecture.”
He bent to pick it up and whirled to face Steve, tossing it onto the table. The clang it sent through the room bounced off the walls. Tony watched Steve for a reaction, not sure what he was expecting but a blank gaze definitely wasn’t it.
“Will you kick me if I apologize?” Steve asked him, eyebrows lifting just a tad.
“This is
Tony noticed Steve had left his jacket. He sighed and looked out over the skyline. Steve's sketchbook was a reassuring weight near his heart.
“About that…” Tony rubbed his hands together, feeling dread build in his stomach. He had completely forgotten to mention this to Steve, but after everything that had happened, it hadn’t seemed too important. “We are technically broken up.”
He was surprised he remembered as much since it was probable that he had a concussion. He did feel oddly mellow, if that was anything, and maybe he was a bit distracted.
Tony brought his hand up to touch the gash, hissing between his teeth. He dropped his hand. He had a strange feeling that he had already tried to touch his injury and had gotten the same results. “I-It’s fine. Cap was...worried?” That didn’t make any logical sense.
Tony tapped his pen against
“You’re a safety hazard.” Steve said, pushing himself to stand. Tony frowned, opening his mouth to protest. He wanted Steve and nos he was hot and bothered and incredibly impatient. Before he could get a word out, Steve pulled him up by his forearms.
“You can and you will for the sake of something bigger than the lot of you. Everyone I bring in is fighting on your side and that’s enough.” Fury sighed, and Tony thought he seemed a little older. A little wearier.
“Yeah, exactly like that.” Tony felt a smile creep up on him, even though he knew he should be terrified, and he turned his head towards Fury. “That’s a sci-fi geek's dream.”
“I don’t doubt that.” Steve murmured and his voice was low and suddenly very close to his ear. Tony knew that was playing dirty and he wasn’t going to last if they played that game.
After a particularly sharp bite and messy kiss, Tony tugged at Steve’s hair, lifting his head and reclaiming his lips. Tony attempted to wrap his legs around Steve but remembered the skates on his feet. He pulled away from Steve with a laugh.
“I didn’t think you’d come.” Tony breathed, wrapping his arms around Steve’s neck and holding tight once they were away from prying eyes. He closed his eyes, he couldn’t even begin to put into words how much he had missed Steve’s presence. The steady beating of his heart was a comfort Tony hadn't been aware he was seeking. Tony would have dismissed the whole situation as a fantasy if it weren't for Steve solid and real beneath his fingertips.
, that is not surprising at all. Glad to know some things never change.”
Tony brought up his thumb to wipe at what Steve knew was a smudge of paint. Tony always told him he had a tendency to wipe his brow when he was in work-mode. “There, all better. Should I mention that there is paint all over your shirt?” His thumb lingered, stroking his skin and making it tingle pleasantly, before falling away.
Tony must have picked up on it. “I think you forget that I have grown as a person.” At Steve’s dubious look he changed his statement. “I think you forget that I have unlimited amounts of coffee at my disposal.”
a party going on. I was sent to go grab some pretzels by Sam, who I don’t think likes me all that much.” Peter shrugged, smiling at Tony one more time before walking off. Tony watched him go with raised eyebrows before shaking his head and entering the room.
Rhodey squinted at him. “I don’t think you know the story behind Rumpelstiltskin and you were the one who put all that encryption stuff on my phone. What'd you think I was going to do?” He shook his head, finally getting the scotch out of Tony’s reach. “Why are you being so sappy today anyway?”
“Still bossy, even in bed.” Tony shrugged off his jacket. He tugged his shirt over his head which sent his hair falling into his eyes. He pushed the uncooperative strands away, wondering when he got a haircut last.
The rest of it was a blur of moving limbs. At times hot and heavy while at others sweet and slow. Tony catalogued all that he could in the time that was slipping past his fingers. This was all he would probably ever have, and he wanted to remember every single detail.
It was a shame that good things never lasted.
They stood like that for another few minutes, neither of them willing to move closer or further away. There was a calmness that was waiting for interruption.
"I don't know how long I can be patient." Tony tore his gaze away from Steve, forcing himself to look at the skyline presented before him. He curled his fingers in the pockets of Steve's jacket. He almost lost sight of what they were talking about for a brief moment.
He walked up to Peter and glanced around curiously when he heard some commotion in the other room. He pocketed his glasses, letting his facade fall for the first time that day. “Is it your birthday? I was pretty sure I had it circled on the cat calendar Rhodey gave me when I kept forgetting his.”
Happy snorted at that. "I’ll do my best, boss.” They exchanged goodbyes and Happy went on his way. Tony felt oddly adrift.
“I’m doing all of this for you. You have to know that.” Tony stopped walking and cupped Steve’s cheek, turning Steve’s head towards himself. “So that we never have to go this long without seeing each other again. So I can fix the Accords. And once I pull all that off, which with my genius I undoubtedly will-” Tony broke off, breathless. “I’ll tell the whole world we are married.”
“It’s not the same.” Tony murmured, and he thought of how Steve had mentioned he was leaving by morning. They were on borrowed time, and that made his stomach turn unpleasantly. “How can I convince you to stay?”
Steve approached the kitchen and he frowned when he saw that the lights were already on. The first thing he noticed was the body slumped against the counter. His eyes widened and his body grew taut before he recognized the brown mess of hair as Tony’s. His posture slackened, and a small breath fell from his lips.
“I’m not letting you drown your sorrows in a bottle, alright? What can I do to cheer you up?” Rhodey asked and Tony knew he meant well but he just wanted Steve sitting beside him, laughing and lighting up the room with his smile. Always effortless, never quite aware.
“Well?” The sharpness in his voice surprised even himself. His hands gestured artlessly towards the table and the shield sitting on top of it, still supporting claw marks from an angry king.
Natasha looked at the gem over Tony’s shoulder, looking every bit as distrustful as Tony felt. “What was this creature?” She asked Rhodey, sounding annoyed that she couldn’t remember anything. Tony just stared at the jewel, wondering if it could work. Because there was no way he trusted the
“Why are you assuming that’s me?” Tony asked, standing up and patting Rhodey’s back. He tried to contain a smile, he didn’t want to seem too happy.
Tony really wished Ross would explain it to him, because he felt like the puzzle was missing a piece from the set. “Then how does it work?”
“It’s a mystery to us all but we have really got to stop talking about Ross, it’s leaving a bad taste in my mouth.” Tony said, peering around Steve to get a good look at the rink.
“Of course you deserve it! You’re honestly denser than a neutron star. I told you to drop it because I was hurt and I was mad and I was trying to get you to feel just a sliver of what I was feeling.” Tony’s arm was growing tired, and his mood was deteriorating, as it usually did when Steve felt the need to argue.
A month of meeting other superheroes they had no idea existed and dividing their time between space and Earth. With global destruction at hand, the Accords were the last thing on anyone's mind.
Tony thought they were still broken, but he also thought maybe they were getting somewhere.
“Well I think Barton is a dick!” Rhodey called as he came over, some sort of skates in his shoes allowing him to glide over the floor.” Ouch, that looks painful.”
“I don’t know! Okay? Things are just a mess.” Tony wanted to tear all of his hair out. “But the team, for the team. Party sound’s good.”
“Would you rather I let you die? He was going to go after you.” Tony shook his head, looking at where the stone used to rest inside what they had hoped to be a nearly impenetrable case. The case was broken around their feet now.
“Yeah, get the whole team together.” Steve shrugged, a small twitch of his shoulders. He seemed tentative.
Steve shook his head and stared at Tony who was fast asleep with his arms pillowing his head. Steve knew the position was going to result in an aching back but he also knew it was hard to get Tony to sleep in the first place. Steve was going to have to take his chances.
“Yeah, yeah I think we are.” Steve walked away and Tony watched him leave, not missing the irony of the situation. He was pretty sure he had just ruined their temporary peace treaty while trying to vouch for it.
“Well, you know what Clint, I don’t need to beat you at Mario Kart.” Tony crossed his arms over his chest, always childish when it came to losing in video games.
Once he had stopped her to get out an apology. "I never wanted you imprisoned. I never wanted that for any of you. And I shouldn’t have treated you like a child, I understand that now, but I was trying to keep you from something worse. And I never expected worse to be the Raft.” Tony had shrugged awkwardly. “I’m sorry.”
The first week after Vision lost his stone, everyone was on high alert, and yet nothing happened. They conferred in the compound, trying to figure out what was going on.
“You know, I was thinking of throwing a party.” Steve offered out of the air, like they were negotiating peace and parties were the deciding factor.
