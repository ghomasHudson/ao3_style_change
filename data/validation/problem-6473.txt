Wanda throws her arms around him in a hug, feeling her heart overflow. She knows right them that she has the best Papa in the world and that she is luckier than any other little girl ever.
“Wait.” She says immediately. It is much more fun with him, and she does not want him to feel left out. “‘Cause then we can splash and do mermaids and stuff. And go under the water. But not, because it’s scary.” She is rambling now. “Papa, gotta question.”
Wanda is not usually as loud and pushy as she is right now, but the stress of being sick and having her temperature taken, being given medicine and now being not allowed to go to daycare have wound her up tight.
Peter likes nice dreams. He examines the mask and nods, feeling a little more comfortable that he gets to see it.
“We’re gonna fix your arm, yeah, and then we’ll put a cast on it. It’s super hard and you can pick which colour you want it to be. What’s your favourite colour?” Peter hardly needs to consider his options before he answers.
“Can you take a bath when this episode is over?” That seems like a good compromise. “I’ll let you finish watching, but no arguments after. Understand?” He makes his voice a little firmer on that last bit. He turns and kisses Wanda's forehead. “And no arguments from you either, little miss. Be a good girl.”
Extra TV time is always special, so despite his anger and upset, Peter nods and heads to the sofa. He plops down and waits expectantly for his Papa to put on one of the Disney channels. From upstairs, Tony calls out.
“Your prince, huh? What is your prince Charming like?” Tony asks with a chuckle and brings Wanda with him downstairs. He then sets the girl on her seat by the kitchen island before beginning to gather the supplies for the pancakes.
“Stop...” The blonde grumbles with a huff, but when Tony tells him that Wanda is sick, he sits up in an instant, all wide awake. Wanda nods, trying to sit up a little straighter, but finds herself too weak to do anything, but lay in Tony's arms.
“I know, but this’ll make you feel better. Come on.” Steve picks her up. “Maybe it’s time for a bath.”
“No need it... Big boy.” Peter mumbles a little sadly. He is not really arguing, but more so upset over not being like his big sister and cuddles up to Steve. “No diapey, please...” He mumbles, hoping that his manners will get him what he wants, even though this is how it always is anyway.
“How about we let the little man rest, yeah? Right, doctor?” Steve asks Stephen. Wanda frowns and taps on Steve's shoulder.
Wanda shuts her eyes tight and wriggles her hips a little bit. She tries to think of what she can pretend that might make this easier.
“He hit his head and broke his arm. They observed him overnight for any complications and he went into surgery early this morning.” Tony explains. “It’s the concussion I’m worried about the most, honestly. I know how to take care of a Little with a hurt arm, but head injuries can be…. Unpredictable, I guess. I’ve just been so damn worried.” He pauses to rub his forehead. “He was being so brave, but I know he was scared.”
“You look sleepy, Petey. You ready for a nap?” Stephen asks, rubbing at Peter’s cheeks to provide some comfort.
“Oh, God… I’d better call our babysitter and see if he can keep our girl for another night. I just… I can't leave him right now.” Steve turns to look at Peter and even if the boy looks content in the moment, Steve still feels his heart break a little bit. He needs him.
“Yeah, yeah. Text me once Peter’s awake and let me know how it went.” Vis says and reaches over to brush Wanda’s hair back. “Love you too, pumpkin. I’ll see you soon, yeah? Bye now.” He says and heads off with a smile and wave.
Stephen is not Peter’s Daddy, but being a bit removed from the situation helps him to see what is going on a bit more clearly. The doctor has dealt with tons of sick Littles and everything that comes with them—including attention starved Little siblings.
“Hey, Wanda, we’re not done! Back in the tub, now.” Tony says, just a bit annoyed that Wanda decided to get out on her own instead of wait to be helped out like always. “I still have to rinse your hair and wash your body.” He argues. Wanda crosses her arms, wanting to argue, but finally decides it is not worth it. She gets back in telling him firmly.
“Did you try to help him?” Steve fills in, knowing Wanda is an eager helper. Although, she always does not do the right thing, but both Steve and Tony know that she has got a heart of gold and her intensions are pure. “That’s very sweet of you, babe, but Peter needs the sling and neither of you are allowed to take it off, all right? It helps take the weight off his arm so he can rest and heal.”
“Is not owie... Is okay.” Peter explains, gesturing to his arm, but that is only due to the painkillers. “Don’t wanna be- here.”
“He fell off the monkey bars.” Steve informs. “I know the arm is the most obvious thing, but he also hit his head and blacked out. I'm really worried about that.”
“Shhh, sweetheart. It’s okay, you’re okay. We’re gonna go home as soon as Stephen says you can. He just wants you to feel all better. How about we read some stories? Does that sound okay, honey?”
“For now, but I wouldn't be surprised if we get a little middle of the night wake up call.” Steve says, smiling. “We'll have to try to be quiet. I think someone else needs to get to bed too.”
“He’s doing well and he seems alert, so I think we can bring him back to his room. I'm still going to be keeping a close eye on him, though.” Stephen says to the two Daddies before turning back to Peter. “I know that you're a little uncomfortable right now, sweetheart. You're gonna feel better soon, I promise. Thomas, you want to help me take him back?”
“I think we can ask Stephen to come look at you again in a few days, just to be sure you’re getting better. And you can of course lay on my lap, baby.” Tony assures with a smile and points Wanda over to the hand towel next to the sink. “Dry your hands, sweets.” He reminds. “Did you know that last time Stephen was here he also checked Peter’s temperature in his bum? He was super brave about it.” Tony says, hoping that it can motivate Wanda to be braver next time.
Peter looks at Tony with a pout, then gives Thomas a stare and decides that he does not want to speak to the nurse and cuddles Pooh instead. The nurse is hardly offended and laughs lightly.
“Pooh, Papa.” Peter says and squirms out of his Papa’s arms. Steve sets the boy down and lets him fetch his stuffie.
“Okay, let’s move over here now. Can you hold onto your owie arm, Peter?” Stephen says, demonstrating how he wants Peter to hold his injured arm to his chest. Peter holds his arm to his chest, but cries out in pain when he moves it. Even though it was stabilised, it still hurts.
“Some ups and downs as usually, but she’s slowly getting better I think.” Tony reports, stretching out a bit before letting out a huff. “And that would be great, yeah. But, we could make dinner together now, if you want? Did you pick up some groceries?” Tony asks and heads to the kitchen. With the TV on the Littles will be entertained, so Tony is not too worried about going to the room next door.
“You’ve been so good for me, baby!” Tony exclaims a little, a bit baffled over why Wanda thinks she is being bad when she has not been scolded once, not even put in the corner once since getting sick. It has all just been corrections and warnings with a firmer tone of voice. “And of course we’ll love you no matter what, silly girl.” He adds, bouncing his knees as he embraces the girl and kisses her forehead again.
“Wan’a come.” He points out and points to the door. Wanda seems better already and they played a lot yesterday, so why is not she coming to daycare too?
“Yeah, that sounds really good. Stephen probably has some suggestions for us as well, since he does this all day.” Tony chuckles a little, then sighs and sinks down in the chair he is sat in. “I’m just so glad he is all right.” He adds quietly.
“One!” Peter says, holding up one finger, then puts up a second one with a proud glee on his face. “Two! Uh- Three and four!” Peter counts out, lifting a finger to show each number. “Papa got two legs.” The boy points out next, looking up at Steve to be sure he got it right. Steve beams with pride and gives Peter a kiss.
“Not yet, kitten princess, just another moment.” Tony says gently, picking up on the pet name that Wanda wants in an instant. With two demanding Littles in the house, both Tony and Steve have perfected the skill of remembering and learning things that interest their Littles in seconds. He strokes the girl’s hair till the thermometer beeps, then pulls it out carefully and inspects the measurement. “It’s a bit too high than what Daddy likes, but we have medicine for that kitten.”
“Wanda, it’s not a punishment.” Steve sighs. “It’s to help you. Now lie back down and try to be still. If we don’t know how sick you are we won’t know how to get you better so you can play with Peter.”
Wanda yelps and squirms, trying to get away from the thermometer. It is so uncomfortable that she almost thinks of it as a punishment. To try and bargain she suggests with a small voice.
“Good idea. Look, sweetie.” Steve takes Peter’s hand and squeezes very gently. “Papa’s right here. Just focus on me for now, all right? You’re okay, baby.”
“New toy?” Peter perks up. The best thing in the whole world is when they go to the toy store and he and Wanda get to pick out a toy each. Coming over with more medication, Stephen sets up the IV bags and injects something into the bag.
“I did, and that sounds good. Chop an onion for me, will ya? I’ll make something edible while they’re occupied. God, I’m so glad that she didn’t go today. We’d be in the ER right now. There was so much activity. And Peter’s definitely going to be tired tonight. We’d better start getting ready for that now...” He seems almost absentminded as he talks about the day. “You know, I almost feel like we should get a babysitter one of these nights and go out for some time alone.”
“Okay, here we go, buddy.” Stephen says, wheeling the bed in. Peter jerks around, suddenly worrying.
“Peter.” Steve kneels down next to the boy and touches his cheek. “Sweetie, can you talk to Papa one second? I promise that after your bath you can have dinner and watch your show. Come on, baby boy.” He speaks coaxingly. “I know you want to watch the puppies.”
“We know you are, princess, and having your temp taken in your bottom doesn’t make you any less of a big girl. We’re doing this so we can make you feel better in a bit.” Tony explains for perhaps the tenth time, as Wanda always brings up this argument when her temperature is being taken. The girl is convinced that it is all a punishment no matter what the Daddies say to prove otherwise. Finally, the thermometer beeps, but Tony doubts that it is the most accurate measurement considering how much Wanda was moving. Still, the measurement is higher than it was the day before. “Should we call the d-o-c?” Tony asks Steve quietly while rubbing a comforting hand on Wanda’s back.
“You two heading to bed now? I'll be there in a little while.” Steve says where he is sat by Peter’s bedside, stroking his hair while he suckles on a pacifier lazily, already practically in dreamland.
“Yeah, they know and they are here to help you.” Thomas says and goes around lowering the rails on the bed so that they can lift Peter onto the procedure table. “We all make magic happen here.” He adds in a whisper and a wink to Peter.
“I can be your knight and your prince, angel.” Steve assures the baby. “So I can keep you safe and help you run the magic kingdom. How does that sound?”
“Oh, what do we have here? Is that a magic wand?” He asks, putting a hand on the girl’s shoulder to guide her back downstairs. Dinner will be ready soon most likely.
“Papa...” He whimpers, kicking his legs a little under the blanket. A moment later, both Stephen and Thomas enter the room with easy going smiles on their faces.
Wanda does not seem quite so convinced and throws her hand back to cover her bottom as soon as the thermometer is out, and huffs.
“Hmm!” Peter nods around the spoonful that Tony is feeding him. The boy usually loves bath time, but with the cast it has become a bit tricky and less exciting. His Daddies put a plastic cover on his arm every time and he cannot put it into the water still, which sucks. But, he can still splash and play with the other hand and he can kick his feet too, even though his Daddies do not like it when he does that.
Meanwhile, Peter has made his way half through his portion and is now having some of his milk. Tony helps him out by holding the bottle for him.
“Had an accident. I didn’t mean to.” Sometimes it just happens and she does not quite know what to do about it.
“I know, Daddy.” Wanda says, muffled with her thumb in her mouth. “But, I get scared. And I love you so much I think about it all the time and I’m just so happy you love me too. And Peter. Isn’t he the best brother, Daddy? I’m so glad you love me.” She rests her head on his shoulder. “Can we play?”
Okay, fair enough, Peter thinks. He feels more at ease now knowing his sister is close by and what she is up to. But, what about Papa? He pulls back from the bottle to speak.
“I know, I know, but we can’t fall asleep just yet, okay? Try and stay awake for me for a bit longer.” Stephen coaxes and continues to rub at Peter’s cheek to try and keep him more or less alert.
“Good job, Peter!” Tony praises him rubbing circles on his back in slow, soothing motions. “Thank you for being so good. We’re really proud of you.”
“Oh, darling, that’s not true.” Stephen chuckles, placing a hand on Wanda’s arm and squeezing reassuringly. “Even princesses get icky now and then and that doesn’t mean they stop being a princess.” He argues, but he knows there is not that much point in explaining more when Wanda is so out of it and just babbling. “You just rest and your Daddy will be back in a flash. He told me that you’ve been super brave and taking your meds every day.” The doctor praises.
“All right. I’ll be on call all night, so just head down the hall to find me or another nurse at the station. Bye, Peter!” The nurse says before heading out. Peter waves at him.
“You’re right. We need to chill out.” Tony says, taking a deep breath. He thinks to figure out how to talk to Peter about this and reminds himself to stay calm. “Deep breaths.”
Peter nods at the promise of popsicles. He has been getting a couple a day while he has been recovering from the surgery since he has lost some of his appetite since it. Besides, they are treats so Peter will see how far he can push it and get them daily. At the mention of colouring, Peter suddenly remembers something.
Tony laughed out loud. Of course that was the moment Steve and Natasha walked into the kitchen. Natasha arched an eyebrow in question at him. Steve just smiled in greeting and Tony could scent a hint of arousal on him to go with the aura of fondness bleeding off his thoughts at finding Tony looking bright eyed with color in his cheeks laughing apparently at nothing.
“It can’t just be Natasha.” Steve insisted stubbornly, as if he was defending her against the teams scrutiny. “I have them too and we’re not… we’re not as close as you and Clint.”
"I'm about to offer you the throne. So to speak. What Daddy didn't think you had the unfortunately literal balls to run, I'm prepared to hand you." Tony answered taking another sip of his whisky. A purr of satisfaction rumbled in his throat as the smooth liquor went down. He did love a good whisky. That and having a business rival dangling right where he wanted them.
"It doesn't look like much but it's a plasma weapon, which is pretty astounding all on its own right?” Tony said, eagerly extending the small silver disk. “But the real wonder of this bad boy is the highly advanced thought recognition software that is running it-"
Thor very much doubted Tony had. He did not think the Benu had ever journeyed to Midgard but all things were possible.
“Jaime was fine. It’s just hard on the kits when their parents are away for long periods” they try and verbally sooth Steve.
Steve's not true gata whatever he smells like. And fine, he smells great. Wild and strong and not a hint of sourness to be found.
“You always have to be the victim don’t you Tony?  You can’t even admit to yourself that it might have been real for me, that I wanted the best for both of us; but you decided I just wasn’t good enough for the great Tony Stark. That’s why you went behind my back and made those blockers.”
“It’s an interesting proposition, but this team you’re offering. Helen only works with Gata.” Tony explained flatly. He was intrigued by what T’Challa was proposing, to put it mildly (because, are you kidding! Collaborating with the leading minds in Wakanda might have literally been a wet dream of his) but in the game of negotiation the trick was to lay your groundwork early.
A/N: You might have seen already but I've started a companion piece to this story for those who are concerned about the ending and want a few assurances that this isn't all going to end in bloody heartbreak once we get to Civil War. You can find that
Someone rapped on the window closest to Pepper and Tony smiled when he looked to see that it was Rhodey, in full uniform and looking very serious about the whole affair as he opened the back door for her.
“Yeah you’d look terrible in ‘em.” Steve said in a way that made it clear this was bullshit, and Natasha just smiled in response. This slow terribly fond expression that Tony couldn’t say he’d ever been on the other end of. Don’t get it wrong. The woman was willing to die for him and they are bonded, so it’s hard for even Tony’s low self-esteem to construe somehow that she’s not fond of him too, if for different reasons and expressed in entirely different ways.
So anyway, they spend time together. It’s too early for Tony to have missed any important dates and Steve hasn’t taken him up on any of the numerous invitations he’s offered to screw like rabbits in his extremely comfortable pent-house, so Steve can’t exactly be disappointed with their sex life either.
The blow was sharp and painful, the tom-kats claws digging through Steve’s uniform to scratch the vulnerable skin and Steve staggered back. He hadn’t broken skin though so the match was still on.
Natasha was infected and for people like her love was always terminal. The bottle would disagree with her one day, but before then there was work to be done and apples. Always apples.
"Natasha?" He prodded and she blinked, chastising herself for losing track of the conversation like that. She was getting sloppier and sloppier these days.
Tony jerks away, and his chest explodes with pain. The room dims, once more swallowed by fog and he’s falling again, the knives slicing at him and fists beating at his body. He lets it happen. Pulls further away.
"Remind me why we're doing this again?" Clint hissed under his breath as Thor led them up the gangplank but either it wasn't quiet enough or Kǫtrdýr hearing was even better than Gata's because four pairs of furred heads turned sharply toward them and suddenly there were four menacing looking tom's in full armor standing between them and the royals standing at the edge of the Skiff.
His harsh tone makes tears well up in their eyes and (she) feels disgust for the pathetic thing they used to be. So fragile.
Alarm shot through her at his unexpected appearance, her thoughts immediately going to Tony and wondering what had gone wrong with the plan. Maybe Killian had canceled and Tony had tried to warn her, but with her coms out it's not like she would know.
"I dragged you guys up there with me," Tony felt the need to point out, because it was the truth. He was the one with a deadly virus taking over his body, the others shouldn't have had to suffer just because his life was once again in shambles.
Bruce, no dull knife, seemed to have guessed where Tony was going and slowly began to shake his head.
Tony turned his head to look at Natasha over Steve’s shoulder, because the promise he’d made was as much for her (and for him) as it was for Steve.
There had been a big hub-bub about a group of mercenaries who'd gotten into some hot water trying to invade a country that previously only a very small list of people had been aware. Tony remembered it so well because it had been the winter before Afghanistan and the footage that had leaked of some of the technology coming out of that jungle was so unbelievable he still hadn't forgiven Pepper for canceling his order for a jet.
One side of the room is made up of one giant wide window and they are high enough to see where the grey-blue of the ocean meets the sky for miles and miles.
"I call it the Expulse Tracker," Tony explained, something in his voice tight despite his outwardly relaxed posture. "It should work even if they've got a signal jammer. It's like a sleeper cell, see, it adapts to the jamming signal and manipulates it, dropping a series of notes on an alternate frequency. JARVIS can detect the alterations and use them to pin your location."
Tony laughed. Ignoring Fury entirely he turned to Steve and that frustrated expression of his, underlayed with that token earnestness that Tony found ten times more frustrating than Steve would likely ever understand (the one that said he wanted to understand, he wanted to help, if only Tony would be more reasonable) and jerked his head toward Fury.
"I don’t like that he’s keeping the team in the dark." Steve insisted lowly, anxiety twisting in his stomach as the implications of what he was seeing in all those fancy displays slowly sank in. He wasn't a brain like Tony but he wasn't just a pretty face ether and he could see what was behind the bones of this and the risk was high. Maybe too high.
At the sound of the familiar chime from his phone Clint fished the device out of his pocket and smiled down at the latest alert. He scrolled through the usual responses from fans and lonely kittens fantasizing about snagging an Avenger for a mate, and had to smile at those who were bold enough to claim outright they were just looking for a stud. The grin widened when he saw that the team had seen the pictures he’d posted of himself with the guys from the construction crew, but it damn near cracked his face when he saw that T’Challa had responded. The other toms Yowler profile had been silent since his identity had been discovered and Clint hadn’t expected him to go back to using it.
Tony noticed with some relief that Natasha was bounding up the escalator, coming toward them from the opposite side. The officers looked up as Tony soared above their heads, landing solidly between them and the kit in the silver suit huddling behind the cart with the whimpering teenage girl. Fury bloomed in Tony’s stomach anew at the sight of them.
“Queensgaurd? Not sure I know what you mean, Thor’s just a very large, very good friend.” Tony winked at the Asgardian Prince who beamed back at him. Gesturing toward Steve at his side, Tony introduced him as team captain before moving on to introduce the others. It was all bullshit for the cameras of course but everybody put up with it.
He knew what he wanted he thought, staring dully at the chrome doors as the lift took him upward. He knew deep down in the fearful dark that he didn’t much want to delve into, but part of him felt incredibly guilty for wanting it as bad as he did. Not to mention doubtful. What if this was just him being soft, same old Tony. So desperate for a little affection he couldn’t even see when someone was stealing from him, or plotting his death, until they were leaning over him ripping his heart out.
“It’s still that way in Wakanda isn’t it? You’ve got the kat-gene so I take it the Queen has a sweet touch.”
They were so different from one another, too different maybe, and Cap was bound to realize sooner or later Tony would never be as good a person as he wanted to be and then what?
“That’s the promise I made her when I stole her away from her former employer. If you send me humans, American law dictates who receives credit and who receives patents. A full Gata team is non-negotiable.”
“I won’t argue your classification of renegade, Captain, but you can be sure that they are not from my country.”
"His tech is good so it's going to take me a bit of effort, but I'd say within twenty-four hours I 0should have a clear data sample for JARVIS to run through the search. I should be able to find not just him but his closest living relative if they've ever used a cell phone or spoken near some other digital recording device. You know Uncle Sam records everything right? That's why I only ever use a phone I've made." Tony finished with a shrug.
They deserved to find a little happiness after everything didn't they? They deserved to be sure. And Tony wasn't at all sure that when Steve kissed him he wasn't seeing those flashing blue eyes he'd witnessed so briefly in his memories.
Before turning to make his way toward Pepper, leaving Tony alone with T’Challa. Which meant it was back in the ring. Game face on.
The desert. The forest. A street in Brooklyn. A table in a sparse kitchen, with a strange woman washing a dish at the sink.
Luke paused, uncertain he had heard correctly. He wasn't the only one surprised at the suggestion. Tony was rather surprised himself that he'd made it.
The kat in the silver suit just barely dodged his fire but he was unable to catch his shield; which rather than spin off into the wall as Tony had anticipated, inexplicably shut off its lasers and receded its spokes back into the hub.
Tony had wanted to find the linguistic equivalent of a blow torch and scorch those words (and all the innuendo behind them) out of existence, especially when he’d seen the look on Steve’s face.
"And made an ass out of both of us.” Tony poked him in the arm and Steve knew he wasn’t serious. “Guy is definitely a fel. Probably into you too. I would be."
"We should head out. I want to make it down to the yard early and see what progress they've made on the torpedo. I won't outfit the new submarine with anything else, not with how well she's sold. I suppose this means Obadiah is right and we'll have to widen our market."
Jaime for his part didn’t acknowledge that she was shuddering against him like the biggest of babies, probably smelling a week past her expiration date with the world’s worst rats nest for hair. He just held her close.
"Different?" Natasha asked warily, pausing to look between him and Tony as Tony heaved a heavy sigh.
Steve looked away from the heights to him and the distance was so minute; Tony could feel crackling electricity everywhere. Every atom sizzled and begged to be closer, but he blinked the haze out of his eyes. Steve looked so open and honest; it couldn’t happen, though. Tony inched away, only a little. However, Steve noticed and whatever had started was now over. The tension in his shoulders loosened, and every other part of him tightened in misery.
Tony hummed noncommittally, and nothing but little sniffles filled the room for a long while after that.
The grass was cut short, save for around the oak tree, and had dry patches scattered about the open land. They had one hundred acres in the middle of Indiana to fuck around on without any press. Birds chatted in the trees as the sun set over the horizon. Reds, oranges, and yellows gave into dark blues and purples as the center of the universe disappeared into the grass blades. Frogs croaked in the pond by the house, and the leaves rustled in the air.
“Abso-fuckin’-lutely not,” Tony chuckled, “they’re gonna eat what we wanna eat. If they have any problems, they can take it up their asses.”
“They also have laws against murder, and no one cares about those.” was what he got in lieu of an actual response.
Steve obeyed, and Tony slammed back down onto his bed with a put out grumble. He gently closed the door and pulled his phone out.
Steve watched the two bicker back and forth, not knowing who the lady was. Freckles rained on her nose and cheekbones, contrasting to her emerald green eyes. She was abnormally tall, even in black flats. Her smile had dimples and her eyes creased in the corners when she grinned, which she was doing a lot of in spite of her antagonizing words. Tony was also beaming. His teeth sat in a straight line and were pristinely clean, even though the man drank coffee like water. His chin rested in his right hand that was propped up on the table as he looked to his companion.
“It’s a raccoon, Princess,” Natasha replied as she walked behind him. Tony yelped and leaped backwards into a giggling Steve.
By month four, Bucky was adapted and Steve was beaming every second of the day. Rogers painted for Barnes, he went shopping with Bucky, and he took him to outings with the team; it was amazing. Nothing was unordinary when Bucky waved his hand for Clint at the dining table.
“Buck and I used to lie on the roof of our apartment complex and try to spot constellations through the smog,” he huffed with a smile, “it was damn near impossible.”
Clint Barton was a piping hot mess of a person. Nine out of ten fights his hearing aids broke; they snapped, crackled, and popped. Tony has given Clint every 584 pairs very begrudgingly with a “Motherfuck you, fuckin’ Dumb and Dumber. Good God.”
Steve rolled his eyes into the back of his head at that and started speaking to Bucky. (Probably explaining Clint being deaf.)
“Do we have to walk back,” Tony whined as he signed the check. He’d gotten to it first, but Tony snatched it out of his hands and giggled.
Too soon or too late, the back of the van opened and things were haphazardly tossed inside. After it was completed, Steve thrust his door opened and he haughtily strapped his seatbelt, slamming the door shut. Every rash movement made Tony flinch and startle, but it was ignored in favor of angrily driving down country roads.
Tony smiled sadly as he saw his mother leave his childhood home without as much as a goodbye. She didn’t even bother to take him with her.
Tony moaned exasperatedly and whimpered. The short commute back home was filled with mostly that, but Steve found that he didn’t mind. The cacophonous musical of New York: now complete with honking horns and Tony Stark lamenting over every little thing. Ten bucks a pop.
On instinct he tried to follow her, but she had already disappeared into the crowds. He then eyed Tony, menacingly.
Steve huffed a humorless laugh and Tony felt his chest tighten. The arc reactor dug sharply into his heart and lungs momentarily as he steeled himself.
“Do you even know where we’re going,” he turned to the other, who smiled and looked into his rear view.
They each started out freshman year of college in the same semester, but Steve was six months older, and about three times bigger. Tony had already claimed a room with a king mattress with a headboard, the maxi closet, and a jumbo touch screen television hooked onto the wall. Another guy who was about Steve’s size was swiping through his phone on the bed, while a brunette was sitting on the hardwood floor amongst gadgets and gizmos a plenty. Without looking up, the one on the bed said, “Tones, your roomie is here.”
Steven!”) radiating warmth through the several blankets. New York usually didn’t get cold until December, but Tony had insisted they bring every cover and sheet and rag from the dorm to the couch. They’d have to clean it all up, which would be a pain, but Steve didn’t seem to care. His chin rested on the brunette’s shoulder and his arms wrapped around himself, all propped up by a pillow by the arm of the couch.
, he realized. He secondly noted that his mouth tasted like ass and that he has a killer headache. He got up on his elbows and looked around. His television was still on the wall, and there weren’t any strangers in his bed, so all in all it was a great night.
“Hey, I’ll give you twenty dollars to go away,” Tony barked out. Steve bit back a smile. But based on Stark’s questioning glance, he wasn’t doing too well at hiding it.
The group was still for what seemed like hours until Tony stood up hastily. Thor gently tugged at Stark’s pajama leg but was shrugged off.
Steve hung his head to the side as he looked at Tony through his eyelashes. His face had neutralized, but his mouth still threatened to grin.
“I’m a little busy transforming the tech industry, okay? The only reason I’m here is because Rhodey forced me to. Don’t come to my room unless like, Yellowstone erupts, ‘k?”
Stark was standing in the hallway in front of them with no shirt on and confusion melding his face. His stomach was carved into six lean muscles with contouring lines from his hips that ran below his waistline. His arms were simply gorgeous and his tan put Steve’s to shame.
Tony was now jumping on his feet in an attempt to reach the newly deemed Wraw. This was too good to pass up.
Steve simply raised his brow, dropped the handshake and stomped toward Tony, who backed up step by step. The smug smirk never left his face.
“It’s the middle of the night and I have an Early Morning tomorrow. Cut the loud as shit bull you’re doing in here, or leave,” Steve ordered. Tony smiled mischievously before picking up a different Something Tool that screeched as a wheel spun on its axis. Steve covered his ears and briefly pondered how Tony seemed unbothered by the noise before unplugging the tool.
“Me. Pep wasn’t lying when she said I keep weird company. She watches from a distance, and when I’m lucky, she’ll stop by and chill out.”
“Yeah. It’s fun. I asked Tony to make the buds incognito for missions, but we all know that I just fuck with everyone. Well, everyone but you.”
But it’s been a year now and the team is tired of those twats. They’ve all told the two how the other feels, but both of them deny anything with longing smiles and a closed door. And then SHIELD collapsed.
Tony was standing in front of a shirtless Steve on top of Bucky on the main couch. Clint tripped next to Tony and tried to tug him away. When that failed, he cleared his throat. The two men stopped abruptly. And good God had they fucking started. Steve could get hickies? That was possible?
“You let me sign at you for three minutes, and made fun of me, and threatened the safety of my ass? For three minutes?”
A/N I recently recovered the hard drive with a bunch of my old works on it and got inspired by rereading my notes on this story. I have no idea if anyone is still reading this but I will let the creative juices do what they do. Enjoy.
His ears are full of the thud of knuckles against flesh and the wet slap of skin on skin, the gurgle of strangled breaths.
“Clint. Status.” Cap called over the com, but Clint was a little busy dodging the speedy, incredibly powerful blows, the human lantern was throwing at him, having to rely on every bit of his own speed and flexibility not to take a direct hit. He was pretty sure when the guy drove his fist straight through a wall that he didn’t want those giant paws coming into contact with his body any time soon.
Natasha still didn’t speak and when Tony looked up it was to see that she’d stepped back, her blank face gone very pale.
T’Challa had told them about the Nehe stone that had led Tony to conclude (rather reasonably) that the gem T’Challa wore around his neck was some sort of knock off. I mean why wouldn’t he come to that conclusion when the real Nehe stone had belonged to the first Alurio woman and was supposedly being passed down through her decedents?
They heave their sour grapes at him through the tabloids but you know what they say. When life throws grapes, crush them and make wine.
This armor was smaller, sleeker, and closer fitting, which likely allowed for a greater range of motion and was the reason why for the first time that Thor could recall, the portion covering his head included the shape of his ears rather than sticking to the shape of the human head.
"Yeah.  Biologically we're pretty stunted...." the tom said with a sad wry little smile. "But that's changed now. That's why we secluded you. You now have a fully functional Queen brain with none of the training for it. Between that and your technopathy we thought it best to bring you down here. We didn’t think machines exploding and accidently melting people’s brains was a good way for you to wake up.”
"You mean like a Christmas party?" Harley's eyes opened wide in excitement. He clutched on tightly to Thor as his vigors nod threatened the eager kit's seat once more, turning to pin those round gleaming eyes on Tony as he pleaded, "Can we? Just like in the movies. I've never been allowed to go to a Christmas party."
Tuesday nights the kats in their department gather in their apartment because they are the only one’s without a live-in handler. There are three of them in the entire department so they are close. Necessity will do that but Amory is the one they think they would have been close with under any circumstances.
And as he watched Amee’s mommy come in and tell her what a wonderful privilege it was to bring a child into the world and how happy she was going to be to give another family such a special gift, the feeling of discomfort only grew.
Maya Hansen masked her nervousness well with dry humor and minuscule expressions besides the occasional sardonic twist of her mouth, but her scent gave away her fear. Natasha knew the woman was deeply afraid, though it was hard to tell what made her more uncomfortable: being in a room with the hostile Avengers, or sitting next to the target of their hostility.
"This nigger?" The officer asks incredulously as if he can't believe a word of it. "They were probably in it together you know. You can't trust these people."
Steve wasn’t a slouch at hand to hand combat. He was fine playing the defensive so long as it gave him time to observe his opponent. T’Challa was better trained and his leaner frame made him objectively faster, but Steve knew he could overpower the tom easily if he could just get a solid grip on him. The problem was T’Challa knew it too. The guy was like water, slipping in and out of range before Steve could so much as get two hands on him, utilizing every last inch of his body like a damn acrobat at times to avoid the blows that would slow him down.
Focusing on the heat simmering in the center of his body he took a deep breath and thought about pulling it forward channeling it through his body and into his hands, through the chip and – Mother fucker! That hurt.
Tony blinked, the message pushing itself to the forefront of his mind and Tony stiffened. He was using Extremis to access the net, test driving a set of new wireless robotics. The highly encrypted message had seemingly come from nowhere, targeted directly at the towers private servers which both Tony and Jarvis were tapped in to.
He is Ivan the trainer, but he is not always. Sometimes the broken fragments of the past poke at his mind and cause unnecessary disruption.
“I do not know what to say, since you seem pretty certain of this. Perhaps Captain Rogers brain works differently on account of his unique biology,” the tom murmured after a long moment, a pensive frown still furrowing his brow.
He seemed comfortable with it, like he was used to having others eyes on him and his words carefully considered. Tony knew a thing or two about commanding attention, but it was never truly natural to him. He could put the show on effortlessly by now, of course he could, but that wasn’t his true skin. His true skin was an oil stained pair of jeans and a ratty band t-shirt.
“Hey Honey, I’m home.” Tony called out from the door as he kicked off his shoes, because he was a master of wit, and Steve stuck his head out from the kitchen and smiled at him.
“Are you done holding back yet? Or is this a fair enough fight yet?” T’Challa’s voice floated down from above and Steve looked up to find the kat laying across a beam above his head, long black tail hanging lazily beside him like he was some sleepy jungle cat relaxing in a tree. Arrogant son of a bitch, Steve thought and he grinned. Bucky would have said it to his face but Steve liked actions better than words.
“What’s this about Tony?” Steve asked after the silence in the room had gone on long enough to become awkward.
“Alright so, we can’t just drop in on them and take them up on the ark. At least not until history plays out and we’re closer to the incursion point,” Riri theorized and Kate snorted, her dark eyebrows arching.
He was unerringly proud of their Midgardian friends of old who had taken up the tradition for themselves, their Yuletide a charming (if tame) imitation of the Asgardian customs. Though there was not enough beer involved and a shocking shortage of Giant Boars to be hunted, the Midgardian goose was not unpleasant fare. Thor was sure Loki would have enjoyed the bird garnished in a wild berry sauce that Jane’s assistant Darcy (who was a surprisingly deft hand in the kitchen) had prepared for the Midgardian Feast of Thanks.
“I’ve got this. Go.” The kat with the shield shouted, his voice similarly disguised, and the female immediately took flight, boot repulsors nearly soundless (and really damn sexy if Tony were being honest) as she blasted a hole in the floor above and disappearing upward. Her companion kept Tony busy by pulling back his arm and
Tony had held his reservations about it but after a full day at the shelter they were back in the tower and the Avengers Christmas party was well underway, and was thus far a roaring success. By some miracle, (or maybe just because everyone was just as big a sucker for Harley's big blue eyes as Tony was) everyone that Tony considered family had been able to make it. Even Rhodey had managed to get leave and had brought a friend along (though Tony smelled bullshit on the just friends bit, and not just because Carol had tits).
Closing his eyes he blocked out everything that wasn’t his own heartbeat, and then he opened his mind once more, reaching for his team.
“You’re not suggesting we do what they did?” Jaime asked, sounding suitably appalled by the idea and Nyota quickly shook her head, narrowing her eyes at him in affront.
There was nothing right about the whole scenario. Really, there was so much not right about Catman’s whole deal that the very lack of SHIELD response told Tony they already were involved in some way, up to their eyebrows, and that if he wanted answers he better go digging.
No protests? No threats? No wheeling and dealing? No sleazy advances to try and show him what he was missing out on? Just okay? T’Challa frowned as if he thought Tony might be slow.
She'd just leapt to another rafter to get a better angle when Killian raised his hand and slapped the body on the table, not harshly but solidly, and the body jerked to life with a gasp.
Once another section was pinned carefully in place he stuck out his hand expectantly for one of the little carved wooden ornaments from the large chest at Thor’s feet, laughing as Thor stooped (carefully) nearly unseating him. Thor had a sure grip on the child, but JARVIS of course worried.
"I might be a fool for leaving my champion here alone with a feral kitten, but I presume I can leave you two alone without causing a scandal?" Robert winked at him with a knowing smirk and Tony had to clamp his teeth together to prevent a hiss from escaping. "Go easy on him Tony he's a good boy."
The fel on screen was young, pretty and mostly plastic, nothing like Stark, but something about hearing those words reminded him uncomfortably of Tony.
But Tony couldn’t concentrate on that because the stricken look on Steve’s face was too much. It sent a cold creeping chill through Tony because there was no way around a look like that. Steve didn’t want this. He didn’t want them (him and Jaime) and he was so bothered by what Tony had shown him that he could barely even put a full sentence together.
Anyway, the whole class had just been going along with Mr. Hepburn until Peter had raised his hand and suggested they go to Stark Industries instead. Mr. Hepburn was just afraid of offending Master Norman because he donated so much money to the school so that Peter could go to school there, but everybody knew that Stark Industries built the coolest stuff and nobody could beat them. Not even Master Osborne.
Tony and Yinsen are down at the docs and Tony is nine. He's excited because Devi's ship is in port and he wants to show him the engine designs he's been working on. He hasn't shown Hughard yet because they aren't ready. Hughard always spots the flaws, even the tiniest ones. They have to be perfect. And maybe, just maybe if they are, Hughard will agree to try it.
“You and Natasha are both bonded to the Winter Soldier, sometimes known as Ivan.” Tony finally answered and the flummoxed expression that Steve’s face morphed into was almost comical.
“I can see that.” Tony sighed, glancing around at the area of the hall that they’d finished which was dripping in evergreen and sparkling tinsel, but Tony’s eyes were narrowed on the ornaments hanging heavily from the bows, their polished surfaces gleaming under the lights. “Mind explaining why the hell there are goats all over my tower?"
For a moment Tony thought the low hiss that filled the air was escaping from his mouth but no, he realized with shock as his eyes flew to Princess. It was coming from her.
He’d been growling again but in startling contrast Prince T’Challa seemed perfectly unbothered. Steve wondered if he understood that his family had just been insulted. Ross was likely counting on not.
Sure nobody had ever successfully spliced human and feline DNA in a lab before, but objectively it had to be possible given that the two species could procreate.
On the surface it might have appeared that only Tony really mattered. Tony was the queen. He was the one with the ability to tie them all together. But that was the surface for you.
“We didn’t have a choice but to return fire, to shoot through those people, and they all died, Tony, every last one. There was this tom, not much younger than we were, fifteen maybe… The battle was over. I was looking for our wounded, but Bucky was holding this kid who was choking on blood, crying in German as he struggled to breathe.
“The kats at that shelter are under Tony’s protection,” Bruce answered calmly, his voice echoing a tension Clint knew they all felt.
But according to his birth records Tony is a kitten (a pretty little kitten) because people are jacked up and his masculinity is measured by the size of his dick. Which is average mind you. Just because we can't all be hung like the toms.
This section of the beach was largely deserted but down the shore there were pockets of people. Families enjoying a warm summer day, watching the boats go by, fishermen hauling their catches to the docks, calling out to those who waited on shore.
At that moment there was a rustling sound behind him and Natasha’s eyes snapped to something over his shoulder.
Antonia makes a rude hacking sound in her throat and Tony looks to see that she is glowering at Isiah with her hands on her hips.
Tony had ripped through every government archive he could successfully hack into (which was all of them) in order to get his hands on the record for Private James B Barnes, one of the earliest case studies in Gata ReAgression and a still nationally celebrated
Clint got another case of the hero bug and decided that he couldn't sleep with Tony, even when he was dying from palladium poisoning and his heat had made him forget all his reasons for holding back; because Tony didn't know the truth and Clint couldn't be one more person who used him.
“His Son, huh?” (not) Bucky mused behind them. “Trust you to spit in your own eye and land yourself a hundred years in the future, Stevie. Is it how you said it would be? Is it better, like you promised?”
The tag around his neck is heavy though, a bronze circle with his name and his registration number engraved. It’s there so that if he gets into any trouble or gets picked up by Animal Control they'll know who he is and who he belongs to.
It is likely that he won’t be allowed outside to play with the other children for some time, and it upsets him a little bit, but he knows it will only be worse if he whines. He’s been naughty, and the right thing to do is to accept punishment when it comes. He doesn’t want to disappoint his parents anymore anyway. He loves them too much for that.
“I hope you weren’t offended earlier by my friend’s protectiveness. It was thoughtful of you to bring a gift.” He opened with as much sincerity as he could muster, and T’Challa nodded in acknowledgment.
Eventually, a need for air forced them apart but Steve's mouth hovered over his unwilling to part more than a couple of inches. Tony was just fine with that. He buried his nose against Steve's shirt, inhaling the scent of cotton and all that made Steve,
And then, with a small intake of breath, her eyes met his once more with something naked and fearful swimming in them. Her lips parted and she began to speak.
“Alton Osborne didn’t have his son’s bastard drowned in a sack or anything half so wild. He simply did what the wealthy always do with their mistakes and hid it under the rug. That rug being his oldest friend and most loyal employee, Nathan Parker.”
"Oh he's really sweet. I like him." Kitty purred turning in her boyfriend's lap to nip his ear playfully. "Watch out Petey-pie I may have just found my next husband."
“Until the heir is old enough?” Tony ventured, just to be completely clear on the subject, but he wasn’t surprised by the frank stare he received in return.
Tears spring to his eyes and gaze softens. When she touches him, there is only love in the gesture and he can feel her forgiveness wrapping around him just as surely as her arms do, as snug as a Jabari’s furs.
"What, to try and win me to your side or something?" Tony scoffed because that was too arrogant even for Loki. Tony had no idea whether he was real or not, or how he's gotten out of his cage if he was, but he couldn't discount Loki's powers of projection either.
The soldier is a kat, and as such he has biological instincts that can’t be completely suppressed. They know this by trial and error. Before they realized that a sex change came with unwanted complications that threatened the mental stability of their subjects, they thought his being a fel, the female of his species, was a weakness that needed to be eradicated.
She was right. Ivan remembered that weird place with the strange girl. Ivan remembered the feeling of being himself, of quiet in his head and wholeness in his spirit, a feeling as close to the divine as he could imagine. He remembered that there were words. Words that he chose long ago – though he doesn’t know why.
“That is not true. Buck you know that’s not true”. He can hear Steve now, and the mist is thinning, he can see Steve, standing at the roots of a giant tree, facing a man Tony barely recognized as the one from old photos and video reals because this vision, this is all Steve, and the James Buchanan Barnes of his mind is too beautiful to be quite earthly. His skin was fucking glowing and there were flames in his eyes.
IT IS SWEET THAT YOU THINK I NEED YOUR HELP LEAVING THE CRADLE, BUT I AM HAPPY TO PLAY THE PART ANYTIME YOU FEEL LIKE GIVING IT A TRY.
"Surely as your bond grows your inferior nose will pick up the changes. " Her long pink tongue came out to wipe the area around her mouth and then as if they'd never dropped the subject at all she stared right through him and suddenly her voice, fierce and dark, filled his head,
"So we agree then that Tony was the target." He let it go, but not without making sure she knew he didn't approve of her talking like that. Natasha's lips curled around the skin of her apple before she took a bite. Steve sighed. "I don't like it. Why go to that length just to get a reaction?"
"Tony, come here bambino. I want you to meet my very best friend."Taking his hand she gently tugs him toward the woman who is beaming down at him, lips all a tremble like she might start to cry again. "This is your aunt Antonia."
“This is harder than it looks Cap!” Tony replied. “You try doing delicate demolition work with a thunder god throwing shit at you. Just keep him occupied for five more minutes!”
"Others have decided to prolong their stay in pursuit of an education, in the hopes of becoming public aides or working in a trade. I commend your efforts. Stark Industries is dedicated to providing you with the tools and recourses in order to achieve your goals, because all of you are capable. All of you can shape your world for the better, but first someone has to give you a chisel.”
“Don’t annoy me Thor or this time I will take your head.” The woman hissed, the air thickening with the sweet notes of her affection to betray the lie in her warning. Tony wiggled his nose at the strong scent, noting to himself that these guys were liberal as fuck with their pheromones. The motion caught the woman’s attention and her eyes fixed on Tony and the other Avengers who were standing awkwardly behind Thor watching the reunion.
“The point is, I understand you. I was broken once myself, too broken in fact for the great Tony Stark to even look twice at, but I found a way to perfect myself. I can help you and the other gata like I’m helping Mr. Stone.”
“Just be friendly to him Tony, we need this contract. The stock took a dip after that story they printed with you and that woman from Exon . Now settle down, I know it was my idea to chat her up but I didn’t tell you to let her cuff you to the damn bed post. Then the silly bitch loses the key. I tell you boy you know how to pick em.”
The door of the office swished open right on cue and Princess stepped inside. She was dressed in the same black skirt and jacket she reported for duty in most days, her intern badge a sleek silver bar pinned to her breast. Her hair was the only thing not perfectly polished about her – a wild riot of curls that would have put Merida to shame, that she’d unsuccessfully tried to strangle into a bun.
“We still need to make sure the war turns out the same way.” Jaime insisted. “I’m worried we changed something fundamental enough to change the outcome of the war.”
Silence descended once more, but it was not uncomfortable. Tony resumed eating his Lobster Fra Diavolo and enjoyed the music and the warm glow of candle light.
“Yes I did.” Luke answered with a nod. “I can find no fault in either her research or her test subjects. The machine should work exactly as you expect it will.”
"You're sure? Steve asked but Tony had already taken flight and headed upward through the hole in the ceiling. Sure enough he found similar holes blasted through the remaining floors all the way up to the the roof.
Bruce had been twenty-five when it happened. Working as a lab 'aid' under Ross's guardianship and well aware that it was his mind behind his department's success and that he'd never see a stitch of credit for it unless he pushed.
“I am making you tea.” T’Challa explained after he’d filled the pot with water and set it on the stove, on top of a high flame. Then he turned and fished out a mug from the cupboard and set it firmly on the counter, reaching in his shirt pocket and fishing out a small cloth bundle. As he unwrapped the shriveled green leaves a familiar smell tickled Tony’s nostrils and he sat up straighter, nose twitching.
Tony winced, wondering what T’Challa had made of him in his report, but kept silent as the prince pressed on.
When Tony wandered onto the communal floor it was with the thought of grabbing a glass of his favorite cream from the kitchen to take down with him, but he stopped short when he realized he wasn't the only one up.
“Hey, look at that Bruce,” he said, capturing the tom’s attention and nodding toward Luke. “Turns out we do have a qualified medical professional in residence.”
He wasn’t an asshole about it, but Tony didn’t have to be a mind reader to know Steve didn’t much like the topic of conversation. Who would? Way to start off a relationship Stark. Hashing through the biological evidence of your attraction to someone else is always a winning option for a second date.
Why would he want to unravel the best and brightest of possible futures to find the fatal flaws? Can’t he just… can’t he just be happy for once? Have something good and keep it?
When Peter Parker had been in the fourth grade his class had taken a school trip to Stark Industries. They’d taken a vote on where to go, even though Mr. Hepburn their science had kept mentioning how great it would be for them to go to Oscorp and see everything they were working on there, Peter didn’t want to go there. Oscorp was pretty cool but Peter had been there a million times and had already seen the best things that Master Osborne was working on. But Peter couldn’t tell any of his classmates about the best stuff anyway and Master Osborne didn’t like reminding people in public that he was friendly with the Parkers.
Clint loaded three arrows at once, because even though he hated to lose them, he was only going to get one shot at this. With inhuman speed and grace he leapt over the steel counter, twisting in midair as he went to fire one last hasty shot.
“It’s not a problem. That’s actually what I wanted to talk to you about.” Tony withdrew the thin bundle of folded documents from the pocket of his suit jacket and placed them in the young woman’s hands. “It’s the deed to the condo you’re staying in. I’d like you and Harley to stay there, indefinitely.”
"There, you see Robert. We're not the only ones who think it pays not to declaw your kat." Tony smiled with all his teeth. He was just fine with that. Let them take their pound of flesh. He'd take them for everything they were worth. And Robert seemed to know, that this time at least, he was beaten.
But Wanda’s unconsciousness had been a rouse and when Steve had suddenly taken off, she’d unleashed her power, taking everyone by surprise. She and her partner had escaped, along with the rebel kit whose powers mimicked her own. The other two had been knocked unconscious during the blast. They were in SHIELD custody now. Fury had been calling all morning because so far no one had been able to get them to talk or to crack their identities. It was the suits they wore. The tech was too advanced for SHIELD’s engineers to disable and the kits weren’t responding to orders to reveal themselves.
Tony dragged his head up and blinked owlishly as the familiarity in that obnoxious drawl fully sank in. He’d been so busy drinking in the blessedly cool waves of air washing over his face, that it took him a moment to realize he recognized his rescuer. They hadn't gone to high school together because Tony's a genius and graduated when he was fourteen years old, but Tony had hung around with the local football team because... actually no. Nope. Best not to go down that road.
"Ah Tony, it is good that you have joined us." Thor said, clapping a meaty hand on Tony's shoulder, thankfully with some restraint (not always a guarantee with Thor) "There are congratulations to be had for our valiant archer and the son of Coul."
Obi was right, their noses are different. Isiah's stands out on his face but he doesn't look bad for it.
Without missing a beat Tony called out loudly to someone named Jarvis, asking for an order from someone named Kang.
"They've opened up talks with Wakanda." Natasha said in monotone and Robert blinked, startled no doubt that a kitten he didn't know and hadn't addressed first would be brave enough to speak to him. Natasha just nodded slightly as if he'd denied her claim and went on.
The first day's movements had no clear pattern or significance, except that when looked at from an aerial view the route reads: Hello Tony.
I’m saying that hunting them down like they are animals is the wrong. Was I not clear? I have the Iron Man armor. I’ve only ever used the armor to defend myself and innocent people. I’ve spent the last two decades of my life devoted to protecting people, and fighting for the civil rights of myself and others like me- so that the next time you have to shoot some kit full of bullets cause your drugs backfired or your experiment made him go rabid, maybe you’ll rethink who the animal is in this situation.
The soldier stiffens. Sniffing harshly in the still night like a bloodhound on the search and they pause, terrified of what comes next.
Slaves had few choices, but this one she stole for herself with every clench and push as she fought to bring her child into the world.  Maria Stark laying in the bed, given no choices, and still in the end choosing him.
"It's bleak... when you lay it all out like that." Tony was saying in a softer tone. "But we're not going to give up. When they put the lights out you light a fire. Then you build a six bulb with 100,000 watts and tell them to do their worst. So that's what we're going to do. Ladies and gentelkats I am proud to announce that Stark Industries has recently purchased the land to begin our rebuild. I give you Resilience."
Steve sighs when he gets inside, he's early, way too early for someone who's usually the last one in. But he stops once again at Coulson's photo and it's like... it's like he doesn't deserve it.
"Ten seconds ago it was amazing" He then turns to Steve, ignoring Tony’s 'ouch'. And yeah, Steve could see it, the same coldness in his eyes from two months before, the same dry treatment even after the Captain nomination "Rogers, this is your new recruit. It came as a short notice, but he changed from his posterior firehouse to this one and from now on he will be working in your truck"
Tony sighs "You'll seriously make me say it?" Steve just stares at him and Tony rolls his eyes "Look, I shouldn't have ignored your orders. Again. I put us both in danger and I'm sorry"
"Hey there, Mister highness" Pietro says dangling in the chair, there was a smirk on his face but he didn't sound malicious at all. Steve smiled proudly.
And wow, a tension Steve didn't even noticed he was carrying drops from his shoulders and he relaxes, a small smile playing on his lips.
He takes some minutes to look at the helmet and replays Fury’s words in his head, each time more sure he doesn't want to leave this part of him behind.
"Okay first, this job is not a game. This is not about you, it's about saving people. So stop proving yourself because no one cares" He sees Tony taken aback, eyes wide as he stumbles back "Second, I'm pretty sure the only reason you’re kicked out of every firehouse is because you're always acting like a complete asshole! You must be happy that your father is the Mayor and can always put you in a new one, but you should give yourself a little more credit and try to obtain things by your own merit!"
"At least you were right most of the time." Sam says sitting in his desk. Steve relaxes back in his chair to look at his friend "Though you always needed someone to go save your ass"
“Clintward, I’ve done it again. I’ve made bullet proof hearing aids, even though no one else but you will ever need them!”
Clint looked down to Stark and smiled. He always wondered who made Tony think the way he did. Who made him think he had to thank his friends for being nice? Clint thought of the millions of ways he’d been ruined in the circus. Suddenly, the idea of thanking friends didn’t seem so unnatural. Clint pat Tony’s shoulder and the two continued their journey to the tower’s shared space.
“It’s quite frankly the exact opposite of that. The school pays me triple my salary here to keep an eye on you. I’m legally required to hang out with you; there was a contract and everything.”
Steve mimicked in a nasally voice. Bucky shrieked, slapping the couch and propelling him off and on the furniture.
Steve hadn’t seen Tony in three days. 72 hours of radio silence. 72 excruciatingly Tony-less hours. So, maybe Steve was kind of addicted to talking with his dorm mate. Maybe he looked forward to their chats too much. Maybe he convinces Tony to watch TV shows with him every night just so he can feel the other pressed against him. The late nights and early mornings and everything in between with Tony were his favorite parts of the day, so what? And yeah, watching Tony smile is like watching the universe being made, whoop-dee-doo.
“Hi… I’m uh, I’m Steve.” he held his hand out. Blonde Beauty accepted it and his grip was strong. He really was a machine.
Tony screamed, bringing Steve back to the present, and a green triangle mumbled something threatening, followed by an orange blob.
“You have a very basic bitch aesthetic,” Steve commented. Her eyes narrowed, and he briefly thought of an angry, murderous cat. A row of white teeth beamed out of cherry red lips and dimples carved her face. She lightly tapped his nose with her index finger.
“Stevie? Is that you? I thought I’d been forgotten by now,” Bucky Barnes shrieked dramatically over the line. Steve chuckled.
Natasha rolled her eyes and passed Edward over to his owner. They each sat in tranquility with keyboard sounds before she cleared her throat.
Steve chuckled and switched the Keurig on, then returned to his scrambled eggs. In his peripheral vision, he saw Tony with his head bowed forward on the coffee machine as it brewed his drink.
Tony grinned to himself. Steve saw that the smile was actually kind of sad, and he wondered why that was.
him and Tony would be defenseless because he’d be the stupid idiot who fell in love with someone who didn’t love him. Steve could use his body again and again, and Tony would just take it and most probably love it, because he adored anything Steve did ever. His body wouldn’t be his anymore, and he’d belong to Steve, and, and, and-
was drunk out of their minds. A high pitched groan came from Steve again as he thunked his head on the back of the door. A woman with long brown hair swiveled over to him, wearing a dress that left nothing to the imagination.
They trekked through a dog park, where they got harassed by local puppies. There were worse ways to get distracted, Steve supposed. After petting three dogs each, they continued forth.
Tony smiled softly, watching Steve lean against the vehicle with his head pointed at the sky. His neck curved a lovely arc and he chin jutted out perfectly. His eyes reflected the stars and it was easily the most beautiful thing Tony had ever seen.
“Oops,” Tony drew out. Steve didn’t reply, just peeled out of his shirt and dabbed at his chest. He got most of it and started to withdraw, only to see Stark with wide open eyes looking at him.
The two stopped their muttering to look at the other pair. Steve had his head on Bucky’s shoulder, and Buck was looking down shyly. No one even noticed the shuffling noises of someone leaving the room.
Tony peered over Steve to see his phone, then settled back down and shook his head no. He giggled softly, and Steve was only human, then they were laughing together in their own cocoon. Somehow, within that heap of blankets, the world didn’t matter.
She completed her task as soon as the rest of the class staggered in, all in varying happiness to see Steve. Moses was his personal favorite, as he was quiet at appropriate times and didn’t make huge messes. His little curls on his head stayed stagnant as he grinned in childlike wonder at the art supplies. He raised his hand after everyone settled.
“Yeah, we’ve been brothers since elementary school. He saved me from a fight I couldn’t win, then let me kick his ass for good measure. Ma says we’re attached at the hip, and maybe we are, but no, we’re not dating.”
“I didn’t know that was your middle name,” Clint mused from his place in front of the refrigerator. Tony flipped him off as he slammed his laptop shut and looked around for a hiding spot. He only saw cabinets, so he had two options: get murdered or fold himself like origami into a cupboard.
“I’ve had every conversation before. Communication is just repetition of words in different sequences. There is no idea that hasn’t already existed; just ideas that haven’t been conveyed correctly.”
The friends burst into laughter at that, spilling milk on the hard floor. Chuckles that lingered for far too long stopped haltingly when a spectre of fur blankets waddled into the room.
And they were alone once more. Steve shifted back to Tony, who maintained eye contact with where Barnes had been.
Clint exhaled in defeat and wrapped his arm around the brunette, who snuggled in closer. Tony’s breath was too hot on Clint’s neck, and his arm would go numb soon, but it was worthwhile.
Steve whined at the cold where Tony had previously been and snuggled deeper into the cushions. Pounding footsteps stomped sporadically as the other roommate ran around chaotically. When the rattling stopped, Steve squinted through one eye suspiciously, only to have a bundle of Tony snuggle between him and the back of the couch. They laid face to face, millimeters apart, sharing breaths in silence. Steve raised his handful of blankets in an offer to Tony, who accepted and wriggled closer. Their chests bumped against one another while they stared at the other forever. The same chocolate eyes captured Steve in a confusing trap, and he wondered how he got there. When did eye contact with Tony transform to eye contact with Medusa? Every time, they froze him in his place when he looked for too long, and every time, he went willingly.
Steve tugged him into a hug, and they both embraced one another while sobbing for an eternity. Time passed irregularly, but they eventually pulled away.
“Bruh, he’s like fuckin’ Linus from Charlie Brown,” Bucky announced, and Steve cackled like a hyena. The two howled together on the three cushioned Happiness Couch at Tony, who was then rolling his eyes and making his way to the kitchen.
His first class ended quickly enough, and his second class was Art History. He sat next to a tall blonde haired kid who paid better attention than even Steve. His blonde hair was braided out of the way, but baby hairs were persistent in swirling around whenever he shifted in his seat. His icy blue eyes whizzed from one side of the black board to another and then again as the professor scribbled away. His broad shoulders gave Steve a run for his money, as did his arms. He was a perpetual-question-machine and his low voice boomed like thunder. Steve liked his queries; they were relevant and insightful. Class wouldn’t make near as much sense without him asking the same things Steve was wondering.
He softly walked over and sat down next to the little ball of person. The smaller man wasn’t okay, based on a short list Clint comprised: Tony’s hair was greasy and his eyes were red, with a face that was sullen and shoulders that hung low. And... y’know... the liquor bottle he was holding.
“Today at school, we got teached the vowel song, it went ba ba duhh doo bop bee,” she continued singing a song that vaguely sounded like the Batman theme song as Steve smiled to himself. She roughly settled each tiny apron on every desk, skipping between tables.
They didn’t talk after that, they ignored each other if they were ever in the same communal room together, and Steve was incredibly lonely. But he’d die before he surrendered to an elitist asshole like Stark. The other housemate kept odd hours anyway, which was a blessing and a curse. A blessing because they never really bumped into each other, a curse because electric whirring and metallic banging kept Steve from sleeping most nights. Usually, Steve mutinously muttered profanities to himself and put in headphones. But this was the fourth night in a row where he was kept awake, and he had an early morning tomorrow, so he stormed across the flat and knocked aggressively. The loud noises ceased.
Bucky and Steve had gotten close all right, but as far as Clint knew... Tony laid his head on Clint’s shoulder and sniffled.
“Hey Stevie- woah.” Bucky was stopped in the open door frame with his phone held loosely in his hand.
Thor sighed but they all knew she wasn’t upset at them. Her eyes were frantically switching between everyone and her left pinkie tapped up and down absentmindedly. She was anxious for Tony.
Steve Rogers was a difficult man to describe, but definitely a mistake. Tony had been obsessed with Steve since day one, but no matter what Tony says, Steve wasn’t perfect. Steve punched holes in his walls when civilians died, he cried when he remembered the ice, and he ate all of Clint’s food. Big mistake there.
when a body ran into his. He took out his left bud and saw Fuckin Tony Stark blinking up at him with eyes that were brown enough to rival Bambi’s.
“Okay Grandpa. Let me know when your refractory period is done so I can go dig up Grandma,” Romanoff deadpanned.
It had been too soon when Tony yelled in surprise. Steve shook out of bed onto the floor to see Stark with a hand over his heart and blown open eyes.
When they all finally moved in, the two caught on like a house on fire after apologizing. Tony would sit on top of Steve during movie nights while Steve would rake his hand through Tony’s hair. But the months passed and the two became more domestic in their pining, with Steve always making double of everything he cooked so Tony could have some and Tony moving a humongous couch into his lab to fit Steve. It was frustratingly adorable.
“Hi, Mr Steve,” she accosted, sidling up next to him. He silently passed her an apron and fourteen others to pass out.
Steve pet his friend’s side comfortingly, despite him having no idea what was happening. They’d been watching the show for five hours at this point, and Steve had fallen asleep more than once. Tony paused the show and chucked his phone at the wall, shooting off the furniture into the hallway.
As their lips touched tentatively, Tony’s walls crumbled gracelessly, causing quakes in his head. Steve would kill him one day, and this was Tony handing him the knife.
The blonde exhaled lightly, kicked off the van, and tread to his side. Tony swallowed and curled into the vacant seat. Steve started the ignition and they were off. Tony watched white fence zoom up and down with the hills as they sat in quiet. Against the door, air conditioning faced him and froze him to the bone. It was refreshing and Tony could think straight again.
Tony and Natasha paused their administrations to look at him. Tony beamed and perched himself on Steve’s legs.
His voice cracked on the last word. Natasha’s little sharp inhale didn’t help, but Steve just smiled and blushed.
But Tony’s breaths had evened out and he was entirely slumped against Steve. He sighed and heaved his friend in his arms precariously. He whipped his phone out.
“I don’t care,” Steve replied easily. Tony’s eyes burned and he turned his face away. Every bit of pain anyone had ever given him gathered into a lump in his throat.
They eventually pulled into a parking lot that was dimly lit. Cicadas buzzed in the background and Tony slammed his door shut, just to piss off Steve
They turned right and came to a crosswalk. Tony didn’t stop for the light, he simply weaved through cars and pedestrians with natural ease. Steve sighed and repeated the steps, admittedly sloppier and less badass.
“Once you graduate Stevie, you can draw a horrifically offensive show that has twenty-two too many seasons.”
They walked side by side the entire trip, even though Tony tended to slow down as he got into a topic. They were talking about how the world was going to end when he first noted it happening.
Bucky’s brown hair was french braided into a neat bun (nice to know what Natasha’s priorities are) and little baby hairs lined his forehead. James was about an inch smaller than Steve, and his skin was much paler. It looked like a sheet of paper. His shoulders were broad, and his clothing looked a little worn for wear, even all the way to his toes.
“Now, Mr Coon, you scared my friend. That wasn’t very nice,” he paused as the animal squeaked, “yes, I understand that he’s a quivering pussy, but that doesn’t excuse your bad manners.”
They’d been friends for six weeks at that point, and to everyone’s surprise, they’ve been inseparable. The two walked to their classes together, met up for lunch, and now they watch TV together, too. Tony had jumped on top of Steve at seven in the morning that weekend with “super urgent news”.
Steve stared blankly at the pair before huffing in frustration and wandering around. He eventually found an empty room, smaller than the other one that was inhabited, and he set his boxes down. Not wanting to interact with his douchey roommate, he began unpacking his boxes. Polos, tank tops, and short sleeve shirts were hung in his (moderately tiny) closet. Jeans, cargo shorts, sweats, and pajamas were folded and neat onto the floor next to his king mattress on the floor as well. He’d need to buy a drawer soon, but he figured he’d be okay for the weekend. He settled his sketchbook, charcoal pencils, acrylics, watercolors, brushes, and board canvases on his bed. Next was his Harry Potter collection, all newest edition with the completed scene on the covers, which were neatly ordered by number of sequence on top of each other in the now empty box. With nothing left to unpack, he sat down on his floor and checked out his room for the first time. He had a circular ceiling light that was turned off since he didn’t have curtains and the day was bright. White walls and ceiling created a nice minimalist aesthetic he knew he’d destroy as soon as he got comfortable here. Bored with his plain room, he pulled his phone and dialed his best friend.
Steve paused in his administrations to slowly shake his head side to side. Tony shrugged and together they trekked into the store.
“It seems sacreligious,” Tony stated with a flimsy lift of his shoulders. Steve bit back a smile, and retrieved a different colored box, then tossed it into his cart.
“Sadly, yeah. She’s amazing though. She graduated four months ago with a master’s in entrepreneuring. She wants ta’ move out to Cali and start her own company, but for now she’s part time iHop server and full time MeSitter.”
“I could hurt you,” Tony finally admitted. Steve chuckled lightly and held his hand out. Tony accepted it and big, firm warmth flooded from his fingers to his soul.
“You gotta go babysit him though, or else he’ll just buy multicolored dildos and say that they’re bananas and carrots,” she concluded.
“And waste carbon emissions to pollute our already fragile ecosystem when we could easily walk there, which is better for our health, but also our environment?”
Lights on the low ceiling were in neat rows and columns, keeping darkness at bay by the door. A cashier greeted them and they waved back. No one was expecting Captain America or Iron Man here, so any suspicion would be thrown off. It was nice going out without dumb baseball hats. However, Tony always got a kick from Steve going incognito. The pair each pulled a buggy out of line and began the expedition at the farthest right aisle.
Tony rolled his eyes and marched to the van. The stars had come out to play and they twinkled over the farm. Fireflies flickered randomly in the tall grasses as more toads burped from the oasis. Tony stood in awe just outside the passenger side’s door, until he heard Steve shuffle next to him.
Steve shot up like a bullet from the floor and dazedly took his surroundings in. When he landed on Tony, however, a myriad of emotions battered his face. He ended on anger.
They both nodded and she deftly lead them to a booth in the back corner. Her long red hair swayed with each step. The pair sat across from one another as she laid out the menus.
“I find you half dead in God knows where, barely able to speak. Then you sleep it all off in a hospital for a day until they discharge you, and now you’re gonna joke about it?”
She grinned even more predatorily as she crossed her on top of his and rested against the other arm chair.
Tony inhaled a sharp breath and his shoulders rose to his ears. Steve cocked his head to one side, and Tony couldn’t take it anymore.
The desire of gouging his lungs out was exceedingly appealing the entire trip home. When Tony meekly reached out to turn on the radio, Steve glared daggers at him, so he decided against it. Drake wasn’t worth losing a limb over.
When they asked who wants what, four other voices answered in tandem with a variety of foods. Words clashed and nothing made sense, so Tony clapped his hands together and walked out the door with Steve on his tail.
Bruce finished and Thor helped him up off the floor. After hugging for a moment, the two shuffled out, leaving Clint in their wake.
“Do it, pussy,” the other challenged. Steve dramatically dropped his head against the arm and went limp. His tongue hung out and his eyes glossed over, looking nowhere near dead, but very reminiscent of someone drunkenly passed out. Bucky snapped a picture and ran away before Steve could murder him in cold blood. His friend ran out the door, and Steve was going to chase him, but Tony “accidentally” spilled black coffee on him.
“Has anyone seen Tony? I haven’t seen him in days,” Steve leaned against the wall looking concerned.
Tony chuckled in a low tone. Steve had already decided he liked the sound. He wanted to hear it more often.
They were closer than they’d ever been before, with Steve’s head bowed to look at Tony’s eyes. The brunette’s head was angled to look up at him, which was weird to think about. Stark’s personality usually took up a whole room, but he himself is a very small person. Steve held his stained shirt in his hands in between their two bodies. The only sound was them exchanging breaths. Tony’s mug was empty and forgotten as the pair remained rooted to the floor in front of one another.
Pepper came back around with Steve’s order and a half gallon of black coffee for Tony. He drank from the container, but no one else was here, so it didn’t matter. They then ordered their food, and chatted amongst one another until their meals arrived.
“Natasha, Nat, Tasha, Natalie, Natalia, and once Natty.” she took his hand. Her grip was strong and deadly. Red curls flipped out of her face and onto her brown leather jacket that was unzipped to unveil a Led Zeppelin tee. Her scuffed jeans had holes in the knees and were tucked into white sneakers.
“Tony, let’s uh... let’s go and find Nat, or Bruce, neither of which are very sympathetic, but we can try!”
The soft words hung heavy between them. Tony looked up to see all seven oceans staring back at him. Light brown brows furrowed together in concern as Steve tilted his head to the right.
So Clint, the fuckwad who was used to being an outlier from the beginning, was then surrounded by four other fuckwads and a brilliantly beautiful god of thunder.
“It’s pointless. If they wanna suffocate when there’s no oxygen left, or melt when the ozone dies, then they’re gonna do it. At our age, we already have our minds made up, and we’ve all heard the same arguments for each side. Trying to convince everyone that the world is ending within the next decade is time wasted. Time that we could be using to find a solution, or better ways of prolonging the inevitable.”
Three months had passed and Bucky was a hit. He was reticent and hesitant for seven weeks and two days before he came around. His annoyed and pessimistic attitude towards everything was hilariously brutal; he even got Nat to laugh a few times.
that Steve couldn’t bear to move. The screen reflected in his deep brown eyes that flickered whenever a frame changed. An endless supply of long eyelashes blinked up and down occasionally, completely mesmerizing Steve Rogers. Tony was tucked between his legs (“I’m
“Your weird roommate opened the door. He didn’t even ask who I was, he just said not to steal anything.”
Bruce and Thor had their legs tangled on the couch as Bruce squinted through his glasses down at his StarkPhone and Thor was french braiding his hair into a fanning bun. Clint and Tasha were in the kitchen, with Nat sat cross legged on the table and Clint scrounging for food.
“That’s the most important thing to be vocal about,” Steve announced, “it’s the one thing that can change the world.”
Steve aptly apologized, inhaled his breakfast and he was out the door with his books before the song even ended.
Once inside, coolness hit the brunette like a truck as he stood in the doorway. A glass chandelier that hung from the tall ceiling in the foyer gave everything a golden glow. Pictures of farm animals and scenic rural areas were expertly placed to look homely, but not cluttered. A plush grey rug lead down a hallway to another room and a set of decorative hangers with labels like “keys” and “dog leash” hung on the walls.
Steve switched between the two in confusion as they started to chat friendly. He was ready for a fight… what the fuck was this?
He stood in anticipation and rocked side to side, not wanting to leave. Natasha huffed and gestured to the bed.
“Always a pleasure, Natasha,” Tony drawled. She flipped him off without looking up from her phone, then plopped on the couch next to Steve’s feet. Sharp green eyes flicked to him for a nanosecond, then resumed her scrolling.
With Steve taken care of, Tony dusted his hands off on one another and strut down the hall into a gorgeous kitchen. Every flat service was marble and everything had black legs with them. The chairs had white pillows stitched on, and bananas were hung on a metal contraption in the center of the island counter. The ceiling was lower than the foyer to where if Tony jumped, he could touch it. The kitchen was connected to a carpeted room that had blackout curtains and a grey throw blanket on the L-couch. A black smooth recliner was in the corner facing the flatscreen on the wall. In the middle of it all was a low coffee table that had coasters with small farm animals on them.
“Stark, you missed out. Ma would hafta swat my hands away any time I reached to grab stuff off the shelves, and whenever I actually managed to sneak something home, it felt like winning the Olympics. I swear on my life, late night shopping was my favorite pastime as a kid. Sometimes, Ma would give me a dime, and I could buy a set of shitty pencils to draw with. It was Christmas.”
“Hi, I’m Steve.” He held his right hand out to her. She smirked, and he felt like he was missing a punchline. Her emerald eyes shook his core as she glared mischievously at him through her lashes.
“I don’t think I’ve ever actually gone grocery shopping,” Tony mused. Steve kneaded his eyebrows together in concern.
Tony had these ridiculous goggles on, like the ones from The Collector in Toy Story 2 when Woody was getting repaired. He was wielding a… something in his right hand and a piece of bent metal in his left. His legs were crossed, dwarfed by flannel cotton pants that must’ve been his pajamas. His grey hoodie had black streaks on it and was also too big for his size. Tony dropped the Something Tool and took off his goggles then glared at his intruder.
“Pick one,” she ordered with folded arms. His breath wavered as he marched in front of the room at one end of the space. When he looked back, she confirmed he could have it.
Steve stood in the doorway with an incredulous look on his face. Clint exploded with laughter as Steve sat down on the other side of Bucky.
“It has its merits. We might never get another chance to see what these guys are capable of.” Steve pointed out and Bruce grinned knowingly but nodded.
The tom blinked and his focus snapped back to Tony, those strangely enchanting dark eyes with all their different flecks of color and hints at gold, boring intently into his with purpose, and damn him but Tony couldn't help but feeling a bit like prey cornered by something wild.
“Those comics were crap.” he heard Steve say from a distance. He sounded distracted and Tony let his head flop back to get a good look at what he was doing. Huh they were inside now. Neato.
“Our Captain has made a weapon of what others would only use for defense,” Thor explained grinning with excitement at Sif’s slightly disbelieving look. She would see soon enough. “I assure you he is quite formidable with that alone.”
“That’s impossible.” Natasha refuted, her voice flat and cold. She was as closed off as the bond ever allowed her to get. He knew she was upset about something but Tony couldn’t read her thoughts without applying force and she knew damn well he wouldn’t do that to her.
Tony takes another burning swallow of the liquor in Obi's glass but this time can’t help but cough as it burns its way down, and Obi chuckles at him even as Hughard turns and glares in their direction.
“That’s true.” Tony allowed. "And it's the only reason I'm giving you the warning. Also just so you know I don’t like it when the other kids have fancier toys than I do. Unless they share.”
Natasha's glower had evened out to something far less readable, that Tony hoped meant less danger. He was somewhat wrong, because a moment later her hand darted out and there was an unholy pinch in his ear that had him jerking up with a yowl, baring his teeth at her.
“It’s fine. Extremis is unstable right? Nothing we didn’t already know. We fix it, I live, I stop frying my own spawn-” Steve flinched but Tony blundered on, “And then we’re back here, with no reason to believe that the next time you get a little friendly with your teeth during heat that it won’t be the start of something. But Steve – ”
"So, you and Stark are the real deal?" Sam asked after Rhodes had disappeared into the crowd and the silence had stretched between them for a moment too long. Steve tensed at the note of disbelief in his tone.
Frowning petulantly for her amusement, Tony cast his eyes toward her right side where he knew the wound was, silently asking for permission. Wordlessly she lifted the edge of her shirt, revealing the neatly stitched skin beneath. She’d heal faster than a human might, but a gunshot wound was a gunshot wound. Tony winced at how close the shot had come to puncturing a lung.
“It’s your lucky night Cap. They’re on display for a reason so friends get pain free ogles.” Natasha murmured with a slight smirk raising her glass to drink. Though many of the ladies filling the hall were wearing evening gloves she’d chosen few accessories herself, allowing her form hugging dress and various bared appendages to speak for themselves.
"You remind me of my little sister." Luke chuckled, seemingly unperturbed by Natasha's menacing stare. White teeth flashed in a wide grin as a laugh rumbled in his chest. "Now you definitely do. I was not sure at first what to make of you Avengers, but I have some hope now."
"I don't need you to hold my hand Rogers." Tony spat, ears flattening defensively; because Steve was giving off that hyper aggressive pheromone charged fight scent that warned every other kat in the room that one wrong move and he'd have his claws buried in their ass; except Steve didn't actually have claws because he wasn't a real kat, just some weird superhuman pseudo hybrid cooked up in a lab. His scent glands didn't seem to know that though.
Blasting one of the mercs back with a repulsor blast he reached behind him and slashed at the neck of the asshole who’d thought it was a good idea to try and grab him from behind. Twisting in the cage of the guy’s arms to claw through his shirt and vest, digging into vulnerable flesh.
It was always possible that it was just some sort of Afro- Gata pride thing, where it was just a fad to wear replicas from the legends of Alurian heroes, but Tony's instinct said that it was more than that.
“But- Maria say no write on friends. Only paper.” Peter explains, frowning at the idea of someone writing on his skin. Maybe this weird place is getting to his Daddies’ heads. When Tony has got Peter on the bed comfortably, there is a knock on the door and a cute male nurse enters with some supplies in hand.
“Okay!” That seems like a reasonable solution to Wanda. She daintily holds out her hand like a princess and then shouts. “Daddy, I gotta get ready!” She thinks she will wear her Cinderella dress today, but she wonders if they will have enough time to get her hair done. “Hurry Daddy, we’ll be late again! Peter fixed me!”
“Yeah, I read the report from the ER doctor at Central. Don’t worry about that.” The doctor replies. “We'll get you checked out and all better in no time.” Stephen says to Peter reassuringly as they wheel him in. “And your Daddies are going to be here with you the whole time, okay? Do you think you can be a big boy for me?”
“So, what’s next?” Tony asks, using his teeth to open the wrapping of the lollipop and then hands it to Peter. He apologises quietly when he accidentally bumps into the boy’s hurt arm.
“The magic doesn’t work unless we wear masks. Which should Thomas and I have? You can pick.” Stephen says to Peter.
“That’s all right. He’s had a long day for sure. So, I won’t bother you for long, but I just wanted to show you where to find the changing supplies.” The nurse says, then heads to the bathroom and shows the cupboard with diapers and pull-ups and everything else needed for changes. “I also have some ID bands for you guys while you stay here. You Daddies get each one too.” He says, handing Steve and Tony their ID bands.
“Hey honey. Papa’s here.” Steve whispers. “How about we have some cuddles together and talk about tomorrow? Stephen is going to make sure you’re feeling better and that means we’re gonna stay just a bit longer before we go home. Then you’ll feel better, okay?”
“When’s Peter coming home? It’s time to play.” She still has not gotten to show him hopscotch and cannot help but feel she has been shirking her responsibilities.
“I love you, Papa. Promise you won't tell Vis?” That would be one thing she cannot ever see herself getting past. “Or Peter.” He needs her to be big and take care of him, at least that is what she thinks.
“Papa n’ Wan’a?” Peter asks, opening his mouth for his Dada to let him have a drink. With one arm in a cast, Peter finds it really hard to drink from bottles when he cannot hold them with both hands.
“Peter.” Steve steps in front of the TV. “Remember our deal? Bath time now. If you want to watch another episode after, you can. Now come on, let's make this easy.” He is not beyond disciplining Peter and Wanda, but he always tries to save it as a last resort. “Let's go, young man.”
“Good girl, honey bee. Come on, across my lap and it will be over super quick.” Tony says and moves to sit next to Steve on the bed, thermometer all ready and lubed with a plastic cover on it. Wanda lays across Tony’s lap, hiding her face in the blankets on the bed. She cannot imagine how this is going to help her—is not there some magic cure that will make the horribly, icky feeling go away? She tries her best to keep still, but it is hard and she whines.
“Go home now.” Peter demands rather than asks. He is really getting sick of this and wants to play with his sister instead.
“Can you talk her into having a bath? I think we’re on the verge of a meltdown.” Steve feels bad, he knows Wanda does not feel well, but he would like to keep the evening quiet and calm. “Wanda, let’s go.”
“But, the thermator makes me icky. Makes my tummy all like- tingly and feel weird.” She explains, trying her best to explain the nervous and overall just bad feeling she gets whenever her Daddies take her temperature. One would have thought that with Wanda getting her temperature taken twice a day for nearly two weeks that she would have grown used to it, but the girl is stubborn.
“Yeah, she went potty right after her bath, but she hasn’t had anything to drink since throwing up.” Tony explains and carefully lifts Wanda up before laying her down on the bed. He pushes the covers aside so that the doctor had access to her, but he does hand over Wanda’s Elsa doll to cuddle with. “You’re being so good for me, darling.” Tony coos to Wanda, brushing her hair back.
Peter giggles quietly at the praise, snuggling up to Steve even more before sighing in content. At the question, Peter looks over at his sister and considers. She looks pale, but her cheeks are rosy and there is just something about her overall that does not seem right. And of course the constant coughing. But, Peter feels just fine.
“If you lay across Daddy's lap, maybe it'll help.” Steve offers, knowing that cuddles and touch always make her feel better. “And I'll hold your hand and be with you the whole time. You can have ice cream with your brother after. Come on sweetheart, can you be a good girl for me?” Wanda shakes her head at first, but after a little bit of back and forth, seems too tired to fight back anymore and agrees.
Steve takes extra care not to get any lavender scented shampoo in Peter’s eyes and hums a quiet song as he works. Steam on the mirror above the sink has slowly started to appear, and the whole room has a soft, hazy feeling mixed in with the distinctness of the day being washed away. Steve does not scrub Peter hard when he washes his body, but goes over his skin with the loofah in light little strokes before washing away all traces of soap.
Steve smiles at the two of them, not wanting to disturb their special time together, but snaps a quick picture on his phone. He shows it to Tony who coos in response, clutching at his heart.
“Wanna go home.” Peter whimpers, then falls still in a bit of panic when Thomas starts cutting his t-shirt up. He frowns at that, not having a clue of what to think. He wants to be angry, because his frog shirt was just ruined, but his Daddies are not upset? This place keeps getting weirder and weirder.
“We can do airplane, sweetheart. Open up, it's gonna land! Here it comes!” He always makes the plane noises and loves to see Peter laugh when he does. The boy’s giggle is high pitched and utterly adorable. He opens his mouth, turning his head in sync to Tony’s hand motions while he teases the landing. Once the spoon is in his mouth, Peter wraps his lips around it and chews happily. Thomas chuckles softly at the sight before turning to Steve.
There are laughs and threats and jokes and Steve smiles at it, and then turns back at Bruce who’s preparing the food in front of him.
"Rogers" Fury holds a hand up to shut Tony up "Don't question me" He hands him the folder from before and Steve takes it, twisting his lips "You're dismissed"
Silence falls between them for some seconds and then Steve says seriously "I thought I was a bad Captain too"
"You just send my brother to beat up that guy. Why? And dont bother lying to me, I'm a master in mischief."
"The point is, Tony" Steve says sternly "We all constantly make mistakes, we all constantly lose ourselves not knowing what is the right thing to do, but what's most important is acknowledging our errors and trying to do better. And one of the most important things I've learned is that you don't have to do it alone" Steve extends his hand.
"No, not really" Steve says walking to his office, he slows down to hold the folder up "Tony Stark, son of the Mayor. He probably won't be out of here soon"
Tony laughs sitting up on the side of the bed and Steve takes that moment to sit up too and away from the why-personal-space man "Oh my God, Steven!" Tony says holding the picture with his two hands and looking at it with way too much shine in his eyes.
“I’ve been peachy keen. Natasha’s woken me up a few times but I haven’t seen so much as a mirage or my own since Asgard,” Clint piggy backed and Tony frowned, a thought occurring to him.
“It’s not that easy guys. Believe it or not, ripping holes through space and time is not exactly an exact science.” Riri answered. “Even with those Avengers helping there was only an estimated fifty percent chance the machine was going to work right, but we ran out of time to improve it. It’s possible that we’re back home, but there’s no telling when exactly we arrived. We could be days before the point of incursion or centuries before we were ever born.”
Tony might be young but he understands that what Obi means is that Tony and his mother are the complication.
So when the government got the crazy idea to create an army of super soldiers to rival the pharaohs of old, they started by scooping up gata from local shelters and the like to train them up for the armed forces.
“Thor!” Loki calls behind him, a ring of trepidation in his tone. “Slow down you great fool! Before your mount stumbles and you break your damned neck.”
“At least you get a greeting Steve. I guess my being here means nothing.” Tony teases, scratching Jaime between the ears fondly as he glances at them (Bruce and the Tony of now) and asks, “Where’s the little monster?”
They turn their face toward the wall because they know it’s worse to look. If they catch Mr. Banner’s eye, he might start in on them and Becca will try and get between them. It’ll just be worse for her.
“What? Tony what are you doing?” Steve asked. Tony didn’t have a visual but he could tell just by the sound of his familiar tread on the planks above that Steve had already turned with the thought of helping Natasha.
Nyota shivered, thinking about the device that had nearly torn apart her family - before they'd gone and died on her anyway.
"Yeah, I mean if we're honest..." Tony sighed, running his hands tiredly through his sweaty hair. Natasha noticed that his face was still flushed from the surge of temper, but she knew his oncoming heat was partially to blame.
She sounded so damn smug, so damn superior as she looked down her nose at him and decided he was too weak to handle the truth, and just like that Tony was done.
Tony snorted in disbelief, like Steve was having some sort of a go at him, his arms still horribly tense beneath Steve’s hands.
Beside Tony Steve continued to breathe deeply, saying nothing for a long pregnant pause until, like the flip of a switch he was suddenly all business.
It was hard on the nerves sitting in the observation area watching as the monitors beeped and flashed, not knowing whether any of the medical babble Miss Cho and Dr. Salek traded back and forth was good or bad as Bruce and Tony layed on the bed in the center of the room in a strange catatonic state.
"If I may, Captain," Thor interjected before Tony could finish taking the breath to retort. Tony was staring daggers so intently into Steve's blue eyes that it took him a moment to register that Thor was even speaking.
And maybe he'd never be as good as somebody like Captain America, but having someone like that (like Steve) look at you like they were just holding their breath until they saw you? That might mean maybe he'd gotten there in his own way.
It was hard not to be jealous as Tony, Bruce and Natasha oriented themselves around the new bond. Steve wasn’t the only one who felt that way either. It was impossible for Clint not to feel somewhat left behind as Natasha connected with others on a level that he couldn’t touch, and found a place in the very thing he’d always wanted and she never had.
"You forget to whom you speak." A low growl ripped out of Catman's throat and Steve's heated blue eyes flew to him with barely checked rage.
“Sounds like a bully.” Natasha murmured from the couch and Harley turned to look at her. “We don’t like bullies.”
He couldn't help flashing back to a time when he'd assumed the exact opposite of Tony and had been proven so horryifyingly wrong sometimes he still had nightmares about standing below, helpless, watching Tony disappear into the black of space. Sometimes it was watching him fall from the sky, too high for the impact not to be deadly, nothing to slow his fall. Steve felt a rush of anger and a strange surge of protectiveness as his eyes flew back to Tony, standing at the head of the room to give his speech.
"Tony!" He heard Pepper scream, and he didn't have time to turn around or even to see if their sedative cocktail was actually going to work because suddenly he was being wrenched up through the gaping whole in the roof by a guy who was either superhuman or jacked up on so many steroids he might as well be.
“After the serum, first time I bit Bucky I drew blood and nearly lost it after. But he said he was alright.” Steve shrugged, a weak smile (a pensive little wisp of a thing) tugging at the side of his mouth that hurt Tony’s heart to see. He returned it, waggling his eyebrows for levities sake, and to show Steve that he was okay talking about Barnes.
"At the time he was a mark, and for most people sex is the quickest way toward intimacy. By the time I was trying to convince him I actually gave a shit the damage had been done." Clint looked directly at Steve again and thrust a controller in his direction like a teacher might a chalk stick. " Trust me man, Stark's already told himself that all you want is his money, or his brain, or his body, or some other damn thing. He's just waiting for you to prove it. Everyone else has."
Ivan emptied the clip in the gun and reloaded with the special ones coated in adamantium – the ones his handlers said would be strong enough to pierce through Stark’s armor. He can’t waste a single shot. He’s only got two. Ivan aims and fires.
With the whole class suddenly enthused about getting a chance to see inside Stark Industries Mr. Hepburn had no choice but to promise he’d try and arrange it. He warned them not to get their hopes up. Tony Stark was unreliable, prickly and not known to be a generous man. Not like Master Osborne. Peter hadn’t cared what he or Eugene said, too excited about the chance to be close to his hero.
Getting the message out to the team was as simple as connecting to JARVIS’ server, which was only a matter of accessing the internet with his brain. Crazy right? But stranger things were already happening. But AIM would find their tracks long before the team would get there. So he needed that repulsor and he didn’t have time to properly fix the mangled reactor in order to use it as a power source.
