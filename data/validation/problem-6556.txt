“There was an argument between Colonel Rhodes and Mr Odinson as to whom could handle the play station better, Peter decided they should settle it like men and have a…. pillow joust, after Colonel Rhodes was unceremoniously dumped on his backside he decided to go for revenge and tossed a water balloon from a batch that Zach had made to simulate grenades that he was using to fight Darleks in the garden, the rest of the chaos followed shortly after, with Doctor Banner retreating to the library to avoid the idiocy.”
“Son of a bitch.” Tony spat, hating that he’d had an enemy under his nose once again. “I don’t suppose there is any way to trace the little bastard?” He asked.
After he’d been found nearly dead by Pepper and Coulson’s team, he’d been taken to hospital and they’d run every test imaginable, including bloodwork, the results of which Tony got back after telling the world he was Iron Man.
As the evening progressed Tony played a Dr Who board game with Zach and Peter, Clint and Sam looking on and giving commentary every now and then, Pepper and Happy had to say goodbye as Pepper had a number of early meetings the following day but promised to be up to see Tony in the afternoon.
“So, why I can’t I stay with you?” Zach whined, “I’ll do school work here, I’ll be good, I’ll do everything I’m told I promise.”
By the end of the evening Zach’s energy was flagging and he rested against Steve’s chest as they waited for Happy to pick them up in the car to go back to the tower.
He still had bladder and bowel control which was something he was very thankful for, while he may yet walk again with a support of his own devising, there was nothing he could create that could have made a loss of bowel and bladder function any better for himself. Well, maybe he could, but it would take a lot of thinking out than a brace.
"Miss Sharp, Peter's teacher, or one of them. I accompanied him in the ambulance." She bit her bottom lip looking contrite, "I am so sorry for this."
“Tony, I am so sorry.” Clint said, getting to his feet, shame faced and head hanging low. “I thought it would be fun. I never meant to hurt you.”
As angry as their parents were they were not going to deny their children the chance to check on Peter, however at present it was only family allowed at the hospital so visits would have to wait.
“I’m in a Hydra Base just outside of Baku, I can’t give any coordinates, but you should be able to trace the mobile phone.” He startled as a shrill alarm began to blare, “Shit, I think they know I’m not in my cell, fuck, Friday, I need you to tell Rhodey whats happening and send help, I can’t fight, there’s no point in sending the suit I won’t fit into it, I’m…” He looked down at himself and cupped his bump protectively, “I’m pregnant and in labour.”
The happy post-Christmas contentment continued past Boxing day, heading for New Year, Rhodey was sadly called back to base to be sent out and Pepper and Happy had to return to Malibu. They had been gone only two days when Happy was put in hospital by an explosion presumed to have been caused by the new terrorist who called himself The Mandarin.
“Paediatrics.” Bruce replied, “Steve is with him, he lost a lot of blood but he’s going to be alright.”
“Buckets, sponges, kitchen roll, dust pans, brushes, MOVE!” Tony barked in a voice that would have made Steve’s old drill sergeant proud, the old bastard would have also appreciated how Thor, Rhodes, Peter, and Zach all leapt to it, scuttling off to undo their damage without argument.
“Fury sent us to keep an eye.” Clint said, “The dicks at WSC were breathing down his neck, they want you lot kept under surveillance, it was us or Rumlow and his pack of trigger happy fuckwits.”
“Its not swine-flu Tony, its most likely a bad cold.” Bruce said, “Given a few days he’ll be back to his usual lively self.”
“Maybe because it is not human, or even humanoid as Thor is.” Vision suggested to her, “This specie is unlike anything you’ve ever encountered before, so it isn’t that surprising that your powers may not work up on it.”
“It so totally does,” Tony grumbled, slurping his coffee, a noise that made Lily giggle, she extended her hands towards Tony, wriggling and looking hopeful. To her, this was her other Father, he looked similar enough that her infant mind had accepted him as her Father without question.
“Christ, when did he get old enough for us to say “That age?” Tony asked, had it really been seven years since he gave birth? Fuck!
“Yeah, I’m here, I’m real.” Steve assured him, “And I don’t hate you, I’ve never hated you, why would you even think that?”
Clint snorted coffee out of nose and got a slap upside the head from Natasha for it, the Black Widow raised her chin and crossed the room as imperious as a queen, ignoring the snickering she was getting from her team mates.
So much blood, and even more had been dripping down onto the floor of the quinjet, a puddle of it had formed beneath the stretcher despite Bruce’s pressure on the wounds.
An image of Bucky appeared on the screen and Steve tensed, Tony unthinkingly laced his hands through Steve’s offering his support to the Alpha.
Hmm, maybe being controlled by Jarvis wouldn’t be so bad, the bastard did control his life already, bugged him about eating more than smoothies, drinking more than coffee, getting sleep, and other stuff.
It didn’t matter that Tony said it wasn’t his fault, that Bruce said it wasn’t his fault, or anyone saying it wasn’t his fault, Steve would always blame himself for this. For the horror that Bucky had suffered, for the lives lost, for the fact that Tony was having to compile data on his parent’s deaths and face the prospect of their bodies being exhumed for second autopsies.
Since last time, Steve had Friday wake him up the moment Tony began to show signs of a nightmare so he could wake him up before it took hold, this had led to interrupted nights but Tony hadn’t suffered the full horrors of the nightmares since.
Miss Marvel had given her all against him in the first wave, falling, along with Yellow Jacket, Wasp, and Spider Man.
“True.” Tony said, “And I admit, when I first learned that the paralysis was permanent I felt like it was the end of the world, but then Steve and my brats came in and reassured me that was not the case at all.”
“Why, this place is toast Bro, I ain’t throwin’ myself on a sword for Osborn, that sucker can save his own damn self.” Darnel shot back.
“You are as arrogant as Stark’s memories say you are.” The Skrull hissed, it bared its teeth at Clint, “You think you can intimidate me? Why do you even care? After all..” The Skrull’s form shifted into Clint’s “You have to watch yourself around this guy, he might break your back.”
Clint nodded looking relieved that he wouldn’t have to try answer questions from the press while more reporters screamed at him and blinded him with the flashing lights of their cameras. Bruce too looked very relieved, he wasn’t someone who enjoyed being the centre of attention and this would be a lot of attention, so to not have to do more than smile was a relief to him.
Steve remained in the waiting room until Thor got back with a very sleepy Zach who had thoroughly exhausted himself.
It was getting harder to breathe, and to think. Tony tried to pull way, but Roger’s grip on him was like iron, he’d need the suit to break it. He couldn’t focus on what Rogers was saying, his voice was becoming a blur in the roar in his ears, his face bending and twisting as Tony’s vision blurred with the sudden rush of vertigo. Had Roger’s not been gripping him so tightly he might have fallen to the ground. How ironic that would have been, him at Captain America’s feet when Rogers had accused him of wanting everyone at his own feet.
“I know, its horrible.” Tony soothed putting an arm about Peter’s shoulders, “So you were defending Ned?”
“Fine!” Tony said with a dramatic show of throwing up his hands, “Fine, when we are attacked in the night by demented, body part wearing, psycho with a hook for a hand, don’t come crying to me when I can’t save you because my back is too stiff.”
“Sure.” Steve said sliding into bed besides Tony, “Do you mind if I read for a bit?” He asked, having brought a paper back with him. Tony shook his head as he settled into sleep drifting off quickly. Steve managed a chapter before he went to sleep himself, being awoken several hours later with Tony straddling him, pupils blown wide and thighs wet with slick.
“What did you make him see?” Steve had asked, his voice tight and sick feeling swirling in his stomach, bringing an unpleasant taste into his mouth, making his tongue feel bitter.
“It’s disgusting,” Wanda spat, scowling at the screen, “Stark is using that man and baby for his own needs.”
Wanda’s magic hit Tony again, and he rolled with it, coming to stop in a familiar down fisted pose before aiming a shot at the witch, sending her running for cover.
“A mind rapist, great.” Clint grunted. He of all the Avengers had a special hatred towards mind control after what he’d gone through during Loki’s attack on New York.
Groaning he struggled out of bed and had just gotten to his feet when Steve came back into the bedroom wearing a pair of too short jogging bottoms, drying his damp hair on a towel, an army surplus T-Shirt tossed over his bare shoulder.
Steve shook his head, sadly, “No. Reed Richards was able to make a portal to this reality. He had to stay behind to man the controls. Everyone else had already fallen, Tony, my Tony, he died a few days ago,” He had to swallow past the painful lump in his throat as he thought of his husband. A hand touched his shoulder and he glanced to the left, seeing Tony offering him a reassuring smile.
Tucking his gun away he turned on his heel and headed back for his car as the street behind him erupted into screams for help and calls for an ambulance.
“Hey Mamma do you think we could make a raft?” Peter asked as they tramped through the woods, “Not a big one of course, but one that maybe one of us could sit on?”
“Damnit!” Steve cursed, “Jarvis, wake everyone, Avengers Assemble.” He paused and looked at Ned and MJ, “You two come up to the Penthouse, you can make yourselves useful babysitting Zach until Pepper gets here.”
He naturally wasted no time in embarrassing Peter as only a parent can with teasing and lamenting how fast his precious little cinnamon roll had grown up!
“Alright D.P, I waited until you had gotten inside the building, just in case you fell and I had to scrape you up off the side walk again like last time, and I remembered to bring the hollow points like you said.”
Without even thinking about it both Clint and Natasha broke the limbs they were holding making the Skrull howl in pain.
The man was thoughtful, caring, deeply protective of those around him, including Tony. Did not feel the need to posture or constantly show that he was the leader.
Rhodey took charge of dealing with the police, since Killian had been a civilian the crimes he’d committed couldn’t fall under military jurisdiction and with the FBI’s involvement due to Zach’s abduction and some of Killian’s crimes having taken place in different states it was going to be a jurisdictional nightmare for the investigating offers involved in sorting out the mess.
Steve flinched as Tony’s hands moved beneath his on the kitchen counter and he looked up into sympathetic brown eyes, “It’s okay,” Tony said to him, “You don’t need to beat yourself up about this.”
“God, he never stops does he?” Tony groaned, shifting Lily who was staring at Deadpool apparently fascinated by his garish costume.
Both had garnered attention themselves, some from some potential cougars and sugar Daddies which was just hilarious, especially when it resulted in both men blushing and stammering excused to get away from the late middle aged, heavily botoxed  men and women tried to flirt with them.
“A nightmare no doubt.” The nurse said derisively, “Nothing a cup of warm milk won’t fix, back to bed with you now Master Stark, you have caused enough trouble for one night.”
With Grace promising to bring the kids to New York for Easter holiday and Harley and Peter exchanging e-mail and phone numbers, they said their goodbyes and the team headed back to New York, arriving in the city just as the news reached America about an attack on London and Thor having returned.
“Hmm, what kind of new ways?” Tony asked running his fingers over the back of Steve’s hand, and looking up at him through his eyelashes,
“Well this is more than Special Steve, it’s perfect.” Tony said hugging and kissing him, “Thank you.”
Gulping Steve nodded, nearly tripping over Kovarian’s body as they went back down the corridor as he couldn’t take his eyes off his daughter.
“Hold on, I’ve got you,” Steve said, gritting his teeth, he was fighting gravity and his position was wrong for lifting which made this all the harder, but he had to do it, he had to get Tony back up onto the landing pad.
“You are sure you don’t want us in here with you?” She asked as she rose and began to put her make up away.
Something impacted against Steve’s shins and stopped dead, looking down to see an adorable curly haired little boy staring up at him from where he was sat on the pavement having run right into Steve’s legs.
“God, sorry, but you, the murderous, manipulative, sociopath saying that you are not all bad, that is priceless.” Tony tried to swallow down his laughter unsuccessfully, “I mean shit, Natasha, or is it Natalie, or Natalia? Just how many people have you killed, maimed, or just plain fucked over? Do you keep a score, put a notch on a bedpost for every life taken?”
I am issuing a prompt for anyone interested. For EMH Steve and Tony's get together that I have described in this fic to be written as a fic. <3 <3 <3
“We don’t have to talk now.” Steve said, “It’s late, we’re both tired and…” He paused and frowned, “Can you repeat that?” He asked not quite catching what Tony had mumbled.
Playfully bopping Lily on the nose with his fingertip, Tony looked up at Pepper, “I think that’ll be fine,” he looked to Steve, “Will that be okay with you?”
Tony scowled and went back to scrubbing his hair, “You are so going to be grounded Jarvis. That’s it, no more Internet Adventures for you, no more surfing cyber space whenever you feel like it. I’m going to transfer your data core into a microwave and you will spend the rest of your life warming food and having your circuits fried when people put metal things in you. And I will put lots of metal things in you! I will forever be shoving my junk into your hole!”
Steve gave a smile as he entered Peter’s room, he was heartened to see that the teen was looking brighter than he had in days past, he was still pale but had more colour than he’d had before, he also had more energy and was engaging in conversations, not just laying in bed or sleeping.
Steve thought it made him look adorable, wearing too big clothes and his hair all floofy since he didn’t have any products to use on it.
“Or you’ll what, ass kisser?” MJ goaded, getting to her feet and shoving at Harry, “What are you gonna do, Daddy’s boy?”
“Its to cover red skin.” Natasha explained, “You should try it over your nose, you have terrible thread veins.”
On his way out of the lab he grabbed some tools that he would need to cut and stitch the Kevlar, and made a final goodnight to the bots before headed back to his room where he hid the tools and Kevlar in the back of his wardrobe and got into bed. Closing his eyes he fell asleep to thoughts of what material he could use to make the rest of his suit in.
“I’m serious!” The billionaire insisted, “I’m brunet, I’m rich, and I have a lot of sex. I will be the first killed.”
“If I may suggest, perhaps you should look up the components of Spider Silk and work from there?” Jarvis offered.
"Peter Benjamin Parker Stark. 10th of August 2000." Peter whispered, his voice hoarse. "Barrack Obama is president, I was adopted by my Mamma in 2009, the Avengers formed in 2012, and I have a little brother called Zach who is obsessed with Doctor Who." He added earning himself a smile from the Doctor.
“Perfectly healthy baby girl, a good weight and length.” The Doctor said as he cut the cord and wrapped the baby in a towel.”
With an ear splitting cry Tony did just that, crushing Steve’s fingers as he did so and feeling something moving out of him, he could hear Steve encouraging him, hear Bruce telling him to breathe and wait for the contraction, hear May telling him it was nearly over, but it was all meaningless to Tony, all he could think of was the pain which was building up again and the overwhelming desire to push had him bearing down and feeling that pressure finally leave him.
“All of your scans have been clear of any growths.” Bruce assured him, “You may develop some of the attributes of a spider, but not the eight limbs.”
“We gotta neg… nega… negotate.” Zach said sitting up, a serious frown on his face as he tried to pronounce the word.
Natasha put on just the right amount of helpless air-head which with her batting lashes and pouting lips worked wonders on the officer. “Say, can you help me find the right place, I’ll bet a smart guy like you knows his way around everywhere.” She gave a girlish giggle and pushed her chest forward, “My Mommy always said that if you get in trouble go to a policeman because they’ll take care of everything.”
Steve made a noise that was somewhere between a laugh and a snort and leaned forward to kiss Tony’s lips, “I love you.” He said, “You, your coffee addiction, and your crazy.”
“Not without breakfast you’re not,” he ordered, balancing Lily in one arm and pushing Tony down into a seat with his free hand, “I’ll bet you haven’t eaten in far too long,”
That could not happen, he would play the innocent dupe act for the media, Stark had done that when Stane’s double dealing had come to light and the world had sympathized for him, well, Norman could do the same, but he had to find Curien and put a muzzle on him, he was the only one who could claim that Norman had known everything that was going on, so Curien had to die.
“Justin Hammer.” Tony said, “I’ve just had to deal with Howard’s old enemies coming out of the woodwork twenty years after his death, I don’t want Peter or Zach to face anything similar. I want Hammer dealt with, permanently.”
“I’ll call Pepper when we get back,” Tony said, as he got into the drivers seat, “Explain to her what’s happened, and get a press conference arranged, the sooner the wolves have been fed a story the sooner they’ll lose interest.”
Tony glanced up at Steve who felt a twist of dread in his stomach, They were late, very late for the meeting, Natasha and Fury should have called them, and if they had called Tony’s mobile then Jarvis would have been able to trace the call as he was linked with Tony’s phone.
Rhodey cursed, “We’ve traced the signals to Miami.” He said, “We don’t know exactly where in Miami but it is coming from there.”
“I guess.” Peter typed feeling a twinge of uncertainty, it was one thing to be planning to do this, but to actually be doing it was daunting. His imagination began to play scenarios where he did everything wrong and someone got hurt or worse got killed, what if he webbed someone to a lamp post and the fluid broke and they fell and landed on their head? Their neck would break or the skull was smash open and then he’d be a murderer wouldn’t he?
Peter sighed and set his pad on the beside table, “Dim the lights Jarvis,” He said, settling himself down to sleep.
“I upset Zach though.” Steve said guiltily, he hated that he’d frightened the young Pup, had made him cry.
“You think he’ll cause trouble?” Natasha asked, startling him a little, as she came up behind him, “This version of you?”
“None of us are innocents.” Natasha coolly stated, “I am a spy, a thief, a manipulator, a liar, and a murderer. Sam and Steve are soldiers, they’ve both fought in wars and taken lives, they have taken more since then in self-defence and the defence of others, as has Tony. We all have blood on our hands, all have stains on our souls, innocence is something that none of us can boast of, including yourself.”
They found that a fear response would bring the fire to the surface, as would anger and pain. Tony struggled with this not wanting to upset or hurt Zach even if it was only a small pin prick on the fingertip, he still hated it. He didn’t like having to see Zach get angry or afraid either, which they achieved by showing him some of the footage of the Malibu house being blown up, or Tony in danger.
While she did not believe that the two of them had acted upon it, she could see the way they interacted with each other, the way they looked at each other. The sexual tension was thick enough to cut with a knife in those photos. They were all but devouring each other with their eyes!
Were it possible Bruce would have choked on his own tongue. Zach frowned again, “Mamma said that Pups and Babies grow in Mamma’s tummies and that Daddies put them in there. He says that the Daddy plants a seed inside Mamma that grows into a baby or a pup, but he didn’t say how the seed gets in there, how does it get there?” terrifyingly expectant eyes turned on Bruce and the Doctor balked.
The Winter Soldier’s arrival in Vienna had made the news within hours, as had his release by the authorities in the Avenger’s care, or rather into Tony Stark’s care.
Christine took a very deep breath, “I am sorry to hear that Mr Stark. I hope that you will soon be out of bed and adapting easily.”
Tony sniffed and nodded, wiping his eyes and let out a shaky breath, “I need to call the Rug-rat, I owe that emotional manipulator.”
The dreams were endless, a cycle of pain and misery, always coming back to the same place, the same moment, the same gut wrenching horror that tore Tony’s heart from his chest.
“Umm, I should point out that the deaths aren’t their fault, that’s on Osborn and whoever he had running that freaking place.” Clint pointed out, not wanting the kids to think themselves murderers. “Investigators have got to go over the facility but from what I saw, considering the epicentre of the blast and the way it blew, it was a self destruct that was set off, not an accident.”
“Oh, no, we don’t have that anymore.” Tony said with a grin, “That went out sometime in the seventies I think, no, Rhodey is only a friend, not my guardian.”
Once inside Steve locked the door and both he and Tony took off their masks, “Hello Doctor, bet you never thought you’d see me again.”
“I understand.” Jarvis said, “I shall remain outside Sirs room and stand guard, two legionnaires shall accompany Master Peter and Master Zach….” He paused noticing Zach’s absence.
"And we shall beat out a new and lasting peace as we take claim to this land and all its riches." Steve declared, "And the enemy shall find that we are very firm in our rule, as we have deep sense of duty." He thrust his hardness deeper as he spoke making Tony keen, "But we shall also be fair and show the enemy that happiness may still be found in their complete submission."
“I never fart, or burp, its undignified.” Tony lied making Steve laugh again, since spicy food made Tony do both. The laughter however eased the tension and they relaxed, settling down in the bed and as he rolled over onto his side Tony couldn’t help but to smile as he felt the reassuring warmth of Steve against his back, the Alpha feeling much the same about the presence of Tony’s body close besides him, well within reach so he could protect him if the need arose.
“You don’t have to go to any trouble just for us.” Steve said, but bagels did sound good, bagels and cream cheese.
“It’s not evil if we share it.” Ned said, “But hey, we could like break into the pentagon and area 51, find the alien experiments and missing minutes from the Watergate…”
Raising one hand Tony fired a gauntlet above their heads hitting the ceiling sending plaster and sparks raining down on them. “The next one makes contact with your skulls.” He growled, “Where is my Son?”
The building should have been vaporized, but thanks to Hammer tech being as shit as it was that hadn’t happened.
“No!” Tony panted, sucking in loud labouring breaths, he struggled against Steve, tears running down his red cheeks and sobbing as Steve held him tight, turning him so his face was pressed against his broad chest.
“That won’t help him, not emotionally.” Natasha said, “We need to get through to him, speak with him so he’ll see sense.”
Steve wasn’t sure if he was joking or not. MJ was a nice if slightly terrifying girl that Tony was pretty sure Peter had a crush on. Steve thought Peter was a bit young for crushes, but was reminded by Tony that he was a teenager now, crushes on girls and boys was to be expected. It was just another reminder that Peter was growing up, way too fast as far as Steve was concerned. It didn’t seem any time had passed at all since he was first sitting on a sofa in the mansion watching Doctor who with Peter and Zach, but now Peter was adolescent and getting interested in girls.
There was blood all over his hands. Blood soaked his sleeves all the way to the elbows. It was damp in places but dry in others, cracked and peeling off in flakes that fell to the floor. It was cacked under his nails, thick meaty like rolls were packed beneath the skin and the nail bed.
“It’s okay.” Tony said wearily, “You go on to your room and I’ll sort Zach out.” He patted Peter’s shoulder as he went past and even gave him a smile but it didn’t stop Peter from feeling guilty for causing so much trouble. He looked up at Steve his miserable expression giving away just how shitty he was feeling.
“Do you fink Steef would mind if I called him Daddy?” Zach asked looking up at Peter with those impossible chocolate brown eyes that could ensure he got away with murder.
“Shush, you’re not traumatizing them, you are protecting them, protecting the world. You are making them very proud of you,” Steve lifted Tony’s chin so the Omega was looking up at him, “You are not to blame for any of this, this is all on Killian and his insanity, please don’t blame yourself because of him.”
“Oh let him up, its already a circus in here, with loud mouthed, inappropriate, heavily armed, dominatrix wannabe’s” Tony cried, waving his hand dismissively,
“Tony Stark has a heart condition and has to show some caution in what physical activities he engages in. However, it does not mean he doesn’t give it his all.”
“Yes you do.” Steve said, “And work on controlling your temper. You’ve got super strength now, most Teenagers can lash out without causing much damage, you no longer have that luxury, so you’ll need to control yourself far more than others.”
“This was your fault Tony.” Steve rasped with his dying breath, gazing at Tony as he stared at his dead and dying son, “You should have done more. You could have saved us, instead you killed us.”
“Not yet.” Tony said, “Rhodey’s on a mission as far as I know, I don’t want to pull him away from that if we can help it, and I’d rather have the Hulk guarding my boys, I don’t fancy anyone’s chances of getting near them with Big Green watching out for them, as for Clint… Jay, it might be an idea to give Barton a heads up, let him know what’s happened so he can lay low. Hell, he might even have an idea of where Natasha has gone.”
“I doubt much would shock Mamma.” Peter said, “But I appreciate it.” He then surprised Steve by reaching out and hugging him tight, “I love you Dad.” He said fiercely, “I love you and Mamma so much.”
He may have gone a little (Completely) crazy on the nursery, creating a zoo of stuffed toys, along with a rocking horse, rocking chair, custom built crib, and of course a changing station. He even hired artists to come in and paint the walls in murals of a tropical rain forest, with a bright sun, sky and clouds on the ceiling, and built a nightlight for the baby that would have the milky way dancing over the walls and ceiling.
A week later Tony held a sobbing Peter against his side as the boy wept for his Uncle and Aunt. He pushed his face into Tony’s side as the Priest said the final prayers over the coffins and threw dirt down onto them.
“Doom can go fuck himself.” Clint spat turning his arrows on the dictator and his bots which began to bear down on them with increased fury. These were more advanced than the ones they had been fighting.
Clint looked at Sam, Sam looked at Clint, then the two of them speed swum over to Thor and simultaneously yanked on the crocodile tipping Thor off the side and crashing down into the water.
“You have had a knee replacement and we have pinned your tibia, you will need to begin physio within the next few days. That will be painful but the joint has to be used or it will freeze up. You will also be visited by rehabilitation who will help you adjust to having only the one hand. Prosthetics can be looked into in the future but for now the stump has to heal.”
Crouching low, Tony approaches Steve, who is standing so still, he looks afraid to move. He’s still frozen in place when Tony gets close enough to nose his cock, but that doesn’t stop the low grown spilling out of him at Tony’s actions.
He slid down to the floor, breathless, but unable to stop laughing, even after Tony’s bare foot starts cradling his erection. He feels so good it’s no time at all before he comes as well. It was a completely stupid first time with Tony, but Steve kind of liked it.
The reincarnation of Min was dressed in a white shroud, a feather crown was tied to his head with a red ribbon, but it was his eyes that gave Steve pause. Behind the kohl smudged eyes, he could see that it was Tony. He had an otherworldly glow to him, but there was no doubt it was him. Steve stared in wonder.
Ultron’s commands are humiliating, but never painful. For the most part they’re simple tricks that seem mostly to be for his amusement: sit, roll over, play dead,
He raised his arms and shouted, “Soon Captain America will be a slave to Min’s desires and we will be rewarded for our devotion!”
But Tony’s mind comes back to him when he notices Steve’s cock swelling within him. His heart stutters, terrified, but regardless his body clamps down on it and then they’re locked together. Steve shivers and releases a stream of hot jizz into Tony, more than any human should be capable of releasing. It fills Tony up and leaves him shaking in orgasm.
Tony’s hand on his head brought him back to reality, he felt less nervous now. His face was guided closer to Tony’s crotch, and honestly he was starting to get a bit turned on. Right in front of his nose there was an image of him as Captain America distorted by Tony’s huge cock underneath the fabric. His cock was just barely stuffed in; Steve could see the simple elastic band pulling away from his skin due to its size and weight. It filled out in response to Steve’s heavy breaths.
When they return to Tony’s room, it is fresh, clean, and Steve-less. Ultron says something about seeing him again next time, but all Tony can focus on is the soft cushion left in his place. It’s a poor consolation, but as the days and weeks go by and he stomach grows, he appreciates it more. He’s learned to live for the simple joys in life.
“You may resent me for pulling your fangs now, Captain, but I’m certain you will enjoy your new purpose. Don’t you wish to reunite with your former teammate?” Ultron asks, turning Steve so he will face Tony.
He took the thin cotton into his mouth, sucking at the member beneath it. He licked at the printed Captain America and used his nose to nudge Tony’s balls until he was also fully erect. Steve took in the sight of Tony’s cock straining at his panties, the fabric nice and transparent from his spit.
A band slides across his neck and clicks closed. When he moves his head, hears a jangle as the tags hanging off of it hit each other. “I’ve domesticated you, shaped the wolf into a dog.”
“I’ve been thinking about dogs lately. Man’s best friend. So loyal and easily trained into obedience,” Ultron says as he drags Tony over to the Cradle.
Ultron pats Tony’s head as he finishes eating. “Humans. Despite how you struggled to bring logic and reason to your lives, you were never really beyond your baser instincts, were you?”
He casts his gaze further down and realizes his legs have been similarly twisted into a new shape- shortened thighs, elongated feet. Between them there is something that is definitely not his dick. It curls forward from behind him, long and thin, and feels awfully like a tail. Underneath he finds a vagina. His breath comes in heaving pants and his eyes flick between everything as he tries to make sense of it.
As expected, Steve still has a bit more height and muscle on Tony, despite the modifications. He’s also been allowed to keep his penis, though it looked as if it had gone under modifications as well. He has a collar that matches Tony’s, the front most tag, reading simply “Stud.”
Tony opens his mouth to tell him to cut the bullshit, but all that comes out is a sharp whine. The sense of wrongness deepens as he tries to clear his throat.
“See? Isn’t this better?” Ultron says when Tony comes. Tony shakes his head and the onslaught of pleasure continues.
Steve allows Tony to push him on to his back and maneuver his body so that hot thick member could slide into Tony’s snatch. It’s larger than anything Ultron put inside him, but instinct urges Tony onward as Steve keens and bucks up into him. Soon there’s nothing left but animal grunts and the slap of flesh against flesh.
But eventually it comes to an end. They don’t spend all their time fucking with fevered urgency and are content to just lay together. Just as some sense returned to them, Ultron comes to take Tony out for a walk.
“Yeah.” Steve huffed looking a little bewildered by how much and how rapidly his life had changed. A few months ago he’d been an isolated, lonely man, displaced in time and unsure if he’d ever find his place in this modern world. Now he was in a loving relationship, had two beautiful boys he thought of as Sons that were treating him as their Father, and had a close knit family of friends around him.
“Got yourself a get out of jail free card.” Tony said taking a seat beside the doctor who was pulling away, trying to sink into the pillows and mattress. “Its nice to see that karma got hold of you even if the law didn’t.”
“We’ll set up a bed in the lab.” Jarvis said, “I can have everything ready by tonight, and I will monitor you Sir.”
“But only when there is absolutely no other choice.” Steve coldly stated, he had a hard look in his eyes when they turned to him, “I know all about the sacrifices of war, Agent Romanoff, more so than you, and the action taken by your employers was wrong.”
Every act of torture, every atrocity Steve had ever seen he would visit on the bastard who’d done this. Not an inch of their body would be untouched, not one bone, not one fingernail or patch of skin would be free from his wrath. And then, at the end, when they were beyond begging him for mercy anymore, he would hack their mutilated body into small pieces and burn them into the earth spelling out Tony’s name one last time.
Tony’s eyebrows shot up to his hairline, “Beguiled you?” he repeated, a grin briefly passing over his lips before he became serious again, “Why didn’t you say anything?”
“Pleasure.” Steve said, then he frowned, then he looked at Tony’s trunks, he blinked and looked again. No, he was not imagining things, there were Captain America shields on the material.
Skilled at flirting and making small talk, Natasha easily navigated her way through the crowds keeping one eye on Bruce and the other on Clint.
They found Steve on the river bank, he’d been dragged out of the water, along with his shield and left laying on his side. Someone had put him in the recovery position before they’d left him, ensured that he was breathing and not in danger of choking on his own vomit.
“I don’t know. He retired from all that, and I respect that. God knows he’s earned it. But he’s too young to just kick back and do nothing, he needs an occupation of some sort. With his skills he would be excellent as a head of security. Happy is mostly working for Pepper now, and Clint could find all the blind spots in security and give advice on how to secure them, he works well with a team, and he isn’t a yes man,”
“Thanks MJ that means a lot.” Peter said trying very hard not to think about the feel of her body against his, he really didn’t need a boner right now!
Tony managed to stammer out a brief explanation for Steve as the two of them ran down to the garage and jumped into the nearest car. Tony instructed Jarvis to let the other's know what was going on as he put the peddle to the floor and screeched out of the garage.
Curien paled, a remarkable feat considering how low on blood he still was. He fumbled for the call button but Steve snatched it from his grasping hand and held it out of reach.
Nodding his head, Bucky quietly made his way to the living area and sat back down in the same chair, picking up the menu and scouring the breakfast choices. The full English was something he recognized. Eggs, Bacon, Sausage, tomatoes, baked beans, and fried bread. The Cereal choices were new to him beyond the corn flakes. The waffles sounded good, as did the pancakes, the croissants he wasn’t sure about, and he didn’t think he’d get much energy from the fruit salad. The smoked salmon dish made him feel a little queasy, fish wasn’t a breakfast dish as far as he was concerned.
Happy waved his hand, “None taken Captain, I’ll drive you over to Brooklyn, anywhere you need to go Thor, Dr Banner?”
This came from Steve as he returned from lunch with the boys whom had been taken out in the city for a while to burn some energy by Sam and Clint. Tony was still on liquids only, something he was complaining about every time the slop (As he was calling it) got brought to him and so far no one had been kind enough to liquidize a pizza for him. So as not to torment him, the others had gone for their meals elsewhere, so they wouldn’t be adding to Tony’s dietary woes.
Giggling maniacally, Wanda approached Tony, taking sadistic pleasure in the fear she saw in his dark eyes, “Now,” She purred, as she reached him, “Why don’t we take a little look inside your mind?”
The name meant nothing to Steve, but he couldn’t afford to turn away potential information right now.
“Good point.” Tony agreed turning back to Lily who was frowning at her feet and trying to reach for them, “Its all still so simple for you, isn’t it, little miss?” He asked, “The biggest concern you have is learning a new word and being able to grab your feet, isn’t it?” Lily grinned at Tony and let out a giggle, “Yeah, and pretty soon you’ll be learning to crawl and we’ll be running after you, trying to keep you out of trouble, and then you’ll be walking and we’ll be breaking our necks to try and keep you safe, by which time you’ll be talking and saying everything we really don’t want you to say and getting into so much trouble that we’ll be going grey and probably bald from worrying about you so much. Because that is what happens to people with kids you know?” Tony nodded to Lily who giggled at his serious face, “Having kids makes them grey and bald, but you don’t care about that do you? All you care about is having fun,” He lifted her up so she was over his head and made whoosing noises as if she was flying, making Lily squeal in delight. “Which is just how it should be.”
“I’m sorry Thor.” Steve said, clasping Thor’s shoulder, “I know how it feels to loose your Mother, how the pain strikes in your heart as fierce as a fist that feels as if it would shatter your heart completely.”
As the evening drew in Clint called the team together and gestured proudly to the conglomeration of dishes he had made.
He didn’t remember where he was when he first opened his eyes, then the events of the following day came back to him.
Tony shook his head, it was a lie, he did feel sick, sick with himself, he was disgusted with himself.
Steve went and stood by Peter putting an arm about his shoulders as they waited for Maya Hansen before the lift. Soon enough the doors dinged open but before they even got a word out both he and Peter were hit by darts fired from some kind of plastic pistol, the kind that kids played with and fired suction cup bolts from, no doubt so it could get through the metal detectors.
(Which he had not been, there had been several female Beta’s and Omegas that Obie had enjoyed while being married to Tony)
Tony had bought the evening wear for the team; because, he wanted them to have really nice clothing, but also because he knew that if they were wearing anything other than tailored designer brands, then the society vultures they were going to be mingling with would rip them to shreds.
The lab was pretty empty, mostly the surfaces were clear, which marks where equipment had previously been, but there were still interfaces and Tony grabbed a couple of tablets from the family room on their way down to the lab, along with a sheet of paper and a pen, which he shoved at Steve.
A hard slapping sound reached Tony’s ears, then the right side of his face bloomed with pain and he tasted blood inside him mouth. His brows knitted together in confusion. He didn’t understand. Why could he taste blood? Why did his face hurt?
“I’m sorry?” Steve said half glancing at her and hurriedly looked away, the woman wasn’t pleasant to look at; the skin of her face was pulled too tight, her eyebrows slanting up too much and her eyes looked permanently surprised, her mouth was made up in a far to bright shade of lipstick for anyone to wear, let alone a woman in her seventies whose skin tone had begun to fade regardless of cosmetic treatments, it was also overly plumped up with collagen and looked far too big for her face.
They all went to see the Christmas tree in Washington Square Park and went skating at the Rockefeller Centre. Zach wasn’t quite coordinated enough to skate alone, so everyone took it in turns to support him as he skated around the rink.
“STEVE!” the most insistent tone of voice woke Steve up enough to stop what he was doing and he stared down at Tony, his eyes widening in shock,
Tony rolled his lips, “But how can I ever make up for mine?” He asked in a small and shaky voice and a single tear rolled down his cheek, “After all I have done how can I ever make amends?” Steve softened, he stretched out a hand to Tony, who sat up to take it,
“What the fuck?” He whispered staring down at himself, that felt like…like…but that was…he couldn’t be…pregnant?
“I just don’t want to lose you.” Peter said, “We saw it on the news after the phone cut off, we saw you fly through the wormhole and we waited, it felt like forever before you fell back through and it didn’t look like you were alive.” His voice had started shaking and his eyes were shining with unshed tears, “I thought you were dead! I thought you’d gone and left me like everyone else!”
They actually made Steve feel a little bit more secure about his outfit as they checked in and went to the suite.
“Who’s that, is that Barton? Hey featherhead, flutter your saggy ass down to Miami and meet me there, bring agent sociopath with you.” Tony called.
Damn Pepper and her good memory, damn her for being so smart. Damn his hormone frazzled brain for not being smarter about this.
There was so much staining the water that it was no longer capable of cleaning him anymore, he had to pull the plug and rinse the sink and then run a fresh basin full, yet it was still not all gone, there was still more to be wiped from his face, under his chin, down his throat, squeezed out of his clothing, and scraped from under his nails.
Rhodey’s laughter followed him to the lift as Steve headed after Tony, leaving Rhodey to wrangle the boys once they’d finished unpacking and got bored and/or hungry and came out of their respective dens to terrorize the local neighbourhood in search for amusement and food.
“He’d better be. I am.” Tony said. He’d not helped the kids make the volcano beyond providing the materials and answering any questions they’d had, this was a project they’d put together themselves after they’d seen a documentary on the historic eruption.
"Hi." Tony replied slipping his hands down Steve's torso and dipping them into his shorts, "Are you up for some maneuvers?"
With a small smile Natasha cut in, “Putting levity and Stark’s pyromaniacal tendencies aside for the moment, I think it would be best to stay on track?”
“Go to hell!” Tony screamed and clenched his fists as the next contraction came. He wanted to stop this, wanted to keep the baby inside him where it was safe, but he couldn’t, his body was ready to deliver, the baby was ready to come into the world, there was no stopping it.
Tony snorted and made his way to the kitchen to find the flour, eggs, milk, and blueberries to get a start on breakfast. Sending the boys out with Happy would keep them distracted while he dealt with what Shield wanted, hopefully he could be home in time for dinner.
Peter, who’s hands were resting on Clint’s shoulders slowly fell away to hang limp at his side. He glared at Clint, worrying at his bottom lip before he sniffed hard and spoke. “You’re stupid.”
“I guess that one more day wouldn’t matter.” He said and felt elated as a smile lit up Steve’s face, and he knew he’d made the right choice. Lily apparently agreed as she gave a squeal of delight and grabbed her feet, sliding down the pillows and laughing as she landed on the mattress on her back with her limbs in the air.
“He has a normal metabolism, your burned through the drugs faster.” Bruce said. “His pulse is strong, his breathing is normal, he’s probably just going to sleep for a long while and then wake up with one hell of a headache.”
As they approached the base, the War Machine armour broke off with the Iron Man armour and Sam in the falcon suit and they flew towards the base ahead of the jet, targeting Hydra vehicles and taking down the perimeter fence. There were long range canons that Friday took great pleasure in blowing to kingdom come and a couple of tanks as Rhodey took out but which time soldiers were pouring out of the base, only they were met with red energy from Wanda who descended from the air, tossing them aside and clearing a space for Clint to set down so Natasha and Steve could disembark.
Shakily, Tony stepped out of his trousers and then doubled over as another cramp hit him, this one too strong to ignore and he cried out, falling to his knees and clenching his fists as the pain shot through him.
“We told him no but he doesn’t listen.” Bruce offered trying to appear innocent in the insanity, as if he didn’t have a tablet and hadn’t been calculating the best angles for the bots to aim their arms.
Zach nodded his head and wiped at his cheeks with a dripping wet arm, he frowned and looked around, “Why are we in a fountain Uncle Thor?”
“Sergeant Sam Wilson, 58th Para-rescue, former.” Sam said, “Did two tours, now I’m working down at the VA.”
“Lady and gentlemen I have eyes on the prize.” He said tapping on his suit which broke away from him.
The guards nervously looked at one another, weighing their odds with hand guns against Tony’s suit, “I’ll count to five.” Tony said.
It wasn’t helped by Steve asking him if he knew about the birds and the bees or if he needed another showing of Steve’s Sex Ed videos.
“Yes,” Steve answered, “His name is Pietro Maximoff, he and his sister Wanda are both enhanced, they are unfortunately still at large and are to be considered very dangerous.”
“Okay? Dude this is the most awesome and cool thing ever!” Ned exclaimed. Peter made an inarticulate noise in his throat and leaped at Ned, the two of them falling over the sofa in a hug. MJ huffed and rolled her eyes at the pair.
“I would like to keep you alive really.” Doctor Curien said, “But…perhaps, since Iron Man and the Avengers may indeed come looking, it would be better to just take samples and perform an autopsy before we discard you.”
"The twins are to face simulations of battle against the Avengers." He ordered his Second in command. "Have them facing heavily armoured soldiers, tanks, and airborn drones. I want capable of facing multiple threats at once from various locations."
“Not the time.” Rhodey called back, “I need to stop Tony from doing something he’ll regret, like killing Romanoff and Rogers. No matter how much they might deserve it.”
Steve and Thor ran to where Hulk had landed finding the Iron Man laying prone on the ground, Steve tore the face plate off revealing Tony’s lifeless face.
“Please.” He said sucking in a breath and choking back the pain in his throat as the phone rang and Happy answered.
Scraping together what was left of his pride, Steve left the lab, deciding to go and take a look around for himself. As much as he didn’t want to admit it, something wasn’t sitting right with Shield.
“Get up here stellina.” Tony said patting the side of the bed, Zach didn’t need telling twice, he quickly scrambled up and lay down beside Tony, his head on Tony’s chest and little arm stretched over his stomach.
As carefully as they could they got Tony onboard the jet and moved to secure the stretcher to a gurney.
“Indeed, we will need a great deal of fire power in order to take down such a vast army.” Vision said, “From what my data banks recall, Manhattan was nearly destroyed by just a very small portion of Thanos’ army under the command of Loki.”
He'd been making progress before Steve’s arrival, getting through a fair amount every day. But since then he’d been preoccupied with developing tech for defence against Thanos, making overtures to the other heroes, and most enjoyably, spending time with Steve and Lily. (And fantasizing about Steve) but he wasn’t going to focus on that part, because it just led to him needing to spend some alone time in his bathroom.
Due to his age Tony and Steve did not feel comfortable with him becoming an active member of the Avengers until he was older, they wanted him to enjoy his childhood first and not take on such responsibility. Peter however, as many teenagers do, felt differently to his parents, and became determined to prove himself. He has become somewhat of a vigilante, on several occasions he has fought off muggers, thieves, rapists, and drug dealers over the city. He also decided to investigate Oscorp and the Oscorp Factory on the Nassau county border.
At the time Steve had thought that was for the best, still not being entirely convinced that Tony wasn’t responsible for Ultron, but now, after Wanda’s revelation he knew better.
“Has there been any sign of the asshole?” Sam asked Jarvis who brought up different images, showing a military vehicle driving through the streets of Novi Grad. Strucker’s face could be seen in blurred detail in the back seat as the vehicle sped along.
“You should.” Tony said, “You’re young, you need to get out there and meet people your own age.” He rolled his eyes at the grin Steve gave him, “Your actual age, not the age your body is from your ice nap. You’re a hell of a catch, you’ll have Beta woman, and Omega’s fighting over you.”
Before they continued to discover just what abilities Peter had developed, the most important thing was to get Peter’s sense under control so he could go back to daily life.
“On a bright note, our stock had risen fifteen percent since the Gala.” Pepper said, “And they are holding steady. Your own popularity has risen too. The last resentments over Sokovia have dried up and the focus is on the good you have done since becoming Iron Man.”
“The Plaza,” Clint replied, “Why..” his eyes widened when Rogers turned, going back to the lift, “Hey, Cap, I really don’t think that you should… Interrupt them tonight,” he finished, as the doors closed while he was speaking, “God fucking damn it!” Lily giggled from the floor and Clint shot her a pained look,
“Sir likes to plan ahead for the safety of those he loves.” Jarvis explained, “He has similar plans for Colonel Rhodes, the Rhodes family, Pepper Potts, her family, Eric Selvig, Darcy Lewis, Jane Foster, Bruce Banner, Sam Wilson and his Mother, and yourself Agent Romanoff.”
“Vi, sweetheart, I’ve just been speaking to Arthur, I had no idea that your Son had remarried, and don’t you look radiant tonight, red really is your colour.”
“That, and make sure that on said date night, you are clean and presentable, and that you show up on time, not on Tony Stark time, which is three hours late.”
“Good.” Strucker purred looking back to the sceptre, “The Avengers have claimed too many victories in America. They thinned our forces, hobbled and humbled us, but we are not yet on our knees, and with this gift from the Gods, we shall rise again stronger than before.”
Killian grunted but let go of Tony’s throat and turned to see Maya holding a hypo to her own neck, one filled with enough extremis to kill herself with.
Tony’s brain was going through a complete short circuit, he couldn’t think beyond Steve’s lips upon his own, how soft they were and how tenderly he pressed them against Tony’s own, the scent of his skin, how smooth it was, not silken but smooth, like genuine velvet, and how large his hands were, how strong they were, how capable and powerful, they could crush him with simple flick of the wrist, but he was holding Tony as gently as one would spun glass.
He was older than his own Tony had been, in the mid-forties, rather than his thirties. He was smaller too. His Tony had been six feet tall, his chest and shoulders broad and muscular.
“It doesn’t matter if he can walk or not, he’s still gonna be my Mother and you’ll still love him, right?” It shouldn’t have been a question, but Peter was asking it as a question, was making sure that Steve wasn’t going to walk away now that Tony was disabled. “You are still going to marry him and be a father to me and Zach, right?” Peter’s voice broke at the end and fresh tears filled his eyes waiting to run down his cheeks.
The Maximoff Twins had been the only ones to survive the exposure to the sceptre, their bodies accepting the enhancements and becoming Struckers prized pets. Pietro Maximoff had developed immense speed, being able to move faster than the human eye could see and earned himself the code name Quick Silver. Wanda Maximoff had developed psychic and telekinetic powers. She move objects using the force of her powers, which glowed a brilliant blood red earning herself the name Scarlet Witch. Her psychic powers were even more devestating.
Peter flushed, being called Spiderbaby, PreciousPeter, and Sweet-Cinnamon-roll-Stark was not exactly badass, but he had to admit he liked the I <3 Zach Stark tags.
“That’s quite alright.” Steve said, “People often don’t recognise me out of uniform right away.” That much was true, the uniform and shield were the first things that people saw when it came to Captain America, it often took people a few moments to recognise him in civies.
We just some of the questions Zach was asked by practically a school full of entranced children, only a few kept their distance from him, their parents prejudice too engrained in them to give Zach a fair chance. It didn’t matter to Zach, he had more than enough attention around him and his friends had greeted him with hugs, happy that he was back with them again.
The armour closed up and blasted off the ground, heading back for Stark Tower. Very carefully, as if he were afraid that Tony might break. Vision lifted him up bridal style, while Steve hitched a lift with War Machine again.
Now though, Zach was getting older, he needed more activity, more to occupy his growing mind and help him develop. Tony could keep him entertained with colouring books, children’s stories, and toys for now, but that wouldn’t last forever, Zach was growing more energetic and adventurous by the day, he’d already climbed over the gates in the play pen twice, giving Tony a heart attack. Thankfully Jarvis had alerted him the second he’d done so, so Zach hadn’t gotten anywhere near the equipment in the lab which he could have seriously hurt himself with, but it had shown that Zach was getting bored, the play pen wasn’t enough for him anymore and the Lab was no place for a Pup that young.
“This isn’t like you Petey.” Steve said, “You never get violent, so what happened to trigger it, did Harry attack you or something?”
He’d been certain nothing could compare with that, nothing could faze him anymore, not until Jarvis called over the com in what Steve could only describe as a chillingly frightened tone.
Steve only left to go back to the tower, shower, change his clothes and pick up fresh clothes for Tony to wear. Tony would then wash himself in the sink in the bathroom, change his clothes and then hurry back to the Peter's side.
“Ooohhh Dopinder, my fluffy teddy bear, snugglebunny!” Deadpool exclaimed, actually bouncing on the balls of feet and clapping, “Hey, send him right on up, miss In the Ceiling Voice thing.” He looked to Tony, “That is so cool, by the way, that you have a voice in your ceiling. Is that like a Billionaire thing? Do all Billionaires get this when they reach Billion in the bank?” He paused and the mask on his face seemed to frown, “You don’t have a vertically challenged person up there do you? Because that is just wrong. Everybody knows, that little people have rights theses days, Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit was very educational, and really high lighted the plight that those of a smaller stature face.”
Steve shook his head, “We’ll figure it out.” He said too in awe of his new son to think of anything at the moment.
That was how Steve felt as he carried what seemed like the umpteenth take away to Peter’s hospital room.
“Understandable.” Steve said. There was no guarantee that Peter would be welcomed by his classmates, some may fear or resent him, he might become a target for bullies, or be ostracized. It was not something either Tony or Steve wanted for him and they hoped it wouldn’t happen, but they also wanted Peter to at least have a chance of returning to as much of a normal life as possible.
“We are a little busy here, in case you haven’t noticed,” Steve said, sarcastically, and Rogers glared at him.
After that things went worryingly silent and the adults were foolish enough not to worry until it was too late and Zach was riding around on a wooden crate that now had a lawn mower engine fitted to it and skate board wheels and was being remote controlled by Harley and Peter who had used cannibalized an old remote control car for the parts.
He kept jumping his knees and locking his fingers together, shifting nervously and casting glances at Tony, looking as if he wanted to say something or ask something only for the words to die on his lips and then he’d go back to squirming.
“The test revealed that you have been effected by the gamma radiation that the spider was exposed to. Zach obviously figured that as it was radiation it meant you would become another hulk.” Peter snickered at that.
“I won’t tell anyone.” Steve promised wishing he could be with Tony, wishing none of this was happening. “Call me after you’ve spoken to this woman and don’t go after this guy alone; you’ve got a team now, we’re all here to support you, you don’t have to do this alone.”
They were in Vienna and were going to address the UN. Or rather Tony was going to make his case to the UN and attempt to get permission to launch laser targeting weapons into space and have them take up synchronous orbit about the globe to be used to deal with Thanos and his forces when he came calling.
“Still not fair.” Zach said turning over and scowling at Tony. His face was red and snot and tears were on his upper lip and cheeks from where he’d been crying. “Why can’t I be with him, why does he have to be grounded, he said he was sorry.”
“What the hell, Tony?” He cried, rolling away and springing back to his feet, taking up a fighting stance.
Peter waited an hour, listening out with his senses until he was sure that Tony was asleep, then he got up and headed for the lab, jumping out of his skin when Jarvis asked him what he was doing and groaned as the Bots came out of their charging stations curious to see their visitor in the night, which for once wasn’t their creator.
Seeing this Tony, displaying the same kind of self-conscious uncertainty as his Tony had during those horrid weeks, made Steve want to offer the same comfort he had his Tony. But he couldn’t do that, this was not his Tony, so far as he knew, this Tony had no interest in men, could be in a relationship with someone else. So, instead of going over to Tony and wrapping his arms about him as he longed to do, Steve offered a warm smile,
Once everyone was done eating they set off in different directions to carry out their activities, making plans to convene back at their make-shift camp late afternoon for ice creams and a came of beach ball.
The boy was sat up on the hospital bed looking lose and alone. As a parent it broke Tony’s heart and the guilt was like acid in his gut.
As Tony watched, Jarvis created a physical representation of the proposed harness. It would fit rather like a corset or the breast plate of a suit of armour, but be far less restrictive.
Chuckling Steve texted to say he was on his way, “Everything alright?” Pepper asked as she came onto the stage.
“I want to.” Steve said cutting Tony off mid babble. Tony paused momentarily silenced by this admission.
The sounds of screams, sobbing, and choking echoed around the barren, dying earth, screams of people, of animals, of everything as it burned into ashes.
“What stuff, what’s this about?” Peter asked, he pushed himself up into a more upright position, wincing as Espresso’s claws sunk into his thigh and protested against the movement.
Norman snarled a curse as he saw Curien get hit by the car, he couldn’t follow the man, not without risking exposure, he just had to hope that the idiot bled out before help reached him, or that the car impact had killed him.
Steve nodded but didn’t look convinced and he mentally planned to ask Rhodey anyway, official guardian or not, Steve was pretty sure Rhodey would take War Machine to him if he hurt a hair on Tony’s head.
Steve arrived first, looking very handsome in his suit and didn’t even acknowledge Clint’s wolf whistle.
That was just the way things were, some people got violent and no one said anything, you just learned to avoid certain people when they’d been drinking, or knew to keep your head down and pretend to be invisible around them.
“Yes…YES!” Tony shocked Vision by throwing his arms about him and kissing him on the face, “God I love you, you genius brain child!”
Steve whimpered and gazed up at the ceiling, begging for mercy as Tony made himself comfortable upon him, rubbing his nose into Steve’s chest and smacking his lips quite contentedly, it would have been a perfect scene, a perfect moment, had Steve not had an erection about to explode. He looked down at Tony, wondering if he could move the Omega, but one look at that relaxed face and Steve knew he couldn’t do it. Tony didn’t get enough sleep as it was and Steve was damned if he was going to disturb him for something as trivial as this.
“Honestly I don’t know how you manage to avoid getting arrested.” Steve said after they went through the third one.
The Fantastic Four, The Defenders, and the X-Men all agreed to an alliance in the event of another world threatening danger.
Steve made an inarticulate noise, “I’m sorry.” Tony said, “I was going to tell you, I just, I wanted…”
As he came out of the tent he was greeted to the glorious sight of Steve Rogers with his shirt off digging a fire pit several feet away from the tents. He had the sun behind him which cast a golden glow on his skin, highlighting his rippling muscles and firm flesh.
Tony opened his mouth to tell the Doctor not to let them in, but it was too late, the boys came bursting into the room, rushing to him and grabbing his hands, scrambling up onto the bed to kiss and hug him. Steve was not far behind them, gently lifting Zach down from the bed and popping him into a chair reminding him that he had to be careful with his Mother right now.
Steve however read the situation, quickly he scooped Tony up bridal style and carried him to the bathroom, set him down before the toilet supporting Tony’s weight and held him as Tony doubled over and vomited into the bowl.
All of the steps had been taken out and replaced with slopes, the bar now had a raised platform he could roll up onto, as did the kitchen counter.
Tony looked at him in surprise but Steve’s expression was impassive, “Jarvis kept me updated, you’ve been suffering nightmares with frequency since Sokovia, ones that make you sick or give you panic attacks.”
After they’d finished they talked for a little longer before Natasha and Clint decided to head back to Shield for debrief, promising to update the others as soon as they could, Zach was falling asleep on Tony’s chest so they Billionaire went to put him to bed, asking Happy to show Steve, Thor, and Bruce to various guest rooms, apologising for the mess as he and the boys had been in the middle of moving into the tower, something that would have to wait until it was repaired.
“Yes, the gooiest sweetest chocolate cake ever.” Tony promised him, “And I’ll bet that Uncle Happy will make you pancakes every morning if you ask him nicely.”
“Well, you are probably the person he can most relate to.” Tony said with a shrug, “You are an alternate version of his best friend. It might make him feel more secure, having you here.”
Tony made his way over to Steve and lay himself down besides him, “Thank you for breakfast and for the lay in.”
“It’s likely Zach’s been taken by the Mandarin.” He said shakily, “I have to find this fucker, there has to be something connecting him here, he’s been blowing shit up all over the place.”
“It was disorienting in the extreme.” Steve said, “I woke up to a world with wide plasma screen TV’s, mobile phones, and the internet having gone down when most homes still didn’t have a telephone line and only the very rich could afford a TV which had a tiny black and white screen.”
Tony and Steve parted ways in the lift, sharing several lingering kisses before they headed to their own floors and to bed.
“I suspect many things, Agent Romanov, but I rarely act without evidence to support them.” Fury countered, not really answering her question at all. “As I’ve said, his blood work is being done, we’ll have more answers once it comes back.”
“His white cell count is abnormally high. Yet he showed no signs of prior illness or injury, not even a minor infection or virus that his body could have been fighting. He also responded to treatment with far greater speed than would have been expected. Remarkable speed in fact.”
Sam set the Quinjet down on the roof of the hospital where the trauma team were waiting to meet the Avengers team.
"As this secondary force subdues the enemy on this side, we shall begin our dangerous descent into enemy land, where we shall subjugate the enemy and batter down all defenses."
Natasha still had her hands pressed firmly down on Clint’s side slowing the bleeding from where he’d been shot. The archer was pale and there was a layer of cold sweat on his skin but he was conscious and could move under his own steam.
“On it babe.” Tony called back finding his way into the battlements of the castle and took out soldiers in his path, with Jarvis’ help he found the power source for the energy shield and fired missiles at it knocking it out, “The draw bridge is down people.”
“Morning people.” Peter said as he came into the kitchen, he stopped dead when he saw the leaning tower of pancakes that Clint was making a start on, “Um, why is Clint trying to give himself heart disease?”
“The Arc Reactor compresses my lungs, I only eighty percent lung capacity.” Tony explained, coughing and gulping in air, “You’re on top of me. With a lot of weight on you.” Which was compressing Tony’s chest all the more making it harder for him to breathe.
“Hell no, school and College first.” Tony stated, “If you start running around in a cowl and spandex then I’m going to officially loose all my marbles and become a dribbling idiot in a corner.”
He knew Tony was struggling, not knowing exactly how to help his Son; the ice cream trip had been partly to get Zach out of the tower to Tony could speak to Pepper and see if she had any advice for him.
Finally Zach, his precious baby boy, burned and charred, struggling to draw in air through his blackened and blood spattered lips as Tony fell to his knees and reached for him.
“Oh God, oh no, I’m sorry!” Peter whispered as tears pricked at his eyes. With trembling hands he felt for a pulse in the man’s neck but couldn’t find one. With a couple of tears running down his face Peter gently closed the man’s eyes and made himself step away from the body.
“This kid. Harley Keener, saved my life.” Tony declared, his voice echoing as he used the microphone. “I crash landed in Rose Hill after my house in Malibu was attacked by the Mandarin. My suit was damaged, the systems trashed, I had no money on me, nothing but the clothes I stood up in…” He paused and shrugged, “And the poncho I stole off a statue.” Some of the kids giggled at that.
Over the dinner Steve was able to get to know Bruce better, learning more about the man rather than just the rage monster and the shy scientist who tried to keep to himself. Tony had certainly taken a shine to him, calling him his “Science Bro” and Steve wasn’t jealous, he wasn’t jealous at all, no sir. He did not feel even the slightest twinge of the green eyed monster, at least, that was what he continued to tell himself every time Tony beamed at Bruce or made a science Joke that only the Doctor could understand.
“Should we be concerned that the twins may make another attempt on Tony’s life?” Natasha asked resulting in another growl from Steve.
“I wasn’t listening.” Tony added, and Steve just rolled his eyes, and got back to work, introducing the Doombots to the business end of his shield, with Thor roaring over head and taking great pleasure wrapping the Bots around Mjolnir. Hulk is leaping from building to building snatching bots out of the sky smashing into his fist or each other.
“People, that’s enough, this is a discussion for another time and place.” Natasha cut in, “Now where are you taking us, Sharon?” She asked as Tony sat back in his seat with a huff and scowl.
“I am unsure.” Jarvis said sounding rather apologetic. “But he insists that he come home right away.”
“Uh huh, back in school my friends say maths is hard but it’s easy.” Zach said, mayonnaise smeared over his lips and dripping down his chin, his happiness dimmed slightly as he thought of his friends and the school he was separated from.
“In the Caribbean Sea. Not far from the Caymans.” Tony replied, “The villa isn’t that big, you’ll have to share rooms, but there’s gorgeous beaches, crystal clear sea, and some good hiking across the cliffs.”
The UN gave a unanimous vote of agreement to Tony building the weapons to guard the planet stipulating that they be given half of the command codes needed to trigger them, and that the remaining codes be held by Tony and Vision.
Tony turned his head so he could look up at Steve, “I’ll work with Jarvis and Bruce, we’ll find the energy signature and stop this.” He shuddered, “I have to stop it, I can’t keep on seeing that.”
“I regret I have lost contact with Sir.” Jarvis replied, the AI sounded worried which sent a jolt of fear through Steve.
This served to shut Tony up for the moment, but that moment was brief as Alexander Pierce was named.
Steve disposed of the soiled condoms, quietening his Alpha which raged against the use of protection wanting nothing more than to fill Tony with Pups.
“Considering the appetites of our team I’m thinking a seven tier cake minimum.” Tony said looking over some very elaborate and decorative cakes smothered in icing, marzipan, cream cheese, and chocolate.
“I’m well old enough to be your Father, Peter, and yes I do mean it, and if I wasn’t almost completely naked I’d hug you, but as I am I’ll keep a discreet distance.”
“The orange hides dark circles under the eyes.” Tony said, he had a ton of his under his eyes and concealer was now being painted on.
In the end Clint flew home on the Quin jet with Sam and Natasha to get some of Nate’s clothes that he’d out grown, while Pepper, Laura, and May began making calls to get a cot, baby bath, nappies, and changing mat to hold them over until the stores opened up again.
“Please, I learned to drive in WWII, if I can make it across landmines without blowing a car up I think I can handle a porche.” Steve scoffed.
Putting their masks back on Tony and Steve headed out of the room and to the lift passing the police officer on the way, the man look dazed and had lipstick smears on his face as he went by them.
Steve’s hand suddenly wrapped about Tony’s and he looked into the fiercely protective gaze of his Alpha, “We’re going to fix this.” He said, “Jarvis and Bruce will find a way to neutralize her abilities.”
“I suppose I should be thankful that Dr Dumbass hasn’t sent me anything.” Tony said with a roll of his eyes, he was actually very touched by the amount of well wishing and gifts he was receiving.”
“Oh God, Pete!” Steve whispered, he pulled back from Natasha and spread his arms, Peter needed no further encouragement and flew into them, burying his face into Steve’s chest and clung onto him tightly. “I swear I will never leave you boys or Tony.” Steve said holding onto Peter’s slender body, “I love you all far to much to ever leave you.”
“Isn’t there anything we can do?” Steve asked, reaching up and taking hold of Tony’s hands, tugging him around so that the Omega came and sat in his lap.
It was deathly quiet in the penthouse, everyone was just holding their breath, waiting for Tony to go on, waiting for him to tell the rest of the story.
“Okay, I have the phrase “Having kittens” but I’ve never seen it in reality.” Tony said looking down at the ginger fur ball that Zach was cuddling, “Explanation?”
They waited and waited, Happy went and got food for Pepper, Rhodey, and the boys, Zach fell asleep on Steve’s chest, Peter was dozing off with his head on Steve’s shoulder and everyone had fallen into a silence as they waited, then finally the consultant came into the waiting room.
He could do this, he could be Spiderman, and once he proved that to his parents he would never be treated with kiddie gloves again.
“Screw you, Stark!” Clint groused, his cheeks flushed pink, “Like you could do better in the kitchen.”
“Time to go home,” Tony said, with another forced smile, he opened the car doors, and helped Steve fold up the pram, and settle Lily into the car seat, securing her for the home journey.
"We have sheer slopes to ascend, smooth faced and prone to tremors that may throw us off as we attempt to climb higher." Steve's teasing fingers walked up Tony's thighs and onto the cleft of his buttocks. "We then face the peril of the twin peaks, the smooth globe like planes which we must cross, before we can venture into the depths of the dark crevice where lays the heart of the enemy territory."
His new hands are mangled, unusable things. He could never hope to build anything with them again. His fingers were shortened and rearranged almost like a paw. When he turns them over he finds pads on the bottom. His shoulders feel tight, like his range of motion has been limited.
Ultron’s words help it all click into place. The damn bastard is being literal. He turned Tony into a dog, or part of one anyway. He isn’t covered in fur and his face didn’t feel particularly canine, but not much else seems untouched.
Aharon El-Amin finished chanting and announced to the room, “This interloper will be the first offering to our great god! May he serve him well.”
Steve is fighting him with flailing limbs and angry howls, but as Tony has seen through the cradle’s glass, Steve’s gone through many of the same changes as Tony. He doesn’t know it yet, but he is as much Ultron’s dog as Tony is.
“Gone are your fangs: your lying tongue, your dexterous hands, your logical mind,” he says, pulling Tony from the Cradle and carrying him out of the room.
The contrast between the childishness of the underwear and what lay beneath it was oddly erotic. Steve was completely hard now, he tried to care that all the cultists could see his erection, but he was too fascinated by the half hard cock in front of him. He decided to help it along.
page was filled with him, his face, his hands, his workshop. Steve swallowed hard, his fingers twitching with the urge to shut the book because this suddenly felt way too intimate, like Tony was looking right into his soul –
Steve chuckled, using his grip on Tony's hand to swing him around and right into a kiss. Tony smiled, wrapping his arms around Steve's neck to get even closer before he remembered. "Wait, I want to show you –"
The thing was, despite Steve's impressive speed at adapting to the twenty-first century Tony knew he still held a lot of old-fashioned values. One of which was that alphas were tough and had the primary job of protecting the omegas of the world. Which was all well and good, but sadly seemed to translate to 'alphas aren't allowed to indulge in prissy things like soft sheets or a warm bath'. Add that to Steve's pragmatic nature and him growing up poor during times of rationing, and Steve had basically developed an inherent distrust of any form of luxury or frivolous pleasure.
“And that’s a bad thing?” Tony jumped at the pinch in his thigh, chuckling as he pulled them both to their feet. “Alright, alright. Let’s go.”
Bruce looked up from his newspaper across the table, a dreamy sort of haze clouding his eyes before he seemed to shake himself out of it, giving Steve an apologetic smile. “Sorry. No, nothing yet.”
- The Avengers know about their relationship and support them. All of them live together in the tower.
“Hey, no, don't apologize,” Tony said immediately, grabbing Steve's arm on reflex before he looked down at it, comprehension dawning in his eyes. He stroked his hand across Steve's bicep. “Can you feel that?”
“It's not?” Steve's voice sounded small even to his own ears and Tony's eyes flashed as his grip tightened even more.
Tony moaned, and Steve jerked, choking on a groan as he started moving in time with Tony's rhythm, not quite fucking his mouth but also not quite
Steve shucked his clothes a lot more methodically than Tony, his skin burning with anticipation. A part of him still couldn't believe that this was happening, that Tony was not only okay with this but actively helping him solve the problem. Actually, in hindsight he should've expected this. Tony loved coming up with solutions for everything.
, like a dam opening that let whatever it was spill forth, and Steve groaned like he was dying, his hands scrabbling all over Tony's neck and shoulders like he was desperately trying to hold on.
Yes, it went through last Tuesday. We plan on forwarding it to the UN council for review as soon as it has finished making its rounds through legal channels.
Steve's eyes were closed, but Tony could feel him take a shaky breath as Tony pressed another chaste kiss to his lips.
For a long moment they were locked in a silent staring match. Then Toni took a shaky breath. “That was so fucking cheesy.”
“Yeah, well, you're not the one who has to respond to all your admiring fans demanding to see your throat stuffed.”
“Amazing,” Tony breathed, a little in awe of what just happened, before he looked down and froze when he noticed the wet patch on his gown, right over his crotch.
Tony clung to Steve like a limpet, burying his head in Steve’s neck as his anger fizzled out into an overwhelming shame. He’d acted like a complete asshole tonight, and nothing would ever justify taking his frustration out on Steve who was nothing but kind to him and always made things better.
Steve shook his head in fond exasperation. “Maybe just tea then. I feel like I shouldn't encourage your bad habits.”
The pace Steve set was brutal and uncoordinated and better than Tony’s wildest dreams. He barely had to move at all, his arms wrapping around Steve’s shoulders when Steve sat up for better leverage, hooking Tony’s legs over his arms and just fucking him on his cock like he weighed nothing, both of them panting for breath. Tony couldn't stop staring at him, at the way Steve's lips formed unsaid words as he pounded Tony, his eyes closed and his fucking
“No, no, I like it.” Tony was a little surprised by how much he actually meant that. “There's a stigma against nice guys. But you seem like one of the good ones.”
“Not fair,” Steve gasped out between sobs, clutching at Tony so hard he'd probably leave bruises. Tony couldn't care less. “She was your aunt, she – fuck, you shouldn't have to –“
“Holy fuck, Steve,” Tony said, and right as he started to pull out Steve held him back, his heart pounding in time with his cock, creating a sensation that went beyond anything he'd ever felt before – “Steve? What are you –“
A part of him wanted to throw it out without even opening it, but in the end curiosity won out and he grabbed a pair of scissors, cutting away the wrapping paper before he laid into the tape holding it closed. He pulled the carton apart, scooped out the layer of protective foam and –
Steve grabbed the large, square couch pillow and held it out to Tony who pushed it underneath the pie tray, getting it level with his cock. He heard Steve suck in a breath as Tony grabbed his dick and stroked it to full hardness, anticipation getting him there faster than usual.
Steve was shouting something, but Tony couldn't make out the words over the ringing in his ears, his mind quieting down until there was only the beat of Steve's heart, pounding through him with every suck, leaving him breathless.
Tony flipped through the book, slowly at first, then more and more quickly when it became apparent that
“Would if you were to describe my smile as such,” Vision sighed, propping his chin up on one hand, and Steve sincerely hoped he never had to see that look on Vision's face again once Vision fell back out of love with Bruce. Bruce who was still giving Steve the most disturbing version of heart-eyes while Sam kept bumping his elbow in his efforts to aggressively feed Bucky. Who was trying very unsuccessfully to get on one knee in front of Wanda as curls of red magic kept pushing him back onto his stool.
To Steve’s credit, he immediately took responsibility when he was told about his social faux pas and started wearing scent blockers like everyone else. Tony didn’t know if he was relieved or disappointed.
And Tony came with a shout, clinging to Steve like he'd die if he let go, his chest aching in the most beautiful way as Steve kept pounding into him, chasing his own orgasm now. It didn't take long for Steve to follow him over the edge, and Tony jolted when Steve put his mouth on his chest as he came, pressing a deep-chested groan right underneath the arc reactor.
Steve pressed his lips together for a second before he spoke. “But that's exactly my point. You were used by an organization that decided what your next mission was going to be. How is that any different than the –”
Steve's mouth twisted unhappily, but he did lie down on the bed next to Tony with an air of abject misery. Tony scooted closer, and Steve stiffened for a second before he wrapped an arm around his shoulders, pulling him into his chest. The skin on skin contact made something in Tony purr with satisfaction. They were both only wearing boxers, since neither of them would want to waste much time on getting naked once they were in the moment.
Steve's shackles had just enough give for him to brace his feet, and Tony gave himself a mental pat on the back for that foresight when Steve made good use of the leverage he had to fuck Tony with enough force to make the bed frame rattle. There was a knot of heat somewhere low in Tony's gut that sent licks of pleasure throughout his entire body every time Steve's cock filled him up to bursting. Tony could barely breathe through how good it was, the feeling of being so totally overwhelmed, coasting on the pleasure that was just on the right side of too much.
Steve's face shuttered as he grabbed his things, standing up from the table. “Don't make fun of me right now, Tony. This isn't –“
“I can still feel things,” Steve said a little evasively before he shook his head and took the plunge. “But only when it's – hard. Lots of pressure.” He squeezed his hands together until his knuckles stood out white. “I can't feel normal touch. I mean, I know it's there, it just – it feels like it's – foggy. Or like there's padding in between. I don't know.” He sighed. “I'm so sorry.”
His stomach tightened when one of Tony's hands crept up until it was just barely teasing to slip underneath the hem of his shirt, tracing the edge of his waistband. He could feel his muscles twitch with every caress, his cock jumping when Tony traced the dip near his left hipbone while his other hand scratched very lightly over Steve's crotch. Then dug in deeper, hard enough to make goosebumps break out all over Steve's arms.
Tony moaned, the sound sending prickles of heat down Steve's spine, and a second later he felt Tony's thrusts getting erratic, losing their rhythm as he came inside Steve, filling him with heat –
Is this entire fic just an excuse for me to look up Dodger pics at this point? Possibly. I hope you enjoy this one <3
“He was thirty-six, not eighteen, Toni,” Pepper said firmly. “And why is this coming up now? You've been going out with younger guys for years and you never had a problem with it.” That wasn't quite true, but Toni wasn't going to correct her. “You being one year older isn't going to make a difference. So if you really want him –“
Steve's tongue felt like sandpaper as he looked up at Tony, not quite daring to hope. “What are you –”
“That's great, Tony. I'm glad you do.” He leaned in close with a glance at Steve. “No funny business, right? He didn't touch you?”
Steve gave a strangled laugh, every muscle in his body pulled tight with anticipation as he watched Tony take him in hand and squeeze.
, alright,” Clint said, finally tilting his head and catching the bottle when Sam waved a hand at him with a disgruntled look. Clint took his ten dollars with a flourish before he plopped down on the couch opposite Toni, giving her an obnoxious wink. “What does ten dollars buy me at Stark Industries? A hair comb? A custom dildo?”
Steve's palm came down in the exact spot he'd struck the first time, and Tony almost choked on the moan that was trying to claw its way out of his throat. “Eleven,” he gasped, all but squirming with arousal when Steve shifted just enough that Tony could feel how hard he was through his pants. Knowing that Steve was getting off on this just as much as him was its own sort of pleasure, the kind that made his chest swell with warmth and his blood sing.
“I’m looking forward to it, Mr. Stark!” Steve called after him, and Mr. Stark turned back to give him a grin that made Steve feel a little weak in the knees.
“Don't come... clo-rghh-ser...” Tony gagged, voice cut off by the vine now wrapped menacingly around his throat. Steve saw red, lurching forward with coiled fists.
idea, but then one of the vampires moved forward and Tony reacted on instinct, turning his head to sink his teeth into Steve's neck.
“You don't eat enough,” Sam mumbled under his breath, not looking at either of them as he piled bacon and toast onto the plate, inching it a little further along the table so it was sitting more in front of Bucky than Steve now. “Damn supersoldiers, getting on my last nerve.”
“It's beautiful,” Steve said in awe as soon as she parked the car in its intended spot, overlooking the city view just outside the windshield. “Wow.”
"For your viewing pleasure," Tony announced loudly, swinging his arm out as FRIDAY opened the compartment on his cue. "Let me present to you: The Liberty Man!"
“Okay, stop.” Pepper closed her laptop, setting it to the side before she turned to face Toni. “What's this about? You've never had a problem with what the paps write about you.”
“Okay,” he forced out, closing his eyes and gripping his cock the way he would if he was touching himself alone.
Tony chuckled tiredly, feeling the urge to pat Steve's hair again, but his arms still felt like jelly. “I don't think I can move.”
“Hey, it's as real as we need it to be,” Tony said, nuzzling Steve's neck and humming when Steve returned the favor, hugging him close. “I'm just glad it worked.”
, his fingers sliding up Tony's spine, fluttering down his sides, squeezing his thighs. It seemed like he couldn't stop touching Tony, couldn't get enough of Tony's skin under his hands, and Tony would be lying if he said it wasn't a huge ego boost.
“I guess so.” Tony slid into the passenger seat and buckled himself in as Obie started the car, pulling out of the parking lot. “Maybe we'll have more luck at our dinner next Saturday, hm? Think you could give it a chance now?”
“You're amazing,” Steve said so earnestly that Tony's smug grin faltered for a second before he felt his lips pull up in what had to be an absolutely sappy smile.
Steve bit his lip, looking down at the doll's firm asscheeks, and suddenly all he could see were the almost invisible seams of its silicone parts, showing all the places where the mold hadn't quite overlapped perfectly. The skin was too flawless, without any dimples or moles, and when he looked back at the hole wrapped around his finger, its sharply cut, unwrinkled edges didn't seem all that appealing anymore.
In the interest of allowing as many of the Avengers as possible to continue their work I suspect there will be an element of persuasion necessary. I'd prefer it to come from inside their ranks.
“And you're sure this is going to work?” Steve asked dubiously as he watched Tony lay out the supplies on their nightstand, both of them already naked. “Because if not I can always –“
“You’re more trouble than you’re worth, you know that?” he said. The doll just kept lying there, its pants askew from where Steve had rubbed himself off against it the day before. He sighed.
“Well.” Tony laid his head back down on Steve's chest, rubbing circles into his tense stomach. “We'll deal with it when it happens. It's gonna be fine.”
Steve was getting hard again. He laughed hysterically, trailing off into a moan that vibrated all the way down into his core where he could already feel another orgasm building. This was insane. Steve had no idea he could still
Tony blinked. Then he laughed, so hard his stomach cramped with it, and Steve joined him halfway through until they were leaning on each other for support, holding each other up.
It wasn't exactly new, this thing between them, but until recently neither Steve nor Tony had had much time to spend on each other. So now it almost felt like they were making up for lost time, learning each others' bodies in all the elaborate ways they hadn't tried before. And, well -
“Guess not. God knows they don't have any decent resources in that backwater dump of a country.” Tony very carefully bit his tongue, glancing around the room for a possible way out of this conversation. “Still, I am very impressed. Those long range missiles you built? Brilliant. My boys always said you could stake your life on Stark weapons. Unlike that Hammer shit they give us nowadays.”
to. Tony's teeth lengthened to a point he hadn't even known was possible, and something inside them just –
“Already?” Steve asked incredulously, his voice getting a little quieter as he probably turned his head to check his watch. “It's what, 9:30?”
“You're not wearing underwear,” he said like it was a revelation, and she chuckled as she pulled him into another kiss that made her toes tingle.
"Yeah. First step, make you look like James Barnes again. Get you as far away from the Winter Soldier image as possible. I already asked Helen for skin grafts, we're gonna make you a flesh glove and –"
fault! Why are you –“ His breathing hitched when Tony slowly slid down his body, reaching back to line Steve's cock up with his ass. Steve was trembling, his muscles so tense that they felt like carved marble under Tony's hands, obviously trying to hold himself in check this time. “Tony –“
Tony stroked him faster, pulling out every little trick that he knew would push Steve over the edge, rippling his fingers over the glans, adding pressure to the tip, swiping his thumb over his frenulum – but Steve didn't come.
Steve groaned when Tony tightened around him, his whole body clenching up at the feeling of Steve's mouth on his swollen skin, tugging on him in a way that sent bolts of pleasure all the way to his cock. He was far too pent up to last long, and Steve didn't seem to be faring much better, so Tony closed his eyes and really let himself
“Besides,” he said slyly, winking when Steve's eyes snapped to his. “Who's to say that being suspended from field duty means you can't be there?”
“Don't worry, we'll take care of that,” Tony said with a wink, getting up and holding out a hand to Steve. “Do you trust me?”
"Sam," Steve said, his voice torn halfway between surprise and embarrassment, and Sam quickly shook his head before he snorted and hid a smile behind his hand.
Steve twitched, his stomach churning with abject horror when Tony nodded to himself and braced his arms, like he was going to pull away –
“There are many ways of sharing pleasure with someone,” Tony purred. “For as long as you touch me, my body is yours.”
“Tony,” Steve said again, taking a step forward as Tony turned to him. “I'm sorry that we kept you in the dark for so long but we couldn't contact you without someone knowing –“
“You really can't reach, can you, baby?” Steve crooned right in his ear, and Tony gasped when Steve's grip tightened around both of them. “Dick too small to fuck, how are you ever going to make me come? Look.”
“Huh?” Tony could barely pull his focus away from Steve to acknowledge the rest of the room, his thoughts moving slow like he was treading through molasses. Steve made a soft noise, and Tony honed in on it like a beacon, desperate to do
Tony felt his lips curl into a smirk as he leaned onto the table, tucking his hands under his chin. “You want me to tell you all about it? The nights were pretty cold, you know.”
“Can I –“ Steve didn't finish asking the question before he leaned down and buried his tongue in Tony's ass, so deep that Tony's knees went weak. He could already feel the familiar clenching in his loins that meant he was producing slick and as he got a good whiff of the pillow Steve had been laying on it wasn't hard to tell why.
Steve was on his feet in an instant, grabbing his shield from where it was propped up against his chair. “Where? What's going on?”
“Mr. Rogers, it's a pleasure to meet you,” someone said, but Steve's eyes were locked on the figure in the corner, an exact clone of the doll Steve had at home –
“I have an idea,” Tony said abruptly, inhaling and exhaling very slowly before he tapped one of the leaves. “Okay, hentai plant. I know there's no way that you'll let me go just like that, so how about I just let you do whatever you want to me?”
Steve stepped up to the table, taking a deep breath before he grabbed his cock to line it up and push into the tube. It was a little tricky to find the opening since it was so small, but once he managed it he slid in with one push, the lube easing the way.
“Here you go,” he said cheerfully, and Tony thanked him with a smile, slipping him an extra five dollars. Steve didn't talk on their way back over to the studio, and Tony didn't really know how to break the sudden tension between them. Damn it, this was usually so easy,
“No, I seriously want to cuddle.” Tony reached for Steve as soon as they were both naked, pulling him down as he lay back on his mound of pillows, fitting perfectly into the indent he'd created there earlier. All according to plan.
They kissed for what felt like ages, but Tony still made a noise of protest when Steve pulled away, turning onto his back and guiding Tony over to lay his head on his shoulder. It brought back memories of a thousand nights falling asleep just like this, comfortable enough that Tony couldn't even find the will to complain about Steve ending the kiss.
It took a long while before Steve finally made it through his orgasm, and by then he felt boneless, wrung dry, like he'd been wrapped in cotton and filled to the brim with hot water.
Toni raised her hand, knocking back the rest of her drink in one go before she set it down on the table. “Alright, boys. Let me show you how it's done.”
Tony shifted so he could sit in Steve's lap and couldn't suppress a whine when his sore ass rubbed against the rough fabric of Steve's jeans. Steve made a small noise, and Tony was suddenly very aware that they were both still hard, remembering what Steve had said before this all started –
Tony was greeted by the smell of pasta as he opened the door to their floor, his stomach churning before he even saw Steve. It took a moment before he could raise his eyes from the doorknob and by the time he looked up Steve was standing right in front of him, his face unreadable. Tony opened his mouth, not sure what he was going to say, when Steve suddenly stepped forward and wrapped his arms around him.
They arrived at their private lounge arm in arm, greeted by loud laughter as Clint tried to balance a beer bottle on the tip of his nose. He was actually succeeding, the asshole.
Steve snorted a laugh, laying his head on Tony's shoulder as he finally accepted that he might be able to keep this, as impossible as it seemed. Still, he had to ask. “Are you sure about this? You know this means we can never have normal sex, right?”
It was a little dry, but the cream filling felt amazing on his cock, and Tony had no trouble getting himself off humping the thing. As Tony was throwing the ruined cake away he had a moment of clarity where he wondered what in the fuck he was doing, but in the end it didn't faze him all that much. After all, what was one more reason to feel like a perverted piece of shit in light of all of the other things he'd done.
“Let's try that again, shall we?” he asked, not giving Steve the time to doubt himself before he sat back on Steve's cock, going as slowly as he could without it being a blatant tease to Steve. He felt a triumphant grin spread across his face as the backs of his thighs finally pressed against Steve's hips, his ass settling in Steve's lap without any discomfort this time.
“What do you say we make it even nicer, hm?” she asked quietly, her eyes dropping to his lips, but before she could move in for a kiss, Steve used his grip on her shoulder to keep her right where she was.
“I assure you, Mr. Stane, your charge is in excellent hands. I wouldn't ask if it weren't absolutely necessary for the diagnosis.”
“Wherever you want me, shnookums,” Tony said with an obnoxious wink, the moment of tension already forgotten, and Steve grabbed the cups he'd prepared on autopilot and followed him to the couch. JARVIS put on some music in the background as they drank their coffee, talking about this and that. Steve really tried to play it cool, hide the nervous energy that he could feel tingling just under his skin, but eventually Tony put down his cup with a sigh.
"You could've said that earlier," Steve grumbled, his arms wrapping around Tony from behind while he fiddled with the shower head. Tony snorted.
“His dick wasn't even that nice, Pep,” he said with an eye roll as he sprayed cheese onto his nachos in thick ribbons. “It's not worth a post. Trust me.”
He grunted when Tony dragged him back by the hips, hands scrabbling against the table as his head spun from the sudden lack of pressure on his cock – and then Tony thrust into him, pushing his cock back into the tube and oh god, he couldn't stand it, he was going to fucking
So they kept going on dates, and eventually Tony let Steve take him to his room and make love to him. Steve was almost painfully gentle, like he thought he might break Tony into a million pieces if he so much as looked at him wrong, and Tony took great pleasure in training that out of him, teaching him how to touch Tony exactly the way he liked. Steve didn’t have much experience, so Tony had the great privilege of learning Steve’s body alongside him, finding all the ways they could bring each other pleasure.
“I still haven't forgiven you and you've clearly been avoiding me just as much as I have, so you obviously –“ Steve swore he saw something almost like hurt cross Tony's face before he seemed to steel his face back into a disinterested mask. “Love isn't even a factor in that. Hell, if you had a choice you'd probably never see me again and yet here we are, so if you could fucking snap out of it that would be –“
“Thank you,” Steve said faintly, his head thumping onto Tony’s shoulder as soon as Helen was gone. “Oh my god.”
Steve alternated between both cheeks, leaving enough of a pause for Tony to recover from each hit before he struck again. He wasn't putting in a lot of force – they both knew what that could look like – but just enough that after the tenth strike Tony's ass already felt pleasantly sore, his cock fully hard now and throbbing with each hit.
“Fuck me,” Tony said, and he could see the exact moment that Steve's control snapped. Steve seemed to stop breathing for a long moment, all of his muscles tensing at once, before his hips snapped up into Tony's so hard that he almost knocked him over. Tony didn't even try to meet his thrusts, just held on for dear life as Steve finally let his body take what it needed.
. Because clearly me helping you through this rut is our best possible option right now.” Steve averted his eyes and Tony sighed. “Look, neither of us know what's going to happen. With the serum – I mean, maybe we're lucky and it weakens the effects, or maybe it enhances them, I don't know. But either way I'm not going to let you suffer alone.”
“That's exactly what I'm saying. But you'll hear all about that after the trial is over.” A woman in the front raised her hand and Tony nodded at her.
“Not with me,” Tony said, his eyes narrowing suspiciously. “You seem weirdly... okay. With all of this.”
The truth was... it was a really good snuggle companion. But Steve would rather die than admit that he’d been cuddling up to a sex doll at night these past two weeks. Clint would never let him live it down.
Steve groaned, muscles tightening as he tilted his hips up for better leverage, and Tony traced his free hand over his pecs, making them jump under his touch.
“Still not far enough, sweetheart,” Steve tutted. “Come on, you want me to feel you, right? So I can come even though your dick isn't big enough for me?”
Scott looked at him with unconcealed awe and Steve had to fight down a wince. Usually that look was reserved for people he'd just pulled out of an open fire. “You'd... wow, for a second that sounded like you –“
“That was your idea,” he said with a smile, something in him seeming to relax a little, and Toni crossed her legs as she leaned against her mother's old desk.
Tony hummed, burrowing his head in Steve's chest and scratching his beard across his pecs to make him chuckle. "You son of a bitch, I'm in."
He wrapped his arms around Tony's shoulders when Tony lifted him fully off the ground, walking a few steps backwards before he sat down and urged Steve to straddle him on what Steve only tangentially realized was the tree stump he'd put his clothes on earlier. He was much too distracted by how far he had to stretch his legs to fit them over Tony's thick thighs, feeling almost a little exposed until Tony dragged him closer and – oh.
The UN has utmost confidence in this new Avengers team and looks forward to our continued cooperation.
“Not anymore!” Tony rubbed his face against one and hummed approvingly, carrying his two armfuls towards the elevator. “I'll get new ones!”
“Throw you down on top of the nearest available surface and have my way with you?” Tony asked calmly, and Steve swallowed.
“Rea– No, of course you have,” Steve said a little ruefully, giving him a small smile. “What did he say?”
Steve laughed under his breath, pulling their blanket over both of them. He pressed a kiss to Tony's hair, and Tony couldn't help the sappy smile that stole its way onto his face when Steve traced ILY into the skin just below Tony's ribs.
He ignored the camera shutters as he took his place on the podium, sitting down in front of the center microphone. Pepper gave the usual 'Please ask about this, don't ask about that' speech while Bucky found his seat and Tony waited until she was gone before he looked up at the crowd and smirked.
A shiver works its way through Tony. He shakes his head in denial, but the food sits heavily in his stomach. He practically ate from Ultron’s hand after a mere few hours without eating. It’s as if he can think no further than filling himself when faced with a meal.
Tony crooked his finger to beckon Steve over, and he followed without a thought. His limbs were still clumsy, so after taking a few lurching steps to reach the throne, he collapsed onto his bare knees. Tony leaned down and whispered in his ear, “Play along, help is coming.”
Tony curls in on himself and cries himself to sleep when he finishes, but it doesn’t stop him from unhesitatingly scarfing down the next bowl of food Ultron places in front of him some hours later.
“You’re my first bitch in fact. I can’t give humanity a new beginning without good breeding stock after all.” Ultron’s cold metal fingers press into Tony’s new pussy. Tony quivers at the sensation, stirred by budding arousal, even as he feels sick to his stomach at the realization of what has been done to him.
Tony attempts to stand as soon as Ultron is gone, but he quickly tumbles back to the floor. He tries again and again to stand upright on two feet, but his body would not obey him. It wasn’t built to walk like that anymore.
“You know, somehow I didn’t think about how gay a cult of men worshiping the god of boners was until I saw Captain America sucking off Iron Man,” Clint said, thoughtfully.
Steve was dragged over to the dais, where he was stripped and laid on a bed of lettuce for some reason. He wasn’t sure if he was about to be eaten or raped, but he’d fight every step of the way. The paralysis was already starting to wear off. He tensed, ready defend himself at any moment, then he finally got a good look at Min.
“Why don’t you just get it over with and kill me?” Tony sneers. He’s struggling futilely against the robotic arms that hold him, but he’d lost long before Ultron dragged him to Cho’s lab, when Ultron reclaimed his newly-constructed body and succeeded in wiping out the majority of life on earth.
Tony begins to notice that a soft fuzz has grown over much of his body. It looks strange, but almost right for Tony’s body as it is now, stuck half-way between animal and human. What’s worse is the way Tony can feel his mind slipping away under the force of mind-numbing boredom and pleasure.
Finally using his hands, Steve fumbled at Tony’s cock, trying to pull it free. Tony helped him and he sucked it up with loud slurp the echoed around the chamber. Steve is rolling Tony’s dick around in his mouth when he noticed that he was shaking. Worried, he looked up to see that Tony was smothering laughter.
Steve leaned in closer to give the illusion of obedience to their watching audience, a little sick at the thought of doing such things in front of so many people. They hadn’t even gotten a chance to do it privately. Then Steve nearly burst out laughing because Tony was wearing Captain America underwear. They must not have changed his underpants because he really couldn’t imagine the cult putting them on Tony. It was a little unexpected, but also extremely Tony.
They spend ages touching each other, looking at each other, trying to communicate something, anything, through their eyes. After a moment of relief that was much closer to grief, Steve’s expression turns angry. For a moment Tony fears it is directed at him, but Steve casts his gaze towards the door Ultron closed behind them. Tony understands, but isn’t quite capable of drumming up the same ire anymore.
Tony struggles, but Ultron is unrelenting as he drags Tony from his cell. He takes him through the halls to the lab where the cradle waits. Tony renews his struggling, certain Ultron is going to make some new change to him.
He looked around. He was embarrassed to find help had come when he wasn’t paying attention. Natasha had Aharon El-Amin down on the ground, SHIELD agents were handcuffing cultists, and Clint was staring at Steve and Tony.
“Humanity took the wolf and plucked it’s fangs, made it softer, safer for them. You used evolution as a tool to turn killers into pets.” Ultron says, pushing Tony inside the Cradle. “I aim to do the same.”
Tony is halfway through his food before he feels a tongue at his hole, lapping up the leaking seed. Before Tony could blink, Steve is a weight upon his back and his prick seeking entrance. A heavy thrust presses Tony’s face into his food as he is breached.
Tony holds his breath as he waits for Steve to make up his mind. He’d been fucked silly on top of Steve’s sleeping body nearly every day, but he never actually thought about what to do when the man was finally awake. Is he angry at Tony for creating Ultron and allowing him to kill so many? Would he be disgusted by what Tony’s become? Would he think Tony deserved it?
It seems like now that they started fucking, they can’t stop. Steve mounts Tony while Tony’s sleeping, Tony attempts to ride Steve while Steve’s trying to relieve himself at the drain (and gets pissed on for his trouble.) Ultron doesn’t bother them while they go at it, just providing food and water on a regular schedule.
Tony’s lost count of how many times he’d come when Ultron finally decides he’s satisfied. The experience has left coating of bodily fluids on both the glass and Tony. Tony doesn’t really have any strength to resist when Ultron carries him over to an industrial-sized sink to wash him in warm water. Ultron walks Tony back to his room clean and dry.
. Each command followed earns Tony a piece of dried fruit, which is dazzlingly sweet compared to his regular meals. Obediently completing a full session means being taken to see Steve. Tony can see his progress in the cradle while Ultron plays with Tony’s hole.
Steve goes still at the sight of Tony and Ultron shoves him through the door. It slides shut before Steve can get to his feet. Steve whines as he looks between the door and Tony.
He burst into the central chamber; the cultists were all circled around a dais in ceremonial robes with their left hands jerking themselves off and their right hands holding a flail. The Cult leader stood at the foot of the dais, chanting. On the dais there was a throne backed with the statue of a white bull, Cap could see a man slumped in the seat. This place was also guarded by giant serpents; they came slithering out of the shadows. Cap struggled as they coiled around him.
He doesn’t think twice about doing as Ultron says, it means good things, usually stimulation for his pussy, which aches all the time now. When Ultron isn’t there, he rubs himself against the wall and floor, vainly seeking relief in that small amount of friction. It’s the only activity he has to occupy himself while in his room.
Steve growls as one Ultron hold him down and another clips a lead to Tony’s collar. Ultron has to pull Tony along because he keeps looking back at Steve. Ultron taunts him for it, but the words mostly go over Tony’s head.
The days quickly fall into a routine of food, walks, and orgasms. Ultron philosophizes seemingly without end on humanity’s future as his pets and Tony learns to tune out most of it by the end of the first week.
