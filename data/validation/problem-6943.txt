Stark was rich, there was no question about that. He was carefree, if his disregard for SHIELD protocols was any indication. Steve didn’t know about the promiscuity but he couldn’t really see anything wrong with it if all the participants were willing. The inch-thick report on Steve’s desk said Stark was narcissistic, abrasive, proud, and had a tongue that could cut people twice over before they even opened their mouth. Difficult to work with. Controlling. Demanding. And half of those could be used to describe Steve himself and none of it told him who the man really was.
“That get-up doesn’t prove anything,” Natasha said slowly, head turned back towards Cap. “It could be a look-a-like. What’s something only the real Captain America would know?”
Five minutes and a laughter-induced stomach ache later, Tony is wrapped around Steve, head pillowed on his ridiculously well-muscled chest.
Spengler greeted him with a frown, nose wrinkled underneath wire-rimmed glasses. “Tony, what did you do to the Trap?”
Tony gives a shout of laughter, and then his shouts turn a little less innocent as Round Five begins in earnest.
Tony stumbled backwards, eyes wide, but nothing came flooding out, not even the cosmic light of the interior of the Trap. He looked back up to Spengler, confounded.
And then he froze. Because this was not something he would do. This was not something he should do. This was not something they have done. This was something Tony had only ever dreamed about but had never, ever done. But it felt like he’d done it a hundred times – like kissing Steve was as natural as waving or shaking someone’s hands.
Half an hour later on the dot, the world had flashed white, once. The Earth had still been here. All of the Earths had been here.
And now, Tony was back to his usual spirits. Loud and wild. Hair slick and mustache bushy. Steve looked around them at the locals of Timely. They were good folk. Steve would look after them.
“Or,” Tony said, louder over the sizzling and splattering of the eggs, “I didn’t do it alone anyway. Why is that so hard to accept?”
Stark licked his lips, a slow drag of tongue, leaving them moistened and shiny. The scales tipped towards the other hand.
. He buried his head under the little pillow of the cot and brought himself under control by sheer force of will.
faze New Yorkers. They were a resilient lot and Steve couldn’t help but smile at this one constant in the future.
"That’s rich coming from you," Tony retorted. "Why'd you dodge your part yesterday? We were having a moment." Tony squinted at the ceiling, trying to remember. "Weren't we? And you were the one who ran!"
“Hey everyone,” FRIDAY chirps from the phone, just loud enough to hear over the noise around them. “I’m still logging a significant volume of blacked out communications on both Steve's and Tony’s phone and computers since our last meeting. Estimated possibilities are text messages: 874; emails: 13; video and voice call time: 10 hours 11 minutes. In short, no change. And,” she adds, a little disapproving pout in her voice, “if I didn’t want to rip my virtual hair out from all this, I’d tell you all off, myself included, for stalking and invasion of privacy.”
Steve hunkers down and recounts the great deeds of Iron Man - the resilient man who saved himself from death, the righteous man who sought accountability for his actions, the generous man who opened his home to his team, the selfless man who spent time with Steve despite his own workload, the heroic man who helped clear the streets of mean spirits.
Steve missed it. He missed having Tony leaning on him. He missed having Tony coming to him for help.
“That doesn’t prove anything,” Tony pressed on. “She could've known we were together. We haven't exactly been coy about holding hands. Laser-targeted Cupid bullet. It's the twenty-first century. It’s a thing.” Look at him, arguing logic into what was increasingly likely to be hand-wavey magic.
Tony looks down and pats at the blue glow of the arc reactor. “I’ll keep an eye out on it.” He prods Steve’s knee and Steve tries hard to keep his hands away from the warmth radiating from Tony. “How about that list we made at the end of last year, huh? I know it’s not the same, but I can try to take you through some of those here. It’s what I’ve been practising for. Surfing with a dog? I can do ocean and fluid physics in my sleep.”
Steve is clutching at his shield and a black-gloved fist is flying at his face. He knocks it aside and redirects the follow-through kick with his other arm. He pulls back the shield and swings the edge up at the torso before him. On the upswing, Steve finally looks up to see the Red Skull standing before him.
Tony gasped, wordless, and Steve swallowed around the shaft, his mouth and throat slick with saliva. He massaged Tony's thigh, feeling the muscles tense as Tony tried to thrust but couldn't.
Tony lifts his head with a glare at him and Jim grimaces in apology. “Many reasons. I’m old, for one,” Tony supplies, circling a fingertip around his own face.
Steve sighed again and reached for the perfectly fine knife in this back pouch. He opened his flask of water and placed it beside Stark before tending to the hemp ropes.
The rest of the morning passed slowly. So slowly. He tried going back to non-sexual distractions, back to Phase One. But his mind refused to focus on any of the projects he had in progress and his hands shook too much for any delicate work. Meditating still didn’t work. Exercise didn’t work. Cold showers just made him shiver harder. He couldn’t take a nap. Food gave him interesting thoughts on their potential uses in bed. He couldn’t focus on anything he tried to read or have read to him. All forms of entertainment ended with him reaching into his pants to pull himself back from the edges of what he would class as madness.
“Of course. I’m completely sane and unaffected by the decomposing, disembodied limbs trying to drag you to hell.”
Stark gave a half-hearted snort but made an affirmative noise. He moved in lurching motions towards his Iron Man helmet which lay in the shadows near the shield. It broke into two pieces as he picked it up and he tucked it under one arm as he bent again, with some difficulty, to pick up the shield. "Guess he made his choice," he muttered. He maneuvered the shield to his back. It clicked with a clang of metal and stuck fast. "All I've got left of his patriotic ass, now. Run off, just like all the other ducklings."
'Unfinished business'. Tony dropped his head into his hands. He didn't want to think about what that meant when his 'compulsion' was to rip all his clothes off and press Steve into a bed.
Tony’s arms were straining, shaking, and Steve let a hand run along Tony’s hips and finally closed his fingers around Tony. Tony moaned and rode Steve faster, and Steve started thrusting into him, into the sweet heat of Tony, holding him close with a hand over his heart.
The slick sounds of Steve's fingers inside Tony were loud even over the engines and Tony's moans, and Steve added more lube to ease his way deeper. A rivulet of it ran down his wrist and he grabbed the only loose fabric he had near him to wipe it away. The bright red, white, and blue of his own pocket square was a lovely contrast to the tan of Tony's skin and the darker hue of Tony's suit. Without thinking, he pulled his fingers out of Tony and shoved the silken cloth into Tony's quivering hole. Tony twitched, moaned, and Steve soothed him with a gentle kiss to the cheek before sitting back onto his heels to admire the view of his colors stuffed in Tony's ass.
Steve felt his own shoulders crick from relief and he huffed. “We could have saved ourselves all the trouble. I can’t believe someone else took our supposed first kiss.”
The flushed redness of Tony's cock was beautiful against the slate gray of Tony's suit and Steve belatedly realized that this was the same suit he'd fucked Tony in when he'd first set eyes on Tony's closet. Tony had never worn that suit after that day. And now he probably wouldn’t be able to wear it again because Steve was barely holding himself back from pawing right through it.  Tony closed the inch of space between them to claim Steve's open mouth with a filthy kiss, tongue probing deep, his beard scratching at Steve's lips and spurring him back into action.
"Shoulda known I couldn't trust your hands," Steve said between gasps of laughter. He reached down and rested his hands on Tony's hips as Tony shimmied down to settle his weight just above Steve’s belt.
“I can’t believe you’re in on this too,” Tony says, putting his glass down. “I thought you’d dropped it.”
Tony was breathing hard, his shoulders heaving and making the thin layer of sweat on his skin shine with every twitch of muscle. He undid the clasp and zip of his pants quickly and let them drop to the floor. He stepped out, taking his socks and shoes with them then spread his legs wide, showing Steve his dusky entrance. Steve twitched in his pants but he clenched his fists tight on his own lap, keeping up the appearance of calm.
And Tony wanted to believe. He needed to believe. He launched himself forward, trusting that Steve would catch him - and he buried his face into Steve’s neck when warm arms wrapped around him, caught him.
The best times, then, were when Steve could clear his schedule to join Tony on these trips. There was a thrill in seeing Tony change into a suit on the plane before landing, knowing that he couldn't rough Tony up for his international Stark Industries business partners who would see him as soon as they stepped off the tarmac. Tony's reputation as a playboy was persistent, but long since balanced by the media's love for Iron Man and the philanthropist pushing for green energy. Steve didn't like the tabloids and their rumor-mongering but he also didn't want to be the one to tip the balance for Tony into more turbulent public waters by letting Tony show up to meetings with a telltale stain on his pant leg. It had happened once, early in their relationship, and Steve was careful to not let it happen again.
His eyes slip open slowly, with careful patience. He takes a deep breath and waits for his sight to adjust, his muscles numb on top of the soft, warm surface he’s on. He eyes the ceiling inch by inch and then he hears it, vaguely in the background.
"I just think we were having a good time. Plus, I still want more ideas from you for this place," Tony explains, diverting.
“Nah,” he says, coming out with a towel on his neck. “I haven’t met him—her,” Álvarez corrects himself quickly, his face going a little pale there. Rhodey loses his smile a little. “I meant her. English, man,” he adds, scoffing a
“What is all this?” Pepper asks again, just as Tony’s finished opening all the files and placed them as holograms in front of them.
“You didn't come here because I bat my eyelashes at you,” Natasha says, taking slow steps towards him.
do, Tony,” he says, this time more quietly, more meaningful. In his darkened green eyes Tony finds all of his childhood.
"'At long last' is lasting a little long, boys," Natasha speaks, a hint of mild annoyance, and then Tony hears gunshots from her comms.
“Yep. And trustworthy,” Tony adds and Steve hums in agreement, his eyes closing a little. “You know, things I’m not so much, I guess,” he adds, dropping a note.
Tony lets out a breathy laugh as he flashes Steve that beautiful, kind-hearted smile. "Steve, it's all yours. You can do whatever you want with anything here," Tony answers, his brown eyes deep with a softness Steve hadn't seen before.
“No, don’t bother coming here. Talk to Major Jewett at the Pentagon, she’ll provide you with an office you can use—” he says.
“Like it's thinking,” the doctor says quickly. “I mean, this could be— It's not a human mind. I mean, look at this— they're like neurons firing,” Bruce says.
So far, Rhodey hadn't found anything that placed him as the culprit of JFK's assassination but it was only because he had so little access to information.
“Tony, you copy?” he calls. “I’m en route and closing fast,” he repeats, but the line seems disconnected and Rhodey’s heart closes tightly in his ribcage. “Tony?” Rhodey calls again and he catches the Stark Tower, broken a little to a mess with just an ‘A’. “Don’t do this to me, man,” he mutters and follows the tracker on Tony’s Iron Man suit, to a street a few blocks from the tower.
Rhodey lets out a breath and rolls his eyes, half-amused. "No, you don't," he says and taps Tony on his forearm.
“That's the guy my dad never shut up about? I’m wondering if they shouldn't have kept him on ice,” Tony comments, back on his screen.
CHAPTER WARNINGS: There's a brief mention of the vision Wanda makes Tony have at the beginning of AoU.
Steve turns and chuckles as he turns left into a different room — Tony figures it’s the kitchen because he starts hearing clanks as Steve begins making coffee for them.
"I need to take him," Maria tells him several minutes later. Steve had stood behind Natasha, watching her say goodbye to a man that was a mentor to her.
At that Tony just groans. "Jesus, ok. Who do they think they are? Soulmate sex gurus or something?" Tony says, annoyed and Steve just laughs quietly. "You don't see me asking about the fact that Natasha very evidently pegs him every time, do you? Jeez, have some fucking empathy."
Thor looks between them like he's the one missing something. "Umm, well, I have to return to Asgard," he says.
“Well, it smells delicious. I’ll ask someone to buy some for me so I can have it upstairs,” he says.
In his lab, the hologram for the gem inside the Scepter vastly surpasses JARVIS's size and shape. This one is made of lines and motion and Tony's never seen anything like it.
Tony takes a breath and a gulp of his drink again, which is clear but faintly green, nothing Steve can identify. “So, Aunt Peggy,” says Tony, shuffling over to a couch. “What’d she say?”
His mission in Kuwait shouldn't have taken him as much as it did but he got it done for good. War Machine didn't need to step on Arab soil in the near future and he was damn fucking glad.
"Then help me fix it," she says, showing him a ‘Hello, My Name Is' name tag with a formula in his handwriting on the back.
“I assume. Light her up,” Tony asks and Pepper does. In all the shiny, big metropolis of New York, the Stark Tower lights up, standing out from the rest.
Tony remains smiling until she disappears through the door again and then he drops his shoulders down and turns to Rhodey, making a face. “That was—”
It’s like his memory has been erased clean and all his first times taking his senses is here, right now.
The Captain appears in a flash, dropping what looks like a gun on the center desk. “Phase 2 is SHIELD used the cube to make weapons,” he says, his voice stern. “Sorry, the computer was moving a little slow for me,” the Captain adds for Tony.
Tony gives him a quick look before lowering his eyes down and smiling widely, softly. Steve rubs his knee with his thumb in reply. "He wasn't entirely awful, though. He did save my life once, even after death," Tony says and Steve raises his eyebrows at that.
"I came to see what you kids had planned," Fury says, putting a hand on Tony's shoulder. "And since it's probably something really dumb, I came to make a better plan."
He moves to stand behind his mother, sitting in front of the piano. “Thanks but no thanks. There are about a dozen things I’d rather do than spend my holiday break with my parents in some secluded place,” he says and then, in the same beat, asks, “where are you going, anyways?”
"Mmm, you also had to shower?" Steve asks, the smell came to him even though Tony was a little away.
Rhodey takes another look and nods. “This is good,” he says, calmly. “Good job,” he adds, smiling at Allen as he moves away from his desk to grab his jacket.
"Barnes is the only Howling Commando to give his life in the service of his country," the voice adds in a somber tone.
Steve watches them go and looks again at the computer screen. ‘Agent Barton’, the screen provides, and Steve can also remember him from the debrief package.
Steve almost smiles at that. Guess some things never change, then. “You here with a mission, sir?” he asks.
“Hopefully this puts an end to the Chitauri and HYDRA,” Cap replies and then turns to him. “So, yes, revels,” he says, with a smile that Tony can nearly feel it’s just for him.
But as he’s about to ask if everything’s alright with her, she turns to him with a smile. “Ready to beat these losers into shape?” she says, jokingly.
“This is the next thing, Tony,” Helen addresses him. “Your clunky metal suits are gonna be left in the dust,” she says, looking from her tab.
“Right, I appreciate that—still, I think it’s healthy for both of us that you have other friends,” he replies.
Rhodey takes a breath and readjusts himself in the chair. “I mean, she wasn’t the most impressive résumé here but she did have something,” he says.
Tony turns to him and looks ten years younger and lost. “Did you see them? The pictures?” Rhodey sighs and shakes his head slowly. “Yeah, me neither. Been running away from them, actually,” he adds.
Steve looks ahead to the road, they're just entering Jersey now. "Nazi Germany," he replies flat, adjusting on his seat. "And we're borrowing. Take your feet off the dash," he adds once he notices how she's sitting.
Tony looks at it, too, and gets flashes of the Chitauri ships and the universe and Steve’s dying breath in his arms.
Pepper chuckles at someone using her real name. She can't even remember the last time that happened. "Call me Pepper," she offers instead, blushing a little when Maya smiles and nods silently.
They’ve just gotten done with a Rumiko Fujikawa that looks quite promising – an internship at Microsoft's HR department and a business major – when Rhodey starts to think maybe they should call it a day.
“Oh, you are. Absolutely. Uh...we've made some modifications to the uniform. I had a little design input,” Coulson shares.
Howard Stark sits in all of his greatness, messy gray hair and hands covered in ink as he signs paper after paper. “Uhm, hello,” Tony says by the door.
General Gabriel looks to the other side before going back to Rhodey. “It’s been three months without a single indication that Stark’s even alive. We can’t keep risking assets, least of all you,” he says.
Tony lets out a breath he didn’t know he was holding as soon as Howard was out of sight. Maria walks closer to him, placing her hand on his cheek once more. “You know we love you, right?” she asks, Tony blinks, he’s done fighting.
Rhodey just sighs. "No, Tony. Unlike you, I have bigger things to do than staring at Cap's ass," he says.
Rogers walks towards him and turns back to his soft voice like a switch. “Sometimes there is no a way out, Tony,” he mutters, meeting him halfway.
They’ve been working on the special weapon for three months when their captors start to get doubtful until one day someone different comes to the cave. He’s bald and looks far more in charge than the man with the beard.
Rhodey wakes up at 0600, just one hour before he has to go downstairs for welcoming and presentation and the start of the next eight weeks as he gets ready to become what he always said he would: an Air Force pilot.
It’s ten hours later when he sees Tony again, behaving like a child again. “What’s wrong with you?” it’s the first thing he says, his arms wide open.
“You’re wearing that inside the house now?” Pepper asks, sitting on the couch to take her high heels off. “What is that, Mark 15?” she asks.
Rhodey just gives him a look. "You already signed the papers to give him everything you own once you die, didn't you?" he asks, playfully.
He takes the rifle from its tripod and begins running before he hears the second heat signature at the apartment make a run for him.
"No, no. It's just— we haven't actually set the whole 'boyfriend' record straight. And if you must know—" Tony says but then stops mid-way on their little stroll. "We haven't—" he trails, moving his hand. "You know."
“He needs you to write a report on the Iron Man suit. He’s pretty positive he can take his case to court—”
Álvarez bites his lower lip, and that does not do things to Rhodey’s insides; it’s just the shrimp Tony ordered earlier. “It’s really good to see you, James,” he says, sliding his hand to Rhodey’s knee, and he’s not sure what breaks the spell – the fact that Rhodey hasn’t heard his first name in ages, that Álvarez’s mark can be seen clearly as he puts his hand on his leg or the fact that he is putting his hand on his leg.
Tony moves his face inches away from his and rubs the tip of his nose against Steve’s, his breathing right on Steve’s parted lips. Then he moves around and rubs his nose on the bridge of Steve’s nose, the corners of his mouth, one side to the other.
the science behind him?" Rhodey asks, looking at him approaching Natasha and Clint and the new kid on the couch.
Steve looks at Tony from the distance again and lets out a breath. "Yeah..." he says. "He's just— he's been so relaxed and happy lately. And he had a terrible year after the attack on New York. I just, I don't wanna put all my shit on him."
"So, uh— I'm gonna go," Tony says, and points to the lab. "...keep looking for Ultron," he adds, walking past him.
"Well, I wouldn't say that— just a very dedicated serviceman," Rhodey tries to play off, his eyes going between both men.
Tony just scoffs. "Yeah, that's a lie. He very much meant to," Tony tells Rhodey, who just raises his eyebrows at him and nods with his eyes closed. "Tell you what, here," Tony says, giving Harley his access card.
"Wow, less than 24 hours," the man in the expensive suit —Pierce, his mind quickly provides— says, looking at his watch as he stands in front of him and finishes giving him his mission report. "Impressive," he adds, looking back to him.
Tony sighs before he tells the Agent: “Official consulting hours are between eight and five every other Thursday.”
The girl smiles at Tony politely and hands him a piece of paper. “Do you mind signing my drawing?” she asks.
Tony on his seat is looking like he's struggling to speak for a second, looking between down and back to Steve's deep blue eyes. Steve raises his eyebrows, waiting for an answer, when Tony seems to understand: "Oh, you mean the drawing—" he says.
Rhodey’s not interested in being a hero; he just wants to keep Tony out of trouble –mostly from himself.
“Oh, no. I understand sacrifices. But she still tugged my ear for crashing a plane and showing up seventy years late to our date.” Steve opens his eyes comically wide.
Maya interrupts Pepper shouting at Tony about how, as a matter of fact, she didn't like the bunny at all — "Do we need to worry about that?" Maya asks, pointing at the TV broadcasting Tony's Malibu house.
So, hey. This is one is fairly shorter than the one before. But this time I'm not too sorry because a) I did write a thing on the side for buckyrhodey (which you all have been absolute sweethearts about, thanks!), b) It ends on a perfect note for our next ride & spoiler alert: c) WE FINALLY HAVE BUCKY BACK! So, you're welcome *sunglasses emoji*
And he has stood his own, but this is the third time in the week they make fun of his old, favorite backpack and the fact that he can answer all the questions in his math test. It’s not his fault they’re all stupid, but Chad moved away last summer and Jimmy didn’t think getting new friends should be this hard — and now Yolanda is going through a phase and keeps ignoring him when he waves her in the hallway.
Rhodey nods and takes a breath. "I know. He's been waiting for you by the balcony," Rhodey says. "Good luck," he adds.
Tony visibly bites the inside of his cheek before he gives in. “Fine. I’ll leave this in your capable hands and the mediocre US government you so fondly stand up for.” He sounds annoyed but Rhodes smiles.
"Yeah— about this little situation. Did you know Extremis has side-effects on soulmate scarring?" Tony says and Rhodey shakes his head in reply. "Yeah, it turns fainter. Maya was considering putting it out in the market for mark erasure procedures— you know, the ones Dr. Cho told us about," Tony says.
“Look, she was just talking about glitches happening,” Tony says, still lying down. Suddenly, there’s noise outside, and Tony remembers what’s tonight. “Hey! Happy New Year,” he tells them. “Alright, I'll see you in the mornin',” he tells Happy, who moves to shake his hand.
He got up from the couch and moved Tony from his sitting position to lay him down, just like he did back at his apartment, months ago.
Tony enters the house and leaves his MIT hoodie on the coat rack and takes off his sneakers. “Hey, Jarvis, has anyone called me today?” he asks, remembering the note he left for Rhodey back on campus.
“You know I did some digging in our little cases and we're part of a 12% statistics of people who have no name on their wrists. Apparently, there are big support groups and communities,” Tony shares staring at the ceiling, Rhodey takes a big sip and burps quietly. “You think we should try to join any?” he asks and Rhodey shakes his head.
“This is uh...This,” Tony says, looking at all the information S.H.I.E.L.D. has on the former Avengers candidates. Captain America standing particularly in front of him.
“Nah, listen. I told you, I lost track of time. I was updating one of my armors and one of my silly bots put something where he shouldn’t have. Didn’t get time to shower,” Tony explains, easily, giving a vague shrug at last. “But if you got so much of an issue with my appearance…” he trails, jokingly about to step back outside the elevator.
“But if it isn’t the man of the hour,” he greets and he can picture Tony smiling miles away. “I’m sorry, Mister Stark. Are you busy?” he jokes.
Tony opens his mouth to add a witty remark but decides against it. These were the closest people his father ever had –other than Captain fucking America. He doesn’t need to crush the memory of Howard to them, not when the man’s not there to defend himself anymore, at least. “I highly doubt I’m capable of being like he was, guys,” Tony says instead.
“That was an old S.H.I.E.L.D. project that I had that—never saw the light; you don’t need to worry about it. As for Iron Man,” Nick says, taking a deep breath. “Tony’s—kinda of a complicated man, hard to read at first sight, but deep down I know his heart’s in the right place, and I know that when I call him, ‘cause I need him to fight, he’ll be there,” Nick explains. “I know you must be eager to meet him but the time isn’t right yet,” he adds, and Steve fakes a deeper frown.
"You don't wanna go after him," Allen says, softly. There's no judgment in his tone and Rhodey doesn't really understand why.
“—when you know you have me, and you have Rhodey,” Pepper says before grabbing Tony’s face and pushing him to look at her. “And Steve,” she offers.
Tony lets out a laugh. “Oh, yeah, I might not even graduate anytime soon,” he tells her and Maria replies with a smirk. “You?” he asks, after lightly clearing his throat. Last time he saw his mother, her eyes were always red, a heavy sadness rooted in her core.
He shakes that voice away and tackles him to the ground. "You're my mission," he says at his face, holding onto what's left of the world he knew.
"Clint said you wouldn't mind, but our tractor doesn't seem to want to start at all," Laura continues and Tony turns to her with a smile. "I thought maybe you might—"
Tony holds his hands up defensively. “They rubbed Happy wrong, Pep. That’s all I meant to say,” he explains.
Jim spots the Air Force R.O.T.C. logo and his heart does a flip. “Dear James Rhodes, contact your Air Force ROTC detachment to schedule your meeting interview for your scholarship application”, reads the important bit and Jim does not feel like crying.
There on a small, six-chairs table, Tony sits next to some remarkable people  who were quite possibly equally a threat, at least that’s how much he’d gathered from Tony’s little Avengers Initiative rant.
“No, not yet,” he answers and Tony sighs, annoyed. “Yes. Of course Miss Gabriel. Goodbye now,” he finishes and closes the antenna of the device. “Tony,” he says, voice serene as he gives Tony a tight hug.
Rhodey – who’s been the first person to know — is looking down and failing at acting like he’s shocked. At the end of the room, Pepper is shaking her head slowly. Ok, why the long faces? They’re friends with Iron Man; they should feel awesome right now.
Tony looks to the side and takes a breath. “So what's really goin' on? With the Mandarin,” he asks as Rhodey sips his drink. Tony shifts and takes his sunglasses off. “Seriously, can we talk about this guy?” he asks, whispering, it’s the third time this week Tony asks him about it.
“Of course I'd be deeply honored, and it’s you, that's great! So when do we do it?” Tony asks, all fast talk and booze.
Tony shrugs but he looks uneasy. "Of course I know. He almost killed Steve. I had to know who the fuck he was and what the hell he wanted," he explains.
“Barnes,” Allen says and Rhodey takes a look at the surveillance image. “I used your buddy’s face recognizance system to spot him in a market in Montegiardino, a little town in San Marino,” he elaborates.
“I don't remember it being that easy,” he comments, taking a look back to Loki. “This guy packs a wallop,” he adds.
"Oh, alright, sure," Clint says, moving to stand, and everyone chuckles. Clint grins and then turns to Steve, too.
They stand in silence for a bit as Tony looks over at the footage again until Steve says, “I saw that, by the way.” Tony glances over at him with a quirked eyebrow. “Back at Peggy’s. I saw it on the news,” he adds.
"'Whosoever be he worthy shall haveth the power.'— Whatever, man!" Clint says, mocking the saying. "It's a trick," he adds.
Rhodey remains fully professional during the whole thing but there’s a kid inside him who’s jumping excitedly on the spot.
“Yeah, and I wouldn’t recommend anyone watching whatever Tony’s up to,” Rhodey comments, before taking a sip of his drink.
He’d been far too focused on doing his best that Rhodey really couldn’t bring himself to know just what kind of stuff people were talking about his roommate, so he just stands there and raises his eyebrows, waiting for more exposition.
“Our job is 'if',” Tony defends, following after him. “What if you were sipping margaritas on a sun-drenched beach, turning brown instead of green? Not looking over your shoulder for Veronica,” he suggests.
In the following days he feels a slight kind of peace but there’s still a turmoil of thoughts he’s saving for later, for a time when he’s not about to do the one thing he’s dreamt the most about in his entire life.
But Tony’s oxygen-lacking brain takes a different highroad and chuckles instead. Against his better judgment.
Steve laughs and bites his lower lip, Tony does everything in his power to pretend he didn't see that. "I mean
It doesn’t matter how many successful missions he has on his belt, he always gets the same punishment.
"We're the Avengers. We can bust arms dealers all the livelong day, but that up there? That's the endgame. How do you guys plan on beating that?" Tony asks them, and Steve knows his heart is on his sleeve.
But here, in the middle of a lonely street in New Jersey, he feels her trying. For what reason, he doesn't know. But he's willing to give her enough trust to hope she's not devious about anything in this conversation.
He knows he’s capable of loving because Carol looks at him with her bright blue eyes and flips him over when he gives her shit after a PT’s and there’s no other thing he can call it.
Deciding against it, he lowers the file back and continues his journey of seeing all of his past friends, now as nothing but filed memories. He sees Howard and is swiftly brought back to the present time, the present problem.
She fools him once more but that's all, hiding behind the car, he finds her, and like years before, he shoots her through it, enough to stop her on her tracks and walk over to her to finish the job.
"Oh, not tonight, big guy," Tony says, coming inside, rubbing his shoulder. “We can party the Not End of The World tomorrow.”
“No. No, look, I'm not trying to be a dic—,” Rhodey cuts himself off as two kids approach them on their table. “—tator,” he saves.
“—Why should I do anything?” Tony cuts him off, not raising his voice. “They're gonna kill me, you, either way, if they don't, I'll probably be dead in a week,” he adds.
"Yeah, he even left a video. Said I was his greatest creation," Tony says but Steve frowns at him. That's a very odd thing to tell your kid. "So I guess that's another thing we have in common," Tony adds with a smile.
Tony just stares at him and pouts. "Hill told me I was one of the first few million targets," Tony tells him like he's already aware, but Steve looks surprised. "Yeah, for Insight. I had just been chillin' at the Tower, just fucking choosing new paint colors for the walls."
Tony turns to Steve, his chin resting on his hand, giving him what can only be described as heart eyes. "Steve, don't listen to them. Go on," he says.
Tony's mouth opens and he rolls his tongue on the inside of his cheek. "So, this friendly pep-talk was just a ploy to get me to do labor work, huh?" Tony asks as Clint gets up and walks to the kitchen.
He’s not Jimmy or Jim anymore, now he’s ‘Rhodes’. Couple of months into the semester —at MIT, no less, because God squeezes but he doesn’t choke and since the universe fucked him over, they’re re-setting their karma by giving him have nearly everything worth in life. Except a damn soulmate. — and he’s already learned his way through the crowds, made a few friends here in this class and there in this Wing.
Rhodey nods and taps on the buttons. "Oh, and please, please, don't do anything stupid until I come back, okay?"
Steve smiles far too softly and looks down again, mustering every ounce of courage he has. "There's a place nearby where I'm staying," he tries again. "There's a great Caesar salad and cheeseburgers, depending on what you like," Steve adds.
"Yu gave me a week to gather intel on Barnes so I thought I could head over The Avengers Tower and use Tony's tech to help the search," Rhodey says, standing up and grabbing his uniform jacket from the chair and folding it around his arm.
Lying on a pile of chaos and wreck, the Avengers rest bloody and lifeless. He looks at each of them, the glow on their eyes gone and he feels his face wet with tears.
“With that in mind, I humbly present the crown jewel of Stark Industries freedom line. It's the first missile system to incorporate our proprietary repulsor technology. They say the best weapon is one you never have to fire, I respectfully disagree. I prefer the weapon you only have to fire once. That's how Dad did it, that's how America does it...and it's worked out pretty well so far. Find an excuse to let one of these off the chain, and I guarantee you the bad guys won't even want to come out of their caves”, Tony says before motioning for one of the assigned airmen to point the missiles to the empty field far in the back and firing just one. “For your consideration, the Jericho,” Tony presents, before a huge explosion goes off at his back, the wave of air it made making him move on his spot.
Peggy shakes her head. “This is out of your hands, Steve. SHIELD has no jurisdiction over terrorist attacks,” she explains.
He must look like the caffeine is working because Steve sees him and he laughs. “I talked to Peggy about you,” Steve says, looking at his hands. “I guess because I feel like I don’t know what to do, either.”
Steve sits upright on the couch, catching his breath and Tony opens his palms on the hard floor to ground himself.
It's all escalating very quickly but it's the closest they've gotten to Ultron since his attack in the Tower.
Tony blinks in response. “Oh, yeah, I’m having a team of guys tomorrow, they’re gonna blow out a wall—”
Then he remembers. “Shit. Gotta go,” Jim says before running back home to where the fate of his future awaits.
Tony bites his lower lip, the corner of his mouth drawn up, and nods. “But go ahead, talk to him, he’s fun,” he asks, his hands doing a little offering motion.
Tony does half a shake and goes: "I'm afraid of that every time we got out to work." Steve's eyes turn even more lost. "No. It's more than that. I'm afraid for Pepper, Maya, everyone who can't protect themselves."
“—While  trying to save the city. Jesus, you too?” says Tony, but he doesn’t sound offended. Steve shakes his head.
Tony pouts and moves his head to one side. “Yeah…except that’s not why I knew,” he says and that just makes Steve’s mind rush. “Listen, don’t leave town, alright? I’ll try to stay in touch,” he says, an open, honest smile on his face.
“No, you wouldn't. If I had been that drunk I wouldn't have been able to stand, much less give a lecture on integrated circuits,” he says but Tony’s far from listening.
They make it to the dining room, where everyone's gathered, holding hands and everyone stares at them, falling silent.
Rhodey shakes his head. "A few years. Since before I got the suit," Rhodey says, swallowing, then looking around themselves.
When Tony sees the sun again, his knees go weak, and Rhodey has to put himself behind him to catch him in midair. After that, Tony doesn’t object to using the wheelchair while he gains his composure back.
He has a couple of more suits flying and charging against them and all Tony's left to do is run to his suit, carefully sitting in his lab, a few floors below.
"Every time someone tries to win a war before it starts, innocent people die— every time," Steve tells him, because he knows better.
“Tones, I understand, but you need to let them check you out, alright? Make sure everything’s good,” Rhodey explains.
He saves him and looks around, in the bright sunlight and breathes in the smell of river water and smoke, tastes the blood on his tongue.
Tony turns to one of his computers as they all wait for him to elaborate. Steve's palms are sweating.
Jarvis stands still for a second and then untangles himself from Tony’s grip. “Boy,” he whispers softly and Tony takes some distance, wiping the evidence of tears from his cheeks. “That is not what I meant, Tony,” he says. “What I meant is that I have left you to your devices to cope with what happened, trusting you’d be wise to do so in whatever ways you thought effective but I believe I may have overestimated you,” he says, finding a way to scold him without sounding like he’s scolding him. Tony’s almost impressed. “Are you aware of how I feel about you, Anthony?” he asks, a beat later.
Which is why when she confides him with the ‘Jessica Drew’ on her wrist, Jim feels an entire different kind of heartache.
Tony lets out a breath. "Oh, good. Great, that's awesome," he says, resting his forehead against Steve's chest. "It's good to have someone who understands the hero gig, you know? Sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do," Tony adds.
Happy moves towards one of her plants and runs a hand through it. “Can you— can you not touch my plant. It's not— she doesn't like it. She—”
Steve moves his chin to one side. “Alcohol really isn’t my thing. Not since I realized it did nothing to me,” he says.
But his eyes look a darker shade of brown, a deepness to them Steve hadn’t spot before, and he’s already spent days drawing Tony’s fawn-brown eyes at this point.
“On your left,” Steve mutters to Sam sitting next to him in the hospital room. It’s the first thing he allows himself to think.
“You'll be made of you, Mr. Barton,” Helen assures. “Your own girlfriend won't be able to tell the difference,” she says.
“I'm going to pay for that comment about percentages in some subtle way later on, aren't I?” Tony asks instead, sitting on the couch, taking the glass.
“Why aren't you wearing those pajamas I got you?” Tony says instead before Obadiah says his goodbyes. He gets into the Humvee and hears Rhodey call for him. Tony closes the door before Rhodey can reach it.
Natasha pants and Clint covers her face with his hands. "Hey, hey. I'm here. It's okay. None of that was real, alright?" he whispers to her and cleans the sweat off her forehead before he kisses it.
“Alright, Happy, you think you can drop me at Maya’s and then come back here, keep an eye on him?” Pepper says, making her way back to Happy, grabbing her bag from him.
The man blinks, remembering he came in for something other than making the air around Steve and Tony feel heavy. “Yeah, right, Pepper. She told me to tell you that she wants you to confirm the inventory for the first cargo ship. They’re supposed to be leaving tonight but she said they need you to sign and make sure everything’s there,” he says.
He pushes Tony with the full force of his hammer and makes him fly across the jet, right into the Captain, knocking him off his feet by nearly falling over him.
“I know, I just— I want him to feel like he can talk to me about this kind of stuff. I’ll understand,” Tony says, making a pout at the end.
Tony shakes his head. "Nah, look. We're talking about limb regrowth. We've both seen it. This could be huge," Tony reassures her. "You just have to figure out a way to do it without turning the subject into, I don't know, superhuman –torches. Hey, that's a good superhero name," Tony muses.
Tony lowers his head, defeated, as it clicks in Steve’s brain. Now, he sees it: boxes all over the lab, some packed and sealed, some open and getting filled.
"Took you long enough to find me, Captain," Tony says, his tongue peeking all kinds of provocatively as he spoke.
Maya takes a breath and comes a few steps towards Pepper before she says, "I wish it was under better circumstances, but I'm glad I finally met you, Virginia."
Tony leaves quietly, stepping on his tiptoes, doing his best to avoid stepping on the high heels and broken glasses and the rest of the mess lying on the carpeted floor, just shy of the sun finishing its rise.
Right. That thing they had been fighting over for the past four hours. "Okay, we've been through this, nope," Tony says.
‘The Richie Rich joke just got slightly funnier,’ Rhodey muses as he goes to the payphone in the train station. He dials the mansion’s number and waits for Jarvis’ British accent to come up.
"I don't trust a guy without a dark side," Tony says, before cutting a log in half with the ax. "Call me old-fashioned," he adds.
"So, the Winter Soldier is... HYDRA?" Rhodey summarizes, because it's the only question left in him. The last thing he heard was that he was a covert KGB agent-slash-experiment.
"You travel far," Fury comments as he takes a few steps towards him, his hand out for Rhodey to shake.
He raises his hand quickly and Allen gives him the drink which Rhodey drinks religiously. "Ah, God bless you, Tom," Rhodey sighs, feeling life coming back to him.
Steve sits upright fast, with a brand-new energy and grabs Peggy's folder from his drawer; it had been sitting there for all these months. Untouched. Calling up to him to man up.
He barely has time to turn back before the alien ship is coming alive and threatening to eat him whole.
He runs up through the sand and stands just a few steps away from Tony’s small, sitting body. “How was the fun-vee?” he says, his breath rushed.
When the doors open again he finds that, unlike his room, the common floor is very different from how he left it. The glass walls are completely dark. Where before he could see the bright blue sky, along with a landscape of New York’s imposing skyscrapers, now all he can see is dull blackness.
Maya has fallen quiet and the previous worried look she sported has disappeared, replaced instead by a doubtful smile and big, shiny eyes.
Steve's chest is still trying to ease up. "Where's Thor?" he asks, following in shaky steps after Clint.
"Oh, really? You don't wanna stay? We got spare rooms," Steve offers, they start walking towards the elevator door.
Tony chuckles a reply. “Anyways, you’ve been good? So much for keeping your promise of not ditching me after school…”
Anyways, let me know what you think and remember you can find me at @tazadekarma on Twitter and buckybear.co.vu on Tumblr!
He stayed in the guest room for a couple of more days, watched as Tony answered more questions for the authorities and met a woman called Peggy, who Tony said was his aunt “in heart”.
“Relax,” he tells Tony, and Tony lowers his hands from his head. He walks towards him, like a lion slowly walking towards its prey, and puts his fingers on top of his chest, on top of the arc reactor. “The bow and arrow once was the pinnacle of weapons technology. It allowed the great Genghis Khan to rule from the Pacific to Ukraine, an empire twice the size of Alexander the Great and four times the size of the Roman Empire,” he speaks, walking around the cave. “But today, whoever holds the latest Stark weapons rules these lands, and soon, it will be my turn.”
“The uniform? Aren't the stars and stripes a little...old fashioned?” Steve asks, trying not to look sad at how much everything keeps changing.
It's like a blow to the face. He remembers then, the first time he saw it. With Karpov and his men, the other soldiers. The other weapons. Years ago.
"No, I'm good," Clint answers. "If you wanna get some kip, now's a good time because we're still a few hours out."
"And— you're on the right side of things, Rhodes," he adds. "Chain of command, compromise— law and order. You'd do good not to forget that because the state that we're at," Ross moves his head to one side before he says, locking eyes with him: "The world can't afford to lose men like you. Soldiers like you."
His father doesn’t tell him to leave but when he looks down back to his desk, Tony knows that’s as far as it could go. He doesn’t say bye, just quietly turns on his spot and leaves the door half-open.
"You like it?" Steve asks, trying to make conversation. The sketch isn't finished but you can see it's Tony's building.
Rhodey gives him a serious face. “Oh, really? As ridiculous as a giant green man or an actual God of Thunder?” he asks, sarcastically.
From over her shoulder, Tony can see Happy by the door, and he wiggles his eyebrows at his former security guard as hello.
“I was sick and poor and an orphan. And I didn’t really feel like I fit in anywhere. Hell, if it wasn’t for Bucky I don’t know what I would’ve done with myself,” he continues, huffing a laugh.
"There is when you've been deployed for nine months and the closer you get to action is being smooched by you," Rhodey counters.
“Trying to save it,” Nick replies, offering the folder open to show him pictures of the cosmic cube.
“If there’s a reason I respect the US military it’s because of you, sugarplum,” Tony yells as Rhodes walks back into the elevator, giving a little wave goodbye before the doors close.
Pepper takes a few more steps towards Tony before she reaches him and puts her hands on his head, taking the special headwear off and putting it on the table next to him.
Steve uncrosses his arms and sighs again. "This thing came to life on its own and you helped to make it happen. You and Bruce," he says.
His mouth open and closes a few times before Tony decides to speak again. “Listen, it’s okay if you don’t like it, it’s not finished yet. I still haven’t packed the whole gym yet—”
Steve nods and then looks down. "...I know a place," he says, so quietly Tony can barely register what he says.
Steve jerks his chin to the side. “No. I also hate bullies. Always have. People who make others feel miserable, feel pain. It’s why I’m a bad Catholic, most of the times,” Steve says and this time it’s Tony who laughs.
Steve stands straight and turns to him, his brow furrowed. "Is that an apology?" he asks, sarcastically.
“We need you to look this over, soon as possible,” Agent guy says, offering a special folder to him.
Rhodey walks in through the mountains of boxes and scraps and car parts and — is that a pizza box?—and chuckles when he gets to Tony. He pokes him on the shoulder, where ‘James Rhodes’ can be seen through the thin white Stark Industries shirt and Tony groans.
“Hey— I gave a speech?” Tony asks, having no recollection of doing anything other than looking into Maya’s beautiful brown eyes. “How was it?”
He's dizzy and her twisting him around isn't helping. "Stop," he begs, pressing his eyes closed and stepping away from Peggy until he bumps against someone.
Rhodey turns on his heels to walk out, giving a slight nod to Ross as he goes but as soon as he walks through the door he hears:
But as Tony pulls off, he inhales. Then he grabs Steve's cock with his long, rough fingers and he breathes right into the head, before rolling the tip of his tongue through the slit.
"Oh, you gotta be fucking kidding me," Rhodey curses, his happy, fuzzy feeling flying out of the car.
"You've been busy," Rhodey comments, looking at what seems to be the Avengers' new and improved gadgets.
“No. A phone," Steve cut in, digging his eyes on Tony. “I wasn’t sure if calling you was safe and I just started moving fast on all of it before it got too late. This was HYDRA. You have no idea how far they almost got,” he explains.
He sneaks up the stairs to the rooftop of the apartment picking on the lock of the fire escape door, easy, like he’s done it since he was eight, and tilts his head over the edge, on his tiptoes, to look at all of Point Breeze’s quiet night.
“And I am sure Second Lieutenant Rhodes understands the importance of being a responsible person and doing their job,” Jarvis says, addressing Rhodey with suggestive eyebrows.
“I’ve gotten some disciplinary action— twice,” he says, taking a deep breath. “You know me, always getting into trouble,” he adds.
Tony leans his forehead in, against Steve's shoulder and Steve lets his head fall on top of his. "They're probably right," Tony mutters against it and Steve nods in agreement.
Tony smiles, doesn’t talk because his voice will break if he does, and leans back into Jarvis’ shoulder, giving him another squeeze. “Why are you telling me this?” he wonders.
"I... hadn't thought of that," Tony whispers. Rhodey nods, raising his eyebrows. "But Pepper did get her mark faint when she had Extremis inside of her," Tony says, raising his finger.
Rhodey’s too tired to keep pushing on being a proper leader figure; he’ll save that for the officer leadership test.
They click their glasses just before JARVIS comes up again. “Sir, the telephone— I'm afraid my protocols are being overwritten,” he says.
"Then finish it," the man mutters, his face smushed and beaten but his voice unfaltering. "'Cause I'm with you 'til the end of the line," he adds and it breaks something in him.
“Obadiah Stane,” the man says, with all smiles and business persona. “Tony, we’re ready to go. The hearse will arrive at the Trinity Church Cemetery just in time for the President to give his public speech. They’re just waiting for you,” he says, turning to Tony, giving Rhodey his back.
So they both look at each other panting, red down to the necks, and decide to mutually call it off. Postpone it.
“I wouldn’t miss this little Hollywood party for the world,” Sam adds, joking and pointing over his shoulder at Thor talking to a few other of the guys from the vet group.
“Must be strange for you, all of this,” the Doctor comments just as a group of cadets pass by them, joggling in formation.
“He’s—down in the lab. He’s been there since we arrived here, a week ago,” she shares, looking to the other side and sighing. Rhodey looks at her and smiles, she made it, against all odds.
The music rings in his ears too familiar and he looks around himself to recognize where he is too well.
There are dark thoughts he’s buried deep in his memories, feelings he’s suppressed with tight-strong determination.
"You know I could just break your neck right here, not even your little friend at my eight o'clock and his rifle would be quick enough to stop me," he says at the man's cheek, looking ahead to the rest of the room.
Steve turns before one of Klaue's men can fire at him and he punches him unconscious, but before he can notice, the Maximoff kid shows up again and pushes him off-balance, sending him flying against a staircase.
Tony's stomach growls in the sudden quietness of the room and now he wants the carpeted floor to eat him whole. Steve smirks despite himself and Tony just rolls his eyes.
"Under 'fuck ya'll, I do what I want'. It's a special private corporation," Tony replies and Steve laughs again. "Do you wanna run it? I feel like it really captures your essence," Tony adds.
“Iron Man? Yeah, I wouldn’t count on him making an appearance soon,” Coulson says, jokingly, as he crosses his arms. “He wasn’t particularly interested in the whole thing when I arrived, still seems butthurt about the fact he wasn’t allowed to join the Initiative,” he says, looking at Nick, cracking a laugh.
Then Steve remembers what he gathered from Tony’s file and he feels sick: these are the same people that kidnapped and tortured Tony into becoming Iron Man years ago.
“Did you?” Steve wonders. It had been easy for Steve to ignore that maybe Tony knew more about him than Steve thought. “I mean, yeah, no—of course you did,” Steve tries again. “The debrief package…” he trails.
“We’re like the perfect combo, buddy,” Tony says, on his 39th birthday —in a surprise party Tony managed to pull while inviting a few of Rhodey’s teammates and not just them and Pepper and Happy like last year’s.
He slides into his flying suit, all his good mood crushed to the ground, disappeared with his mark, and gets out of the bathroom.
“I promise you I will be the best teammate and fellow airmen you’ve ever had,” Álvarez pleads with his shiny olive-brown eyes.
‘The world hasn’t changed all that much,’ Nick had assured and that’s what he holds onto as he walks in the streets of this new world and takes everything in. He has no idea how but even the sky looks different.
It’s by the third semester that he realizes he’d been wrong this whole time; he thought the lack of a surname on his body meant he was broken beyond repair, straight out of love, finished, but that was just a big capitalistic monster of publicity trying to sell you their sixteenth blockbuster on soulmates post-apocalyptic love stories.
,” his coward of a handler calls, gun just above his shoulder. “Get me out of here,” he commands. In the back of his head something –someone—dreams of leaving him there for dead. Let his vicious comrades have a go at their creator.
“Tony,” Rhodey says, his palm on his chest. “If you chop your arm off, it’s gonna appear in the other and if you chop that one too, it’s gonna appear on your forehead, you dumbass,” he scolds, hitting Tony just slightly on his forehead.
Maria shifts next to Rhodey. “Yeah, they must be busy, because they would hate missing you guys get together,” she says sarcastically before fake scoffing: “testosterone!”
Natasha looks ahead. “He went back to his family. Has to help out Laura with the baby before he arrives,” she explains, her eyes lost for a second.
Tony shakes his head and looks down, he still can remember all of their dead eyes looking at nothing. Looking at him and his epic failure.
He asks for directions to a place where he can sit with a nice view and it gets him to a little coffee shop a few blocks away from his apartment. He sits and listens to the people talk and go on about their day; anxiety just looming in the back of his throat.
“And since you’re appreciating my honesty: I’m not mad about it, either,” Steve adds after a beat, leaving little room for Tony to catch a breath and gather his thoughts. “I don’t know what I’m trying to say by this, but I know that,” he says.
“Dr. Banner is only here to track the Cube. I was hoping you might join him,” Fury tells Tony, walking in.
She frowns at him but there's a smile on her face, still. "Who's Tony?" she asks and there's another flash, lighting over the room.
“So this Dr. Banner was trying to replicate the serum that was used on me?” Steve asks, looking at the videos of a giant green man S.H.I.E.L.D. gave him.
Steve watches him go, cracking up, and he feels heavy in his chest. A mix of calm and anxious perfectly balanced in his belly.
“We’re dead in the air up here. Our communications, the location of the Cube, Banner, Thor…” Fury trails, he sounds just as defeated as Tony feels. “I got nothing for you. I lost my one good eye,” he mutters. “Maybe I had that coming,” he adds.
"Listen, I've made my peace with the fact that you and I are very different people," Tony says, like, that's what this has all been about. "Like, chalk and cheese doesn't even come close— it's like we're entirely different elements. Different states of matter: you're strong, solid. I'm goddamn gas," he says.
Steve twists the key on the doorknob and Tony looks around himself, quietly entering the unassuming calmness of Steve’s apartment.
Rhodey chuckles at Allen's sudden quietness and then looks down as his friend makes it back to him, on his way to the car.
Steve groans loudly, dramatically. “Do I have to do it again?” he threatens, his eyebrows going up comically.
He saves him. Like he’s coded to do so. Like his mission was to keep him alive instead of taking his life.
"Wait. I know that guy," Tony says, pointing at him. He can't remember his name but he knows there was an accent. "From back in the day. He operates off the African coast," he says, looking over at the files. "Black market arms," he adds.
“Shut up, Scotty, the hell?” Davis says, hitting Andrews on his ribs. “Look, we’re just wondering ‘cause we can’t have people like that near, you see? We gotta look out for each other,” he adds, giving Rhodey a little bump on the shoulder.
Tony just raises his eyebrows at him. "So, you're just gonna order me around now? Just tell me what to do?"
"He's not very eloquent, is he?" Pierce says to their audience when he doesn't say anything again. People around them chuckle nervously, not knowing what else to do.
Steve looks at his hand and finds a key attached to a tiny version of his shield on a keychain. He smiles warmly at it and when he looks up again, Tony's nowhere near.
“Just— wait. Hey, Doctor Cho?” Tony says into the camera of his phone, his shiny Tony Stark brand smile on.
Natasha walks over to Steve and goes quietly: "What are we doing about her?" she asks, pointing with her chin towards Wanda, sitting in the quinjet just outside.
Álvarez raises one eyebrow at him, but Rhodey waves his hand off. “Ignore him; he’s territorial. Tony, this is—”
Maybe Howard had promised cars back then, but Tony’s managed to make far more impressive works. Not that Steve will mention that; he’s learned his lesson. “It’s amazing, Tony,” is all he says.
"Ultron says the Avengers are the only thing between him and his mission. And whether or not he admits it, his mission is global destruction," Fury says. "All this, laid in a grave. So stand," he tells them, adding: "Outwit the platinum bastard," as he sits down.
Steve lets out a chuckle and sits back on his chair, too. "Right. Especially since I like men," he says, just when Tony's taking his last sip of coke.
Tony turns back to Maya with a smile and then takes a step closer. "Please don't tell me that there is a twelve-year-old kid waiting in the car that I've never met," he jokes.
Pepper scoffs a fake a laugh. “Well, for starters, I don’t think that’s any of your business but if you must know, I’m not interested in him,” she says, taking a step closer to Tony. “I don’t know what the hell kind of idea Happy got but he’s way off. And I’m not comfortable having both of you check up on me like I’m some sort of five-year old,” she adds, her eyes stern.
They've been talking for a few minutes when Thor decides to leave abruptly, without saying much of a word.
With shaky hands, he drags the device to his ear just before checking the caller. “Yes, sir?” he salutes, catching his breath.
Tony bites his lower lip as he nods, but then he lets his head fall once more. “The fuck am I gonna do now, man?” he asks, rhetorically, and walks to the window.
Steve follows behind, a little hesitant. “A lot. She’s upset you haven’t gone to visit her since the attack.” Steve doesn’t miss when Tony’s eyes squint a little at the mention of the almost world-ending event that occurred in Steve’s beloved city just some months ago.
Steve looks at Peggy’s file still sitting on the woodened table. “Yes,” he replies, deciding he can’t be a coward
“There you are,” Tony says, fumbling with the Mercedes 230 SL from ‘64 engine of Howard’s old collection. “You ready to talk about what happened last night?” he asks.
And Tony feels it, too, because he lets go of his hand like it is on fire, then rubs his wrist and averts his eyes from him.
He goes to his electrical stove and is about to start making himself breakfast when he remembers he's missing eggs and vegetables for an omelet.
“So, yeah. Don’t say I didn’t give you a heads up this time. I’m going to shower,” Pepper says, giving him a kiss on the cheek. “I recommend you take one, too. ‘Cause Steve must be getting here pretty soon,” she adds, turning on her feet, up and away from Tony’s lab.
He has no idea what just happened but he's sure it's got something to do with Loki's little magic wand.
And then he’s panicking. He just kissed another man, and in public, in front of — “Hey, where did everybody go?” Rhodey wonders out loud, coming out of his yet-to-start panicking.
Maya gets up shaking, a hand attached to her stomach and the thick, dark red blood is spilling through her dress into her hand. Tony swallows and waits as she makes her way towards him in unsteady steps.
He clicks the light off and then gets under his covers, giving one quick look at the haunting ‘James’ written on his wrist.
“You know, they say sarcasm is a metric for potential,” Howard starts and Tony walks to rest on the doorframe. “If that’s true, you’ll be a great man someday. I’ll get the bags,” he finishes, talking to Maria at the end.
“Stark, we need a plan of attack!” the Captain yells at him, somewhere between an order and a request.
Howard puts his hands in his pockets, about to take the bait, when his mother goes: “Be nice, dear, he’s been studying abroad,” reminding him that their son is not home all the time because he’s trying to get a summa cum laude degree on Mechanical Engineering at MIT and not because he absolutely dreads being in the same space as his father.
“Well, that’s not exactly what they did—but I did donate money to actual teams that are working on that,” Tony says, opening his palms at Pepper when she starts glaring. “That team was actually paid for by Howard and what they did was search for Captain America in the ocean. I found out about it when I was fourteen. He always would be sending some money there and I thought, you know, maybe he had another secret family overseas but turns out it was just his obsessed ass looking for his ex-boyfriend or whatever—”
Rhodey’s been in Mogadishu for three months when he gets a letter from Tony with the rest of his mail. He's smiling a little, thinking what could've possibly possessed Tony enough that he'd decide to write, but as soon as he opens the piece of paper his heart sinks.
Tony stares at nothingness. “I’m chopping my arm off,” Tony deadpans, making to walk to the worktable but they put their hands on his chest.
"The Winter Soldier is an American citizen," Yu says, looking at the file before he hands it over for Rhodey to see.
Because remembering who he really was the last strike of their whip, of their abuse, of their torture.
Rhodey lets out a deep breath, like he’d been holding all of his air in since his eyes landed on Barnes.
'No, you're fooling yourself, he's not interested, he's just a good man who wants to make his teammates feel welcome,' a reasonable voice in his head tells him.
Tony takes a deep breath and zips the hoodie up, in one of the dark corners of the cave some bastards are expecting him to crack.
Tony closes his eyes before he presses another quick kiss to Steve’s lips, because if he keeps losing himself in that blue, he’s going to be apologizing to other people he cares about in his life, too.
"What the hell did you do?!" Maya gasps, taking a step towards the hologram. "You said you'd leave her out of this!" she adds.
Sam opened his palms at him in an okay gesture. Then he turned to Steve and squeezed one of his legs. “I’ll see you later, man,” he says and Steve let out a faint sigh as he nodded.
“That's alright, ‘cause I love to be handed things, so, let's trade,” Pepper speaks, taking the folder from Agent guy and giving him her glass. “Thank you,” she says, after taking the glass from Tony and handing him the folder.
Rhodey waits impatiently outside the medical room at the Bagram base while they try to check Tony out before he starts to hear yelling and something metallic. Rhodey steps in to find Tony at one side of the room and the doctor and his nurse at the other. “Colonel, we just need to check his wounds,” they explain.
Álvarez looks back at the door behind him then back to Rhodey. “I gotta get out of here, just a few hours,” he says.
In just a flash, an army of aliens are charging at him with lethal force and Tony brings his arms up to protect himself, but before he feels the blast knock him over, a shield gets in front of him, diverting the fire.
Rhodey turns back to him then. "And we can just trust people nowadays, right? It's not like Nazis have infiltrated the country— and even positions of power within it," Rhodey adds, his hand slightly raised at Yu.
"I kinda gave up after the first few months. I keep thinking: 'hey, if it's my soulmate, then it will happen, eventually', right?" Sam says. "So, as I said, I wouldn't know what to tell you regarding how to deal with your soulmate. But— I do know this: communication is key. To every kind of relationship," he adds and raises his eyebrows at him.
“It would appear Miss Potts isn’t in the building,” JARVIS informs him. Tony’s eyebrows turn into a line.
There's no way he'll give Maya the key to building a biological weapon for a psychopath like Killian.
He watches the news on a TV in a store from outside and learns what he had much gathered after his escape, it’s in color now, women are far more prominent –that’s a good thing, and, just like Nick had said, the world still needs help. War and violence are still alive and walking around.
Tony grabs the earpiece and puts it on. "It's still debatable," he says. "Probably tipping your way a little bit. Hey, this is a good look, by the way," Tony says, moving his finger up and down at her. "I'm diggin' it, you should try it more often. Sports bra, the whole deal," he jokes as he stands up.
“Can’t confirm nor deny,” Tony shrugs. “Listen,” he adds, grabbing Rhodey’s arm just after they exit the place. “I wanted your help with this—”
"Fuck," Steve lets out sharply, softly, all of the sudden when Tony taps his tongue on one of his nipples in the same breath he pulls his pants down.
“You flew into space!” Pepper yells, her nose red with hot anger. “I had my heart up my throat, Tony. I thought I'd never see you again!” she adds, pushing him on his chest.
Tony exits the suit quietly and walks around the lab. "Sentry mode," he commands the armor. "Okay, Jarvis, you know. I want it all. Make sure you copy Hill at HQ," he says, going through all HYDRA's data.
Rhodey sighs, exhausted. “This is some serious bull, Tones,” he mutters and Tony feels sad for him. Rhodey got so close yet so far.
So he nods and sits on a stool and waits for Álvarez to take the other. Then raises his beer for him to click his drink.
Rhodey just sighs and looks the other way. "Of all the dumb things you could've ever done. Ever. Tony—"
"We have reasons to believe he was involved in the infiltration of HYDRA into SHIELD, different KGB-perpetrated assaults, at least four cases of Soviet-organized Coups across the globe and," General Yu pauses on his exposition and looks at Ross before adding, with his fingers entwined: "President Kennedy's assassination."
“That sounds better. It’ll give our big green friend time to come back,” Thor agrees with a hopeful smile and then he's gone.
Steve presses on the button to his room. “Right. What kind of monster would let a German scientist experiment on them to protect their country?” he asks, sarcastically.
"Ugh, please tell me you didn't have sex in my nephew's room," Clint groans, his arms crossed as he rests against the sink.
“But we shouldn’t talk about this,” Álvarez says, thank fuck. Rhodey feels his neck getting hot and he’s not even sure why he’s nervous.
"Oh, yeah. It's a word in an African dialect meaning 'thief'," Bruce shares, fixing his glasses. "In a much less friendly way," he adds.
Tony shrugs. “That’s not a lie,” he agrees. “I’m sorry, Rhodey,” he adds. “Hey, maybe I can look through Howard’s crazy big library, I’m sure he has a huge ass encyclopedia on Soulmates Scars,” he offers.
Tony smiles and looks at the table, then moves his head around in a vague positive reply. "Not everything you read about me online is true, though," he makes sure to add.
"No," Tony says innocently, turning. "It's probably not, right? This is very terrible. Is it so...Is it so—" a laugh cuts him off and he gathers himself quickly, but he's still smiling. Steve can feel his stomach run cold. "It is. It's so terrible."
Rhodey pushes him by the shoulder, where the mark of his name is. “In your dreams, Richie Rich,” he tells him.
His name on Rogers’ lips almost make him feel suffocated, but all he does is nod and raise his eyebrows sarcastically. “Right. I’ve heard that before,” he says, the memory of Rogers’ words back in the lab still fresh.
Tony gives him a last polite smile and makes his way to go, leaving Steve to sulk on his lack of charmingness.
Tony raises his head at that and narrows his eyes, then he moves around to pour himself another drink. "I'd say I don't believe much in that but it hasn't even been a year since I saw a fucking alien ship with my own two eyes," Tony says, then takes a drink.
Tony rubs the back of his head with his other hand and then looks at his car for a second, Steve takes that brief picture and captures it in his memory. Tony’s profile, lit by the bright, shiny sun setting at his back. His strong jaw, with its spotlessly shaven goatee, and his lean, perfectly curved nose, supporting his shiny, expensive sunglasses, closing with a great set of soft-looking brown hair.
“Another comment on my appearance? I’m going to start thinking I’m only eye-candy to you,” he jokes and Steve wants to be amused by it, or maybe even embarrassed, but all he can see is Tony deflecting.
"Okay, well, hold that thought," Tony says, then grabs the drive he set up last night for his suit and War Machine. "Let me over-night you a new encryption drive for your suit, in case Ultron wants in," he says.
"Yeah, but how close did we come? I nearly died," Tony refutes and Steve zips his mouth close. Tony knows his eyes are watering up but he's not gonna lose this that easily. "What if you're next? Huh?"
into the whole thing, which meant, pretty likely, that if Tony went anywhere near the action chances of running into
“They’re like children, aren’t they?” she mutters to him, following Barton into the jet. Banner –who turned back into his regular size just after Loki was out of sight—walked in quietly and Thor sat next to him smiling.
“Well, you’re the boss, Mister Stark. It is in the job description,” she jokes and Tony already likes this girl.
‘You gotta be careful what you wish for,’ lingers above his head and Rhodey wants to kick himself to death, right there.
Dying at the hands of a man dressed up in a countries' flag colors is not how he imagined his end, but there's a twisted irony to this. He would even laugh, if it didn't hurt his chest with the huge piece of metal that collapsed on him crushing him.
Steve whispers a “Thank you” before Thor shakes his head a bit and stops in their tracks, standing between them.
Rhodey swallows at that but he tries to hide it. He doesn't really know how to bring it out. "Why does there have to be something that I need? I could've just decided to drop by," he says.
He runs a hand across Tony’s sweaty face, to the back of his ear, to the back of his head and he pulls him again, presses another wet kiss into his mouth and Tony bites so hard he rips.
“You don’t have to tell me if you don’t want to. But we both know that’s not true,” Steve says quietly. Not like he’s asking or trying to pry, not like he’s begging Tony to trust him right away with whatever secret he’s hiding. Which is something Steve desperately wants to do, but can never bring himself to.
They don’t fill the air with any other unnecessary, dangerous statements. They’re getting excellent at saying everything they feel with their glances alone.
Just two days before Christmas Eve, Tony appeared with plane tickets to Philly. “Go on, I don’t want Roberta to get mad at me for hoarding her son,” he jokes, handing Rhodey the tickets.
“Did you have a long day? Would you like a massage?” Tony asks, moving around to put his metal hands on her shoulders and squeeze a little.
Rhodey stares at the files on his hands. “Wow. Did he kill Jesus, too?” he mutters, his tone serene.
Allen blinks at him with his mouth slightly open. Rhodey figures it's the expected kind of response.
Steve lets out a breath, he's had this conversation over thirteen different times just last week. "It takes some getting used to. It's good to meet you, Sam," he says, making to go.
Tony scoffs. "Whatever for?" he says, waving a hand off. "That alone was the best sexual experience of my life. And I didn't even come," he adds and it's some kind of sweet.
“Why shouldn't they guy let off a little steam?” Tony asks, nonchalantly moving his arm around and trying to pat the Captain’s shoulder.
Rhodey arrives just two days later to read on a report that Nick Fury's died and HYDRA's infiltrated SHIELD all these years and they were fact of immediately disbanded as a government organization.
"Goodnight," Pierce replies, his eyes still glued to him. "Want some milk?" he asks him, his tone suddenly changing.
The first day runs smoothly. The physical test is nothing Rhodey wasn’t prepared for, and he also manages to excel in it.
Tony smiles a little. “Let me guess, Brooklyn?” he asks and Steve frowns, but in a friendly way. “I figured,” Tony adds, moving one shoulder up.
Tony nods. “If you had to guess, what's it look like it's doing?” he asks but Bruce barely lets him finish.
Tony looks around them and shrugs. "Why, you got other plans? Some charming evening sponsored by Grindr?" Tony asks, quirking one eyebrow, jokingly.
He breaks into a room through the window and they start showering him in bullets. "Guys, stop. We gotta talk this through," he says.
he sees him. The blond man of the bridge. Smiling up at him like he's not there to kill him. But he's different, too. He's shorter, he's skinny, the hair isn't the same.
Turns out, Tony didn't have the greatest childhood: went into boarding school when he was a teenager then got into college then lost both his parents— all things very fast, very young.
They lose Coulson like fucking amateurs. Like they’re a bunch of kids running in costumes with no idea of what they’re doing.
Pepper bites her lower lip just to get it from making a pout. She’s known something was wrong for way too long, now.
Clint looks down for a second and then grabs Laura's hand. "She's my sister. Sister. Period," he says, but it's more to her than him. "And, Fury helped me keep all this off S.H.I.E.L.D.'s files. I'd like to keep it that way," he adds, turning back to them. "I figure it's a good place to lay low."
Steve smiles and looks down. “I’m fine. I – I know how to get there,” he says, before he has time to reconsider how that sounds.
“No?” Yinsen repeats, doing a tiny nod. “So you're a man who has everything... and nothing,” he adds.
"That's confidential. You can't— tweet about it," Rhodey says, before he locks the phone and turns back to the previous conversation.
In the dark screen he sees his own reflection and recognizes every bit of his face, unchanged, untouched, frozen in time. Just like he is.
Behind them, Agent Romanoff stands still as she says: “Gentlemen, you may wanna step inside in a minute. It's gonna get a little hard to breath.”
Steve looks down, his arms crossed. "Jarvis was the first line of defense. He would have shut Ultron down. It makes sense," he says, looking down.
“I'm Virginia Potts, from Stark Industries,” a woman says. Steve looks out the window and swallows. “Mister Stark has – hmm, asked me to contact you. He's been very busy,” she says and Steve sits upright on his chair.
Everything turns dark around him as he stares into the wide-open, black space. Just like he remembered it was.
Tony looks up and his breath gets caught up his throat. A Chitauri ship hangs above his head, unmoving.
“Yeah,” Rhodey adds on. “Anyways, I still gotta do some fourteen more months of another training program and then I’ll be set to go,” he says.
“That way you can have privacy but also that view for, well, just about anything you wanna do in here,” Tony explains, just as he’s stepping away from a table he was covering.
“That's palladium, 0.15 grams. We need at least 1.6, so why don't you go break down the other eleven?” Tony says.
“I…think he would’ve been freaked out, for sure, but – it’s your very special way of honoring him,” Rhodey says, shrugging. “It’s pretty neat, Tony.”
Steve lays his arm across the back of the couch and Tony's eyes do a little sparkle before he takes the hint and leans forward to rest on his shoulder. Steve smiles a big smile as he rests his face on top of Tony's head.
Agent Romanoff chuckles next to Agent Barton. “If you should be so lucky. He only gets like that with people he’s comfortable around,” she explains, before she goes over to the jeep standing by her and Barton to grab a bag.
He shows Bruce to one of the labs of the tower and tells him he can set up in any of the rooms on the floor. The Doctor nods at him and shakes his hand. “Just for a couple of days, until I can get around coming back to this place,” Bruce says, almost too softly, looking down at the floor.
Tony peeks out through the window. “I'm sorry; this is the fun-vee. The hum-drum-vee is back there,” he tells him.
He throws the thing back with enough force to ground the blond man off balance and when the man looks down to it, he disappears through the night.
“Yes, and I'm not leaving because suddenly you get a little twitchy,” he replies, walking over to the screen. “I'd like to know why SHIELD is using the Tesseract to build weapons of mass destruction,” Bruce asks, loudly.
Tony on his seat is looking like he's struggling to speak for a second, looking between down and back to Steve's deep blue eyes. Steve raises his eyebrows, waiting for an answer, when Tony seems to understand: "Oh, you mean the drawing—" he says.
He takes a look at the tower himself. Standing tall and imposing behind a crowd of smaller buildings, with a big, bright, and honestly a little tacky ‘Stark’ sign almost on top.
On one of the couches, Clint had his legs resting on Natasha’s lap as she went through a ‘Women in Power’ magazine with Dr. Elizabeth Ross as the cover. In the other one, Tony was resting against Steve’s shoulder as Steve had all his arm laid on the back of the couch, gently rubbing Tony’s arm.
"Pretty close— Sokovia," Maria says, looking over back to him through the mirror slightly above her.
At that Steve lets out a light chuckle. “This is really nice of you,” he tells Tony, almost too softly.
Though doing a few missions with them wasn’t exactly bad for him. Rhodey would easily admit to liking having a 'crew'. Only with a few beers in his system, though.
“желание,” this handler says, and he wants to say that’s not necessary but a breath gets caught up in his throat.
Ever since Rhodey met him, back in a messy campus party he was far too young to be in, he’s known Tony’s a sad guy. One look into his eyes is enough for anyone to learn he spends a great deal of his time feeling like shit.
"Yeah, right," Tony says, waving him off with a hand. Harley smiles innocently but Tony replies with a smile of his own.
“Three out of five people who go into the triangle die,” Tony says, defensively. Maria is now giving him a dirty look. Joke backfired.
Peggy takes a deep breath and looks down. “Howard was – complicated. His relationship with Tony wasn’t good. But that’s not something you should hear from me,” she tells him.
“Hey, hey. No,” Steve mutters, and he opens his hand for Tony to reach over. “I should be the one going hyper-verbal and – giving you giant rabbit teddys to get you to forgive me,” he says, grabbing Tony’s hand and rubbing his thumb on it.
“Threat is imminent, and I have to protect the things that I can't live without. One of those being you,” Tony says, almost not looking at her. “And my suits, they're—”
"Take my credit card, here," Rhodey hands it to him. "Go back to the Pentagon. Tell them I'm getting all this done," he explains, getting the suitcase out.
Natasha gives in and smiles, turns away from him and watches the road. "Alright, fine. Maybe I'm trying to ask you about him without actually having to ask you," she explains.
He makes it back to the vault with his chest heaving, suffocated. He keeps playing back the face of the man and his shocked stare and pleading eyes.
“Asshole!” someone yells at him when he misses the red light and keeps driving ahead. His heart racing, his mind in near state of shock.
Pepper smiles widely; it almost makes her look older than she actually is. “Hey, Rhodey,” she says. “Is Tony close?” she asks a beat later.
And then Tony runs his hand through his hair and soothes, and he runs his other hand across his face and soothes. He kisses him and he soothes.
"About being an open book or about whatever he told you about yourself?" Steve asks, sitting on the bed, his back against the headboard.
"There's no way I'm having sex in Clint's kid's bedroom," Tony says, serious and Steve shakes in laughs. "Nope, just no. That bunny's gonna stare at me the whole night," he says, looking at a blue-greyish bunny teddy sitting on top of the shelf.
“But you're not the only people out there, are you?” Fury replies, turning towards Thor. “And, you're not the only threat. The world's filling up with people who can't be matched, that can't be controlled,” he adds, to all of them.
He turns, arching an eyebrow. "Why am I going to keep looking for Ultron?" Tony asks but he knows better.
Tony follows him almost absent-minded and sees his captors coming in, holding Stark weaponry. “Those are my guns. How did they get my guns?” he wonders.
Tony’s mouth draws up in one corner. “Always,” he replies, lifting his mug high for Steve to take. Steve goes into the kitchen for a second and returns with full mugs, steam rising out of them.
“Push the button next to you,” Tony says, behind him, and Steve turns to the right to find a button attached to the wall.
Steve’s heart peaks and he turns to Peggy, who’s sighing. “You think SHIELD’s onto this?” he asks, turning back to see the news lady go on in detail about the attack.
"Wouldn't have been my first call," the suit answers. "But, down in the real world, we're faced with ugly choices."
Tony stands in front of him with an open look and searches for his eyes until Rhodey raises his head back again.
“Central to my Administration's response to this terrorist event, is a newly minted resource,” President Ellis says on T.V. “I know him as Colonel James Rhodes, the American people will soon know him as the Iron Patriot,” he adds before Rhodey steps in the spotlight.
Pepper follows her, sits at the end of the mattress and looks attentively at Maya, who is clearly occupied by what's on her mind.
“It’s alright, Captain. We don’t judge here,” Nick says, opening his hand at Steve, as if to calm him down, and Steve just sighs and closes his mouth. Nick goes back to his computers and Steve just stands there, resigned.
Rhodey stands from the table he was resting on. "He's in your files, he's on the Internet— what if he decides to access something a little more exciting?" he wonders. Steve's not quite following.
This might be the last chapter I post before New Year's. Might also not be. Either way, happy holidays! :D
The Captain puts on a vicious smile. “Yeah, big man in a suit of armor,” he begins, walking around him like a cheetah around its pray. “Take that off, what are you?”
They kick off almost immediately, Rhodey’s having a hard time trying to remember the last time he made a friend so fast but he’s coming up empty. At only sixteen (‘Bordering on seventeen, mind you, sugarbear’), Tony was pure excitement and rush, an explosion of creativity and hyper-activeness; all curled up into a 5’2 ball of glasses and daddy issues.
“Alright, I gotta go talk to some investors— can you see he doesn’t cause himself harm?” Pepper shares, then talks to Rhodey, who nods at her, and gives him a kiss on the cheek before disappearing out of the lab.
I wrote this chapter some five or so months ago and re-reading its end now, knowning how Steve's canon story arc ends, well,
"I have changed, haven't I?" Peggy asks, softly. Steve chuckles in reply. "So have you," she adds, twisting his hands slowly to rub her thumb over his wrist, on top of his mark. "He told you to call me, didn't he?"
Pepper rolls her eyes at him but she's amused, and he can already see he's growing on Maya, too, even if it's by extension to Pepper.
"Who's ever standing, we got to move!" he can hear Clint in the far distance as he takes unsteady steps, holding onto the railing. "Guys?" Clint calls but he's no longer standing on a ship.
"Hey, fellas," she says, a smirk on her face. "Either one of you know where the Smithsonian is? I'm here to pick up a fossil," she adds.
“I overstepped myself, I’m sorry,” Steve says, quickly. Tony just mimes zipping Steve’s mouth shut and takes a breath.
"I'm sorry about this," he tells Sam as soon as he opens the door, with a surprised look on his face. "We need a place to lay low," Steve adds.
He has the very unique silhouette of the city of the skyscrapers on his sight-range in just shy of fifty minutes later, but there’s no sign of chaos, just disaster.
"No, you're in a dungeon. I'm free to go," Maya says, calm. Tony mutters a ‘yeah' and shakes his head again. Maya gets up from her stool with a sigh. "A lot has happened, Tony," she says, making her way towards him while he pulls at the zip-ties but fails at freeing himself. "But I'm close. Extremis is practically stabilized—"
"Kid, you can't just sneak up on us like that. Your mother's worried out there," Rhodey says to Harley then, hands on his hips.
Tony gives him a tight hug and whispers a ‘be safe’ to his ear before he’s off again to the very first hell-on-earth Tony ever truly knew.
Steve only frowns in return. “The what?” Steve asks and Nick takes a step closer to him, still looking down.
“Mister Rhodes,” Jarvis greets with a fond smile. “I am sorry, correction, Second Lieutenant Rhodes,” he says, doing a little nod. He’s gotten older since the last time Rhodey saw him –which wasn’t long ago—but he figures it must be the stress of dealing with a genius CEO with a bit of over-the-top ego.
Steve smiles down at Tony's hands and then nods at him. "I agree," he says. Tony's eyes linger on him for a long second and then their lips meet again. Tony nibbles at his lower lip before he starts groaning.
“It’s your floor here, in the Tower,” Tony says, like that explains a lot. “Look, I know it might seem like a lot but I just thought, you know, if we have to be assembled again, it would be cool if Bruce and I can tinker around in a lab without SHIELD goons looking at our every move. Then I figured you guys would appreciate a place to work out, train, get your head of things,” he says, pointing at the drawing board behind Steve. “Plus, you know Thor is technically homeless when he comes here, right?”
Tony, who had been resting his back against the bar table and watched silently as they exchange occurred, goes: “It’s his birthday.”
Out of the ocean, a turbine appears and starts, along with other three around the carrier, and takes them off the sea into the sky.
“At this point, I doubt anything would surprise me,” Steve comments, standing back up from the bench.
Tony jokes about getting ‘Rhodey’ tattooed on his back in January but when he turns 18 in May, ‘James Rhodes’ appears clean on his left shoulder-blade and that makes him not dwell much on the fact that nature screwed him over too.
Tony looks around them before he smiles at Pepper on the phone. “Oh, just a little victory present, you all know me,” Tony says.
Tony shifts on the bed to turn his body fully to him. “Steve, I know you must have skeletons in your closet. Everyone does,” he tells him, running a hand across the side of his head. “I’m not kidding when I said I hated you before. It’s why I made it so hard for you at first, and now I just think I wasted so much energy for nothing I mean— look at me now,” Tony says, opening his arms. Then he leans in closer, his eyes bare to Steve’s. “I’ve never wanted someone as bad as I want you,” he says low.
Seventy years. He’s been frozen in the artic sea for nearly an entire century. “How am I alive?” he asks, frowning just a little.
It’s coffee for now and then he can hit the market. He sits and drinks the warm beverage; lets it roll down his throat with the accustomed ease and breathes in the clear air coming from the window.
Steve turns around in his bed, puts his arm under his pillow and snuggles it. He takes a deep breath and feels a numbing pain in his heart when the flash of Bucky's smile crosses his mind.
Rhodey grabs the napkin and smiles faintly at him. “Thanks. I’m sorry,” he still says and then watches as Álvarez leaves through the door, waving Tony goodbye by the door.
It isn’t anything good, because soon Yinsen stutters an answer and then he’s forced down to kneel. The bald man grabs a burning carbon from the fire and grabs Yinsen’s head.
“Uhh, ran management at a McDonald’s for eight months?” Rhodey gives, stuttering a little, as he goes through the young woman’s file.
“You know I can help, just ask,” Tony offers, again. “I got a ton of new tech, I got a prehensile suit. I got a— I got a bomb disposal, catches explosions mid-air,” he says.
He stands up and looks around his dorm. No sight of Tony, at least until he spots the little white sheet attached to U.
Rhodey lets that sink in. His soulmate is trying to get rid of him, has been trying for a long time now.
"And I tried to kill mine,” Rhodey interrupts, remembering with a knot in his throat, turning to Tony, who’s looking back at him attentively.  “Remember? When I got the suit and Vanko hacked into it? I was shooting at you and I was shooting to kill," Rhodey reminds him.
The man walks around Tony, opening his hands, talking in the language Tony doesn’t dare to name and waits for the old man to repeat in English. “He says they have everything you need to build a Jericho missile. He wants you to make the list of materials — He says for you to start working immediately, and when you're done, he will set you free,” the old man explains.
Tony looks like he’s never been touched in his life before but as he opens his mouth to respond, the elevator beeps open again.
Steve's eyes shine bright but Tony can still remember its dull blue when he was dying. Because he wasn’t smart enough to keep him safe, to keep them all safe.
Tony swallows and he lets out a soft smile but it's somewhat shaky. "Well, I'm not opposed to that at all— we, we got time. Tomorrow, after the dinner party—" Tony's saying but then Steve frowns and he stops. "What?"
"Uhhh, nope, no. God, I hate myself. Seriously, I need to go. Kick me out before it's too late," Tony complains on his lips and Steve laughs.
“We throw one of these in with every purchase of 500 million or more. To peace!” Tony says, raising his glass of whiskey, and then his phone buzzes in his pocket.
He can taste blood on his tongue from how hard he's biting as he stares at the stand of the man he used to be.
Rhodey opens his palms. "But no, they refused to see it that way. And then there's this weird feeling that Ross gave me about it—"
Maya shoots daggers with her eyes. "If I die, Killian, what happens to your soldiers? What happens to your product?" she asks, taking a few steps back from them.
"And Stark would know about that? Does he keep them on a system or something? All supers, like that guy from The Incredibles?" Allen asks.
“They look Chinese, they sound Chinese, but they're actually an American invention. Which is why they're hollow, full of lies, and leave a bad taste in the mouth,” the Mandarin preaches, just before he squashes some fortune cookies. “My disciples just destroyed another cheap American knock-off: the Chinese Theater,” he says and they show images of the place burning. “Mr. President, I know this must be getting frustrating, but this season of terror is drawing to a close. And don't worry, the big one is coming; your graduation,” he finishes, just as they show him shooting a picture of President Ellis.
"Look, it's been a really long day," Tony interrupts him. "Like Eugene O'Neill long, so how's about we skip to the part where you're useful."
Tony rolls his eyes. “Of course you’d say that,” he says but there’s no malice in his tone so Steve chuckles.
“I must have called him in my sleep,” Tony explains, his face sweating. “That’s not supposed to happen,” he adds. “I’ll have to— uh, recalibrate the sensors,” he plans.
"Ultron could be in any system, he could be pulling planes down from the sky. What if he's just doing what he's supposed to?" Hill considers.
The Captain looks at him with a straight face, like he’s fighting something in himself not to glare at Tony.
“Ok is this about you not having sex with men before or something else?” Tony asks, a wondering look on his eyes.
"I watched my friends die. You'd think that'd be as bad as it gets, right?" Tony says, making a face. "Nope— it wasn't the worst part," he trails.
Rhodey smiles at him and Tony turns back, to a stand where you can see Steve in his former, smaller size. Rhodey only but briefly pays attention to it as he turns to look back further in the room.
"Who's ready for drinks?" Thor yells, a smile on his face, as he puts his arm around the robot, who they've decided to call Vision.
“I—no. Obviously not,” Allen says, after a tired sigh. Rhodey hits the gas. “What if he ends up hurting people later, Jim?" he asks, a few minutes later, as he looks through the window. "Have you thought of that?”
“The Stark Tower? That big ugly—” Tony moves his head swiftly to quirk an eyebrow at the Captain, making he cut his phrase. “—building in New York?” he finishes, only barely looks back at Tony.
But Tony shifts in his spot and his face turns serious. “Why? You can’t tell him about this,” Tony says.
Rhodey gives him a look and takes it in for a second. But then he shakes his head and shrugs. "Well, maybe he
He takes off his pants and boxer briefs with lazy patience, and then goes for his long-sleeved shirt. One arm first then the other and he goes into the shower with his eyelids half-way down.
She’s only taken a few steps in when she goes: “There’s a giant bunny outside,” Pepper declares, her thumb over her shoulder. “Oh, what?” she says as she notices the Iron Man armor lying on the couch, just chilling.
Tony gives him a courtesy nod before making his way towards and into his car, Bruce waves him once more and off they ride. Steve stands there for a minute before his brain starts working regularly again.
Tony leaves the barn to find all the wood has been chopped and there's not much to do anymore so he figures a good night sleep is overdue, so he asks Clint where to go and then enters the room to find Steve folding what seemed to be the shirt he was wearing earlier, now wearing what's definitely one of Clint's shirts that's far too small for him.
The man looks down at his grip and takes the metal hand off his arm, calmly. Then he takes his earpiece out in front of Bucky and tosses it to the side.
,” Rhodey says, but he sounds amused enough. “No, Tones, I mean I got a name, a mark,” he explains, pressing on the last word.
Steve opens his eyes, which he didn't realize he had closed, and stares up at the gorgeous man on top of him, biting his lower lip.
Steve looks at him in the eyes and swallows. “It’s not just that, I—I've been thinking and I just realized—" Steve says, then wets his lower lip. "Tony, most of the time I forget really just how little time has passed. For me," he says.
‘Could it be…’ he thinks vaguely, his eyes wandering through the single page on Howard until he spots something different: lying on the table is another file, different from the others, new.
Rhodey shifts on his seat and looks for a file. "Here," he says, throwing the folder for Allen to see. "Barnes' unit was captured for months by the Axis. He was forced into labor work at a weapons facility. A HYDRA's weapon facility," Rhodey explains as Allen reads. "He was a prisoner of war. Of the Nazis. So how does he wind up and become one? How did he survive falling off a running train? Why did he want to kill his best friend?"
Yu sighs and goes back to his chair. "I'm going to give you a week to gather as much intel on Barnes as you can," he says, sitting. "I'm sure once you know how terrible he is, you'll be comfortable with this mission," he says, gathering all the open files and placing them on a pile and handing them over for Rhodey to grab.
"You should do it," Natasha mutters to Steve before taking a sip of water and then raising the glass of champagne again.
Tony just shakes his head. "We don't have that many problems, Steve," he says but Steve's looking down, somber.
“James Rhodes. Pleasure to meet you, Doctor,” Rhodey says, but he saves the handshake because the doctor’s hands are full with shawarma. He nods and smiles in return, his mouth full, too.
Tony looks at him with his mouth half open and then gives up. “You give me way too much credit, Steve,” he sighs, his shoulders falling.
Pierce nods at him. "Oh, we know. Don't worry. I'll take care of that," Pierce says, putting a hand on his shoulder like they're comrades. Like he cares.
“You still didn't tell me where you're from,” Tony tells him, just minutes after they’re done putting the arc reactor inside his chest.
“I know. I wanted to,” Tony’s quick to say, taking a few steps back, back into the main room. “Are you sure you like it, though? I don’t even know if you like the color blue,” he says, pointing at the walls.
“Jarvis has been running it since I hit the bridge,” Tony interrupts him, looking at his device. “In a few hours we'll know every dirty secret SHIELD has ever tried to hide. Blueberry?” Tony offers the Captain, in good nature, but only so he stops bugging Tony.
“This is what I'm talking about, the glitch,” she starts saying, turning to look at the closed door.
Tony almost wants to roll his eyes. "Oh, really, I didn't know that, at all. That is weird, right? It's not like we even have reasons to be frustrated," Tony says sarcastically, pressing the last phrase at Clint's face.
It takes Tony to come back longer than Steve was prepared for, so much that he was starting to doubt his clumsiness just outright made Tony run away.
Tony chokes in on a breath and realizes, bitterly, what he’s already known for the past three weeks: there’s no sleeping for him.
‘Stay out of this,' Rhodey had begged but Tony, as usual, hadn't listened. And now, not only was Rhodey going to have to fix this whole mess, but he also had to worry about Tony's ass in the process.
"Is it?" Hill asks. "If it was my mission— world peace, I'd probably take out Strucker too," she adds.
Allen gives him a look before sighing and readjusting on his seat, so he can lean in closer to Rhodey across the desk. "Listen, Jim, I was here. Last week— it was pretty scary stuff. I told Helen to stay home for three days because I didn't wanna risk her and Hannah," he says, concerned.
Tony nods and then they make their glass meet lightly. Tony takes a big gulp and Steve tries his drink, he has to close his eyes for a moment at how strong of a punch the drink packed.
“Howard Stark fished that out of the ocean when he was looking for you,” Nick tells him, after Steve flips through the files. “He thought what we think, the Tesseract could be the key to unlimited sustainable energy. That's something the world sorely needs,” Nick explains.
Tony strides right to the center of the room, on a slightly higher level than the rest of the floor and behind him, Steve sees it, at least the early stage of it.
“Один,” the handler sighs, like he’s tired too. He twists the hand into a fist and waits the final switch to go off.
Steve's about to start considering dragging him back up when Tony buries his face in his crotch, without further ado.
He wakes up the second time and sits up slowly. The stranger hands him a warm, ripped towel to clean his face, pull himself together and a mirror.
“It reminds you of the word ‘virgin’, nobody wants tha—“ Tony falls silent as soon as his eyes land on the redhead standing in front of him. “
He's entirely washed over an incredible, completely exciting, rush of feelings and sensations unlike any other thing he's ever felt. Being inside Tony was like throwing yourself off a three thousand high waterfall, with a whirlpool of lava waiting for you below in case gravity alone didn't kill you.
Tony moves one shoulder in a vague shrug. “Yeah, I’m alright. Why do you ask?” he replies, a little too casually.
"You're changing the subject," Tony points out, squinting an eye. But then his look turns softer and he smiles sympathetically. "Was it— terrible again this time?" Tony asks.
Tony's eyes go wide. "Holy shit!" he shouts but Rhodey shakes him to keep quiet. "You found your soulmate?" he asks then, his voice low.
"Neither do we," Tony mutters before he kills the line. He stands up and goes to Clint. "Hey, you wanna switch out?" he offers.
"It's even worse when there's a window for reproduction, too. Let me tell you..." Clint trails as Tony makes his way back. "Why did you think Natasha and I tried to kill each other so many times when we first met?"
He pulls her into a hug that lasts for decades, as far as he is concerned, and gives her a kiss on the side of her head, thanking whatever deity above him that she's alive for him to hold.
agree that's a thing that happens sometimes?" Tony defends and Rhodey gives him a look. "Ok, look—Steve hasn’t said a word about it to me,” he reveals, averting his eyes.
"Oh, and Steve," Tony calls, stopping on his tracks and waiting for Steve to look up at him again. Once Steve does, Tony throws him something tiny and Steve catches it without much effort. "I hope I see you again, soon," he adds, flashing his brand grin.
“That was thirty minutes ago. He’s in Hungary,” Allen whispers. “Listen, what’s a tiny detour on the suit? You’re already on your way out,” he asks.
"Eh, I'll think about it," Clint still said, looking at his display of newer arrowheads. Tony had turned on his heel to leave him alone when Clint blurted: "Tony, wait— the kid?" he asked.
“And I mean, I got a little hungry, so I had a quick bite. I didn't know you had pizza plans for us, since you seemed so interested in Aldrich Killian,” Tony says and the suit turns to her, as if to look at her accusingly.
Steve chuckles and shrugs. “I was actually thinking they’re pretty good,” Steve says and looks at Tony.
It's not that he's not the kind of person to open up to a colleague about his personal life, it's that Natasha is not the type of colleague to care about that sort of stuff.
“Good evening, Captain. Welcome back,” the computer’s voice that runs Tony's tower greets him inside the elevator.
"You'd do good to lay low for a while, before you make someone run out of patience," Fury had muttered to him and Natasha as they stare at all of the people they just kept out of danger.
“I promise you’ll be seeing me again before you can even miss me,” Tony adds, then bumps Steve’s shoulder in a friendly manner.
"Seriously, that's the comment you gonna make right now?" Rhodey says, raising his eyebrows. Then he looks down again and rubs his thumb on his 'James'. "Dammit," he mutters.
“Yeah, apparently I'm volatile, self-obsessed, don't play well with others,” Tony tells him, assembling the tab.
Tony pushes the door of the restaurant and as soon as he’s in he finds Rogers standing in front of him, taking a few steps back quickly so they don’t run into each other.
Rhodey finds out after his daily run, on the TV of his favorite sandwich place. The falling of a titan, they call it; Rhodey only sees it as the end of life as Tony knows it.
Tony's been staring at the window while everyone else was cleaning up for about an hour and a half now. Part of him wondered if Steve was ever gonna come back from his stroll, the other part of him knew he would.
“Yeah but I’m not sure your résumé is qualified enough to do that,” Tony says and the look the guy gives him makes Rhodey choke on a laugh, which earns him a dirty look.
“We'll lose,” Tony says and Steve doesn't know if he means them as a team or them as whatever the two of them are.
"So, what are you gonna do?" Allen asks him and Rhodey looks at the watch, it's only 9 A.M. so he has enough time to fly to New York on the suit.
“Well, you won’t get anything more from those fragments than we already got. And I’ve gotta move—see if I can lend a hand with that ‘situation in New York’,” he tells his superior officer.
They've been working in silence for a while when Tony finally speaks. "Thor didn't say where he was going for answers?" he asks.
Tony lets out the breath he was holding and Steve looks down. "God, I really hate that man," Tony mutters.
“We’re here live from the Institute for Infectious Diseases Headquarters in Lagos, Nigeria, where an altercation between known criminal Brock Rumlow and Captain America has gotten out of hand and has resulted in a death toll of over twenty people,” the reporter says and Rhodey lets himself rest, half-sitting on his desk, his jaw dropping.
He turns to face the man with visible discomfort but the man stares back at him shocked as soon as he sees his face.
"No, I don't. That's exactly the problem," Rhodey says, standing up from his chair. "I don't know anything about this guy and you want me to go looking for him, shoot first, ask questions later," he says, standing in front of Yu.
But this time, as Steve was about to leave, Tony grabbed him by his wrist, his fingers curling up around it, covering his own name on Steve’s skin. “Don’t—go,” Tony whispered, his eyes closed.
It makes Natasha smile a faint smile, but it's worth it. "I owe you," she says, a beat later. Her face suddenly changing.
"Hi, sweetheart!" Clint says, hugging her, then he puts his arm around the boy. "Hey, buddy. How are you guys doing?"
I walked up to bucky's door thinking about everything, there was butterflies in my stomach and a lone lily in my hand, I know Bucky is not the type you expect to like flowers, but he loved lilies. He always told me about how much he loved them just because it was his mother's favorite.
I know he liked when I called him James, so I kept doing that, he pushed another one in and now had four fingers in me, he pulled them out and put a condom on his dick he pointed it at my hole, he pushed the tip inside me making me moan loud, he also moaned and pushed himself al the way inside me, he waited a bit so I could get used to his size before he started fucking me hard, he held my legs over my head as he fucked my ass hard, we both moaned loudly as he started kissing me, his tongue forced down my throat and I let my tongue slip in his mouth. He came in my ass and trusted softer and started jerking me of, and I came over my stomach and he stopped and pulled out as he took the condom off throwing it on the floor and laid down, I laid my head on his chest and softly said.
Steve: "I decided to join my boyfriend in the army" I said checking to se if anyone was around to hear
I knocked on the door, my heart was pounding so hard and I could hear it, there he was standing in the doorway, MY boyfriend
I cut him of with a kiss on his lips, they were so soft and tasted like strawberry, he really uses strawberry scented lip balm, and I'm the gay one, the kiss was long and passioned until we had to pull back both breathing hard after the long kiss, I could still taste him on my lips as we got down to the ground floor and got out.
N: "I know about you and Tony, we all know there has been tension between you guys since we all moved together"
F: "Hey, you need to go on a secret mission, we have heard that the winter soldier is back in action and you guys are the only ones who stand a chance against him"
I said that and saw the hunger in his eyes, and I guess he could see the hunger in mine cause he kissed me hard, he pressed me closer and grabbed my ass hard so our crotches were rubbing against each other's, he was growing against me and I felt tiny against him.
she took a paus and then she started talking again but all I could think of was Bucky, how I already missed his strong long arms around me. he had told me how guys in the army could sometimes sleep together just to keep warm in the cold nights.
B: "well you know what I think about that, but I'll guess Peggy will take care of you she is the best"
I gave her a small hug before I got into the staircase walking down the many stairs to Tony's lab beneath the ground, there was a code leading into his lab so not anyone could get in, I typed the code in and heard FRIDAY from the speakers above me asking me to identify myself, with name, age and alias, I did so and the door open up seeing Tony standing in the middle of the room fixated on whatever he was working on, I walked up to him and wrapped my arms around him making him jump a little before he noticed it was me and put the thing down he held in his hand and turned around looking me into the eyes and taking my hands into his.
They all got up and walked out of the room, leaving me and Thor alone in the room to clean up after everyone, we did a fast cleanup before I ran back to my room putting my suit on, under the suit in the drawer was a picture of him it was black and white, it was old and had rugged edges, that was the only picture I had of him it was in one of the bunkers, I had taken it the night before we went on our last mission together, that was the day he had fallen off the train and I had gone into the ice I miss him
I tensed up, licking my lips as I grabbed the table standing up fast biting down hard while I felt everyone's eyes on me, I told them I should probably check it out if its new tech for me then I should test it before we need to go out on our next mission, I got to the doorway as I heard Natasha coming running behind me.
Later that day me and Bucky went home to Brooklyn again for a few weeks off, he was going on a mission and wanted to talk to his family one last time before going away
I need to go for a walk I thought to myself, I got up out of bed and started getting dressed when I felt someone staring at me, it was tony he never left the room and now he was staring at my almost naked body while I was only in my captain America boxers, they all got me for Christmas last year, it felt good having him staring at me like that, I've always felt secure about myself even before the serum, but now with this beautiful man staring at me I couldn't think of anything but how much more pretty he was, his jaw was sharp with his beard making him look so good, wonder how it would have felt against my chin, and his toned body, with little to no chest hair, and the bulge in his pants looked like it was growing and mine was growing bigger in my pants, I guess he noticed because when I was just inches from him he pressed his body closer, our lips were almost touching and I could feel his bulge against my leg and he probably felt mine against his lower stomach.
his strong hand let my shoulder go and I felt his arm move away from my neck and back to his side as we got closer to the other in my troop
I said that and kissed him, hard and passioned, he pulled my legs up on his shoulders, he put his finger in my mouth and told me to suck, I did, wetting them down then he pulled them out, he put one finger against my ass, and showed a finger in my hole, I moaned loud making him put another one in, he was pressing my g-spot with his fingers pulling them in and out faster and faster until he put another one in, now he had three fingers in me and I was moaning like never before it felt amazing
T: "that not the deal, I was just wondering who he was, you sounded so heartbroken, and you guys are l- "
Tony was the only one who knew I was gay, and tony often joked about it saying he'll tell the rest of the avengers I have a thing for Thor, he is very handsome yes but I don't like him like that, he's one of my best friends and it would just be awkward to be with someone from the avengers were like family, they were always flirting with each other all the other always made fun of them saying they were arguing like a married couple but they did not know I was actually gay and tony yea he was a little Bi for me like almost everyone, what can I say im a gorgeous man as Tony always said after a few drinks at the tower. Tony had never been with a man, but always said that if he had to choose he'll pick me over everyone else, even if HE IS NOT GAY
He said that slowly with a hint of insecurity, he was adorable with that little shy smile focused on my chin, I took my hand up to his face and stroked his cheek and placed a little kiss on his forehead and embraced him into a hug and softly spoke in to his ears letting chills run down his spine.
I sat down at the table at my usual place across from the brown-haired man that was drinking out of Bruce glass with orange juice, my eyes were lingering on him a little too long when his eyes stared back at me with a smirk he stood up and walked to the doorway
He nuzzled his face into my neck and let go before the doors open not letting the other avengers know what had just happened, they were all sitting at the table having breakfast, Natasha stood up fast and ran over to me and hugged me tightly probably feeling Tony's cologne on me
I never told any of the others avenger im gay, i never felt like talking about Bucky at all after the accident, i never thought I'd find love again, Bucky was my everything and would have loved to be able to show me off as his boyfriend, because after the war the law was changed and homosexuality was not illegal anymore, it was not seen as a sickness, and now in the 20th century it is celebrated, they have parades and even a whole month just for... "us", Bucky would have been so happy, we used to go to secret clubs for gay people just so we could hold each other, I was so small in his big strong arms, he'd always been so mad about the law he would have loved the 20th century. But I did find love again, that stupid and arrogant but beautiful man named Tony Stark
He hung up leaving me and tony in silence again, he took my hand in his again and hugged it tight making sure he was there for me, I gave him a hug and kissed his forehead, we stayed like that a few minutes before he softly spoke into the crook of my neck sending shivers down my spine
T: "yea, yea sorry, it's not like I pay for all this or anything you could just make a new one Clint"
F: "we had it all under control, so we thought we didn't need to bring the avenger into this fight, but now we do need you guys, you should go and talk to the rest because I want you all at the SHEILD headquarter in two hours"
He kissed me again standing us both up, and laid me on the bed and kissed me from my mouth, to my neck, to my chest, down my stomach, he kissed the tip of my penis, stroking my length, it was so small in his big hands, he took it in his mouth licking and sucking me, making me moan and trust into his mouth, he looked me in my eyes and kept sucking I was so close, I told him that and stopped
He said that with a laugh and punched my shoulder lightly and walked to the table and took a bite out of Clint's toast he had left there when he went to the other room at the same time as he took the first bite Clint came back to the room.
Peggy: "so you guys think you can become army men, do any of you know what that involves, what you guys have to go thru, what you are going to see and what kind of people you will meet"
I woke up all sweaty, probably screaming because everyone was standing at my doorway, they all looked concerned and could I blame them this was the third time this month I had woken up like this, I told them I'm fine, I just had another nightmare, they told me I should talk to a psychologist but I can't, I won't tell anyone about Bucky and myself even if homosexuality is legal now, it wasn't legal back then.
I scoffed him out of the way, oh god he is so short and smells so good I thought to myself as I got into the kitchen drinking a glass of water thinking of what just had happened
