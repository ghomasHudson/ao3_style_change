"There you go... match my breaths..." murmur Tony.  This was what Pepper had done when he'd gotten back from Afghanistan.  He'd slept weird hours, and fallen asleep in weird places.  His bed had been too soft and he'd tended to curl up into small areas, closets or under the cars in the garage.  He'd wake with a scream lingering in his throat, Pepper's sea-green eyes peering at him, and this is how she'd extracted him and brought him back.  "Listen to my breathing, Steve... breathe with me... one... and two... in... and out..."
"...good omega..." whispered Tony, pressing gently, stroking the skin on Steve's neck.
"I'll see you guys tomorrow, probably," Steve said, offering Pepper, Aria and Happy a wave before heading upstairs, leaving everyone else in the seating area. Aria sighed as she dropped her laptop and files into a bag.
"Normally, pockets are
A slow clapping came from behind them. Steve's eyes narrowed before he turned around to see Hammer. The guy was looking smug (why the hell would he be?) and was dressed in a hideous orange suit combined with a silver tie. He was being trailed by a pair of stagehands, Pepper, Happy, a lone reporter with VIP access who looked like she had died and gone to heaven, and another man in a suit Tony was certain he'd seen before but couldn't quite place.
He tore the left arm off the shirt; his left arm never seemed to quite fit into regular sleeves correctly.
Tony curled back up in the bed, pulling the covers over his shoulders and successfully knocking his half-eaten plate of waffles to the floor.  Steve had long-since learned that Tony had no sense of cleanliness whatsoever; he was too used to people cleaning up after him.
"Oh, great, then we're all pals!" exclaimed Tony with delight.  "That was easy, great, I love it when things are easy.  Here's your drink back."  Tony handed her an empty glass.  "If you'll excuse me, I think I see Chloe over there... hey, Stan, I'm starving, grab me a drink?"
He snuggled up against Steve, enjoying the smoothness of the plane ride.  He knew Steve wasn't an enormous fan of planes, but Tony was. He loved flying.  And his plane was rather nice... he'd designed it himself.
"I saw the girl. And a man. The man called me your property," Steve said with a bad taste in his mouth. "It was...just a test run. They just wanted to see if they could do it."
Tony checked his phone again.  He had advised JARVIS to screen all incoming calls.  There had been four so far, two from Aria and one from Pepper and one, sure enough, from Gideon, which Tony had ignored.
"Oh, please, half the omegas here worship him.  He's Mr. Big Shot," said Fred, affectionately teasing.
"Hi, JARVIS," said JARVIS.
"That's Steve's decision.  Not yours," said one of the doctors pleasantly.  A beta, Tony noted.  One who had no idea what it was like to be an Alpha, the drive to protect omegas, the desperation to shield Steve.
"They're not talking about Stark," said Wanda.
"Just because everyone knows you're corrupting me doesn't mean people want to think about it," Steve pointed out quietly. "It's like the queen of England - everyone knows she must take a dump now and then but by god no one ever talks about it. It's my job to embody virtue - or at least it was before. But then...thinking back I kind of hated that stereotype if I'm honest."
"...it feels too big," said Bucky, tapping his heart.
"I've kind of already got a project lined up," he said. "But I'll keep it in mind, thank you. I’m really not hot on twenty-first century omega issues, I'm afraid... I just don't know enough about them."
, for once.  Don't you think you deserve at least as much as Tony?  Isn't that what status equality is all about?" She had slid onto his lap and was playing with his loosened tie.  "Be honest with me, Steve... have you ever gotten to be a woman? Has any Alpha ever actually let you use your cock?"  She was whispering now, her face inches from Steve's, her hands touching his chest lightly. "Because
Steve glared, waiting.
A pause.  The silence in the room felt comfortable rather than awkward.  Tony felt calmer than before.  Steve's chest rose and fell under him; Tony matched his breaths.  Their heartbeats had synced up, too.
"Well, now I feel guilty."
"Thank you," Steve said softly. Hearing Tony say that he was respected, out loud, meant a lot.  It really did. "Maybe if you see me in action I can show you that I know what I'm doing," he promised him with a subtle smile tugging at the edge of his lips. Steve was by no means an arrogant person, but being on omega meant one couldn't afford modesty in the forties. If you didn't big yourself up, no one else would. "You don't have to join. But maybe tag a long for the ride sometime, the suit will keep you safe...and I really want to show you what I do, Tony."
"Married to a beta.  He could have been pair-bonded to Jarvis.  You know how close they were."
Tony looked cute.  Almost.  His bedhead was really quite sweet.  Steve was slowly--
The palladium-core arc reactor had not been perfect by any stretch of the imagination, but the freedom from that car battery had made all the difference.
So you wanted a scenting.  Gotcha. Well, I have two other people who are interested in making his acquaintance as well.  Obviously he's not exactly a virgin, but still, Malick paid seven hundred grand for him, so I'm looking for about half of that, and I should tell you right now that Alderdice offered me four hundred.  Plus, you have to understand, since he and Malick broke up, he's been... a bit promiscuous. Running around with a lot of Alphas. On the rebound, you might say."
. And would this fuck up Steve's actual cycle? They needed to call Gleason.
"Don't fight. Not here." And there he was. An omega bossing two Alphas around. The essence of the Avengers Initiative right there. Jeez. Tony would never follow his orders...would he?
"This is the problem with capitalism," said Wanda darkly.
he thought bitterly.
Tony growled softly, but it was a friendly noise.  He and Rhodes went back far enough that Tony didn't feel especially threatened by him; Rhodey was like an older brother.  It helped that Rhodes had maintained a respectful distance from Steve the entire time he'd been there.  It was a conscious effort.
Then Tony thrust up into him and Steve whined happily. It felt like he could finally breathe. "Tony.
“I don’t need—”
“True. Okay, then.”
Steve unclasps the sling, and something warm blossoms inside Tony, just below the arc reactor. It uncurls into him, wafts of blue light that share Steve’s scent. It spreads, up towards his shoulder blades, and down, prickling at the base of his spine. He looks into Steve’s eyes and he finds it there, too, the same thing he’s feeling.
“You… Mine… mine too,” Steve slurs, and then he blacks out again.
“I’m so sorry, Tony,” he says, again, because he doesn’t know what else to do.
“The respect?”
Tony shakes his head. “Don’t stop,” he says, clenching his jaw, and Steve’s hands are on him again.
Tony opens his eyes. He reaches up with one hand and cups Steve’s big face. Steve closes his eyes and leans into the touch, turns his head to press a kiss on Tony’s palm, so very soft.
, hurt you again. I’ll never do that again, I swear.”
Seems like I’m a gladiator now, or a close equivalent. But my life is worthless here. I’m not a valued entertainer of crowds, I’m not a tool to manufacture consent, I’m not an idol for the people. I train, I do my job, I kill. Bears, wolves, the occasional tiger. Innocent animals. Innocent people. Boys no older than seventeen. Them or me, I tell myself.
“I read kindness in your eyes and it makes me sick. I want a ruthless warrior who knows no mercy. I want someone with whom I can rule this disgusting kingdom. Who knows the power of fear and obedience. And instead I got you.”
He takes a deep breath.
A big hand appears, seemingly out of nowhere. It grabs the offending little thing and gently places it on the counter.
“Hey,” he says. “You should get a notebook,” he adds, and Tony notices that a couple of his papers fell to the ground. He crouches down to pick them up.
Tony is quiet for a minute. “Do you think she was still in love with you?” he asks, with a courage he didn’t know he had.
“No, oh Tony, I didn’t mean it like—”
“Tony, I—” Steve tries, but oh,
Steve inhales and exhales. He does it again a few times, until he feels like he’s in control of himself. He lies back down on the blanket, next to Tony. He feels heavy and defeated, tired all of a sudden, and also kind of stupid.
It’s weird.
“You need to rest. And you need to be with her. I know you do. And I need to be… somewhere else. Uhm. In the gym, I mean.”
“Don’t ask me to calm down!”
“You really had to ruin my fortieth birthday, huh?”
, and then, a second later, it’s happened already.
“‘Cause I figured… if I get to keep you I won’t need to hold onto it anymore.”
Then, breath ragged and voice hoarse, Tony says, “You remembered. I can’t believe you—”
Steve inhales sharply when Tony says this. Maybe he can’t stand the fact that Tony thinks about his imminent death as something highly possible, something he needs to start planning ahead for, because it could very well happen. Maybe Steve wants to think about it as something improbable, or far away in the future anyway. Maybe Steve doesn’t want to think about it at all.
And in that second before answering, Steve thought,
“Yeah. They’re the same ones I made right after Afghanistan. I brought them here to wear in public, but then you were here too, and… I didn’t want to tell you at first, I wasn’t even talking to you, and then I just… went on hiding it. It’s been kind of a nightmare though, ‘cause the shirts are kinda thick for this muggy weather. And with another t-shirt over...”
“I— uh. I am. If that’s okay with you.”
“Think about it, Steve. Just for a minute, try to really think about it.”
“I felt it.”
“Tony, no, you don’t have to…”
“Shh.” Steve. His hands on Tony’s hips, turning him over. Tony’s face against the padded floor, his come-covered stomach sticking to the plastic, his back to Steve. Steve’s hand is on his ass, squeezing; Tony moans again, he doesn’t know if out of desire or sorrow. “Shh,” Steve says again, to reassure instead of subdue, and pushes back into Tony, harsh and filthy and wonderful. Tony shouts and scratches the floor with his nails, his back snapping into a curve of satisfaction and hunger. It’s all too much.
Inside, there’s a couch with a coffee table and television set in a corner, a small kitchen with a table on the other. There are books on the shelves built into a recess in the wall, next to Tony’s great-grandmother’s credenza. An arch leads to a tiny hallway, with two doors: the laundry and the bedroom. The bed is huge, and the door that leads to the ensuite bathroom is engraved with flowers. There’s a French window too, to access the backyard. Tony can see the oak tree outside casting an inviting shade on the grass.
He closes his eyes and lets himself lose this battle against his own mind. The images come back to him in a smooth flow, it’s almost scary how precisely he can recall them, like dreaming them all over again. Like living them.
“Would you have said it back,” he asks, and he didn’t mean to, it doesn’t even sound like a question because he didn’t mean to ask, he doesn’t really want to know, he…
“Oh.”
“He said he needs time to think about it. Which is fair. He also said that he’s gonna be busy with Bucky for the next few weeks, so... It looks like your bestie is hell-bent on ruining my life.”
. He lets it all out, and Steve doesn’t flinch, doesn’t look scared, doesn’t look disgusted, he doesn’t even look sad.
know how to use a phone! I was starting to have doubts.”
“I love you, too,” Tony interrupts him, smiling, because Steve always knows what to say to him, how to deal with him and his anxiety. Tony cuddles up closer to Steve’s body, closes his eyes.
“Yeah.”
He calls Rhodey.
“I know, I just...” Tony shakes his head. Of course Steve wouldn’t.
Tony had been scared, actually. But not by Steve trying to kiss him.
Steve's problem is not with Tony’s age.
“Riri, what are you—” The loud ringing is still in Steve’s ears, and now it suffocates his words, smothers them into hesitation.
“Come on, sleepyhead, lunch’s ready.”
, she’s dead now. She died quite young, poor her.”
“Jesus.”
Well. That’s fair.
The next time it happens is almost two months later (yes, Steve
“I got one I did this morning,” Steve says, his voice unsteady. “But I don’t know if you’re gonna like it.”
Tony’s hands making food for Steve in the dead of night.
Tony stares at the picture until he can’t see it anymore.
“Okay.”
Tony smiles too. “Damn, and here I thought…” he jokes.
Tony is quiet for a moment. When he speaks, his voice is low and shaky. “And you think I have?”
Steve feels his face fall. “Of course it’s for you, Tony. I mean, I’d be lying if I said it’s not fun for me as well, but if you don’t want to do this then just tell me and I can deal with it.”
“I don’t know what the hell I was thinking, I, I’m sorry, I, I’m, I’m gonna, I’ll—”
Tony gasps and wakes up. The day is incredibly bright, and he doesn’t know if his eyes sting because he was sleeping, or because the cave was so dark.
“I quit drinking.”
Rhodey puts a hand over his heart. “Okay, what if I never call you
He would. God, he would have another child with Steve. If he only could, he’d give Steve… he’d—
Steve groans and whimpers, out of breath, sweat making his skin stick to Tony’s. A squelching noise fills the room every time Steve thrusts into Tony’s body, and Tony wonders where all that slick is coming from.
“Nope. No breakfast,” Steve says, staring at him while he straddles his hips on the bed.
“How’re you doing?”
“Yeah. Makes me miss insomnia.”
Tony searches Steve’s body next to him on the couch. He folds to the side, against Steve, head bowed down. He hits Steve’s chest with his temple, his cheek, and Steve’s arms are around him, Steve’s nose in his neck, breathing him in to come down from the rush.
Tomorrow, he tells himself.
It’s possibly the oldest place Steve has ever set foot in. At least, while there wasn’t a war raging on and he could pay attention to it. For sure, since coming out of the ice.
“Yeah—”
Then something, something deep inside Steve, something that could actually be Tony, orders him to move, and he does, and it’s fast and frantic and almost brutal and he needs to be careful not to hurt Tony but Tony is moaning, keeps murmuring
“You,” he says, “you okay with me… us…”
“It’s okay, you don’t have to talk. You don’t have to tell me anything you don’t want to.”
“I don’t know. It’s the rut, I suppose. Makes me feel… dangerous. Distant.”
“Right. Bye.”
Sometimes he really says things that makes you think he left the ‘40s just yesterday. And maybe sometimes he feels like he has.
Steve isn’t far enough from Tony and the man for his enhanced hearing not to pick up their conversation, and he really wishes he had some way to stop himself, but super self-control wasn’t included in the serum.
They resume their walk, and Tony stops in front of his favorite tie shop in the world, the
He doesn’t say anything for a few minutes, and Tony gets distracted looking around, at the hill in front of them, at a couple of children playing a few feet away from where they’re sitting, at their grandfather promising ice cream for
He sits down on his chair, and places a hand over the reactor.
Tony walks to the chair he used as a valet stand and slowly takes off the rest of his clothes, arranging them with care. When he is finally naked he turns to look at Steve, who’s looking at him with a raised eyebrow.
Tony grimaces and nods.
“Don’t...” Steve touches Tony’s elbow. “Don’t call me
Tony explains some things about the city that aren’t on the internet, things you only know when you have a special attachment to the place. Steve listens avidly, asks questions, makes a few jokes.
He can see humanity happening while this church exists, here.
Tony stares at the ceiling, clenches his jaw and presses his lips together, lets the air come out of his nose.
“We could do it together,” he says.
It hurts so much to speak, and as soon as I try to open my mouth to let the words out I taste blood on my tongue.
Steve learns fast. Steve has probably googled this while Tony was sleeping.
“You can’t be serious.”
Tony stares at the fair skin of Steve’s hands. It looks pearly white under the harsh neon light of the kitchen, the blond hair covering his wrists gleaming with it.
“You can’t be serious.”
I didn’t even plan it. Saw a door left open, tried to make a run for it. Forgot I’m not as fast as I used to be. I slipped over the icy ground.
It’s so warm. He’s so warm.
“Guess you could get on all fours. Or you could get on top of me. You’d have more control that way, if you’re the one moving.”
are the resident dinosaur of the Avengers—”
He can’t move and there are tears in his eyes, threatening to fall down his cheeks, and he’s struggling to keep from crying because it wouldn’t be out of release or effort now, it would be just out of pain.
what if things had gone in a different way?
“I thought I’d never get anything more. Not from Iron Man. And it was confusing as hell, because meanwhile I was developing a pretty embarrassing crush on Tony Stark.” Steve forces a smile and then swallows back something that can only be nostalgia. “Anyway. I was in love with Iron Man. And I thought that piece of mesh would be all I’d ever have of him. So I kept it.”
“Very well. I suggest extra caution in your proceedings, sir.”
“It’s beautiful, Steve. It’s...”
Steve slumps over above Tony, falls on him gracelessly, forcing Tony’s hips back on the floor. He covers Tony’s body with his own, resting an elbow on the side of Tony’s head. Tony feels him do something with his other hand, touch the place between them where they become one thing, slip a couple of fingers into Tony and rub against his dick, stretching Tony out, reaching past the knot and then deep inside him.
“Yeah, yeah, wait—”
“Is it, like, in the air, or...”
“Tony—”
“I don’t. But I’m sure you have your reasons.”
Tony brushes his cheek to Steve’s. “Okay. Back to business, soldier,” he says, and there’s a grin on Steve’s face when he adjusts on his hands and knees. Tony’s heart skips a beat at the sight of him, offering himself like a gift.
, because it was made of lead, or copper, something like that, highly marketable at the time. Soon the crisis became complete decline, and the church was abandoned, even used as a foundry for a short time, then left in ruins until the 19th century, when the sensibility towards preservation changed. And that’s the story.”
“Always, sir.”
“So you want to go meet this woman?”
Rhodey is the first one to know, obviously. Then Pepper.
And Tony could lie. Could minimize. He could pretend it’s just work stuff, that he’s worried about something going on with Riri or Kamala or Miles or any of the other kids, but he knows that he can’t. He shouldn’t. He should tell Steve the truth, always. He can trust Steve. They’re building something. Something real. They’re making all their dreams come true. He can’t lie to Steve.
And that’s enough to know, actually.
“Let’s try and get some sleep, okay?” Steve says, and Tony looks into his eyes again, caresses his face, and nods.
He looks at his wrists. A thought. A single thought is enough.
“Perfect… perfect for me,” Tony hears him whisper; he’s saying other things but Tony can’t make them out. Steve rests his hips on the mattress and Tony feels reckless enough to ride up his dick a couple of times—at first Steve’s knot is still small enough that it catches at Tony’s rim just right, but then the edge of pain becomes sharper, and then it just
Tony takes off his undershirt before going back downstairs. Stella isn’t surprised by the reactor, but she seems rather curious about it, despite trying to be subtle.
“Alright. Alright. Of course.”
He buries his face between Steve’s cheeks, mouths at his hole, nibbles at it lightly, before he gets onto making Steve’s entrance loose, tongue making its way past the initial resistance with decision and purpose.
. Most people didn't realise the serum boosted everything- including Steve's hearing.
But Steve was just winding him up now, his tone playful and eyes as mischievous as ever. Tony's touch felt nice, he hadn't felt this relaxed in so long. Especially considering he'd just come out to the world...but he didn't really care. Steve just kinda wanted to kneel for him again and what the hell did that even mean?
"Zero that we know about."
Steve wasn't sure he liked it, but Stone himself seemed incredibly friendly.
"Of course," Peggy said, her voice a tad softer as her fingertips brushed over his cheek. "Oh you haven't aged a day, have you?" Her eyes glinted with a smile. "You bastard… yes. Come tomorrow. You can take me on my afternoon walk. Gertrude will be very jealous.  She’s the old crone who lives across the way."
"I've got this," Bethany assured them and got out of the car. The man was shouting at them through the windscreen, saying something equally as crude as his sign. Steve felt a little sick and Aria looked horrified. Sometimes he forget she had two omega moms, that this really hit home for her. That every sign she read wasn't just about Steve-- it was about them too. After a bit of a struggle Bethany managed to drag him down, ripping his sign from his hands and pushing him back towards the crowd. A policeman came and took his arm, leading him back out of the gates.
Alpha was good but she would
"Just because you're kind of a mess now doesn't mean you should say no forever, right?"
like you," said Boswell to Steve.
"You want a drink too?" Maddie asked Steve, significantly more forward than Dani is.
A bit of a slow chapter, but with some important world-building (in my humblest opinion). Stay tuned for dinner at the White House, Tony's psych eval, and the ever-thickening mysteries of the Winter Soldier and the Tesseract!  Plus, Steve's ongoing crusade as a civil rights leader, and Tony's ongoing crusade against his own liver! - T
"Right, Pepper."
"Now, I don't care, Cap, I don't give
"Tony has a habit of freaking out over things.  I wouldn't worry about it.  Your other mate is not part of this equation," said Pepper firmly.
Downstairs, Rhodey was trying to get Tony up.  "You wanna come up and see him?" asked Rhodey, giving Tony's shoulders a shake.  Tony was nearly limp.  He shook his head the tiniest amount.  "Well, at least come face him, man to man, and tell him to get out, then."  Tony shook his head again.
"Yeah but... but those were different," said Steve.  (He didn't want to admit he'd stuck all of his lines, neatly written onto note cards, on the back of his prop shield with bubblegum.)
"Guys." Aria announced. "I don't like this. I think we should wait."
he would have picked up.  Because he loves you. He gave you everything and you just-- you didn't even see it. This wasn't Steve trying to see
know you had that spot back here?" asked Tony.  It came out a little more accusatory than he meant it to.  It wasn't like Alphas didn't have scent glands, too, just that theirs weren't hard-wired to any special mating gland.  Theirs were for the sole purpose of enticing omegas and establishing standing with each other. And speaking of establishing standing, how dare Maggie Frond compare Tony to his father.  That shit wasn't fair. He wasn't as dominant, yeah, but who the hell was? Howard Stark had the soul of a dragon.
"I'm not singing live on television," Steve said in the living room, arms crossed, while everyone chatted about their ideas for the impromptu fundraiser.  The thought quite clearly scared him. He did
Yinsen had died at the end of April.  April 26th, if Tony recalled correctly.  He had named the last week of April his Afghanistanniversary and for some reason it didn't bother him nearly as much as it should have.  Perhaps because that was one of the few times in his life he felt he'd truly taken responsibility for something, faced it head on. Dealt with it like a man and an Alpha.
"See you around, Steve!" Kate chimed with a wave and a smile, her eyes practically glittering. There was still something about her- something deadly under the surface. She reminded him of Natasha a little- an Alpha who was seemingly not dominating in any way. She was subtle, yet strong and Steve had no doubt that he never wanted to mess with her.
Steve was on the ground.  Steve wasn't moving.  Steve was dead.
"Well he can feel how I feel about it.  We're bonded.  Whenever he binge drinks my feelings are pretty strong," Steve said quietly and shrugged. "He knows I don't like it. But he won't stop, so what do you want me to do about it?"
"...is it delicious and Greek?" asked Bucky, brow furrowing at the label.
"I don't care how many people you've slept with, Tony," Steve said quietly. He really didn't and it surprised him how little it did. He didn't see how it was relevant, or even his business. Steve knew Tony Stark was called a playboy for a reason. It didn't exactly surprise him either.
Aria shooed them toward the stairs while Pepper herded Steve's crew toward the front door.
"Yeah, Steve's here... everyone's here, it looks like," said Tony, who was positive he'd just espied Beyoncé across the room.
"...you don't think...?"
DeSoto looked a bit nervous to repeat this criticism of his Alpha.
"No, no, the-- I'm sorry, Dr. Thompson, but it sounds like your child isn't eligible for our program."
Nate looked thoroughly offended.  "I'm an
"Fuck," said Tony out loud.  They were one hour in and they'd almost already missed the first one.  Tony swiped for the box of pills and practically crammed one into Steve's mouth.  "Swallow," he commanded, hips still squirming.
"I can get everything delivered for a Christmas dinner tomorrow," Aria offered gently, trying to placate the room. "Make it, you know, Christmassy..."
He patched up the small cut on Steve's stomach properly so even during the heat the bandage wouldn't come off and left some slave for the bruise on his head invade it didn't go down. Steve as grateful and so didn't point out that the serum would be rid of it by tomorrow morning.
. Aria's words rang in his head like an alarm. Steve never really thought he was someone who liked attention but he definitely disliked being ignored more.
Steve blinked, absolutely stunned. "You have an entire family. You have... that's a
Then Happy moved around to open the door and the noise hit them like a wave. Steve's face must have been portraying a lot because Aria pulled a pair of RayBan glasses out and shoved them onto his face, muttering something about 'emergency sunglasses.'
the red one," said Bucky, pushing away the cherry-flavored yogurt.
let Barton know.  I personally-- I had no idea.  I personally tried to help him track down Charles Barton.  We had no idea we were being sabotaged. But..." There was a pause.  "It's not Barton I'm worried about. It's Romanoff. Steve. If either of them hears about this, you realize we won't be able to stop them from murdering Gideon Malick?  And that while you and Stark may be famous enough to get away with a hell of a lot... they aren't. You and I have to keep this a secret, because-- because if we don't--"  Phil sounded like he was literally choking on the words.
"Fine, show up early so I can kick your ass, you piece of crap."
"It proves that I associate the thought of an
Tony forced a smile.
"I mean... as happy as I can be.  It's not going anywhere."
"Yes," said Phil immediately.  Tony winced. Phil's nesting compulsive had already made an enormous mess of his kitchen.  Then again, he figured Steve could use an omega buddy. Omegas nested together if they were close, right?  Tony didn't especially want to be around Steve right now. He wanted to hole up somewhere, maybe his office on the second floor, and drink himself stupid and jack off some of his frustration, even though his knot was already rubbed raw.
"Usually he gets over it within a day or two," said Happy somberly.  "But you know Tony.  The Afghanistanniversary kinda makes the whole month shitty."
Tony could hear Steve getting into the luggage.
He blinked.
Steve froze. One minute he was smiling at Agent Carter and the next he was horrified. Because this was his fault. He had ruined Donner for Malick, whatever that meant... but he had, somehow.
"Wanna do Alphas versus omegas?" asked Tony.
"So.  We need to get my dad's notes from HQ," said Tony, trying to distract himself from the needle.
"He's like a child," he whispered. "It's like Gideon took... everything that made him
Steve sent Tony a side long glance. It was going to be quite a night.
The doctor gently pried Banksy off him, guided him to a seat in the room, and sat him down.  "Mr. Banksy... we're doing everything we can. Mr. Mackabee is a fighter and considering how quickly you responded, he has the best shot of recovery.  However... I'm sorry to say that... at this time, his prognosis is not promising."
Dr. Gleason looked up briefly.  "...well.  That statistic is very likely padded by the amount of domestic violence male omegas face.  But yes.  About two out of three.  For female omegas, it's fifty percent, and for betas, about twenty percent."
"If you could just grab that pole around there..."
He beamed at 4UMM-E, who, voice-activated, scooted across the floor, bumped into the desk, and then whirled up to Tony like a dog.  Tony actually found himself putting an arm around the bot, which was ridiculous. 4UMM-E was nothing more than a voice-activated mechanical arm on a pair of treads.  And even if he were smart, like JARVIS, Tony had to sometimes remember that they were only devices. They felt no affection for him.
"You're confused Mike with Ronnie.  Ronnie bonded to Indy.  Mike's with Ashtray," interjected Hal.
"He's not.  He's just some omega dressed up like him," said Melinda sourly, stepping back and letting Steve storm past her.
"No, he's not-- damn it, Happy, these stupid tabloids are just guessing!"  Tony threw down the magazine and stomped off to his shop. So far, Happy's tabloid had successfully guessed Steve, Taylor Swift, Carson Daly, Rihanna, Union Jack, and Mockingbird... but he felt like he needed to prove to Happy that they were only guessing.
Tony kissed the side of Steve's neck, ignoring her.
"I mean, he has flashbacks sometimes," said Tony with a small shrug.  "Normally he's more responsive but it's probably just the heat... he's just gotta work through it... he'll be fine... back
"No."
Tony realized Steve was lying on top of him, his body warm.  Typically, waking up with a much larger man on top of him would be cause for concern.  But Steve's smell gave Tony nothing but comfort.  Amazing how quickly pheromones had hijacked Tony's brain.  He'd always thought the "honeymoon phase" was just a metaphor or something, not an actual physiological reaction to bonding.  It felt wonderful.
not going anywhere," the doctor hummed as she moved onto the burn on the other leg and lower down. They already felt better from the salve. The gel felt soothing his heated skin, some of it starting to blister. "These might scar," Kate warned him.
, Steve.  Ceramic-carbon brakes.  Sixty to zero in thirty meters... you pull about two G's if you brake this bad boy all the way.  You can get it up to 150 in ten seconds!"
Steve turned a pretty pink at Tony's rude comment. Obviously...that's what they were going to be doing. But Rhodes didn't need the gaps filling in for him. It also didn't help that was literally just in a boxers and shirt. He was hardly properly dressed himself.
Steve brushed his fingers against Tony's subtlety in a silent form of comfort. Natasha walked past them and propped open the room between the lab and the sim room to start setting up the main chair. "So it's just you going in?" she asked, raising a brow at him in question before her gaze flitted between the two of them. She didn't offer her opinion on the matter itself. She clearly didn't see it as her place to.
"Romanov, I'm sor--"
Steve smiled, feeling so very stupid for feeling left out the night before. He needed to get his emotions into check sometimes. "I'd like that."
"Holy-moly, it's
"Lead the way, Cap," he said with fake bravado.
"--what Steve said, about a witch, really, it does seem likely that was a hallucination or misunderstanding, though, yes?" prompted Sitwell.
Steve flinched a little when Tony first touched his neck. He hadn't expected it but he slowly managed to calm himself. He swallowed thickly, his head ducking down as he focused on keeping his breath even. Steve closed his eyes and swallowed again.
"I'm fine, I'm fine," said Tony, brushing Steve off.  "It's just... gross. The collar thing. ...I feel like there's something wrong with me.  That thing looked like a medieval torture device." He sighed a little. He should have known there would be collars in an exhibit about locks.
"Nap," he declared firmly, gently flopping onto the bed with Steve and closing his eyes.  He was asleep before his head hit the pillow.
"Let's get you something to eat, okay?" said Natasha gently.
"Yes.  Though it's rare for them to stay there long.  At Pine Hills a lot of them ended up
He reached down to grasp Steve's length, stroking it in rhythm with his thrusts.  "Can you cum for me, Steve?  I want you to cum first... please... this is for you... you're my omega... I want this to be for you..." he panted, rutting happily into the other.
"They had all already seen me naked.  We've established this.  Seriously, I've got nothing to apologize for, I'm a respectable--"
," he repeated firmly, staring Gideon in the eye.  "We want the-- the opinion-- we want the opinion of-- of the whole council.  Not him. He's-- he's too close. Because-- Steve's my cousin and-- and-- and we're ex-mates."
"He stole from us, too," offered the omega.
Aria was in pajamas when he came down and was nursing a glass of red wine. It was small and it had stained her lips a faint purple.
grateful that HYDRA made me have a miscarriage Tony," Steve said quietly, gaze fixed on the ceiling above and legs pressed together. They took the choice away but they also had no right to. Steve was angry that they took that from him, and that
my skin and only partial scarring which means it isn't
Steve shuddered as Tony's fingertips dragged over him. He felt serene- like he was floating. Like this wasn't quite real. Like Tony wasn't here with him- as if this was just a fantasy. He could have easily been. He often dreamed of having an Alpha who would treat him as an equal. Steve never thought that was truly possible.
Tony turned.  "He was kneeling.  Gideon made him kneel.  Steve would
"Sorry. Let me get this straight." Steve pulled his hands back. "You want to date Pepper? And secondly-" he resisted the urge to point at the triad couple in the corner. "That kind of relationship is archaic as hell and I guarantee you, nine times out of ten an omega would want someone to commit to them. As an
"You guys were arranged?"
"Didn't you do a whole bunch of USO tours back in the day?" asked Tony.
"Jesus Tony. I was just getting coffee," Steve breathed and wrapped an arm around him, his fingers running up and down Tony's arm in a comforting motion. He let him lean into him and pressed a kiss to his forehead. "Sorry. I won't do it again." He knew Tony was clingy but he thought that he could have managed a journey downstairs before getting into a panic. Clearly heats were very different experiences depending on what side you experienced them from.
," said JARVIS helpfully.
About five minutes into the drive their hands found each other's. Steve didn't know who reached out first but it didn't really matter either. What was important was how warm Tony's hand felt in his. How well their fingers slotted together. How Tony's thumb felt drawing circles on the back of his hand.
It’s Nat. He sets the phone on the bed and activates the holoscreen.
“No, no, it was… it reminded me it hadn’t been a dream. That we’d really… that you…”
And now he is worried about Tony. Because, well, apparently:
Steve kisses Tony’s temple. He passes regard and support to him through the bond, and Tony is grateful in response.
It’s a whirlwind. They’re undone by it, piece by piece, until there’s only a darkness they can sink into together, and it seems welcoming and inviting—anything to stop feeling like this, to stop feeling heartbroken and guilty all at once, to make Steve stop feeling like that too.
“You only read the English version, right?”
His mind drifts inevitably to Tony, to his body softened by the years, to the grace he effortlessly puts in every single movement, to how magnificent he looks in the Iron Man armor, to how amazing he is when he’s inventing something, to his shiny hair. Only Tony can make him feel like this. Only Tony can reduce him to this. The serum made Steve’s libido and stamina something unheard of, but Tony— the things Tony can do to him are just beyond reason.
Steve wants to die. He was supposed to do all that. He was supposed to be the one who killed them all, that got Tony home. Instead, he’s useless. A useless Alpha that’s no good at anything. His Omega doesn’t want him. His Omega doesn’t need him.
“Hello,” he says, in a slightly embarrassed tone. His cheeks are very pink.
“Pain?”
Steve’s voice… he’s crying too. Tony made him cry.
“—and then it was like it was hot, but in my head, you know? Like fireworks? It was weird.”
“Then I don’t—”
“If you don’t close your mouth you’ll end up eating a mosquito,” Bucky says, and Tony snorts. “Listen to me,” Bucky continues, “don’t make a big fuss out of this, okay? I know how you can get. I’m fine. Tons of people are looking after me. I’m gonna be okay.”
One step forward and ten backwards. And it’s all Steve’s fault.
“A moral imperative.”
Worry must slip from him and into the bond, because Tony asks, “Are you alright? You don’t look so good.”
“I say it all the time—”
Steve arrives early on purpose. MJ sends him down to Tony’s lab, so he doesn’t get in the way of the catering people still setting up the buffet.
Those things will disappear.
Steve takes him home and Tony thanks him with a rough, scratchy voice, and he asks to be left alone. Steve says, “Okay, Tony. As you wish. I understand,” and he leaves, and Tony thinks that Steve doesn’t understand, not really, and he will have to explain it to him, eventually. But Tony, just then, loved Steve a bit more for saying what he said the way he said it.
“I’m scared, though.”
She offers them coffee and a slice of pie, still hot from the oven.
“Okay,” he says softly, and takes off his jeans. He waits for Tony to settle under the covers with Maria, then crawls into bed too.
Steve lets his hand slide over Tony’s hip, and he presses his middle finger down the cleft of his ass. Tony feels Steve rubbing against his hole, which has leaked some of Steve’s come while Tony was asleep. Steve’s first knuckle slips in almost on his own.
Tony sighs. “Steve,” he says, stern.
He adjusts the fish on the oven tray, over a sheet of greaseproof paper. He cuts even, round slices of lemon. He walks out on the porch with the scissors and gets a few herbs. He wants to mince them as fine as possible with the garlic, so he opens a couple of cupboards in search for the little mixer he knows must be somewhere. It pokes out from the top shelf. He tries to reach it, unsuccessfully. He tries again, goes on his tiptoes, strains and stretches as much as he can. Fuck it.
“No, no. ‘Course I want. Of course.”
T'Challa shuts the door. He walks back to Steve, they shake hands. Tony looks at Steve’s lips while he says, “Thank you for everything you’ve done for us.”
Steve hates himself so much that he wishes someone would come and take him away for more torture, so he doesn’t have to force Tony to be in a room with him.
But now it’s time to dial it up a bit, to try something new and see if it works, and how.
Tony keeps his repulsors aimed at Steve even though Steve raises one hand in a placating gesture of surrender, keeps the other one pressed to his shoulder where he was hit, blood soaking through his henley.
“Right. And the BARF?”
Tony brings a hand to his chest.
, he tells himself.
“Oh, that’s good.”
“You’re not afraid of me, of calling me out on my bullshit. The whole Captain America thing, you respect it, but you don’t let it stop you from telling me what you really think. I think we’re both stubborn, but about different things. I think that in many ways we’re opposites, but I also think that at our core we’re not that different. We fight for the same things. We believe in the same things. And maybe we have different methods, maybe we see the world in different ways, but if we trust each other... then we can turn these differences into our strengths, instead of our weaknesses. And if we do, no alien threat stands a chance against us.”
But then a voice in his mind says something. It’s scolding him, but in an amused way.
All his muscles are pulled taut, and he’s not breathing at all for what seems like a very long time.
They cut my ear off.
“You said you were fine. You said you weren’t hurt.”
for him, because he can’t say it, not right now and not like this. “And then I… inside of you. And it felt, it felt, it… The way it felt…” He touches his forehead with his fingers, lost. “And I almost said it. That I love you.”
He thinks about their fingers brushing, Steve’s fear of having messed this up even more. His apologetic, terrified face. Tony’s whispered reassurance.
“What would you have me do, Tony? I don’t know how to fix this any more than you do.”
And Steve is ashamed of himself, because he knew this was a thing here, of course he did, but he just—
He’s worried. He doesn’t know how long it will last.
It’s strange, sometimes, to think about Steve as an artist. It’s easier to just see him as a soldier, as a living legend, as the Captain America of the old comics Tony so avidly read as a kid and treasures so possessively as an adult. As the Avenger he followed into battle those few times.
“Dad said to stay with you. He went downstairs ‘cause Uncle Rhodey needed him for a thing. Dunno what. Do you wanna hug She-Hulk?”
“But—”
“You must know the political situation has changed. You must know they’re allowed to go back to the United States,” T'Challa says, uselessly, because Tony knows. Of course he knows.
They fill it with all her things—her computers, her She-Hulk poster, her books and toys.
“Yeah. I remember,” he replies.
“Tell me again,” Tony says, “please. Can you—”
Tony—this imaginary Tony that Steve must be hallucinating—touches him. He brushes a hand through Steve’s hair and Steve leans into it. It feels so real.
“What kind of problem?” Bucky asks, concerned, and Tony fears this brand of jealousy will never leave him. Even though Bucky’s a Beta, and Steve isn’t attracted to Betas. Even though Bucky is bonded and married with Natasha.
Steve tears his gaze away from his book when Tony enters the room. He smiles.
This is a special rut. He got that since the beginning. He’s never felt like this. The need, how much he craves Tony, the lust—they are unprecedented. Hell, he was about to die if he didn’t have Tony. To
For Steve, guilt takes the physical form of a very cold shiver that runs through him from head to toe. It makes the hair on the nape of his neck rise, and he zips up his hoodie, uselessly.
Wait.
“I’m alright. We haven’t killed each other yet, I’m sure you’d count that as a win.”
I wasn’t expecting any less.
The Piazza del Campo is an architectural masterpiece that takes Steve’s breath away. It’s accessible through little alleys, so you can’t see it at all until you’re right in the middle of it. It’s theatrical, in a way, like a curtain being suddenly lifted to reveal an elaborate scenery. The Piazza is shell-shaped, and divided into nine triangular slices representing the nine men who used to hold the power during the Middle Ages. It was a sort of declaration of liberty, Steve understands, a way for the people to say they wouldn’t be ruled by just one person who could decide for everyone, like it happened in many other Italian cities at the time. The Piazza isn’t flat, but built on a gentle slope, so the rainwater can drain away through a grating placed right where the nine slices meet. In the lower end of the Piazza, along the straight line of the semi-circle, stands the Palazzo Pubblico, with the Torre del Mangia.
“Your wound’s healed,” he says, and Steve looks down at his chest.
“Steve, how… how have you been doing?”
But he doesn’t feel sorry.
Steve is going to fuck him, and he’s gonna knot him, and he’s not gonna bite him. He’s not going to claim Tony as his mate, he’s not going to form a bond with him.
“Oh, Tony, you barely slept.”
Tony’s mind splits into a million pieces, something deep inside him rips forever, an assortment of all the emotions he’s ever felt and all that he could possibly feel floods him completely. He’s drowning in them, in every emotion, in none of them. They nullify each other.
“Tony, Tony... slow down. It’s okay.” Steve rests his hand on Tony’s knee, draws circles over the bones with his thumb, and Tony goes quiet and nods, and gets it all under control.
Steve takes a deep breath, and looks at Tony. Tony doesn’t look back, and he feels like a coward.
“To hell with this. I’m done with you.”
He wants to ask,
“Could you keep your arms up? Like this,” Steve asks, and he sounds like he’s in a dream. Tony throws his arms past his head and Steve stretches his neck to let kisses cascade on one of Tony’s triceps, to scatter little bites on the softer skin there, and Tony wishes he could have those teeth someplace else, that he could feel them sink into his shoulder and bear that brief pain in exchange for—
He caresses Steve’s thigh in long strokes, up and down, up and down, until Steve notices and he relaxes against him.
But it’s been five days now of regular (amazing, mind-blowing) sex with his Omega and his knots haven’t changed at all, and he still wakes up dizzy and hurting all over until he pushes into Tony and can breathe again.
On the bottom right corner of the drawing there’s a date (two days after the Battle) and then it says,
Steve tips Tony’s head up with a finger under his chin, and kisses him.
once a day. That’s the secret, the whole point. Don’t let the memory take over your mind. Don’t try to repress it completely either, because it will never work. Instead, let it come out of that hidden corner of your soul for just enough time to keep it at bay. But never a moment more.
“Well, if it’s any consolation, no matter the state of our personal relationship, we’ll need to work together. As Avengers.”
“Forty-two.”
He’s always bound with vibranium. He’s starting to hate the damn stuff.
Tony looks at him then, and it’s devastating.
His heart is beating really fast. Tony can hear it, with his head bent to rest over Steve’s collarbone. He feels his own heart rate speed up, and he imagines his heart beating against Steve’s; the two pushing at each other in a bizarre dance of blood and muscles.
But then.
He knows better than to challenge Steve now. He’s not afraid, but he also isn’t mean.
“Sorry,” Tony slurs, and lets go of the tension; Steve can feel it with his fingers. He resumes moving them inside Tony, and reaches up to kiss him, distracting him a bit, splitting his focus on something else, but Tony is great at multitasking, and he kisses Steve like his life depends on it—just how Steve likes it.
Maria asked if she could think about it for one day, and Antonio allowed it with a calm nod of his head.
Tony is the little spoon like this and it… hell, it feels so nice.
“Shit,” he murmurs, and hopes the water swallows his voice enough so that Steve doesn’t burst into the bathroom with a worried face.
He’s thought about it, once or twice. About getting Doom to send him back in time. Save Tony. Take that bullet for him, if necessary, bleed out on those steps for him. But Doom was Osborn’s prisoner, and the same old problem presented itself: they couldn’t get into the damn prisons.
), and straddles Steve’s thighs. Steve, thankfully, puts his hand back on him immediately, it’s big and warm and his grip is tighter than the other time they did this and it just— it feels so
But they are a good family.
Tony opens his eyes—he closed them at some point, squeezed them shut to better focus on every sensation, because Tony never avoids feeling it all to the end, whatever it is.
“Sensible? Are you kidding?”
“I wasn’t laughing.”
“Alright, in general. Takes a billionaire to feed him.”
Silence. Steve kisses his temple, and it’s the most tender thing Tony has ever felt.
The only thing that’s different, now, is Steve’s beard.
Tony reaches for the bond inside his mind for the first time in ten years, and Steve gasps.
“I’ll take care of it.”
Only one person doesn’t come over. But Tony didn’t really expect him to.
It feels new and old at the same time. He’s still doing what he’s done for most of his adult life, and yet something inside him has shifted, and he hates that. No one has the right to change someone else like that, the way Tony’s been changed. No one.
Slowly, and very, very carefully, Tony reaches up to intertwine Steve’s fingers with his own, stares at their hands. Steve can’t breathe. This can’t possibly mean–
And seriously: he can’t believe Tony trusts him this much that he would share
“Tony... shit. Tony, hey, hey. Can I touch you?” Steve’s crouching in front of Tony, one knee on the floor. He’s close and he smells like roses, he smells like blue.
Tony wakes up to Steve hiding his face in the crook of Tony’s neck, gritting his teeth and shaking through his orgasm. Tony feels like his muscles and his bones are made of clay, he feels all— tender and soft and— squishy. Like he’s made of clouds. Of whipped cream.
Tony laughs, because he doesn’t know how else to react to this.
“Tony?”
They wake up. They fuck. They fall asleep again.
A grimace makes its way up to Tony’s lips. “Don’t really know about that.”
He’s here for this. He’s dreamed about this. It’s the only thing this monster deserves, it’s the only thing that will make him breathe again.
Steve takes a moment to look at Tony’s body as well, slides his fingers, feather-like, over his right arm, blue with half-healed bruises. The result of their last fight with Doom and his bots. Dear Victor is gonna pay for those the next time Steve gets his hands on him.
Here. Hell.
“Well, for your information, I am more than comfortable with being touched by people who never beat me half to death!”
“It wasn’t your fault. She wanted to protect you.”
Tony props himself up with his arms, and turns to kiss Steve, slow and sweet. He plays with Steve’s tongue, sucks on it, maybe he tastes himself there. The thought makes Steve’s head spin.
“Like a walking Italian stereotype.”
Step, step, step.
“Tony! Hey, hey, hey!”
Tony straightens out the living room and prepares for bed.
He’s naked.
“Did it help?”
He fucks Tony with his fingers while he speaks, and he feels Tony shake around him with more laughter. He doesn’t know what’s got into him, but as long as he’s happy, he’s not going to question it.
The blond wiggled under him and he felt a twitch between his legs.
"I'll reclaim you," promised Tony softly.  "I'll kill him. You're mine. All mine." He nosed Steve again.  "My omega." That was really the only solution, as far as Tony could tell.
Tony forced a smile and looked up at Steve.  "Trust me, the situation with Vanko was totally under control," he joked.  "Whips McGee didn't stand a chance.  Anyway, he was the only other guy in the world who knew how to build an arc reactor, and he's dead, so... everything is hunky-dory."  He looked down and cleared his throat, reaching up to rub the back of his neck.  "...I never told anyone about that, what happened, two years ago.  It's ancient history, right?  ...but, uh... if you could, you know, not tell anyone.  That would be great."  A pause.  "The guy that did it is dead," he added.  Another pause.  "He didn't bite me.  He used a cigarette.  That's why I quit.  So, really, I owe him one, I mean, you know how bad cigarettes are for you... not that I smoked a

revised."
Natasha shrugged.
?  Who was Tony, then?  He'd never been targeted by HYDRA, hadn't even known about them until recently.  Steve was talking about Bucky, Tony knew; he could practically read Steve's thought.  Knew he was thinking about his Alpha dropping off the train. Knew he was thinking about finding his Alpha post-experimentation, when they couldn't feel each other anymore.
Objectively, he knew was 'good looking' (whatever the hell that really meant). The serum was
She turned and began striding out.  Clint followed her.  Phil looked to Steve.
"You s-see their t-true c-colors--" the man on the ground said.  Steve pressed down on him and he let out a strangled cry of pain followed by a babble of words: "Please, please stop, they want the serum.  That's all I know, I swear, please... the others all died or went feral..."
Malick's hackles rose and he excused the two of them, hooking his fingers into Donner's collar and yanking him away.  Donner cast a regretful look over his shoulder at Steve.
Tony was grinning but also looked confused.
On the plane Steve paced  back and forth along the aisle. Every time he caught Tony's gaze he smiled at him. This was actually happening. They were goddamn doing this.
Tony sighed longingly, unintentionally.
Banksy shuffled over to the coffin and set a hand on it, his other hand gripping a wrinkled sheet of paper tightly.
?  No, that place lets in omegas, I was there like last year and I remember there was an omega!"
"Thank you Banjo.  ...you go with Tony and the others to the lobby.  I'm gonna go check out outside."
Did they make Hallmark cards for that?
She shrugged expansively.  "Well, they gave him that serum."
He pulled up outside of their hotel.  Tony peeked out nervously. He wasn't sure how they were supposed to walk through the lobby without being noticed.  Sure, their clothes were dark, but on the silver case, the bloodstains were obvious.
"...never say what again?" he asked, trying to remember the last thing he'd said before the headache had hit him.  "...that we're together?"
The man he'd been talking to quickly said, "Let 'im go, Randy, the guy's obviously a nutcase.  I'll pay for him. ...think we'd better warn Captain America about his biggest fan?"
with bias, and he was only just now becoming conscious of it.
"They're headed east.  We're in pursuit.  ...should we put him down?"
Expo, I should be spending more time there... but... but maybe you could, I dunno, only do one or two interviews this week?  Tell America to save some Steve for me?"  Tony didn't add the sharp, magnetic pull he felt toward Steve, the need to be wrapped around him almost constantly.  How leaving Steve at the base and going home alone had been one of the most painful things he'd ever experienced.
Steve laughed gently. "Alright. Alright." He gently curled his hands onto Tony's shoulders. He was grinning at him, clearly proud of himself. He leaned down to kiss Tony firmly, a hint of tongue before he pulled away.

Everything.  Everything was wrong.
"But it's not good enough!" Steve snapped and batted Tiberius' hand away suddenly. "Don't you get it?! It's not good enough! I'm supposed to be a role model, I'm supposed to help omegas to take control over their own lives, but I don't even have a fucking say in mine. I'm a goddamn joke.  I'm a
"I did know your father," said Fury, lacing his fingers together pleasantly.  "He was a founding member of SHIELD."
"No, for the EXO-7 Falcon."
Steve needn't have bothered asking JARVIS to call for Tony; Tony was already hurrying down the streets, alerted to the drop in Steve's stomach.  "Steve?  What happened?" he asked.
He groaned weakly.  "JARVIS," he groaned.  His arms were still around Steve, whose body was warm.
yet again because he couldn't stress that enough. "Bucky, I'm sending someone to come pick you up, and you're gonna be polite, okay? You won't hurt anyone."
He reached up to pull back the shoulders of Steve's shirt to kiss his back.  His skin was smooth and flawless, as much because of the serum as because of his being an omega.
?  You're dating
"Next question."
There was a knock on the door.
"You four are
to replacing his old assistant.  Steve and Pepper were
Now that she thought about it, she and Tony were drifting apart and had been since Afghanistan.  She decided her New Year's resolution would be to try to spend more time on their friendship. The company sucked up a lot of her free time, but she didn't want to wake up one morning and discover their strange little friendship had dissolved.
"Oh, HR won't like this," said Phil mildly, watching Tony twitch on the floor.
"Tony doesn't know. No one knows." Steve couldn't hide the tremor in his voice. When had he even last had one? He could barely remember. He had half heats before the serum and during the war his body had been in survival mode. He'd only had one fully fledged heat, ever. They'd locked him in a safe house and Dugan had sat outside the front door with a shotgun the entire time.
"To be fair, the beginning was a lot less sore and messy than-
"Sure! No problem."
"You wanted to be there," pointed out Tony.
"You're the only one I let boss me around," Steve assured him and pressed a kiss to the edge of his jaw. And then another kiss. And another. Then he dragged his teeth along the jut of it gently. "You're the only person I've ever let
"HEY!" shouted Tony, panic rising in him.  But the monitors had already gone dark and Steve was no longer panicking.  He was just... sitting there.  "What's wrong?  Is he okay?  What's going on?" demanded Tony frantically.  He remembered how Steve had told him that it had taken hours for the plane to go under, how his drowning had been slow and cold and painful.  Tony's heart was throbbing; he wanted to go to his omega; he was panicking because he knew the last memory in the world Steve would want to relive was that one--
"Excellent timing.  Right before Steve's speech," said Pepper, voice dripping with venom.  "You couldn't just
"But if he
Steve shook his head.
Tony stared after Gleason, mulling over what he'd said.  What were the chances?
, Steve thought, but he complied and kissed the back of it. She almost blushed. "This is Louisa, my wife. She's a massive fan of yours."
Trey shrugged. "They basically do what it says on the tin. They suppress... like everything that makes you an omega. They just take away everything that makes you
"...you sayin' I look old?" asked Tony, half-teasingly.
Come on, of all the nights to be drunk, tonight's the night," protested Tony.  "Besides, I'm not asking to be allowed to drive down Sunset Boulevard. I'm asking to share an intimate moment with my mate.  We're on a beach at night, in Malibu... this is one of the most romantic places in the world, on one of the most romantic days of the year... you know I love you, right?  ...did you make a resolution? I did. I'm gonna... I'm gonna be a better Alpha to you, Steve. No. Sorry. Not a better Alpha. A better
Pepper handed him a bottle of water and Tony dumped it over his head, gasping at the cold water.
"So...what are the chances of us going flying?" Steve asked curiously, eyes narrowing. "Like...I mean, if Rhodey can fit in one, then I could too, right?" The man was a soldier, a little shorter than Steve, but still. If he could fit in a suit, couldn't Steve? He understood they were precious property to his Alpha, but, honestly, ever since Steve had laid his eyes on them all he'd wanted was to know what it felt like. He'd always been an adrenaline junkie and the thought of flying around in one of those things was
it, Tony..."
Judy was barking last-minute instructions to everyone.
Was he still dreaming? Steve reached over, grabbing his phone. He had a few messages from Aria and Banksy.
Nick actually sounded a little stressed, which was new for him:
"Tony."  Steve's voice was firm.  "
Tony wanted to make fun of Steve, but instead found himself putting an arm around his shoulders and snuggling up to him, pulling Steve close to him, comforting him.  Ugh, since when had he gotten to be such a sap?

But Steve wasn't listening. He'd gone to raid the fridge for more juice.
do in the suit.  Steve was curling up into him.  "Nat, how much longer?" he whined into the comm.
"I dunno, I guess I'm just special!"
.  Squeeze your fist three times, then hold."
"Tony?  ...Tony, you okay?  You in there, Tones?  Hello?"
He reached up and grabbed Steve's hand.  "...yeah.  Yeah, I'll be fine," he said, swallowing.  "...sorry."  He let go of Steve's hand.  "Only, um... only four people ever touched it.  You included.  I'm... I'm weird about people touching it.  It sort of powers my heart, y'know."  He dropped his hand with a nervous laugh.  Steve had held it before; he didn't have to worry about Steve.  Still, it was disconcerting, having someone touching it.  Tony had had a lot of partners reach for it, and that was one of his few deal-breakers.  He'd kicked more than a few supermodels from his bedroom at 2 am, half-naked and furious, for trying to touch his chest.  (Pepper hated dealing with these especially but did so without complaint when Tony had explained to her why.)
"What do you think that stuff with Wisdom was--"
"How come I gotta go with Sam?" demanded Tony.
Tony wouldn't like seeing him like this.
"You think y
"No," said Happy and Pepper together.

knife.  One of Steve's knives.  He was twirling it with a bored look, as if he were alone.
Tony's mouth twitched.  "Alright, alright." He slid his body into the water with a sigh of contentment.  The water was heated and after the cool sea air it was delicious; his skin broke out in goosebumps.
Clint frowned. "Why?"
need to get to DC."
She dragged Steve off, just as Tony had been dragged off to the bar with Annette.
He glanced down even when Tony told him not to look. He could make out a few signs, all of the same caliber. "I've been shot before. Misspelled insults on cardboard don't really compete," Steve said, sounding totally unaffected as he took his sunglasses off and tucked them inside the pocket of his blue jacket.
"But after they've bought you, right?" Steve pointed out and then Nine looked sheepish.
Tony was warm and buzzing against him. he was drunk, Steve could tell, but after the week they'd had and all the chaos around them he couldn't really be mad at him for it. As far as new years went this was pretty awesome. Tony's little mini break down under the bed felt an age away now.
"He's awake," said someone, somewhere.
Steve turned around to see Haley. She was dressed in green, her neck totally collar-free and her hair swept back from her face.
." he murmured.  "
"Shh," murmured Tony, transfixed.  His attention was divided between the old film and the notebook in his hands; he was almost going cross-eyed from trying to focus on both at once.
So, yeah, Steve was getting freaked out.  It just seemed too real.
"That's ridiculous. They're just trying to undermine our relationship because they're threatened by it. And, frankly, it's no one's business," Steve pointed out calmly. His gaze flitted down to the box and then back up to Tony. He stood and moved to take his Alpha's hands in his, not caring if they were dirty with grease. "
"Oh, right.
"...I mean, it's not
Sam placed a hand over one ear; he had a headset, Tony didn't.  "Cap, Widow, looks like the power's down. You're cleared. I've got a line of sight on the back door and right now the guards are distracted, you got about five minutes if you want to take it.  There's a keycard on lockdown you can scramble and a double dead-bolt that's going to need forced."
"Steve," repeated Tony.  He rolled his head over. "The... the last four digits of the tags."
"And, what, instead you went into heat and ended up boning?"
"Make me mate you?" he repeated in confusion.  Had he heard right? "...I'm not allowed to mate.  I'm a soldier; I don't have a mate. I'm not bonded to anyone."  The omega's words and tone was accusatory, like he had failed, but he knew he hadn't; Karpov had given him orders which he had satisfactorily completed.
The funny thing was, it wasn't like it was a secret.  Steve was strong and independent and confident and assertive.  But he was also generally eager to please and take care of Tony.  They'd fallen into those roles naturally. Case in point: Steve had given Tony eight months' worth of blowjobs before Tony had ever put his mouth on him.  Case in point: Steve made Tony breakfast almost every morning and sometimes brought it to him in bed, while Tony was still uncertain as to how to make an omelette without over- or under-cooking it.  Case in point: Steve had been force-bonded and was being impaled by a ruthless media, and yet he was still willing to indulge one of Tony's fantasies.
He looked over his shoulder but the guard had left, probably for a smoke break, and he was alone.  He was hoping to for Karpov to be there, to explain. Karpov could always explain. But he was alone and alone, he was having trouble making sense of what the omega was saying.
"His vitals are normal."
"Sometimes people get into cars and don't come back," said Tony.
The soldier was in the lab after hours.  He was watching the television, which Karpov had left on to keep him company.  Karpov was busy on the computer, occasionally yelling into the phone. They'd stop by to escort the twins, who had a meeting with Dr. Ludheim and Baron von Strucker.  Karpov was in a foul mood; the mere mention of Dr. Ludheim made his face twist in annoyance. So the soldier was pleasantly surprised he was being allowed to watch the television, and even more delighted to see the blonde omega he liked on the screen.
It occurred to him that, between Pepper and Steve, he clearly had a thing for dominating personalities.
"Oh, thanks.  ...I need a lighter."
He crossed the room, his movements slow and guarded.
Barb looked like a mild sort of woman. Steve could imagine her being a good counselor. She walked with her hands clasped in front of her and wore a soft, navy blue sweater. She smiled at Steve warmly. They were all smiling at him. He guessed he really was kind of a celebrity around here. "The rest of them are very excited to meet you, Captain. They all think you're very brave."
Maybe he was still in denial.  Steve's look hadn't left much room for arguing.  Steve seemed convinced the two omega Bartons were related.  But Tony couldn't wrap his head around it. It was too surreal.
. "I wasn't... I wasn't sure you'd come."
"Haven't you listened to anything Nancy's been saying about drugs, Tony?"
Everyone woke around half four in the morning. They had to be ready in time. It felt weird to be in his SHIELD gear again but Steve figured this situation was as close as he was ever going to get to actually needing it on. He just had the main suit on, no gloves or helmet or anything. Steve didn't want to look like he was actually ready for a real life fight.  But he also knew how the uniform could motivate and inspire people.
he moaned against Steve's skin, wiggling his fingers.
Although, currently... Steve felt okay.  Okay-ish, anyway.
"...mm'k... first, let's get these off..." said Tony, tugging at Steve's waistband.  He took the hem of his own shirt and pulled it over his head, immediately throwing both of them in the bluish glow of the arc reactor.  He kicked off his boxers without any hesitation, his hands roaming Steve's body as much as possible, touching his neck and face and chest and shoulders.  He paused for a moment with his fingers lightly on Steve's throat. He thought about asking him to wear the collar, but that seemed like it would be too much, so he kept his mouth shut.
Brennan looked petrifying. There was a quiet moment when everyone hesitated and then the agents began to shuffle out, Tony kicking against Maria's grip. But the woman was stronger than she looked and dragged Steve's Alpha out of the room without much issue. Phil hesitated, but didn't approach; Steve's hands were still clenched by his sides.
the Avengers Initiative,
He gave Steve a couple of friendly thrusts; Steve's body tensed against them.
Before Steve could warn Tony the waiter had appeared with his drink. It certainly looked like lemonade. "There you go, Captain."  The waiter smiled and handed him the glass.
Bonds were only distractions.  He had no mate.  Only objectives.  Only missions.
Steve almost smiled; he had forgotten how cheesy his Captain suit was to someone who had never seen it before. "So... er, guessing you don't have any clothes either? Grab that sheet and we'll get you out of there. I just got to open the other doors."
Tony looked around in alarm.  Pepper's tentative suggestion had rattled him.
"Not if we bred him to the asset.  He's modified," said the younger man.  "All you'd have to do would be to induce heat and then, bam!" he slapped the lab's plain black counter.  "Not even Karpov's precious program would stop him."
"Hey, buddy, you're in heat," said Tony.  "Also, congrats... looks like we'll be able to do 84 after all."  He offered a smile. His cock was aching. Tony couldn't exactly say he was looking forward to this; Steve's last heat had been rough on both of them.  At least for the next twelve hours, they would be semi-lucid.
"Yeah."
The night of the party, Pepper wouldn't be attending. And Steve wasn't expected to either, technically. But Pepper had asked him to keep an eye on Tony, though she assured him that one of Tony's old friends, Rhodey, would be there to ensure things didn't get too wild.  She informed Steve he could leave after Rhodey arrived and that he wouldn't want to be there after midnight anyway.  Stark parties got legendarily out of control and Tony would be insufferably demanding.  Besides, he'd be too drunk to even remember if his PA was there or not.
"Cut to the chase, bot," snapped Tony.
"Good call," said Aria, pulling out her phone.
; I don't know why I would again in this century. But if it's because he doesn't have the
"Omega," he said with delight when Steve stopped speaking.
"Why isn't that perfect?" asked Tony, sitting up.
Tony got up and went to the kitchen to fold some coffee ground into a napkin and put them over his face.  Natasha was right; the smell helped clear his head.
, Ty!"
"Is any of yours left?" asked Steve, craning, trying to look at the mark in the mirror.  An impossibility.
Gideon sighed as if he were talking to a stupid child. "Don't be so over dramatic, Captain."
"Hey, I thought those pamphlets looked great.  You're welcome, by the way!" said a guy who Tony assumed was Dave.
(Another question bubbled to the back of Tony's mind: how did Natasha do it?  When Clint presented himself, did she just ram a dildo into him or what?)
"Don't let appearances fool you.  The girl's a mutant. Her HYDRA code name is the Scarlet Witch, and she's deadly," said Maria.
Around noon, Steve woke briefly; Tony had turned off the television. Steve didn't even really open his eyes. He was vaguely aware of covers being pulled up around them and resting his head against Tony's chest, his position being carefully maneuvered so the ridges of the arc reactor didn't press into his cheek. Steve mumbled something along the lines of Tony's name but nothing truly coherent came out. It was like his body had been completely drained and was now on a massive recharge.
"No, Steve has it."
?  Was he not content because of the terrible society he was being forced to champion, unaware of the oppressiveness of freedom?
"I hope you realise you have to suit up for the kids, Cap'n," George said around his straw, giving Steve a jokey wink.
But that was the wrong reason to have a child. Steve was aware of that.
"Oh look, we have some early ones of Steve in here."
Steve figured the bar didn't have pure ethanol. He politely said no.
"сэр," said Bucky.  His body had gone stiff again, straight, and there was no doubt in Steve's mind that Bucky would have probably jumped off a cliff without hesitation if told to.
"I'll get your goddamn bottle of Jack," he muttered and with that Steve pulled away. If Tony wanted to die drinking then that was his choice to make, wasn't it?
He watched Fury and the others disappear into the observation room.  He'd been there, ages ago, watching Steve.  Now their roles were reversed.  It was one-way glass and Tony felt a little weird knowing he was being watched without being able to watch back.
about your relationship.  This is about whether or not he has vulnerabilities that can be exploited.  I know you and him are feeling all lovey-dovey and you just came off your honeymoon, but think for one goddamn moment.  You think HYDRA would pause for a split second before they exploited your bond?  Huh?"
He texted the street corner with Tony's phone to Natasha and reiterated the
"Tony- Tony it's..." Steve pushed himself up suddenly, finally able to move. He got out of the car and moved to help Tony stand, hands on his arms gently. Steve ran his hands down his biceps. "It's okay. We're together in this. And yes, I love you and I'm happy," he promised and moved his hands to cup his cheeks, pressing their foreheads together as if that would somehow push Bucky out of him. "Please, just...don't
Aria turned to MacKenzie as she pushed sausages around a frying pan. "Does this mean it's going to be over for Steve too?"
"...fine.  Do whatever you like.  I do highly encourage you to attend some of the workshops, Mr. Stark.  You'll no doubt find some very informative... maybe by the end of the weekend, you'll have a bit more pride in your status," said Malick.
A few people in the audience were grinning and tittering.  Richard's energy was infectious and Tony begrudgingly had to admit, he liked his style.  Despite the beard and glasses, Richard was clearly younger than he appeared. Probably no more than ten years older than Tony, actually.
He definitely planned to chew Fury out, though, as soon as the opportunity arose.
"Yes, sir.  ...there are several packages for you outside."
He went into the closet to hang up his suit and tie; he threw his shirt on the floor and pulled on an undershirt to sleep in.  Steve, he noted, was still sleeping clothed.
"Huh?"
He tilted his head back up to kiss him at the guide of Tony's hand and nuzzled their noses together before Steve tilted their mouths together, slanting them in a kiss. He shivered and circled his hips slowly again before he beginning to rock up and down. "You're special," Steve whispered against his lips when they parted for air. "You...make me feel...special..." He ran his hands down his biceps. Steve almost sounded like he was talking to himself. "No one else ever did."
"Just...just wanna sleep Tony," Steve mumbled, tugging his mate closer. He tucked his head against the crook of Tony's neck and closed his eyes. This heat didn't feel like the others. Richard had been right, it was...fainter somehow. Steve had a feeling it would only last a few days, if that. They could manage contraception themselves for just a few days. Hopefully. It felt like they needed their own space now.
like Steve Rogers, huh?"
The omega's eyes were blue and they were lovely.  He gazed into them longingly. He'd never felt this way about anyone, not even Karpov.
is the language of love, not Russian?  Russian's one of the
"He did that before," Steve pointed out. "And then he
Tony stared out the window gloomily.  "...shitty," he said honestly.  He didn't really feel like talking about it with her.  He'd gone and talked to Ivan, a brief, five-minute encounter that had been five minutes too long.  He had learned nothing, aside from the man's name.  Ivan Vanko.  And that he knew how to build an arc reactor.  And then he knew what an arc reactor, placed into a human body, did.
"No, it's because they were boring.  I had access. I just have a policy against, y'know, being bored.  Someone give me the 411. ...Steve, 411 is a number you call for information."
Athena was still watching them attentively; she put a finger in her mouth sweetly and smiled at Steve.
"...okay," said Tony, who hated the idea of being banned from cleaning up his own missiles.  Wakanda was known for being infuriatingly closed off from other countries; it was underdeveloped but prosperous compared to its neighbors.  It was a quiet little country. The Wakandans had a strong sense of African heritage that they didn't want white-washed by getting too involved in western affairs. They had adamantly refused to be involved in any wars, providing refuge to those displaced by their own civil wars without ever having any conflicts of their own.  They also refused to accept aid from western countries.
When Steve finally moved into grabbing distance, Tony did just that, grabbing his shirt and burying his face into the fabric.  He knew he was imagining it but he almost felt like he could smell the other Alpha on Steve, and he found himself stroking Steve's neck, rubbing his face into Steve's chest, wanting Steve to smell only like Steve and like him.  There was no foreign scent to cover up, though.  (Except, maybe, a brief little hint of Natasha?  Tony's hackles rose immediately, unintentionally.  Oh, God, this was not going to be easy.  If Tony had thought keeping jealousy under control was hard before, learning about another Alpha like this, only a few days after mating and bonding, was going to make it fucking impossible.)
"Rogers?  Stark? Hello?  ...we're coming back," said Natasha's voice over the comm.  Tony ignored her; he was nuzzling against his mate, trying to reassure him that he'd find a solution to this problem.
He grabbed his pillow and weakly bopped Steve with it as he nuzzled his cheek. "Waffles.  Blowjob," he mumbled half-heartedly, not wanting to move. He did this often, fucking up his sleep cycles completely by staying up for a day or two and then crashing all day and waking up in the evening.
Two figures appeared in front of the door.  One was unfamiliar, a man in a uniform holding a gun.  The other was very, very familiar.
"Mmmm," purred Steve.
She set the bird down gently; Tony watched from above, waiting for Steve to board before he started talking through their radio system.  He felt like maybe they'd be less upset about his accessing the closed line if Steve were there.
"Argentina."
"It's retro, right? That's a word people use these days..." Steve chuckled with a shrug. He had about zero idea about fashion right now. All he knew was how to match colours and what was appropriate to wear to a dinner party. Turns out that isn't so useful in the 21st century anyway; no one had nice dinner parties anymore.  And also, omegas now wore suits like Alphas instead of just waistcoats.
repeated Nick, eye widening.
"After Tony. I know," Steve said, a little shaky as he put the glass back on the side. Ty grabbed a pillow and placed it behind his head so he could lie back against the headboard. "Jesus," he whispered. "I know they wanted Tony dead but I...I didn't think they'd come this far to do it." Steve dropped his hands back down in his lap. "Christ.  ...I told them they had to start anew. That killing Tony would achieve nothing. But they just wouldn't goddamn listen, would they?" Steve's hands curled into fists. "Did SHIELD take them?"
"F-forced bonding is the worst thing in the world," managed Tony.  His mind was still back there and suddenly George's jokes about Luke being bad in bed, about letting someone bite the back of his neck, weren't funny.
Rationally, Steve knew his was coming from a good place. Sam just cared...that's why he didn't think Tony was good enough. But it still annoyed him, because also
be going."
The two of them stared at each other.  The crowd stared at them.  Tony took one small, stumbling step back and caught himself.
, SHIELD had been keeping tabs on him. If it was SHIELD.
There was no sun, only a lightening blue on the eastern horizon.  Steve was beaming, star on his chest, stripes down his waist. Tony threw on jeans and a t-shirt and then, somewhat hesitantly, a hooded sweatshirt to cover up the reactor's glow.  It was already hot and humid even though the sun wasn't up yet. Fucking Alabama.
take the bait!"
"That will be plenty," Steve assured him. His appetite was huge but compared to what it was back in the '40s it was certainly more 'normal' than it had been before. He was okay with that though. He was out of the field; he didn't need to pack it all on. He was fine like this (as long as he still had his six pack he was undoubtedly fine). "Oh, can we get garlic bread too?"
real, and I'm dreaming.  Right?  But either way, in theory, I can't be killed.  Which means..."
Pepper reached out and swatted his hand.  "Tony, stop it. You're not doing anyone any favors by getting yourself drunk before noon the day before your New Year's party."
"Emphasis on
But they trailed off when the auctionees and waiting staff appeared outside. There was almost forty of them in total and it was quite an impressive sight. They were almost all omegas, a few of the waiters being betas as well. They looked a little overwhelmed at the crowd ahead but the crowd themselves went ecstatic. They were cheering, shaking their signs in the air. Tony and Steve were suddenly old news.
Steve was settling; Tony looked up and his eyes locked with Natasha.   "Where the fuck have
Without any warning, Tony dove, touched the bottom, then surfaced again, shaking out his hair aggressively.  Without any product, and soaking wet, the ends of it came into his eyes.
would have done this to me. And he never would have tried to..."
to be supportive," said Tony.  "You get that, right?  I'm trying to stand up beside you, be into all this omega rights stuff, but it's hard, Steve.
"Never...never to one about this sort of
"No.  Not gonna bet my omega," said Tony firmly, looking pleased with himself.
Steve stood slowly, tentatively and moved to take Tony's hand before leading him out of the drawing room. It was a sacred place. Nothing would ever desecrate it on Steve's watch. He wondered what he'd do when the walls were full... if Tony would let him take another room.
. And then...then he was...Tony was...
"Eight to ten," said Richard.
"Love you... love you..." murmured Tony between breathless kisses, pushing himself in and out of Steve, feeling the omegas body working his knot.
to a Hot Pocket after choking down a vegan club sandwich, but that was sort of my limit, you know?"
"Jesus Christ," Rhodey muttered. "...I don't know."
"Steve," Aria said firmly. "You're
The moment they descended the stairs, Pepper let out a noise of protest.  "Oh, no. No, no, you two aren't wearing that. I had to reserve the entire lounge due to security concerns, and the media's going to be all over the place.  Tony, at least put on a tie."
"...let me do that."
"...I need a bottle of water," he demanded.  He felt hot and flushed and on edge, and, yes, he could still smell Steve, he desperately wanted him, but he couldn't.  Tony loved fucking his assistants but he didn't want to do it like this.  He didn't want to feel like he couldn't control himself.  Tony had never slept with an omega in heat and never planned to.  Frankly it was kind of disgusting, how it turned perfectly reasonable people into hysterical messes.
Tony's mouth watered.
Steve could hold his breath for two minutes, Tony knew that, so he quite happily submerged himself under water as he took Tony's half-hard dick into his mouth. Over the past seven months Steve had gotten
He kept staring at his hands.  He wasn't sure whether they were telling him to stand or not.  He wasn't sure who they were or where he was or whether or not this was real.
Tony stuffed Alexis's handkerchief against his nose.  "I totally won," he informed this, his voice slightly muffled.
"I need ten million dollars."
Tony was staring at the map on the wall, thinking of Ty, how he'd disappeared and how Tony had never given it much thought.  While Tony was filling out applications for MIT, Ty was off getting tortured, getting experimented on. It gave him chills. And the way this group so casually talked about these things... it was creepy, this sinister, underground movement.
He made a mental note to thank Karpov.
at Steve; the way he was glaring at him almost reminded him of that look his mother would wear when he'd been caught drawing on the walls.
Eric and Gene were both smiling.  "Looks like someone's feeling a bit more dominant.  Collaring him did the trick, didn't it?" said Eric.
Steve kind of missed wearing Tony's robe in the morning, even if his own one was softer and fit a lot better.
The lights flickered as JARVIS rerouted the all of the house's generator power to the collider, and Tony remembered, suddenly, long ago, his father talking about creating Captain America.  They'd been in his study.  Tony wasn't allowed there, technically.  But sometimes, if Howard had had a few drinks and was in a good mood, he'd let Tony sit there and talk happily about the past.  Before the age of eight or so, Tony had sought out these rare meetings, eager to bond with his father.  He would listen, enraptured, remaining silent and nodding gravely, excited for the special privilege of being in Howard's study, an honor that only a few other men had, like Stane and Jarvis.
Steve laughed softly. "Well, you know where the coffee is..." He pointed out and leaned down to nip at Tony's bottom lip softly. As his Alpha pulled on his boxers he rolled over and pulled on his shirt from off the floor, it hung just low enough to be decent but revealed a peek of ass with every step he took.
And just for a second Tony feels as if this, this thing between them, is still broken, yes, but they can fix it.
“You know what I don’t get about this stuff?” Tony says, nudging Steve’s elbow, and Steve stops staring at the little golden stars that decorate the ceiling to look down at him.
“You ready?” he asks, and Tony nods. Good enough.
Tony is hard now, and although his erection isn’t complete, it isn’t any worse than last night. That’s a good sign. Steve gathers saliva in his mouth, he licks thoroughly at the corner of his lips so the skin there isn’t dry and unpleasant for Tony, then he guides Tony into his mouth, sucking him down like it’s the best thing in the world and— it is.
is, but he knows he can’t do it.
“You don’t need to—”
Tony looks at the hollow of Steve’s throat. “Rougher, maybe. Not unkind, just—”
Tony pretends that he’s not hurt by this realization, because it makes sense. Honestly, it just does.
The Bad Mornings usually start with a Bad Night: a night where Steve dreams of Tony being still alive, there with him. He dreams of Tony being happy, being whole and amazing, being clever and brilliant, his eyes shining with joy and love—for life, for Steve.
Tony reaches
Steve seemed to weigh his words. “Because it was the right thing to do,” he replied, looking down at his shoes. “Because I’m in love with you,” he added, quietly.
Steve opens his eyes against the ceiling of his room at the Avengers compound.
“You can say that again.”
He thinks about the move to the compound, imminent at this point. He’s still convinced it’s the best decision, more practical for the Avengers and safer for the people, but he’s gonna miss the city. He’s gonna miss the penthouse.
He tries to breathe, but he can’t; his lungs are burning, his throat, his eyes, that stretch of skin between his legs. He gets up slowly, chances a last glance at Tony’s body—a silent apology, a quiet confession, as if saying
, so why pick an old, used Om—
, and he doesn’t say,
He helps Tony up, then into the tub. He settles behind Tony, welcomes him between his legs. Tony’s resistance is minimal, and when Tony’s back is against his chest, for a moment Steve thinks that everything is right in the world. Everything has slotted back into its proper place.
Tony reaches behind himself, takes one of Steve’s hands into his. He brings it around his body, like he did that night on the couch while Steve was watching
Nothing.
“I wanted to thank you,” Tony says. “For, you know, helping, and… Just, just thank you.”
It’s two lives, shared. Made into one.
The admission feels awfully big for some reason. It makes no sense. Tony already knew this. He was there for all of it, the other half of this huge mess that is their relationship.
Twitchy. Excited. Happy. Nervous.
Tony shouts, “Finally,” takes Steve’s fingers out of himself and sinks back down on his dick. In his hands Steve sees the cock cage.
“Steve?”
“I’ve always been yours,” Tony sighs into his ear, and Steve thrusts into him again, bites at the skin of his shoulder.
Hello, we need two rooms for tonight.
The next thing Steve knows is that he’s kissing Tony, and it feels like a relief, like he can breathe again. He’s trapped between Tony’s desk and his chair. He caresses Tony’s face while kissing him, shoulders hunched low.
“I’m sorry, sweetheart. I didn’t mean to wake you up,” Steve says, genuinely apologetic. Tony had an infernal day yesterday, and has another one scheduled for Monday. Meetings, meetings, and more meetings, for an important acquisition that would create tons of new jobs. Steve doesn’t understand the complexities of Tony’s business, but he does know that Tony was dead on his feet last night, restless, tense, and wasn’t in the mood for anything except taking a shower and going to bed. Which was fine, obviously. Tony needed to rest.
, Tony thinks,
His eyes sting with tears. He doesn’t know what they’re for.
Tony gets up too and bends over his desk, stomach down, and Steve can’t believe what seeing Tony like this does to his heart. He prepares him quickly, and when he slides in everything goes very still and very quiet.
He covers the rest of the distance from Tony with slow steps, the wet grass and the mud squelching under his boots. He sits on the other side of the bench, leaving the liquor in the middle. The rain seeps into his sweatpants and boxers from the wet surface of the seat.
“Don’t... don’t be sorry.” Steve voice has become very sweet, and he starts brushing Tony’s hair away from his forehead, but the repetition of the gesture doesn’t seem to have any real purpose except showing some degree of affection. “Of all the things I regret, especially where you’re concerned, that... I’d never regret that. Even if you don’t...” Steve trails off, unable to continue.
again?”
“She did what she did for me and Bucky, but… she likes you, Tony,” Steve says, and his tone is somber again. “Think whatever you want of me, but don’t think she’s not your friend. Or that you can’t trust her.”
“Do you think— I mean, I know it isn’t possible—I think it isn’t, at least, but—what if I could see how full you were right now. Full of me. Like. If your belly swelled up with it. It would be— I’d like that, I think. I’d like that. It’s a weird thing to say, isn’t it? It’s weird, I’m sorry.” Steve says this whole thing very fast, but also in a shy way, awkwardly.
, and Tony hadn’t, and what the hell was he thinking, anyway? Attacking Osborn like that, in broad daylight, with no protection, no plan, no backup.
“I’m really sorry. I was having a stupid dream.” There’s bitterness in his voice now, just a hint, but Tony can hear it.
Blood.
The days start blending into each other, and Steve is really proud of himself.
“Hi. You alright?”
It occurs to Tony that his inaction, his passive acceptance of the events, isn’t like him. He knows he should fight, he should threaten, he should react. Try to escape, at least.
Steve closes his eyes.
Tony’s scent has shifted. It’s changed.
“I love you—” he sobs, and Steve lifts his arms to hug him, keep him close, whisper in his ear that he loves him too and that he’s never gonna leave him, no matter what.
At some point, Tony will need to say it.
“Sort of. He’s been brainwashed, used, forced to do… I probably shouldn’t tell you this…”
I wish he didn’t have to do this.
Tony pads back to the bedroom, sets his phone down on the mattress.
Maybe Tony doesn’t want to have sex with Steve very often; maybe he doesn’t feel the need anymore. Maybe Steve’s body doesn’t arouse him that much, Steve has so many muscles and not everyone likes all those muscles. Maybe Tony really just can’t get it up all the way anymore, and can’t take pills because of his heart. Maybe he feels ashamed and doesn’t want to talk about it with Steve. Maybe there is some other reason Steve can’t understand.
, that’s not what Tony meant to say.
They fall asleep facing each other.
“And it doesn’t change how I feel about you.”
Time passes, even though Tony can’t keep track of it except for the amount of semen Steve releases into him (it’s getting less and less) and how often he does it (less and less, too).
A super soldier. The daughter of a super soldier. Summer. A lethal combination for wearing PJs to bed.
Steve is staring at him, eyes wide, lips open, holding a breath in his chest. “Tony, I— you look— you are perfect.”
“Tony…”
Steve eats a lot. Except during missions, because the serum kicks his metabolism into a weird survival mode that grants him enough energy from regular rations. Steve’s always been grateful for it: he doesn’t have to fight while hungry, and during the war he didn’t have to feel guilty about getting more food than the Commandos.
He needs to find Steve, but he can’t see anything. FRIDAY isn’t helping him.
Goosebumps form on Tony’s arms. Steve sees Tony close his eyes and shudder, his whole body taken over by an uncontrollable spasm that lasts only a moment, but it’s awful to witness.
The cherries are so red that they almost look black in the dim light of the orchard. They look like a wound against the white of Steve’s skin. Like blood splattered on the snow.
“No, no—” That’s impossible.
“Steve?” Tony tries. “Uh. If you don’t wanna do this or are not in the mood, or, I don’t know—”
“Two heartbeats detected, boss.”
“The day I kissed her for the first time,” Stella says, ripping Tony away from his memory, “it was her birthday. That night, we had permission from Zio Leonardo to go watch the stars in the woods. The following year, we did it again. It became something… important for us.”
There’s a perverse satisfaction in spitting on it, right at the center. It’s supposed to feel like ruining something perfect, but it actually looks all the better like this—stained, marred, blemished. Marked. Tony’s.
“I know. I just… Fuck.” He brushes a hand over his face. He looks like he’s aged fifty years since yesterday, and it takes all the self-control Steve has left not to reach across the bond and soothe his agony.
"Ah," demanded Tony, opening his mouth for another grape.
Dr. Brennan seemed shockingly low-key after all of Fury's doom-filled statements about the state of affairs.  It was difficult, of course, to really know what was happening on the outside. Steve's room didn't have a television or a radio or even a newspaper for him to read; that was probably on purpose.
"I can't even feel you anymore," said Steve with a little shrug.  "And, with all due respect, Stark, I wouldn't want to be bonded to you.  No offense, obviously.  It's just that... well... you're already, you know, taken."
Tony was handling the press like a pro, as always. Steve honestly didn't know how he dealt with it all his life. It would have driven him insane.
"No.  It's perfect," hummed Donner sleepily, still hugging his daughter.  He looked over at Steve, head lolling a little. "Now you've got
By lunch, Lowenstein and five other people had burst in.  Lowenstein was an Alpha dressed in a crisp suit; his associates were three other men and two women, all Alphas as well.  Tony was lounging on the back pool deck; Pepper led him through, past the enormous pile of summonings covering the coffee table.
"Have you eaten anything today?  Here, let's get you up... Tony, please, I really think you need to see this interview.  It’s gone viral and everyone else has seen it.”
The beam flickered off.  The particle ring slowly, slowly dimmed.  But didn't go out.  It remained glowing a steady blue.
Dr. Brazinski was nodding in agreement.  "Not everything needs to be a fight, Steve.  You're not a soldier anymore. And that shouldn't be the only way you define yourself."
"Yes, sir."
Only a few more days.  Two at most, probably.
Natasha frowned in thought. "I actually don't. Want me to look into it?"
"Okay, okay, I'll slow down," grumbled Tony, who had no real intention of doing so.  "So.  You and Au--
," she hissed.  She rounded suddenly on Steve.  "Congratulations on your pair-bond, Steve.  Really.  I think it's lovely."  She turned back to Tony.  "
"Breathe, Tony.  He's still in there.  He'll wake up in a second."
"If anything, I think more of you." Brock paused. "Not in a weird way! Urgh. I'm screwing this up."
Tony let himself out onto the balcony and leaned over the railing with a groan, holding his head in his hands.  He caught a whiff of another Alpha; two balconies away, a man was smoking on his own balcony.  Tony stared.  The man, sensing his gaze, turned and looked at him.  Tony snarled automatically, the hairs on his arms and neck standing up.
"Oh, that doesn't even begin to describe it, Steve.  There's psychological horror, there's thrillers, there's torture porn... I'm pretty sure, at this point, zombie movies have their own category."  Tony laughed, playing with Steve's hair.  "You've got a lot to catch up on.  But you already knew that."
Tony had always thought those expressions were fake, those postures posed.
He slipped into his bedroom as quietly as possible.  Steve's form was lying in their bed, on his stomach, a thin sheet around his waist, his bare back rising and falling with his breaths.
"Stop talking about the stupid Avengers thing."
Tony nuzzled his hair, the drink making him feel warm and fuzzy and loose and affectionate.  "Happy first heat, Stevie. G'night," he mumbled, taking another swig.
"You're doing it for your birthday, isn't that right?  Only, what, another six weeks? Oo, so exciting. Are you going on the front lines, so to speak, Steve?  Dish! Sorry, I'm a little drunk. Talking to Donner... he
"No, I mean Tricksh--"
Steve shrugged. "Sorry."
. Steve groaned, eyes fluttering shut as Tony emptied into him. He trembled and squirmed. At some point, during the knotting process, he came. Steve was distantly aware of his ass tightening around Tony and his stomach getting wet and warm. Fuck. It was like he was floating and he was aware of nothing other than Tony and the place where they were connected.
"I'm not nearly drunk enough," said Tony.  "Put a few martinis into me and then we'll talk-- Oh, hi, Richards!"  A man with dark hair and a hint of salt-and-pepper around his temples had come over to shake Tony's hand.  "How's that big Project 42 going?"
"We're not dating, we're just--"
"Open it!" said Banksy.
"I-I j-just..." Steve's voice actually
"Would you mind... watching it while I grab a shower?"
Steve was walking okay until he got to the door then his thigh was going stiff again. Urgh. Why wouldn't it just heal already?  Yeah, it had been less than twelve hours, but that wasn't the point.  Steve had a dinner to go to.  His body ought to heal one lousy bullet wound.
"Finally!  Some sympathy!" exclaimed Tony.  Aria glared at him and he added quickly, "...not that I deserve it."
Their comms crackled and Clint's voice flooded their ears.  "Guys?!" It was frantic. "I need backup, stat, I'm in the storage--"  The comms cut out again.
"I think you're giving him too much credit," muttered Sitwell darkly, rising, still tapping on his phone.  "Excuse me. I need to report to Pierce that Rogers is out of heat."
Natasha was tapping away on a computer; it was a laptop that had been running on battery power, unaffected by the power outage.  "Preliminary behavioral experiments on mutants. Stuff like that. But nothing about the serum.  It's all coded.  Project Guiding Star, Project Eve... a-ha!  Project Winter!"  Natasha looked over at Tony.  "Stark. I've got a password-protected wall.  Come here, I need you."
"--you smell that?"
"Call if you need anything," Steve nodded, offering her a small smile in return.
Steve set the prawns down. He suddenly wasn't hungry. "I can look after myself," he said.
Tony yelped in surprise when Steve, with very little warning, smashed the lock.
!  What a time to be alive."  He was beaming up at them from the wheelchair.  Smiling, his resemblance to Clint was even more obvious.
," said Brooke.  "You must be so sick of people fawning over you and telling you how brave and handsome you are... of course, it's true..."  She leaned her back against the balcony, smiling at Steve. "Great view, right?"
Tiberius looked both alarmed and confused, but he approached the bed and sat delicately beside Tony.  His smell was almost-- almost-- masked by the stink of sex and sweat in the room. Tony felt, suddenly, like he had a newfound appreciation for Tiberius's hormones; they smelled the way Steve's gland tasted.
A text from Brent Walker came in as Steve was watching the sun creep toward the horizon.
Pepper's eye caught some movement; Phil's hand snaked out and pushed the mug of cocoa away from the entrance to his nest.
The beach (this stretch of it, at least) was
. When Phil had said he was a keen 'nester' he hadn't been joking. Blankets from all over the house, along with cushions and even toilet paper had been molded around chairs and even a table to make a sort of den. It was almost tall enough for a man to stand in and several meters wide either way. Phil had gotten some kind of music playing device inside and was currently blasting out S
"We're not going to hurt them," Maria said, sounding a little perturbed. "But no, this isn't about that."
"Stark!" barked Phil.  He grabbed Tony's arm and half-pulled, half-dragged him over to the door.  "Go," he commanded.
Steve shrugged. "All in a day's work, sir."
"...because you're going to meet one of the leaders of the World Security Council and bringing a weapon of mass destruction might send the wrong message," said Pepper, raising an eyebrow.
"This is Doctor Gleason," Pepper introduced. The man looked around middle aged, soft about the edges. Friendly enough, Steve guessed.
showed up... or I guess,
"Mr. Stark, does Iron Man have any intention of getting involved in the current unrest in Turkey?"
"Happy...first...heat..." Steve mumbled, already drifting off.
About an hour into the movie Steve managed to fall asleep despite all the explosions and intense car chase music. He was still more tired than usual but after everything he'd endured the past few weeks it made sense.
Steve responded almost before Tony had finished talking; a second later, they came to a sharp stop almost perfectly in front of the restaurant, Il Cielo.  It was surprisingly small; it looked more like a house than a restaurant.  The front patio was all brick and there were several small tables covered in white table cloths; the steep eaves were hung with strings of fairy lights, giving it the air of a small village fete instead of a restaurant.  A large window showed a cozy interior.
"Sex."
They climbed into Tony's car, parked by the camp's entrance.  An American flag was flapping in the breeze on a pole above them.  Tony looked up at it with a small huff.
His tongue dragged over Steve's skin and he pressed his chest to Steve's back, oblivious about any mark the arc reactor might make on him; he just wanted as much contact with his omega as possible.  Steve was bucking under him, reacting to ever little movement with joy.  Tony was desperate to find that spot inside Steve that would make him writhe in pleasure and scream Tony's name; he had hit it once before; Steve was warm and slick and Tony wanted to find the perfect angle, wanted to give Steve as much pleasure as he was receiving.  He heard himself moan, muffled, into Steve's neck; he tensed up, pressing down on his knot, wanting to give Steve more, easing in the rest of his swollen member with only a little difficulty.  The moment it was in he resumed thrusting; he loved the way Steve's body tugged on it, massaging it; he'd never had as tight a fit as this with any beta.
The headline read simply:
"Oh my God, Tony, seriously, chill.  Go dance with your mate; this is your song!" he insisted.
Banksy reached for another cocktail.
"And-" Steve sighed and ran a hand through his hair. "With regards to the Winter Soldier: if he really is such a powerful threat, and if he does try to shoot me, I won't have a problem defending myself." He remembered the piercing sound of a shot ringing out in his ears as the man killed him without hesitation. Whoever he was, he was not Steve's friend. "Sure, he smells of Bucky. But Bucky died. The Winter Soldier isn't him; he works for the enemy.  I don't want to reforge anything with
"Your birthday party represented a national threat!  You were wearing a weapon of mass destruction
"After. Sort of. It was...confusing," Steve went a little pink. He didn't think Sam would want details from his heat on the plane. "But he didn't know who I was...you know, it wouldn't have been fair."
experience.  Not as bad as Luke is in bed, but pretty bad!"
He tore out the picture and put it in his pocket along with the yellow ball.  He didn't like Howard (he couldn't remember why but he had a vague idea that the guy was an arrogant, showboating jerk), but he liked Captain America a lot.  He wanted to go find him.  Well, obviously, he had to, because that was his objective.  But even if it wasn't, he would have wanted to, anyway.  And now he had a lead.  Maybe if he could take the blond and kill the one-eyed man, he'd be forgiven and they wouldn't make Karpov retire.
"Whoa, careful!" said Happy, grabbing him.  A couple of paramedics approached but Tony waved them away grouchily.
The shell hit a scaffold that was holding up several stage lights; the whole thing came down in a shower of sparks and groaning, crumpling metal.
"Too bad, Stark.  Steve, go with him.  I don't trust him not to go down there and dick around instead of working."
"Hello, Sheriff," said the man, extending a hand.
"Six fingers, glass of water, and I will
He nodded, still feeling self-conscious and anxious.  He had no idea where this coming from. But it was Tony's birthday and it wasn't the time for it. Steve swallowed and then lifted his head up to kiss his cheek. "Sorry. Drifted off a bit there. Sometimes drawing makes me... weird.  So," Steve squeezed his hand. "What are we doing for dinner?"
"Ladies," Tony greeted them smoothly.
He shivered as Tony's teeth dragged over his pulse point and whimpered at the command, his eyes fluttering shut. He wasn't even aware of Phil anymore until he hears a groan of pain. "Tony...Tony...not in here. No. Not with- It'll be over soon. I promise. It'll be okay," Steve whispered, nuzzling against his cheek. "I promise Tony, please just..."
"RHODEY!" he yelled into the helmet
"Nat. I keep seeing him."
Tony settled down and turned on the TV, flipping through the channels idly.  Steve was still hovering. Tony didn't know what he wanted. He stared at the TV screen, trying to think of something to say.
All four of them had looked too young to even go to a bar.  And now Tony was staring at Steve, thinking about how eagerly this idiot had volunteered to go to war, how desperately he'd wanted to be cannon fodder, and how his own father, who was born in the same year as Steve, hadn't had to worry a bit about the draft.
"Ta-da!  ...almost self-assembling!  I mean, it still needs a ton of work, and it doesn't always work if I'm moving, but... so far, so good!"  Tony drummed his fingers in the air and the RT node in his palm let out a high-pitched whine and it began charging.  Tony twitched his fingers again and it hummed, powering down. Tony beamed.
He really, really liked the omega and hadn't backed down on begging to see him when they arrived at the base.  Karpov had relented "just to shut you up," and told him he could forget about dinner because he'd been so annoying, which the soldier felt was a fair enough trade.  He much preferred spending time with the omega to eating anyway.
It’s—
“I’m sorry if I made you feel like—” Steve starts crying again, his words garbled with tears, “Like I was choosing between you two… I wasn’t... I didn’t know what to do and I was scared and I just wanted you to stop, I didn’t want to hurt you, I didn’t, not hurt you, never, never, never again...”
Steve let out a shaky breath, his cheeks wet and face a little pale. "Why does it hurt so much?" he croaked.
"What?"
"Yoink," said Tony, pulling the tablet away from them again.  "Lighten up, Pepper, I've done this a thousand times.  Stan just has to look pretty.  Hey is that Jeff?  HEY, BEZOS!  BEZOS, HEY!"  Tony managed to shrug Pepper off of him and slip away to talk to Jeff, but got distracted by the scent of an omega in heat; he managed to grab another glass of champagne and cut through the crowd toward the alluring smell.  He had absolutely no intention of making this easy for Steve.  Frankly, he had every intention of making it hell for him, cutting him down a few pegs... showing Pepper that she couldn't just hand him off to some inexperienced blond brat and expect everything to go smoothly.  He was Tony goddamn Stark.  He refused to be bossed around by an omega with an itinerary.  Steve wasn't Jarvis, and he wasn't Pepper, and Tony wasn't going to let him think he came even
"...fine, but please,
Someone was turning him over.
"Selfish, demanding, and sarcastic?" asked Tony, raising an eyebrow.
"They want him to do the modeling gig with this female plus-size actress and a skinny guy who's an athlete swimmer, I think. All big omega names. It's about challenging physical omega stereotypes," Aria said, tapping away on her tablet without looking. "I think it's worth considering."
"You're right," he said grudgingly.  He leaned forward to take Steve's face in his hands.  "You have no idea what it sounds like, do you? Everyone saying, over and over, how Bucky would kill me?  Does it occur to you that I'd rather die fighting for my omega than let everyone stand up for me like I'm a baby bird or something?"
Tony loathed running, himself.  The idea of going nowhere in a hurry just didn't make sense to him.
"Tell me-" Steve pressed. "-everything you know about the Winter Soldier. And, while you're at it, why he tried to take me. But we'll start with the basics."
"They scrambled your brain like an egg," said Wanda.
"Maybe," said Steve.  "...if you want to talk about it, like I said, you can come over, I can explain everything."
By the time they got to the front, Tony had a death-grip on his arm.
"...yeah, you mentioned your last one was a handful.  Hey, listen, Ron..." Tony paused. He had to make this believable.  "...spending time with DeSoto, having an omega actually make me coffee instead of, you know, whining about the forties... uh... being served, treated right for once... it got me thinking."
Steve let his eyes flicker open and lock with Tony's.
Tony nipped at Steve's lips, then leaned down to bite his neck.  His hands slipped down to Steve's waist and plucked at the hem of his shirt, pushing it up, exposing his abs.
"I love you," Steve murmured into the silence. "And I'm proud of you. I know you don't believe it... I can feel you don't. But you did the best you could do and no one ask anymore of you than that."
Steve shivered a little as the pads of Tony's fingers danced over the mark. His skin technically should have healed it over it, but it hadn't. It was almost like a form of acceptance that went beyond the subconscious to the physical.
hey, Steve.
"No," said Tony.
Steve leaned forward to kiss Tony's forehead. He could still feel his hesitation. "I love you and I'm not going anywhere, okay? That simulation was bullshit. None of it was real. None of it meant anything. A big part of the test is how you deal with it afterwards."
He made sure to meet the waiter's gaze whilst he made his order, just as Malick hadn't.
"I--I can't.  It hurts," said Donner.
Boswell chuckled a little.  "Good guy. Interviewed him about... oh... thirty-something years ago?  That was right about the time I met Tom." (It took Tony a split-second to realize he meant Banksy.)  "Had a good chat about the arc reactor, renewable energy..."
"--pассвет. Печь. Девять. Добросердечный. Возвращение на Родину--"
"I think it's shallow.  It's fine," insisted Steve, a little dazed.
"World's favorite superhero?" repeated Tony.  "Oh, that's great; thanks a lot, jerks.  I dedicate myself full-time to being Iron Man and I've practically stabilized the Middle East, but sure, let's hear it for Stars an' Stripes over here."  He was half-joking.  He was much more interested in this omega psychologist.  Was she an omega?  You couldn't tell in pictures or on the television, something Tony often found disconcerting.  He wanted to ask if the guy on the fridge was an Alpha, because if he was, Tony might have to kick some ninety-year-old ass.  But Steve's tone when Tony had asked about him in the first place had held some sort of quality that had made Tony hesitant to ask anything else.
But staring at the ugly, uncomfortable-looking collar in the case, he felt slightly ill.  It looked so heavy and unpleasant, and if it was locked on... was the omega whose collar this had been had to wear it all the time?  Had he or she been made to sleep in it?
He'd spent all day tinkering in the shop, trying to tie a bowtie, and watching reruns of
"Need a ride?" offered Happy, getting up; Pepper got up with him.  He was talking with Aria, but it was clear that Pepper and Happy were leaving together.  Tony's dander rose; being betas, neither of them noticed, but Boswell looked over at Tony sharply.
"Mhm. Definitely." Steve didn't really have to deal with post-sex soreness all that badly. The serum always dealt with it within the first twenty-four hours. He smiled. "Don't gotta worry about me struggling with keeping up," he pointed out with a playful wiggle.  "But I'll try a massage.  I've never actually had a massage in my life," Steve admitted. During the Depression, shockingly, the opportunity had never come up.
Maybe he had.
them and
"You mean you go for a light jog and I end up dying? Sure man, it's been too long," Sam said, patting his shoulder.
"You...you wanna go to sleep? Because I don't really wanna sleep in our suits, Tony," Steve said, sounding a little tired. Since when did being drunk make you tired? Steve thought it made people giddy? Urgh, he was so out of practice. He was never doing this again. What he drank tonight probably would have killed a regular man, or several.  "I've gotta get to Clint's in like...seven hours, no, six...."
Tony looked up, eyes watery.  "I can't even mate him right. His neck tastes bad again.  It's like Russian roulette with this guy's gland... half the time it's perfect and half the time it's like biting into a fuckin' aloe plant."
"It sounded more like official business," said Pepper.
Tony picked up the chart hung on the end of the bed, leafing through it despite Melinda's protests; Steve was still tearing through a medicine cabinet like he might find a vial of omega fingernails or something.  Tony was on Nate's side; he wanted some Vicodin.
"Fuck me, I don't know, do I look like I speak Russian?" snapped Tony, leg jiggling impatiently, arms folded over his bare chest.  Even now, he subconsciously angled it so that his arms blocked most of the arc reactor.
It didn't take him long to drift off the sleep.
The man in the lab coat gestured to a young girl sitting on a stool.  She looked bored. She was sitting slouched, using a foot to swivel the stool around; she had long brown hair but bright eyes that were amber, almost reddish.  She was a beta but she smelled all wrong. Like she'd been rolling around in a big pile of people, sort of. Like her smells were all mixed up with theirs.
The man sitting at the bar with his hand curled around a pint of beer sighed with irritation.  "Hey, Randy, can we change it to basketball or something? This is boring me to death. That fucking spade is everywhere."
Wanda was slumped against one crate, facing Stark.  Clint was sprawled to their left.
Tony was standing in the middle of his demolished shop, gazing down lovingly at Steve; Steve was kneeling in front of his, one cheek against Tony's leg, hands behind his back while Tony carded his hair with his fingers.
The man shined the flashlight in Karpovs eyes.  He held up an arm to shield them.
All of the younger omegas looked shocked. Hal shrugged.
"Didja know Steve can hold his breath for like two and a half minutes?"
"All bad I hope," Stone smiled. "I heard you're intending to auction all these off? What a clever thing to do. Bet you can't wait to get rid of them."
"Okay," Steve said quietly and pulled away from the counterand consequently out of Tony's grasp. His conversation with the doctor had left him feeling strange and he didn't really know what to think. He also knew that Tony probably drank himself to sleep last night. He sighed. It wasn't like the anniversary was tomorrow. Steve had ten more days of this.
. You can't-- you can't leave a guy hangin'."
"Coop, put a shirt on!" called Natasha.
"Too bad.  I'm telling you that you're a boy, and an omega."
"I'm sure that you, Captain, can appreciate a good deal when you see one.  I understand you're probably not yet willing to negotiate. Yet you've already made some demands of us.  So let me give you a counter-offer. Right now, you have nothing." The director gestured to Steve's cell.  "Cooperation will earn you rewards, such as food. Resistance will gain you nothing. The situation you find yourself in right now is not one in which you have any power, so frankly, it's rather generous of us to offer you incentives at all.  But we'd prefer this process to be easy. And, even luckier for you, there's very little we plan to ask of you, other than to fulfill your natural role."
redhead?"
"I'm just cleaning up!" she called back, sounding tetchy as she was washing the blood from her hands.
? That was one of the first times Pepper had been rendered speechless.  And how did you console someone about being tortured for three months, anyway?
"...who?" asked her friend
Tony scoffed.  "But I don't want to-- damn it.  I'm sorry, Steve.  I love you. You're my omega
A sudden memory.  Steve's sketchbook, the one he'd flipped through back in Steve's apartment.  There had been lots of pictures, doodles, cartoons, everything from landscapes to people. He'd seen himself in there quite a lot.  But he'd also seen Bucky.
Tony disagreed but he thought it would be rude to say so in front of Steve, who was still grinning like a loon over the pictures.
More HYDRA agents appeared just as the three SHIELD agents rolled onto the ground, tearing toward the curb and tumbling into Kate's car, or maybe Fury's, or maybe just SHIELD's.  Steve didn't know, or care.  Kate chucked a pair of keys to Fury; Fury chucked a handgun at Steve as he started the engine and slammed on the gas. Steve closed one eye and focused, pushing away the pain before he fired, aiming out the window.
"Wanda, this is the Winter Soldier."
Every monitor hooked up to Steve went haywire, beeps and trills and alarms sounding; Steve's body spasmed and, half-asleep, Steve reached up and began ripping wires off himself.  Tony slammed against the window (
Tony's mouth twitched at the way Steve rolled his head into Tony's caress.
Steve rolled out of the way as the metal body landed heavily, dropping the heart/arc reactor with a displeased sound. He crawled away a good few inches for safety.
He was searching for an excuse to leave when suddenly another man showed up, trailed by two excited-looking women in collars.
Well, that was that.  Tony had done all he could.  Now he just had to wait for Steve to return.  He wasn't sure how to feel about it.
which might help."
His hands shook as he cupped a match flame and lit a cigarette.  He offered the blond one, and he took it; Buck lit it for him.
Tony lapsed into silence.  Obadiah had died two years ago and the circumstances had not been pleasant.  Tony often found himself wondering about it, late at night, when he'd been drinking.  Obadiah had attended his graduation, had taught him piano, had picked him up at the police station when he'd gotten his first DUI.  Obadiah had been a man with remarkable control of his emotions and how he expressed them; Tony never knew at what point Obadiah had stopped caring about him and begun loathing him.  Tony knew he was difficult, and couldn't help but feel he'd earned Obadiah's wrath; or maybe Obadiah had always secretly hated the boy that took over the company he'd worked so hard to build up, the boy who inherited it unwillingly and never bothered to take it especially seriously.
"Except now everyone thinks Steve had three Alphas," pointed out Pepper.
"...show me what you drew," he said quietly.  He didn't really care but he knew this was important to Steve.  If he was alone he would have liked to drink himself stupid but he wasn't alone anymore and probably never would be again.  "Can you put a shot in this?  Please?  I need it, Steve.  ...please."
"I like it when you pin me down," Steve whispered hotly in agreement and then he sank back down under the water.
He reached up to his chest and grabbed the arc reactor.  He twisted and pulled; the metal scraped; the device was heavy and warm in his hands.
.  And Tony would never get to have him because he was dying.  His neck was so stiff he couldn't see straight.  His chest was on fire.  The alcohol helped numb it but what was the use in numbing it?  His blood toxicity was up to the eighties... this was his very last birthday alive and he'd somehow managed to piss off one of the only people in the world he gave a shit about... and, realistically, Steve probably didn't care about him...
"You do know alcohol and caffeine are like the two worsts thing you can combine, right?" Steve said with an almost fond sigh.
When Steve arrived at the hospital it was chaotic. Of course, Boswell was getting the best treatment possible so he found them all in a private room. Danielle was already there, holding a coffee and looking exhausted. Donner looked surprisingly awake, but his pregnancy had really messed his sleep cycle up at that point. And Banksy looked...well, dreadful. Wordlessly, Steve pulled him into a hug as Banksy stepped towards him.
His heart was still hammering away in his chest and Steve's reassuring words certainly weren't working on himself. The notion of drinking ethanol was getting more and more tempting by the minute.
"He'll fuck you and chuck you, you know."
Steve tried to a smile. "I know what song I'm going to sing," he said and then he dipped back under and out of Tony's touch.
Tony reminded himself.
"Pepper.  He thinks... he thinks the guy that tried to kill him, the HYDRA guy, the one that caused this... he thinks it's his old mate.  Bucky."
Pietro snorted a little.  He wasn't bonded and hoped he never would be.  "Listen. There's an infiltration. They're on level 2.  Wanda and I... we're going to take care of it." He looked at Steve, almost sadly.  "From one rabbit to another, I'm sorry, Steve Rogers. But I made a promise to my sister and to my dead parents and to my country that I would do anything necessary to hold accountable the man that has made them suffer.  Now I have my chance, and you... you're no longer needed. So take your own advice and run, before they can use you. HYDRA doesn't think of us as people. Right now, stairwell 4 is empty, so you can take that to get out if you hurry.  ...James, it was a pleasure to get to know you. You've been a good friend, even if your memory is terrible."
He wasn't being asked to speak-- he was only to speak when asked and he'd already gotten everyone in enough trouble by asking questions out of turn-- so he got up silently to follow.
Tony considered.  "Three, four times in the last two years.  ...also occasionally E."
Phil pulled a face of disbelief.
"Thank you, Harry," said Pepper, reaching out to touch his arm.
Steve woke up suddenly in the middle of the night feeling distantly aroused. Tony was dead asleep next to him, the sedatives having done their job. He would no doubt be out for another hour or two. He rubbed a hand over his face, and then he heard it.  The voice was distant, like an echo--
And you had to wonder, too, if Steve would have ever ended up as close to him as they were now if he'd never gone into heat.  What if Steve's sudden openness toward Tony wasn't genuine, but a result of his body's hormones?  Forcing them into intimacy, when Tony was only really a job to Steve?  Steve's confrontation with Fury, though, implied that Steve bore no loyalty to SHIELD, however.  His loyalties were his own.  What they were, Tony had no idea, but he no longer thought of Steve as working for anyone but Steve.
"Why didn't you tell me?" repeated Tony plaintively.  In the photo album, open on Steve's lap, a cheery-looking Tony was sitting on the lap of his nanny, hugging a Captain America action figure.  The action figure was second only to Bunny. In every photo of Tony before the age of five, he was clutching the rabbit, and more often than not, an ear was in his mouth.  In another photo, Tony was celebrating his fifth birthday-- no, fourth, there was no Howard there, which meant it must have been 1974, he must be at the Expo-- and, oh
"...Sure. Whatever you like. I'm still learning."
"Gideon Malick sent them," Steve said. "He probably thinks it's funny. When's the conference?"
"No, no, I like it!" protested Tony quickly.  "It's very... yellow. It's just that I'm... I'm not really a sweater guy.  ...aw, dammit, Donner, don't do the emotional pregnant thing on me..." A tear slipped down Donner's face and Tony groaned.  "...I'll go put on the sweater," he grumbled unhappily, going upstairs to go get it.
"Happy's here to drive you back. We can stay," Pepper offered, totally mesmerised by the baby herself.
"He's just being checked out by medics. It's procedure. Don't worry," Steve said. He gave the headmaster a sarcastic little wave as he saw him being taken into a police car, still spluttering and swearing.  "Do you want me to put you on the phone with him? We could try and call later."
"Tony.  You guys are still bonded.  You can still feel him. You still--"
Steve inclined his head. "I'm sure he did it on his own merit."
"Tony, stop, you're not supposed to move him--"
, you're not going anywhere. And you'll thank me for it tomorrow."
"We're gonna be home soon, Steve, just a couple of hours, okay?  You're gonna be find," murmured Tony, holding him. This, at least, was the one thing he
The lights flickered on just as Steve aimed a kick at the scientist's head.  Everyone blinked in the suddenly light; they'd gotten the generators up, and they were no longer working by the light of Tony's arc reactor.
Pepper gave Aria a nudge with her elbow and pointed quietly.  She assumed the two of them would be handling the media; it would be unfair to ask Steve to do so after such a traumatic experience.
"I don't even know where
"...Stark's sedated, too."
," Steve said, sounding frustrated again. "You need to keep up."
The omega was pulling the uniform off the largest of the guards and he realized that omega meant for them to get dressed.
"HOW DO YOU PEE IN THE SUIT?" yelled someone suddenly.  The crowd burst into laughter.  Tony laughed with them and pointed to the crowd.
Bucky.
A man stepped forward and Steve's vision just managed to focus on him. "How do you know it's him?" he asked, peering at Steve. Steve saw the HYDRA emblem on his uniform and bared his teeth.
he thought with surprising clarity.
"...depends what's coming, right?" Aria whispered.
"Take a drink with you, Steve!" said someone, shoving another one into Steve's hand.
"It depends on the omega," sad Eric with an expansive shrug.  "I hardly ever hit Piper. She's a good girl. Sometimes discipline is about withholding rewards instead of actual punishment, you know, skipping dinner or making them sleep on the floor instead on in your bed.  ...not that Frond's all about discipline," he added quickly, because Tony had a look of disgust on his face. "You have to balance it with rewards. ...I think Frond would be particularly interested in your... unique... well... he's... you know," said Eric, fumbling a bit.
.  Have you read
He stared at the picture, wondering how things could have been if they hadn't gone out that night.  Or if the weather had been better. Or if his father had, for once, not had anything to drink.
Steve ignored their bickering in turn of giving attention to the baby. She was adorable and the way she gripped his thumb like a vice made Steve's heart melt. Aria grinned at him. "What?" he asked, looking up and meeting her eyes.
"JARVIS," he called.  "I need you to start compiling every known substance that could act as an antidote to hallucinogens.  Anything that mutes the effects of LSD, salvia, peyote, any of it.  I have a test to cheat.
The scientists shoved several tubes and syringes through the little slot of the door.
"...there's a guy named Richard here who mentioned you."
"...I don't argue with my mate 'cause we're bonded and I love him," said DeSoto patiently, as if Steve were a moron.  "I do it
"What happened to your neck?"
It was late afternoon by the time they made it back inside the house, Lucky greeting them excitedly and licking the snow off their boots. Laura sent Steve up to go have a shower and had Clint fetch his clothes to shove in the dryer whilst he did so; after all, there was nothing else he could change into. If Steve put on a set of Clint's clothes, he would ruin them.
"We have a fun idea!" one of the photographers announced and rushed forward with a makeup palette. "Picture this, okay?
Tony looked down.  "...that happened to you?  What...?  How?
! his brain thought with a twisted sense of humor) and slithered to the floor with a half-growl, half-whine.
He might not forgive him.
"Y'know how omegas have scent glands behind their ears?  Is that... is that like a... pressure point type deal?" asked Tony.
Steve turned around to see a very horrified-looking Happy waiting for him on the tarmac. He looked Steve up and down, his eyes wide.
Steve woke up early and showered before dressing in gym gear, stuff he could get sweaty in. Knee-length shorts and a tee, along with trainers. He cooked waffles for himself and left some on a plate for Tony before he headed out.  He didn't bother waking his Alpha.  He could think of nothing he wanted to hear from him.
Suddenly he was thinking about how Richard had said leaving the knot in increased the chances of pregnancy, and he was panicked.  He wiggled his hips, hoping to slide out, but it was absolutely impossible.
"Gaaad," sighed Tony,  both hands gripping Steve's hair, holding his mouth down over his cock.  "God, Steve, you suck cock so good..." He gave a shuddery sigh. "We're nearly through it," he added, more for his own benefit than Steve's.
Steve walked over to see the bracelets in Tony's hands. Whether they worked or not, they certainly looked pretty. It felt like a very Pepper present. For his birthday last year, Pepper had bought him some meditation stones to help him relax. Steve had admittedly never used him but he'd appreciated the sentiment.
"  (Steve could hear Clint whining in the background.)  (He'd witnessed Phil once before in pre-heat and it was not a pretty sight.  Phil was a nester; he'd torn apart an entire room.) "--to get pregnant. Also we have the data that was on that computer, it looks like they already recreated the serum but it didn't work.  They had five Alphas go feral, no word on what happened to them but I think we can guess. There's none left, thank God. Also--
"Nothing," said Tony innocently.
"No.  The other one.  Howard," he said.  He studied the picture closely.  Howard was dressed weird.  A suit, yes.  But the style was strange and unfamiliar.  And he'd only had a mustache before, not a beard.  But it was definitely him.
"You know there's no such thing as an
His heat had lasted only four days and left him feeling wrung out.  He was not one to shirk work; he came in despite still being in post-heat and feeling as weak as a kitten.
Fortunately the discussion was interrupted by the arrival of Agent Mackenzie.  He was tall, dark-skinned and broad-shouldered. "Who's lovin' it?" he asked, holding up a couple of large McDonald's bags.  "I got everyone breakfast... figured we'd need the caffeine... how are the love birds?" He surveyed the room. "Uh-oh. What's wrong?"
He froze as piano music filled the room.  "I... I know this," he said uncertainly.
"Why does Steve care if I care?" replied Tony furiously.  "It's not like I was proposing a fuckin' triad! Steve's been acting weird ever since--"  Tony didn't bother to finish.
The girl held up her hands.
"...and then I said, to hell with playing it safe, I'm already dying, let's see what this bad boy can do, and so I put it in my chest and,
"Tony, I've got a target lock," he warned as a small, red crosshairs appeared on his HUD inside the helmet.  It bounced around, keeping its target in the center with shocking precision.
Tiberius shook his head but offered a polite smile in return. "I'm sure you can understand how busy new year can be; if I might just have a word with Steve before I head off?"
Steve stood and felt spent run down the inside of his thigh. He shivered. No longer a virgin, he reminded himself. Steve ran a hand over his face and then blindly searched for his phone.
Karpov strode over and gestured for the soldier; he came over and knelt by the slot in the door.  Karpov reached through and ran his hand over Bucky's cheek, tenderly, looking down at him. Bucky closed his eyes and leaned into the touch.
It had been less than a year since the fight at Stark Expo with Justin, which had resulted in civilian casualties, and less than a year since Tony's disastrous birthday party.  Both instances highlighted the danger and power of Tony's "toys," and since then, nearly everything Tony had done had demonstrated, at least to the general public, that he was unstable and unpredictable.
Steve almost reached out to Tony, resisting the urge to lean down and steal a second kiss. He felt an odd sense that he should... wait. He would wait to be prompted before he did anything. And it would often go that way when they were in bed together. It went without saying that because of his 'omega instincts' Steve liked being 'good' and doing what he was told. Whilst, in real life such a concept was demeaning, in the bedroom it didn't have to be. Steve could just enjoy himself and not worry about how he came off to anyone but Tony.
The funny thing was, though, that Tony's black depressions were often easy to deal with when they only lasted a day.  Tony was inclined to simply sleep them off. It was the long-term lack of food and reliance on alcohol that was dangerous.  But for one or two days, they weren't so bad. Certainly rough, emotionally, but not life-threatening by any stretch of the imagination.
Steve surfaced just before his lungs began to burn in protest.  His eyes were the same blue as the water, beads of liquid clinging to the ends of his blond hair.  Tony eyeballed him.  He could be an Abercrombie model, the way he looked in water.
Donner slouched a little in his seat.  He had insisted that the baby was Gideon's, though there was no proof as of yet.  For the first five months, the baby had tentatively been named "Gideon Jr." (Although Donner had once said, "Or Ladybug, if it's an omega.")  That idea had long since evaporated. But even if Donner no long spoke fondly of Gideon, he never said a word against him, either. Perhaps the closest he'd ever come was on the base, when he had made eye contact and said no.
, I'm tellin' you!"
"Fuck," whispered Steve when he felt Bucky's arousal beneath his hand. It was something forbidden, something he'd always longed for... and definitely bigger than he'd ever taken, considering both Tony and instruments before.
"You were in hospital? Were you sick?!" Cooper asked, eyes going wide.
thought Tony.
, but that just didn't seem right.  He did want to take Steve.  He wanted to mate him.
"We should try and find out where they keep Trickshot," Steve whispered. He spotted Lawrence walking past.
"Move your foot," demanded Tony, attempting to close the door again.  Pepper winced but refused to budge.
Tony snorted.  "Wait a second.
"Where's Steve?"
When Steve turned back around he was shocked at what he saw. His eyes went wide when he saw Bucky crying. A lump swelled in his throat. "Bucky. It's okay," Steve whispered and moved to cup Bucky's cheeks, brushing away his tears with the pads of his thumbs.
Instead, he smiles.
“Alright,” Tony hears himself say, and Steve seems surprised, but he doesn’t speak anymore.
What if the universe, in all its inhumanity, has granted them only those three days at the compound, only that single night of peace? What if that’s everything they’re ever gonna get? What if Steve wouldn’t deserve anything more even if he could get it?
Tony slips his boxers on, and looks at Steve while he draws in a sigh that could be relief just as well as disappointment. His eyes dart to Tony’s bruised hip, but then he catches himself and quickly looks up, at Tony’s face, but not his eyes.
“Yeah. Nat told me a couple of months after SHIELD fell. I offered to help looking for him, but she said you guys had it covered.”
“I don’t mean like a couple. Not necessarily,” Steve says, and he tries again to talk as quietly as he can. “If we were friends, if we cared about each other and respected each other, we could discuss things and even disagree without ending up in a fight. And when I say fight, I mean strictly verbal. Other kinds are off the table on principle.”
They’re over me immediately. They push my face into my own sick. Kick my ribs, my back, my stomach. Break my fingers with the heels of their boots.
“Payback’s a bitch,” Steve says, smug.
“Come on, none of that. Help me up, instead,” Tony says, and Steve does. Tony sits on the bed, on Steve’s side.
“What is this, couples therapy with the king? It’d make a great reality show.”
Steve seems to suddenly remember something, walks back inside and takes something out of his pocket. He places the drawing on the coffee table in front of Tony.
driving himself completely crazy wondering if Tony actually hated him now, if this whole thing between them had ended that night, with that mistake), and they make it to Tony’s bed by some miracle. It’s just after lunch when Steve goes up to the penthouse to tell Tony that Kamala texted saying she’s coming for dinner with her physics homework (“Urgh, her teacher is an incompetent and questions my methods.” “Most people are incompetent compared to you when it’s about physics, Mr. Big Brain.”) but at some point the conversation turns into Tony shoving his hand down Steve’s pants, which, okay, okay.
His phone buzzes.
Steve’s panicked expression always puts Tony into a sort of damage control mode, so he’s glad he could minimize the issue. Steve’s body runs on a different wavelength than basically everyone else’s; he was made to be strong and durable, and his sexual prowess comes with the serum package. But the point is that Tony doesn’t want Steve to feel embarrassed about it, about who he is. Tony isn’t, so there’s no reason for Steve to be.
A brief, minuscule intake of breath from T'Challa. He’s surprised Tony knows the words, or maybe he’s just appalled at Tony’s pronunciation.
“Yeah. Peggy would bring her along when she came to visit Dad. Or me and Jarvis, after Dad...”
But the fact remains: this thing, as crazy as it sounded at the beginning, as absurd as it has been, it actually
He takes Tony’s hand in his own and holds it for a while. It’s so much smaller than Steve’s. Rougher, darker.
“I got rid of the whole thing as soon as I realized what was happening, safely, of course, but the damage was done. I think I can reverse the process but I didn’t exactly have time for it and I was working on my armor and it wasn’t really… a priority.”
Tony puts the first aid kit back under the sink and washes his hands.
I often think about the past, Stella, and I see roads I didn't travel, occasions I didn't seize, things I didn't do. How would Tony be today if his mother hadn't been a coward? If we had come to the airport with you, that day of so many years ago?
But it hadn’t.
What happens next feels like a bucket of ice water. Tony gasps, like he’s being choked, pulls out of Steve suddenly, without controlling his movements (and,
“What? When?”
Steve releases Tony’s wrists, props himself up with one hand splayed between Tony’s shoulder blades. It doesn’t hurt, but Tony can’t move more than what’s strictly necessary to breathe.
“Wait!” she interrupts Tony, “I think I have some frozen. I’ll give it to you guys; you can make pasta tomorrow.”
“You boys take a shower, freshen up. There are towels in the bathroom. I’ll be downstairs. Take your time; there’s no rush.”
Tony tosses the StarkPad on the couch, and stumbles to the bathroom to wash the tears away from his face.
“I killed you. And then I was gonna die, too.”
I can fuck you six times in a row, are you serious? This is bullsh—”
For a minute—but it could be an hour, a day, a year—the most baseline elements of their biology are amplified by the social stereotypes ingrained in them. Steve’s guilt slides away to reveal bitterness, because he could never get his Omega to forgive him, could never get him back, and what kind of Alpha can’t discipline his Omega into submission? Tony’s betrayed trust becomes doubt; it becomes shame and self-loathing at having rejected his Alpha for so long, because what kind of Omega doesn’t want to please their Alpha?
There are a few, interminable minutes of stillness. Steve’s been quietly catching his breath, lying on top of Tony, crushing him onto the bed.
He can’t breathe. He keeps trying, but there’s no air, it’s so cold and there’s no air, and the pain in his chest is so sharp and just please,
Steve pulls back from Tony then, lies down staring up at the ceiling.
There was a loud click.
Pepper actually stopped ranting, clearly surprised.  "It's-- it's an Alpha rights group. Like, the biggest one in the world.  How do you not know that?"
He'd been alternating running and weights since six AM and showed no signs of slowing.  Steve really needed to get back into a proper training routine. Fitness was key and serum didn't do all the work for him; he'd lost enough muscle as Tony's PA as it was.
"Of course Captain."
"Granite."
The boy held up one of the notebooks.  "It must have been bad. Because of what you let them do to you."
"Wait, really?"
"Was it like... like a World War II thing?" asked Tony tenatively.
"It's fine, Miss Potts.  ...I'll go make Steve some iced tea."  Tiberius got up and left for the kitchen.
"Aw, shit, man!" said Tectonic; Tony's nose was bleeding again.
Before Tony could reply, Senator Ross was grabbing him and peeling him away from Steve.  "Tony!  Great to see you.  Mind if I pick that brain of yours about Project 42?"
"Er, Steve.
He ran his hands down Tony's chest and braced them there. Not letting him press close enough to get between his legs. Steve was heady with hormones but he was conscious enough not to want to do this in front of Phil.
He and Happy flung open their doors at the same time and Tony dragged Steve out of the car after him.  The effect of Tony's appearance was immediate; the crowd swamped him with shrieks of excitement, asking for autographs, chanting about Iron Man, shoving microphones in his face; Tony was laughing, waving, jostling good-naturedly into the crowd as Happy shoulders away the worst of it, and Steve suddenly understood the sunglasses; a lot of cameras were going off.
"No, they don't-- they don't make salmon-flavored yogurt, James."
Tony stared at the plate of food with a look of disgust.  He wasn't hungry. Or rather, he was, but not for food. He picked listlessly at the sandwich without actually eating any of it, sipped the water, and went back to nosing Steve's neck, taking comfort in his smell.
"Then why did you lie?"
It was Steve who swore when Tony pushed into him with little warning. "F-Fuck-" He was hot and big inside of him and when his knot squeezed inside Steve felt breathless. He felt like a skinny guy with all the air knocked out of him by just a simple flight of stairs. His mind couldn't almost comprehend it. Tony's member was pulsing inside of him, thick and demanding in its presence- so much so it was hard for Steve to even comprehend.
such a disgusting misuse of my soldier.  This is why the world is in such a state of disgrace, people like you who think with their dicks instead of their minds!  Fuck you, Yaroslav!"
She handed them over and Steve spotted a lot of the food they'd eaten earlier at the hotel. Fish and chips, pie... the one thing he struggled with was British portion sizes. He was aware America had some kind of obesity crisis, but Steve
"Do... do you think we could make it up onto the sofa or we're stuck here on the floor for half an hour?" Steve asked, eyes half drooping shut.
"Tony.  You can't reduce your emotions to math.  You're not a robot. Doing what you're doing doesn't change the past.  You can't ever change the past. You can only learn to come to terms with it, and to do that, you need to face it head-on."  Pepper reached down and tilted Tony's head up to look at her. "...Tony? Do you think Steve’s heat maybe brought up some issues you never quite handled before?”
Tony winced, hard, when he saw a couple of familiar figures striding toward them.  A beta woman, a beta man, and an Alpha. Councilwoman Hawley, Councilman Yin, and Councilman Malick.
"Yeah, well, you know me, Mr. Accountability," said Tony.  "I'm lucky they sent me Steve 'cause otherwise I would've been toast in Monaco."
"Yep," Steve practically squeaked out.
"Are...are you with him?"
Bucky stared into those bright blue eyes, only half-understanding.
Bucky couldn't remember ever asking for anything other than orders, or necessities.  This wasn't a need but a
Aria was strange in person. Or rather, not what Steve expected. They had only talked on the phone before.  She was a short but feisty beta, strangely intimidating in her leather jacket and Converse sneakers. Her blue eyeliner was a little off,  but still looked good. He was surprised Pepper had recommended someone so young but then Aria was still two years older than him.  She tucked a black strand of hair behind her ear as she scrolled through e-mails with another. "They got you the same interviewer. Should be fun. You've got this."
"He really does look
"Since when did people use orchids to send threats?  That's fucked up," said Tony, paranoia bubbling up inside of him.  He wanted to tackle Steve to the ground and lay on top of him until the threat had passed, except the threat was only a vague sentence written on a small slip of paper and wasn't anything tangible he could actually bare his teeth at.
It turned out Steve liked it hard. He whimpered as Tony licked into his mouth and sighed as he squeezed at his waist tightly, leaving bruises that would only last a few hours but they would be there. Then he moved his hips again, snapping them down firmly and moaned, loving the feeling.
James slid another pancake off of the skillet and onto a plate.
Dr. Gleason ignored Tony and looked pointedly at Steve.  "Do you have any concerns or questions?  Everything looks and feels healthy.  You should avoid sex for a few days, but I expect your next heat will be normal.  There's no lasting damage at all.  If you decide to be a mother, or a father, in the future, I don't foresee any trouble."
Carter smacked his hand.  "Knock it off.  You need that, trust me.  You nearly lost your spleen.  If Cap hadn't gotten you here as fast as he had, you'd be a goner."
https://goo.gl/forms/owng8a7o44TBOFlv2
"Whoa, whoa whoa whoa whoa," said Rumlow.  He took Steve's hand and gently unpried his fingers from the door.  "Don't touch the door; we don't want you tumbling out by accident. Listen to my voice, Steve.  I already told you, the drive is only forty minutes, okay? You can grab my shirt if you need to grab something.  We're on the Pacific Coast Highway and we'd headed north, okay? We're headed to Ventura, there's a base there. They already know we're coming and they're going to get Tony to come pick you up.  ...you don't need to feel embarrassed, Steve, we understand that this is a normal part of your biology and no one here is going to think less of you for it. You know SHIELD has lots of omega agents.  It's okay to relax."
"I'm serious, Mr. Stark."
"Heats are very disorienting. Things can easily happen in them that people regre--"
Tony and Happy were talking, too quiet for him to really hear. Happy offered him a reassuring smile as he headed up the steps to the jet door.  He'd been on his jet before - it was the same one that took them to Monaco. It felt strange to be back in the same place, but as different people. Steve felt an instinctive pull towards the tablet on the desk, like he should check emails or something.
Tony blinked.  "...did you... did you used to go sledding on trash can lids?" he asked uncertainly.  Right when he thought he was going to get used to being bonded, it surprised him like this.  "Gross," he added. Trash can lids, fuckin' Edison, seriously?
He didn't want to leave immediately or even reveal his real name immediately; if Chantelle and Tom were hanging around the lobby or had decided to grab a drink at the hotel bar, and saw them trying to leave, they'd be in big trouble.  He didn't plan to make a break for it until after midnight. He was hoping to spend that time talking with Donner, but it was like pulling teeth to get words out of him; Donner perched on the edge of the bed, eyes down, sipping water, everything about him radiating uncertainty.  It was sad. Rhodey wasn't sure how to delicately inform Donner that this was a rescue mission with Steve at the head of it, especially since Donner didn't seem overly fond of Steve.
"Can't you feel him?" she asked.  Charlie wasn't bonded.  She looked over at Tony, chewing her sandwich contemplatively, shading her eyes from the sun with one hand.
Tony leaned to look over Steve's shoulder.
Onscreen, one of the hapless characters was descending into the cellar.
He grinned.  "The war's over!  We
He followed Steve toward the kitchen; Steve slammed open the stainless steel doors and a woman holding a pan of hashbrowns shrieked and dropped it, spilling potatoes everywhere.
They nearly killed two people.  A lone lighting technician, and Jack the omega, who was cowering against the wall.
"Tony!" Pepper cried out in distress as the two men wrestled together on the floor of the plane. Pepper would have stepped in if she thought she could of done anything. But right now she would just make things worse.
Were they?  Tony had no way of knowing.  He'd never done this before and Steve... poor Steve had only ever had, what, one or two full heats, ones that he'd suffered through by himself.  Tony remembered suddenly how he'd laughed at Steve's description of himself "suffering" through a heat, back in May. Tony had remembered thinking that spending a few days doing nothing but jacking off sounded great.  Now he realized what Steve meant.
He pulled but it was locked, which wasn't really surprising.
"Go say hi," said Tom gently, giving Donner an encouraging push.
"Great!  We'll end on a note of familiarity for Steve," said Tony.
Steve's nails dug into the wood of the door. JARVIS said something but he didn't hear it. All Steve was aware of was the slipperiness between his thighs and the longing ache in his chest which made him feel almost sick. He felt wrong. Incomplete. He needed... something. Someone. Steve's nails began to cut into the wood, maybe it hurt. He frowned. He wasn't sure. He couldn't feel it and he didn't much care if it did.
"Yeah, except he's
Tony snorted little at the idea of Clint as a mascot.  "Clint's a spy or something. He works as an agent for the Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement, and Logistics Division.  And Steve
He pulled his shirt over his head and stretched, trying to get the kinks of out his muscles.
The doctor opened his case, pulled on gloves, and then slowly peeled away the bandage. The gauze against the wound was wet and tinged yellow from leaked serum. Gleason threw it into a plastic bag which would later go into the trash and then fetched wipes from his case to clean around the wound. "So, you were shot a few days ago...?" he guessed.
The food was gone in just about under fives minutes. It seemed not even getting shot could quell Steve's massive appetite. He sipped at the orange juice a little slower, however. He thought about what Tony was saying, thinking he could figure out what a 'soundbite' was in his head without having to ask (Steve was kind of sick about having to ask about things. Clint told him to just google stuff more, maybe he should.)
"I've chosen a psychologist. Doctor Lucy Jones," Steve said. "I'll be seeing her on Thursdays."
And with that Gleason left.
Steve had only barely slammed the door behind him before he had Phil on the phone.  "Steve? Er, what is it? Is it about that girl's sister--"
"No, about Captain America."
More bullets scattered in through the window. They had to get out before it was too late. Steve didn't want to die today, but he'd rather that than go with HYDRA.
She shooed them out one by one; Tony lolled his head back on the couch, taking deep, steadying breaths.
"I swear, I had nothing to do with this for once. Ivan Vanko was working with Justin Hammer. I was just here to schmooze." Tony said frantically.  "Steve is at Northwell Hospital, I gotta get to Northwell; he's all broken up. Vanko threw him against a wall-"
!  What do you mean, you don't take walk-ups?" demanded Tony, putting his forearms on the drive-through window and glaring.
"I'm sorry," said Tony.  "I'm sorry about what I said, earlier, about you being uppity.  I was angry.  It was... kind of a dick thing to say.  I should have gone after you.  I wanted to, but you were with...
Steve sighed as he felt Tony lean into him and arms curled around his waist. Steve curled his arms around the other's shoulders on instinct, his brain not quite catching up with his body. It was so easy to lean into his touch. Tony was addictive. Tony was
"I mean, there was that sexy Captain America omega act with the USO, but--"
He entered the kitchen and instantly felt both women were judging him. There was a beat of silence. "We have to leave soon," Aria said simply, her eyes narrowing. Steve swallowed, not breaking under her gaze (although he had come close before.)
"These Alphas have money. And the means to provide for us," Twelve said smoothly. "And what's to say we won't get someone kind? We don't have to stay with them."
Rhodes shook his head, smiling.  He hadn't bonded, himself, and didn't really expect to because of his career.  But if he'd ever been asked, he would have thought that he would bond before Tony would.  Tony had always said bonding was stupid and out-dated and for weak-minded fools.  Maybe he was just quoting Obadiah, who said the same thing.  But he'd never shown the slightest bit of interest in even hanging out around omegas, and now, he seemed laser-focused on Steve.  It was cute in a very slightly unsettling way.
Neither Tony nor Steve responded.
His nails made Steve's back arch up as thin pink lines were left in their wake, the curve of his neck pretty as he curved into the sensation. He panted, knowing he was close himself. Steve cried out as Tony buried inside of him with a sense of finality, his alpha's fingers digging into the meat of his ass as he filled him with his seed. A warmth followed. Then Tony's cock pulsed and twitched inside of him as more come spilled out into him and Steve couldn't take it. He almost felt too full, if that were possible.
The man muttered Russian above him.  He didn't understand it. There was a light source like 'Steve's' in the metal beast's chests. The metal skin he wore gleamed in the blue light.
She wrinkled her nose in disgust at him.  "Being statused doesn't mean you're allowed to sexually harass people, you know," she said coldly.
The thought made Steve feel sick. But he didn't have the time to worry about Tony right now. It was about time he did something for himself.
Natasha's frown deepened.  "Steve-"
you."
"Tony?" Natasha sighed. "Do you have any pregnancy tests in the house?"
"Wow, that's great, Justin, really, we could always use some comic relief... Stan, does Justin have a slot? Can you fit him in?"
"What is
Steve had a newfound level of admiration for Tony. Something swelled in his chest. He ached for the pain his Alpha had been through but was still enamoured by how strongly he'd pushed through it and beyond. Tony didn't complain or wallow in self-pity. He got on with it. He fought back. Steve loved that about him.
"What about the staff?"
"I'm only betting cash," said Tony firmly, but he felt annoyed at the idea of anyone winning Donner just because Donner looked like Steve.  ...maybe it wouldn't hurt just to get into one omega round, to win Donner. He didn't even want him; he just didn't want anyone else to have him.  That wasn't too much to ask, right? Steve wouldn't even have to know.

Tony put his hand into Steve's a gave him a little tug toward Happy.  Even with Tony's total lack of social graces, he understood this was a private moment.  He even waited until they were in the car to say, "Since when was Clint
Before Steve could respond with more protests, Fury and Coulson were stepping into the room.
"...I wish that too," he whispered back conspiratorially.  He wasn't used to having opinions or desires, but he knew that he liked his omega and he wanted him.  He wanted to smell his neck again. He gave his fingers a little squeeze through the slot in the door, staring back into his eyes, enjoying this.
Steve was grinning in front of the mirror, clearly thoroughly amused by JAVRIS's analysis.
, wow."  Words soon died on his lips as Tony continued his ministrations, making him moan. Was this what it felt like for Tony? Was Steve this good? Did it really feel this good?
Tony opened the door of the SUV and tumbled out.
Steve lifted his head up a fraction. "If HYDRA's so intimidated by me why haven't they just shot me already?"
Tony went into the closet to grab jeans and a t-shirt.  Steve, with his incredible chest, made most t-shirts look incredible.  Tony didn't have that particular ability, plus his arc reactor was prominent, so he tugging on a clean sweatshirt over his tee.  It was grey with a Stark Industries logo; Tony had a lot of branded products lying around the house.
"Justin," replied Tony.
whenever he thought about it, and Tony touching him there certainly didn't help.
He reached for Steve's hand, and Steve took it, and the two exchange a gooey-eyed look of pure love.  Or at least, lust.
Tony spat on the floor, pushing Steve away.  "It's--
"Thanks, Pip, you're the best," said Eric, forking over the stack.  Piper turned her attention to flipping through the cards and a moment later-- yes, yes,
He'd felt a little odd ever since Steve had said he wouldn't be Tony's omega on the battlefield.  The fuck did that mean?  Tony had mated him, fair and square.  Steve was his omega at all times, wasn't he?  Even though Tony hadn't initially wanted an omega, now that he found himself with one, he had a certain set of expectations.  And Steve was breaking all those, and then some.
A vulnerable part of him.  Tony's heart pounded a little harder, remembering, with sudden clarity, Vanko's phone call.  Alive.  How the hell could he be alive?  Tony had been notified that he'd died.  The frightening thing wasn't that he was alive, no.  It was that he was alive and capable of building arc reactors and suits that rivaled Tony's.  That sort of power was unyielding.  And Steve, for all the super-soldier strength and reflexes, was still a fleshy, organic human who could be easily hurt by a fusion-powered, weaponized prosthetic suit.  Between Vanko and the Winter Soldier, Tony was starting to wonder if his omega was cursed.
"...go get a sandwich for me or something, will you?  Something light... grilled chicken, I dunno," said Tony, pulling out his wallet and stuffing his credit card into DeSoto's hand.  That would get rid of him for a while.
Steve paused. Of course the Alpha kept it-- or maybe self-righteous Kitty wasn't the only exception to that rule. He hoped she wasn't.
"He has his instructions.  But if he fails his objective then it's fine.  We'll still have learned something."
"More or less than you?" demanded Tony.  He considered Natasha to be an eight. It was a rude question but Tony had needed an answer, and Natasha, also an Alpha, could appreciate Tony's concerns.
"...we don't really like that term," said Sam.
Tony reached up to pull his shirt up, tossing it aside, pulling back the sheets.  His bed was at least twice the size of Steve's, and the sheets were imported silk.  He was looking forward to probably ruining them.
, all the jealousy and the pain of every time Bucky went off with some other girl and just simply ignored him...Steve couldn't deal with that reality in his head. That Bucky would feel that and wouldn't care and didn't do anything about it.
It occurred to Tony that neither he nor Steve had any real idea how to manage money.  Tony had always been too rich to bother, and Steve, too poor. No doubt Pepper was going to have a lot of angry questions for them tomorrow.  Hopefully, Steve's apology and fundraiser would help distract her.
Tony frowned, his brain backpedaling.  Everything
Steve turned to Tony. "Yeah.  Let's leave.  But only on the condition that you let me carry you out so it doesn't get worse."
"Hello, sir," said JARVIS pleasantly, unaware of what had transpired during the last few minutes.  He was bringing up everyone's stats, though, and Steve's were particularly interesting. His body temperature, always elevated, was elevated even more (39.3 C), along with his heart rate (115, which was high for Steve, whose resting heart rate was just under 40).  His blood pressure was up, too, and his breathing, and if Tony didn't know what was happening, he would have thought Steve had some sort of killer flu.
Tony, who had spent years giving soundbites and speeches, paced around giving Steve suggestions on his commencement speeches, things like "make sure you say the word
Bucky reached for his notebook and then strode toward the door.  He pulled it open, stepped outside, and slammed it behind him.
The legal team paraded back into the house to tackle the paperwork.  Tony went back to his cake, finishing it off before dumping the using plate on the pool deck and wandering inside to find Steve and let him know the situation was being taken care of.  Steve had been accosted by Aria earlier in the morning and was currently up to his neck in media dealings.
A pair of bright blue eyes, unchanged by the serum, stared at him through the tiny window at the bottom of the door.
Sam shot him a look of annoyance.  "...they're letting you off the hook because people do crazy things for their mates.  ...not that you've been acting like much of a mate to him, lately."
Tony couldn't control his smell and knew Steve could probably sense his nervousness, but he was trying to keep it under control by thinking all the non-threatening thoughts he could.  Tony's primary coping mechanism-- denial-- was in top gear.  He was grateful Steve was letting him getting a taste before SHIELD did.  If he had any Afghanistan flashbacks in front of Fury, he'd never live it down.
"It's easy to nix a program in peacetime," said Wisdom.  "Under the right circumstances, I have no doubt in my mind that they might call on Iron Man or Captain America again."
Steve sighed. "It's not your fault.  Do you guys need any help bringing stuff in?"
The house looked stark white compared to the surrounding landscape.  It was night but the house stood out, its warm glow creating a mellow mood.  "JARVIS, hook me up to the radio on that chopper so I can say hi," demanding Tony, wobbling in the air.  People underappreciated the effort it took to remain steady. Lots of tiny adjustments. Made you real sympathetic toward hummingbirds.
He opened his mouth to speak then closed it again.
"Steve has a choice in everything he does and he makes it every time. He only stays with SHIELD because he
"I'll give some preliminary statements, if I can get a translator, neither of us speaks French very well," said Pepper.  Tony felt a surge of affection for all three of them for dealing with the aftermath.  His body was sore beyond all reason; he never wanted to move again.
Donner's head snapped up and for a split second his whole face lit up.  "
When Steve finally sank down onto Tony, he moaned in relief, rocking his hips forward a few times before be bottomed out with a whimper. "Tony--" he whispered, eyes slipping shut. He always felt good inside of Steve, but the heat brought with it a new sense of relief that was like no other.
Had he ever considered actually building their weapons?  Not really.  He would rather be a bitch than a traitor.  But years later, the words still stung.  Tony's dating had tapered off a lot after Afghanistan.  He missed women.  He missed not worrying about pregnancies.  His life was turning in a way that made him uncertain of the future, and Tony hated being uncertain.
Tony hadn't gotten the business card.  Fuck. He hadn't gotten a damn thing from Gene.  Fuck, fuck, fuck!
But he didn't blame Steve; how could he?  He'd seen the exhibit; everyone thought he was dead, and he'd known when he was shipped off that Steve might take a war Alpha.
"Careful, Stark," she warned.
Tony felt a tiny little chill, then dismissed it.  He was always worried about his mate; being pair-bonded meant he, as the Alpha, was constantly getting over-protective.
"--Rhodey, you're unbonded, you should be our plant!"
"Oh! One last thing."
Sometimes Donner wished he could be like Steve but he simply didn't know how. And right now it was about survival, about being
Patriotism didn't have the same charm that it used to. That was one thing Steve had found in the 21st century... America wasn't as golden as it was made out to be back in his day.
Be forewarned: this is a long chapter.  And not much happens... just pancakes and sex and some Bucktastic antics.
"I kind of like the thought of passive-aggressively turning up at all the mostly-Alpha restaurants we possibly can," Steve hummed. There was already a middle-aged Alpha across the room who was shooting him the occasional glare. A traditionalist, probably. No doubt he was broken-hearted to to find out Steve was, in fact, an O all a long.
"Great, fucking fantastic!  JARVIS!  JARVIS, can you break in?  Brute force it if necessary-"
"Yes," said Kitty, examining the case.  "...none of these are suede. But we can customize the collars however you like.  The lining is the easiest part to alter, actually. I've had mine changed three times already.  They all have lifetime service warranties."
Pepper patted her hand and led her to sit down.
," said Donner, sniggering.
There was a frantic but surprisingly quiet stampede for the door.
was okay and if
"I got us muffins," said Natasha, pushing one toward Sam and one toward Steve.
Pietro sighed, dragging a hand over his face.  "Please, just let me think of something. I don't want him to go back to that Karpov man.  You know if we leave he'll end up looking for him. And with his training, he'll probably find him."
"Put on a shirt, Tony," demanded Howard, barely glancing at him.
Steve had a dopey look of pride on his face and was clearly basking in breaking up the conference, but Tony was all too aware of the lynch mob that was rapidly forming.  Losing some of the auctionees was bad, and losing the wait staff was bad, too. But now, with Donner acting out...
"...glad one of us was paying attention," said Tony, forcing a smile.  "I'd better go get him before he gets into trouble, tries voting or something crazy.  ...take care of DeSoto, Ron, he's a sweet guy, seriously."
the sound was thick and low and vicious.
Tony paused.  He didn't move.  Steve asking him not to leave was like a spell.  He couldn't do it, not with Steve's blue eyes pleading with him.
"...I think I'll just asked my agent," Steve said with a soft chuckle, still unclear on who Ellen, Taylor, Cher, and others were. And then his expression softened. "But that stuff's all in the future. You have me all to yourself for the week," he assured him. He didn't voice it, but the thought of going on TV? That was scary. There was nowhere to hide.
, right? Or was this Steve...and was he someone else entirely? He swallowed thickly. He didn't reach out to shake 'Steve's' hand. He didn't trust him. He was stealing Steve's name...or something. He didn't know. But he had a strange sense that this man in front of him had
"...may I?" asked Tony, demonstratively.
While Pepper had offered to take Tony, Happy was left to wrangle Steve.  With some awkward coaxing, he helped Steve get dressed. He'd drunk almost all the water in his cabin over the space of the journey; Happy grabbed the last few water bottles before helping Steve to the car.  Steve was panting and sweating like he'd just eaten a hot pepper.
"I don't want to have sex with him," Steve said abruptly. "Not after what he just said."
"No dog!" Tony almost shouted.  His head and shoulders had disappeared into the interior of the suit; he pulled it out, even more grease on his face.  "Gimme that shield. Okay, this is great, watch this!" He plucked the shield from Steve, nearly dropping it, and then ran across the room.
Tony took a swing the moment that Rhodey was within range.  He was too drunk and had grossly over-estimated the punch; he actually staggered past Rhodey.  Rhodey took the opportunity to throw an arm around Tony's shoulders from behind.  "I said,
Tony was watching Pepper and Jeanette standing next to each other with a huge grin on his face.  They looked like sisters.
"...who the hell is there with you? You with someone? I thought you were moping?" Clint asked, both curious and confused. "Have you finally decided to get laid now that everyone knows how brave you are, huh?"
He went through Steve's medicine cabinet and his vinyl record collection, then his bookshelf, and found nothing of interest.  He vomited up the coffee he'd drank (unsurprising, considering his hangover).  He took a long, warm shower, singing to test the acoustics (they were decent) and leafed through one of Steve's sketchbooks.  He was surprised to see several drawings of himself, and concerned to see a few more of the man from the photograph on the refrigerator.
"'This really isn't the time'," Steve said, using the exact same voice the director has used before on the fire escape as he met his gaze briefly. There was a strange tangible sense of tenderness. The real meaning behind all of this, of course, wasn't Steve rebelling against him. It was him saying:
"Peggy said one of her favorite shows was thing called Blackadder; maybe we could watch that? I think it's supposed to be funny," Steve said and JARVIS piped up from overhead.
"You mean a double?" said the waiter, who was crossing out "triple."
?  I already told you, I don't wanna join your damn scout troop!"
Lila continued to hide her face, even more shy now that she was being addressed.
comment was pretty dangerous, but I think we're okay.  You earned 1.25 million for a Yemeni educational fund so that ought to soften the blow.  Overall, things look positive." Pepper liked checking on the media's impression of Steve more than Tony.  Tony had always been a controversial figure. After Steve's interview in January, people had
Steve set Trickshot down delicately; he looked nervous but also grateful.  Steve got the impression he wasn't fond of being carried.
"Yeah.  Like the reindeer," said Tony.  "And also you'll need to wear a wire."
"Hey, Rhodey!"
He didn't add that he couldn't stop tasting the gland's serum and that, holy shit, it was
"What does Bennett look like?" Steve asked, trying to focus on what was important here. DeSoto obviously didn't like answering his questions as much as Tony's, but he still did it.
Logic was telling him that he would only ruin his own home and make an ass of himself in front of everyone if he insisted on fighting Rhodes.
Tony couldn't think of any more to say.  He didn't want to type out words like "pregnant," or "miscarriage."  That would make it too real.  Right now, it was more of weird hypothetical.  And it was easily fixed.  Tony would get a real vasectomy from a legitimate doctor instead of some sketchy clinic in Tijuana and that would be that.
"Normally we wouldn't have to define said expectations so definitively but it's evident that Captain Rogers believes some forms of behaviour are appropriate when they are not."
