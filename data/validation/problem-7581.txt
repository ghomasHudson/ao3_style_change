We’ll talk more when you get back to New York. Mary says that will be sometime next week. [Redacted] will be looking forward to it. He wants a science play date. I’m sure we will be in the compound by then. Joey offered to watch him there while I finished things at my job. I hate taking [Redacted] out of school but it’s for the best.
HSBF: No. Still love you. I’m also glad you can be that honest with me.
“No. I think this falls under the category of nocturnal omissions anyway. Kind of sort of. All things I don’t tell my doctor, if I saw my doctor regularly outside of near-death experiences. Although please do not take this as a sign of my stamina. It’s just as I told Friday, been a while." Like he is not 100% sure Friday has been around for a sexual situation that did not involve his right hand and the toy chest. Jarvis was still around the last time he slept with Pepper and bringing random bed partners home would not improve that situation, so Tony got used to sleeping alone until Steve.
"You know that wasn’t a me choosing Bucky over you because I care about him more then you situation?”
Anthony: How was therapy?
“Can you guys go make sure strangling actually is not involved? I would hate for that to happen to Happy.” He was annoyed with the man, but did not want him to incur the wrath of Black Widow.
Love: I can understand why Pepper was angry. No one wants to find out their boyfriend has moved on to the pinnacle of human perfection.
Anthony: They were all in Howard’s private collection that did not go to the Smithsonian. I think that he felt that you wouldn’t want something so personal public. It’s why I kind of recognized her.
Iron Dad: I feel like this is something you can’t tell the president in an email. I’m not even sure how to begin talking about it in person. At least not without ending up in a mental hospital again.
“Can I at least write to my James? I don’t want him to think that I’ve abandoned him.”
Me: The press still hasn't figured out that Pepper and I are no longer a thing. Maybe that’s because they’re more focused on the demise of the Avengers than the fact that Pepper and I haven't been photographed together since the Stark industries Halloween costume ball last year. Things were falling apart before then.
Subject: RE: Thank You for the Cookies.
S Carter: I'm not surprised.
Genius Princess: Because he still doesn’t trust his bosses. Especially the one that made him go to the Rose Garden to make the American people think nothing was wrong. I assume that you are with the team trying to recover the shards of Thor’s hammer?
Me: You began the conversation this time, so maybe there's hope.
Nomad: Yes. But don’t worry, because Laura vetted her personally.
HSBF: How was DC?
Me: You know what, I’m not even going to dance around this anymore. He’s in love with you and I think you at least like him back, otherwise you wouldn’t be worrying over this so much. You definitely wouldn’t keep in contact with him as much.
“Robin told us not to,” Afia answered.
May: I’m not bitter or angry at my other-self. I’m happy with our kids.
“Traitor," Tony mumbled under breath. Although with super hearing, Steve probably still heard him.
Anthony: She wants you to call her.
Tony Potts: OK. Can I ask some questions about us in the other timeline?
MayMQ: Of course you are.
Tony: That's true, and I'm sure she's less likely to yell at you for waking her up at 2 AM on Christmas.
Time sent: 11/12/2016 22:16:12
Red phone: Now the Avengers consists of 2 1/2 people, 3 1/2 if you count Queens, but I'm not planning to take him out again until he can drive himself to the mission. Most of the time I think I’m the half in the Avenger total.
Venom: Except I am ridiculously obtuse apparently, and he literally had to take his mask off in front of me for me to get it.
Sky Quake can write me when she’s ready. Although, I really would like to talk to her about coming up with additional safeguards for the database along with the Princess. She doesn’t need to apologize for the last time we saw each other. I get it. You’re well aware of what I did in Siberia as well as why I did it. And I still feel bad. We had our heads up our asses so far, that her boyfriend had to sacrifice himself to keep half of the world from becoming zombies.
“Not everybody’s evil.”
Ana Jr.: Of course. You can pick them up on floor 27 in five minutes.
Hunter: Will do. Lucky for you, I made cookies. I'll even leave some.
At the US Department of State T is shorthand for the Under Secretary for Arms Control and International Security. I tried to decide what would be the worst position for a Hydra double agent to have that wasn’t Secretary and being the Under Secretary that is supposed to cut down on armament and militarization seem like a good position.
"So you're staying behind to protect Steve?" Sam asked.
HSBF: But this is really just a timeout and you know it. When you get back from Johannesburg, you’re going to have to sit down with Spidey and talk things out.
TMNS: Hey, they are letting me and Afia leave because apparently, the grown-ups need to keep talking.
Nomad: Sam was there.
“Yeah, that's not going to happen. I'll sleep on the plane. Although I could really use some espresso or six.”
Tony: Apparently, somebody is not that reformed and science is more important than good decision-making. Which I get but I still do not want to be in this position. Again.
Me: We took out everybody and I got to practice using full armor. Which was interesting, considering one of my teammates can actually melt me.
Me: Look, “not evil shield” is trending. Along with “new shield.” The rebranding is already working because nobody wants to type in that long name. Especially, with the character limit.
Me: Yes, maybe. I’ll see you when you get home.
Image 2: Steve’s drawling of Tony playing with his tie. Steve loves that tie.
HSBF: I am aware.
“Oh Honey Bear, you love my chatter and my mouth,” Tony said dodging a shot from evil puppy number eight. Thankfully, he was promptly taken down by Sam. Of course, that was the moment that a few more Watchdogs ran into the room. Okay, they sent at least 15 goons to kill him, when they thought he was by himself. He had definitely pissed some people off. Although not enough to send people in that actually stood a chance against that many Avengers. He may have shot a few in the leg just on principle at that point.
Even if Tony is mostly a stay-at-home dad, I feel like he would still need a nanny, mainly because in this verse, Pepper is still working. Extra adult supervision would be required if Tony got into the creative zone or was forced to spend quality time with the board. I love the idea of nanny Hunter from my Hydra lullaby story. Part bodyguard, part driver, and occasional babysitter. With Happy gone, Tony’s going to need someone else. I always believe Tony needs more friends.
Tony: So our wedding will be one month after we get the Accord situation settled? Somewhere at night on a rooftop?
“That would be Morgan. This is saying something because I invented clean energy and discovered a new element.” He looks over to see Steve open his mouth wide in shock. “OK, theoretically Howard discovered it, but I made it.”
“That’s just so you to send an apology gift. You have a regular vendor for that?” Steve asked, surprised.
The Mechanic: I am fully aware I owe you like at least six shoe baskets for that. I’m also willing to admit that was stupid and dangerous. As soon as I realized it was stupid, he was on a plane back to the states with Kevin, my assistant who BTW is a registered foster parent.
“I can do cake. Actually, I kind of need cake right now.” Steve agreed with that completely, especially because he was so worried about tonight.
Chief Mechanic: I really feel like you should call him husband. You don't wanna slip up in public. Jane would kill you.
“Does he realize that you have a crush on him?” Hunter heard baby Fitz ask as he placed the secret Stark tech communicator in his pocket. He really wanted one of those bead phones that everyone else walking around has but he’s afraid to ask.
Me: Okay before I leave for my LMD burning, should I bring the Princess to the playground or the upstate facility?
“I know you’re upset, but this is a not terrible thing.” Steve explains, holding him closer. “Honestly, as much as I really want to do those things with you, I’m not sure if we really are ready for that. I’m not sure if I’m ready. We still have things we should work through. You’re still scared I’m going to leave you or you think that I’m only here because Bucky is in cryo, when the truth is I’m here because I want to be with you." Tony responded by pulling Steve down for a kiss.
“You need to respond to Pepper.” He tells Tony.
Me: Are there reactions I should be concerned with?
Purple Princess: She was Hydra, which means that they're going to have to do another round of ferreting people out. I feel like that should warrant a presidential briefing all on its own.
Me: I told her to tell you because I’m kind of a coward. If we waited on me to tell you, it would be another month before you knew the truth.
Cuddle Bunny: You don't have powers, but you're still there. Couldn’t you just make her something?
Melinda: You need me to do this. You know we need Stark. You need him.
“All powers have consequences. You just don't always realize it at the time.” Steve answered.
“Karen, what are you doing here? Where is Friday?” Tony asked.
Red spider: No, but better me then MJ. Besides, I didn’t want May and Coulson to watch it alone. She’s their little girl.
Pepper pot: My head hurts so much right now.
Tony Bear: That’s true. It’s probably going to take at least three or four burgers to satisfy you.
Tony: I had an Italian mom. If you fuck with their kids, they will hurt you. Never cross an Italian mom.
I know about the proprietor of Alias. She may actually be a good choice for this. Just make sure you use the Tony C petty cash fund with the usual protocol.
Anthony: He was voluntarily forced to resign. Totally different. This happens every time there’s a new administration. It’s normal unless the new guy realizes it’s ridiculous.
"Yep. We would totally be living together by now, or we would’ve strangled each other and maybe not in a sexual way. It is really complicated with us. But I’d like to think we were getting to a good place anyway. I sincerely regret not taking you into the bathroom for a blowjob that day. I think it would have went over better than the pen. I should’ve took the Lysistrata approach to this thing."
I have horrible taste in boyfriends.
Tony Potts: Rocket, he kind of looks like a raccoon but don’t call him a raccoon. It’s offensive.
“Exactly. I’m not doing that again,” Steve expressed.
Me: Don’t do that.
Tony: No, but he’s planning to come to LA for Happy’s come to Jesus meeting. I’m not sure if it’s for emotional support or to yell at me.
Thank you everybody who read or reviewed the last conversation. You are all wonderful.
BITC: I’m leaving in 45 minutes, so I’m OK with incurring her wrath. Besides, this is an emergency.
Nomad: You mean the lawyers that got you back in the country?
Subject: I’m proud of you.
"Yes, even though it started a new rounds of paparazzi speculation."
Red phone: Everything is. Pepper and I are not able to work together right now. Not in person anyway. We can function through email. So she will be handling most operations from the West Coast office and I’ll be handling things from the East, with only having to see each other at the semimonthly board meeting.
Time sent: 11/12/2016 22:27:41
Tony: Obviously, you’ve been informed about that. And yes, he’ll be okay with that because he’s going to be the fourth.
Tony: You know I was reluctant to help with operation time heist.
Nomad: You don’t know that.
Me: Yep. She’s in the love zone. Also, good thing Yo-Yo and May are technically Avengers since they won’t be in the line of command of their boyfriends and won’t violate ATCU dating policy. You don’t want to know all the hoops Fitzsimmons are having to jump through.
HSBF: Do you have time?
Tony Potts: No such luck.
Me: Melinda is glaring at me right now.
Me: Unless you count emotional cheating. Friday delete that message

Genius Princess 2018: Who is Dr. Potts?
Anyway, I’m safe as honey bear probably reassured you. But I just wanted to tell you that myself. I just needed to take a few days to decompress. Stefan got shot, twice. However, I didn’t get a scratch mostly because I’m pretty sure he got in a way of a bullet at least once for me. I kind of just needed to hold him for a while. I may have been extra clingy. I hate close calls.
Anthony: I mean it’s not like that time I bought a Popeye’s franchise at a poker game. Rhodey is still the best choice.
HSBF: What happens now?
Chief mechanic: Of course, there’s a plan.
So thank you for being there for my nephew even though I know you have other things to do. I wish you a safe and quick recovery for your sake as well as his. Anyway, I hope you enjoy these cookies. They’re store bought by the way, and I made sure they didn’t contain anything you’re allergic to. I wish you would’ve told me you had food allergies instead of just throwing away my cookies. I would understand.
Monkey lover 1: Good.
Me: I was too busy kissing you?
Tony: We weren't speaking to each other for a few of those years. Also, you refuse to look at the instructions or have Friday read you the instructions. You also wouldn't let me design something better. Morgan has the best Barbie dream house. I gave Barbie her own science lab.
I am okay that you consider your ex-girlfriend family. She is an Avenger now, so she’s part of your Avenger family anyway. Besides, with the way things are going, she might be married to Coulson by the time we get this mess straightened out and get you back into the country. Fingers crossed, in both cases it be sooner rather than later. I feel like he’s going to have to die again for those two to get it together.
“I know, and I wish we would’ve fixed things, but we wouldn’t have Morgan or Robin or even Kamala. I hate thinking about us not having them, even if it was at the expense of something so horrible. I don’t want to lose my daughters. I’m terrified that when we undo the decimation, I’m going to lose them both. Kamala because her parents will be back and Robin because of the divorce.” Via the rearview mirror, Tony can see there is a tear falling down Steve’s cheek.
Nomad: Did Red show you cell phone video of yesterday’s mission? I was able to get to Clint before things went really badly.
Me: I hear and understand everything they were saying about me. "Rich asshole" was one of the nicer things said. Yo-yo also stole my suit tracking bracelet just to prove a point.
“I know that.”
HSBF: Are we still on for our second half of our date? Friday scheduled me for 4 PM your time. She said the kids would be busy with first day of school activities.
Counselor Laura: I thought that was a possibility. Also, Friday just changed your name in my address book a little.
Steve: Have you asked your AI why you can't have access?
Here we are at the epilogue, which is the longest chapter in this story, at nearly 6000 words. This is going to be a little different than previous sections because it is going to cover multiple days and people. The tags are going to be your friends.
Me: What do you value most?
Nomad: You really hate that guy.
I am sad that you have to pretend with other people but at the same time I’m happy that I get to see the real you. I’m glad that you trust me enough now to see you. This shows that we’ve come a long way in the last few months.
After everything, I still wanted to rebuild those bridges. Those first few conversations with Tony after what happened were not easy. I felt guilty and I was still angry because he tried to kill my best friend. I know why Tony reacted the way he did, but that doesn’t take away my anger.
To be continued
Cuddle Bunny: Where do you stand?
“Ok, let’s go find your boyfriend, he needs to talk to you with both me and Sam present. I rather get the heavy conversations out of the way early in the process, especially because Stark’s favorite coping mechanism is not telling people what’s going on.”
Me: About as safe as me emailing you from anywhere else. Also, I’m not exactly at the ATCU facilities. Actually, I can’t tell you where I am, but since you can’t tell me where you are, It’s only fair. I’ll talk to you later, lover bunny.
“No, we can do five. My first one for you is you’re a good dad.” Steve even gave him his super sweet smile again.
Me: Ridiculously good time. It is so much better to be around people I actually like and not the Board of Directors.
Love: Even though he shouldn’t, Coulson took my call. I may be angry at the bastard, but Coulson is Lily and Corey’s godfather. He is protecting us. It’s obvious that they’re not looking that hard for the wayward Avengers.
The Mechanic: Maybe you’re afraid that they will react badly. That they’ll kick you out of the house or hurt you physically. Maybe you’re afraid that they’ll stop loving you. That was always my number one fear with Howard.
Anthony: You can make it up to me in Johannesburg. What are your opinions on chocolate sauce?
Me: Definitely
“Well, you can always tell him that it wasn’t as badly damaged as you initially thought. Also not as much of a friendship as you initially thought.”
HSBF: That doesn’t surprise me.
Tony: And she figured it out on her own first. At least that’s what Aunt Peggy told me.
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last conversation, you’re all fabulous. You are all wonderful. This conversation takes place close to the end section of the last section. That’s all I am saying for now.
Oh, you thought it was over, not quite. You know I always give you more. Although I just want to take a moment to thank everyone for their comments and kudos on the final chapter. The big sequel will be upon us soon, coming Valentine’s Day 2020. Here’s your first taste to end our year right. Although, if you decided not to check out Text Messages from the Edge of High School, please at least read the post-credit scenes. You’re going to need them for what happens next. You have time.
Purple arrow: During the conference call yesterday, Deke said that Thanos wiped out half of all life in the universe. He also wouldn’t make eye contact with me.
TMNS: On multiple fronts.
“I am too. Of course, he knows me because I was friends with his grandfather during the war.” Steve explained.
These last few months I've gotten to know Tony better than I did in all the years previously. Maybe that was because I was only seeing the public persona and rarely got glimpses of the real Tony underneath. Now I'm seeing the person that you've seen for all these years and that's the person that I love. I love public Tony too because maybe now I understand why Tony hides behind it when necessary.
Francis: I wasn’t there for the apocalypse because I ignored Fury’s calls and May’s calls.  I think I hung up on Coulson twice.
Anthony: Clint’s influence again?
HSBF: Hey did you get to DC Okay?
HSBF: Also, it looks like Jane did not do very well with keeping the phone away from Yo-Yo because she already tweeted a picture of you announcing May as the next Captain America. There’s also a picture of her with the shield in a new costume. Thank you for the lack of cleavage window.
Purple arrow 2018: Sometimes, it takes longer than it should.
“But I am here and we are together. I’m not leaving. I know you’re upset that I’m with Tony now but I love him, and more importantly he loves me. I’m not going to leave him just because you want him to get back together with his ex-girlfriend for reasons I don’t even understand. All the problems they had before are still there. Did you ever stop to think that’s not something Tony wants? That it is probably not even something Miss Potts wants,” Steve defended himself
Red phone: Rhodey is not here in DC to remind me that my stupidity almost got him killed.
(See the end of the chapter for
Also, I think you forgot about crying in front of Yo-Yo and May on the way to the jet post Johannesburg or maybe you’re not counting that. I don’t know. Anyway, I think I’d rather do the other six questions through text message. Text message me in a few days.
Counselor Laura from 2023: During our last all-hands Avengers meeting, Simmons drank vodka out of a water bottle. It wasn't even good vodka, just strong vodka. She also has alcohol stashed everywhere. I haven’t seen her not drunk or crying since I’ve been here. Although maybe knowing Deke is okay will help. I'll tell her she can talk to him to get her there.
Me: I’m team competent person who is not xenophobic. Considering my name is the best on the short list for the new Shield director, it’s not looking good.
Me: I came up with my best stuff at 16 before my creativity was tampered by assholes on the board. Besides, that would be something Howard would do and you know I hate being anything like Howard.
: Another nickname for Tony Stark. Official codename in the Avenger message system/database. Currently trying to convince system to label my sibling King as Kitty Brother.
FF dot net still does not allow for Graphics, so I’m using the text descriptors but in reality they did use the emojis.
Anthony: I wasn’t going to send it from the Tony Stark official Twitter account.
Football Hunter: That’s not happening. Obviously, they don’t know you at all.
“I know that. Friday is actually blocking me from Twitter and Tumbler right now. I’m looking at what Yo-Yo sent me. I’m having at least a few of these my wall of Steve.”
Me: So anyway, he gets nominated for the job. I decide that since I actually like him, I will support the board's decision and graciously retire. Mostly to spend time with my recently discovered daughter. And help her acclimate to the American school system.
Captain tight pants: Are you back in New York yet?
Me: I thought you were considering running against her.
But he didn’t need the man. He did save May with the help of Fitz and Simmons. Yes it feels weird saying that even in his head, but really nothing about the last few months has not been weird. At least May was safe. One more good change. But was that enough to save the world? He had no idea.
Steve: Since you finally told me about Pepper, I’ll let you know the truth about my family. You know that in the history books it says that my father died in World War I. But did you ever look at my Shield file?
Pepper pot: That hard?
The new consultant: The first thing I did was see what happened to Daisy there.
“You weren’t there?” May asked.
HSBF: So it was my fault?
Dear James:
BITC: It’s OK. The idea of MJ, Benji, and Flash being in a relationship together is just ridiculous. I mean, Benji is straight.
“I told you I’m better at saying ‘I’m sorry’ with things. It’s a bad habit I picked up from Howard. Did you know that he had a custom bracelet designed for all his conquests? They actually go for a small fortune when up for private auction. I should know since I bought most of them to be destroyed, or rather recycled.”
Me: Are you sure the guy wasn’t a pedophile?
“For you, anything.”
So who sent that last text message?
Friday: I resent that remark.
“Yes.”
Me: They are. The Princess is studying the one we dropped off in her lab.
Okay, sorry again for not calling. I’m planning to have Friday completely integrated into the property before I leave. Though we both know that is no excuse because I do know how to use a normal cell phone. I even use the flip phone while drunk. That’s how I started speaking to Stefan again, actually. Although apparently I forget to take them to the beach with me which is why I’m a little tardy replying to this email.
FRIDAY: No, due to the reference of the incident and encrypted Hydra files. I will make contact with my source to get the report digitized so I may review it. I will let you know the results.
Me: I have several, but it can wait a couple more days. I should probably talk to [redacted] again.
HSBF: When is your next session with Dr. Suarez?
Steve: OK
“At least we’re no longer fighting each other at the moment. Tony called it the Avengers’ uncivil toddler squabble.” He hears Piper try not to laugh behind him but she’s not doing well.
Nomad: You have every right to be. I’m just glad that you’re actually text messaging me again. I don’t think you’ve gone this long without talking to me in a while.
Blue phone: Tony, it wasn’t that bad. Whoever told you about what happened was exaggerating.
Me: Probably. I’m exhausted and I’m trying to keep my head above water, but I’m not sure how well I’m doing.
Monkey lover 2: Don’t die either.
Me: Although Fitz did knock Radcliffe unconscious as Agent America critiqued his technique. Then he threw up on Radcliffe’s shoes and the LMD.
FRIDAY: Of course.
Venom: I wasn’t going to.
Tony: Of course, Mister and Mrs. Science want to do that.
Me: Nomad has a super immune system. Do they really need condoms?
Me: I did and then I had Jane get rid of all the images of Benji getting his dick smashed by his homecoming date as well as a lot of Spidey Twitter pics. Also, she’s kind of mad that I refused to give the kid an award for providing us information that led to the Vulture’s arrest.
“I was someone who protects everyone and who keeps her promises, even to the dead.” She takes a small drink of the wine that she’s barely touched. “I knew that Phil was looking forward to helping you get acclimated. The original plan was for me to move out and you to get my old apartment for a few months, as Phil helped you get acclimated. Everyone knew you were drowning in the apartment that Fury put you in a New York. The Loki incident changed that plan and so I decided I would help you the best way I could."
Me: Of course you still have connections and can find out what really happened.
HSBF: Although I'm really glad that I adapted to the future better than that guy.
The Timber Pizza Company is a real pizza place in DC and their pizza is delicious.
Steve: I realize that too. Again, I’m sorry.
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last section. You are all wonderful. We are still in the “Tony and Steve made bad choices” timeline. I was tempted to go back to the other timeline, but I felt like you would be furious with me if I didn’t cut back to Laura and Steve.
Ana Jr.: Your father is currently not at the Lighthouse. He left 45 minutes ago.
Football Hunter: I can give you sex tips. You seem like the type that would be very skilled with your tongue.
MayMQ: I don’t sleep. Besides, we just got upstairs after an evening of political networking where Stark tried to get on the good side of various governments, the non-homophobic ones anyway. How are they taking the news about Stark? Has the package gone public yet?
“Text Stark.” Laura heard a voice say from the doorway.
"So, at least here I won't be trying to do that during the middle of a battle,” Shuri added.
Xxxxx
We are en route to LA to investigate something “ghost” related. If things go badly, I’m going to need Friday to fix things. If you hear about a prison riot in California or an explosion near Pasadena, then you know that things have gone badly.
May: It was worse the second time. Because I know Phil is not going to come back. I stood there while they cremated his body and spread his ashes in the ocean. We went to Tahiti. I didn’t want to leave, but Steve brought Robin and me home. Even though he was falling apart because Tony was still MIA. Steve offered to marry me when the government tried to take Robin away from me. The DOD wouldn’t dare take Captain America’s daughter. He helped me keep my family together.
“Seriously, why are you here? You can go bug May or Clint? Why didn’t you show up on Agent America’s doorstep?” Tony asked.
Lily bear 2018: Mom, is this really you? Are you OK? Are you really in the future? Mr. Fitzsimmons said you were, but Ana let me see the video. You just disappeared.
Melinda: They do. Phil was impersonated by one in the 90s.
Agent M: It was too dangerous, especially after Hydra came out of the shadows.
Tony: Which would be a relief to Hunter. I’m sure Hunter would prefer hunting Hydra again to more than 48 continuous hours with the kids by himself.
“I’m already home.”
Thank you to everybody who read and/or reviewed the last chapter. You are all absolutely wonderful. This conversation takes place about 36 hours after the last interlude and only a few hours after Tony wrote his note to his Lily bear. This one is actually label as a ‘conversation’, so you know what that means? Our boys are finally going to talk to each other.
Tony Potts: That last name seems familiar.
Blue phone: I didn’t love Melinda.
Anthony: Nope. And neither did Yo-Yo which I’m surprised because the bastard killed her cousin in cold blood. She could’ve pulled the trigger. Part of me thinks she should have pulled the trigger, but she didn’t. That makes her a better person than me.
Nomad: I think Friday may be forwarding those to Wanda. Considering how much she’s giggling, I don’t want those to ever be released, even if no one knows that I’m actually your boyfriend.
Image 4: Steve’s drawing of Tony on top of him in the lab getting ready to engage in activities that would raise the rating of this story to NC-17. Both Tony and Steve are shirtless and getting ready to lose their pants.
Agent L. Barton: I didn’t know if I can say his name around you. I’m sure losing him was hard. It was hard on Clint the first time.
Me: However, I’m not worried about Ross. I am worried about him, but not about him locking me up on his super secret floating prison.
Nomad: If it keeps you from getting arrested, just turn it over.
Me: I’ll have to talk to Colonel Rhodes. I think it's possible along with other benefits.
Me: One, she’s competent. Two, she is not completely xenophobic.
Me: The fight was over by that point. And I think we would’ve only been called in if they couldn’t have solved it with the enhanced people that they already had.
Friday: Yes.
Pepper pot: That he's going to consider their suggestion that he go to grad school. He’s on a private campus tour to check out a few doctorate programs.
Anthony: I think they could probably be Secret Avengers, but I would like to keep them away from Ross and all the anti-enhanced person politicians by whatever means necessary.
Anthony: His Girl Friday was one of her favorite movies. She watched it all the time. One of the nice things about being rich is that we had a home movie theater long before DVDs and even VHS was a thing.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Spider: Apparently, Ana was not programmed to lock the door as soon as she detects such activity. I’m going to have to fix that oversight in her coding.
Counselor Laura: He’s been making a fuss on the various talk shows and podcasts. He’s a regular of JJ Jameson, but he’s mostly neutered at this point. We have more significant problems.
“Personally I would prefer if he would not need to choose either. I always hoped by 2016 we wouldn’t be fighting wars anymore, but here we are.” The director said From in front of him.
“It will probably give you something to do on the flight back,” Steve kissed his cheek gently.
December 22, 2016. Group text with Tony Stark, James Leopold (A.k.a future Fitz) and Leopold Fitz soon to be Leopold Fitz-Simmons. (They are thinking a spring wedding.)
HSBF: And apparently we had bad marketing?
Me: Contrary to popular belief, Tony was not really a playboy until after his parents died. At least, I think he used sex to dull the pain along with a lot of drugs and alcohol.
: refers to Peter Parker a.k.a. Spider Man of YouTube. Participated in the airport incident. TMNS is his official codename in the Avenger database/messaging service.
Purple Princess: That would be because my dad is on his way to brief the president. Apparently, he had an hour-long pre-brief with Jeffrey and is now probably texting my other dad to convince him to come to DC, so he doesn't have to do the meeting alone.
“My situation is different. I was more active in my bad choice, but it doesn’t matter now.” Natasha tells him with a sad smile. “Anyway, we need to talk about what happened in Germany and Siberia.”
The Boy in the Chair: I would definitely do that, quickly. Walking in on your parental figures would make anybody nauseous. Wait, why are you not sick? If I walked in on something like that, I think I would need like a month of therapy. I’m so glad neither of my parents are back on the dating scene yet.
Anthony: I am always going to be allowed to do what I need to do for my company. Similarly, Shield has carte blanche to go after people that break into their secure facilities and remove weapons for black market sale.
Nomad: Obviously you're going with Melinda.
Tony Bear: Thanks for trying. Nobody really has any solutions for the Spidey problem, good ones anyway. The head of Avenger PR suggested that I just give him a suit closer to mine and hold a press conference.
That works. Miss Rodriguez will be in touch. I should be available the first or second weekend in October. I think. I’m bad at remembering my own schedule.
Tony: You prefer animal names, don’t you?
Red phone: That is now very permanent, moving on to other people permanent. Why did you think I decided to stay at the compound with an hour commute each day when I have to be at SI in person?
“Because Tony was trying to kill someone and Steve was trying to keep him from doing that. If you talk to Tony about what happened, he would tell you that. Have you even bothered to ask or did you do what you did today and just say bad things about his boyfriend?” Romanoff asked.
“Twice,” Steve said sadly. “May never really recovered from losing Phil. I think that’s the real reason why we are just…”
Tony: We are combining the research together but going with the Framework name because barf is a bad acronym.
The Mechanic: That doesn’t make me feel better.
Me: We got close, minus the sexual content, then Happy screwed up and Ben had a building collapse on him.  Still not happy.
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last chapter. You are all fabulous. For those that were confused in the last chapter, “Clint’s sister” is code for Natasha. She did consider herself Aunt Natasha to the kids.
Welcome back to the "bad choices were made" timeline. This conversation takes place about an hour after the last one ended in this timeline.
Steve: That makes complete sense.
“No she left him. You know she left him. And maybe if Steve wasn’t in the picture, Stark would have gone back to her after Siberia on hands and knees with a giant Henry Winston diamond engagement ring and promised that he’ll give up being a superhero and promised that they will adopt babies together and be the perfect family. Maybe for a minute, she would have believed him. Maybe even long enough to actually make it down the aisle but the moment the world needs Tony Stark, he will be there and she will be left behind. I don’t think she can deal with that, not really.” Natasha said harshly. Deep down, he knows she’s right. But he’s never going to tell her that.
“Well Coulson found out and apparently, I’m not allowed to make an AI based on him. As long as he’s alive anyway. Now Philip is confined to Agent America’s Avenger phone and the advanced tactical suit I am creating for her. She likes when Philip reads her text messages. Strangely, Agent is okay with that use of the technology,” Tony explained.
“And Lily bear. You know she is still mad at you for disappearing for over six months with nothing more than the one card to let her mom know that you were okay. That kid has some serious separation anxiety.” Tony remarked.
Xxxxx
Me: And yet instead of calling me or showing up in person, you’re sending me a text message.
Cuddle fiancé: That her girlfriend may be in Asgard after battling someone that can apparently break Thor’s hammer? No. Did I tell Natasha that Daisy disappeared from Norway with Thor and Loki and hasn’t been heard since then? No. You want me to take less risk.
xxxxxx
Tony: Okay, I’ve just been informed that it is bagel time. Write me in a few days?
Pepper pot: I want you to help. I really would like my chief creative officer/R&D head back.
Cousin Q: You know I’m regretting not being in Mumbai right now with my girlfriend. I’m going to strangle Leo’s husband. Why did Leo bring him on this mission?
Captain tight pants: You think she knew that it was a hit?
“Basically, after you manage to get your loved ones and pets out of the house, if you had time to go back and get one more thing, what would that thing be? I feel like this question was written before everyone found out how Jack died on This Is Us." Tony joked.
Me: Liberty is down.
Nomad: I wouldn’t be surprised.
“It’s a loaner. I mean I could have a quinjet drop off his actual car but it probably would be a little too easily noticed in whatever European country you are currently in. But tell him that it’s safe in my garage and Daisy is not allowed anywhere near it. I’ve even taking care of the scratches,” Tony tells him.
Anthony: Before, but they could've tried the sunflower oil stunt anywhere. I eat out a lot because cooking takes too much time when I do actually remember to eat something. I’m not going to stop living my life.
Nomad: Yes.
“Okay, it’s never a good sign when you start crying while reading an email. See, this is why I said no emails until you’re on the plane tomorrow. You know, unless it meets the apocalypse threshold.”
To be continued
Red phone: If I end up before Congress next week, I’m going to blame you.
Red phone: I’m back and let me just say how happy I am that you’re worried about me, but there’s no need to be. Scary just pulled me in for another debriefing before letting me go back to the DC house for the night.
Hunter: You didn’t want anything to do with this.
Counselor Laura: Will knowing Deek is OK help?
Me: She’s next-door. She also prefers Agent America, but that’s only because the guy she is in love with prefers it.
Purple Arrow: Good.
May: Virginia would be closer and a better option. Vegas is tacky.
Genius Princess: I can’t, mostly because Chief Monkey Lover and the time-traveling R&D guy cannot be left in the room alone. Hunter can only keep the peace long enough for me to eat something, and TMNS might just web them up. That would be bad. Besides, we almost have it. Are you back home yet? I know you’re not in Mumbai anymore.
Anthony: I care about you too. Hey, Rhodey just showed up to the Tower. I’ll talk to you later.
Hunter: Because he didn’t think he was ever coming back. I know you made some similar choices in the same situation. So you can’t judge him for doing the same thing you did.
“Present from Stark?”
Cuddle Bunny: So you’re now text messaging me from the ATCU facilities? Is that safe?
Me: His personality is based on your other father. Sort of.
TMNS: Oh, that’s not good.
Agent Johnson: I don’t know where Thor or his sister are.
Me: I hate you. It’s why I posted videos of you imparting your wisdom to the youth of the world.
Tosha: Look, you don’t even have to say anything if you don’t want to talk about what Simmons did or didn't do. I just don't want to sit alone and watch Stark and Rogers make passive-aggressive googly eyes at each other. As Simmons acts like she's not drinking hard liquor at two in the afternoon. We all know. It’s even worse now that Deke is MIA.
Jemma: I’m not pregnant.
Anthony: I told you he is our number one shipper. He is a hopeless romantic who constantly carries around an engagement ring with him in case I want to propose to Pepper in the spur of the moment.
Monkey lover 2: Baker and most of the board would hate that.
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last chapter. You are all fabulous with your encouraging words. Congratulations to everybody who guessed that Natasha was there surprise houseguest.
time. Why are you bringing this up again? I thought we moved past it.
Question 26, for me it would be, I wish I had somebody who I could share my superhero life with which turns out to be you, Sugar Cakes. I think we talked about how the ultimate downfall of me and Pepper was she didn’t get my Avenger life. You do, which may mean this relationship might actually work long-term. I want that.
Me: We are all one bad day away from being a super villain. Of course, in your case it would probably take a complete cerebral rewrite or possibly brainwashing. You’re too squeaky clean otherwise.
Me: BTW, your detention video is now a meme.
“And maybe some pants.”
"So is this the part of the conversation where you tell me to leave your best friend alone or where are you threaten to kill me if I break Stevie Bunny's heart? I've already had various variations of this conversation including from somebody I changed the diaper of." Sharon was vicious but protective. Maybe if Steve ever returned, they might become friends.
Monkey lover 2: Or maybe there is some merit to the multi-verse theory and I’m in a different dimension altogether. We never did find Ian Quinn in my original timeline.
Love: Love you
To be continued
"Trust me, I wish I could disappear with all of you but short of faking my death, again, that's a little hard to do." Tony said as he sat down on one of the couches in the suite. He felt like he was going to be here a while.
Me: I can tell.
Genius Princess 2018: It is 7:23 AM Sunday morning, New York time. We are currently at the lighthouse facility after the Avenger compound was infiltrated.
Anthony: Pouring my heart out to you? Yes. But I'm still doing it because I'm a masochist. Also unlike anybody I would randomly meet at a bar you're probably not going to blackmail me. The only downside is you’re unwilling to try text message sex. I don’t know why because I can guarantee I can make you cum without actually being there.
To: Lily bear
Venom: Still sober, which is somewhat remarkable considering this day began with seeing my now ex-boyfriend making out with somebody else on Instagram and ended with me finding out my best friend is a robot.
Tosha: No, those two are being awkward and avoiding eye contact. Probably because they both know another Steve and Tony are engaged in Agent Barton’s timeline.
“Ross wanted the tech, which again is a total abuse of the State Department.” Tony explained.
Me: And yet that is who Ross wanted, but the UN chose Colonel Rhodes.
Red phone: I'm not going to screw Kevin over just because I don't want to teach a new person how to make my coffee. I’m not going to let SI fall apart because I have a tendency to fall in love with people who can’t love me for who I really am.
Blue phone: But that doesn’t mean you should stop trying.
Pepper pot: It’s something to look at.
Me: Absolutely horrible. I think Yo-Yo may have disarmed somebody after the interview was over, but I can’t be sure.
“Yes, and if this is where we need to start, then so be it.”
“OK, maybe not that far but in a stable relationship. I mean, you’re already married to someone else.”
Me: Because the board would like for it to come out on a holiday weekend to do as little damage possible to the stocks. Also, Jane is a miracle worker. However, that gives us time to cash in on the seeds of discontent.
Anthony: Probably. I would understand if you don’t want to risk coming, but I really want to see you. It’s been a very stressful couple of days.
Tony: It’s not cost competitive for the general public. No normal person would want your phone, but the DOD are totally into it.
“One I will never tell you.” Romanoff responded as she pulled back her now blonde hair into a ponytail. That’s when Tony noticed a mark on her neck.
Recently, I read the Star Wars fan fiction series Obi-Wan Kenobi, the Chosen One by SorciereMystique. Which deals with Obi-Wan Kenobi’s descent into alcoholism and his recovery. It definitely gave me some ideas for this story. It’s a really interesting series, so I encourage everybody to check it out.
I think she would’ve been really disappointed about Siberia. She wouldn't want me to keep hating you. She would want me to try to make amends, especially considering the fact that, unlike the other guy, you were acting under duress.
“Still not reassured,” Hunter said, looking at his boy… His friend. Leo is …yeah this is too complicated of a situation to even lie to himself right now. And he was really good at that after the divorce.
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last conversation. You are so wonderful. I’m posting this early this morning because I have to go out shopping in person—the horror of it all.
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last conversation. It is now time for more get well messages. Some digital and others contain cookies. Apparently, everybody just wants to send Tony things that won’t send him into anaphylaxis. Also, he doesn’t eat enough.
Me: You know after I specifically said not to make contact but, whatever.
Tony: Happy’s glaring at me.
Purple Princess: We’re pretty sure she’s with the Asgardians, and we have an idea of what planet they’re on now. However, we are still working on establishing contact. Which is actually what I’m working on in the lab right now.
Tony: Yes.
Me: With what we do, it feels like we could drop dead at any moment so I feel like I have to live like I could drop dead any minute.
TMNS: Are you going to abandon me now?
The new consultant: You owe me pancakes when I get there with chocolate and blueberries. Why do I feel like this is the beginning of another New York level apocalypse?
“Yes, and you’re her big brother, so I wouldn’t have done that to you. You really did accidentally send the message yourself.” Ana tells him.
“That’s because despite what the state of New York believes, Tony is really good with children. I’m so glad somebody decided to let him adopt. I’ve already heard about Morgan.” And she could tell this Tony was in love.
Me: That’s very gracious of you. Dr. Suarez would be proud.
Tony: Really?
There was a lab mishap today that made me realize that maybe it’s not a clever idea to have a 15-year-old working on a lot of the projects that I’m doing. He didn’t follow the protocols and somebody almost got hurt. Thanks to my assistant and bodyguard, Miss Rodriguez, the worst thing that happened was Peter lost his clothes, which is why he ended up wearing a Free Quake T-shirt.
“No. But you’re not looking at that book. The cost is too high,” Leo argued.
"Are you back with us permanently?" Sam asked Natasha.
Me: Maybe not. That heartfelt letter is one of the few reason why I’m not considering pressing kidnapping charges. The other reason why I’m not pressing charges is I would have to acknowledge in court who my nephew really is. Would he be forced to sign the Accords, if I do something like that?
I’m not mad about Stefan. If I can have a new boyfriend, you can have a new boyfriend. Okay, I’m a little mad. Not that you have a boyfriend, but that you didn’t tell me. How did it get this bad between us?
Me: Although Happy is still mad at us, but he agreed to hand over the ring to be sold and the proceeds donated to My Sister’s Place in your mother’s name, anonymously of course.
Tony: Okay, not necessarily happy but healthy. Deke also misses you.
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last conversation. You are all absolutely lovely. I did survive my con and had an absolute blast. I even dressed as Reina for one day.
Anthony: And we will get there, but I want us to at least get to the two week mark before then. Also, I’m not lying about therapy. Yo-yo’s glaring at me right now. She’s threatening to take my phone.
Me: You have me, Pepper, Rhodey, Laura and the kids. That’s like six maybe, seven people if you count Nate.
Girl Friday: Hey baby sister, where is our dad?
Me: I don’t think being a member of Hydra is a minor mishap.
Remember not to spoil the Endgame for others. No public Endgame comments for at least the next month. However, you can PM me on FF dot net. I will delete any comments that contain endgame spoilers that show up before the end of the 30 days.
“And hopefully our boss’s braces?” May asked.
To: Tony_Carbonell
Nomad: You blame yourself for all the innocent people that were killed with your weapons simply because you didn’t question Obadiah Stane earlier.
Captain tight pants: More importantly, are you sleeping again?
I’ve killed a lot of parents, not intentionally, but I did. And I had full control of my faculties at the time. If you ever comes across Wanda ask her what my weapons or rather I did to her family. I don’t think she’ll ever forgive me for that, even with the wedding present. What’s a house, when you are essentially responsible for making her an orphan?
“Nano tech is a beautiful thing. I’m not quite sure how the Princess’s version of it works but I probably will once I’m focused on other things beside you.”
Purple Princess: I’ll have Ana send you the BRIEFR packet. Just make sure you read it in a secure location.
Boss: Let’s see what Agent May wants, but just in case have a suit on standby.
Football Hunter: It would be nice, but not everything. We’re both going to be on the UN avenger roster. And I know you’re going to be the new head because May said no.
BITC: Although I think Benji has graduated to a new sleepover partner.
Tony: This is Pepper. He will talk to you after the meeting. I am seriously regretting the President sanctioning your relationship, so he can speak to you all the time.
"That's good."
Tony: Therefore, there had to be another reason. Something that furthers the prick's goals.
Tony: OK Friday is a brat and started blasting put a ring on it. This is why we must be wary of even benevolent AIs.
Me: True. However, I must admit that when I call the board, I do rehearse or at least plan, now, what I’m going to say because Pepper would kill me. Even then, the calls don’t always go well.
Purple Arrow: Fuck
BITC: Please, yes. I don’t like this arrangement. I want to live with my dad. What about MJ’s apartment?
(See the end of the chapter for
Me: Only by a few weeks and that may not necessarily be a bad thing.
Captain Tight Pants: It couldn’t have been that bad.
Nomad: That also explains why you keep dropping your phones into the river.
HSBF: This originated from your real Twitter account. It’s quoted in several articles.
xxxxxx
To be continued.
I was initially planning for this to be an in-person conversation between Tony and Steve. However, during the rewrite process, I realize they're not quite there yet. Therefore, I switched it to text messages. They're still ridiculously awkward in person around each other and usually stress eat to break the tension. Although they do like to subconsciously touch each other a lot. Don’t you just want to hug them until they get a clue? Or maybe a slap?
Me: Actually I think they’ve been over since probably December. He did show up to a very farmhouse Christmas alone.
Steve: I don’t want to talk about that.
Me: And you were the one who turned a Twitter fight about the Super Bowl with a celebrity into a half million dollar fundraising activity.
Steve: You’re right. I’ll try.
Tony Potts: I’m still sober, which is a miracle in itself because I really want a fucking drink right now. Honestly, I wanted one for the last week and a half. Yet while we were at the quick stop, I just got a giant espresso.
TMNS: When I gave you that speech, both versions, I didn’t know who you were, really. Since we’ve established I am Demisexual, you know I can’t be with somebody I don’t know first. Now we are close friends. Also, I didn’t realize I wasn’t heterosexual until you kissed me.
Blue phone: I’m still here.
Anthony: Do I want to know? Did you at least avoid getting shot?
xxxxx
(See the end of the chapter for
Me: Radcliffe brought up the asshole father while he was pleading for mercy/leniency. Or maybe it’s because Monkey Lover felt like he was being stabbed in the back by another father figure. It was probably a lot of things at once. It’s always the quiet ones, especially if the quiet one is also a spy.
The new consultant: Well, most of the adults are in DC meeting with the president.
Me: Anthony is working on it.
HSBF: No, just Sam. And should you really be eating bacon glazed doughnuts? Your heart stopped last month.
“Please tell Dr. Leopold to go call his boss and explain everything that’s happening.”
Me: What about the director?
Anthony: That I should’ve put some ‘toys’ in your care package.
Me: Probably. We have people watching R&D, but we neglected the board. We should rectify that.
“Thank you so much. As I’ve gotten older, I’m not quite in to public sex anymore. Although quick question; where is Happy? You didn’t have to knock him out? ”Tony asked a little concerned.
Anthony: It’s perfect. The paparazzi are less likely to crash if we do it in the middle of the night.
Me: I think you would know that by now.
Purple Princess: You’ll be 18 soon, and then you won’t have to deal with this anymore.
Rogers: So Tony is really doing okay?
Me: Consider it one of the nice things about being Tony Stark. Everyone sends me screeners, which makes up for the fact that I can’t watch a movie without renting out the theater outside of a premier. Even then, there’s paparazzi everywhere. Tell birdbrain that I’m not sleeping with his wife, no matter what Christina Everhart says.
"Do you understand what really happened in Germany and Siberia?" Because Steve still wasn’t entirely sure what really happened and he’s been talking about it with his therapist for a while.
Nomad: I am not having text message sex with you. Why do I need to watch the news right now?
HSBF: What about you?
Tony: I’ve yawned twice in the last 10 minutes, so as much as I love talking to you, Honey Bear, I just kind of want to crawl in my bed at the compound and sleep for a week. I mean, I love you and want to know more about your good qualities. But my pillow looks really good right now.
Chief Mechanic: I already must deal with one sassy teenager. I don't need another.
Anthony: That was in the diaries and Peggy hinted at it. But the nine-year-old that I used to be felt like he wasn’t loved and that’s why he was sent away.
Chief Mechanic: Yes, and then everything went to shit. Although at least the Earth was still in one piece. I guess that's the timeline that Monkey Lover two was trying to avoid.
“I trust you, just don’t talk about us having sex,” He said as he handed the nano paper “notebook” to Tony.
“I’m not sure if it’s bad news but it’s not something we want cronies of Ross to intercept. He is gone but there is a dozen other people out there just like him.” Tony tells him.
To be continued:
Melinda: Not yet. Clint and I are in the room with her. I agree with you. Can you convince Friday to let you have access?
The new consultant: Well, you do you know his biggest secret now, and I’m sure at least he knows that no means no. Also, if he ever found out what happened, he may be tempted to break his no-killing policy. At a minimum, he would web him up to the Hollywood sign or something.
Me: A lot of very young children and adolescents are suddenly waking up with superpowers like Lily’s new friend from New Jersey. They need someone who has experience working with kids and working with enhanced persons.
Anthony: But really wonderful sketches. Yo-Yo agrees. Which explains why she told me to check the roses first.
So feel free to speculate how the show and Infinity War will influence this story or how things will be different in this timeline. But no matter what happens, remember that Tony and Steve are in a much better place because they got over themselves. And maybe just maybe the two Fitzs can live together in harmony, without one of them having a bridge dropped on him. Now, let’s celebrate that we are currently in Mumbai.
Summary: They say that the best way to communicate in an emergency is via text message. A giant purple alien bent on wiping out half of the universe’s population with the help of six infinity stones definitely qualifies as an emergency. This fact is even more apparent now that Laura Barton is currently trapped in a timeline where that actually happened because the Avengers (read: Tony and Steve) never mended fences. Now the last remnants of those Avengers are trying to fix what happened. What’s going to be easier, stopping Thanos, undoing the damage he already caused in another timeline, or getting that timeline's Tony and Steve to get their shit together? Two timelines, one mission, and an infinite amount of text messaging.
“You can’t send that,” Steve tells his boyfriend.
OK, I think we already did 28 with the positive qualities but OK. I like your artwork, I like the fact that I have to explain pop-culture references to you. Sometimes it’s fun. I enjoy that I get to expose you to things for the first time. Your face just lights up so much. I love that you’re passionate about things even when I want to punch you in the face. I love your voice. I love when you’re silly as well as being serious.
Me: But we got over it.
Captain tight pants: You could have handed this phone and my letter over to Ross, but instead you’re actively trying to make sure he can’t find us.
“You’re a vindictive AI when you’re not being used?” He asked Ana.
HSBF: Probably. So she's retiring?
Me: Thank you for telling me. I’m not gonna say that you shouldn’t worry, but I think things are a lot better than they were. At the very least, I think the Avengers are more together then we were right after Siberia. At least Clint is back in the country. Everything else will work out eventually.
Me: Jesus.
HSBF: Not well because they still asked you about it. Although, thank you for not mentioning Bucky. I prefer for as little to get out about that is possible.
“I would say Siberia is too serious to joke about, but I think you've made some Siberia jokes," Steve remarked.
Continuity note for non-AOS viewers: Shortly before Tony was kidnapped in Afghanistan, Agents May and Coulson were on a mission in Bahrain that went south quickly and resulted in the death of a young inhuman girl. This is her biggest regret. (See AOS episode 2.17 for details.) Agent May develop severe PTSD, which resulted in her leaving her husband and fieldwork. But she came back eventually. So obviously children with powers like Peter, Kamala, and Miles are going to concern her or more accurately, young children not being able to control their powers concerns her. (Yes, Miles Morales is our five-year-old who has developed spider powers.)
"I’m not arguing.” Tony told his boyfriend.
Cuddle fiancé: No. We’ll see you soon.
Blue phone: Where is Natasha?
Melinda: Go deal with Stark.
Anthony: Of course, we should do a movie night the best way we can. What movies or even TV shows are still on your pop culture list?
“You know who I am?”
Friday: Your resolution to be honest with each other will only be successful if you are actually honest with one another about your true feelings for one another. However, statistically speaking, I only see a 73.2% probability that you both will do that.
CoulsonPJ: We have been invited to dinner at the tower once you get back from Johannesburg
Because of the way I handled the situation with Bucky and you in Siberia, I feel like the Avenger family is in pieces. For a while, I felt like I finally had a place where I fit in this crazy world. A new family, but it’s gone now and it’s because of my choices.
HSBF: So she’s on the West Coast now?
Friday: They were already enroute before this incident occurred and should arrive within the next four hours.
Captain tight pants: I don't like the idea of you being dead, so try not to do stupid things that will result in you dying.
Tony: And I have accepted that Wanda is my daughter-in-law and I am writing her into the will because I kind of killed her family, so she should get something.
Note to self: Add Watchdogs to groups for intelligence to watch. Look into possible funding from Russia for the anti-inhuman organization.
HSBF: I feel like that’s not how the exercise actually works.
Me: I don’t know. I had to postpone a few days because of an Avenger emergency. Fish oil incident that actually needed more firepower than the Zapper to contain before it became a recruitment tool for the Watchdogs and Senator Hateful.
Sorry you’re just going to have to use Tony’s word pictures for Steve’s artwork this time. However, there are plans for more artwork in the future.
“Okay, Howard caught me using your propaganda poster for personal time when I was a teenager.” Technically he was a preteen, but he wasn’t quite ready for Steve to know that yet. “I’m still shocked he didn’t yell at me. Instead, he had Aunt Peggy give me the Captain America was really bisexual speech. You’re actually the reason why I figured out I was pansexual. You‘re also the reason why I was comfortable being not that heterosexual. Because if Captain America was queer, then it was okay for me to be too.” Tony explained.
Counselor Laura: No, but now I’m going to really want to see that footage. Due to the stressful circumstances of recent events, we programmed Friday to notify us if Tony engages in any high-risk behavior that could be dangerous to himself or others.
Me: And that makes her sympathetic?
Red phone: I don’t know if that’s a good thing because I don't trust myself at all.
HSBF: That’s a requirement for your assistants?
Now it’s letter time. This email was written a few hours after Tony’s letter to Steve. It’s one that he’s been working on for a while and I promise happy will see it.
Genius Princess 2018: Why didn’t I think of that. That could work. It also would help with their mission to complete the gauntlet to undo the purple one’s previous damage.
Me: That may be connected to the Watchdogs which is why Agent America was called in. Which is fine because the BFF already said no.
“I thought that about my mom once upon a time and Hydra happened,” He regrets his last words to her so much.
Tony Potts: I considered it, but didn’t. I didn’t think you would want to see me after I caused your or rather her husband to go on the run.
Morgan’s dad: Also, you don't have to bring me food. I do know how to cook now. I don't live on protein bars and smoothies alone anymore. The nonalcoholic kind, I'm not the mom from Hey Arnold.
Purple Princess: I don't think this line is encrypted enough for this conversation.
Nomad: Is Yo-Yo under 18?
“I am detecting that you are crying now. Would you like me to put on soothing music?” Karen asked moments after Steve left.
Steve: Hey, I thought I would just check in to see how Robin is doing. Thank you for letting her stay there for a few days. She always says that you make homework fun for her.
"You’re so sweet.” Tony gave him another gentle kiss. “Now, I didn’t date before Pepper. I’m sure this can all be traced back to my deep-seated Howard issues. It also didn’t help that my first boyfriend made a sex tape that is making its rounds through Twitter and Tumbler again right now. Which is totally reminding me why you are my second real boyfriend."
That second question, I almost don’t want to touch mostly because I know the answer for you and it wasn’t pretty. The answer wasn’t pretty for me either. I was sick all the time. Sometimes I know we didn’t have money for food and mom would go hungry so I could eat. She worked two jobs and we still didn’t have enough because I was so sick. But I had my mom and my pseudo-brother and that’s all I really needed. I was doing better than a lot of other kids back then.
HSBF: I know. I think I'm going to need your assistant’s phone number if I need help dealing with you. I think Laura is a little too mad at me to actually respond.
Me: You’re still adorable when you’re flustered. You should just ask if I have fucked Agent.
MJ: It’s not a love triangle when you’re competing with each other, not against each other. We’ve bonded over shitty dads and our clueless crush. You’re like the best thing my father gave me.
Blue phone: It’s that bad?
“And you’re doing well. I’m proud of you,” Steve gently kissed him on the lips.
“Unless the treatment’s not working and he is still a traitor, regardless,” May told him darkly and Leo responded by putting his head in his hands. “Also, I thought you and Stark made sure that couldn’t happen.”
To: Teenage Mutant Ninja Spider
“We think so, but there could be other differences that we are not aware of.”
SimmonsJA: No, but I feel like I need to rectify that since most people keep forgetting that I have not had more medical training than your average military medic. However, Dr. Suarez also agrees with the orders and she has an M.D.
Anthony: When did you talk to Sharon?
Tony: You have a point.  Do those boundaries change when you have children together? Because Pepper has decided to force Steve and me to share a room tonight.
Love: Because their biological uncle is a bastard and their godfather faked his death and didn’t bother to tell them.
Friday 2023: According to my database, Ana Jarvis's cause of death is still listed as a Home accident involving a lightbulb. Although Ana 2018 has sent me a file describing her death as Hydra collateral damage.
Me: As a joke. I don’t want to be in charge of any federal agency. I shouldn’t be in charge of any agency. I shouldn’t even be in charge of the Avengers, but they won’t let Rhodey take that role because he can’t be out in the field and he won’t let me sue the government for violating the ADA to get him the position. Manic-depression they can deal with, but wheelchair utilization is too much.
PS: I think it is best of Happy comes back to New York. He’s joining me for the Labor Day event anyway. I would feel better if he was there with you after what happened. Really call him and stop pushing us all away.
Cuddle bunny: And Clint used to call us mom and dad.
Nomad: Because I am.
Counselor Laura: I'm not even surprised. I'm thankful for Friday’s intervention. Sometimes you need all the help you can get.
Steve: I’ll make you some brownies later.
Me: Answer the question, Capsicle.
Chief Mechanic: Of course, she did. I suggest telling her to reschedule it until after the Apocalypse.
Anthony love: Also, Laura just got kidnapped from the compound.
Steve: Please explain, Tony?
“I hope so too. I wish I was there to watch him. But I can’t be. But you are. So please keep an eye on him.” Steve wonders if he’s asking for too much but he knows Pepper loves Tony too.
: Natalia Alianovna "Natasha" Romanoff a.k.a. Black Widow. Ayo hates her.
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last conversation. You are all wonderful. We are still in the "bad choices were made" timeline. We are going to be here for at least another chapter after this one.
Purple Arrow: Maybe not the best version. Has Friday told you about what I’ve been doing over the last five years?
Me: Is Jane okay with you referring to my father like that in an interview?
It’s also the perfect place to bring other Fitz, Coulson and the person Leo refers to as The Rider, a.k.a. Robbie Reyes, back from the dead. Well not dead, but they are sort of in between dimensional planes at the moment. The Princess explained it to him on the way, but he didn’t quite get it. It involved a lot of discussions about the laws of thermodynamics and conservation of matter as well as dimensional theory. It all gave him a bloody headache.
HSBF: Oh God. Do I want to check Twitter right now?
Melinda: She was texting him about Clint showing up unexpectedly when he was supposed to be in Malibu with Nikki, which is what I assume to be a code name for Nate. She referred to Clint as her “estranged husband”. Also, apparently Stark now has an AI named ANA.
“Thank God.” Deke would be so happy.
Purple Arrow: I thought Friday was banned from telling you stuff?
Anthony: Definitely. It would’ve been nice to know enough to understand why people were shooting at my dad, in addition to knowing that they were doing it in the first place. I didn’t even know about his involvement in Shield until Fury broke into my house way back in 2009.
Me: I should never have gotten drunk with you.
Anthony: No, you needed to. I’m sure you would just apologize for who knows what because you’re such a Boy Scout. Although that doesn’t give her the right to threaten you.
Me: But thanks to her, the NSA and SHIELD shouldn’t be able to read this anymore.
Me: I wasn’t planning for him to be there, but he should. I’ll ask him after the robot burning. I’ll let you know how things go in a few days. Also, if I can guarantee she’s no longer reading these text messages, we can do doctor Suarez’s consent exercise.
Melinda: There’s no easy way to ease somebody into waking up in the future, although this reality is slightly less dystopic than the earth being cracked apart.
Me: By tricking them into replacing me with my perfect choice without them realizing it. Friday, Jane will release the press release regarding my daughter Afia. The Wakanda embassy will collaborate.
“I was told I died last time.”
“Sorry, I just realize we’re going to need your new boyfriend,” The Princess said with fake innocence.
This letter was written a few hours after the last one before Tony’s fun dinner with his friends, but was not read until the next day. You’ll see.
“Do you want me to leave?” Tony asked worried.
Counselor Laura: Not you, my Tony. I don’t know what happened here completely. No one wants to tell me because I may have passed out when I found out my children are dead here.
Anthony: I am too, but I still miss you.
Me: After. I think there’s a good chance that I may be going directly from the airport to the taping. I may not even be able to text you first. Although Friday will send you an email or something.
Blue phone: Thank you for not going to the tabloids about it. I don’t mind if people know but I want it to be on my terms. Also, I don’t like tabloids.
“I only watch what I say around the kids and over the comms. Curse words should be reserved for when things really go FUBAR.”
“Just doing what my country asked me to do. BTW honey bear, you are not necessarily a fugitive right now. Mostly because most countries won’t extradite you. I would just like to thank whoever’s brilliant ideal it was to give Nomad and the secret Avengers credit for saving my ass from the Watchdogs and getting the power back on. Really, it made all of us look good. Also, Malta has your back.”
PS: I think May is making you some get well cookies. I’ll try to get rid of them before they’re delivered. Sorry, Uncle Ben did all the cooking before.
This is Stefan, Tony’s new boyfriend. Well, I think I’m his new boyfriend. It’s complicated when you’re in another country and you’re mostly dating by correspondence. Although I don’t expect Tony to send me a Dear John letter any time soon. I hope not, at least. I saw that too many times during the war.
MayMQ: That’s not a hard promise to keep.
Counselor Laura from 2023: And you want me to get the science team here together? We were going to try to do another meeting soon but I think Tony and I are going to have other things that we’re gonna need to talk about first and we might have to postpone.
Agent Laura: I am glad you and Steve had a real conversation, even if you needed help from the New York Times. How many questions did you get through?
Anthony: Gabriel had Michelle sometime in the 60s before he was killed, leaving Michelle to be raised by Peggy and Daniel. Michelle had Sharon after a disastrous relationship that was MIT legend. So technically Sharon is Peggy’s great grandniece and you made out with her at Aunt Peggy’s funeral.
The Big Boss: Among other things. They're happy that you did it on a Saturday, but they're worried about what the stocks will do come Monday. I think they’re hoping for something big to happen in the interim, that will make people forget about it.
Me: This phone is going in the river later. Text your boyfriend.
Me: Also speaking of standing up for what you believe in, congratulations on punching out that asshole. If he does press charges, you know the legal team has your back.
“I’ll just go put on a shirt,” Hunter sighed in acquiescence.
HSBF: Point.
Me: I think I’m going to have trouble falling asleep tonight because I’ve gotten so used to that.
HSBF: OK, point.
“Yes, but I did bring a toothbrush. Over the last few months I feel like I’ve started to actually get to know you and I think I know how your mind works enough to know that you think you might be the consolation prize."
HSBF: But what if Ross got to him instead? What would he have done to a 15-year-old with spider powers?
“That is for the best.” That doesn’t surprise him.
Skye quake: I accidentally walked in on them after my horrible press conference that Mace made me do.
“Done.” The AI replied. She sounds a little like Friday, but younger.  “Afia, I also made this your new wallpaper.”
Me: Afia?
Me: Yes, and on to the other place as well to hang out with her princess friend. May is coming as well for both although the boyfriend will be coming back to the states before we begin our second leg. Somebody has to watch the agency and Mack wants to take his girlfriend down to Florida to meet his parents for Christmas. It’s a big step in their relationship.
Me: Because I think Rice is more qualified. Most of my diplomatic experience involves getting you out of jail in various countries.
BITC: What do you mean that Daisy is missing? Also, why are you the one sending me this text message? Where is MJ?
The Princess Anotations
Anthony love: It’s been less than an hour, but I am concerned. Mainly because I’ve been informed that you’re no longer actually on Earth as of five minutes ago.
Anthony: I’m talking to you right now in case it really is a kidnapping. Although that probably isn’t the case since they told me to bring exercise attire.
(See the end of the chapter for
Anthony love: Because May was already freaking out with her boyfriend missing in a very May way. Joey, Bobbi, the sister-in-law, and Vision will be heading over there to investigate after playing for the cameras in Mumbai. Actually, Bobbi is on her way now because she can’t be on camera due to Russian government issues.
Purple Princess 2018: I can tell Friday not to differentiate the label between Leo and Fitz.
Anthony: Which was absolute bullshit. I’d already had my first kidnapping by that point. It would’ve been nice to know that people were after me because my daddy was a spy that people wanted dead and not because of being heir to the Stark Empire
Happy Bear: You didn’t fall off the wagon did you?
“You can’t read that book. Friday can,” Leo explained.
Me: Yes. I already have everything planned out.
But just to clarify, the italicized text was Tony sneakily typing on Laura’s Avenger report share document.
HSBF: I think at this point I’m just going to wish you luck.
Ana Jr.: And by fix things, you mean undoing the snap?
Nomad: Maybe I had a bit of a crush on you earlier than I thought.
Also another reminder Steve doesn’t know that Melinda Gardner and Agent Melinda May a.k.a. agent scary are the same person. Tony is kind of afraid to tell him that. I am now accepting guesses on when and how Steve figures this out.
Melinda: But you need to fix things with Tony. It’s been seven years, and you’ve never worked through your guilt regarding what happened.
Me: Don't you think it's a waste of your limited resources to be chasing after somebody who just wants to help people?
Red phone: Lila punched me, multiple times. It's all my fault that they didn't get to go waterskiing.
Agent M: Yes. I’ll keep you posted.
“After we fix things,” Steve said, surprising Tony.
TMNS: Actually, so did [redacted], but differently. Which led to him telling everybody that I was friends with Spider-Man and forcing me to make an appearance at Liz’s party. MJ has been the only one who hasn’t freaked out about it. She just casually mentioned it in a conversation.
Tony Potts: That’s what happens when you lose half your population. There’s been a lot of immigration from other countries, but there’s still a lot of space in Manhattan.
Counselor Laura: She also feels fixing the universe is more important. This is what happens when you’re ex shield.
Counselor Laura: Although Miles is the son of two of your employees who are doing a special rebuilding project in Puerto Rico and Dr. Stark-Rogers is taking care of him in the interim.
HSBF: Why? She didn't give your allergy information to the Watchdogs or something like that? Why would she do that?
Tony: Yes, to everything. I mean, it wasn’t the worst dinner I’ve ever had, but it’s definitely in the top 12.
“Just Stark,” Simmons remarked.
Me: That reminds me, when you get back from whichever country you’re in, the President wants to set up a meeting with you. I don’t know what country you’re in because Piper won’t tell me for security reasons.
“Friday, show me the video?” She asked the AI, not expecting a reply.
Me: Or maybe they just really want Stefan to be you because they’re so invested in our possible relationship. You can never tell with the shippers. They can be a little vicious and sometimes they forget that we are real people. Never read the RPF stuff. It’s as bad as the Captain America radio hour except more pornographic. Some of it’s good porn, but it’s weird when it’s about you.
Red phone: Just to make it more authentic; boxers, briefs or commando?
“You are the best.”
Counselor Laura from 2023: Me and Dr. Potts are also concerned. Tony and Steve moved an entire mini bar out of the lab and had to reinstate the breathalyzer protocol yesterday.
Venom: I’m not at all interested in MJ. It would be impossible for me to be any less interested in her in a romantic capacity.
“And our stupidity paralyzed him. Fitz and I are working on something, but it’s still in the prototype phase.”
All depictions of the U.S. Department of State are fictional.
Red phone: He's trying to find me a therapist that I’m going to have to see at least once a week. If I say no, he will send me to the crazy spa.
Subject: What happened in Mumbai?
“It’s a little different,” Steve argued.
Me: Not really. What does it say about me that one vision of Cuddle Bunny dying in my arms made me create murder bots?
Boss: Math is not everything. Friday, please begin executing Operation Relocate Therapist.
MJ: You better. I’m very curious about you fighting Loki.
"I wouldn’t say that’s what I’m thinking. Did you borrow my toothpaste?" Tony asked pulling away. He was extra minty fresh.
Chief mechanic: Do you know that in the other timeline, you’re Vice President? That’s like one of the few nice things going on there.
Chocolate gift bags already ordered. The larger version was waiting on my doorstep before I even woke up. I thank Friday for that.
“I watched Peter die in my arms. That was the second time something like that has happened to me and it didn’t make it any less awful.”
The first thing she did was run up to him to wrap her arms around her Fitz and kissed him till they were both breathless.
Thank you to everybody who read reviewed the last section. You’re also fabulous. We are back in the darkest timeline. Well, maybe not the darkest timeline. I think the sacred timeline is darker, but it isn’t sunshiny here either. WandaVision is making me reevaluate things. (This reevaluation continued with the release of Falcon and the Winter Soldier. Tony’s actions in this story may have prevented the Power Broker. Don’t even get me started on What If.)
HSBF: Sorry, continue.
I really am sorry for my actions last spring. I’m well aware that I hurt Tony. I think you’re well aware of how far you will go to protect a friend. It’s even more complicated when both parties involved are your friend. I didn’t want to hurt Tony, but I did anyway. If I could do it all over again, I would make different choices, but you can’t change the past. You can only learn from it and rebuild the bridges that you burned down.
To: MJ_Watson
Friday: I hate to interrupt but Ms. Watson needs to speak with you right away. She apparently just received a request from the office of the King of Wakanda. His staff would like to arrange a meeting between you and various representatives from Wakanda during his state visit next week. Ms. Watson would like to discuss this with you before scheduling.
To be continued.
Agent Laura: I guess I have something else to work on. Although now I want to know who Carol is? Robin 2018 has been telling us we need her for the last year. Coulson doesn’t remember who she is because Nikki messed with his memories.
HSBF: I thought you didn’t take a Quinjet because you needed this to look like work travel. Didn’t you also do a meeting before heading back to the states?
Tony: Because it means we’re going to succeed?
Nomad: I don’t think their intent was malicious. I think they just wanted to keep you a sweet little kid, as long as they could.
Time sent: 11/12/2016 10:04:12
Me: Well I’m always very distracting, especially in a nice three-piece suit.
Blue phone: I’ll be more careful in the future and use the new gear. How are you going to get me the gear? I can’t exactly go back to your island.
Rogers: But I’m still concerned. I keep seeing things in the news about the watchdogs or senator that keep saying nasty things about her own constituents just because they’re different. I can’t remember her name, but she is just filled with hate.
But Romanoff is there, staring into his soul, trying to read into him. It’s something that she’s been doing for almost the last week. Sam is doing it too. And really, Tony, is just glad they decide to do this in the hotel room instead of downstairs at the café. Being who he is, the paparazzi would be there in a second. He knows they smell the blood in the water, thanks to the Pepper breakup.
Tony: And now we know that we’ll just tell the reporter that we’re most thankful for each other and that we have yet to screw up our relationship totally.
D: Did you sleep last night? You can’t be mad at somebody for something that happened in the other timeline.
Counselor Laura: And he knew how traumatized you were by what Tiberius did and didn’t want any of your personal messages to be used like that against you.
Steve: But I wasn’t there when he needed me.
The new consultant: Did you faint? You’re not drinking again, are you? I worry about you.
SimmonsJA: I am glad that your therapy is working in that regard. You may want to listen to your therapist when she says that you are neither emotionally nor physically, especially physically, ready to engage in a sexual encounter with your boyfriend.
Xxxxx
“I think it was the happiest day I had since the snap. So what is your most treasured memory?” Steve asked.
"Late since it's about 5 AM here."
Anthony: It wasn’t a complete lie. Melinda Gardner is her public identity, the only one she has left after the Hydra fiasco. I just decided to wait a little while before I explained that Agent Scary, Agent May and your ex-girlfriend are the same person.
“Okay, so your daughter may have convinced me that real estate was where I should make some major investments, especially because things were so cheap post-snap. I might have acquired about 15% of the greater New York area. I should probably tell my people to make places habitable because we're going to need shelter if we're bringing everyone back soon."
Anthony: Do you love me anyway?
way of compensating
(See the end of the chapter for
Me: Mostly because you don’t assume that Cuddle Bunny’s alter ego must be a paragon of heterosexuality. Although, how do you know they're fake? We’re separated by an entire ocean and a lot of political bullshit. We need to do something to keep the spark alive.
D FitzSimmons: One big happy multi-verse family.
StarkAE: Yes. He’s been fitted with a wonderful Tom Ford suit this morning. I have at least two dozen pictures for private time.
Counselor Laura: He also won’t stop hugging me or crying.
Xxxxx
“I like the vows hey use during the seven steps.” Steve told Tony while they were sitting at their table more than an hour later. The ceremonial part of the wedding was over and they were now mingling.
Cuddle Bunny: This is more of you sacrificing yourself for the greater good?
Me: Do you think she’ll actually stop?
Me: Except sign the Accords.
Skye quake: OK we definitely have to make another AI to take Friday’s place, now that she’s a real girl.
Venom: Sufficiently advanced scientific Technology is indistinguishable from magic or something like that?
Anthony: Of course the tabloids don’t know about that, so that did not affect the stock and I’m sure the board of directors are so sad about that. Although I’m sure they’re happy that me signing myself out AMA also made the stocks go up five points because apparently I must be okay if I’m being reckless. I’m rolling my eyes.
To: The Mechanic
Anthony: You’re doing a really good job without knowing those things. So apparently you’re afraid of fantasies not living up to reality and since I’m a 46-year-old recovering from a heart condition, reality is probably going to be harsh. Also, I’m a bit of a Bastard.
Counselor Laura: Good because you have some notes to write about everything you know regarding what Simmons did. I need to get back to my kids, and I need your help.
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last chapter. You are absolutely wonderful.
(See the end of the chapter for
HSBF: I’m not surprised.
The Mechanic: I’m even going through the process to become a certified foster parent for those with powers. I don’t think it’s going to happen because even with my money, no social worker in their right mind would approve me, but I’m working on it.
Agent M: Tranquilizer arrows?
“No, it didn’t. I love Pepper. A part of me will always love Pepper, but we are not right for each other. I’m willing and able to acknowledge that now to myself, but I wasn’t quite ready until this weekend to tell Happy that Pepper and I are never ever getting back together because I fell in love with you. Not Captain America, but Steve from Brooklyn."
Nomad: It was Clint's idea. Maybe Ross will be less likely to set traps for me if he thinks Stefan Carter is a real person. Also I feel like you deserve roses and chocolate.
“Yes. At South Ridge Penitentiary outside of Los Angeles yesterday. There are also reports of inmates seeing ghosts as well as the vigilante Quake being in the facility.” Karen told the two. “Shield was trying to keep the incident quiet but information leaked earlier this morning.”
“Exactly. I’m sure a few have reacted badly to me being your boyfriend but not to the fact you have a boyfriend.”
https://archiveofourown.org/works/32662519
HSBF: But you are working on it?
Me: I'm sure the forensic accountants that I just hired are going to discover all sorts of fun and possibly illegal discrepancies. They’ve already found a few, considering the indictment.
“At least she got a lot of vitamin C and calcium. Robin went through that phase. Heaven help you if you accidentally get the wrong cheese stick.” Steve added.
Rogers: I think she’s mad at me and therefore not answering my questions.
May: Clint was disappointed. He swore up and down it would be Natasha. I also found out that in the other timeline, Daisy is dating Natasha.
Blue phone: Has Tony locked himself in his lab? Is he that afraid to tell me that he is sexually attracted to me? I don’t hate the idea. It’s just maybe we need to work on being friends first. He was right earlier. We are kind of broken and we need to fix that before anything else.
HSBF: Happy?
Your boyfriend also wrote me to express his well wishes. It was attached to the edible arrangement. Let him know I appreciate it. I would write myself, but I don't have his email address. Anyway, we can talk more when we see each other Monday.
Thankfully, years as a mom and a guidance counselor made her an expert at typing one-handed while cuddling someone crying. You’ll be amazed at how often she had to utilize this skill before.
Me: Good luck.
HSBF: But like I said on one of the questions, you do learn from your mistakes. Do you want to go over a question or two tonight or let it go?
“That’s a given. The last time he saw me I was trying to kill him for one of his past sins that he committed under Hydra mind fuck. Thanks to my lovely falling down moment we probably will not see each other until the end of the world is actually in progress and maybe not even then,” Tony sighed.
“Because most of us were coming up here for the anniversary party since Fitzsimmons work out of this facility now.” Because Simmons is three months pregnant and outside of Fitz and her doctor, only Tony knows and therefore assigned her someplace far away from the chaos.
Me: Or why Nomad has gear that carries the hallmarks of SI design. Actually, Friday, we better not send that message just in case someone’s intercepting this. I don’t want them to accidentally find out Steve’s new identity. (message not sent).
So why did the timeline change in 1955? Were there time travel shenanigans involved? If so, who was it? How did the diversions in the timeline bring us to where we are now? You’re just going to have to keep reading to find out.
4. You learn from your mistakes. A lot of people don’t. They just keep making them over and over again. That’s not you. You acknowledge them. You now know you made a wrong call in bringing Benji to Germany and you’re trying to do better now. It takes a big person to not only acknowledge their mistakes, but learn from them.
Me: I’m also currently a war criminal.
Anthony: Coulson is the asshole who manipulated me into going to New York to keep Ross from putting the abomination in the Avenger initiative. He knows what he’s doing. Oh God, I still hope that he is frozen in Alaska. Definitely not someone I want as a teammate.
Me: You outed yourself as a superhero.
Basically, Yo-Yo stole Tony’s phone before he even realized she took it and sent Steve a message. Super speed is awesome.
“I only showed you the most important ones. I will answer the rest.” Ana replied. That makes sense because he has 285 unread messages between his two accounts.
“Maybe, but I think I'm also using her as a buffer.”
“Yes, after we talk for a few minutes first about what you found out from the princess when she visited you in New York.” Of course they were going to have this conversation first.
Cuddle bunny: It's appropriate
Yes, another interlude. This chapter takes place about 12 hours after the last one. The incident at the party happened less than 24 hours earlier. I promise Tony will be up soon, but this conversation has to happened. I find it deeply ironic that it happens in interlude 13.
Anthony love: Mr. President, yesterday, my boyfriend and the other Avengers team that you’re not supposed to know about saved us from aliens. These aliens were trying to invade earth to extract all our resources before the other alien coming to kill us all gets here. He doesn’t want to kill us all just half of us by turning them to dust—literally, dust.
To be continued
Tony: It’s been a bad couple of days for the DOS spokesperson.
MayMQ: In Clint’s case, he had the kids to think about, which is the same reason why he’s going to play Talbot’s game now. But he cared about you greatly as well. He was as big a mess as me after New York and it wasn’t just because of the mind control.
“To get a hold of the company again for war profiteering purposes or possibly to help Ross with his hidden agenda. It wouldn’t be the first time around.” Steve just stared at Tony for a moment, mouth open in surprise.
Me: But she was BFFs with Jarvis, human Jarvis, until he died when I was 25.
“Brooklyn Vision Academy was not as lucky.” Tony finished for Steve. It was, unfortunately, a very common story.
Chief Mechanic: So, after that, Simmons and the grandkid join a group called Guardians of the Galaxy to look for Monkey Lover 3.
HSBF: You played it off as a joke?
“I fucking hate Hydra," Steve exclaimed angrily.
this year and she wants to be with her family.
HSBF: No, you don’t.
HSBF: Maybe the president wants to nominate you. Maybe that’s why he wants to meet with you.
Cuddle Bunny: Why would you suggest Agent May? Why do you think that I would be able to work with her?
Me: The fact that you hung out with his grandpa just makes it weirder especially considering that you were only a year or two older than said grandchild biologically.
Daisy really should be in Mumbai for the final negotiations and signing because she is one of the chief negotiators, being a top member of the ATCU and a member of the group that the document will protect. But she is friends with Polly and Robin, and the little girl let something slip during their last video call. Which led to Daisy coming to New York instead, claiming that Joey can do just as well as her during the negotiations. He is a member of the UN Avengers as well now.
Me: But at least I got four hours last night before the nightmares started.
"My story is in the history books."
BITC: I was nowhere near that good of a writer at her age. I’m just being encouraging.
Me: Now you’re actually contacting me. I’ve been trying to call you for the last 3 days. Do you have any idea how many text messages and emails I’ve left you? Did you throw your phone into the ocean again? Agent Piper said that Steve was hit. Is he okay?
HSBF: Why is Sharon there?
Tosha: I know you feel guilty because you’re here, and they are not. It always hurts when you’re the one left behind.
Counselor Laura: Fingers crossed; we will get me home.
“You’re going back to America? You haven’t been back that long. Are you going back to check up on your friend?” James asked.
This chapter is coming out a day early because I will be busy tomorrow.
“I will make arrangements,” The AI replied.
From: Pepper_Pot
Red phone: Tell Clint that his wife is pissed because Ross has diplomatic insecurity… security and the Marines are staking out her house and following her to school.
The Boy in the Chair: What about Friendly Neighborhood Spider?
“It is hard to believe but I do believe you,” she gave him one last squeeze before pulling away.
"I was expecting to spend the day you bounce back from the future in bed, celebrating the fact that you haven't suddenly disappeared from reality." After dating for 16 months, Leo knew that was his boyfriend's biggest fear. Leo's as well. If he really thought about it. But today's the day, and he is still here.
This conversation takes place only a couple of hours after the last one and just an hour or two before Clint lands in Palau. You know what that means. Grab a tissue, this chapter gets intense.
Rogers: If Tony created it, anything’s possible. Also, Tony is highly frustrating.
This chapter takes place about three days after the last one because Steve doesn’t want to seem overly needy. Okay, it took Steve two days to get his phone back because Clint stole it to get back at Tony for not telling him about Laura. He’s still not happy.
Number one May: Are there any adults there with you? Olivia is coming over to do a home date since we have Miles, but I don't mind coming up to the Lighthouse.
"Speaking of children, the next question is if you can change anything about how you grew up, what would you change?”
Now Tony has been through enough uncomfortable business lunches, breakfasts, and dinners to know how to get through any type of meal with people who completely hate him without it disintegrating into complete and other chaos. So, he’s sure he can get through this. Especially when he’s almost sure only Romanoff actually hates him. And even then, sometimes he wonders if it’s just a strong dislike.
HSBF:  It's still good advice.
Genius Princess: I'll come to get you. I'll be there in about 70 minutes. Be ready.
Anthony: I should be happy that at least you are now self-aware. Please stop doing stupid stuff.
Tony: Of course, she texted you.
Nomad: I don't either. Is he really OK?
So, apparently, I made you cry. I didn’t want to do that. I just wanted you to realize how serious things were. Being a superhero is not a video game. You don’t get extra lives usually. Sorry I used one of my father’s techniques to express how dangerous the situation really was. You’ll be happy to know that your aunt threatened to kill me. Don’t worry. I deleted the message from every server known to mankind and put a fake one in its place. (And Friday will be deleting this part of the email after you read it). I told your aunt that there was a lab accident that you were responsible for and that’s why you came home in the Free Quake T-shirt. Please corroborate.
“If things go well, you’ll know what I mean sometime within the next 48 hours.”
FRIDAY: Yes
Me: You scanned all of your dad’s diaries?
Counselor Laura: I think Friday may have talked you into that too because she was working with Leo to fix things. At the same time, I think I needed a friend as much as you did back then, and that's why we bonded. My Tony did, anyway. We did become friends, and I think our friendship helped him work through a lot of his other issues. This included mending fences with his Steve, staying sober, and getting diagnosed correctly.
Anthony: I would also be okay. Not ready to share. I have some therapy letters that Dr. Suarez had me write under about 20 layers of encryption. I get that you may not be ready to share.
"I didn’t say yes." Tony said taking the seat beside Steve. “Especially because I’m sure the asshole who suggested it is golf buddies with Ross.”
“Despite the spy wife and the teenage daughter, I’m not that good with technology even if the decimation has slowed things down. I uploaded the wrong picture, and even Avenger Friday couldn’t save me." That blush told Tony he was lying, but he won't push.
Hunter: Yes.
Me: Really, Snookums just doesn’t want to have to read my pornographic declarations, especially when he knows that they’re fake.
“ I have a impulse purchase problem,” Tony remarked.
Friday: You are still misleading.
"Saying goodbye to Andrew when I would leave for a mission was always the hardest part." Melinda confessed.
"No conversation with the Board of Directors is pleasant. Any conversation where I have to cover for Happy using Rhodey’s new job is even less so. The fact that I think one of them arranged for someone to leak candid shots of what happened makes it so much worse." Tony sighed as he took a drink from the large coffee in his hand. That was his 3
Me: I just really want you to like my boyfriend. We have been friends for a really long time and I value and trust your opinion. I don’t like fighting with you.
Anthony: PTSD and depression and other things mixed in there along with the substance abuse issues. I’m not okay. I’m nowhere near okay. I tried to murder someone because he killed my mom, but I’m getting better.
“You would,” Steve answered simply.
HSBF: They’re not very flattering. Also, I’m better at reading Russian then I thought I was.
Boss: Good. Is the superhero daddy even on the same continent as Cuddle Bunny?
Red phone: Which explains why I haven’t been carried off in handcuffs yet.
Cuddle fiancé: We’re fine. We have Coulson, although Hal is dead.
Tony: So Friday knows pretty much everything about me, including that the state of New York decided that I’m totally unfit to have a child as well as what happened to my sperm count. So she decided to fix it. And the Princess helped.
Anthony: Contrary to what some you think; I’m not using the foundation to find dates. That would be creepy. I am trying to find the next great mind where ever that could be. My grandfather had a fruit stand and my grandmother was a seamstress. My father discovered his engineering prowess by making her sewing machine more efficient when he was six years old. Greatness can come from the most humble of beginnings. I’m doing my best to nurture that greatness where ever it may be found.
Counselor Laura: [image one attached]
Me: So, to make up for it, I said I would do the interview and you’re going to have to help because you are the one who said no press conferences for Benji. Therefore, you and I are going to ask each other the 36 questions that lead to love and then come up with answers that we are completely willing to give in public. It will just be like playing 21 questions again except we’re provided with possible questions. Actually, this may go better.
CoulsonPJ: Maybe it is. Send me pictures from the dinner.
You probably resent me because if I was not around then Tony and Pepper would have found their way back to each other or at least you feel like it would play that way. But deep down, I think you know that the relationship was not this perfect ideal that you have in your head. It never was. And I don’t think my presence changes that. Maybe it was just a catalyst to make the explosion happen sooner rather than later.
“I’m scared of losing Morgan too,” Tony confessed. “It’s why I said no the first time when you asked. I didn’t even consider that there was a way to bring everybody back but not lose what we’ve gained.”
Me: I can’t believe you of all people are lecturing me about letting go of the past.
Me: First, I made that phone so I couldn’t find you unless you wanted me to. In the event of an emergency, you can hit the yellow button and I could find you, but you’re the one who has to initiate the rescue Steve protocol.
HSBF: She could just use Friday as her superhero codename. Maybe Ms. Friday.
Anthony: Yo-Yo heard rumors about the guy who murdered her cousin being out and about on U.S. soil making deals with the Watchdogs. I may have helped her find Intel on this, but apparently I’m not as stealthy as I think I am because Agent Scary is now coming with us to New York to give us spy lessons.
BITC: What?
Purple Princess 2018: We will have to do another all-hands meeting to discuss the idea with the stones. Dad and Steve will be back at 2 PM our time, but I'll try to get everyone else on board. I think we can do another meeting then.
Nomad: I don’t need a therapist. I’m okay.
Morgan’s dad: From what I can make out of her notes, the monolith particles were somehow involved like you originally theorized. That is something I know nothing about because Simmons was doing all the research on that. Unfortunately, her notes are very incoherent—lots of stuff about doctors, butterflies, and somebody named Flint. Who is Flint?
Nomad: Now what I don’t understand is why you created a cover for me that involves me being the stepdad of someone I’ve actually kissed. Why did you do that?
P Parker: There are two adults in the room with me right now. We are fine, May.
“I still could. Ana likes me,” Afia replied with a smirk.
"Mostly because I thought that Sharon was the first time he's connected with anybody romantically since the 40s. I would've behaved differently if I knew about Melinda. So he really was close to Sharon's great aunt?"
"I wish it could wait, but unfortunately some things in life actually have deadlines even for people with my resources and the wedding venue is one of those things. BTW, I'm still mad I can't be there because the president decided that Coulson should be the ATCU representative, not me." That was because everybody knew that he was dating Steve and have for a while. Fuck you, Christine Everhart. So he had to stay hands-off with the negotiations to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest, but thankfully he had a good team.
HSBF: Then no childhood.
Me: Well you just go for the jugular. No, hi, how are you doing? You don’t even bother to tell me your side of what happened Saturday night. All I have are Agent Agent’s reports and things now former staff members leaked to Twitter.
Subject: Call Pepper Pot. She’s pissed off at all of us
TMNS: Why did Agent Coulson give a fake name?
Acronym guide:
Friday: Unlike sand, bedrock cannot be washed away by the waves of hardship.
Me: I’m starting to maybe like Yo-Yo. I definitely need more people in my life that don’t take bullshit from anybody. I also think this is a disaster waiting to happen. But thanks to her one woman campaign against various Colombian drug lords, it is probably best for my new teammate to be under the protection of the Stark lawyers.
Me: This is why I hate politics and politicians.
Nomad: I was joking. Pulp Fiction was on the list but Sam said that Tarantino is overrated and a couple words I can’t repeat so I haven’t watched it.
Me: Yes, I did. So good news, the government of Malta is still not a party to the current version of the Accords. And they’re not planning to consider signing until the renegotiations start next year. So Malta house is now the official headquarters of the Secret Avengers. I’m planning to move an extra Quinjet there soon. Plus, Agent America has a friend that may join you, if you’re OK with that. The Russian government kind of hates her. Ask Lily’s aunt to tell you about Agent 19.
StarkAE: You are going to have to ask Agent America that one when she gets back to the Playground.
Steve: I hate it when you do this.
Venom: You should because I’m perfectly OK if you want to date both of us at the same time. Just give me a week or two to recover from the idiot boyfriend.
StarkAE: Great. My AI has a crush on a taken shield agent and Spidey still being heroic, even though he’s grounded. I bet he didn’t call for backup either.
Tony: Tried twice. I’m improving. My opening line is no longer Fuck you.
HSBF: What are you doing today?
Me: Lily ran up to me and held on to my pant leg as they actually dragged me away. She was screaming the entire time. Corey may have kicked one of the officers in the genitals.
Anthony: You’re telling me to give in? That’s weird.
I also want to mention that this is where our story diverges greatly from the end of Spider-Man: Homecoming. Blame it on the therapy and the new boyfriend. Tony knows better than to pull anything he did in upstate New York. Again, that doesn’t happen in this universe except Tony does make that suit because Peter needs bubblewrap.
“I’m grateful that she saved you.  We were trying to retrofit The Zephyr to come to get you with stolen Hydra/alien technology. Unfortunately, we were not going fast enough for me," Steve acknowledged.
Me: Yes, but Agent Agent would not be happy and I’m pretty sure he could kill you with a paperclip. Or at least choke you. He has a black belt in practically everything including Brazilian jujitsu.
Venom: I can see that happening.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Spider: We walked in on Iron dad performing fellatio on Cap Dad in the home theater. Peter says he hasn’t been this embarrassed since his aunt tried to tell him about Liv from college after she walked in on the two of you with Peter’s shirt off. He said no child wants to know anything about their parental figures sex lives.
Genius Princess 2018: We are grateful to establish contact with you after you were missing for 39 hours. We have unfortunately not been as successful with Agent Johnson. We have yet to receive any communications from her.
HSBF: Is that allowed under the Accords?
Me: Is the Framework that training simulation you were working on when you were in Appalachia?
“If I share something extremely embarrassing that has never made it to the tabloids, will you tell me the real story behind the Instagram incident?” Tony asked.
Me: So you seem like the type of person who would want something they couldn’t regularly have so that’s why I think you would choose Bucky or a well Peggy.
TMNS: You are aware that Daisy’s missing. That’s the big problem.
Blue phone: If you read what you sent me, you would know that you didn’t send any pictures of your privates, this time.
CoulsonPJ: Yes and yes. It suffered some damage during his use.
Me: Are we going to do more questions?
Xxxxx
Conversation 29: Warning Messages
“Did everybody realize that they were in love with each other but each other?” Daisy asked.
Cuddle Bunny: You really need to stop with the passive aggressive behavior
I’m planning for us to have shorter chapters again, which might mean weekly updates. I’m going to try at least.
HSBF: I never doubted that you were smart. I did question if you had any common sense on occasion.
FRIDAY: There was a mention of the report existing in one of the Hydra files that I am decrypting
“That’s probably for the best. I’m sure he probably asked me what color underwear I’m wearing,”  Leo groused.
“Then I can be honest and tell you that the future Dr. Stark-Rogers can’t get confirmed because he’s fucking a guy, although up until yesterday that man was a wanted fugitive. I hope the Mumbai agreement was still signed yesterday in light of my disappearance.” Steve responded with a sigh. Thankfully he didn’t ask about the Mumbai agreement.
“Love you too,” He said as he pulled away and grabbed his bag. He didn’t look back, because if he did he would have burst into tears. He did still cry but at least he made it to the Quinjet.
Nomad: Wait, are they actually devoting an entire hour to talk about your break up with Pepper when there's so much else going on in the world?
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last chapter. I am totally appreciating the irony of this turning out to be conversation 13. Originally it was conversation, 11, but somehow it got moved to 13 because Tony and Steve have so much to talk about. I’m hoping to return to shorter chapters soon.
“It’s been well documented in your files. Sometimes, I’m surprised you survived the army without getting court-martialed for insubordination.” The director remarked.
Tony: I agree since it had so many bad memories together. OK, I think I have my happy memory.
“I hope you did too," Steve remarked.
HSBF: Now that there’s two, it’s an option?
“The time involving the goat was funny.”
Cousin Q: Ned would probably do it voluntarily.
Melinda: Of course, he is.
“Vision had a will. He didn’t want to be resurrected or get turned into a science experiment.” Tony explained. “I think he knew about what happened to Agent. Vision didn't want that to happen to him. This is why we're suing the hell out of Sword for the stunt they pulled in Wakanda. They were essentially grave robbing."  Tony sounded furious.
“Because he came across kids that needed him. So what’s your bad news?” Steve asked.
Me: Yes. All you need is just one dirty cop.
To be continued…
“It’s the medication and the therapy.” He argued.
Me: OK, cuddle bunny, are you jealous of the fact that Aunt Peggy moved on and found the love of her life in someone else?
Nomad: He threatened your kids again?
Me: Also, I don’t even have to look at the rest of this chain to know that the friend thing is a polite lie. I don’t need polite lies.
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last conversation. You are so lovely. Welcome back to the “we made better choices” timeline.
Me: I’m already counting down the days but I’ll make it. I hope.
Tony: I have been studying time travel theory for decades and I’m still extremely confused.
Happy Bear: I shouldn’t be trying to push you to get back with Virginia especially when you’re dating someone else. I just wanted her with someone better than that asshole. I punched him by the way.
Anthony: No. Actually, I think my assistant burned them and the stupid card. They didn’t even have the decency to have an intern sign it. Also, if they’re sending out everybody a card that reads, “we’re sorry for your illness or incapacitation, and cannot wait until you are able to be a productive member of the SI family again”, we are seriously fucked as a company.
Pepper pot: The wine is an option, but Hunter just ate the last of my chocolate stash.
"I tried to kill him."
Steve: We need a better organization. I don’t trust SWORD.
Counselor Laura: I'm not sure how to start that conversation.
Tony Potts: Then, nowhere in your universe is safe. I was on another planet in a completely different solar system. I still watched Peter disappear in my arms.
“Alive, dead, or dusted?”
Genius Princess: You have to be the leader to change things. We need to take the threat seriously.
“Again, even though text messages are a better way for us to communicate because it gives us time to think through what we say and the princess genius has upgraded my encryption by like 9000% there are somethings I just can’t text message to you, Sugar Lips.” He gave Steve a quick kiss to the lips.
Counselor Laura: That could work. It’s something to work on before the next call or, rather, text message session. Friday, are they trying to get voice? I really would like to hear my kids.
Me: You’re not even touching my second text.
Red phone: If I didn't intervene, the kid would be fighting crime in a red sweater with goggles. Or worse, he could be in one of the ATCU gel matrixes
Me: Spidey Senior needs me and it gives Afia a chance to see how she blends in with teenagers that are not royalty. Actually, the princess is going to be there. She wanted to stay until Friday to experience the American concept of Thanksgiving. But her brother said no. So she’s flying back in the morning after the meeting with Jane.
Anthony: Technically, yes, but she’s still brilliant.
FRIDAY: No, they moved you into the apartment next door to Agent May to entice her to leave human resources to return to fieldwork. The goal was for her to be your partner, but because of your sexual relationship with her, they assigned Natasha to work with you instead. And she was assigned to assist with Agent Coulson’s reintegration. Now Agent May is in charge of training new recruits at the reform SHIELD.
Tony: Okay, now I’m seriously regretting suggesting you go into therapy. I probably will write to Laura during my meeting with various French officials. I kind of would like her perspective on the Spidey thing before I have Monkey Lover take the suit out of lockup and delivered to Queens. Do you think she’ll actually answer back? I don’t think the ‘I’m so happy your back’ sex will take this long.
Anthony: You know, as soon as this is over, you’re going to have to sign the replacement trading cards that I found for him.
I just want to let all of you know that I will be on vacation and then moving over the course of the next three weeks. I have banked a few chapters (and some artwork that will probably drop Monday) so there will be some updates during this time, but I’m not sure when I will be able to post. I probably will not be responding to very many reviews after this weekend either until things calm down again.
: Wanda Maximoff, a.k.a. Scarlet Witch (media nickname). Stark sometimes refers to her as his daughter-in-law due to eloping with the Vision.
“This is me trying not to be antagonistic. Although I can always go back to DILTF?”
OK, now I’m going to be brave and see if I can move onto some of the next questions in set three which apparently is supposed to be where the real intimacy begins. Which makes sense for perfect strangers but we’re not that now. Also, I kind of wish we didn’t meet in the middle of a crisis so we could’ve done some icebreaker activities, you know, instead of trying to beat the shit out of each other due to Asgardian mind Fuck. I really wish it did not take Agent dying for our sins for us to get our shit together.
During New York, he went up against the bad guy by himself because he knew he needed to do it. Okay, me and Steve were in the middle of a pissing contest because we were being mind-fucked by alien tech. Coulson died that day. He got better, but his heart stopped for a while. Then years later, he lost a hand saving his entire team. No powers, no suit, just him. It’s not the suit, it’s what’s inside you. When you become Phil Coulson, then you’re ready for the suit.
Me: No
Anthony: Don’t forget about the possibly having sex with someone too drunk to consent. BTW that’s now considers sexual assault. Well at least he's making sure you see all the good stuff from the 80s. Princess Bride? Coming to America?
Me: Probably.
Morgan’s dad: Two apologies back to back. I’m going to have Friday frame this.
Red phone: The bureaus at the department that are doing what they're supposed to be doing are losing money because of his obsession.
Monkey lover 2: That is not the mission I’m referring to. What about the other two monoliths?
"I don't think I ever actually saw it as a real marriage because I always knew it was for custody of the kids. But I was furious at you for not coming to me to help with lawyers so you wouldn’t have to get married. Now I realize it was more nuanced than that."
HSBF: Tony, what the hell happened in New York? It’s all over the news.
“It’s hard to argue with royalty. How long do you think they will keep us locked up here?” Fitz asked.
Me: My mom telling me that she loves me for the last time before she died.
Red phone: I like the idea of science diplomacy. It's better than shooting my way through it.
Cuddle Bunny: That’s their problem, not yours.
Anthony: Yes, Coulson had them and I don’t want to know how he got them or what he did with them.
Nomad: Not knowing can be dangerous. I think I made that point clearer when we were talking about Queens two weeks ago.
Me: You said he said he was staying until everything was moved upstate. It’s going to take a week to do things as planned. There is a decoy plane flying out from the tower in probably a half an hour, then, everything will be carted upstate by armed trucks that look like innocent milk trucks driven by trained agents.
Thank you to everyone who read or reviewed the last chapter. This chapter takes place about two days after the last one. Hooray, more Tony and Steve time.
Me: Because when you have a certain amount of money, doctors don’t treat certain problems as well as they should or at all. They are more concerned with humoring a wealthy patient. Laura and my platypus are trying to find a psychiatrist that won’t care about my bank account.
“Language.” Tony joked.
Tony: I still can’t convince you to do text message sex, which is a shame because I really think underneath the sweet exterior you can be extra kinky. This may be because the listening thing is still a work in progress for us. Although, with a few more tweaks, Framework sex might be an option. Which, if the code works right, will be as good as the real thing.
Me: As long as they think the guy is straight anyway. The media can get fucked.
Me: I don’t trust any politician.
In regards to question 27, of course we are going to become friends because we already are friends who make out with each other. You really do know a lot more about me than anyone else. So yesterday, I was being totally incognito with Benji at a restaurant because I couldn’t send him to Queens on an empty stomach, after an actual mentoring session. So, somebody at the restaurant thought he was my son and a part of me really wanted that to be true. Not him in particular but to have a kid. Thanks to the Palladium poisoning not happening but that’s a nice Idea though. There’s always your sperm because I’m not sure if there is an adoption agency in the world that would give me a kid, despite my finances.
Cuddle bunny: But we were in no state to be called in because we are so fractured. Zemo won.
Counselor Laura: You must want to change. I don't think Simmons is ready yet.
However, before he could pull up the video, the suite went dark. Now, Tony has traveled through enough of the world, that the occasional blackout doesn’t surprise him. Although the fact that the hotel’s emergency power does not kick on does. His phone also starts beeping because apparently, it’s being continuously bombarded with an EMP every few seconds.
HSBF: That would be okay.
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last chapter. You’re all beautiful and keep me in the happy writing zone.
Me: Nope, because I’m staying in Manhattan and working out of the new New York offices that will be in the tower formally known as Avengers Tower. Which is good because I don’t want to live on top of Alchemax’s new New York offices. Thankfully, the computer geniuses intervened.
“Or we can talk about our last near-death experience and our biggest regret at the time. I'm sure you're going to say not getting that dance with Peggy." Tony remarked.
Anthony: I look good in everything and so do you.
Nomad: I thought things were better with Sharon after she helped you with Laura?
Cuddle fiancé: I got him a case of beer.
The Mechanic: Which is always quite an accomplishment.
StarkAE: I‘m probably gonna have to replace that. Thankfully, if you allow paparazzi to take shots of you in their cars, you get one for free. Also, driving lessons will be added to the training curriculum.
HSBF: You should.
HSBF: Me too.
“I’m sorry I took you from her.” Steve sounded genuinely remorseful.
"And yet Sam already knew." Natasha said before leaving.
Me: Okay, things went better once we were going up against the other guys together. I’m so sad that Agent Carter didn’t stay around for that.
Tony Bear: I’m not 100% sure it’s always been this bad. Maybe it feels worse this time around, because I’m too sober to think any of these jokes are funny or have any desire whatsoever to mingle. All the assistants were nicer and actually competent.
Tony: No, which is good because I have Fallon on Monday.
Purple Princess: OK, so alien invasion two Friday was Coulson getting abducted by aliens at the signing of the Mumbai agreement. Don’t worry, it’s been handled. They are absolutely terrified of my badass sister-in-law. Because she is awesome.
“I know," Natasha said, handing him a cookie.
Hunter:  I’m taking this off of group chat because I know you’re hiding something.
Agent Johnson: That's impossible. There is nowhere on Earth that isn't in the range of a Stark communications device.
“You’re so mean.” He said, making his way out of the vent because he knew she would follow through. Natasha does not make idle threats. “I just want to be alone. It’s been a hard couple of days.”
“Relocating to our own room because I don’t think Sam would be happy if we have sex on his bed or couch.” Steve told him.
Genius Princess: It would be my pleasure.
Melinda: To the point where the two of you are engaged one month before Thanos arrived in our timeline.
Me: I’m okay. I had breakfast
Me: Oh God, I can see it. I’ve been spending a lot of time at the State Department recently. I would probably have more experience than any other option on the table. At least I would know what the agency actually does, which is more than Ross knew coming in. Locking up superheroes in a secret oceanic prison is not something the Secretary of State should be doing, but you know Ross.
The new consultant: Because your dad was a homophobic asshole and unfortunately, you internalized his toxic behavior.
Me: Because you’re AWOL, Coulson is lobbying for somebody with powers to be the new boss to alleviate public panic. Others are lobbying for someone that will get rid of the problem. Enhanced person internment camps, here we come.
Me: Because people always fear what’s different. You can’t change that. You can only learn to cope with it.
Me: Not surprise. Now there’s no way I’m going to be able to keep liberty here.
Me: Although there may have been an incident with a vintage Captain America Tijuana Bible sometime in early puberty.
Monkey Lover 2: Of course. Does she know that there’s two of us?
“This happened before?”
Tosha: I think I thought the same thing once upon a time. You taught me better.
Me: Still not happy. I think it’s the stress of having to worry about Ross or other third parties trying to kidnap the kids for Avenger bait.
Purple Princess: I cannot confirm or deny that.
Me: No, he didn’t because you and I are still talking to each other, even if it’s via text messages. He wanted us at each other’s throats, but we're not. Actually, I think we're communicating better with each other now.
She had told Tony more, but that might be because she’s closer to Tony, even if the Tony she spoke to was not her Tony. The sponsorship bond is strong. Tony has been her rock during the separation. So, of course, she’s going to be comfortable telling this timeline’s Tony about the drunk text messages.
StarkAE: That won’t be necessary. I gave you guys a better program than Skype.
Me: I assume Tony prepped you beforehand?
Anthony: Although Agent Scary has found it entertaining and she finds nothing entertaining which is understandable after her recent foray into widowhood.
He was thrown into this room before he could talk to her, to see if Simmons found Senator Nadeer’s inhuman brother before she had a chance to kill him. Leo felt like he needed to save him because of what he did to the man in the framework. It was the least he could do.
