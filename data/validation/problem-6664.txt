As if the teen could sense Tony watching him, Steve looked up from the end of the swimmers’ lane and his blue eyes brightened. He pushed the wet spikes of blond hair off his forehead and then vaulted himself out of the pool, biceps flexing with the fluidity of the motion. His navy-blue swim trunks were hanging low on his hips, revealing deep v-lines as he sauntered towards Tony. Beads of water slid down his tanned skin, gliding over hard pecs and the dips and ridges of his perfectly defined abs.
He’d been hurt when he’d thought Steve was putting up walls between them. Yet Tony had thrown up more walls than Steve ever had.
What kind of alpha was willing to turn down the chance to spend a heat with an omega they so clearly wanted, all because they only had the aforementioned omega’s best interests in mind?
It made Tony want to have phone sex with him. Or any kind of sex, really. And holy sweet mother of mercy, he needed to stop that train of thought right now. “I thought the youth of today only communicated via texting,” he grumbled.
“Yeah.” Steve’s brows lifted slightly, his face softening in what seemed like happy surprise. “Of course. Anything you need.”
Steve had gone in after him, changing into a white muscle tank and black Adidas shorts and Tony also had to make a distinct effort not to check him out when he was done.
“It’ll be the first of August tomorrow,” Maria changed the topic. “Do you remember our family vacations to Florence, Italy? We would book them during this time of year.”
“Extend your leg!” Nat lightly rapped Bucky with a pool noodle. “You’re not extendin’! Straighten your posture! No slouchin’! Posture is key! Or you’ll never be the lead swan in
The water was a cold shock to Tony’s system. It swallowed him whole, pulling him down deeper and deeper.
The older man hadn’t let Tony see Rhodey outside of incredibly rare supervised visits. And Tony had always been made to suffer for them afterwards.
Alcohol wasn’t something he allowed himself often. He knew that it would be far too easy for him to succumb to the temptation of drowning his sorrows, just like his father.
beer. I’m perfectly sober. Listen, I appreciate the concern, but Steve’s one of the good ones. I’m sure of it. If he was gonna do something to me, he would’ve done it by now. He’s had a thousand chances already.”
Tony huffed. “Fine.” He gave in and stuffed the money into his pocket, ignoring the urge to knock Steve’s triumphant grin off his perfect face.
“It’s not biggummy. Mr. Potato Head betrayed her, so she poisoned him an’ took his money,” she explained frankly, as though that was a perfectly natural sentence for a seven-year-old to utter and not alarming in the least. “Now she’s marrying G.I. Joe. He’s lots richer.”
perfect? “Oh. That’s nice.” Tony feigned a glance at his wrist even though he wasn’t wearing a watch. “Wow, would you look at the time? I can’t believe it’s so late already. I really should be going. I have important errands and, uh, business to attend to. Busy, busy, busy. That’s me.”
But the teen—being the infuriating, ever-so-helpful person that he was—was already leaning down to pick up the papers.
specific pool and no other pool would do. It was as if she was in cahoots with some higher power that existed solely to make his life more difficult.
“Alright...if you’re sure...Tell you what, I’ll write you a prescription anyway, just in case you change your mind.”
“I’ve got time.” Then, before Tony could adequately process whether he should read into that statement or not, Steve asked, “Where’s Dum-E now?”
She floated in on a breeze of expensive perfume, looking sorely out of place as she entered his home. The air of privilege and extreme wealth that exuded from her was at odds with the small, economical feel of his apartment.
“Right. Yeah. Sure. I will absolutely not pass on that message,” Darcy said to the blonde’s already retreating back.
How quickly it regressed him to the naïve Tony of the past. To the kid who thought the world of his mom and wanted nothing more than his parents' approval. Who jumped to do their bidding because he couldn’t understand how his mother could wake up one morning and no longer love him.
Natasha was crying. She was buried into Bruce’s side, large tears sliding down her reddened cheeks. She wasn’t sobbing loudly, but there was something more painful about the quiet nature of her grief. Tony didn’t think he’d ever seen her quite so distraught before.
“This is a tad infantilizing,” Tony groused after buckling the lifejacket closed, “and I’m not just saying that because orange has never been my color. I feel like a kid trying to ride his first bike with the training wheels still on.”
One of the older moms at the pool was playing The Beach Boys on a pink boombox and it was making Tony nostalgic as hell.
The older alpha had delighted in breaking him; in turning Tony’s body against him. And in some fucked up way, Tony never really felt like he’d gotten it back.
“What? No.” Had he given Steve that impression? How could Steve doubt that Tony was anything less than two-hundred percent on board with sucking the most perfect dick in the world? “No—why would you…? I told you, I like kneeling for you. I like everything we’ve done. Sucking your dick is fast becoming one of my top ten favorite things to do. Wait, I’m fudging the numbers. My top three.”
Steve must’ve made a quick trip to the grocery store, because Tony was positive he hadn’t had bacon, eggs, or bread for toast in his fridge the day before.
Steve appeared at his side like an avenging sobriety angel and confiscated it before Tony could get his hands on it.
“Captain America is staring at you,” Darcy announced from over the top of her magazine, peering at Tony through red, heart shaped sunglasses.
“Aren’t you naturally a finely tuned athletic machine? I didn’t think alphas needed to work at staying fit.”
It was one of the only ways to get paid for doing what he loved. Tinkering with things. Building things. Fixing things.
The alpha tilted his head in something that looked suspiciously like a leer, his blue eyes sparkling mischievously. “You trying to tell me that you want me to teach you that, too?”
He wanted Steve to grab him. Needed him closer. Wanted the alpha to lift him up and pin him against the wall of the pool, sealing their bodies and mouths together in a fervent kiss.
Panic and rejection had hit Tony so hard it’d felt like the sky had opened up and fallen on him. He’d been sent reeling.
“I speak pig latin too, you giant nerd. And that was way rude, man. Would you kiss Steve with that mouth?”
Thinking about it made Tony’s heart nearly stutter to a stop. He didn’t want Obie anywhere near Steve. “No. Stay away from him. You’d only be doing him a favor. He thrives on conflict and negative attention.”
Not needing to be told twice, Steve reached across the sofa and slid the warm, solid weight of his arm around Tony’s shoulders.
“Right. I’m going to exit this conversation,” he said, rising from the table. “Someone should really rescue Bruce. He’s had more than his fair share of being tied to a chair for one day.”
Going for a walk down a park trail? Points for effort, but said walk rapidly progressed into desperate, seeking kisses against a tree, instead.
Darcy looked down at her swimsuit. It was a white one-piece covered in pictures of hamburgers. Failing to see what was wrong with it, she shrugged and glanced back up at the blonde. “Er, heeey, Amara. How…um, great…to see you again.”
“I’m still a spy!” Natasha insisted, her green eyes looking twice as large from behind her red pool goggles. “King Triton sent me here from Atlantica. I’m on a super-secret mission. Special Ops.”
“You aren’t me. Also, nice attempt at deflection.” She tapped her short, clear-painted nails on the patio table. “If I had to take a wild stab in the dark here…I’d say this has something to do with your not-so-secret admirer.”
Tony was supremely glad he hadn’t taken a sip of his coffee because he would have spit it out everywhere. He’d never seen an alpha blush before. Hell, he hadn’t realized alphas
So, great. There it was. Evidently, he trusted Steve now. In a big ‘put my life in your hands’ kind of way. In a way he’d only ever trusted few people before. In a way that was powerful enough to help him overcome a trauma that had been plaguing him for 21 years.
“That's between me and Tony.” While the tone of Steve’s voice was polite, it explicitly conveyed the message
Grim acceptance burned through him, turning his stomach sour. Quickly averting his gaze to the floor, Tony tried to draw his limbs in closer to his body. To prepare himself for the worst. For Steve to grab him. To maybe knock him around a little bit. To remind him of his place.
“You’re not? I could’ve sworn...Shoot, I’m usually so good at reading people.” The woman couldn’t seem to fathom that she’d been mistaken. It was as if Tony had told her that her favorite celebrity couple had never really been an item. Her frown lifted when she added, “Well, hun, perhaps you and he are, and you just don’t know it yet.”
And if part of him thought that he was out of his mind for knowingly putting himself in a confined space with Steve so soon after the-kiss-that-almost-was, well, that was a nonissue. Because the important point here was that he’d stopped himself before anything had happened. Things had gotten a little dicey for a minute there, sure, but he still had things under control. He didn’t have to succumb to his biology.
Tony hated when people made snap judgements about him based on his omega status, but here he was doing the same thing to Steve. He was a giant hypocrite. He’d written the teenager off from the moment they’d met; had labeled him as an alpha jock and had assumed the worst. He hadn’t even been willing to give Steve a chance…
Most alphas would never promise their sole attention to a single omega— let alone a disgraced one. He was committing a serious social taboo by even asking.
Jesus, she could’ve drowned. She didn’t know how to swim in the deep end yet. Thank god Bruce had stopped her.
“120. Oh, and Rhodes, my boss—the one I just mentioned and who the company is named after—also gave you a multilayer firewall to prevent anything like this from ever happening again.” The guy really didn’t need more security than the supercomputers over at NASA, but Tony may have gotten a little carried away… Sue him, he’d been bored.
He was in the middle of trying to groom the thick, unruly mop on his head when a knock sounded at his door.
“Thought so,” Tony concluded, scowling. “So, what, you just woke up one morning and thought, hey, I know what I’ll do today: I’m going to beat nine circles of hell out of someone?”
“I have stipulations,” Tony warned, “and rules, and enough personal damage to keep an entire team of therapists busy until they retire, as you well know. I’m a piping hot mess. I don’t do relationships. I don’t think I’d even know how if I tried. So if we do this, it can’t be anything serious. No labels. No future. No commitment. And it ends when the summer does. What happens in the summer, stays in the summer. Can you handle that?”
He was positioned over Tony on the bed; a huge, broad-shouldered wall of smoldering alpha intensity. His eyes drank Tony in, looking his fill.
Natasha shared no such sentiments. She happily barreled passed him. “Hi Captain Handsome!” she greeted with a ballet curtsy.
“I have no idea what that means. That doesn’t mean anything.” Despite Rhodey’s grumbling, he rearranged himself in the chair to make room for Tony to fit comfortably. Tony grinned triumphantly and made himself at home in Rhodey’s lap.
be here.” Then, voice going ragged and his eyes too intense, he added, “I…I don’t know what I would have done if I hadn’t shown up when I did. I’m sorry I didn’t get here sooner.”
good—alphas out there…and he actually wanted Tony for some crazy reason. How was Tony supposed to keep staying away?
Tony had suffered too. But, unlike Steve, he didn’t think he’d become a better person for it. He felt bitter and broken. Like something vital had been damaged inside of him.
But his mom didn’t do real emotion. Real emotion was messy and Maria refused to talk about anything that didn’t serve to keep up appearances or earn her prestige.
“Tony…” Steve stopped walking. “There’s nothing special about alphas like me. And there’s nothing wrong with omegas like you. I’ll repeat it as many times as you need to hear it. I don’t give a flying fuck about any of that. I’m
Ah, Christ. Foiled once again by his own rambling. Did that sound as unconvincing to Steve’s ears as it did to his own?
“You do act like a teenager sometimes,” Bruce said matter-of-factly as he appeared before them. He had been sitting off in the shade, scribbling notes in the margin of his book. It wasn’t uncommon for him to ignore most of Tony and Darcy’s shenanigans. The kid was a prodigy. A child genius. People had called Tony a genius once. Now his intelligence was expected to go to waste. “You’re hardly the paradigm for maturity.”
Giving Tony the distance he so clearly required, Steve backed off slightly, stepping away from the wall.
Besides, Steve didn’t seem like the type who’d be scared off by another alpha’s strength. Some men refused to date female alphas—it threatened their manhood—but Tony doubted Steve was one of them. Especially when Peggy was so gorgeous.
They were convinced that Steve was laying claim to him. That Steve had defended him against a threatening beta.
Tony had selected one scoop of coffee n’ doughnuts and one scoop of bourbon cherry pie. He offered Steve his cone.
There was almost no limit to what his parents' high-powered lawyers could accomplish. If Howard and Maria were looking to sell him off to another alpha, they might very well be able to force him into another mating contract.
They jumped into the shallow end together, Nat holding onto his hand like a lifeline. Her tiny fingers squeezed his with more force than he’d would have expected from a child her size.
“18?!” At least if he was 19, it’d make him almost 20…and if he was almost 20, then maybe—okay, nope. Tony needed to cut off that entirely too wrong train of thought. “You know what? Never mind. It’s none of my business how old he is. Now put your phone away and stop using your powers for evil.”
Tony let out the breath he’d been holding. “What are you doing here?” he asked Steve, finally reigning in enough of his shock to remember how to form words.
Though the teen wasn’t acknowledging it, Steve’s jeans weren’t up to the task of concealing the enormous bulge behind his zipper.
Biting back a grin, Tony extinguished the spark of warmth that was attempting to take hold of him. There was something undeniably amusing about seeing Mr. Tall-and-Strapping-Perfect-Alpha using a silly emoji.
Blue eyes watching Tony with infinite tenderness, the teen lay him down on the mattress underneath him.
and Steve was his Jake Ryan. His stomach full of butterflies as he waited with what amounted to bated breath for more affection from the alpha.
“I can’t remember,” he told her honestly. He didn’t know where he’d gone during the small, terrifying block of time his heart had stopped. Only that he’d been lost and that Steve had brought him back.
“Just read your magazine,” Tony shushed her. “Though I have no idea how you read that crap. It’s dark-sided, is what it is.”
With that one question, his pheromones awoke with a vengeance, pumping his arousal into the air. He could feel himself growing slick. Another thing that should’ve scared him—should’ve sent him running.
“Cannonball!” Charging passed them, Bucky landed in the pool with a splash impressive enough to capsize a small ship.
Finally reaching the top of the grassy hill, Tony was met with the sight of the park down below. Nat let go of his hand and made a mad sprint for Bucky. The brown-haired boy had been playing on the jungle gym, but as soon as he saw her, he jumped down and raced towards her as well.
The weak, oversensitive part of him—the part that he couldn’t get rid of, no matter how harshly he stomped it down—wanted to let the alpha take care of him. Wanted to wrap himself in the alpha’s scent and pretend that he belonged to somebody. That he was protected.
“Thanks?” Steve answered good-naturedly despite clearly having no idea how to appropriately respond to such a statement.
Great. More alpha posturing. And, lucky him, he was caught in the middle. He guessed it was too much to ask to have hoped that the dick measuring portion was over for the evening.
Something ugly flared in Brock’s eyes like he knew that Tony wasn’t being honest. He quickly smoothed it away with a smarmy grin. “Listen, I’ll just cut to the chase. My friend and I are bored and we couldn’t help noticing that you look bored too. I think we should all be bored together. Why don’t you and your female friend join us for a nice, relaxing swim?”
“Don’t everyone choose me all at once,” Darcy joked dryly when it became clear that Rhodey and Steve were about to start vying for a position on Tony’s team.
“For. Babies,” she’d repeated in a tone that seemed to say ‘your colorful pictures won’t fool me.’ “I want to go back to the real pool!” She was still on her mermaid kick and swimming was the only thing on her mind. Her green eyes had turned downright frightening when he’d told her that they weren’t going back.
All that to say, Tony wasn’t the least bit surprised when Rhodey did not ixnay and proceeded to give Steve the third degree.
He opened his desk drawer and took out the photo he’d hidden away—the one he’d saved but could never bring himself to look at. The one of his 18-week ultrasound.
The joke wasn’t exactly met with uproarious laughter. In fact, no one seemed willing to find humor in the situation at all.
“I’m still paying you,” Steve insisted stubbornly. “Are you going to be here tomorrow? I’ll bring the tablet with me.”
He felt closed in and stifled by the four doors of Steve’s SUV, despite the windows being rolled down and the fact that it wasn’t a particularly muggy night. His hair was slightly damp from his impromptu cold shower. Oh, and by the way, cold showers? Yeah, they weren’t nearly as effective as popular theory had led him to believe. He was still running hot and was way too agitated.
“Come on.” Steve ran a hand through his wet hair and jerked his chin towards the house. “I’ll get you a dry shirt.”
“When you put it like that, how could I say no?” Tony feigned nonchalance, though he made sure the double meaning behind his words was obvious to the teenager.
Something warm and healing nudged at his ribcage, spreading into the place where his hurt lived. It leeched some of the poison out of him.
He relinquished Tony’s hands and Tony set about freeing his prize. He pulled down the teen’s zipper and—
The alpha had come by Tony’s apartment for a classic movie bingeathon, because he’d been looking to brush up on his knowledge of the films Tony was prone to quoting. Problem was, Tony was having difficulty convincing himself that he wouldn’t much rather be giving Steve a nine-hour tour of his bedroom.
They placed their orders and made their way to the outdoor dining area. The parlor was known for its fun, wacky chair designs. Nat grabbed a seat in a giant banana split, and Bucky parked himself in a miniature replica of a mint ice cream truck. The two instantly started competing to see who could get brain freeze first.
Tony shrugged off the teen’s hold, ignoring the desperate way his inner omega whined, begging to stay in Steve’s arms. He’d barely pulled himself free before Natasha let out a small sob and dashed towards him. “Nanny Tony,” she whimpered, fusing herself onto his hip like a tiny, redheaded octopus.
The two of them were playing Spies and Robbers. Nat had tied Bruce to a lawn chair with some pink skipping rope. From what Tony could gather, she was pretending to be a member of the CIA on a special mission to stop a renowned jewel thief.
“Besides,” the alpha said pointedly, the corners of his mouth hiking up. “I’m interested in someone else. Someone a little older.” And then the handsome jerk walked off, leaving like he hadn’t just dropped a bomb in Tony’s lap.
Rounding a corner, he stumbled on a bathroom and blindly hurled himself inside, locking the door behind him with shaking fingers. Not that the lock would do him any good. The alpha was easily strong enough to break down the door.
Okay. That had been a stupid question. (It was no wonder Darcy had called him breathtakingly dense…)
Giving in, he stripped off his wet T-shirt and slid the jersey over his head. The material all but swallowed him. It was about two sizes too big and hung halfway to his knees. It smelled clean, but he could still detect a trace of the alpha’s intoxicating, masculine scent.
By burying his problems, he’d ensured they weren’t ever truly gone. Locking them away hadn’t fixed him. It had allowed them to become septic and spread. To make a permanent home in the shadows where they could haunt him.
Why Steve had depicted him like that, he didn’t know. There was no way the teenager actually saw him like that. He felt like Steve was taunting him somehow. Like the alpha was only paying attention to him so that he could laugh about it with his beta friends later. Like it was some kind of sick joke.
Under any other circumstances, it would’ve set him off again. But by that point he’d been so exhausted that he’d found himself going along with it. ‘Cause apparently letting a teenager pay his bills for him was the kind of person he was now.
Tony glanced up and barely caught sight of them standing there with Super Soakers in their hands before he and Steve were instantly doused with water. Moving faster than should have been possible for a person his size, Steve seemed to appear magically in front of Tony, shielding him from the kids’ prank.
“It’s okay. I’ll find someone to get them for you.” He lifted his head to look for assistance and nearly froze when he saw Steve-The-Lifeguard doing an Olympic level dive into the pool.
“You made me a promise. No possessive alpha bullshit. If you go after him, that’s a deal breaker. I won’t forgive you.”
It was Tony’s first-time seeing Steve laugh like that and he’d suddenly felt like he’d won a million bucks. He’d wanted to make Steve laugh like that again and again and again. To be the person in Steve’s life who made him happy.
Brock had been pulverized, but Steve didn’t have a scratch on him. The beta clearly hadn’t managed to get a single hit in.
His skinny, unimpressive omega physique couldn’t hold a candle to Steve’s massive, tanned alpha body.
So he’d thrown himself into the task of building Steve a present. Something one of a kind. The type of gift that would leave a lasting impression on the alpha long after they’d parted.
“There are other reasons,” Tony licked his lips, breath hitching. “Very good ones that I’m having trouble recalling right this second. But they’re…um, they’re...very valid, very convincing—”
“I-I’d never let anyone else do this.” He was too far gone to keep the words in. They wouldn’t stop. “You’re the—ah—only alpha I want. Only you. No one else. Only you.”
“Nothing,” he lied, pretending everything was fine. “I’m being spoiled with more sugar than the human body can handle. How could anything be wrong?”
“I’m just glad you finally came to your senses and agreed at all,” Steve answered, his dry sense of humor coming out to play.
What if he’d been born without the piece of his heart that allowed him to reach out and connect to other people?
“I’m feeling major secondhand embarrassment right now,” cringed Darcy, as she eyeballed Amara across the pool. The older woman was trying to flirt with Steve. She kept reaching out and ‘accidentally’ patting his biceps. She was holding a bottle of suntan lotion and seemed to be angling for him to apply it to her back. “She’s gotta know by now that he’s not interested.”
“I... I wouldn’t say I put myself down,” Tony floundered. Was Steve right—was that something he did? “I just...I’m not used to compliments, I guess. I don’t hear too many of them.”
“Unless…” The possibility of rejection sent a ripple of fear through him. Maybe he’d been wrong about last night not changing things... “Unless you don’t want to—”
He was a bit embarrassed the place wasn’t less of a mess, however. Steve’s room had been almost militantly organized. The alpha probably had the cleanest room of any 18-year-old on the planet.
She followed him into the kitchen and sat dutifully down at the table as he whipped her up another lunch. She ate the sandwich without complaint this time, and then asked for seconds. Okay. That was good. She must be feeling better.
The two of them had been spending an increasing amount of time together ever since the day Steve had saved his life, and their conversations had started veering perilously close into flirtation territory. But that was harmless, right? They just…they bantered. They enjoyed bantering. They weren’t doing anything wrong.
His anxiety was very much present, but it was static. It wasn’t mounting. He was able to exist alongside the discomfort, instead of having it overrule him.
“You’re, um, really big,” Tony blurted unthinkingly, a hitch in his breath. Was it wrong that his mouth was watering?
Tony felt his neck burn. Freaking glitter. He’d thought he got it all off, but apparently not. “Where?” he roughly swiped at his face.
Completely ignoring Killian and Co., Steve addressed Tony, “Do you want anything else from the concession stand or are you all set to head to the car?”
His breathing had just begun to shallow in distress when Steve walked back into the room, a damp washcloth in hand.
The four of them made the most of their free reign over the pool. He and Steve raced the kids with paddle boards, gave Nat and Bucky piggybacks, and were able to spoil them by safely securing them into life jackets, before granting them permission to use the large, winding slide in the deep end. And, hell, Tony would admit it. He took more than one turn on the slide, too.
“Whoa, hey. Aren’t you going to look at it first?” Tony asked in disbelief. “You, know, turn it on? Check that it works?”
“It’ll help raise your comfort level. That way, whether you’re in the water or not, you’ll know you’re safe.”
Her immaculate, bone straight hair was tied back into a familiar French twist. Her nails were short, red, and neatly manicured. A strand of pearls adorned her neck, and she was styled to the nines in a tailored, navy blue dress that probably cost more than he made in a year.
The alpha tore the page out of his sketchbook and handed it to Tony. Tony hesitated before taking it, making sure there was no accidental touching of hands, just like he had with the first aid kit. Then he brought the page in front of him and nearly dropped it before doing an inelegant doubletake.
He and Steve had been spending so much time alone together it was like they’d effectively shut out the rest of the world. They’d been living in their own small bubble where the obstacles between them had no longer mattered.
. “Well, see, it depends on how you define ‘swim’. Could I do a triple backflip off a diving board? Probably not. But the front crawl doesn’t look very hard to master. And I’m sure I could perfect a mean doggy paddle if I—”
In truth, Tony had suspected that Steve was staring at him. He could practically feel the alpha’s eyes on him and it was making his entire body buzz. As an omega, he was used to betas and, especially, alphas watching his every move. It had always been something he’d hated, regardless of his mother’s recriminations that he should feel flattered.
“Clearly.” Amara gave her another unimpressed once-over. “Well, I’ve got to run. I have more important things to do. Tell Thor I said hi!”
Tony didn’t know how long he lay like that, the pool deck damp and cold against his back, as he accepted the alpha’s comfort, relishing in the simple miracle of being able to
“I...I didn’t know if that was against your rules or not,” Steve said, sounding young and less sure all of a sudden. As if he was now the one wondering if he’d done something wrong. “I thought about buying you flowers...but I figured you wanted to keep tonight more casual.”
Oh, shit. Tony winced. He should’ve picked up on that. No wonder Steve had only spoken about the man in past tense. “I’m sorry to hear that.” Now he felt terrible for his snide
Tony bit back the urge to remind Steve that the teenager had been fifteen not all that long ago. Neither of them needed that. “Don’t look so impressed,” he said instead, uncomfortable with Steve’s admiration. “I named him Dum-E for a reason. He was clumsy, regularly insubordinate, and his drivetrain was in major need of improvement.”
He took a seat across from her. The kitchen clock ticked loudly in the din of their stilted silence. Minutes passed.
Tony remained where he was leaning against the door. “I’m confused,” he said unsurely. All he knew was that his alpha was looking displeased and unhappy again and he was at a loss to stop it.
As he hurried closer, he saw that the boy had somehow managed to grab Bruce’s glasses and one of his textbooks. Bruce was lunging for them but the boy was mockingly dangling them out of his reach.
He was done talking about, thinking about, and, most importantly, staring at Steve Rogers. The topic was officially canceled.
After an eon of uncomfortable silence that was really only about thirty seconds, the teen gave a short nod. His expression settled into a familiar, steely look of determination.
A crease appeared on Steve’s forehead. “I don’t think that’s a good idea. We should work you up to it. Get you used to the shallow end first.”
He’d come to Tony a few days ago, all worked up into a panic because he’d contracted a porn virus on his mate’s notebook computer while she was away visiting family. The virus had wiped the computer’s memory and replaced all the storage space with a series of highly graphic images and videos of 30-something omegas getting too chummy with a set of office supplies. Licking staplers, humping Xerox machines, and doing frankly unsanitary things with giant rulers. Whatever. It was hardly the weirdest material he’d ever found on someone’s hard drive.
A visible surge of possessiveness seemed to overtake the teenager. His eyes flashed, a growl bursting from his throat.
Tony didn’t quite know what to make of it. He was glad that Bucky was clearly comfortable enough around his older brother to act like…well, a kid, and not the frighteningly obedient Stepford child that was the product of too many alpha households. Alphas liked to think of themselves as all-powerful but they had pathetically fragile egos. They were quick to perceive any ‘slight’ against them as a challenge of their authority. Tony had no doubt that some of them would’ve been genuinely angered by the children’s harmless prank. However, Steve seemed more amused than anything.
The teen paused, seemingly frustrated. “I want to tell you something,” he said after a couple of seconds. “You make me nervous, too. It’s not easy to get you to talk to me. I wanted to impress you so much today that I googled a list of conversation starters.” Ears pinkening, he readjusted his baseball cap. “‘What do you do in your free time? What are some of your hobbies?’” he echoed. “I practiced asking you that.”
He decided on an excursion to the beach. Mindful of Steve’s preference for healthy eating, Tony cut up some fresh fruit and vegetables. Then he packed them, along with some ice water and a red checkered picnic blanket he owned solely as a by-product of being a nanny, in a small basket.
“Maria Stark happened. Yeah, I got a visit from my estranged mother. She decided to stop by and mend fences—on one condition. Want to know what the condition is? Come on, Rogers, ask me. Take your best guess.”
“Okay,” the woman continued, completely oblivious to Tony’s brewing mental break down as she asked the one question guaranteed to make the situation even worse, “And are you pregnant or is there any chance you might be pregnant?”
It was hard to feel self-conscious when the teenager was looking at him in the way only Steve did. Like he wanted Tony more than anyone had ever wanted anything. Scars and all.
“Now why would I go and do a thing like that?” Brock asked sarcastically. Unfortunately, Darcy’s interference had only seemed to provoke him further. It was like he was enjoying himself even more now that he had an audience. “I’m just trying to get him to swim with me. Isn’t that what the pool is for—swimming? He’s here every damn day and I’ve never once seen him in the water.” He flashed his teeth at Tony in a cruel imitation of a smile. “That’s about to change.”
It was a bit of a startling development, really, considering that the very first time they’d touched had resulted in directly triggering one of his attacks. And now Steve was apparently better than Lorazepam. He was keeping Tony anchored.
. So what if Tony had been a depressed, brooding loser who’d been counting every last tortuous second they’d spent apart? Steve didn’t need to know that. “Oh, have you been around less lately? I hadn’t noticed.”
He’d had to stop and recollect himself multiple times. Had to take shuddering breaths and wipe away the few, quiet streaks of tears that spilled over.
It fed the part of him that had been starving for it. But, at the same time, he was at a loss over how to handle it. As if he’d become so famished—so accustomed to going without—that he no longer knew how to accept what he needed.
Omegas weren’t allowed to run their own businesses. They weren’t respected or hired in most stereotypically ‘masculine’ trades, either. He’d had to do a little hacking and falsifying of documents to get the business started. He was posing as Rhodey’s assistant, but after the customers dropped off their small electronics—meeting with him in a public place so as to not give away his address—he was secretly fixing them himself.
“I’m going to Empire State University on a football scholarship in September. I like playing the game but I honestly don’t care what I do as long as I make enough money to take care of mom and Buck.”
The alpha had always maintained a friendly and controlled demeanor around him. Tony had never seen this side of him before.
“Just like that?” His blue eyes studied Tony painstakingly, their faces mere inches apart. “Where is this coming from?”
“You’re taking a lot of liberties with these pet names, pal. It’s all ‘babe’ this, ‘baby’ that...you remember I’m older than you, right? If you insist on calling me baby, I’m going to think you want me to call you daddy.”
Tony had to steer them out of the emotionally charged territory they’d landed in, and into something more purely physical.
When Tony was finished speaking, there was so much fury radiating off the teenager, he was actually vibrating with it.
Tony wanted to test the durability of the white string tying those swimming trunks together with his teeth.
“What tipped you off?” Tony slurred, liquid sloshing around the bottle as he lifted it to his mouth for another swig.
“I’m sorry about your book,” the alpha continued, holding up the soggy, limp cover that read ‘Nuclear Physics: Experimental and Theoretical’. “It seems a tad waterlogged.”
He wasn’t exactly presenting a sexy, irresistible picture right then. The image he was giving off was that of a hangover, bed head, and gross morning breath. He couldn’t have picked a worse time to spontaneously ask Steve to be his heat partner.
want to hurt this piece of shit. Please tell me I can hurt him. Christ, I could fucking kill him. He needs to pay for what he did to you.”
“I remember Howard being on his phone every five minutes. And the two of you hopping onto your private jet and unloading me with the tour guide after an urgent business call.”
“Really, really, really mean it. Well, whaddya say, kid? Want to go swimming together? We’ve got the pool all to ourselves today. Oh, and in case I forgot to mention it, Bucky’s going to be there.”
“Steeeeve!” Bucky burst into the open kitchen with Nat hot on his heels. She skittered into him, almost knocking them both over before he steadied her. “We want to play in the backyard.”
“That photo of you, the one hanging over your hall table. I never…I didn’t realize it was you at the time…”
For all she’d done, he hadn’t yet discovered the key to hardening his heart enough to keep her out. He was stuck in a sick cycle of repaying her coldness with endless second chances.
A small flush rose up Steve’s face as he let out a choked noise that was part laugh and part something else. “Stop trying to distract me and suit up. Put on the life vest, Tony.”
He dodged the doughy projectile. “Hey, not nice! No throwing food—this is not a high school cafeteria!”
He allowed himself to imagine what it’d look like if things were different. If he wasn’t an omega and Steve was older. Could they be happy? Would the two of them be the ones sharing a cheesy, romantic dinner over a bottle of wine?
“You used to get yourself thrown in detention with me so I wouldn’t be alone,” Tony recalled fondly.
The alpha looked like he was a little short on sleep, himself. His blue eyes appeared worn, dark circles shadowing them.
In the meantime, though, Tony was still freaking the fuck out. He had even less of an idea now of how to act around Steve than before.
“The problem is that I’m not yours to protect, remember? I could’ve sworn we had this conversation already! This is going so far outside the bounds of friendship that I don’t even know what to call it anymore!”
“Pizza delivery! Team Rogers to the rescue!” Bucky announced right before Natasha tackled him in a hug.
“Oh. That,” Tony laughed nervously. “Yeah, that was nothing but a little robotics, sensory feedback, and information processing. Simple, really. Anyone could have done it.”
He’d been so focused on his own issues that he hadn’t thought about whether or not he’d hurt Steve last week by rejecting him.
He was only a disgraced omega, after all. If something awful happened to him, it was hardly grounds for alarm.
“I hate bread,” Natasha proclaimed, loudly pushing away her plate. Not a single bite had been taken.
“Wait. Please.” Steve exhaled roughly. He scrubbed a hand down his face. “I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that...I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I don’t get jealous like this. It’s—fuck, it’s twisting me up inside. When I saw you with him…you let him touch you. You let him protect you. You won’t let
He’d survived a lot of cruel treatment during his years as Obie’s mate...been subjected to more than one of the man’s twisted appetites...but nothing—
“You said last night that you need to forget,” the alpha began, full of compassionate understanding. “I did the same after my dad passed. I knew I had to be strong for mom and Buck, so I shut down. Stopped myself from thinking about him. And it worked, for a while. Allowed me to get through the day. And then...then it started working too well. The memory of his face became blurrier. The sound of his voice wasn’t as clear. I was losing the small details. And that hurt worse than remembering ever had. It was like having my dad die on me all over again. So I stopped trying to forget. Promised myself I’d remember. That I’d let him live on in me.”
The kit, amongst other things, had a ton of multicolored bandages inside. He let Natasha pick out her favorite one and then distracted her with jokes while he sprayed her cut with Neosporin. Before long, all traces of her tears were gone.
Not wanting to spit in the face of Steve’s generosity, he tried to minimize his grimace as he forced himself to swallow.
Hopefully the length of the chapter makes up a little for the fact that I didn’t update in the most timely manner. I tried, y’all.
Pushing forward, he leaned into the alpha’s larger frame, his body already throbbing despite the fact that Steve hadn’t even touched him yet.
be here.” That girl spent so much time swimming she was in danger of morphing into a deep-sea creature soon.
He was saved by the bell—literally. Jane and Thor’s fancy doorbell chimed, loudly alerting the yard to a visitor.
But the look in Steve’s eyes hadn’t changed. He was still staring at Tony like Tony had hung the moon.
Much to Tony’s chagrin, a burst of rancorous laughter rang out from the teenagers beside them, drawing Steve’s attention.
Or maybe their baby would take after Tony. Maybe they’d have a chubby little infant with dark brown hair and dark eyes.
“Oh.” Darcy temporarily deflated. “But that doesn’t mean anything. Did he explicitly state that he was dating them? You should really ask him before you start moping about it.”
Being that Tony had left the door wide open, he’d accidentally given the alpha a clear view into his tiny apartment. From Steve’s vantage point, he could see Tony’s small kitchen and his half-living room/half-workshop setup.
Sweat broke out on his forehead as he pushed his back against the wall, desperately wishing he could disappear through it. His heartbeat drummed like a gong in his ears, racing too fast for his body. His pheromones had been replaced with the bitter, acrid scent of fear.
Tony might’ve been the older one, but when it came to dating, Steve definitely had more experience. As the high school prom king/sports star—not to mention looking the way he did—Steve wouldn’t have lacked for company. He would’ve had—and
He’d reflexively shoved it into the pocket of his shorts when the kids had attacked them with water guns.
This one, that’s who. Steve was a 19-year-old anomaly. A freaking considerate, mystical alpha unicorn. A once in a lifetime person.
“Okay,” the alpha agreed in a reassuring tone. “I’ll stay away. I promise I won’t come in, alright? But I don’t want to leave you alone right now. You sound like you’re having a panic attack. Have you ever had one before?”
“Tony.” Rhodey followed him outside, loudly repeating his name until Tony was forced to halt his retreat.
“It’s his access code,” Tony explained. “Powers him on and off. It’ll come in handy. Otherwise, he’s liable to keep you up at all hours of the night with a constant stream of football facts. I can only hear so many times that the first football was made out of an inflated pig’s bladder.” Plus, he wanted to talk to Steve without having an artificially intelligent audience butting in. “So, full disclosure: remember when I denied looking you up on Facebook? I fibbed. I’m a big fibber. I only know your birthday because Darcy and I cyber sleuthed your profile when we first met.”
. “Aww,” he teased, trying to play it off. “Are you jealous, Rhodey-bear? Don’t worry, you’re still my favorite alpha.”
Tony followed Natasha as she bounded up the front porch of her new friend’s home. He had received a phone call from a woman named Sarah, who was the mother of the boy Natasha had met at the pool. Sarah had invited Natasha and Tony over for a playdate.
At least now he was being more careful about it. He—hopefully—wasn’t taking on too much. And he wasn’t doing it alone.
The two brothers started tussling and giving each other a hard time in the type of ‘I wouldn’t be doing my job as your sibling if I didn’t spend at least part of each day annoying you’ high jinks Tony had seen from them before.
He’d been ashamed of his pheromones from the day he’d first produced them. To him, they were an unnatural function of his body he’d wished with all his soul to be rid of.
Steve shrugged. “We can sit. Talk. Maybe you can tell me a little bit about why you don’t like the water. That is…uh,” his eyes darted to Tony, “if you’re ready.”
He overheard Zoya’s voice in the background informing Nat that it was bedtime. Nat protested for a while (“Natasha, please tell Nanny Tony goodnight. You can’t keep him on the phone.” “No!”) before finally giving into her mother’s demands. With a teary farewell she wished him goodnight and disconnected the call.
Bad things happened when Natasha didn’t get her way. Scary things. Damien-from-The-Omen type things. The last time Tony had gotten on her bad side, she’d cut off all the heads of her teddy bears and had lit her barbies on fire.
“How are you so good at this?” Steve groused at Tony with good-humored wryness, his voice that of an athlete who wasn’t used to lagging behind.
Steve’s strong thigh resting against his. A breeze in his hair. The sunshine overhead and a clear blue sky. A sense of belonging. Of feeling free to be himself. Of being with the kind of people who accepted him for who he was.
So, this chapter got somehow almost longer than the first three combined... Let me know if you prefer them shorter. :)
Okay, now would be the time to say something—to mention that the teen’s advances weren’t appropriate. He highly doubted that Steve would be crushed by the rejection. The teen would probably shrug it off and move onto one of his many admirers faster than Tony could spell motherboard. Scoffing, Tony pulled his gaze away from Steve and stared off into the horizon instead. “I’m sorry to break it to you, but you have terrible taste.”
After a moment’s hesitation, the teen said grimly, “The fact that you feel the need to ask me that is exactly what worries me. I did want you. I
In the end, he’d decided he was making it into a bigger deal than it actually was. Nat didn’t deserve to have her summer ruined just because he couldn’t handle himself around some random alpha. It was pathetic that he was giving a teenager—a freaking
“I see.” Jane held for a pause. “Alright, I have to ask...have you been spending time with any unmated alphas lately?”
Her disappointed gaze weighed on him as heavily a physical burden. His failure to live up to her expectations ate away at him.
Resistance melting faster than their ice cream cones in the hot sun, Tony’s lips went soft and pliable under Steve’s. He almost chased Steve’s mouth when the alpha pulled away.
“I have to go.” He had to get out of there before he did something else he’d regret. Before he found himself thoroughly fucked and knotted in the middle of the community center. “I...I can’t be around you anymore.”
“Believe me,” Steve insisted gruffly, as though Tony had uttered the single most baseless statement in the history of mankind. “I got something out of it.”
“Natasha!” The boy was wearing big, plastic, secret agent goggles. The lens screen was blue and it had a yellow flip out scope. “Come see my spy kit! I hafta take your fingerprints so I can arrest you.”
The person standing on the other side wasn’t Steve. They were someone Tony had never thought he’d see again.
As much as Steve looked like he wanted to believe Tony’s reassurance, there was still a flare of fear in his eyes.
“Of course he’s old enough to drink.” Jane waved off the question. “Look at him. What are you—twenty-five, twenty-six?”
In hindsight, perhaps disclosing to Rhodey that he and Steve were in a no strings attached summer vacationship hadn’t been the wisest choice.
“Oh. Um. Thank you,” Tony stammered awkwardly. “But we’re not...he and I are not—the kids aren’t mine. I’m not family. I’m just the nanny.”
He hated it so much that he found himself caving, “You know what? On second thought, why don’t you come in? I’m feeling up for a quick tour. But you can’t say I didn’t warn you.”
The two of them were giving off such a high concentration of alpha dominance that it was making Tony’s instincts frazzled. The omega in him was sending him submissive impulses, urging him to placate them.
It explained why he and Steve were so drawn together. Why, even now, Tony still wanted the teenager beyond all reason. Why he still had the alpha’s scent all over him, taunting him, because he was too afraid to wash it off when he knew that he’d never get it back.
“But look at all the fun pictures,” he’d wheedled, pointing to where he’d attempted to decorate it. “We’ve got fish, seashells, turtles, and…uh…other fish.”
The lifeguard in question was a young male of average size and build. He had a crazy mop of slightly curly brown hair and didn’t look a day over 17. He was wearing the same lifeguard uniform as Steve but it in no way had the same effect.
. Nobody had handed it to him. He paid for it with his own meager earnings. And for that, he could be proud.
Tony struggled to balance his extra-large bucket of popcorn and root beer Big Gulp as he watched Rhodey take a phone call.
That was sobering. That was alarming. But he could only focus on one problem at a time, and right now he just wanted to be happy that he’d made it into the water.
Clearly gearing up to say more, the alpha took another moment to calm down before he continued. “I’m not going to pretend to know how you feel. Or that I'm qualified to talk about any of this...” The tone of his voice was treading carefully, as though he knew how far he was venturing into sensitive territory. “You have every right to grieve. But I'm not going to let you blame yourself. My mom’s seen her share of miscarriages on the job. Sometimes, these things just happen. Nothing and nobody causes it. It wasn’t your fault, Tony. You got that? It’s
And when the memories flooded him—barreling down on him with enough force to almost send him crashing to his knees—there was no stopping them.
“I had a great time tonight,” Steve said, his hands in the pockets of the jacket Tony had just returned to him. “Do I get to take you out again?”
I was tempted to name the baby Morgan, but that hurt my heart way too much. I named her Amelia after Amelia Trask from the comics (Earth-161), instead. She's apparently Tony's cousin, and I honestly don’t know that much about her, but she sounded like a good fit.
It didn’t matter. His mother showed no reaction to his comment. She’d long mastered the skill of selective hearing. She didn’t acknowledge anything that didn’t fit her desired narrative.
“You’ve got some arm on you, college boy,” Rhodey begrudgingly admitted. Unfortunately, it wasn’t an olive branch or the start of a beautiful new friendship, because he immediately followed it up with, “Of course, Tony’s not impressed by how many completed passes you can make or how many yards you can cover. He’d rather read Justin Hammer's 900-page autobiography than watch the Super Bowl.”
Steve, however, didn’t make a single move on Tony. The teenager was being a perfect gentleman. Thus torturing Tony entirely.
“Black is fine.” Tony was having a hard time absorbing the fact that an alpha was actually serving him a drink. He was used to it being the other way around—used to alphas ordering
Steve’s eyebrows were pulling together like he was trying not to laugh. “We’re not going to be torn in half by a tornado, Tony. But if we are, you get to say ‘I told you so.’”
“I can thank dear old dad for that specific trait. ‘Bout the only thing he ever gave me. Sure wasn’t his height. I regrettably missed the coupon for free growth spurts when they were handing them out in the womb. So, I’m pretty much stuck like this.”
The teen was trying to downplay how affected he was by Tony’s scent, but Tony knew he was having a challenging time of it. The truth was evident in the stiff, unrelaxed rigidity of his muscles. In the way he was choosing to breathe through his mouth instead of his nose. In the prominent, not-going-anywhere bulge that looked like it was threatening to rip through his shorts.
“Stop.” Tony bitterly shook his head. “Don’t call me ‘babe’ and don’t tell me about how much you’ve supposedly missed me. You only think you’re into me because, apparently, we’re something called ‘highly compatible’. Do you understand that, sports star? You know what that means? It means my pheromones are literally designed to make you want me. So whatever you think you feel for me–it’s manufactured. It’s not real. It’s more alpha and omega bullshit.”
Then, while still holding Tony’s gaze in a way that made the omega’s chest feel funny, he reached out and cupped Tony’s cheek in his hand. Leaning down, he nuzzled his face against Tony’s, emitting a low, purr-like rumble that Tony knew, in theory, was a sound that alphas could make, but that he’d never heard before now.
In the spirit of self-preservation, he’d offered to take her to a different swimming pool. Surely, that wasn’t the only pool in their area, right? Wrong. Nat had fixated on going to
Tony searched within himself for a long moment. “Amelia,” he finally whispered, naming her after the one teacher who’d remained kind to him after he’d presented as an omega.
“Me? No, no. I didn’t fix anything. I answer the phones and, uh, make customer drop-offs. I can barely keep up with all this fancy newfangled technology. My boss handles all the repairs, clearly.”
“He drowned,” Steve answered for him. “He was unresponsive for at least three minutes before I managed to resuscitate him.”
He barely kept from squirming in Steve’s lap, afraid he was leaving evidence of his slick on the front of the alpha’s jeans. Being called pretty apparently got him hot as long as Steve was the one saying it. “I...I like doing it for you.”
Nobody had taken his skill set in engineering seriously since before he’d presented. They’d all just assumed that the only thing he was good for was cooking, cleaning, and pushing out babies.
“I don’t even know how, but I made it to the ledge.” Tony decided to leave out the part where Howard had pushed his head back under the water. “I was starting to black out, but I managed to grab on. Managed to pull myself out of the pool.”
“I, uh, overheard some staff members talking.” But that wasn’t true. Tony had actually heard it straight from the source. Against his better judgement, he’d somehow wound up talking to Steve on the phone for nearly half the night.
been told that he mattered before? Chancing a glance at the alpha, he slowly raised his eyes. Instead of the cold, rageful sneer he’d find on Obie, he found the teenager staring at him like a confused, overly muscular puppy.
“I should get going.” Steve huffed a regretful sigh into Tony’s neck. “We both need to be up early.”
“Not if you promise to stop throwing it around.” He shook more glitter out of his hair. “And get me the dustpan. We need to sweep this up.”
“Oh. I almost forgot.” Remembering the tablet he was lugging around, Tony handed Steve a small, black knapsack. “Here. The screen’s as good as new. I also tweaked some of the glitches in the operating system. It should run faster and hold a longer battery life now.”
Something else occurred to him. “That was you in the picture…” he murmured, recalling the family portraits he’d seen at Steve’s house.
Tony didn’t know whether it was hearing his name or the eye contact that worked. But some level of self-awareness that he was being a jackass must’ve thankfully penetrated through the teen’s skull, because Steve stopped resisting and let Tony tug him back.
But Steve was Steve. And, as Tony had already learned, part of the teenager’s personality included not shying away from a fight. Steve Rogers could be a real shit stirrer when he wanted to be.
“Say it a little louder, why don’t you,” Tony moaned, hiding his head in his hands. “And I don’t want to mate with him. I don’t even know him.”
“Fifteen,” Steve repeated as if he couldn’t quite believe it. “You know what I was doing at fifteen? I was fixing the drip in mom’s sink. I wasn’t building robots.”
“You need a haircut,” Maria observed, the first to speak. “I’ve told you not to let it get so long. It’s much too messy. And you’re far too thin. Have you been eating enough?”
Rhodey stood from the table, pulling his car keys from his pocket. “Steve can head out alone. I’ll drive you.”
Awareness, hot and rolling, zinged along Tony’s nerve endings—a physiological response to them touching. What the hell
He could see her thinking his words over. Eventually, she dashed a hand over her eyes, batting away some of her drying tears, and asked, “If we get really old…will all our hair an’ teeth fall out?”
“I know how you can be of assistance,” an unfamiliar male voice chuckled. It was skeevy in the way that reminded Tony of the annoying catcalls he constantly received.
“Really.” Unless Steve was the best actor in the world, the sincerity in his voice was unmistakable. He wasn’t saying it to placate Tony or because he felt sorry for him. Steve believed it.
“Uh, I can see that,” Rhodey replied, freezing. He looked to be in the process of opening an expensive bottle of wine. Two glasses were placed on the table in front of him, and a pretty woman with dyed-blue hair was sitting on the couch beside him. “You’re here. Now. Without phoning to tell me you were coming.”
Tony expelled the voice before it could do more damage. “My choice is for you to save your heroics for someone who wants ‘em. Anyway, don’t worry your pretty blond head about it. You’re leaving soon. It’s not anything you need t’ be concerned about.”
He thought he heard Steve make a soft sound of amusement on the other side of the door. “I guess I better keep talking then.”
The children were otherwise occupied. Nat was napping in her room—she hadn’t been sleeping well—and Bruce was in the study, reconfiguring where his latest chemical equation had gone wrong, so Tony and Darcy were lounging in the Romanoff’s living room.
In any event, he could handle ‘overprotectiveness’ way better than being pitied. Pity was the one thing he couldn’t take.
Steve was drawing closer. His eyes were hot, intent. The sun lighting him up like some kind of golden god.
Tony had watched in horror as the entire experiment had gone up like a volcano. The red, sparkly, glue-like substance had shot straight up onto the ceiling and all over the Romanoff’s white kitchen.
“Sir. Yes, sir,” he mock saluted the alpha. But he also sort of meant it, too, because he’d seen what happened to people who got on Steve’s bad side, and he felt a little sorry for anyone stupid enough to ‘take it up’ with him. “Let’s get this show on the road.”
The teen appeared completely absorbed by him, as though he was determined to imprint Tony’s every response in his memory. He took his time learning Tony’s body. How to touch him. What he liked. What made him curse. Made his breathing accelerate. Made him thrash his head and white knuckle the bedsheets in total abandon.
need your help. Do you know what it's been like for my Howard to have his son—his only child—become a disgraced omega? You were supposed to be his protégé. The future of Stark Industries…”
Steve soothed him with a kiss. Tony could detect the sweet, tangy taste of his own slick in the teen’s mouth—and, Christ, that discovery was so unexpectedly hot, it would’ve set him off again if he hadn’t already been wrung dry.
And then Steve was right there, reaching for him, wrapping Tony in his arms. An answering sound of comfort left his throat as he tucked Tony against his big, strong chest.
The alpha’s mouth ticked up like he was pleased by Tony’s impatience before he closed the distance between them and finally
“Great suit, Darcy,” a tall, leggy, blonde sneered as she approached them. “Did you get it from the Juniors section at Walmart?”
Wrestling the pain back into its cage before it could eat him alive, he mentally slammed a door on the image, locking the imaginary version of himself and the baby behind it.
As soon as he got home, he was going to start building a pool for Natasha, because he never wanted to see the blond alpha again.
He had never, in all actuality, been on a real date before. He’d been contractually promised to Obie by his parents at the age of 16, and then given to him the day he’d turned 18.
And—get this—it was followed by a fricken heart emoji. Which was 100% the fault of Darcy and her cursed meddling.
Seemingly oblivious to Tony’s impending meltdown, Steve strode over to his dresser and pulled open the middle drawer. He grabbed his drenched shirt from the back of his neck and yanked it over his head, making the obscene muscles in his stomach and back flex enticingly. His abs were so cut they looked almost superhuman.
The compliments did the trick. The insecurity in Steve’s face was replaced by a bright, adorable blush.
“Jane, hey. Thanks for getting back to me so quickly.” Setting down the screwdriver he’d been using to repair Nat’s Barbie dream car, he shifted his full attention to the call.
Tony weirdly found himself wanting to soothe the alpha. “Don’t take it personally. I’m, uh, kind of messed up.”
Carefully setting her down and straightening up, he joked, “So I’ve been told. And believe me, I thank my lucky stars for that. I shudder to think of the poor nannies who permanently ended up on your bad side.”
Easing his way down the white pool steps that led into the shallow end, he slowly waded into the water. His hold on Steve’s wrist tightened reflexively, but Steve was right there with him. Only a few inches away.
“I’m sorry to call so late but Natasha has been worried sick. She’s been refusing to go to sleep and keeps asking about you. If I pass the phone to her, will you speak to her and let her know you’re alright?”
“He shouldn’t be allowed to pick on you.” Her face scrunched up in an angry frown. “You build me robots, and you read to me, and you’re funny, an’ you cut the crusts off my toast.”
“Six months.” Tony felt his face heat under Steve’s stare. “I’m apparently the eighth nanny her parents have tried. They claim she scared all the others away, yet I’m still hanging in there. She seems to like me for some inexplicable reason.”
Tony woke up to a text message from Steve on his phone. He hadn’t had to board the ‘did he mean it when he said he was going to call me?’ post-date worry train at all.
His phone buzzed with a text alert behind him, vibrating against the kitchen counter. He absentmindedly grabbed it and thumbed open the new message.
“You’d lose that bet,” Steve said, after a moment of shocked stillness. “I got my ass kicked all the time when I was younger. And trust me, almost nobody liked me.”
“If I find out you didn't get him home safely… If I find out you’ve done something—anything—to hurt him...ever; at all...I’ll kill you.”
“Baseball doesn’t have periods, babe,” Steve chuckled. “It’s got innings. You’re thinking of ice hockey.”
. “Now you’re really pissing me off. Stop cockblocking my booze. S’mine. I paid for it. Hand it over.”
Steve’s gaze was devouring Tony as if he thought blinking might cause Tony to disappear. His hand slid into Tony’s hair with almost reverence, grip careful.
“Maybe not beer pong.” Jane’s gaze briefly flitted to the under 21-year-old at the table. “We can do yard pong. Or lawn darts. We have the right amount of people to play in teams of two.”
Because the way he’d felt when he’d kissed Steve might’ve terrified him...but the only thing that scared him more was never exploring it. Never feeling that way again.
“Thanks. I think.” The alpha shut the door behind them. “And for the record, I’m not that young. I’m old enough to know what I want."
As an alpha, Steve was probably the apple of his mother’s and father’s eye. Their golden child who could do no wrong. Tony pictured them all living together like one big, happy
The bacon was slightly charred but no less edible. The eggs were perfect with flowing, golden yolk, and the toast was buttery and crisp.
Tony’s back hit the wall of the equipment room. Steve brought a hand up beside his head, penning him in with over 200 pounds of formidable alpha male. An alpha that was still bare chested and almost naked except for the damp swimming trunks clinging to his very muscular thighs.
“That wasn’t an invitation to follow me,” he told his friend, sounding weirdly despondent even to his own ears. “You should go back inside. Don’t let me ruin your evening with…” he trailed off, unsure of her name.
A few months ago, he’d never have believed that this was possible. No longer was he sitting on the sidelines, held prisoner by his fear as everyone else got to splash around and play in the water. He wasn’t the outsider looking in anymore. He was able to join them.
. Was Steve worried about offending the delicate omega’s sensibilities? Who even said the word ‘cuss’ anymore? Tony snorted. “I’m not a schoolmarm. Cussing doesn’t bother me.”
“Sorry, buddy,” Steve said, and the best part was that he sounded genuine, too. He was apologizing to a
Steve had booked off the entire pool for their use that afternoon. Being the community center’s favorite lifeguard had its perks.
“Tony talks about you. He told me you’re his oldest friend. That you’re like a brother to him.” On that note, Steve’s hand moved to the small of Tony’s back in a distinctly non-brotherly gesture.
Nat weighed his words. He could see in her face that she was dying to say yes. “‘Kay,” she lifted her chin. “I’ll go.”
Wasn’t the recipient of a shovel talk supposed to conscientiously endure it? These scenarios didn’t usually involve the other party issuing a threat in return and declaring themselves ready to rumble.
“Is there anything I can do?” he increased his pacing. “What if I start taking a higher dosage? Would that help?”
...Aright, his heat was definitely getting closer. He was becoming more of a sentimental, emotional powder keg by the minute.
“You think that little of me?” A muscle ticked in Steve’s cheek, his jaw clenching. “That I don’t care what happens to you?”
Tony knew that Steve wasn’t one of those predatory alphas whose mission in life was to collect as many omega shaped notches on their bedposts as possible…but the teen was young and clearly enjoying life. Which also likely included enjoying some of the attention being given to him. And there was nothing wrong with that.
“Forget it.” Tony glowered. “Keep your ingratiating condiments.” Ignoring them, he defiantly bit into his burger and returned his attention to Darcy. She was regaling the table with tales of Bruce's latest exploits.
