Steve looked to his hand and saw the little finger was still there but he looked back to the photo and saw the pinkie there was gone, faded like Tony had.
There was no sign of Bucky or Natasha upstairs, but it was very late so they most likely were already asleep.
“Only to get home. You heard it yourself. Its being here can change the events of the future. What if we
They walked in silence the rest of the way as Tony led them behind the compound and into the forest. Tony paused just inside the forest’s edge to loosen his shirt and let some light from his arc reactor spill out. He turned to Steve with a smile and held out his hand. An excited thrill ran through Steve as he slid his hand into Tony's. They went back to walking, this time hand-in-hand, and Steve was so happy he could not stop smiling even if he tried.
Steve shrugged again and murmured, “I grew up in New York City, so I never needed a car, and I don’t have many friends so never saw the use of Facebook…”
With that in mind, he pressed zero, feeling odd with no rotary to spin, and held the phone up to his ear. Dr. Pavlov’s face pinched in confusion and he asked, “One number?”
“Yeah,” Steve breathlessly replied. “I think I’ve been a little bit in shock ever since I found him…”
Natasha nodded. Her usually stoic face was blank but her eyes danced with joy as she looked down at her soulmate.
Steve and Tony’s lives molded together easily. Tony woke up every morning in Steve’s arms and never grew tired of seeing his initial smile whenever he woke.
Turning to the screens, Steve murmured, “He’s doing well. The mission is almost done and he and Natasha will be home soon.”
He'd been denied a relationship with the man and it made Peter upset. And then it upset Peter even more that he was upset by that because Stark wasn't his father! Richard was! It was a constant circle of upset and anger that he could not find a release for.
Steve’s chest swelled with excitement and he had to restrain himself from hugging Mary. Instead, he wrapped an arm around his husband and Tony happily returned the half hug.
Tony shot to his feet and flight stabilizing chips, worth thousands of dollars, fell to the floor and shattered. Tony did not care as he exclaimed, “WHAT?! Where’s Steve!? Is he okay?!”
Eddie nodded sadly and whispered, “I know you may never forgive either of us but…but I have control of Venom now, thanks to the doctors at the Vault. I can help people now…and, if you’ll let me, I can help you.”
Tony rolled his eyes and sighed heavily with frustration. His father was digging for more unneeded information and Tony could easily deny him but…Tony crossed his arms over his chest and haughtily stated, “You came up with the idea,
Peter bit down on the thumb and sucked on it lightly, making Wade groan again. He began to rock faster against Peter and thrust down harder. Wade gasped, “Your eyes are swallowing me whole.”
Blondie cleared his throat and looked from Peter to Twitchy then back to Peter again. He said, “Hem, yes…well, we were wondering if we could speak with you, Peter. Are-Are you alone right now?” Blondie tried to look over Peter’s shoulder to see if anyone was there. Peter automatically closed his door some to limit Blondie’s view.
“Hello Happy,” both Ben and Steve replied simultaneously then grinned at each other. Happy nodded and stepped away to give them some privacy.
She gasped and grabbed at his hands, digging her nails into his flesh and breaking them on the metal. Her light green eyes were huge and wet from tears. She looked at him in shock like she could not believe he was doing this.
She shook her head gravely replied, “It’s not that either, Howard. Do you remember Dr. Erskine’s assistant? That quiet, tall man? He was found dead last week in his home. Apparently, he fell down his stairs and broke his neck.”
. He saw it before when he revealed his face but – but now he could see that it was alive. Its dark tentacles were swaying above him.
New York was a completely different world in the early morning hours. The only people out were the homeless, sleeping in the nooks or alleys, and the streets mostly held bored taxi drivers, waiting for their shifts to be over. The air in the city always had a hint of exhaust to it thanks to the abundance of traffic and even when there were barely any cars out Steve could taste it coating his mouth and throat. The air was cold and his breath fogged upon every exhalation. Steve wore sweatpants and a tight under armor, short-sleeved shirt. Despite the skin of his arms being exposed, Steve was moving fast enough to get his blood pumping and to stay warm.
It was encouraging and reminded her of the day they first met. There was obviously something more there than the machine their masters wanted her mate to be.
Tony spared Steve once last glance before stepping onto stage and his fiancé graced him with a big, happy smile in the parting.
“No,” Steve replied, “I don’t want to.” He wanted to hold Tony for the rest of his life. Already, in his head, he envisioned a number of scenarios in which he would propose to Tony. Instead, at that moment, he decided to lower Tony down in a dip and kiss him deeply. Tony’s head was inches from the ground and Tony’s feet were above both of them.
The Chitauri collapsed around them and Steve knew Tony had done it. He’d saved them all…but…He waited with vain hope, his eyes glued to the black hole.
As soon as Tony was at his side, however, all those emotions vanished. He stiffly pushed himself up and demanded from both of them, “Are we done here?”
Natasha turned back to him and crossed her arms over her chest. She regarded him for a few seconds then asked, “Are you going to tell me why James has been acting so strangely or why you, him, and Tony go quiet around me?”
Tony’s surprise lasted a second and then he nearly chided himself. Thor wasn’t just a goofy guy who loved poptarts and infomercials, he was a master tactician like Steve. He had fought and led in hundreds of battles and was even more experienced than Steve. It was a good plan. It was their only plan…but it could work, except…he didn’t wholly trust Barnes, especially with Steve’s life.
“Beloved, starting now and till the end of our lives you are going to be throughly knowledgeable in all my sounds,” Tony stated, running his hands down Steve’s  chest. His muscles felt
Steve stopped breathing, his vision immediately blurred with tears, and then his brain shut down, unable to handle the sight his eyes beheld.
As soon as they got word the Captain was with Stark, Fury knew he had to detain both men for questioning now he had one unconscious and another had just shot at him.
DUM-E squealed excitedly and drove around the new piece to the lab in excited circles. Tony grinned at the robot and did not to discourage its actions.
“I thought keeping Stevie’s secret was hard enough but now I’m gonna have to deal with keeping your secret too! I can already tell you’re going to be just as frustrating as him.”
Everyone backed off Venom immediately with the exception of the Hulk. The Hulk continued his fight with Venom and did not even seem to notice Steve was there.
The spinning in Steve’s head intermingled with the guilt and made him feel sick. He mutely handed his son to Tony and his boyfriend accepted him with a relieved sigh. Tony promised, “Peter and I will be right here this entire time, Steve…”
“…You killed your girlfriend?” Tony whispered. The horror in his voice made Peter cringe. The elevator had yet to come and Peter wished it was faster. Yet…in the time it took to get to this floor, perhaps he could explain some, just enough so that Tony would not think he was a coldblooded murderer.
With his program, people merely had to input their times into SI Online and they’d be matched with several people with the same time. The comprehensive questionnaire they’d have filled out, when signing in, would be used to determine their best match of the listed individuals.  They then use the site to plan a meetup and meet to see if they’ll find their soulmate. Their timers would usually reset before the meeting but many went either way just to make sure. If not, they check back in with SI Online for the next match.
Steve face went bright red and Tony knew he went too far. He rose slightly off his friend but Steve’s hold on his hips tightened and forced him to stay. Tony could not breathe for a few seconds without risking hearty groans from escaping. Steve’s cock was digging into his rectum, pressing into the soft flesh. It felt so good. Steve couldn’t know what torture he was putting Tony through!
He and Bucky got on line for food and Steve numerously looked over his shoulder to Tony. Tony always seemed to be looking his way too and Steve would turn away from him with a pleased smile.
Steve tossed him his undershirt and Tony pulled on the tank and then the rest of his uniform. He smiled down at the plain mechanic uniform and then grinned at Steve. He felt like a kid again, dressing up like a Commando to help Cap, but now it was actually happening!
Peter spent the rest of the night pacing his room and periodically looking at the crumbled business card on his desk.
His heart clenched as he remembered the spot on the bridge he and his friend used to sit and watch the boats float by.
The Goblin looked at the reactor thoughtfully and, for a moment, Steve thought Fury may had gotten through to the beast.
The guy was reviewing several theories. The first two or three minutes were dedicated to the first theory, that he was Tony Stark’s clone. He compared photos of Peter and Tony and debunked it, Peter after all, inherited some of his mother’s features.
He loved this. Loved falling asleep in Steve’s arms. It was the most content feeling he’d ever experienced. But what he loved more was the fact that this would continue every night from now on.
“Wade?!” Peter gasped in horror and Venom withdrew immediately. Wade fell to his knees and Peter fell with him, catching Wade and willing Venom away from Peter.
Steve slipped his phone in his pocket and embarrassedly murmured, “There was this woman and I overheard…”
Steve stood off to the side and rocked the baby to keep him happy. It was with this pause, he finally had a chance to pull out his phone and call his fiancé. He put the phone onto video mode and waited for his face to appear. It only took a few seconds for Tony to answer and, by the way his face took up the entire screen, Steve knew he was answering from inside the Iron Man suit.
Wade was not in the know and was prattling on about what he thought Tony was going to unveil. All of his guesses were obviously wrong but Peter did not spoil his fun as he described the outlandish Iron Man suits he came up with that contained upgrades like a pancake launcher.
Steve nodded unable to open his mouth without fear of vomiting. He’d never been so nervous going into battle. When he fought he, at least had some control of the outcome but, in this, he had no way to fight. He’d already done all he could by “faking” a relationship with Tony. Even with an honest to God relationship with the man did nothing to stem favor. Tony’s lawyers were the ones fighting in the trial and all Steve could do was sit beside them and wait.
Tony plunged the dry towel into the water right next to where Steve was sitting. He stirred the towel beneath the water to make sure it was totally wet and the cloth caressed the side of Steve’s hips and just ghosted over the clenching muscles of his ass.
“I’m glad you are glad, my Darling,” Steve replied and his smirk told Tony Steve knew exactly who he was trying to annoy and he was joining in. Tony grinned at him. He loved Steve’s spunky side. Hell, who was he kidding? He loved everything about his Honey-Pie.
“Uncle Ben,” Peter whined, his tiny fingers clutched his dog-tags all the tighter, bending the metal slightly under his strong grasp.
“Soulmates,” Steve explained with a smirk. “And if I’ve been unconscious and frozen away…that explains a lot about how I was able to dream with Tony…but that doesn’t matter right now. What matters is that I get to him.”
? Your world must have turned upside-down! Tell us about Peter! Show us some updated pictures! Please, we’re dying to know about your son, Steve!”
“Pepper’s gone missing,” she replied. “She was last seen with a woman claiming to work for the Mandarin. She told Pepper she wanted to stop him but it might have been a draw to lure her in. We think they are going to use Pepper to get to Tony.”
Clint was wordlessly shooting his arrows at a spot on the wall. The spot had originally been a blank space above the couch but now had a chunk missing from the number of times he had fired there. Any other time, Steve would have told him to stop but at that moment he did not care about the state of the wall.
Thor nodded again and departed with his cape billowing behind him. She watched him until he closed the door behind him.
“Tony?” Steve’s voice woke Tony and he groaned. His head was killing him. He opened his eyes but closed them with a hiss at the bright lights. Hadn’t Jarvis dimmed them?
!” Peter shrieked. Tears were streaming from his eyes in an endless flood and he looked absolutely terrified as he pushed at the black mass in vain.
As soon as he noticed Steve, he got out of the car and opened the back door for Steve. Happy explained, “Mr. Stark said you two would be needing a ride.”
Logan’s eyes snapped away from the trashcan and he murmured, “Sorry to disturb you.” The massive man slid off Wade’s dresser and went to leave, but paused next to the bin. He sniffed the air above it with a hard look and then he looked back to Wade and Peter one last time before leaving.
A hiatus of silence seemed to separate them even though neither of them moved but then Tony ran his hand over his mouth and muttered, “Fuck.”
And just like that, Venom sensed his thoughts and the restrictions on his chest stopped and he found he was able to breathe again.
Cable dropped a few more smaller pieces into the bag and he murmured, “These will have to do. We’ll scavenge for extra parts in the other era. We’re out of time.”
Tony tore off his gloves then the goggles and tossed them beside the piece of armor he was working on. He had odd circular bruises evenly spaced, starting at his wrist and going up his arm. Steve quirked an eyebrow at it but did not ask anything of it. Tony must have pinched himself on his new armor.
The suit flew him back to the top of the tower. Instead of landing on the balcony he had escaped from, they landed on the lower balcony on the community floor. His entire extended family was waiting for him and all of them looked angry. Uncle Bruce even had a little green tinge to his skin.
Steve finally released his hips to cover his face with his hands upon his groan. Tony did not try to pull away like he had earlier and even started to lightly rub himself onto Steve’s shaft, slowly enough so that his friend would not notice but with enough pressure to stimulate them both.
Steve looked at him with quirked eyebrow and dryly said, “Me having a relationship, where I originally had none, would in no way distract me, change me, or how I react and thereby change future events?”
He stepped past Harry and Harry closed the door behind him. His friend’s eyes widened a fraction then rolled with exasperation. Harry said sarcastically, “Jeez, nice to see you too, Peter.”
Tony dropped his hand and considered Jarvis’s inquiry. Finally, he whispered, “Nothing J…Not unless you’d know how to bring my soulmate back to life…”
Unbeknownst to them, the news broadcasts and social networks were flooding with news of their relationship. The Avengers were waiting backstage and were proudly watching it all from the TV on the wall.
He imaged his hands on Tony’s bare back and all the blood that had originally run to his face fell straight down to his groin. Steve sputtered and stepped away from the door.
Steve draped the quilt over Peter’s shoulders and sent out a prayer to Mary and hoped she knew Peter was doing well.
Bucky started to come out of his shell too. He talked more, expressed his opinion, and let that old Brooklyn accent slip through a few times. His smiles were still too far in between but Tony was working on that.
“Yes, mom,” Tony sighed and put down the coffee to oblige his mate. It was take out from his favorite Indian place. As soon as he opened the box, his mouth started to salivate from the heavenly smells and he dove in with the complementary plastic fork that had been taped on the cover.
Tony nodded and agreed, “No, we’ll stop them. The only monumental change that had occurred was our relationship so something must have happened because of it...Ending it will hopefully save Steve.”
By the agency’s estimate, 95% of the inmates were found and returned to their cells. The Chameleon was a part of the 5% who were not found.
He wrestled with the morbid thoughts and hopes as he stared at Steve’s back and measured his breaths.
"Extra olives and extra dry, so I am better prepared to hear about the person who has Tony Stark tripping over his feet to avoid talking about."
Scratching the back of his head, Peter nervously smiled and said. “Well…I’m actually going to go over to Wade’s place right now.”
They ran into the courthouse just as quickly as they had run to the car. They expected to be late and that proceedings had started without them but Steve was surprised to see Marcel waiting for them outside the courtroom.
Heimdall tightened his hold on his sword as he considered his prince’s words. He reflected on the moment Thor was thrown to Midgard and the moment the Captain awoke from his decades sleep. He also recalled his duty to Asgard and what it may mean for Asgard if Thor was sidetracked by the affairs of Midgard.
If there had been any blood left in Steve’s body, it was all gone now as the remainder shot straight to Steve’s burning cheeks after hearing the endearment.
“We have no comment,” Tony stated gruffly, his voice biting through their sea of voices. They surged upon them, his statement having the exact opposite effect Tony had hoped for. The reporters all tried to push their microphones into their faces and with the layers of bodies trying to get at them, all they succeeded in doing was crush Steve, Tony, and Peter in the middle of their jostling bodies.
Peter’s party ended hours ago and his son was sleeping upstairs. He, Bucky, and Tony were sitting in his and Tony’s living room and Tony presented his idea about his first mission with Project Winterwidow.
The doorbell rang on Tony’s end and Tony moaned, “Are we still at ‘ding-dong?’ We’re supposed to be on total security lockdown. Come on, I threatened a terrorist. Who is that?”
Steve was sitting in a chair. His arms were tied down by metal straps but Tony could see the healing wound where his soul implant had been removed. Tony grasped his implant with an excited thrill. He hadn’t died!
Steve shifted everything he was holding to one hand in order to drape his arm over Tony’s shoulders. He whispered into his ear, “Your prize is me, tonight…tomorrow…and all the days after.”
Steve flushed and said, “You’re a Commando. You belong with the group.” Steve stepped closer and whispered to Tony alone, “And with me…”
Steve only knew he was sleeping around because Tony would arrive in the dreamscape naked sometimes and apologetically laugh as he imagined up some clothes for himself. Those were the nights Steve knew Tony had fallen asleep with a lover in his bed. Neither of them brought up the subject of Tony’s love life anymore or the near stolen kisses they had almost shared prior to the deaths of Tony’s parents. But it was there, hanging between them and Steve would feel its weight whenever Tony added another notch to his bedpost.
“I do too,” Steve whispered, lightly nuzzling his face into Tony’s. “I just didn’t realize you weren’t a morning person all this time and it just reminded me…” He didn’t finish but it didn’t need to be said. It was just a reminder that Steve wasn’t a part of Tony’s awake life…
Steve looked up at the moon with wide eyes. How was that even possible?? The white orb seemed so far away and unreachable.
His mind was still blown away by the fact that Steve was in fact the mysterious Agent Edwards...but he was also now able to piece together some of what Steve had gone through. He remembered Edwards mourning a lost fiance...and that had been Tony. Not to mention all that time that had passed...
Steve’s throated tightened for a moment as his emotions threatened to overwhelm him. He was alive. Thank God, he had survived.
The burning metal of his dog-tags seared into his flesh. The discomfort from that was the only thing that kept him focused and able ignore the rest of the pains of his body cooking alive. He was able to use it to remember Peter and center his mind on surviving for him.
"Don't say anything," Wade whispered. He was afraid of what Peter would say or how'd he react if Wade confessed.
“Steve,” Natasha hissed. She dropped her head and Steve waited. The sound of her voice was what stopped him. It sounded so raw, so human. It was not Natasha. Even Peter stilled in his arms and stared at his aunt with concern. Natasha continued in that voice, stating, “Steve, do you really want to
“Right here!” Peter gasped, pointing triumphantly to the spot where Tony had helped him screw back in some larger gears.
Grief and pity weighed down on Steve as he peered at Bucky's profile. Bucky was probably not meeting his eyes just to avoid seeing it in his gaze.
“We are not leaving this room until the contents of the syringe are empty. It’s your decision how that happens. Either take the syringe and inject yourself in the next minute or my soldier will inject your soulmate,” Schmidt stated.
dame! How many kids did we have? OH, MY GOD, WAIT!” Bucky grasped Tony’s shoulders and gravely asked, “Do I lose my hair?”
She gulped nervously...This could actually work. Her implant was zeroed. The Academy would think she had murdered her soulmate. She gulped dryly again as she imagined the deception. Was it worth it?
Steve stumbled a little when they landed but managed to stay on his feet this time. They were in a new place again. It was a closed off room with a lot of old lockers with what looked like mostly junk but Steve’s eyes focused and he saw guns, bullets, and materials for building more weapons. There was also two small cots, a small tv sitting on a slanted table, a desk cover in grime and wires, and a floor lamp which Cable proceeded to turn on.
If these events were still in motion, Tony's future might not have changed and may occur after all, but...
Tony did not hear the door open behind him but, just as Tony’s hands were venturing under Steve’s shirt, he heard Clint curse, “What the –?! Fuck, guys! Warn us!!
He’d be gone an hour at the most and Jarvis would continue their search for Cap’s shield and the elusive “Chewie.”
Steve smiled at him and pressed closer to him so his chest was against Tony’s. Their hearts beat erratically against each other’s, another thing he never noticed in the dream world but he kept noticing it now and could not get enough of it.
“And Iron Man can fly and Pops does not have as awesome of uniform like me, right Petey?” Tony asked, kneeling next to the boys as Peter sat up.
“Betrayed by my own boyfriend!” Tony gasped. Steve rolled his eyes at Tony then moved on to the next present.
“Steve!?” Bucky went to stop him again, but Steve wouldn’t let himself falter and kept striving forward. Bucky’s grip on him broke but his stride don’t break. Bucky followed close behind, cursing Steve’s stubbornness under his breath.
He and Tony pretended nothing had happened between them but their talking was somewhat forced which made Steve even more uneasy. Was this going to destroy their friendship now?
Tony had come up with a number of ways to propose (He watched all of those YouTube videos, remember?). But he needed a way to propose that was innately
They sat down together on a bench and leaned back into the table. Tony chuckled at Steve’s comment and took a sip of the beer. He leaned his head more heavily on one arm that just so happened to bring him closer to Steve and he discreetly looked at him as he drank.
“Want me to do what?” Tony murmured with a light groan as he continued to rub himself against Steve. Steve could not think clearly with all the blood rushing from his head. He was not in total control right now which could mean danger to Tony if Steve did not keep his strength in check. If Steve topped, he might literally rip his boyfriend in two and that was something he would very much like to prevent... So, in the end, it was easy for him to decide how to lose his virginity.
Tony lay pliant in his arms and watched Steve with a warm gaze, trying to outpour all the love he felt for him through his eyes alone. Steve smiled at him like he knew what Tony was doing and tucked himself right up to him. With their foreheads pressed together and their eyes locked, Tony whispered, “What are you thinking, beloved?”
A cold barrel was pressed against the back of her neck and she froze in response. Her hand, however, tightened on her pistol and she flicked the safety off.
blood. The edges of Wade’s vision darkened as his heart stopped but he resolutely refused to lose consciousness.
It was something so little and so silly. He never told Tony before because it was not very romantic.
“Are you threatening to expose my son??” Steve hissed. He stepped back and dragged Norman with him, pulling him clear across the desk.
It was just like the old times, him and Bucky getting together to solve a problem. It was what they were best at. As Bucky used to say, they were partners in crime.
He bent down and kissed Steve chastely. He pulled back and Steve grasped the back of his neck to stop him from pulling away further.
“Yes, sir. Outside forces destroyed the firewall but I am currently fighting them back. I am unable to access the Tower at this time.”
Wade leaned into the kiss Peter was initiating and he swore to himself that he’d love Peter with his entire soul.
“We are most likely going to meet hostiles. I need you to be able to fight,” she stated, dropping the gun in his hands. “And you’re the best with a gun.”
“I forgot about the Extremis,” Steve murmured weakly. “I reacted on instinct. I will be fine in a week.”
“I’ll willingly endure any stare down or awkward questions they throw at me,” Wade stated with vigor.
Recess was called as the judge needed time to go over the evidence provided before making his decision.
Once again, the feel of Tony’s lips against his flashed through his mind and he felt a strange combination of lust and dismay.
Tony could feel the metallic shards in his chest move as they closed in on his heart. But he had a sinking feeling that once they reached their destination all they were going to find was an already broken heart.
what made it all the better was that Steve felt the same! He didn’t think it was possible but his smile grew larger.
Steve should have pushed Bucky away but instead pushed himself back into the fold of his body and held his hand tightly to his chest. Steve curled into a ball and Bucky curled around him and held him close in his embrace. Bucky lightly kissed the back of his neck and Steve broke.
“Do you have something in your pocket or are you just happy to see me?” Tony asked cockily and Steve’s blush deepened. He flexed his abdominal muscles inward, hyperaware of the closeness of Tony’s hands to his penis. Tony had cupped him a few times when they made out but he never actually touched him flesh to flesh. His cock throbbed as he imagined it. His own feeble attempts at pleasuring himself probably paled in comparison to Tony’s ability.
“Oh, yes,” Tony growled suggestively and he straightened Steve’s collar as he pulled him into another kiss.
When the lights went out and they were immersed in darkness, Wade placed his hand over Peter’s on the armrest. Peter’s first response was to freeze but he forced his muscles to relax as his heart began to hammer dangerously fast in his chest. He hoped Wade couldn’t feel his pulse. He considered Wade’s actions though. Peter could pull his hand away and deter anymore of Wade’s advances without a word…It could go back to fun flirtations and nothing serious.
Peter got through the first five minutes before exiting the page. All the good humor he garnered from the prior video disappeared.
He mostly focused on the holograms. He helped in finding more Hydra people but…mostly he was searching for Bucky. There was a scattered paper trail. From what he could see, Bucky was considered more of a tool than a person, making their records less substantial. They didn’t put much value on his life in general. When they weren’t using him for missions, they put him in a cryostasis chamber in some warehouses where they stored out-of-date weapons.
“To think…our two years lie, we could really have been together all this time,” Steve murmured against his boyfriend’s lips. Boyfriend. God, he
The last couple of days they had been in close contact: bumping shoulders during a movie, grasping each other's arms or shoulders to grab attention, or their fingers grazing in touch for moments to pass a game piece or obscure item.
It was a warm night and neither of them needed additional layers to keep them warm. They walked around the perimeter of the building, mostly to themselves, save the occasional sentry.
“You have a freaking son!” Clint gasped as soon as Peter crawled past him. “What are you going to do?! I would be freaking out right now!”
She then testified to not telling anyone about what happened, fearing for her job but when Steve got her fired for not returning his affections, she finally came forward.
The mercenaries had them completely surrounded. Steve’s shield and gun were where they lay abandoned and Tony’s suit was damaged with only the repulsors to fight with. Their only chance was somehow alerting the team but Tony’s comms was destroyed with his helmet and they would notice if Steve activated the comms unit in his ear. Otherwise, they had no way to fight back without killing themselves in the process.
Hello! Sorry for the delay but as soon as I wrote this chapter out I decided I wanted to change the ending and had to rewrite it! Plus, I am in the process of moving so I have been busy with that process! BUT here it is! The final chapter! Yay!
“So soon?” Steve gasped. He had expected to have to wait for the American team’s expedition to end. His eyes were drawn back to the docks and he looked at one particular ship that had to be bigger than the Empire State building. He marveled at its size. How did they keep such a ginormous thing from sinking??
Tony’s eyes looked past the projection of Manhattan and the East River to the borough of Queens and whispered, “We need to tell May. I don’t want her to find out from the media…”
Howard circled him and murmured, “I can put it back together…I can do the same with you too. Can I remove one of your panels or…” Howard had fully circled him and came to a jolting stop in front of him, his father’s eyes focused on his chest.
The archer notched an arrow and pointed it at the soft flesh of his neck. His target surprisingly let go of his hands and reached out to the archer. Using the last of her air, she let out a strangled, “N-No!”
They stripped as slowly as they kissed and made love at just as a slow of pace. There was no hurry between them. As they gazed into each other’s eyes, they both wordlessly shared in their love and the knowledge that this was forever.
“We’ll find a way,” Tony murmured, his hand rubbed comfortingly at Steve’s hip. He whispered, “Come – Stop brooding.”
Tony would hear it all the way down in his workshop and, no matter how many times he’d hear it, he’d still pause what he was doing just to listen the sound. When Bucky first came to live with him, broken and so traumatized that he barely spoke, Tony never thought he’d hear him laugh like this again.
“The only reason I let you live was because you were an obedient dog, but here you are, chewing through your leash. I should put you down and train the bitch to take your place instead,” the monster hissed.
Less than a minute into his fight, Jarvis interrupted it by announcing, “Sir, the police are requesting assistance on a hostage situation. Backup is being delayed by the holiday crowds.”
With his emotions running high, Steve knelt beside Tony’s side and lightly caressed his dirty hair. He leaned in and kissed Tony’s parted lips but did it lightly enough that it did not wake him. Tony murmured something under his breath and shifted slightly on the couch. It drew a sad smile to Steve’s lips and his fingers continued to caress the fringe of his scalp and the side of his face. His modest goodbye was done and he needed to go but he found himself unwilling to pull away.
His master did not let him finish and pulled the trigger. Hot blood splashed her front and James slumped forward into her lap.
“Uh…Mornin’,” Tony announced his presence. His heart was racing with his increased adrenaline like his body expected to be attacked by something akin to a rabid dog at any moment.
The figure stood and the blackness melted away from the face, revealing Peter. Peter grinned at him and his eyes trailed down to where he held his box of knives in one hand and in the other he had the 24
“Hey,” Bruce whispered. Tony’s head snapped over to his left. Bruce sat on Tony’s other side and looked exhausted. The dark bags under his eyes were so dark that it looked like it was caused by black eyes and not sleep deprivation. His face drawn and his skin seemed taunt.
And live Tony did. He survived surgery without anesthetic, he survived torture, he survived starvation, he survived losing a friend, and then survived the harsh desert.
He wished he could take it all back but a small part of him, the part of him that had dreamed up those scenarios with Bucky, was glad and it disgusted Steve all the more.
..." He inhaled sharply and held his breath to stifle a sob. When he finally exhaled, he whispered, "Remember when you first brought us to the penthouse in New York and I told you, wherever you are, it’d be my home?” Steve’s voice shook a little as he watched Tony struggle to keep his eyes open.
Steve dragged his hand down Tony’s abs then grabbed onto the front of his jeans right where it was fastened together then paused. Steve let his guilt distract him for only a few seconds before returning his attention to the man he was so madly in love with. He let all his inhibitions go and let his mind grow hazy with lust. Steve was being selfish but he desperately wanted to make love to Tony one last time…
“Why do you always feel the need to add that little tidbit?” Steve groaned, burying his face into Tony’s shoulder. Every time they retold the story Tony found a way to squeeze that fact in there.
Bucky picked up his tray and replied, “Alright, punk, but no frisky business. I got my eye on you two.”
In addition to the breathing mask, Bucky was strapped into the machine by metal bars and had several wires attached to him to monitor his health. He was slumped over and began to breath in loud, shallow gasps as if he’d run a marathon nonstop. Eventually, he caught his breath and he raised his gaze. His dark blue eyes focused on Tony through the messy fall of his hair and Tony saw no sign of his old friend in the gaze.
Wade hummed thoughtfully to himself and got a distant look in his eyes. Peter pressed his head onto Wade’s shoulder and asked, “What’s up, babe?”
Tony broke up with him and he had haltingly told Steve it was because of the very rules Steve came up with. He ruled out the first two quickly neither had been affectionect in public nor had Steve's status been leaked to the press.
Peter crawled forward and smashed the toy into the softer stuffed animal. Steve and Tony followed, both laughing and leaning into each other as their toys joined the outlandish fray. At one point in the battle, as Dr. Teddy deflected one of Hulk’s attack with his fluffy armor, Tony gaze found Steve’s and he smiled genuinely at him, his eyes sparkling as he did.
Steve couldn’t hold back anymore and returned his hands to Tony’s body. He grasped his hips and helped smooth his thrusts. He splayed his fingers across his skin, reveling in the feel of his slick flesh.
A look of extreme concentration crossed his face as Peter took his question seriously. Steve muffled a chuckle as he waited. As the elevator doors closed behind them, Peter finally replied.
Many nights were also sleepless because their new son was teething and fussy and some nights Tony would be pacing the kitchen with the weeping baby and he felt on the edge of tears himself.
Tony waited and hoped against hope that he was wrong, that Barnes would have a change of heart but the Winter Soldier did nothing. He merely leveled his cool gaze on the door Natasha had just exited and said nothing. He was probably waiting for Natasha to come back to sacrifice herself to him.
Tony shrugged on his jacket and eyed his fiancé uneasily. What was going through Steve’s mind? He asked, “You okay, babe? Do you want to hold off on this? All the people know is that I’m making a big announcement. I can just announce the new Iron Man model…”
“Alright…Well then let’s start from the beginning…to when we first started dating.” Tony sighed loudly then said, “I waited to ask out at first for two reasons…firstly, because I did not think you were gay, which you already know. Secondly…I never thought you would want someone like me…”
Hello all! I’m sorry for the mega hiatus! I took on a second job and then volunteered to plan my friend’s bachelorette party that was taking place in a completely different state and, well, working two jobs on top of being a party planner takes up a lot of time! XD
“No, bad call!” Tony gasped, “He loves his hammer!” He reached out to the god but he pushed Tony away like he was nothing.
Over the years, the area had changed. Originally, it was just a corner with an old couch which Tony used to crash on when he was too exhausted to go up to his apartment. Now it had a huge couch that all three of them could lounge on. Steve had claimed the area as his own and his favorite fleece blanket lay over the back of the couch. Steve’s sketchbook sat on a side table along with a cup of pencils for him to pick from. A floor lamp sat behind the side table and its bulb hung over the spot were Steve usually sketched. The wall behind the couch was covered with pictures of their huge family made up of Steve, Tony, Peter, the Avengers, and the Parkers.
Steve smiled at his friend and accepted the communicator. He put it in his ear and called out, “Avengers assemble!”
“Alright,” Steve agreed. “That's fine. Ben and May will take good care of him…And Bucky? If the Tower is locked down…?”
Peter gulped dryly and his throat bobbed uselessly. His panic rose like a blasting rocket as he imagined standing in front of all of those cameras.
Steve raised his eyebrows at the man’s audacity. He had no chance against Steve. Yet his gaze rose and he saw this man’s strength did not come physically but was represented in the presence of the multitudes of cameras in the area. And every one of them was pointed at Steve and the detective.
“Captain!” Marcel called out to him. Steve turned and saw his lawyers standing down the hall. Marcel waved him over and the churning in his stomach turned to lead and weighed heavily in his gullet.
The boys were literally jumping with excitement by the time Steve and Tony stepped into the elevator.
When Peter woke, he found Wade’s limbs were wrapped around Peter like an octopus and his face was buried in Peter’s hair. He was still asleep and breathing evenly, his exhales moving Peter’s hair with every breath. Peter shifted closer to Wade and the older man sighed contently. Peter smiled and pressed his face into Wade’s neck. He inhaled deeply and decided he liked the way Wade smelt. His natural smell was now stronger having sweat and slept in it. Peter slowly traced his nose along Wade’s neck, enjoying his boyfriend’s natural musk.
“We used the Tesseract to bring you here. The Red Skull himself was here to insert it into the machine but he removed it as soon as you appeared and left with it because you did not seem to be functioning. He couldn’t let himself nor the Tesseract fall into enemy hands.”
– you just need to stay awake. Keep your eyes open, Tony!” Steve begged, fat tears welled in his eyes. This couldn’t be happening.
Tony smiled sadly at their clasped hands then gently slid his hand out of Steve’s grasp again. Steve’s hand twitched and wanted to grab his hand once more. A wave of fear ran through him, for half a second, he thought he would lose Tony forever if he did not grab him.
Tony grasped his arm too and pointedly said, “Yes, I am sure. I barely know the man and won’t get to know him unless I interact with him.”
Tony turned back to the lawyers and explained to the group of people before them, “I’m Steve’s dirty little secret.”
Tony was holding Peter again and stared blankly at the ceiling. When he comprehended Jarvis’s words, he gasped, “WHAT?”
Peter fought its hold and fought to breathe but Venom was stronger. He could feel it fighting to break free and pummeled Peter’s body without a care. He could hear people trying to speak to him through the speakers, but their voices were muffled.
“Yes, fricken monkeys! And the worst part was -!” A belled text tone went off from Clint’s hip and Clint brought the tale to a halt as he held up a single finger and stated, “Hold it!”
His eyes focused on Tony and that joy grew into bliss. He was returning to more than just his friends now.
Once she was as bare as he was, she grasped both of his hands and made him cup both of her breasts and they groaned together upon the contact.
“You are so cruel,” Steve groaned. Tony grinned and confirmed his teasing abilities as kneaded his hands into Steve’ pecs and twerked his nipples as he humped onto Steve’s thigh.
He paused in his clean up and looked up to her from where he kneeled. She stared at him blankly, hiding her emotions, but James could read her. She had tells on the way she clenched her fists and held his gaze.
“Running field tests,” Eddie smartly stated and Peter tossed the book back at him. Eddie caught it with a grin.
His son wore a smaller version of Tony’s hospital gown and already looked so much healthier since Steve last saw him. Venom stirred excitedly and, in his excitement, the symbiote was able to make Steve take a step toward Peter. Steve wanted to study all of Peter’s improvements but he had to tear his eyes from Peter and it felt like he was tearing himself in two.
He loved his birthfather and loved hanging out with him and the rest of the Avengers but he also loved the anonymity of his life. He loved being able to go past the paparazzi and having them look straight through him. He loved no one giving him a second glance when he walked down the street. But, mostly, he loved simply being Peter Parker: a guy who loved science and geeked out over comic book references. It protected his other life as Spider-Man. No one had ever guessed the correlation between the two because Peter’s life was so “boring.”
Peter started to cry again and Ross shot at Steve’s legs, where Peter had been hidden from him. Steve immediately acted upon Peter’s wail and spun around, snatching Peter and pushing Tony from his side. Sand exploded where they all had been a moment earlier as Ross unloaded the rest of his clip into the spot.
Peter relaxed into Wade’s hold. His nerves melted away. He knew he could trust Wade’s words. He broke from the embrace and said, “I am
Even as he unraveled, Tony’s gaze never broke from his and always burned with unwavering love. Steve hoped his eyes also conveyed the undying devotion he had for the man as he stared back.
“Telling Peter the truth may have been hard, but you were rewarded with a lasting relationship in the end,” she rationalized.
someone! Please, let us help you! We’ll go back to the Tower and we’ll lock you away in the Hulk cage until Bruce or Mary find a cure!”
It took all of Steve’s willpower to stay in the cage when Venom first appeared. They thought they would have to lead the monster to him but it came as if it was being pulled on a tether.
“I walked off on Wade when he wanted me to talk to you instead of…well, doing other stuff,” Peter explained with an embarrassed flush to his dad. “And…I need to apologize to him. It can't wait. I was an ass to him and he doesn't deserve it.”
Peter bit the back of his hand and moaned heatedly as Wade continued to suck. He wrapped his legs over Wade's shoulders and pressed his heels into Wade's back, pressing him to continue as he panted for breath. They'd both gone to bed nude the night prior so everywhere Peter touched was met with naked flesh.
She sat him beside Steve and James continued to shake. It had nothing to do with the cold. He was used to the cold but the pain from disobeying the Red Skull refused to dissipate. Steve was pressed heavily into his side and could feel his shivering.
“Hello, Stark,” Norman grinned. His muscles shook with the effort to hold back the suit with all its thrusters going off.
Mac’s station fridge was currently being emptied. Eddie had put back the VENOM beaker and filled it with a dyed liquid that mirrored the original. It would be destroyed without anyone knowing they had taken it. However, if their experiment worked, and they shared their findings, they were going to have a lot of explaining to do….At that moment, however, neither one of them were thinking about the paperwork they'd have to do because their experiment was
Tony didn’t get a chance to say anything. His hand tightened on his reactor and the glow grew brighter and then…he was gone.
Steve took a steadying breath and closed his eyes, he remembered his last moments with Tony and imagined him there with him, only centimeters away.
Tony gaze fell back to the blank face of Iron Man, remembering when his biggest concern had been asking Steve to marry him.
“There’s no need to thank me. I love to see Peter. Think of me as your go-to guy whenever you need someone to watch him!”
Mary sighed heavily then sat down on the nearby lab stool. She motioned for him to sit on the other and Ben did so stiffly.
When they left the tub, their fingertips had wrinkled with excess water and the tub water was freezing.
Steve had noticed it years prior but never said anything. He stated, “The dead have no need to age, I suppose…”
Peter sighed heavily too and was tempted to ask his father to use his power to do so. But…even then, Peter would still be in the spotlight. Even if they did believe Tony, everyone would then know him for being a relation to the great Tony Stark. He had always been an insignificant nobody. When the Parkers had cut ties with the Starks, before his birth, they also cut any ties with the fame that came with the Stark name. But now he was in the limelight and even if his dad was able to make them believe they were uncle and nephew…since he had no other children, Peter would still be considered the inheritor to his fortune… In the end, Peter was ousted as the Stark heir.
Steve gulped and did as his friend commanded. He kept his one hand in Tony’s so he could keep caressing his palm but Steve started to move his thumb too. He could not caress Tony’s palm because his thumb was in the way so he caressed the small patch of skin between his thumb and pointer finger.
“Harry will never forgive you,” Steve teased. He rested against the counter next to Tony and leaned into his side. They both watched the boys chase the robot around for a moment. Peter projected annoyance in his voice but his face portrayed his true feelings of excitement.
The question came out of nowhere. Tony instantly assumed he was going to antagonize them somehow about being separated…until he saw the expression cross Steve’s face.
Peter got to his feet. He could not be there, not with Gwen’s name still lingering in the air and his guilt from her death flooding through his system. He went through enough trauma today by agreeing to see his birthfather again. A father who had just miraculously appeared out of nowhere and totally skewed Peter’s life, a father who was now staring at him in horror.
went great. The news cast was welcoming and the interview was full of energy and positive interest. People genuinely were interested in his and Peter’s story and Tony was happy to share. He gushed about Peter and how brilliant he was. He also revealed Steve’s adopting him and how much Steve also loved Peter.
“Logan’s a good guy but I am not going to repo the shield because Logan doesn’t like the way Pete’s creation
Peter looked around at his collective family confused and he eyed the destruction of the kitchen with concern. Tony adjusted his hold on Peter and he looked up to Tony then looked back to Natasha and asked her, “Why you angry? Did Uncle Bucky do somethin’ bad?”
Tony sat up, pulling his tools away from the chips to give Steve his full attention. Tony said, “Thank me? There’s no need.”
Schmidt backhanded Tony with the blunt end of his gun, pushing him away. Steve was laying curled up on his side and the Red Skull viciously stepped on his head and pressed the gun barrel against the back of his neck. He whispered, “Goodnight, Captain.”
Tony paused after getting out of the shower and took a few steps backward to peer into the mirror again. The mirror was still slightly fogged but there was no mistaking the glow from his reactor.
Tony sat up with a huff and his eyes trailed over Steve’s bedroom. It was nondescript and he could tell it was furnished before Steve moved in. There were very few personal touches to the décor other than items that had been placed recently.
He ran straight into the nurses’ station, a large counter with various implements, and the stone cracked upon his impacting it. He caused several people to jump back or exclaim in fear. He pushed himself up, using the now unsteady counter, and murmured, “Sorry, I-I will fix that. Wh-Where’s Tony-Tony Stark?”
The second and final indicator is more for the mates to confirm that they are indeed mates. They merely need to touch and the implant will beep in confirmation what the mates will most likely already know, they have found their soulmates.
Tony lay beside Steve in the small space he provided between his body and the chair but kept his foot hooked in between his legs. The heat from Steve’s body burned into Tony’s flesh and made the rest of him feel cold. It would have been impossible to hide his half hard cock in such close quarters so Tony pressed it against Steve’s thigh.
Another silence grew, this one more oppressive than the last and the look on his father’s face…Peter felt sick by it, it looked like he had personally gutted the man. He didn’t want that. He didn’t want this to happen at all. He was already desperately pinning for the awkward dinner he had originally imagined.
Peter smiled at both of them and then tried to shift but groaned as his skin tingled with pain. Both men were awake in an instant and Tony even sleepily hissed, “Wha’s wrong??”
It all stopped when Peter felt a sharp, painful jolt to his chest the same moment the Goblin crushed the arc reactor.
“Peter…” Wade sighed heavily. He must have noted Peter’s pain and he cupped Peter’s face with both hands. He looked at him with sad eyes and whispered, “You’re badly injured…That was too close…” His thumbs traced along Peter’s cheekbones and then he bent down to press his forehead to Peter’s. He breathlessly continued, “Oh, Peter…What can I do for you, baby boy? I wish I could share my mutation with you...How can I make you heal faster like this? I hate to see you hurting…My baby boy should be lounging on a plush unicorn being hand fed chilled grapes…not in some SHIELD regulated hospital bed looking more dead than alive…”
The Parkers came next, Ben and May picked up Peter and plastered his face in kisses. Sam arrived not long after and Peter enthusiastically greeted the Falcon. Sam visited a few times before the world discovered Peter’s existence and Steve was glad to see Peter remembered him.
The President sat in his office, looking over documentation laid out for him by his secretary and Steve took his position behind him. He kept his eyes on the door, the only exit, and watched it as he was trained to do by SHIELD. One of the secret service agents came in with more paperwork and sat across from the President. They started going over the documents, something about a possible trade embargo. Steve droned them out after a while.
Steve sleepily blinked open his eyes and smiled softly when he noticed Tony’s attempt at sitting up.
I literally had to rewatch Iron Man twice and rewrite this entire chapter like three times until I was satisfied with it! XD
She wordlessly slipped forward and her SHIELD escort followed closely. When the agent realized she was going to the room, he grabbed her arm and hissed, “Wait! You can’t go in –.”
He didn’t tell Cable. He knew the stoic man would not approve. It was risky and stupid, but Steve had to do this at least. He could not go near the love of his life, but he could make sure he was safe.
Tony’s heart skipped a beat but he played it off and teased, “Oh, are you proposing Captain Rogers?”
Later that night, after spending time with the Avengers and having the most fun he ever had in years, Peter stumbled into the house he shared with his Aunt May.
“They know you have only been in contact the last few years and said that it was because Tony was respecting your parent’s wishes. We insinuated that those wishes were that you continued to believe the Parkers were your parents.”
Tony offered to show them to their rooms and Steve, Bruce, and Clint followed him. Peter shot questions at Tony, all of which Tony answered enthusiastically.
That left his last hopes with the fifth, who happened to be growing within one Mary Parker. The woman was the hardest to capture and the hardest to keep imprisoned. SHIELD taught her more than science and spying. She could fight, evade, and escape. Had she not been pregnant, she might have actually succeeded in getting away.
Peter grasped his hand and leaned it on Wade’s thigh as he whispered, “You’re making a very serious face right now. You should be laughing at my Pops’ lame-ass jokes.”
“Try to sleep, beloved,” Tony whispered as he closed his eyes, already feeling pulled to sleep by Steve’s near encompassing presence.
Peter’s breath caught in his throat. Wade wasn’t looking at him and Peter was suddenly reminded of all the fanfiction on the internet starring Spider-Man. His usual romantic interest was usually a certain merc with a mouth.
Tony held Steve tightly as he guided him into the kiss. His facial hair scratched at Steve’s skin and his lips had a hint of whiskey on them. But they were warm and soft and so gently that Steve barely noticed. Steve followed every tilt Tony’s head, chased every stolen breath, and loved every moment of their intimate contact.
The car rocked him to sleep and its rough engine was his lullaby. With every bump, he was jostled near consciousness, however, the pull of unconsciousness was strong enough that his mind began to drift and dream.
Before he felt it, he heard his bones fracture and break, like the sound of a glass being shattered. He rolled like he was supposed to but the impact still managed to cause damage. He quickly categorized his injuries as they occurred. The first was his leg snapping as he did not bend it in time, then he dislocated his left shoulder as he forced his body to roll, and then the pressure crushed his chest breaking his ribs and God knows what else. He only concentrated on the pain from his broken bones for a millisecond because the intense heat from the inferno hit him all at once.
A few moments later, Osborn walked into view of their hiding spot. Steve clenched his fists, wanting nothing more than to throttle the man for everything he’s done to his family.
Peter lost interest in the couch and went to work at his mock workstation. As the workstation started to make whirling noises, Steve picked up his head and found Tony leaning back against a counter and was watching Steve. As he looked at him, Steve realized he was wearing the same clothing yesterday and there were dark bags under his eyes.
Steve was just as silent as Tony as they walked out of the tent but, once they were out of the hearing of the others. He privately whispered, “I’m sorry, Tony…for everything. I just want to make sure you make it back to the future…and…”
With his arms crossed over his chest, Bruce stated, “You are going to be monitored the entire time you are out of bed and as soon as your nurse says you have to go back, then you are going back, no exceptions.”
Steve nodded but the flush still lingered in his cheeks. Tony eyed Steve and an unease began to gurgle in his stomach. Steve was clearly unnerved by his minor advances. Last night he said he was fine with this but now that it was actually going into motion was he having second thoughts?
Via the news they were able to see that Tony still went to the gala and then through random sources on the internet saw he still went to Gulmira. He was still doing what he had originally done according to Cable. Yet Steve’s presence had somehow changed something – something that would end up killing Steve in the end.
– they were unchanging. They were permanent. They were ingrained into him since the beginning. He could never fight them.
“The top forms just need your approval,” she stated. “They are statements that will be made in your name. To sum it up, you will be telling the media that you are Tony’s son, you love him very much, you are happy you were able to reunite, and you wish the media to respect your and your family’s privacy during this time.”
Hello! Sorry for the delay! I took an impromptu, mini road trip with my friends and fell behind in my writing because of it! BUT you get a much larger chapter than usual and its only a few days late so win-win?
He drifted into his dreams, slipping out of his love’s warm embrace and right back into his familiar open arms in the dream world.
Needless to say, the rest of the night was spent dodging security but they had fun with it, pretending they were spies on a secret mission. Peter never had so much fun or done so many ridiculous things in one night not dressed as Spidey.
Steve grinned. He recognized this side of Tony. He only prattled on like this when he was nervous. Steve slowly stalked up to Tony and replied, “I am real. This is not a dream. And I am completely naked underneath this bathrobe.”
After making love, Wade and Peter fell asleep in each other’s arms. Wade fell into one of the most deepest and content sleeps he had ever taken but, he still woke when he felt Peter slip from his arms.
She joined him on the mats and he backed up to the opposite side of the mats. Everyone stopped whatever it was they were doing and strolled up to the mats to watch. Wade stayed sitting on his stack of mats and Clint took his perch on the mats stacked next to him. Bucky stood in Natasha’s corner, watching her with a smug grin and Peter's parents stood near him. They leaned into each other and smiled encouragingly at him when he looked to them.
Bucky upturned his right arm, exposing his implant. He’d gotten a new one the day before he and Natasha married and didn’t meet her eyes until they were at the altar so their countdown was timed for the moment they married.
Steve smiled sweetly at him and, for a moment, Tony forgot why he was mad at him. Steve curled his fingers around Tony’s and whispered, “Thank you…”
When he went down the hallway, he caught a glance of himself in the mirror. He looked completely normal expect his eyes. His eyes were his own: large, scared, and unblinking.
Taking the hint, Coulson replied, “Then I should be going. You probably do not want to explain my presence. Submit your forms again, Stark.”
Barnes watched her go and said nothing. He did not call for her head. He was silent and his eyes were unreadable.
Tony closed his eyes for a moment and let all the pain he’d been hiding wash through him. In that moment, he let himself miss his future, his friends, and his simpler life.
"Yeah, didn't go exactly as planned but I am persistent when it comes to my girl," Bucky replied with a happy, warm voice. "Can you come pick us up? We're at that Hydra Base in France and the room to the time machine is sealed up tight."
Steve led Tony to the kitchen. He instantly opened the pantry and grabbed a bag of pretzels. He tossed it to Tony who caught it and looked at his questionably.
“We’re on it,” Steve stated. He motioned for the Avengers to move out. Everyone jumped into action with the exception of Bruce who took his place by Peter. The Hulk would not be needed in such a delicate situation. He would only go if Coulson had requested him specifically.
The ideal image of the American male is heterosexual after all… not to mention Peter was handsome so he was expected to date someone equally beautiful…
Natasha jumped behind the bench to put something between them and quickly shed her cumbersome coat, leaving her pistol in her pocket but revealing her weapon cache.
He squeezed his eyes shut and his lip trembled for only a moment but then Tony pulled away and Steve’s strength returned. He looked down at his friend and saw a more subdued look on his face. His hazel eyes were cast elsewhere but Steve could see the warmth was gone. He was both relieved and crushed by the sight.
Steve had tried calling him after he and Wade slipped away from the Tower but Peter didn’t pick up any of his phone calls, not wanting to deal with his parents for the rest of the night.
They walked around the hospital for what felt like hours to Steve. Yet every possible victim he came across had a plausible reason not to be consumed.
“Hey! Web-head! You sightseeing or fighting!?” Tony yelled over the intercom. Below him, he suddenly saw a blur of red and blue as Spider-Man hit one of the bots they were fighting. With a well-placed punch from his son, the robot’s head exploded and he dropped the inert machinery.
The doors were not locked and swung silently inward. The room was dark with the exception of a dim glow from single lamp on the desk. The light from the hall flooded the room.
Tony did not sleep, instead, he fretted about their kiss, questioned his sexuality, and worried over his friendship with Steve.
Any unease he had been feeling melted away and Tony felt as if his life was finally solidifying. Waking up with Steve had been astonishing the last few days and almost felt too good to be real. But, at that moment, he felt secure in Steve’s arms. He was there to stay. His soulmate was going to wake up with him tomorrow and all the days to come.
Steve was thanking his lucky stars that he read up on social media as a part of his history of this new era so it seemed like he knew what he was talking about.
The doors opened and Tony stated, “I don't need a babysitter. You took away that bottle of vodka. That was all I had. I swear.”
“And then he said the radio’s transmission was cut,” Tony wrapped up. “My dad looked everywhere for the wreckage…he had people looking for you till the day he died, but all they found was the tesseract.”
,” Clint groaned darkly with an overly exaggerated sigh. Bruce chuckled into his sandwich and Natasha’s mouth quirked to the side slightly. Thor grinned at Clint and looked on the verge of laughing again.
Tony pulled up another screen and pulled up Coulson’s files. He compared it to the others he’d uncovered and then sighed in relief, “No…No, he’s one of the good guys.”
By the tone of his father’s voice, Peter was instantly on the defensive and he immediately glanced at Steve, the very probable reason of how his dad found this out,  and saw he was frowning at Tony. He too did not seem happy by Tony's reaction. Peter'd never told Steve not to tell him but now Peter wished he'd been able to be the one to tell his dad, especially with this reaction. He looked back to his dad and tersely replied, “Wade. His name is Wade and, yes, I am dating him.”
Hill brought over chairs so they could all sit down as they began to discuss what to do about Pierce and Hydra. Tony automatically shifted his chair next to Steve’s and leaned into him. Steve wrapped his arm over his shoulder. Their public display of affection did not go unnoticed and the SHIELD agents all eyed them curiously but did not ask anything. Steve couldn’t help but wonder if they already knew about their affair and had known since they stared sleeping with each other.
He had to hear Pops’ voice, just one word, and he would gladly let the others drag him away. He just had to be sure – he just had to know that what his mind had determined was not true! It couldn’t be true!
Peter’s bunker was a small room with a bunk bed, a fridge, and a complete entertainment system. Peter was sitting on the top bunk and was wringing his hands together as he watched the news. He had watched his family fight dozens of times before but usually one of them stayed behind with him…and never before was their home attacked.
Natasha took the towel from Bucky’s hand and said, “Let me take this. You two have bigger things to worry about…”
For some reason, Tony paused for a response but he was met only with silence. He was alone in his corner and the Beta Jarvis wasn't near enough to reply.
Lust rushed through his body at the thought and Steve crawled back over to Tony. Tony was grinning madly up at him and fell back onto the bed when Steve hovered over him.
“I proposed to him this afternoon,” Tony stated with a grin. “Well…actually, I technically proposed several years ago. Time continuum and all. What year is it by the way?”
The image quality was amazing compared to the few photographs he'd seen in the forties. He clicked on one of Tony staring straight into the camera. It was the closest thing Steve had to staring into his eyes again and he did just that, staring into those dark hazel eyes as his heart twinged painfully.
At first, his entire being rejected the idea. He’d rather a thousand nuclear bombs be launched than lose Tony.
“Please, just Phil, Captain,” the agent said with a small smile. “I’ve been informed that you are leaving against our medical team’s wishes.”
"Captain America is needed and I have agents who are willing to step up and take to mantle if need be," Coulson stated.
“A love letter,” Steve stated with a nod and Bucky’s gaze turned inward and thoughtful as he already began composing it.
The electricity was not working so he was wearing one of his thin shirts to be able to work with light of his arc reactor.
The white blinked…an eye? Two eyes blinked and then a mouth grinned at him with pointed carnivorous teeth. Steve leaned back and garbled, “P-Peter?”
With that, he picked up his bag and ran out of there. Harold called after him but Peter couldn’t make out what he said and didn’t stop to see what was wrong. He ran until there were no more people and jumped down the first empty alley he came across.
He immediately made the photo his wallpaper and screensaver and paused to smile happily at the image. His heart swelled and he turned back to the real deal. He put the phone down and lightly kissed Steve’s chin. His hand snaked over his side and then groped his ass. Steve’s hips automatically shifted forward, pressing his cock into Tony’s and Tony muffled his chuckle into Steve’s cheek.
“Sorry,” Peter mumbled. “Just having a mini panic attack. No big deal. I’m currently adjusting to the fact total strangers are going to recognize me now and it’s not going too smoothly.”
“We were the ones who left you Howard Stark’s old notebook, making you able to find the Hydra time machine to find him. Everything was connected. We’ve almost reached the full circle,” Cable said, turning the gears on his time glove.
Bucky snorted and clapped Tony’s arm in return and assured him, “We’ll have to sit him down because I am going to make a goddamn speech out of it.”
Clint, from his space in the back of the van said, “And when she says everything, she means everything. We even want to know what Pierce likes in his coffee.”
“…Is this real?” Wade whispered, “Am I dreaming?” Wade clutched his head and cursed, “This is why I shouldn’t read fanfics before bedtime.”
“J,” Tony gasped tightly. He felt like a child again, afraid of the dark in his massive bedroom, and wishing the real Jarvis, his late butler, would come to make everything better again.
Steve bit down on his lip and whispered, “Bucky died before the crash and Peggy…Peggy doesn’t remember me…she has Alzheimer’s.”
Stark ground his teeth and Fury continued, “We came in here like this to take you by surprise. We did not know what was happening on the inside and we had no idea of your motives nor did we know of the Captain’s mental capacities after being frozen in the ice for so long. We could not take any chances.”
“I-I w-was just surprised,” he gasped. “It felt so good…felt so good that I could barely breathe.” His skin felt like it caught ablaze under Tony’s fingers. Steve looked bashfully down and murmured, “D-Don’t stop.”
He snuggled up closer to Tony and closed his eyes. With his head resting on Tony’s chest, even with his eyes closed he see the muted, blue glow.
The other body was curled on its side and was facing away from them. He wore black, dark ops leather and she knew he couldn’t be Steve so she turned her attention to Tony. Clint lead Thor to the other man, to check him over and make sure he was no threat.
What he saw made him…hopeful. Steve clearly was attracted to him and he seemed fine with Tony being attracted to him in return. Yet, the emotional aspect was still confusing. One moment, Steve was gulping and looking like he wanted to devour Tony whole and the next he was running away. What was Tony supposed to take away from that?
In the past, he and Cable had left late into the night and before that…Steve barely got a restful sleep…In fact, the last time he had slept soundly had been in Tony’s arms, before they found out about the Palladium poisoning. Being tired had been a norm for him, but now…now he and everyone he loved was safe.
Uncle Thor glanced at Peter and saw that he had heard. Uncle Thor nodded then flew him to the Oscorp Tower without pause. As he dropped him off on top of the tower he asked, “Are you certain, Peter?”
Smirking, Wade dropped the knives and pulled Peter into his embrace to kiss him silent. Peter was fine. Wade had been overreacting as usual.
Loki, the cause of all of this upheaval, was spotted in Germany and they were to bring him in. Steve almost sighed in relief over the mission. Loki was terrorizing innocent people, which was horrible, but…at least Steve could focus on the mission and not…other things.
When Cable saw the photo in his hand, he put two and two together and he leapt to his feet and demanded, “What the fuck did you do?!”
The shock and fear on Gwen’s face replayed clearly in Peter’s mind. He had to stop. He could not say any more. The elevator dinged and opened. He gasped sharply, “I’ve got to go.”
It took both of them a minute to realize the doors to the elevator had opened. In the time it took for them to reach Tony’s floor, his jacket and both of their shirts were on the ground and Tony had unbuckled Steve’s belt.
Steve waved to Peter but went to Bucky first and quickly repeated the terms Coulson told him. Bucky wordlessly nodded and made no other comment so Steve had to ask, “Can you do it, Buck?”
Tony spit out his chips and Peter dropped a mug. Bucky laughed and Steve looked like he was fighting laughing and frowning all at the same time which created an odd, warring expression on his face.
"Sorry about your mom, she did love Richard and didn't love me"...i.e. she slept around which, no, so not true but Peter would totally read it that way.
Peter peeked out from underneath his pillow and glared at the redhead. He grumbled, “What do you need me for?”
“Why?” Steve gasped. Mary worked for SHIELD. They should have been the first ones to know. They might have been able to get to Peter sooner if she just stepped forward.
“What happened?” Steve rasped, his throat growing tighter with his growing emotions. “Where’s Peter? Is…Is he –?” Steve didn’t want to voice it. By God, he didn’t want to even think about the worst-case scenario.
Steve stepped forward and Tony fell into step beside him. He was instantly reminded of all of the late night walks they took together at the Hydra base. Tony must have remembered too because they both were silent as they strolled away from eavesdropping ears.
Harold entered in his purchases at the register and Peter went back to the counter, pulling out his wallet.
Peter tipped back his head and stared at the ceiling. He processed his step-father’s words and finally let himself truthfully say, “Not good…I always knew this was a possibility but now that it’s happening…it’s terrifying…”
They had been leaving the house more and even Natasha was starting to join them. They were small excursions, walking down the road to the fruit vendor selling fresh strawberries off the back of his truck or getting a cup of coffee from the local hipster joint. Bucky liked getting the coffee the most and had gotten into the habit of pulling his hair back into a messy bun. Tony sometimes teased that he was turning into a hipster and Bucky usually scoffed or rolled his eyes at the idea.
With every smile they shared, Heimdall knew he was witnessing the rare form of love that was gifted to a few blessed unions every couple of centuries. Unusual circumstances usually brought these couples together and they were no exception.
Tony broke their kiss with a light curse and clutched his chest. Steve pulled back and worriedly undid his shirt. Steve could see where the reactor was beneath the bandages thanks to a smudgy circle beneath on the once stark white bandages. Steve couldn’t remember the number of times he’d taken these bandages off Tony but they never looked like that... His hands moved automatically but they shook as the loosened bandages released more smoke and Tony tightly gripped his shoulder as the smoke billowed more thickly.
Bruce’s gaze moved from Tony to Steve sympathetically and he nodded. He pushed himself out of the chair with a groan as a few bones popped. He whispered, “I will be right down the hall.”
Out of all of the moments he remembered of their time in the future, one of the most potent was when his adult son told him that he would have the reactor removed when Peter was still just a babe.
Peter’s mind was in such chaos that he couldn’t even begin to guess what Pepper would put on such a list so he asked, “What?”
“Anyways, he ran off and I thought I fucked up. Steve may have been crushing on me for a few weeks but I had been crushing on him for years! Hell, some of the first images I jacked off to were from his old recruitment posters,” Tony added.
“Fuck, yes,” Tony groaned and snapped open Steve’s pants. “Do you never wear underwear with your uniform?”
“…And why would I wear a hammock as I dance? And isn’t a lap dance something strippers do?” Steve asked extremely confused. He envisioned himself wearing a hammock like a toga. Why would
It was just him and Bucky. Pepper thought it best they go alone as they were the ones who truly knew Steve. Plus her presence at Stark Industries would make it a normal work day so no one would think anything strange was going on.
“Apparently it’s a past that does not matter anymore,” Bucky stated, shaking his head. Steve frowned when Bucky quoted Natasha’s words and knew the memory involved her. Bucky’s eyes trailed up Steve’s body, cataloging his wounds, and asked Steve, “How are your injuries?”
They returned to the sewer and Venom was already triangulating where they would surface next and play their fishing game again. Peter’s horror was so great he was at a loss for words to protest the atrocities.
That perked him up. Steve picked up his head and looked to Tony with wide eyes. He breathlessly asked, “Really?”
“What if… I try going to sleep first?” Tony murmured. Steve’s eyebrow shot up nearly to his hairline and Tony hesitantly explained, “I was in the darkness when I was falling out of the sky and…and I wasn’t afraid.” He gripped Steve tighter and, even though he was staring at his beloved, all he could see was the void of space. He said, “The darkness of the dream world compares nothing to the vast emptiness of space…when I entered that portal, I knew if it closed behind me I’d…I’d never see you again.” He met Steve’s eyes and he was brought back to Earth. His muscles relaxed and he whispered, “In the darkness of the dream world, I at least know you are coming and I won’t be alone.”
Tony fell asleep in the workshop. He had a cot there and clonked out on it but not before reminding Bucky he should sleep in his room when he grew tired. Yet, when Tony woke the next day, Bucky was still in the workshop and researching on the holograms.
who Deadpool is but, those who do, also know I'm Wade Wilson…Do you want it to get out that you're dating me? Plus, as soon as the press take one look at my face and, well…They’d probably wonder why you’re with me…what with all the…” He motioned to his head and said, “You know?”
Steve moved forward but she flinched back. Steve stepped back and whispered, “Mary…Mary. I-I just want you to know that what happened to you was horrible and if I could have prevented it I would have.” He saw the disbelief in her gaze and his voice dwindled as he said, “I…I’m so sorry.”
“Forgive??” Steve replied with surprise. Tony opened his mouth to reply but Steve silenced him by placing a single finger over his mouth.
Tony wanted to scream but he held his cool the best he could and shakily nodded. Steve put one of his hands over one of Tony’s and squeezed it reassuringly.
He brought in disgruntled officers to complain about him and the Avengers and civilians who felt like the Avengers could have done more to help them in the hour of need. Tony had called them crybabies and told Steve not to listen to anything they said because they were just whining. Steve tried…but he could not help but agree with the civilians… In certain instances, had they taken a different tactic, more property or lives could have been saved.
“Uncle Buckyyyy,” Peter squealed and ran to the super soldier. Bucky bent down to catch Peter’s hug and his usually hard expression relaxed.
Natasha’s breath hitched at the sound. His eyes rolled back into his head and he fell. Natasha jumped to him, catching him before he hit the floor.
Steve grabbed Tony’s arm and his dad glanced back at the super solider before turning back to Peter and stating at a more controlled level, “I know you are an adult and that who you choose to date is your own business but…but this is Deadpool. He’s a killer.”
Tony grinned and flexed himself out on full display, he spared no modesty with a sheet like Steve did. Steve blushed and took the picture. His eyes lingered on Tony and not the phone as he did it. He turned the screen toward him and Tony laughed as soon as his eyes landed on it. Steve had made sure the picture cut off just above his waist but it was low enough that anyone who saw it would know he was naked and proud.
Steve snorted and smiled wider at his friend. He said, “Alright, alright, you got me. I’ll go.” He was afraid of how Tony was going to react to him but…he also wanted to be with him, now even more so because Peggy was right…
Howard proudly dusted off the dirt from his earlier fall and explained, “Tony is a genius and I’ve been trying to figure out how I hadn’t heard of him before but it’s obvious now, he got it from me! To think, my son, the first time traveler. I wonder if I helped him build his suit? And what about this arc reactor you mentioned? You said he keeps it on his chest? Like 24/7?”
Natasha went to Steve’s side and Clint went straight to Tyler. Tyler was unsteadily trying to get to her feet but she snarled at the archer as he approached and Clint punched her right between the eyes, knocking her out.
He trailed his kisses up further. He nibbled along his jawline, his scruff tickled and irritated his lips at the same time.
“I…um,” he murmured, thinking. He decided with a smirk, “Well, I want something small, nothing like Steve’s last birthday…”
The third door opened easy enough and the dark corridor started off similarly to the one she and Bruce had ventured down, but theirs led them to a team of assailants, guarding Laura, locked away in a sealed room. Their hall contained things like barricades for someone to hide behind. But the third hall was just smooth walls and the only tactical advantage it would give their enemies would be the easier for them to pick them off in the narrow corridor.
“You’ll have to marry me first, mon capitaine,” Tony purred into Steve’s ear, curling into his lover’s side.
“Keep it together, Cap. Or we’re not going to be able to get your better half back,” Cable said, pushed Steve back from him to straighten him up.
They flew higher into the air and far from the scene below. After flying for several minutes, Steve let his muscles relax and fell back onto his seat, gasping, “That was close.”
Steve smiled. He tried to say yes but all that came out was a sigh. His eyes closed despite his fighting to keep them open.
Steve crossed the hall to Bruce’s lab to check on his friend. Bruce barely slept and ate as he worked tirelessly to find a solution. Steve had been taking care of both him, Tony, and Bucky the last few days and they were a needed distraction.
“Hell yeah, and a lot more are going to if we don’t get out of here now! I got Jarvis scrambling people’s cell phones right now but if we don’t book it now the entire country is going to be talking about the Independence Day version of a Christmas Carol in the next 5 minutes!”
Bucky’s lips twitched into a small smile and he whispered, “I remember you once telling me I fretted over Steve worse than Pepper fretted over you and I thought you were talking about a condiment.”
He wiped the corner of Wade's mouth to rid him of the spittle and Wade grinned at him for the action.
With all the continuous flashing lights and yelling, Steve’s sense of time was somewhat fractured so he couldn’t even begin to guess how long they were out there. In time, they reached the doors to the fundraiser, but even there they were instantly the center of attention as everyone seemed to be looking at them.
Steve pulled his hood down lower over his face and stalked toward the ambulance bay doors. He planned to stalk the area until an opportune victim appeared.
“Interviewing the Chameleon in a SHIELD interrogation room that smelt like stale cheese is not much of a mission nor very romantic,” Bucky retorted. He picked a slice of bacon off Steve’s plate and Steve elbowed his side.
With his eyes still closed, Peter reflected over the prior few days. Not only had Peter felt tired but he had been overly obsessive with Venom and had, at times, isolated himself. Venom had done that to him and Peter hadn’t even noticed…it was scary to think what would’ve happened if he was still in the symbiote’s power… If it wasn’t for Wade and what he felt for him, he may have completely secluded himself and have been lost to the alien.
“Peggy,” he countered, getting to his feet. “My son just won his first science fair award a few days ago. Before I’ll know it, he will start inventing, building the Iron Man suit, and then traveling through time. I need to make him an element for when he returns, an element that will save his life.”
The other two crossed the room and Peter said, “Wade says we’ve got another five or ten minutes until the shit hits the fan. So we’re going to give you guys some clothes and your gear.”
Steve and Tony went to their son first when they returned to the tower. This time they left him in the care of Clint so Steve was not too surprised when they found Peter testing out the miniature crossbow he made with a pen, some paper clips, and a rubber band.
“You’ll do great,” Tony promised, tearing Steve’s eyes away from the crowd. He grasped Steve’s cheek and kissed him with a happy hum. He pulled away and opened the door with a smirk. He whispered to Steve, “Please excuse my eccentric behavior for next ten minutes because I am going to show you off and gush.”
“Iron Man and Captain America were going to save Thor from that teddy bear,” Steve said, nodding to the bear lying on top of the Thor action figure a few feet away.
Peter leapt from the rubble and into his uncle’s arms. All the uneasiness he felt by being alone vanished as soon as he was in the safety of his uncle’s hold.
He went to the back of the restaurant and down the small hall to the bathroom and waited just beyond the doors. He only had to wait a few seconds before Steve followed him.
Tony had given him the code to his workshop once he and Peter started to spend time with him in there, long before they stared dating. Steve imputed the numbers, half afraid Tony may have changed the code, but it went through and the door slid open.
“Is that a yes?” Tony wrapped his hand around the head of Steve’s cock and lightly nipped at the base.
As they were readying to go, Tony asked, “So would you like to meet again tomorrow? We can bring you some coffee? Meet here again?”
Steve ignored his husband for the more pressing matter of saving their son. He tore away at the spot he assumed was Peter’s head. He was praying with all his soul that he could save him and praying that he would not be too late.
The LAPD complained about his flying again, but he gave them zero fucks and kept up his high rate of speed right up to his front door.
Steve wordlessly picked him up and Tony made no move to help himself into his arms. He kept his arms crossed over his chest, his frown in place, and his gaze pointed elsewhere.
Tony grinned and they went over to the promised couch. It was large and plush and Steve had fallen in love with it at the furniture store. It was one of the few items that did not come with the apartment. When Tony draped himself across it, Steve felt a strong primal pleasure grow at the sight of it.
“Tis like the mighty Hydra of old!” Thor thundered in, “The forces keep growing just as the beast kept growing its heads!”
Tony lifted Steve’s chin and Steve peered up at him with glassy eyes. God, he loved him so much. Why couldn’t -?
She looked into Peter’s eyes and saw none of the love he had openly displayed when she first saw him. He knew she was not his mother but it still hurt Mary all the same.
Tony looked down at his chest and saw that Steve had secured the bandages tightly without any light shining through. Tony patted down on the pure white bandages and then stood up. He moved around to make sure they’d stay on and then turned to Steve, saying, “Good job.”
Without any more encouragement needed, they hurried downstairs and lay Tony next to the broken shards of his old arc reactor’s display case.
“So breakfast should be fun,” Wade joked cheerfully, pressing his chest into Peter’s back and wrapping his arms around his front.
Steve ducked his head to hide his smile and pinched Tony’s arm back and replied, “I’d be doing the same…”
Steve pressed his face into Tony’s hair and inhaled his rich scent. He couldn’t believe he had ever denied this. He pressed a kiss into Tony’s scalp before answering, “Thank you.”
Natasha stepped past him and, before the Red Skull could reply, she decked him hard across his jaw. Tony jumped and bit back a yelp of surprise.
“You can't get rid of me that easily, Wade,” Peter lightly teased and carded his fingers with Wade’s to better squeeze his hand.
As if to prove his point, Thor grinned happily at him from the kitchen table with half of a purple Poptart sticking out of his mouth.
Conscious of the arms around him, Tony whispered, “Bucky…you probably don’t remember. You fell and then were captured by Hydra…” Tony gulped and then whispered, “I – I knew you were going to fall and – and did n-nothing.” Tony pressed his forehead onto Bucky’s shoulder and repeated, “I did nothing…”
Bucky leaned in, as Steve was internally distracted, and kissed the side of his neck. Steve stiffened with a sharp inhale and his entire body froze from his shock at Bucky's bold move. Bucky was undeterred and nibbled on the large vein in his neck. Steve bit back a groan from the sensation. All the old fantasies, buried long ago surfaced and Steve felt his resolve falter.
Tony swayed and leaned heavily into Steve and Steve was horrified to see the reactor in Tony’s chest flicker.
Bruce and Peter were the only Avengers at the Tower and had been trapped in Bruce’s lab the entire time, so they saw nothing. Clint had been training recruits at SHIELD HQ and Thor was with Jane on the other side of the country in New Mexico. The rest of the team left to check out the “Captain America” robbing the bank.
Marcel gave him a few words of advice and encouragement and then nodded him toward the courtroom. Steve regarded the sealed door warily and then strode forward, leading the lawyers into the court and the eventual turning point of his future.
Bucky rolled his jaw thoughtfully then groaned, “I will try to spar with her but there is no way in hell I am going to try to kiss her.”
Pops glanced uneasily at his husband and Dad shrugged. Dad said to him, “Pete sprung this on me with his therapist and Bruce was backing him up too. They all agree it is fine…I didn’t like it at first but he—he doesn’t just want this—he needs it.”
Peter lay down on top of Wade, cushioning his head on his arms just above Wade’s heart, and he asked, “What I was
Tony’s brows bunched together and he sighed, “Steve, you are…this is because…because of those laws, back then right? Before the big freeze? They’re not around anymore. You don’t have to worry-.” Tony reached for Steve’s hand but Steve knocked his hand back. He hit a little too hard and winced when he heard the metal of his suit crack from the impact.
Tony had been hinting Steve let the doctors look at him ever since they arrived at SHIELD medical. They got him as far as the bed in the medical unit before he started to refuse treatment. Treatment would mean Peter would have to leave his arms and that was the last thing that was going to happen.
“Got it,” Clint said, popping out the crushed remains of the bullet. “Alright, let’s see what we have here…” Clint held the crushed bullet up and said, “Right off the bat I can tell you this is an armor piercing round, long-range, and…” Clint dwindled to a stop and squinted at the bullet particularly. He looked to Steve with a troubled expression then looked to Natasha. Without him having to say a word, Natasha stepped through the holograms and took the bullet from his grasp. She examined the bullet with a frown.
“I don’t care,” Steve groaned. He could not even remember what Tony asked him. He growled, “Your mouth, on me, now.”
“The pictures are going to turn out great! The bags under our eyes are spectacular!” Tony stated, his voice heavy with sarcasm.
Steve reminded himself that everything would be alright once Peter and Venom were locked away in the Hulk Room. The medical team was onsite and would be able to help Peter if he needed it. But, most importantly, Venom could not escape the Hulk Room at full strength so this smaller one was no match. Peter was going to be freed again…he just wasn’t going to come out of it unscathed and he was definitely going to be in worse shape than last time…
Steve did not look away from the image on the screen and he interrupted Bruce, “This is the only way…you said so yourself. Peter is an innocent boy, he barely lived his life. I won’t let Venom take that away from him…”
Around them, the courthouse was becoming a madhouse but Tyler did not seem to notice and readjusted her hold on the glass. Blood dripped from her palm as the glass sliced into her own flesh. With renewed vigor, she growled, “I have done too much to lose you now.”
Peter only seemed to possess super strength and showed no other signs of mutation from the gamma-radiation. Bruce was beginning to lose interest and devoted more of his time to studying Peter’s biological samples than studying Peter himself. He went out with them less. Steve missed Bruce’s company, they had become close friends in the time he spent with them, but Steve cherished the additional alone time he had with Peter.
Wade grinned as his heart was instantly overfilled and flooded his entire body with sappy, hopeless love. Wade turned his head and cupped Peter’s cheek as he kissed him. Water ran down their faces and along their closed eyelids and into their open mouths. Peter turned around in his arms and pressed his chest into Wade’s as they tightened their arms around each other.
“We’ll go,” Steve announced, catching them all by surprise. Tony turned to his soulmate and Steve met his gaze with a nervous smile. He clarified, “We’ll go as a couple.”
“Just the capital,” Steve said with a small smile. Warmth blossomed in his chest as he stared at his son. He knelt between Peter and Ben and picked up the Captain America action figure. He asked Peter, “Did your superheroes save the world?”
Grinning slyly, he watched the unsuspecting family huddle together to check each other for wounds and then hit the device, activating it and sending him into
Eventually, Norman stepped back from the project and let the Hydra scientists have their fun but he always kept an eye on the boy and his progress. The boy was his greatest creation and, one day, he might be of use to Norman. But at his young age and the years it would take him to mature, Norman had no patience to babysit. He had enough to deal with, with Harry, especially after his wife died.
Why had Bucky shot that bullet into his living room? If he was not trying to kill him, what was he doing? Was he trying to send a message?
He pulled out his phone and Steve shook his head but complied as Tony settled Peter between them. Peter reached up to the phone and it took them a moment to find the perfect angle where they would mostly see his face instead of his grabby hands.
Steve went straight to the gym and his usual punching bag to pass the time until the President’s men arrived. Bucky accompanied him but made no motions to workout. He sat on the soft mats of the sparing area and watched Steve.
“…So,” Tony murmured, stepping closer to Steve so that their chests were touching again. He slid his hands over Steve’s chest and his eyes were focused on his throat. Tony continued, “After the fundraiser, I was wondering if you’d like to spend the night?”
But he couldn't…they only had a small window for their bath and then as only an infinitesimal amount of time left to them alone together before they headed out.
Before leaving to meet up with Tony, Bucky gave him a long and serious lecture on caution and how to protect the nature of their meeting from others.
“God, I love you,” Steve whispered into his mouth and, as he kissed him, Tony knew everything was going to be alright.
Steve squeezed Tony’s hand and murmured, “Hey Tony…” Tony looked to him and Steve leaned heavily into his side and continued, “This is your hourly reminder…”
“Crap.” The word escaped Tony before he could smother it. Steve shot him a dirty look and Tony shrugged sheepishly.
Clint glared out the window at the encampment of reporters growing at an alarming rate several dozen stories below. Even at the high level they were at, the mass of bodies below was large enough to be seen from their height. The archer stated, "I want to play target practice with those ants..."
They held each other tightly for an extended moment and then separated with sad smiles. His dad stood by the back door and then opened it for him.
He slipped back into camp without anyone noticing and joined the others in their gathering to greet the other team.
An indicator went off, notifying Tony that the transport ship had taken off. Steve would be with him in a few more minutes.
The screen blipped as all thrusters went to max and Tony’s attention snapped back to the screen. The past Tony was fighting the Sandman now, saving the past Steve from drowning in the sand. The fight was almost over.
Peter treated the whole experience like a game. He was playing at secret identity just like Steve or Tony did whenever they went out with him. Peter knew he could not use any of his powers or tell anyone who his father or adoptive father really was but he was already used to it.
He laid down on his bed and wrapped his arms around himself. He tried to pretend Gwen was by his side. He thought back to the last time she was in his bed, her light blonde locks were spread out over his pillow and across his arm, the smell of her lavender perfume overriding all other smells, her limbs tangled with his, her hot breathe mixed with his own, their naked bodies pressed to each other, the feeling of being one…and thinking that he was going to spend the rest of his life with her...
He assumed shrapnel again and his eyes were already heating up as he turned him over. He assumed the worst. There was no way Tony would be lucky enough to survive a second explosion. His heart wasn’t as strong, Tony told Steve so himself. However, after turning him over, he saw no blood or visible wounds…just a hole in the shirt where Tony’s reactor…
Eddie nodded. He knew he’d never live a normal life with Venom but he was not willing to go back to his pitiful life as boring, weak Eddie Brock.
Peter’s eyes snapped open and he stared unflinchingly at Steve’s chest. He did not move but looked at if he were waiting. Like he knew what was about to happen.
Tony gave Steve’s cock a squeeze and the super soldier’s body shuddered and a small whimper escaped his clenched lips. Tony's own cock throbbed at the sight. Steve's expression was so hot and Tony was so ready to throw his own cock into the mix but he withheld. He wanted to cherish his fiance just right. Tony gave Steve's shaft another squeeze and slowly drew his hand up. The warming lube felt hot and tingly in his grip, he could imagine how it felt on Steve’s dick. Tony purred, “Want me to stop?”
"When he finally does join the team officially, I can see both you and Tony fretting over him as much as Bucky has been doing for you for the last hour," Natasha teased.
His father was still silent which was a bad sign and Peter dared not to look at him to see how much this was destroying him.
Tony caught him alone in the hall after dinner and whispered, “Hey, uh, have you been checking the news sites?”
“The devouring one?” Steve mumbled against the back of Tony’s hand. He kissed his hand again, his tongue shooting out for one quick taste.
Tony was instantly enraged by the thought of Steve with someone else. He wanted to lash out at Steve for even thinking it but…Tony sighed. This is what he wanted and “casual” had its drawbacks and he knew from the beginning Steve was not a casual guy.
On a side note: OMG that Avenger's trailer!! Every new scene they release makes me want to see it more!! And then all the stony, omg so much! I'm so excited! I can't wait for it to come out!! <3
“Take Peter,” Steve hissed. He started to pull his son from his chest but Peter latched on tighter and screeched.
Tony blinked in confusion then suddenly grinned. He said, “Of course, Capsicle! You and the munchkin are welcome to stay! I have a floor waiting for you but we’ll just have to add some stuff for the mini Rogers!”
Bucky noted his presence first and must have said something to Steve because he turned around before Tony reached them. And that smile Steve greeted him with, damn, Tony nearly stopped in his tracks…
Tony picked up a bottle from out of the mussed sheets that had to be the lube he was always going on about. Tony challenged, “Why do you think I was tickling your sides? I wanted to wake you up.”
Steve and the Goblin were matched in strength but the beast was intelligent and used its wiles to trick Steve to gain the upper hand at some points in their fight. Yet Steve had experience in fighting, which the Goblin clearly did not and, most importantly, Steve was fighting on behalf of his son. The Goblin was insane and would not stop laughing or making the insertion that Peter was his son, not Steve’s.
“Oh, my god,” Tony gasped. He had been just teasing but Bucky was serious…and he seriously just sounded like his old self just now.
“What the fuck, Nat?! How else would you explain matching Barnes and resisting Thor!” Clint yelled. He straightened his broke nose with a grunt but did not go back to trying to get her off Bucky.
Steve tightened his arms around him and kissed his forehead again. They all should have done things differently... He didn’t want to linger on the hurt. He just wanted to simply…be.
Steve smiled warmly to where the couple had disappeared and whispered, “Then Bucky may find love in this era too…”
Steve ripped the syringe from Bucky’s grasp and stabbed it into Bucky’s neck. He pressed down on the stopper and the blue liquid disappeared into Bucky’s throat. Steve frantically prayed he didn’t just kill his best friend as the syringe emptied.
She held up her hand and said, “I’ve got this. Let me talk to him. He knows me even though he doesn’t remember it right now.”
“I need to have a solid timeline now,” Howard sighed. “I can’t help Tony if we are always on the move and in the field. I am limited here. I need access to a proper lab now and chemistry books. Otherwise, all I can do for him is let him sleep on my cot and that won’t fix the reactor.”
As he expected, Howard nearly had an aneurysm and screamed some more before demanding to see the time machine. Bucky volunteered to take him and Howard demanded more information on the robot. Bucky started to describe a robot Steve knew to not be Sneaky but from an Action Comic he and Bucky traded as children. Steve chuckled silently to himself at Howard’s expense.
“I’m still adjusting to the fact that I’m in this era,” Steve chuckled, gently drawing his fingers under Tony’s shirt.
Coulson slid in behind them and Peter recognized his Uncle Phil. He ran over to the Director of SHIELD to escape the loud Asgardians. Peter latched onto his leg and said, “Hi, Uncle Phil!”
Steve cut him off with a groan then kissed him again to shut him up. Tony fell blessedly silent and leaned into Steve's hold. Steve broke the deep kiss and pulled back to peer into Tony’s eyes. He whispered, “None of that matters now and you
He could accomplish so much with this. He even felt physically stronger wearing it. He wouldn't have to explain away cuts or bruise to Aunt May anymore either!
“I learned about your safe word in high school history class so Russian isn’t needed and did we already forget the genius card where Peter is concerned?” Tony retorted sarcastically and Steve took it as his cue to step in.
“Yeah, about that you freakin’ punk, I was supposed to be your best man! Thanks for waiting!” Bucky said, punching Steve in the arm.
“Hell yeah,” Tony replied and Steve laughed. He kissed Tony and Tony wrapped his arms around Steve’s back. He closed his eyes and ignored the salty dampness coming from Steve.
Tony had stupidly grown hopeful as soon as he found out there was a Winter Soldier in this timeline but now he was crushed and was reminded of how he missed Steve so much…
“The shield appears to be near the front of the building and going down st a fast pace. It is most likely in an elevator,” Jarvis supplied. Tony turned around and blasted through the doors the agents had just led him through.
Steve bit down on his lip, like he wanted to refuse and stay. So Bucky quickly added, “You’ll be useless to him if you’re dead on your feet. Go.”
He jumped out of the suit and straight into Steve’s arms. Steve caught him with a look of surprise and Tony gasped, “One last time.”
In the course of a few minutes, Tony had been hit by that hammer, hit by lightning, and nearly had his limbs crushed by the man’s superior strength but he kept throwing himself at him.
Tony snorted, glad he was not drinking any of the hot coffee just yet and glanced to Bucky for his reaction.
Steve sputtered an unintelligible excuse to deny him and a myriad of feelings assaulted him ranging from guilt to longing.
Tony bumped him with his hip and stated, “Give them time. They’re Russian, nothing comes easy to them. They like to toil for things, haven’t you read Tolstoy?”
Steve turned his head to the side, looking at the opposite wall instead of Tony. He could not let Tony see the conflicting emotions on his face. He was a genius. He would be able to clearly read what he was thinking.
The final chapter is here! Once again, thank you to all of you who have read this, left kudos, commented, bookmarked, or simply followed!
They entered the tent and Steve stood off to the side as Howard plowed forward and interrupted the Colonel in the middle of speaking with one of his subordinates. Phillips’ face soured as soon as his eyes landed on Howard and that sour look became more pinched as Howard began to talk.
“Government assholes,” Tony replied. “And, unfortunately, they’ll never leave us alone until we talk to them…Ugh, this will take forever…”
He was so pale and Wade pressed down on Peter’s wounds in an attempt to stop the blood. He turned to Wanda, about to yell at her to use her damn magic already when he saw…
“It was civil! Between you two that’s almost as if I threw Steve down on the table and ravished him in front of everyone!”
He landed in the backyard. The reporters saw him land but, thanks to the high fence, they were unable to see him as he strolled up to the back door. This will be the only time the Parkers may be thankful for having their neighbors living practically on top of them!
He wanted to be with Steve if this was the end…but it also meant Steve would return to the dreamworld with him and be in pain.
“Forget it, I got you,” Tony shot forward and swept the Captain off his feet and into the air. Rogers yelped and instantly wrapped his arms tightly around Tony’s neck. They flew straight into the sky, above the tallest of the skyscrapers in the matter of seconds.
Steve’s hand had remained on his shoulder to comfort him as he began to relay his story and he tightened his hold to reassure him of his presence.
Up close, Steve was more handsome. He had that sharp jaw you'd only see on the cover of romance novels paired with those perfect pink, kissable lips.
Tony blinked and then processed his words. He cleared his throat and then said, “Uh, yeah. Yeah, I’ll do that.”
“I don’t know when we’re going to die but I want to spend the rest of my life with you, whether it be just one more day or a lifetime. I love you, Steve…So will you marry me?”
From what he gleaned from the other soldiers, it was from the year 2009. Adding up the years, Howard, Steve, and the others would be really old men at that point, but it was possible they were still alive during Sneaky’s timeline.
Steve grinned and he slid into Tony’s arms. He kissed Iron Man’s face plate and murmured, “I missed you.”
Tony nodded and whispered, “It’ll probably be best if I hang with Panzer’s crew instead of the Commandos too.”
Of all the moments for them to capture, Tony would have never wanted them to post this, when Steve was at his most vulnerable. He scrolled down, seeing more photos from their private moment of them embracing and kissing.
Pepper just saw—Tony was –and Steve—! He’d never been so mortified in his life! He was so embarrassed and couldn’t look at Pepper.
They made love again and this time Wade topped. He moved slow and murmured endearments to Peter as the younger man figuratively unraveled beneath him with each shallow thrust.
Wade quirked an eyebrow at him and put his hands over Peter’s on his waist to better push into him. Peter was mesmerized by the way Wade’s ab muscles moved and how his panties moved, revealing a little more skin every time he was pressed into Peter. A flush burnished his cheeks as his imagination ran wild and Peter wondered what Wade would have looked like with no clothes on and rocking like this on his cock. Peter licked his lips, suddenly feeling his mouth go dry.
Yet, the fact that he could not help his friends fight, was what finally crushed his spirit. It was frustrating, it was disheartening…but mostly, it made him feel useless.
But his Boy Scout was taking everything out of the car so Tony came up behind him, ran his hands suggestively down Steve’s waist, and murmured, “Leave it.”
Steve raised his hand to cup the side of Tony’s face but paused when his hand raised as high as Tony’s elbow.
, are you the ‘intricate matters’ Tony said he was working on? It all makes so much sense… And…You’ve been here all this time? For the last couple of weeks?”
Solo glanced at the building almost lazily. It was one of his good days so Steve knew he’d get a straight answer as he replied, “The one and only. You’ll see Iron Man fly into it every once and awhile. Tourists love it.”
Wade stared lovingly into those hazel eyes and ran his fingers through his soft hair. He stated with complete conviction and all the love he could muster, “I have never been more sure of something in my entire life…”
Happy drove him in one of his boring cars with tinted windows. The press outside didn’t even give it a passing glance.
His aunt’s eyes slowly ran over the photos of his father and then she gradually sat down on the recliner Tony Stark sat in hours prior.
Peter went to catch himself but was caught instead by Iron Man. Peter slumped into the suit’s metal arms with a groan.
Cable spun around and his face hardened when he saw Steve was holding the photo. He stomped down the few stairs between them and then snatched the photo out of his hands. His expression became mostly unreadable except his frown deepened as he took in the photo…if one could call it that now…
Steve didn’t let himself think as he kissed Tony. He already told himself he would no longer deny what he wanted and he did not…at least, not physically…but emotionally…
“I think you need some help, buddy,” Steve retorted, his eyes flickering around the room, counting bodies, weapons, and possible exits.
Tony would, of course, tell him about his everyday life too. It wasn’t all sex and sweet endearments.
! You're not a fuck up! You are the smartest person I have ever met and that's including your father!...You're just purely amazing! I – I know it feels like the end of the world right now but you'll get through this. All the pressures from losing your parents to taking on your father’s responsibilities with the company, they'll lessen overtime as you get stronger.”
“We’ll go down to the tourist level of the Tower first,” Eddie murmured, his thoughts still with the experiment. “It’s the weekend so it should be plenty busy and we can monitor Venom with the crowd. Though… we need to get you some kind of disguise because as soon as people find out you’re Peter Parker they’ll be swarming all ov-…”
Tony was falling for his friend and he didn’t even realize it…but Steve couldn’t look at him or abide his touch.
“I have confirmation,” Dr. Calvin stated from across the room. “The firewalls are back up. We no longer have to play this damn charade.”
“The game,” Steve stated, nodding to the radio and the most obvious clue of them all. “It’s from May 1941 – I know, ‘cause I was there.”
Eddie carefully poured the contents of a thin test tube into a burette (an elongated measuring tube). Once he emptied the test tube he stopped pouring and released an unsteady breath. He put one of their larger beakers beneath it. The burette contained the base to their solution and would connect everything in the beaker together. Without it, everything would be a useless mass similar to kinetic sand. It’d barely stick together and wouldn’t even have the ability to react nonetheless do what they wanted.
“No killing,” Steve attempted to joke, though they could all tell there was no humor behind it. Even now he was trying to be strong for them when it was them who should be helping him through this…
Uncle Bucky also looked disturbed by the silence but he running until Aunt Tasha stated something grimly in Russian. She did not use English, knowing Peter might overhear, but Peter could clearly make out Pops’ name in her message. Uncle Bucky collapsed upon her message and they skid several feet across the linoleum floor.
Tony kept touching him, as if to reassure himself Steve was still there but his hands avoided the dark patches on his skin. The patches were unnerving. Steve could clearly see them but he could feel anything on his skin until he touched it with his fingertips. Under his fingers it felt like the same warm, rubbery substance he had tried to tear off Peter.
Tony nodded and then placed a light kiss on Steve’s lips, a tiny reminder that he was there for him. Steve grasped his hand tightly, a smidge too tight, but Tony did not bring it up. He simply squeezed Steve’s hand tightly in return.
Without any warning, he plunged his metal fingers into the flesh of his right arm and ripped out his implant.
Steve pressed his hips into Tony’s, imitating sex, and Tony rose up to meet him. Tony’s hands found their way under Steve’s shirt like they usually did whenever they made out. This time, however, Steve paused in kissing him to take off his shirt.
“Sir –,” Jarvis began to warn but Tony ignored him in favor of walking up to the unarmed man. His suit’s tread was loud in the garage and made him feel more imposing as he stepped in front of the intruder.
Tony couldn’t help but smile as Steve held him close and then dipped him. Steve cupped his jaw and then bent down to kiss him like a dame from on old movie. You could take the man out of the 1940s but you couldn't fully take the 1940s out of the man.
Steve smiled at him as a happy warmth bubbled in his chest and he tilted his head to lightly kiss Tony’s palm. He continued his kisses down his arm and Tony wrapped his arms behind Steve’s head, drawing Steve’s kisses quicker down Tony’s arm, across his chest, up his neck and finally settled on his lips.
His heart palpitated as he remembered the months Tony had spent thinking Steve was dead when he first returned from the past. But he never saw Steve’s fall nor did he hear his final words before the plane crashed…Steve saw Tony die and Tony knew it must’ve been so much more traumatizing.
That being said, I just got accepted into an internship and I start next week. It's going to make my life super busy so the last chapters will take a little longer to get out! SORRY! DX
Steve was quick to follow and they walked out into the night side-by-side. Tony pinched his arm and murmured, “I’d be holding your hand right now, if it wouldn’t get you in trouble.”
Wade’s fingers tightened slightly into Peter’s flesh and he returned the kiss with a tiny, needy noise. His kiss was everything Peter remembered it to be. Peter felt all of Wade’s love and concern pour over into their linked lips. Wade’s lips were tender when pressing into his and his tongue gentle when caressing just the inside of his lips, like going any deeper might hurt Peter further…but he didn’t stop kissing him. He peppered kisses over his mouth like every kiss was stolen and precious and then he began to whisper, “I love you – I love you so much, Peter – I love you, Peter –
Peter bit down on his lip and stretched his arms above him, hooking his hands behind Wade’s neck. He moved his body suggestively against Wade’s and Wade’s eyes popped open as their hips rubbed together. Peter’s erection touched Wade’s and Peter groaned, biting harder on his lip from the sensation.
He got a text from Peter and he laughed as he read, ‘You’re a sap and now everyone knows it but ily2.’
Bucky lifted his head and stared beadily at Peter just as Steve reached his side. Behind him, he could hear Tony scrambling off the boxing ring.
The Captain did not acknowledge his presence when he entered the cold room and Coulson did not let the hurt show. In a few seconds, the thousands of happy scenarios he imagined wilted away and all that was left was the stark reality. This was going to not be a joyous meeting.
He looked to his soulmate and saw Bucky had bent Tony’s arm back at an odd angle. He only released him once Steve looked at him.
Stark directed his repulsors at Norman and blasted him with both hands, burning his armored skin. Norman stumbled back and as he got his feet under him he dumbly watched Stark fly to Venom.
He cursed under his breath when he saw it was still blank. He was sure that making Stark believe they were SHIELD agents and that his savior had died would right everything. What else did they need to do to set Stark back on his path to travel to the past and meet his future husband for what he thought was the first time?
She left him promising to visit more and then Howard was alone again with his notebook. Memories spurned him to turn back the pages and look at his old notes. He came across a drawing Tony had managed to draw next to his sketch of the Hydra base and smiled sadly at the image. It was a pencil drawing of Captain America's spangled shield. Howard still remembered walking into his office and nearly having a heart attack when he saw the young child treating such a precious object like a coloring book.
Hulk roared and leapt to Loki but as soon as he moved Loki disappeared. Hulk landed on the railing instead of the trickster god. The railing crumpled underneath his weight and Hulk had to slam his thick fingers into the concrete floor to keep from falling over the side. He pulled himself up then circled the area where Loki stood and muttered dangerously, “Where Puny God go? Hulk smash Puny God.”
Ben’s face crumpled sympathetically and he whispered, “I understand.” He held out his arms and said, “Give me Peter. I will feed him while you pack.”
The orange clad people came running toward him yelling out to him in a foreign language that his frozen brain could not pinpoint.
Tony wouldn’t have been able to tell how much time had passed if it weren’t for the all the technology around them. They never dressed and when they were awake it was spent either eating or fucking…or both.
Steve rounded the counter in a few steps. He embraced Tony tightly and gasped, “Thank you!” He buried his face into his shoulder to hide the relieved tears that instantly sprang to his eyes. He gasped again, “Th-Thank you!”
Tony smiled gratefully at him and cupped Peter’s cheek briefly before getting up and leaving to get the doctor.
Peter was beginning to shake as his locked up emotions began to swiftly escape and overcome him. Peter locked eyes with Pops. It felt like he was still in some kind of fantasy.
Tony grinned and began to slowly unbutton Steve’s shirt from the bottom up. Steve’s breathing picked up, Tony’s gaze never broke away from his as his fingers opened his shirt. Steve felt like he burned under his eyes.
Steve spotted a glint on the roof of a distant laundry mat. Could it be a sniper’s scope? Could it be Bucky?
Sam lay a comforting arm across his back and Stevel leaned into him, vainly wishing he was Bucky or Tony instead.
“He should be dead,” the doctor reasoned with a shrug. “Any normal human would have died from such injuries.”
Wanda nodded and stepped forward. Vision went to follow but Wade grabbed the corner of his cape and whispered, “Take me with you.”
Once they had their fill, they slipped into the sewers before the SHIELD agents found them again, leaving behind a bloody mess.
In his pacing, he kept an eye on the digital clock on his wall. When it turned to midnight, Tony snapped, “Alright! We have to go after him!”
Tony shakily got to his feet, rubbing furiously at his face, and then sprinted to Steve. He ran into him at full force and buried his face into Steve’s stomach. Steve wrapped his arms around the little boy and finally let his eyes glisten.
Steve flushed but grinned at Tony and stepped up to him, murmuring, “You’re not so bad looking yourself.”
Tony broke their locked gazes and rubbed his forehead. He sighed, “It’s…nothing. Can…Can you help me wrap up my chest so the reactor doesn’t show? I need to get out of this tent…”
Coulson’s usually passive demeanor slipped and he grinned widely as he replied, “It’s no problem, Cap.”
“That’s love Petey,” Steve explained. “That’s what you’re feeling and you don’t have to be father and son to love someone. Your Uncle Ben loves you and I bet you love him too,” Steve said with a knowing smirk to his son. Peter grinned in agreement and Steve explained, “Uncle Bucky is here because he loves me and…I love him…
“Why didn’t you warn us? I’d already changed the future by involving your father,” Steve implored, his voice begging. “Even just a forewarning that something might happen…”
He said the name like it truly was his own. Later, Tony would reveal to Steve that Edward was his middle name and he merely omitted mentioning his last name when telling Peggy his name.
Logan took another drag from the cigar and continued, “Disasters…like humans, also have similar smells. I have smelt famine many times and it away has the same acidic scent. I’ve never encountered anything like your new suit before, but, it smells like famine.”
“That’s pretty hard to fricken ignore, Steve,” Tony grumbled, still refusing to look at him. “We can’t do this if you – if you…”
Ben nodded and his gaze fell back on the photo. He whispered, “Richard and Mary talked about having children. They wanted two, a boy and a girl. I’m glad Mary was able to bring a boy into this world… Even though you are not the father she expected for her son, I know you will raise him right.”
Tony collapsed into Steve’s arms and stared stupidly in love up at him. Steve’s annoyed expression melted off from the warmth of his loving gaze. Steve sighed and wrapped his arms around Tony. He mumbled, “Please don’t announce to the press of all people whenever we are going to have sex.”
The lights on stage were too bright to see out into the crowd but he knew his son and close friends were mixed into the crowd, waiting to see his eccentric wedding.
Natasha and Coulson exchanged glances and then Coulson said, “We’re going to need to use your building, Stark. It seems HQ has been infested.”
What would it be like to sleep with him? He bet he was a cuddler. If Tony slept over, he wondered if he'd wake with Steve's arms around him.
Abruptly, Tony fell back with his father’s words and landed roughly in a stiff seat. In front of him were plane controls for an older plane and a beautiful blue sky. He relaxed. Flying a plane was a better experience than dealing all his bottled-up childhood regrets.
Phillips and the rest of the Commandos had already made their way to the new camp. Steve cursed up a storm when he realized Gabe went with them. He was probably helping set up the medical tents at that very moment.
The next two chapters are going to be an Epilogue of their lives, going through the important moments all the way up to the moment in the future when the Sinister Six try to kill Peter. Full circle!
Peter cringed when he took a closer look at it. Before that moment, he hadn't seen the Facebook invitation his father and Pepper had created. There was the general info for the party (when, where, etc) but there was a gif of the Tower with a tiny Iron Man flying around holding a cake.
They went into a quiet neighborhood that was in ruins. Tony’s eyes scanned the perimeter until he saw a decent structure that would hide them from any prying eyes.
!” Tony flinched at his own words then snapped back and looked down as he hissed under his breath, “Goddamnit…”
Peter pretended he didn’t notice Wade’s interest and stood up to reach over the bar as the bartender held out the drink to him. Dennis went to the other side of the bar and Peter sat back down. Wade tipped his head to the side, watching Peter’s physic as he stood.
Steve followed him, intending to get fully dressed himself. He changed into sturdy clothes, expecting another day of hard work. Tony dressed into the lightweight clothing he usually wore under the Iron Man armor, expecting much of the same.
He grabbed one of Peter’s hands and had him grasp his dick, together they stroked Wade’s dick and he began to move his hips. Peter hissed in surprise but he caught his breath and began to move with him.
, Tony,” Steve gasped as the man beneath him tugged on his nipples, making his cock throb from the sensation. Steve lightly rutted against the time traveler in retribution, making Tony chuckle.
Steve rubbed at his eyes one last time with a sad smile and returned to his jog before Tony could protest or ask for more answers.
“Ice cweam!” Peter gasped, squirming in his hold. Steve broke out of his stupor and adjusted his hold on Peter before the toddler managed to slip from his hold.
Tony’s eyes then took in the drawing his father had made on the same page and he settled back into his chair as he read his father’s excited notes on the captured Hydra base.
The world moved on and, now that everyone knew Tony was Iron Man, they were all clamoring for a piece of his suit, the U.S. Military specifically.
Tony glanced down and huffed, “Huh. I thought it was getting a little wet in there.” Looking back at Steve, Tony explained, “I just got clipped by a bullet.”
Wade shrugged and said, “I know what I look like. I usually hide behind a mask but bartenders tend to not trust people in masks…If Stark wasn’t giving out free booze, I wouldn’t have come in my Sunday best.”
It was so intense that the dream wavered around them and then Tony started to move and Steve could only hold on as his orgasm began to build again. He wrapped his arms and legs around his lover and prayed the night would never end.
As they passed over the threshold, Peter turned away with a pained noise and gasped more to himself, “I’m such an idiot.”
Natasha opened the first door and turned to Bruce, saying, “Follow my lead and, if you feel an inkling of the Hulk, let me know.”
Tony instantly frowned and looked down at his food. A strong combination of hurt and want warred within him. Why did Steve come here now? He didn’t want to deal with him or with what their relationship constituted as now.
Bucky looked sick and he looked questionably to Steve. Steve smiled sympathetically at Bucky and said, “Don’t leave a pretty dame hanging, Buck.”
Peter met Steve outside his bedroom and they went through his closet together as quietly as possible. Peter's dad was snoring loudly from the bed and Steve whispered in explanation, “I turned off his alarm so he could get as much sleep as possible. He stayed up late last night getting together last-minute things for your birthday.”
Natasha pressed her forehead to his and stared into his eyes. He stared back, entranced by her light green eyes. He could drown in those pools of algae for days.
“Iron Man, Iron Man, Iron Man,” Solo muttered darkly. “His technology is too advanced. It’s alien. He’s one of them,” Solo grumbled.
“I think…I think you should do what you want to do,” Wade stated carefully. “You can stay here with me or you can go back to the Tower…or you can go ride the Ferris wheel at Coney Island.”
He understood why Pepper and the rest of the media relations team would want to keep it under wraps that Peter was born from an affair with a married woman…it would put them in a bad light.
For a long time, the Soldier stood there with his gun pressed to Steve’s temple. Tony did not move, fearing such a movement would provoke him into shooting.
The scientist and cyborg left Tony’s lab as Bruce began to tell her about the chemical make-up he found in the samples.
But first, Steve had to defeat the Red Skull, change the tide of the war, and thereby save Tony’s life.
As soon as Peter left, Tony had Friday pull up the building’s security footage and watched his son make his way to the research labs, several floors below.
It was extremely surreal and definitely something out of one of his greatest fantasies.  He never thought it possible to find someone who knew nothing about his past and perceived him differently because of it.
The correction’s officer had explained to him that this was not jury trial, this was simply his initial appearance. A judge was going to decide if he was going to be allowed to post bail or remain in jail until trial.
Tony drew back his hand and Steve cautiously looked at him to see how he reacted. For a few seconds, he saw the forlorn expression he had been expecting but Tony quickly masked it behind one of indifference.
“Good idea,” Peter replied in an equally hushed tone. Peter picked out a “Run NY” shirt with an Art Deco image of the Statue of Liberty jogging in running shorts in addition to some blue jeans with an accompanying belt.
Bucky hated seeing his best friend frown like that and commanded, “Don’t think like that. He’s doing great. The others still think he’s being overdramatic about his injury and he’s still able to help Panzer. He’s strong, Steve. He’s got this.”
Wade held out his hand and Eddie shook it. Eddie dropped his gaze with a flush when he realized he’d been caught staring. Looking at Wade’s tie, he said, “Nice to meet you.”
“You’re free,” Steve reminded him. “You are your own person. You don’t have to do missions anymore. You can live your life now!”
Steve knelt beside him and gasped, “What happened??” Looking at the battery, Steve gasped, “What are they doing to you??”
Tony stepped into the connecting bathroom and closed the door behind him. He paused as he reassessed his actions and then stated, “Friday, keep tabs on Peter. Track him through his communicator and listen in. If he needs help,
He could still hear Dad’s sobs through the sealed door. The depth of his pain was so great that his cries sounded inhuman and it made Peter want to cry with him.
Steve nodded stiffly and slid the rest of the way into bed. He wrapped his arms around Tony and pulled him tightly into his embrace. Steve pressed his face into Tony’s shoulder and gasped, “Don’t die.”
Tony’s back was aching from where he had landed on his 1967 Shelby Cobra. The car was completely destroyed along with the floor above and his roof where he had attempted to land. But it was barely a blip on his radar right now because his suit could
Tony stayed in his embrace for a long time before he wordlessly slipped away and went back to work. Steve watched him with an unhappy frown.
Wade scrambled to his feet and stumbled toward the pink cloud. He kept his eyes locked on his boyfriend with his barely healed heart hammering so hard it was going to pop a blood vessel, and gasped, “I-Is he okay!? Did you stop it??”
“You-You’re asking me to change myself! You’re asking me to destroy another aspect of me from my era!
“PEPPER!” Tony bound into the room. Tony probably just reached the basement when Jarvis informed him of Ms. Potts’ arrival. He must turned right around and came straight back. Tony exclaimed, “
Steve’s mind was a little foggy as he woke. At first, he didn’t really remember the events before he fell unconscious. He only really registered that he was in a bed. It was as comfortable as the one in the Hydra base so Steve just assumed he was there which made him turn over and reach for Tony.
Logan exhaled a large cloud of smoke and tapped his leg a few times before reaching into his pocket and pulling out his phone.
“I’m going to guess it may have to do with the crack?” Steve guess, holding up the shield with a smirk.
The investor was a stoic Asian woman that answered to May and was a part of a government organization called SHIELD. Steve learned from the ship’s crew that SHIELD planned a big search of the Arctic. For what, they could only guess as the organization was very tightlipped about it. The popular rumor on the ship was that it was a search for an alien spaceship.
Peter moved back out into the fair and kept an eye out for his friends but could not find any of the other interns. He strolled over a less noisy corner that was sectioned off as a bar and waved to the bartender, hoping he looked old enough for him to give him a chance. He was twenty-one, going on twenty-two, but bartenders always seemed to think he was sixteen.
Bruce’s easy smile dropped and he picked his glasses off his nose to rub the lenses with the edge of his shirt. He murmured, “He went straight to his workshop and has not left since last night. I saw him before he went in. He did not look good…”
Steve didn't and chuckled as Howard left the room. Smirking, he turned back to Tony and asked, “This must be extremely bizarre to you.”
“Fury called earlier…he asked if I wanted to help out at the Veterans hospital. Apparently, they were in bad shape before the attack and now they’re overwhelmed with soldiers and civilians…not much attention is being brought to it and, well, there’s a representative from the VA coming here to help me help them…”
Tony turned to him with a big grin and asked, “How is it? Not too big but not small at all! Good, right?”
“Howard!?” Bucky exclaimed loudly, drawing the eyes of several soldiers. They kept walking and those eyes individually filtered away. He leaned in closer to Steve and said in a lower, accusing voice, “Why are you gonna see him at a time like this??”
Coulson grinned and looked at the antique poster on the wall. He smiled at the visage of the Captain and replied, “Thank you, son. I’ll see you in an hour.”
The message ended and Steve immediately checked to see when he called. He nearly dropped the phone when he saw it. He called late last night, Steve was probably asleep but he had called.
Fury rolled his eye and shook his head, but he was smiling. Tony usually would’ve jumped on him and teased him about showing the positive emotion…if Steve wasn’t there, alive, awake, and going nowhere.
Natasha laughed and it was a wondrous sound. She pinched his chin and slipped out of his hold. She asked, “So Stepan but not Stepan? I can work with that.”
, the Secretary of Defense, some high school valedictorian in Ohio city, Bruce Banner, Steven Strange, just anyone who’s a threat to Hydra! Now or in the future.”
“She does not hate you,” Steve corrected. “She told me herself that she was hurt and angry but she never used the words hate…”
Both Steve and Tony pulled him into their arms simultaneously and knocked the air out of his chest. He instantly felt warm in his parents' embrace. They worriedly looked him over and Peter did the same of him.
Peter shifted his legs to bring himself closer to Wade but he knocked over the tablet as he did and it began to slide off the bed. With quicker reflexes that Wade could only dream to achieve, Peter broke their kiss and caught the fragile device before it would shatter on the hardwood of the floor.
He tried with all of his diminished strength to break free or escape the power of the machine but it was all for not.
They quickly fell into a routine. At first, they were careful around each other, shy and asking permission before being intimate but, as the days passed, questions became meaningless and there was no reason to be shy. Tony unofficially moved in and slept in his bed every night. Their lives quickly became ingrained into one and every hour was spent in each other's presence. The kisses they shared in passing or in passion were no longer surprises but now were as normal and vital as breathing.
Tony cleared his throat and adopted a very serious expression as he grasped one hand and placed another on Steve's waist. Steve did the same, though his serious expression was over-exaggerated and it looked like he was smothering another laugh behind his twitching lips.
Steve rolled his eyes and looked away from Tony so he could focus on emptying his bladder. It was harder to do with an audience and, after a few seconds, he blushed and asked, “Can you please look away?”
“You have no control of that,” Tony hissed, sitting beside Steve on the bed. He cupped Steve’s cheek and whispered, “I looked into it and no one in recorded history has ever experienced what we have. We don’t know why you were able to stay in my dreams but maybe…maybe our luck is running out…”
Tony was stunned by their entire interaction. That woman was barely there a week and she already had the infamous Winter Soldier whipped.
Steve leaned the broom against the wall and went over to Tony. He kissed those smiling lips and then whispered, “Good morning, Sleeping Beauty.”
Steve smirked as his gaze flicker over the room. The symbol of Hydra had been carved into the walls but some of the soldiers had found some paint and drew over them, adding things like mustaches or thick glasses. Steve joked, "Some of these guys aspire to be interior decorators."
It was horrible…Steve never had any trouble talking to Tony before now. It was like what happened with Bucky had created a buffer between them.
Steve took it all outside and sat at one of the tables in front of the deli. He leaned back and studied the rooftops, wondering when Bucky would appear. The streets were busy as commuters walked past to get to the nearby subway platform or to explore the local shops.
“Alright, Americans go do what you do best,” Tony said as he landed. “Hydra, I need one of you who speaks English and can tell me how I got here.”
The microscopic bots finished building the armor and similar screens appeared before him. He flexed his hands and murmured, “This is amazing.”
Natasha ran up to his side and knelt beside him. She grasped his arm and excitedly asked, “What about Stephanos? Or Stas? Or Stanimir? Or-?”
Jarvis had already moved the elevator to Steve’s floor and the metal doors were waiting and open for them.
He looked like he was falling back asleep so Wade nudged him and murmured, “Don't go back to sleep, baby boy. Weren't we supposed to meet your parents for breakfast.”
Steve dropped his head and murmured, “...How did my fate become so twisted from being happy with you?”
“What is it?” Steve asked unable to take not knowing anymore. Tony’s face went white and Bucky and Natasha laughed. Steve was instantly confused. Wasn’t Tony’s health at risk? Why were they laughing?
Tony’s eyes narrowed and he said, “Didn’t Steve tell you? He said he brought it up. He and I are in a…relationship.”
But, with Bucky, that brave façade disappeared and a weariness slumped his shoulders like a heavy burden. Alone, he poured out all his worries to Bucky about his former lover.
He didn't know how his parents did it…the only ones who knew Steve and Tony had been dating was the team, Coulson, Pepper, Happy, and eventually Peter and Aunt May.
Tony smirked in anticipation and placed hand over Steve’s heart. He slowly circled Steve and ran his hand along Steve’s body. Steve stood still as Tony whispered, “I never learned any traditional dance moves. There’s no boy or girl position. It’s just like sex, we work together, and your “dancing position” is to either take pleasure, give pleasure, or do both.” Steve’s eyes widened almost comically and, beneath his hand, he felt Steve tremble. Tony huskily whispered, “Everything I learned was from dark and dirty clubs where you couldn’t see your dance partner…” Tony’s hand ran over Stave’s ass and he cupped it similarly as he did when they made love. Steve inhaled sharply and Tony added, “And you knew your dance partner only by touch.”
“You are a part of the Avengers, a team of individuals sworn to protect the world from outside threat,” Jarvis stated. "Your parents' donated their mansion in upstate New York to be the team's headquarters."
“Never say never,” Tony retorted. He pushed himself from his spot and rounded the counter to Steve’s side. He pulled Steve away from the counter and into his arms. Tony explained, “Nothing is boring with Tony Stark and dancing is relatively easy if you have the right partner. Jarvis, music!”
What would Tony do if he pushed him against the wall right now with no one there to see them? Steve gulped as he was tempted by the idea.
With hours until the party, and his parents busy, he and Wade had time to themselves. Peter enjoyed it. He finally gave Wade a tour of the place and, when they came across his dad’s gaming system, they just had to play a few games.
In the end, everyone was crying and mourning the loss of something great from their lives. Tony knew Steve would have been just as moved by the ceremony had he been there…
,” Tony stated. It felt great to get the truth out and to no longer be jumping around it. But, at the same time, he never felt more scared by it. How would his son react?
“We have to get up, soldier,” Steve said with a chuckle and lightly ran his hands gently over his back to try to wake him up.
the chance, Stark, and I’m only doing this because you warned us about Hydra. Consider you and SHIELD even now, alright?”
Tony lightly ran his fingers down the hem of Steve’s robe until he reached the belt where it was knotted. Steve heart raced inexplicitly faster from Tony’s caress. Tony grasped the knot and pulled Steve toward him with a light jerk.
The other two were looking around them nervously, obviously scared someone had overheard the AI, but Tony...Tony was thrown off.
He willed and prayed for his body to heal faster. Fear flowed through his blood like icy cold. Tony did not have a suit. How was he faring against Kilian?
He didn’t see if Steve got to his shield. Every moment used could count for life or death so he opened the panel and his systems took over. He’d made the panel in case of an attack like this one and it was on a separate energy system and not connected to Jarvis so it still worked.
It must have shown because Howard sighed heavily and grumbled, “You’re hurting right now and I am sorry for you. I too am grieving for Barnes but I know it’s nowhere near the extent you are…but, I’m right, aren’t I?”
Steve flushed and said, “Jumping right into bed doesn’t sound like a good beginning to a ‘stable relationship’…”
“Damn, Cap wasn’t kidding when he said you were his soulmate,” Fury said from the top of the stair, walking in like he owned the place.
