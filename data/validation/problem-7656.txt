“Hey hey hey, not so loud.” Tony hurried from down the hall to kiss Steve hello, hushing him as he went. “Not so loud, not tonight. I’m happy to see you, but come on, I have a surprise for you.”
“Damn you Clint, I need tips tonight!” Tony called in the background. “Don't turn down a reservation!”
He and Pepper had broken up. They loved each other, but it just wasn't working out for them. Tony couldn't be a burden to Pepper anymore, she deserved someone way better then him.
Suddenly, a car drove at high speed and stopped right in front of them. Pepper and Tony got startled, they both gaped at the car, as the person parked it there and got out of the car. "I could hear you guys laughing from the other side of the car park." The man stated, while walking toward them.
"My instincts are telling me that we'll meet very soon. So, wait for me, Boo."
Steve covered him with a blanket and made sure he was comfortable. Next thing he knew, he kissed the man on the forehead and softly whispered "Goodnight, Boo."
The guy sighed in defeat. "That's the whole reason why I even put up with you, Tony."
Tony's eyes widened, "H-How the fuck did you know?"
He saw a familiar figure slowly swimming toward him. He couldn’t see the figure properly, but he knew this scent. It was definitely Tony's. As the figure came closer, he knew for sure it was Tony.
Pepper buried her face into his shoulder as tears rolled down her cheeks into his shoulder. She wrapped her arms around him even tight, like her life depended on it.
Steve fucked him like there was no tomorrow, he was speeding up with each thrust.
Steve held his mum's hand and reassured her that he was okay. Steve hated making his mum worry about him. "I really appreciate it mum, but I promise you, I'm alright."
“Wait.” the Omega’s heart did something flip floppy, but he tried to ignore it so he could needle, “You want me to mess up in my parenting? Honestly, how dare you?”
to, but I’m not gonna. Tony’s got rules and I need to respect them. This is only the third date and asking him to bend his rules or make exceptions would make me look--”

was a minimum of a year old. Some of Tony’s clothes were from right after he’d had Peter and before he’d lost what little baby weight he’d managed to put on during the stressful pregnancy, which made those pieces almost three years old and at least two sizes too big.
“S--so full.” the Omega stammered, digging his nails into Steve’s chest and rocking on him again,
today decided I deserved to be treated as less than human and that’s--that’s not the sort of thing a cup of tea can fix.”
clothes. Tiny t shirts and sort of adorable pants, the smallest little hoodie Bucky had ever seen and a winter coat at least a size bigger than everything else. Piles of bittie socks and feetie jammies, and baby blankets with elephants and space ships and puppies. A sparse and obviously second hand, but still well taken care of assortment of toys all meant to be learning tools and pushed up against the other wall next to all that was a crib.
Peggy was far too old fashioned and polite an Alpha to ask an Omega about sex, even one she loved as much as Tony, so she waited patiently for him to continue and after a long moment, Tony admitted--
“Did-- did you just--” The Omega glanced behind Steve towards the manager. “Did you just
The morning of May 30th, Bucky found himself down by the 1 Hotel Brooklyn Bridge purely because the hot dog stand at the corner served the best bratwurst in the city. The sausages were long enough to make a less confident Alpha self conscious, they came smothered in sauerkraut and served on some honestly fuckin’ delicious buns and were

this.” Steve couldn’t bring himself to lift his nose from the Omega’s skin, but he let go of Tony’s hands so he could feel over the lace top and slip under the delicate material to sweep his thumb at bare skin, fitting his hands to the dip of Tony’s stomach. “I
about you!”
“C’mere.” It took nothing at all for Steve to lift Tony, holding the Omega steady with one arm and using his other arm to direct Tony’s legs around his waist. “Can I take you to bed?”
“Okay.” Tony pinched the bridge of his nose as he felt an outrageous migraine pending. The audacity of the customers wasn’t anything compared to the audacity of his friend suggesting-- suggesting
“You let my gal hold your boy?” Bucky’s eyes went very soft, something Tony didn’t quite understand making the Alpha almost melancholy. “Did she cry?”
Steve’s throat moved as he swallowed and the Omega’s scent blossomed in adoration when the blond couldn’t even find words for a few seconds as he felt carefully, tenderly along the fragile threads.
…the door swung open to a bedroom filled with candles and rose petals, to Tony already lying reclined on the bed with his hair rumpled and eyes sultry soft and Steve didn’t know what he had been expected his boyfriend to be in– maybe the dress again, maybe a sexy pair of boxers or that one silky robe Tony wore when he was feeling dramatic.
a brand new bed and plan a party and plan what was starting to feel like a future while holding onto Pete’s favorite stuffed animal and letting chocolate chip pancakes cool on the griddle.
The second the words were out of his mouth, Tony winced. Nothing like bringing up the sugar baby arrangement while they were trying to sexy to kill the mood. “Uh, what I mean--”
When Tony got home, the house was quiet. The kitchen was dark and only one lamp on in the living room and when he went up to the bedrooms, both Steve and Peter were nowhere to be found.
“Anything you want.” the blond promised softly. He took the stairs two at a time to get Tony to bed as soon as possible and kept all but one light off as he lay the Omega down in the pillows. “I’ll be right back.”
for the brief second he’d seen it before Nat put it away. “Well, I would need a ride back and forth? I live way out on the other side of town and I use Tony’s Uber account to get to work but wouldn’t feel right using it for a booty call.”
“I’m real glad to hear that, Tony.” Steve tugged at his collar. “I would have freaked out and ripped the tie off before hand if I’d known you would appreciate it.”
Steve had begrudgingly agreed with the two Alphas.
“Yeah?” Steve rumbled, notching his nose at the soft spot behind Tony’s ear and nipping ticklish at the sensitive lobe. “You still drippin’ with me, or what?”
, he looked touchable and the Alpha’s fingers practically
run for the hills. I guess I could have introduced you to my friends a few at a time, huh?”
“At first, I thought I’d get you a credit card with a set limit for your allowance?” Steve offered. “I’d set it up to be paid automatically from my account and that way you’d never have to worry about it, the money would just be there. If you don’t like a credit card, I could do the same with a debit card, set up a different bank account with auto transfers from my main. How do you feel about that?”
that was your first heat experience.”
“What was that for?” Tony pulled away laughing, dark eyes sparkling and fingers to his lips where they tingled against the press of fangs. “Family size toilet paper doin’ it for you?”
“I’m fine.” Even while greasy Tony was singlehandedly the  most beautiful person Steve had ever seen in his life, and he cupped at Tony’s cheek tenderly as they kissed. “How are you?”
The big blond laughed when Tony turned an unhealthy shade of mortified. “Am I wrong??”
"Sure, go on." Bucky told him, he's eyes were closed, as he was enjoying the breeze.
Tony looked at Steve then to Sarah. "No wonder, Steve looked so familiar. He resembles you in every way. You look younger enough to be his sister more then a mom."
Steve felt as if the time had froze with him. A sudden pain rushed into his heart like a sharp knife that had constantly stabbed him right in the heart, tearing him down piece by piece. It was slow and painful.
Steve wondered what it felt like to be in love. But now he knew even a playboy like Tony Stark could fall in love. Then maybe, there's a possible chance of Steve falling in love too.
Tony sighed, "I get that you don't want to spend time with me, but at least drop me off." Tony implied with a frown.
Tony groaned in frustration, he ran his fingers through his hair. "What the fuck! That doesn't explain anything."
"Don't be foolish boy, I quite like this handsome man. I also know you-" Howard was cut off by Tony .
"Did you actually think I'd allow you to play with my feelings, Stark?" He asked with booming tone of voice, as an evil smirk appeared on his face.
Steve knew he has good looks. If he wanted to he could've got a girlfriend with the snap of his fingers. But, he didn't. He wasn't a playboy and never intends to be.
Tony passed out, his body leaned against Steve's.
Steve had never felt this sudden possessiveness over anyone. He mindlessly stepped out of where he hid and walked to Tony. It was scary how his body moved on it's own, like he didn't have control over his own body.
The crowd cheered in joy, some people were even convinced that both of them wouldn't have had made it out alive.
He hugged Tony tight, not wanting to ever let him go. "I'm here, Tony." Steve meant every words he said. He felt Tony's tears dripping down on his shoulder.
There was not even a single day, where Steve could forget about that day. It was that day, when he felt so much alive, maybe that because he was at the edge of dying. Tony saved him, yet again.
"Have you met Mr Stark, dad? You normally paint based on what you see with your eyes in real life." Peter pointed out.
"You what?" Clint asked.
Bucky hugged him "Awww! Stevie that's adorable, I still can't believe Tony Stark stole your heart. You just need to win him over. But, don't give up, in the future he might be all yours." Bucky cheered brightly, as a smile formed on his face.
Tony couldn't help but wonder why Steve looked so familiar, especially those beautiful blue eyes of his. Tony was sure he'd met him somewhere, but where? There's no way Tony would forget someone who was this hot. Tall, blond, blue eyes, broad shoulders; Steve was the full package.
Bucky's heart was beating fast; this was a sign that he was indeed alive. Bucky felt euphoric, but he didn't know why? Was it because of what Tony had said or was it 'cause he was still alive?
Bucky felt betrayed by his best friend Steve. "How could've not told me something so important" Bucky asked. God, he was very dramatic. "Steve, why didn't you tell us? How though? Where exactly did u meet the Billionaire Tony Stark. Stevie" Bucky questioned him. Well, you can't blame him for being this curious.
Steve started moving his finger, in and out of Tony's warm tight hole, causing Tony to moan between the kisses. "Ah! Fuck, Steve!"
Tony turned toward his mom. "One second, mom!"
All of a sudden Steve's breathing weakened, he couldn't breathe properly. He reached his pocket to get his blue inhaler out, but it wasn't there, he must had left it at home.
The blonde stared at him in disbelief. Not that he blames the man. Tony might've been too straightforward and made him uncomfortable.
Flashback*
Pepper's eyes widened in shock, as she saw Tony's white shirt, it was red. Her heart stopped, when she realized it was covered in blood. "TONY! YOU'RE BLEEDING!" She put his arm around her shoulders, trying to support him to walk.
He had finally made it, he stood there panting heavily. He felt so nervous, to even speak to Tony. He had thank Tony, now or never.
"No, I'm fine. His hands are bleeding not mine." Tony gently moved his suit. It was drenched in blood.
"But-"
Tony quickly moved from Steve's grip. "Dad! He's not my boyfriend." Tony groaned.
Tony gasped for air, he was panting heavily. The crew members threw a lifeguard ring at Tony, he quickly then put it on Bucky. "I promise, I won't let anything happen to you, Bucky. Just don't close your eyes, please stay with me little longer. Help is on their way." Tony pleaded, he panted even more; his body was exhausted.
"Don't worry, get that out of your system." Bucky replied sarcastically, slightly pouting.
"What the fuck just happened?" Clint asked in confusion and broke the silence in room.
Bucky burst into laughter. No one even dared to call Nick Fury by his first name and Tony Stark, even gave him a nickname.
Rhodey immediately pulled him into a hug. "Stupid, why are you apologizing for? When I should be one saying it."
Tony played the music and faced toward Steve. "Since this is an romantic song, I'll show you a couple dance. Since I'm slightly shorter then you, I'll play as the girl. Just follow my lead."
He knocked on the little boy's room and entered. The boy was asleep. Tony walked over to the bedside and placed the things he bought on the table.
The walls Tony built around him for years, now easily had broken down into pieces.
Tony loved Steve far too much, to make Steve stay by his side and let him suffer. Steve deserved happiness and he can't have that if he was with Tony. No, Tony was too broken. Tony's happiness lies in Steve. He would literally do anything for him. Even if it meant letting him go.
Two weeks flew by just like that. Steve learnt many things about Tony. First of all, Tony was incredibly talented and was literally good at everything. Even singing, Steve still remembers the moment he heard Tony singing, it gave him goose bumps. Tony’s voice was beyond beautiful. He couldn’t wait for the day when Tony would finish writing that song.
Steve chuckled softly, locking both of their pinkies to signify that a promise has been made between them. "Pinky Promise."
But now that he was out of the man's embrace, his body began to freeze all over again. He felt like he was in the ice, he was trapped all alone.
Now Steve was yet again left alone in this world, cold and broken. Steve punched the wall hard, drawing out blood from his hand.
Tony stepped in front of Steve. "No, I'll do no such thing" Tony replied. "Don't get me wrong, but I don't know him at all, so I can't introduce you guys."
Steve rushed out of bed and made a run toward the door, he looked back. "I owe you big time, Bucky." He ran out of the room into corridor. Steve looked at the window and luckily he saw Tony in the car park. Steve ran to the car park.
Tony scoffed at the thought of that.
But, Tony had already seen his hand, his eyes widened, as he rushed toward Steve. " Holy shit! You're bleeding!"
"Sarah! Get a grip of yourself. You have to be strong for Steven, especially when he wakes up." King Joseph tried comforting his wife. "I'm sorry doctor, but could you clarify that once again."
"Rogers, Steve Rogers" Steve said.
After a 5 minutes of the ride with Tony, they've made to their destination; the café at last. Steve sighed in relief, his was beating nonstop that he thought his heart was going escape from his chest, during the whole ride. Well, you can't blame Steve for his heart, after all Tony was leaning against back. So, obviously it would excite his poor heart in joy.
Could his day get any worse. All he knew was that he couldn't breathe at all, it was like history had repeated itself from that day; when Tony had saved him.
Three days, 15 hours, 25 minutes and 30 seconds had past, since Steve had last seen or heard from Tony.
If Tony Stark and his dad were dating, he'd be Peter's other dad. The three of them would be a happy family.
"Thankfully no one got hurt. I got into so much trouble. I've learnt a really important lesson in life. Never try doing experiments in schools or where they are lot of people. But to do to it in my own lab. I seriously need to be more careful next time."
What, he what? No, that can't be right. There was no way Steve would be jealous. There's simply no reasons for him to be jealous. But, why was it that Steve's heart ached at the thought of Tony with someone else and not him? Steve gave a Bucky a blank stare. He didn't have a clue.
He put more pressure in kicking his feet, paddling faster. He swam and swam. Just in a nick of time they'd reached to the surface of the water; he guessed luck was on their side.
Tony's lips curved into a smile. "You have beautiful ocean blue eyes, I'm in love-"
“I can’t g-get over her, it hu-hurts!” Tony stuttered with a quivering voice.
"So who's this Steve?" A sudden voice spoke behind him, causing him to get startled.
This time Steve carefully got up and helped Tony to get up. Tony wiped off the dirt on his suit, that's when he noticed the butler was still recording.
Steve simply just nodded.
"I-I can't breathe." Steve somehow managed to say softly.
Tony looked up at Steve, his eyes widened in fear. "Steve, stop!" He shouted and ran toward Steve fast, without wasting a second of time.
"I kinda wanted to know how Stark felt doing a mouth-to-mouth with Bucky." Steve admitted, as he ran his fingers through his hair.
Steve laughed along with them and walked toward Bruce. Who already had the first box ready.
Of course, it was totally normal. Why wouldn't it be?
"How about we get started, you can fuck me all night long, but I have one condition. The bathrobe stays on during the whole time."
Tony burst into laughter even more, after seeing Bucky's reactions.
This was too good to be true, Steve begged this not to be dream. "I'm dreaming, aren't I."
"J.A.R.V.I.S- urg! Fuck." He growled, trying his best to get up. Tony had realized that he hadn't programmed J.A.R.V.I.S in this house.
Steve was startled by the suddenness, he turned his head toward the man. "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to wake you up. I'm just leaving the room to make a quick call."
"Who knows, what the future might bring? And I'm 100% sure you'll meet him soon." Rhodey said.
"Ah, c'mon Nat, don't be like that. I know you're jealous 'cause you're man is my fan, Tony Stark's. I'm very lovable, don't you think?" Tony asked.
"Please don't leave me, Tony." Steve was on his knee, tears was falling out of his eyes.
Steve wanted to know more about Tony, even if it was the littlest things.
Steve repeatedly thought.
Oh God! Steve's heart was sure to die of these sudden shocks he received tonight. Steve couldn't describe how he felt, no one had ever complimented his eyes before, a smile formed on his face.
.....
"Is Nickie giving you a hard time?" Tony asked with frown, like a lost puppy.
Steve yanked Bucky, smashing their lips against each other. No matter, what Steve had to steal back Tony's kiss from Bucky. Tony's lips only belonged to Steve. His heart pounded at the thought of Tony being his. Tony belonged Steve. No one, literally no one can steal him away from. His mine!
She sighed. "Endless work, work ,work!"
"Well to be honest, I also love them and I just hoped that you loved them too and you do. Seems like we both have so much in common." Tony held out his hand again. "Let's be friends." To start a new friendship.
"I-I'm so sorry- I can't help it" Tony tried speaking, but he couldn't stop laughing.
After three years in the army, Steve and Bucky joined S.H.I.E.L.D as secret agents.
Some how those words, felt like a stab in the heart. God, it hurt so bad. Even though, what Tony had said was true. Steve kept his expression normal.
Those words mysteriously implanted inside his head without a warning.
After a few seconds, he realised, those beautiful brown eyes were staring at him right in the eyes.
"Tell me everything from the start." Steve said, for some weird reason he wanted to know everything, that was related to Tony.
"Someone out of nowhere came at me with a knife " Steve replied
Why didn't Natasha want him to know about what Tony had just said? He needed to know the truth.
Peter just hoped Tony Stark would also fall in love with his dad, God knows how. After all, his dad was the best in the world, he deserved all the happiness. Tony Stark wad the key to all this.
"I feel the same way. I'll never forget you, I promise." There was something about the way Steve said that, it was almost as if he truly meant it. But Tony knew it wasn't, the only person who wasn't ever going leave him was himself.
Rhodey let out a slight chuckle. "I knew it!"p
Yep, Steve's father was the king, so that made Steve the crown prince, the once and the future king of Americ Kingdom.
Steve didn't want to say goodbye to Tony. He suddenly felt desolate, as the air around him was filled of melancholy.
Steve felt euphoric knowing that the man actually cared about him. "I'm okay, thank you for helping me."
Somehow, that name triggered a panic attack. The sudden drowsiness nearly caused Steve to lose balance. Luckily he was already leaning against the car for support.
Tony smiled and nodded. "Yes, sweetheart."
Later that day, the doctor came and had done some check up on Steve.
The whole group sat down. Steve knew they'd ask him the question he tried to avoid.
Bucky chuckled. "You do realize, Tony Stark had kissed you on your lips-" Bucky gasped as he realized something else. "Tony Stark was your first kiss, wasn't he?"
Tony was fine being alone. No one could hurt him or the people he loved.
Sarah felt delusional when she heard that the man not only saved her son and bought him gifts, he even paid the full treatments and medications for Steve.
Bucky gasped. "You're a psychic, aren't you?" He eyed Tony suspiciously, not that you can blame Bucky for thinking that. What other possible explanation could this be? Yep, Tony was definitely a psychic and a genius.
Steve brought his lips back to Tonys' and kissed him hard, sucking his tongue.
"Bucky, I-"
Tony burst into laughter, filling the room with his cute laugh. Steve's mouth curved into a smile, he loved seeing Tony smiling and laughing because of something he'd done or said.
Oh God! Steve was in a mess, a beautiful mess and it was all thanks to this man in front of him.
Natasha rolled her eyes. "Tony, you need to stop spacing out. This is important, your safety matters."
"Okay, fine I admit it. I got distracted cause of that, it's just I was kind of surprised to see him there." Steve finally confessed.
His throat felt dry, he constantly wet his lips. For some weird reason, Tony felt a sweet taste to his lips. He went to the bathroom, to freshen up.
Tony looked around the chamber, he was fascinated. "Steve! Your chamber's incredible. Look at all those amazing arts and the displays. Where did you buy these beautiful arts , I wanna it."
"I'm fine, Peter. Thank you for checking on me." Steve loved the kid so much, he treated him like his own son. Steve took Peter in when he just a child. Ever since then they've had the father and son bond.
Steve picked him up and carried him in a bridal style. Tony, was incredibly light. Steve frowned, he was worried about Tony's health.
Steve walked to Tony's room, gently placed him on the bed and tucked him inside. He made sure that Tony was comfortable.
That name had just slip out from his mouth out of nowhere. But, he liked how that name sounded on his lips. Tony suited that man perfectly. Could it be, that was his name all along? Antonio and Tony sounded similar. Obviously the man's name was actually Tony.
"Steve, are you telling me, Tony Fucking Stark breathed for you. As in actually mouth to mouth?" Bucky asked as stood up and walked near Steve.
All Steve knew was that he cared deeply about Tony more ever. He couldn't live without him. Steve needed him.
Tony's eyes widened in shock. "Medications? Isn't he just a kid."
"-Steve! Hellooo" Tony called, snapping his fingers in front Steve's face to get his attention on him. Thankfully, it worked.
"I guess that would be too unfair for the boys. Anthony, I know you want to finish your project at home, but just this once, please stay here and I'm trusting you to keep out of trouble. Okay my boy. I love you."
But for some weird reason he was afraid of seeing Steve's reaction. Somehow, he cared about what Steve thought about him.
Tony wrapped his arms around Steve's neck and smirked. "I'm all yours tonight." He then kissed Steve with a low growl, devouring him completely. Their tongues swirled with saliva.
No! He wasn't going to let that happen.
"We're gonna have to find someone else to look after Tony, while where on the business for two weeks. What are we gonna do? I need someone I could trust to look after Tony."
If only Steve were to know how much Tony truly despised him. All those things he said about Steve earlier were nothing but a beautiful lie.
"Dad, I already told you, I don't know him. Why are you inviting a stranger?" Tony asked in a cold tone.
Those lips felt just right on his lips, it was so God damn warm. Steve wondered how warm it must feel inside the man's mouth. Just before Steve could open his mouth, the man broke from the kiss. He felt disappointed.
"Who said I'm scared?" Natasha questioned him, lifting up one of her eyebrows. She removed her hand away from Tony's mouth.
"Ah Tony, anyone would be lucky to have you as a friend. We're only asking you so much things about Steve, is because we know you're interested in Steve, platonic. Don't get me wrong. It's okay to want him as a friend or even more. That's the least you deserve." Pepper gave Tony a gentle hug, with sweet smile.
"W-what! I most certainly don't" Tony said, he raised his voice. It was almost as if he was offended by the comment or maybe it was because they were dead right about that.
Tony hated seeing Steve like this, he couldn't even look at Steve properly. Tony had to make this choice, there was no other way. Even if meant it would kill Tony inside.
"It must be my lucky day, today. Having to get countless compliments from Tony Stark, I'm speechless."
He hated the darkness, he hated being alone. He tried screaming, but his mouth was completely sealed shut.
Steve pushed thoughts away. "Sorry, are you alright, Mr. Stark?" He asked.
Even though it hasn't been an hour since he met him, Steve felt comfortable around him. There was something about the man he just couldn't put his fingers on it.
Wait- he's able to breathe now. Tony Stark saved him yet again. How was he ever gonna pay Tony back?
Steve ran his fingers through his hair and took a deep breath before starting to speak. "I didn't know it was him, until now. I know for sure that it was Tony Stark that saved me, it was definitely him."
The moment Steve touched him, Tony pushed him with all his strength, causing Steve stumble back. He looked at Steve with disgust. "Don't fucking touch me, hate you fucking bastard." Tony shouted and ran away from Steve.
Stark men are made of Iron.
Did he had a panic attack just now? Oh dear lord, he actually did and the man just saved him.
Steve had a mixture of feelings. He felt ecstatic, yet despondent. Deep down inside, Steve knew Tony would never love him, he could never be his. The thought of that killed him.
"I'm fine, Ma. Thanks to the young man that saved me, Ma." Steve mentioned with a bright smile.
The three of them laughed together and went toward the lift.
Howard got out of the car and looked at his best friend in defeat. He didn't what to dodo. “My wife and I have go to this business trip for 2 weeks, but the person who was supposed to look after Tony, suddenly fell ill. He was the only person I could trust to watch Tony for us. But in a short time like this, I can't find a nanny that is trustable to watch over Tony in our mansion all alone. "
Tony walked toward the door, "By the way, ragazzi, fate una coppia carina. (You guys make a cute couple.) See yaa!" Tony said in Italian and then left the room, leaving Bucky and Natasha alone.
"That's adorable, Anthony!" The queen hugged Tony.
Tony ran up to him and grabbed him by the arm. "Steve-"
Well, It's not like he was actually lying about his name. Anthony could also be pronounced as Antonio. His mom had always called him by Antonio since he was born.
The moment Tony came into his life, Steve was flooded with euphoria. He felt alive. Tony made him feel things; which he can't seem comprehend.
"Oh hey, mum. I thought I'd just drop by to see how you're doing." Steve told his mom, not that he was lying or anything.
God! How was he ever going to move on? After all, Pepper was his first love, his first ever relationship. How was he going to erase all those beautiful memories of them together? He just fucking can't!
Tears streamed down Tony's face, as he realized something. "Oh- G-god...w-wh-at have I d-done!" He stuttered, as his voice trembled.
Tony kept running, without looking back. He didn't want Steve to see him in this state. He needed more time, to get over this break up.
Tony slowly moved away from the hug, it looked like he had calmed down. He felt so much better, after lifting those off his shoulders.
"Aren't you afraid, that if anything were to happen to me, you'd get into trouble." There sadness to his tone.
A warm smile appeared on Tony’s face. “Thank you, Honeybear!"
Tony knew the man wasn't aware of who he truly was. So there was no point in telling him his stage name. It would just ruin the mood.
Tony's parents said goodbye and got inside the car. "Antonio, sweetheart. It's time for us to go. "
Pepper got the pen out of her bag and handed it to him. "Awwww, is that a get well soon card for the little boy. That's so sweet of you Tony."
"But in our universe soulmates doesn't exist, what a shame. If it did then we'd be soulmates. That would be so awesome, I'd treasure and love you for eternity. I know more stories a about soulmates, but I'll tell you later, if you're interested."
"What's wrong, Howard? Why do you look so worried?" Steve's father asked.
Sarah got back to her job.
Tony placed the video camera on the floor and stood up to be face to face with Steve. "Screw you, Rogers. I don't care if you're the God damn prince but you can't shout at me for no reasons." Tony spat back, gripping Steve by the collar.
"Well, how about next time you pick up your phone." Rhodey had deadpan expression, his voice drips sarcasm.
Tony held the little boy's tiny hand. "If I had powers, I would've taken all your pain away. But, you have to be strong like you always had, cause I know you have a bright future kid." Tony gently raffled the child's hair.
"That's absurd. I work for no one but myself." Steve scoffed, rolling his eyes in annoyance. He felt insulted being compared to those low ass mother fuckers.
She covered his mouth. "No! Don't listen to him, he's making shit up" Natasha stated.
When all of sudden someone had bumped right into him. The smaller man's face was buried into his chest. Steve could feel the man's lips touching his skin  through his tight shirt.
He'd missed Tony so much. If only Tony had missed him as much as he did. Steve hated to admit, but he was afraid that Tony won't even remember his name. Not that he blames Tony or anything.
Just before he could even take the first step, a warm hand held Steve's hand stopping him from leaving. "Where do you think you're going, sweet cheeks?" The voice that Steve thought was asleep asked.
"Ahem!" Tony cleared his throat, to get their attention, as they were too busy in their own world. They were both startled by the sudden voice, they turned toward Tony.
Everything was gone back to the way it was before. It was as if Tony was never there to begin with.
“Is the tie really that bad?” Tony glanced at and then away from the bare skin at Steve’s throat. “You act as if you were just saved from the gallows.”
Bucky thought he was doing the right thing bringing you here but the fact he did it in a way that has you still--”
“Pretty Omega.” Steve whispered, nearly crooned and for a terrifying moment Tony thought he would pass out before the Alpha finally eased away and offered him a quick smile. “Anyway, now that I’ve gone and made you self conscious for no reason at all, as my profile stated I’m thirty five, gonna be thirty six this summer. Does that big of an age difference matter to you?”
“Yeah yeah yeah.” Despite Tony feeling uncertain about his
“Harder.” Tony panted out loud, squirmed in excitement when Steve grabbed at his hips to hold him down and pulled suckling at his chest. “Steve–!
him, I don’t know him and I don’t want to.”
The party wound down about an hour after the game finished, the last of the snacks devoured and the various couples calling for rides to find their way home. The brownstone went from overflowing with noise and laughter to nearly somber silent with in a matter of minutes, nothing but the sound of Tasha doing a few dishes in the kitchen and the quiet scrape of furniture as Tony tried to rearrange the chairs and footstools to their normal position.
an inner tube around my waist.”
“I’m sorry.” Tony turned and kissed her cheek. “Sorry we worried you. But we’re okay now.”
“Uh huh, on one side of that big ol’ bed you have yet to share with anyone?” Bucky raised highly judgmental eyebrows. “Sounds real homey and definitely like productive, healthy mental reasoning and not at all like you’re avoidin’ intimacy while being’ scared t’death of dyin’ alone and failing at painting visual representations of grief.”
Either way it was too late, because Tony hit send on a hastily typed out text then tossed his phone away to focus on rescuing an unfortunate amount of cheesy noodles from the floor as Peter clumsily dug at his plate.
“I’m tapping out, you watch him so I can take a nap.” Natasha groaned and Bucky groaned

“Come for me then.” Steve knocked Tony’s hand away at his cock and took over again, fisting him hard and fast and almost too rough, twisting his wrist and soaking his fingers in the copious spend spilling from Tony’s slit. “C’mon babydoll, wanna feel you come, wanna feel you get all tight in there for me, suck me right in, milk me empty, you know you want it–!”

The first bonding gift was diamonds, a band with enough sparkle to make Tony’s head spin, three different pieces to the ring that Steve explained in a hushed whisper were supposed to their family, he and Tony and Peter, their lives crossed together and made into something beautiful.
to do that to you and--”
Dinner had been nostalgic, messy burgers at the diner where they’d gone for their second date. Steve had suggested something five star and dress coded, Tony had snarked, “What, so you can panic mid meal and rip your tie off and try to end the date early again?” and while the Omega had laughed himself half to death, Steve had narrowed his eyes and decided on
“The fuck--?!”
“Anything you want, baby.” On anyone else, a smile so big and lovey-dovey would have looked absolutely stupid, but on Steve it only looked heartstoppingly handsome. “I’ll be right back.”

“Partly because I’m scoping out this mega hot Omega.” the Alpha admitted, and Nat wanted to know, “Oooh, is he my type?”
“I’m not just saying it to make you happy.” Tony met Steve’s gaze steadily, letting the relief in their mutual decision shine through his eyes. “But this food looks delicious and I haven’t eaten yet, so do you think they’d judge us terribly if we asked for a doggy bag for our leftovers?”
They hadn’t even set a date yet, much less thought about invitations but Howard didn’t know that and a part of Steve was

“Sure. A means to an end.” Clint rolled his eyes. “Cos you’re
“What do you mean?” Steve’s eyes were still closed, every sense tuned to the way Tony felt against him, his heavy frame tense as he tried to hold himself back from moving too quickly and his hands at Tony’s waist almost tentative so he wouldn’t grab too fast and shatter the fragility of their first

“Maybe that will change.”

to him for months now.”
“Pete could sleep through a hurricane.” Tony leaned back far enough to force the Alpha to lift his head. “Steve listen. You said you wanted to talk in the morning so--”
“Can I bring you something?” Steve asked before he thought about it, then backtracked, “You probably don’t want to see anyone if you’re sick. Could I have something delivered for you?”
, so he struggled for calm and for patience and asked, “Does the other guy even know about Pete?”
“Cheese all done!” Peter cried, and Tony looked down at the pot to see the entire bag of cheese melting into the noodles. “Did I do good?”
“Okay.” the Omega said again, slower this time. “Well, based on the way your phone’s blowing up with text messages right now, I’m going to guess that the Alpha is falling just as hard for you and that’s a good thing, right? If his heart’s already involved then maybe everything else will just be...details?”
“Am I really going to do this?” Steve wondered to himself as he hit the
“Fine fine.” She waved him off. “But you managed something pretty at least, yes? Maybe a bit of lace?”
“You taste so good right here.” Steve moaned filthy, licking wet and sloppy at Tony’s rim, plucking at the tight muscle with his lips, his tongue until the tight muscle started to give. “So good baby, I never wanna have anything else on my tongue, wanna still be tasting you tomorrow morning when I drink my coffee.”
“I just figured out a way to get you something on a card without it being a debit or credit card.” Steve continued conversationally as he ushered Tony out onto the sidewalk. “I can create you a profile with Uber or one of the other car services, link it to my card and then you can take a car wherever you need for whatever reason. I won’t see the destination or the duration or anything, but this way you never have to worry about catching a ride, especially if you’re coming to see me.”

“Don’t be cranky.” Easily pulling one cart and pushing the second along in front of him, the Alpha hurried to catch up with Tony and plonk a kiss on his head. “I just don’t want my first contribution to Pete’s life to be curse words.

made of the Alpha’s usually pristine space.
“Stop.” She wagged a finger at him. “None of that now, there’s nothing to be sorry. How are the two of you doing?”
I found him livin’ like that and knew you would want him out! I was tryna rescue him not tryna scare him! And yeah, I had to use a Command on him to get him into the car but--”
“Alright then.” Tony’s hand looked very small against the breadth of Steve’s chest as he first flattened his palm to the beat of the Alpha’s heart, then grasped at Steve’s shirt. All his fears about eggshells and midnight had disappeared the second he’d seen Peter sleeping so trusting on Steve’s chest and now the weeks of uncertainty and being careful melted down
“Tony said you babysat Pete again last night.” Clint tried

“Alright love, we’ll be there just as soon as we can.”
“Uh huh.” Clint’s eyes sharpened. “Is he the one I owe a knee capping too?”
Now if only he could find a way to say that without sounding like an awkward, lovesick lunatic that would be

“For the record, I’m not opposed to you still working.” Steve said, and the Omega countered, “For the record, it wasn’t really up to you.”
Mr. Rogers.
“Pretty Omega.” Steve rumbled, sucking at Tony’s tongue and gripping the Omega’s little waist, the curve of his hip and rise of his rear. “Sweet perfect Omega. You have no idea how crazy I am about you.”
“It’s not anything.” Tony tied the new apron almost viciously around his waist, knotting the bow with an irritated jerk. “Just some asshole Alphas who think they can say whatever they want because I’m apparently

that led them stumbling onto the white couch and knocking over the pillows as they tried to get undressed. When it was all said and done, the
“Your art studio on the third floor of your Brooklyn Heights brownstone?” the Omega waggled his eyebrows and hummed, “It's a hard knock life, for you. It's a hard knock life! For you!”
Tony popped the champagne first, drying his tears and sipping at the bubbly from the delicately beautiful glass as he stood at the floor to ceiling windows and stared out at the city. The Omega hadn’t grown up in Brooklyn, he’d grown up in Manhattan, but the skyline was iconic and memorable all the same and the sight took Tony back
“I think the Alpha’s falling in love.” she said wisely, and Tony flushed a dull red clear to his ears as he drowned a piece of lobster in butter and popped it in his mouth. “Tony, this is absolutely beyond what a sugar daddy does for a sugar baby, don’t you think?”
“I’m fine, I’ll figure it out.” That-- that sounded like a lie. Maybe not a direct lie but Steve had that same distinct, uncomfortable feeling he got whenever he thought Tony wasn’t telling him the whole story, that maybe the Omega was hiding something that wasn’t necessarily important but that was also

are gorgeous.”
“What’s going on?” Clint was off at the same time and the big Omega bumped up behind Tony, peering over his shoulder to try and scope the text. “Why are you tellin’ Steve no?”
It took a couple of weeks for Tony to fully settle into Steve’s house and even
to settle. Between Omegas, the firm touch meant only safety and security and when Tony reached to rub circles at Clint’s nape, the blond nearly crumpled, head bowing and tremors running through his body.
“For what?” Tony wanted to know, and Steve brushed their mouths together for another endlessly tender few seconds.
“To be honest, I didn’t realize how crazy it seemed to have all these people in one room until you said something.” Steve looked around at his friends, his coworkers and squad members, the people that had had his back and literally saved his life more times than he could count. “I guess… it is a little crazy?”
someone for me?”
“I um--” Tony cleared his throat, heart sinking a bit realizing that Steve wouldn’t be in town for his birthday, sinking
“It’s um--” the Omega cleared his throat, running his tongue anxiously over his fangs and trying not to flinch when they cut blood into his mouth. “It’s one thing to say

“Well damn.” Bucky burst out laughing. “I’ve never been so firmly turned down for a pair of tiddies in my life!
“No, it was fine.” Tony’s voice was muffled a little beneath the turned up collar. Steve smelled incredible and it was honestly a fifty-fifty chance he’d be willing to give this jacket back when the car came. It had been a long time since he’d been remotely
“I dunno yet.” Bucky watched as the trio climbed into an Uber and sped away. “But I’m sure as hell about to find out.”

“How about here?” Gentle down the side of Tony’s cheek, along his jaw, to the line of his throat and staying far away from the nape of his neck. “Is here okay?”

him in a touch starved needy sort of way and that-- that wasn’t a feeling Tony was used to at all.
“I’m already yours, Steve.” Tony pleated his fingers into Steve’s shirt. “You know that.”
“Can we go back to bed?” Steve mumbled around the shove of the Omega’s tongue in his mouth, yanking at the robe ties so he could get to skin. “Omega, my Omega let’s just go back to bed. Can’t knot you till we bond and I want to do that all the right way but let me just get my tongue in you at least.”
the problem. Can I be very honest with you right now?”
“We’re gonna have more fun in a minute.” Steve crouched next to Peter and pointed the toddler towards a display stacked with massive teddy bears. “See those bears, bud? You want one?”
Tony didn’t know how he felt
Steve’s mouth pulled down in a frown as he glanced over, and the Omega shrugged, “Steve. I’m twenty one with an almost three year old and I’ve spent the better part of the last four years just trying to survive day to day. I’m not exactly the white dress wedding chapel sort of Omega.”
“I suppose it will do.” Tony took the blanket and pushed his face into the softness, breathing in and out a few times to calm his heart. “Thank you, Steve.”
“Good afternoon, Mr. Rogers. I’m sorry to bother you.” It was the manager from the jewelry store on State Street and they sounded as professionally pissed off as humanly possible. “We have something of a situation. You purchased a watch from us several weeks ago and unfortunately, I have to ask if you are aware of the location of your watch, as we have someone here trying to return it and claiming it is
“I'm sorry.” Tony blinked dramatically slowly, fluttering those long lashes in a manner meant to be teasing... with no idea just what the play at being coy did to the Alpha's sanity. “Are you threatening me with a comfy evening in, a bunch of food, a couch I get to make my own butt print on and enough wine to risk spilling? Oh no. Oh
and still halfway breathless over being that close. “It’s um-- it’s gone now.”
“Oh the hell we are.” Tony bumped into the crib when he backed up another step, keeping himself between the Alpha and Pete as if his slight weight would even register as a deterrent if Bucky decided to take Peter himself. “Get out of my house. Go on.”
Bucky tilted his head toward the side, he saw Natasha and Tony. The next he knew, Natasha had cupped his face and crashed her lips against his. Her lips were extremely soft. After a few seconds, Natasha parted her lips away. She hugged Bucky, tightly. He could feel her body trembling against him.
Tony face toward Steve. "Hey, Steve." He called. Something about Tony's tone was off.
Thankfully, Bruce bandaged his hand with two layers, the inner layer was a woven material bandage. Whereas the outer layer had a waterproof bandage.
Steve felt angry, he felt betrayed. Tony didn't want to stay with him and knowing that hurt him deeply. If Tony were to leave today, Steve probably wouldn't see him for another decade, just like his father and Tony's dad.
Tony gave his hand to Steve. "Of course." He stepped closer to Steve, he gently held the back of Steve hand and placed it on his waist. Whilst the other hand on his shoulder. Tony then wrapped his arms around Steve's neck.
"Honeybear!" Tony called out loud. He ran toward the man and jumped into his arms, gently embracing him. "I've missed you so much, Honeybear!"
Rhodey ruffled Tony’s hair. “Just don’t keep things to yourself, there are lot of people in your life who cares about you, Tony." He felt the need to that say to Tony.
He ran to his room without stopping.
"You're welcome, Cap."
Tony gently cupped her face and made her face him properly. "Pepper! Look at me, I'm fine. I promise you, I'm not hurt, that's not my blood, I swear. In the party, a guy name Steve got a deep cut in his hand and I helped him, he's blood dripped on my shirt, that’s all." He explained to her. He just hoped that Pepper Understood him. Tony hated seeing Pepper in this state, he hated when she had to suffer because of him.
Steve felt a sudden hand pulling him in. "Shhh! Steve, it's me." Thankfully it was Bucky.
Tony noticed Sarah, he walked closer to the door to greet her. "Hey there, Sarah- wait a moment! So Steve is your son." Tony asked in disbelief. "That explains so much, mother like son." Tony muttered to himself.
, Steve." Tony softly whispered, gently closing the door and then left the motel.
"Nah as long as your okay now that’s fine. By the way, what's your name?"
Pepper hugged Tony again. "You're such a child, Tony" She commented.
"Solitary Is My Sanctuary" a child's voice spoke. Steve couldn't help but think how familiar the child's voice sounded. Had he met this child before? If so, why can't he remember anything.
"Why do I care so much about you, Tony Stark? Why?" Steve muttered underneath his breath. If only he knew the answers.
"Be right back." He told Pepper. Tony shut the door behind and went to the store.
"I ship Uckysha" Tony cheered, as he winked at Bucky.
Still editing so there's gonna be lot of grammar mistakes.
Bucky gently rubbed his back. "I'm sorry Steve. Tony Stark will never back down without a fight, so don't u dare to even think for a seconds his dead. He is one of the smartest, bravest man in the world. He is a Stark, and Stark men are made of iron. Just don't give up on that hope, you need to stay strong, so you can protect him. Your Tony, Steve, his yours. Don't you ever lose hope." Bucky had meant every words he said. He'd never deceive Steve by saying lies, Never.
"Focus on something else, focus on my voice. Focus on me, I'm almost done." Tony was being extre careful in treating Steve's wounds.
Steve looked at his hand. Tony had cleaned his wound and bandage it so perfectly. "Thank you, Mr Stark, sorry I had wasted your time"
Yours T.S,
These past two weeks were very hectic for Steve, as being the leader of The Aven Clan. Not to mention, the endless paper works, as well as missions. God, it was literally so tiring. But, Steve loved his position, he loved leadership because that was the only way he could look out for his fellow clan members and lead them.
"You can rest assure dad, Stark men are made of iron. That's why I'm gonna aim for the top." Tony had a smug on his face, he was confident and brave. Tony was completely opposite of Steve.
The lady took their orders and left.
Steve gently cupped Tony's face. "Tony" He whispered.
Bucky had heard and seen everything Tony had done for him. even though, they'd only met an hour ago, Tony risked his life to save him.
Tony burst into laughter. "Is that what's troubling you? More like you'd be the one in trouble, along with me. A month ago, I was suspended for 2 weeks, for accidentally blowing up the science lab.
Curiosity my ass!
"Is that so? But why do you care about what Tony felt?" Natasha asked, suspiciously looking at him.
"Thank you, your majesty. I really appreciate the compliment, especially since it's coming from you." Tony politely thanked and walked to Steve.
"I just told you, I accidentally broke into his house-"
Steve didn't have a clue to what was going on. "Soulmates?"
"No way, you actually caught everything in tape. I've got my first kiss captured in tape." Tony walked toward the butler and took the camera. He saved the recordings with a smile.
"The prince of Americ Kingdom, doesn't know how to dance? Well, I must say I'm very surprised. But, don't you worry. Your wish is my command. I'll teach you."
Steve’s body were only an inch away from Tony’s. Tony noticed how Steve’s eyes looked so God damn familiar. "You're eyes are so pretty." Tony blurted out.
Tony sighed heavily, glaring at them. "If you say Steve! I'm gonna lose my mind and flip out."
There was no way, he'd let his feelings get in the way. He can't lose Tony, before even has him. That meant Steve needed to wait for the right moment to confess to Tony.
"Yeah, what about him?" Steve asked.
"Ah Nickie, did you miss me? What can I say, I'm a very busy man." Tony hugged Nick Fury. How did Tony knew Steve's boss? And why were they so familiar with each other?
They reached to the main base, everyone was already there.
"Y-you think I'm handsome?" Steve eventually managed to ask Tony.
Tony looked at Steve and sighed. "My dad just bailed on us, he even took my car with him." Tony replied. "Can you lend me your phone for a few seconds, I left my phone in  the car."
Even Bucky, knew that wasn't what Tony had said, there was no way Bucky would've buy that load of crap. But, he simply just nodded. Okay, now he was so damn curious.
He liked this side of Tony Stark; the real side of Tony. It just showed that at the end of the day, Tony Stark was a human and a very special one.
Steve's pupils were dilated. He plastered a smile on his face.
Steve was breathing raggedly, gasping for air. It was as if he was drowning. His heart ached nonstop. Steve cried in the rain for hours, not moving an inch. Like his body was glued to that place.
Steve's heart pounded even fast, he was blushing infront of the man he's in love with.
"What, No way! How is it that someone as hot as you possibly remain single?" Tony asked in disbelief, not that he was exaggerating or anything. Tony hadn't expect that at all.
Steve was left dumbfounded. He screwed big times, it was so obvious that Tony didn't want anyone to hear his conversation.
Steve and his parents dropped Tony and his parents to the car. Tony quickly rushed inside the car, almost as if he wanted to escape from here as soon as possible. Steve felt gutted, he thought Tony enjoyed the party as much as he did.
"Huh, sorry what were you saying?"
Tony scoffed. "Just don't regret it later, Rogers."
"No, Amy. It's not me. It's you're effort that finally paid off what you deserved." Tony stated.
Tony immediately took the helmet off and shoved it to Steve. "I swear down, if you start an argument for this fucking helmet, I'm seriously going to lose it and sue your ass for wasting my precious time. Is that understood, young man." Tony stated out, with a clear annoyance to his tone.
Tony had a warm smile on his face. "Pep, Honeybear. I really appreciate the effort. But, it not like I'll see Steve again." Tony let a low sigh.
Tony bit the edge of his lips and took a deep breath. He finally looked at Steve in the eyes and spoke. "Let's break up" Tony repeated, in a serious tone.
"Remind me to never, get off the wrong side with you 'cause Pepper my poor soul literally petrified of you, when you're angry." Tony gulped, he blinked repeatedly. He crossed his arms and smirked like a child who showed off their new toys to other kids'; felt superior and proud.
The doctor pressed two fingers against Tony's neck, checking for pulse. "He's still alive, if we hurry and take him to the hospital. There's a chance of him surviving."
"Ouch! That hurt- it's real." Tony jumped in excitement, he run and hugged Steve. "I'm so glad, I've met you, Steve. My handome prince charming."
“I’m just glad you’re okay.” Sarah cupped Steve's face and placed a kiss on his forehead. "I'll get you something to eat." With that said, she exited the room.
"Steve, what you did was reckless, Today. I've never seen you lose focus before in a mission. What happened?" Natasha asked.
Steve gaped at the billboard screen. It was the first time, that something had caught his eyes; in which, where an Ad was played in the big screen of a man.
After a minute of just making out, they broke from the kiss. Steve leaned closer to the point their forehead touched. "Tell me when to stop."
Tony's face glowed, his lips curved into a bright smile. Steve had to admit Tony looked so cute and adorable. It was totally normal for him to think that about a child, right?
Steve couldn't believe what he was hearing. But, maybe he's father was right, maybe this was the only way Steve could get Tony back.
"Now, I seriously I have to meet Steve. So when are planning to introduce us?" Pepper shrieked in excitement.
Just a second ago, Tony seemed so happy but then in 0.1 seconds later Tony stomped his way out in anger.
He immediately shot his eyes opened, this time he succeeded in doing it. He was welcomed by a bright light. He forced his body to sit up on the bed.
Tony couldn't help but crack up. "I'm a what now! A psychic?" He hadn't heard something so absurd as this, it was fucking hilarious.
Steve felt bad for eavesdropping, but couldn't just leave Tony alone.
Bucky put both of his on his face, covering his mouth. Oh Dear Lord! He was actually in love with Natasha all this time. How was he so blind not to notice that? Bucky was dying of embarrassment.
Bucky nodded. "So tell me? Did you meet someone special?"
A year had passed, since then. Steve walked passed the office of the military, he heard a voice mentioned Tony's name, immediately his body froze. He turned toward the TV, he felt sick when he had seen the screen. In the news "Tony Stark has been presumed dead" was written. He couldn't breathe properly, it was as if his whole world was crashing down on him. Steve couldn't process what he just saw and had heard.
Steve's mood suddenly darkened, he hated being ignored by Tony. It felt like his whole world was crashing down him. Everything he ever wanted was slipping away from him.
Tony mentally slapped himself.
But, Steve knew the word love, he just didn't know what love truly is or how it felt. So, how was he ever going find out if he's in love with anyone?
Soon his room was filled with Tony's portraits. All he ever thought was about Tony day and night. He couldn't begin understand why, he felt this sudden obsession over Tony. Steve never knew he had this kind of a side; it scared him.
Tony! Steve shot his eyes wide open. He was welcomed by the most beautiful pair of hazel eyes. He knew who those belonged to. There was not even a single day, where Steve could forget about that day. It was that day, he felt so much alive, maybe that was because he was at the edge of dying.
Bucky gave Tony a dazed look of bewilderment.
During the meeting Tony's eyes kept on drifting to Steve. He couldn't help but wonder why Steve looked so God damn familiar. Had they met somewhere else before?
Steve nodded. Bucky slowly removed his hand away. He sat down on the bed.
Who knew, that today would've been his lucky day.
As a single tear ran down Steve's cheek, in contrasting with the rain drops that dripped down his face.
"Ah yes, Thank you Happy" Tony said. He opened the car door and got out. He shut the door. "Drive home safely, Happy. Good night"
"It's fine, Rogers." He wrapped his suit around my hand "take this, the bandage is already covered in blood. Rogers u need to get this stitched asap"
his lap without breaking from the kiss.
Tony's breath brushed against Steve's skin, it sent shivers down his spine. Tony was only an inch away from him, if only he could pull Tony closer and kiss him hard. But, sadly Steve had to resist himself from doing that.
After reaching to the 6th floor the door opened with a ding. The corridor was awfully quiet and freaking huge.
He had lost Tony before, he can't lose him again. No, never! There is no way in hell, Steve would ever let of Tony again. Tony solely belonged to him, he was Steve's.
"Thanks for the offer, Steve. But I really can't. I'm an outsider, I don't belong here. This palace is only meant for the royal family. I'd rather stay in my mansion. "
Steve crashed onto the cold concrete floor. His breathing became abnormal, no doubt about it, Steve was having a panic attack. This hadn't happened to him in years, but out all people in the whole wide world, It had to happen in front of Tony Stark.
Tony broke from his deep thoughts. "Huh? Yes, Happy?"
Was I just thinking about how Tony's lips felt? Oh sugar!
Steve blushed even more at the thought of that. Steve nodded with a weak smile.
Natasha knew many languages, as well as Italian. "He said you take some rests, instead of talking." Natasha lied, with a calm gentle tone. She smiled at him.
A voice inside him spoke. The voice sounded exactly like him, that was because it was him.
Steve couldn't help but think how perfect it sounded when Tony called his name. He freaking loved it, Tony's voice was like a melody to his ears, it was very addicting.
What! No, Steve didn't want Tony to leave.
The birds were chipping in the early morning. Steve smelt a delicious smell in the air.
Tony covered his face with both of his hands. "I hope you get the happiness you deserve, Pepper." He really meant what he had said.
"Maybe Stark's just in my mind? Since every where I go, Stark's name is always mentioned." Steve sighed.
Suddenly, Steve felt a sharp pain in his eyes, tears were dripping down his cheeks. His eyes were shifting to red, his iris were now blood red.
"What! When was I-"
"If that's the case, Why don't you just produce an heir, that way a royal blood will inherit the throne and you can have Anthony back. " Joseph added. He had a point though.
A single tear ran down his cheek. The pain in his heart was unbearable, Steve clutched his shirt tight. His mind was going blank, his vision became blurry.
Steve knew that it was because of the fact that he was a prince that his two best friends died. He hated it. It was his god damned fault. They both died protecting the prince. How Steve wished he could turn back time and protect them instead, then maybe they'd by his side right now.
Steve noticed how Tony clutched his bathrobe when he was speaking. Whatever he was hiding , Tony clearly didn't want Steve to know or see it. He was totally okay with Tony having the bathrobe on during the intercourse. He respected Tony's privacy, but deep down he was worried about him.
Tony's mouth dropped open when he saw Steve's thing. "Holy shit! It's fucking huge!" He gulped  repeatedly, not knowing how on earth was he going take in something so big. His ass was definitely gonna split open.
Steve chuckled. "I'm sure I'll be alright." He reassured him.
The guy looked up, a bright smile appeared on his face.
If only there was a way for Steve to protect Tony, then he would, even if it meant having to put his own life on the line.
" I wanted to let you know that, I know you're already feeling guilty. But, I understand why you'd react like that. Not being being able to do anything, while the person you love is slowly drifting away from you. I know, Steve and believe me when I say, someone will love you and adore you more than me. You were never mine to begin with, Steve. I can't give you the things you want the most, I can't give you a kid, I can't make you a father. I'm a playboy, I can't make long term commitments, I hope you understand, Steve." Tony stated, with frown on his face.
But, where the fuck was Tony's car? And where was his dad?
The eight year old Steve, was weak and was constantly in medication. His body was fragile.
Steve was beaming red, he could feel the heat rushing up his face. C'mon Steve, think of how you're going to respond to Bucky. "I didn't realize CPR was considered as a kiss." Thankfully, his voice sounded normal. There was no way Bucky would catch him acting suspicious.
Tony's eyes widened, he never thought someone like Steve would cry 'cause of him. Tony felt gutted, all he wanted was pull Steve into a hug and comfort him.
"Remembers what exactly?" Bucky asked suspiciously.
"Anyway, dad. See you later." Peter kissed Steve on the cheek and exited the room, leaving Steve alone.
He quickly got changed and headed out to his mansion in Malibu.
"N-o, don't get me wrong, Steve. I'm not laughing at you." Tony chuckled. " I thought it was kinda cute, I didn't expect you to be this adorable. You're such a gentleman, ladies must go crazy for you."
"I-I don't know what to say, other then thank you... I'm Steve." The man known as Steve said with a sweet smile.
So that was the reason why Tony was so eager to reach to his car. By the look on Tony's face it looked like he was excited to give Steve his birthday gift.
Tony cupped his face "y-your eyes so prewtyy." The words came out of Tony's mouth with a a slight slur, he sounded like a child. Steve found it rather this side of Tony freaking adorably cute.
Tony removed his hands away from Steve's shirt and stood there frozen, staring at Steve in disbelief. He took a step back.
"Uckysha?" Bucky asked.
Joseph cupped Steve's face, he gently wiped his tears. "What's wrong, my child?" Somehow, he was afraid to ask. He already knew the answer to it.
"I can't believe you actually said that, you're really straightforward." Tony chuckled. "I really like that about you." Tony said, gazing at Steve with an impression that sent his heart pounding. He felt euphoric.
Steve's eyes drifted back to the painting in front of him, a smirk appeared on his face. "I can't wait for the day to make you completely mine, Tony." He whispered softly, making a promise to himself.
Both Steve and Howard were astounded by Tony.
Steve stared as Tony's car drove off.
The next morning, Tony had woken up, with a really bad hangover. He let out a deep groan as his head throbbed in pain. With the tip of his finger, he gently massaged his forehead. Not that it helped his headache, but it sure felt nice.
"So, what's bothering you? Is it that Stark is kissing some other man and not you?" Bucky playfully joked. He's mouth dropped open, when he saw Steve's expression.
Steve's heart began beat faster.
Tony glared at them. "Pep, you can't be serious. I don't even know anything about Steve. How would I even tell you guys?" Tony let out a deep sigh.
His thoughts drifted back to Tony, when Steve heard a muffled voice that sounded way too familiar. He suddenly felt those familiar soft pair of lips against his own.
Steve stood there. Tony had said the same thing, when they'd first met. Both of them were staring into each other's eyes, without blinking. Like they were in their own little world.
Steve let out a chuckle. "Why does it sound, like you have a thing for Stark?" Steve asked as a joke.
Tony put his hands in the air, surrendered himself, he shook his head. "Okay, fine! Look guys, I'll be honest, so what if I find Steve attractive? He is fucking hot as fuck and not just cause his blond. He has beautiful blue eyes and I kinda got lost in those eyes for a few seconds; that's how pretty his eyes were. His deep voice matched his perfect looks and those broad shoulders, fucking hell. His body's so sexy. I'm not exaggerating at all, but even a straight guy like me would fall for him. Not that I like him or anything, especially not in romantic way. So don't you dare to jump into conclusions. I admit I find Steve really attractive, but that's all and nothing more." Tony said, he was trying catch his breath. Tony couldn't even believe the most of the things he just said.
Steve had never seen Tony this angry before, not eve in the media. So, what exactly happened that made Tony react like that?
Both of them weren't able describe their feelings with words. Steve was curious to know how the story was going to unfold, he didn't realize he was already reading half way through the book.
"I swear, if you guys tease me about him again, I'm gonna- well actually I don't know what I'm gonna do with guys." Tony warned them.
Is this how lust felt? Until now he had never once touched anyone sexually. He had waited for years, thinking someone was also there waiting for him, so he wanted to cherish and be fully devoted them only.
Tony subconsciously placed his hands on Steve's shoulder.
Steve felt a sudden pain in his cheeks, Tony had pulled him by the cheeks. "See, you felt that didn't you, it's not dream. So, do you want to be friends with me? " Tony's hand was still waiting in the air.
Now, Steve was 100 percent sure that Tony had been avoiding him. Steve couldn't think of why else Tony would run away from him. Steve gulped, was Tony afraid of him?
Steve walked around until he found the room he was looking for. "Room 6A3." He read out loud.
Bucky and Natasha walked out of the room. The moment Bucky stepped outside of Steve's room. "Steve's got a big crush on Tony Stark!" Bucky shouted and ran off.
Steve reached out his hands out to shake the boy's hand, but the moment their hands touched each other, they both received an electric shot. Tony immediately took his hand away, steve mirrored him.
Steve felt a sudden chill, but in a good way. Tony wrapped his arms around Steve's abs, slightly pressing his body against Steve's back. Steve could feel Tony's warmth, it felt cosy and comfortable. Tony's cologne was sweet-scented and aromatic.
Bucky knew him to well, it was like he could read Steve's mind.
"That would too much trouble for you-"
Steve gently opened his eyes, he saw his mom Sarah Rogers beside him. His face brightened up and a smile formed on his face. "M-mama" He called with cheerful tone in his voice.
He felt an abrupt grip on his hair. The man brushed his lips against Steve's cold lips. The sudden warmth comforted him. Steve was dumfounded, not being able to comprehend a damn thing that just happened. He knew he liked it though.
He put a small amount of the gel on his hand and rubbed it on Tony's ass, slowly inserting his middle finger inside Tony.
Steve sighed in relief.
"Obviously you're handsome and cute. I know you're small and skinny, but trust me when I say puberty is gonna hit you hard. You're gonna turn even more handsome and very manly with so much muscle. Girls are gonna go crazy for you, Steve. " Tony explained, he gave a slight pat on Steve's shoulder, as reassured him with a sweet smile.
"Oh my god, Steve you're actually blushing." The smug on Bucky face grew bigger.
"I'm scared that you'll forget about me, Steve. You're the only friend I've got and I don't want to lose you." Tony admitted with a frown, he slightly averted his eyes away from Steve's.
Steve couldn't believe his ears. Tony actually did care about him, even though they've only just met. Steve felt a great sense of joy after hearing that. The smile on his face grew bigger.
Steve immediately let go of his wrist. He couldn't stand the sight of Tony crying. He had never seen Tony cry before. He hated seeing Tony like this and Steve solely responsible for making Tony like this. It was too painful to watch him in that state.
Natasha chuckled at Tony's reaction. "He's a Tony Stark fanboy" Natasha replied with a smug.
Steve lost focus, for the first time he got distracted in a mission. There was something seriously wrong with him, even Steve didn't know the answers to that.
The man's eyes were shaking, however not in fear though, just anger. "Don't tell me you're with those fucking bastards?" He groaned in frustration.
A single tear ran down his cheeks. "I love you so much, Pepper!" His voice was shaking. "I hope that you don't ever have to experience what you had to go through with me" Tony prayed, as he shut his eyes closed.
Tony wanted to know, why they were acting like this? Why, were they so sure about Steve, even though, they hadn't met him? Tony's mind was full so many questions.
Tony wanted the people he loves to be jubilant, even if it meant risking himself for fighting for their happiness, then so be it.
Steve couldn't do anything but watch, as Tony's body dropped hard to the ground taking the life force out of him. Tony couldn't breathe, he felt a sharp pain across his whole body, it hurt so bad. He couldn't move nor see, all he saw was the darkness that was slowly devouring him bit by bit.
Steve took a step back. His eyes were shaking in fear. The nightmare he tried so hard avoiding ended up coming true.
That's the least he could do, to make up for the loss of time, which he could've had with Tony, his Tony.
Oh how he missed his voice.
Steve sucked his neck hard and bit it, leaving a huge mark on his neck. Steve's blue eyes pierced through Tony's. "Say you love me!" Steve demanded, growling into his ear.
Tony smiled at him. "You would've done the same for me." He stated confidently.
Bucky was there, sitting at the edge of his bed. "Hey, Stevie. How's your hand?" Bucky asked.
Tony burst into laughter. He patted Steve's shoulder. "Oh, Steve you have a great sense of humour. I love it." Tony some how managed to speak without laughing.
A meeting was being held in the S.H.I.E.L.D headquarter, but it was delayed for half an hour. It appears that they were waiting someone important; without them the meeting wouldn't start at all.
"Okay, I get it. Now sit back down and listen to me." Nick told him.
Steve wrapped his arms around the man's waist and pulled himself up. He sat on the cold wet ground with the man sitting on
Tony placed his hand on Bucky's shoulders. "Well, Bucky. I think everyone knows that, except you and Nat." Tony replied, giving Bucky a slight pat at the back.
Steve, barely even managed to stand straight. He was at the edge falling onto the cold concentrate ground, but he felt his body against someone, it felt so warm and comfortable.
How could've Steve completely forgotten that the enemy was right in front of him? He only realized, when the guy tried to stab Steve. But Steve held the knife with his bare hand.
"Stevie! You can't do that, especially without a warning. I seriously thought, someone had possessed you or something" Bucky said, while constantly rubbing his lips with the back of his hand.
One of the fucker hissed and told the others, that the person there looking for wasn't here. Thankfully, they've went away for good this time.
Steve jumped out of bed and searched for the man. He needed Antonio, he was the only person that was able to warm him up.
"Making out with my one-night stand." He replied.
"In a heartbeat" Bucky blurted out.
He gently stroked Tony's hair and placed a peck on his forehead and then down to his cheeks.
The moment he stepped into the house, he knew he fucked up. How could've he been so careless? And yet, somehow, he'd managed to break into the wrong freaking house.
"You actually made our son, laugh. Awww Anthony." Steve's mother hugged Tony.
He walked to Steve's side of the table and sat beside him. "Don't tell me you're a virgin?" Tony playfully whispered into his ear.
He must've left his phone inside his car.
Shit, Steve literally had no idea how to respond to that comment; Tony certainly knew how to make him speechless.
"He’s guy who saved me, Bucky." Steve said softly.
"He couldn't have gotten far, he must be here some where. Find him at once." One of the guy in the group shouted, ordering the others to look for someone.
Now that Tony was in front him, he'll never let him off sight. Steve's eyes met with Tony's, Steve immediately saw his eyes, it was full of fear and trepidation.
A song started to play in the radio, as a deep yet gentle voice began to sing.
Bucky had to admit, there was something about Tony that made him special.
He was so close to Steve, there faces were only inches apart. Steve could smell him, he smelt so fucking good.
As he entered the store, the first he noticed was a 'Captain America and Iron Man' toy. Wow, that was a perfect gift, everyone loves superheroes. But, which one should he get? Tony loved Captain America, but what if the kid doesn't like it? Maybe, the boy likes Iron Man? Or even both. Tony sighed and decided to get both Captain America and Iron Man.
Tony never wanted to owe to anyone for anything, especially not a fucking enemy.
He rubbed Tony's bottom lips with the tip of his thumb and slowly parted his lips.
Steve was panicking in the inside. He hadn't been physically this close to anyone except his parents.
After a few seconds, Steve firmly held a his head with one hand, while the other hand was on his waist. He pressed his lips against Tony's. Steve licked Tony's bottom lips. Just when Steve was about pit his tongue inside his mouth, Tony jerked his face away.
Tony let out a chuckle. "Hell yes! You do have a mirror, right? I mean, have you seen how you look?"
Steve gaped at Bucky. Why did Bucky, all of sudden bring that topic? Why was he so eager to change the topic about Tony? Steve mind was full questions.
The guy wrapped his arms around Steve's neck. "How about tonight, you make me all yours." He suggested, while biting his bottom lips, clearly seducing Steve.
Steve had finally seen the man that he wanted to see for the past five years. Now, he knew who the man truly was. Steve was on cloud nine, he knew the man's name.
"Stevie, listen to me. Falling in love is the most beautiful thing you can experience in life. But don't think just cause it's one sided love, you won't have a chance. You've found your special someone, don't let them go that easily."
"It's okay, Tony." Steve whispered softly and gently rubbed his back, trying his best to calm Tony down.
Steve didn't care about sex, or maybe it was 'cause he couldn't find the right person. Plus, one-night stand wasn't for Steve, he hate the thought of that. He wanted to do it with person he loved and treasure them. Call it old fashion or whatever, Steve couldn't care less.
Steve felt like a stab in the heart, when he saw Tony. His body was shaking in fear. He had a terrified look on his face.
He'd seen this look before, years ago. He knew that look. Oh God! Tony was afraid of him. Steve's eyes widened in shock. No, this was not the time to be panicking, Steve. He pushed his thoughts to the side and focused on Tony.
"I'm afraid, Prince Steven has received a deep shock and is now suffering from amnesia." He informed them the devastating news.
The thought about it, gave Tony a fucked up headache because there were so many blank memories.
When he opened the doors to his chanbers. Steve didn't expect Tony's reaction to be like that.
He slowly parted his lips away. "You're mine, Tony"
"You talking dirty, turns me on, baby." The man smirked.
Steve had missed embracing his father, he missed him very much. Steve couldn't pretend anymore, as he burst into tears. He needed someone's shoulder to cry on. So they'll comfort him and make the pain vanish.
Tony gave him a puzzled look. "Knew what exactly? Actually don't say anything 'cause I've got a feeling that I'm gonna regret it later." He said, while putting his hand in front to emphasise to stop.
Tony wrote down a small message in the card and got out of the car and headed inside the hospital again.
"Ah, I do appreciate the compliment, Stark. Especially, when it's from you." Steve Spoke in a flirtatious way, not that Tony would notice or maybe Steve just sucked at flirting. Not that matters it anway, Steve just wanted to have a friendly conversation with Tony, that's all.
the second Clint disappeared out into the dining room armed with the bayonet fork, the ordered desserts and a smile that was practically a sneer, the little brunette pulled a five gallon bucket of rice over and collapsed right onto the lid, dropping his face into his hands and trying not to
Now dinner was over, milkshakes finished and Peter checked on one last time because it was bath time and Tony needed to know Nat had found the exact right rubber ducky, and Steve’s blue eyes were darkening towards scarlet with every passing moment, Tony tonguing purposefully flirtatiously over the sharp points of his little fangs as his core quivered in response to the hormones pouring off the huge Alpha.
“Omega.” Steve was serious now, sitting up all the way and tipping Tony’s chin so the Omega would look into his eyes and know he meant every word. “This is the money I wanted to give you while we were dating. It’s to make up for all the times you turned down vacations or clothes or gifts, all the times you returned the stuff I bought you to pay for Peter’s clothes, all the times you had to work a double and then came all the way across town to see me. This is for the doctor’s appointments and the medicine and the bus rides before I got you the Uber account and all the groceries you had to count pennies to buy.
“No harm no foul, Excelsior here wouldn’t hurt a fly.” The gentleman was at least a dozen years past ancient, steel frame glasses and silvered hair, a friendly smile and cheerful aura as he brought the huge golden retriever around to heel at his side. “C’mere kiddo, come meet the dog. Pat his head like this, see? Scratch his ears too, he loves that.”
Dishes took far longer than they should have with Steve stopping to kiss Tony and Tony pausing in his drying duties to tease and purr up at the Alpha playfully. It was easy and fun and
I am. Damn, Tony! Where did you even get an idea like that?”
, a measure of gentleness in her hands that felt like a lot of
“Nope.” The Alpha said flatly. “When I was younger I had bad asthma and the cold water made it hard to breathe. Now that I’m big, I just sink to the bottom of the pool or lake like a big ol’ rock. No swimming for me.”
“Steve.” Tony opened the door and stood up on his toes to kiss the Alpha quickly, effectively silencing whatever the blond was going to say. “I’m fine.”
The Omega being shy or-- or for some incredible reason Steve couldn’t fathom maybe Tony was
“Go?” Tony was a little dazed where he sat on the counter with the blond fit between his legs and halfway to rubbing against him. “But um-- you know, the third date? I thought we would-- I mean, you invited me over to your
“Alright.” Clint rolled his eyes as if he wasn’t always endlessly proud of his friend for always putting Pete first. “After all of that, buy yourselves some clothes. Or make him buy you clothes. Alphas love playing dress up with pretty Omegas, throw some booty his way and then tell him to dress the cheeks in lace and satin.”
The note from Steve made Tony laugh until tears ran down his face, then the Omega sat on the bed, clutched up the towels and cried into their downy softness until he was red eyed and hiccuping and embarrassed about his reaction but too overwhelmed to bother caring.
“No, I shan’t.” Steve declared, and Peter punched his little fist in the air and shrieked, “No! I shan’t!”
“Just a little bit.” Finally calm enough to start walking again, Tony wiped at his nose and motioned for Peter so he could hold him. “Thank you, Alpha. For stepping in with my Dad and for being willing to take us on and thank you in future tense for how you’ll have to deal with all the emotions that are guaranteed to come up now that I’ve seen my Dad again.”
“You can borrow a shirt!” Carol lit up with a smile at the chance to help one of her favorite Omegas. “I have a red blouse I wore to an interview still in my car, you want it?”
“...you did.” Steve put his plate aside and pulled the cover off the nearest easel to reveal the painting. “This one is inspired by
ever.” Steve shrugged out of his jacket when he caught Tony shivering, and draped it over the Omega’s thin shoulders. “It won’t be enough money to matter to me, and I’d rather know you’re getting places quickly and safely than wonder if you’re catching taxis or rides from friends or god forbid taking the
take any chances. Safe sex, non knotting sex-- he had to be able to grab his clothes and run if something went wrong and he couldn’t handle it, or if he and Steve really weren’t compatible in bed and the aftermath was awkward, or if Steve tried to settle him, because being settled while knotted was a whole other level of mind numbing and Tony didn’t even want the risk.
delicate to bleed but Steve made him bleed anyway, scratched his fangs across the Omega’s heart until Tony arched into him and cried out for more, dug his nails into Tony’s hips as he helped his little mate shimmy out of the too tight pants and tossed them away, punched out a groan that was damn near a growl when he saw the Omega not even wearing panties. The seam of the tight pants were damp with slick, Tony’s slender length already leaking by the time Steve got his mouth over the sensitive tip and suckled and two fingers between the Omega’s thighs came away

“Sounds like we’ll be there, Omega.”
“Yeah?”

week Steve sat in his loft and drew delicate lines of gold across his canvas, swirling them into petals through the geometric designs he’d scattered on the ivory paper. The corners of the usually harsh shapes were blunted and curved, bright ruby and hot rod red and darkened scarlet all entwined into almost squares and not quite hexagons and nearly triangles, soft edges but steady lines, gorgeous curves and unrelenting purpose.

“We were safe at home.” Tony’s voice was thready, his usual fire dampened by the Command and his eyes still downcast. “We were fine.”
“Steve was actually the one to put the brakes on.” Tony finally got the worst of the milkshake off and moved on to another unfortunately unidentifiable stain. “He wants to wait until we talk through boundaries, which I appreciate seeing as how--” he blew out a short breath. “--I was almost sick to my stomach thinking about attempting sex after the
and the Alpha’s heart thudded out somewhere towards his toes when he saw the baby curled up beneath another worn but neatly mended blanket, rosy cheeks and tousled curls and sucking at his thumb in sleepy obliviousness to the stranger standing over him.
“Then why did you ask about me?” Their milkshakes arrived in to go cups, and Tony took an experimental taste of his before deciding that
“I hear you.” This time Steve actually
“I love you too, Alpha.”
“Wildly awkward.” Steve grinned
“Shouldn’t take me long, I already picked it out.” he bent to rub their noses together. “I’ll go kiss Pete bye and call a car. See you tonight?”
Steve flushed goofy under the pure sunshine of Tony’s smile, and stuttered through an overwhelmed, “Oh n-no sweetheart. This-- this isn’t a birthday present, this is just the stuff we bought last week. I gotta do something else for your birthday.”
“It’s the only way I could be in the running for the trophy for Best Dad!” Steve laughed out loud. “You’ve got everything else covered! Teachin’ Pete a bad word is the only

“I hope you do get used to this.” Steve dug his thumb firmly into the arch of Tony’s bare foot and when the Omega squealed, he soothed it with a kiss to the delicate ankle bone and up Tony’s calf as he lifted one long leg over his shoulders. “And I hope you turn into an absolute brat, I would

“Not hurt.” Peter dimpled a grin at Tony, then promptly tried to fling himself back out of Steve’s arms and into the stuffed animal pile. “Bear!”
“--and snooped around a little and then he came in and saw me--”
The Omega took one of the carts and started back at the beginning of the store, ready to wind his way through each and every aisle and put one of anything and everything he wanted in the basket, trying to distract himself from all the things Steve had said by indulging in the novelty of buying in

and didn’t care. I don’t have anything to prove to him, I don’t have anything to throw in his face. Why would I weaponize my happiness to bother Howard when Howard was never bothered by what he did to me?”
Bucky felt so relieved, as he was in control of his body. Oh how he missed his sense of touch and moving his body freely. This was too good to be true, but the truth was this was real.
The guard had found Steve lying unconscious on the rooftop floor, he carried Steve back to his chamber and placed him on his bed.
Tony gaped at Pepper with a worried expression on his face, as they both felt a sense of 'Déjà vu'.
Ever since that night, Steve only thought of Tony. He wanted to see him. But little did Steve know, he was going to meet him this soon. Out of all time in the world, it had to be during a mission.
Bucky tried pushing Steve away, but Steve's grip was iron hard, after a few seconds Steve slowly parted his lips away from Bucky.
"Shit, I hope you're not involved in anything bad" Tony stated.
Steve's throat felt so dry, his heart was thumping in an odd beat, he had never seen Tony this happy before. As he spent more time with Tony, he'd discovered new things about Tony and is more drawn to him.
Later that night, Steve went to see his mom in the hospital; Sarah was a nurse and had a night shift. Lately he hasn't had the chance to see her, due to the hectic schedule he had. He just couldn't find time to meet his loving mom.
A smirked appeared on Bucky's face as he realized something.
Soon everything was darker then black.
Being a billionaire and a business man meant meeting lot of people in a daily basis. Even if Tony was a genius billionaire, there was no way in hell he'd recognize anyone without Pepper's and J.A.R.V.I.S's help.
Tony Stark was alive, he had to be. He's alive. Steve constantly repeated that in his head.
"Steve, you've met Tony before didn't u?" Natasha asked.
Tony looked up, his eyes grew bigger. He hadn't expected to meet Steve. Well, to be honest Tony didn't think they'd see each other again. But, who knew the world was so small? Here they were standing in front each other, once again.
Steve was mind blown . Tony was a genius. He was so talented.
The blood was dripping down from his hand onto the floor.
"It's finall, Anthony is staying with us. I'm the king, my rules. Plus, the castle is fillied security guards. He'd be much safer here. "
"Why you little-" Steve yelled, while immediately standing up. Just when he was about to run after Bucky, he stopped himself. Steve was way too tired to chase after Bucky. So just this once, he'll let him off.
Steve licked Tony's lips and kissed him passionately. His tongue explored every part of Tony's mouth. He wanted more. But, he could never take advantage of Tony when his vulnerable.
Bucky's body was paralyzed, the enemy had spiked his drink. How was he this careless? No! He didn't want to die. He can't, not yet. He had so much to achieve in life, this just can't be the end.
"God damn it, that's what we're trying to do, Stark." Nick Fury growled. "Just how many times are you gonna risk your life? Believe it or not, but there are hell of a lot of people who care about you, Stark."
A sudden voice spoke. "Anthony Edward Stark, you left me, just so you could secretly meet up with you're boyfriend."
But, seriously when were they gonna ask each other out? The least Tony could do is push them, after all they're just a couple of idiots in love. Tony had to play his part as a cupid.
"Really?" Steve hadn't realize that. Now that Bucky mentioned it, he realized something. His happiness lied in Tony Stark. That's why he'd never felt happiness before, not until he met Tony Stark.
After a minute or two, Tony finally managed to control his laughter. He cleared his throat and patted his cheeks, then taking a deep breath.
"If you say so, then." Bucky muttered to himself.
Tony rolled his eyes, these two were literally giving him a fucked up headache. Why couldn't they just forget about Steve, already.
"Of course, no problemo. Anyway, I'll see you see you soon, take care, Sarah and thank you for everything." Tony smiled and walked out of the room.
Rhodey put the coffee and doughnuts on an empty table. Tony immediately ran toward him and hugged him tight. "My hero! What would I do without you!"
Tony looked at Bucky. “Let’s just say, we're in the same boat" He said with a gentle smile.
Steve bit his lips hard, until blood drew out of his mouth. Tears streamed down his face. "I love you so much, Tony!" Steve shouted, he sank onto his knee, sobbing into his hands. His tears dripped down his fingers into the cold concrete wet floor.
Not once Steve took his eyes off the man. For some weird reasons, he's throat felt awfully dry. He gulped repeatedly and licked his bottom lips.
Steve couldn't believe what he just had heard, the handsome young man first saved him, now this. Steve was extremely grateful to him.
Steve's smile grew bigger. He was happy that Tony was sharing his interests with him. "Hmm! Is that so, what's his name?"
"Why did you run away from me, Boo?" Steve shouted in anger.
Steve let go of his hand so fast, like he had touched something so hot, that his body reacted fast to avoid being burnt.
He heard a familiar voice, Steve knew that voice, that was the voice that kept him awake at night. The voice he wanted to hear for years. No doubt, that it was him. Steve tilted his head up. The moment he'd laid eyes on the man in front, he felt breathless. Tony Stark was there right in front if him.
"I'm afraid so, this is probably the best for Prince Steven. Other then that, his health condition seems to be improving, which is a good thing."
Oh God! He was falling.
"Thank you." Steve took off the gift wraps and opened his present. These were the limited audition of Iron Man and Captain America. Steve wanted these so much, but he just couldn't get his hands on them no matter what. Steve's face lit up, his mouth curved into a bright smile. "How did you know I loved them?"
"Sweetie! You do realize you're blushing like crazy " Pepper stated, while trying to move the cushion away from Tony's face.
He knew those brown eyes and that face very well. There wasn't a day where he didn't think about that day.
"Stop asking, I'm not saying shit." Tony replied with a low growl.
He felt a rash of panic, when he realized someone was at the door and was just about to enter inside. Steve cautiously crept to the kitchen and hid behind the counter.
Tony gently rubbed her back with his hand, trying his best to calm her down. "It's okay, Pepper. I'm right here" He whispered. Tony was at the edge of completely breaking down, he fought the urge of not to end up crying in front Pepper. He wanted Pepper to be happy, he can't let his emotions be in the way, never. He can't be a burden to her, not again or ever.
Steve felt the sudden nervousness built up, Tony laid on the bed with his back against it, the sight of Tony underneath him excited him.
He snapped out of his thoughts and threw a pillow at Bucky, which fell right on his face. "I know my sexuality very well, thank you very much." Steve replied with a fake smile, as he glared at Bucky suspiciously.
"Stark is too God damn stubborn, Romanoff. He's selflessness is what's going to kill him and knowing that I can't just stand there doing nothing." Steve overheard Nick talking to Natasha, while he walking out of the room.
Bucky was overwhelmed with felicity. "I love her." As those words passed through his parted lips. Bucky couldn't even believe that those words had came out of his own mouth.
All he ever wanted was to be normal. But little did he know that was impossible for him.
But, tonight he was free. So, there he was in the hospital. He asked the receptionist of where his mom was, the lady replied with a door number. Steve quickly thanked her and walked to the elevator.
Tony was stunned by the motorcycle. "Woah! That's the limited edition motorcycle, I can't believe you got that in your hands before me. I must say, I'm very impressed Steve Rogers." Tony commented with a smirk.
Oh God! He was mad at him. Steve felt the need to explain everything to Tony, so there would be no place for misunderstanding. Steve didn't want to start in bad terms with Tony.
"Someone, you trust. Well if it that's the case why doesn't Anthony stay with us for 2 weeks and then when you pick him up, we can see each other again."
"Stevie, are you perhaps in love with Stark?"
A soft moan past through his parted lips, it had felt so fucking good.
Tony turned to Steve's parents and thanked them politely for having him. He then walked in front of Steve.
The good looking guy sighed in relief. "Thank God! I seriously didn't wanna fight against you. So, can you loosen the grip a little. It's a bit awkward being in this position, especially as a guy. If you know what I mean." He tried moving but it was no use.
Natasha glared at Tony, he's smile grew bigger.
Tony's voice was a medley to Steve's ears. Something about Tony made him let his guard down. Steve felt safe next Tony, he felt comfortable. Even though, Tony and him barely even had a conversation together. Then why was it that Steve felt this way about Tony?
"Captain America, you know the comic. To be honest, I still like him even now. I can give you a whole speech on to why I love him, but I won't 'cause I know you'd get bored." Tony's eyes sparkled, as a smile formed on his face.
Tony pulled Steve into a hug, "goodbye, Steve."
Steve mentally panicked, not knowing how he should fix this. Without even thinking Steve shouted out "Stark"
"Tony knew I always wanted a kid and he knew that if I stayed with him I would never have that. He said there was someone out there who would love me then him. I believed that utterly nonsense, not even for a second. I left so I could give him time to think through." Steve explained, his voice sounded so broken.
A sudden voice spoke, Steve knew that voice. Anyone could recognize that voice. He looked up and saw those familiar pair of brown eyes. His heart began to pound faster, which seemed to be a habit of Steve's. Even now, Steve wasn't used to it. It was as if he's heart was only beating because of Tony, which was metaphorically and literally true.
After Bruce stitched Steve's cut and bandaging it.
"Why can't you just stay in the palace with me, you can also be home schooled with me."  Steve tried his best to somehow convince Tony to stay. Judging by Tony's expression Steve already knew the answers to it and he didn't like it.
