"Ta-da!" His husband said triumphantly and sauntered inside while holding out some kind of device.
"What news of Midgard?" He asked.
Crisis averted. For now.
The strawberry blonde woman watched the tiny Trickster play. Making up her mind. She would find the best gift to give her "nephew", because she could.
He didn't get an answer but the former sergeant seemed much more relaxed.
"We didn't order anything?" Steve said, frowning.
"I could teach him", Thor said. Thinking it was a chance to form a relationship with his brother again.
"If you go near him again, I will fly you to an active volcano and drop you inside", he said in a low voice filled with menace. He gave one last punch before he walked off. Wanting to cool off before returning to his family.
"I don't like the idea anymore than you do", Steve said. "But if he can touch it without being harmed... it might be our only option."
"I can't blame you. I have no idea how Hulk would react to this Loki."
It had been a while since he was down in the workshop. His bots had kept the dust down but there were projects he had forgotten about that was half finished.
"I don't think that would solve anything", Steve said, placing an arm around his shoulders. They were watching the news, Loki was playing in his room. "Isn't it better to just get it over with?"
No one reacted when Thor returned after just a short stay on Midgard. They probably thought it was natural, considering how short mortal lives were. For a while after returning he tried asking the seidr users about spells regarding age regression or reversing death. But they all gave him the same answer:
Meaning the boy was very intelligent.
"Yes!"
"Hey!" Barton protested. Both Natasha and Bruce was looking at him. One unreadable and one in shock.
"You will get wrinkles if you keep that up." Standing the engineer stretched, feeling his joints soften a bit. "Thanks, Steve. I needed to hear that. And just so you know, you are more than an experiment from a bottle. We wouldn't be able to win without you either."
There were no escaping it since they had already been caught on camera. The picture was
"You taste like coffee", he said and kissed him again.
There was a delicious smell as they stepped out of the elevator. Loki immediately rushed out, looking around in curiosity. Steve smiled and followed him. Banner had cooked dinner for all of them, wanting them all to get along better. Natasha shook her head as she watched the tiny god darted about.
His mother rarely left her chambers these days. When  she did she would break down in tears. Cursing everyone and everything. Still, Thor knew she would be the one with answers. Knocking on her door he waited for permission before entering.
kid!"
"I'm sorry, it will be just the two of us for a while. But Papa will call and talk to us."
like that.
"Why not? You love pancakes."
"The very same. He were also Thor's brother through adoption. We found him several months ago and is keeping his identity under wraps."
"Good morning!" He said loudly. Now awake and sitting up the blond didn't look too good. "You okay?"
"Hi, Tony Stark", the billionaire said, holding out a hand.
"Titta! Titta ågel! Den fygej! Oj!" The boy chattered, laughing at the pigeons outside the window. After a while Loki started kneading his eyes. Maybe he was tired? The soldier was pretty sure small children needed naps. Since Tony wasn't done yet, he took the boy to their bedroom for now. There he took off the small shoes and tucked the kid into the bed. As he turned to leave, Loki let out a loud whine. Reaching out to him. Petting the black hair Steve moved to leave again. This time the whine got louder and he was barely out the door when the tiny god started crying. Arms held out towards him as the toddler tried to climb across the bed.
"Yes, he is", the soldier smiled. "I'm sorry for causing you distress. If there had been any other option..."
"Tony? What happened? I heard you screaming."
"Is that a Loki doll?" Romanoff asked in surprise.
Unlike the predictions, the penthouse wasn't destroyed. Even if there were signs of the two kids having causing a small hurricane. Leaving things were they were not supposed to be.
"Oh, you know. Doing some work, reassuring you friend, and signing some documents. All that stuff."
"Why are you holding a kid?" A very filthy child was nestled in the blond's arms and Steve looked apologetic.
"Thank you", Steve said and picked up the smaller watch. Putting it on the engineer's wrist. Swallowing he took the other watch and placed it on his husband's -
"Thanks", came the dry reply. The engineer made his way to the elevator and headed to the penthouse. In all the excitement he had missed lunch so he made himself a quick sandwich. Outside the afternoon was fading into early evening.
"His name is William", he said at last. "He is studying engineering and is taking some art classes at my school to improve. We have only talked a few times. And considering the way he chases after the girls, I think it is pretty clear what he prefers. And again, it is illegal."
He was happier than he had been in his whole life. Holding a sleeping Tony Steve was feeling like crying because he was so happy. The brunet might not be quite there yet in terms of feelings, but he seemed like he wanted to get there. Without judgement, without questions, he had accepted the soldier.
Kissing his amazing husband the blond wished there were more words to express how much he loved this man.
"We know", the engineer said. "As you can see, we are just about ready." It was the perfect opportunity, every other Avenger was out and wouldn't return for a week. Including Bruce.
"It has to be something, coming all the way here."
"This is our son, Loki", the engineer said without missing a beat. "And anyone who try to hurt him any way better say their prayers. Because we won't let anything happen to him."
"There you have it."
"Unca Buck!" The boy said loudly and launched himself on the man with the metal arm. "Play with me?"
"Nothing!" Barton said. "He is just being a brat!"
Bowing Thor headed out to the Bifrost. Choosing to walk rather than using Mjolnir or a horse. There he approached Heimdall.
"Thanks."
"Got it."
Thor furrowed his brow and sadness crossed his face. "A year ago, my brother was brought before our father to receive his punishment. As was costumary the executioner was present. Odin, the king of Asgard, demanded answers from Loki but rather than answering he made mockery of our father." The god took a deep breath. "Without warning, the executioner rushed forward, angered by Loki's irreverence, and... beheaded him."
In spite of his temporary orange hair, Barnes settled in fairly easy. Which was mostly thanks to Loki, who pestered the guy constantly. Tony thought it was quite funny, though he was well aware that he was being avoided. Even during meals the former sergeant refused to meet his eyes and barely spoke one word to him. Unfortunately, that meant he didn't really speak to Steve either.
Once his now ex-girlfriend had stormed off he collapsed over his desk. Head in his arms, trying to feel anything. Why did he always have to mess everything up? He wasn't sure how long he stayed like that but suddenly he felt a warm hand on his shoulder. Making him jump.
"Say, would you mind taking Lo for some lunch? My treat. Steve and I have some things to talk about."
"I think he deserves to be the center of his parents' attention. Without having any competition for it. I'm Steve and Tony are thinking something similar."
"Good", Stark handed him a one hundred dollar bill. Which was way too much for a lunch. "You can get some dessert too, if you want."
"I will survive", the engineer said dryly. "My reputation isn't all that good already so it isn't a stretch. It is our best bet right now."
"And the Captain allows you to do that?!"
"Did you want something?"
Letting their son expell pent-up energy every once in a while might do some wonder on his penchant for mischief. Not a whole lot, but a bit. It was unrealistic to expect him to be something other than the god of mischief. So they could only temper it a bit.
Ross wants him to interrogate the captured ones of Steve's team tomorrow, and he's dreading it and eager for it at the same time. On one hand, they used to be his friends (except for the new guy), but on the other, they almost
Maw bows deeply once more. "But of course, my lord." He then floats away to inform the aforementioned crew.
"OH MY GOD! You did NOT just go there! Oh god, I fucking love you!" Tony wiped the tears from his eyes as he wrapped an arm around Steve's waist. "But seriously though, my favorite book is Dead Beat. Why? Dinosaurs, man. Fucking dinosaurs. He literally managed to reanimate a FUCKING TYRANNOSAURUS REX AND RODE HER TO GLORY." Tony sighs and looks dreamily at nothing. "I wish I could do that. All I can do, is make a very life like robot. Hmm, you know what? I might just do that when we get out of this hell hole."
too much chemistry to keep on denying it. They're gone for the other, they just don't know how to show it."
"Brother! Surly not-!" Thor looked like he was about to hurl. Loki only looked at him. "Damn."
you." Tony feels as if he's about to barf again.
He knew that the god had known that he was there.
Because I'm a
Find.
"-ony! Tony!" Tony blinked and looked at the captain. His hair was mussed to the side and he was wearing Tony's boxers.
Tony grunts and squints at the tv as if he was just now noticing the static. "The hell?-" Then in sudden clarity, his eyes widened, recognizing the harrowing signs of
His pet.
It was held at an art museum. It was just opening and they were celebrating the little push that Stark Industries gave it to become successful. Of course, they don't tell the public that.
He feels as if he's at the bottom of a large lake. Being drowned by the heavy blackness as it tried to drag him downward once more.
And he wants to.
Slender leans in close. "
Was it just Tony, or was there someone beating on a drum not too far from here?
Natasha seemed to be up already and was starting to walk toward a tree were Coulson was already climbing to reach something draped over it's branches. Heh... it was Clint. Thor was sitting against a tree with an unconscious Loki in his arms trying to wake him gently. That still blew his mind a bit. What happened to him? Why was he here? He'll figure it out later. Bruce was sitting crossed legged with his fingers pressed to his temples. His skin was a little green, but it was slowly receding. Steve was just now getting up about a foot away.
Tony Stark has been tortured before,
What really broke them however, was when the government called Bucky in for questioning for all of the things that he had done as the winter soldier when the Accords were finalized. Steve blew up when Tony had agreed and didn't stick around to hear that he was only going to let them question him, not take him in. And when Tony tried to talk it out with Steve and his team, they thought that he was trying to take Bucky by force and began fighting. Tony wasn't really trying to win, but he totally have up the fight when Rhodey got accidentally shot down by Vision. That was the one thing that Tony couldn't forgive, couldn't move on from.
That pisses Steve off. "Leave us alone first!" He yells back at Slender as he slowly advances behind them.
Tony felt shaken up and guilty. Bruce was standing
"Just get yourself checked, and then we'll go home. Deal?" It was Steve's turn to raise an eyebrow.
Coulson sighed again. "Again, you know I can't leave Clint unattended. You know how often he likes to stray from the group. I have to be there to look after the idiot."
Tony snorts. "Well, obviously. Being the Slenderman must be pretty lonely. And he must have something tall enough to satisfy that tall fucker." Then he stops and shakes his head quickly. "Ugh, lets just take the note and keep on going before I barf."
His team.
" Tony was shaking from head to toe. But before he could even think to reply, he heard Pepper calling from down the hall, back toward the gala. The engineer panicked and looked back to the statue that was holding him captive. But only it wasn't anymore. The statue was of a normal man reaching out again. The picture was back to normal as well. All of the cracks, blood and pus was gone too. The champagne glass shards were still missing.
[TBC...]
This seemed to be the last straw for Clint, because after a muttered, 'Oh yes I can, just watch me you faceless fuck!' and took off running off of the dirt path and into the dark trees to the left.
"What?" Tony sticks out his tongue, trying to see whatever it was. All he could see was a bit of black and that was it. "What is it?" He asks worryingly. Nat walks up this time and hands him a compact mirror. Tony clicks it open and sticks his tongue out again. This time he can see the whole thing. It looked like a black circle with an 'X' in the middle of it. He frowns in confusion. "But what does it mean?"
Thor beams down at him and continues on.
, my Lord..."
all of the damn time..."
After the initial discovery of the bruises, Tony slowly sunk down to the floor and started to hyperventilate. How could that monster reach him through his dreams now!? Sure, he's a supernatural being, but his dreams should be his own! He already has a hard time sleeping because of the nightmares of Afghanistan and the Chitauri attack, then new ones from that fucked up vision that Wanda had shown him when she wasn't on their side yet.
Loki hadn't woken up yet and was draped over Thor's shoulder as Thor nodded. While Natasha and Coulson just stayed silent.
She almost found out his weakness...
After Clint had showed them the note, the drumming had started and hadn't stopped as of yet.
Thor's voice boomed as he answered. "We have something similar to what you all call 'haunted houses' in Asgard. I shall attend!"
"Well, why don't I take a look at-"
"Tony-" Steve started.
Clint was the first to speak up. "W-what are we going to do now!? Bruce is gone and that pale fucker is getting closer to us as we speak!"
Tony sighed and dragged his hands through his hair. "Alright, alright already! Look, let's just keep it so that we can analyze it later, hm?"
Everyone pales.
He can't
Bruce was gone.
Alright, so this isn't mine, all rights are reserved to valuneird on deviantart who drew this. I just saw this on Google and thought that it best captured what I was trying to convey! http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2013/039/7/a/slenderman_by_valuneird-d5u95sy.png
Sorry about the long ass wait! This was on a semi permanent hiatus but your sugary sweet comments pushed me to continue! So here is the next chapter!
Steve, still holding onto Tony securely, explains. "When you collapsed, Thor an I attacked while Loki went to find the others. When he did, Natasha told him that monster's weakness. His tentacles. So, Loki then wrapped all of the pages around one of his daggers and hacked them off when the others knocked him down for a moment. Afterwards, we tried to wake you up, but you wouldn't." Steve looks as if he was about to start crying again, so Tony kisses him softly.
Just.
Slenderman hisses in glee and leaps over the couch to land on top of Tony, holding him still. Tony's inebriated mind thinks that it's a swell time to try and reason with the haunting creature. "L-look, You've been stalking me for months now! What do you want from me!?"
Steve pulled Tony closer before speaking. "Well, at least we found another page." No one seemed too excited to hear the news.
Tony didn't want this...
Left all alone on his little shelf of loneliness.
Steve Rogers was a launderer.
Slenderman slowly tilts his head as he observes his pet and whats left of his little 'friends' as they flee the building. Time to give chase.
But he was growing bored with all of the same thing, again, and again.
But also dangerous...
He looked around, wondering where the hell they were. They were in a clearing in a forest, and there seemed to be a chain link fence behind him. There seemed to be a tree that was larger than the rest. It had no leaves and there seemed to be something like a piece of paper stuck to the trunk. It was twilight now, the sky was starry and dark with a bloody tinge to it. Geez, was it just him, or did Halloween make everything creepy as fuck?
"Brother, you must not move so much. Let me carry you until you are healed enough, alright?" Thor gave him the puppy dog eyes.
When he shakily exited his bedroom, he saw his four best friends gathered around his living room, discussing his rescue and possible places that he might be. Well, luckily for them, he was returned rather quickly. (Unbeknownst to him, he had been missing for three months. Even though it felt like years...) "H-hey everyone..."
They had been walking around for about twenty minutes when they stumbled upon what looked like a bath house. It was brick with no doors.
He vomits over the side of the bed.
Steve blinks up at the furry red animal. "What do you mean, '
One of them was a bit creepy though. It was a painting of a clearing that was slightly all to familiar. Tony stopped and leaned in to get a closer look, and severely wished he hadn't. It was almost exactly how he remembered it. Dark blood red sky, and gnarled trees that looked as if they would get up and chase you if you didn't keep an eye on them. There was something else, there, right it the middle of the woods and peeking from behind a tree, was Slenderman.
Tony walked up to the truck and tried to hot wire it.
Everyone was excited about the vacation. It only took an hour to get everything packed. It was around midafternoon when they boarded one of Tony's private jets. It was a peaceful flight until something happened. Everyone was making pleasant small talk, when Loki, looking burnt and still smoking with daggers lodged in him, landed right in the middle of the jet out of nowhere.
"But that won't be a problem once you have the stones, yes?" Maw grins nastily.
Not five feet from him lies the still body of Slenderman.
Steve kept his face blank. "No, my Lord-"
from the trees above, making the fox zipping right back into the basket. "...For NOW!!!"
Damn.
Tony started to send smug looks at Steve. And Steve was scowling back in return. Bruce and Coulson were the only ones who havn't said anything now. Tony looked at them expectantly. More so at Bruce. "Well? You guys comeing or what?"
Where is he? Tony opens his eyes to blackness. He tiredly brings up his hands in order to rub at his face, removing thick cobwebs from his face, shuddering as he starts to remember just what happened before he went unconcious from the pain.
I'll have you back so~on...
AHA HA HA HA HA!!!
And now, here he sits, depressed, pissed off, and drunker then he's ever been. And that's saying something.
It's true.
For some reason, he just couldn't bring himself to tell Steve about the nightmare.
After everyone decided to check the jet for any remaining supplies before heading out and trying to find a gate out (The fence was electric. In order for Tony to disable it, he would have to find the fuse box. Until then, they would have to find a gate out. Sadly the place seemed pretty big.) of this godforsaken place. When they got there and had started taking out water, food, and everyone's bags, (That they could find or that weren't destroyed in the crash.) Tony had found his suitcase. It was sliced in half from a cave in on the ceiling of the jet. It was totally worthless now. Hopefully JARVIS knew that the suit had been destroyed and was sending a new one with backup. That was only speculation that JARVIS could even feel the signal from the suit anymore though.
Slender watched the curious creatures from afar. Not yet to be seen.
Tony screams, but no one can hear him.
Just like he had imagined all those years ago.
You'll be my favorite, don't you worry...
Fire.
The small creature looks back down at him, just as bewildered. "Well, I couldn't think of any
The next morning, Tony rounded up all of the Avengers via JARVIS and settled them in the living room.
...Right?
It had been three years after the 'Slender Woods' incident, and boy did a lot of shit happen!
They want him to fall into their embrace and never leave them again.
He can't move.
[Tony's POV:]
Coulson held Clint close, which he rarely does in public, but these were drastic times. "I've read a file on this type of situation with this 'Slenderman' before in Fury's office. The logical thing to do now, is to collect all of these pages and see if that opens the gate from where we started. Once we get out, we find Bruce and get the fuck out of Dodge."
Steve still looked a bit skeptical, but nodded anyway. It was too early to get into an argument. He turned around and laid back down as Tony got up and went to the bathroom. He turned on the faucet and splashed some water on his face. As he was shaking the water off of his hands, he felt a sudden throbbing on his biceps.
Tony was more paranoid than ever.
Tony woke up with a scream on him lips.
They kept on walking and soon ending up in a room with another chair in it. When they got close to the chair, there was another page on the seat that read,
As if Steve could hear his thoughts, he wound an arm around his waist, squeezing him tightly.
Tony sighed and rubbed a hand across his forehead. "Look, I'm sorry. I'm tired and the nightmare shook me up a bit. I'll go and walk it off and then I'll come back."
The fox turns a bit sheepish before getting a rightfully grateful look on his face. "Sorry- I'm just
Slenderman was going to take them all, unless they found a way to get out.
Fury was just filing some papers when Hill had ran in. "What happened?"
"You've seen it haven't you?" Loki looked at him as if in wonder. "No one had ever lived to tell the tale of the Slenderman without dieing soon after. I wonder why, why he spared you. Because that's the only option. No one escapes the Slenderman without him wanting you to." Loki shook his head and took on a distant look. "It is said that Thanos had made him, but that is not the case. He has existed far longer than even the Allfather. Thanos had only woken him up."
Tony wakes up to pain.
"Good. I'll see you in Medical."
He never expected HIM to be standing there.
He was constantly checking for a white shadow behind him at every turn...
. I'm a
!" There was a sudden
They and nod and start to head out but Thor stops and looks around. "Stop. Where is Banner?" They all stop and start looking around too. A very cold and terrifying realization hits them all at the same time like a ton of bricks.
Steve grabbed Tony close to him as he yelled. "Hold on everyone! We're going down!" Thor grabbed ahold of Loki as everyone else held on to something.
"You..." the usually collected woman said.  "You two... you are... are you
So, perhaps it wasn't surprising that he had found himself drawn to a new person. A different person. It was just a slightly unexpected person, considering how their initial meeting went. But there was no denying that Tony Stark was intelligent, confident, and just the right amount of mischievous to stir something in Steve. He was also quite handsome, in a rugged sort of way. Not that the blond would even dream of making a move on the man. Some research had taught him same-sex relationships were no longer illegal, but that didn't mean Mr. Playboy billionaire had any kind of interest in men.
"You are not actually thinking of having our kid move that thing, are you?"
"Not super big, just a few dozen acres."
"I see..." the two Avengers waved goodbye and left. Loki grabbed Wilson's hand and dragged them to his stash of toys. There were fewer of them than she had expected. Considering Tony's usual spending habits. Babbling the boy showed off his toys happily.
"No, no. Nothing. I need to go have a chatt with Bruce. Feel free to use the shower."
"He was pretty quick to pick a fight at first too", Steve said. "But no one is born evil. I, at least, refuse to believe so."
"Just keep him occupied. I think there are some toys for him. I call you when it is done."
"What about you, Cap?" She asked. "I don't think Banner or Clint would be a good match for a roommate. More than we already are."
Still holding the broken toy Tony took the elevator down to the common floor. Just like he had predicted, the culprit was acting like nothing. Flipping with his phone. Still filled with rage the engineer walked up to him, ripped the phone out of his hands and threw it into the wall.
"What do you think I've been doing the last twenty minutes? Rolled my thumbs? Don't keep me waiting, Rogers. Just go for it."
"How comes he can suddenly speak English?"
"...at least Tony is still Tony..."
"Tony..." Steve said, not knowing what he could possibly say in this situation.
"Then maybe we can take some time for ourselves? Having some... fun?"
"I was bored and wanted to play with uncle Bucky... but he wasn't home. JARVIS said I could go to the common floor..."
The engineer sauntered off with the god on his arms, talking with the child. Shaking his head, Bruce tried to wrap his head around everything. Realising he still held the wet towel.
"Papa! Daddy!" Loki jumped into their laps, giggling. While communication was still an issue, the boy had managed to learn what to call them. "Ja blev blå!"
Leaving the floor they returned to the bar. The bartender poured them a drink each.
"He can't keep walking on eggshells around me. So, I let him know we are good."
"No, seriously. Do I have good timing or bad timing? It is hard to tell." Sam was standing by the elevator, big grin on his face. "You two are so lovey-dovey it is almost embarrassing. How come no one has found out yet?"
, JARVIS said. Making both Steve and Tony look up from the papers they were discussing.
"They are not related in any way. The lady in the yellow dress?"
"They are books on magic, Loki was always a natural born sorcerer but last time he had our mother to teach him. I thought they could help him learn how to use his powers."
"Did you ask JARVIS to order you something?"
By the table, the small Trickster was screaming and crying. Calling for his parents. The situation was not helped by the fact that Thor was yelling at him while still trying to force the rejected food on the child. Just as the two intended to intervene, the elevator doors opened.
"Uncle Bruce is sleeping. He wouldn't wake up and Daddy said to not make him angry."
"Seriously?" Tony looked incredulous. "That's the kind of stories you have told our kid? I know my Norse Mythology, you know. I know what happened to your brother at the end of that story."
"Er... technically, we
"Hydra probably thought I was the bad guy..." the soldier looked at the tiny Trickster. Adult Loki had been angry and bitter when they met him. Full of arrogance, sure, but some people used arrogance to hide their pain and insecurities. Standing up he walked over to the boy, to his
"Huh... it got really busy when Loki arrived but I didn't realise just how much if affected me."
"Er..." Banner said. "The dinner is ready but..."
She took it and looked it over. "Yes, I remember this one. He was quite excited about it, but it turned out to be an extremely complex spell. Just meeting the necessary conditions is neigh impossible. And that's if you managed to cast it correctly in the first place."
The kids, Lila and Cooper, was excited the whole car ride and even manage to make Loki open up a bit. By the time they had arrived, they had agreed to play together in the penthouse. With Bucky agreeing to watch them. He too seemed to sense the engineer's dark mood. Understanding it was better to keep out of the way.
"And?"
At her insistence, Happy was also informed of the situation. His reaction was quite funny. First he gave a look that said "
"You spoil him too much."
"I'm hearing several icky things there that you will tell me more about later. You are using two different words. Frost Giants and Jotun. Which is it?"
Those words didn't make much sense to the kid. He tried to take a few steps back. Intending to return to his parents. Boredom was better than this.
"Our son is blue", the brunet said, sounding distant. Frowning the soldier looked down. Just as the other had said, sitting in the engineer's lap was Loki. Who was an azure blue and had red eyes. Seemingly uncaring about the cold. "He touched it, I pulled him away. Then he was blue. Have I broken our kid?"
"We ran into each other at the park. Mr. Stark was kind enough to invite me. You must be Doctor Banner, and you have to be Thor. I have to say Mr. Stark..."
And okay, he most definitely did want to have sex with a certain soldier again. Because that had been great. As if summoned by his thoughts Steve stepped out of the elevator.
"A blizzard? Like a snow storm?" The engineer said. "Wait, why is he on the common floor in the first place?"
Hurrying forward the soldier caught him before he tumbled to the floor. Still crying Loki had his shirt in an iron grip. At a loss for what to do, the blond simply got in bed together with the boy. Letting him rest on his chest. Slowly the tears dried up and the small body became limp. Unable to make himself move and risk waking the child, Steve settled and let his thoughts wander.
An equally tired Sam joined him. They watched as Thor found a bowl, filled it with some cheerios knockoff, added milk, and then gave the bowl and spoon to his once-brother. Who eyed the bowl with disgust, pushing it away from him.
The feed cut off. Counting today that would leave him with only five days with Tony and Loki while having no idea when he could come home.
"Morning", the brunet greeted. Still confused the former asset shook his head. Trying to understand what was going on.
"More of less."
Rising from his brother's grave, Thor brushed away some dirt. For all that he called it a grave, it was empty. Loki hadn't been awarded with a send-off, nor given a proper burial. Instead his body had been thrown off the edge of the world. The fate of criminals. This grave was one the Thunderer had built himself. It was just stones placed in a small pyramid hidden in the forest.
"Well, it is the same for me! If you are happy, then I'm happy. You don't have to constantly adjust to what I want. You can do what you want too."
"Hey, Tony", his former girlfriend said.
"You can't blame him, Thunder Pants", Stark said. "Last time he saw you, you were yelling at him. As did you the first time you saw him. No likes being around someone they think is scary."
"Was taught how to read these symbols. Right?"
"He is too short, he wouldn't be able to reach. I don't think he needs a high chair but something a bit more suitable."
"What is it, Loki?"
"Good thing I've finished everything then. Let's wake up Mischief and then have a look."
"Just a question, Pikachu", Tony said, barely keeping his temper. "Did Loki know this?"
"Oh, buddy..." Steve said and consoled the crying toddler. Leaving their son to his husband Tony looked over the toy.
When put that way... sighing the god of thunder realised they had a point. He had never been known for his patience. It was also unlikely Loki would feel comfortable with him. Considering the fearful glances he got.
"Your floor is fully renovated by now, Aragorn", the engineer said. "Why don't you take a look when you come back and have JARVIS order furniture."
Thor looked at them with some confusion, not seeming to grasp what they were saying. As such, he decided it didn't matter.
"Kid can make his own snow day some day..." he mumbled. "Hey kiddo. What's wrong?"
"Is dead", Stark said flatly. "This is our son. He is not your brother. I don't care how you and old Loki were raised. But obviously he wasn't very happy. I also don't buy that your dad had nothing to do with Reindeer Games death."
"He is that, isn't he", Tony chuckled wetly. "He certainly crawled his way into our hearts effortlessly."
"Why?" Tony asked. "He is being a kid, kids are curious. It is not like he is causing trouble."
"What do you want me to say?" The engineer grumbled. "I can't quit being Iron Man right now."
Feeling a headache coming he decided to just accept it at face value. There was too much otherwise. "You said you could explain?"
The small god giggled and then ran off. It wasn't until the former soldier stood and saw himself in the mirror that he understood why. His hair, for some unexplainable reasons, had turned bright orange.
"What happened, buddy?"
Things calmed down considerably after a while. Once the initial shock wore off, Steve and Tony received a lot of support from around the world. Meaning they could go on with their lives undisturbed. That year's Christmas was a far cry from the year before. Loki was naturally the center of attention.
"Alright, my turn. You already know I have a wild past. That can't be helped but... every other time I had been with a man, it had been... unpleasant. So during our first time, it was also the first time I was treated so gently. So carefully. That goes for both men and women. Even with the drug lowering your inhibitions, you were still gentle."
Steve nodded, tears in his eyes. "I don't know how but... Tony, what if it was him? Who killed your parents? I..."
"And if he is mean again, you can bury him in snow for a few minutes. I give permission. But no more revenge for now."
"What kinds of problems?"
Nodding the blond walked off with the kid. Scratching his beard the engineer thought for a second. "JARVIS? Order a few things a kid might need and search through police databases to see if there is a kid missing that matches the description of maybe-Loki."
Since there was nothing for it, the tiny god got back into the elevator. The common floor wasn't very exciting since there were no toys but sometimes there was someone to play with.
"Our son", the other guy said. "He was the one that fetched you."
"Fuck", the archer grumbled. "Stark got some mean swings."
"Hey, yesterday when that gas container leaked, where you near it?"
"Loki..." he wanted to cry. Especially when his son began to cry as the reality of things finally seemed to have seeped in. Steve was fine. He would spend some time in Washington, do some missions, and then he would come home to them. Heck, maybe he would even find a new friend. Pepper could use an alternative for babysitting too.
"Tack så mycket!"
have a 'hole there to use' as you put it. You probably even know which one I'm talking about."
"Uncle Bruce?" The kid's speech had started to lose its more childish quality, no longer garbling words.
"There, buddy", the Captain said. "Is that better?"
"Oh, you know. Ciziten concern and all that."
Thor watched as the god of mischief sprinted away to the elevator. Still at loss for what was going on. Not to mention, Loki had still been blue. Meaning it was the first time he had seen the Trickster in his Jotun skin.
The two spies slash assassins walked off while bickering. Steve looked at his drawing. He'd rather just have any answer, good or bad, than none at all.
Then a small body ran into her. Startled she turned around and saw a small boy, maybe four years old. Sitting on the ground he was bawling. Had he gotten lost from his parents? It was far to the ground but she managed anyway.
"Nah, give Steve a heads up that I will be in the workshop."
"That almost make it sound like you would have to be killed because of misery brought upon you..."
"Well... no..."
, Steve said through the device.
"Sure, we can talk about it another time. You know, I was wondering why you was allowed inside. This explains it."
"You are not making any friends?" Tony said, Loki on his lap.
"You need to take care as well. I love you, Steve."
"Sounds good. I will take one with ham and onions. Any idea of what might suit Loki?"
"Bucky... I... can I come in?" He said. Backing away without a word the Winter Soldier didn't take his eyes off the man. "Do you know who I am?"
"Er..."
"Why bother drawing me when I'm right here?" The brunet teased. "You can just look at the real deal."
"I know", the engineer took his hand. "I also know it was Hydra. That he was hurt."
(See the end of the chapter for
"Got it, don't forget to eat lunch."
Tony used some kind of liquid to quell the gas. They then managed to finish the job without further incident.
"How long?"
"Really? How does that work?" Cooper asked. "Our mom has a baby in her tummy, you know. Can men also have babies in their tummies?"
"I... I just did what I wanted to do. And I do hope you haven't felt discomfort since..." the soldier looked concerned. That worried little frown of his. The engineer reached up and gently massaged it.
"Absolutely", the soldier carefully pushed inside. Going slow. He could never get tired of this. Of holding the man he loved in his arms, making him feel good.
Smiling a bit too sharp, Stark waved Steve onto the stage. The soldier wasn't wearing his uniform. "First off, yes I and
And now, that very same toy was broken. Its head separated from its body. For all his mischief, the tiny Trickster was actually rather careful with his toys and took care to not damage them. So it was very unlikely he was responsible for the state of the action figure.
"Didn't think so", the strawberry blonde woman shook her head and then actually smiled. "Tony, I'm happy for you two but as always, you don't think things through."
"Papa?" Tony's heart almost broke when he heard Loki's voice. The small boy ran up to the elevator doors. Watching them with anticipation. And then confusion. He knocked on them, sat down, and waited.
Steve hugged him closer, placing kisses all over his face. Lingering. "I am", he said. "I am."
"I believe there is a lot they can teach me even so."
"I don't mind."
"Let's see what he wants first", Steve said. "It might be that he has some answers for us."
Really, the past didn't matter. He loved that boy in a way he had never loved before. Losing Steve would be devastating, but losing Loki would break him completely.
Once again bundled from top to toe, Tony stood in his workshop. Unhappily watching as his husband instructed the tiny Trickster on what to do. Loki listened and then went up to the device. Without any hesitation, and with way more strength than normal for a toddler, he lifted the device into the containment chamber. Even properly closing the door. Then he returned to the two of them with a big smile.
"We were actually already together by then", Steve said.
Watching Loki could be a handful on its own. Adding two more kids made it into a complete circus. Bucky watched as the older two kids went crazy, seeing the penthouse. Running around while shrieking excitedly. His super soldier hearing didn't quite agree with their loud voices.
"Look at it from the bright side", Romanoff said. "You won't have to bunk with Stark anymore. That should be quite the relief, I imagine."
A light kick to his stomach made the engineer wake up. His son had some pretty funny sleeping postures sometimes. Even if it meant he accidentally kicked or punched his parents in his sleep. Yawning Tony looked at the alarm clock. 6 a.m. Way too early. Not even Steve was up yet, and he liked to exercise early in the morning.
"Apparently Natasha is going too. I'm guessing they want us to do missions together", Steve looked so defeated. "I was finally happy..."
"That's okay. I'm just so happy to be with you again. Going on a date like this was a great idea." Holding the other close the soldier settled. They had gone to a pretty high end hotel that boasted about its discretion regarding its guests. The room was large and comfortable. There they had eaten a three course dinner and even danced a bit before undressing.
Tony enters the Hum-vee as the call ends, a glass of “Scotch” (spiced lemon tea) in hand. Rhodey comes up to his window. “I’m sorry. This is the Fun-vee. The Hum-drum-vee is over there.” Really, Tony didn’t have the strength to keep this “Tony Stane” farce up in front of Rhodey. Rhodey nods in understanding and walks off.
“Mama owie,” Jamie said putting his small pointer finger in his mouth.
On June 17, 1998, 18-year-old Tony Stark becomes Tony Stane.
Knowing that Air Force jets are coming his way, Tony accelerates his speed, but that doesn’t stop a missile from coming his way. He sends flares in response, and the explosion causes him to lose control of flight for a moment. He regains control just as the jets started shooting at him. With the damage he sustained from the Ten Rings, the suit will not be able to hold against this attack, especially as these were not normal bullets being shot at him. So Tony deploys the flaps to fly backward out of visual range and latches onto the underside of one of the jets. Then he calls Rhodey back.
“I was referring to your company’s involvement in this latest atrocity,” the Beta says matter-of-factly.
“That is an electromagnet, hooked up to a car battery, and it’s keeping the shrapnel from entering your heart.”
“Of course, no problem,” Obie says, carrying on the facade. He turns to the possible-investor whose name Tony still can’t place. “Give me and my Omega a moment, please.”
“Hey, thanks.”
Tony’s first year of marriage comes to an end. In that time, Tony finishes his two Masters in Electrical Engineering and Physics and Zeke graduates kindergarten. Rhodey goes into active duty, so the best friends mostly communicate by phone and snail-mail. Howard still refuses to let Tony work on any SI projects, much to Obie’s chagrin. Tony doesn’t mind much, he’d rather not be designing weapons anyway, and SI and its Board had yet to accept that the future lies in computers. Obie hits Tony a couple more times, but not nearly as much as Howard used to, so Tony doesn’t actually mind much. (And he
“I’m fine. How are…”
“Maybe you shouldn’t be testing things out yourself in your condition,” the Beta says wryly.
Tony is exhausted. He can’t give up, for his family, for Yahya. But he can’t help but lose a bit of hope. He’s been walking for at least 3 days now, with breaks to rest and sleep in between, without any success. He was starting to feel as though he wouldn’t find anything in time. Then the impossible happens.
“I already did.”
“Well, it was nice to finally talk to you, Steve, but I’ve got some deadlines to work on. Hopefully, we see each other again soon,” Tony sends what Steve is almost certain is a flirtatious smirk, “I would
“Tony!”
“Are you commenting on the weight of a pregnant person? Now that is just rude JARVIS. I raised you better than that.”
Steve used the shock of the two other people in the room to stride toward Tony and press a searing kiss onto the genius, again taking advantage of his surprise to slip his tongue into Tony’s pliant mouth. Tony must’ve been really surprised because, for a moment, he melted into Steve’s touch. Steve hoped to convey all of his passion, desire, and especially into this one kiss.
“Take me home please,” Tony tells the driver who is not Happy as the Alpha had gone off to get Zeke from Pasadena as soon he left Tony at SI. Not more than a millisecond after Tony closed the door of the car, Obie rips it open and climbs in. He looks livid.
Obie doesn’t follow and gives the older man a questioning look, “You aren’t going to come in with me?”
“Tony! Oh my god, you’re awake.” The Air Force Major gets up rapidly, moving closer to Tony.
by Fall Out Boys. It was going to be something else (that I will be saving for a later chapter), but I was listening to the song as I was writing, and it just felt right.
Otherwise, Obie is usually in his study, doing SI related work. He rarely comes out unless it’s for food or sex. (Tony’s just fine with that.)
Samantha came back with their food and the sake. “Hot sake?”
“Are you sure? It’s to the Foo Fighters,” Tony shrugs, “Doesn’t exactly go with the flow of the party so far.”
Tony goes up to the plane and climbs up the airstair, and subsequently towards Rhodey. “Three hours. For three hours you got me standing here,” Rhodey exclaims.
The man walks closer to Tony, so close that Tony can feel his breath on Tony’s face. “You tell me,” he says in English, “What were you two doing when you were hiding away from the cameras?”
“Time to hit the button!”
Pepper chuckles, “I actually don’t think that you could tie your shoes without me.”
Tony gets his Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and gets pregnant again about a year later. This pregnancy is also kept a secret from the public, Obie citing the same reason of stock prices except now it’s applicable. He prays for an Alpha son, fearing Obie’s actions should he not produce an Alpha heir for him.
Tony immediately felt better with his children closer to him, but there was still a pit in his stomach as his kids looked at him expectantly and with a little bit of worry. How was he going to break this news to them? “There’s something I have to tell you all,” he began.
They bring him all the things he needs, and he starts working under their watchful eye.
I'm on Tumblr as
continues, “Have you done this before, Tony?”
Some of the time, they sit in silence, both thinking about their respective lives from before, from outside of the cave. At least, that’s what Tony does, and what he thinks that Yinsen is doing too.
Then, it comes to him.
“That could run your heart for 50 lifetimes,” the Alpha says in disbelief.
You can find me on Tumblr as
Tony shrugs. “Yeah. They just put my name on the invitation. I don’t know what to tell you.”
Tony starts to pull the wires off his torso. “Well, I can’t exactly ask Rhodey or Happy with their big man hands. It’s either you or Zeke, really, and I don’t think this is something either of us wants to subject on that kid right now.”
They each serve themselves (except Jamie of course) and sit down to eat. Tony makes sure they eat a healthy serving of their vegetables, no matter how much Peter or Harley grumbled. Tony asks each of them about their day as he feeds Jamie bits of chicken. Zeke starts complaining about his summer program, how he has a group project where one of his partners is not picking up their own slack. Peter animatedly talks about how his LEGO building project is going. Harley proudly announces that he finally learned how to tie his own shoelaces and bends down to demonstrate for his mother. Every day since he’s come home, Tony has been utterly grateful for his boys, unable to imagine a life without them.
, Steve despairs in his head) reaches over with the eyedropper unscrewed from the bottle and drops a bit of the liquid where Mr. Bassett’s hands and the package met. A few seconds later, the box drops from the old man’s grip, landing onto the floor with a muffled
“Baby, can you tell me what’s wrong? I’ve noticed something off with you all through lunch,” Tony says softly, hoping not to wake the others.
“I could tell you Zeke’s, Pete’s, Harley’s, or Jamie’s,” the Omega says proudly.
Tony raises his eyebrows. “From Stane, actually. Societally, my marital status as an Omega overrides my doctorate degrees.”
“It’s an arc reactor,” Tony answers, “It’s keeping me alive. A Stark missile blew a hole into my chest. It’s keeping shrapnel from reaching my heart.”
what’s going on here. Tell me right now.”
Tony shrugs. “They had SI weapons, what else is there to say?”
Of course, Tony has no reason to doubt. “I’m with you no matter what, Tony. Just let me know if there is anything you need from me,” Rhodey says, a fire lit in his eyes.
So Tony thinks and thinks, his brain running a thousand miles per minute as he tries to figure a way out of this hellhole.
“Good,” Obie growls, “Because you’re mine.” The Alpha takes that moment to take Tony’s mouth into a searing kiss. Soon, clothes were flying off, and Tony had Obie right where he wanted him.
Tony remembers Yahya telling him about Gulmira, how it was once a lively place before the Ten Rings sunk their claws into it a couple of years ago.
“Yeah, I hear that a lot. Listen, I know this must be a trying time for you, but we need to debrief you. There’s still a lot of unanswered questions, and time can be a factor with these things. Let’s just put something on the books. How about the 21st at 7:00pm at Stark Industries?”
They haven’t even taken the picture when everything goes to shit.
After receiving enthusiastic responses, Tony bids adieu to his closest friends and takes his children up to his bedroom. He hands Jamie over to Zeke while he changes into comfortable clothes to sleep in. Tony is then the first to get on the bed, though his kids followed quickly after.
. Obviously, Steve wouldn’t tell Tony everything he has planned for him, but he has to at least tell Tony the truth of who he is because Tony is smart and Tony would figure out that Steve is lying, so he would have to keep his lying to a minimum. But first, he has to see Tony.
Steve quickly made his way to the 82nd floor, knowing that he had to get this done before the override wore off and JARVIS informed the Avengers of his presence. He made his way down to the storage room on the 82nd floor and immediately located the Tesseract. How could you mistake a large, glowing, blue cube like that?
Harley pouts but doesn’t complain further. Tony hugs each of his children goodbye and smothers Jamie’s face with kisses, the only one of the four that still allows that kind of treatment.
“It’s Rhodes,” Rhodey says from the other side of the line.
Yinsen smiles. “If you have kids, then you have everything.”
“I want you to reach in, and you’re gonna gently lift the wire out.”
They flank an Alpha Tony doesn’t recognize.
Tony shoots up into the air, as the AI recites numbers. “Thirteen percent power, sir.”
“Push it!” And she does. The blast pushes Tony back onto the roof, but also away from the beam of energy. Obie catches the brunt of it, frying his suit and leaving the Alpha unconscious. The suit falls through the roof and into the arc reactor, exploding on impact. Tony loses consciousness himself.
Kudos and comments are appreciated! Let me know what your favorite part is in the comments!
Yahya grabs a blanket from one of the cots, and Tony guides them to the blindspot. They lay the blanket on the ground and sit. It’s more awkward than Tony’s wedding night.
“There’s just one thing left,” Zeke drags on the last word as he types furiously. “And now I’m done.”
After dropping Harley and Peter off, Tony doesn’t go straight to the private airfield where his jet was waiting for him. He made a pit stop in Pasadena that was technically out of the way. Luckily, he found the reason for his abrupt change in destination sitting on the lawn of the building.
Tony was in despair for weeks. His mother was ripped away from him because his father was an irresponsible drunk. His mother was so close to seeing the birth of her grandson. Now his children will grow up without their Nonna Maria. He’s not even 20 and he’s lost his mother.
When he swoops into Gulmira, one of the members of the Ten Rings immediately starts firing on him, but the bullets barely scratch his titanium-gold exterior. He sends the guy a repulsor blast. He turns every which way to blast the Ten Rings members shooting at him into unconsciousness.
“Oh yeah, I’m driving with the top down.”
Tony lets out a sharp, humorless laugh. “Well, if you haven’t realized yet Ms. Everhart, Obie’s and my reputation is simply
Life goes on.
where I retweet a bunch of fandom stuff mostly (variety of fandoms, not just Marvel), but occasionally I'll have an original thought.
Rhodey releases Tony’s hand, and walks off toward a group of military personnel, probably to debrief. He was a true bureaucrat at heart.

feeling better now. I wanna go to school today. Anna Marie is going to bring her pet lizard for show and tell today.”
“Tell me right now!”
Tony grimaces. He doesn’t really have a choice.

Because Steve knows HYDRA, he knows he would never be able to escape. HYDRA will find him. They always find him. No matter what he does or where he goes, they always get him back, wipe him, and it was like it never happened. Short of going to another planet, there was no way he could break free, and Steve would even put space travel past them. No one leaves HYDRA unless it’s with a bullet between their eyes.
“I cared for him,” the younger man admits, “He’s the best Alpha I’ve ever known, other than Happy. He was good to me, better than Obie’s ever been. His name was Yahya.”

As Pepper leaves, Tony is left with his children, hoping that Pepper gets him the information before Obie gets back from wherever he is.
Finally, the festivities are over. Tony and Obadiah say their farewell to their family, make sure the nanny had Zeke, and head towards their hotel, where they will stay for the night before honeymooning in the Caribbean for the next two weeks.
Each time they dunk him, they keep him under just until he edges upon a plane of unconsciousness, then they drag him up again for a moment or two of breath and to scream at him before repeating the process. The pain of it is excruciating. Tony’s lungs are burning. His nostrils are burning. His head hurts and he is dizzy from the lack of oxygen. On top of all that, there is the electromagnet that they put inside him. A couple of drops of water in the wrong place and Tony was in for a world of trouble. (Not that he wasn’t
Tony looks directly at Yahya, trying to discern the Alpha’s reaction and answer.
“Actually,” Rhodey says, “You won’t be doing anything. From Stane will be leaving now and checked over at home. So if you would please bring us the discharging forms, that would be much appreciated.”
“As a matter of fact, I do,” Pepper says primly.
His fellow captive helps him through the entire process, even though he has no idea what Tony is planning or doing. He learns the Alpha’s name. Yinsen.
Tony reaches down to cup his Alpha son’s cheek. “
“Yes, they did,” Pepper answers, warmth shining in her eyes, “They even made me this card.” Pepper holds up a hand-drawn birthday card with a bunch of figures representing their family. Tony’s heart swelled. His children were such angels.
Tony nearly throws the door open in his enthusiasm. As soon as the door opened, two small, blurred figures barreled into him. “Momma!” They bawl in unison.
and he would lose
circumstance.)
“Is it true you and your husband went 12 for 12 with last year’s Maxim cover models?” The soldier asks eagerly.
“Oh god! What do I do?”
This time Tony doesn’t give Rhodey a chance to respond. “Listen, you have to make sure no one finds out about it, okay Rhodey? You can’t let the doctor touch me, please. No one can know that I have the arc reactor in my chest.”
“Tears of joy,” Pepper says, playing along, “I hate job hunting.”
to be marrying Obadiah. Howard was seeking suitors even older and even more traditional before Obadiah was an option. Then his Beta wife died 2 and a half years ago in a car crash that almost took their son Zeke as well. Tony and Obadiah were engaged 6 months later. The ink on her death certificate probably wasn’t even dry before Howard brought up this arrangement. (Though, it confirmed the suspicions Tony had regarding the man’s previous marriage, as Zeke had been born just 6 months after.)
Tony barely notices as he reaches the end of the aisle and faces Obie. The officiate drones on and on, and Tony only pays enough attention to know when to say his part. After they exchange rings and say “I do,” the officiate declares them man and Omega and Obadiah lifts Tony’s veil to give Tony a chaste kiss. The bonding bite would come later in private.
As they slowly walk up the stairs, Tony tells Pepper some of what happened. “You saw what happened in Gulmira, right?” Pepper nods. “Well, they had SI weapons and I couldn’t let that stay. Gulmira was Yahya’s hometown. His family could’ve been there, my baby’s family could be there. I had to do it.”
“I have no idea what you’re talking about,” Pepper sniffs haughtily.
~*~*~*~*~
“Tony,” Obie bellows once he spots Tony, definitely drunk, “Meet the lovely Christine Everhart.”
Zeke’s eyes go wide. “You’re gonna read me a bedtime story?” Tony smiles and nods, hoping to seem encouraging. “A Bad Case of Stripes, please.” So Tony grabs the book from the bookshelf in Zeke’s room and begins to read. It takes all of 10 minutes and Zeke’s eyes start to droop as the time goes by.
Obie is able to get a hold of Tony and throw him off and onto the skylight. He opens up the suit to reveal himself. “I never had a taste for this sort of thing, but I must admit, I’m deeply enjoying this suit. You finally outdid yourself, Tony!”
that he can barely think.
“It’s an inside joke between me and your mom, kiddo,” Pepper smiles as she reaches out to ruffle the young Alpha’s hair.
The assembly bots come together to mold the suit onto his form. For the first time, Tony suits up in the entirely completed Mark II suit.
Steve is in awe, of both the events that have just occurred and the man behind them. The other handful of people that gathered have also dispersed, leaving just Steve and 5J.
(Turns out, Rhodey has a really hard time saying no to Tony.)
But he keeps going for the people he cares about. He thinks of Happy. Of Rhodey. And Pepper. Of Zeke and Peter and Harley and Jamie. But most of all. He thinks about Yahya.
“They’re haranguing me,” Pepper interrupts, “so I’m going to say yes.”
“They want to keep you from doing that too.”
“I’ve been through hell and back in the last few months, Obie,” Tony bites out, “The last thing I wanted to do was parade myself in front of the fucking press. I just want to go home to my kids who I haven’t seen in three goddamn months!”
“No,” Tony says decisively, “I’ll deal with it. Rhodey, he’ll just be mad that you know before him. And Harley, let’s try not to lie to your father too much; he’ll figure it out. Thanks for trying, though, both of you.”
Zeke is quiet for the first few days after finding out. Much more quiet than he has ever been since that first day at home together. Three days in, Tony could not take the silence any longer. “Honey,” Tony begins as they are quietly eating lunch together, “Why have you been so quiet?”
can barely believe a word he was saying, why would this journalist?
For a moment, there was nothing but silence coming from the other line. Steve waited. “How do you have Tony’s phone? What have you done to him?” Van Dyne screeched.
“You can’t have sashimi without a bit of sake, Rhodey,” Tony says incredulously.
“I swear I will tell you all about it. Let me just get this off.”
Mr. Bassett. Steve has only lived in this building for a year, and yet he’s still managed to grow to hate the man in that short amount of time. However to Steve that does not count; Steve is pretty sure that everyone in his building hated Mr. Bassett. Hell, everyone who has ever met the crotchety old man probably has some level of dislike for him.
“That’s not going to be enough.”
Zeke shrugs, “Nanny Clara used to tell Daddy. But then Daddy said he didn’t care. So she stopped.”
“Of course, I know that. I’ll keep you updated. Pepper and I have started to look into it.” Tony pats the older man’s shoulder. “Since you’re here, you might as well spend some time with your godsons.”
Zeke rolls his eyes but reaches out to hug his mother. “I’m gonna miss you, Mom. Stay safe.”
Obie looks at him in shock as well. “What? It’s only been three weeks. I didn’t know we could know that quickly.”
The ice had already crusted its way around the entirety of Obie’s suit. Tony watched as the power blinked out of the eye slits of Obie’s suit. “Might want to look into it,” the Omega quips as he punches the suit down, watching as it falls through the air. Though, Tony can’t watch long.
*Some dialogue has been and will be taken (and many times modified) directly from the films.
Obie isn’t, there that is.
In a split second, Steve slammed the Winter Soldier against the wall, one hand wrapped around his throat, lifting him off the ground. Barnes seemed unaffected, nonchalant, even though Steve was cutting off his airflow. “What have you done?” Steve growled, “Who sent you?”
“Well, I’m a busy, busy man Ms.—is it Ms. or Mrs. or Of or From?—things do come up for people like me. By the way, how
“You know that I never wanted to make weapons, but I did it anyway. You stood by my side all these years while I reaped the benefits of destruction. Now, I’m trying to protect the people that I put in harm’s way. I know in my heart that this is right.”
The Avengers were also different here. Their existence is only first noted about 3 years ago at the Battle of New York, a stark contrast to the decade that the Avengers were active in his world. (Steve noted the advantage; the Avengers Initiative here was a fledgling compared to the one he has faced off against.) There was no Janet Van Dyne or Hank Pym on the team, although they did exist in this world, but were much, much older, seemingly in the same generation as Howard Stark (apparently in this world, Stark and Pym had a fierce rivalry). The Avengers team still had a Bruce Banner that became a mean, green rage monster and other-worldly prince Thor. The biggest difference, the one that shocked him to his core, was that a version of Steve Rogers, as Captain America, was an Avenger. Apparently in this world, he had been thawed out later and by SHIELD instead of HYDRA. Steve couldn’t help but chuckle darkly at that, if only he had been so lucky. Well, maybe not so lucky. The dump of SHIELD information on the Internet, though some of it seems to be missing and more and more keeps disappearing (likely the work of JARVIS), clearly shows that HYDRA had infiltrated SHIELD a long time ago, another very big difference between this world and the world Steve belonged to.
“Mom?” Zeke asked confused as he jogged over to the cars, “What are you doing here?”
And before Steve knew it, the Tesseract glowed immensely bright, blinding him and engulfing the room in a blue light that eclipsed the light of the alarms.
Howard Stark can be seen beaming all day, as he helps coordinate the day with Maria, making sure everything goes according to plan.
Every couple of hours when Tony’s Heat flares up and becomes too uncomfortable to bear, they slip away to the blindspot to dull the ache but come back as quickly as possible so as not to alert the Ten Rings. Sometimes they sleep when Yahya’s knot settles, tired from their activities, but sometimes they talk, when Tony isn’t feeling embarrassed and self-conscious. It’s the most comfortable Heat that Tony has ever shared with anyone.
Yinsen nods, “We all do things for the betterment of our children, so they can survive, thrive in this world.”
“Yes.”
Later that evening, Tony and the Alpha captive sit in silence in front of the fire as they usually do most nights following Tony’s torture. It is their only source of heat in the dreary cave they are held in.
“Sure, go ahead. You’ve impressed me. Must be persistent if you went to all the trouble of getting my personal number for family and friends only.”
“This is not a piece of equipment. I’m in it. It’s a suit. It’s me!” Tony exclaims.
A couple of hours later, Rhodey is absolutely
Nevertheless, Tony stays pliant as Obie presses their lips together.
“Not in the boot, Dum-E. Right here, you got me?” Tony points where the bot should be focusing his attention. “Stay put. Nice.”
They do this for days. Tony doesn’t know exactly how long.
“And what about your baby themself?”
“And what would you have done?”
that name. He wouldn’t even be in the weapons business if he had any choice and instead he’s the face of it. “That's not bad.” Tony clears his throat and switches the phone from his right ear to his left. “Let me guess. Berkeley?”
Now time for the next phase of the plan.
“Stop fussing over your kid, Tony,” Pepper says exasperated, “I need to speak to you about a couple of things before I get you out of the door. Larry called. He’s got another buy for the Jackson Pollock in the wings. Do you want it? Yes or no.”
“Okay,” Tony says quietly as he nods, picking his head back up. Tony looks at Obie for a minute before resting his head on the Alpha’s shoulder. The other man automatically wraps an arm around the smaller and younger man. “I missed you Alpha,” Tony utters softly, ever so calculating. There have been only a handful of times where Tony has sought Obie out, mostly when he was younger and feeling lonely or craving intimacy. But this was nothing like those times, though he was trying to make Obie seem so. This was a calculated move.
“Hello?” Tony greets, trying to sound nonchalant.
Pepper smiles warmly. “I need you to sign this before you go. You’re going to need to head out now. I know you’re going to want to drop the boys off at school, and that will already make you late.”
Life goes on.
“We’re almost sordid gossip,” Pepper giggles into Tony’s ear, “The billionaire dancing intimately with his PA.”
So Tony stands in front of the mirror in his wedding suite as his mother adjusts his faded white wedding dress when his father comes in to retrieve him. Howard walks up to Tony and smiles, “You’re making me proud today, son.” Tony held back a grimace. Of course it would be the day he gets married that would make Howard proud. Not when he built a motherboard as a 4-year-old. Not when he built a nearly-sentient robot dog at 11. Not when he made one of the first rudimentary AIs in existence at 17. No, it is the day Tony will sign his life away.
“Hit me, platypus. I am at your service.”
“Wow,” Yinsen says in awe, “That doesn’t look like a Jericho missile.”
Tony’s heart instantly clenches for the small Beta boy. Though Zeke may not have to go through the same trials and tribulations as an Omega, Tony knows what it’s like to be hated by a father that wanted an Alpha son. “Of course I’ll play with you. But not right now. I have to finish unpacking the house, okay?”
Mr. Bassett wisely decides to stay silent. The occupant of 5J (
Tony can only nod, the adrenaline wearing off. The last thing he thinks before he falls unconscious in Rhodey’s arms due to dehydration and exhaustion,
“Zeke!” Tony called out as he climbs out of the driver’s seat of his car. “Come over here!”
“If my math is right,” Tony answers, “and it always is, three gigajoules per second.”
Once he finished with his shower and the rest of his morning routine, Steve exited the bathroom, hoping some of his lover’s anger had subsided in the last twenty minutes, but knowing that Tony was probably sitting cross-legged on the bed, eyes burning with fury, raring to go. That’s not what Steve saw. What Steve saw instead made his heart drop into the pits of his stomach; he was not nearly ready for the sight that assaulted his eyes. Tony, with his eyes wide open and his mouth ajar, laid unmoving on the bloodstained sheets with Bucky Barnes standing over him with a bloody dagger.
Abruptly remembering his children, Tony turns to the play area. Peter and Harley look at Tony with unshed tears in their eyes, waiting for their mother to give them the okay to enter the general workshop space.
But it all came to a head when he decided to help set up the Sokovia Accords.
Steve spoke up first, "I don't know about you guys, but I've got a bad feeling about this..."
Everyone startles and looks around.
In his haze, he didn't stop to remember that he was only halfway through the movie and that movies don't show static at the end anymore nowadays.
Maim her, maim him.
Tony winced and pulled up his sleeves- and quickly pulled them down again in horror.
"They wont smell me?" The talking fox asks as he wriggles himself into the launderer's basket.
to hear me out! H-he jus
Fury pinched the bridge of his nose. The universe must hate him passionately. He must have disgraced someone in a previous life or something. Not that he'd ever say that out loud. "Get a group of S.H.E.I.L.D. agents out there and search for them. This had better not be some sort of prank." Hill nodded and left the room. Maybe he was a distasteful bear or something in a past life. Killing hikers and the like...
Like.
The young man looks up to the right side of the road as the first Huntsmen come down from over the hill. "Here they come!" He whispers to the fox concealed inside of his basket. Here they come indeed.
The dark gnarled trees swished in the breeze as Tony looked around.
The Hunter says nothing and merely stares down the launderer. Steve sweats as he stares back, doubt creeping into his mind.
It had a crudely drawn Slenderman with a few trees around him with the word,
He had been raped... Over, and over, and over again. Never stopping. Never ceasing. Tony fell unconcious before that creature stopped violating him, and that was
Pepper stomped her way down the hallway and started pulling Tony with her back toward the gala. "Tony! I know that you don't like to socialize, but you can only hide away for so many hours! The gala is about to end and you need to meet a few more people before it does." Pepper didn't notice Tony's sharp wince when she pulled the new bruises on his shoulders. What she did notice, however, was something on the side of his face, neck, and shoulder. She scrunched up her nose and took a handkerchief from her small purse and started to wipe at it. "Tony, what the hell? What's this icky black stuff all over you? And is that rug burn on your cheek?" Hearing that Tony flipped. He snatched the handkerchief away from her and started to furiously wipe at the blood and pus that was left. "It's some sort of machine oil right? I don't even know how you even got it in here, but come on! We need to go!" And with that, the red haired woman dragged a badly shaken genius back to the party. Before Tony could follow Pepper and duck under the rope, a breeze came and blew against his face and through his hair. Almost as if it was a hand caressing it. Tony yelped and quickly followed Pepper. Behind them, a ghostly and broken chuckle could be heard.
"What happened?" He asked.
A furious blush grew on the blond's face. Cackling Tony slapped his shoulder and headed upstairs. It was nice to know his friend could get flustered too.
"I want my Daddy! I want my Papa!" The boy cried, sounding scared.
"Hey, I seem to have forgotten my jacket", he said. Heading over to the sofa he found the item and started to head back. Getting to his feet the engineer intercepted him. Before he could lose his nerve he gestured for the other to bend down. Obediently the blond lowered his head. Tony immediately grabbed his collar and kissed him.
"Do you like doing this?"
"That was why we offered you Thor's floor. It was a good excuse to start living together", Tony gave a careful grin. "Loki is our son, by the way. Thought I'd let you know. On paper I'm bio dad and Steve is adoptive dad, though obviously we both adopted him."
"Night Papa."
"Hey, Lo", he said to the boy. "Why don't you go watch some cartoons until dinner?"
"So, no one else knew until now?" He asked instead.
overreact, wouldn't he. But there is no way we can hide that a kid lives here now. How do we explain this?"
"I'm hungry."
"What in the world are you planning..."
It was a toddler. Maybe three years old. The child was both stark naked and filthy. Confused the soldier looked around but saw no one else. There was something eerily familiar about the boy. Especially with the matted black hair and those big green eyes.
Should he tell his mother? There was no telling Odin, that was for sure. Loki's misery during his life was most certainly in large because of the All-Father. Not only the lies, but other small things throughout his life. It was almost, almost, as if the Trickster had existed only to act as a foil to Thor himself. A force to make him into the man he had become. Usually by knocking him down a few pegs regularly.
"The kid's are upstairs, playing", Tony said. "Probably destroying half the penthouse but what can you do."
"Yes, but the All-Speak..."
It was a promise, and a precaution. By leaving the watch, the wedding band, he could make certain it wouldn't be lost or damaged. Or stolen.
The soldier chuckled. "Do what you think it best. Just don't push yourself too hard."
So, they didn't want to waste the opportunity.
"Iron Man, yes but Tony Stark, no?" Tony teased.
As he walked he noticed that the floorboards seemed to sag under his feet. The closer he got to the kitchen, the more noticeable it was. Concerned he tested the floor and it was definitely sagging.
The god of thunder had spotted the small boy, recognising him. First there was shocked astonishment but it quickly faded into fury. "How dare you!" He roared and stomped towards the tiny Trickster. "You tricked me! Mother! Even the Avengers! You snake, you..."
Seeing the three of them, they really made the picture of a family. Especially once Tony sneaked a kiss from... his husband...
"Not for a long time. He did a shitty thing to the kid."
"I went to Loki's chambers, and while tidying them up, I found this." He held out the book towards the Queen. "I recall my brother studying it and thought you might know something about it."
"Probably."
Still sniffing while having a grip on Rogers' shirt, the boy reached out and grabbed a grain ring. Putting it in his mouth. Stark was still fussing about, placing berries on a plate. Blueberries, strawberries and raspberries. Giving it to Loki. He also poured a glass of some white drink.
"Bedroom", he panted. Which prompted the blond to take of his jacket and then pick the shorter man up. Carrying his like a bride.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Water damage. And pretty extensive too. The pipes are leaking all over. I knew I should have handled the plumbing myself. But oh no, it was supposed to be professionals. Well, look what that got me."
"Whatever happened to make Lokes a kid again had probably something to do with those Norse gods, or whatever. You should have seen Thor with the kid. No patience at all. Constantly assuming ill intent from a toddler."
"Do you need any help?" Steve asked as the engineer started carrying everything to an unused bedroom.
?", then it was "Wait, you are marrying
"What an odd game..." Thor said.
Snickering Tony took a few more photos of the sleeping duo. It was honestly a rather cute sight. Little Loki fast asleep on Steve's chest, who had also fallen asleep. No wonder it had suddenly gotten quiet.
"No... just, Tony can be quite a bit pushy so I guess I just wanted to make sure."
"Okay." Without complaining the kid went to his toys and started playing. Sometimes slipping into what sounded like Asgardian.
"What happened?"
"Loki... as in the guy who attacked New York?"
"What about before that? Has he said anything?"
"Steve..." he was pulled down for a kiss, pushing them both over the edge. They didn't stop there, of course. It was rare that they had time for more than a quickie after Loki had been put to bed. Their son would quite often come and ask to sleep with them. And they just couldn't help but let him.
One drawing made him linger more than the rest. It was recent, from the day of his break-up with Pepper. Had he made that kind of expression? One that was both sad and relieved? It made him feel oddly... warm.
"Did you break up?" Someone asked. "Who initiated the break-up?"
"Hey!"
"But... how? There is no... well... hole there... to use" the Thunderer didn't look comfortable but if was asking questions, he would have to deal with the answer.
"I understand. Thank you, Tony", the soldier said and hugged the other. Who blushed a bit.
"You haven't broken anything", the blond said stubbornly. "Come on. We can discuss this later, for now you need to get warm. No excuses." Pulling his husband to his feet Steve was rather alarmed at how cold he felt. Taking them both to the penthouse he bundled up Tony in a thick blanket and made some hot chocolate for the two of them. Which the tiny Trickster completely ignored and was instead playing like there was nothing unusual. At least the engineer was drinking.
"Where's Loki?" He murmured.
"Good", the engineer said and slowly placed their son back on the floor. Though the boy hid behind him.
Soon enough the news ended, turning off the TV Tony closed his eyes. Leaning against the soldier, soaking in his warmth. He jumped when small hands suddenly touched him.
"She dumped me", Tony said. "Saying she couldn't deal with me being Iron Man. Man, I really am worthless..."
Tony suddenly looked as he had an epiphany. "That's it!" He shouted, making Loki look at him curiously. "Don't worry, Lo. Daddy and Papa are just talking." Nodding the boy returned to his cartoon. "He understands us through All-Speak, but he doesn't connect yet that we don't understand him the same way. That's why he doesn't seem to learn, he doesn't hear a difference."
"'Why?' Are you serious? Can you really say all these things, see all these things, and still be so blind? Adult Loki was killed unjustly. Before that he was treated like trash. What did you do with his body?"
Thor couldn't find any words. He was angry at the accusation against his father, but he also felt ashamed that he had lost his temper on a child. To this Loki, he was basically a stranger. One that had barely interacted with him.
"Hey, Thunder Pants!" The engineer said with a cherriness he didn't feel. "How's it hanging?"
The blond was crying, and it looked painful. Mind rushing the engineer tried to sort his thoughts. He knew his husband had had some very trying days. Faced with impossible choices. There were no point on being angry or add to the guilt.
The next time he woke up, it was morning. They were no longer cuddling. Sprawled across the bed with his head in the pillow the soldier was still asleep. Snorting the billionaire got up, took a shower, and poured himself some coffee while getting a glass of water for the other.
"Papa!" The tiny Trickster squealed happily and ran up to the soldier. Steve caught him and tossed him gently a few times. Making the boy roar with laughter. Tony smiled at them while adjusting his suit. They were heading to the courthouse today. While the kid wouldn't join them inside, they still didn't want to leave him in the Tower.
At first the tiny god tried to go along with the older kids but soon enough he seemed to feel intimated by their explosion of energy. Holding the former sergeant's pants leg. Eyeing them uncertainly.
"Are you really saying that you drawing me is an expression of love? Yikes, that's cheeky and campy. Wait, does this mean you have done that before?"
The woman's eyes widened and then she smiled. Offering her hand. "Hi, I'm Laura Barton. This is Lila and Cooper. Kids, this is Dad's work friends. Iron Man and Captain America."
"Think about it, Tony. Our inhibitions is what is stopping us from acting on impuls, on instincts. It can make us do things we would normally stop ourselves from doing. Like... I don't know... going to thinking about robbing a store to actually doing it because you can no longer consider the long-term consequences."
"And?"
Bruce was still looking at the broken figurine. He didn't blame Steve and Tony for being angry. It was understandable. But it would likely not be the last time they would have to defend the small god of mischief they called their son.
"This is breakfast, Loki."
"I... don't think so. Howard and Bucky got along pretty well. And... they had done something to him. He didn't recognise me either and was determined to kill me. I... I nearly let him..."
"Oh, you know, courthouse weddings are all the rage nowadays. Elope and no one needs to know. We intend to keep our own last names and all that."
"Odinson. As in Thor?" Tony asked, feeling a chill down his spine.
"I have never seen Stark that angry", Romanoff remarked. "You really pissed him off."
"You want to sleep in here tonight?"
"Nej!"
"He sure is blue, huh..."
"And became his parents, from the look of it."
Still high on emotions from the bar, the soldier pulled Tony closer to him. Giving him a kiss, Combing through brown hair with his fingers.
"Hey, I'm not judging. Surprised, sure, but other than that, not my business."
Slamming the door behind him Bucky rushed to the bathroom where he threw up violently. Even though there was barely anything in his stomach. Washing out his mouth he returned to the bedroom and collapsed against the bed.
After having played for a while Loki felt his stomach start to rumble. Meaning he was hungry. Putting away his toys the boy looked for Uncle Bruce. The man was on the sofa, fast asleep. Carefully he tried shaking the man, he had been warned to not make him angry in any circumstance. A snore was all the answer he got. Pouting the tiny god decided to find some food on his own. He had watched Papa and Daddy make food plenty of times, after all.
"Mm?"
Twenty minutes later he returned to his own shared bedroom. Tony was naked and was still awake. Giving him a seductive grin. "Come on, soldier, I'm not sleeping until I had some."
"What the heck were you guys doing?" The engineer demanded.
His AI interrupted him one day.
"Hey, buddy", the soldier said and went down on one knee. Using his left arm to hug the boy. Who rubbed his rubbed his face against the broad chest. "I'm glad to be home."
"This kind of all-compassing, selfless, love. Paper or no paper. This is my son. Our son. It doesn't matter that it is Loki. It doesn't matter what happened before. He is
"Hi, Bruce Banner."
"Not so fun to be on the other side, huh?"
"Daddy..." the boy whined. Steve still held him but his husband came closer. Also rubbing the small back.
"I got curious."
"Married, huh..." the blond chuckled. "I like the sound of that. Being married to the person I love. Do you want to do it? Get married?"
"And you don't get a second try. Fail once, and it is over. On the other hand, if you succeed in casting the spell, it will remain dormant until, if at all, the conditions are met. I can imagine Loki studying this spell for months, long after we noticed, and tried casting it. While he of all people might have succeeded, it wouldn't have been any use. As he wouldn't have fulfilled the conditions."
"Did you ask him what he wanted?"
Sighing Tony gave up on any coffee in the penthouse and decided to head to the common floor. His husband and son was still asleep so he didn't wake them.
"Ah", his husband said. "He didn't want you to watch over him, he wanted one or both of you to stay with him all night."
"Our dad is also a hero", Lila said. "Mommy says so. That he is away a lot because he is keeping the world safe. But I wish he was home more..."
Tony was pissed. Okay. That was a fucking understatement. He was furious. His anger towards Barton has been a candle compared to the inferno he felt right now. Thor had explained his findings and what his mom had told him.
Wilson was shown to the sofas and they sat down. Loki crawled up on the sofa and insisted on sitting in the soldier's lap. Leaning against him.
"Yeah, can't see that working out. Though having a sibling isn't too bad. Normally."
"Tony... I think we might have a problem..." Steve called.
I had four commissions to write yesterday day and both my computers decided to work against me (I got an unused laptop from my mom, it is a bit old and can't handle a lot but it works. So now I have both a desktop and a laptop). My Internet was slow and spotty, websites wouldn't load properly, and was soo slow. In addition my keyboard and computer mouse decided to act up as well.
Lo looked at the Falcon with curiosity and took his hand. "Ja." He said.
Deflating the Thunderer took off the satchel, offering it. The engineer took it and looked inside, one eyebrow rose. "What am I supposed to do with these?"
"Are you okay, Bucky?" Asked the blond. Steve.
"I'd say that makes you a bit crazy but", the engineer smiled softly. "I can only say the same, thank you for being with me, Steve. I love you too. Shall we have our wedding night, then?"
? For real?"
(See the end of the chapter for
"...don't kill him."
"You seem calm to see him like that", he told the inventor.
"Let him go if he wants to", the mean man said. "Actually, throw him in the elevator already."
Steve took a deep breath. "Do you remember that crush I had once? In art school? William?"
"Can I have chocolate pancakes with tons and tons of cream? With pieces in them? And strawberries?"
"How bad is it?"
"What are you guys talking about?" The engineer asked, curiosity peaked. In answer he was handed the notebook. Only, it turned out to be a sketchbook. Full of drawings. Flipping through them he was impressed with the level of detail. Especially the portraits.
"It looks like some kind of drug. Relatively harmless."
Combing through the short hair he marvelled at his sudden luck. Maybe he had a future after all. One with his brilliant, mischievous, and big-hearted engineer.
"I bring my shield", the blond said. "Feeling better?"
"What is it, JARVIS?" Steve asked.
"It will be fine", the brunet said and kissed his boyfriend. "First things first, and all that."
"Don't wanna", he said.
"Hi! Are one of you his dad?" A visibly pregnant woman with long, brown hair said. Behind her stood two more children. Looking like they were in elementary school.
Eventually they began kissing again. Which ended with them returning to bed. It was even better this time.
"Bucky, allow me to introduce you to my husband. Tony Stark."
"Yeah, I heard Thor. Telling us his own brother had been beheaded while being judged by his own father! Acting like Loki not knowing his true race was acceptable and that he should have lived his whole life in a lie!" Tony grabbed the front of Clint's shirt and pulled the man to his feet. His team, sans Steve, tended to assume that his suit did everything in a fight. Not realising that years of building and working out had given him a decent amount of muscle.
"Tony..." Steve said. "I saw him use magic, he made the bubbles look like animals..."
"What's wrong, Lo? Can't sleep?" He said groggily.
"Tease", the engineer laughed. "Let's wait until we are in private, babe."
"You want lunch? I can make pancakes."
"And don't do anything stupid. Like getting killed."
"Hey, no need to be so defensive", Bucky laughed. "So, are you going to ask him out?"
"I wonder why", the brunet took a long sip from his cup. Laughing the blond headed out.
"Hawaiian? What's that?"
I have joined a sort of theatre workshop that meets every Wednesday evening. It has been a long time since I did anything like it. But while it is a lot of fun, it is also tiring. You need a lot of focus and is very physical. Both times now I've been down for the count once I come home.
"Agreed", Steve said and smiled when the god of mischief ran up to him. "Hey, buddy. Sorry we weren't there when you woke up from a nightmare. You can have snack later before dinner."
"Maybe his real people are durable against the cold?"
Steve carefully and gently worked him open. It was a rather novel experience. Before Pepper his experience with men had always been kind of rough. Rushed. It had been one of the reason he had stuck to women despite being bisexual. Yet, now he was being treated with so much care. So much gentleness. There wasn't even a fight about using a condom. The soldier put it on all on his own, no prompting needed.
"Jarvis is pinpointing the exact location as we speak. Once it is locked in, we can go get him."
It was the first time the colonel was meeting the boy. He was aware of the circumstances, of course. The tiny god rushed to meet them as they exited the elevator. Steve and Tony were dressed to leave, since they planned on staying in a hotel that night.
"Steve?"
"That's normal, he can understand you, so it will work itself out. Lo! Could you go with Sam here? He's a friend and he wants to eat lunch with you."
"Did you say something, Cap?" Barton asked from the kitchen.
"Yeah, he hates soggy cereal." Taking the bowl he placed in the sink, in the meanwhile, the Captain sat down. Letting the tiny Trickster sit on his lap. "He wants them as they are." A new bowl was brought out and filled with cereals that was then placed on the table."
"I admit, he is cute", Rhodey said with smile. "Still can't believe Tony is married. Never thought he would."
Petting his son's hair Tony felt his chest filling with warmth. Bending down he gave a small kiss to the boy's forehead.
"I don't know... Fury mentioned setting me up in an apartment... I... I couldn't come up with an excuse and..."
Huffing a chuckle the brunet sat up and looked into those intense blue eyes. The guy was definitely handsome. Broad shoulders, strong chest, and a nice ass. In the right clothes. It was remarkable that he had started out as a sickly and scrawny kid. And now he was having that worried little frown on his face and a complicated expression.
Great. That complicated things. Pulling out a bag of pull-ups he opened it, gesturing for the blond to put down the kid.
"That's not... he isn't speaking English..."
"What's going on?" The engineer asked.
"Are you two ready yet?" Pepper said impatiently while popping her head inside. Wearing a nice dress and with her hair up. "I booked the time, you know."
"Nah", Natasha said. "Let's eat."
"Who is that?" The girl asked, pointing at one of the figures.
"Don't be. That's what we promised, remember. Through good times and bad times."
Thor gave up. The boy didn't seem to understand, behaving just like the age he seemed to be. Meaning his questions were to complicated for Loki to understand.
Thunder Pants had mulish expression. "I will retreat to my own chambers before I do something I regret", he said. Stood and left. Feeling his heartbeat slow down as the adrenaline drained out of him, Tony started crying.
"True. He can play with children his own age but he doesn't befriend them as such. And after what happened in the park..."
"We didn't know what had happened. And to be honest, I'm still not sure", the soldier said.
"Airplane? Like the quinjet?"
"I do."
"I believe that when I see it", Clint said, crossing his arms and glaring at the now quiet child. "Is there something else you have been hiding from us?"
"I..." the strawberry blonde woman took a deep breath. "I wanted to apologise. I realise it took me way too long to do this, but... Tony, I'm sorry for what I said to you when we broke up. I shouldn't have said any of it."
The group reached some kind of odd vehicle and one after another the other kids were placed inside it. All while another woman made notes. While his now former playmates had ran forward to get inside the odd thing, Loki did not.
I get commissions to more or less write content marketing articles. It is an extra income, even if it is not ideal. In last few weeks, the amount of assignments I receive have skyrocketed. I basically get new ones as soon as I'm finished with the first batch.
"I will try, if nothing else, I have you to rein me in." They shared a kiss. Completely ignoring the chaos in front of them. Steve pulled him into a hug. Making him feel so warm and content.
"And in reality?"
(See the end of the chapter for
"What? What do you want me to do?"
"He is also making a mess... he couldn't sit at the table?" His boyfriend whined.
"You don't have to, but please let us help you."
"Not get thrown out again would be a start."
He was very pleased to see that it made things easier for all of them. Less diapers for one thing. The only time the pull-ups were used were during the night. Just in case.
"...I never dated a man. Or a woman, to be honest. Peggy was the closest I got. But there were times when I... was drawn... to other men. Bucky was the only one who knew and he didn't care beyond teasing me. It was illegal to be with other men and I didn't have it in me to try anyway."
Sam chuckled, shaking his head. Obviously amused. "You are quite the trio", he said while grinning. "It is cute. Two Papa bears protecting their cub. He is very lucky to have you."
"That's..." honestly? He had forgotten. Things were going so well with Steve that he hadn't even bothered to think about the failed relationship.
Next time he woke up, it was because his husband was giving him kisses. Gentle as always. A hand petted his hair. Sighing pleasantly, he snuggled into the strong arms.
"Man of my heart. Literally, in this case. You are probably right. A press conference is probably the best option in this case."
Steve chuckled again and gave him a looong kiss on the mouth. And then a few more shorter ones. Opening his eyes Tony looked into those blue eyes. So earnest and open.
It was oddly quiet without the tiny god. Steve shook himself and ran his fingers through Tony's hair, kissing his lips. They both blushed a bit, laughed, and fell into each other's arms.
The words slipped out but they were true. Tears formed in the blond's eyes. Both moved at once and met for a warm, intense kiss. And from now on, they would be able to live together without anyone the wiser.
"Uh... yeah, good point... what about getting some watercolours and paper. So you guys can paint?" That got a nod. Said and done. He covered the kitchen table with a wax tablecloth. Placed blocks of paint, plastic cups with water, and a bunch of brushes. And of course a pile of white paper.
"Daddy! It is super good!"
"He would if I wanted to", Tony shrugged and then grinned in a kind of devilish way. "But I prefer letting
"I'm sorry... I need... I..." he fled.
"Yes, by the way", Tony said.
Tony's eyes widened and he hurriedly picked up their son in his arms, trying to shield the child and backing away. He wouldn't be able to do anything though. Swiftly Steve put himself between the furious Thunderer and his family. Holding out a hand, stopping him.
Walking the halls of the Palace he found himself in front of his brother's chambers. No one had been inside since the Trickster's supposed suicide. Opening the double doors the Thunderer went inside. There were no dust, likely due to a spell. But it wasn't as tidy as he was accustomed to. Books thrown everywhere. Clothes flung across the room. Items that had been broken.
"Okay, that's interesting. Do you want me to go? I can come back later if you need some privacy."
"Besides, Stevio here needs to heal up some more before we need that kind of privacy", Tony said. "Also, we promised to explain more. Might as well get that over with."
"I will call you as often as I can", Steve promised. "Take care of yourself and of Loki. I love you, Tony."
"If we try to explain, they will have questions. If we don't, they will draw their own conclusions. The most likely conclusion? That Loki here is my kid from a fling and I've just learnt about."
It was an upscale hotel. The lobby was quiet and the staff spoke softly. Before getting married, Steve had never been to places like this. Now he was starting to get used to it. They received the key card to their room and went up.
"Very well, you may go for now."
Picking Loki up Steve placed him in his chair and fixed a plate. Well aware that Bucky was staring at him. His best friend was back. The question was how he would react to learning about the marriage.
"Hi", the former sergeant said.
"Making? Babe, this love will be cooking."
A stressed employee seemed torn between running out to fetch the kid and stay were he was. Rather than being bothered though, the soldier just picked the child up into his arms. Holding him with practised ease. The sudden  appearance had pushed the journalists into a shocked silence. Until someone raised their hands.
"Oh, hi Cap!" Barton said and the brunet jumped. Looking over his shoulder in guilt. Steve was looking at the three of them, his eyes fixed on the sketchbook. A light blush on his cheeks. "Didn't know you were such an artist!"
"He is mean!"
"Yeah, it got busted in front of me. As soon as I saw it I held my breath. Why?"
Which caused a storm of other questions. Again, drawing each other out. Making it impossible to hear something in the din. A movement caught Natasha's eyes. People were trying to block someone from going on stage. Moments later, Loki darted out on the stage. Crying. He ran up to the men, holding his hands out for Steve.
"If it isn't a problem..."
"He think it is fun to be made to act like an animal?"
"Babysit?" The soldier asked.
"For all we know, this is Asgard's doing. If it is, and Thunder Pants knows..."
Eventually both of them crested the line and orgasmed together. In a tangle of limbs they held each other. The engineer breathed in the scent of the other man. Because he it could and it was right in front of him, he licked a muscle. Tasting the salt. Then he did again. And again. Feeling almost addicted. He stopped when there was a chuckle.
"I certainly thought about it, from time to time", she admitted. "But the only one I can imagine having a child with is Tony. And we are way passed that."
Life went on despite his heartbreak. He had decided to count his blessings rather than focus on the negative. As a result he at least managed to avoid turning to drinking himself to death. Unfortunately, his nightmares was making a return.
"Daddy!" Papa!" He cried and started running in a random direction. Had anyone of the daycare workers bothered to take him back to the playground, he would have been there in less than two minutes. Instead, he had been left on his own with only the vaguest of directions for a small child. Calling out to his fathers he cried as he ran.
"Hey", she said gently. "What is wrong?"
"What about those two?" The brother asked, almost dropping paint on Loki's paper. Making the Trickster try to fend him off.
, JARVIS said, sounding troubled,
"Okay, out with it", the engineer said. "What did you two talk about?"
Tony's eyes widened. "Because there is plenty of rooms in the penthouse... and she's a woman so it is more appropriate that it is you who..." he grinned. "You are surprisingly bright, Rogers!"
"I don't see the problem."
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!
Sadly, Steve had a feeling his husband was right. Though at the same time, he wanted the world to know that Tony Stark was
Hawkeye? These were Barton's kids? No wonder Tony had looked like a cat that had caught the rat. Well, at least Loki would have it a bit easier from now on.
"Best way to get only intelligent replies."
"Stark, Captain. Good", the Thunderer said. "I can not stay for long but I have news you need to hear."
The painting naturally was given space on the refrigerator. Tony had given their son so many complements it had been a bit silly. Though Steve admitted the smile had been worth it. Children should be praised, after all.
The boy didn't understand what they were talking about. He could tell they were upset about something and tried to cheer him up in his own way.
"Vaccines, huh?" Tony said, stroking his beard. "Couldn't hurt to get them done. Better safe than sorry and all that."
"Maaaaaybeee."
"Come on, apple pie. Let him rest."
"There is no such spell, your highness."
There was a chuckle against his throat. His husband placed kissed along his jaw before their lips met. Their tongues intermingled a bit. Slow and heavy. Then his neck was getting attention again. Tony didn't mind, it felt good after all.
"That's..."
"I think I read he was an art student before the war but I didn't know he was this skilled", the agent said.
"I'm going to be honest", Tony said while dozing off. "Some time soon, I'm going to lick every single muscle. Because I..." a snore told the blond his husband was out for the count. It had been a surprise, in the beginning, that the brunet was the type who could fall asleep immediately. He always gave the impression of being the type who takes hours to fall asleep.
"We are trying to avoid using profanity in front of Loki", his friend explained. "He pick stuff up like that too easily already."
Smiling the super soldier hugged his sleeping fiancé. They were quite the pair.
"You okay?" The soldier asked against his neck.
"Yeah, giving me a heart attack doing so."
"You think a siblings would be bad for Loki?"
Steve, wonderful, reliable, gentle, Steve, pulled him into a hug. Holding him while he sobbed. Not saying anything or trying to intervene. Because he understood. There was no way his husband didn't feel the same. Adult Loki had been a bit of a bastard, but raising him from a child showed all the potential he had always had. In many ways, they had started to think of the man who was as their kid just as much as the child he had become.
"Okay, okay", Tony said, backing away a bit. "Before anyone starts shooting arrows or bullets, or turning green, here us out first."
"How are you planning on getting married without them knowing?"
Still, it was now almost Christmas and they were still together. Trying to figure out how they could get some alone time during Christmas without drawing attention. They couldn't exactly go out on dates.
Inside the box were two watches. They looked about the same, just slightly different sizes, made of metal. Looking closer Tony noticed that the dial had been engraved with
"That's... I fell asleep and when I woke up, he was already eating", Banner said. "I have honestly no idea how he even got the food."
"Papa..." the small voice broke his heart and made him want to cry as well. He really hoped Steve would finish things up soon.
Steve hugged him a bit tighter. "You are doing wonderful as a father, Tony. Guiding and teaching him in a pace that suits him."
"Yes, that is super small. Not several kilometres in size."
"Someone is far more likely to barge in on me than you..." Steve said absentmindedly. Tony started swearing. "What is the problem?"
"I see my brother still enjoys causing trouble for others..."
Turning Bucky tried to keep the sun out of his eyes, grumbling to himself. Then he sat up straight. He was in a bed, and he knew who he was. Getting to his feet he saw he was in a nice room. Seemingly a guest room with an adjacent bathroom. There were even clothes prepared for him.
"It would depend on how he ended up like this", Tony said, eying the kid.
English, but he couldn't speak it. Because they walked with shoes on in the penthouse a lot of the time, or in slippers, he had gotten some comfortable slip-on shoes. They were soft enough that there shouldn't be an issue.
"Oh, cra.... cruds!" Tony exclaimed.
Barton paled and something flickered in his eyes. Touching his jaw carefully he refused to meet anyone's eyes.
Eyeing the boy again the black man shrugged. "Sure, I can take him to the hospital cafeteria but I have no idea what he is saying."
Loki whined and started crying again. Making even more snow fall. Steve hugged him, exchanging a look with his husband. They would have to address all this later. For now they had to give attention to their son. With some effort they managed to return to the penthouse.
Frigga caressed the leather cover, grief visible in her eyes. "The spell is basically making a demand of Fate. Saying that your life has been so miserable undeserved that you could go anywhere and be happier than the life you leave behind. That's the second condition of the spell. It doesn't work on someone who has been happy and satisfied most of their life.
Asgard was quiet without his brother. It had been the same during the awful year he had been believed dead. Except, now he was dead. Beheaded. Gone. Forever.
"No way!" The engineer gave him a wet kiss. "Though I admit I don't think I can take another round."
Washing his hands he intended to take the ground beef, he had started to learn to cook more. Before he could, there came a loud wail from the living room. Hurrying the engineer found his son crying loudly, sounding utterly destroyed. When he tried to get close to the boy, the tiny Trickster just flailed while he kept crying.
"Marriage licences, please. Thank you. By the power invested in me by the state of New York I hereby declare you married. Now get out of my office."
"Then pizza?"
Rude.
"Ah..." the soldier scratched his head. "Not much to do about it. I shouldn't have left it here, it's fine."
They had also discovered that the tiny god slept better if both of them took time to sit with him in the evening. Reading a bedtime story and just let him cuddle with them.
"Man, we are such saps..."
Rage bubbled up in the engineer's chest. "I will be back", he said, keeping his voice as calm as possible.
"Why?" Tony said, working on a blueprint. "He is being quiet, isn't he?"
"The analysis, it is done."
"Say it was one of the higher races that was given rebirth and ended up among the lower races. The ones who would race this child would gain the lifespan needed to see the child grow. They would also gain any strength or ability needed, even if just for a moment, to protect the child."
"It is nice", the engineer agreed. "We won't have much of this until the kid is older. Though I kind of dread the teenage years."
"You know", his husband said as he helped clean it up. "I had thought maybe the tiny spies would be able to be Loki's friends but it doesn't look like they mesh that well. They are not bad kids, Loki is just calmer than them. More careful."
"There are a few, actually. Pepper, Happy, Rhodey, and Steve's new buddy Sam. They've helped babysit a few times. Even bought him presents. It sometimes look like they are competing to see who is the best aunt slash uncle."
"Huh? Who knew. Have to find a different nickname then."
"This is my kid, they have seen him before. But done is done, next time we need a babysitter, we ask the usual troupe."
The words startled the brunet. He was starting to wonder is Steve was pulling a prank on him. Well, two could play that game.
"Want some lunch?"
Drawing his palm across his face the god of thunder felt powerless. Far more than he had as a mortal. On Midgard was a god of mischief that was both the same as his brother and completely different. With all likelihood, the Trickster had succeeded in casting the spell. And when he was beheaded, it had activated.
"Smooth talker, alright." Draining the rest of his drink Tony let himself be pulled out into the open space. There were no real finesse or technique to them dancing. They were just swaying from side to side. Until a twist started playing. Suddenly the engineer found himself being twirled around.

Thor couldn't understand what the mortal was trying to tell him. His brother had died, yes. But he was also alive, here. Why was that a bad thing?
Tony snorted, that would be a sight. Not that he had any intention of missing dinner. Instead he told his AI to alert him when it was time.
"I can take it", Steve offered as he was cleaning the table. "He doesn't usually makes this kind of mess, but it can happen."
The pressroom was filled with people. Natasha had positioned herself near the side. From there she could see the stage as well as the side. Giving her a glimpse of what was going on behind the scenes. Soon enough Tony made his way out on the stage. Several voices started shouting out questions one after another. Drowning each other out.
"What kind of questions was he asked?" The soldier asked. To someone who didn't know him, he seemed calm. Unaffected. But Tony knew his husband. Steve was tense, upset. Likely thinking about the small boy sleeping upstairs.
"What does it matter?" the blond snatched the sketchbook and closed it. This was his secret. His dirty little secret. Of course, his friend already knew.
Last night, he had wore it to the penthouse and had then taken it off. Apparently he had forgotten it. Well, there was nothing to it beyond going to fetch it.
Tony flipped through it, smiling when he saw the drawings of himself. Now he understood perfectly well why the soldier had been watching him so much. It also proved that their relationship didn't come out of nowhere. Well, for him a bit but still.
Now Barton was starting to look uncomfortable. He likely realised he had been outed. Then he crossed his arms and glared.
"I'm more worried about my penthouse, Loki would probably try and play with Hulk." Tony picked up his son. "And you, young man, is in need of a bath. You wanna come too, Steve?"
"You said you found him. Where?"
"Excuse me, Mr. Stark, Captain Rogers... who is that child?" They asked timidly.
"He isn't lying", the scientist said. Making the spies look at him. "I did an examination. Everything was a clear indication that Loki is indeed a child now. Hormone levels, growth pattern, reflexes. All of it is consistent with children around the age three and four."
Of course, he didn't tell anyone about Loki being alive and a small child on Midgard. There was no telling what the reaction would be to those news. Finally he gave up.
"Hey, did you want something?" The engineer said but the blond didn't say anything. Just walked closer. "Are you okay, Steve?" By now the soldier was standing right in front of him and of course he had to be tall. Blue eyes looked at him.
A few days later he was watching the news when suddenly...
It had been obvious that the boy in no way associated the toy with himself. According to Pepper, the Loki action figure was surprisingly popular on the market.
Later the same evening, as they got ready for bed, Tony jumped him. Claiming a kiss. He was more than happy to get into it, returning the kiss and caress the skin under the shirt. They had just laid down on the bed, while trying to take their clothes off, when JARVIS interrupted.
"Oh, Loki." Both men hugged the boy. Letting him just soak in their love for a little bit. "We don't mind if you want to talk to us. If we are in the middle of saying something, it is good to wait..."
Pausing the engineer looked up as his boyfriend carried the toddler over. Maybe he had warmed up to the soldier, because the kid was babbling happily. And it was nothing like English.
"You are right. I hope we can convince him..."
"Sure, uncle Bucky to the rescue", the man said and stood. Lifting the child into the air, making noises while walking swiftly. Loki held over his head. Causing the small god to shriek with laughter.
"There is many years until then, love. Let's focus on the here and now."
"The two of you are dating", Natasha said and flicked her hair. "Starting shortly after the fall of SHIELD. I'm not blind, this is what I was trained to do."
"What?"
"Here is a tip for you, Thunder Pants. Look up the concept of racism. You and the rest of your barbarian culture could do with learning a thing or two."
"Life can surprise us", Sam said. "And so can people. I don't really care, you know. They are adorable together."
"In Central Park", Steve said. "He came up to me on his own. Completely naked and very filthy. Using a blood sample we confirmed it was Loki."
"No need to explain", Steve said and made space for their son between them. Who happily settled. "I'm home."
They spent most of the night entwined, making love. Neither was very surprised the next morning when Pepper returned Loki while looking rather frizzy. A toddler or not, he was still the god of mischief.
"What is Jarv? Daddy is working."
His husband laughed and leaned in to kiss him. Without thinking he followed suit, exchanging a soft kiss. There was a strangled sound. Spoon halfway to his mouth Bucky was gaping. Looking from one to another.
"Everyone deserves a second chance."
His dream about flying suits turned into one about spiders crawling his arm. He then realised that something was actually touching him. Waking up abruptly Tony blinked into the dark room. By the bed stood Loki, teddybear in his arms. It was he who had woken the engineer.
"For what I have planned, it will only barely be enough."
"Wasn't that the watches?"
"Causing trouble? Thor, Barnes is having fun. After everything he has been through, this is more or less like therapy for him. Loki is actually quite considerate of others. Something has definitely picked up from Steve."
"Why would some try to steal a harmless drug?"
Well, what was the harm? Helping his son up they curled up together. The small body safe in his arms. One night wouldn't be a problem.
"Besides, I did give you permission to bury Barton in snow if he was being mean to you. But why didn't you tell us where you were going?"
"Did you wake up and thought you were all alone?" The tiny god nodded. Sitting down on the bed the soldier petted the black locks. It was always strange, remembering that even the worst person had once been a small child. Helpless and dependent on those around. "Do you want me to stay until you fall asleep?" Another nod. "Alright. Let me tell you a story..."
Just.
Tick tock, tick tock
(Go check out their other artwork!)
Tony scrabbles out of the covers in order to look at his chest and stomach.
And off they go, weather they knew or not, toward the second page.
Whatever was happening, this felt like it was only the beginning...
"Fine. But if this blows up in our faces, I'm blaming you." Everyone else nodded in agreement. Tony just looked hurt.
Nothing bad would happen if they kept a tiny piece of paper, right?
That was just another one of his nightmares...
. That's enough for them." The dark look dissipates as he turns to look back at the thin man who saved his hide.
Rhodey, and he's been disabled because of it! And no one fucks with his family, even if the ones who did it used to be a part of it.
Pepper steps forward too. "Yeah! You've been gone for three months!"
Thanos, still wounded from the Jotun's surprise attack, jumped and whipped around just in tome to see a wretched half-dead thing crawl into view.
