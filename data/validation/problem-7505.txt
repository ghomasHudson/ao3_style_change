“Clint-” Natasha started.
“Yeah…” Tony looked down and his eyes darted around for a few seconds. “Ok!” He made his way over to Bucky. “I appreciate the apology, and consider it water under the bridge.” Bucky looked shocked as Tony lightly slapped his shoulder.
“...Mame, yes Mame.” Steve responded teasingly after a few seconds.
“Last warning. Hands up!” The leader ordered.
“Yeah. Sure. Here, in the middle of the road.” Natasha said in a monotone. “Perfect place to stop.”
“Is that...Howard?” Bucky asked looking the man over.
After Tony had started to earn some years of freedom he had made a “To Do” list of sorts. Things he wanted to see or do in the human world. He had it hung up by his tally paper in his room.
Meanwhile in the Palace of Hel, Loki discarded another scroll then grabbed a new one from the pile.
Steve, however, could. As the blonde didn’t respond. The only indication he even heard Tony was that his eyes crinkled and he frowned.
2. The Avengers all pranking each other is canon! And so I had to make sure it's known that even in this AU they all give each other shit :3
“They already know him. He has a relationship with them.” Loki explained and Tony sputtered nonsense while Amora scoffed.
“Hang on Steve, let me help you with that.” A pair of older and stronger arms grabbed the other side of the lumbar, “We don’t want another accident.” Together they walked it over to the sawing bench. “Do we?”
Steve shook his head in the negative over and over, chanting denials under his breath.
“How about this?” Loki offered, putting his silver tongue to good use. “If I or anyone who works for me hurts or harms Tony in any way, then you all get your strengths back, instantly.”
“If you are trying to rile me up I would advise against it.” Loki seethed as he glared at Amora who smiled guileslly.
“I took it seriously.” Thor stated with exaggerated seriousness. “Your form could really use help.”
“Almost 5 sir.”
Tony took in a deep gulp of air, then a few more to get his breathing back to normal.
” Tony yelled back with such conviction and pure anger that everyone was taken aback and shocked into silence.
Tony then led the three into his house. However, they didn’t make it far. They stopped in his garden and looked at the Loki statue, then all eyes turned to Thor.
“Loki?” Thor called hesitantly. “Is this a jest? An illusion?” He waved his hand into the room but didn’t actually step in. “Are you attempting to bury me in books when I hit the stack that you’ve magiced away from my sight?”
The two stayed clinging to each other for quite some time. Eventually the tears subsided and Maria begged for answers. Tony found he couldn’t tell her the whole truth. He didn’t want to. He couldn’t bring himself to sully the moment. So he told her the bare minimum. He had been living in Hel and now was able to return to the land of the living.
“Sorry about that!” Bruce rushed, “Thor’s just eager and energized in everything he does.”
“Aren’t they all restless?” Loki groaned as he rose and beckoned the minion to lead on.
“I heard you got new curtains and I wanted to check them out.” He joked which earned him a rough chuckle from the girl.
5. Timeline updated: Tony was sacrificed at 8 years old, 2 years later the war ended (Tony’s now 10), 1 year after that the Starks move into Steve’s city (Tony’s now 11), roughly 5 years after that is when Chap 2 takes place (Tony’s now 16). About 2 years later Peggy dies (Tony’s now 18ish).
“I do understand.” Steve came closer. “But I won’t let you.” He smiled and Tony’s heart jumped a little. “I... I love you Tony.” He confessed blushing at the tips of his ears.
' Steve needed to get this figured out.
“Talk with him.”
“Yes.” Howard grabbed Maria in a hug as she seemed to slump into herself. “But I want us to have a nice family breakfast.”
“Loki…” Thor said and reached out a hand towards his lover.
“I’m not trying to be a
“Let me know if it gets too much for you.” Steve said in a gentle and quiet tone.
“Amora got into your head.” He muttered and Loki whirled on him.
She rolled her eyes and gave out a monotone “No”
“How are you? Feeling better?” Betty asked.
Of course the feeling and idea were conflicting. Steve and Tony rarely agreed with anything immediately, this should’ve been no different. But it was. It was different. The idea and feeling couldn’t be debated. In this instance one had to win and the other lose. A compromise was not available.
“Long story-”
“Wait,” Steve realized “Isn’t that your motto?”
Thor closed his eyes in pain, he was right. He did know how this would play out. He, like all of them, now knew how Tony had come into Loki’s possession.
“Steve....” Sam said as his eyes took in just how much blood was on the ground around them and soaked into Tony’s chiton. The dark skinned man bit his lip as he looked over Tony’s unmoving form.
“Why does Loki want us dead, when he knows we didn’t sleep with Thor? Why did Tony say he didn’t report anything, when Loki clearly knew all of our greatest strengths and how to put us in a disadvantage? How did Tony know about Peggy? Why did Tony doubt my feelings? How did Loki own Tony? How....How did all this happen?!”

“Oh please! Steve, we had to wait for you and Bucky to file for separation before we even thought of planning our wedding.” They both laughed but it fell flat shortly after.
“I hear whistling.” Steve reported staring into the fog to try and see what the whistling was coming from.
Sorry for the delay! The end and beginning of the month is a busy time for me at work.
“All those weapons and they did you nothing.” He taunted. “Best if we take them. Then they’d actually get some use.”  The other bandits laughed at this as Bucky glared harshly at the man.
Steve had been dreading and anticipated this moment. He was changing himself, which felt wrong. But he was changing himself for the better. He would be able to help people in his new form, he would get Peggy back thanks to his new form. He was ready to change. He gave the final nod and Erskine tipped the liquid out of the vial.
“Ok, I may have a plan.”
The Hydra lunged at Bucky but Steve jumped in front of his friend and grabbed the monster by its teeth. He wrestled with it as the monster kept trying to twist its head free and lunge at them.
As Clint explained this his fingers pointed to dust patterns that appeared disturbed or outlined where a box once sat.
“Well it needs to. Does Lord Thor even know he’s this upset?”
“I own you, what you want doesn’t matter.” Loki said coldly causing Tony to physically flinch and avert his gaze to the floor.
“Natural disaster?” Sam questioned.
They broke up.
After a few more words were exchanged. Rhodey, Tony, and Jarvis had convinced Loki that Tony and himself would benefit from Tony spending some time and energy up in the land of the living. Tony was vibrating with excitement at Loki’s agreement. But it was dampened when Loki announced he wouldn’t let Rhodey go with him. Instead he would be accompanied by a disguised underworld minion. He was also only allowed out for the remainder of the current day, at 7pm he would be transported back to Hel.
“I think you’re odd.”
The Avengers really talked Steve up, and often.
“If I knew their weaknesses this would be easier.” Loki muttered quietly then stopped pacing and turned that over in his head. “I need their weaknesses.”
“Steve…” Nat began but didn’t finish.
Once inside they encouraged Steve to vent his frustration. Then Bucky and Howard joined in, venting their frustration, sadness, and anger over Peggy’s passing as well.
“That guy doesn’t understand what the word NO means, nor does he seem to understand anatomy.” Tony gestured to himself and a chuckle bubbled out of Loki.
From what they saw he could tell Loki did care about Tony. However, Thor knew better than anyone how Loki could be with emotions and relationships of any sort.
Tony let out a small and wet final breath. His eyes stopped twitching to open and instead remained shut. His entire body tried to slump down to the earth. He was gone.
“Water from Asgard is going to change me?” Steve asked skeptically.
“Are you sure you should be taking Tony? He’s so young and a battlefield is so dangerous.” Maria asked worriedly as she set the table for breakfast.
“I saw you talking to Lord Loki about targeting Steve. Hunting him!” Bucky was enraged and stepped closer to Tony who rolled his eyes.
In reference to Chapter 1 “The Deal” and Rhodey’s immediate “adoption” of Tony.
“Yeah. But about my statue?”
“Get lost buddy.” Ty called, being the first to recover from Steve’s entrance. He then ripped Tony’s pin off, causing Tony to yelp and give a cry of ‘Hey!’ “This is a private matter.”
“Clints right.” Steve spoke briskly, commanding everyone's attention. Everyone turned to the small blonde, who raised his head and squared his shoulders. “We need to get Jörmungandr focused on us and not on the people in the city.” Steve strode over so he was in front of everyone.
“Look it’s not my fault!” Tony cried. “It’s all thanks to this wonder-boy Steve Rogers!” Tony held the blue cape forward as if it proved his point.
However, on occasion, the hero's directed the tours; especially when they wanted to annoy another fellow hero. Bucky had started it by promising everyone “A flight in the sky with The Falcon!” at the end of the tour, which he had promised without Sam’s permission or knowledge. So at the end of the tour, Sam was ambushed by fans all ready to be shown the skies. Sam had later retaliated and it had snowballed from there.
“No! No!” Tony jumped in waving his arms around as if to wave off the thick air of tension that had descended. “No! It’s not like that!” He then groaned and let out a breath. “Let me explain. Bruce and Betty are dating and not in the creepy self imposed way, in the mutual consenting way.”
Thor turned to the crestfallen and heartbroken mortals, then back to Loki’s cold emerald eyes. Thor steeled himself and glared at Loki.
“He lied to Amora.” Clint said after a few minutes of silence.
“Then help me!” Loki demanded. “Tell me their weaknesses.”
(See the end of the chapter for
When Tony was about 15 Loki had offered an overseer position to his friend and one-sided rival Amora. Amora was an immortal that did not warrant the status of goddess, instead she was just at the level of witch. She had lusted after Thor for as long as Loki could remember but Thor never had any desire to be with Amora. Still she pursued him and even befriended Loki in hopes of becoming closer to the blonde god. Loki, however, was no fool and did not let her out match him. That being said he did enjoy her company and would count her as a friend.
“I’ve been trying to.” Steve all but whined.
Upon arriving in Asgard, Thor was greeted by his mother. Odin was still cooling down after his and Thor’s argument and was in no mood to see his son. Frigga however, saw the pain and desperation on her child's face and bade him to explain what happened. She drew Thor into her garden and beckoned him to sit on an offered bench. She then went and stood behind him. Thor told his mother how a dear friend of his had just died and how he needed Odin to bestow the title of True Hero upon the hero he had been boasting about as of late, Steve Rogers.
“He never mentioned that!” Bruce defended holding his hands up in surrender.
“We do get invited to
“Your sight.” He pointed a finger at Clint. “Your acrobatics.” the finger moved to Natasha “Your power” Bruce. “Your wings.” Sam. “Your weapon skills.” Bucky. “And,” The finger moved to Steve and Loki glowered. “Everything you gained from that Asgardian water.”
“I guess it’s true. Humans really do do crazy things when they're in love.” She mocked.
“Thor, Thor!” Steve waved his hand in front of the gods eyes, causing said god to blink rapidly. “We need you to focus here. He’s scared of your thunder and lightning. So we need you to scare him away.”
“You are many things Steve Rogers, but you are not useless!” Tony stressed and felt the blonde slowly smile behind his hand. Tony smiled as he released Steve’s face. He then bodily shook himself. “Now I’m seriously parched. Let’s get a drink!”
Thor let out a chuckle then bit down on his lover’s neck.
“Lord Loki!” Rhodes yelled.
“Did it ever occur to you that this is their home?” Tony shot back, his hands on his hips. “You’re literally breaking into their home to kill one of them. So of course they’re going to try and kill you!”
It happened upon their city like a plague. What caused it or the rapid spread of it was not known but it had claimed many lives. Once the disease started spreading all of Steve’s friends immediately began to worry about him. Peggy, Howard, and Bucky had kept him indoors and in as sterile environments as possible. They were lucky that none of them or their family had been touched by the disease but then Peggy began to cough. It developed quickly after that and she pushed them all away. She wouldn’t take them down with her, she had said.
“Ah, yes….” Thor scratched the side of his face. When Thor failed to elaborate, the three mortals shared confused glances but Thor only coughed into his hand. “Didn’t you say something about a drink?”
“Bucky almost got us lost.” Steve said in a horse voice.
Eventually Rhodey decided to pick out his own bedroom and to start unpacking some of Tony’s stuff. An hour or so after Rhodey left him and Tony alone, Tony woke up.
“It can be.” the older man said devoid of emotion, as if stating a fact. “All who I knew have long since passed, and if I remained among all of you.” He gestured to the horizon. “No doubt I would draw concern. A man that ages so slowly and knows so much.” He shook his head in the negative “I’d rather avoid it.” Both boys nodded in agreement then Erskine threw them a smile. “Plus sometimes Odin and Frigga come visit me so it’s never too lonely.”
“Let me guess, a play about the Avengers heroic exploits?” He smiled and Steve blanched at the guess.
Steve laughed and scratched the back of his head. “That’s fine.”
“I was punished for your misdoings!” She shouted clearly, for all to hear. “But in that punishment I found a gift.” She looked at Asterion and smiled. “My son.” She then turned to glare at Minos. “I couldn’t help him much then but I can now!” She turned to the court and gathered crowd. “What the Avengers say is true! Every word of it! I will not be silent anymore!” She turned and sent a glare full of hatred at Minos. “I will protect my son from you in every way that I can!”
Steve’s eyebrows lifted slightly and then his face smoothed out in understanding.
Loki nodded his head in appeasement and the room’s temperature was quickly approaching it’s normal level again. “Excellent. You’ve earned your 2 years.”
“Are you serious?” Sam cut in, coming to Steve’s defense.
“So Tony, what’s your last name?”
Immediately a thick air of tension wrapped around the group of humans. Finally Natasha spoke up, her tone pure ice.
“We must have him over!” Thor declared.
“Why are you doing this?” Steve finally asked. “Why pit monsters against us?!”
“They are close to me, I have-”  Thor began to explain, but Loki’s growl interrupted him,
It’s a Winter Falcon blurb not a full fledged story, so keep that in mind. It’s a blurb of how I picture Sam and Bucky’s relationship going down in the Hercules AU
“He’s such a great hero!”
Now was no different.
Loki looked Steve over critically for a breath then in the next he pulled the Scepter back and made ready to strike it into Steve.
“I need Steve Rogers weakness.” He stalked over and watched the Avengers gladhand the crowd. “He’s not like most heroes, I need to make a targeted attack but in order to do that I need to know his weakness. I need to know what to exploit.”
“I’m not saying he’s dead!” Clint rushed. “Just that he didn’t make it there! Maybe he ran into trouble on the road.”
“I’m ok, just a little property damage.”
“We go in, get Asterion out, make it look like we killed him. Then we tell the king we sacrificed the Minotaur’s body to the gods.”
After his friends stopped their heckling Steve explained how Tony had helped sneak him out of the house. Though he didn’t elaborate on how they got out, just in case he needed to use that escape route again. He then told them about going out to eat, disguising himself, and how the rest of the day went.
“Then let’s head back. Hopefully Bruce and Thor will be back with Tony by the time we get there.” Natasha said as she walked out of the room.
“Thor!”
And so the Avengers all took off to their different posts.
“Good job, but move your elbow,” Steve grabbed the woman's elbow and elevated it a bit. “There. Perfect, now try the jab again.”
“Thor’s a god! God’s don’t interfere in mortal affairs but he’s with you guys. All. The. Time!” Tony stressed. “It’s pretty easy to put two and two together.”
“You should have said!” Thor screamed as he fired off another bolt of lightning.
4. Do not expect accurate Ancient Greece anything in this fic. We are going off Disney Hercules here. Historical accuracy is not the point. On that note there’s gonna be some Greek/Norse mythology mashup and remixes in this.
“YOU’RE GOING THE WRONG WAY!” The voice yelled.
(See the end of the chapter for
Thinking of that sent Tony on another spiral. Did any regular people know about Thor and Loki’s tiff? Or was it not known so regular people still assumed they are together and happy? Did the Avengers even know? Or do they just not care, since they’re bedding the god themselves?
“I’m sorry I put you in that place.” He said it so earnestly and full of meaning that Tony felt his heart do a small jump.
“Was there any sign of a break in?” Natasha asked after Sam and Steve explained they found the house empty.
“You could have told me! You should have told me!” Thor yelled, increasing in volume as he went on. “I could have helped!”
Special shout out to the following people who have repeatedly commented <3
As Bucky opened the door, he made to yell out a greeting when he overheard a foreign but oddly familiar male voice. He felt like he heard it before but couldn’t quite place it. Silently he crept into the house towards the foreign voice.
“What happens to them?” Bucky asked.
Steve felt like he had whiplash, he felt so disoriented.
“This is a binding contract of Hel James. These laws are older than me and possibly even Odin. You may tell him, but you will not like the result.”
“He’s never been temporary!” Steve seethed.
“It’s a shade.” Steve observed, “Shade’s can’t lie. This must be Styx. We must have to wait here.”
“I did!” Steve smiled back at her, then he cringed remembering the end of the date. “Till I stuck my foot in my mouth.”
“Some hero!” Steve scoffed. “I finally feel like I can help people, and we have!” Steve amended but continued on, frustrated. “But every time it comes to someone I love….I’m left helpless!” He gave Bucky an anguished look. “I thought I’d be at least able to protect Tony. Now that I have all this power.” He looked at his hands in anger and frustration.
“And you so easily chose him over me! ME!” Loki shot back, rounding on Thor.
Tony.”
“It’s not about worthiness Steve, it’s about knowing who you are.” The old man finally said. “My teachings are just that, teachings. There's no code of conduct, no creed. I share my knowledge and then it’s yours to use. So I must be careful with who I share this knowledge with. Because knowledge is power and power is consuming.” Steve gave a nod of understanding. “Power amplifies everything within a person. So, good becomes great. Bad becomes worse.”
Once the Ferry pulled up alongside the bank, the Avengers boarded and were met by the female shade. However, before anyone could begin talking a loud bang was heard as a hulking ogre clumbered out of the captains quarters.
The mousy brunette gave Steve a smile in gratitude and let out a breath of nerves.  “Thank you Steve, really.”
Thor rolled his eyes “You could have just told me up front you want me to go fetch this...whatever it is.”
“So, how do you two know each other?” Sam asked.
“Good Man! Now tonight we get drunk!” They shared a small chuckle at the decree and continued walking back to the others. .
However the story didn’t end there. Later the king urged Sam to go deliver something to a local ruler about a day's journey away. Sam had gone, but with his wings, was able to cut the time in half. Upon his return he found Riley tied to a stone about to be devoured by a sea monster. Sam distracted the monster long enough for the princess to free Riley. Riley then ran to grab his shield and sword and joined Sam in slaying the monster
“He’s the real deal.”
Suddenly Bucky stopped in his tracks and let out a few swears. Natasha and Steve shared a confused look but couldn’t see anything wrong.
“One year to get me the Avengers weaknesses.”
“What?” Thor gaped.
Amora chuckled and nodded her head in agreement. Tony meanwhile frowned at the immortals but then turned back to the fight. It was clear that Steve was taking charge of the fight. He was giving directions and orders and seemed to be setting them up for something.
Sorry for the delay! Last week was crazy at work!
“Outside of town” Tony rushed throwing an arm off into the distance “In the gorge. I was walking and saw the rockslide. A terrible rockslide!” Tony gasped appearing to have a hard time catching his breath. The crowd around them grew as more people came to investigate what was happening, but the group of hero’s attention was zeroed in on Tony. “I heard screaming and people are trapped! Alive but trapped! They need help!”
“Then I’m glad we intervened.” Steve cut in, a serious look in his eyes and tone.
Tony merely coughed up blood in response, Steve managed to make a pained sound as he saw the blood hit the sand. And that made Amora feel particularly gleeful.
“I’m so thirsty.” Tony admitted into the silence, causing Steve to laugh.
Rhodey and a shade name Edwin Jarvis, who Tony had grown particularly close to, had then ran into the room.
Steve didn’t even try to move. He had turned his face away from Tony after Loki’s abrupt exit and hadn’t looked back.
“What were y-” Steve grabbed his mouth and gave him the signal to be quiet.
“DAMNIT! YOU’LL BE STUCK HERE IF YOU DON’T WAIT!”
“We have a new mission we must get to right away. However,” Phil looked pointedly at Thor. “You cannot join us. This is a political issue as well as a physical one and a god-”
“What?!” Everyone gasped, and Bruce’s face was now as red as a tomato.
“Probably.” Sam answered with a shrug. “But I get what you mean. I want to put that training to the test.”
“I learned it from you.” Tony added letting the victory smirk overtake his face.
Howard continued to shuffle the papers around then paused when he realised he didn’t hear any movement. “Steve?” Howard searched the room and found the thin blonde male just standing there, his eyes unfocused. Howard let out a heavy breath then walked over to the blonde. “Steve?” Howard asked in a more gentle tone.
“Don’t bother denying it.” He growled.
“But that isn’t Fandral.” Tony had joked which earned him a scathing look.
“Please!” Bucky stressed shoving Steve lightly. “We can turn this around for you.” At Steve’s less than believing stare, Bucky only puffed up his chest. “You have the Master of Seduction on your side now.”
More people began filing into the gorge but they all hung back, seeming to want to see these 5 people in action.
“The Mists of Knowledge has ensnared them. They’ll be stuck in there forever” Rhodey looked all around to see if there was anyway he could cross Styx quickly to save the mortals.
“Steve!” Tony cried as Steve hit his sweet spot. The blonde then kept hitting it over and over, and Tony draped his arms around Steve’s shoulders to pull his face in. “Faster!” He moaned and Steve complied.
“Then change.” Loki interrupted, waving his hand so a new chiton magicked itself onto Tony’s body. This one was still red (a color Tony was fond of) but it was only pinned on one shoulder instead of both. Tony looked at his partially exposed chest and glared at the god who smirked back at him.
Thor looked gobsmacked and Amora had to quickly hide the widening of her own eyes at Loki’s announcement.
She had long curly red hair that fell past her shoulders. Instead of a warriors dress she appeared to be wearing a form fitting chiton that was black with splotches of red on it. She also didn’t appear to have any weapons on her. But the red splotches were definitely blood so she had weapons somewhere on her, they just didn’t appear to be visible.
“Then you’ll all get your strength back.” Tony shrugged and Steve grabbed his arm in what he meant to be a tight grip (however with his current strength it failed).
“No.” The centaur and the Avengers breathed.
Howard's eyes widened at the implication. “You...you mean…?”
“I have not laid with any but Loki”
“Yup!” Tony laughed. “Like an old, old,” Rhodey grabbed a pillow, “OLD father to m-ACK!” Rhodey nailed the brunette in the face.
Tony let a few seconds pass, “They didn’t lie.” Loki sucked a breath in through his nose. “You don’t believe Thor, fine! But Steve wouldn’t lie to me!”
Loki, now calmer, scoffed and made his way to his throne. As he walked his skin began to turn back to it’s pale white shade and his eyes faded back to their emerald green. Once seated, his skin was completely pale and his eyes green.
(See the end of the chapter for
“You think I’ll let you earn freedom after this?! After you’re betraying me?!”
Tony snarled at her and pulled on his arms which Sam and Bruce had thoroughly restrained. He couldn’t break out of their hold and they were unable to relent in the slightest.
Loki was around 18 now so Tony and Rhodey called the airports nearby and made sure to have them check for Loki and not allow him to board any planes. Then they were all on foot and in cars scouring New York for the teenager.
Tony looked around the room he had ended up in and his eyes landed on Steve’s old blue cape, which he had thrown over a couch after wearing it previously.
“It was given to me...a gift from the gods.”
“Son of a bitch!” Amora yelled and Loki had begun turning blue in anger as the second head fell limp.
“They think you’re a monster! They think you’re trying to trick them!” He then whipped back towards the two humans.
“So I must kill someone? Does it have to be anyone specific?”
“Just jealous heros who want the fame you all have.”
None of the Avengers looked back at him or said anything to him as they slowly made their way out of the Arena.
Once they got to the other side, Happy helped Tony off the boat. Happy had to push and pull Tony through a few shades as they had all seemed to stop in their tracks. And it wasn’t hard to figure out what struck-dumb all the new shades.
Loki looked exactly like his depictions. He was tall, slim yet fit, had two horns growing from his head of black hair, angry red eyes, and he had blue skin that seemed to radiate cold. Next to him was Thor, god of Thunder and Fertility. He had on a warriors dress, complete with a red cape. He was every bit the grand image of a god. However, his blonde hair was in complete disarray.
Steve’s eye twitched and he rolled his shoulders. Then in a serious no nonsense tone he stated. “Last warning, release the young-”
Tony flinched imperceptibly but Rhodey caught it and raised an eyebrow. Tony popped up and moved towards the doorway leading to the kitchen.
Steve tried to wrap his arms around the numerous pieces of lumbar he was attempting to carry and grunted under the effort.
“You know Loki.” He said, his smug expression never wavering. “He gets so jealous, of everything! Look at the Avengers here.”
Pushing open the door, Thor jolted to a stop. For almost a decade Loki’s room had become a cluster of scrolls, books, and writings about Hel. Every surface had become covered -even the bed. And Loki refused to move the items to any other room. However today, Loki’s chambers were clear. No scrolls or books stuffed into every nook and cranny possible, no overflowing stacks of paper precariously stacked on tables. Everything was as it once was years ago.
“Uh…” Steve was dumbfounded then coughed and tried to recover his composure. “Sir you may be too close-”
Thor nodded in understanding, while Steve gave Tony a startled and concerned look.
“Who’s Tony?” Thor asked
This wasn’t like the first break up, this was worse. Steve’s side and Tony’s side didn’t interact, save Thor. And it stayed that way.
“And how will Thor feel if you kill us? Not great I’m guessing.” Clint added.
“Next thing we come across is mine.” Sam called as his friends met him halfway.
“Tony! No! It’s not like that!” Steve tried to run out to the fog, but Bucky and Sam held him back.
“Would you have tried harder?” She joked and that earned her a bark of laughter from the thin man.
“WHAT?!” Loki screeched, his skin instantly flushing blue and his eyes a blood red.
“That’s so lame!” Clint complained.
“Let’s just get moving! We’ve wasted enough time already.” He marched back towards the wooded area. “To New Thebes City, let’s go!”
Steve and Thor shouted back, both looking annoyed at having this brought up again. Rhodey glanced at Loki who looked unconvinced then turned to Pepper who shrugged.
Tony, the young child that he was, had a hard time accepting his new normal. Accepting that his Father sold him for his own purpose. Accepting that he’d probably never see his Mother again. Accepting that he had lost all right to do what he wanted. His freedom was only to the extent that Loki allowed it.
“You will be damning them for all eternity. They will live out their mortal life in your current spot here in Hel and then when they die, they’ll take their own place in Hel.”
“Then I’ll drag you back to Hel. And you will remain there for the rest of your life. And when you die you will spend the rest of eternity there! Is that what you want?!” Loki screamed, his eyes looking angry and desperate.
“Told me what?” Bucky asked gently as he sat next to the blonde.
“It’s his motto! Abandoning me! Selling ME! IS HIS MOTTO!” He screamed. “Never look back, only forward!” He screamed again. “ASSHOLE!”
“Oh,” Tony said slowly, eyes still unfocused. “
“It’s a great idea-!”
That triggered a memory in Steve’s head. “That reminds me of when we first met.” Steve said to Tony. Tony sat up straighter, giving Steve all his attention, and Rhodey’s eyebrows wrinkled. “Bucky said something along those lines. And you ripped him apart.” Steve smiled in a teasing manner and Tony let out a huff of laughter. “But here your friend is saying the same thing.”
“Excuse me Steve.” The high ranking court member who had interrupted them said.
“NO!” Steve flew an arm out. “Did you see his face?!” Suddenly Steve’s face turned to anguish as he flashed back to when they were at Thor’s temple. “And he still thinks that…… He died for me, while thinking I was using him.”
“Yeah we came to get in and get out.” Clint agreed, “Stopping by and “chatting”” Clint threw up air quotes. “with Loki may put a halt to the get out part of our plan.”
“Great.” Steve then turned to Phil and Betty.
So now the 5 all traveled towards the Monster Bog. An area in Greece where most of the monsters of their world gathered. Many people wishing to test their might traveled into the swampland, only to never emerge or to run from it in horror.
“Shouldn’t and can’t get involved.” Thor finished lazily. “Very well I will sit this adventure out. Good luck my friends.” Phil didn’t give out anymore details of the mission till Thor left the premise.
Steve blinked after him and assumed having sex was not the first thing. Since he clearly just shot the blonde down; seemingly without even noticing that’s what Steve was offering.
Then when Steve and Tony were out to lunch one day they met Thor Odinson. The three became fast friends. Thor was unbelievable! A man that shouldn’t exist in this world but somehow did. He was free with his affection, stronger than any person Steve or Tony had ever met, and was so generous he made Tony feel stingy. Steve and Tony knew they had to show Thor off to their friends and thus both friend groups finally converged.
“This is perfect.” Clint quipped and Tony’s face quickly fell into one of absolute incredulity.
“Not Steve!” Tony shot back. “He’s willing to throw glory away if it means doing the right thing! He defends everyone! He’s a True Hero even if you gods don’t give him the title! He’s more than earned it!”
“Maybe. Don’t you have a job to be doing?” He countered with a smirk.
“Do you think I’m sleeping with Thor?” Steve asked giving Tony’s arms a slight jostle to try and keep the brunette out of his own head.
“Oh come on Steve.” Tony grabbed the front of Steve’s clothing and yanked him down to his eye level. “Play hookey with me.” Tony’s eyes sparked with mischief and Steve found himself returning the smile the brunette gave him “We’ll go out the window, round the dumbells, you lift up the back wall and we’re gone.” He thumbed the window and Steve nodded in agreement.
“Takes some getting used to, trust me.” Bucky chuckled and Steve blushed as both of them began comparing his new form to his previous one.
Howard then got up and walked towards the entrance. Tony gave a cry and tried to get up but fumbled and by then Howard was out the entryway. Tony cried again then got up and made to run out the entrance but Loki’s magic grabbed his feet and held him from running away.
“Can’t take credit for that. I’m shit at art. All the art was already here.”
Tony thought in a panic as he leaned closer, ready and more than willing to kiss Steve.
Tony marched back to his allotted bedroom all the time berating himself in his head.
Tony then poured some olive oil over his hands and spread his legs as he reached around himself. When Steve made an inquisitive noise the brunette smirked then told him to watch and learn. He then got up and sat back down with his back to Steve’s chest and made the blonde watch as he prepared himself. First with one finger, then two. By three, Steve had a tight grip of the brunette’s waist. Using it as leverage to stop himself from thrusting up and rubbing his now achingly hard erection against Tony’s open entrance. On Tony’s signal Steve coated his dick with some olive oil, which did not help his aching erection. Once Tony gave the all clear he was surprised when Steve motioned and helped turn him around so they were chest to chest.
Right on que the fog began forming Tony and Loki standing in front of each other.
“So that’s why Loki always got angry when I would pop in for an unplanned visit.”
Loki thought, anger budding up under his annoyance the more he thought about it.
“Once again you underhanded me!” Loki yelled. “In my own realm! You underhanded me!”
New York City was a strange city and at times it seemed like a whole different world. In what other place could a boy from Brooklyn and a billionaire meet? This could happen in no other place than the Big Apple.
1. Tony’s panic attacks strike again.
“What are you doing here?” Tony asked tiredly.
“YOU?!” Loki immediately threw a glare at the blonde and Thor threw his arms up. “Sorry.”
, kill them!”
“Sort of.” Betty answered.
Tony knew this was a sensitive subject to her. After spending so many years together, after years of her needling all his insecurities. Tony had observed and learned where Amora’s weaknesses were. And he was ready to exploit all of them.
And to all over 200 of you that left kudos, thank you again! :D
“Steve! I can’t help if I don’t know where we’re at.”
“How do you guys call Thor?”
“Tony, look at me.” Rhodey said, bending so as to make it easier. “This is your mother...I know you have wanted to see her.” Tony choked down a pained sound “And now you will….it will be ok.”
The Avengers were given up front spots closests to the cloth covered statue. Tony stood next to Steve but a few paces back as the blonde had to gladhand the crowd for a bit of time before the official unveiling took place. Finally a man approached the podium and requested silence as he began his speech. Tony tuned the speech out as he scanned the crowd around them.
“It’s time for you to go.” Peggy declared. She gave Steve’s face one last caress. “Goodbye my darling.”
“Tony! Tony! It’s alright. It’s ok.” He tried to reassure as he jumped down and gently placed the trembling brunette on the sand. He then grabbed his old cape that Tony wore and took it off so it didn’t obstruct Tony’s breathing.
Tony bit his bottom lip to hide his smile; but then felt the bottom of his stomach drop.
“Come.” Loki grabbed Howard’s arm and in a swirl of green mist transported them back to his throne room.
“No I’ll do it. Just wait here.” He commanded then slowly trudged back up the walkway. Distantly he heard Natasha yell something to Clint and Sam but couldn’t make it out.
Tony squatted down in the dirt and drew out a crude map. “You guys will act as bait leading him to the harbor. Thor you’ll be there waiting for us, but out of sight. Once we have him at the water, that’s when you reveal yourself. Cut off his retreat so he has nowhere to go but out into the water. Then push him further and further out into the sea. If you keep laying on the lightning and thunder, eventually he’ll just turn tail and head back to Hel to hide.”
“I know.”
“No listen!” Tony practically begged because he noticed Loki putting up his walls. “Thor’s been loyal to you this entire time!”
Meanwhile Natasha grabbed Bucky’s sword and ran to the beasts neck. Clint gave her a boost and the redhead was launched into the air.
Tony gave a casual shrug and his chiton came undone. “Ah damn!” He muttered as he grabbed the fabric and tried to tie it back up “You know,” He shrugged again, “Sometimes these things happen.” He said to Sam’s question.
Finally Pepper and the Avengers reached a rocky outcropping. And near one of the boulders they spotted a shade.
Bucky was close now, he could see Tony’s back but a pillar blocked his view of the other male.
Steve blinked owlishly. Traveling to the realm of the dead was impossible, to even consider it was beyond his imagination.
“Centaurs can say it.” Rhodey cut in. “Tony was right to correct your friend.” Rhodey gave a passing look over to Bucky, who averted his eyes and took a large pull from his drink.
Tony continued knowing this was the belly of the beast. This was Amora’s biggest weakness. “Something to laugh at as you so desperately try to get Thor to just look at you!”
“Well that’s not happening.” Tony dismissed but Pepper rolled on.
“Thor will know-” Loki began but Tony cut him off.
After a pregnant pause where they both just stared at each other Steve eventually broke away and glanced at the water. Steve seemed to make a decision of some sort because his chest puffed up and then he looked back at Tony with a determined look in his eyes.
“I knew you’d react this way.” Loki sighed in exasperation.
Meanwhile, in Hel Loki was still fuming over the battle he witnessed.
“He basically stole my kill. But I let it slide since I saved his ass and can lord that over him forever.”
“Ty?!” Tony yelled in outrage. “Are you kidding me?!”
Tony looked stricken and hurt. He had actually stopped moving as a result of Steve’s words. Steve however hadn’t stopped. He just continued marching towards the temple.
“Really?”
However, all Tony’s lips met was air.
Thor wrapped Loki in an embrace and tried to sooth his brother. Loki didn’t look happier but he stopped trying to run. He walked away with Thor who thanked all his friends for their help. Once he and Loki were in a car, driving home Tony turned to Steve and apologized.
3. Happy is not a Shrek like ogre but more like an orc looking one.
“They’ve definitely been with Thor, look at those moves.” Amora muttered taking stock of the mortals. Loki growled at her comment and glared harder at the battle.
Eventually the travelers agreed and once they were all loaded up, the Avengers watched them leave then turned and began their trek back to New Thebes.
Thor then put the statue down and gave it a hard stare. “I suppose you are just a statue.”  The blonde shook his head “I am acting foolish.” He admitted out loud then made his way back toward the entrance where he left his mortal friends.
“I was here last night and again this afternoon and never saw your friend come through here.” The guard answered. “But I’ll keep my eyes open for him.”
Eventually they all relaxed in the skylight room with some water and fruit. Rhodey had lounged on some of the pillows on the floor. Tony then walked over and leaned against Rhodey’s horse side in a comfortable and relaxed pose. It appeared to all the Avengers this must have been a common pose for the two.
Tony’s breathing picked up but Sam and Bruce managed to get him to calm down to a normal level. Then suddenly Steve was there, rushing down the steps. Tony gave him an anxious and scared look to which the blonde gave a gentle smile.
Taking a deep breath Howard looked at Loki with a steely and determined look in his eyes. “How long do I have to bring one of them?”
“But there is a way to change that.” Erskine added gently, bending to try and grab Steve’s eyes.
“Well I’ve never talked to the guy.” Tony relented but barreled on “But last time Thor was here, Loki made his feelings about Captain and his buddies pretty clear.”
“Yes.” Loki seethed, the memory of Thor running off with those two imperious mortals passing through his mind.
The ice began to spread and the room dropped to arctic temperatures. “Get. Out.”
“And I didn’t report anything.” He spat.
1. Warriors dress means the Hercules outfit. I don’t know how to describe it so just know when I say “warriors dress” I mean the basic hero garb Hercule’s wears in the movie.
“Yes.” Steve answered without hesitation.
“Tony it’s not like that!” Steve almost shouted but Tony just gave a sharp backwards wave then marched out the door.
Bucky and Sam shared a look then turned their eyes back to their drinks. This whole situation just felt awkward.
“That’s a Hydra!” Bucky reprimanded, dragging Clint away.
“You expect him to be able to entice anyone?!” Amora was beyond offended and moving quickly into absolutely livid.
.” Loki then gestured to the Avengers and began pointing at each of them.
Tony whipped his head around and gave the now blind man an incredulous look.
“Always the hero.” Steve blushed and Tony laughed but that was quickly drowned out by the crowd’s cheers as they got closer.
“You shouldn’t make promises you can’t keep. Consider that my revenge.” He teased and the rest of the group laughed.
“Tony?” Rhodey asked, pulling the brunette out of his head.
3. I commissioned that pic back in May 2016 from https://perdax-blog.tumblr.com And this whole time it’s just been sitting on my computer judging me for not actually writing this story yet. You can also find this on my tumblr
The woman released Clint and smirked in victory. A shimmer then went over her body and in place of the plain looking woman was the Grand Witch Amora. She placed one hand on her hip and looked over the expressions of shock on the Avengers faces with a pleased smile.
“This art is amazing.” Natasha admired looking over an obviously purposeful decayed looking mosaic on one of the walls.
Eventually they all made it to one of the sitting rooms and relaxed. They then made plans for Tony to come over to the Avengers villa. After that, Thor took Bucky and Bruce back home Once there, the three explained Tony’s reaction and how they planned on having him over tomorrow.
“Get some of my scent?” The human asked teasingly. Loki gave the man a glare but that only caused Tony’s smile to grow.
“Oh Tones…” Rhodey groaned as he pressed his hands against his eyes. “No, no….”
Steve couldn’t sleep that night. He was still restless and angry. Bucky suggested they spar again but Steve turned it down.
“Hypocrite.” Thor retorted.
“Here we can escort you out.” Steve assured and Tony rolled his eyes.
Rhodey shook his head and surveyed the Avengers. He stopped at Steve. Steve had an absolutely smitten look on his face as he watched Tony laugh and smile. He then saw the moment Tony locked eyes with Steve. Tony blushed. It was light and he pushed it down a second later but Rhodey saw it.
“Can do. Who is it?” The mortal asked as he tried to peak at whatever Loki was looking at.
“Be sure to tell him of all your exploits.” Thor advised. “He should know he is dating a hero.”
“Does Loki know we are coming?” Thor asked after a moment.
Sorry everyone! Last week I couldn't post because I had Lasik surgery! :D I can now SEE!!
Howard swallowed a lump in his throat and seemed to shrink into himself for a moment. Then he let out a long breath and looked right at Steve.
But Steve’s steps were slow and his arm holding the dagger was shaking. He kept pushing against her control and even shut his eyes with the effort of it.
Steve glared at them as all his students stopped and looked back at the newcomers. Following Natasha and Clint into the room was a massive amount of tour attendees.
of the Avengers. They were just friends. Friends! The Avengers didn’t steal Thor. Thor just wanted to hang out while his friends were alive. His friends! Not lovers! The Avengers weren’t his lovers. Steve wasn’t his lover! Loki was wrong. Loki was wrong and now Tony was on a truly pointless mission.
Tony would never be able to pay Jarvis and Ana back for all that they did for him, and he was more than a little honored that they agreed to let him use their name.
Tony groaned and rubbed his face with his free hand. “Steve.” He whined.
“I hit it didn’t I?!” Clint exclaimed in an excited tone.
“But his mother won’t know he’s alive. You’re letting her think he’s dead!” He knew he was behaving semi-irrationally. The plan made sense but this touched a little too close to home.
“Do NOT make me out to be the villain here!” Loki seethed through clenched teeth, he then yelled. “I am the only one who has done nothing wrong in this whole situation!”  He jabbed Tony with a finger. “I kept my promise to
“Yet you're here.” Natasha stared and Tony gave her a long look.
“No! I’m sorry Tony. I never meant to hurt you, I just…”
The next day they began their training again in earnest. Bucky and Sam appeared to either bring out the best or worst in each other. Most times it was amusing but sometimes it grew aggravating. Time passed and they all learned the various fighting styles Erskine had to teach them. Then Erskine began putting the three mortals through elaborate obstacle courses (“Scenarios of heroics”). It was during one of these obstacle courses that the mortals learned what the contraptions on Sam’s back did.
Tony absently traced his scar with a grimace but Steve grabbed his hand and kissed it. Tony gave a half smile but still seemed bothered by it. Trying to raise his love’s spirit, Steve gave Tony -what he thought was- a suggestive smile.
“Oh gods you’re right!” Tony exclaimed in a faux tone. He dramatically brought a hand up to his chest and put on an anguished face. “And I didn’t ask for your permission before speaking. My goodness how have you put up with me?”
“You lied to me too!” He accused.
They kissed for some time, till a few loud and pointed coughs broke them up. Tony and Steve slowly backed away from each other. As they parted, time seemed to slow down. They both opened their eyes and stared at each other as they pulled apart. Steve smiled and Tony averted his gaze, everything coming down on him at once.
“You wish me to find a replacement?”
“Woah!” Bucky breathed, examining Steve’s new body. “Buddy….whoa!”
Amora looked genuinely shocked and stuttered for a moment. “Th-that is because he knows I am a great ally. He needs me…”
“How long have you known Tony?” Clint asked, trying to change the subject as quickly as possible.
The centaur glared at the brunettes back then broke into a gallop in order to get in front of the human. As he passed Tony, he had grabbed the man’s arms.
Tony sprung up from where he had landed and he tried to hack up all the water that he swallowed. As he was trying to move his drenched hair away from his eyes in order to clear them of water, he was suddenly lifted up bridal style.
“Why don’t we just send King Minos a warning to cease and desist?” Sam asked.
To have one half of the heavens ruled under her, she questioned why it was limited to only half and not all. And so she began to plan her take over. She staged a surprise attack at Odin’s engagement party. Odin was set to ask the Jotunn Jord to marry him when Bestla signalled for the attack. Before Odin could do anything Jord was dead, as was Laufey. Farbauti fled with grievous injuries and was presumed dead. Odin was enraged but hid his anger and stewed in it. He had thought he could bide his time and get the Jotunns to rally around him and overthrow his mother.
“Come on Happy, look on the bright side. I’ll be here for all eternity.” Tony tried to comfort, but Happy looked even more distraught.
“Do you want to stop?” Steve asked as his eyes raked over Tony’s tan body.
“Howard!” Steve called but the man didn’t answer. Didn’t even give any inclination he heard the hero.
“I am willing to do anything.”
“I did not start this! He chose the humans first! I am only playing the game he set up!”
“No you will not!” Thor shouted back and held out his hand. Mjolnir then burst through the Palace walls and landed in the gods palm.  “I am warning you Loki. Stand down!”
Thor then looked devastated and stared back at the frozen scene, his eyes focused on the small child. “Then I fear I know how this will play out.” He mumbled to himself.
The Avengers all shared a look but didn’t follow until Steve took the first steps after the brunette.
“I’ve thrown creature after creature at you. And yet you still live.” Loki huffed as if it was such an inconvenience. The Avengers all glared at the god who only continued talking. “Finally I decided I needed to learn more about you.” He folded his hands together and pointed the tips of his fingers at the group. “I didn’t end up getting your weaknesses, but I did learn your strengths.”
Loki looked around then began to pace as he mulled everything over. Tony scoffed and made to go inside, the god could teleport over to him once he was done. However, before he could make it through the door, Loki spoke.
“He defended them! He knows Odin doesn’t like us interfering with mortal affairs. But he risked it to defend them!” Another ice blast “And Odin won’t even bat his eye! ‘He’s the defender of mortals so he can break all my laws.’” Loki mocked in a deeper tone of voice to mimic Odin’s, while throwing another green energy blast. “But you Loki!” He continued in the fake Odin voice, “You stay in Hel! Out of sight! Out of mind! Where Thor can forget you! And REPLACE YOU!” A huge blast of ice and green energy came from the enraged god and the last stalagmite turned to dust.
Once Steve breached the entrance the King smiled and the Queen looked pained. Tony looked unimpressed and scoffed. Steve tried to give Tony a reassuring face but the brunette wouldn’t look at him.
“Here’s the trade off.” He said in a nonchalant manner. “You all give me your strengths for the next 48 hours.” He snapped his fingers.
“Maybe behind the bookshelf?”
Thor growled then hefted mjolnir higher. After a few seconds of the two glaring at each other, Thor huffed angrily then took off for Asgard. After he left, Loki smirked in victory. Amora raised an eyebrow at him but before she could ask anything Loki was making his way deeper into the Palace.
“Sam! I helped!”
Things with Howard were stagnant. Maria had the statue in New Thebes removed and Tony was grateful though the citizens were confused. They didn’t publicize the truth. However Tony still did not go by Stark. When asked for his full name he would say Anthony Jarvis. But Tony had talked to Howard, only three times but they had talked.
Steve stopped moving and glared as hard as he could at Tony. Tony meanwhile walked up the steps of the temple. However, just before entering he threw the blonde another look from over his shoulder.
“How do I do that?” Steve asked, both blondes ignoring Loki’s angry outburst.
“I would tie him to no one!” Steve interrupted, taking another step closer towards the god. “Not to you and not to me. Tony deserves to live. Actually live.” Steve bowed his head and took a steadying breath. “I hope he wants to talk to me, and we can work this all out.” Steve glared at Loki. “Because I do love him… But if he wants nothing to do with me then that’s fine.”
At the threshold for the door Tony turned back to the blonde and ran a hand through his hair. “Sorry for ruining the night.”
Loki caught the shield then tossed it onto the ground like a useless discus.
Tony had met the Minotaur in Monster Bog. He had tried to recruit the monster but was denied (this detail he left out of his retelling to the Avengers). Tony talked to him more and learned his name was Asterion. Eventually Asterion revealed his life story to the brunette.
Loki let out a surprised but pleased sound as Thor pulled him in for another hungry kiss. Thor wasn’t the god of Fertility for nothing and Loki couldn't wait for their celebration sex marathon. He had even lined up some of their favorite toys by the bed, but those could be enjoyed later.  He wanted him and Thor to feel the aftermath of this marathon for years.
“Please, I am NOT going to forget.” But he headed towards the door that lead to the Palaces inner personal chambers so he could mark the additional year on his running tally.
Tony shook his head. “I can’t.”
“It is done. He has left Hel.”
“You continue to vex me!” She growled. “I gave you an order. You are compelled by my power to follow it. Now slit his throat!”
Thaddeus Ross, had been a General in the Great War. He had since retired and fairly recently moved into New Thebes City with his daughter Betty. He had reported that the Green Beast or “Hulk”, had been harassing him and his daughter. He had hired mercenaries to take care of it but they had merely driven the creature into Monster Bog.
Jan, who had grown up with Tony and thus “came from Tony’s world” was hurt and offended that Bucky thought Steve wouldn’t be welcome in it. However Happy pointed out that there is a difference between being friends with a paparazzi followed billionaire and being in a relationship with one. Bucky and Happy could probably see what Steve had yet to (or didn’t want to). Perhaps Steve and Tony were too young, impulsive and stubborn. However none of the debating really affected Steve’s resolve.
The image then faded out and eventually vanished.
“Where did you go?” Natasha’s tone was ice and Steve gave her a cheeky smile.
The Great War had ended 6 years ago and now trade was booming again. New cities were and had been built and old cities were either left in the shambles the war had made of them or built back up. Steve was just a child when the war was going on, but he lost both his parents to the fight. Steve had wanted nothing more than to help but he was a sickly child and was often told he was more a hindrance than a help. However he wasn’t the only one who had lost people to the war. His best friend James Buchanan Barnes or Bucky, had also lost his father. His mother and sister however survived and took to raising Steve after news of his parents arrived.
After some hours of traveling Howard checked the map and knew the Underworld opening was coming up. He then turned to Tony who was fidgeting in his chitin and knelt down to his level.
“Thanks. Uh, take a seat or a couch for you Bucky. Steve told me you hit your noggin.”
“Actually it’s not that long.” Tony cut in, Steve gaped at him but Tony ignored the blonde. He then took on a look of pure determination. “I was working for Loki to kill the Avengers.”
“Thank you Howard.” The older man had then pulled the blonde into a hug.
Steve needed a few seconds to reboot. The gaul of that man, calling HIM a liar! Finally Steve snapped back to himself and puffed up in anger. He then bolted into the temple.
Bucky shook his head then grabbed it and hunched into himself in pain. That had been a mistake.
Tony then headed off in a different direction and offered the blonde a jaunty salute “Bye-Bye Steve!”
Tony shook his head in the negative while Steve looked ready to jump on the deal.
Amora gave a huff and appeared lost. “Then why…?”
“I told you to stop coming here.” She reprimanded and held up a hand to stop Steve from speaking “I
Loki stood in front of his throne with a look of pure victory. Amora quickly perked up in eagerness and asked for the details as to what happened. Loki reiterated what he did and then whistled for Fenrir.
Coming to a close on the first year of Tony’s life in Hel all the creatures stopped their harassment. It came abruptly but Tony wasn’t going to question it. Rhodey, for his part, had given Loki a very formal bow when he dropped Tony back off in the palace but that had been the end of it.
Amora would demand Tony bring her wine and then she’d pour her glass on the floor and demand he clean it. She’d demand he bring her some items that were often within walking distance. She’d hound his sleep by waking him up and making him do some fetch quests. In public she’d demean him, address him as Loki’s slave, and throw wine at him. One particular instance of this was while Thor was visiting. She had gone out of her way to travel to the Monster Village where Tony was, and demanded he pour her wine which she had brought with her. Once he filled her cup, she grabbed the bottle and dumped all the contents on the young mortal. A few monsters growled and looked ready to try and attack the witch but abstained. If not because of self preservation, then because Tony splayed out his hand in a stop motion to subtle signal them to leave it.
Peggy looked into Steve’s eyes for some time then smiled and pressed a kiss to his cheek. She then turned to Bucky and gave him a kiss on the cheek as well.
“Never forget the importance of body language.” Loki teased.
Loki glared at her. “You’ll be dead within 48 hours.”
“It’s been a trial.” Bucky gritted out as Clint and Sam snickered in the background.
“Magic Asgardian water.” Steve answered pulling Tony back to him.
Before Steve could freak out or panic Sam suggested they may have passed the man and that he’s with the Avengers now. So they flew back to the Avengers mansion. There, the Avengers asked if they found Tony and Steve did begin to panic, but he kept it in check. Panicking wouldn’t find Tony.
Tony looked completely thrown at seeing them then visibly shook himself and glanced around.
“What?” Natasha asked and Steve gestured to the house.
“...” Tony glanced at Amora who did not look nearly as confused as Tony was about why that name would cause Loki to get so upset. “Steve Rogers…?” He phrased it like a question trying to put together what he was missing.
“I just wanted to make sure you were ok. I’m so sorry for embarrassing you! And right after I said I wouldn’t hurt you, I end up doing just that!” The blonde began berating himself and that sprung Tony into action.
All three then ducked down and slowly crept closer to the river they could hear a few feet away. But the river wasn’t the only sound they heard. Now that they were closer Sam and Bucky could hear an argument coming from the riverfront. All three kept themselves hidden and peaked through their covering to evaluate the situation.
“TONY!”
’ He thought then looked at Amora and the Avengers again.
Howard gasped as he automatically sprung back only to hit a wall as he did so. Looking around him he noted it was a city wall. The city wall of his home. Gasping in shock Howard looked all around and noticed he was no longer a gray shade but back in his body. Not only  that, he was outside his city gates. Loki had given him life and transported him home. He looked at the scroll in his hand and unfurled it.
Training with Erskine had been tough, more than tough it was downright brutal at times. But the knowledge was more than helpful. He went over not only different fighting techniques but taught them all he knew of different monsters and how to take them down. They had run drills on how to handle giant lions, sea serpents, enemy armies, cyclops, and so much more. It was rigorous but incredibly beneficial. Steve had been at the island just over 3 years now.
“I know sweetie.”
“You were never interested before.” Thor remarked. “You’ve been god of the Dead for centuries and never thought to read these. Yet in these recent years you have requested I bring you all the scrolls and writings I can find about Hel.”
Not the smartest thing, and definitely not the safest but it was the right thing. Tony had been right and he helped Steve realize that.
“Then I’ll work for you.”
“Are you ever going to start training us?”
“During the fight.” Sam explained. “Tony said Loki knew we were just friends. But he lied.”
“No! I was working in Mr. Stark’s workshop and you know how fast time flies in there.”
“What?” Tony gasped.
Steve could feel the emotion in her words and let out a small “Thank you.”
“Steve-”
“I am still angry at you.” He seethed
“You can relax, he’s not coming.” Tony called in way of a greeting.
And Steve kept talking about all his exploits. True he didn’t tell them like a grand poet would, but instead rattled them off like they were debriefing. But still! The Avengers wouldn’t stop talking about all Steve’s heroic accomplishments. It’s like they all really wanted Tony to gush and fawn over them and Steve. And although that may help his job go smoother. He just couldn’t bring himself to even fake enthusiasm for these wanna-be-in-Valhalla mortals.
Steve kept this up for awhile before Tony let out a deep breath and seemed to come back to himself. Tony blinked at the blonde, smacked his lips a few times but Steve just kept rubbing his back and spoke gently.
“We can salvage this.” Natasha said, steppeling her fingers and resting her chin on them.
Tony began rocking down into Steve’s covered erection and the blonde assisted by jutting his hips up to meet him.
“We will talk later.” Loki muttered towards Thor as he regripped his Scepter. Thor beamed at him then gave Steve’s shoulder a pat. “I would still like him to swear he will never lord this boon over Tony.” Loki added as some of the blue began to recede from him and the ice began to melt.
“I try, but everytime I do...it just...feels awkward.” Steve fidgeted in his seat.
“He’s gonna go crazy. I’ve been hanging out with Rhodey most of the day so I have his scent on me.”
Feeling eyes on him Bucky glanced at Natasha who slowly smirked at him in approval.
Tony thought quickly.
Steve’s face dropped as what Tony said sunk in. Abruptly he stopped walking then gently grabbed Tony’s hand in order to stop him as well. They were in the garden, right in front of a beautiful fountain. The sun had now set so only the torches lit up the otherwise dark and secluded area. Steve then grabbed Tony’s other hand so both were clasped in front of them.
“What? Are we only allowed to be talking about the big green ogre we’re heading off to kill?” Clint shot back.
The other heads immediately noticed and began to attack in a more furious manner.
“This is why you shouldn’t have freed him.” Amora said in the tone of one imparting great wisdom.
Rhodey moved his body to fully block the door from Loki. Loki glared at him but the centaur just glared back.
“So he’s a hermit.” Bucky concluded.
Steve and the Avengers then walked away. After they were some distance, Sam asked Bucky if he was alright while Clint and Natasha talked to Steve.
Tony immediately whipped his head over to Steve with wide eyes.
“I wish I knew my friend.” Thor said and place a hand on Steve’s shoulder. “I wish I knew how this all started...” Everyone again nodded in agreement.
“The Minotaur. That’s his name. Asterion.” Tony bit out.
“It is not about worthiness.” Erskine broke in, surprising everyone with his sudden presence. “Steve, walk with me.”
“Thor?” Tony gapped, amazed at the prospect of meeting one of the most powerful gods. “Thor the god of Thunder and Fertility?”
“You say something punk?” Bucky asked. “Steve?” When he and Sam looked back to where Steve was, the blonde was gone. “Steve?!”
“WHAT?!” Steve and Bucky yelled.
Tony cocked an eyebrow, “You mean Steve’s weakness?”
“Offer them a deal Loki.” Thor pushed, coming up to Loki’s side. “They should at least be able to try. They have braved Hel after all, they deserve something.”
“I can’t even see it.” Sam complained but Thor gently nudged them all.
“You may enter.” Loki bid.
Steve waited for Tony to show up for their date but when an hour passed, the blonde began to get worried. So Sam and him flew over to Tony’s place. Steve knocked on the door but received no response. He then decided to just enter, all the while calling out for Tony to please answer him.
“I have to agree with the slave.” Amora jumped in, and Tony threw her a glare but didn’t interrupt. “You can’t rely on him to get information from mortals. Does he even know how to hold a conversation?! Let alone pry out information! I mean for Odin’s sake Loki! The man is so dense around other mortals! He couldn’t even tell his father was leading him to slaughter. How long did that take to kick in?!” Amora spread her arms wide. “And you expect him to be able to pull information from strangers?! He couldn’t read his own father!”
During a dice game, where Tony and Natasha were tied for the win. Clint asked the question that had been bugging him since the other day..
“Do we?”
Later, as Steve guided Howard towards his guest room, the man told Steve he had a gift for him. In the privacy of his room he had gifted Steve his Underworld map.
Tony glared at the blonde then ran to catch up to him. Once the brunette was next to Steve he continued.
“Actually, now we have a problem.”
I’m so glad you all liked the AU I created! It was SO MUCH FUN to come up with this idea and then write it, so I’m truly touched that so many of you liked it! <3
“Yes I know you have responsibilities that keep you busy. Yet now here you are, whining at me for doing my own responsibilities.”  Loki tsked, swatting at a hand that tried to make its way between his legs.
“Your friend?” Tony scoffed then rolled his eyes. “I’m sure! Must have a lot of friends for all the openings and events you guys go to, Superstar.” Steve shook his head at the brunette’s teasing.
“You’re right.” Bucky admitted seriously. “Steve and I,” the brunette slapped an arm on the blonde’s shoulder. “Talked this morning and it really cleared a lot of things up. I was taking stuff out on Tony unfairly. I owe him a few apologies.”
.” Bucky added and Tony gave the blonde a look of victory, as if his point was proven.
Clint and the woman blinked at the hand and then let out a small private chuckle. Meanwhile, Steve, Sam and Bucky all looked bewildered and Steve began to drop his hand.
“What are they doing here?!” Rhodey yelled as he galloped into the Throne Room. The centaur then took in the damage to the room and Loki poised to strike Steve. “Wait.” Rhodey’s face was washed in confusion. “What’s going on here?!”
1. I love Peggy! She’s such a fantastic character. I really enjoyed writing her and Steve’s interactions. I hope I did her character justice.
“No.” Sam answered immediately, her power compelling the truth from him.
James Rhodes could feel the tension in the air and readjusted himself to try and dispel it from seeping into him. Which immediately caught the attention of the little boy. Tony looked the centaur over and beamed at him, seemingly ecstatic to see a centaur. Rhodes puffed up his chest and gave the boy a smile, which Tony returned along with a small wave.
“Apologies James but you and Anthony seem to be misinformed.” Loki took his magic away from Howards mouth and suddenly all his color started to drain away till he resembled a gray shade.
“Have any of you seen Tony Jarvis this week? He’s the human that whistles and wears red usually.” Bruce asked and Thor repeated it to make sure the question carried.
“Nah,” Tony waved the offer away. “Ever since that one time, Loki and I decided it was best for me to not have any connections to the underworld. Just in case.”
Jotunns were not like the gods who lived in Asgard, they were less wise. They were taller creatures with horns sprouting from their heads. Also the elements of the Cosmos were attuned to their very emotions, some could control fire, others earth, ice, etc. Odin was born of a peace between the (at the time) fairly new Asgardian gods and the old Jotunn’s. Bor, Odin’s father, ruled the Asgardian gods and was set to marry the heir to the Jotunn throne. However, King Laufey and his wife -Farbauti- had no heirs to offer Bor. And so Bor had married the next highest unattached heir. A cousin and counselor to the royal Jotunn’s, Bestla. Odin was eventually born from the union and all seemed well but none noticed the burning greed growing in Bestla.
Amora had teleported back to Hel and before she could utter a sound, Loki had trapped her in ice. Rhodey had been there and had volunteered to help deal with the witch. Loki wasn’t exactly sure what was happening to Amora but knowing the centaur’s fury at the news of Tony’s passing, he could be sure it wasn’t pretty.
They all then made their way to the unveiling where they were met by a large cheering crowd. Sam then caught Tony’s eye and gestured to the crowd in a ‘see what I mean’ gesture. Tony nodded and then felt Steve’s horse come up next to his own.
After the first group meet up Tony tried a few times to whisk Steve away for some private time but more often than not, another Avenger joined them. Often Steve was the one inviting them. It was beginning to really grate on Tony’s nerves. But that didn’t compare to the annoyance that was the showboating and bragging the Avengers seemed to really enjoy doing.
“Natasha!” Clint cried on instinct seeing the shield fly towards her back. Unfortunately this caused the woman to turn around and have the round front of the shield hit her face rather than her back.
The mist then changed to show flashbacks of times when Tony had to quickly hide or duck into a room or something as Thor surprised Loki with visits.
“Oh gods!” Steve gasped.
“We should head to the City Guard's office. See if they need assistance with anything.” Sam reasoned and the group nodded in agreement.
“Did you hear that?” Steve asked, heeding the voice’s advice and stopping in his tracks. Bucky stopped as well and both looked around to find the source.
“WHAT?!” Loki screeched both as a question and in outrage at the thought of mortals just walking into Hel.
The Avengers were silent and Steve audible swallowed as Tony let his words sink in. After about 30 seconds of absolute silence, Tony folded his arms again.
“A lovers quarrel?” Sam questioned, glancing at his friends. Steve’s eyes didn’t leave the scene before him but Bucky gave him a shrug.
No one else seemed to see the looks Sam and Bucky gave Steve. Steve didn’t either, all he saw was the tablet filled with his wedding. The wedding he really didn’t want. Tony kept talking and swiping through images and images of wedding things: Photographer choices, Videographer choices, possible Halls, table arrangements, table settings, flowers, etc.
Steve laughed and Tony’s smile grew victorious.
“Steve is a glory hound!” He stated firmly. “He’s a wanna-be-in-Valhalla jerk! He’s after fame and glory! He just wants everyone to love him!” He then repeated this mantra on loop. Hoping to firm this up in his mind.
Then it happened, while Natasha and Clint distracted the two heads, Sam came diving in from the sky. He had fired a few arrows into one of the heads and then came down and used all his weight to kick the monsters head down towards the ground. The one head went down, where Steve and Bucky ran at it. Bucky had what appeared to be a rock in his hands while Steve had his shield. They ran and sandwiched the head between the two of them, crushing the skull and killing the one head.
Bucky gave the god an outraged look. Steve gave Sam a smirk then joined in the banter. “He’s right, you have looked pretty sloppy bud.”
They went to an area on the island that was the least littered with decrepit statues and trees. Steve laid on the ground and Bucky sat next to him and offered his hand which Seve grabbed.
At dinner Tony had started talking about some ideas he had thought of that may help their side in the war, but Howard had dismissed them. He didn’t want to think of the war, he didn’t want to think of his death and what he had to do.
“Let’s head back. Maybe he’s already at the mansion, ready to tease you.”
Sorry for not posting last week, I needed The Gospel Truth to catch up. Now that fic will post every Wednesday and Friday and this fic will post every Friday so both will end at the same time!
“What?”
“He’s a mortal child, he shouldn’t be able to decimate a room in my palace! “
Tony screeched, holding his arms out in front of himself as if keeping them away. The three all kept talking over each other, each getting louder and louder as they tried to explain their brief silence. After Tony’s screech, the three men immediately ceased talking and Tony took an exaggerated breath.
Erskine, Steve, and Bucky all spent the next few days getting to know each other and setting up their new living arrangements. Bucky and Steve made their own home next to Erskine’s.
Thor had just landed for a visit and brought wine for them all to share. As Steve was about to partake, Erskine grabbed his arm. Steve gave him a questioning look and Erskine responded by tilting his head off to the side. He then walked off, leaving Steve to follow after him.
“He didn’t come here for Peggy. He came here for Tony.” Pepper explained still shielding Steve and the other Avengers behind her.
That gave Loki pause and Tony fought to suppress the smirk that wanted to take over his face. Loki gave him a light glare.
Sam also stopped and rubbed his forehead in exasperation.
Loki glared at Steve, like he had said something truly offensive. Steve just glared at him until the god walked over to Tony.
“Do you do that often?” Tony cut in, surprised but not overly so. He should have expected this of Loki. “Cause I walk around naked
“Please Lord Loki!”
And now for the memes:
Time went on and more wedding planning took place. Some helped Bruce and Betty (who now came to the weekly meetings), others helped Tony. Steve answered some questions and put in his opinion occasionally but never directly planned anything.
“Told you that would work.” Loki said as he removed his hand from Tony’s person.
Steve, Sam, and Bucky then shared their stories and how they were on a quest to get Steve to become an official True Hero.
After what seemed like a whole afternoon of wrestling, Howard had called them in. Dinner was an awkward affair because Maria Stark joined them.
The group continued exploring the city but eventually stopped for a break and quick drink.
“I like you.” Clint spoke up throwing his hand in the air. Natasha gave him a hard look and Sam shook his head at his choice of friends.
Loki’s eyes suddenly sparkled and the god stepped closer to Tony in excitement. “You found their weaknesses?! I knew you would succeed!”
King Minos went to answer but Tony barrelled over him and now looked towards the guards who were watching him.
“Uhhh”
The parents hushed their child again, the other mom giving herself a face palm as her wife tried to hush their kid. The Avengers, however, chuckled and Steve went to answer but said man interrupted them.
The Avengers and Tony were almost to Thor’s temple when screaming and the sound of pandemonium rose up from one end of the city. Since the Avengers were on one of the higher elevations of the city they were able to see the area the screams and panic were coming from. The sight was not pretty and caused a heavy weight to settle over all of them.
Steve’s entire body felt like it was on fire. It was like enduring the pain of the transformation all over again. Still he popped his head up as quickly as he could and glared at the god.
“It’s not about that!” Sam yelled as he swooped down and grabbed Natasha and pulled her away from the body.
“Idiotic?! Disrespectful?!” The dark haired god interrupted, causing the temperature of the room to drop.
“...What was that?” Sam asked slowly as they looked around the carnage.
Steve handed off the mallet and Howard gave him a thin smile. Steve had already expected that answer but he often wished it would change.
Thor’s body tensed, “I am not leaving until you-!”
“You know we're not like that.” He groaned, Peggy then tutted and shook her head.
“Is it bad I’m hoping we run into bandits?” Bucky asked cracking his knuckles.
1. So taking away everyone's biggest/obvious strength nerfs everyone EXCEPT Sam Badass Wilson. So for a while I was stuck on this. I kept wondering how can I nerf him?? Eventually it hit me, I would have to hurt him (my poor baby).
Clint and Natasha gave the god a strained smile. In the background Bucky and Sam were trying to comfort Steve who had spiraled into full on panic.
“Let me finish.” Phil advised. “So he’s been satisfying it with their convicts but figured he might want to make political use of his problem.”
“Nice shot!” Tony cheered earning a glare from both immortals. Tony only gave them a glance then zeroed in on the fight.
“Aw damn.” Bucky swore from the background. Next to him Natasha glared at the court member.
“Yeah” Sam let out a weak chuckle. “Your dog has a biting problem.”
“Do you know why you are here?”
“How...How’d you get this?” Bucky inquired waving his hand at the scroll.
“I’ll see you later Tones.”
“Loki?!” Thor rounded on him but the blue god just glared at the entryway.
“They were so close to having him back, but failed.” Steve shook his own head. “I couldn’t-” Steve stopped abruptly, realization that the same scenario could happen to him in a few hours hitting him hard.
“Tony’s Howard’s son.” Natasha said.
“Would you go to Hel and bring Peggy back if you could?” Howard asked, commanding an answer.
4. Of course Natasha has the most game. DUH!
’ Tony thought bitterly.
“This is for the best, the less people who know the better.” Natasha advised again. “We’ll all go into the labyrinth, but instead of killing Asterion we’ll get him to freedom. Once he’s free we’ll dirty our weapons with the corpses still in the labyrinth.”
“...To-To see the man he...” Maria continued crying and shaking “He could have been! I cannot! Please! I cannot bear it!”
Bucky gave him a playful shove but staggered as he did so. “Oof. Honestly, I’ve been better.”
“I can tell you like him to. So please don’t let my screw ups affect you guys.”
“This will end badly.” Loki gave no reaction and Tony ran his fingers through his hair then groaned and let the fight leave his body. He looked Loki in the eyes and sighed.
“Use it’s anger against it!” Steve yelled as he dodged a swipe from the Hydra’s middle head.
“So you want to make sure it doesn’t corrupt me.” Steve poised it as a question but they both knew it wasn’t.
’ He thought.
“This lookout to the sky,” Sam gushed gesturing to the sky light in the center of the room. “It’s breathtaking!”
However her smugness quickly fell away when Steve pushed and was able to take two steps forward. She glared at the blonde and poured more of her power out; but then directed her anger back to Tony.
“Bye-bye Captain!” He said in parting throwing up a two finger salute as he disappeared into the fog.
“Just do it!”
Tony looked comically anguished and his arms hung limply at his sides. “That’s no fair! He doesn’t listen to anyone but you.” He then rubbed his forehead in annoyance. “It’s already impossible to help him with his shedding. And he always grows and shrinks whenever I get even close to being done, so I have to start all over.” The mortal continued to grumble as he made his way out of the Throne Room and over towards his chambers.
Tony nodded then bent down for a formal bow, Steve following after him.
Howard nodded his head in the affirmative.
“Oh! Uh, everyone this is James Rhodes.” Tony then proceeded to introduce everyone.
Like his father sacrificed him.
“No, gods no!” Steve shook his head at the very thought. “It’s the story of Odin and the Jotunns of old.” Tony gave Steve a genuinely surprised look. “...what? Bad choice?”
“Seriously?” Steve shook his head in disbelief.
Ana Jarvis and Tony had met up sparingly throughout his life. She was an amazing woman but she had family and friends she wanted to spend time with in Hel, and Tony didn’t begrudge her of that. She was always there when he needed her though. During his first year in Hel, she would often stay by his bedside and say soothing words in a motherly tone, sometimes singing him to sleep as his mother had. It was something Tony had desperately needed.
Steve immediately raced to follow her. Distantly he and the others felt bad that they had left Thor alone; but he was a god and Loki’s lover. Plus the excitement and rush of emotion at the thought of seeing Tony again outweighed the guilt.
“I’m your lover, I want to help you.” Steve had urged. “If it’s getting too much or you need some time, tell me. Don’t just run off.”
Thor glanced at the two mortals then pulled them in his arms. Sharing a glare with Loki, he raised Mjolnir and zoomed them out of the Palace and out of Hel. Loki shot an icicle at their fleeing backs then let out an angry scream.
“He led us to the Hydra, he’s in the Monster Bog and he’s not worried about his own safety. He’s dangerous and is probably a monster in disguise.” She stated and Bucky nodded in agreement readying his own weapon.
“You said I could protect him in Hel.” Rhodey argued, gearing up to demand he be allowed inside Tony’s chambers.
Meanwhile the rest of Steve’s friends came up around his back and looked at the distraught brunette curiously (minus Bucky who stared at him with indifference).
strength?! Well then why didn’t you report that to Loki?! ...Aren’t you tired of lying to me?!”
“See how easy this is?” She smirked then waved her hand, Clint obeyed her unsaid command and took a few steps back.
“I will be a god!” Amora shouted. “My power is only overshadowed because Frigga will not let me come into my full potential. She will not give me the title goddess.” She ranted, her eyes glazing over as she lost herself to a fantasy. “But I will have it! When Thor marries me I will become a goddess by right!”
Tony had a rougher start with Steve’s friends. Natasha Romanoff and Tony had actually met before, when she moonlighted at Stark Industries. Safe to say, she did not have a high opinion of him having only seen his Starktm face and attitude. However after getting to know Tony as a person, she came around. Bucky had not liked Tony, when questioned he said Tony just rubbed him the wrong way. However, for Steve’s sake he was civil to the man and only openly complains to his boyfriend Sam Wilson and Natasha. Sam had been a shining ray in Tony’s world when he first met Steve’s friends. The man’s easygoing attitude and easy friendship were direly needed and appreciated. Clint Barton was the other friend that easily took a shine to Tony.
“Please Tony!” Steve begged again. “Don’t be dead. Don’t die! I told you-” Steve broke off with a cry.
Currently, Bucky and Steve were at Howard’s villa. Instead of sobbing and crying, Steve was now filled with unbridled frustration and anger. Bucky suggested they go spar and thus they ended up in the Stark’s private garden wrestling on the ground.
“Can we meet him?!” Clint finally asked.
During dinner that night Sam had told them his story.
“BUCKY!”
“Ferry?” Bucky then turned to the map and looked it over. It did say a boat would take them across the river.
“Sam, your leg!” He exclaimed.
“I love Tony.”
“You wouldn't even hear Steve out!” Thor boomed. “You disregarded him! As you disregard all mortals!”
TWO THUMBS WAY WAY UP for elyador who helped me out with this!
risk the wrath of
“You think I’m an oddity?”
“You must be having trouble with your hearing Amora.” Tony gestured to his ears. “Your old age is starting to show.” He smirked at her heated glare. He may have to pay for that comment later but it was worth it.
Looking at his tally wall, Tony let the revelation wash over him again. Sometimes he just couldn’t believe it. He hadn’t thought freedom possible. When he was young he entertained the fantasy but never actually thought he could be free. But then Loki had offered it, and now he had some years of freedom already built up. Years he would spend free! Over encompassing happiness and excitement bubbled out of him in the form of a manic giggle.
“And how’s that? By practising with Bucky?” Steve groaned and Peggy giggled at his expense.
Tony broke the kiss with a loud gasp and moan as his back arched beautifully. Steve immediately began mumbling apologizes as his cock twitched inside the brunette. Tony shook his head in the negative and then gyrated his hips as he adjusted to Steve’s girth.
In a heavy voice he said quietly. “But you didn’t have to say you loved me, when you were just waiting to get the love of your life back.”
“What else am I to do here but explore the oddity I’ve found?”
“A hard learned lesson.” Howard admitted. “Obie thought it would make a catchy motto.” He shrugged, “It keeps the lesson in my head.”
“Loki.” Thor stressed.
“HEY!” Thor boomed indigently. “That’s my mother! Do not take her name in vain!”
“NO! Amora can hide herself, disguise herself! She’s the one for this job.”
The centaur now blocked one of those side doors as he maneuvered himself to get a front view of who was approaching.
“They hear monsters and think, well
Clint laughed at the memory of this morning. “Remember Steve’s face when I suggested he just throw Tony over his shoulder and drag him to bed?” The group laughed at the memory.
“And you never saw Tony?” Clint questioned.
“Don’t worry we won’t charge you for that.” Clint joked.
“No! He’s still alive!”
Tony snorted and gave Bucky a haughty confident look. “Actually centaurs are as complex as humans. Broad overall statements like that are kind-of offensive. You should
Tony blinked then leaned back and smacked his lips in a show of frustration. “Fine.” His tone was clipped and annoyed.
“Great!” Tony bit out sarcastically. “Everyone wins!” He continued in a sarcastic tone. “Asterion get’s to live, King dickface gets to keep his shit up, and Queen Pasiphae gets to suffer and mourns in silence!” He gave Steve a bitter and angry smile “What a happy ending!”
“I’ll give you the coin if you really want it; but no I’m done with you, head on home.”
It also contains Tony and Loki bonding from Tony growing up :D
That night everyone went out for drinks to celebrate Jan’s success and engagement. During a highpoint in the night, Tony approached Steve and gave him a wrapped box. In the box was a brand new pair of running shoes. Steve kissed him and Tony kissed him back and they left the party and went to Tony’s place.
1. Finally! Our main couple has finally interacted. Good lord this was a lot of world building. This is what happens when you have a fic idea build up for 7+ years.
“I don’t know.”
The beast had originally gave the city a wide berth as it smelled the Hydra sleeping just underneath/outside the city area. However, after it was defeated the lion felt safe to try it’s luck on the city.
“Steve I have no use for it anymore. You’ll need this more than I will.” Howard said as Steve looked at the magic map in reverence.
Bucky figured knocking was a waste of time, the place was huge. Waiting for Tony to come from whatever room he was in to open the door, would take more time than him walking in, grabbing his weapons, and leaving.
Steve had been trying to figure out what Tony was doing. He at first thought Tony was trying to buy them time for Thor to come back. But the brunette kept purposefully riling Amora up, getting her angry. When Steve saw Amora’s hands glow he figured out what Tony was actually trying to do and wanted to scream. His eyes bulged and he tried to make his body move or do something. He tried to even say something. But nothing.
“Are you sure?”
“We’re running short on time Steve, let’s get Thor here.” Tony replied in a tired tone as he knelt before the altar.
“Which is stupid.” Bucky immediately replied. He then held up a fist “Till the end of the line, remember?”
“I’m going to get us some snacks and wine.” Tony said airily, “This is your vacation after all, so don’t get up. Just relax. You don’t know where anything is anyway. And don’t think of trying to learn. I’m going to move it all when I’m bored next week.”
“I don’t know about that last part.” Bruce chidded “I think it’s more they...we...us in the Monster Bog knew he was only there for information so there’s no harm in letting him roam around.”
“Tony will go.”
“Nothing.” Thor answered immediately. “I believe Steve is a True Hero. But I am not the one who can give out that title.”
“STEVE?!” Loki shouted. “He’s the cause of all of this! He started all this!”
The brunette then mentally shook himself and plastered on a smile. “It’s fine, and hey that’s the price you pay for being a super star.”
“Do not underestimate my powers! I can go undetected.” Amora seethed, offended at the idea that she even needed to defend her prowess. “They will never be able to tell it was me.” She assured but Loki was shaking his head in the negative next to her.
Two weeks later the trio saw Thor come over the Horizon with another man. The man had dark colored skin and a similar build to Bucky’s. He wore a typical warriors dress, sans the cape. The most curious thing about the new arrival were the contraptions he seemed to have glued to his back. The contraptions were two slim rectangles attached to the area above each of his shoulder blades. On his back, between the rectangles, was an imprint in his armor that depicted the winged horse Pegasus.
“That’s a terrible idea!” The mortal squawked.
Loki’s eyebrows dropped and he made a movement with his arms towards Tony, an automatic reaction to reach out. But Loki caught himself. For a moment he pondered what to do, then his eyes caught the leftover pottery and he walked over to pick it up.
“I don’t think anyone ever did. I mean we all knew it was Tony.” Bruce shrugged. “He’s the only one who whistles.”
“You’re lying!” Amora shrieked.
“Hey I’m just telling you what I heard.” Tony defended throwing his hands up.
I wanna thank everyone who comments and gives me kudos! YOU GUYS ARE GREAT!! I hope you know how much I appreciate and enjoy receiving both of them. I won't lie, comments give me more life lol BUT I appreciate all and want to thank all of you for sending me the love <3
Rhodey opened his mouth to share his thoughts but a ball of green light distracted him. “Uh-oh. Speak of the god.”
“They can have it, if it means getting Tony back!” Steve said with some of the panic he’s been keeping at bay leaking in.
“But we’d be happy to have you come along.” Steve amended.
“I know! I know.” Loki placated. “You never hurt him, but I want to make it perfectly clear. You
Loki was leaning on the ritual table in the center of his study, looking as if he was about to check for something underneath the table. However, upon Thor’s entrance he sprang up then leaned on the table in a more seductive pose.
5. I do have a background idea for these Avengers background love story drama. I may do a summary dump in separate postings later. I really like Bucky and Sam’s. Which again was nowhere in my head for the 7+ years it took to think and round this whole plot out, so it’s a happy surprise.
“Don’t act like you don’t miss him.” Sam teased causing the blonde to blush but he didn’t deny it.
Tony thought.
“...Yeah, and no it wasn’t him.” He said slowly, “I saw them and they were just some guys.” He hung the furs up and glanced back to see Loki pout at his fantasy being destroyed.
“You see Howard Stark died a few days ago.” Loki explained as he rose from his seat on the throne.
“Loki remembers you and is still not pleased with our True Hero plan.” He shrugged again. “But these things happen. Though I would actively avoid going to Hel or any of Loki’s temples.”
“You need to be brave Tony.” Howard said sternly, “You want to help end the war and this is how you can.” Tony looked as if he had been slapped.
“What?” Bucky couldn’t help but ask.
“Tony.” Said man gave the same smirk he had given Steve earlier and it once again caused the blonde to blush crimson. “And I’m alright.”
Everyone stopped and stared at the blonde. Then Jan’s face morphed into the brightest smile that rivaled Thor’s. Meanwhile Happy’s face morphed into a considering frown. Then the debates started. Jan, Clint, and Thor were all for Steve confessing to Tony and getting together because they knew Steve and Tony would make a great couple. Happy and Bucky thought Steve should think about it more. Happy wanted to protect his friend and urged Steve to really evaluate his feelings before making any move. Bucky said the same thing but also asked Steve look at life’s big picture -meaning Tony’s world and Steve’s world. Which caused another round of debates. Natasha and Sam tried to be the mediators but two people were not enough to keep their group of friends calm.
“Steve has been declared a True Hero by our Mother the goddess Frigga.” Thor explained. “He is using his boon to restore your life.”
The Avengers for their part had remained silent and were still confused as Tony’s explanation still hadn’t answered everything.
“This will bind you forever.” Loki explained imperiously. “You will never be able to take it back or change it. Your very soul will not allow it.”
Suddenly Tony felt lips press against his cheek. He immediately went ramrod straight and blushed as he felt Steve pull back. Tony locked eyes with him and saw Steve was also blushing a bright red.
“Did you…” Bucky started then stopped and thought better of his question. “Do you have any advice for dealing with Lord Loki?”
Loki raised an eyebrow at the mortal -Howard’s- audacity. He was not used to being interrupted by a mortal. However the mortals words intrigued him more. It was true that the dead cannot lie, however Loki knew that the concept of “truth” was a finicky one. One could be honest but still not reveal the absolute truth. Howard, at least, believed the truth of his words and thus was allowed to say them.
“It’s not him that’s the problem, Steve. It’s you!” He rushed out frustrated. Steve quirked an eyebrow and Bucky let out a groan as he dragged his hands down his face. “I said it before...my problem isn’t with Tony. I mean I don’t love the guy but… My problem isn’t with him…. it’s you.” He admitted the last two words in almost a whisper.
“Good, you need it. It’s been a while since his last visit.”
“I’ll try.”
“I’m not sleeping with him!” Steve yelled in a panic.
“They know! I told them, that’s why we had to get you.”
“I am Steve, Lord Thor. Steven Rogers.” Steve then gave a quick bow. Thor then asked Bucky the same question.
“What?!” Steve squeaked out at a very high octave.
“I didn’t ask for a word-by-word breakdown Pep. But Thor left knowing Loki was mad about him spending time with them.” Pepper nodded looking thoughtful. “And then he went back to them, and has been with them since. And now Daddy issues are being thrown into the mix!”
“Uhh.” Bruce tried.
“Excellent! I will fetch the bottle for us!”
“Night sir.” Steve said in parting as he made for the exit.
” Everyone, sans Thor shouted.
While Howard kept his head bowed, Tony peaked up. He had never dreamed of seeing a god. Nevermind be in a gods palace.
“And we’ll be able to capture Thor’s gaze again.” Amora agreed, smiling viciously. “What’s the plan?”
“You can’t take that from us!” Bucky yelled.
On their way back to New Thebes the group was accosted by a woman wearing a floor length chiton with some armor that appeared to have been slapped on top of it haphazardly. She held a spear in an inexperienced grip and brandished it at the heroes from on top of her horse. She identified herself as Betty Ross and demanded they release Bruce as he had done nothing wrong and her father had simply lied and slandered his name.
Just as Loki had imagined, once the 5 mortals freed all Amora’s duplicates the crowd of people, who followed the heroes, clapped and showed their appreciation. Though to a lesser degree than Loki had originally imagined but it was no matter.
“He’s very much alive.” Bucky added.
“Wasn’t he at all concerned about his safety?” Steve questioned. “What if a monster didn’t know he was there to gather information? What if they thought he was a threat?”
About a month later Thor came back. He first talked with Erskine then greeted Steve and Bucky.
“I’m in here Thor!” Loki yelled back, then quickly began to fix up his appearance.
“Because I can.” Is all she said then left, walking casually back to the palace.
Loki held up a hand and sat up straighter on his throne. His face lost the salesman edge and took on more the face of a true god. He also seemed to be looking past the centaur.
The tension instantly evaporated from the room. Steve visibly relaxed and gave a more genuine smile. Meanwhile, Bucky, Natasha, and Sam fist bumped in the background. Bruce grabbed Betty’s arm and she patted it while making the “shh” motion with her mouth. Clint fully relaxed into his chair, appearing to almost melt into it. And Thor openly beamed at the two.
Loki had used a rune stone and opened a portal to Tony’s house. With every able body’s help, they moved all of Tony’s possessions from Hel to his mansion in New Thebes City. Loki had then given Rhodey a pack filled to the brim with rune stones so he and Tony could travel back to Hel whenever they pleased. And of course Loki would supply more when needed.
“Stop talking!” Phil commanded.
In a fit of anger Loki blasted ice and a green energy blast at the only untouched stalagmite left near him. He had been taking his anger out on them and had done a good job decimating all the other stalagmites which were now rubble on the ground.
1. And we finally have the Captain nickname established, hurray!
“You better not be here for me.” Peggy reprimanded, her hands going to her hips.
No one answered, instead everyone’s eyes turned to Steve who did a sweeping glare then walked over to stand in front of Tony. The brunette quirked an eyebrow and Steve took an audible gulp.
“But I’m not doing anything!” Steve exclaimed jumping up to stand. “I’m stuck! I feel powerless...useless….” Steve trailed off sadly, his shoulders slumping in defeat. “I couldn’t do anything to save her. Lord Loki rejected even making a deal with me.” Steve sniffed to try and stave off his tears. “And now,” he sighed wryly. “I’m not worthy enough to even
“Wait!” Thor got up and grabbed the raven’s arm. “I’ll go with you.”
Tony kissed him. Then the brunette grabbed Steve’s erection and slowly lowered himself onto it. Tony stopped after taking a few inches and Steve couldn’t stop himself from thrusting up and fully sheathing himself in the man.
Loki was wrong! He was now on a pointless mission! This was all a waste of time! Once Loki learns this, he’ll be so mad and….and.
“Plus I should be the one escorting you home, not the other way around.” Steve added then pulled the brunette away from the waters edge.
“I’m sure you are.” Steve said while planting a kiss on the brunette’s cheek.
“We have to leave.” Steve ordered glancing at each Avenger. “Loki said he’s only targeting us. So we have to make sure the city’s not caught in the crossfire.”
“YOU INSOLENT-!” Amora ranted and threw insults but stopped abruptly when she noticed black mist pour out of the heros.
They were answered back with denials and some creatures offered up details of other humans who ventured into the Bog but none of the descriptions matched Tony.
Howard shook himself to break out of his memory and took a step back from the table. “Only this. Remember Loki is also the god of Mischief. He will try to trick you, test you.” Steve and Bucky could see the older man once again getting lost to a memory as he spoke. They shared a concerned look as Howard powered on. “But you must stay true in your resolve. You must never look back! If you do… it could cost you everything.”
The group had then all traveled together back to Thebes. Once there they set the record straight and assured Fury that the heroes would work with Bruce in getting his hulk form under control. Betty and Bruce then moved into the five’s home and the training began.
“No just unconscious.” Sam answered then shook his head “That’s going to be an awful headache.”
“So the mist is meant to hide you from the world?” Steve asked as he helped hold up a beam in place for Bucky.
Fenrir growled again but Sam fired an arrow at the beast. The wolf had to jump back in order to avoid being hit. Sam continued to fire arrows at the wolf but then Fenrir shrunk his size so he was now the size of a puppy.
“Actually you’re clever. You’re not risking it. You’re forcing
Upon unfurling the scroll a map began to magically be drawn up, it illustrated the landscape around him, outlined his home city, and showed where he was in relation to the closest underworld entrance. Unfurling it more, the map expanded and showed more detail of the surrounding area and more entrances in relation to where he currently was.
“I know,” Howard comforted rubbing circles on Steve’s back.
“I’m used to being sick, but Peg! Oh Peg!” Steve cried, “She’s always so strong and together! And even now, she’s trying so hard to protect everyone. Protect me.”
“Yes!”
“Is that...?” Sam questioned lifting a finger at the boy identified as Anthony.
Natasha gave him a smirk and Clint giggled next to her. She then ushered the rather large tour group inside the room. Clint asked the students to put their practice spears down and then went to collect them as Natasha waltzed over to stand next to Steve.
Tony was now taller than his mother but not by much, only a handful of inches. He discovered this when the woman walked over to him while he was sobbing then gently and hesitantly grasped his face so she could look at him. Feel him. Look into his tear filled eyes.
“My GODS!” Loki barked with another cruel laugh. “He’s manipulated you! I thought I raised you to be smarter than when you first came to me!”
“Yeah, he’s kinda useless in the love department.” Bucky agreed.
“We know Nat.” Clint assured.
Suddenly, he heard Rhodey’s voice calling him from one of the other rooms. Tony immediately jumped up off the cushions he had been lying face down on.
“Let’s hold that in, till we get to my private study.” Howard suggested then ushered them towards his private study.
“I am
“You insulted goddess Frigga and as “punishment” was gifted Asterion here!” Steve gestured to the crouching minotaur. “You then abused him and his mother!” At this the crowd’s eyes swept to the Queen who hadn’t looked away from Asterion, she had such a sorrowful but loving look on her face. “She got him to safety but you dragged him back here. You then lied and used him as a threat to try and gain control over your neighboring city states.”
After the play Tony and Steve walked in a garden behind the theatre. Most people exitted the theatre out to the street so they were alone. As they walked the grounds, both of them gushed and made comments about the performance and different variations of the story they had heard.
“And yet,” Loki continued from where he left off, completely ignoring Steve. “I have had the most difficult time trying to kill all of you.”
With his mouth looking like he bit a lemon, he glanced at Thor.
Natasha was nodding in agreement and even Clint looked to be seriously thinking Bucky's words over. Bruce however had his brows knit in frustration, as did Sam.
“And here I was looking forward to the spa session.” Tony teased with a sly smirk and Steve blushed crimson again.
“Then how can you be sure he actually is the Hulk?” Natasha questioned.
“You said you were no help. That’s wrong.” Tony elaborated and that just earned him a heavy sigh from Steve. “How can you see the skills and strengths in everyone but yourself?” Tony wondered aloud.
Loki then felt his deal with the Avengers become broken. His eyes bulged and his mouth dropped open in shock and horror.
“Hey Tones.” Rhodey cut in and knocked the brunette with his tail. “Can we get a drink? I’m about to keel over.”
“I am NOT being manipulated!” Tony yelled back.
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve let out a sigh of defeat.
Here is a ko-fi I asked for from
“What did you say Punk?!”
-------
After a few seconds of silence Rhodey turned to Tony and smiled. “I’m proud of you.”
“Oh wow!” Steve gasped and Tony smirked.
“Oh please.” Loki huffed, then with a snap vanished.
However as Natasha came at him, Fenrir shrunk then darted in and clamped down on Sam’s leg. Sam let out a shout of pain and everyone shouted his name as they raced to try and help.
“You’ll fit in just fine here.” She then turned and continued walking. Sam knocked Bucky’s shoulder with a friendly grin and followed after the red head.
