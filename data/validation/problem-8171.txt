"Well, Captain Rogers," Stark said.  "What can I do for you?  I assume you had a reason for this meeting, and I have more important things to do.  Do you need more equipment for the team?"
He picked up the other gun as well, making his way out of the cavern.  He ducked behind a rock when the Ten Rings guards passed, feeling his heart rate jump as he rubbed his eyes.  Everything was fuzzy around the edges, but he couldn't stop to think about that now.  He had to get out of here.  He had to avenge Steve.
"Tony," Steve said, his voice choked.
Tony Stark was in the kitchen.  Which was not an unusual thing, considering the Avengers took most of their meals there instead of in the fancy, overbearing dining room reserved for special occasions.  What was unusual was that Tony was
It was a white contraption of three long sticks moving in a circle gracefully.  It didn't have any sort of mechanism to move it that Steve could see.  He touched one of the sticks and it stopped moving.  When he pulled his hand away, it started again.
"Damocles!" Kang roared.  "Answer me!"
With that, he left.  Maybe he didn't always have patience in spades, but stubborn?  That he could do.
Still, Iron Man stayed for clean up this time, which eased the exhaustion settling over them all.  Someone, probably Tony, had thought to bring food for all the volunteers, which Steve's metabolism appreciated.  He grabbed a hot dog and started to walk towards one of the trees for a bit of shade before he got back to work.
Tony shook his head.  He would definitely rather Steve be someone else right now, but his injuries weren't that bad.  Not enough to call in Rhodey or Pepper and drag them away from their sleep, no matter how much a hug from one of them would be nice.
"Tony-"
"This is relaxing for me.  Is it relaxing for you?" Steve asked cheekily, glad his friendship with Natasha held the same sort of ease as his camaraderie with the Howling Commandos.  Being with her like this did help relax him.
He grabbed Stark's wrist before he could leave.  "Tell me what the favor you did her was."
"Woe is me," Tony said with a dramatic sigh.  "I need to be ravished here and now, Jan."
slept in worse places - but the importance of talking to Tony was what jarred him from his sleep in the first place.
Tony nodded.  "There's no cutting in spaghetti, so why not?"
Steve balled his fists, but didn't go after her.  Clint smiled at him, squeezing his shoulder before picking up his own hot dog.  "Are you going to go after him?"
Steve was very careful of his strength when he heard the name of their benefactor.  Crushing the glass of juice would only make things more awkward between him and Iron Man, and he was better than that.  He hated the small amount of jealousy that flared up at the reminder of Iron Man's employer.  Iron Man had the right to choose, and he had chosen his loyalty to Stark.
He twitched violently before he remembered not to move, crying out in pain as the metal of his own suit cut further into his leg.  He heard a few pebbles fall nearby, but nothing big.  Tony bit his lip and forced down the panic.  Someone would find him.  It's only been thirty minutes.
"Yeah," Tony said, though how he'd be leaving was up for debate.
He huffed out a breath, swallowing again, this time hard.  Why hadn't Tony told them in the first place?  Why hadn't Steve noticed how both Iron Man and Tony had the same mannerisms or reactions when they were hurt?  Had he been that blinded by his crush?  Had he misjudged Tony that much, even when Steve was so familiar with that kind of judgement himself?
"Most of it's easy to heal," Steve said with another puff of smoke and a sigh.  "I didn't see anything worth investigating up there."
"This is not a fight that can be won, Steve," Wanda said, her voice gentle.  "You know there are things more important than our lives here.  It's more than just us in danger."
"Come on then.  Sam and Steve are waiting already," Peggy said.
Steve shook his head.  "The world doesn't need a relic that's grieving.  It needs someone that can help protect it."  Tony looked stricken at the words, but Steve pushed forward, because he wasn't sure he could finish if he stopped now.  "I didn't have anyone left that I wouldn't be a burden to.  I got locked in my head because I couldn't put my problems on anyone else.  You helped with that, and gave me something to focus on that wasn't from the 40s.  You helped me through so much, Shellhead.  You were a friend when I needed it most."
Tony snapped his eyes back to Steve, who was wearing a shirt that barely fit him and navy slacks that hugged his thighs.  The shirt had the first few buttons undone as if he were teasing Tony.  Yeah, no.  Work could wait.
The Avengers alarm went off before Tony could finish, and Steve cursed silently as he scrambled to his feet.  "Do
He looked up at Tony's offended noise, finding himself on the end of a glare that was dangerously close to a pout. "Steve, money is not a problem. You know that, right? I'm pretty sure I have programs and scholarships that help artists to afford this kind of thing somewhere. Pepper's big on art."
It wasn't the worst way to wake up, Tony reflected.  In fact, it was rather pleasant.  Carefully, he started to pet Steve's head.  Steve didn't wake, but there was a low grumbling sound that wasn't unlike a purr.
Tony felt Steve's pain, claws tearing into the dragon's shoulder.  It snapped him out of the daze the skull had put him in and he turned to race back to Steve.  But he couldn't turn, and his arms pulled as he tried to move.  "Steve!  What-"
"I'm heading out in an hour or two to try and find intel on Clint and Natasha," he said, pulling at the neck of the uniform.  He had the cowl down since he was still in the Tower, and a few minutes ago that was comfortable.  But now he couldn't hide his nerves behind it and his Captain America persona, and he wasn't entirely sure how to talk to this man.  Rhodey was a superior officer, but also one of Tony's closest friends.  There was a middle ground out there somewhere, but Steve would probably stumble a lot trying to find it.  "I wanted to sit with him a while before I left.  I don't know when I'll be back."
.  He shouldn't be this annoyed because Steve was being a cuddle bug, and he knew it wasn't because Steve thought he was fragile, no matter what the dark voice in his coding told him.
"Steve, you can't give up like this!  I can fix it," Tony promised, refusing to move.  Peggy was...  She was one of the first dragons he'd really talked to.  She'd always been there when he had problems with Steve, and Christ, Sharon...  Grief fueled into useless fury.  He couldn't be helpless to avenge her.  "I can do this.  I can-"
Tony thought back to Wanda's cheek against his, the raw power of her magic with the kindness underneath.  She'd always let him know there was hope and it wasn't his fault.  He clenched his jaw, sharp anger burning through him that he could feel reflected in Steve.
"Baseball innuendo?  Really?" Tony asked, trying not to laugh at how ridiculous a goof Steve was being.  It would only encourage him.  "America's golden boy dirtying America's favorite past time?"
"Am I always going to have Steve in the back of my mind?  It's unnerving," he said, shaking his head to clear it.
"How come I've never heard of this guy?" Tony said, leafing through the articles.
"Because we're not a team, we're a time bomb," Bruce said, and normally Steve would worry about the green tint in his eyes, but he was too angry at Iron Man for ignoring him.
"I'm terribly sorry, Captain, but Iron Man is also currently unavailable," JARVIS said apologetically.
Steve wondered how long the apologies were going to work.  There was obviously something wrong, but that didn't excuse Tony lashing out.
"You never talk this much," Tony said finally, glad there was only a slight note of hysteria to his voice.
"He had a bad reaction to the Skrull sedative," Susan said.  "We're just trying to help him.  Kes, it's me.  You're safe."
Tony made double sure not to glance up at Steve, but Rhodey seemed to notice anyway.  Rhodey's eyes softened, and Tony leaned in when Rhodey threw an arm around his shoulders.  "You sure know how to pick 'em," Rhodey said.  "Still, I think you've finally found good taste.  Him and Pepper are much better than the last few you've crushed on."
"The spies have been released," Doom interrupted.  "Though they would not accept my offer of transport, so they will take longer to arrive.  They have been treated better than Fury's spies deserve."
Steve clamped down on a throw pillow, forcing his fingers to relax before he tore the fabric.  The words burned through him and half of him wanted to argue back.  But he was supposed to be listening in, not giving himself away.
Tony felt a heat blooming in his chest that had nothing to do with the heart pump.  Making sure that his walls were still high, he leaned against Steve's flank, allowing the touch to calm the agitation in Steve's movements.  "I'm okay," he said, letting Steve feel a little of what was behind his walls.  "Just tired.  Ended up in a tussle with a naga that pulled me pretty far down the river, and I never found the source of the scream.  I'm just tired from trying to find my way back.  Sorry for worrying you."
"Very," Tony replied, rubbing his eyes in an attempt to add the variables again.
"I'm fine," Tony said as they both pushed him away from the temple.  A little bruised and honestly, he'd had better emotional days, but mostly fine.  "I'm okay.  Just like I promised.  Are you-"
He was looking at Tony now and he wasn't sure what to do with the scrutiny now that he had it.  "Just thinking."
Steve finished the last waffle, feeling like he had more food for thought than his stomach was prepared to handle.
JARVIS didn't answer right away, and Steve waited patiently.  "Mr. Stark wishes to inquire if you are down there to destroy the machine?"
Mem: Please check the next chapter for lovely art by Kelslk!
"You don't have to do this," Tony forced himself to say, not thinking of the tentacles as he swallowed back the bile.  At least he was in the armor this time.  "Why are you following Hydra?  You have to know what they do in their experiments!  Why go from big game stealing to them?"
"I'm not asking you to trust me, Captain," Tony said, picking up a wrench.  "I'm asking you to leave me alone, because I'm not telling you anything more.  I know which one I'm actually likely to get."
Tony woke up with a gasp, pump working overtime to regulate his heart.  It was hard to see, but he could feel Steve trembling around him.  "Steve," Tony said, petting Steve's head gently before thinking better of it and rubbing his cheeks.  "Steve, come on, buddy.  It's a dream.  Wake up."
Tony was.
He didn't look up from the drawing, but he felt Thor's hand on his shoulder and fought against leaning into it.
"Oh, they're all hot," the girl with glowing eyes said.  "I told you this was a good idea."
"You gonna do it?" she asked, not letting up.
Of course, now they could all see the machine Tony had been making, looking just as new and shiny among the rubble as he had seen it the day Kang attacked.  It was like it hadn't gotten the memo to be run-down like everything else.  Tony coughed, but continued talking.  "And this is the machine that will do it.  You'll find the blueprints of it in the text being sent with this message.  We worked it out the first time ourselves using the late Dr. Foster's notes.  It took years for Tony One to gather the materials.  The second time around was easier.  We figured out a way for the machine to survive the time shift, along with some stolen tech from Kang's chair to keep Tony Stark from disappearing from the time line when we go in.  It'll still kill us, but the time line won't be altered so that we don't exist.  Won't keep us
"Of course, sir.  We'll send word immediately."
"Not even the first time," Tony said, waving it off.  "Actually, I kind of liked the color."
"And no, you didn't die," Rhodey said, a tired but blinding grin on his face.
"I'm sorry for leaving," Steve said.  "I shouldn't have, especially not because I was angry and scared.  I... probably would have felt better, staying with you.  And you wouldn't have been left behind."
Thor had been standing protectively over Tony, but he stood aside when Rhodey clanged closer.  The face plate shot up despite how cold it was and Tony could see a pair of worried brown eyes looking down at him.  "Thought I told you not to worry me like that," Rhodey said, his voice rough without the suit.
"I..."  He didn't know what to think about the bond.  Part of him was terrified, and Tony could feel the hurt from Steve at that thought.  This was why sharing emotions was horrible.  "Damn it, sorry.  This is why we...  I don't like hurting you."
He nearly fell off the ledge when Steve touched his cheek, only Steve's wing stretched behind him, keeping him from falling over.  "The exhaust doesn't bother you?" Tony asked, trying to look over his shoulder before he remembered his reduced visibility.
Susan took a deep breath and nodded.  He couldn't see her, but he was monitoring the suit.  She could deal with this.  She had to.  "I thought I'd feel good once she..."
"Right here," Steve said with a shrug, holding up his hand with the ring.  "I still love you.  That wasn't affected by the changes."
"Everything else?" Tony asked, but he let himself be pulled without fuss.
He washed his clothes first, setting them on the hot stones to dry, then himself.  Surprisingly, the water of the massive bath (swimming pool more like, but Tony was admittedly smaller than a dragon) was only warm and not scaldingly hot.  He suspected Peggy and Sam had a hand in that, but he refused to ask them how since he also suspected they'd take great delight in informing him that it was magic.
"You too, Steve," Natasha said, cutting the call.
"He's over there," Tony pleaded.  "We can't...  We have to bring him with us."  He couldn't leave Steve alone in the cold cave.  The least he could do was bury him properly somewhere warm.
"Are you going to come in or just stand there and stare?" Tony asked, not looking up from the machine.  Steve was momentarily distracted by his arms, which were bare and surprisingly well-toned.
"What?"  There had to be a more intelligent response to that, but Tony couldn't think of one.
"Thank you," he said, shaking her hand gratefully.  "I won't let this meeting go to waste."
"So you've said," Steve replied, wincing at how angry he sounded.
"Glad to know that legacy died out," Tony muttered, though there was a dark look in his eyes.  "I used to make weapons before Iron Man.  Lots of innocent people died because I wasn't paying enough attention."
Tony laughed.  A real, genuine laugh that Steve found himself drawn to.  This was nice, sitting here like this.  It was like he had found a place again.  The kitchen was more expensive and high tech, but if Steve closed his eyes he could picture his old apartment with Bucky or Peggy sitting by him.  Except now it was Tony, awkward and hurt, but still warm enough to draw Steve into his orbit like the moon that could only reflect Tony's brilliance from afar.
“Do you want to stay for dinner?” he asked but already knew the answer, they were going to go find their big brain, which would probably be Bruce.
Tony had been in a good mood all day, even when he walked back into his dorm after having to deal with his classes, and acting like he didn’t know half the shit his professors were talking about. He turned in his story, after adjusting enough of it so that it wasn’t about superheroes or resembled fanfiction, he didn’t care as long as his professor liked it. Now he was waiting for Steve to show up so that he could help him out. He hadn’t even noticed when Bucky had come in and out, which meant that he was too out of it for his own good, but it didn’t matter at all, the semester was almost at its end, and the Thanksgiving break was coming fast. He was happy for once, really happy and not just sort of happy, well if that was a thing.
“What’s happening Fri?” he asked as he walked forward.
“Yeah, but it was nice to feel full,” Tony told him as he sat up shifting until he was propped up.
“Not really, but I mean... well we only ever really talk about other things, not really food, but it’s one of the things that I would like to understand better about you.”
Avengers were the norm for popping up left and right, Kamala attaching herself to Carol who was almost always with Rhodey, and Steve thought it was interesting but let them be. Kamala proudly proclaiming herself as Ms. Marvel, after Tony had left the kids with Carol and Rhodey so that they would have an anniversary weekend.
The moment they all walked off and got into the suits though, he could feel his hands shaking, even having Shuri help mass produce the suits with the same nanoparticles that he had for his Iron Man suit, well it hadn’t helped. Yes, they would be protected, and yes, the particles could adjust to whatever they needed, but they wouldn’t be safe at home, and he could lose everything. Hell, he could get stuck somewhere in the Quantum Realm and never come back.
“Where’s everyone else going?”
They had to take the campus shuttle towards where Steve’s house was, this was something that Tony hadn’t known, mainly because Steve was almost always nearby so Tony had assumed that his place was within walking distance. But he also knew that Steve had a car so most likely he drove towards campus and at times went out of his way to make sure that Tony got home safe from the library. It was things like this that Tony knew they needed to talk about, because even though they talked they didn’t talk about the mundane things in their lives. He wanted to know more about Steve Rogers, for some reason he craved it, but it also scared him.
“Okay... yeah... sure,” Tony said wondering if this was going to be the thing that would bring them together, or keep them apart.
Tony hummed as Steve led him to the bed, slowly making him sit down so that Steve could take off Tony’s shoes and lay him down. Steve couldn’t help but smile when Tony sent him a quick wink before yawning again. It took some work on Steve’s part to help Tony get ready for bed, as the genius was flopped over half asleep already. He quickly took off Tony’s jeans and almost laughed when he saw the Captain America boxers that Tony had on, before tucking him into the bed.
“I’ve been trying to survive for a while,” she had told him. Of course, Tony had an instinct to help, it’s one of the reasons why he was constantly upgrading Peter’s armor even though he wasn’t there anymore, or upgrading things for the Avengers, he needed the hope that they would find a way to help after all of the devastation.
“Yeah, whatever,” Steve said, he knew that Darcy would say yes, she liked Clint, she had asked him a million questions about Clint the first time the man had shown up in the store. It was weird because she was a Political Science student in the master’s program at one of the nearby schools, but she was the loudest outgoing person he knew.
“Not if we strictly follow the rules of time travel,” Scott said to them. “That means no talking to our past selves, no betting on sporting events -”
The hour passed in a flurry of activity from Tony, he typed faster than normal, adjusting Ty’s half of the story and fixing it to work better, adding things here and there so that the flow worked better than it had before. Ty stopped by a few times, explaining how he wanted to write a story where the villain and the protagonist fall in love, he called it the anti-love story, because it wouldn’t end well for either of them. Stories like this were easy for Tony, because of past experience with one of his former relationships, though he wasn’t going to share that with anyone.
Before Strange could answer, Hulk, and War Machine took their places, as Carol landed next to Rhodes. This was their family, these were the people they had fought so hard to bring back, and he wasn’t going to let Thanos take them away, not again.
“Right. - What are we improvising?” Scott asked and Tony looked at him for the first time.
“It’s going to be fine Tony, you know nothing happened, I’ve been nothing but honest with you from the moment we met.”
“Nothing in life is fair Tony,” Steve said smiling at him. “We’re both hard, and I’m planning on finishing this now, because I have to eat soon, and while I like eating your beautiful cock, my meds require actual food.”
“We’ve talked, and I talked to Tony about taking some time off,” she said smiling. “Who knows maybe after you guys come back we can talk about it more.”
“Alright children,” Tony said feeling weird that he was all of a sudden being an adult over the guy with literal fucking children and a walking talking racoon, but then there’s also a walking tree so his life was just going to be that weird and he was just too tired to really care. “Let’s get to the matter at hand, because I’m supposed to be on bed rest, and not refereeing your bickering.”
“We want to help,” Kamala said looking at him with a hopeful look.
“Somewhere under all this. All I know is he doesn't have them, and he won’t get them either if I have a say in this,” Tony told them, he wasn’t going to let Thanos destroy their lives again.
“You’re insane, no wonder you don’t sleep, geez, I feel like I’m going to have to keep you fed.”
“I never thought that far, but I wouldn’t mind another one,” he turned his head and kissed Steve on the lips. “I wouldn’t mind having our own little family here, plus I’m sure that the Avengers are going to start popping in more often, and Clint’s going to want to live nearby.”
“What if they come back with bad news?”
“You’re the one that picked the class,” Steve said picking up his backpack. “I don’t even know why I agreed to it, I could have taken an extra history class.”
“I had been so worried, you want to know why,” he asked waiting for Steve to shake his head. “Morgan and I blew up the TV earlier.”
He had seen him in the gossip rags they sold, the face was noticeable and honestly why would Tony Stark waste his time on a small independent bookstore when his family had as much money as they did. He turned away from the group and focused on fixing the broken shelf that had been in front of him. One of their regulars, who had been trying to flirt with Darcy, had accidentally fallen into the shelf and broken it, and Steve just wanted to deal with that and not the constant rumors of whether Stark was coming into the store or not.
“Steve it’s only Rhodey’s sweater nothing more.”
The voices on the other side of the glass drew his attention, they were talking but the glass muffled the sound, but on the other side in all of her glory was Peggy Carter. Tony called her the one that got away for him, which was true but still bothered him to hear, because from the look in Tony’s eyes, Steve knew what his husband thought. He knew he wouldn’t trade his life for anything, his time with Peggy had gone, there was no going back, not anymore.
“Yeah well remind me to never piss off your dad, I don’t want to be in the story as a dead soldier either,” Bucky said before changing his shirt and looking at himself in the mirror.
“Hi,” Tony said, and if his voice squeaked just a little it didn’t matter, this was real, he was meeting Steve’s parents. His last relationship was all family and business, and his parents already knew the people, sometimes it felt like his parents were trying to socialize him, but then it almost always backfires, so this was new.
“I know,” Tony said before silence overtook the room. They had all lost so much in the last few weeks, and Steve knew what Tony’s death would have done to not only those in the room, but to the family they had made over the years.
“Tony,” Steve growled at him, but Tony decided to slowly put in a second finger as Steve called out his name, the groan that Steve made was worth the wait.
“Funny,” he said but sighed as he pulled away from the calculations he had been running. “I’m not, but I guess maybe it’s what we need right now.”
A few things, Tony will be back
From the moment he had seen the pictures on Tony’s side of the room, he dreamt of a man in a metal suit, hell he had sketched it, the image on Bucky’s roommates wall was something special and he knew it. Even when he had looked it up all he had found were people trying to make armored suits, nothing like the one he had seen. It felt wrong now to look at the images, now that Tony had rushed off angry at him for being there, but he did so anyway, hoping to find out why this man was so close to the persona he had hated all of his life. It was strange but seeing Captain America from Tony’s point of view was changing his own view of the character that he grown up hating. Maybe it was because for so long, even with Bucky’s character being the Winter Soldier, a former nemesis and now sometimes ally of Captain America, or even his brother Peter’s character being there, well the comics never felt full to him, it was ideology mostly, though he knew plenty of people who loved the character, but it was still too much to live up to.
Steve wanted to apologize for a lot of things, he wanted to mostly make sure that his husband was alright. “If you could go back and tell him off would you?”
“And why are you asking for them?”
“Cap,” Tony said, which meant that something had gone wrong since Tony wasn’t calling him by his name. “We got a problem.”
“Sharon, I don’t see you that way,” he said with a smile as he pulled her hand away. “I mean you’re a great girl, but there’s someone I really like and I’m hoping that he likes me the same way I like him.”
“Yeah well you get that look on your face too,” Steve said trying to move past his friend. “Come on Sam I had a long day and I need to get some sleep tonight I have class in the morning,” he knew that he was whining, and he didn’t care at all mainly because as happy as he was that Tony had agreed, he was still tired from being on his feet all day.
“She’s on her way, she knew that he went with you.”
“We did stand. And yet, here we are,” the memory of the last battle he had been in, the memory of the lose he had suffered, everything he had gone through with Steve in the last five years, his kids, his life.
“We’d be going in short-handed you know?” Bruce was the first to speak.
The facility seemed quieter since they returned, when they had left everyone had been in high spirits, they joked around a little, yes, they were scared but they were Avengers again. It had been just another mission for them, another hurtle that they had to go through. Now with Nat gone, he could tell that they were trying their best, Thor stayed quiet preferring to watch as the others worked, Clint in the corner staring at the spot, even Steve knew, had been there for her. Carol and Rhodes had stayed away, just like Steve and Tony, they had gone to grieve on their own, Shuri had stayed behind with Clint, Bruce and Thor, when Tony had rushed off.
“That's right,” Tony said slumping into the chair.
“It’s held two days before Christmas, so a week after the end of the semester,” Tony told him, the end of the semester wasn’t that far away, he still had to finish all of his projects, and at some point, write a story for his fiction writing class.
“Ouch,” he called out as he stumbled towards his bed. “You really should stop doing that.”
, and it was the best thing he could have asked for. “When this is all over, you have to come for a visit, Morgan is so big, and Riri has some designs she wants to show you.”
“Hey, new girl,” Sharon said looking the other blonde in the eye. “Every one of these people know about what it’s like to be a superhero, they’ve all risked their lives helping people. And if you don’t mind me asking, where the hell have you been all of this time if you’re so inclined to say anything about this.”
“No, just you,” Tony said which only made Steve blush, it wasn’t what he was expecting to hear at all.
Peggy stood stock still for a moment, Steve saw her reach for her weapon, but when her eyes settled on Steve she stopped, her eyes wide. “Steve,” she said and it felt like the whole world stopped.
“Later,” Steve said not wanting his date to fall apart just because Tony wanted to invent something. “I’m going to introduce him to Mom and Dad and then we’re going to the yard and that’s it.”
“Okay, America’s Ass, I’m getting to it,” he said with a sigh, he actually missed Steve’s domineering side so much. “After you’re all plugged up, I’m going to feed you my dick little by little while I open my self up, and then when I’m good and ready, I’m going to ride you like a bronco.”
“Just.... it was a bad joke,” Bruce said letting out a laugh.
Without another word she walked out of the office, and all Steve could think about was just how tired he was. He needed to take a day off, because the last week has been a rollercoaster ride, hell the last month alone, but he would just take a few hours alone.
“Yeah, he does, but because of it he was always a little shy when it came to talking to other people, he’s not really good with human interactions, hell he’s in the middle of coding some kind of artificial intelligence, and he keeps saying that when done it would be based it on his butler,” Rhodes sighed before smiling at Steve. “This place has given him what M.I.T. or his own father wouldn’t have, a chance a being just another kid.”
“Just find the stones,” he grunts out, happy to hear his kids are safe. “They’re in a glove, but I don’t know where it landed.”
Honestly, Steve was pacing, he watched as Tony’s professor walked Tiberius to the Dean’s office leaving Tony in the room. He knew that Tony would be nervous, but what they talked about he wouldn’t know outside of what he overheard. Steve was glad that Tiberius would be getting some form of punishment, he knew how much it had hurt Tony to have part of his work stolen, they hadn’t discussed it much but when they had he saw the hurt in Tony’s eyes. He would have punched the guy if it hadn’t been for Tony, not that he didn’t deserve it, especially when Stone’s family used Tony’s connections to S.I. as a way to get in with the company.
“Or screw it up worse than he already has, right?” Tony said and he saw the look on Steve’s face.
“Is there anything we can do to speed this along?” he asked wondering if what Vision really needed was the stone, or a variation on the stone itself.
“Sorry,” Bruce said getting up, “We stayed up last night talking, and then the Hulk talked to him, so it was a little emotional.” Bruce made his way over to Thor and gently shook his away, “Thor, time to get up.”
“I know Tony, once we’re finished, we’ll take them home okay,” Steve told him before kissing him, the two of them a sight in full battle armor, like the gauntlet would have attacked them for using the stones the wrong way.
The first time Tony truly felt like they had moved forward in their relationship, farther than he would have thought, was when Steve took him on a picnic and for the first time look like he had come to terms with what had happened. Steve talked to him about everything that he had been doing, how he had accidentally drove all the way to Massachusetts because he hadn’t been paying too much attention.
Before they could answer someone knocked on the door, making Peggy push them into a closet in the corner of the room so that she could open the door and speak to the soldiers on the other side of the room.
“It was fine,” Steve said mainly because he didn’t want to give too much away. “I mean he actually is Tony Stark, but we went to Shake Shack and at burgers, it wasn’t anything fancy,” he wasn’t going to tell them that they had stayed out until almost three in the morning talking, while walking around Manhattan, which should honestly be a bad idea, but he hadn’t cared.
Now I'm going to go cry for a while, because I had to write this entire chapter and it hurt my soul.
Tony couldn’t hold back the laugh he had been holding in while watching the whole interaction play out. Even when Bruce came out with more tacos, giving some to Scott on the way to the ship so that he could leave with Rocket to drop the kids off at Peppers, Tony couldn’t stop laughing.
“I will Tony,” she said before cutting the call off.
“Tony, what’s going on?” Steve called out as he walked through the tower. “Tell me you found that cube.”
“...And secondly,” Bruce continued before Tony could say anything. “Time doesn’t work that way. Changing the past doesn’t change the future.”
“Oh, look. It’s like a little puppy, all happy and everything,” he said before making his voice sound like he’s talking to a puppy, “Do you wanna go to space? You wanna go to space, puppy? I’ll get you to space.”
“Not at all, but I do want to know if you’re going to be okay with him, I mean I saw what happened the other day, misunderstanding or not.”
“Yeah you kind of did,” Steve reached for the desk behind him, his wallet and his phone sitting there, he grabbed his wallet and took out the bill he had carried around with him, he didn’t spend it, he didn’t want too, it had taken him a long time to figure out what it said, but it had become the thing that made him take a chance and try. “This right here, this told me more than anything, and even though I thought that you didn’t really like me, just leaving this there was enough for me to know that I had a chance.”
“Why Thor? I mean it’s great and all, but why him. The whole coincidence with him and Bruce is one thing.”
“He used the stones again,” Nebula said looking at the screen in front of her.
“We should make sure everyone is ready,” his mother said smiling at him, her glittering gown changing from gold to red, Tony had picked it out when they had gone shopping his first day back from school. His mother had wanted to spend some time with him, feeling guilty over leaving him alone during Thanksgiving. “Plus, I want to meet this boy you’re seeing.”
“Nice to know that you understand my plans,” Steve smiled at him, and Tony couldn’t be happier with how they were with one another.
“Which means we have to pick our targets,” Clint said looking at them, for Clint the mind stone had fucked with him enough that Tony didn’t want Clint near their first battle together, he could only imagine what the man would do if he encountered Loki again.
“And it’s a good thing that they broke up because James is mine now and I’m not going to give him up,” she smiled, and Tony knew from that one smile that his sister was happy. It was something that they both wished for, even as Stark kids, because there would always be someone out there who would want to take advantage of them. They just needed to find the ones who would care for them and like them for who they are and not their family name.
What else would you like to see?
“I eat,” Tony said in his own defense, but he knew that without Jarvis to force him to eat he usually just hid out somewhere and ate whatever was nearby, or his lunches with Natasha and Jan, which only happened every other day, because he didn’t want the two of them to track him down.
“But we can’t,” Steve said sighing as he ran his hands up and down Tony’s arms. “But we can go somewhere, get our energy back, and try to find a way to fix it all when we’re ready.”
“Fine, but I’m buying my own supplies,” he complained but they all knew that he wanted to go, even if it’s for their sakes, he loved his friends had he mentioned that.
“No,” Bruce said to him. “No more pity, we’re going to try this, we’re going to bring them back.”
“Can it be anything, or should I grab something specific?” Clint asked.
“Time travel.”
“Yeah, sure,” Sam said, looking over at Steve before walking off rushing off to his room on the second floor.
“Ouch,” Steve said Tony saw a bit of hurt in his eyes, there’s always going to be the possibility that their past relationship was going to be a factor, but Tony wasn’t going to think about that, he wasn’t in any kind of relationship with Steve, they were just friends.
“I could just get the keys for the chalet in Aspen, my family hasn’t gone in a while and I’m sure my mom would be okay with us going,” Tony said smiling, “We could even ask to use the jet.”
For Steve, he was afraid of what Tony would think, but he was also thinking about what it would mean for SHIELD to know that he was there, alive and in the flesh. He heard a whimpering noise come out of Tony but neither said a word. Peggy quickly closed the blinds, giving them privacy, but looking at both of them warily.
It was eight in the morning and the only people in the store were him, Bucky and Natasha, everyone else usually arrived around noon, but the mornings were quiet enough to not have a full staff. Though they had hired more part-timers after the first few weeks, and Tony had in fact brought in a lot of business, so he was grateful for that. Natasha was sitting at one of the tables filling up the napkin holders for Bucky, and Steve knew that she was waiting for the answer to Bucky’s question. He loved his friends, but right now he wasn’t too fond of them.
, but stopped himself.
“Someone peed my pants,” Scott said looking down to see if it was coming out of the suit. “But I don’t know if it was “baby” me or “old” me... or just “me” me.”
His phone buzzed in his pocket, there was only two people in the whole place that knew what he was doing and even though he knew he should move and actually sit up and look at his phone, all he did was pull it out and turn his head, which isn’t the best position for reading text messages, but he didn’t care, he was too comfortable, the pillows were perfect and soft.
“Well he looks like he’s found a star, so as long as he treats you right it should be fine,” he told her and he really was genuinely happy for her about it as well. They deserved happiness no matter what, “The only thing that bugs me is how he doesn’t know we’re related, and honestly I’m not telling him either,” he liked the relationship him and Bucky had struck up, mainly just going to eat, because Tony hardly ate when alone, and talking about the students at school, their classes, and of course the love of Bucky’s life, his sister. Though he hadn’t mentioned his little crush on Steve, and that was something he was keeping to himself.
“Hi mom,” he said smiling to himself. He really loved his crazy family, “I was asking Peter to check the camping equipment for me but then he started fighting with Harley.”
“How about you?” Miles asked so that she would feel more comfortable sharing more with them.
Bruce held up his hands, doing what Tony often referred to as jazz hands whenever the kids did something, “Time travel.”
“All right. The glove's ready. Question is, who's gonna snap their freaking fingers?” Rocket said pulling him away from his thoughts. Steve walked through the door and looked over at Tony, which meant that they needed to talk but with the present situation at hand it was going to have to wait.
Tony walked away before Steve could say anything else to his husband, the other man was scared, he was scared for the kids, for the life they had built, he was scared of trying and losing everything he had. He knew this because he was scared too.
“Sorry,” Tony said looking down at his eggs, not sure if he actually wanted to eat them, his stomach a little uneasy.
“I’m not going to have it verified, my assistant controls my regular account which is verified, but that one, well it was supposed to be a private post, and I accidentally made it public, but since it was bringing in business I just kept going.”
“Does your dad put everyone he knows into his panels?”
“He cares about you,” Tony said actually thinking about all of the ways he felt when Steve looked over at Bucky, not knowing that there was two ways to look at a person. “I thought that he was still pining for you until last night,” Tony could feel the heat rising up to his cheeks, he had been so preoccupied about how Steve was in love with Bucky that he had missed every little detail of how Steve looked at him.
All he had wanted was a few minutes... was that too much to ask for, because apparently it was. He rolled over on the bed, wondering how long it would take for them to think that he wasn’t there, but he had made the mistake of answering the text messages from Natasha, so she knew that he was in the room. Getting up and moving off the bed was a task, one that he honestly didn’t care for, before walking towards the door.
“So, what does an arc reactor do?” because of course Steve would want to know, not that its heavily publicized at Stark Industries, his dad always said that it was just something that still needed work.
“Lightning,” Thor answered instead.
“Damn it V, I thought we were past this,” Tony said but it felt good to say it out loud.
Natasha stopped reading the article as she looked over at her brother who was currently sitting on his boyfriend’s lap. James had gone to pick up their dinner, earlier and now they were just sitting there eating a pile of Chinese food from Tony and Steve’s favorite place from the other side of town. The article had been published earlier in the day, but none of them had known about it until Natasha had gotten an email from her mother asking about her brother’s story. Mainly because it had reminded her about that time that their father had yelled at Tony for wanting to dance. The story was truthful about Natasha teaching her brother to dance, but the story deviated at some points becoming something close to a young boy learning to fly from just dancing.
Now, with Tony asking him to the gala everything felt so surreal in a way, mainly because he was sure that Tony would have told him to leave and never see him again without letting him explain a single thing. All he could do was smile, because he had been ready to beg, but now he just wanted to scold Bucky and Nat for telling him to stay away when he should have at least tried sooner to talk to Tony.
Everything changed after they got married, after they brought Riri into their lives, somehow, they both had a purpose, they had someone who depended on them. They were a family, extended from their Avengers family, Clint’s kids came over sometimes, while Clint was off doing god knows what, making Steve and Tony unofficial babysitters.
“He's scared,” Natasha said breaking Steve out of his thoughts.
Morgan Stark-Rogers' favorite pair of shoes were light up sneakers, they were cheap, and if Tony had his way they’d be in the trash just because they made what Tony dubbed and unholy screeching sound. The shoes were never thrown out, even with the threat constantly being made, but it was one of those things that Tony endured for his family, just like Steve’s need to draw in the lab, even though he had a studio. Miles’ need to tag up half of New York, even though Tony would have to pay the fines. Riri’s weird obsession with making her father into an A.I., which Tony found creepy and weird, but didn’t stop her. And Kamala’s need to follow Carol and Rhodey around like they were her gods, because Tony hadn’t expected to not be his kid’s favorite anything.
“I have given our dean your suggestions on the matter of Mr. Stone’s grade, and your thoughts about the whole thing, and she has taken them under consideration.”
The meeting, as any other that they’ve had since Steve started them, went the same, they drank coffee, and talked with friends at first, sometimes a new person showed up, and they got to know them. It was the one time during most of their week where they were allowed to grieve for the life they once had, the families they lost, the friends that they would never see again. Miles talked about his biological parents, telling the group about how his adoptive family has helped him, no one knew that Steve was one of his adoptive parents, Tony hadn’t wanted the kids to become targets because of their parents, so other than the papers that declared them a family no one actually knew that they were a family. Outside of the Avengers and their friends, the world only knew that Tony Stark had married Steve Rogers, they didn’t know that the couple had four kids, the only one that had been adopted publicly in anyway had been Morgan but even with her, they had made sure to keep everything quiet.
“About the great Steve Rogers,” she said with a smile on her face as she took a sip of her coffee. “Trust me, Rhodey and I have heard about you for years, though there was that brief period where he didn’t say anything about you, but that’s because I think you were dating someone and Tony hadn’t thought that it was his place to get between that, but you’ve been his crush for a very long time.”
Deciding on not listening to them, mainly because they wanted to either attack his inability to get a haircut, he tuned out the conversation, not wanting to say anything about his roommate because they kept asking, and concentrated on mapping out the schematics of the artificial intelligence project he was going to use as his final project. He was going to implement a part of it on Butterfinger’s brother and if it worked, he would try and work on a full-scale model for himself. He still didn’t have a name for it but as long as he kept working on it, well it would be alright.
Tony wanted to argue with the guy, but honestly he was too tired, “Listen, you’re loud when you get home, or it could just be that I’m a very light sleeper, but I blame that on having siblings who are little shits, even when they’re older than I am, but once I’m awake it takes me a while to get back to sleep so I go to the robotics lab and I work, or I hang out at the library for a little while.”
“Yeah, what kind of doctor was he?” she asked them and while Tony knew the answer was buried somewhere in his brain he wasn’t entirely sure.
"Good. You had me worried there. 'Cause that'd be horse shit. That's not how quantum physics works.”
“The same goes for you and Nat, I don’t want to die from seeing that, especially because she’s really good with knives, and I don’t want one flung at me if I walked in by accident.”
When Tony finally came out of the room, Steve was relieved, especially with the smile that Tony had on his face, it was a smile that Steve loved, but that was because he was falling for Tony, and would do almost anything to keep that smile on his face.
“Sit still,” he said to Steve as he ran the blunt edge of the scissors down Steve’s leg. “I don’t want this to end too soon because I cut you by accident.”
He remembered Tony saying that she was going to need someone to come home to, and now she had that and didn’t know how. But Tony would explain, as soon as they dealt with the fight ahead. The Wasp stood next to Ant-man taking Scott’s hand, they had survived one fight, now that they had their family back, they would need to survive this one. With a surprise landing, Pepper stood next to Tony with a smile.
“I remember that, and afterwards she ended up telling him that she only liked him as a friend, because as it turned out, she was already into someone else,” Natasha added which made Steve hate his friends just a little more.
“Yes Boss,” she said as he kneeled down next to Steve.
“Oh,” he said thinking that it sounded a little more like chaos than anything else, looking at the time, he couldn’t help but notice that he was going to be late to his next class. “I’ll head over after I finish with everything I have to do.”
I have a head canon that Lila Barton, in the future secretly fights under an alias, as in to hide it from her dad she becomes Kate Bishop, hence America and Kate are very much a couple in this story.
“It’ll be fine Scott, Thor will be there, all he would have to do is give my other self a little jolt,” Tony said before turning to Steve and giving him a quick kiss. “Sorry about the vomit breath.”
The man had not tact when it came to certain things, but Steve knew that this was Tony’s way for bringing the conversation forward before everyone decided to step back. Steve knew that Tony was one of the best people for this conversation, the man had battled addiction on and off for years, it was something that they discussed in detail especially after the kids came into their lives, because the one thing Tony hadn’t wanted was to be like his father in that respect. They had banned alcohol from the house because of it, only buying beer when they had get togethers with their friends and family.
“Well it’s up to you,” Bucky said as he walked out, his shower caddy in his hand, because the guy had long hair and of course he needed to get the smell of his job out of it before a date.
“How do you know that he would do anything at all?” Bucky countered dropping his stuff on the floor.
“I am mad at you, but I also know how much you hate it when I’m hurt so I’ll let it pass,” for the next few hours anyway, he got lucky because Steve still had to take those pills, which meant that he still had a chance, he just had to go to the workshop and get the arm restraints without anyone noticing, or stopping him. “Get some sleep, I’ll be here when you wake up.”
He worked on his first writing assignment that night, frequently getting messages from Ty, which was nice, they were becoming fast friends so maybe Tony could hide in the library when Ty was working. They had only talked by text, or during class, Tony often rushing off towards his next class, because his father had made sure that his schedule was packed so that Tony wouldn’t stray from where he was supposed to be going in his life. The messages were a reprieve, his first college friend outside of knowing his roommate, his own sister and their childhood friend. At least it fit Natasha’s criteria that he needed to socialize, so that was one very huge upside to the whole thing.
Tony knew it was awkward, his little crush on Captain America, hell his roommate’s friend looked like Cap, and Tony automatically had a crush on the guy, too bad, from the way he had seen Bucky walked the guy out, Tony knew it wasn’t meant to be. He was already in a relationship with Tony’s roommate, though it was nice to dream about falling for someone as nice as Steve had been especially since Steve hadn’t known that he was a Stark from the first moment that they had met. Tony of course had lied to his roommate about what he was going to do that night, he really just wasn’t ready to step out there and have dinner with someone he didn’t really know. Blame it on being poisoned and kidnapped growing up, it was a common thing with the Stark kids, though it hadn’t happened since he had been six, it was still possible, the poisoning happened in high school though he was never sure if that one had been meant for him or for Natasha. All Tony remembered was waking up in the hospital, after being in a coma for three days, and that two of the school’s biggest bullies had been expelled for it. So, it could have just been for Tony, he would never have known.
“Anyway, just don’t be too hard on him,” Barnes said patting the suit’s shoulder. “He just loves you the most.”
“We’ll work on whatever we can here,” Tony said trying to show a little bit of confidence to his friends. “I’ll see about reviving Vision with Shuri, who knows maybe she’ll have some ideas about what to do with the notes we have from the scepter of doom.”
Deep in his own thoughts he had almost missed what Steve had said only catching the tail end of the words. Steve had repeated it after Tony had explained that he was a little confused about what was happening. Mainly because he couldn’t get out of his head long enough to listen to anyone, especially when the failure was one that would haunt him.
“Hello,” Thor said beaming at their mother.
“I like yours too,” Peter said before his eyes widened. “Oh my god you’re like me,” he said and Miles just smiled.
Steve wasn’t sure if they were going on a suicide mission, it made his former life seem like a cake walk compared to what they were going to walk into. He didn’t regret becoming Captain America, he didn’t regret ending up in the ice if it meant that he had these people in his life, this family they’ve created, then it was worth all of the pain and heartache that he has suffered over the years. It made having Tony in his life worth it.
“It... it can’t be undone,” Clint said, and Tony could hear the heaviness in the man’s voice, there was something about losing someone close to you that made it all the more painful, and for all of them Natasha was family.
“My friends call me Mr. Secretary,” Pierce said, while Tony had to bite his tongue before he said something else. “I’m going to have ot ask you to turn that prisoner over to me.”
Steve just waved as Tony walked into the building, grinning like an idiot, he didn’t work the next day because he had classes, but he knew that he needed the coffee. He couldn’t help the happy thoughts floating through his head as he drove home. He had taken a chance at getting Tony’s attention, he hoped that just a few hours of studying, he could get to know him better and maybe they could move closer to something more. The feeling had been there, since the beginning, as rough as it had been, but he wanted this chance to get to know Tony better.
“Look, we go back, we get the stones before Thanos gets them... Thanos doesn't have the stones. Problem solved,” Scott said to them.
The bed shook as she pulled away from the wall and turned to him, her face was angry because Natasha always knew when something was wrong, even when they hadn’t really hung out with one another for weeks, “Who do I have to kill,” she said and he knew that she would do it if he was hurt too badly.
“No laughing,” Clint said but Steve couldn’t help it, because now Clint had brought it up and he was laughing in the man’s face.
“Is that it,” Steve said from where he sat. “We don’t know what happens to them.”
The paper in his hand was warm, it smelled like coffee and Steve which was an odd combination to have, because he thought of Steve as someone who drank sports drinks and water. He couldn’t help but feel a little happy over getting Steve’s number, he quickly pulled out his phone and typed it in with a grin on his face before walking towards library. He folded the paper Steve had given him and put it in his wallet behind a picture of him and Nat at graduation, with their brothers in the background. No one needed to know that it was there and that Tony was saving for some odd reason.
Tony could hear Hulk ranting about taking the stairs as he monitored the elevators as they descended the tower. “All right, Cap. I got our scepter in the elevator just passing the 80th floor.”
“Tony, this is on me,” Steve said trying to interrupt but Tony just shook his head.
The city seemed as though the world stopped moving forward, it was a dreary scene to behold every time that Steve drove towards his weekly group meeting. The fact that a city that always seemed so alive with people, even in the darkest of times, now seemed as though it stopped moving at all. Whenever he drove in with Tony, he always made sure to keep the conversation going, to keep Tony especially from looking out at what the city looked like. For them, home was an isolated place, where only a few came near, there was nowhere around that would remind them of their one failure, it was a place for them to be able to move on from what had happened.
“I’ll hold you to that,” Tony said, neither of them making the move to let go. It was a comfort that he was willing to take.
Tony moved away from the bed and grabbed the small box off of the bedside table. Laying it down at the foot of the bed he slowly took everything out of the box, first out course was the bottle of lube, which honestly wasn’t a new thing, but this one was made to Tony’s specifications because he sometimes got a allergic reaction to some of the more mainstream lubes. The second thing was the cock ring, which was also colored like his Iron Man suit, and honestly just having Steve wear his colors was a new kink for him. Though Steve wouldn’t let Tony make a red and gold Captain America uniform, so this was the next best thing. The vibrator was last, which was directly connected to his watch so that he didn’t have to find a remote which was sometimes a hassle when things got knocked around.
“Is it?”
“Love,” he said, he couldn’t focus on anything, but he just wanted to say the word, he was going to hold onto Steve for as long as he had him. His arms were burning from being bound up, even as he struggled to get free.
“Wait what?” Scott looked at him dumbfounded by what he just said.
To his surprise, when he walked in Steve was sitting on Bucky’s bed sending Tony a megawatt smile, which honestly should be illegal in any country, Tony wasn’t even sure why he was in the room in the first place, Tony hadn’t seen Bucky since he had gone to class earlier so he didn’t know how Steve had gotten into the room.
“So, we keep it that way, we need a plan,” Steve already in captain mode and while Tony was happy about it, he knew it was a fool's errand.
With a smirk on his face, Thanos calls forth an army larger than the one Steve had seen in Wakanda five years before. He wants to run at him, if it meant protecting the ones he loved, he’d take down the world.
“Yeah whatever you punk,” Bucky threw one’s of Tony’s pillows at him before grabbing his leather jacket. “Now come on, I’m dragging you to this party, Sharon is going to be there and she’s been asking for you for a while.”
“I would like that, thank you,” Thor said to him.
“I know, he hasn’t stopped talking about Iron Man since he first saw the picture on your wall, I can tell when something has caught his interest, but I just want to be the one to protect him, because to me he has always been the one to take care of everyone.”
“Decide if you’re going to go while I shower,” Bucky had told him, and although Tony really had to finish his bot by this weekend, he was tempted to actually go.
“Steve,” he groaned as he added a second fingers and started scissoring himself open, Steve groaned, and it was enough to send sparks up Tony’s spine. Steve’s eyes opened as Tony started using his hair for leverage with his other hand, Tony knew that the small bite of pain from his scalp was worth it for Steve, especially when he was in charge of Tony’s pleasure.
Steve kissed him on the head, it was nice to just sit here and talk like this, “Who knows, we’ll have to ask her one day.”
“So,” Ty sat down in front of him a huge smile on his face his little leather-bound notebook in front of him. “I hope this isn’t too much, but I wrote all of the dialogue, I’m horrible at exposition, it’s why I got a B- on the last story, but I’m great at dialogue, so I hope that you can write something around this and we could edit from that.”
“Good job. I'm saved,” he said kissing her on the head, before turning to Nat, Hope, Scott and his own husband. “I wish you'd come here to ask me something else. Anything else. Honestly, I... I missed you guys,” he said to the other three. “it was... Oh, and table's set for nine.”
“Yes! But you're not gonna like where it's parked,” Valkyrie said from above them.
Bruce and Shuri started pressing buttons, Steve wasn’t sure what any of it did, at this point everything was to test one theory or another.
“You mean that guy I hit, he was just in the way, she had no right,” the guy yelled out, but Steve was already on her other side, trying to stop her from doing anything else. “I wasn’t doing anything.”
“He said we were being reckless,” Harley said in the background.
Was it evil of him to take advantage of Steve, well yes it was, but Tony was never sure if Steve liked playing dom to their little arrangement? Although there was that one time at the party where Steve got possessively jealous, which was nice. It’s always nice especially after a long day of work, and Tony worked harder than most of the team, mainly because he was bankrolling the team, but it was nice to have someone else take control for once. Plus, Steve’s muscles whenever they picked him up, made Tony all hot and bothered, hell just watching the man work out was enough for him to come untouched.
“We’ll make it back, and the kids will be there waiting for us.”
“I wasn’t really looking,” he said which was the truth, he had been looking for something more up to Tony’s standards and ended up finding the fixer upper instead. “I guess we just needed something to do for a little while.”
“Okay,” Bruce said motioning towards Hope. “When I say kill the power to the tunnel, you kill the power.”
It was warm and his pillow was hard, but it felt comforting for some reason and smelled like coffee, so he burrowed himself deeper into the feeling. It felt nice, until the door slammed against the wall and his pillow jumped before falling off the bed with a thump. That was when he knew that it hadn’t been a pillow, but it had been a very real Steve and his hard muscles that Tony had been snuggling into. Tony had almost forgotten that they had climbed into the bed together, he had been so tired that he had gotten into bed without realizing it and fallen asleep, he thought that he had been dreaming the whole thing and that he was still working on his project.
“Steve,” Tony called out from the bed his eyes wide open staring at him. “How… why are you here?”
“I know who they are, though I’m not sure if it’s a joke of if it’s real, because there’s no way in hell anyone named Stark was going to our school,” Bucky said and Steve thought that maybe it wasn’t a Stark, but someone who just so happened to share the name. Rogers was a common name, even Steve Rogers was common, with more than a few popping up all over the country.
He thought to himself, the answer was that one person would, and she had just swung the door open and cleared her throat.
“I'm gonna stop you right there, Scott. Are you seriously telling me that your plan to save the universe is based on Back To The Future?”
“That’s what you want,” he joked while looking at the helmet. “How did you find this?”
Tony put his arm around her in a half hug, “Don’t worry kid, we’ll get them back.”
“That's right,” he said to her. “I won't. Leave it. Got a family,” he looked directly at his husband who was now standing there quietly. He hadn’t heard Morgan run out to him until Steve’s eyes darted to their daughter.
“He’s on a date, so I doubt he’ll answer the phone at all,” he said quickly knowing that when Bucky was with his someone, he wouldn’t answer the phone, the guys thought it was because Bucky was trying to get laid, but mostly it was because Steve’s parents had a no phones at the table rule, and at the moment he was glad that Bucky had learned to follow it while they grew up.
“No, wait,” Steve called out, stopping Thor from doing anything. “Hulk, are you okay?”
“Aw, can we keep him,” Shuri said a smile on her face, for some reason Scott’s ordeal had given them all something to laugh about. Steve was sure that FRIDAY was recording because this was something that they were all going to have a laugh over when Scott was back to normal.
All of a sudden Clint’s phone started ringing, pulling them out of their conversation and making them all turn towards the thing as it vibrated on the table. Clint looked at them before looking at the phone rushing to pick it up, almost dropping it as he saw the name on the screen. His face lit up with joy, “Honey,” he said into the receiver. “Honey.”
“Is that even safe?” Tony asked knowing that Clint’s competence in the kitchen left something to be desired most days.
Slowly he moved off Steve, making sure to rub himself one more time against Steve’s cock for good measure, before kneeling on the bed next to Steve’s tied up body. Steve’s eyes never left him, and while Tony never got nervous when it came to anything, he was nervous about cutting Steve’s clothes off of his body without cutting him. Steve was already injured, and Tony didn’t want to hurt him more than he was already.
“Natasha,” Steve called out as he walked in. “Don’t threaten the man, trust me I’m sure that Tony’s lawyers would be enough to keep him out of here and anywhere else for a very long time.”
“That wasn’t true either, though Sharon and I are friends, my buddy Sam had a huge crush on her.”
“Don’t do anything mean to him,” Sharon called out as they disappeared up the stairs. “I’ll come after you if you do.”
“You’re moping again,” Bruce said as he walked into their shared office, because while Tony taught in one department and Bruce in another, their departments shared a building and the offices were all on the same floor, so the two of them had volunteered to be the ones who had to share.
“We have the mind stone and the tesseract at Stark Tower, and the time stone down on Bleecker,” Steve said as he turned on the commando that Tony loved so much. He really couldn’t wait to go back home and climb Steve like a tree. “The Hulk can make his way down there without anyone questioning why he’s fighting the Chitari, So, Bruce, the time stone is yours to get.”
“I’ll just ask Barnes, he’ll know,” at that Steve stopped, he hadn’t told Bucky about his little crush on Tony, hell he hadn’t told anyone, Buck thought that they were just becoming friends which was what he wanted him to think before be broached the subject of him asking Tony out. Though he was happy to be Tony’s friend, but he knew in his heart that he wanted something more than a friendship.
“It’s just a drink my friends,” Thor said but Bruce just shook his head at the comment.
“I’ll try,” she said before FRIDAY alerted them to something happening at the front gate. Natasha pulled up the feed from the front to show them that Scott and Hope were at the gate, Scott waving his hands around asking to be let in. “What could they want?”
He couldn’t help but laugh at the same words he had uttered to Sam the first time he had met the man. Just as the words had finished bright golden portals appeared around them, they had been a few just a moment ago and now he saw as Okoye, stepped through with the Black Panther next to her, Shuri smiling as she ran forward from another portal, which looked like it had come from somewhere in the buried compound. Shuri threw herself at her brother but got a knowing look from Okoye for leaving Wakanda without telling her. A moment later, Sam’s Falcon armor flys over them just as dozens of other portals appear around them.
“I see this as an absolute win!” Bruce said, and they all just looked at him with absolute horror.
“You don’t need to question it, I really like you Tony, not because of your family, or who the world thinks you are, but as the guy who wears sweaters that are too long.”
“Well the one we have at the factory powers the whole building, it’s basically clean energy, the only downside is that if it’s overloaded it can explode like a nuclear bomb and wipe out a good portion of the city, but for Iron Man or at least his backstory, the reactor is in his chest, not just the armor. It works like an electromagnet, and it’s used to keep pieces of shrapnel out of his heart.”
They sat out there for an hour, drinking tea, which was actually apple juice, and whatever Steve had baked the day before. The girls telling him stories, Riri telling him about one of her professors, usually Riri talked about her Iron Heart armor, but the professor had had a breakthrough and she just had to share. Kamala wondering how far the fabric on her superhero uniform would stretch, even though the thought of Kamala going out there and getting hurt scared him. Morgan telling him about her imaginary friend, which was just a small bot he had created for her that only comes out when she’s alone.
It was painful to roll the suit over, but thankfully his arms weren't hurt.  The suit was damned heavy though, and Tony made a slightly hysterical note to do more weight-lifting when he got home.  When the War was over.
Steve stepped back, shocked at the callousness.  He fought back the anger that threatened to take over.  Not the time to go off.  "Shellhead-"
"You're seeing this because you're Number Nine," Tony continued.  "That's right.  You've failed eight times.  Look around."
"I should have-"
"There's an army out there," a male voice said, strong and clear.  A commander if Tony had ever heard one.  "He's human.  You know what the last one did!"
"Let me do th-" Tony started.
"Video?" Steve asked, starting when a screen popped up in front of him.  That was out of the
"Yeah, that works," Tony said quietly.  Then he moved away from Steve, brushing the dirt off his hands and frowning slightly when he realized that wasn't going to work.
"Busy enough that you can hold a competition and place bets with Rhodes over who wins this dog fight?"
"I..."
"The ones above their buildings," she replied.  "They keep the monsters from the city.  If I had one of those at the temple...  That was why I came to you.  You've tamed the dragons, do you know where they are?"
.  His heart pounded in his ears as he closed his eyes, because falling back on childish tricks were about as good as he could come up with.  If he couldn't see the darkness, it couldn't hurt him, right?
.  Only an extremely large cavern that must span for miles.  "How-"
Wanda didn't answer.  She turned to the side, blowing out a small flame along the wall.  It caught on a ledge Tony hadn't seen, fire spreading around the cavern's parameter like wild fire with some unknown fuel that was too high for him to peer at.
* * *
He discarded several theories and resolved to get Rhodey's more expert opinion when basic needs became pressing.  This left him with an entirely different problem: How to wake a dragon.
And yes, he worried about how Tony never seemed to get much sleep, and he hated it when Steve said the wrong thing and left a sad expression on Tony's face.  Or worse, when he set Tony on the defensive.  But he hated when that happened with the others too.  He'd always
"He is," Steve said, punching Iron Man's shoulder lightly.  "Now, what are you catching me up on today?"
"We could check the temple," Tony insisted.  "She was there for a reason last time.  She could be-"
"Steve," Tony said, feeling raw and vulnerable in ways that scared him more than even the cold darkness had.  It was like Steve had seen into his soul then picked out pieces of it.  Tony didn't understand how Steve could see all that despite all of Tony's faults.  It was like the name was what Tony could be if he were actually-
"We'll stick to this plan then," Steve said as he held Tony close.  "We'll get out of here."
"They're not that bad," Steve said, continuing to cut the chicken regardless of Tony's protests. Some people liked chunky soup.  He'd seen it on the cans when he went to the supermarket.
Tony closed his eyes, taking a deep breath.  He remembered the sheer grief from Steve's nightmare and knew he couldn't go through that.  "I'm sorry, Steve," Tony whispered, not wanting Viper to hear it.  "I can't let them do it."
"I'd have gone anyway," Tony said.  "Did they..." he faltered, remembering
"No.  Just my mother and father and if they were 'married'?" Steve said as he pulled his head out of the building.  He made a small noise of frustration and a puff of smoke as he looked down at the nearest branch.  "That's not going to hold me."
"With knowing I spent over a century longing to see them," Steve replied, looking wistful.  "Do you still have the crystal?"
"Captain, what battle was fought here?" Thor demanded.  "Is it too late or can we yet join the fight?"
"Dr. Foster, what is he planning?" Steve asked, his voice hard.
"I'm... sorry," the blue dragon said, looking at Tony finally.  Then he launched himself into the sky in a way that must have hurt his shoulder where Tony had shot him.
It seemed like every time her mind would wander down those paths, there was a message from the Captain on her HUD or a picture of a kitten courtesy of Tony.  They were both ridiculous, but they did make her feel better.
"One day, I'll hear you finish a sentence," Cap teased gently.  "But I'm not what you expected, am I?"  There was a self-depreciating smile on his lips.  "I was never as interesting as the press liked to make out."
"Good luck," she said.  "You'll need it.  And for the record, I hope you succeed.  He needs more people who will give him a chance."
Tony immediately stopped moving.  "Cap?" he asked tentatively, failing to keep his teeth from chattering and ignoring the sharp pain in his head as he tried to force words out around the slur that snuck up on him.  "What's... What happened?"
Steve heard a faint mechanical noise.  He nearly turned to see what had happened when he froze, realizing the sound must have been the helmet coming up.
"Only when people try to kill you on a daily basis," Tony said, putting the gun back in its holster.  He took the holster off, folding it and setting it to the side, a little too unsettled by his nerves to wear it now.  "That's what they do, during wars."
"Alright.  Let's go get dinner for our fledgling Avenger," Tony said, tugging slightly but not pulling away.  Steve let go, because he was being ridiculous.  It had been months.  He should be better at this.
* * *
"I don't know either of those.  I think we use different scales?" Steve said, though Tony suspected that the dragon had at least a vague definition from the telepathy.  "They'll hum the tune.  Just follow the music."
"Thank you again, Mr. Stark," Viper said, her voice only just carrying over the pounding of his own heart.  "Hail Hydra."
"Go on," Steve said, walking them over to the door.  "I'll come get you when we're ready to leave."
"What?  Oh!" Pepper said, reaching up to grab the face plate.  It didn't come down.  "I'm still not used to all of this... JARVIS, could you-?"  The face plate slid down easily, and Steve was a little unnerved without the visual evidence that it was Pepper in the suit.  "Thank you, JARVIS.  Tony says it's easy when you're not thinking and it worked fine earlier, but now it's-"
"The plan to get out of this cave," Tony said, because that was obvious, wasn't it?  "Yinsen was bad at following plans too.  He...  I hate caves."
"Okay," she said, nodding once again before heading upstairs.
Steve hid his surprise and looked at the tree he'd picked out.  "Is the area unstable?" he asked.  He should have been informed of that.  And if that were the case, they needed to put up markings to warn people.
Tony missed the times when he could have just been searching for new things or new ways to cure his heart.  When it wasn't just about the War.  When he could be thinking of ways to use that light for energy in homes or hospitals, not to keep the troops safe.  The US had only been in the War for three years, but Tony had been fighting longer than that.  And he was just so
Worry started to gnaw at Steve as he bit off part of the protein bar.  "Different how?"
I've got your attention," Tony said, rolling his eyes.
Tony opened his eyes, looking up at Wanda.  Anger forced him to his feet despite how his head pounded.  "Why did you show me that?" he yelled.
"But what are we going to do with it?" Steve asked miserably, because he was standing on very thin ice with Stark and he needed Ms. Potts's continued approval.
"Sorry," Steve replied through the haze of pain.
"Yeah," Steve said, fear settling into a soft hope that Tony felt envelop him.  "After the War ends."
Tony's hand had ended up curled in Steve's shirt, and it tightened, pulling it taut.  "They know Iron Man.  They'd expect him when they see me."
Tony didn't look up.  He didn't have the strength to.  He could hear them pulling out a crystal as he started to shiver violently.  His thoughts were starting to get fuzzy so he shifted, a new wave of pain sending adrenaline through his system.  He couldn't afford to go into shock, not now.  But as the light faded and the noise stopped, Tony found himself alone in the cold.
When all was finished, Tony carefully ladled some of the soup into the bowl and Steve felt his fingers twitch.  He wasn't quite willing to go back down and try drawing again.  He could always go with Tony to check on Natasha and see how she was holding up.
"I can't just leave you here with-"
He was mostly finished, just adding some shading to Tony's chest, when the man in question started to stir.  Tony reached out to the other side of the bed as he rolled over, then shivered as he blinked wearily.  "Steve?" he asked, rubbing his eyes.
He didn't say they didn't know if the serum would keep Steve alive this time, or if it only worked last time because it happened so fast.  This was Steve, and Steve was the single most obstinate person Tony knew, including his own self.  Steve would survive, no problem.
"Shut it, Stark," Steve growled.  "You know it doesn't."
Steve looked, even if Tony wouldn't.  Jane and Bruce crowded him, almost shoving Steve aside.  "Tony!  You're..."  Bruce said, then shook his head.  "Of course you are."
Steve nodded again, pressing his eyes shut against the pin-pricking sensation.  Tony didn't need to deal with Steve's nightmares.  Steve just had to get himself under control.  Again.
"Good job, princess," Tony said to Kestrel, turning away from his husband for the moment.
"I've never been a soldier, Peggy.  At least, never one that was any damn good," Tony said, feeling the weariness set over his shoulders like the world on Atlas's shoulders.
"Steady," Steve said, smelling the problem.  "I'll get it."
Natasha took his hand and squeezed it, and Steve looked down.  "But we'll only be walking into the trap if we don't do anything.  If we go to Latveria, we might be able to find out."
"Yes, Captain?"
"We can't start a search to find out how to help him if we don't know what happened," Fury said reasonably.
," a firm and familiar voice said above him.  Very close, in fact.  Too close for comfort (but not close enough), and Tony realized he was being held by a pair of strong arms rather than being pinned down with something on top of him.  "Calm down," Steve said after a hiss of pain.
"I hate magic," Tony said, rubbing his temples.  He didn't need a worse headache because magic was turning up again.  He wondered if he could get away with telling Pepper that Viper had bewitched him though.  That sounded much better than admitting his own gullibility with a pretty face.
As Steve cleared everything away on the tray, he was already forgotten by Tony who was muttering and toying with holograms as he finished the last of his sandwich.  He looked a little goofy like that, gracefully changing the projections with one hand and stuffing his mouth with the other, only pausing to call out orders to JARVIS.  Steve smiled, wondering how many people got to see Tony like this, lost in equations and his own brilliant inventions.  Tony's brown eyes flickered over the numbers and the light reflected back in them, making them almost glow.  It made Steve's fingers twitch for his art pad, though he doubted he could recreate the colors even on a tablet.  He felt a fondness that...
"Why did you hide it?" Peggy asked sorrowfully.  "We could have helped you with the stone and found out that she was lying.  Didn't you trust us?"
Tony tensed in her arms as she tightened them around him, and she closed her eyes when his breath hitched, a small smile on her face.
Steve groaned.  He'd hoped he'd side-stepped that.  "I don't need to-"
"Yeah," Steve said, going through the same memories.  "She's alive.  Sharon might not be for much longer though, if she keeps trying to sneak out into the battle with us.  Peggy'll kill her herself if she keeps that up.  She's only twelve and she wants to go to war.  She sounds American, by the way.  They moved to the States when she was young."
Steve was a bit shy sometimes, but it was surprisingly easier to talk to people online. It was nice to meet people without Captain America hanging over his head. It'd been a long time since he'd been plain old Steve Rogers, and that was more of a relief than he'd have thought.
Susan rubbed her eyes fiercely and stood up.  She should go to Kes now and-
"And I'm saying I need it now," Fury said, moving further into the room. He gestured to Tony's arc reactor in a way that raised Steve's hackles, though he couldn't pinpoint why.  "Because that?  I need to know about it."
"Stow that talk, Avenger," Steve said gently.  "You can't let the last mission get you down.  Being in top shape means staying positive."
"He's real," Rhodey said, dashing Tony's hopes that the Avengers wouldn't mention that sort of thing.
"Steve, I-"
"And I repaid you by being a terrible friend," Tony said.
use that machine, Tony.  At least wait until I'm back.  Whatever it is can wait until then."
If that didn't set off warning bells, Tony never knew his husband at all.
* * *
"That does sound like a start," Jan said, sketching absently as she spoke.
Tony didn't try to pull his hand away, which Steve took as a good sign.  Steve wondered for a moment if this was a good idea before deciding there was no reason not to.  If he had time to think, he might over-analyze.  "Stay a little longer?  I'd like to talk to you."
Tony froze.  That was Steve's voice.  But Steve was dead.  Steve had died on the operating table while the fight had still been raging on.  The only reason Tony knew was because he'd been keeping tabs on the monitors when it happened.  The doctors had been failing to revive Steve for at least ten minutes before Tony was taken down.  The last thing he'd heard was the head doctor throwing in the towel.  Steve was dead.
Steve looked away, toweling off the sweat as he tried not to think about Iron Man.  He caught Natasha's frown as he looked down and groaned inwardly.  She was prone to getting far too involved in his personal affairs, and no one needed to know he was failing at adapting to the new world he'd woken up in that much.  Maybe he should just admit Iron Man turned him down.  She might find out in a much more embarrassing manner otherwise.
tell you to say that."
Steve sighed, closing his eyes.  "How many people know?" he asked, reminding himself not to feel bitter or jealous.
He looked down at his phone for a moment then ignored it.  Tony stared, then snorted.  "Don't let me keep you from your messages.  Could be a secret admirer, and you don't want to disappoint them," he said teasingly.
"Clint needed to work on his timing," Steve said.
" Steve promised.
Steve groaned inwardly as he caught his shield and sliced it through another robot.  He wasn't going to live that one down any time soon.
"What was that about the media calling you a man-child?" Rhodey said.  "You think-"
All thought shut down as Steve pulled him forward for a kiss.  Steve's lips were soft against Tony's chapped ones, pressing firmly and demanding attention.  And Tony gave it to him, because even if Steve
"That's where Iron Man is," she replied, planting her feet more firmly.  "He's eating."
"Why do you come back?" Tony asked.  "I keep getting people hurt, Rhodey.  That's why you left the first time.  Why come back?"
"He's
Steve could see him gearing up to go on the offensive, so he hastened to explain.  "Someone once told me that after... after Bucky died.  She said it wasn't my fault, because Bucky chose to follow me, and he'd have gone even knowing what would happen.  I'm willing to bet Rhodes was the same.  Anyone you trust with those suits would have to be a hell of a person.  Someone you thought deserved to pilot one.  But he made that choice to put it on."
.  He didn't know how long it was before there was a hand running through his hair.  A human hand, not a metal one.
.  At least he hadn't been discovered, but he could feel his own anger building.  "Is that what you think I'm here for?"
," Steve said, his voice coming from far away.
Steve stood up and stretched, offering a hand to Iron Man.  Iron Man laughed and took it, but even the armor's weight was no match for the serum's strength.
"It's fine," Steve said, though now that he was listening, Tony could hear a new level of pain in Steve's voice.  Tony had struggled while he'd been in the panic attack and he'd...  "You didn't even jar it too much."  Steve's voice cut through the guilt, but it didn't lighten it.
It was, thankfully, fairly normal for Tony to question Steve about parts of dragon culture or engineering.  Steve didn't suspect a thing.  "There's a cavern to the east, Steve said, and Tony tried to see in the little remaining light as he looked over his shoulder.  "It's not too far from the gate.  A very short flight," Steve said helpfully.  "We don't go there often unless we need a replacement or a new one.  It's cold in that cave."
"Right then.  It works.  I'll just-" Tony said, waving his fingers. "-go now.  Bye."
The rest of Steve's city defenders were waiting for them as they emerged, and Tony saw with growing worry how the ceiling was shedding small rocks and crystals.  If that collapsed, what would happen to the upper world?  "That's not a good sign," he muttered to himself.
.  He hadn't really thought of that.  He'd probably have to reseal the crevasse to make sure Hydra would never find it.  But to never see the dragons again after a dance like that...  Tony looked down at the crystal he'd stolen, turning it in his hand.  He hadn't felt this alive in years.  "I'll have to," Tony said, swallowing back the longing.  "The War..."
"Tony!"
"Tony," Pepper said.  "Dragons aren't real."
At first Steve wasn't entirely sure Stark would take his hand.  The look he gave Ms. Potts spoke volumes about what he agreed to, but Steve kept his disappointment internal as Stark smiled and shook his hand.  It was a very sharp and unfriendly smile, but Steve would take what he could get.
"The magic reveals itself to those who it will," Wanda interrupted, her voice as hard as the rocks around them, though not unkind.  "Would you normally lose interest in murals of our history, like the ones beyond the gate?"
The future.  It was funny when he considered how far he'd come, yet how far he still had yet to fall.  There was nothing...
And the apology helped if Steve were being honest.  As long as Tony stopped when Steve told him to, they might be able to work with this.  It warmed something inside of Steve too when Tony used his given name, and he smiled at him.
Tony nodded.  Or tried to, given the shaking and dry heaving, but Clint got the point.  "I'm gonna get the doctor now.  They wanted to let you come around naturally, but now you're awake they might give you something to help with all of this."
"Mm," Steve said, his hands wandering until he found Tony's ass.
* * *
Why wasn't the cooling system working?  Tony resisted the urge to punch the wall.  He couldn't get the repulsors to work, the arc reactor was shit, and now the cooling system wasn't working with him.  And wasn't there some sort of problem with ice?
He took another drink  and coughed, pulling his legs tighter to his chest as he kept the bottle away from a surprised Stark.  Stark didn't need to be drinking any more of it, and Steve decided it wasn't so bad on the second try.  "You shouldn't have gotten involved if you don't have a gun," Steve said.
"I believe you should take that, Captain," the AI said, a hint of ice in his tone.  "And I would not recommend following through on the threat you were about to make."
"Pull back," Steve ordered, catching his shield and driving it into the chest of the nearest robot.  "Keep an escape route open for me in case things get too hot, but I won't let them have the warehouse."
With that, Tony left the room.  "That's not suspicious at all," Steve muttered before bidding the nurse good-bye and rushing to catch up with him.
Tony froze for a nanosecond, then jumped into action.  Susan and Kes were tinkering with the armor and Leon and Steve were occupied.  "Little Bear, suit up," he said over the coms.  Then he cursed as a small army came into view of the radar.  They were trying to blast down the door.
"At least dragons have better taste in snacks, apparently," Tony said.
"Tony, please," Steve continued, very familiar blue eyes looking a cross between anguished and panicked.  "Tell me you remember the dragons.  Everyone thinks I'm insane after the ice and I had to break out to get here.  No one believes me, not even Sam or Peggy!"
That made something unfurl in Tony's chest and the need to show off became to much too resist.  "Sure," Tony said, deciding not to care about the fuel.  He could make sure only to use a little.  Or just cross that bridge if he didn't have enough when he got there.  "Head up to the ledge up there and I'll show you."
Tony glared at him, letting the dragon know exactly how he felt about that sort of prodding.  "No, I mean that," Steve said.  "Not just saying it to make you go.  Though you should."
Actually, no.  This was an all-new level of hell.
They were working on things in their own way, and there were always snags, but Steve counted himself the luckiest hologram alive as he kissed Tony's temple, rubbing soothing circles into his back.  They could only watch from afar right now, but Steve was confident the kids would be okay.
Tony shook his head, pulling away reluctantly.  "We've already changed the vision," Tony said.  He pointed to the small crystal he'd taken during their dance.  It was hooked around one of the cooling flaps with a small rope from his kit.  He'd made the hole himself this morning as it charged.  "It'll be different."
"Steve," he said, his voice sounding weak and trembling.  Red, white, and blue.  Art and stars that the dragons only knew from myths and legends.  The feeling of calm after the rain and the stubborn of a rock that refused to move.
The big, white room was about as home as he could get. He couldn't count the number of times he had fallen asleep on the little red couch, and the familiar tools and half-finished projects greeted him like old friends.  A few things had been moved around, but he put that down to Jarvis ordering a cleaning behind his back.
"We both know that won't work," Steve said.
"You-"
"Just because I can't hack Stark doesn't mean I can't get into other systems," Natasha replied.  "And I've already got a ping system set up for SI dealings at the airport."
"And that's different from now, how?"
Sharon's wing pulled back so that he could see Sam on his back with Steve lying triumphantly on his stomach.  Both of their nostrils were flared in the dragon smile, and now Tony could read a playfulness to their posture that the aerial flight hadn't allowed.
He also couldn't force the words out that would make Steve leave.
Steve decided on the latter when Doom started to walk towards the bed, because they were far too vulnerable to trust a super-villain right now.  Doom stopped as Steve planted his feet, keeping himself between Doom and the bed, his chin stubbornly set even if it meant taking his eyes from Tony.
"There's nothing to apologize for," Cap said.  "And you can call me Steve."
"If you two boys are finished, we can have lunch while you patch up so the human can stop fretting," Peggy said as she started to set out the basket she had brought with her.
“I hate when you call my dick that,” Steve said but even Tony knew that it was a lie because he could feel the hardness of it at the moment and it was getting a little hard to concentrate on the task at hand and not jump on top of mini Cap.
“You have no right,” the man tried to say, and of course just when he yanked his arm away from Natasha the guy’s elbow slammed right into Tony’s face, hitting him right in the nose. “What the fuck,” the guy yelled out, right as Steve’s familiar face came into view.
“James Barnes, the guy you’re dating, he’s my roommate,” Tony said, and Natasha’s wide eyes were all it took for him to know that she hadn’t realized this. She was good at finding out thing before Tony did, so the fact that she had been half flirting with his roommate for weeks and he’s known it before her was a feat that he was willing to be proud of. Jan had this look on her face like she had blocked out that Tony had a roommate at all, and then remembered that conversation that they had had so long ago about Steve.
His robot project, Butterfinger’s brother was coming along the only problem was that the AI program wasn’t working properly just yet, he was having an interfacing problem and wasn’t one hundred percent sure of how to solve it. Mainly because the time he would have spent working on it, he had been helping Steve or hanging out in the library with Ty. Though he couldn’t fault them for that, mainly because it was nice not having to actually live up to being a Stark and just being a regular person. Maybe he could use the long weekend to work on it since he was going to be alone for the first time.
“Tony,” Jan said giving him the most serious look. “When have we ever done anything that would give you any kind of break.”
“I left mine at home, mom is so strict about that rule that I hadn’t bothered to bring it at all,” she told him, she looked so calm, if it weren’t for the way she was gnawing on lip, he would think that everything was fine.
Steve looked down at where Tony’s body had been, a question on his lips that had been there since after that first fight with one of Thanos’ minions, “Why did you forgive me so easily?”
“Steve,” he heard a familiar voice call out, as his older brother walked forward towards him and his brothers, his mother was already in the delivery room and his father had to have stitches after one particularly bad contraction from his mother had sent him flying. Luckily the doctor had allowed the stitches to be put on while in the room with his mother after his father wouldn’t let go of her hand. Steve was sure that she might have broken that too, but he wasn’t going to ask.
“Our history, so there’s not a lot of convenient spots to just drop in,” Tony said as he started pulling up dates and locations from each encounter.
“He was just a kid, but at the time I thought that it was just going to be a friendly conversation,” he actually didn’t want to be reminded of that time, he wanted to get over the whole thing already. “It didn’t happen that way, but now after all of this, it seems so stupid.”
“Yeah but your Nan ran it for a long time, so for all you know they’ve been here before,” she countered and it made him think if it were possible, but that couldn’t have been right, he had worked at the store every summer since he was fourteen, and not once had he seen anyone remotely famous come inside.
“My little Morguna,” Tony picked up the little girl and held her closer to them as they watched Miles and Kamala drive away to school. “Yeah they’ll be back.”
“Ready.... and kill it!” Bruce said, Hope pulling the lever to shut down the power just as Scott reappeared as he was when they had started.
That was a hit that Tony wasn’t ready to take, though his professor had told him that he could make up the work by giving him a more than stellar story for his final, Tony wasn’t too sure about it. He hadn’t started writing his final story, he’d tried several times, but for some reason he couldn’t get the words on paper and it was irritating him. This was something he hadn’t seen coming at all, even though he should have known to never get too attached to things. He didn’t have that luxury, he was a Stark, why should he have nice things or even dream of a life outside of what his father had planned for him.
“And what do you have planned for us now that you have me all tied up with no where to go?” Steve asked before pushing his pelvis up to meet Tony’s ass, and my god he wasn’t going to survive being in control tonight, because even tied up Steve had all the power over him.
“Don’t think about it too much,” Steve told him as they set themselves up in the conference room, they were going to brainstorm until the kids arrived for dinner.
“Model rendered,” she said as she finished, Tony wasn’t sure about anything but he was amazed as the model completed itself. It was the best he could do, which was a lot, and he knew he should have Shuri and Bruce look it over, but he knew that it was perfect.
“It’s just a grilled cheese sandwich Morgan,” he said to her while she still had her hand up, holding him hostage.
“Got it Tin Man,” Hulk said smiling.
“My grandmother is friends with Tony Stark... how did I not know this, I worked here every summer in high school.”
“Shit,” Steve said looking at him.
“I still don’t understand why you won’t move into the house with us?” Steve said as they drove towards the school.
“We got word that there may be an attempt to steal it,” Steve said to the elevator of Hydra Agents.
“Peter’s Aunt?”
“Tony,” was all Steve said which only made him laugh.
“Chocolate,” she said her hand in her mouth, she still hadn’t outgrown sticking her fingers in her mouth, but they weren’t going to stop her. “Iron Man.”
“Oh really? Well thank Thor I’m here. Regardless, I fixed it,” he said holding up his right hand, the device had been ready when he had gotten back to the house, so he knew all he needed was a couple of things, including his suit which was now nestled in its little device. “It’s a fully functioning Time-Space GPS. FRIDAY hadn’t had it ready when we left this morning, plus I needed to go back to the house for somethings.”
“Don’t be like that Tony,” Ty called out, and he probably would have stopped Tony if he could, but Ty was technically at work and he couldn’t leave the library, which made running off all the better. He felt so stupid, he was a smart kid, his family told him this, but apparently when it came to reading people he was the dumbest person in the world.
“You know I'd offer to cook you dinner but you seem pretty miserable already,” he says to her as he slumps over on the bookshelf finally letting her know that he was there.
“If I had to guess, we messed with time, and it decided to mess with us,” he said as he started checking Steve for injuries. “As for the kids, I haven’t heard anything yet, FRIDAY is working on getting in contact with everyone.”
“Damn it,” he said, knowing just how many of his former students were going to intern for the rest of the semester.
“Not really, he wasn’t at any of the meetings, which was strange, I’m not sure where he is.”
“You hang out around me too much, because you’re starting to sound like a smart person... I don’t like that, go be the artist you are, because if you become rational then I’ll have to actually eat my vegetables and be responsible, and I don’t want that.”
“Yeah, that makes sense you moron,” Rocket said as he walked over the table and started messing with the screens.
“Arnim, you in there?” he heard a very familiar voice say, “Arnim?
It was move in day at the college, Tony had applied to a million schools, even some Ivy League schools, but in the end settled for going to the same college as his sister. His older brothers had all gone to big fancy schools, and even though he was a genius, his mother had always told him to make sure and live his life too. She had given him his love of writing and playing music, though he preferred writing over going to concerts. So, when he had started applying for colleges, he had decided to have writing as one of his majors, his brother Clint had told him that he was crazy, but Tony was smart and wouldn’t have problems keeping up.
“Wha-what?” Thor said
“Because one time when we were kids, Clint poured a bottle of water on him while he was sleeping and the next day he woke up without eyebrows,” Natasha said walking into the room, Tony couldn’t help but smile at the memory, it had been the best revenge, except he had to change the lock on his door and reinforce it for a whole week before their mother put a stop to the war. “I think he had been what eight when that happened?”
“Do I want to know why you broke into my room?” Tony asked putting his bag on his bed before going to his desk to turn on his computer. He needed to finish the chapter he had been writing before dinner, or else Nat was going to show up and force him to be human, which he was trying to avoid, and if he was in the robotics lab then he would be free, mainly because it was the one place where she wasn’t allowed and couldn’t follow him.
“That it does,” he said as Steve lifted up Tony’s ass and lined himself up before pushing his way back into Tony’s twitching hole.
“Things like favorite movies and favorite colors and all of that?”
“Nothing much, just wanted to apologize to him again,” Steve said hoping to sound all calm and casual about it. “We got off on the wrong foot, so I thought I’d try to be nicer to him, plus I feel bad about the whole Captain America thing.”
Tony was out of the hospital bed within an hour of Steve leaving, he was still in a wheelchair, but he didn’t want to lay around while the people he cared for risked their lives to find Thanos. Pepper yelled at him for another twenty minutes before walking off towards his room and laying down, Happy had passed out on the bed already. Everyone he knew had lost so much and they still fought to be where they were, so he needed to work to fix things as much as he could as well.
“I... um... I don’t want to forget,” Steve continued when Tony hadn’t relaxed. “I think this is going really fast, but the last few months have made me happier than I ever been, and I just wanted to let you know.”
“Why don’t you ask all of the Asgardians how much my help was worth, the ones that are left, anyway, because honestly I don’t think my help was worth much,” Thor looked close to tears, and they all saw that he was trying to pull away, but Bruce held firm.
Jumping out of his car, just because he was excited, he walked up to the dorm, not really sure if Tony would be there, or Bucky for that matter, he had literally just drove there without knowing if anyone was home. He walked up the steps to the dorm, hoping that someone would be there only to see Tony trying, and failing to open his door.
He was going to drop them off with Pepper and Happy, she was going to keep them at her house until they were finished, but Tony wasn’t sure if he would be able to say goodbye to them knowing that he might never see them again. They were his kids, in this universe, in any universe, Steve thought so as well, they were a family, and he knew that a parent would sacrifice anything for their children, and that’s what he was going to do.
In that moment Steve cried as well, they had been friends once upon a time, even with everything that had happened, he still wished for more, but he didn’t want to push the boundaries on their fragile bond. “This time,” he said whispering into Tony’s ear, “When I say together, I mean we’re in this together, even if we fix everything, I won’t leave your side, I promise.”
“Oh, wow are those flowers for me,” Steve’s mother said, and all Tony could really do was nod at the very pregnant woman. “You shouldn’t have, but they’ve very lovely, if only my husband could take a cue from you and get me something nice every once and a while.”
The moment Rhodey said Carol, Tony couldn’t help but stare at the blonde walking towards them, her hair a little flat after taking off the helmet or at least he thought it was a helmet he wasn’t entirely sure, she had a scowl on her face her eyes looking everywhere as if in search of someone. Tony remembered his best friend’s once crush on a woman named Carol, he remembered seeing her during a visit to the base, before she all but vanished from their lives. Tony had only met her once or twice, he couldn’t remember for certain, those years were a little hazy and there were too many regrets there, but he also remembered that Rhodey had pinned for the woman but never did anything about his feelings, it mostly had to do with another woman at the time. He remembered that it was one of a few times in their friendship where his best friend had gotten shitfaced drunk about the relationship he couldn’t have.
He was still wearing the jeans he had on the night before, so he slipped his feet into a pair of chucks and walked out the door, Bucky waiting on the other side for him. They walked to the dining hall in silence, hell this was the first time that Tony had seen the place so empty. He grabbed the largest cup they had and filled it with coffee, before filling a plate with some food. He needed something to make it seem like he was alright, and not freaking out about the fact that he ruined one friendship while falling in love.
“Alright, Clint, we’re going in 3... 2... 1!” Bruce said as Clint vanished in front of them.
“Not your inventions, or your stories?”
Steve let out a laugh as Tony took the shield and propped it up for Steve’s arm. “Thank you, Tony,” Steve said as he slid his hand into the straps. “For everything, for the life we have, the kids, giving me a home.”
“You’re so tight Tony,” Steve said before he grunted, and Tony could feel Steve spilling inside of him. It wasn’t a little bit either, because apparently not having sex in nearly a month meant that Steve had been holding onto his urges until they fucked each other’s brains out. Tony didn’t hear anything else, his mind blanked out for the second time that night, hell he hadn’t felt Steve slip the plug into his ass either.
“I went in the ice in ‘45 right after I met the woman, I thought was the love of my life. Woke up 70 years later. It took a long time for me to move on from that from losing everything that I knew,” Steve couldn’t help but look at Miles, his son, the boy who had grown up in front of him and made both of his parents proud. “I found love again, I found a family again, even after all of this. You got to move on. Got to move on. The world is in our hands. It’s left to us guys, and we have to do something with it. Otherwise... Thanos should have killed us all.”
“I was going to ask about that,” Steve interrupted him once again, and Tony knew that the questions about Iron Man’s origins was something that he had never discussed in any of his stories, only the after effects of everything that had happened. “Why do some of the pictures of Iron Man have a glowing light at the center.”
“You won’t be there for long, for us it’ll be seconds, for you probably a few minutes,” Bruce explained as he started adjusting the console, Shuri standing next to him, while Scott gave Clint a thumbs up. “Don’t change anything, you’re only going to be there to observe, may grab something to see if you can bring it back with you.”
“Never mind, it’s nothing, I thought it was just a rumor nothing more,” he said before turning towards the stairs and taking them up two at a time. Hearing Sam yell at him as he rushed off, not wanting to get trapped in the conversation any longer. He wondered if Bucky knew that his girl was a Stark, but he had too, unless he had been too enamored over her to actually ask the question about who she was.
“I don’t think that we’d lose anything Tony,” Steve said to him. “We’ve already gained so much, maybe we’d just get something even better.”
“Is it really you,” she said and he nodded just as she rushed across the room and put her arms around him. Steve could only keep his eyes on Tony, and the sadness he saw was more painful than anything he could have imagined. “But how?”
“Yeah, actually it’s Anthony, so if you could suggest that name to your friend, maybe his wife won’t name him something weird,” Tony said and Peggy smiled at him.
When he finished cleaning up, he dressed quickly and walked towards the med bay, seeing Tony through the glass window on a hospital bed. The Hulk must have done a number on him, and Steve felt guilty for insinuating that Tony had asked for it. He stood at the door, not really sure if he was welcomed in the room, but he was fine with that, he needed to gain the man’s trust once again, he needed to move forward. It was just one step at a time. He needed to see Tony for who he was, to listen without reacting, to just be there for the other man.
“You don’t know stubborn,” Steve said looking at Thanos, his face covered in dirt and grime. “You haven’t seen stubborn.”
“That wasn’t supposed to happen, was it?” Scott said and Tony wanted to slam his head against the marble tiling on the ground.
“Did Fury leave anything behind,” Steve asked looking over at the continuing images of everyone they had lost just weeks before.
Tony wondered about how he saw Steve, and the first image was of Steve just smiling at him, his eyes so blue it almost looked like the sky on a clear day, even though the sky didn’t really have color, but this wasn’t about science. He thought about how excited Steve was whenever he made a new coffee flavor for him, mainly because Steve was a kind person, but also because Tony was sure that Steve hid things in the coffee. How Steve’s first instinct was to keep Tony safe even when he didn’t know Tony at all, or how he always knew to be there waiting for Tony when the library closed even though it was out of his way.
“Good luck on your project, doctor,” Steve answered with a wink that the woman hadn’t seen.
“Steve,” he started just wanting everything to end, he just wanted to disappear and vanish from his own life.
“Good to know,” she said before pushing a button in the revealing a secret tunnel. The two of them looked over at her shocked at what they were seeing. “What, do you think that I would trust anyone here when they brought in Zola and had him work for us. I don’t trust that rodent to save my life.”
“Mom’s in labor,” Steve said, and Bucky just nodded before jumping in the backseat. “Can you call Bruce, I know he’s in the city, his boyfriend lives in Manhattan, so he can make it in time, and Peter call Hank and tell him where we’re off too.”
“Then stop making fun of me,” he countered. Rhodey had enough material against Tony from being friends for so long, but Tony had just enough ammunition to get back at him a few times.
“What, what do you mean, they fought that whole year,” Steve said knowing that while Buck was bi, Sam was as straight as an arrow. “They fought because of me, Sam was pissed at Bucky because of what had happened, not because he liked him that way.”
He listened to Tony’s breathing even out before falling asleep himself, his thoughts never straying from the genius in his arms. His dreams filled with Tony’s world, the one where the Avengers fought together, maybe one where Bucky and Tony’s sister Natasha were also a couple. Iron Man and Captain America fighting side by side, saving the world.
They looked at each other, and Tony knew that of all the things that could have happened this was not what they were expecting. “What did Carol say to you before we finished with the glove?” Tony asked trying to piece everything together.
“Let’s not forget that you told me you liked me weeks before I even kissed you.”
Honestly though, he was mostly excited about seeing Tony again, after their talk before the break Steve started drawing Iron Man and Captain America, he had a notebook filled with drawings. He had even taken his father’s design for Captain America and updated it to better fit in with Iron Man. Even though he hadn’t read any of Tony’s stories he tried his best with the drawings, he wanted to show them to him because for the first time since he was little, he was excited about those comics.
“Nothing, just that I may not have read Steve right, or maybe Steve hadn’t known my intentions, I don’t know,” why was he telling Bruce this, like he was some high school kid or something. “I have to go to S.I. but I’ll go with you to the bookstore later.”
“He was the first sentient thing that I invented,” he said as he wheeled himself over to where she sat. “He’s like a small child most of the time, and I scream in frustration constantly, but there’s nothing I wouldn’t do for him, or U, or even my A.I.”
“As you wish,” Steve said, but he didn’t let go of Tony’s dick, instead he kissed him hard on the mouth, slipping his tongue in and slowly playing with Tony’s tongue as he slowly rubbed circles on Tony’s cock. All Tony could do was moan into the kiss and adjust his hips to make it easier for Steve to plow into him.
“Wait, wait, wait, Thor, just wait. We haven't decided who's gonna put that on yet,” Steve said pulling Thor away from the glove, they needed to make this decision with all of their heads on right, and Tony knew that anyone of them could lose an arm because of it.
Tony was alive, the kids were alive, and they were all fighting, this was no time to give up, even though he could feel his hands shaking, even though his body felt like Morgan’s favorite pudding, he needed to keep trying. Digging the shield to the ground he stood up, taking the leather strap of the shield and tightening it, it reminded him of the first shield he had back in his USO days.
“Steve,” his father called out just as he was putting on his coat, a stack of papers in his hand and a smile on his face. “I’ve read through all of these, and I looked at the concept art you’ve drawn.”
Tell me what you think about this so far, because honestly I don't know where I'm going with this.
Before anyone could say anything else, Bucky kicked the door in, and the conversation turned into Tony introducing his best friend to Steve’s best friend. Leaving Steve alone with his thoughts, mainly about Tony saying anything about him. He was sure that they were becoming friends, but he wasn’t trying to push those boundaries and try anything further. He was pulled out of his thoughts when someone else walked into the room, and all of a sudden, the place felt too packed in. Steve saw Bucky light up as his girlfriend walked towards him, and Tony went and pushed Bucky out of the way just so that he could hug his sister.
“I’m not good with the outdoors,” Tony said but he knew that with Steve no matter where they went it would have been perfect, it was silly things, like the dates that Bucky had told him about, they were the kind of things that he would love to do with Steve.
“What,” Steve looked at him, Tony could see the surprised look on Steve’s face. “Did the comics inspire you?”
“Don’t go,” he called out, stopping the other man from leaving before they even said something remotely normal to one another. “Sorry, it’s just that, well you’ve given us all of this free publicity,” that was a stupid thing to say. “And I just want to thank you for it,” because honestly, he thought the whole thing was a joke. “So, if you don’t mind, do you want to have some coffee,” as if he didn’t get the stuff for free. He really couldn’t keep up with the internal monologue in his own head.
They picked up Sam and drove off, Sam talking about a girl he had met over the summer who was also a student at the school, though he wasn’t sure if the girl liked him back, though Sam like Bucky also looked at relationships differently than Steve had, mainly because Sam had been trying to get over someone who he had never dated, Sam had pinned and then tried to get over it, even though Bucky spent a lot of time annoying him about not doing anything about the crush. So, now Bucky was ignoring Sam’s attempt at a new relationship, mainly because he liked acting like a little shit, but it didn’t matter because in the end Bucky had told him to get his shit together and ask her out.
Somewhere during the walk from the shuttle stop to Steve’s place, Tony had noticed that Natasha and Jan had both joined them, his mind muddled in the million things he needed to talk to Steve about, on top of everything that he had to finish for the end of the semester. Tony saw the smile on his sister’s face, he knew she was happy, but in his mind, he wondered if he could have the same thing that she did. If it were possible for him to be able to have something that was separate of his family obligations.
“We’re getting to know each other,” Bucky said sounding embarrassed about the whole thing.
“We have to try something,” Shuri said to them, hope in her voice. She had grown up too much too fast in the last five years. “I want my family back, I want my people to have not suffered the loss of two kings so close together.”
“I bet, and thanks for the present,” Steve’s eyes landed on the foot of the bed where the vibrator was now sitting. “It was nice of you to think of me.”
“Doreen?” Tony asked and Peter’s smile grew.
Scott held up the vial that had been strapped onto the suit, “These are Pym Particles, alright? And ever since Hank Pym got snapped out of existence, this is it. This is what we have. We’re not making any more.”
“The one in the living room, the one that was right above the fireplace.”
“That’s not how it works,” Nebula said, her voice echoing around the room.
“No one should,” Tony said to her before smiling.
“Hey,” Tony said with a smile, though it was not as big as the one he had given Steve and he knew this. He saw the library cart that Ty had, though filled with books, Tony doubted that the guy had actually done any work before spotting him at the table.
If there was one thing that Tony was never sure about, well it was his brain to mouth filter, because according to Pepper he didn’t have one and had the tendency to tell the world everything. Well not to everyone, just his friends, and apparently now his childhood crush because he really couldn’t stop himself.
“We need a team,” Steve said, and Tony knew that he was going into full Captain America mode and ignoring what had just happened. “We need to go after him and get the stones, and from there we can work out what to do with him after we’ve brought everyone back.”
“Yeah,” Steve answered looking at the too young Queen. “Us.”
It didn’t matter, it was Bucky’s life and Steve was going to let his friend live it, if in the end he realizes that he’s dating his roommates’ sister and Tony doesn’t kill him, then Bucky would have survived the worse. Or at least he hoped that was the worst that could happen, though he remembered that Tony had a few older brothers so who knew what Bucky would have to face in the future. There was also the fact that if Bucky could date Tony’s sister, then it was possible for Steve to be able to date Tony, which just made his night even better.
When they were back in Tony’s dorm, snuggled into the bed, Bucky and Natasha were out and Steve couldn’t be more thankful about it, they just sat there in each other’s arms. Tony snuggling right into his chest, Steve could feel his warm breath against his shirt making him sigh in happiness. He was sure that Tony had fallen asleep in his arms, the stress of the day falling away and leaving him happy, which Steve thought was the best kind of relief after being knocked down.
“He’s kidding,” Hope said as she stood next to Bruce helping him with the machine. “You can’t say things like that!” she told Bruce, Steve’s super soldier hearing picking it up, which only made him want to laugh.
“There’s food in the fridge and delivery coming, so you’re not going to move from that desk until you’ve signed off on everything important,” she said to him staring him down with that look that he feared would cause her to one day become an evil villain.
“Listen, I’m not going anywhere near what ever freaky things you’re planning on doing, I just came up here to see why James went downstairs grumbling about.”
“That’s okay, as long as it’s just you and me and the stars in the sky nothing else matters, this is what I wanted to tell you the other night before everything went to shit.”
“It was as funny as that day we were playing cards against humanity and you got that Hitler question,” Tony said laughing even harder. “You.... you wouldn’t even look at me, or the kids.”
They stayed there in each other’s arms for another few minutes before venturing back towards the communal area, where Nebula and Bruce talked in hushed words, while looking over at Thor, who had let his own regrets manifest in other ways. Depression was something that all the Avengers were familiar with, they all dealt with it in their own ways, but for Thor, who had lost so much even before the snap, it had gotten to him even more.
“I gotta tell you Nat, he’s way into you,” Jan said as they sat down at one of the tables in the local Starbucks. They had gotten tired of being on campus for lunch, and so Jan drove them into town for some coffee instead. It was nice to get out of the dorm and not hide away like he normally did, even if he had to listen to their girl talk.
“One hour, freshen up, get settled, we have work to do,” Steve said before pulling Tony towards Tony’s old workshop. He hadn’t used it in years, since he mostly worked from home, but it was familiar to the both of them. Steve could tell that what had happened had bothered Tony, mainly because of his strained relationship with Howard, something that still urks him, because he would have thought that the father and son would have been like Tony was with Riri when it came to creating tech, but it hadn’t happened that way.
“Really Sarah, I’ve gotten you flowers before, and you know how much I love you,” Steve’s father said in his own defense. “See this is what happens when you bring people to this house, I get all the evil stares about how I don’t pamper my wife enough.”
“Mom,” he called out only to see her head pop out of the den, a smile on her face as she walked out with her hand on her belly, his father not far behind. Steve knew it was because he was worried, but his mother would always do what she wanted as long as her boys were all taken care of.
“Heya Pops,” Miles said smiling from the table. “I hope the coffee came out right cause I’m never sure if I put enough in the pot.”
“Lightning won't help you, love. It's gotta be me,” Bruce said before shaking his head. “Actually, it has to be Hulk, you saw what those stones did to Thanos. It almost killed him. None of you could survive.”
“And I know how I know,” Tony said looking straight at him. Which meant it was from the data dump, which meant that they were going on a little trip and the way that Tony was ignoring Scott, it also meant that he wasn’t counting on Ant-Man to join them.
“Not... really, I’ve been working on everything all at once, and I finished... well most of it, I’m still trying to get my fiction writing assignment done, but I still can’t get over what Ty did, so I get an... angy...angry,” Tony was tired and Steve knew this, especially if Tony couldn’t say a single word.
“Are you okay,” Steve said placing his hands on Tony’s face. “Anything wrong with you?”
April 7, 1970
“Shit!” a soft voice said from behind him and Tony could feel himself stiffening before putting his hand on Morgan’s mouth.
(See the end of the chapter for
“The real question is who exactly are you?” Sharon had asked looking directly at the woman standing at the center of all of the questions they currently had. “And where have you been all of this time?”
When he came too a few minutes later, Steve was free from his restraints and Tony was now tied up to the bed using just Steve’s now ruined pajamas. “Well this isn’t fair,” he said struggling to get out.
“Well I’m Howard Stark,” his father looked at him curiously. “You look a little green around the gills there, Potts.”
Natasha cleared her throat reminding Steve of what they now had to do, “We have to go,” he said to Tony.
“Yeah,” Tony said feeling defeated for a moment, Natasha wasn’t the only one with another life, Tony being the only actual biological Stark, he couldn’t hide from that life, he didn’t have another last name to hide behind.
“Because I haven’t asked them yet, and I know you and Coulson control the schedule so can you please help me make this happen, I mean I got tickets to Wrestlemania and I know they would say yes if you let them have the night off.”
Honestly Steve didn’t know what to think, the swelling on Tony’s nose had gone down after they had fixed him up and give him some medication, he wasn’t stuffed up anymore either, but what they had given him had been very strong if the other man was talking like this. Just hearing that Tony had liked him when he had been twelve, which would have made Steve fourteen was something else. He had been a scrawny kid, his asthma had kept him from doing a lot, but at sixteen he had grown out of it and hit a growth spurt at the same time.
“I know you got a lot of pull, I’m just saying....” his other self said.
“How do you know that?” Steve asked and Tony knew that he was curious about it too.
“Fine but you’re going in a wheelchair and you can’t complain about it either,” Steve told him before standing up and grabbing the wheelchair that Tony swore hadn’t been there before. Before he could move to get into it, Steve picked him up and slowly put him in the chair, blanket and all. “No complaining.”
“Yes Professor,” Tony answered picking up his laptop and putting it in his bag, “Is there something you need?”
“Don’t make fun of me Rhodey, or I’ll tell Carol about all of your moping when she had gotten deployed two years ago, and you didn’t get to go with her because you had broken your leg and had to do physical therapy.”
“See, the rules of the Quantum Realm aren't like they are up here. Everything is unpredictable,” Scott said while eyeing Natasha’s sandwich. “Is that anybody's sandwich? I'm starving.”
“I don’t think I do Peg,” he said smiling at Tony. “I belong with my family.”
“I’m not, I just didn’t have my morning coffee,” or any coffee for that matter, he was tired and literally living on red bulls at the moment, so he should probably get some food at some point as well. “Are you going to see Thor today?”
“Don’t worry, I won’t make fun of you for it, I like Captain America, although you must hate him if you got teased for having the same name as him, but don’t worry, I won’t tease you,” Tony said trying to make him feel better and Steve felt bad for the first time in his life about the whole Captain America thing.
“No, I’m not going to ground you especially since you’re in college, but you have to come home this weekend, Riri is going to be there, and hopefully Kamala will be there too, I’m going to set some ground rules with you three about being heroes, because I saw how your dad was with Peter, and after what happened I don’t what to think about how he would react if anything happened to you three.”
“Maybe,” he said wondering what she could have seen that was different than what had happened.
Some lines from the movie are on here, but from the end of this chapter on the story begins to diverge a little more. Some lines are spoken by the same characters from the same scene in the movie, others were adjusted to better fit the larger group of people now in the story. Also, I am not a scientist, or an engineer, I'm just a writer messing with a lot of things, so please don’t judge my lack of knowledge when it comes to scientific jargon.
“I endeavor to keep you on your toes Boss,” FRIDAY said to them which made him laugh.
“I thought,” he was about to say something about Tony, but remembered what Bucky had told him about Tony wanting to not be noticed at the school. He also vaguely remembered Tony saying something about his sister that very first day they had met, but he had only thought that she was there helping him move in and nothing else.
“I know Steve, but he needs to grieve, we’ll help him, hell he could live in the guest house with the kids if it makes him feel better... well when the guest house is finished.”
“You worry too much Anthony, he’s not going to runaway just because you said something, if I didn’t run from your father what makes you think that your Steve won’t run from you... I swear you Stark men are too over dramatic for your own good.”
Their first story had been a hit with the professor, this one wasn’t going to be a class thing, but Tony had felt like it was something to be proud of as well. He worked on it just as much as Ty had and he hoped that maybe when it was finished, they could keep this weird writing relationship that they had going on.
The moment Bruce pushed the button Steve felt himself holding his breath as Scott disappeared into the Quantum Tunnel. Barely five seconds passed before Bruce pressed another button and someone appear in the Ant-man suit, from the looks of it, it was a teenage Scott standing there.
“You’ll always be my bambino, no matter how old you get,” she smiled before getting up. “It was nice to finally meet that Rogers boy, especially after all of the stories you told me when you were younger.”
At those words, Steve didn’t move, well his body didn’t move, those baby blues were taking in everything that Tony was doing, after the first snip of Steve’s pajama bottoms, his lips opened up and a little hint of Steve’s pink tongue peaked out. Instead of cutting them all of the way Tony moved to the other leg and snippet just enough before putting the scissors down. Steve’s eyes were losing their patience at Tony’s slow work of his pants, but this was supposed to be a punishment not a reward, plus delayed gratification was what he was going for.
Though he was excited to go home, he really wanted just one more moment with Steve before the break but that wasn’t going to happen especially since Steve had to leave right after his shift on Tuesday night. Jarvis had been the one to drive up to the school to pick them up on Tuesday afternoon, it would just be the kids this year, his parents had to go overseas for the week his dad had urgent business to take care of.
Because Fury had the Avengers, and Steve knew that, except they were too stupid to actually listen to anyone and instead found themselves split up. Steve could feel the churning in his gut, the feeling that he had messed up the moment he had made one decision. And even if Tony could forgive him, he knew for a fact that they still had to work through a lot of what had happened.
Steve wondered just how far Thor’s grief had gone, but they had all been grieving, and while Steve had Tony, Thor had Bruce and Valkyrie with him. Now as they stood there helping out with the calculations that Tony had given them, trying to figure out what they needed to do, Steve had to wonder if he had tried hard enough with everyone. He knew it wasn’t his place, they all needed to grieve in their own way, in their own time, but it still hurt to think that he had let a least one of them down just a little.
At least the library was quiet, Ty was typing away at Tony’s laptop, finishing the story they had been working on for the last couple of weeks. Tony had done most of the work on it, Ty had just written the dialogue and added things here and there. It was the only thing in the school that he had left, which was alright for that moment.
Even now he still couldn’t get a hold of Pepper and Happy and he wasn’t sure what to do about that, he didn’t know if he could deal with anymore loss. Instead of saying anything else, he tapped Steve’s shoulder and walked off in search of Bruce, with the need to help Vision’s recovery along a little more. He knew that he was leaving behind Steve to deal with whatever the hell was happening out there, he knew it wasn’t the best to just walk away but he couldn’t stop thinking about everything, even after a good night’s rest and waking up wrapped up in a super soldier, there were still so many things he needed to get off of his chest, but he didn’t want to tip the balance over whatever for of peace they had gained. Too many were gone, their friends and family were hurting, he didn’t want to have that conversation he just wanted to let it go, and if the only way he could do it was to walk away at that moment and collect his thoughts, well that’s what he was going to do.
Tony looked down at the sheet and smiled, he could do this, math was easy for him, it wasn’t relationships or roommate drama, math was math, “Sure, no problem,” he said wondering if Steve could hear how hard his heart was hammering away inside of his chest.
“Well, what are we gonna do now?” he said turning his attention towards Scott. “You know what, give me a break, I just got hit in the head with a Hulk.”
All of a sudden, he could hear a slight crackling in his ear, “Cap, you hear me?” Sam said, his voice as clear as it had been five years ago. It worked, they brought them back, Tony looked over at him with a smile on his face. “Cap, it's Sam. Can you hear me?”
“Hey Tony,” he said and only got another hum as an answer. “So, I gave my dad some sketches along with some of your stories, and... well he was wondering if we wanted to create it as a comic run.”
“You mean like a mother’s intuition type of thing? I don’t know... maybe... damn now this is going to be in my head.”
“Daddy,” she yelled as her screeching sneakers came looking for them, “Papa,” she called out and Tony groaned.
“Huh,” Scott said looking at Tony like he just said the obvious. “Yeah, we do.”
Morgan’s godparents, ended up being Pepper and Happy, who had gotten married a year after Steve and Tony had, they dotted on the little girl as much as they could. When Pepper wasn’t off running the company or doing a million charity functions, or Happy wasn’t freaking out over people not having their badges, the two spent time at the lake house with them. Pepper, or Aunnie Pepa and Unca Hape, as Morgan would call her, often used the time to wind down, the little girl telling her all kinds of stories about her siblings.
“I’ll try my best, just make sure you guys don’t start without me,” she said giving him a sad smile.
“You first,” she tells him, and while he knows it’s a joke he acts offended.
The rest of the dinner was a quiet affair, everyone sticking to regular conversations, no one really talking about the plan, or anything too heavy. About half way through Clint asked the one question that was on all of their minds, and Nebula threw an apple at him, hitting him a little too hard in the chest, which only made Tony laugh. The truth was, that Nebula and Valkyrie had a weird kind of relationship, one that no one dared ask more of from fear of losing a limb or two, and Bruce and Thor had a relationship of a sort, but it was their private business and no one else’s, though they could all see that the four also had something else going on altogether, but no one dared ask another question fearing Nebula’s knives, which Tony had given her, both of which were made of the same metal that made up her arm, and Steve’s shield, Thor’s hammer which had been scary before but with the axe on the other end was now downright scary, Valkyrie’s sword, or even the Hulk’s rage.
“Where is he? I mean I know Rhodes has been tracking him, but I don’t really know what he’s been up to.”
“I haven’t done anything.”
“Fuck off Bucky,” Steve said crossing his hands over his chest, his face in a permanent scowl that honestly Tony thought was adorable.
“Yeah, we went to a paintball place last weekend, she creamed me,” Bucky answered with a smile almost as if being beating with little paint ball pellets by Natasha was some kind of foreplay, which honestly is shouldn’t be, he knew how much those things hurt. “I also liked watching her dance in the gym a few nights ago, and we went to an MMA fight too.”
“We all lost someone, some more than most,” he told her reminded of the Battle of Wakanda, the look on Shuri’s face when she was told that her brother hadn’t made it. She had lost her mother who had gone to help her after one of Thanos’ children had broken in to get to Vision. He still sees the broken look in Tony’s eyes when he looks at the picture of him and Peter that sits in the kitchen of their still unfinished house.
Bucky was focused on Natasha, but Steve was focused on Tony looking at him like he knew something was wrong, but Tony didn’t want to say what was the problem. Instead of bringing attention to it, Tony just put his arms around Steve’s waist and inhaled his scent. There was nothing better than Steve’s smell, because he smelled like coffee and apple pie, but that was only because he worked at Tony’s favorite place in the world, well actually anywhere that had copious amounts of coffee was Tony’s favorite place in the world, but that particular place had Steve so it was in the number one spot.
“I was just running it by you, I figured that I could work on it and once I graduated maybe I’d try it out.”
“I guess we have somethings to talk about, don’t we?”
“Don’t worry, I think somehow I decided to stay for two reasons, the first is you, Steve I know this is crazy, but just knowing you is enough for me to try and fight for whatever we could have, even if it’s just friendship.”
“I’m trying to hope for something better,” he said even though he was scared out of his mind with worry, over not being able to reverse the snap, over the mission the others were now on, over losing even more people that he cared about, over losing himself because of all of this. “What would you say to checking over something for me, I have this idea that maybe we can sensitize the stone out of the information we gathered on it.”
He wanted to face Tony again, but not as this Steve Rogers, but as the one that got along with Tony Stark, as the one that had been friends with him long before the fight in Siberia, without what Tony had dubbed his depression beard. So, instead of heading towards medical, Steve made his way towards his room, ignoring the laughing coming from the common area, ignoring those in the kitchens as they called out to him. He locked the door of his room and looked at the one place he had left behind, his home, it had been something that Tony had given him, something tangible in this new world. He had made friends here, a family, and even though he had constantly denied it, he had also fallen for the wayward genius.
“We're on it, Cap,” Hope said as her and Scott rushed off towards where Valkyrie pointed out the van.
“To come home to my room, you know normal things like that, plus I have a date tonight unlike the two of you who decided that getting together meant napping and not going out.”
“Steve,” he called out trying to say anything, but Steve was unrelenting, he could focus on more than one thing, he wasn’t a master tactician for nothing, but when he used it in the bedroom, Tony was sure that it would kill him because at that moment he couldn’t come. His body was buzzing, everything was too sensitive, he could feel one of Steve’s hands holding him up, while the other traced Tony’s other nipple, abusing the puckered flesh while Steve’s mouth bit down on the other, before giving it a lick.
“Can you bring him back?” Steve asked, “Or make him normal again?”
“Why do you like Captain America so much?” he asked leaning back, letting himself see this side of Tony, the side of him that liked superhero comics and wrote about the characters like they were his own. “I mean, there has to be a reason why.”
All he could do was sigh, he didn’t know what to say that would reassure the man he loved, but before he could even say anything the door swung open and Peggy Carter stepped into the room. The two of stood still, neither one knowing what to do, but when the lights went on, Steve could see the sad look in Tony’s eyes, he knew that this was a moment that Steve had dreamed of for years. But what Tony hadn’t known was that the moment didn’t mean much to him anymore, he had everything he could have ever wanted.
“Mine is in the waiting room,” he said but he knew he would get in trouble, he wasn’t the best at sneaking out.
Steve obviously hadn't done very well at hiding it though, because she raised an eyebrow at him from behind Tony as she said, "And it's not your fault, but you're forgiven anyway."
Sure enough, Peggy and Sharon started a soft humming with wordless thoughts that Tony couldn't quite translate, but he could feel.  The melody was earthy and deep, beautiful in ways that made Tony long for a proper dance partner.  One that he could hold on to while the band played real slow, with a heady perfume that was sealed with a kiss.  Wistful, almost, like the one that got away.
Tony gave him a press-conference smile.  Something had gone wrong.  That told Steve that he had gone wrong somewhere, but he couldn't tell where he had misstepped for the life of him.  "Of course, Captain," Tony said.  "I'll let him know."
"Tony..." Steve said, his voice soft.  "Thank you."
With friends like these, Steve didn't need enemies. "Nat..."
"And that would be best for all involved, since confirming what I already know would just make the situation worse," Fury said, nodding.
Ms. Potts was staring at the desk by the window with a frown on her face instead of paying attention to Stark, however. Steve felt a growing sense of dread.
So did the sergeant.  As he radioed in to find Tony, Steve looked around.  There was another airman missing from their escort, so at least Tony wasn't sneaking around.  He checked his phone and typed out a quick message to Natasha, filling her in.
"Thank you."  He felt the soft brush of lips against his cheek, but didn't feel as excited as he might have been at the start of this journey.  Instead, he thought of Steve curled around him, blue eyes shining with affection in the crystal's light.  He wasn't completely comfortable with those thoughts, however, so he focused on the softness of Viper's lips.
"Yeah," Steve said, watching the ground for loose rubble as the heaviness settled over him again.  Of course Iron Man would look out for Bruce.  But would he really, if he's forsaken Clint and Natasha?
Rhodey nodded.  "Life never stops when we want it to."
Thor pat Steve on the back again, which gained him a rueful smile.  "It is a band popular among young women, as I understand it," Thor explained.
"I'm going to let you go now, so please don't attack," Steve said, keeping his voice gentle.  Kestrel nodded and tensed, but she did as he said.  When she wobbled to the side, he caught her shoulder, but didn't restrain her again.
Steve snorted, though his nostrils were flared in amusement.  "I've got things I can do here," Steve said, going back to the original conversation.  "Not bored.  Besides, how would you get back to the city if no one was here?"
"No problem, Cap."  His voice didn't break, but it was a near thing, and he couldn't help the disappointment when Steve pulled away.
* * *
Steve started to sway them slowly, a rock step that barely counted as a movement, but fit the melody in his head as he started to hum tunelessly.  It wasn't his dance with Peggy.  He didn't even know if he'd get a second dance with Tony.  But it was something, and having Tony in his arms now went a long way to soothing his self-doubt.  He hadn't messed this up so terribly that Tony wouldn't forgive him.
Bright red and navy blue, passion and flame, dancing and music.  The rose that blooms in adversity and the immutable constant of the sea.
Things got a little fuzzy after that, but he did force his eyes open again when he felt Steve shake him.  "Steve?"
"I trust my Captain's judgement," Thor said.  "As I trust Iron Man and what I've seen of his employer.  I do not think they mean us ill, but you are right in believing something suspicious going on."
"Iron Man came to me with a proposition that I assumed was from Mr. Stark.  Doom will not suffer another tyrant to mimic his technology, especially not one from the future.  I agreed to help decode his message as I have previously dabbled in time travel.  After the message was decoded..."  Doom said, his cold eyes falling on Steve.  "I have no love for you, Captain.  But a world overrun by Hydra would make Latveria a very small footnote in German history."
He wasn't surprised to receive a slap from the naga for his troubles.  Avoiding pain had never been one of Tony's strong points.  "Show sssome resspect for Madame Hydra," the man hissed.
" Steve said.
Steve did not glare at Sam, because that would constitute as sulking and he refused to dignify that with an answer. Given how Sam started to laugh harder, it didn't work as well as Steve had hoped.
With a sigh, Steve gave up on the Rhodey drawing for now.  He'd return to it later when he was more focused and could give it the attention it deserved.
"Dr. Foster," Tony said, glaring at Rhodey's abandonment.  Rhodey held his free hand up in a gesture of 'not touching this.'  "Welcome to New Yo-"
"'Cause I've seen that look in the mirror enough times," Tony replied, and she thought he would be shrugging if she could have seen him.  "That's what Cap always told me when he saw it.  Don't tell him I said that though.  He's a smug bastard as it is."
"I'm not that important!" Tony yelled, swallowing against the bile as Steve sped up.  His eyes stung and he didn't think it was just the wind.
"I'm okay, thank you," Steve said.  Then he turned to Tony.  "I can come back later-"
it...  Tony felt something in his chest flutter.  Steve wasn't throwing disapproval his way, but open acceptance.
She didn't laugh at him, but he could tell it was a near thing even in this horrible light.  "Just make sure it doesn't happen again," she said.  If she weren't the upstanding and highly professional woman he knew her to be, Steve would have sworn she said that a little louder than normal in revenge.
Steve stopped in his tracks.  He hadn't realized he'd been moving.  "You're Iron Man," Steve said.  This wasn't just Tony borrowing the suit.  He'd performed maneuvers that Steve had taught Iron Man, and he was pretty sure a civilian wouldn't have the muscle memory to pull it off.  He didn't know how to feel.  Surprised, definitely.  Angry at being lied to.  Understanding for
"What can we do about it?" Kes asked angrily.
Steve's frustration and embarrassment as the man whined low in the back of his throat.
Steve was stiff under him, his hands hovering at Tony's sides for a moment.  Tony could almost feel the moment Steve snapped, a sharp breath being drawn under him, and then Steve's arms wrapping tightly around his back as his shoulders shook and he buried his face against Tony's hair.  "Tony, God, I..." Steve said, his voice trembling.
“Blasphemy, she loves us both, she has no favorites,” he said smiling. “What are you reading?”
“Did you guys figure it out?” Steve asked him when he walked into the kitchen. The smell of mac and cheese in the air, which meant that Steve was nervous and a nervous Steve starts baking everything he could.
“I think they’re just glad that you’re crazy enough to deal with him,” Steve said his voice had a hint of glee in it. “I love you Buck, but honestly you’re a little nuts.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Pep.... light of my life,” Tony started but the woman just put her hand up and be stopped talking.
“Don’t leave,” Tony whispered, and it tugged at Steve’s heart especially when Tony reached out for him.
“I want to come with you,” Steve said before taking Tony’s hand, no doubt taking not of how it was shaking, because Tony didn’t do anything in halves, he was well on his way to having a panic attack and he knew it.
“Pops is going to kill you,” Riri said once she stopped laughing. “There was that rule, especially after that incident with the microwave, and you broke it.”
“Like dad would be any better once the girls are born,” Steve added, knowing that most likely his father would become an overprotective papa bear.
“What’s dad saying now?”
If Shuri’s call had been a warning, what was about to happen was a full-on storm, and he wasn’t ready for it at all. Sending Morgan into the house with her sisters, he watched Scott told him what he had learned from the Quantum Realm, as Hope chimed in, as Steve looked at him worriedly, Nat’s face not betraying much. They already knew what was going on, and Tony’s not sure how he feels about it.
“Tony, I don’t know,” Steve said, and Tony knew that Steve still had issues with the Shield, he had let go of it once and lost everything.
“Is it okay... you know... if I like Steve?”
“Let’s get to work then,” Natasha said with a smile on her face, Tony walked up to her and hugged her. They had been close once, they still were, but not like they had been before, grief can consume a person, and he knew he had failed her, but this was the way to make it up to her.
“Yeah, my phone was with my coat, Nat just left hers behind because we don’t like upsetting our mom... anyway, she knew we wouldn’t have done it if it weren’t for the fact that we were worried to death, so she got Thor to drive us.”
“That’s how Wanda got her powers too, well not from an explosion, but from one of the stones,” Steve said to the group. “How is it possible for the stones to give people powers like that?”
“No in a million years,” Tony smiled at him and it warmed him from the inside out to think that this was something he looked forward too. “Have I ever told you about my obsession with cheeseburgers?”
I didn't put in the Professor Hulk thing, mainly because I've always thought that the Hulk and Bruce were two separate beings that existed within one body, plus I like that they're different, it makes it more fun!! There's also a few relationships happening.... mostly between the same four people. I ship them.... that's all that matters
With a quick kiss to Tony, he took a deep breath, “Don’t die,” he said before turning to Thanos’s army, “AVENGERS,” he called out as everyone took their place, calling out to Mjölnir as he yelled out. “ASSEMBLE.”
“What’s up, regular sized man?” Rhodey says before walking off with Nebula, as they make their way towards where Steve and Tony were both standing.
“She’s a superstar this one,” Tony said smiling at his little girl.
“Tony,” someone yelled but Steve felt everything muffle around him, all his saw was Tony’s still form in his arms. “Shit, get a stretcher,” the voice said Steve felt like everything had gone backwards so fast and he couldn’t stop it. The cradle sparking again next to him this time sending a shock towards him.
“We have to try,” Scott added, a hopeful look in his eyes, one that Tony had seen when he had come to the house.
Shuri nodded at them, “Tractors engaged.”
They didn’t say much after that, Tony never finished reading the rest of the story to Steve, instead they stayed there, Tony wrapped in Steve’s arms. It was strange for Tony to have wanted something for so long, something that hadn’t been handed to him because he was a Stark, and all of a sudden there he was in Steve’s arms. He took in the warmth, leaning into it, not realizing that he had fallen asleep.
“Because I trust you with everything I have, you’re the smartest person I know,” Steve said kissing him quickly just in case there was someone watching them.
“They'll never know it. Because you won't be alive to tell them,” Thanos answered and honestly that was going to be the reason why Tony shoved a boot up his ass.
“Thanos found the Soul Stone on Vormir,” she said never looking at anyone in the room, the stone floating around in front of her was the only thing holding her attention.
“Oh,” Steve said, he had been so preoccupied with getting ready for the party, he had forgotten that he had given his father Tony’s stories, and some art that Steve himself had drawn, as a way to keep Captain America around, but under him and not his father, with his drawings and Tony’s writing, he had also wanted to bring Iron Man into the story as well as all of the characters that Tony had created.
It was slow work tying Steve’s arms to the headboard, before securing his legs to the pillow, if there was one thing that Tony had been grateful for it was the fact that after the serum Steve had become a very heavy sleeper, the only time he didn’t sleep well was when he had nightmares, or when he was on missions because he would be on high alert. But, in the comfort and safety of their own home Steve slept soundly, or at least that’s what Tony would like to think. He was never sure if Steve told him that just to keep him in the dark so that whenever he wanted to jump on Tony, he could do it without Tony being aware of it. Not that he minded that either. Luckily for Tony, he finished up with the restraints just as Steve began to stir.
“Tony... We have to take a stand,” Natasha said and he wasn’t sure just how much he was willing to lose over a half-baked plan that may or may not work.
“I understand that,” Bucky said with a smile.
When it started getting a little chilly outside, Kamala and Riri had started cleaning up, Morgan picking at her pants and looking around. “What do you want to do now girls?” he asked as he stood, his legs hurting telling him that he wasn’t as young as he used to be, well at least not to be sitting on a little kid’s chair the way he had.
The heat on his cheeks reminded him of how proud he was of Tony for writing these characters, but also knowing how happy Tony would be from hearing something like this, to see his characters be brought to life as well. He was about to thank his father when they heard a cry from the other room, Steve looked at his father before watching the man rush off to the other room, Steve wasn’t that far behind. When they walked into the room, his mother was standing over a puddle clutching her belly.
“On the count of three,” Bruce said looking at the group around him before saying, “3... 2... 1!”
“I’m pretty sure out of all of us, you, Hope, and Shuri are the only ones who haven’t been near one,” Steve said to them. “The rest of us have in one way or another.”
He couldn’t help but beam at the smile that Steve gave him, “It’s a surprise,” Steve told him, “I hope you finished everything you needed to finish for your classes, I don’t want to keep you from your work.”
“Yup,” was the only thing he said back before getting into the machine itself. He could automatically feel Steve’s presence as he walked into the room. They were so attuned to one another that it was instinct when the other one came in. “Hey,” he said as Steve kissed him on the cheek.
By the end of the night the story was done, and Tony felt like he had accomplished something that had nothing to do with his father’s plan for him. It felt good, but as they were leaving the library, he had noticed just how dark it was outside, and he was alone because Ty had lived in the opposite direction. Tony wasn’t huge on walking alone in the dark, blame it on being kidnapped when he had been little, sometimes all he remembered was the darkness and nothing else.
Tony pulled out of Steve’s mouth before Steve could push him over the edge completely, seeing the hooded look in Steve’s eyes as Tony’s ass bumped against Steve’s own stiff erection was enough to throw both of them over the edge. If it weren’t for the ring on Steve’s dick, and Tony’s willpower at the moment, then this would have been over a long time ago. Grabbing the last toy, he had hidden away, a cock ring for Tony, colored in Steve’s blues, with a little star on the center, Tony slipped it on before activating it. He loved technology so much, especially when he could create things like this.
I added that you're just like me line for Peter and Miles to reference Into the Spiderverse.
“She’s good, she moved back to England over the summer, but she’s doing great,” Sharon then turned her attention to Steve, and he didn’t know what to think about what was happening. “If I had known,” she said to Steve, even though he was still a little dumbstruck.
“Oh, come on,” Tony said looking at the hole in the wall before turning back to the Thor who had just let out a smile.
“Yes, boss,” FRIDAY said as the room went into lock down.
“Five years ago,” Bruce started as Steve sat down next to him. “Five years ago, we got our asses beat. Except it was worse for me, because I lost twice. First, Hulk lost, then Banner lost. Then, we all lost.”
He took the scepter and his shield and ran off as quickly as he could, since his other self had told SHIELD that he had seen him, they were most likely on their way to where he was and he didn’t want them to find him still standing there thinking that he was Loki. Which was strange to him because he could have sworn that around this time they would have had Loki detained so what could have happened that they would have thought that he was Loki.
Bucky spent the rest of the drive talking about his classes, Steve was an Art major with a double minor in Art History and World History, while Bucky had gone for a business major with a minor in psychology. They had one class together, a prereq that they hadn’t taken yet, in some advance mathematics class, but that was it. Steve parked the car and started unloading, still wondering why anyone named Stark would be at their school, though he had rumors over the summer that the two youngest in the Stark family were starting college in the fall, they had kept what school they were going to out of the papers, so it was entirely possible that one of them would have ended up at their school.
“You changed your clothes... so does that mean you’re going?”
Steve couldn’t help but stiffen at the way she had said his name, “Now Pepper,” Tony said trying his best to give her puppy eyes, which didn’t faze the woman at all.
“But,” Shuri tried to say but Pepper looked over at her and the girl shut up quickly.
“Not a lot of people do, actually I think I can count on one hand the amount of people that know, but I also know that there’s someone out there for you, and it’s probably someone really close, you just have to open up to the possibility of that relationship happening.”
“You’re still grounded young man,” Tony said as he landed next to them all, pulling back the helmet and looking over at Steve with a wink. Steve couldn’t help but feel relived at the sight of them, they were all safe.
