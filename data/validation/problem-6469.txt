Back at the house Tony immediately went to his room to have some time to himself. Well, to sulk actually.
By the look on Bucky’s face, he had also picked up on Sam’s message as well. He lowered his weapon and strode straight past Steve, who picked up his shield. Not to fight his friend, but to protect him from what was about to come. He wanted to avoid a fight at all costs, but if he was forced to, Steve would do anything to protect Bucky.
There was another kick under the table and Clint agreed that it was a great idea to go hiking together.
She leaned ever so slightly into his touch. “Just… just talk to him. Please?” Before he could argue, her hand on his shoulder tightened to a grip. “Steve, he knows. He knows what you feel for him.”
Tony liked that Bruce knew him well enough to know that something was up and that he had the balls to point it out to him. There were only two other people in the world who knew him like that. And Pepper barely talked to him anymore, unless it was something about Stark Industries. After their kiss on the roof, with the Stark Expo exploding in the background they went on a few dates and then New York happened. And then… nothing. It wasn’t like Tony didn’t think that Pepper was attractive and smart and by far the most amazing woman he had ever met. He adored her and he wished he could love her in more than just a platonic way. He wished he could give her the love she deserved. Not that she needed him for that. But still, it hurt him when he saw her face drop after he explained to her that their one kiss was all that there would ever be.
Unable to look her in the eyes, Tony started explaining what happened and who Justin Hammer was. He told her of all the bad deals he had been proven to be involved in and the many, many others, that he could never prove. He told her of his partnership with Obadiah and the suspicion that Hammer had a hand in Tony’s kidnapping three years ago.
“I think I should leave you two alone. Take care of yourself May.” Strange gave Tony a reassuring look, before he turned and left the room.
“It’s times like this that I wish I carried a camera with me.” Clint’s voice rang. Tony rolled his eyes and lifted his head slightly to look at him, the movement waking up Thor.
Two weeks later and Tony is still not happy about his new neighbour. He is even less happy about one of his customers.
Tony didn’t know how often he hit the man in front of him, didn’t feel the pain in his fist, didn’t hear Peter telling him to stop. Only when a pair of unusually strong hands pulled him away from his target did Tony come to himself again. He blinked rapidly like waking up from a nightmare, eyes wandering from the beaten up figure hunched against a bookshelf to Peter standing by the door looking scared and in an instant all his anger faded away and was replaced by shame and regret. Not regret about giving Hammer what he deserved, but that Peter had seen him like this.
Ten minutes later, Steve left the pet-store, his face not quite as red as Bruce’s was but still far from its normal colour.
“So, the rules are as follows,” Nat started explaining. “Everyone writes down two things they want to find out if the others have done and put the slips of paper in this lovely hat donated by Clint.”
“Oh, don’t be ridiculous. Why would I be jealous of Steve? I mean sure Nat is hot and when I first met her, I totally thought about her in that way and I might have flirted with her for a bit, but no. She is too intense. And scary. That woman could kill you with her thighs, Happy swore he saw her do it. I mean kill a man with her thighs do it, not do it do it, you know? Also just think about poor Clint, it would break his heart if I swooped her away from him, because let’s be honest, I could get her before he would. And if she wants to be with Steve, that’s great for her. I mean she could do worse. Probably did. Steve isn’t that bad. I mean if you like that obvious kind of handsome with the blond hair and blue eyes and all that muscle on the man, not to mention that as-… astronomical back. Not that I think that Steve is handsome. He probably is for others. Like Nat. Why are you looking at me like that?”
, conjured up enough courage to talk to Tony and a structure of rectangular cloth bags filled with feathers foiled his plans. Just his luck.
That was also exactly how Clint and Thor behaved. Neither of them really wanted to be there going on a hike, but both were too afraid of Nat to say no. Now they were sulkily walking behind her and Steve, who were leading them through the little jungle of the island, Natasha’s small frame next to Steve’s broad shoulders. Bruce and Tony tailed along in the back.
If you liked my little fic, please feel free to leave a comment or kudos, they are what writers live for.
Five minutes later Clint and Bruce came out of the kitchen to join the others by the pool. The scene in front of them was like something out of a very bad movie.
“They’re in love or something.” He certainly wasn’t serious about that, he knew for sure that Nat had her eye on another team mate and that her and Steve were just close friends.
Tony hadn’t been able to sleep much that night and according to the footsteps and the mumbling coming from the room next to his, neither was Steve. Something was definitely up.
He slammed his drink down onto the table and got up. “You know what, I think the night is over.” His voice hard and cold. Without a second glance at her, or anyone else, he went upstairs.
It took Steve a lot of energy to not roll his eyes and to hold back the deep sigh, that was trying to force its way out.
So, Steve took a deep breath and readied himself for the ridicule. “Thor and I watch Keeping up with the Kardashians every Sunday night. Yes, we wear our pyjamas, yes we eat popcorn and yes we are ashamed of it.”
Steve sat up and swung his legs over the chair. “Sure. You forget that I am quite good a drawing. Can’t be that more difficult, right?”
“Blind baking. Sounds kind of kinky is you ask me. Now where are those idiotic beans?” Tony mumbled, walking into the small supply closet.
Steve was lying in bed, watching the ceiling. He body was screaming for sleep, but his brain was wide awake.
When he didn’t reply, she sighed and put her hand on his. “You know I can’t go back to my old life. Not after all this.”
When he was a child his family spend their summer holidays wherever his father had to work and the few times, he had actually gone to the beach it was either with Jarvis or his nanny. He had never built a sandcastle before.
“Nurse told me you don’t want any painkillers. I would recommend a local anaesthetic for the stitches they - “
Not because he thought maybe Steve was just confused or all the other crap people say about bisexual people, like it’s just a phase or whatever. No, what concerned him was that Steve had a crush on him of all people. Heaven knows Steve was no angel, but he undeniably deserved better than him. He deserved someone who could make him feel safe, even more so if this was indeed his first time. He deserved someone who wasn’t as messed up as he was.
“You’re right.” He lifted her hand to his mouth and gave it a soft kiss. “But let me know if you want the store back and I make sure it’s yours.”
Because another thing she would never admit was that she actually liked Tony. Sure, he used to be vain and self-absorbed, used to drive everyone crazy with his snide remarks and cocky attitude, but he had become more to her, to all of them. Because as it turns out Tony Stark not only has a heart, but a great one at that. After the battle of New York, he not only remodelled the Stark Tower for all of them to live in, he also made sure they felt at home here. It was the small things, like that way he designed their rooms, tailored specifically to their personality. Or how he constantly improved their gear, how he made sure everyone’s comfort food was always ready and stocked. He played prank wars with Clint, tried his best to teach Thor about this world, made Bruce feel safe and calm, he let her steal his t-shirt and even helped her loot the other’s closets. Tony Stark was a good man and she’d be damned if someone hurt him.
“Everyone come and behold our mighty pillow fort!” Thor called from the living room. Tony’s focus shifted from Steve’s face to the God of Thunder and by the look of his construction, apparently also the God of Pillow forts.
Tony’s hand came to rest on Steve’s knee once more. “I’m not saying this will work. Or that we will never fight. Or that it will be easy. But I will promise you that I will try everything in my power to make it work, to not fight and to make it as easy to love me as possible. And I will promise to love you and to make you happy.”
Thor had just finished giving Tony a tour of his pillow fort, when Bruce came over with the food. Aside from several pizzas, there was also an assortment of sweets, including popcorn, chocolate and cookie dough, as well as chips and freshly made guacamole and salsa. Steve looked a bit calmer now that he had taken his anger out on the onions.
Tony and Steve got lucky, pun probably not intended, with the two rooms at the top floor. Thor and Bruce ended up in the middle, while Nat and Clint got the rooms on the bottom floor. Not that any of the rooms weren’t nice, because they were, but the top ones had the best view over the whole bay.
"Thank you. For staying. And if at any point you feel overwhelmed just let me know. We can come up here and hide for a bit. Or go for a walk. Or sit on the top of the tower and look down on the city. Whatever it takes."
After he left blonde guy, Tony had made his way straight to the hospital, leaving his own bookstore closed for the morning. That was the beauty of being your own boss, you could come and go as you pleased.
And that was exactly where Tony and Thor were hiding. They didn’t feel like sunbathing with the others, even though it was a beautiful day. Or maybe because it was such a beautiful day, the sunshine and soft waves standing in such a stark contrast to their gloomy mood.
Tony looked at her in confusion, but she already stopped paying attention to him, taking Clint by the hand and disappearing out of the room.
Steve wrung his hands nervously. Everything was set up nicely and just perfect but that didn’t mean they would accept it. Accept him.
“Well, I for one would love a break.” Clint announced and Natasha and Bruce were nodding in agreement, all of them looking exhausted.
This time Nat didn’t look at him, just kept walking by his side, seemingly taking in the scenery in front of them. They were surrounded by thick vegetation, fleshy green leaves, vines, flowers in shapes in colours Steve didn’t think possible and tree trunks so big that two men wouldn’t be able to span their arms around them. He made a mental note to come back some other time, so he could capture this beauty in his sketch book.
But at the moment it seemed like Bucky was running from the police just as much as he was running from Steve.
The fact that no one picked Tony up on his too high-pitched voice or made a joke about him saying the sentence “I want to change”, even further confirmed that something was clearly wrong. On any other day Tony would have to endure endless teasing, especially from Clint. But now – nothing but awkward silence, that was eventually broken by Thor clapping his hands.
Tony was sure he must have a concussion, because that wasn’t something Fury would say. He usually threw a fit when they wanted just a couple of days off.
Bruce shrugged. “Well, I couldn’t watch you tiptoe around each other anymore. And I certainly couldn’t watch those two,” with that he pointed to Clint and Natasha, “try, and fail, to get you and Tony to talk. So, I locked you in. And then I locked Tasha and Clint into the bathroom, because they were just as bad and needed to get their shit together. Now get out of my kitchen so I can make lunch.”
Even though Thor didn’t get hurt during the battle, he still wasn’t going to say no to a vacation. He would love to see more of Midgard.
Nevertheless, the flight was spend with the two couples being annoyingly in love, and Bruce seriously questioned if this was better than the pining.
The moment he picked up the needle to stitch up Tony’s cuts, Strange became serious again and a small line between his eyebrows formed in concentration. Maybe it was good that a neurosurgeon was patching him back up, you couldn’t wish for a steadier hand. Observing how Strange’s finger worked on his hand, somehow managed to calm Tony down a little and distract from the blinding pain shooting through his body every time the needle pierced his sensitive skin.
“You are!” He sounded way to smug and there was a sort of glee in his voice that Tony usually just knew from himself.
The next morning Steve was up early as usual. Tony was still lying in bed on his belly, putting a chainsaw to shame with his snoring. On any other morning Steve would have been out and about by this time, either on one of his morning runs or down in the kitchen, sitting at the counter with Bruce having breakfast. Not this morning though. This morning his head was buried in a thick file labelled “Secret Santa”.
Steve and Thor didn’t know either of the other movies making it absolutely impossible to decide. Eventually, they let fate take the reins, fate being a coin.
Ignoring him, Nat continued. “Then we take turns reading. If you have done the thing you drink and if you haven’t done it, you watch as the cool kids get wasted.”
“We were supposed to go running together. Remember?” Tony asked. Steve’s behaviour was starting to worry him.
Even after the weird couple of days they had, Steve’s feelings about Tony haven’t changed a bit. He still wanted there to be something. He still wanted… Tony.
Tony frowned at his tone. Steve, unlike him, was a morning person, sometimes disgustingly so. More than once his cheerfulness made Tony want to throw a mug at him in the morning. This was definitely not the case now. “Good morning to you too, Cap.”
Instead the door was unlocked and opened. Tony practically leapt off Steve’s lap, clutching the undone apron to his chest, a sudden feeling of modesty coming over him, that was far from typical for him. The doorframe was filled by a broad figure.
He was scared that even if Tony did care for Steve in the same way, that it would sooner or later go down the drain anyways. Steve was by far not an easy person to live with. His nights were plagued by nightmares, he was restless all the time, got up way too early for a normal human being, was almost constantly on edge. This was not a good basis for a relationship.
Steve had to fight the urge to turn back around again. Tony must not be aware of the fact that he could be seen from the house because otherwise he wouldn’t be naked, Steve told himself.
A few minutes later Steve appeared at the pool, wearing the only pair of shorts he could find in his bag, even though he was sure he had packed more and none of them had the Star-Spangled Banner on them. He wondered who could possibly have changed them.
He had two daggers custom made for her, one with her emblem of an hourglass and the other with his shield engraved on it.
“Now if you excuse me, I have a meal to prepare.” Bruce turned around on the spot and disappeared back into the kitchen.
“Maybe if you ask nicely, he will do yours too.” Natasha grinned up at Tony. She had to admit that Steve was doing a great job and she already made a mental note for the next time she wanted her nails done.
At that Tony couldn’t help himself but laugh as well. He knew May was right. But that didn’t mean he liked it. May and her bakery across the street had become a fixture in Tony’s life. After Afghanistan and the betrayal of one of the people closest to him, the thing Tony had needed the most was stability. True, all of this happened over three years ago, and he was doing much better now. He hadn’t had a drink in two years and his nightmares became less regular, yet he was still afraid of derailing again.
A few minutes later everyone was assembled around the kitchen counter, listening to Bruce’s instructions about how to make the perfect quiche.
Clint folded second, mumbling something about marked cards. Steve was the next to go. Tory had the impression, that Steve’s mind was somewhere else, far away from the poker table, so he wasn’t surprised when he excused himself after losing his last couple of chips.
By now Tony’s wrist had doubled in size and the throbbing pain made him dizzy. Yet he had refused the offer of pain killers from the nurse. He already lost control in one way today, he didn’t need the temptation of a second.
Bruce shook his head and took out his book, lying down a bit further down the beach, so not to disturb the men at work. “Nerds.” He mumbled with a grin.
“Oh, Stephen I didn’t see you there. How are you? Did you get the cookies I send you?” Speaking to the doctor who had removed her tumour, May’s voice was as soft and pleasant as usual.
Thor was asleep on his unicorn inflatable in the pool, while Natasha had Tony’s right arm twisted behind his back, so Steve, still in his American flag bathing shorts, could paint his left one with Nat’s black varnish. By now Tony had stopped struggling physically, because even though Nat’s wrist was injured, she still had a hell of a death grip on him, but that didn’t stop him from swearing like a sailor, threatening unimaginable pain on Steve and Natasha.
They made their way upstairs to get rid of their bags and explore the house. The bedrooms were amazing, each equipped with a king-sized bed with white mosquito nets spanning over the bedposts, a few comfy chairs surrounding a small table with fragrant pink flowers on it, and the obligatory minibar. The white pillows and cushions everywhere stood in a stark contrast to the dark wood of the furniture, floor and ceiling. One of the walls was a huge window front facing, depending on the room, either the ocean or the jungle, bathing the whole room in warm light.
Tony made his way over to the kitchen, where Bruce was already going through all the drawers and cabinets. “Tony, I think I’m in heaven.” Bruce didn’t even turn around, still roaming around in one of the cupboards. Clint meanwhile had his head stuck in the fridge, emerging with a huge grin and a box of doughnuts. “Hello there my pretties.”
Steve felt uncomfortable being cared for like that. He was used to powering though on his own and having someone cook almost every meal for him felt weird. So, he tried to assist Bruce in the kitchen. Considering that he was a military man one would think that he was better in following orders given to him. But no such luck. While Steve was more than capable in most things in life, he still didn’t come up even close to Bruce’s kitchen-standards. The man had high demands and even a super soldier couldn’t handle them. After a few months of being shouted at by Bruce, Steve as well gave up.
“A strong defence is more important than what you just said. And it’s a mighty fort not a castle!” Thor shouted back, holding the shovel out of Tony’s reach.
“How?” Bruce asked and Tony just shrugged his shoulders, with a sly smile on his lips that no one dared to ask about.
Not once had Steve asked Tony to help him with his search, he felt like that it was his job, his duty to find Bucky. Sure, they had talked about Bucky, more than once, Steve told him all about what happened on the helicarrier. Told him that Bucky seemed to remember him. Told him how he would do anything to get his friend back.
“Well… yes. Did you think I cooked all this myself?” The only edible thing Steve was able to produce in the kitchen was omelette and apple pie, the letter throwing Tony into a laughing fit when he first found out. Apparently, it was just too cliché that Captain America made apple pie. And even with those quite simple dishes, Steve always made an impossible amount of mess, which as a consequence got him banned from the kitchen in the Avengers Tower. The team’s eyes went to the spotless kitchen.
Tony still didn’t understand what had come over Bruce and why he suddenly insisted on teaching them how to cook, when all he’s done the last couple of years was yell at them when they came anywhere near the kitchen.
Clint was about to retort, but Natasha’s shaking hand taking hold of his under the table stopped him. This was her fight, not his. But that didn’t mean that he wasn’t pissed.
His top fix-it-plans were to either sweep Tony off his feet with a grand romantic gesture, flowers, chocolates and other rom-com clichés or… or to just pretend like nothing had happened.
Someone slipped a sheet of paper under the door with one word written on it in red lipstick. “TALK!”
Tony’s mouth opened and closed a few times, but no words escaped him. It was one of those rare occasions where Tony Stark was rendered speechless.
Strange walked over to her and gave her a quick hug. “The cookies were amazing, May. Thanks. But you shouldn’t be out of bed yet, the stress isn’t good for you.”
Fury has been rambling on for what felt like hours and Tony was getting impatient. He shifted in his seat and sighed.
“That… would be… good.” Since when was talking so difficult? This was all kinds of ridiculous. Steve’s palms were sweaty, and his heart was going at an abnormal rate and he was sure everyone could see it racing in his chest.
Before Tony could say anything, blond guy darted to the back of the shop were the kitchen was and came back a moment later with a damp cloth, rubbing furiously on Tony’s thigh where the paint had hit him.
He was almost sure that Nat either hadn’t heard him or chose to give it a rest, but of course he wasn’t that lucky. This was Natasha Romanoff after all.
“I… Sorry. I’m just gonna… yeah…” Steve stammered and pushed past Tony to get to his room, slightly crouched over and still holding the towel against his front. Only his front.
Standing in the elevator with his finger hovering over the buttons trying to decide what to do, he actually jumped a little when he heard J.A.R.V.I.S. over the speakers.
“M-maybe we should call an ambulance?” Was that Peter’s voice? God, he sounded so shaken up. Tony could only imagine what it must have looked like for him. He didn’t know Hammer and what kind of monster he was. He just saw the man he worked for attack a random guy and beat the crap out of him.
Shaking his head, he peaked out of the bathroom door, to make sure no one was in the hallway and then hurried to his room. Steve always showered after travelling, it refreshed him.
“What do you want, Hammer?” Tony asked between clenched teeth. He hated that guy to the guts. His whole attitude made Tony uneasy, the way he talked and moved reminded him of a snake. Since the day Tony joined the weapon making business, Hammer was always there trying to one-up him, trying to imitate him in everything he did. Hammer was the classic jealous type, searching out the spotlight. As if his terrible personality weren’t bad enough, Hammer was involved in a lot of sketchy business deals, even for a weapons dealer, and on more than one occasion worked together with Obadiah. Of course, Tony couldn’t prove it, otherwise he would have made sure that Hammer never saw the light of day again.
After a little more drinking and a little nap on one of the deck chairs by the upstairs pool, Tony made his way downstairs where the others were sitting on the sofa in the common room having dinner.
Tony had his fist clasped firmly around the handles of his leather travel bag, avoiding Steve's eyes.
The inventor was pacing up and down in front of the elevator doors, his hair even messier than usual.
Yeah, the genius probably just hadn’t thought of it. So, it would be wrong to look. It would be wrong to turn his head ever so slightly to catch a glimpse of Tony.
After what seemed like hours, Strange was finally done and started to bandage up Tony’s wrist. “No strenuous work for at least two weeks, when you get home put an icepack on it for 30 minutes every four hours. Change the bandage twice a day and if the swelling isn’t gone in two days, I will have to give you anti-inflammatory painkillers, if you like it or not. Understood?”
They ended up in a charming little place just by the beach. The menu offered local specialities, at least they thought so because, they still didn’t actually know where they were exactly. Not that it really mattered. What mattered was watching Steve trying to flirt. Natasha knew that he wasn’t as experienced as most people and the fact that he was literally from a different time didn’t really help. Never would she have anticipated how abysmal his flirting really was.
“Do you want me to help you or not?” It wasn’t like he had an actual choice in that matter. “Three: Talk to him. Keep the conversation light and brief. Four: Start a longer conversation. Like a proper one about something he likes, but again you want to keep it light and breezy. Five: Body language. Don’t cross your arms, have an open stance, turn your body towards him. Six: Compliments. They are always nice and appreciated, but don’t be creepy. And lastly: Keep your interactions brief. Be… mysterious.” She turned her head towards Steve. “You want me to write that down for you soldier?”
He shot her a venomous look. “You wanna play, Romanoff. We’ll play.” And with that he walked over to the nearest person to them. Squaring his shoulders, he cleared his throat. “Uhm, excuse me, but… Uhm that butterfly over there, do you hear it mooing too or is it just me?”
Thor looked a little hurt and embarrassed. “The lady Darcy ensured me it was an important tradition anytime friends gather for sleepovers. I…” Thor hesitated, staring down at his hands in his lap. “I was beginning to wonder why we haven’t upheld the tradition and I wanted to find out if it was because you were unaware of this tradition or… or because you do not consider us friends.”
But it was not fair of him to put this pressure on May. She needed rest and most of all support of those close to her and he’d be damned if he let her down, after all she and Peter had done for him.
Without waiting for a response from Tony, Peter shrugged off his backpack and in doing so managed to knock over two stacks of books that Tony had sat aside for Peter to put away. “Oh shit, sorry Mister Stark. Ah, fuck I forgot no swearing. Damn, I mean… sorry sir.”
On Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays her nephew Peter would come over to Tony’s shop to help with filing and keeping the store in order, earning a few bucks on the side. But more often then not he and Tony would just sit around the desk doing Peter’s homework or tinkering on various little projects.
“Okay, this is ridiculous!” Tony exclaimed. “Are we just going to sit here in silence and ignore the fact that something’s off with Cap?”
Even before the Winter Soldier showed up, Steve was always talking about Bucky. About how he had been his only friend, about how they grew up together, about the brief time they spend together in the army.
“Do you enjoy the lives of the Kardashian clan as well?” Thor asked happily, Bruce nodded ignoring the disbelieving expressions on Tony, Nat and Clint’s faces. Before those three could get a word in edge wise, Thor, Bruce and Steve started talking about the show, who was their favourite Kardashian and how excited they were about the new season.
The archer knew better than to argue with Nat, also they were on a mission tonight and teasing Bruce wasn’t part of it. Maybe he’d take some time to do it tomorrow.
Before Bucky had even the chance to reply, the whole apartment descended into chaos. The windows shattered from armed policemen swinging in, the door started wavering as the men on the other side tried to ram it open, smoke grenades were flying through the air.
And before he knew it, he and Thor met up at least once a week in either one of their rooms to eat popcorn and watch the show together.
“Okay could we stop throwing carbohydrates around and focus on the fact that Steve is… Steve is… he’s…” Tony couldn’t bring himself to say it out loud. If it weren’t for the very strong reactions of everyone around the table, he would have just done it off as one of Thor’s jokes or misunderstandings. But Bruce hasn’t recovered form his almost deadly incident with his breakfast, Clint stopped banging his head against the table, but was still hiding his face in his hands and Natasha still looked like she was about to murder Thor.
Honestly, he shouldn’t have been surprised about that question. Heaven knows, he’s been asking that himself for weeks now.
“You just ate an unholy amount of food. You nearly choked on marshmallows. How can you possibly be still hungry?!” Nat asked with slight disgust.
Tony swallowed hard and looked down at his shoes. The last thing he wanted was to upset May. Or Peter.
What if it works? Oh Steve, could only imagine the life they could have. Waking up in each other’s arms in the morning, Tony grumpy and mostly comatose before his first coffee. He would make him breakfast in bed, would take him on dates whenever he possibly could. Would make him smile every day of his life. Steve knew he could make Tony so happy.
The god picked the first slip and read, grinning. “Never Have I Ever Gone Skinny Dipping! What is skinny dipping?”
Clint finally recovered from his near-death experience and flopped down on the sofa where Thor has finally collapsed onto as well. “I think they had a moment in bed on that boat.”
Of course, Thor acting all sketchy and secretive caught Tony’s attention and he was a little surprised when Thor produced a small plastic shovel, that looked ridiculously tiny in his huge hands and a variety of differently sized buckets. Was he… was he going to build a sandcastle? No one else seemed to have noticed yet, Nat and Clint already swam too far out to see what was going on the beach and Bruce and Steve just went up to the house to get rid of their picknick stuff.
All the information he needed to get his friend back, rested in the palm of his hands and he couldn’t help but grin like an idiot.
The windows were boarded up, barely letting any sun in, giving the whole place a dark and gloomy look. To his left lay a mattress on the floor, a sleeping bag piled on top of it. The sofa was old and badly worn, just like the rest of the furniture.
After cleaning up the mess he had made and restocking some of the shelves, Peter quietly did his homework at the table opposite Tony’s reading armchair, while Tony took care of some customers. Most of the people that visited his shop were regulars, always up for a little chat and looking for recommendations and Tony genuinely enjoyed talking to them. The few passers-by that came in normally just want to browse and be left alone and that was fine by him. But then there were the occasional gawkers. People who wanted to see for themselves that THE Tony Stark, the infamous playboy, weapon developer, the merchant of death, was just a bookshop owner now. Many people couldn’t, or didn’t want to, believe that he gave up his old life for good, thinking that he still developed and invented weapons in his basement. Some even tried to provoke him, get him to break façade, get a reaction out of him, but so far he stayed strong and no matter how much he wanted to insult or beat up someone, he clenched his teeth and didn’t give into his impulses.
Steve rolled his eyes so hard, Tony would be proud of him and put on his sunglasses. He walked over to one of the deck chairs with his book in hand and made himself comfortable.
Tony’s frown deepened, but his voice remained calm. “All I’m saying is that we need a plan. Not just rush into it headfirst.”
There was nowhere to back away to and he couldn’t bring himself to swat away Tony’s hand. The touch, even though born out of pity, still felt good and oh how he craved more.
It took another hour before Tony started to stir and it wasn’t a moment too soon. Steve had gotten more restless by the minute, pacing up and down in the living room of Tony’s penthouse apartment and was about to scribble a note explaining where he was going when a barely audible voice carried over from the bedroom.
It was 5am in the morning when Tony’s alarm went off. He knew that Steve went running every morning at 5.30am. That freak. But Tony wasn’t one to back down from a challenge. He was going to get up and he was going to run with Steve, and he would not die. In five minutes. Just five more minutes.
Tony knew that what Thor needed more than anything else right now, was to feel loved and wanted, so instead of pulling away, Tony wrapped his free arm around the other man, the other one still tugged beneath his head. They stayed like that for a little while longer, Tony drifting in and out of sleep, until someone came walking down the stairs into the small bedroom.
The box did indeed move, which was what finally seemed to wake up Clint. He opened the box carefully and nearly dropped his coffee mug. “OH MY GOD BRUCE!”
Tony narrowed his eyes at Steve. He never backed down from a challenge and he was sure that was someday going to be his downfall. “Fine. Wake me up tomorrow morning and we’ll go.” Steve’s grin widened.
“Oh, no - nothing like that. I’d still like to appreciate winter, but the grime and hustle of the city are kind of ruining it for me.”
It should be impossible. But I should know better, that the impossible is absolutely possible with this crew. And I’m sorry I didn’t speak up sooner. But the thought that something was happening to you, that we almost lost you - that
much I care about you. It’s more than that. I’ve - I’ve had feelings for you for the longest time, Tony,” Steve said nervously.
Steve spent the rest of the day in an anxious blur. Lots of time in the gym trying to punch and run his way to shake off the dream and the weird things that had been happening for the past several weeks. The weird dreams - let alone still not knowing how he ended up outside with cuts and no clothes. The way Tony was both avoiding and watching him. The growing feeling that he
The pair sat there in silence for a moment, a silence that was suddenly broken by movement within the pit. Or more accurately, movement
Steve jumped out of bed, and opened the door to the main living area. Tony was awake, already dressed and quietly sipping coffee at the dining room table.
“ - That sounds great.” Kate finished. They both looked relieved, and Kate continued to speak. “That works for us, Cap. We’ll stay on the ground and you two take a higher position?”
They were laying in bed, Steve long asleep as Tony laid next to him in silence, wide awake staring at the ceiling. At least, Tony thought Steve was asleep.
“Seriously, no hard feelings if you want to ditch us for the night. I mean, stay available, but you guys can go wander campus if you want to,” Steve suggested. Tony knew Steve was doing this to be nice, but it also couldn’t help but sound like Steve was trying to ditch Kate and Teddy too.
Steve looked at Tony, his soft gaze of admiration making Tony’s heart skip a beat. “Okay, Tony,” Steve said, taking a moment to breathe, “I need to know. Do you want to keep going?”
“Yeah, sometimes it seemed like when we were all just hanging around you’d just clam up around me. I know we’re all friends but I just assumed you wanted me at a small distance.”
Steve and Tony both jumped back as the balls began to uncurl and what should have been a pit of plastic balls turned into a pit of chirping beans that looked suspiciously familiar.
Steve said nothing, but walked over to the play place. Tony looked around. The plastic tubes and slides and nets connected in a colorful mix, the largest slide dropping its rider into the big ball pit.
“I was actually hoping we could talk for a moment.” He made a gesture for Tony to join him on the couch and sat back down.
The blue beans looked like Steve in uniform, head wings and all, small shields getting put on their backs. The red ones looked like the Iron Man armor.
Feeling a bit lonely, Steve finally forced himself out of his room to go seek some company. Yeah, most of the team was gone, but someone else had to be in this big tower, right?
On Friday night, Tony and the others met Director Fury in front of the main gate to the campus. Steve had arrived first (of course), and Tony arrived around the same time Kate and Terry showed up. As this was official business, they were all in their gear. Tony flipped down the Iron Man helmet as they all lined up.
Steve and Tony took their perch on the roof of Stark Tower. Tony stepped out of the Iron Man suit and Steve removed the top half of his uniform, placing it and the shield by their armor project.
Suddenly, an alarm chirped out across Stark Tower. Tony and Steve both jumped up and raced to the window. Down near the quad, they could see Clint and Scott tinkering with one of the Stark Robots - Scott playing with the wiring as Clint tried to fit a football into the robot’s right hand.
“Hey, Steve. I wasn’t expecting to see you here tonight,” Tony replied. He seemed a bit off - it wasn’t even a slightly warm reception Steve had been expecting to receive from Tony. But he tried not to read into it too much.
“I’m ready, Tony. I’ve been ready. I’ll be fine, you’ll be fine, and I know you’ve been taking this slow to protect me - don’t deny it - but we’re gonna be okay, and we’re gonna go to a gala together and eat fancy foods and I’m gonna talk your ear off about the works we see and it’s gonna be a great night.” Steve smiled and leaned over to kiss Tony, cupping his cheek with one hand.
Neither had insisted it be kept a secret, but Steve was never usually forthcoming with his personal life anyway, and Tony felt that it be better to just enjoy the relationship for awhile before they had to bear the burden of public opinion. It had nothing to do with shame, and everything to do with pressure. Steve had only been out of the ice for a little over a year by that point, and adjusting to the modern age hadn’t always been easy. As much as Steve could insist that he could handle himself, Tony still wanted to protect him.
Steve looked around. The log walls were broken up with a large glass window that overlooked the lake. A door led to the back porch and yard, where Tony had a fire pit and a hot tub.
“Uh, no. I haven’t been on a date recently or . . . at all, really. Nothing since I got pulled out of the ice,” Steve confessed.
“Alright. I guess we’ve gone on enough sweeps for now that we can split up. Hawkeye, Hulkling, I know you two are friends. I think it’s safe to say you’d rather continue patrol together than spending the rest of night with us, right?” Steve asked.
Tony was uploading footage of the training session as the team packed their gear to go change for dinner. Steve removed his cowl, and put his shield on his back as he walked over to Tony.
Steve softly smiled. “Of course I want you, Tony. I’ve wanted you for a long time now.” Steve leaned down to kiss Tony again, more sweetly this time, and as they began to undress each other the rapid momentum from a few moments prior had shifted into something slower, more tender. Tony didn’t want to scare Steve away. Steve handled Tony with care as if he were afraid Tony would break. The kissing, caressing and prepping shifted into a passionate embrace, Steve whispering Tony’s name over and over as he smoothly thrusted into him, leaving love bites along Tony’s neck.
“You know, if you’re ever up late, you should let me know. I wouldn’t mind going for a nighttime walk like this, and it’s always nice to have some company.”
Across the quad, Tony spotted Steve on his daily run. He zoomed by, Steve’s perfect runner’s stance fading in a blur as he sped past the quad.
“Tony’s a nice guy. You should ask him out.” That would be a frequent thing Steve would hear over the next few months. And he had tried. Twice. Kind of.
Back at the control box, Tony was quickly sorting through security files. “Basic monitoring system, Christ Fury why not just tape camcorders to the outer walls - security logs, software - okay. Let’s see here - alarm systems, bug reports and -” Tony stopped as he pulled up the programming for what should have been the anti-cloaking system. The files pulled up designs and specs for a massive cloaking device, all detailed in the name of AIM.
Steve was complaining that he was a terrible cook. He would try to follow recipes but he needed to get techniques down first. So I told him to watch cooking shows on TV and videos on YouTube. And this has been going on all weekend.”
They hosted a birthday party for Steve at the Tower, taking some time to watch the fireworks celebration from the roof. Steve spent the whole time arms wrapped around Tony from behind, whispering soft words into Tony’s ear as the colorful fireworks rang out over the city.
“Hulkling, Hawkeye, what is your current location?” Steve shouted into the communicator as he finished putting his gear on.
know him. He’s smart and kind and absolutely a giant dork and he’s so damn perfect but he doesn’t brag about it like I would. Being on the same team as him has actually made me a better fighter and strategist and person and he drives me nuts. I’ve dated a lot of people, been in what I thought was love a few times, but
Tony had hoped he had been discreet about the distance he was trying to put between himself and Steve, but Steve had clearly noticed and was hurt by it. He hurt Steve which in turn only caused himself even more pain.
Tony felt his stomach drop and like he was floating away, like someone had just chucked him into outer space.
Steve sunk in his seat slightly. “Dating in the 40’s was different than it is now. And I could barely handle it then!” Steve said with a sigh. “Guys, you know what, I think I’m gonna head out -”
“I love you. I have been in love with you for months and it’s driving me up the wall, I don’t know how to not get flustered around you. And I’ve been so scared because you’re also a really good friend and a teammate and you’re the first guy I’ve had really deep feelings for and that’s scary too and I just - I just didn’t know how to deal with all of that. It scares me and you scare me and I love you so much, and I thought if I tried to distance myself or convince myself you didn’t care then that would make it better but I hurt you instead, and I’m - I’m just so sorry, Steve.”
“It does, Steve. You are 34! I’m 16 years older than you!” Tony ran his hands through his hair, just like Steve did just 15 minutes ago. “Even I think that’s a bit too- You could be my son, god damn it.”
“3%,” Tony says and for a moment he can’t believe that he’s telling Steve that. Confessing just how much he wants to belong somewhere – to something, so much that he is willing to die for it. “Yours was 3%. Mine was 6.”
Breathing, Tony reminded himself. Slowly. Breathing in, breathing out. “I think we should break up.”, he said, his eyes fixed on the ground in front of him.
“If it’s about that girl, I thought we talked about this stuff years ago, I mean we are both grown-ups and-,“ He was bluntly interrupted by Tony.
"You're the most perfect person I know," Tony says lightly, but Steve sees the careful smile and maybe Tony understands, after all. Maybe he gets what Steve's saying.
“Is this about the joke Natasha made a few weeks ago? Tony, you are not that old! Sure, we could both get killed tomorrow, but you are not going to suddenly die of old age, completely out of the blue!”
“I can’t lose you, Tony. I just can’t lose you, I’ve lost everyone who ever meant anything to me, don’t make me lose you too.” Tony wants to start crying again. He can’t decline Steve his wish, not after this kiss, but he can’t promise that.
"Good," Tony says and he sounds relieved and disappointed at the same time. He turns around and reaches for the door and Steve has to stop him because it's not that kind of yes, and he doesn't know how to say it.
Steve knows that, sometimes, he is wrong. It doesn't happen often, but it happens. And when it happens, Steve tries to fix it. That's why, when Tony sits down at the breakfast table one morning, Steve says: "You know I didn't mean what I said on the helicarrier, right?"
“No, I mean if I don’t want kids. Ever. Under any conditions.”, his voice was slightly shaky but he looked at Steve now.
“You promised me,” Steve whispered with a tear-choked voice. “You promised to tell me if it ever got that bad again.”
“Don’t do anything like that ever again.” Tony swallows hard, the weird knot in his throat is back. Steve kissed him. That doesn’t mean that he thinks that Tony is a good person. That Tony is good enough. Loving someone doesn’t magically make your sins disappear, sometimes Tony forgets that. It’s dangerous to forget that stuff, he knows that. That’s what he did the first time, with Pepper and everyone knows how that one ended.
But Steve doesn’t say anything and he doesn’t leave, he just stares at Tony and Tony wants to die. If he dies right now, he doesn’t have to sit through all this awkwardness. Steve is too nice to be an ass, Tony knows that. It’s one of the things that he likes about Steve. But that doesn't mean that it's not going to be super awkward.
"Tony!" Steve shouts and that finally gets Tony's attention. "No one's kicking you off the team. That's not what this is about."
Tony doesn’t know if he is supposed to answer that, but it isn’t a question so he just waits because he doesn’t know what else to do. At some point Steve has to leave, he can’t stay down here forever and even if he tries – Tony has gone far longer than a few days without food and sleep.
“I did. But I am sorry for that and you know that. The Howard I knew was a different person, then the Howard you knew. We’ve been over this a million times. But this is stupid. This whole breaking up thing is stupid. There is no problem that we can’t deal with.”
“I like you a lot actually,” Tony says because he can’t lie when Steve looks at him like that. “Maybe a bit too much,” he adds and looks down at the floor. “But it’s alright I get it. No more sacrifice plays, I promise.” It’s a lie. If it’s going to happen again, and it will happen again, they are Avengers, after all, Tony will do it again. Because it doesn’t matter if Steve wants to be saved or if he hates Tony, if he is so disgusted by the thought of Tony dying for him that, he’d rather just die himself because Steve doesn’t get to decide who loves him. That has always been Tony’s favourite thing about love. Nobody can make you stop loving them. This is his, no one can take it away from him. If he wants to give up everything for Steve then he can and Steve doesn’t have the power to stop him.
“I broke up with you.” The words tasted bitter on Tony’s lips, like lies used to taste, before he became a professional liar.
“Yeah, I got that part.” The Captain buried his face in his hands. “This is like a terrible nightmare.”
“Steve, I’m really sorry to interrupt your-“ He made a vague hand gesture in the woman’s direction. “Whatever this is, but it’s important. And it won’t take long.”
“You can’t stop me from loving you,” Tony says before he can stop himself. “You can do whatever you want, hurt me, leave me, ignore me, shoot me, I don’t care, but you can’t stop me from loving you.”
It's not often that Steve has absolutely no idea what he should say but if anyone manages to render him speechless, it's of course Tony. It’s always Tony. "You're the smartest person I know." He says because it's the only thing he can think of that at least makes some sense.
“Tony!” Steve is now just in front of the sofa but Tony’s eyes aren’t open, so he can’t see him, just feel his presence right in front of him. For a moment he asks himself if Steve will hit him, but it’s a silly thought. Captain America wouldn’t do that, and Steve Rogers wouldn’t either. Because he’s a good person. Someone who deserves to be saved. “Tony, this is not funny, okay! I don’t know why I’m even talking to you - You don’t listen anyways!” He turns around and Tony can hear the door close, but then – suddenly, he is back and he sits down on the sofa opposite, the one that is just there because Bruce has a soft spot for discussing stuff in a 'comfortable atmosphere' and Tony hates sitting too close to people.
"I don't understand," Steve says and he knows his face is one big question mark. "You're saying that - I'm
"-I mean the tower technically belongs to the Avengers, so as long as you don't change the name, that's yours in the divorce. See, you get the house and the kids, I don't think that's a bad deal-"
“You want a reason?” Tony’s nails dug deep into his palms. “Okay, how about the party down there? That’s a great reason if you ask me!”
“I don’t care about statistics, Tony! It was so close, you have no idea! There is no way you are doing something like that again, not for me. I can’t keep you from doing it for anyone else, but you don’t get to sacrifice yourself for me. I’d rather die Tony, I mean it.”
"Just- Imagine someone is better than you at everything you do together. At everything. Always." Tony looks at him expectantly and Steve nods, more a reflex than an actual acknowledgement of Tony's words. "Okay. And- he always expects you to be just as good as himself. And you never are. Just imagine what that feels like."
Tony bit down on his lip until he tasted blood. The metallic taste made it easier not to panic. “What do you want me to say, Steve? Do you want me to apologise? I can do that if it makes this easier for you. But I don’t know what you expect me to do now?”
The silence was uncomfortable and awkward and Tony wished Steve would just let go of his wrist so Tony could lock himself in his workshop and never come out again.
Steve jumped from his chair, grabbed Tony’s wrist and rolled up the sleeve of his jacket. When he couldn’t see a single fresh scar he let out a breath, he didn’t know he was holding.
"You've been avoiding me. I wanted to talk to you." Steve says and it sounds a bit silly now that he says it out loud. Tony and he don't always get to spend a lot of time together. It's normal for them not see each other for a few days when they both have too much to do. Maybe Tony had just been very busy these past few weeks. No reason to call him in and upset him like this, just because
"Yes," Steve says and this time it's the right answer because Tony smiles and he gets tiny wrinkles around his eyes and that shouldn't be as attractive as it is. Bucky had them too and Steve can't even put into words how glad he is that it doesn't hurt to think about that anymore. He's done looking back and maybe this can be his new start.
He leans into Steve’s chest to hide his tears but he knows that Steve had seen them anyways. He doesn’t mock him for it though. For a moment it is quiet and they just lay on the sofa, Tony half on Steve and it should be awkward and uncomfortable and it kind of is but they don’t mind.
"Oh," Tony says and he smiles. "That's okay. We don't have to- We can go slow. There is a nice Italian restaurant, a few blocks from the tower, it's small and private and it wouldn't have to be a big deal. You can hold the door open for me and I'll choose a nice wine and we'll just see how it goes if you want."
Tony moves his head so he doesn’t have to look Steve in the eye anymore and sits down on one of the weird leather sofas he has in the workshop.
Steve looked like Tony just slapped him. “So that’s your excuse? Your age? Age is just a number. You told me that yourself, the first time we had sex. Do you remember?”
Tony stares at him, seemingly completely perplexed and only half awake. He hasn't had his coffee yet, obviously. "What?"
“Tony, if you really can’t even stand the thought of having kids with me, then I’ll just have to deal with that. I’d just like to know why. And don’t say it’s because of your dad. You would be a great father, you know. Much better than Howard.”
“I can’t talk about this right now- You should go back I will just-“, Breathing in, breathing out. Slowly. Calm. “I have to go.”
“We have to talk.”, Tony said as he slowly approached Steve. Even though he tried to sound casual he didn’t quite manage it, his voice just a bit too rushed to seem normal and his eyes to emotionless to seem calm.
“You are going to mess up, Tony! We are both going to mess up, but that’s okay. We’re going to learn from our mistakes and do it better the next time it happens. Everyone messes up at first.”
“So what? You just got tired of me? Realised that I’m boring after all? Four years Tony! And this is all I get?” There were a lot of people looking at them now and Tony shouldn’t have done it here, he knew that now, but he hadn’t expected Steve to react so strongly. He thought it would be easier. He had been so wrong. “We-“, Steve ran his hands through his carefully styled hair. “You know what? No! Not like that, Tony. We are going home now and we are going to sit down and talk about this. There is nothing we can’t fix!” Steve sounded so desperate, so sad and it broke Tony’s, heart. He should have done this weeks ago. But here he was and he fucked up. He fucked up like he always did.
"Yes?" Tony turns back around and he sounds hopeful, just a tiny bit, which means that he gets what Steve's trying to say - which is great, considering Steve isn't really sure what he's trying to say.
"You're not gay, I get it. It's fine, my mistake. I won't let it mess with the whole team dynamics thing-"
"If it's me who's putting too much pressure on you, then you need to talk to me about that, Tony and I'll try to change. But if it's you, then maybe you just need to cut back a bit. Take a break."
Steve didn’t let go of his wrist. “No. You are not just going to leave now. Whatever this is about, I’m sure we can fix it!”
"You said I was a good man. And I'm not. I'm really not, but I'm okay with that, I'm trying to make up for my mistakes and I'm great at what I'm doing at the moment. So, when you say stuff like that, it's like this whole world of possibilities opens up and it's all right in front of me, but still out of reach. It's hard." Tony pauses. "And it hurts." He finally admits.
"Yeah, but on you, it's kind of hot," Tony says and Steve's heart skips a beat. Tony doesn't mean it that way, he knows that Tony flirts like he breathes - constantly and unconsciously. It's still very close to something Steve wants,
"Hey," Tony says as he opens the door to the meeting room. "I'm sorry I'm late guys, but Stark Industries doesn't…" He trails off and for a moment he just stares at Steve, his expression uncertain. Steve does his best to smile encouragingly. He can basically see Tony's face fall, but he only takes one second to collect himself.
"Okay," Tony says slowly and then he looks directly into Steve's eyes for the first time since he entered the room. "Just imagine for a second, that you're not perfect. You're just a regular guy, okay? And now just imagine you're living with someone who is perfect. The pinnacle of human evolution." Tony laughs nervously. "And that person, he expects everyone to be just as perfect as himself. Not consciously, but-" Tony stops. "Okay, you don't get it, do you?"
“Steve, no sane person in this world would give me a child! Not even with you by my side. They wouldn’t even consider it!” Tony was pacing again, up and down in front of the fireplace.
“Then I’ll wait. We’ve still got time, Tony, we don’t have to decide today, we can still-“, Tony interrupted him.
“I know,” Steve says and the next part is the funny part because Steve smiles and it’s a nice smile, the kind that stays in your eyes, even after your lips stopped smiling. “I just wanted to see how sure you are.” And then - he kisses Tony.
Steve laughed, but it was nothing joyful about it. “I want a reason, Tony! You can’t just break up with me after four years and expect me to just nod and go on with my life! This is not fast food that you just throw away if you don’t like it anymore! This is a relationship! We are supposed to talk about stuff and not just break up over little things. So excuse the fact that I want just one goddam reason if you have suddenly decided to leave me!”
“It’s not that.” Tony wanted to get up and hide in his lab or at least pace around in the living room, but he knew he would just make it worse. “It’s the thing Clint said. About kids.”
“I’d still throw myself on a grenade for you,” Tony whispers into the shirt. “You wouldn’t be able to stop me.”
“But you want kids! The way you look at them like they are a little miracle, sent from heaven with their tiny hands and careless smiles, you want that too!” Tony got up from the chair and started pacing around in the living room, even though he knew it would drive Steve crazy. “And I can’t give you that! I’m not a woman and even if I’d be one, I’d be too old.”
“Then we’ll fix it. We can get you another therapist. A better one. And it’s not that bad, Tony, you are doing much better than you think. Hell, you don’t even drink anymore! You haven’t in months! You don’t smoke and your nightmares are getting better.”
All eyes were on them as they walked up to the elevator and Tony could still feel Natasha’s death glare on him, even when the doors were already closed.
"Oh- Yeah, okay. Sorry." Why is Tony apologising? Steve is pretty sure that Tony isn't the one who's sending mixed signals here.
Steve's doesn’t know what to say to that. They aren't best friends, Tony and him, not really anyway, and Tony has many, many times, proclaimed how little he trusts Steve. And still, here he is, pouring out his soul to Steve. Laying it bare, open, for Steve to do as he wishes. Just months ago, Steve's first thought would have been about using this information, this trust, to better control Tony, but now all he can think about is, that Tony doesn't think he's a good person and it's Steve's fault too.
"It's not that." Tony looks frustrated. "It's not work or Avengers business, it's just that-" He takes a deep breath like he's bracing himself for what's to come. "You remember when you apologised for the helicarrier thing?"
"I'm bisexual," Steve repeats. He googled that and he's quite proud of figuring it out on his own. Not that he hadn't known back in the 40's, there were only so many boners you could get in inappropriate situations before you figure that stuff out, but now he had a word for it other than
“But why, Tony? You don’t even like me,” Steve says and Tony opens his eyes and it is a mistake because Steve just looks lost and hurt and Tony would do everything to just never have to see that look on Steve again.
That hurt. But it was the truth after all, wasn’t it? You are worth so little, I’d rather die than be saved by you. How much do you have to hate someone to feel like that?
“Steve, do you remember what happened the last time I had a panic attack? Just imagine all that with a kid! This isn't save for a kid. Hell, this isn’t even save for you.”
"Shit," Tony says when Steve doesn't react. "I'm sorry- I thought, maybe…" He trails off and Steve can see his hands clenching nervously, and he's actually nervous,
"Yes," Steve says because apparently his vocabulary is now limited to one-syllable words and incoherent babbling. He can't think when Tony is looking at him like that.
“I know you hate me, Tony. You’ve made that pretty clear. But still, I mean - why would you do that? How much higher was the chance for you to live? 10%?” He has stopped the shouting and he sounds different now, a bit broken, the way Tony usually sounds when he talks about his past, or alcohol or Howard, or Steve or - well, a lot of things.
“A bit, yes. But it’s okay. I’ve done that too.” Steve said. “Want to go to bed? It got a bit late.”
"On the helicarrier, when I said the stuff about you and the suit, back when we met," Steve says. "I didn't mean any of it. You're a good man and it wasn't right for me to say anything at all because I didn't know you back then. I know that you know that, I just wanted to have said it."
The rest of the day went by in a haze. Steve and Tony spend most of it out on the sun deck in each other’s arms, whispering sweet nothings, enjoying the touch of the other. Natasha and Clint didn’t emerge from their rooms until dinner.
“Now Tony-“ Before Hammer could finish whatever phony thing he was about to say, Peter came in with his backpack in hand.
“Because I’m scared. I’m scared of what happens if he doesn’t feel the same and I’m scared of what happens if he does.”
Now the question was, was Tony a tactical problem or someone who reminded Steve of his past. If Tony was honest with himself, which he never was because it was on his not-to-do-list, he knew exactly why Steve looked at him like he did and who he most likely reminded Steve of. With the slight difference that Tony wasn’t a hot British chick. As far as Tony knew, Peggy had been the only person Steve was ever really interested in. Just that one
After everyone had left the house, Tony changed into his swimming trunks and made himself comfortable in one of the deck chairs. Clint joined him a few moments later.
In the hospital they performed an CT scan to check for a concussion and found a brain tumour instead.
“Because we didn’t look.” Bruce supplied helpfully. A few seconds later a small twig made contact with Bruce’s head.
Steve was very lucky to have a friend like her by his side. They both weren’t big talkers and her strength and composure gave Steve something he could relate to. When he first woke up from the ice, it was her who anchored him, who made him feel like there was a place for him in this world. It was also Nat who first dragged him out of the SHIELD compound to go and explore the new New York and in turn he showed her all his favourite spots from back in the day, at least the ones that still existed. He could honestly say that he loved Natasha. Not in a romantic or sexual way, but in a way that the Greeks called “Philia”, a deep and affectionate love that connected two people beyond physical attraction. He knew he could always count on her and vice versa.
“It’s only bad when you do it alone.” Tony looked at the others. “Awe come on guys, don’t leave me hanging.”
“I could cook something. If we have enough food left.” Bruce offered, already getting up to go check the fridge.
And honestly who could blame him? Just looking at the man made him feel all warm and fuzzy. His beautiful hair, that looked so soft, sometimes Steve had to physically stop himself from running a hand through it. His beard, so meticulously neat, all Steve could think about was if it would tickle when they were kissing. The way his brows were furrowed when he was tinkering on his inventions for hours and hours, Steve wished he could just pull him away from the workbench and massage the tension from his muscles. The way his whole face lit up when he was smiling not that fake smile he puts up for the press, but the real thing, that made Steve forget all the bad things in the world. Tony’s stunning brow eyes, so often hidden behind tanned sunglasses, always darting around, barely resting on anything for more than a second, oh but when the glasses were gone and he locked eyes with Steve, all he could see was warmth.
At lunchtime everyone found themselves back at the house. Natasha looked deeply relaxed from her morning at the beach. She made herself comfortable in one of the deck chairs next to Clint, who had just woken up from a little nap. He gave Nat a drowsy smile and a wink and to Tony’s surprise instead of rolling her eyes she returned his smile.
“I-I noticed that you were looking for him and… well the other night I couldn’t sleep and I got curious and since Nat made all of S.H.I.E.L.D.s files public and with the help of J.A.R.V.I.S. it wasn’t too hard to find a trace of him.” What Tony didn’t tell him was that it was actually more than just one sleepless night he had spend digging through old files, following cold and false trails, until two weeks ago he finally digged Bucky up in Bucharest.
After about 45 minutes Steve finally had mercy on Tony and slowed down. Tony was panting heavily, fighting for air. Steve turned around to check on him and couldn’t help himself but smile at the man in front of him. Tony’s hair was plastered against his moist forehead, his chest rapidly moving up and down, trying to get air into his lungs. “Alive?”
Doctor Strange was the absolute best in his field, which is why Pepper hired him to treat May, but the man was as talented as he was arrogant. He had a constant air of superiority around him, constantly rolled his eyes and flirted with everyone who couldn’t hide quick enough. Pepper said he reminded her of Tony when he was younger.
So, instead of going over to Tony, instead of apologizing or at least talking to him before they left, Steve barked at Natasha: “Romanoff, time to go,” and boarded the quinjet without looking back. He didn’t see Tony’s hurt expression, didn’t see Bruce putting a hand on his friend’s shoulder, didn’t see Tony storming down to his workshop. What he saw was the mission ahead of him, getting Bucky back home.
Justin Hammer laughed his slimy little laugh, wiggling a finger at Tony. “Ah I see you haven’t changed at all Tony.”
Clint and Bruce started chuckling, while Steve and Thor just looked very confused. “I do not understand that reference.” Thor looked at Natasha for help.
I will be taking off for a month but if you have any fic ideas, be it for longer stuff or just drables, just pop them in the comments and I will try to write something for you!
“Thanks for the sentiment Clint.” Tony mumbled, still grumpy, as he unwrapped the gift. It was a pack of Clint’s secret coffee. They had been living together in the tower for a little over two years now and not once did Clint share a single drop of his coffee, no matter how much they begged, pressed or tried to trick him. So, this was definitely a big deal.
Steve stepped out of the shower, rubbing his hair dry with an impossibly fluffy towel, a second one wrapped around his waist. He took a look in the mirror to check the cut on his lip from the battle. Thanks to the serum it was almost completely healed and usually he would be pleased about it, but it upset Steve that the rest of the team wasn’t as lucky as him. They didn’t have some super serum in their blood to heal them, so it was his job to keep them safe.
Tony was still only wearing his swimming trunks and the bikini apron, yet it was far too much. Steve made quick work with the ribbon on the back and was just about lift the neckholder over Tony’s head when someone knocked on the door of the closet they were locked in. Seconds later a second sheet of paper slid in from under the door.
"So, we could, you know, get dinner. If you wanted." Tony sounds nervous too and Steve wants to say yes so badly.
For a moment the world seemed to stop. “What?” Steve’s voice sounded way too high like he just got punched in the guts, his eyes wide with shock.
"- like realistically speaking. You also get to keep all the gear and the jet, you just have to be careful not to break it, because I'm a very busy person and sadly I'll have more important things to do than clean up your-"
When Steve hands him hands him the plate with the pancakes he takes it though and actually eats some, so Steve counts the mission a success, even though neither of them talks for the remainder of their shared breakfast.
Tony blushes, not just a bit, but his face actually goes pink. Steve has never seen Tony blush before. It looks good on him. "What?"
“I –“, began Steve, but was bluntly interrupted by a pretty woman that asked for a dance. God, Tony hated his birthday. Why did he even bother to give a party when everyone was just flirting with his boyfriend? “Tony you’ve got pretty bad timing. Let me just-“ He tried to politely decline the woman’s offer and she looked like she was about to start crying. She couldn’t be older than 20, but Tony couldn’t bring himself to feel sorry for her.
Everything is okay afterwards, for a while. Nothing big happens, there are no attacks, no mandatory team meetings and Steve spends a lot of time at SHIELD or on missions, which is probably the reason it takes him so long to notice that Tony is avoiding him.
"You're a good man," Steve says and he doesn't sound nearly as calm as he would like. "You're a hero, you put your life on the line to help others. Your mistakes don't define you, Tony. Nobody is perfect, not you, not Natasha, not Thor and definitely not me, but we all try and we do our best and that's what makes us good people. Not that we've only ever done good, but that we try to make up for the bad." He needs Tony to understand. A part of Steve, the very primal and unreasonable part of him, just wants to shout at Tony and shake him until Tony understands that he's a good person, he's one of the best people Steve's ever known and
“Yeah, right. Because who wouldn't want a 50-year-old with PTSD that he has no right to have, an anxiety disorder that he can't cope with and a soon-to-be-deadly drinking problem! It's getting worse, Steve! I can't eat, I can't sleep and I sure as hell can’t talk about it. Not to you, not to Rhodey, not even with Pepper! I am broken, Steve. And it’s getting out of hand."
“No, I mean, I would like that. A lot.” He backpedaled slightly. “But I don’t know how many chances I’ll get at this and I-” Now he was blushing bright red and Tony couldn’t help but to think he looked adorable. Steve took a breath to settle himself, it didn’t really work but he pressed on. “I want to feel you.” He whispered finally as he looked down at the sheets.
