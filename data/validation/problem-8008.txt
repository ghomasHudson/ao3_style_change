That was the worst part about Hell: it was
Steve felt every one of his twenty-six years, looking upon a group of young Amish men jesting with Tony Stark over his distinctive facial hair, comparing it to their longer beards.  Tony stood comfortably with them, no mask, no cover, just a guy eating a homemade peanut butter and jelly sandwich, explaining between bites that he kept his beard trimmed to remain unmarried forever.  The men around him laughed.
spiel, fixating instead on the faraway look on Stovok’s face.  He had often seen the Commander of the U.S.S.
“Cap’s on my team,” Tony said at once.
A knock came on the door, somehow familiar and unfamiliar.  With great effort, he rose to meet it, leaving his cane behind.
He startled when a small, warm, soft-bodied dragon slipped under his arm.  Green Thallium peered up at him, perfectly innocent, her small sharp claws perched on his belly.  In adulthood, she would be able to rip him open, yet even as he very slowly brought his arms around her, hugging her, she let him, ducking under his chin, feeding off his warmth.

Steve looked at the clock on the wall.  Although he did not startle, his belated reply gave away his surprise: “. . . Guess I got caught up.”  He glanced at Tony.
at the hotel.
“Quite all right, Commander.”
“Mr. Stark’s alive, oh my God.”
“. . . Love you, too.”  A beat: “Happy birthday, Steve.”
He helped Steve find a clean cloth, letting Steve apply pressure to the severed artery, head pounding in panic.  He pressed the panic button his wristlet, hoping to God Happy was awake, before telling J.A.R.V.I.S. to call an ambulance.
It gave Tony chills to read accounts from those who had lost their dragons.  It happened routinely, since dragons came and went in the lives of humans at their choosing.  They were not bound to humans, and so, all too often, a human companion awoke to find their seemingly lifelong companion had vanished for good.  The grief was terrible.
“I have a mission report to file, you have rest to recover,” Stovok said, but the bright green flush on his cheeks gave away his real affect away.
. o .
“I’ve never had a cat,” Steve admitted, deciding honesty was faster than self-preservation.  “Now I do.  What do I need to keep this alive?”  He held up the Rico bundle explanatorily.
“Well, now you’ve done it,” Tony told him, unwrapping a burger with shaking hands, excited and scared because oh, God, it had been

, and
Rico was often underfoot, diminutive and quick, lightning out of the bottle.  Rico took pleasure in destroying things and got into everything he was not supposed to, prompting Steve to think one step ahead of his conniving cat brain.  Rico also loved to watch Steve cook, even though Steve’s best dish were his sandwiches.  Rico seemed to love hot objects, whether it was warm fireplaces or stovetops, creating perennial dread for Steve as he leaped to be one step ahead of his cat, who would fling himself less hazardously onto a pile of fresh laundry.
Tony winced at the proffered hand.  “I don’t—do, handshakes,” he huffed, as Thor pulled him into a firm embrace.  “Okay.  Okay.  Thank you,” he wheezed.  Thor released him.  He staggered back.  Steve steadied him with a hand on his back, but Tony waved a hand, moving back to the car.
Steve grimaced.  “I’d rather not talk about it.”

They sat down near but not next to the others.  Ignoring Captain Carter’s admonition not to eat or drink anything, Tony sampled the cornucopia of food and beverage laid out in front of him, chewing on a handful of grapes while Romanova put out feelers regarding the mission, asking Anij, “How long have your people settled this land?”

“She is right,” Stovok said calmly.  “It is not worth the risk to lose—”
“We are representatives of a peacekeeping organization,” Stovok danced, refusing to give away too much.
“It is,” Stovok said.
“How nice to be mourned,” Tony wheezed.
Limping over to his dragon, Tony looked him in the huge black eye and tried to convey,
“Hm?” Tony asked without looking up.  Rather than repeating himself, Steve waited him out.  Tony finally said, “Oh.  Mapping.”
“It’s not
The noise immediately quieted.  The hand curled around his squeezed.  Tony swallowed down sudden emotion.  Steve was here.  Steve was here.
“Hullo,” Steve greeted the pet store clerk, holding a rain-soaked Rico under one arm and an empty cardboard box in the other.  “Do you sell cat litter?”
Easter eggs:
“No,” Tony grunted, resisting the weight pushing down on his shoulders.  Terrible, terrible person.  She had drugged him.  She must have.  With her . . . horrible, mind control, powers.  That was it.  “Him.  Talk.  One minute.”
, he decided, slightly nervous he might actually pass out before Steve returned, heart still beating too fast.
Steve rolled his eyes, then dumped Lucky on the ground.  Lucky landed on his feet and bolted for Iron Man, who shot back into the air.  “Not a fan of dogs?”
“He tried,” Steve defended.  “Tried to tell me.  I—”
“Go—”  Struggling to back up at all with the string of Nibirans behind him, Tony said, “We need Bruce, we are

“We can dance all day, Sojef,” Anij replied.  “I would rather dance and drink, if it is all the same to you.”
“That makes sense,” Tony said, nodding once.  Then he frowned.  “You went to—”
“Would you step away please,” ordered the bear.
.  When Tony had given him a look like Steve had been off his rocker, Steve had explained,
Crossing the rocks, he stood beside Clint.  It was strange to Steve, to stand, not alone on the inside, burnt badly by his own grief, but on the outside of somebody else’s, a grief that had grown over, covered by years of new memories, overgrowth that could not be trimmed by the scythe of time.

“No, it’s
A loud knock came on the door.  Steve looked over at Natasha, who looked back at him expectantly, cradling her own mug of coffee.  The knocking continued.
“Old-fashioned,” Steve drawled.
“Is it still chivalry if it’s from a woman?” Steve asked, offering Tony the box.
, he’d rather fuckin’ die than go in the hole.  Not happening.
“You’re lucky Thor was there,” Dr. Banner grumbled.  “Or you’d be dead meat.”
“The heat is misleading,” he warned.  “Do not overexert yourself.”
Shaking his head, Steve snapped the newspaper open and huffed, “Million-dollar-question.”
or not?”  Cap Bird glared at him, unrelenting, soulless, vibrantly colorful.  “You said it, not me.”
“Well,” J.A.R.V.I.S. began mildly, standing about six feet back from Steve, who was deep-cleaning the self-cleaning oven, for some godforsaken reason.
“Aye,” Thor said.  “I have—”
“Nope,” Tony said, looking around a bit.  “Uh.  Are you—you’re hugging me.”
“You’d think the whole ‘killer Bird Flu’ would be more concerning,” Steve replied, sitting in Tony’s favorite bean bag and crunching down on chocolate chip cookies.
Steve looked down at Natasha, then folded himself onto the porch next to her.  She smelled good, like lilacs.  He smelled like dirt.  Self-consciously, he nodded at the cabin: “Think I’m under siege.”
"Well, almost." Steve was struggling to breathe and Tony was too close. "We're still catching up. As I said, each line needs to be done many times so...yeah. Almost done though. I'm about to 2019."
“Because she is terrifying.”
“Just,” his tablet rang with a message and something started to flash on his screen. “Just get back to work. I’ll fill you in later. And you better not have rice over the expensive merchandize.”
That expression…there was so much to it. So much pain and heaviness.
What an interesting woman.
“Ah, organs and such.” Steve acknowledged calmly. “That could be painful.”
It looked like Steve wanted to ask more but kept quiet instead.
Steve, who was lost as to what exactly they were talking about, turned to look at the woman, “Hey, Natasha?”
It was fire and ice and light and darkness and burning, burning, burning. It was like he was aware of every single cell in himself and could feel something latch on to them. They boiled and shuddered, coiling and spiking, as every part of him trembled under whatever was being pumped into his system.
“Bore…
“Guess I may need to see about using this other side.” Steve said, taking a peek at his more empty side.
“Not Barnes though.” Tony suddenly snapped. “Not that fucking bastard that took you from me. He can suffer…rot in an endless hell for eternity.”
"Could not be my heir. I could see it. That fire in his eyes...no, he was good but not the cut desired for this role."
“T-Tony,” He gasped.
Steve just rolled his eyes and went back to sipping his beer. It was really good. He had better in France, but they were known for some good drinks and he was a soldier at the time so any food or drink was amazing when he had access to it. The food, pizza, was really good. He already had seven slices (Thor was at thirteen and Clint at ten, though he looked like he was about to puke from it) and was ready for more.
Steve goes to the room Tony had so courteously provided for him, toweling off his corn-silk hair and tossing the towel over a nearby chair. He pulls on some fresh clothes and when he turns around, he sees a fancy black box sitting on his bed.
Tony wants to get every delicious bit of butter and corn from Steve's ass, thrusting his tongue in hard and licking him thoroughly. Steve can hardly take it, his movements becoming more erratic as the fire in the pit of his own belly continues to rise. The cobs that had stretched his ass, Stark's tongue pressing against every aching bit-
Tony took the cob from Steve's mouth as he whines, desperate for something to fill his mouth again. Tony rubs it against Steve's desperately stiff cock, already dripping with precum, before lubing it up too. He pulls the thicker corn out just a touch, enough to make the double penetration more even.
“Me? Nah. Just a little. Navigational error.” Tony was looking Steve over again, undressing him with his eyes. The Captain licked his lips, his casual dress left little to the imagination and hid absolutely nothing. He tried to turn away but Tony's hand on his shoulder stopped him. A little shiver ran down his spine as his khakis became a little tighter.
He is walking towards the extravagant bathrooms when Hulk calls out to him: “Hey Steve! Want some?”
“Tony...” There's a flush creeping up in Steve's cheeks. He had tried to deny his insatiable attraction to the playboy billionaire, the things they had done together. But he couldn't, no matter how hard he tried.
Stark pulls his cock back and Steve whimpers, pleading for more. Tony wasn't surprised that Steve already forgot what he had said before – he was
“You're making me hungry.” Tony growls. Steve looked so good taking the corn at both ends, Tony unbuttoned his pants and pulled out his own cock, stroking himself with butter-flavored fingers as he seated the cob inside the Captain. Steve's ass looked ready for so much more.
“I’ll make you some creamed corn later, Steve.” Tony offers with a lewd grin. Steve wished, desperately, that he was in a condition to glare. Hulk was
Steve is still sore when he rides the elevator up to the pent house in the Stark Tower. Every bump in the road served as a reminder of his time in the fields with Tony. He intends to take a shower when he reaches the top, and maybe have a nap after. His face flushes when he thinks of how the corn felt, rubbing against his insides as Tony worked in his mouth.
Tony examines the second cob, perfectly tapered and thick in all the right places. Lucky for Steve he had made a butter flavored lube perfect for this kind of occasion. He slicks the corn up with it now until it's glistening with perfection, pulling Steve's hips back until his ass is in the air and his cheeks parted just so.
After pulling on his shirt, Steve walks over to the bed, picking up the box and easing himself down on the bed. No note, also typical Stark. Steve sets the box in his lap and pulls off the lid.
When the Captain looks back, Tony smirks, “needed a little salt.”
At last Tony grasps him by the hips, bending him over and petting a hand over the cotton-clad ass. Suddenly it's torn away, Steve gasping as his ass quivers from the force. Tony pushes him down, but gently, until Steve is on his hands and knees. He strips the second cob, laying it's green leaves aside as he puts yellow kerneled cob in the Captain's mouth. Steve moans around it, desperate.
Steve turns to look and sees Hulk at the long table with a lounging Tony, a platter of freshly buttered corn in front of them. Tony smirks at him again, licking a drip of butter off his thick cob.
Stark kneads at Steve's plump ass, pulling his cheeks apart as he leans down and tongues around his hole. Steve's moans are loud and throaty, his whole body trembling and slicked with sweat. Tony circles his entrance with his tongue again before pushing it inside, the Captain's sweet buttered corn ass taking his tongue readily. Steve rocks back on Stark's tongue, fucking himself on it, the Captain's own untouched cock bouncing slightly against his lower belly.

, Steve thought, breathing slowly, half-open eyes drinking it in as Dorothy sang:
All was well.
Clint, who had insisted on bringing up the rear for surveillance, shouted back, “We brought Smokey!”
Steve, who had been autopiloting the last five hours, forgot to brace for impact and went down hard.
, before he shook his head and said, “Just don’t do anything to it.”
6:26 P.M.
To his surprise, Tony followed.  “Give a guy a break,” he huffed, but Steve maintained his strive, moving towards a cornfield.
Thor just said peaceably, “I like this place.  It suits me.”
There was something approachable about him, making it easy for Steve to approach him, clasp him on the shoulder, and wordlessly remind him that they could not stay forever in Amish country.
Tony presses the corn into Steve, slow, watching how his tight, hungry ass takes the ribbed cob. Lube drips down, making Steve's corn-silk pubes glisten between his thighs, the land of plenty. Steve moans around the one in his mouth, muffled by it. Tony presses the corn in deeper before pulling it back, fucking him with it and making Steve tremble with low and desperate sounds. The Captain is rocking back, trying to take more of the thick cob in his tight ass.
Stark keeps tongue fucking him, licking around the rim of his ass. Steve whimpers desperately until Tony pulls back, taking his own thick, spit-slicked cock in his hand and jacking himself until he came on Steve's ass.
“Yeah?” Hulk grunts, picking up another richly buttered cob to chomp on as Steve blushes and squirms where he stands.
Steve reaches up, pulling a husked cob off one trembling stalk.
Steve is undressed as quick as Tony undressed the cob of fresh corn, his civilian garb scattered across the black clods of dirt between the rows, his khakis ripped, his tight white underwear struggling against his erection. Steve's pale skin was flushed with arousal yet Tony makes him wait even longer, taking his time stepping out of his mechanical suit.
“Why don't you pick some corn?” Tony's mouth is by Steve's ear, one metal clad hand creeping down his back. “It looks nice and
“Tony-!” Steve cries out as his cums shoots from his cock and onto the earth. More food for the corn, so it could grow tall and thick.
Tony could feel that familiar heat building up in the pit of his stomach, Steve on his knees taking double cobs and his cock was hard to resist. It was such a perfect position for Captain America, on display for all the corn to see, those big blue eyes hazed with lust and his lips swollen from sucking.
Steve paused, an amused little smile pulling at the corner of his full lips. As if on cue, Tony Stark stumbled out from one row and into Steve’s. The playboy cleared his throat, brushing cornsilk from the shoulder off his suit, the sudden shift to corny swagger close to flawless.
He turns red, instantly, the sudden arousal that comes with it is almost unbearable.
“There might be a kernel of truth in that.” Steve admits, reaching out and pulling off another cob. Tony plucks it out of his hand, pulling back the fresh green leaves. He rubs his thumb over the firm yellow nubs as his hand slips into the back of Steve's pants, fondling at his ass. Steve moans, helpless not to as he pushes his country ass back into Tony's hand.
It wasn't fresh from the field, but it wasn't a bad substitute.
“I could ask you the same thing.” Steve replied, closing the distance between them and brushing a clod of dirt off Tony’s shoulder. “Looks like you had a hard landing. Again.”
.  ‘Up at dawn’ was one of them.  “No,” Steve said aloud, pulling open the curtain, letting in the early morning light.  “Look.  It’s a nice day.”
Some places, Tony said, were seeing record shortages on salmon; others had more than they knew how to eat.  It was the story of the new world: a patchwork place, a place of famine and fullness, of “salmon and shortage.”  Steve thought about crossing out the original simplified note in his journal, then drew a line to the bottom of the page and wrote,

“And the rest of the crew?” Dr. Banner husked.  Tony shared Dr. Banner’s shock, but he could not bring himself to believe that they were the only survivors.  The

.  “I can’t stay long,” Steve warned.
“You’re an idiot,” Natasha said, approaching him.  “And you’re worth more dead than alive.”
Steve recognized his own bike and could easily match Tony’s tire tread, but the third car stood out.  “Romanoff?” he guessed.
“No,” Steve said obstinately.  “I meant—”
.  Among the chaos.  This is chaos theory in motion.  Add just one more,” he indicated a Gorn approaching with claws upraised, stomping menacingly, “and the entropy multiplies.”  As proof, another Gorn backed up, knocked over the newcomer, and both tripped.  “That could have been the turning point of the game.”
“I am a role model to all my nieces,” Clint told him proudly.  “And I could kick your ass, any day of the week.”
Steve refused to take the bait.
Shaking his head at himself, he thumbed over his shoulder, “Can I go?  I haven’t had a nap in
“He disapproves,” Thor translated loudly.
“Soft, too,” Tony said, smoothing down the blades under a hand.  Stovok looked at him, his expression rebuking, almost distressed, before Tony lifted his hand and the grass slowly rebounded.  Then Stovok relaxed, mirroring the movement, far more carefully, still using the back of his hand.
“Here’s your bear,” Bruce piped in, nearly dwarfed by the large, carnival-style, sadly-singed teddy bear, passing it off to Thor, who embraced it and him in a single arm.

Tony said, “Don’t have one.”
He almost felt it.
For a wild moment, Tony still thought he might tear off his entire arm to relieve the suffering.

Having forgotten entirely about the original wager, Steve reached into his pocket, pulled out the slightly crumpled but otherwise unharmed blue lollipop, and examined it thoughtfully for a moment.
“S’all right,” Steve interrupted.  “I’d like to know, but there’s lots of things I’d like, you know?”  He smiled ruefully, then looked at Tony, expression softening.  “I got her and I got you.  That’s what matters.”

“Mm-hm.”  Steve heard him move before he felt the kiss on the back of his head.  “Go back to sleep.”

, like he really was ninety-years-old.  “They’ll eat just about anything you put in their hands.”
Nope.
Steve sighed, “Not every day, Tony,” but took a bite and nearly fell over at the strong taste of molasses.  He closed his eyes and frowned, chewing slowly, savoring it.  It was like something right outta Ma’s kitchen.  It was the homiest thing he had ever felt, since her death, seven—so many years ago.
—Steve purposefully lowered his shield to his side, almost hanging off his arm.
“Lookout for what?” Steve asked.
“Aye?  You have more suitable accommodations prepared?” Thor asked, with enough hopefulness Steve felt like a jerk for replying:
, at what
He waited, half-expecting Stovok to drag him to the garbage chute and dispose of him.  But Stovok merely frowned at him, looking genuinely confused, and said with real affront, “Why did you lick me?”
Tony boggled.  Stovok’s expression did not change a shade.  “Six

“Probably a no,” Natasha said.  She made no move to get up.
Sitting on a bench outside a rural gas station, Thor looked up from a pamphlet labeled
that everyone would forget about him amid the fanfare and jubilee.  It was a victory he no longer wanted; he wanted to go home so badly it hurt, like a broken tooth.  He would gladly take up a pair of pliers and fix the problem on his own, were-it-only-so-simple.
“I’m in stitches,” Steve deadpanned.
—before he curved his arm around Tony’s back and exhaled against Tony’s shoulder.
Steve thought about offering up an explanation—
Shaking his head, Tony said, “It’s a debris field.  Completely devoid of life.  Nothing to teleport
Grumbling inaudibly, Tony grabbed a carton of two-percent milk from the fridge and took a direct swig.  Why?  Because he
Thor frowned.  “Why else would they be on the cake?”
, this is—”
Bruce just made a small noise.  Tony squeezed his shoulder.
“Shouldn’t be too hard,” Steve drawled, following him out of the observatory.  “Since it didn’t happen.”
Tony reached under the table and produced a box labeled,
“Auðumbla,” Thor said cheerfully, “the frozen cow, who fed Ymir with the milk which flowed from—”
, “you’re wrong.”
. o .
he thought, knocking lightly on the bathroom door.
“What?”
Stovok simply lied down on the floor next to his bed, looking up at the ceiling with him, scanning the blue map.  “Stovok?” Tony prompted, after a sufficient period of silence had passed, whereby Stovok could absorb every iota of data on screen.
“Most probably a protective layer to shield from direct exposure ultraviolet radiation,” Stovok theorized.  “A fascinating adaptation.”
Weirdly enough, he did not blame the dragon.  He blamed himself, for making a suit that could not handle the impact and venturing into dragon territory.  If tame dragons could accidentally hospitalize their companions, what feral ones could do to humans they saw as prey was beyond contemplating.  And that was all he was, that was as far as the adversity went:
“Okay.”  Steve nodded upwards.  “Out’s that way.”
“No fucking way,” Clint responded.  “Gotta be an entire
With a very soft grunt, Steve released his own arm.  Tony went to work quickly rebinding it.  “Pain in my ass, you know that?” he muttered, tightening it up.  Steve immediately tried to undo it, and Tony caught his hand.  “
Tony slid a shot glass in front of him.  “Try this.”
Next up: field trip! Where to? Stay tuned!
He blamed Gravemarker for it all—the dragon in the woods, the painstaking PT, the distance from Steve.
“This is quite good,” Thor agreed, tapping the phone.  “I should like to keep this one.”
Steve Rogers paused audibly, not breathing or speaking, before resuming both: “I just want to make sure you’re okay,” he said softly.
.  Another part of him was sick: sick of being
“Starts with a B.”
“Suit yourself, chief.  They’re best fresh.  Kind of like. . . .”  Clint frowned, then admitted, “Man, I’m really off my game today.  I got nothing.”  He cracked open a Pepsi can, then toasted Steve with it.  “Cheers.”
“It’s—probably fine,” Tony said, slowly pocketing his telephone.
He was already home free—one hand on the threshold.  Tony flicked off the lights, hoping to send a message.
suddenly piped in from the center of the table.  “Oh, I love this one,” Bruce said earnestly, as Tony set his phone down and rolled his eyes.  Bruce resumed cutting the cake—
They walked on.
The Nibirans stared.  “Friendly,” he said, despite appearances, desperate appearances.  “We come in peace.”
It was exactly what he would have told a soldier balking on the trail, he realized, too forlorn to be horrified.
Natasha just said, “You turned the world’s biggest children loose in the world’s biggest sandbox.”  Then she smiled at them, with a sort of cocked-head sweetness.  “You really think they’re coming back?”
At last, the doors opened.  “Please exit,” the disembodied voice stated.
“I don’t—care.”
Steve inhaled deeply, filling his lungs.  “This can’t happen again,” he said.
“I had a brother,” Clint said at last, working the line, back to Steve, facing the empty world.  “Name was Barney.  Like the dinosaur.  You don’t know the fucking dinosaur.”  He did not laugh.  “Real name was Charles.  Charles Bernard Barton.  Barney was. . . .”  Clint paused.  With a deep breath, he said, “I had a family, but the only good one was Barney.”
“Deep within the frosts of Nilfheim, Ymir slept,” Thor was saying, bedecked fittingly in furs.  “Yet as the fires of Muspelheim warmed him, condensation formed from his sweat, and the first life of this world emerged,” Thor said, tracing a hand along the dripping walls, forming puddles at his feet.
.  The young purple dragon blinked back at the camera, her flat look matching Bruce’s.  For a long moment, Tony feared that Bruce would assume it was a terrible joke, sending him another dragon.
Steve said, “Well, if you want it done, do it yourself.”
“Is there anything
Space.
Snow hunted weekly, but Steve fed the hatchlings from the meat locker daily, occasionally driving out to a butcher shop to restock.  Snow preferred her meals hot-blooded and squealing, but Marker, who had grown up in a more refined environment, enjoyed his meat frozen, occasionally raiding the meat locker for a snack.  Captain Fearless scolded the gold dragon fearlessly for his transgressions, but he could do little more than inflect a stern voice to deter the brute from his spoils.
“A likely compensation, given their blunt claws and rubbery skin,” Stovok replied.
“We shake on that?”
They never did.  Yet they insisted on putting him through misery.  Would anyone tie a torniquet around their own arm and prick themselves without great incentive?  It was a miserable exercise.  And to think, it could be futile: centrifuges were not oracles.  Centrifuges could only answer questions asked by those speaking on behalf of desperate people, people willing to hurt themselves to find peace.
Stovok mutely kept wrapping.

Steve ignored him.
They had already searched the museum’s top floor, as well as two “modern art” exhibitions that Steve would have liked to have spent more time with, before arriving at the ground floor, where Thor was holding court.
“Rookie luck,” Steve muttered, confident that Clint would not triumph a second time.
For a long moment—and Tony meant
“As if I’m capable,” Tony dismissed, looking out the windshield as the Hulk made an impatient roaring sound, sitting on the tarmac and gesturing at himself with two big hands.  Thor turned the hose on him obligingly, and Hulk made a more agreeable rumble.  Tony asked pointedly, “We’re not telling Fury about this, right?”
Rogers sighed.  “I’ll try not to,” he said, chewing on it oddly delicately.  “You should go home.  Get some rest.”
.”  Doubling over, Tony hacked up a lung.  Steve took pity on him, fetching him a glass of water.  Tony shook his head, holding up a quelling hand and asserting through a wheezy breath, “I am an unkillable
Acting in Tony’s best interests, the monster would intervene.  What a hero, the other monsters would appraise the monster who hurt Tony Stark.  A good Samaritan!

“Tony,” Stovok rebuked, like he had stolen the crown jewels.

“But they like peanuts,” Steve impressed.  The branches were too bare—no fruit or not enough leaves—which meant the poor things were probably starving.  “They’ll peel ‘em right open.”
“Goddamn,” Barton said faintly.
Sniffing at the bedcovers, Rico’s big flat ears twitched.  Tony flopped onto his back suddenly, the left half of his body more ragdoll than the right (

as Tony claimed his spot beside the king.  “Everybody shut up,” he ordered, reaching out for the tiny telephone held in Thor’s outstretched hand.
“It will get colder,” Stovok reported.
“Cedar Point,” Clint added.
“Thank you,” Steve said.  Then: “Be quick about it.”  Remembering manners—last but not least: “Please.”
“I did,” Tony agreed.  “Now, shut up, you’re interrupting my Zen.”
Clint looked duly cowed, muttering,
“What’s in Chicago?” Clint intruded, which was the end of that very short-lived dream.  “What’s in
Questions piled up, but the appeal was easier than trying to make them audible.  Tony rested.

“Not bad, ‘uh?” Tony asked, leaning back on his hands.
“And me,” Tony agreed.

“This should be right up your alley, Stark,” Romanova chimed in, sitting in the copilot’s chair and running down the pre-flight checklist.  “You love sticking your nose in places it doesn’t belong.”
Steve glared at the signature, then licked his thumb and attempted to scrub it off, ignoring Tony’s amused huff.
Then one rose and deliberately approached Tony, its walk strangely human.  Humanoid aliens were surprisingly common—
.  “You’re crazy.  Out of your head.  He needs to be kept away.  Locked up,” Tony told Natasha, who stepped closer.  He tensed automatically, expecting her to do something terrible—stab him in the neck, stab him in the back—but she just brushed the hair off his forehead and gave him a kiss.  He blinked up at her, bewildered.  “Uh.”
Tony’s own expression flattened.  He held the egg out provocatively over the floor.
Nope.
“There is a reason, Mr. Stark, that the

Natasha smiled a little.  “Baseball’s not really my thing.”

haunt you.”
“Roads ain’t fast enough,” Steve said sharply, attempting, a second time, to approach his dragon.
And then Tony dropped dead to the floor.
“Hey, Rogers,” Maria Hill greeted.
Marker immediately followed them.
, Steve thought, then frowned at himself, catching on, even as Tony stole another fry from his basket.
Eventually, the static calmed, and he drew in a few more calculated breaths, bringing his big machine of a body back to equilibrium.  Odds were good, between the two of them, that they could catch up to the others.  Clint and Thor were fast, but Bruce and Tony would be slow.  Yet the first words out of Steve’s mouth were not,
Where Marker was almost clumsy on the ground, he was lightning in the air.  No one, not even Iron Man, could catch him.
At last, he snuffled, “I want a cheeseburger.”
Clint kissed him on the cheek—Steve scowled—and bounced over to a cashier.  “You got that?”
“Could use a tune-up.”
Thor came awake with a roar.
They were back in the air in less than an hour.
“Thought you didn’t believe in God,” Steve reminded him.
“Behold.”  Tony tugged on a golden string.  The red curtain next to him dropped, revealing a tiny dinosaur.  “Something older than you.”
, he thought.  “I—” he tried, but the words would not come.
“We got Banner,” Tony replied, accepting a high-five from Clint.  “Nick, he’s only Hulked out twice.”
But dragons did not simply steal the hearts and souls of humans; they devoured them.
“All right,
He awoke with a start to the clang of the door hitting the wall and Rhodey rebuking, “

Thor nodded once.  “This is so.”
Bruce made a small, stepped-on sound.  “You—how much?”
, according to Natasha and Clint, respectively.  (Clint wore his I’M ACTUALLY HAWKEYE shirt at least twice a week and got recognized on average once a month.  Tony envied him.  But only in small ways.)
In response, Clint paused and turned to look back at him, tied-off bag swinging from one hand.
Within this bastard complex of grit, resolve, bone, and flesh, there resided a metallic organism whose sole purpose was to keep the primary organism alive.  It even had a heartbeat of its own, a lifeforce one could measure in megawatt hours.  (Tick, tock, ran the atomic clock—if human ears were fine enough, they could hear it

“What, are we the Boy Scouts now?  Gonna sing Kumbaya and hold hands together?” Steve grumbled.
They all looked skyward for a moment longer.
, introduced the very subdued text,
“Steve—”
Honestly, Steve felt that was mean-spirited: Thor had a lovely voice, even if it lost some of its symphonic value as Clint clapped along to the Norwegian equivalent of an Irish drinking song.  There was something charming about it, Steve had to admit, as Thor carried the song and Clint cheered him on every step of the way.
,” he added, using the shirt off his back to tie Clint’s hand to the safety railing.  Then he took off at a dead sprint down the adjacent path.
Alexander Pierce, ever the wolf and never one to back down, gripped the Tesseract's case, an unpleasant smile on his face, undeterred by the violence rankling in the pristine lobby.  Three of Pierce's lackeys latched on.  Tony stood his ground.  The Avengers had fought for this cube.  Beside him, Thor was speaking in a tongue Tony did not know and could have been

The music resumed.  Tony growled, reaching into a pocket, pulling out a small metal device.  He jimmied it into the lock, then forced the door open.  “How

“Thank you, Commander, but I can handle myself.”  Stovok took a formal step back.  Captain Carter looked at Tony and went on, “It is clearly your desire to disembark.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“What?  What’sa matter with you?” Steve asked automatically.  Clint dragged him inside—although, like Thor, Steve mostly
“Better go even out the odds, then, huh?” Tony said, moving to stand, but Stovok put a stilling hand on his shoulder.
The river was clear, deep, and
“Yes.  Like—polio.”
Clint made a spirited attempt to break free of Steve’s hold.  Steve tightened his grip in response, grumbling, “Hey,
Steve thought about it.  Bucky, in Hydra red—and shook his head.  “He’d never turn,” he muttered, which made Tony raise both eyebrows.  “We here to see some flowers or not?” Steve demanded, heart beating too fast.
“I’m sorry,” Tony offered.
“Thank you, Tony,” Steve said, because he was gracious enough to recognize that, stranded or lost or forever left behind in the race of time, a proverbial stranger’s hospitality was a gracious thing.  He felt shame welling up inside him, but he kept it down, compressed it into a small thing that could be put away, and let his voice be sincere as he said, “You’ve been a lot kinder to me than I’ve been to you.”
They walked down a little farther, until: “Kiwi?  Huh,” Tony said.

“They are our brothers and sisters,” Stovok reminded quietly, fiercely.  “It is within us to speak to them, to show our capacity for mercy, to—”
There was only the river, the blinding white sun, and the two men.  If the ghost of Barney Barton ever joined them, Steve did not know it.
Steve blinked at him once.  Tony took another big bite of cereal, then said, “What’s the book?”
,” Thor agreed, but he also flipped his table, which sent the Ba’ku scattering.  “How
“No, Kevin is,” Steve reminded him factually.
He seemed like the guy to do that kind of thing, real tough guy, the kind of guy who never cried because crying was for—
There was an almost German tint to their language, a familiarity that evoked a world almost seventy years old.  It threatened to pull Steve out of the moment, to transpose Howard Stark in his son’s place, but even the way Tony stood was differently, less patient but somehow more congenial.  Howard always seemed like a man who could stand for hours if the need arose, but Tony

there.
As Steve retreated with a bemused huff, Tony realized,
Feral like Barium, Ferrum, and Iodine.  Someday, they might all try to eat him, if he gave them half a chance on an empty stomach.  That was the way of wild dragons.
Steve offered to sit on the roof with Smokey, but Tony just rolled his eyes and shooed him into the front passenger seat—all right—and sat on his lap.  “This seems safe,” Steve muttered, one arm wrapped around Tony’s middle to keep him from flying through the windshield.
Steve gave him a hard look.  Tony just said, “See.  Told you you’d catch me.”
, desire?”
Steve shut the door behind himself, at a loss for words.  “I shouldn’t have,” he admitted, staring at the shield.  “I—”
Tony did slide the carton of eggs towards him.  Steve made no move towards them.
“I’m not getting a bell,” Steve said firmly.

Pierce's mouth twisted as Cap took the briefcase from Tony Stark’s hands.  Tony surprised himself by letting Cap do so without a fight.

“Time’s a-wastin’.”
Tony frowned.  “I hate being patient.”
Steve had a choice—he could leave.

With a sigh, Steve pulled out his notebook, conspicuously wrote down,

“I’m okay,” Steve interrupted neutrally.
Drawing in a deep breath, aware that she was speaking as an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.—not an enemy,
“Just had nothing to say to ‘women can be sex gods, too,’ huh?”
“Director Fury is no longer answering our calls,” J.A.R.V.I.S. reminded.
Tony winced, then said, “Yeah, I should . . . probably call her.”
“Intuition, smintuition,” Tony said, passing her by and slamming the door behind himself.
They drifted along, completely at ease.
Natasha draped her arms around Steve’s neck from behind.  “Happy birthday.”
Tony swallowed hard, mouth ashy dry.  “And if I can’t?”
, he fretted.  He should not have left.  He knew that now, but Rico needed—and Tony
The Adler Planetarium was perched on the very edge of town.  It was clearly closed to visitors, cool and dark, but at a gentle rap from Tony’s hand, the door opened to them.

One, Juneau had the highest percentage of millionaires of any small town in America.  About one-in-ten households.
“No, no, no, no!” Clint chanted, as Tony rounded second base without slowing down.  “Not me, not me!”
“If it is a uniform you desire—”
Steve lingered.
Steve would keep watch for him.
“I should impress,” interrupted J.A.R.V.I.S., in a rare moment of overriding urgency, “that Mr. Stone left the premises with a secondary heat signature.”
It seemed to evoke more interest than

Tony said grimly, “Sure Plan A isn’t just ‘wait for reinforcements’?”

“Enjoy your evening, Doctor,” Steve said, shutting the door behind him.  He did not remark upon Smokey sitting in the corner of the room.  Thor would surely handle the situation as he saw fit upon his return.
“My people will call your people,” Tony assured, standing outside a blacked-out station wagon with Mayor Cuff, who said simply:

Six weeks.  Six weeks had passed since Bucky’s untimely death, and Steve still could not wrap his head around it.  Logically, he had known that failure was an option, but he had not been ready for it.

By 0430, he was off to raise the flag at the White House.  When Steve demurred that they had far worthier recipients, the organizers insisted that: “To one man or woman, it is a great honor.  But to the nation, bearing witness, this will be living history.”

Rhodes gave a very beleaguered sigh, but he set down his glass and followed.
It did not bear dwelling, Steve reminded himself, for the thousandth time, throat locking up as he saw the forgotten sandwich on the floor.
Pain ricocheted up his spine, and he gritted his jaw to keep it inside.  He could not move, paralyzed with pain, even as Marker clawed out of the water, shook off—energetically scattering thousands of small, pointy shed—and finally ducked his head, nudging at Tony anxiously.  Tony made himself lift a hand to push back, but he was not capable of moving Marker anywhere, so the dragon stayed where he was.  “Stop it,” he whispered, barely able to speak.  “Go away.”
“I followed you.”
“No lost love for your new family?” Natasha asked.

“Three—
Yet, after the bloody Romulan-Earth Wars, much of the hostility had simmered down.  The Romulans, like their Vulcanic kin, were a highly reserved people, preferring to handle their own affairs.  Their request for aid had struck Tony as unusual, but also in line with a new era of Romulans, especially with the mission's similarities to the disastrous Earth colony, Tarsus IV.  After half a century of peace, Tony could hardly imagine the Romulans lashing out without cause, and Captain "Peggy" Carter had agreed, sending two of her finest men—her Senior Medical Officer, Bruce Banner, and Tony Stark—to meet with the Romulans on their vessel for a preliminary meeting.  It was Commander Stovok who, after the transmission ended, had immediately volunteered to join them.
.  “Just—we thought you were gone.”
“When did that occur to you?”
“A what?”
kind?”
Carter replied, “Twelve hours.  If Starfleet authorizes one.”
, Tony thought as Clint nodded in agreement.
Bruce skittered away quietly, but Thor’s sandals slapped magnificently on the marble flooring.  Even the most disinterested head turned to watch.
“This never leaves this room,” Tony added seriously, pointing at each of them in turn.  “Or I’ll never hear the end of it.”  Then he lifted his telephone to his mouth and ordered, “Roscoe.”  An alert voice responded briefly.  “I’m really craving some Lou’s at the Adler in less than an hour, think you can make it happen?  I’ve got five friends.  Oh, and Captain America really needs something nice to wear, if you can show up with a suit, I’ll throw in an 1872 Clive Christian Original to your next gift basket.”  Tony ended the call without another word, pocketing his telephone and clasping his hands together.  “Voila.  Bookkeeping done.”
Thor nodded once amicably, then braced a hand on Steve’s shoulder.  Steve stood his ground.  “Very well.  I shall apply half-contact,” Thor announced.
Oh, sure, Steve could clear a nine-foot-wall without so much as a running start, but it was still impressive to watch Clint leap into the night with abandon, following the trail out to the edge of Lake Michigan with fearless bounds.  “You go into the water, I’m not fishing you out,” Steve warned, as one leap put Clint within scant inches of the retaining wall.

Stovok set Dr. Banner down.  To Tony’s surprise, the latter groaned, “We’re going to d-die.”

Natasha waited.  Tony decided, “Bruce, you’re up,” and held out the bat.  Bruce swallowed hard, stepping forward to take Tony’s place at the batter’s box.  Tony passed him a tennis ball from his pocket, gripped him on the shoulder briefly in solidarity, and walked away.  “Thor,
Why?  How?
Steve took a very careful bite of his burger.  “I’ll gladly make an enemy of you,” Happy told Steve, pouncing on the opening, “to keep a friend like him.”
“Unclear,” Stovok said neutrally, unreadable behind his opaque mask.  “Federation documentation for this area is limited.”
Champs, my jaw is locking up from pain, can somebody phone in a small miracle for me? This ol' bear needs a break.
“Gotta lot t’ do,” Steve explained, mostly to his arms.  “Big day.”
Tried to, anyway.  Bronze Tellurium kept joining him, wherever he went, and unlike cuddly green Thallium, Tellurium tended to indelicately jab her horns until he made room for her.  When he grumbled about donating her to a politician in need of a few more sleepless nights, she hole-punched his ankle.
“Generally been my experience with dragons,” Rhodes concurred.
, snapping cobs in half and sucking the kernels off like it was nothing.
“I'm going to shower.” Steve speaks again, walking away casually as he could with his ass as sore as it was. Not even Tony's tongue had totally soothed it. He could hardly stop thinking of how the Hulk handled his corn, Tony sucking on the end of his. Steve groaned, throwing the shower on cold and shucking off his dirt-dusted and slightly torn clothes. When he feels the danger of arousal has passed, he turns the water hotter and washes himself clean.
Tony takes advantage, shifting forward and pushing his heavy cock into the Captain's open mouth. Steve's sucking is immediate and desperate, slurping up Tony Stark's buttery cock like it was fresh corn on the cob. Tony groaned, pumping his cock slowly into Steve's hot mouth, pushing his fingers slowly through the man's corn-colored hair. For all his pomp, Steve was such a good bottom boy, taking both corn and cock like a pro.
Still blushing, Steve gave her his own playful grin, “I’m afraid I would get in a lot of trouble if I got down on my knee to ask for it…but you,” he looked her over again and smirked, “you could kick my ass.”
“He just said, meh.” Bruce said.
“You already ate your dinner. You’re getting nothing else from me.” Tony huffed.
“Baby.” Tony tugged at Steve’s hand to bring him closer. “Look at me.”
Steve did not believe him at first. Could not believe him. Of course not. He’d be insane to.
It’s been one of the few times the two had been left alone in the same room. Tony had a tendency to maneuver Steve away if the blond got too close. The closing of the door surprised the soldier and he looked at Tony with cautious hope.
He shrugged and gave her a humored smile in return, “Maybe a little.”
“Mhm.”
Steve had no idea what to do. He had dreamt of being in Tony's arms for so long and now he was here and he had no idea what to do or what was going on. The hands, so strong they carried metal and the world, were gently caressing over Steve's bare stomach. And then the lips, with a slight tickle of the goatee, trailed over the exposed nape.
“Hmm…no.”
Truly, no one in the room held a candle to the genius for one Steve Rogers.
His head flopped back and he stared up at the dark ceiling and willed his hand to not gently press against the gold and wish...
Sam nodded, slowly, “Come to the bar next time you’re in town. Beer and a meal on me.”
“A long shower.” Tony promised as he pulled Steve’s hair again. “And tonight, why not dinner out?”
An early dinner of spaghetti greeted Tony when he came out of the lab a few hours later. Steve had just finished pouring the sauce over the noodles and sprinkling cheese over the top as he walked into the kitchen.
“Thanos had you.” He moved in closer, trying to check the man for any injuries. “I…don’t…I couldn’t get to you…I’m…” his hands fell limply down, his brain catching up with what he was doing.
happy. “Please tell me.”
“I’m happy for you.”
A yelp escaped him as he tumbled to the ground, his knee throbbing from the surprise hit. He briefly saw colored spots in his vision and for a few seconds he could not catch his breath.
“Wrong trees.” Natasha said. She was up on her feet, side pressed on his chair, as she played with her phone. The light glinted on her red-hair and made the bruises and scabs on her right hand bloom darker. It was another reminder of where they had come from and what they had accomplished. The remainders of the final necessities it took to win the world. A few words from the Black Widow had plenty of people willing to keep jaws shut. Of course, it helped a few dignitaries had their jaws wired shut after a talk. Tony noticed Natasha carried wounds around finer than pearls. He still made a mental note to buy her the best set of pearls on the market for her hard work. Probably with a wire lining for future missions.
"What bullshit SCI-FI, magic-crap are you doing to me?" Tony hissed.
Tony just growled under his breath, “I’ll think of something.”
“But I do not, sir. And if I did, I don’t believe I’d be trembling given your current state. Shall I make another cup for you?”
“Too smart.” Tony had to admit. “He’s already figuring things out and it’s barely been a week.”
“You’ve just lost a lot of things, Steve. Things even with all my smarts and knowledge I just can’t get back for you. And I am sorry about that.” His tone and expression, how heavy and hurt it looked, made Steve believe he truly was sorry for this fact. “But at least I can provide you some things you love. You’ll have plenty more than that to look forward to.”
Everything about himself, from his skin to his bones to his mind, felt like brittle glass. There were moments during the day where he’d simply be reaching for a glass within the kitchen, as if it were something he had done for years, and get cornered by the overwhelming feeling of loss. He was not home. He was not where he was meant to be. He had died before he could do anything he’d promised to do and was revived after the work was done.
His stomach jumped when the calloused fingertips pressed up against skin and roamed over the numbers as if absorbing something from a holy text. Tony's hands were warm and were unsettling, tickling with some sort of promise of gentleness and power, and Steve found himself frozen again.
“Easy,” Pepper soothed, noticing the change in Tony’s posture and eyes. “Easy. Don’t let him see this yet.”
“Interesting name…after the Norse god?”
“And quite ripped.” Tony threw him one of those lazy grins that always did things to Steve’s belly.
He laughed and slowly the head of the armor disappeared and his Tony appeared. “That is one way to say it.”
“What do you mean?’ Well…I mean, I do know you had a crush on me, I mean who wouldn’t but--”
“I’ll start begging again if that gets you going. “ Steve glared weakly at his lover, “Just move. Please.”
"Tony!"
to leave.” He dragged Steve towards the elevator where he gave him one more kiss. “See you tomorrow, love. And you best get some sleep.”
“Then why do you do it?”
Steve shifted on his feet a bit and chewed on his lip.
Trying the hero path, like Steve, wasn’t for him. He was impatient and angry and had a sense of apathy for most. He found that he wasn’t just ready to kill but eager. He liked killing. He liked the power. He liked the screams. He liked the sight of the people who got in his way begging for mercy.
“It basically means the best of the best.” Tony laughed in pleasure. “You’re about to be pampered, doll-face. Anything you want, you get. You’ll get the best food, the best toys, the best
“Are you sure all his actions were done by himself?”
“I’m not saying the whole mess isn’t unusual. But people can get hurt because of that place.”
“Jesus,” his new companion swore, “why don’t you have any coat on?”
“T-Tony,” Steve tried, clearing his throat.
"Wow..." His finger traced over the pattern.
“Tony, please.”
Steve allowed the redhead to maneuver him around and drag him along like a puppy from one point to another. Finally they were on the luxurious, large couch and she had decided he was now her pillow and she slumped up against his shoulders and started to text on her phone. “Gonna make the bastard squirm.”
Now Steve’s face broke out into a grin at the challenge, “Dunno. Guess we need to find out.”
“I could kill you with a smack upside the head.” Steve warned, his cheeks neon red.
“Well, isn’t that a slutty compliment?”
“Get me a koala and I’ll live.” Natasha popped some gum in her mouth.
“Ugh, you’re such a child.”
Thanos continued to swipe through his memories of Steve like he was reading him like an Ipad.. “A strong man. Beautiful and kind. Smart. Naïve.”
“What?” Tony pushed.
“Ah, well, they say if I can come and help to tend some of their fields I can bring home good portion of what I work. Apparently, most others in the village have other jobs that don’t allow them the time to help every farmer. So I was asked to do.” He shrugged meekly. “I said I would speak to you about it, but it sounded like a good idea. Would save a bit of money.”
“I shall keep you up to date on all the progress.”
“Then please start showing it.” Steve wrapped his legs around Tony’s waist. “You said you will put a baby in me. Get to it.”
That was an impossible request but Steve did not bother Jarvis with his worries any longer. There was nothing he could do as of yet but, surely, he could figure something out. Tony was an important man, and important men were always in danger, perhaps Steve could offer up his services in that sense?
Steve jumped to his feet and bounced a bit. “I appreciate it. I do. I just…it’s still a bit much for me to think about courting and," he glared at the man when he snorted at the term, "dating Tony. Especially when I’m apparently ninety-years his senior.”
“No murderous war path.” She teased. “Hopefully you’re killing days are over and you can start to live more domestic.”
Pepper's smirk grew and she pointed to Tony's right. “Him.”
“You’re already taking care of me.” His breath hitched when Tony’s hand wrapped around him and lazily started to pump, “T-Tony.”
Steve swallowed. The fire and his curse…that special it his mother fretted over…all the miserable occurrences that had taken place the past few months that led him pinned under what was, without any doubt, the most dangerous being he would ever see…
“Good.” He bit at Tony’s ear and seductively blew at it, “How rough,” Steve now nipped at Tony’s lips, smirking to himself when he felt Tony begin to harden inside of him again, “do you want to experiment?”
"I think I'm all set too." He said though it tasted like a lie.
Steve was quivering.
“Now that’s your word, right? Captain America’s word is golden.” Tony’s thumb brushed over Steve’s knuckles. “You gotta keep it and be a shinning example for me.”
“That…” Steve had to take a moment to take a few breaths. His heart was in his throat and he had a sheen of sweat over him. “Was
“I could get used to ruining you, babe.” Tony kissed him, laughing when Steve pulled back. “It’s fine, doll. There is something attractive about going after your mouth knowing what you just swallowed.”
Tony gritted his teeth, “Fuck off.”
His fingers were too close to the golden arc and Steve quickly tried to push the touch away. He was close to panting and his skin was on fire, “T-Tony, you’re getting a little…too much…”
“Nope.” Natasha grabbed the collar of Bruce’s shirt and dragged him away. “You both are going to party and if that means I need to take you to a corner and ravish you, Banner, to keep your knitting-loving pulse up then, well, that’s a sacrifice I am willing to make.”
“How stupid would it be to call you a bastard?”
Tony went back to Steve’s lips, his attention rough and desperate but with absolute control. His hands held Steve’s head, keeping him still, but with such powerful tenderness Steve nearly, for some reason, wanted to start crying. It felt perfect. It was…necessary. Complete. Giving Tony this power and dominance was something Steve never knew he needed.
Tony couldn’t help but laugh a little. It sounded strained but he could appreciate what Jarvis was trying to do. It did little against the truth; he was in something deep with Steve and it constantly burned him alive. It was beautiful and destructive and he wanted more.
“His serum must be affecting the predicted timeline because I can assure you this is not a mistake. The medical equipment and room sensors have been lit sir. Mr. Rogers is waking up.”
‘Here’s to you, Captain.’ He toasted in silence as his smile fell sad. ‘It took over seventy years and for you to have to die but because of you all of this came to be. This is for you. You and mom.’ He closed his eyes a moment and sighed. ‘I know it’s not quite the route you wanted but you’d appreciate the end results, mom.’
Tony smiled gently. “Thank you.”
“Tony. Please.”
“I’ll bury him in it. Or should we do Shwarma?” Tony rubbed his chin. “Might just play it safe and do pizza.”
“Had a bit of a shock, seeing me, but he’s doing better. He has some food in him.”
“You like me. You want me. Right?”
“Fucking hell.” And then he pressed his mouth and tongue against the tattoo. He lapped at it gentle, providing a little suck, and then proceeded to kiss it gentle over and over again. “You branded yourself.”
Tony hummed, “I wasn’t really ready for a pet here…”
“I thought I told you to go to bed?”
The gratitude took Steve by surprise. “For what?”
Steve found himself panting as well.
He winced, “Yeah…I think I’d like to avoid those for now too.”
The tone did something to Steve’s stomach and he swore even his thighs jumped at the vibrations. There was such a tingling sensation ripping through his skin and he found he couldn’t use his own voice for a few moments.
“Yeah, I had thought of saving the reveal when we were all together but,” Steve shrugged, “Natasha and Bucky seem to know things without any notice. I wouldn’t have gotten two more feet before they had known something was up.”
“So a deal and a name apparently made you quite powerful.”
“Because you are both idiots and he is a bit naïve. You’ll take advantage of him and his need to do a challenge. And no,” she held up her finger when he opened his mouth, “if you try to subtly challenge him to jump off the balcony we will figure it out, you’re not that smart, and we will then throw
“Cancer, what about cancer?” he asked, almost feverishly hopeful, that maybe, just maybe—
Natasha said sweetly, “Well, this is more fun than poker, isn’t it?”
“One pissed-off super-soldier with a side of wholesome American hospitality?” Tony Stark answered.  He looked at the two guards, smiled, and added, “He’s with me.”
Then he thought of Natasha and his laughter became a sob.
“Oh, no,” moaned Dr. Banner.  “No, no, no, we can’t—that’s

He swallowed bile, dizzy with fear.
would never be able to walk the brownstone streets the same way Stevie Rogers had.  He would always dream of Brooklyn, exactly as it had been, the day before he had left.  “No,” he said out loud, because Tony was still listening, waiting for his answer.
“Copper finishes,” Tony murmured, still ignoring him.  He rocked forward on his feet like he wanted to touch the metal finishes but did not dare.  “Bet it’ll be beautiful in a year or two.  Patina will fade in nicely.”
Still red-nosed and gloomy, Steve looked at him briefly.  Then he said, “No,” and turned back to his sadness cookies.
“Ha-ha,” Tony said, pushing himself upright.  Once he was on hands and knees, Stovok gripped the back of his uniform and set him on his feet.  “Thanks.”
you come,” Tony repeated, poke-prod-
There were bikes, too; lots and lots of bikes.  Steve looked at them with more than passing interest—Harley-Davidson had survived the War, he was pleased to note—and wondered what had become of his own.  He doubted S.H.I.E.L.D. would leave it to rot, but it made his stomach twist to think of even his
Tony shook his head, then reached for Steve’s toast and took a big bite.  “This is the driest thing I have ever had in my mouth.”
Tony thought, jamming his fingers against the side of Stovok’s neck, the bottom dropping out of his world when he felt nothing, no trace of a pulse.  Even as white noise fogged his ears and panic clouded his judgment, he slid his fingers around to Stovok’s nape, where, steady and strong, Stovok’s pulse thrummed.
“Not many,” Clint replied, mirroring him.
, Tony thought.  He peeled the skin back, revealing a clear glob of fruit, and took a generous bite.
“Three,” Tony insisted.  “Two.”  He cocked the nozzle.  “One.”
“This is the play room,” the clerk explained.  “We like to let them hang out together.”
“Ah,” was all Sojef said.  Tony could see a puzzle piece click for him.  But Sojef went on: “We wanted a sanctuary.  A place to live and raise our children.”
Stovok interrupted, “This must be an illusion.”
.  The medicos skirted around the simple truth of the matter, but Tony knew it anyway: the dragon had broken his back.
“Optimism is . . . irrational,” Stovok dismissed.  “I am merely a realist.”
by the natives—”
Tony smiled to himself, a private, rueful thing.
At that, Steve barked an honest, horrible laugh that jostled his torso and brought the pain back into sharp relief.  “Let him try,” he gritted out.
They kept moving.
Rubbing his forehead, Steve said, “OK,
“Tony,” Rhodey warned, but Tony had already wedged himself into the transportation pod, insisting:
“Dr. Banner is not without intelligence.”
Steve glared at the back of his head, then gripped Tony’s seat for balance as they careened abruptly down a side-road.  “Tony Stark, what the hell’s wrong with you?”
“I always,”
“West Virginia or Michigan,” Tony explained.
It was a miracle that it took them half an hour to get pulled over by a cop.
“I feared you would say as much,” Anij said, drawing both their gazes.  “Offlanders rarely think of anyone but themselves.”
of these,” and trying to ignore the warmth in his chest when Steve leaned to kiss his knuckles.  “Well.  Aren’t you sweet.”
“What do I get out of it?”
Steve refused to let his movements bely any shame as he moved away from the big teddy bear, insisting gruffly, “Where are they really?”
“Can’t die,” Steve said, floating calmly in the pool.  “Christmas is in two weeks.”

That, and grooming themselves.  Even though dogs were louder and more energetic and all around great fun, Steve could see what Tony
call, he would have gotten a dog.  But Tony had always preferred cats.  Hence: Rico.
In the end, Curium snapped clear through the log, and Steve set him back down.  He shooed the burning halves back into the fire pit.
“I’m not like you,” Steve went on.  “I’m just . . . bones.”  The way he said it made it human.  The way he said it divorced him from the serum, from seventy years of ruling as the most famous league-of-legend-of-them-
“Anybody else getting a strong sense of déjà vu?” Tony mused, as their unarmed transport vessel approached the Briar Patch.
Steve dropped to the ground.  Tony flinched, then turned to face him.  Flicking the hat off Tony’s head, Steve caught it in hand.  “Is this a future thing?” Steve asked, genuinely curious.
was the crown jewel of the Federation, and she would prove dearly missed, should her disappearance prove irreversible.  The act was more than posturing—it was a declaration of war.
“No,” Clint repeated.  “Stark—”
After that, it was admittedly a bit fuzzy.
“Of course you do.”  Sighing, Tony rubbed his brow.  “How did you get on this ship?”
“Mm-hm.”  Tony waved a hand.  “Which is easier, harvesting lumber or repurposing it?”  Then, almost apologetically, he stepped forward and rested a hand on the car’s yellow roof.  “Not that I would.  I’m such a

Marker looked at him, then slid away, putting enough distance between them to fly.
“You in for a doughnut?” Clint asked congenially, setting down the six-pack on the dining table and startling Bruce, who walked by without a shirt on, gripping a glass full of purple liquid very tightly.  Bruce looked desperately like he did
Tony thought about lying, then said, “I might.”
The god of thunder laughed, and Steve knew it was going to be okay.
“Right,” Tony said.  A stranger might think he was simply recovering from a cold, his breath thin.  But Steve could hardly make himself follow as the tin man limped along, determinedly but far from silently.
He saw his companion in the human tribe sitting in an armchair, reading a book by moonlight.  Tony interrogated, “Why are you up?”
The trees were quiet, the forest respiring audibly with each pulse of wind.
A little sulkily, Steve said, “It’s not
“Mendenhall.  That’s where the real party’s at, right?  Let’s go.”
“Don’t.
“Would it kill you to have a little humility?” Clint asked dryly, limping over.  “Oh, Invincible Iron Man?”
“Terra Incognita,” Stovok said suddenly.
.  And I’m stuck six flight-hours away in a crowded airport, barely able to raise a signal, never mind fly into New York, and you’ve gone ghost.  After the biggest historical event of the century.”
Clint whined, “Let me out.

“I understood the meaning,” Stovok dismissed.  He frowned.  “You mean to say this is Terra-like?”  He actually seemed disappointed.
Thor nodded, then seemed to brighten visibly at the prospect, even though Steve knew that there would be no
All he could think was,
while Clint attempted to pry the newspaper out of his hands.  Steve kept one hand on the wheel and the other across the two seats, keeping Clint from entering the arena.  “You know, Bruce is setting a fine example,” Steve acknowledged.  Bruce huddled deeper in his corner.  “Be like Bruce,” Steve insisted, pushing Clint back.

Happy stared Steve down.  “I’m gonna be frank, I can’t read this left, right, or center.  So.  What
Tony’s telephone rang.  Taking both hands off the wheel, he answered it and held it up without a word.
Then, of course, Captain America had to pop out of the hole like a weasel, effortless and easy.  Tony forced himself up to his knees before Steve could pity him too much.  He did not stand: his legs were too shaky, and he was sore from his failed and successful escapes.
