Hurriedly, Steve disrobes and climbs into the suit. It needs hemming, but the shoulders fit fairly well. The cuffs are too large and could be taken in, and the waist needs some work as well. Stepping out of the bathroom, he presents himself to Pepper and tries his best not to show his excitement.
“It doesn’t matter what you will have or what you won’t have. He’s determined to do it. Regardless,” Frigga sits on the edge of the cot. Her eyes are soft in the warm light of the fire from the hearth. “He will do it. So, you have to decide, will you let his sacrifice be for nothing or will you find a way to save him?”
It’s exactly a week later when Tony announces that he needs to go to the doctor and that Steve has to assist him. Jarvis glares at Steve over the breakfast of croissant egg sandwiches he’s made (Steve hasn’t eaten this good since his mother died).
Steve cannot help the guffaw as he holds his abdomen for a hard belly laugh that shakes his shoulders and brings tears to his eyes from the pain. “You? A blacksmith?”
Steve snorts but Tony elbows him in the gut. Clearing his throat, he says, “Can’t two team mates just visit a friend?”
He munches on the rest of the cookies during the long ride home. When he’s fifteen minutes from the mansion his phone rings and, while Steve has never called him before, something sings in his heart that it could possibly be him (Tony tries not to think that Steve’s his boyfriend).
“Well, I suppose it’s better than actually being thick with the actual thieves,” Steve spits back in all jest. He heard the stories about Scott’s more than dubious past antics.
He expects the next thing he feels will be Steve entering him, but it isn’t. A hot moist tongue licks his entire length and then he’s swallowed down. Tony bucks under Steve and cries out. He doesn’t want to come yet. This is sweet torture. He’s barely breathing, his air sticks in his lungs. He rumbles against Steve as he sucks and rubs his tongue against Tony’s cock.
She wipes the sweat from his brow and then brings the thick furs up and tucks them under his chin. “You’ll get chilled now the shock has passed.”
When they get to the cab, Steve’s able to convince the cabbie to let him ride upfront. Maybe he has an honest face. Who knows? It’s an uncomfortable ride for Steve. He left his phone in his apartment. He can’t retreat to it to past the time. Instead, he stares out at the city he’s about to leave. Who knows when or if he’ll return to New York City? He grew up here, his mother died here. His life is gone here. Bucky is in D.C. with Sam building a life. It’s time for Steve to do the same.
Tony shoves his hands in his pockets and rather than let the bull skewer him, he takes it by the horns. “Well, what do you want to say, Rogers. Just come out and say it. I’m a big boy.”
He murmurs the words, and Tony isn’t sure he heard correctly. He squeezes Steve’s hand. “It’s kind of hard to wrap your head around it. I know. But you’re a person. No one is going to judge you on your love life. Well, some people are, but they don’t count.”
“You do it when your loopy from hunger, don’t you?” Tony narrows his eyes at him. He knows he’s right.
Clint turned around as the lift rose. “Yeah, that’s it. Told me to get somewhere safe. I mean what the hell?”
And Tony hates it. He wants Steven to like this – at least a little bit. Part of him understands nature and how it rules them, but he wonders how much has been layered on by nurture and the rule of law? He doesn’t wait for Steven to join him. Instead he steps over to him, grasps his arm, and then guides him to the bathroom.
Tony backs off and shoves his hands in his pockets. “Two huh? Over achiever. Ma always said it took forever to potty train me. Too busy doing other things to stop to take a leak.”
“I’ve been trying to block it,” Steve retorted and the doctors nodded like they all had puppet strings on their heads.  Steve continued, “It had to have worked. He didn’t hulk out, did he?”
“You know what I mean, you know that the little town of Avenge happens to be a place people seek out to hide, not much around here. Is there? No gold. No silver, hell there’s not even copper.”
“Can I ask what brought this on?” Steven asks. “Because I’d like to be able to figure out the motives behind some of your reasoning. It might better prepare me for when I’ve crossed the line and you might lash out.”
“It’s only a dream,” Steve said and leaned down again to touch his lips not only to Tony’s mouth, but to his neck, he traversed downward and Tony felt his own needs heighten.
Both of them are standing nose to nose ready for a knockdown, drag out fight, and for a moment, Tony considers letting them whack at each other for a while because hell it would be better than tolerating a movie with them. But that’s when Steve – the good Captain- decides to make his appearance. Looking too fit for mortal men, the Captain swings into the room and claps his hands, an uncharacteristic smile on his face and a bit of green under his nails. When the Captain plops down on the sofa next to him, Tony can only focus on one thing – that smudge of green under his fingernail. The Captain is always pristine.
“The core is there. The good man is there. I know he is,” Steve replied. “Reaching him, making him understand…”
She bows and says, “Thank you for allowing the Retreat to service you.” She leaves and Steve doesn’t know what to do.
“No. No need. And what about Steve? Is he coming?” Tony wants to say has he been invited, but he’s not going to put Pepper in that position.
JARVIS paused for an uncomfortable amount of time and Bruce opened his mouth as if to question it, but Tony put a finger to his lips. “JARVIS, anytime now.”
“In all fifty states, my friend. But I got a lead on one. Come on! Don’t tell me that you’re not curious!” Tony had said and batted his eyelashes. Of course, the latter didn’t sway Rhodey at all, but maybe curiosity had. They ended up down near the industrial part of Boston where Tony could smell the salt of the water and something metallic in the air.
“Spectacularly is too nice a word for what happened, you know that right?” Fury says and he places his hands on hips and studies the map. “You gotta tell me, Cap, how you’re planning on keeping the peace throughout this whole fiasco.”
As Steve climbs the ladder, he scans the bay inside the Avengers. It speaks to the size of the starship. The ship bay docks dozens of fighters and at least three shuttles that Steve can count. It’s massive in scope. He’s awed and a little cowed by it.
How could he not when Tony was dead, flayed away on the roof of the Triskelion? The vestiges of his voice meant nothing but wishes and lost hopes. In his mind, he saw Tony then, standing in front of him through the white-out pain. Tony reached up with his wounded hands, his chest flayed open, his eyes mere sockets. Those beautiful eyes that never rested with any color – gone. The white lightning came from Tony then. The blaze of light radiated from his wounds, from his undying body, but it didn’t harm. It didn’t hurt Steve. It only warmed him; it only protected him. Like a cloak, it sheathed him against the onslaught, against their torture. He surrendered to it as it bathed him. He succumbed to the white lightning. One word parted his lips.
As they stood on the banks of the creek, Tony surveyed the damage to his armor and to the remains of the Legion. “Phew, that’s a mess. I’ll call in the cleaning crew tomorrow. How’d we do otherwise?”
“Oh,” Steve said and looked down at himself. He smiled. “Yeah, yeah!” He sat up and started to unzip.
“Well, let me get Vision to bring up the food.” Tony leans over to the side table and picks up his phone. It is voice activated and Vision responds with the food in only minutes. Both he and Pietro enter the room with two large trays of food.
Tony followed suit and threw his pants to the side, only to feel a rush of adrenalin as if he wanted to flee. He offered steadying waves to Steve and the rapidity of his breathing evened out. Tony grabbed his hand. “Are you sure about this?” He tried not to look at the prominent erection Steve sported.
“I used to know a James, but I called him Bucky-.” Steve says before Tony shuts him up by waving his hands.
Until the irritation of life came back to grapple with him, to bring him back from the brink, to lay him on the shores of the Potomac. He only felt a rumbling in his awareness, like a light passing breeze shifted over him. No flesh against flesh, no skin to skin contact but as the shade who saved him dropped him on the bank. The words bubbled up even as water cascaded out of his mouth being ejected from his lungs. Bleary-eyed he rasped, “Brother.”
Like a bullet he jets toward his target, he doesn’t stop. He lands and takes out the damned terrorists without a thought. The people of the village, hostage to the violence of the terrorists, don’t applaud him and he doesn’t wait for it. He keeps going. He keeps it up. Even after he begs Rhodey to call off his hunting dogs and get the jet fighters to let up on their target practice against him, he continues clearing out the terrorists with his weapons.
Hovering over him, Tony stands in the washroom and his eyes darken. “I hope you aren’t taking to heart what Obie said.”
“Well.” Tony folds his hands and attempts to calm the shaking in his voice. “Why don’t you start from the beginning.”
“I hope so,” Steve said. “I’m getting in touch with Wong as soon as possible to plan a meeting. Now that most of us are in New York. It’s time.”
“You’re not my toy, I know you’re not my toy.” Steve marches out of the room and into the bathroom entrance. “Steve! Steve! I’m speaking to you. Come back here!” Steve stops, his hands in fists. He turns back to Tony. “I hate to point out the obvious, but you are, in fact, a hooker! And you happen to be under a contract with me and therefore part of my crew!”
How could he accept it as so?  He isolated himself after Pepper, after everything that happened with the Mandarin. It worked for him. He didn't need to deal with complications of people and their problems. Tony was enough of a problem to deal, he couldn't deal with others. His soul juddered as if it fought his own brain, his own thought processes. Tony yearned to be with Steve, to learn about him, to see why the universe linked them together - there must be a reason. He was a man of logic even if his emotions drove his actions sometimes. Yet to shatter all of his defenses, break down his walls and allow Steve and a whole pack into his brain, his heart, his soul, that terrified him. He couldn't let it happen.
Tony winks at him and follows what he’s told. His cock bounces as it’s released from the constricting pants. Fine dribble of semen smears the head. Steve licks his lips but he knows he has to use a condom. Taking one out, he waits until Tony settles on the bench. Steve kneels. It’s a tight space but Steve’s small, he can handle it easily. He unrolls the condom onto Tony’s erection, gliding his hands along the bare shaft before he opens his mouth and accepts the cock. It sits on his tongue, warm and heavy.
Sam bowed his head; arms crossed over his chest. Tony did not like the judgement in the man’s eyes. “So the prodigal son returns. You drop him and then decide to come back?”
“Then,” Steve said and there was a quirk of a smile to his lips. “Maybe I should take a page out of your book. Maybe I should try something?” He leaned down and, for a moment, paused before he pressed dry lips against Tony’s mouth. Frozen, Tony did not respond. It wasn’t passionate or moving, but analytical and evaluative. Steve stood back up and stared down at Tony.
“Oh, it is, about as real as injecting blue liquid into my major muscle groups to completely physically change me,” Steve said. “This is my band as the leader of the Soul Pack. It appeared nearly two years ago.” He pointed to his wrist. Next he went through the rest of the marks. “This is Bruce – a team member in New York. He’s our Healer. Here’s Nat. She’s my Confidant. Well, also the whole group’s Confidant. This is Peggy, an old friend. She’s our Guide.”
The hustle and bustle of the Concourse and the life of the Prime Station grows thicker as the day wears on. As they make their way toward The Cage, Steve notices how Tony drags a bit behind. He marvels at all the little things that Steve usually takes for granted. He watches as a child runs up to a vendor and begs for a treat while his mother digs out some credits to buy it. He spins around and looks upward to see the layers of the Concourse, the different shops. Some of the shops are consignment and Tony’s fascinated by the idea of a used clothing in store. He wanders to the area where children swing and jump on a playground while their tired parents lounge in chairs watching. At one point, Tony stops to see a line of people waiting to see the latest reality vid experience.
“At least take some iron pills,” Tony said now as he reached out to the drawer of the night table to pull out the package he always kept there for Steve. “Take four. I know the package says one, but you metabolize faster. So take more.”
She smiles and her eyes twinkle and everything is right and perfect with the world. He leaves her tucked into her bed and closes the door. Steve stands there, arms folded.
“You asked for a Personal Assistant that knows the saxophone-.” He stops because that’s still obviously wrong. “Like I said I can get out of your hair.”
“I think I got there because Tony forced me to, he called me on the carpet about it so many times that I knew not to go there,” Steve says. He shrugs. “Maybe you and Pepper are just so close to the situation and managing it for so long that you’re kind of shell shocked by the tiniest issue now.” He rushes to add, “Not that this was a tiny issue. It was huge.”
Now, he accepts the fact that he will return to the States with Tony, he’ll end up being interrogated by Ross’ goons. If Tony’s right and Ross keeps his word, Steve will be transferred to the Avengers’ facility. It isn’t a bad thing-;living his life in the Avengers facility; it’s what he’d thought his life would be but without the truth of freedom.
“Yep,” Clint says but his answers halting. He looks away and then back at them. “Are you here to get away from the big bad?”
“I didn’t say that. But they are my employees and I ask them to follow my rules. I never inferred that they are anything but employees.” Tony gulps back the last of it; Steve is more, not an employee, not a friend.
Should he be elated? Should he care? They undid his work. They remade him. He feels like Frankenstein’s monster. A thing put back together again with pieces and parts of non-living tissue. Vision had been made out of vibranium. Does vibranium, the thing that made up his shield, now live in him? No, that’s not right. Cho said something about a graft from his leg. Does he feel that? Can he feel anything at all?
“Since the mayor tucked tail and ran the whole town’s been looking to me,” Steve says. “I need to give these people some hope. You think old Aunt May and her nephew aren’t hoping some doctor will be in town with Ben’s heart problems acting up? Part of protecting the town is taking care of the little things, Bucky.”
“I know,” Steve said. “The soul pack can help you through it, you know. Being connected to Bucky-.” He glimpsed Tony’s cringe so he rushed on with his thoughts. “It might help to feel it from his point of view. It won’t be easy, but it could be cathartic.”
With no time to spare, Steve jumps to his feet and smacks the cuff clip to collect the nanobots and to activate the shield again. As expected Hulk recovers quickly and releases a howl to the winds that’s both terrifying and deafening. The clouds roll in response and for a second, Steve expects Thor to launch himself down from the sky. He doesn’t – it’s just Steve and Hulk fighting for dominance in the middle of Ultron’s play field.
“Mer Rogers, you may find the washroom directly to the left. There you will find cleaning supplies or an automatic washer. Also, there is an autoclave if that’s what you desire to use.”
He places a mug of coffee in front of Steve. “I take it that it’s been a while since you had any coffee.” Tony has no idea what they fed Steve in the hospital. During the flight Steve spent most of his time sleeping. Tony suspects it was a defense mechanism. “Listen, JARVIS, the robot in the ceiling – well not really – but you can think of him that way will help you out. Think of him as a butler. He’ll show you were your room is and I’ll have him order some clothes for you. Don’t worry about it. Just-.” Tony stops. Here’s where he has no clue what to say or do with a person turned lion turned person again. “Just take it easy.” He picks up his mug of coffee and starts toward his workshop – it’s been ages. He needs to escape. He can grill Steve when it’s more appropriate and his own head isn’t pounding.
JARVIS continues a monologue of the game with few interrupts by Steve as he opens his closet and finds not one but three uniforms. Two of the uniforms are red and one is blue with a silver star. He’s not sure why one is a different color, so he leaves it alone and stays with the red and gold. He strips out of his clothes, thinks about the lingerie that Tony bought today but realizes that it’s still back in the prince’s quarters. Searching through his stock of undergarments, Steve settles on panties that barely hold his cock and a thin silky a-shirt. It will have to do. He slips on the uniform and considers shoving the boots aside when JARVIS comments, “Mer Rogers you will need to boots. They are used in situations where there are unstable gravity fields.”
“Permission to speak frankly, sir.” Steve knew he should just keep his mouth shut, but he needed to say something. He had to. The star on his chest, the colors of his shield, meant something to him still, even if it meant little to anyone else anymore.
“You know that’s not true,” Steve said, and he almost referred to their many times here in this dream space. Why wasn’t he? In the dream he would, he would tell Tony – I would never think of you as a burden. But the words died in his mouth and tasted of ash and dirt. He felt all the more bereft because of his own inaction.
Yinsen glances at the lion. “Yes.” He ladles soup into the bowl again. “Now, you must eat. When they come back, and they will, you need your strength. They recovered you for a reason, I am afraid Mister Stark. I could not do what they asked, perhaps you can.”
"Come, Sheriff, we need your assistance," Thor says and Steve nods, noting that Happy is in the corner throwing up into the ceramic bowl for the water pitcher.
“You spent a long time trying to get me, didn’t you?” Steve says and the colors of the void pulse like a beating heart.
He’d been there. Steps away from the building where a man had been tortured and he never knew. He could have known, he should have asked. He was twelve – what responsibility did he own? He’d spent the next four summers on the campus. He never walked into the bio-division laboratory. Not even once.
That was an old adage and Tony almost accused her of being cliché, but it niggled in the back of his mind the whole time he was at Council. Now, as he rested with his omega tucked next to him, Tony couldn’t deny that those words seemed truer and more satisfying than anything he learned when he was young. The feeling of Steven curled next to him, offering him the protection and security, envelops him, and the doubts and anxieties of the day ease away until he falls into a deep sleep.
“Is he okay?” Clint asks. He looks like someone socked him in the mouth. He’s got a bag of frozen peas against his face.
“Viola-?” He swallowed hard as he processed the question. “Like raped?” He shook his head. How could she even think that? “No, no, not at all. I wanted it. I -.” He closed his eyes and pulled his hand away from her again as the tears burned. The shame boiled over until he thought he couldn’t stand the taste of it, the feel of it. “I would have begged for it.” He should be locked away. Perverse. There was something wrong with him. “I’m so ashamed.”
“And I am Yinsen Ho, you may call me Yinsen.” The doctor sits on the edge of the bed. “I did what I could to save you, but now you must save yourself.”
If Tony didn’t know better, he would swear that Blu’s cleaning his wounds in the best way he knows how. It can’t be right; a lion wouldn’t save him and care for him. That makes no sense. But then again, a lion flying through the air with Iron Man tops the cake – so what the hell does he know?
His mind was all over the place – his soul a juddering mess. Steve couldn’t hold onto it. Clasping Tony’s soul felt like trying to tame a hurricane. “Bucky and the twins aren’t here. Hawkeye and Natasha took them to a safe house.” He didn’t say that sooner or later, Steve would have to follow. He needed to. Not only was he their pack leader, but he was also Bucky’s friend.
Looking directly at Sam became a problem. To sink so low that he couldn’t face his friend nearly stopped him from saying anything, but when he did glance up, Sam offered nothing but open and honest compassion. “I’ve been, I’ve been dreaming. A lot.”
Taken aback, Steve swings an arm around and punches the guy in the abdomen. It’s staggering and the alpha falls back, releasing Steve. Immediately, Steve realizes he’s made a mistake. The man stands there, stunned and confused.
Steve looked up at his mother. Standing behind Steve his face was hidden from Tony’s viewpoint. Steve leaned over and whispered to his mother. Her wan features brightened, and she smiled, deeply and warmly at her son. Raising a quaking hand, she touched her son’s face. A soft cry sounded as Steve said, “Ma.” He grasped her hand to his face. Her smile drifted away with her strength and then she closed her eyes. Tony knew it was the moment, the memory that Steve held of his mother’s death.
“Ah! Nope. Do that and your hand will get all sticky.” Tony takes the fork from Steve and, with a knife, slices the waffles into cubes using the girdle pattern as lines. He impales a stack of cubes and then flies the waffles through the air, making zooming noises. “Open sesame!”
Deciding that he needs a better view, he starts to stand up but Steve scuttles after him. The sounds he makes are closer to words but not formed due to the rod in his mouth preventing him from speaking.
Tony followed the man through the dark hallway, noting the musty smell and the shag rug carpet. It looked like the basement had been an apartment at one time. The man tried a door, but it was locked, and he moved to the next one. The door swung open. Not much greeted them, but a pile of cushions on the floor. No blankets, no bed. Nothing. It would do.
The next thing he knows, he's sitting up in his bed, gasping for breath and a nurse is there comforting him. He doesn't want comfort, he wants his old life back - but then he realizes his old life isn't his - it's a figment, a fake. The doctors told him it is his mind trying to fill in the gaps left by the traumatic brain injury. His brain is filled with holes, gaping holes. Maybe that is why he's so cold. He thanks the nurse and she hesitates before she leaves him, observing him as if he's a fragile piece of ice about to shatter or melt away. Maybe he is.
“That was everything,” Tony says. He finds tears in his eyes. “It means everything to me, Steve. You mean everything to me.”
The man, the leader says a few words to Tony. Tony looks at Steve and says, “You don’t happen to know Farsi do you?”
“I don’t know what you mean? Like if you were a snake or a rabbit?” Tony scratches Blu behind his ear.
Steve eyed Thor sitting in the living room with both of Clint’s children on his lap. “No ill will for Thor?”
The mentions of vibranium switches his attention over to T’Challa. His father, T’Chaka, died in one of the major offenses last year. The Conclave Fleet held their systems, but with great cost. T’Challa has been calling for a cease fire due to the decimation of so many of the Beyond Regions.
Steve bowed his head as if shame overcame him. “Tony.” He peered up at Tony. “Back then I put it out of my head. You need remember most of my life, I lived as a sickly kid. I hoped to get through the next month, the next year. I put the idea of ever having
As he opened his eyes he found himself in the small tenement apartment again. For the first time, he felt safe and at home. The place might have been cringe-worthy at one point in time because of all of the old-fashioned furniture, the lack of modern technology, but what he sought was here. Steve.
“Sounds great.” Tony has his sunglasses off and his face lifted to the sun. “Tell me is the sky blue, is it a cloudless day?”
The words still reverberate through Tony's body like he's on a fast moving train readying itself for derailment. The words shake him and rip him up inside. Sometimes he thinks they are worse than the fact he's sitting in a cave in Afghanistan waiting for death. What happened after those moment are a blur for Tony. He'd left but always thought he would find a way back. It didn't happen. Two days later when he showed up at the apartment he stood on the street and looked up at the burnt out shell of a building. They'd gotten to Steve and his friends. They burned the building down. There were fatalities. Tony walked away, numb and frozen and wondering why the tears would not come.
“Have it your way, my dearest, I will miss you,” Tony crones at Steve as he leaves the quarters and heads back to his assigned rooms. He shouldn’t even play like this with Tony – it feels too familiar, too comfortable.
Steven shakes his head. “Does it matter?” He struggles to his feet, swaying a little as he does. He puts a hand to the wall. “Is that all, my lord?”
He sits back when he finishes. “All done.” He wants to sleep. “Those are going to be nasty wounds on your face and on your paws. Tomorrow we’ll try and clean them out a little more. I’m afraid my lack of natural information about plants is working against me. I don’t know anything like King’s Foil around here.” He chuckles but it falls hard. The exhaustion hits him, and Blu pulls him close and cuddles him. Falling asleep has never been as easy.
“It’s nice that Tony’s broadened his circle of ‘in the know’ friends,” Strange says and then pats the examining table. “Hop up, Tony.”
“No, he didn’t perish. He saved himself and a certain little girl,” Fury states and glares at Steven.
The guy regards Tony with inquisitive eyes, eyes that see too much. “Let’s just say we all went through a war.”
“Eat.” Logan places his half-devoured burger on the tray table and reaches for his shake. “I’m here to tell you something, Steve. Something important.”
Tony brushes a rough hand against Steve’s nipples and he shivers as his erection jolts against their bellies. Tony leans forward and tongues Steve’s nipple, then catches it with his teeth. Spears of pleasure race through Steve and he cries out. He’s always been extra sensitive. His response elicits excitement from Tony as he plays with one and pinches the other nipple between two fingers.
“I’m not squirming.” He denies it, but the truth is as soon as Tony said it, Steve consciously becomes aware of his fidgeting. “God, you’re right about that too.”
Since then Steve only gave passing thoughts to the possibilities of Tony’s powers developing. It meant nothing to him in the long run. When he was with Tony, his life and world centered on Tony, and Steve saw the same in Tony’s eyes. Those eyes that were the color of the Caribbean Sea or the wine dark ocean or the dark of the Earth. He could never tell, and Thor had once told him that Tony’s eye color would settle one day – when his powers emerged. That didn’t seem right since Natasha’s eyes still frequently changed.  When he quizzed Thor about it, the old vampire with the sky blue eyes only smiled and said powers develop and need time to mature. What would that mean to a woman who became shadow and mist?
Tony caresses Steve’s cheek. “Hey, hey. We do it slow. We go as far as you want. I can wait, Steve. I can wait as long as you need.”
“Well, sometimes you can’t fight the universe,” Steve said but he had to admit, a certain amount of pride and happiness warmed him.
Steve sniffs – realizing now that there are tears staining his cheeks. “No, no. Just want this – this to end. I don’t want us to hurt one another. Anymore. We play around one another all the time. We never-.”
Tony feels a gentle press on the small of his back and a touch to his arm. He hops off of the stool, but it just jolts his head and he moans in response. Steve waits for Tony, standing directly next to him. Feeling for his arm, Tony grasps it right above Steve’s elbow.
“God, I want to-.” Tony did. His mind begged him to be with Steve, it brought life to his body – a body that had died, had been undead, and died again. Now resurrected, he’d become something new and promising. All he needed was that match to fulfill him and show him more – show him life.
Finally they get to Steve’s floor. Steve directs Tony to the little hovel of an apartment where he entertains clients instead of the apartment he shares with his mysterious friends. Tony frowns and Steve catches his expression.
“Thermos of hot chocolate because Vision told me it would be cold. But mainly sandwiches and some fruit.”  He swings the backpack to the ground and pulls out the blanket. Spreading it on the rough ground, he narrates, “I put a blanket down, just behind you if you want to sit down. It’s in a patch of sunlight.”
That can only mean one thing - whatever's been going down has been in play for more than a few minutes. His pulse races and he swallows down the fear. He crouches down as he walks close to the building, listening to get an idea of what he's about to encounter. He can’t catch any noise, not outside. It means he needs to go in and that means he's committed to this foolhardy task.
“Steve,” Tony says and sits up. He doesn’t want to cool off the moment, but as he said there are practicalities. “I want you to listen to me. If we do this, then I want to know how far you want to go.   What you want to do. I don’t want to assume something and have this all come crashing down on our heads. It’s too important to me.”
“I didn’t think you believed in that kind of thing, that kind of hocus pocus. You always said it was for ancient days and fairy tales.”
Steve sniggers. “Maybe because you are – a little.” He races away, digging through the main closet under the stairs – where Tony never searched during his tour of their abode. “Here we go!” It’s red and gold and will fit Tony like a glove. He already knows. “What do you think?” Steve shows it off like he’s a proud father.
“I hope it does. It’s a lot like losing family when you lose a soul bond,” she returned. “So, now I have to ask – what are you going to do?”
“Well, be careful. We don’t need more people knowing your secret,” Tony said and accepted one last kiss before Steve departed.
He startles when a hand touches his shoulder, and he jerks awake. He blinks to see Tony hunched above him and his dream momentarily merges with the present. He gets half hard at the thought, but the cold sweeping in from the wreckage cools him fast enough.
Natasha was right. As he worked to put his soul pieces back together, Steve constructed a barrier, a wall that barricaded them away. He told himself that he needed to do it in order to keep his mind on the target, on what needed to be done. “Don’t worry. Just trying to focus.”
Instead, Blu mumbles a growl and then bites into the hind quarters of the deer. Tony flinches and turns away. He does not want to see that. He’d never been one to watch nature programs on television. Before Tony even turns around though, Blu drops a thigh at his side and then goes back to the carcass, tearing away the ribcage and turning his back on the fire, blocking Tony’s view of his meal.
“So, you’ve heard.” He wonders at her network of spies and who might be feeding her information from his clan. Tony cocks a brow and accepts a glass from one of the passing waiters. “One and the same.”
Steve bows his head and blinks rapidly trying to clean away the pain, the sorrow, the agonizing frustration. “And me?” He doesn’t look up at Tony.
“What the fuck for?” Over the line Tony hears a scrambling and then a huff and panting. Barnes is running. “I’m coming over there.”
“Maybe,” Steve says. Clint stayed on as Natasha’s navigator. He looks less hassled and more focused. He’s fairly famous for his invention of the hyper-skip; a maneuver that cuts considerable time off of interstellar travel by days or weeks depending on destinations and locales.
Bruce lifted a shoulder in a shrug. “Good as can be expected. Nat and I have been working on calming techniques for the Hulk. Seems to work.”
It’s the last time he’ll wear his glasses for nearly a month. It’s been years since he experienced total and abiding blindness. Instead of running for the hills, Tony wants to stay put and work on his upgrades, but even he isn’t that arrogant to not recognize the fact that he’s coming up to the finish line and he has to accept defeat. It’s going to take more than sheer willpower to fix the implant, to overcome the immune response, to fix his issues. Translating intelligently designed microchips into biochemical signals is the stuff of Noble prizes. The idea that Tony would succeed in a few months has always been ludicrous. Now he has to stop using the glasses for weeks so that when he re-appears in public to answer the media, he presents as a fully sighted man. If anyone figures out otherwise then he might lose his company and his fortune.
“But I saw the Outriders with Tony, how can you not be demons if the Outriders are here?” Steve’s memories of his time on Earth slowly coalesced and he recalled the horror of the Outriders swarming over Wakanda and the Avengers Compound. He knew pain and agony. He knew death and sorrow now.
“Doctor Cho said you might have some issues with vision and auditory artifacts. The serum didn’t play well with the interface.” Sam crosses his arms over his chest – a stance Steve always paired with him readying for battle. “You’re going to be okay, Steve. You know that, right?”
“No. You still have significant healing to do and you do have some scarring that’s not likely to go away. But you’re going to live. Don’t be fooled Tony, your recuperation is going to be difficult and long. That’s one of the reasons you’re in Wakanda. Plus, you saved the world So, there’s that.” Bruce smiles. “Oh and here he is.”
Clint hit the comm switch as he said, “Don’t worry. We got help coming in. They have a tracker in your uniform. Dump it. There’re some clothes in the back.”
Steve sat down on the couch, his plate heaping with pizza slices. “The Bucky reveal went horribly.” He put the plate on the coffee table. “Tony doesn’t like the idea of having Bucky as a pack mate –sounds like we are all dogs – someone who killed his parents.”
Steve presses his lips into a thin line and frowns. “If you don’t mind, I’d like to pass. I watched the first 20 minutes of Saving Private Ryan like a week ago and I’m still having nightmares.”
When he lands several of the men converge on him, gesturing and pointing. He’s not sure what they are saying but JARVIS translates for him.
Unbuckling the holster for his gun, he dumps it on the bureau, leaving his hat on the stand and his duster flung over the chair. He pulls off his boots and sets them at the foot of the bed. When he drops onto the cot to sit, he deflates as if he’s been holding out, not breathing for days. He strips off his shirt and folds it to set it aside. Lying back down on the cot he tries to chase sleep, but it’s a harsh and horrible foe these days. After Andersonville – everything became a test of wills. His life is segmented, split, before and after Andersonville.
“Keep comms open,” Steve said. “I don’t want anyone armed. I want us to go in as a pack, as a family. This is one of our members who is upset.”
Tony bursts out laughing, the shock and thrill bubbling over. He falls off the shield and lies in the snow drifts looking up at the perfectly blue sky. “How the hell can you do that? Why didn’t the shield sink? It’s physically impossible. I have a fucking million questions.”
“Just for dinner.” When Tony frowned at him, Steve only smiled. “Just joking. Meal’s on me. I’ll send you the address to the restaurant. It’s in Brooklyn. Hope you don’t mind.”
Happy huffs a little and shakes his head. “Sometimes, I don’t-. If the boss is up late, I’m up late. That’s the way I see it.”
Later when he crawled into bed, Tony didn’t pitch his soul outward to touch Steve. He left him alone for now. Tony needed to find his way and to recognize what he wanted from Steve before he bothered him again. His strategy would have worked, if he hadn’t woken up only hours later with a gut-wrenching agony of loss in his belly and the pain eating away his own grip on the world and sanity. He sat straight up in bed, wide awake. With his hand on his chest, he asked, “JARVIS, what’s going on?”
“Another Stark, actually another Tony Stark,” Steven says as a wash of sadness overcomes him. “It’s said that his omega sacrificed his gland to free him.”
“I can tell it’s bad because if the great Nick Fury is shivering in his black leather boots, something really horrible is lurking.”
“For my friend here, he’ll have a mango with an extra power pump. I’ll go berry with just the regular power pump,” Sam said. “Extra large for him. Large for me. Charge it to the room. 502.” The man nodded and began to prepare their drinks. Sam smiled at Steve. It wasn’t one of joy but of understanding. “Been a long few days.”
The overwhelming impact of the events blinded him to what Natasha and Clint had in mind as the elevator rose. Several minutes went by as it computed in his head. They were going up. They’d said they were going up. He embraced a lax Steve in his arms and shook his head.
“Considering they own the vast majority of water rights in the Inner Belts and run the lanes to the outer rims, I would say probably not.”
“Pepper and I-.” Tony muffles a curse. “Pepper and I co-parented yes. We married yes. Yes, we loved one another, but not the way- not how-.” He stops and tears stream down his face. “Not how I love you. Never. We are opposite sides of the same coin.” He violently wipes away the tears as if they are acid burning him. “Pepper knew, you know. She knew I loved you. We loved one another, yes, but it was never a romantic kind of love. We were friends and it worked. But we-.” He points between Steve’s chest and his own. “We had a chance.”
He shouldn’t care. Any time in the past when he cared he always ended up burned – either by himself or someone he thought he loved He didn’t even really know Steve as well as he knew someone like Pepper. He’d been in a relationship on and off with Pepper for years, and yet maybe he never really knew her. They weren’t cut from the same cloth. Pepper liked organized and safe activities. She hated Iron Man, not Tony, but she hated the idea of it. It scared her. Steve – well, Steve had to be the ultimate reckless hero. He consented to an unproven treatment to change him into a super soldier. He rushed in when others raced to safety. In some ways, Steve and Tony
Steve bowed his head and then looked up at Sam. “I can respect that. I’m sorry for your loss, Sam. I really am.”
“I don’t want this to come to blows,” Rhodes says and drops his hand. “But Stark Industries is officially your employer, not Tony. Ms. Potts is the CEO; she is within her rights to dismiss you.”
The slap of flesh against flesh and the grunt and hiss of an exhaustive exertion. Tony almost turns around and leaves but then he remembers the important revelations he had earlier. Captain America does this because he has no self-worth left. He's selling himself because he's lost a sense of purpose and hope. Tony climbs up and peers into the room.
“Sorry, sorry,” Tony says and places a hand on Steve’s shoulder. “I didn’t mean to bring up bad memories. Just the swim in the ocean helped them so much. It’s like a miracle or magic – neither of which I believe in. But, like, I’d say you healed by twenty or thirty percent. That’s amazing.”
“Nope, he would use it as a tool to help us remember. During class he’d play snippets of his favorite pieces and then during the exams he would play the entire aria or whatever he’d picked during his lessons.” Tony smiles. “That man was brilliant. Eccentric as hell. Doctor Erantrue. From then on, I loved opera. Used it a lot during my college years.”
“Not if I can’t get it into my mouth!” Steve retorts and attempts to pick it up with his hands again.
As they enter it, Steve notes it’s been cleared and probably swept for bugs and any other sort of tech that might be spyware. Skye is standing in the corner and salutes to Coulson as she leaves. She elbows Steve and winks before she disappears through the door. Coulson closes the door and locks it.
Tony picks up the dried meat and bread. He chews on it and points to the swell of land around them. It's colored in tones of brown and streaked with an occasional green or orange. “They say the west is beautiful land but I would say formidable. It's outstanding and lovely yes, but the dogwoods, and sagebrush are hiding the real dangers don't you think, Sheriff?”
Tony didn’t want to drink. He wanted his physical body to stop, but at the same time it warmed him. He hadn’t realized how very cold he’d been as a wraith. The winds stopped, and a rush of power flowed through him. He bathed in it. A feeling as wonderful as the sun used to be spread through him. It suffused through him until his muscles revitalized and grew, until his flesh regenerated and stitched itself back together. He hadn’t known he’d closed his eyes, but when he opened them again, he was no longer a wraith, but in his body drinking the bounty of his life. The thick elixir soothed his parched throat, brought back his nerves and dried out organs. A blossom of life bloomed throughout his undead corpse.
“Memory stretches your link to the Soul Keeper. It causes pain and whiteouts. Something Tony said must have triggered it for you,” she says. Her hands work deftly to calm and quiet him. “Everything’s well now. Think nothing of it. Do not dwell, Steven. Do not dwell.”
“Yeah, I can understand that,” Tony said. He took the nozzle of the faucet and washed out the sink. “I stopped making weapons of war. That was a hard thing to do. I hadn’t ever thought about what it would mean. Never. I just did.”
Tony’s going to have to look up this Natasha person at some point. He leans back, bracing himself on his elbows on the bed. “Aren’t you a little uncomfortable with the idea of possibly being watched?”
“It’s good because we also have more members that will probably need your help.” Steve said. “It seems the pack is something more now. It’s changing. For years it was just you, me, and Nat. Peggy a bit. Now we have Tony, Sam, Clint, Bucky – and that man and woman who attacked the train.”
Thor remained calm, almost passive, as he listened to Tony. “Perhaps there is somewhere we could talk? Your mate needs his rest.”
“Yes. I didn’t want him to find out and then realize that was the reason the project failed. He was kind, quiet. He never said anything about it, only had me promise not to act on it. Ever. And to this day, I’ve kept my promise.” He shoves in a large chunk of bread, chewing the monster with exaggerated care.
“You’re hurt.” Tony tries to convince him again. “You, all of you could come to my house – or any of my houses. I have a few. Anywhere in the world. I could help you, please let me help you.”
“He likes a big thick juicy steak. I’m afraid he’s an all American meat and potatoes kind of guy.” It’s Tony. Of course. Walking in and cracking jokes like nothing has happened between them.
“But you’ve already done so much for me. Gotten me out of that hospital, saved me from spending the rest of my life as a lion-.”
He heads into the light and finds out that someone amongst the terrorists has lined the cave with crude electrical wiring that must go to a generator somewhere. He follows the cables to a small den at the back of the caverns. As he approaches the darkened area near the back of the den, he hears the clank of chains and a strange ruffling sound that he cannot place.
He wants to scoff at the prince, but he manages to hold that back. “Dreams change, I think, my prince.”
Instead of surrendering, Steve rams his fist straight into the side of Bucky’s neck. The doppelganger staggers away from his hunched position over Steve. Reluctance swept away, Steve surges to his feet. He forgets the pain blossoming like a burning sun over the side of his face. His fists collide with Bucky’s throat, his face, his ribs. In a fury he activates the shield and rams it into the imposter’s chest. Bucky spits up blood into Steve’s face, splatter over his mouth and nose. All Steve smells is copper and dust and cold taste of death. He falls back and tries to get to his feet. A dozen people appear at the different entrances their little cavern in the maze. They’re in various states of decay and the putrid stench fills the enclosed space. Steve’s eyes water at the sting of the air.  He puts the back of his hand of his mouth and nostrils. His cheekbone pounds in agony. Regardless of how many times he says it’s all in his head, his body rebels and tells him otherwise.
The rational part of his brain attempted to alleviate the shame and the revulsion, but his body responded to the injection from her feeding gland. It shouldn’t be this way. It could only mean she had been feeding for a long time. A quiet sip, a long drink wouldn’t elicit this kind of reaction from a human’s body. She’d drank and then purposefully injected the arousal agent.
When it came to it, he couldn’t voice his fears, not in the details he needed to in order to make Rhodey understand. “Nothing. Just wanted to check in and make sure all was good, considering everything that happened today.”
“Not sure.” Bruce rolled his head back and forth on the back of the chair. “I was just standing there and suddenly I’m in the middle of a forest and Nazis are shooting at me. I can hear the ping ping of the bullets off my shield, and the stench of blood and oil burning my nostrils. All around me carnage. But I have to lead the survivors from the concentration camp I liberated to safety. They’re weak. So weak.” He put a hand over his face. “It was terrible. The smell.” He gagged a little and Tony swore he saw a little green shift over his chest and forearm.
With no other strategy to find a way into having a role in this play, Steve latched onto the one thing that had bugged him since he moved to DC. “What about Clint?”
“Don’t stop!” Tony commands. His eyes are wild with the chase. Steve cannot hear anyone behind them, but that’s not the game anymore. The game has no rules or restrictions.
“Not that I know of, but these damned scientists are always hopping and skipping around the systems like there’s no fucking galactical war going on.” Tony rubs Steve’s shoulder, gripping it without much tenderness. “This conference has to go better than it is for this war to turn.”
“No, Bruce, you have your own problems. I can deal with my problems, with Stane and the rest of them without you having to sacrifice anything.”
Tony’s hand never leaves his shoulder; in fact, it tightens his grip. “You kept secrets before Rogers, now isn’t the time. Not when we’re here. Our future depends on you. Our future, if we have one, depends on you and the truth.”
Steve beams, kissing Tony hotly and fully. “I want to warn you I have a notoriously short recovery period.”
Tony finds himself splayed out on the bed, open and wide as Steve tastes and licks along the cleft of his ass. He shivers and falls into that delicious space of need. It burns every one of his nerves and he cannot make a coherent sound as Steve’s tongue breaches him. He goes wild wanting to fuck and be fucked. Steve is right there – accommodating but just a furious with need. He thrusts into Tony with a fierce intent, his eyes open and watching at all times – until the very end when he throws his head back and spills into Tony – filling him, filling him up until he thinks he might burst. He cries out from the heat and the pressure and comes as Steve strokes him fast and hard.
“I don’t- I-.” Steve stopped. “Okay it’s early but they want to spend a good three hours to start. They might stay for another session on Friday. If that’s okay?”
Fury took charge and, for once, Steve was happy he didn’t have to order the team and figure out what their next move might be. “Okay, show’s over. We’d like you and Doctor Banner in the infirmary immediately for confirmation tests.”
“Is there a problem with the reactor?” Tony concentrates on the readouts of his implanted arc reactor. It’s functioning at capacity and within range.
The notification system works, and he hears a slight buzz through the tiny bones in his ear. Eventually the system chimes again.
“By denying yourself. By not finding love?” Tony forgets his bowl and wine glass. He forgets the delicious bread. “All this time, you’ve been alone.”
It dug into him but he allowed the mistaken conclusion. It would be easier that way. Tony didn’t need to know that Steve loved him, but looking at him and talking to him was like a caricature of his former self. He’d wanted to discuss his pain, how Tony as a Courtesan had invaded Steve’s life, and then slowly unwound it, teasing out all the knots, and straightening his head and his heart. Tony as a Courtesan was different than Tony, Sir Stark, or Tony the Engineering genius. Tony as a Courtesan had a mission.
Tony slaps him on the arm. “What do you say, we go get some coffee. Maybe something to eat. Feed that serum of yours.”
“He was delirious with fever and we all love it when he gets like that,” Bucky says and glowers at Steve. “So not only did I get you a blacksmith, but I also got you a doctor in the deal.”
"Shouldn't look like this." He hears the doctor state as he pulls out what looks like viscous green pus.
“You know I swear I’ve seen you before. I just don’t know where,” Rumlow says and tilts his head a little to examine Steve. “What kind of assistant are you?”
The toast pops up and Steve ignores it to flip the bacon. “I don’t know. I just thought you were going to retire to a farm with Pepper.”
“You are going to be the death of me!” Tony says and gestures to Steve. “Please lead the way to The Cage – and I hope I don’t get any ideas considering the name of the place.”
“Going back to work, someone has to protect the town,” Steve says, and then digs out a shirt. It isn’t his best one, but then again, he doesn’t have much in the way of ‘best ones’. He slips it on with a wince, and then buckles on his holster.
He slashes at the connection to the vessel. He knows full well he will bleed and bleed a lot, but he can sacrifice a little blood for this.  He sways as the nausea of pain over takes him. It’s almost too much, it almost stops him. But he seizes the gland in one hand and does one more brutal cut as he screams out from the pain. It’s done. In seconds it’s done and he throws the useless gland in the sink. He didn’t leave the root like the scientists did. It shouldn’t grow back. For minutes he stands there, gripping the edge of the sink and staring at the gland – his bonding gland. Blood stains it, stains the porcelain of the sink.
His mind racing, Tony says, "We only have one shot at this. I don't think we'll be able to go far. We have enough fuel to scorch the place and then hightail it out of here. I'm thinking it's going to fly us about a mile or so, if we're lucky and I arc it right."
Tony stays quiet for a moment and then clears his throat. “It was a mistake. Not to do it before.” His voice, his tone sounds stilted as if he’s having a hard time finding the words and the right emotion to go along with them. “I didn’t mean to alienate you.”
“We have a lot to discuss,” Tony says. “But I want to start with something simple. Well, not as simple as all that, but simple enough.”
“Weird,” Tony inserted.  He looked like he might fall over, crumple and just disintegrate. Steve empathized. “Very, very weird.”
The nurse checked their vitals and hooked them up to several monitors, half of which Steve still couldn’t name. He itched to get out of the infirmary, go back to his apartment, and try and forget the last 70 years happened.  Once the nurses and the doctors filtered away, Bruce cleared his throat and declared, “You know, I’m not that kind of doctor.”
Taking a cookie and the mug, Tony sits back. The instrumental music plays lightly in the background. “Merry Christmas, Steve.”
“Whoa there, you’re okay,” the voice says again. “Can you drink? The doctor will be here soon. It would be good if you could drink a little water.”
Tony licked his lips and nodded. “I know.” He looked around the pale room. The bed with the broken head board, the lamp without a shade, the tacked up wooden planks on the windows – how he wanted desperately to spend time with Steve at his hidden house far from madness of the city. Away from the vampire district as it shrank with each and every new rule and law the humans put into place. He wanted to offer everything to Steve, but what he had, the laws made him conceal.
Wong launches into a historical brief about Pym and his nanotechnology that he calls Pym particles – the arrogant son of a bitch (Wong’s words not Tony’s).  Apparently, Pym uses computer learning with the nanotech pym particles to teach them to appropriately identify the correct target. The particles are too small to load the package and too many cause an immune attack as Strange informed Tony. The possibilities and the potential are mind blowing. Surprisingly, Wong is able to impart all of the details verbally with only a few braille aids that happened to be sitting in Tony’s lap.
“We can’t go and find water until I get the rest of the armor.” Tony points to the scattered pieces strewn all over the ground. “Do you think you could go and get the rest?” He must have hit his head a lot harder than he thought; he’s talking to a lion like he’s a person.
Tony clasps his hand. “Sure, it does.” When Steve looks up at Tony, he continues, “You miss her. You miss your life. You never talk about it. Not at all. You can, if you need to, you know.”
They pause of a minute, both of them panting and fighting for breath. “Wh-what do you mean you hacked him?”
The waves roll and move onto the white pink shore of the island. Emeralds and greens mix with azure and deeper calmer blues to welcome him as he steps into the waters. It’s warm, though he quakes and trembles at the water’s touch. His wings drag into the water and he releases his hold on Tony, submerging himself into the ocean’s arms.
When she exits, a nurse enters and checks on Steve. She’s quiet and comforting but Steve can only think about what’s transpired. How did he lose control of so much and so quickly? He needs to find the strength to get up and to tell them both – both alphas – that he’ll make his own decisions. He cut out his gland for a reason and whether or not they find it reasonable isn’t their decision to make. He grapples to get upright, but fails. The nurse is by his side, telling him to remain still. He collapses back onto the pillows and sinks into oblivion from effort.
Tony hoists himself up onto Steve’s back as the Hulk howls. Without delay Steve secures Tony to him, using his bent knees as anchors. Taking the grappling hook, he aims then throws. The hook catches and slides into place.
“I’m about to go through presentation and I need an alpha.” He’d said it like that – how else should he have done it? He put his cards on the table.
“Well, you guys are Beloved and all that,” Sam said. He didn’t look at Steve as he spoke. “He was probably waiting for you to get your head out of your ass.”
“Great, great.” Tony squinted as the sun peaked through the branches of the pine trees. “Did Steve call?” By necessity, Happy knew about Tony’s mate.
Through a mouthful of popcorn, Steve remarks, “Yeah. I couldn’t believe you slept through it yesterday.”
“Steve, yes. Bring him back on Thursday. Let’s get the non-disclosure ready for him to sign. Also, bring in the best biochemist in the States, and see if he can impart Steve with some knowledge. Also bring in a stats person, too. He’ll need to do some heavy studying if he’s going to help with the project.” Tony stops then because even talking causes his head to throb in percussion to his voice. He closes his eyes and takes off the glasses, a slight hum issues from the frames. “How long was it?”
“Yes,” Steve says and stiffens as he glimpses a wary expression fleetingly exposed on Tony’s face and then his candid expression disappears and he tugs on Tiberius’ arm.
“Well,” Bruce said as he shrugged. “I understand a little about being completely cut off from everything I know and love.”
The Red Knight screams and cries out in horror. “No! No! Steve! Why, you fucking idiot?” The Red Knight holds him in his arms as the blood pours out of the gash. “You fucking idiot. Natasha is going to kill me.”
He got out the SUV and walked around it to the small interface. It asked for his handprint. “I don’t know if this will work.” Tony knew it would. His father required a new handprint every few years from him. Even though it had been decades since his last scan he was sure it was on file. Even here. He placed his hand on the scanner. A whirl of mechanics and then an infrared light flashed over his fingers then palm. It took too long but then again this was old equipment. It buzzed and the gates growled a response as they began to open.
“Yes, but everything’s fine. I have my rescue inhaler and that’s not why I’m calling you,” Steve says and drops back onto the bed.
“You’re different.” Tony leans his head back, staring through the lenses of his glasses at the specimen before him. It’s supposed to be an interview – one of great importance and he should probably take it more seriously – but the fact remains that a god just walked through the door, and while the gods allow Tony Stark plans on relishing and coveting such beauty.
“Because of Tony Stark,” Steve says and shakes his head. “How can this possibly be that bad?” Steve knows his history, he understands what’s at stake with each soul.
Bucky tries not to imagine the hell that Steve has gone through all these months or the fact that he had to fight the Scholars themselves to be allowed to search for him. The Jedi Scholar Peggy had seemed the most approachable.
Tony warns him and tries to pull away, but Steve holds firm and then he’s drinking down the bitter taste of Tony. Swallowing and sucking at the same time so that Tony quakes against him.
“Well, I haven’t really seen her so I’m just going to go with yes.” He thumbs back to the bathroom. “I’m gonna get dressed.” Slipping away quickly, Steve gathers the clothes from the tiny closet and closes the door. He rushes to the mirror. “Tony? Tony are you there?”
“There’s planning for the future and then there’s dealing with the risk. What’s the risk, Tony? You said you had a traumatic brain injury that caused your blindness. What happens if you have a stroke? What happens if the stroke leads to more brain injury?” Steve shakes his head. “I’m sorry, I know I don’t know you well or anything, but what I’ve seen so far-.” He drops off and then sits down, staring out.
“You’ve been talking to the kid too much with your pop culture references. We can’t just download a virus on a killer AI who has control of the entire world right now. Trust me, this is the best way.”
Turning on his side to lock eyes with Steve, Tony touches his face as well. His thumb drags along Steve’s lower lip. Pain and hope mix in Tony’s features so often it scars him with a haunted look. Steve reaches up and gently pushes back the curls of his hair that fall into his face. As he moves to kiss Tony, a low ping resonates in the room.
“Howard was drunk. Really, really drunk. So, you know how it is kids, don’t drink and drive. Well, dear old dad didn’t listen.” Pepper leans in and whispers in his ear. He nods and raises a hand. “My lovely CEO – Pepper Potts – isn’t she the best?”
Someone was talking to him and then stroked his arm. “Steve? Steve? Are you okay?” Tony asked. The red of his irises shone bright as if the fear and anger roiling inside of Steve boiled in Tony as well. “Do you need to sit down?”
The doctor – Bruce – hunches over the cot where Bucky has been hold up like some kind of imbecile – or lunatic rambling and mumbling about ghosts and phantoms that are not there. Sometimes, Bruce needs Steve to push Bucky down, to hold him in place as they wrench open his mouth and dose him with something to calm his nerves.
Even his friend Sam Wilson, a former slave, went westward when the war ended. He didn’t wait around looking for opportunity in a land overrun by carpetbaggers and former slave owners looking to shore up their wealth and status in a post-slavery world. The West presented a fresh start for many.
“When I’m your fake boyfriend, you’ll have to share it with me.” Tony smiles but it drifts away from his face.
“I’ll boil some more water for more pasta,” he said. He filled the largest pot with water and started the stove top again.
“No, not crazy at all,” Strange said as he peered at the braided welts on Steve’s wrist. “It happened when I fought Dormammu.”
Steve glances at Bucky and completes Clint’s words. “Clint’s right, once Schmidt diverts the river we’re as good as dead.”
“Nat?” Steve asked over the lines but he didn’t need an answer – she returned calming waves that signaled she and Clint were well in hand with their backup. “Move on the base!”
He opened his eyes to Tony bending over him. Others were present as well, but he only felt Tony’s hands on him. He tried to speak but the sight of Tony’s tears stopped him.
He was in his own room. The windows peered out to the large cityscape of 21st century Manhattan again, not early 20th century Brooklyn tenements. Manhattan at pre-dawn greeted him. His whole body shook, trembled hard against the dream. Or was it a nightmare? He thought for sure he would be wet after his dream fuck. But he wasn’t. He was flaccid but warmed by the after effects of an amazing orgasm.
Pep joins him at the window and says, “I’m a beta. I don’t have to take on the worries of the world like alphas and omegas do. You have to decide if it’s better to like your omega or to punish him.”
“Everyone else needs training. Not everything can be dumbed down for you, Obie,” Tony spits back and Steve clamps a hand over his mouth not to laugh at Stane’s aghast expression.
“Yes, son, you’re not a spy. Then what exactly did Agent Rumlow find you doing with that bracelet?” Obie crosses his arms.
“Listen, lady, I’m not in the mood. I’ve been cooped up here for months, I need a bath, and I’m about to get my head blown off because I refuse to build these morons a bomb.”
Tony reaches out, his hand stretching. He’s waking and the doctors are on alert. Steve scowls at them and they give him space. He touches Tony’s hand. “I’m here, sweetheart. Open your eyes.” He tells himself Tony’s all right. There’s no sign of any brain damage. All the scans are clear. “Tony?”
“I don’t think that was my doing,” Steve said. Otherwise, if it was, then Steve would have to come face to face with the fact that he chose Tony – a man – for his Beloved.
“It has in that the glands are still functional. Look at it. It clearly wants to get off of the gurney. It’s seeking the spilt blood.”
Steve frowns. Some of the memories both Tony and Natasha wove for him clearly materialize in his head. He cannot dispute their claims. But the reality that they spin constricts him, feels like a too small coat. “It doesn’t make much sense. Where are we if we’re dead. Is this some kind of purgatory?”
Tony noticed the glare from Natasha and she grasped Bruce’s hand, stopping him from following Hill. “Right now, we need you to take care of Tony. Steve’s in the best hands.”
“Not again with the picnic.” Tony grabs Steve’s arm and uses a standard white cane as they take to the footpath.
“Oh Blu? That’s what they called him. He was seen all over Europe for so many years.” She tucked the blankets around him. It was a chilly May day. “Many people said he had an intelligence in his eyes. That he would try his best to interact with people, but it never worked. People always saw him as the beast he was. So, he disappeared into the forests. When he was seen again, Blu acted more and more like an animal. He scared people away from him. Some said he even attacked people, but no one had any evidence. They only knew the stories of him helping people.”
Tony jolts and grimaces. Wolverine is eating again – in his lab – again. “Yes, no. I’m not sure. From what I can tell the nanites or whatever the technology was that interfaced with the God Machine did it on a quantum level. That led to the collapse of the God Machine and the entrapment of the Ornari and Steve in the field.”
“Yeah, it’s really me. And to prove it to you, we both figured out where Loki was going to be during the Chitauri attack when we were talking about Coulson’s death. Pretty sure my bastard robot son doesn’t know that.”
She grips his hand and comforts him. “No. It is not Valhalla, though that realm is not your Christian idea of heaven. I don’t think any of us truly understand the nature of death.” She pats his hand. “I arrived after my ascension and knew that was something wrong because the way to Valhalla was blocked.”
“I didn’t say that, Tony. This isn’t just about the Board or the media. It’s about you and what makes you happy. When you came home from your last disappearance with a husband, I thought you’d lost it, but then I saw you.” Pepper giggles a little as if she’s keeping a secret. “And you looked at him so sweetly, so much in love.”
“Yeah,” Bruce said with a nod. “Yeah.” He shook his head then and muttered, “I’m really not that kind of doctor. I’m not a healer.”
Tony grimaced as he said, “I can’t get any read out from JARVIS about where they are or where Natasha might be.” He tapped a communications earbud he had in his right ear. “Nothing. I can’t fucking believe they got into my AI.”
Tony grabbed him, halting his motion to open the door. “What the hell, Steve? You’re practically falling down on your feet. They can shoot me and nothing’s going to happen.”
She pushes the bowl of stew back to him as he tries to place in on the small table next to the bed. “You need your strength.”
“God, I know,” Tony said as he slid his hand up to cup Steve’s cheek. Blood tears glistened in those strangely alien eyes. “I know. I just want to be with you. I want to hold you. I want those bastards to never have touched you.”
“Hill, can you do anything to help out?” Natasha asked, seemingly ignoring Tony. Yet the streams from her soul – and, fuck, he read her soul – tensed like a cocked gun that was ready to fire. Her outward appearance belied the underlying worry.
When the boat docks, a tall, lanky man with multi-colored clothing greets them. “Sir, it’s great to have you back.”
The newly crowned King of Wakanda sent an offer to the Avengers. The world had previously categorized Wakanda as a developing nation, but with the death of T’Challa’s father by the hands of Strucker, things changed rapidly. From Tony’s review of the news, he knew that there had been a violent upheaval and challenge to the throne. T’Challa had settled the dispute, though he admitted that closing off Wakanda and not bettering the world for all under privileged people was a mistake of the past. When Wakanda called, not about Barnes’ arm, but about his psychological health all bets were off. Steve jumped at the chance to give back his Brother a normal life – Tony stayed quiet.
Thank you all for going on this ridiculous journey with me. Okay it's not ridiculous but I am giggling all the time as I write this fusion of Pretty Woman and MCU in SPACE (imagine my voice echoing on the last word).
“Do you think I could -.” He inhales and then exhales – speaking quickly before he losing his nerve. “Do you think I could touch your face? I want to know-.”
“I thought you would know what to do, since, you brought, you know Dug home.” Tony thumbs it behind him to the sleeping (admittedly fat) dog on the bed in the corner of the living room.
Tony winked at him and then went down. He gave some of the best fellatio, and he opened his soul to Steve, exposed, bare, and yearning as he deep throated Steve. Steve gasped a moan out and Tony groaned around his erection. It took no time at all for Steve to find his natural state, put his hands onto Tony’s head, and hold him in place as he petted his hair. He made little noises that went right to Tony’s groin and if Steve didn’t stop sometime soon, Tony might go off right now.
The electricity running through his arm ceases and he immediately turns, hits the clip on his cuff, and throws the shield with all due prejudice. It collides with Hulk’s head hard enough for him to wobble and then pitch backward. Steve watches as the shield disintegrates into the millions of nanobots only to lift in the air, reform, and fly to his arm clip.
“I could say it’s easy, but it isn’t.” Tony spread his arms wide and the display disappeared to be replaced by a litany of equations. Numbers and operations fell around them. “It’s not easy. But what I did was sit and feel it. Sounds a little hippie but it’s true. I told you I was able to manipulate the soul energies by following the resolution to an equation. So, let’s look at an easy one.” He pulled an example of one of his equations. “Each soul has numerous unknowns. But you have to assume some of the unknowns are the same between people. So, we remove those.” He wiped some of the unknowns away. “Then I wrote out some equations to represent specific characteristics. Confidentiality, companionship, mentorship. All of that for example. Each identity has each of these some more than others. If you knew anything about role playing games, you could call these character traits or something like that.”
“How am I supposed to find this route. Tony’s been there numerous times, and he can’t just close his eyes and pop he’s there.” Bruce looked green. Not only Hulk green, but nauseous green.
“What can I tell you, I’m off the clock,” Steve smirks at Tony. “Come on, we’re going to have fun and you’re going to like it.”
And that’s when Steve’s fears ratchet up. He starts to worry that Tony’s not here by Steve’s side because of some deep emotion, but rather to keep an eye on him, to take him in, to hand him over to Ross. If Tony’s in Wakanda, that means Bucky’s not safe. Abruptly he tugs at his hand, trying to remove it from Tony’s but he flails more than anything and fails.
Right now he ignores all the alarms and warnings. But they are there. So blatant and glaring. A hooker. A man with the same history as Captain America, a man who just might be a resurrected Steve Rogers. The screaming of the alarms would terrify any sane person away from this path.
Natasha smirked in a rueful way. “I wish. I can’t bring you to a different dimension. I can’t do that with any human. It would kill you.” She eased over to sit on the side of the bed. The bed that was in a medbay but a medbay without equipment in a Helicarrier that looked like it was stripped down to the nuts and bolts. She kept her hands to herself, but the presence, her weight on the bed centered him, focused the room on her. “Once a vampire transforms, we leave that world behind.”
“What?” Tony says and narrows his eyes at her as if she’s out of focus. The whole world is out of focus.
He pads around on the ground like a blind man, and then picks up the battery again. Tony tugs at his sleeve and beats at his chest.
He keeps whistling, even in the fierce wind, trying to call out for Shield. He hopes the horse hasn’t broken her leg, or slipped a shoe. Out here, he’d have to shoot the horse if the leg is broken or even sprained. There’ll be no two ways about it.
Tony finished up his work and then turned to Steve. “Jarvis and Ana stepped in when my parents didn’t seem interested. Don’t fault my mom. Dad always had her on a string, trying to get her to do what he wanted. She would ask if we could have Christmas together, he would promise and then boom, something at work pulled him away. Eventually, she couldn’t overcome the depression and loneliness. Ana took care of my mom as much as she took care of me. They were great friends.”
“I’m sorry. I’ve done some stupid things over the last month and a half. I didn’t know better. I hope you understand I have good intentions.”
“Yeah that paradoxical time stuff can be a little nauseating,” Tony said. “Where is your soul mate now?”
“Steve?” he cried out and the tears he wept somehow materialized his lost love in front of him. Steve lay before him, battered, wounded, and bleeding out.
The fact she’s laid it out like background for a battleplan, actually helps thaw his brain a little. “It’s a little more complicated. Apparently, Howard, my dad, made a move on Steve back in the day-.”
“Most probably because they played with time. You, Steve, and the other me, we twisted time, entangled it within the singularity and warped it. It’s the only explanation,” Tony says. “They didn’t erase the past, they just trapped it with the Ornari and the other Steve.”
“I’ve been trying to learn more about it. Not just about the hot sex and stuff we’re missing out on. But what it means overall. I do my homework,” Tony said as the firelight flickered over him.
aren’t particularly keen on it.” Blu’s face twitches and he throws the clothes down, and then stomps off. “What the -. What a fucking diva. Just my luck I get stuck in the middle of nowhere with a prude.” Tony retrieves his gauntlet and puts it on then manages to climb up the slight incline without snapping off his cock. He snatches the clothes and heads to their camp. “Serves you right for stealing my clothes. What did you think was going to happen?” He steps into his underwear and then his black undersuit pants.
“It’s okay, I just have to see-.” A tie-fighter spots them and it zeroes its flight pattern toward them. “Shit. Shit.” He taps on the ear bud again and thanks all the ancient Jedi that it didn’t drop out of his ear in the water. “Clint, we are under attack.”
Steve faced Tony. He was shorter than Tony. He looked like he hadn’t had a decent meal in weeks. His pallor looked as bad as his mother’s.
“-dropped - shield. At your request.” His words feel strong his mouth and the room silences as he finishes. “Find a new omega, Tony. Find a new captain.” He turns away, facing Natasha. She lifts her chin to signal to Tony and Steve hears him leave the room.
Steve’s stomach doesn’t quite catch up to the shuttle’s motion until they’re well out into the open space of the cosmos. He manages to swallow down the need to vomit and praises whatever beings look after the universe to have forgotten to eat lately. Of course, that’s not good for his many different medical conditions, but once again he loathes the idea of puking all over Tony or these fine instruments.
Bucky threw his hand up in the air. “What do you want from me? My blessing? Well, excuse me if I’m still processing the fact that my best friend is -.” He stopped dead, swallowing the words.
“Shock?” Steve cries out and grabs Tony. Even though he can still feel the tremors Steve ignores them. He tears away the jacket, the buttons of Tony’s shirt, rips away the undershirt to reveal the mechanical device in his chest. “What the hell is it, Tony?” Tears stream down Steve’s face and mix with the flakes of snow. The snow picks up, the wind slices through him and he shivers in response.
It isn’t Steve who answers Tony. It’s the Alternate Steve, the one that’s too perfect, too godly and arrogant. “I knew. I always knew. I’ve known for years and I’ve hidden it. Not to find him. He’s a lost cause.” The image of Bucky as the Winter Soldier fades away. “I did it for this moment. To have this power over you. Why else would I hide it? I’m a strategist, a planner. I know how to win a war, Stark. This is who I am. You needed to be put in your place. I kept it in my back pocket just for this time. You think we don’t know who you really are? You think we don’t know it’s you who are fooling the whole world into thinking it’s Ultron and not you dabbling in the networks to control everything. You think we don’t know.”
“God, I hope not,” Steve muttered. He truly hoped Sam or anyone else in the pack weren’t privy to all of his dreams. He placed a plate of cookies on the table. Sam snatched one right away and drove for the coffee like an addict.
“Agent Coulson,” she says and then turns down the air conditioning unit again. “There’s nothing more to tell. Go and see his grave, my friend, maybe along with Captain America you can pay your respects to them.” She nods and he takes that as his signal to leave.
Steve gets up and helps Tony onto the bed properly. He disrobes in front of Tony and then sidles up to him in the bed. They silently touch and explore one another. It’s a small thing and after Steve heated him so much, Tony’s not sure he wants to wait, but it’s something that Steve needs. He’s always been so cognizant of his strength and his power – that it frightens him. Tony’s tried to calm him, comfort him about it, but the nightmares he has about his time as a beast always come back, always terrorize him.
A large animal leans on his chest, gnaws at it and he squirms and fights to get free. His arms feel like lead and Steve batters at the bulk of the beast with flailing arms unable to push the animal off him. The gaping hole in his gut burns. Tears stream down his face and he hears someone crying, someone weeping for the pain. It’s him. Of course, it’s him. He forces his hand into a fist and beats on the hulking form of the beast. His efforts are to no avail. The thing devours him. He wants it to rip his throat out to silence the pathetic noises escaping him.
“Erratic? What?” Steve straightens, forgetting the stretch and pain in his chest. “What the hell happened?”
By the time they head back toward the Avengers ship, Tony’s hand are sticky with some gooey treat he also decided to buy and his popsicle has taken a header off the upper gantry of the Concourse and splattered all over the floor. Thankfully, it missed everyone below – much to Tony’s chagrin.
“A schism only declares your intent to diverge from the Conclave’s current path. We could be supplying the -.”
The man rattles the chains around his wrists and, for a second, Tony thinks he might be able to break them. His arms, though, are like twigs. Long and thin. His muscles and sinews are stark and reedy. Tony can imagine his broad shoulders and unblemished back thick with muscles. Even that thought sends him into a tailspin of need. He shifts on his heels and sees that even though the man before him hangs in a vulnerable position, and scowls at Tony, his cock stands ramrod straight and dripping between his legs.
Steve shook his head. “It’s not that simple.” Could he bare his soul to Sam? Did Sam already know, considering that his life had been intertwined with Sam’s by some universal force? “You know I consider you a companion, Sam. I’m not only talking about Companion as in soul pack, but that I considered you a friend before you accepted being in the pack.”
That’s when he shifted his gaze to Natasha. The blurriness of her soul’s energy focused like a laser beam. All those times that Tony had tried to figure out what was different about her – he finally understood. This wasn’t her first bonding – she had another that, somehow, had been torn from her. What Tony experienced now was that tear being sown, repaired. She held onto Barnes as if she clasped her own Beloved. It startled him, and he looked at Steve in question.
Tony doesn’t say he was either extremely tired or trying his best performance in avoidance. He points to the large screen plastered on the wall. “I think you’ll like this one.”
Steve bends down, taking Tony’s mouth. They kiss tentatively at first and then hungrily, biting and nipping, searching for a way to be more than just two mortal beings, to be one being made of two souls. They break and panting Steve says, “We do it together.” Whatever comes next after the realm.
Steve settles back, content. “And no, for some reason, I didn’t really worry about the project. I saw it as the possibility of curing me more than anything else. I walked around with a heart issue, a lung issue. All kinds of allergies. There was diabetes in my family so I was worried that would become a reality. Every winter could have been my last.”
Years ago there had been an attack on an embassy in Bogota. The political ramifications echoed through the administration as the tensions over the kidnapping of high level government officials grew. How it ended had always been a question. The administration at the time thanked Canada for its assistance in rescuing and delivering the hostages to safety. The government of Bogota cried foul, saying there had been an attack on their soil and even petitioned the UN to investigate. It was quietly swept under the carpet but not before a name floated to the top of the news. A Nicolas Fury sanctioned an attack on foreign soil. The whole thing could have exploded but the Nick Fury they were looking for had died in a mysterious plane crash weeks before the hostage situation ever took place. It should have knocked Tony onto a different investigative path. Yet it niggled at him like a brain worm, like he kept hearing
“It has to be something. This is Ultron’s outer rim. You said it yourself before we even attempted this little mission, that Ultron’s devious and that he’s going to play games with us. This is a game, Tony, a game.”
“I wanted to check in on you. I realize that the other day was tough for you,” Steve said and he watched as Tony narrowed his eyes as if he had a microscope and tried to discern Steve’s inner workings. “This is all a mess. I’ll give you that, but you have to come into it with an open mind.”
“While he was monologuing this time, I went ahead and dove straight into his brains. I figured we might be close enough to the Hub for me to try. I did. I couldn’t do much damage, not without him noticing, but I got there soon enough to stop him from killing you.”
Yet, he never lost consciousness. He opened his eyes to a world dark and muddy. The fortress disappeared and above him a hole in space pulsed violet. Swarms of ships like the ones from the Chitauri attack on New York bled through the wound in the Earth’s sky. It never drew his attention, because the pain in his chest crippled him, dropped him to his knees. The pain brightened the world, but not with joy, with a horrifying, scorching agony. All the bonds were gone. His pack torn, shredded from him and then he saw them. Saw a mountain of death and glossy eyed stares where his family, and love had been. He walked the mount of the dead. It put his heart asunder and his soul to ash as he reached out to touch the Beloved bond. The bond. It flaked away, like particles of sand. The Beloved bond – gone.
“Exactly. I need you to find out what his plans – his real plans are for the prince.” Steve runs a hand through his already messy hair. It’s been one hell of a day already. By the way his empty stomach feels, he knows it’s way past dinner time.
Rolling his eyes, Tony shakes his head and says, “Penny, get off the line. I need to talk to Jo-Jo.” He assigned Jo-Jo as the AI to assist and watch over his new omega. He doesn’t want any lip from Penny. She can be a jealous little bitch sometimes. As he walks to the lift, Penny answers him.
Peering up as he releases Tony, Steve sees the glistening of sweat, the red blush over Tony’s chest and face. His hair is wild and for one moment Tony transcends all rational thought in Steve’s brain. He looks magnificent. Steve smiles and feels heavy, needy.
Tony cups Steve’s forehead and then strokes a hand down through his hair. Tears glint in his eyes and he kisses Steve on the temple and then gently, tenderly on the lips. No words pass between them and Steve’s not sure what’s happening or even where he is. For the first time since opening his eyes, he realizes he’s no longer on Tony’s private jet. Around them sounds coalesce. In the near distance he hears people speaking – his name – sprinkled throughout their conversation. He can’t figure out much more than that – it’s muddled in his head.
“Oh, I’m sorry,” the blur says and, Tony sees a warm light around the man. He has blonde hair and blue eyes but that’s not what attracts Tony’s focus, it is the halo of light encircling him, and emanating from him.
They’ve been together for over a decade. Through the hardest hell when they both found out that Bucky was responsible for Tony’s parents’ deaths to Steve mourning his last day with the shield. They celebrated a real wedding; they took joy in their children’s births. Every moment has been a reminder of who they are, what they are. It sows seeds for the next moment, allowing it to grow.
“Oh shut up you jerk,” Steve said. “You always pushed all these girls at me and never once asked if I was interested.” He never gave Bucky a chance to response, instead he faced Tony. “And you, you wouldn’t listen to me about Bucky. He’s a tool, a victim. Did you give it a moment’s thought what happened to him?”
Yinsen offers him that knowing yet tender smile. “It is the French who would eat rotten meat only covered with the most wonderful sauces and marinades.”
The words made no sense at all to Steve. Like pellets of hail they hit him, stinging and bruising. He wanted to close his eyes to the onslaught, but he remained firm fighting the fear. “What?” he said and looked around her. “Who?”
“Sergeant James Barnes calling for Steve Rogers. Do you accept the call?” The automated voice is programmed in through the space dilation system.
Steve scrambled over the branches as he heard Iron Man order, “We have incoming. The Legion has surrounded your position.”
“Tony, are you with me?” Steve says and cradles his face in his hands once he’s gotten his shirt and undershirt off. “Tony look at me, tell me you can hear me.”
“Thanks,” he said and then switched off the faucets. He would have liked to stay alone longer but it was time to face the music. He stepped out of the shower, dried off efficiently, and grabbed his robe from the hook on the bathroom door. He expected Sam to be waiting in the living room, not standing at parade rest in the center of his bedroom. Steve released a breath before walking past Sam and going to his bureau.
“You better say yes or else he’s going to moan about it all the way home to Momma’s place.” Morgan munches on her cookie and rolls her eyes. She flips through the book as if she’s said nothing at all.
Without pause she started down the hallway and Steve followed. They ended up in a small room off to the side. When Steve rounded the corner and entered the room, he staggered to a stop. Clint was tied to the bed, throwing his head around, his body jittering as if he was going through withdrawals. Sweat puddled around him, covering his body. The stench of fear and adrenaline filled the room.
“At least make sure he sees the bonding collar.” His tone ices Steve’s insides. His touch riles Steve’s emotions, bubbles up the sentiment of rage yet at the same time the longing of love. It conflicts and distorts. He’s afraid if he looks up from his booted feet the world might slant and shred. He tells himself that it’s the gland, his new gland still healing, still trying to adjust to the rollercoaster of emotions.
But then the shadows darken the world, and the light becomes a rigid pattern, boxing him into a corner in his mind until even he cannot sense the difference between reality and digital existence.
Maybe it’s a little bit of Blu coming to the surface, but Tony sees how important it is for Steve to be present for him. It’s part of his duty, a sentinel, a guard. It’s part of why Tony always felt safe with Blu, ever since the terrorists tried to use Blu to frighten Tony. It hadn’t worked. Blu – Steve saved him.
He dreams. The images flash and promise. In waking hours, he thinks of them as nightmares but in truth he longs for these dreams, these hopes and prayers of a different time. In the dreams he has a family – of warriors against an evil with a red skull for a face. He’s a leader, a hero in these times, but he also dies in tidal wave of cold.  Sometimes he dreams of a different family. Sometimes he dreams he’s an outlaw, fighting against the injustice in the system. But mostly he dreams of the family – he might call them warriors but in the dream the family – his team – calls themselves the Avengers. He thinks it might be a silly name. What are they avenging he asks, but his team – the team he calls a family and he’s never seen their faces – doesn’t answer.
“Yes, a gala. The one that benefits the Maria Stark Foundation. We could have an announcement about the upcoming products and advancements. You could host. We could even invite certain members of the press,” Pepper says, and she smiles. Steve catches her expression – she’d been planning this, or wanting to and Steve gave her a perfect opportunity. She winks at him.
“What does that mean?” Steve asks. He’s always meant to watch Star Trek – it’s just that 70 years is a lot to catch up on.
“I did,” Steve said. “But I don’t think so. I think the universe made me truthful to myself.” He nodded as if having an internal conversation. “Being truthful to yourself is the first step to happiness in some ways.”
It took Tony several more seconds before he saw Hill standing to the side near the dining area with that concentrated look she often got on her face before spouting out bad news like a TV news anchor. “This doesn’t look promising,” Tony muttered as Steve helped him to sit in one of the dining room chairs. Steve clasped his shoulder and then moved off to the kitchen to get him some water. Rubbing his chest, Tony cringed at the feel of the burn.
“Okay. Yeah.” Happy breathes a few times in the phone. Over the last week, Steve’s learned Happy is a heavy breather by habit. “You’re a good kid and all. Thanks for doing this for him.”
Tony shakes his head. He’s pensive, tense, worried. “Your soul was concealed, cloaked by the Red Skull. It’s like trying to find a needle in a haystack at night.”
“You said nanotechnology earlier, I didn’t realize it was so versatile.” Steve flexes his hands. The serum works wonders.
“I don’t think you should trust a spy,” Tony remarked and dropped down onto the bed. He didn’t think he could watch Steve leave, not this time. “He has some agenda you don’t know about. You do realize that right?”
“We need to get you a new assistant, if you really want me to be the CEO. I can’t do both,” Pepper says. He doesn’t want to hear it. Pepper is his security blanket and he can’t lose her.
“It’s a weapon. It can incinerate anyone.” Tony showed Steve his hands. “These too. The ones on my feet help me levitate.”
At that moment, Steve clears his throat to announce his presence. They turn to find him standing in the hallway. His hair is still damp from his shower and he’s freshly shaven. The blue t-shirt stretches dangerously over his muscular chest and the jeans hang precariously on his narrow hips. “Good morning.”
Tony groans but doesn’t thrust. He holds onto the back of the bench and drops his head back. His thighs quiver against Steve’s hands, but then the prince places his hands over him and slowly pushes Steve’s away. Understanding, Steve folds his hands in his lap and make tiny movements with his tongue until Tony settles in – getting used to the feel.
He cradles the tin cup in his hands and sips the water as he bends upward. He’s clearly still in pain, but Tony thinks it has little to do with the injuries he’s sustained and everything to do with those strange protuberances on his back.
Tony knows it’s a lie but he finishes up on the computer. It will take some time to get the final download completed. Right now, he has to get in the armor and plan with Steve how to get both of them out of the cave.
He nearly falls into the painting when Clint comes around the corner and knocks his shoulder. “Hey.”
His mind already leapt past her, and he should have learned his lesson not to do that to her. She had been his anchor for so many years, and he always took her for granted. He shouldn’t but he was a captive of his own intellect, talent, and emotional brain and never could resist it. So he kissed her cheek again and started back to the elevator, waving his fingers behind him.
“Tony, we’ve been through a dozen candidates except for the missing requirement of knowledge of biomedical sciences and stats he’s the best one we’ve seen or interviewed. You know that the bio requirement is just an ancillary concern. Strange is always willing to step into that role for you,” Pepper says, and she places her hand on his. It is a gentle touch. “The headache’s back, isn’t it?”
“So what was the deal, they get to bash you around, see how much you could take? Tony can’t let it go, he can never let anything go.
“You’re nothing else but your biology as well. You’re nothing but a playboy. I read the file. I know what you are.”
“Doctor Banner, Bruce,” Steve said and smiled. “It seems you don’t know quite enough about me. I’m the last person who follows orders without question.”
“I need to bond with him. That will subdue him. That’s all you need to know,” Tony says and gulps back his own arousal. He hasn’t knotted since his last Urgency. He usually uses suppressants these days, but those aren’t really medically endorsed. He took his last dose over a month ago because he knew that he would end up needing an omega due to the Council meeting.
Steve waves off the offer of food. “I’ll just get some coffee.” He won’t drink it. Time is ticking and freedom slips away with every second.
Sam dunked the toast in the egg yolk. “It’s all about the symbolism in dreams. Not what’s actually happening.”
But this time, it is too much. The venom acts so fast, so very rapidly. Nothing can stop it. Not nature, not science, not a miracle. Blu scrubs at the ground with his paw and then lifts his head if only for a moment to glimpse him again.
“Other things?” Tony asks. He walks into the room, only waiting a second for the omega to follow him. He does, although there’s a hesitation in his step. Tony spins on his heel and considers the man. “Like hack into my computer system and study my family tree.”
“No, never.” He feels the slight stubble along Steve’s jawline. The strength of his jaw, the chiseled features, how he wants to touch it all, explore it. “Do you mind if we get this all to go?”
As he looks up he sees it in the mirror, the gutted remains of his shoulder where his gland should be. It’s ugly and jagged. The blood steams freely and isn’t stopping. He must have nicked an artery or something. It will stop – soon enough he thinks, but then he’s down on his knees and there’s a puddle of red spreading out under him. It will stop soon. The serum will work and he’ll be okay. But his mind drifts and it’s getting more and more difficult to focus.
It’s Tony’s turn to fall silent. They journey the rest of the way to the meeting place without speaking. When they meet the helicopter, Rhodey and Happy are there along with the pilot, a doctor, and an animal caretaker. Tony only waves away the questions and climbs aboard. Steve remains in the grassy meadow. Peeking his head out, Tony instructs, “Come on, Adam, you need some clothes other than fig leaves. I’m sure we have something in here.”
“So you’re telling me that Tony feels like home to you,” Sam said as he stabbed his egg, making the yolk run. He sopped it up with a slice of toast.
“Steve doesn’t bitch about responsibility,” Bucky replied. He pointed to Steve as he stuffed his mouth with more food. “That man is not Steve. Not the Steve I know, anyhow.” He shrugged. “Maybe he changed.”
“No, Stark decided, we got the confirmation last night. Sharon sent it to me and Nat,” Bucky says and pulls out a small crystal disc. It looks like a gem from a pendant. “Go ahead, read it.”
Steve helps Tony take off his helmet and takes off his own. “Well, let’s see if the Motel West has any vacancies.” Steve offers his arm to Tony with a slight nudge and he guides them both to the main building. “This is a tiny building. There are several cabins in the back. It looks like an ax murderer might find this place attractive. Last chance for going back to the city.”
He continues down the hallway until he gets to the door with the blinking light on the top. It signals entrance allowed and that an omega waits for him. He presses the door lock; it scans him and confirms his identity before releasing. Walking into the room, he glances around. It’s bare bones of a bonding room. A bed in the corner that is essentially a metal slab with a mattress and some blankets. No pillows at all. A small table with a drawer sits next to the bed.  Another door to the side of the entrance is the small bathroom. Across from the bed is a rack where the omega, SR001, hangs with his wrists chained to the cross bar. A spreader bar has been placed and locked onto his legs. He’s clean, still dripping wet in fact. His wounds look better, too. His hair has been clipped and his beard gone. Tony notes all of this as he peers around the man and checks out his state. He’s facing the wall.
With the shield particles back in the clip, Steve turns and races up the side of the mountain toward the ridge. He shoots the shield again, but this time misses. The Hulk growls and is within a breath of catching him. He stretches back to catch the stream of nanobots, but Hulk takes advantage of it, and grabs his arm. The nanobots collide with the raging monster and fall into a million pieces across the snowy landscape. Steve swing his right hand and punches Hulk in the eye, closes to the shield’s slice. He wishes to God that he could coax Bruce out, but this isn’t reality, and this isn’t really Hulk – this is a manifestation of Ultron’s demented brain.
“Well, that bike on the island wasn’t the only one I own.” Tony offers him a lopsided grin. Steve arches a brow at Tony, knowing full well that the man has no idea about his facial expression, but surprises are in the air tonight. “Don’t give me that look. Oh and you thought I wouldn’t know that you’re giving me that look that Pepper has perfected over the years? You’re way out of your league. Onto the Harley.”
“You should feel it from this side. Like my insides are on fire but I’m freezing just the same.” As if on cue he shivered and then pulled the blanket tighter around him. “Coming home would be great.” He smiled then, sad and soft. “It would be nice to go home.”
“That means we can’t get Steve out of the singularity without releasing them as well,” Tony says. “He’s the singularity, he’s the fulcrum. If we find a way to release him, then the Ornari come here.”
“Mer Rogers, the duchess has returned, and I have prevented her entrance. Would you like for me to ask her to return at a later time?”
He takes out a fork and stabs each potato with gusto. “We just got to this place. This place we’re exploring and I’m not sure how fast we’re going to go and -.”
When the nurse comes and tells him that the surgery is going well, he only smiles. When they report that his husband is out of surgery and in recovery he nods. When the Amazonian doctor comes and tells him they were able to save two of his uteri sacs he says that’s a good thing. She smiles and rests her hand on his.
On the more personal side, Steve’s learned that the prince is partial to cats which might be a bad thing since Steve’s terribly allergic. The prince also plays piano and invents constantly. He used to drink to excess but rarely part takes anymore. But more interestingly, the prince refuses to marry for politics. Instead, he vows to marry for love. Part of Steve thinks that’s a fairy tale – a good yarn woven by his spin doctors to manage the media-vids and put a good face on who the prince is. All over the Conclave people sworn with hope of one day capturing the Lonely Prince – he’s been called that for a few years in the media-vids that Steve read.
“Zola he said, well, he inferred that history was changed when it needed to be. People were wiped out, killed. The Winter Soldier was their assassin, Tony. He killed them. The Winter Soldier, not Bucky. You have to believe that. You have to see that it wasn’t Bucky.” Steve was pleading with him and, for the life of him, Tony couldn’t understand what he was getting at – who?
“Thanks, JARVIS wanted told me it would be better than the black suit I wanted to wear said this would present the right character.” He slides his hands down his pants, nervous. A public appearance in the spotlight worries him.
The storm of malignance pelts him and Tony shudders in his grasp. Like a mantra in his head, Steve murmurs the truths that he knows. He’s a shield, a protector, the best last defense for Tony. Decades ago, he was made for this purpose and this purpose alone. To protect and shield. To defend and preserve. He was never God’s righteous man; he has only always been just a man trying to do his best. His best is to secure Tony’s safety against the cruelty and hatred of an intelligence gone horribly wrong.
Scientists tried to explain it, though they still couldn’t figure out how the virus or prion reanimated the dead. They couldn’t detect the infectious vector no matter how many different methodologies they utilized. Trying to figure out how the mating occurred stretched the definition of ordinary science, forcing the logical to the realm of illogical and the acceptance of the supernatural. To Steve, the glamour connection linked them through blood and something more. Sharing of blood caused the mating to click into place. The rest evolved from it. Some vampires and humans used the mating as a convenience. Yet others became fully engrossed in it. Natasha had taken Steve aside and warned him against it.
“Just change and then throw the suit out,” Clint said. He concentrated on keeping the helicopter stable as Steve crawled in the back and dug out the jeans, shirt, hoody, and sneakers. The shoes looked ridiculously huge. They really didn’t fit. He tore away the jacket and pants of his uniform. Then he discarded the undershirt. The bite mark from Tony was very nearly healed. He struggled to get the pants on and then pulled on the t-shirt and hoody. He looked like a frat boy reject.
He wanted to tell Steve that he was remembering a Bucky Barnes that no longer existed. Only the Winter Soldier existed, the hand of Hydra and an evil assassin. He swallowed those words. He couldn’t force Steve to see reality. Not with that look on his face, not with his soul reaching out, aching for help. “We have to call in help. This isn’t just us. This is the whole pack, the team,”  Tony said. Maybe somehow Tony could salvage this fucked up pack. The streams of guilt flowing off of Steve might drown him first, though.
Wanda smiles and it’s sweet and wholesome. “I am so glad. I don’t know Mister Stark well. He’s barely here, but I am pleased for him.”
The color in Steven’s cheeks rises and he demurs, his eyes lowered. The reaction is so familiar, so touching that Tony fights not to respond. It wouldn’t be prudent to do so in the company of his First. He’s always said he would not put on a display of fealty – he’s not barbaric. He might threaten it, but he’s not about to do it.
“We have to decide what to do about the team,” Tony had said. He let his hand drift over Steve’s pectoral muscles. Steve stiffened but didn’t move from his prone position on the bed. It was a test. Steve had only been Tony’s Submissive for a short period of time – five weeks. Tony wanted to see how far he could push Steve. He’d found pain and pleasure mixed wonderfully for Steve, but this wasn’t about pain or pleasure – this was about discipline and obedience. If there were categories of Dominants then Tony would most definitely be shuffled into the classification of Disciplinarian. Maybe it was because Tony couldn’t discipline himself. A Submissive who could led the way for him.
“You can damn well let your friends help you out. Come to the Rails, Coulson and Fury are going to deal with this shitty ass conference. You don’t need to be here. You’re not a politician.”
“Yeah, I’m not sure that will change your voodoo connection or not, but he’s leaving. Playing with the big spy organization now.” Tony tried to sound casual. Hoped to hell he sounded like he didn’t care. He shouldn’t care. This was the guy who caused Tony to grow up in a shadow of a memory. A little kid should never have to do that at all.
Before Tiberius responds, Tony interrupts, walking over to them and smiling. “Please don’t tell me you’re trading stories over here?”
Steve whipped his head to the side at the same time he swung forward. The chains offered little leeway, but he took what he could get and yanked on them to get enough momentum to clamp down on Rumlow’s hand with his teeth. Steve bit down, closing his jaw and freezing it. Rumlow screamed out, and yanked at his hand, but Steve bared down, feeling the crush of knuckles against this teeth and tongue.
Steve huffs out a breath and considers Tony. “What do you want me to tell you, Tony? It’s an empty gap in me that’s worse than feeling hungry all the damned time. I know, I know for a fact that things are better here. Technological advances are amazing, and the civil rights advances more amazing. I agree with it all – but.” He pauses for a second and then says, “I know things are better now. I know it. I miss my hometown… I miss the bakery that used to be at end of my street. I miss Mrs. Thomason and her broom that she scattered the pigeons with every day. I miss the way apples tasted. I miss the real bananas. I miss my friends. I miss the Howling Commandoes. I miss the pace of life back then. Nothing was so fast. Because it couldn’t be.” He stops, spent and sighs.
“You bet it is,” she says and then reaches up and touches his face. She cups her hand on his cheek. “I can get you some pain meds, if you need them.”
“No. They wouldn’t understand, either.” He scoffs. “Who would?” He stands up and flings his hands outward. “You know what, JARVIS, you want to know what’s up? Okay! I’ll tell you. I’m sick in the head. I’m in love with a fucking delusion.”
Steve chewed on his lower lip. His hand still touched Tony’s cheek and jaw. His hands were so big, and strong. “I’m fine. Don’t stop. Don’t stop now.”  He leaned into Tony, holding him, bringing his forehead to touch Tony’s. “I just don’t want to be a disappointment to you. You mean too much to me.”
They descend the stairs from the plane as if they’re royalty, and Steve can’t help but smirk at Ross as he scowls. The guards around him remind Steve of Rumlow and his Strike team. Black helmets with face shields and black uniforms. All of them are wearing body armor as if Steve might start spitting bullets at them.  Tony must see the ridiculousness of the situation because he smirks at Ross.
He allows the horse to have her head and work her way down the rocky pathway; it takes too long and by the time they get halfway, sweat dips down Steve’s temples. Anxiety during a ride is never fun. He stretches and glances back at Tony, who is concentrating too hard on the ground, but moving with the horse like he was born to it.
“I did it, I know I did it,” Bucky said as the images assaulted all of them. “I remember each and every one. All of it.”
“Okay,” Tony said. He placed his tumbler filled with an amber liquid on the coffee table. “Let’s start. When Bruce taught me it was just kind of a chant. I talked with Strange a little too. He was unbearable and not helpful much at all.”
He swears. This all just gets worse and worse. He thought searching the web for Ultron would be easy – this is all a little too stressful and anxiety producing (not to mention painful) than he bargained for.  He needs to assess the situation and get out of it.
Steve wanted to inquire when Wong and Strange would show up, so he plucked his phone from his pocket to check on them just as they invited themselves into the conference room. Strange swept in like a hurricane while Wong stayed quieter with more of an inner rage waiting to be unleashed – at least that’s the way Steve always interpreted his glower.
“Well, things are nasty here, bud. You will not believe it, but after the Swarm Offensive failed, they pulled the entire fleet back from the secondary boundary. I’m worried if we’ll be able to defend the sector. But lucky me, I got assigned to the same regiment as the Captain! You know, Sam Wilson. We’re gonna be working together. Can you fucking believe it? The Captain and the Wolf. We’re gonna be a legend.”
Bucky pointed at the bed, a look of disgusted marring his features. “God damn it, Steve, I knew it. I just fucking knew it.”
Steve shook his head and laughed. “What was I supposed to do? Let him tuck me under his arm as he flew here? No thank you.”
A scoff erupted out of Tony. He muffled it as quickly as he could, but the damage had already been done. He held up his hands to stop Steve’s disgusted reaction. “No, please.” He gestured for Steve to continue, though his disbelief mounted.
“Both,” Rumlow said. “We were brothers in arms for how many years, Captain? Get out of the car and this doesn’t have to escalate any more than it already has.”
“Finally. You’ve been beating at me for the last half hour. I thought you were dead when I found you. But then Ultron showed up to berate me and do the evil villain monologue thing.”
Frowning, Tony reviews the conversation in his head. He doesn’t remember Steve ever asking him to sit for a portrait but maybe it was part of his hunger loopiness. He should be happy he wasn’t forced to dance the polka. “Coming, let me finish up here.” He picks up a towel and shakes it as if that tells the whole story. It satisfies Steve, who nods and leaves to go back to his room.
"Damn it."  Bucky knows he should comfort him as he feels the Jedi’s quavering under his touch, but he needs to get them out of here so he needs to remove the bindings now. He grasps Steve's shoulder and says, "Gonna shoot the rest of the chains off."
“I’m stopping it, I’m stopping it,” Tony said, and the faceplate covered his head. Steve heard a muffled curse as he held Bucky away from the beam. “It’s fucked. Steve-.”
“Force,” Natasha snickered, but no one smiled and Steve didn’t get the joke. Being out of the ice less than a month caught him in a trap of looking naïve or stupid or both most of the time.
“I don’t want to go,” Steve says, and he hates that he sounds like a petulant child. “Tony doesn’t want me there.”
"Plan?" Steve scrapes the fork along the plate as he eats. His appetite back, along with his curiosity, he enjoys the food again. It's too good to waste.
“I shouldn’t have gone public. That was your doing, Obie! This is my company. They can’t tell me what to do.”
“Sorry, forgot about that,” he says. She places them in his hand. Tony runs a finger along the arm of the glasses and then puts them on. He grimaces a little as the room focuses around him. “Nice blouse.”
“Why did you do it then?” Tony hissed. “If you loved them so much, why the hell did you mate with Natasha? All I can think is that you and Ross and Pierce were playing the long game. You mated with her and infiltrated her coven. They used you, Barton, and they will throw you away.”
Steve bows his head, refusing to answer. “Tony, you have to leave now. You have to go now.” Steve sucks in a breath. “Let’s just get you out of here.”
He wants too much and Tony said no, so with a pained moan he backs away from Tony, from the touch of need, want, and despair. He shakes his head as Tony tries to apologize. “It’s me who needs to apologize, to tell you that this can’t be and then to maul you. I’m not in my right mind.” Steve puts a hand to his temple and fumbles away from Tony, his wings drooping, dragging against the floor. He pushes past Tony and staggers over the deck to the sands.
Steve tried. He stared at the middle distance. He listened to the voice of his mother, telling him to never let up, never stay down. He felt the soft and tender touch of Tony, taking care of him that first time – after they mated, and Steve only wanted to die. Steve clung to his memories, to the strength in them, but even he could not fight off the strength and power of his own biology. His stomach convulsed, and he choked and clamped his mouth shut but it didn’t matter. Blood flooded out of his nostrils, out of his mouth, he seized as it covered him in blood and bile. Tears stung his eyes, flowed down his cheeks to mix with the blood. He couldn’t breathe. Snot and blood stained his lips and chin. He hung onto the chains and wept.
“Sure, it was fast and furious, but hell, we’ve been denying ourselves all this time. I mean I wasn’t going to fuck a lion, but I love you and I am damned happy you’re you now.” He strokes a hand down Steve’s cheek. “We have all the time in the world.”
Tony leans in and Steve can barely hear him reply, “Your long term strategy takes away a lot of independence of the different systems. You know that uniting the factions will only turn to civil war – we can’t afford that now!”
“Well, all is not lost,” Bruce said. “It’s not like you’re that far into it.” Bruce walked back into the laboratory, leaving Steve in the lounge. Steve frowned and wondered if he should follow but Bruce just said, “Hold on a minute.”
"Be careful." Bucky doesn't want any fatalities especially not his partner in the guard. He may love Steve but Sam is his brother in many ways.
As he completes getting ready, Steve considers his gun belt and weapon. Should he bring them along? He’s only going to the saloon, maybe playing cards, listening to the music. He should bring his gun; he’s the law in the town. But he’s seeing Tony tonight.
“All I got,” Steve says and doesn't turn to look to see if the words cut Tony. The truth is sometimes painful. And while Steve has enjoyed these last days with Tony, he isn’t ignorant to belief he can live with Tony in some fairy tale. Tony and his lot will eventually go back to San Francisco. Steve will either face Schmidt and win, or he will face the man and die. There’s no two ways around it. It’s coming.
“Captain? Are you in pain? Is there something wrong?” Cho asks as she leans over him. The heart monitor screeches in protest.
Without another thought, he rushes headlong at the closest attacker. It must take him by surprise because he freezes and doesn’t even raise his rifle. Bucky grabs the weapon, jerks it away from the soldier, and, flipping it, uses the handle to bash the man’s head in.  Spinning, he turns the gun on the other soldier and flattens him with an energy blast. After he finishes Redwing chirps at him and Bucky rushes toward the sound.
“Let’s just say we’ve moved into a new phase of our bond,” Tony says and hopes it sounds genuine, caring, and not too pushy.
Grabbing it, Tony slips out the door. He’s quiet as not to wake up Steve. He presses the makeshift doorbell and waits as he sees the flashes under the door. It takes a while but Clint appears. He’s still in his pajama pants but the robe is gone. Tony lifts the first aid kit and says, “I brought them back.”
“So many times, when I was next to you in the lab, listening to your ideas, trying to keep up with you to capture you were inventing, I would think about touching. Having the ability to touch you anywhere, everywhere,” Steve whispers, his voice shakes as if he’s unsure that Tony would welcome these words, this intimacy. He gently nudges the jacket off Tony’s shoulders and then takes it away. Tony hears it drop to the floor.  He reaches for Steve’s hand and finds it easily.
Tony snickers. “Let me make this easier on you. Let’s start with music. That’s a good topic and it’s easy. I love all kinds of music. Before the accident, I liked it yeah, but I couldn’t stand some of it. Like opera. My mom loved opera and to this day I can remember wanting to drill my head open rather than go to an opera with her. But now, now I can understand it so much better. And it’s not because of what you think. It’s because in college I had this crazy ass organic chemistry teacher that would play opera during our tests.”
“Hmm?” Maybe they should have called on Clint to be Tony’s second. He has kids; he probably knows all about games.
“If you insist on being ignorant, then I suppose I will have to teach you a lesson.” Even as he spoke, Strange put his one hand out and started a circular motion with his other hand. Sparks of gold fanned out. “Wong, if you please?”
“If not Pym then most definitely Jan. She loves the Foundation and how they support young artists.” Pepper barrels ahead. “Plus, we have the Odinsons’ coming for the first time. They are big time tycoons in Norway. They love philanthropic causes.”
“Okay, Stevie, I’m gonna blast off the rest of the chains. I can’t take this damned thing off your head, but right now let’s just get out of here.” With a quick gesture, Bucky tells Redwing to get out of the way. He lights on top of Steve’s shoulder and waits. Bucky fires quickly and repeatedly to break all of the rest of the bindings, shooting at the ankle chains and the chains that kept his body linked to the wall. It’s then that Bucky figures out that even the bucket to relieve himself was out of reach. Steve must have had to rely on Red Skull and his troopers for everything. It curdles in Bucky’s belly.
“Yes, sometimes,” Tony says and it feels like he’s admitting something to Steve, but he cannot fathom what it might be. He snaps out of his reverie and says, “You and your deputy come out here for the fresh air?”
The landscape swept by in a green brown blur of motion. An occasional patch of snow broke the dull coloration of the early winter scenery.  He watched as the tree line disappeared as they climbed higher in elevation, as the snow grew thicker on the ground. The air would get thinner, the oxygen would dissipate. The scatterings of vegetation became stunted and small. He’d never been to this laboratory, falsely believing that it had been shuttered when his parents died all those years ago. Of course, it hadn’t. Stane kept it alive and open for years and now that he was dead Tony had to deal with yet another lost visage of his father’s brilliant insanity. Sure, the world saw Howard as a hero of sorts, the genius millionaire who changed the world by shaping it with weapons of mass destruction. Tony supposed a good number of people outside of the United States thought of Howard Stark as a terrorist. A man who’d helped bend the world to the needs and requirements of his own government. Was that a good thing or a bad thing? Tony left that to the philosophers and historians. How Tony conducted himself in his own life and from now on mattered. Afghanistan had changed everything for Tony, his company, and his friends. He looked over at the driver and Pepper smiled at him. Though her eyes showed a severity and her thin lips reflected a fierce determination. He assumed it was her need to protect him; she was like a mama bear in that regard. He didn’t need her to do it, not anymore but he did appreciate her need to keep him safe. The world did that to people like Pepper. Pepper who cared too much. He was glad he jettisoned his heart when he launched out of the terrorist camp in the middle of a dusty desert.
Yinsen is a god- sent. The man knows a lot of old myths, legends, classic literature along with his knowledge of math and physics. When he’s halfway through telling Tony the story of Dante’s Inferno Tony interrupts him.
It might be an antiquated system of justice that the human hub considers polite society, but it is dictated by biology. The Council of Worlds is ruled by alphas and thus reign over the whole of the human worlds. There had been a time that betas ruled on Ancient Earth, but eventually humans saw the errors in their ways. Infighting killed beta rule eventually, and the world turned back to logic and alphas as human took to the stars. Or so they say. The myths are muddled. The order of society – its way, its rules, and its dictates enabled humanity to flourish and to escape the confines of the ancient world. The order of society has become their crutch, An’Tony worries, and he’s said it more than once at polite society functions. It’s gotten him a very distinct and bad boy reputation on at the Council and throughout the Lanes. Some say he’s charming and mysterious. Others judge him and want to throw him with the rest of the dregs of humanity out on the Purge Rim systems – so far out from the inner core and the Council that there’s no protection. He wonders if that’s not a better way to live instead of this – whatever this is. He’s been to the edge of the Purge, seen some of it. But he has to admit, he doesn’t remember a lot of his youthful days filled with drink and drugs. He partied and played.
Steve keeps a hand on Tony’s inner thigh but doesn’t stroke or move at all. “JARVIS cool the room 3 degrees.”
“He’ll come,” Tony says and fiddles with his glass of wine. “We’ll have to deal with it when it comes. There will be a push for oversight.”
“Thursday,” Tony murmurs. Maybe Thursday will change everything for Tony, maybe Thursday will mean he’s finally found a way out of his living nightmare.
Tony turned around as JARVIS told him that Captain Rogers awaited entrance. For a second, it looked like Tony might throw something at Steve, but instead he gestured and the door unlocked. Steve pulled it opened. As he stepped in, Steve said, “Thank you for agreeing to see me.”
Before he’s able to blurt something out to JARVIS, Steve stiffens next to him. Tony turns to face him and a pale ashen cascade of expressions cast over the good Captain’s features. As Tony watches the good natured Captain disintegrates and transforms. There’s something off and dissociated in his eyes, in his facial tension. He jumps up, and without further comment, leaves the room.
“This one,” The leader says and indicates Steve, “Kill slow. Not so lucky as first, right?” The leader smiles at Tony and it looks like a viper toying with his prey.
Steve followed Clint’s soft direction. He sucked on the straw, welcoming the relief of the drink. His mouth was hot and dry. The flood of the thick liquid hit his tongue – for only a nanosecond he relaxed but then the taste hit him, and he blanched, gagging and choking. The tang of metal and salt – the taste of blood in his mouth. He vomited up what little he’d swallowed, coughing as he did. His eyes watered, and he gagged again.
Natasha let out a breath and then cursed. “He deserves everything. Everything that’s happened to him. He should have listened.”
He wants Tony; he needs to be honest with himself. He’s denied and obfuscated about his tendencies for too long. His gaze has dropped, he’s pulled his hands away and they lie fallow in his lap. He bows his head and wonders what else is there to say. Should he fight this urgency, this need? Is his God merciful, or is will God damn him?
He sets it on the bed, smiles with a little nod, and then they both leave. Steve stands there, staring at the bag, and then at the blank television. His name is Steve Rogers. He does have some connection to Captain America. Why would the doctors hide that from him?
Except for the moment when he declared that Bucky and the Maximoff twins would not be staying in the Tower, Tony remained unresponsive. Steve brought him to the bed as soon as he entered the room. He laid him down and then sat next to him. Images rebounded in the bond, sights and sounds Steve barely grasped. In many ways the pictures in his head reminded him of watching two different movies edited together. He cupped his hand around Tony’s fist.
Might as well be off in the edge of society now as he peers out of the window one last time before he unbuckles, leaving the comfort of his command chair. Technically he’s not the captain of the ship, but he’s the owner and the Lord of one of the Council Families, so the crew and her captain affords him much latitude. Plus the Master of the Fleet happens to be one of this best friends. All of the crew are his subjects, loyal and trustworthy. He wishes he could pick one of them as his Omega – but that’s not going to happen. Not many Omegas serve other roles other than warrior or drone at the Mating Blocks, not in polite society anyhow. He needs a specific kind of Omega – not only one with a reputation, but also a sub to his dominant alpha. That kind of Omega these days is rare for a male prime alpha to find. Most of the sub omegas end up with female prime alphas – since as Tony understands it, they are most satisfying for the submitter. To be a male, prime, dominant alpha is rare and may very well lead him to glory.
“Behind it you’ll find the common kitchen and an observation deck. We have a killer view of the nebula and some of the port.” He keeps walking and then they end up at an elevator. “This lift takes you to your room. That’s your private room, not for clients. No clients allowed. Once you check in with the Widow, I can show you to your room and the working pods.”
“Understand what? What you need him to understand? That you need him to accept who you are? Or that you accept who he is now?” Natasha asked her eyes trained on him like a predator about to devour her prey.
Tony recognizes that even when Obie acts like a dick, he still has Tony's best interests at heart more so than his father ever did. He owes a lot to Obie and he needs to heed his warnings. The Board of Directors want this new weapons system to fly like a bird and sing the Generals and Admirals on the Joint Chiefs of Staff to sleep. It isn't even a difficult problem to solve and Tony can't put his finger on why it all bothers him.
He’s fading fast. He nods. “Tried other things. In DC tried to get other types jobs but everything that depends on strength they covered. Nearly got caught that time. They’re everywhere.”
“Do you like snakes? Well, I do-.” His voice trailed off as Cathy guided him to the room where Barnes was being treated.
Tiberius bends over, hulking over Tony with mass alone. He plants a kiss on Tony’s forehead like he’s a child instead of a lover. Steve nearly shifts away trying to escape, but he notices something, slight and subtle; Tony recoils. The reaction is so miniscule, Steve thinks he might have imagined it, but then Tony locks eyes with him and there’s something quiet and haunting there.
His resolve breaks down and he cries out when Tony goes down on his knees as if in supplication to Steve. He mouths Steve’s erection and only a slide of his tongue sets Steve on fire so much that he reaches out and holds the wall – that’s when he realizes the walls of the shower are heated. Part of him giggles – only Tony would think of such a thing, plan ahead –a futurist in every way.  Tony looks up at Steve his eyes twinkling as if he realizes the reason for his mirth. He winks at Steve, licks his lips and then fully takes his erection.
Heading toward his own suite of rooms, Tony passes the rack and the lounge they used last night. His memories are still warm and inviting. After the ship landed on the Council World and they disembarked, Tony admits now he felt a thrill watching Steven survey the wonder of the Council World. It is unblemished, unlike many of the other human worlds. Here the world is verdant and blush with life. The water runs freely and the lands grow lush and lovely. The whole of the continents is green with forests and gardens while the rest of it is covered with oceans and lakes. It harkens back to the ancient world of Earth. Here on the Council planet there are no factories, no industrialized regions. Just beauty. Clean air, clean water – a luxury on other planets and for most of the human populace, but not here.
“The pack strengthens everyone in it,” Sam said. “Without trying to do this, Steve, you’ve abandoned a great resource.”
He tugs at his jacket, thinking of the bonding room. Of course, he knew he would need to do this – it’s something that is required. He can’t have a feral omega at his side. A feral omega would be shot dead on sight, especially anywhere near the Council rooms. He doesn’t particularly like the idea of forcing himself on an omega, bonding to him, and then being linked to the man for the rest of their lives together. It doesn’t set up a nice foundation. But he lost the opportunity to bond cleanly at a young age when he rebelled against his nature.
“Sure.” The face leans in close and Tony tries to figure out the features. Not his Dad, or his Mom. Both of them are dead, right? “Dad is dead.”
“Where did it come from?” Steve’s forgotten his hesitations, his fears, his doubts as he raises his hands and hovers over it.
Tony barreled ahead not waiting for Vision to explain the concept. “Cho’s designing the chip that will be placed at the base of my skull. I’m designing the entrance and exit strategies. All I have to do is go and commit sonicide or whatever killing your AI child would be called. And bam, it’s all done.”
Steve holds up his hand and says, “Not in the sense of spatial dimensions, but space-time ones. The Realms merge together, while the Boundaries keep them apart. It’s part of the issue with the Convergence – that hasn’t happened. And I’m talking in circles, aren’t I?”
“No, I think I’d like to go in. Maybe get something to eat?” Steve says and he’s grateful to have Tony here, someone to take care of him. Though he must admit, he feels ashamed to have to ask for the help, to beg for food and water as a prisoner is one thing, to have someone – someone like Tony – offer to take care of him. He’s overwhelmed and a rush of fierce pleasure and adoration for Tony spreads through him. It’s so strong that he involuntarily spreads out his wings and sighs.
Steve peeled his eyes open then and saw Peggy standing over his hospital bed. He furrowed his brow and parts of yesterday mixed with his understanding of today, but he fell into the memories and drowned there.
“I want you to know,” Steve says as he crumples up the boxers. “I want you to know that I would fall for you.” He should say he has fallen for Tony, but he can’t – not now – not when he’s come to his senses.
“It won’t be easy. I don’t think any of you believe that. The best way to do this is to pool resources. And to know our enemies,” Steven says. “In the short time I’ve been able to review and evaluate the different sides, I can tell you that Estane will solicit the Bey’Hammyre. Hammyre has the firepower – he’s one of your up and coming industrialists. He doesn’t have a clan to work with so he’ll be eager to join up with one that could fight for power. I take it you don’t want him in your coalition?” Steven’s eyes are fierce with intelligence and it takes Tony’s breath away.
“Holy shit!” Tony says and hauls Steve to his feet. “I would love to have you warm my cock anytime.”
Steve laid a hand on Tony’s shoulder, and then stroked downward to his chest, to his nipple. When Tony hitched a breath at the touch of his nipple, Steve glanced at him and smiled. He leaned forward and kissed, flicking the nib with his tongue. Tony ran his hands through Steve’s hair holding him in place, loving the touch. For a second, Steve paused and said, “Good?”
“Are you not? I've heard your heart is going to break mine.” He doesn't mean to bring it up, but with Bucky lying near death, the press of Tony’s health and well-being eats at his solace so that he cannot find peace.
“Why, Tony?” He picks up his hand and shows it to Tony. The wedding ring is still there. “Thank you for what you did. But it isn’t necessary anymore.” He tugs off the ring and hands it to Tony, who doesn’t accept it.
“We need to,” Tony agreed. His voice sounded far away. “We don’t know what’s coming. We need to protect the world.” He shivered. Even as Tony sat in the lavish room in the middle of London, the darkness of the void of space shadowed over him.  He’d never felt the chill of space when he hovered with a nuclear bomb on his back, but still, the cold hollowed out his chest, ate away at his bones, permeated into his soul. That place haunted him.
He cleans the kitchen while Tony fixes the coffee machine. It feels horribly domestic and part of Tony withers inside because he knows he can never have this with Steve. He bites back his tongue. Grilling Steve about his vow and his wants isn’t the way to go. Tony glimpses him every now and again, and Steve’s focused, on task, and solitary. He wonders how lonely he feels at night.
“With the combined wealth of the Carbonelli and Stark family plus the unspoken support of the Elders, we really don’t need fire power to support our claim, but it’s nice to have. Any alpha needs it.” He thinks that should further impress his omega. Yet, Tony’s surprised by Steven’s reaction.
“Well, you have to understand it if you want to watch the next one.” Tony sees the ring on Steve’s finger. Tony’s wearing his as well, but that’s only because he went out in public. “You know you don’t have to wear it all the time.” He indicates the wedding ring.
“Perhaps you want to be a little less vague and -.” Tony flicked his fingers in a wave at Strange. “A little less that and tell us what the hell is going on.”
“I’m not sure that’s the point of everything, Obie. But I really do sense that we’ve made significant progress on gelling the factions,” Tony agrees.
Bucky shows no mercy. He knows they have shown none to Steve. He flies into action, accurately firing a round but he only targets two of their attackers. The other four are too close and both Sam and Redwing are in the way. He holsters the rifle and swings around with his metal fist impacting hard against the one attacker trying to take out Sam. Redwing swoops in and claws at another's eyes as Sam kicks and then shoots without hesitation. The last assailant isn't deterred by the fact his comrades have fallen. Instead it sends him into a rage he aims his blaster but he never lets off the round to scorch Redwing out of the sky. Bucky shoots him dead. He falls to the ground, a mess of gore and blood where his head once was. Redwing perches on Sam's shoulder with a chirp at Bucky.
“Just start it,” Steve says and he’s hanging on the side of the table, staring blankly, inwardly. His expression tightens around the pain.
“I’m not used to it,” Steve says but lets the prince lead him back to the living room. He has to admit, he feels better than he did right after the shocks that Rumlow gave him, but still a little shaky if he thinks about it too much. As they enter the living room, the heavy aroma of food hits him and his stomach protests loudly. Tony arches a brow at him.
Tony nods. JARVIS knows all of this; he never needs anyone to repeat anything. The AI is a master of analytic thought. “What are you getting at J man?”
He wakes up and nearly half the day is done according to his calculations based on the sun. With so little daylight, Tony doubts he progress on the HUD. He curses and levers himself up using Blu’s side as a crutch. The lion sleeps on and Tony rolls his eyes.
“Really?” She studies Steven with a long look as if she’s drinking him in, testing the taste, and swallowing him down. “From what I heard he was set for termination on Nod.”
Bruce laid a hand on Tony’s arm. “Close your eyes. Right now is not the time to understand the soul pack on a scientific level. Now, you need to learn the Soul Mantra – it’s a chant. Listen to it, and repeat it. The Core is the Soul. The Core is in me. I am the Soul.”
Strange ushers him along and Steve allows it. His mind whirls at the idea of Tony’s dreams disappearing. While Steve’s dreams have also wilted, he’s made new. He hopes and prays that Tony’s found new purpose in life, that he can
This was my angel Steve story where he's off to rescue Tony and Tony rescues him right back. Plus end of the world apocalypse stuff - you know the routine stuff.
He turns from the omega to his loyal First. “Pep,” he says and he takes both of her hands in his and clasps them.  He shouldn’t do this – but part of who he is needs to do this. It isn’t about just a show of strength, but a play of compassion and caring. “I feel it, and it feels right. I’m supposed to do this. He’s mine. I tell you that not as a joke or anything else. But if I’m right, well, I’m always right. He’s mine.”
“You treat me like I’m a toddler,” Tony scowled. He glanced away, hating the feel of Thor’s eyes on him. The elder vampire chuckled, a hearty and healthy laugh.
As the elevator doors opened, Natasha said, “I knew it would be bad, because of the zombie effect.” She shrugged as the car started to lift. “Scattering usually means go to the coven safe houses. Hunt if you need to but keep a low profile. Keep away from mates. Just because it’s more dangerous. But now, they’re going after mates too. It’s not pretty.”
The fact that Tony asked that brought to the fore the fear they both shared. Steve cupped Tony’s face with his hands, purposefully staring into those faceted eyes that seemed to shimmer with gold flecked crimson. “I see the man that I love.” It was true. All of it. The horror drilled straight through to the marrow of his bones, the terror struck there, but also the lasting, enduring love for Tony. A love that healed him once and would again. Not everything would be easy, but their love presented a new day, a new hope for them to survive the torment and agony they suffered.
“Being trapped by biology, by society that sees you as nothing but a tool,” he mutters and he wonders at it. He feels almost as if he’s teaching himself something, as if a revelation or epiphany of understanding is at his fingertips. His status is everything to him.
All the while she tells him the rules of the ‘house’ as she calls it. “Three clients at most a day. I don’t like my workers over done. Most of the time it’s one or two. I have a house of ten workers. You’re my eleventh. I wouldn’t have brought you on but then again, I have that special client who I know will be very interested in you.”
“How do you have them?” Steve takes the keys. If Tony had the keys on him all this time, this wasn’t something that he just did on a whim. “You planned this.”
He hunted the viper, trailed it until he could fashion enough of his own internal energy, calling on the depths of his core, pulling from the energies pulsing through the pack to wrangle it, to quiet it, to bring it to submission. It lashed out though in one heavy gasp to throttle against Steve’s own more orderly energy. It crackled and he only just muffled the pain as it skewered deep inside of him. Steve felt himself shiver at the assault. He refused to give up, standing stock still at Clint’s bedside as the man withered before him and Clint’s ethereal being fought against the shackles of a mortal life. Steve held on, held tight, as if he gripped the only rope that what was left of Clint clung to as he hung over the abyss of death. He battled and threw all of his knowledge into it, but the fact was Steve didn’t know enough. He grunted against the pain that grew. His brain seared with the fire of the soul as it grappled to get away from him, from Clint, from the mundane of Earthly existence. Steve heaved as hard and as long as he could, but it didn’t matter – he couldn’t do it. The soul snapped one last time and scorched Steve’s grip on it, so hot and so brilliant that Steve screamed out loud and collapsed to the floor. A flood of bile came up and Steve vomited on the floor as Cho bent over him, holding his shoulders and calling for the help.
Peggy stepped up to him, placing her aged hand in his metal shoulder. "We have so few of the younglings left. The fact that Steven ranked as a Padawan is of great importance. Not many can face the trials. This is his trial."
“What’s not memorable?” Steve said and mustered his courage to cross the small space and place his hands on Tony’s hips.  If he allowed himself, then Tony’s eyes captured him. He never wanted to struggle away from that gaze, that wonder, that glittering brilliance.
“I’m the Duchess of the Inner Regions and the First Executive of Stark. But you can call me Pepper, everyone does.”
Her eyes glimmering, she answers, “He knows. He always has. Knows all about how your father recognized him. How it had always been planned. We knew the story well in the Red Room. Didn’t we, Soldier?”
He opts to say, “It’s okay. We can deal.” Steve shudders under him. “Let’s get you out of the tub and warmed up.”
“Oh, you found some very creative ways,” Tony spat back. That sounded all kinds of wrong but Steve couldn’t find the energy care. He was sure then that if he spoke a soul bond word for Tony it would be villain, enemy, adversary. They’d been only the barest of teammates during the whole invasion and attack on New York. Sure, Steve was happy to see that Tony was alive after he’d fallen from the sky. But the truth was, so far, Tony mixed with Steve as well as oil and water. It might be an old cliché but it was accurate as hell.
He gathers up the armor pieces and piles them under the tree. There’s no fire right now and what’s left of the deer is completely gone. He’s no idea where it went. Hopefully scavengers didn’t come sniffing around last night. He isn’t going to worry about what kind of animals they might be. He scans the horizon for any signs of animal life beyond himself and Blu. He finds some birds high in the sky, but nothing else.
Alone, he permitted the feeling to helplessness to wash over him, but he also muttered the Mantra as a shield against the rest of the pack honing in on his dismal feelings.  What was he going to do? Tony had been right all along. Inviting both of them into the pack asked for disaster, but the truth was he hadn’t consciously done it. Or had he? He’d made decisions to try and bring people into the pack from Sam to Clint. He’d never considered trying not to allow someone into the pack. He made sure though when he shook someone’s hand in a casual manner that he muttered the Mantra at the same time keeping his soul in check. So, had he, in the past, controlled the selection in some minor ways? Could he have stopped the selection of Bucky? Of Tony?
Considering his choices, Steve again decides to protect Tony’s reputation. “I think so. Must have been.”
“Nothing comes to mind?” There’s disappointment in his voice, a far-off sound as if he’s resigned to a place he’s always been destine to have – a part from the crowd.
“I think you’ve been studying humans way too much.” The first wad of burrs is free and Tony throws it into the fire, starting on the next. “So, you got these while catching the hares for dinner, didn’t you?”
The omega bows his head and Tony feels the defeat run through him. At the same time, he feels the jitters of his muscles as if surrendering is a foreign thing to him.
“You needed more than air,” Thor said. He joined Tony and then gestured to the path along the fields toward the fenced paddock. Tony fell into step easily with him. “I fear you may be losing your path.”
“It’s been trained – for years. If I or one of my men don’t order it out of the cell, it won’t come. It doesn’t want a level 3 punishment. Sure, it will chance a level 1, even a level 2 on occasion, but for it to leave its cell without our permission – that means a level 3 punishment. The last time it did that, well, it wasn’t pretty.” Rumlow snickered as he leered at Pepper. “Your pretty assistant can look up the files on that. Everything that’s taken place here has been recorded, documented, catalogued and saved.”
Still in the armor, Tony flipped open the faceplate and said, “Well, at least we know how it happens now.”
A gasp and Steve snapped his eyes open. Tony opened his mouth in a round o shape and stared wide eyed at Steve. Steve queried him. “What?”
Rhodes walks away but not without turning several times as if to check that Steve has, at least, paid attention and stay put. Strange quirks at eyebrow at him, but Steve has no compunction to explain anything to him. He draws his attention to the rest of the table. Acknowledging the older couple, Steve says, “Steve Rogers.”
“All humans have the capability of having wings, Tony. Most –well mostly all of them never attain wings.”
“I didn’t say anything when you announced I was your husband. I mean I was a lion just days ago, I couldn’t figure it out-.” He glances away from Tony, gazing at the vast Pacific Ocean beyond the living room and balcony. It’s rolling waves soothe. “It was more than I could have hoped.”
Tony checks out the area. He can’t see any shelter. He shouldn’t be planning on staying here any longer than he needs to – and he isn’t, but from his work today, he knows it will take a while to get the HUD functioning again. He needs a safe place to work. Once again, he considers the poppy fields. Going for help is probably the saner way to go. These are farmers who grow poppies for illicit drug production. A stranger will not be looked on favorably. He’s safer off on his own. He looks at Blu. Well, not on his own. He has Blu.
Howard growled at Maria. “Look, now you have him acting as idiotic as you.” His father turned toward Tony across the long distance of the formal dining table. “It’s not a magic cube. There’s no such thing as magic. Magic is just science we haven’t figured out yet.”
The stately bathroom is something out of a mansion, a palace on one of the Council Worlds. Having something like this in a ship is a luxury that few could afford. Steven doesn’t even notice the ancient marble, the sculpted fixtures that look like water fowl, the large walk in shower, or the bath that is more like a miniature swimming pool with a walk in side that slowly immerses the bather.
Happy nods for Steve to approach the prince and Steve quietly pads over to the piano. Tony acknowledges him with short bow of his head and then closes his eyes as he travels the chords of the music. It’s beautiful and ancient. His mother used to listen to the masters and Steve recognizes Chopin as Tony sways with the music. There’s no sheet music on the piano, no tablet, or projected notes. It’s all from Tony’s memory. It might be augmentation to implant the music in his head, but somehow Steve doubts that Tony would ever allow anyone to mess with his brain.
Happy eyes them all with an untrusting gaze and Steve stays mum. It’s nice to be guarded but also, he’s never lived his life in fear. In fact, growing up, he took far too many risks. Both his mother and Bucky would agree. It makes Steve jittery to see how alert and concerned Happy acts. He marches by people, pushing what little crowds there are aside with a booming voice and instructions. It ends up drawing more attention than necessary. Steve only rolls his eyes and stays close to Happy.
Steve took the straw in his cracked lips and met Clint’s gaze. He wanted to tell him it was all right. Again he wanted to lie to Clint and tell him everything would be fine, but the words wouldn’t come, because Tony was probably dead and Steve would hang here for as long as they wanted and they would have vampires feed off of him until they found whatever they were looking for – his brain fogged and the reasons escaped him.
“How is this even possible,” Tony whispers and kisses him. It’s more than Steve can follow, he feels foolish and abashed by his own clumsiness. Tony lines Steve’s lips with a slight swipe on his tongue, it’s enough for Steve to open his mouth, it’s enough for Tony to proceed. The drag of Tony’s tongue and the whisper of his chest against Steve’s set him on fire. He grapples as his wings spread out, as he clutches onto Tony’s shoulders, wanting more of the taste, the thrill of this intimacy.
He trudges upstairs. The water heater probably won’t handle two of them showering at the same time. He lingers for a bit outside of Steve’s room until he hears the shower turn off and then he scurries away being as quiet as possible. Lord knows, he doesn’t want Steve to think he was spying.
He shouldn’t have involved Tony. Bucky, the Skull gang, Schmidt, they are all Steve’s problem – not Tony’s. When the storm clears, there’s only one thing to do – send Tony back to the town and face the Skulls alone.
