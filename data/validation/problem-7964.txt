right now, Stark!” Steve pressed through his teeth.
Enjoy the ride!!! <3
“Fucking bodybuilder,” Stark groused, making a show of smoothing down his T-shirt. “I feel like a house fell on me.”
“I’ve got an idea!”
"Until," he confirmed.
Slowly, Tony nodded.
“At least it’s not purple this time,” she said.
Prop— What?
“I’m sorry, kid,” Natasha said, clearly more amused than anything. “No offense, but you don't look old enough for that.”
“But your cock clearly likes the idea?”
His eyes widening, Steve shuddered and shook his head.
But I’m getting ahead of myself! The truth is, they’ve actually been at it a lot longer than since last night. Hulk and Birdbrain. Seriously, they’d been arguing for days! And I honestly thought that our beloved captain had it. He told them to leave the poor beast alone! What a good friend, heh? He must’ve
For a second, Tony watched him, then his lips twitched and he threw his head back in a full-belly laugh.
Tony had everything planned and ready. He had the zip ties and ropes, the syringe. Now he was sitting in his van, in a dark parking lot, waiting for his chance. God, he couldn’t wait!
“Mr. Stane is entertaining until late tonight,” Kwazoffsky said from the front seat as the car took off from the curb. “So he’ll send a car when it’s safe to return to the mansion. After that you will be relieved of your duties, Marshal.”
“I’ll give it to you when I can.” It was in Tony’s backpack, with the rest of the luggage. “It might need charging though.”
Steve put his nose into the dark wavy hair and inhaled in pleasure. Tony relaxed into his embrace and hummed.
Steve froze.
“Well…” Steve dropped his eyes, not even sure what he was going to say. “It’s not like it would be a hardship to be married to you.” God, he was crazy, was he really offering? Shit. Steve didn't have much. Nothing to offer a rich, smart and beautiful omega—
Tony grinned and clicked the remote button a couple of times more to change speed and rhythm, then pushed it into the maximum intensity—
The man was walking in his general direction and in anticipation, Tony stopped breathing. Fingers tight around his syringe, he was standing frozen, listening to his mark’s steps.
“Oh, new people!” Tony called out cheerfully. “What happened to the old dream team? Obie fired them for letting me escape?”
“That’s just your hormones talking,” Tony replied with a wry twist to his lips. “Trust me, I’ve gotten more than a few spontaneous proposals over the years.” He looked away, clearly uncomfortable. “If I agree now, I’d feel like I’m taking advantage of you.”
"Fuck off."
“Look,” he said. “I’ll double whatever he paid you, okay?”
There was a thump at the back. In high alert now, Tony checked that the road was empty and pulled up. He went to the back and opened the door. The man was still on the floor and tied up but awake. His eyes were open if groggy, and he was struggling as if trying to get out of the bonds.
“Sorry,” Steve said unapologetically.
Steve took a deep breath and let it out.
He couldn’t wait.
Steve and Nat both knew that even though Stark had been on the run for almost six months now, he’d been here for only a couple of them.
“That's okay,” Steve replied, “I'm not in a hurry.”
“If you don’t mind. Clint’s is a bit flashy.”
Alpha. And not a curse this time but a title of trust and friendship. Relieved, Steve smiled.
of money. More than Steve had ever gotten for any other job before. Mainly because even as the best bounty hunter this side of the pond, Steve Rogers, 29, a retired vet, never took on runaways. Finding rich omega runaways paid a lot more than catching criminals, even the most dangerous ones. Still, making the rare and precious behave wasn’t a service Steve generally offered. He was the last one to tell a person, an O or otherwise, what they should be doing with their lives. In this case, however, Steve was willing to make an exception. Everyone had seen the widely publicized ToTy romance and it was clear that the two men were smitten with each other. That Stark ended up being addicted to coke was unfortunate. He needed help.
Suddenly, they heard a mighty roar from some kind of engine and, under that, a faint whoop of success. A few seconds later, the engine was turned off and a dark-haired young ma- oh god, this was Stark. He’d shaved his goatee which now made him look like a — honest to god — a highschooler. Steve frowned. Stark was wiping his hands on a rag, was gangly, as if he’d lost a lot of weight (which was consistent with him using), but only half a head shorter than Steve. His huge chocolate brown eyes framed with gorgeous eyelashes were even more impressive up close. Well, not
Last night, Hawkeye and Hulk ended up betting that the other could not possibly swipe your wonderfully huge pet’s favorite chew toy without him noticing. And I said that your hog—
And true to his word, the young man started walking towards the door. Steve felt himself relax, but once outside, Stark stumbled back, stepped sharply on Steve’s foot, elbowed him in the gut and tried to leap over the railing. Steve heard the car door open — Nat was ready to intercept, but Steve just grunted and grabbed the O around the middle, effectively pinning his hands to his sides, and put him in a chokehold with his other hand. Stark struggled only briefly, quickly recognizing the futility of it, and slumped in Steve’s hold. It felt like he was giving up: the O didn’t even curse; he just stilled.
thinking about it! Then Tony leaned in, put his palm on Steve’s face, and kissed him.
They sat in the bar until it started to close, then headed up to Steve’s room. If they played at hooking up, they could go to the car shop together in the morning.
“So, so pretty,” he repeated, picking up the longer chains that were also fixed to the clamps. Humming from a slight dom high Tony played with the tiny pegs at the end of the chains. Steve’s eyes were trailing his movements with apprehension and feeling affection for his poor boy’s bewildered gaze, Tony showed him.
“Goddammit, Pepper,” Tony bit out, draining his coffee cup, facing her then. “I don’t have feelings for the guy. Can’t you just let it fucking go?” Tony said, his voice strained as he forced himself not to yell.
He felt Tony’s own arousal slide between his ass cheeks then, the mushroom like head catching on Steve’s loose rim.
Slowly, Tony massaged Steve’s hole, removing his fingers one at a time and feeling the spent ring of muscle flutter around the digits until it was fully relaxed.
“Yeah, ‘oh’,” Steve said. “You wanna know who it is I’ve fallen for?” He asked then, his tone sharp. And Tony looked back to meet the blonde’s gaze once more. His blue eyes were soft then, almost innocently. Tony didn’t say anything, just continued to stare at Steve.
“I’m going to run to the bathroom, okay? Be right back.” With that, Tony hurried to the bathroom. Steve watched him, wondering what he was doing. Soon enough though, he saw Tony with a wet cloth in hand. “I know you like to get cleaned up after a mission. And I want you to feel your best tonight,” Tony explained, and Steve smiled. Tony knew him so well.
“Yes! Uhn, Tony,” Steve sighed, rocking down and in against Tony’s pulsing hips.
In an instant, Tony was off the bed, taking a hold of Steve’s legs and pulling him to the edge of the mattress. He hoisted his love’s legs up and spread them once again, showing Steve’s sloppy, loosened entrance. The blonde looped his arms under his thighs, holding them as he waited for the genius’s next move.
“That’s not the point, Stark. I have elites in the conference room waiting for you to show up.” Tony just looked down at Steve and rolled his eyes at Fury being such a drama queen.  Steve gave him a small smile, his hands wrapping around the genius’s back.
“Is this it?” Steve asked, and Tony reluctantly turned to see the oil canister in the super soldier’s grasp. Tony’s eyes typically betrayed him as he immediately looked back to Steve’s bare shoulders and glorious torso. Why the hell was the man still shirtless?! Couldn’t he see Tony’s discomfort?
“I should go on conference calls more often, if this is my reward afterwards,” Tony said, winking up at Steve before he spread the man’s legs further apart and hitching up his knees. “Can you hold your legs up for me, Steve?”  the super solider wasted no time complying, bringing his knees to his chest as much as his dexterity would allow him. He was so exposed like this, yet being with Tony was also when he felt the safest. “Perfect,” he heard Tony whisper, the man eyeing up Steve’s body as if it was a work of art.
“I think you’re blind to your feelings, Tony” Pepper said coolly, placing her mostly full cup on the counter.
“I think I am actually going to take a nap,” Steve said with a shit-eating grin. He really was tired, especially after that wonderful love making. Tony just glared at him, tossing on his sunglasses.
“Well, it’s not the first time, and I am sure it won’t be the last, unfortunately. And you know as well as anyone that he won’t be found unless he wants to be,” Steve said, remembering how Natasha told him about her history with the Winter Soldier. The red head simply nodded.
“Did that just make things official, then?” Tony asked, smiling still as he slid his hands to Steve’s narrow waist. “Shall we assume the rolls of boyfriends now?” Steve trailed a hand to Tony’s chest, resting it on the curve of his pectoral, the other sliding up to card his fingers in the hair at the nape of the brunette’s neck.
When he finally got his pants and underwear off, Tony knelt behind Steve only to then wrap his arms around his love’s torso. Steve leaned back against him, turning his head in search of Tony’s mouth. Tony allowed him one kiss before he gently turned Steve’s face back toward the mirror. “Do you see how magnificent you are, Stevie?” Tony asked, resting his chin on one of Steve’s shoulders as his hands drifted over the plains of the blonde’s belly.
“I can’t take you anywhere. Can I, Steve?” Tony remarked, observing the dried release on the fabric as well as the giant tear right above it.
Hovering over the man’s thick length, Steve gently blew on it, his breath warm against the slightly cool chocolate that mixed with bubbling white precome at the slit of the head. Steve took Tony in his mouth then, relishing in the chocolate flavor that mixed with the man’s salty precome. The brunette sighed at the feeling of his beloved’s warm tongue. He watched Steve’s pink lips stretch around his girth, letting out a low groan, head falling back against the cushions.
She hadn’t been lying when she had said that. Steve, no, Captain America, had been someone he had grown up loving, and looking up to. He was the hero of America, the symbol of what the country stood for. Howard had always talked about this righteous man, the perfect embodiment of America. And for a young Tony, who in his father’s eyes would always walk in Captain America’s shadow, wanted to be exactly like the very first superhero. Because then his father would be proud of him and would love him.
“Yeah, you’re right.” Steve leaned back and grabbed the romper that hung from his foot still. “You could come with me to Easter Mass tomorrow though?” Steve said, blinking his lashes sweetly before giggling like a moron. Tony just grinned, affection glowing in his eyes for his beloved.
Tony sent that picture to Pepper with the caption,
Steve rested his head on Tony’s shoulder, pushing back in rhythm with his thrusts. Like with so many aspects of their life, they were in tandem, balanced. He felt the flaming heat in his belly again, wound tight. Steve was overwhelmed with Tony’s touch, the burst of pain as he rolled the sensitive flesh of a nipple between his fingers, the tight fist he had wrapped around his clothed length, and the sensation of being penetrated by Tony’s long and leaking cock. He was so close then, reaching a hand up to latch into Tony’s hair as he moaned low.
Steve heard a noise coming from around the corner where the sitting lounge was. He put down the tray of champagne flutes and went to see who was there, only to stop, staying behind the wall. It was Tony who was sitting on the couch, legs on the messy coffee table. The man looked exhausted as he rubbed a hand against his face, scratching at his beard. Steve had wondered on so many occasions how that facial hair would feel against his cheek, neck, chest, and other places he dared not think about now.
“Uh, well,” Tony said, the butterflies filling up his chest then.
Steve walked into his apartment, gym bag in hand. He had just did a work out at a gym that had a feeling of old, a rustic space with crackled leather and the smell of chalk powder floating in the dim lighting. Steve was in a zone as he had pounded at the heavy bag, thinking of the past, with his friends in the war, with Peggy...and before Bucky fell. Now Steve was alone, in a world that was both full of curiosities and crippling unfamiliarities.
“Merry Christmas, Tony,” Steve said innocently from the confines of his expensive sheets and comforter. “Do you like the last part of your present?” The blonde then asked, holding his bound wrists up and smiling sweetly at the brunette, who was walking closer to the bed all the while.
The genius smiled up at Steve, shear excitement and happiness spreading across his face as he planted his feet into the mattress for leverage.  He said nothing as he began a gentle thrust of his hips into Steve, falling into a smooth rhythm.  Tony dropped his hands to Steve’s thighs, caressing the muscles before fingering the lace at the tops of his stockings. Steve really looked beautiful in just about anything, and the way he looked in feminine garments was hands down Tony’s favorite thing he wore. Even more so than that tight Captain America suit. There, he said it.
“Hey, it’s okay,” Tony bit out, cradling Steve’s face with his hands. “I was too enraptured with watching you come and then cleaning me up to worry about it,” Tony said in pure honesty. But now, when Steve touched him there and they were talking about it, the aching heat and sensitivity of his length was unavoidable. “Lay on your back for me,” Tony said, his tone sweet yet laced with assertiveness.
“What?” Steve queried then as Tony continued to stare at him.
“I would have my mom tell me that story as much as possible, until she wanted to change it up. I guess I loved it because, growing up scrawny and an easy target, I would ask myself what would Brayan and Ferris do?”
“How is that fair?” Tony asked, his voice breathless as he rested his head against Steve’s chest, nuzzling close. Steve just chuckled, taking a deep breath as they laid there a moment, letting the roiling heat simmer down.
“You should have left it in the ocean,” Steve murmured to Fury as he left the gym, thinking of how the tesseract was safest out of the hands of anyone or anything.
“I’m sorry,” Pepper finally said, her voice cracking a little as she looked up at Tony with so much sorrow in her eyes. God, what had he done to her?
Laying back against the pillows, Steve pulled Tony on top of him, finding the brunette’s lips once again. The blonde’s hands roamed over every inch of his love’s body, holding onto Tony’s sinewy, muscular back, fingers digging into damp skin. Steve’s thighs clamped against the genius’s sides, knees bent and toes curled as Tony trailed wet, hot kisses along Steve’s neck and defined jaw.
“Good, me neither,” Tony responded, his voice low, licking his bottom lip before leaning down and kissing Steve ravenously. Steve felt the other man’s hand tighten in his hair, and the super soldier let out a rushed breath, his hands securing around Tony’s waist. “We should take this to the bedroom, wouldn’t you say?” Tony said between voracious kisses as he started to grind down against Steve’s thigh. Steve merely whimpered in agreement, overwhelmed by feeling Tony’s body roll against him in languorous waves as he continued to kiss the blonde. Tony just felt so good, his lean, muscular body moving skillfully against Steve’s own.
“It appears you are the only one Sir had given the limitation to,” Steve tried to ignore the sadness that flooded his body then. He wondered if Tony caught him staring at the party the other night. Maybe he figured out Steve’s true affections for him.
“Mhmm,” the blonde answered, digging his dull nails into Tony’s taut flesh as he lost himself in the moment of their love making.
“J?” Tony called to the A.I. as he took another bite of his sandwich.
Then out of nowhere, Nick Fury waltzed into the gym, greeting Steve. The older man told the super soldier of the tesseract, something Steve was all too familiar with sadly. Knowing it was in the hands of an otherworldly foe was terrifying. That kind of power the tesseract had was not to be possessed by anyone. Now Steve would be on a mission, to get the powerful cube back. He couldn’t help but wonder why they were using such an ethereal object.
for you," Tony admitted. "I am just having trouble coming to terms with it all. I am sure you have felt this way too, about the whole thing?" Tony asked.
Tony didn’t take his eyes away from Steve looking at himself in the mirror. The blonde’s bright eyes were wide with intrigue as he looked over himself, almost surprised by how he was reacting to each touch. Tony wasn’t lying when he said Steve was the most gorgeous thing to watch as they had sex.
It was then that Tony broke away from their passionate kissing and guided Steve to turn around. Steve didn’t need to be told anything, quickly understanding what Tony was doing and obliging eagerly.
“We shoulda put a towel down or something,” Steve said, feeling the slide of Tony’s come leak out of his quivering hole and onto the comforter.
Underneath Tony’s handwriting was the address, and Steve saw that that it was in Brooklyn. He tilted the envelope then, a bronze key falling into his palm. Studying it for only a moment, Steve looked up and saw the rest of his team quickly turn their gaze away, grabbing up their gifts and crumpling up the torn wrapping paper.
Flying back to Avengers Tower had held much more dismay than when Tony left earlier that day. On the landing pad, Tony tried to as discreetly as he could make his way up to his penthouse, needing sleep or something, though anger boiled inside his gut. Anger at Pepper, himself, and basically everyone around him.
“You have seen this before, no?” Obadiah said, voice gruff, seeing the merman’s unnatural calm. “Saw your fellow fish friends get a bullet in their gut?” The man chuckled lightly, as did a few of the crew that still surrounded them.
Tony sighed, rubbing a hand over his face as he plopped down into a chair, grabbing a stylus and tapping it on the table. Steve had a few things in his uniform that could always be improved upon, especially penetration into the fabric. Bringing up Steve’s file on the holographic screen, Tony looked over the man’s full body image, spinning it around to look for variables to improve. Besides his shield, the man didn’t have really any other weapons besides his ridiculous super strength and tactical skills.
Tony’s childhood was strange, yes, but still, if he has anything to say about it, was fairly normal.
“Because it obviously affected [Steve] in a negative way!”
But nope.
Breathless.
Yes. Oh.
He, cautiously, agreed.
Everything..
He didn’t even ask him. Didn’t ask if he would like it or if he wanted anything sexual. That was also another thing Jarvis said. “Always ask” Don’t just do.
Howard had his tours.
Because Tony needed him more.
Swinging into water
Of leadership.
“You asked.” He replied.
This was something he used to do. Something that used to make him feel like he had a purpose. Like there was a reason for him to be here at this time at this space doing this thing.
Steve watched the older man walk into the house. The same house that held the young lithe beautiful man.
Not cuz of the person. Not yet.
Easy to be with.
It was very hard for Maria to have children. Or at least keep a child alive.
“What is?” Tony replied, pretending not to know what he was talking about.
“Well, it seems like you do since you’re making stupid decisions!” he shouted back, still leaning.
“Yes?”
And after that intense game of monopoly.
Fuck the word, No.
Tony was a cute nickname.
After an actual kidnapping situation though, Steve doesn’t like to think of that anymore.
Ever since he was little. He was always
Steve had slouched further into his chair. He hated when Fury did this. He asked what was wrong in the weirdest way and Steve would answer after deciphering the danm question. And Fury always gave him the shittiest answers.
“Whenever you feel this way Tones, I need you to call me, kay?” He had mumbled as he wrapped gauze after gauze along the other's wrist.
She was this weird mixture between an annoying older sister and super sexy girlfriend. They kissed maybe once, and Steve had promised a dance with her right before he hit the ice.
His second month he was led outside and taken out to a restaurant by a few of the SHEILDS Agents. Agent Coulson, Agent Romanoff, and Nick Fury himself. They ate sandwiches and people watched. The outing lasted 45 minutes. During that time Steve had scribbled on a napkin a request for a sketchbook and pens and pushed it towards Agent Romanoff. They hadn’t realized that Steve’s blank stares where him actually observing everything around him.
When Maria and Howard laid together it was the first time in a long, long time. Years had passed since their last child died and tonight, well, tonight they had gotten incredibly drunk. It was a gala they were both expected at, and they had played their game of husband and wife well. And with enough drinks and enough lies, you begin to believe anything. Even when it comes out of your own mouth.
In and out.
Natasha laughed harder as Steve fumed and waved him off. “Oh, Calm Down Rogers. It’s funny. I haven’t laughed like this in a while! Hah, why are you always making me laugh like this? Ahhh…Was it good though? Did you enjoy yourself?”
He kept this mantra in his head, during the good times, during the dark times, during the incredibly dark times, during the ice.
Steve would never say this out loud, but he never got his old Tony back. It’s not a good or bad thing. It’s just something he’s noticed as they aged. He left a part of himself in that cave. A huge part of his life changed when he got back. Things were different now. More different than before.
It took time.
He had thought it would be hot??…
Steve was very, very tired. Which kind of sucks for someone who's supposed to be in their early twenties.
Everything. Happens. For. A. Reason.
He looked so…
And each other.
Act as a bodyguard to both Yinsen and child (really young man). Make sure Yinsen and said young man are not killed while also investigating why they are being threatened in the first place. They claim to not have a reason, but there was always a reason. Always something fishy going on. Especially when SHEILD was concerned.
Maria couldn’t bear it.
“So mom and dad had no reason. They just did what they did just because?”
*****
Steve shook his head. Blinked hard. Took a deep breath. Told himself, no. Pressed his com to his ear and muttered an “I’m going in” to Nat. And went inside.
Breathless. And mint.
“NO NATASHA!! I DIDN’T HAVE-HAVE…I didn’t sleep with anyone like that!!!”
The exhaustion of his entire body.
Steve looked at Tony who had his eyes concentrated at the cars parked around them.
Funnily enough, that’s why Steve didn’t do it.
Steve didn’t go crazy when he was first given money. He didn’t know what to do with it. He never had money before. He slowly got comfortable though.
They both can’t explain it
“He’s the only good thing about this time”
He left parts out, it’s hard to get everything in. All those details.
Anger. Passion. Lust.
Steve was so mad he swore he could crush a building with just his fists.
They did, however, still loved each other. Throughout everything.
But Steve was used to his makeup. Said he liked it.
Tony had spoken about it once when they were both lying in bed shirtless gazing at some stars through the window. Steve remembers he was comfortable and wearing borrowed pajama pants and cuddling in the blankets, and Tony still had some glitter on his eyelids.
“He’s a baby, Howard.”
“Why did [Tony] have to bring it up anyway?”
His Dad may have had an obsession...
A long, long time ago, once, they had both dreamed of two or three kids running through their lawn. The sprinklers running while they ran in and out yelling at each other and having fun. Maybe Howard would be in his study. Maybe Maria would be out there with them. Maybe a dog. Or a cat.
Unfortunately though, right before Tony’s third birthday, his parents were killed in a dreadful car accident. Leaving Tony with the butler.
Obviously.
Neither of them knew this at the time of this story though. So let’s get back to that.
Easy to trust.
Things got slowly better. Furn helped. Natasha and Clint helped. Drawing helped.
He quiets them down with soft kisses and long hugs.
Once. Once they dreamed and thought as they laid together at night in their big empty home.
“I don’t need a father figure, Nick. I had a dad and he’s fucking gone and I don’t want a replacement. Don’t pretend like you fucking care. Or that you know me.”
“Slow down Tony. What am I always telling you? Hmm? Go slow”
Steve’s whole big man composure faltered but he didn't morph back into his shyness.
On February 2, 1992, Steve was recruited for a mission concerning a bunch of old rich white men doing some illegal stuff, like laundering money and plotting murder. The usual stuff. Steve didn’t think much about it. He was the muscles of this group of theirs, not quite a leader anymore. He was just going to punch, kick, and get back to his cat. He was even going to attempt to read a book from this century. Super quick. In and out.
“I thought you knew.”
“Spoiled? You think I’m fucking spoiled because I like one thing about this time?! One! ONE GOOD THING and you want me to drop it. Fuck you, Nick, I don’t need you parenting me.”
Maybe.
“But he’s pretty.”
And found out that Yinsen never made it to the conference.
Steve ended up getting an emotional support cat. One day, Natasha knocked on his door and was holding a cat. When Steve continued to stare and didn’t sneeze she handed the cat over and put some cat toys, bed, and food into his entryway.
Arno.
He was still swinging, in and out of the sprinklers.
They ended up moving him into an apartment a few doors down from another agent, Clint. Clint and Natasha resided together, however, Natasha claimed that she really didn’t live there because she was always on missions. She managed to eat breakfast with Steve every day though and all three of them had dinner together.
He remembers one Christmas when Jarvis had gotten him a bike. He was nine and honestly, given the right tools, he would’ve built one himself, but this one was special. It was a baby bright blue street bike. Nothing amazing. Normal brakes and adjustable seat for when he grew. Pedaled normally and could get him from point A to point B when Jarvis wasn’t around to take him anywhere.
Steve knew of those books that portrayed the girl like some kind of dream character. Like a doll that was barely a person. She’d come in and change the guy and then once he was done with her, would leave and be better. Leaving her and her magic behind.
Both were innocent bystanders in this whole situation.
Shouldn’t have been sitting outside on a swinging bench
“That’s funny. My butler used to tell me that all the time.”
That evening Steve spent it drawing everything he could remember from that outing. The next day he was out of his room, people watching again. He stepped outside and watched. He walked a few blocks away from their building and watched. He sat on a bench and watched.
“How would you know??”
All for the bundle right next to him, wrapped in a thick wool blanket attached to medical equipment. He tugged Tony tighter against him as he imagined what he would do to Obadiah Stane. That’s not what hero’s thought. But fuck this man.
“Uh. Yes, sir. That’d be me.”
And that was all.
They had trouble naming Tony right off the bate. Hadn’t planned on even giving him a name. Thought he would be dead. But then one week passed, then two, then a whole month. And one month turned into two, and in the middle of the third, it was getting ridiculous.
Steve straightened “And do you know..If he..If he knows?…about?…’bout?..”
She eyed him under her long eyelashes as he walked in and out of SHIELDS kitchen. Just something about him seemed...
Steve tensed more at that.
He also had his own problems and his own bad dreams and triggers and thoughts.
And he’d dream a lot.
“Steve?” Tony called again trying one last effort. He slowly scooted towards the other, eyeing him just in case he bolted.
Where he could possibly freeze
The first outing wasn’t that awkward. Everyone assumed he was probably “slow” (which is what the old lady behind the counter whispered to another). Nobody corrected them, and at least they were extra nice to him when he went out by himself the first couple of times.
But there’s something about each other that makes everything about loving someone sort of. Easy.
But Steve ...Well
“I don't ...Yinsen wants to talk.”
Tony had chuckled drunkenly, playing with the now empty glass bottle on his left.
They found him in the desert.
Steve finished with Tony’s arm and gently patted his thigh to make sure the band-aid was staying in place. He then gently placed his hands on Tony’s cheeks and kissed his forehead.
What is not, is not.
Despite it being during his time, that was something he just about missed.
But still after Thor and Loki, and meeting the Hulk, and creating the team, Tony and Steve decide to go out on a date. Something not too serious, not like a fancy dinner. Something like old times. Tony had suggested roller skating. Roller Skating around the neighborhood together, like they used to.
Steve had let him talk. He liked to listen to Tony ramble. But then he said
And you know ...Steve thought about it.
He does, however, like to think of the ways he’d save Tony.
“ANTHONY EDWARD GET INSIDE”
Tennis. And vacations. Family trips. And dinners. Lounging on the couch together. And Christmas. Seeing them grow up. Getting too big to sit in between mom and dad in the pews at church. Drinking soda pop with their friends and riding bikes. Tennis shoes thrown around and messy unmade beds and prim and proper dresses and wrinkled slacks. Scuffed shoes and nail polish.
“I know”
Howard and Maria stayed very far away from children.
He really hopes he never has to save him for real though.
“I’m not a sir…Captain actually”
But there were no missions, no saving the day, no best friends, or churches that made sense.
He had to look up what a support animal was. What made the cat…So special?
“Don’t know what ya talkin bout” Was all he said, eyes closed.
Steve just stared up at Fury from where he was sitting. Eyes small, slouch heavy. Steve didn’t feel strong. He didn’t feel valuable. He didn’t feel alive.
In fact, they lasted a week and actually gave them hope that maybe, with the right technology, they could save this one.
“Rogers?!”
In through your nose, out through your mouth.
That’s where he learned the importance of music. Steve didn’t know of it until he met Tony.
It was not like old times when they kissed. It was a battle. Fighting to rule.
If they were alive long enough to see Tony start to talk and understand, they would’ve explained that there was no rhyme nor reason as to why they did it. Why they had him wear dresses and suits. He looked good in them and that was that. And that as long as he was happy they would buy him whatever clothes he wanted.
She asked if he wanted to stay here.
Like mint.
New Year.
He didn’t say anything when Tony laughed as well, saying
But after that night with the failed blowjob, both Steve and Tony were awkward for a bit.
He really should’ve headed Jarvis’s advice now.
They still didn’t do anything remotely sexual until four months later, when they awkwardly dry humped with their jeans on in the bed and it hurt like hell but they both still came.
It is not his fault.
Steve continued to stare at Tony some more, expression unreadable. Tony stared back, searching.
But they didn’t. And they were together.
“I’m fucking exhausted.”
“Yeah, I thought it was obvious?”
Steve had stared into those glittery eyes and caressed Tony’s cheek.
Yinsen never talked when Steve was there. They had conversations, but the older man liked having Tony privately with him when they spoke of more serious things. He found it rude to make Steve wait outside or in another room.
Roller Skating.
Steve grew up attending church with his mother every Sunday. He sat in the fourth pew, 2 pews in front of Bucky and his large family. The priest would say over and over;
He didn’t like to think about Peggy much though.
And full of confidence.
Tony sighed knowing he definitely fucked up. Didn’t ask. Didn’t slow down.
Steve loved Tony. Liked LOVED loved him. Like definitely was going to marry the guy once they were old enough and had money and all that. He didn’t need nor want SHEILDS permission. Part of Steve’s fantasy was whisking the great Tony Stark away and never looking back. But he knew with the company and everything, that he actually couldn’t do that. But one could dream.
Fuck.
Steve has. A LOT. Of confusing thoughts.
-Romans 8:28
Agent Romanoff found him and officially introduced herself. Natasha.
“Well get inside then huh!?”
Not with him.
“Shouldn’t you be inside? It’s pretty cold!” He shouted
Tony, never one to doubt himself really, pulled out a newspaper clipping from one of his father's diaries. And cleared his throat.
“Bout what?” Steve had said lazily. Head lolling back taking in the breeze in his leather jacket.
They ended up both crying on the floor of the living room declaring their love for each other, idiots, and kissed heatingly.
He got over it when Tony reached for him and pulled him onto his tiny hospital bed.
“Slow down Tony. Take a breath.”
“Sometimes we don’t know why Tones. Sometimes things are because they are. Not everything has to have an answer or a reason, love.”
Steve spent his days outside his apartment drawing on the little balcony of his apartment. He had already accumulated over one hundred sketchbooks and kept on requesting more. He also had a weird love of plants. They think it’s because New York these days didn’t have a lot of trees and it sucked the life out of you. Eventually, Nick ended up getting tired of all the requests Steve was making and forced Clint to teach Steve how to get up, walk to the store down the street and buy his own shit.
Tony never really headed Jarvi’s advice.
He…sort of.. Had to.
WOAHZA Hold up there.
“I’m sorry” he muttered. Tony shook his head and cuddled into Steve’s hair, breathing in the Irish spring scent.
Maria had her occasional photoshoot.
“There is an appointed time for everything. And there is a time for every event under heaven–”
Steve often forgot he was supposed to be doing a job.
Steve thought of all the things. How he didn’t sleep at night despite having Furn there. How he always felt COLD even with the heated blanket and the heater and the no air-con and hot tea. How his thoughts always swarmed and kept him up and made him want to puke.
Lol. Seriously?
It was summertime and he was still watching Tony. He still had a small gun behind his belt loop and a pocket knife in his pocket wherever he went. And that entire summer they would get on bikes or rollerblade to the nearest store, or even take the bus across town to catch a weird movie. And every time Steve would always be so careful with him. Always so overprotective. And if asked, he would say that, yes, it was for the job, but honestly. He just loved protecting Tony. He’d be a hero for him.
“What Natasha?!” Steve stood at his full height, shoulders back, back completely straight. His voice was loud and strong and although his face was still beet red he didn’t look like the stumbling boy from two seconds ago.
Natasha laughed harder, he looked like a bug!
Steve smiled looking down. “The blue around your eyes. I like it with your pink lips.” And he kissed Tony.
What is to be done is done. Things happen for a reason. This is certain.
At night. When no one was watching him. He could’ve just...Done it quickly. Knew how. Quiet. Alone. Quick.
In later years, when the whole family could do this, they’d hold hands and have contests on who could get to the bottom the fastest.
The old man looked crazed. His thin glasses sliding down his narrow nose and his beady eyes squinting dangerously at Steve.
“Not a soul” Tony replied, holding Steve’s hand now. Hell if he was letting go.
Silly…silly stupid Tony.
The next evening they had gone rollerskating along the street. The man at the gas station looked at Tony funny and eyed his eye makeup and bandages along his wrists.
Steve was still standing outside where the car was parked on the other side of the street, but he swore that little water droplets were sprinkled on top of the young man’s eyelashes making them sparkle.
Steve opened his mouth to tell him but was interrupted by a loud bang.
When Tony finally got a look at him that one February day it clicked into place so quickly that Tony had to physically squint his eyes shut from the sudden realization. Steve and Yinsen had given him strange looks but he had brushed them off.
They were sent a tape. That’s how they found him. Somehow, they were able to grab Tony and smuggle him across the country and force him to make them weapons of mass destruction. When they had realized that keeping him alive was a lot better than killing him, they had sent a video.
When Maria was able to finally bring a child into the world, after countless miscarriages, it had apparently been born with so many difficulties that it never left the little box it was put into the moment they got out of the womb.
God, that night had been amazing.
Babies, out of the womb, are straight-up ugly.
The stupid old fucked up of a man who still had ties to Tony and the money and who wanted to get both Tony and Yinsen out of the way so he could get all of Stark’s everything!
“Sure as fuck I will”
“Steve I’m gonna sit right next to ya okay? Okay, sport?”
Steve was curled in on himself hyperventilating after Tony attempted to suck his dick.
It was an abnormally hot winter day, the weather wasn’t freezing but still a bit cold, and the young man should’ve been wearing at least a light jacket. Should’ve been covered up inside with his book and maybe a hot chocolate. Maybe some tea.
For Furn?
*****
However, he still couldn’t wrap this thing around his head.
If he could, he’s sure that his own subconscious would’ve suppressed the memories of being in the dark cold solitude. Nobody asked him if he did remember though. Nobody could get a word out of him in the first couple of months he was awake, so there wasn’t really a time to ask. After he began speaking, it had already been enough time that it would’ve been considered incredibly rude and insensitive, so that curious person should just shut the fuck up and turn around.
Was he making sense?
Tony was a genius. A genius and a billionaire.
Tony turned four and asked Edwin Jarvis why there were pictures of him in both dresses and suits. What were his parents' intentions? Why did they want that? And Edwin Jarvis could not explain, as he did not know, but asked if he liked it or not. To that Tony crossed his arms and harrumphed, not liking that his question was deflected.
Interesting.
Tony.
“You did?”
Sometimes Steve thinks if it was really a great idea for him to join the army. To be Captain America.
To be honest, if Steve had to describe this moment in his life, he would say that he felt like a doll. Or an action figure if you will. An action figure that was so well loved and that was being passed around and talked about and shown off, but never…given the time…to…get to know? Steve didn't have the right words for it. But he felt like this special thing and not a person. And he always felt like he was watching from above and not through his own eyes.
Maria and Howard named them anyway.
Steve read the file a little more, eyes hovering over the kid's picture. How much he resembled the cocky ass genius from back then. Who was a friend. Who helped. Who was now gone.
Later in the years, after they’ve had the many huge blowouts, breaks, attempts, another break, and then officially finally get back together and stay together, they will both realize that throughout it all, they never really promised each other to stay friends. And they’re really happy they didn’t force that upon themselves in a weird way. That they didn’t give themselves that expectation.
“Just open the goddamn page Rogers.”
Different.
And after that one huge move of house that literally could’ve split their family apart.
“I gotta feed my cat, Tones. Maybe tomorrow though.” He really wanted to. Sleep over. Because Steve was afraid. Of leaving Tony by himself.
Laying there in the hospital for days and days not saying a word. Headphones on his head with the music blaring loud. Steve remembers curling next to him after Tony offered another pair, and together they listened to almost everything.
She sometimes worried at how easy it was to read him. Did he allow everyone to see him like this? The Stark kid was pretty quick to catch on to him as well.
“Hey!”
Honestly though. He just looked cute in all clothing.
It didn’t matter.
But sometimes.
Steve shot up at that, knocking his chair over.
“Did you fuck?”
MISSION.
They humped, she finally conquered and starting chuckling into her coffee mug. Steve’s head immediately shot down to look at her, his eyes ablaze.
He met Tony on February 2, 1992.
Steve never really had the chance to fall in love.
“Thank you,” he had said in the doorway leaving Fury to sit alone.. With a loud sigh and a hand-rubbed across his face, Fury got up.
How could you not?
He had wondered what it would be like smeared across…
The older man gruffed and gave Steve a hard stare.
*****
He wanted to hurt him.
That morning, Tony woke up first and watched Steve’s even breath. Let him sleep longer. And when Steve woke up with a fright, rambling about missing a morning run Tony shushed him and said he was twenty-two years old. And twenty-two year olds slept in on Saturdays still, no matter who they were.
A young, lith thing.
“Captain America? Unless you’ve told him.”
“No really. Stever Rogers is my uncle.”
Would…
“I don’t care what I wear, I just wanted to know WHY?! Why is ANYTHING, ANYTHING JARVIS? No one ever tells me WHY.”
“We…We!…” Steve sighed and finally opened his eyes but stared up at the ceiling. “We just…you know..Fooled around. No…none of what yer saying Nat…just…just some foolin around.”
Like they wish you were there cuz Fuck. So hot.
If she could just put her finger on it.
Peggy. Now Peggy was confusing.
Everything..may happen?..for...
Honestly to this day he still doesn’t know. It is nice, however, when Furn sleeps on his chest by his neck. It isn’t so cold at night.
He was always fast.
Maybe they do. Maybe they don’t.
*****
“I’m here to protect you silly. It’s my job to have this pressure. And I wouldn’t want anything more than for you to be safe and sound.”
A few days after everything, Tony had called for a press conference and made a very big decision. Everyone told him he was being irrational, too impulsive, that maybe he could just wait a while and think about this, please??
Maybe their son would be running with the dog shooting a toy gun at nothing.
“He has a penis, Howard.”
A month later, he found out about Tony being a Stark. And asked why he never told him.
In the future, when things are slow in the late afternoon and the sun is out and hot, Natasha will comment and say, “You know, you used to say fuck a lot.”
Maria and Howard Stark were possibly never meant to have children.
Sorry, Jarvis.
Everything. Happens...
Tony had woken up to an empty bed, which never happened, and had learned that Steve went out for a morning run. “He always did” apparently. Tony made his way to the garage were him and Yinsen usually worked and began to tinker. His robots rolled around him, looking for things to do, and he drowned himself in whatever he could get his hands on.
Natasha found out immediately that it was the first time Steve had come in…. A while.
Let’s just say he didn’t want to do anything “stupid” with Furn there.
He thought this through. No more weapons. No more. No. More.
Fury sighed into his coffee.
“That’s a lot of pressure to put on yourself Mr. Steve”
Noone had asked Steve if he was okay. They made sure he was okay, but nobody ever asked. Tony asked. And he asked again once and twice and three times more that night until Steve broke down crying, telling him everything. Everything that was on his mind.
“And we know that God causes all things to work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose”
“You! Who are you!?”
And how’d he take care of him.
*****
Steve knew Tony hadn’t picked up his skates since that time.
His life wasn’t terrible. Yeah, his parents died in a terrible death right before he turned four. And his father figure/butler/ guardian passed away from an awful cancer right before he graduated university at seventeen. But his life wasn’t terrible.
Steve smiled back.
-Ecclesiastes 3:1
Tony didn’t do a great coping thing.
Edwin Jarvis, the butler/war hero/full-time babysitter of Howard Stark and loving best friend insisted that they’d put their drunken minds together and think of a proper name for this proper child.
Tall.
Emphasis on the WAS.
“Is this some kind of joke?” Steve muttered, exhausted.
Tried not to dwell over not protecting Tony and being there for him and for fucking up his one fucking job---
Tony makes them better though.
Tony scoffed, “Oh c’ mon Steve.”
“You didn’t have protection? Now Steve I know you’re new to this time, but even when having sex with male you have to use pro-”
They stayed staring at Tony’s feet for a while until Jarvis finally sat him on his lap and read him a long story about an Alice and a talking doorknob and an ice queen.
Tony had already known that Steve was Captain America.
Terribly.
Anthony Edward Stark was typed in bold letters at the top of the page. Below was his age, weight, blood type, ID number, social security number and parents names.
Steve woke up on September 5, 1991.
But they didn’t.
They ended up moving in together at Steve’s old apartment. Tony didn’t have a place to go after...and he really didn’t want to be alone, so. They kept Tony’s bed, and his posters, and all of Jarvis’s pots and pans and cutlery and kettles and tea sets and dishes. They moved Steve’s plants around, and Furn got used to the extra furniture and all of Yins and Tony’s books. It wasn’t a happy move. Stressful and long because Tony could still barely move. And he ended up buying a downstairs apartment and renovated it into a type of workshop where he could build in a place he trusted, while also being with Steve. It was a long couple of days. A long month.
Everything. Happened. For. A. Reason.
Something about being the bigger person.
“Uh…” Steve stumbled. “The..Bodyguard?”
Tony stayed a good distance away from Steve, allowing him to breathe for a sec as he clung to his crotch.
He’d sometimes be dressed up in little cute dresses and sometimes little suits. Wear cute bows with his dungarees. Wear a striped t-shirt with suspenders and a skirt with dirty little tennis shoes.
Jarvis, startled by the sudden outburst, stared at the chocolate brown eyes and pouting chubby cheeks and the little lips that were beginning to wobble.
Tony remembers how he immediately fell and almost cracked his head open.
Poor little one lasted three and a half hours.
Steve didn’t want to think.
Tony knew who he was from a very early age.
But Tony.
Curly top on his head, loose cotton button-up shirt, and fitted blue jeans. He was sitting lazily on a swinging bench, swinging back and forth, in and out of the sprinklers that where watering the front lawn.
He still considered calling them as Tony slept on his chest, plastic, and paper from the bandages still on the edge of the bed, almost forgotten.
To Obadiah Stane.
Tony had teared up and listened to every word. Told him he missed his Mama too. Missed his butler and even missed his dad. Listened to Steve and held him close in his bed until Steve went to sleep.
He grew up looking at the pictures of him and his dad. Anything to get more clues as to who Howard Stark was and what he was doing with the world. He saw so many Captain America pictures in his dad's old office. He saw even more of Steve Rogers in the diaries.
That evening Nick stopped by the debriefing room where Steve had resided. A cup of coffee on the table untouched and a sketchbook in his lap. Steve sat with his feet on the table boots off near his chair. His body seemed relaxed. But Nick could see the tension in his neck. The hard stare in his eyes.
Tony, being eighteen,  always tried really hard to show him what it was like to be a “young adult” these days. How people still went to parties and clubs and dates, everything was just louder and full of more color. And grabbing a coffee and reading books in a quiet space was still cool, you just wore different clothes.
Tony made it look so easy.
He had assured Steve that he hadn’t done it in a while. That, if anything, was almost better since hanging out with him.
They drank their slushies and shared some Nerds candy outside. It was getting late. Tony should be getting home soon.
Bullshit.
But he couldn’t. Because falling asleep for a long time made him think of…
To the doctors and agents around him, Tony wouldn’t say a word. But Steve could understand the language Tony was saying through the type of music he would play. How his still blood crusted fingers would switch the tapes after certain songs and how there was barely a moment of silence. Yeah, during this time, Steve knew what Tony was saying. And thinking.
Nat stared at him as he stared at the ceiling. Was he counting the light bulbs?
Sometimes nights were just so bad, you know?
He didn’t though.
That had been the last time he saw him.
“It’s from fighting a bear!” He said, hands up in a box fighting position and Steve had to drag him out.
To his surprise, Steve did not look at him with shock or start a fight or even denied him. He continued to stare at the file almost relieved and after another while, silently closed it.
Natasha enjoyed how Steve shut his eyes tight and stood rigged. He sometimes slouched to appear smaller, she noticed. He would hang his head low and hide behind her or Clint during debriefs or huge company meetings. He hated appearing like how he used to in the posters.
Steve didn’t know how the young man could look both startled and calm and collected at the same time. He looked over at him, still swinging, a puzzled look on his face.
“Are you sure he’s a boy?” His father had asked looking at the long eyelashes and chubby cheeks.
-2 Corinthians 4:15
He decided to tell Steve himself after two months. It was taking too long.
He was still living.
“Then you should talk to him.”
Everything. Happens. For. A. Reason.
They had let their guard down.
Anyway, here he was, going through the motions like he always did. Fighting and punching bad guys trying to access data they weren’t supposed to have. Days blended together, then weeks. Then suddenly it was  New Year's Eve and Steve knocked some racist fuckers teeth out as it hit midnight. When Clint suggested celebrating Steve politely declined and stayed in his room for three weeks.
“I love you and your oldness,” Steve said against his skin, snickering.
The men plated the food once it was ready, sitting at the dining room table that could seat ten, eating happily and enjoying one’s comforting presence. “How’d I do?” Tony asked after a while, sipping his black coffee. Steve smiled boyishly, peering at his empty plate then.
“Hey, Pep. What you’re tired?” He asked with a chuckle.
What do you mean it has been almost a year since I updated this story?? *shifts awkwardly* I promise to update much  more frequently now that I have some more free time! I really love these two characters!
"Well," Tony started, brushing a hand in his hair. "Not too weird. I had one of those too a while back, of a prehistoric couple...and it was like I knew them. But with all this talk of soulmate stuff, it is probably in our subconscious," Tony added. But there was something about how Tony said everything, and his facial expression that caused Steve to wonder if the genius was holding back something about the subject.
“Yes, indeed. It’s okay?” The genius queried, his wet hand slipping between the blonde’s legs, up the cleft of his bum and to his stretched opening.
"Steve," Tony beamed, holding his hand tightly. "How are you feeling?"
Steve felt himself finally tire again, and he went inside, treading softly up the wooden staircase. He went to the couch, only to stare at it. Folding the blanket and laying it on the back of the sofa, Steve looked over to the bed then. Tony told him he could sleep in the bed too, that he didn’t mind sharing it with Steve. He really should just sleep on the couch and let that be the end of it. Steve knew himself well enough to know that he would be sorrowful when tomorrow rolled around, and he would never be able to sleep in the same bed as Tony again. But, the temptation of being so close to Tony was much more overpowering, and Steve relented.
“What’s Steve up to?” Tony asked, spinning an apple slice on the plate.
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve twisted the sheets in his hands, eyes clamped shut while forcing himself to stop the inappropriate thoughts that were running rampant in his mind. It was wrong of him to indulge in such fantasies when his friend was rightfully with his girlfriend. Steve needed to just be grateful for being friends with Tony. He certainly knew Steve more than most people. If Steve wore his heart on his sleeve and Tony found out about how Steve really felt, it could ruin their friendship entirely. Steve’s jealously and libido were not worth that risk.
“Sir,” J.A.R.V.I.S.’s voice echoed then through the communal area, interrupting the men’s work. “I am informing you that Agent Barton and Agent Romanoff have returned, and are heading for the communal area presently,” the A.I. explained.
“See! And I’m a one trick pony,” Tony laughed, kissing in between Steve’s pectorals. “Gotta make it count.” Tony leaned up then, kissing Steve flush on the lips before kneeling between the man’s legs.
They ate breakfast together, Steve doing most of the cooking while Tony prepped coffee and put bread in the toaster. “So besides paperwork, do you have anything else going on?” Tony asked while munching on that crispy bacon Steve made so well.
After the formalities of shaking hands and giving cheek kisses, Tony excused himself from Rhodey, who was speaking with a military official and headed toward the bar. He really didn’t want to be here. If it weren’t for Rhodey, he’d be back in his penthouse. It was probably good that he was out of the tower, getting some fresh air and seeing other people besides his teammates. Especially Steve.
Tony brought his free hand up to Steve’s chest, tracing his fingertips along his clavicle as he added a second slick finger into him. Steve laid his head against Tony’s shoulder, eyes half lidded as he watched his reflection. Tony loved being able to take Steve apart this way, only to piece him back together with love, affection and sweet kisses. Scissoring his fingers inside his boyfriend, Tony slid his fingers down the crease of where Steve’s pecs met, gliding the palm of his hand over the taut muscles.
“You’re worth more than you think, Tony. It wasn’t your fault, just remember that,” Steve spoke, squeezing his shoulder once before leaning back. It was only then that Tony felt like he could breathe again. He wasn’t sure exactly why he had reacted that way.
“Wish it was your cock,” Steve replied cheekily, and Tony giggled brightly, loving Steve’s smart remark.
Steve shook his head, smiling softly as he picked up the garment then, placing each leg in the bifurcated fabric and slipping it up over himself. Of course, it fit perfectly, the lace straps nestling over his shoulders, his pecs smoothing out the fine silk and chiffon over his chest. Steve could see the outline of his loins under the light weight fabric. He loved how the silk was cool against his warm skin, the difference creating gooseflesh all over his body. Steve went to the bathroom to check how his backside looked. The teddy was backless, exposing all the dips in the super soldier’s muscular back and shoulders. The fabric at the synched in waistline fell over his plush bum, the bottom of each cheek playing peek-a-boo when he moved. Steve fingered the lace there at the bottom of the shorts, tracing the angled hem on his upper thigh.
But then, Tony moved away completely, standing to his feet, causing Steve to look at him with a frustrated and confused expression. “Wha-what’re you-”
“Yeah, Tony?” he asked, fluffing up the pillows.
“No way,” Tony said with the shake of his head. “It’s gotta be one for the books. And hey, friends go on adventures all the time. I mean, that’s how the movies show it. Like
An hour later, Tony was in his laboratory, working on Iron Man suit number, well he wasn’t really sure at this point. But it was getting up there, into the thirties probably.
Slowly, Tony slipped Steve’s knees off his shoulders, unfolding the man from the intimate position carefully. When Tony’s softened penis exited Steve’s body, the blonde squirmed a bit from the sudden loss, his hole winking around emptiness. Tony tenderly pushed two fingers inside his love, caressing the muscle as it relaxed. Steve hummed pleasantly, appreciating how Tony would do such things without any prompting, the man just knowing Steve well enough to do such a loving, sweet act for him.
“If at any point, you are uncomfortable, I’m sure you could easily tear out of that ribbon,” Tony said, leaning back and grasping the hem of his shirt and pulling it over his head. Steve watched, entranced by the revealing of his boyfriend’s naked skin. Even though he saw Tony shirtless, (and naked for that matter) all the time, he still found the man to be a sight to behold. Oh, how he wished to paint the man one day.
Tony felt like he was gonna explode in his pants at the sight of his love kneeling and waiting for him. He merely stared at him before remembering he needed to in fact get undressed. Right. Tony fiddled with his belt buckle as he bolted towards the bedside table, grabbing up a lube from the drawer before practically running back to Steve.
Tony grinned, elated by so many emotions before he took hold of the silky fabric of Steve’s lingerie and pushed it up until Steve’s chiseled belly was exposed. The genius kissed over every crest and trough of the blonde’s lovely abdomen, appreciating how Steve would sigh his name. The super soldier combed a hand in Tony’s thick hair, tugging at it and causing the brunette to let out a moan of his own. Slinking down his love’s body, Tony nibbled at Steve’s inner thighs, the blonde’s legs hiked up, toes curling as the genius’s chin hairs scratched at the tender skin.  The blonde could feel Tony’s warm breath against his clothed arousal, his length twitching with eagerness.
“We’ve got to make a decision about this business deal, son. This possible new client could be just what we need to get Stark Weaponry in the European market,” Obadiah explained. And when Tony continued to look at the business documents in his hand, the older man snatched the papers from the brunette so that Tony would look at him.
“Yeah, sure you do,” Tony said playfully. It was then that Tony turned to look at Steve more clearly, and the blonde saw the man’s brown eyes widen when he saw what the super soldier was wearing. “My my. I’ve not seen that little get up before,” Tony smiled, licking his bottom lip.
“I’m so glad you’re home,” Tony admitted, his head resting on Steve’s shoulder. the blonde leaned down, giving the brunette a loving kiss.
Steve's one hand slid up Tony's chest, gently pulling at the fabric of his shirt before he deepened the kiss, not wanting them to part. Steve never thought he would know the true happiness of having a soulmate, especially when he thought Peggy was his true soulmate. But the way he felt with Tony, the way Tony felt with Steve, it superseded everything Steve had figured it would be with Peggy. He loved Peggy, truly. But it was Tony whom his heart, mind and body belonged to.
"It started out as nothing more than a casual warm itch. But now if I am in the same vicinity as Cap, it pulses and burns," Tony explained, dropping his hand away. "I can't stop thinking about the man, and the wanting of being close to him. The man gave me a hard on just because I thought of his body and muscles, Bruce," Tony rolled his eyes at the whole situation. Bruce chuckled lightly. "It just seems like I should have a choice in all this," Tony murmured.
Back home in New York he was the highlight of galas and balls. Tony would savor those nights where he was encapsulated by the grandiose aristocracy and high society. The most notable names in progressive businesses fancied the chance to throw their beautiful daughters at him, hoping their elegant grace and impressively voluminous bustle dresses would catch Tony’s eye; being involved with the Stark family would be a wondrous success for any titled, high society family.
“Yes,” Kwazoffsky confirmed. “Mr. Stane needs all his people for another event this evening and possibly through the night, so we are taking you both to a safe house until then.”
“I know you are a good man, Tony. Talented, handsome. I know it would be you who’s stepping down on a ladder rung here. I know I don’t have much to my name, but I would treat you fair, and I would let you live your life like you want. And if later, you want to divorce me, I’ll give you that too. With no contest on your assets.”
that one can’t just tell Hulk what he can and can’t do. And then
"...no?"
“Here. That’ll keep it.” He patted Steve’s thigh. “I’m going to keep adding to this until you’re feeling nice and full.”
Exasperated, Steve turned, to look the O in the eye.
Tony rolled his eyes, but compared to how he'd been acting before, it came off as somehow muted, and Steve felt a pang of regret.
Tony had no words to offer, to describe what he was feeling. Something warm and capricious flared up inside him and he smiled tenderly and hit Steve’s cheekbone again on the same spot. And the third time.
Fuck. He never wanted to let go but he had to. He pulled away and stood up. Steve’s gaze was soft, clear and full of adoration and Tony faltered, his planned cruel smirk morphing on something softer.
Steve rubbed his forehead.
Payne produced a pair of handcuffs and quirked his eyebrow at Tony, who sighed, but held out his wrists.
Next, he picked up the shorter length of one clamp with a tiny carabinier fixed to it.
“You’re mine now, Steve,” he said, trying to sound ominous, pulling on the chains and playing with the button on the remote. “You’re mine,” he whispered, leaving the vibrator on the random pattern setting.
You know that Steve is a brilliant strategist, right? You can’t possibly believe that his actual goal wasn’t getting Hulk and Clint completely worked up and betting that the other couldn’t sneak quietly enough!
“You need some fresh air in here,” he said flatly, turning around and setting his feet towards the kitchen. “You coming?”
Steve blinked. Was he talking to the bike? Oh god, he was. Stark's fingers were lightly caressing the machine's flank and Steve's eyes tracked the movement. His mouth went dry. Emitting alpha pheromones was the last thing he needed right now. Clint in a tutu. Phillips putting on lipstick. A concentration camp in Azzano.
“Nah. Got some family here though. The garage owner is my uncle, he happened to need some hospital rest for a bit, so I decided to spend my gap year here. Match made in heaven, really.” There was a brief pause and then Steve heard a quiet murmur, “Harley, darling, talk to me.”
