It’s better to say that he’s Steve’s. His only, his one person. His sense of belonging in a life that has never worn right on him until Steve tailored it. Steve trimmed his bad sleep schedule, took shears to his ugly drinking habits, darned every difficult task until Tony either found them easy to do or they went fully to Steve.
“I made dinner,” Steve tries, coaxing Tony closer, trying to relay that he’s not going to hurt him.
“I’m not moping, I’m waiting.”
“Yes, yes I thought of it, ok? In my workshop, over the bench, your fat Alpha cock pinning me, nowhere to go, nothing to be but yours!” Tony spits the words with something like hate in his voice, but by the end he sounds hoarse, broken as he finishes.
“Black Widow thinks so, which means Fury thinks so.”
“Then I guess we’re ready to start our new life together.” Tony barrels past Steve and out the door into the hallway beyond. Steve follows after him.
“For Tony, then.”
“No, Tony. I’ll just go. If that’s what you want.”
“Oh-kay Tony, let’s get you another drink, yes?”
It takes a bit, but his knot works its way out of its own accord, and Steve falls to the side, Tony laying down on his stomach next to him.
But it seemed Tony didn’t want anything more from Steve at all.
Tony shifts his weight to his left leg, putting a hand up in defense. “Hey, hey--you don't know if they matter or not. To me, anyway. I--they bring back good memories, I think. And they're also . . . cute.” Tony takes one of the headbands from Steve's calloused hands, inspecting it himself. He flicks at the bells.
Captain America is totally, absolutely,
Tony looked up from his armor's arm, a piece of bread hanging from his mouth. He quickly put his tools down and took the snack out from between his teeth after taking a bite and said, “Hey, baby. What's up?”
The whole night Tony's been chugging down beers and reading through Howard's old files, letting his sober thoughts come stumbling out of his drunken mouth.
Steve's face heated, but he smiled gratefully.

When they arrived there, Tony didn't even
And maybe . . . Tony is doing the same thing.
Tony thought for a moment, then shrugged. “Peter.”
Tony thought for a moment. “Very well. Let's talk.” He sounded as if they were going to move to a more private area such as an office, but the brunette just stayed where he was, now just slumping against the conference table to feel more comfortable.
Just then, there was a knock on the glass door and then a quiet pitter patter into the room.
corrupted by his own power, never seen a man with such power like Tony Stark keep himself up so gracefully.
Tony could see the concern flood Steve's face and that made him grin, half because he didn't know what he was doing, and half because Steve worrying about him always made him feel warm inside.
The one-story building was a bar, blasting with music that could deafen you even if you were a mile from it. Steve was already squinting his eyes and blocking an ear to muffle the sound.
After a moment of silent flicking and flacking, Steve finally says, “This is usually something you wear near Christmas, Tony. You know that, right?”
Tony bolted upright, ready to backhand Steve in the face for being so shameless--despite himself--but before he could the captain was already feet away, talking to Bruce.
When Steve got his idea, he chuckled and began working. He made sure to work slowly so he could build up suspense in Tony’s impatient eyes and to also make the shape nice and realistic. It had to be
“See, that's the thing! He
Tony cut him off with a hug, breathing out relieved against the super soldier's neck. “Oh my god . . . “ He exhaled shakily. “Oh my god . . . “
“You know what?” Tony said, his eyes narrowing and a tight smile forming. “Steven Grant Rogers, you might just be the worst person I've ever met.”
Tony quickly stood, and so did the blond. “Actually, I know Tony Stark. I'll go get him for you!” The criminal said, then he bolted right out that door. The second the breeze hit him was the second all sounds turned off except for his frantic breaths as he condemned his legs to move faster than a cheetah's.

“Put your hands up!” The cop demanded, and Tony did so. The blond approached him cautiously, almost making it to grabbing distance before Tony, a dumbass, made a break for it. Needless to say . . . he didn't succeed in his escape.
Tony closed his eyes again and managed a hoarse chuckle. "Y-you can say this at my funeral if you want, but . . . You w-were always my favorite d-dumbass."
Oh, Steve, you are quite possibly the worst joker I've ever met.”

intoxicated, for that matter.
“Oh, god, Tony . . . “ Steve muttered, beginning to throw himself at the boulder, only being able to move it at least a centimeter. He couldn't continue his efforts, however, as the more the captain tried, the closer Tony was to screaming his lungs out.

was he extra sometimes.
Steve is shameless when drunk, so when he sees Tony, he gasps and pushes Clint away, stumbling so severely he might've fallen at least three times attempting one step if it not had been for the wall.
“I know, but--your words don't make me change my opinion on him. Maybe he was a good man, a helluva inventor, sure, but he wasn't a good father. When I was younger I used to think he really did want to spend time with me, but work was just too much. But I know now that that wasn't true. He had multipl chances to come spend time with me, but he chose to build Stark Industries instead of enforcing the stability of his family.” Tony glanced at Steve, who was now leaned against the desk with his arms crossed, and sighed, shaking his head.
It didn't take long until Steve was on top of him, pulling at his lapels urgently as a sloppy attempt to strip him naked.
a little bit of soulmate au at the end?
“I know. Which is why you're a puzzle. Who can be less
“Ajahjahahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, I'll be going--” Steve wheezed, waving awkwardly to the two (but mostly to Tony, who was still red in the face) before dashing off.
But unfortunately, Tony Stark hadn't turned up in bed for two weeks in a row.
“You aren't any of those things to me, Tony.” Steve commented.
Immediately, Steve's pale cheeks were tinted the softest shade of pink, and from here on out he just
. . . “ He could barely make out dark shades of red on his armor, some dried, some newly splattered. Is that . . .
Captain America realized he had feelings for Tony. Even the brunette himself had suspicions--not that anyone caught him complaining.
“Yeah. I know.” He nods after Steve was upright again and tending to his temporarily forgotten coffee. He fiddles with the reindeer headband, flicking at the bells dangling near the ends of the antlers.
And went they went home, Steve tucked Tony into bed and left.
It's all applause to Howard, really. He made Tony work until he had no more bones to have crumble; until he had no more sweat to shed; until there was no more coffee to be drunken. It was a pain to the brunette both physically and mentally.
Tony had caught himself complaining about Steve indirectly countless times to his friends Bruce Banner, a genius with a temper, and Clint, the best player in soccer and Romanoff's boyfriend. He would always groan and say things like, "He's such a riddle and I hate it." And then the boys would always ask, "Who are you talking about?" And then Tony would freeze and say awkwardly, "No one. Just some asshole in my class."
“Like, what even am I compared to you in school standards? Emo? A loner? Geek? Nerd? That's really hilarious.” Tony sat back up, continuing to watch Steve stitch.
Tony turns to face him, an eyebrow perked. “Yeah?”
on his mind all the time.
Steve laughed, draping the jacket over Tony's slumped shoulders. “I took my time with this one, baby. Come on, give me credit.”
Steve smiled softly. "Of course. You do the same, okay boyfriend?"
Tony cleared his throat awkwardly and then blurted, “I fucked a cop.”
He was the kind of guy you'd love to be friends with simply because of who he was. Not even the popular kids would care for his money or how poorly he lived or anything like that. They'd just care because Steve is Steve, and yet Tony only ever found three people talking to him. Natasha Romanoff, the head of the girl's basketball team, Sam Wilson, a runner in track, and Bucky Barnes, a player in football. All of them fairly well-known people, but at the same time average and not overwhelmed with friendships.
Steve rolled his eyes, holding his own smile in so he wouldn't break his serious facade.
Steve always thought he had good self-control. It was rare that he ever let anything slip off his tongue--even in those worst-case scenarios--but when it
Steve kissed down Tony's face silently, forehead to chin, purposely leaving his lips kissless. He missed Tony's face, and his hugs, and his little annoying comments when he's trying to be affectionate.
So what happened just now still has the blond confused (and embarrassed) as all hell.
to. The second he moved a muscle the pain became overbearing. The numbness in his legs was no longer numbing. The pain now felt like several knives were being jabbed into him all at once, and he was so helpless he could do nothing but endure it.
It took all the energy out of the brunette, but he now had everything set and was ready to barge right into that adoption center and get his baby.
Steve sighed. “Listen, Stark. If you want to not be puzzled anymore, I'm open for a talk. This is the first day where all of us are gathered together and I'm really not trying to meet any potential enemies.”
They popped open their drinks and clinked them together before taking a swig. Steve absolutely
“Thank you. Yes, I do.”
He didn't know when he came to this conclusion, but there is one instance which Steve would never forget.
Or maybe not. Maybe Steve says Tony's a prick because he genuinely likes him and he's so inexperienced with longing and loving feelings that all he can do is express himself like a teenage boy.
“Can you believe that?” Tony laughed. “
"What?" Steve turned to him, eyebrow raised with confusion despite the clear sparkle in his eyes.
“For a second there, I thought you were going to propose, what with this overwhelming sap and all. Isn't this what they do for those occasions? Not this kind?” Tony chuckled when he and Steve sat beside each other on the laid out blanket.
Maybe

he wouldn't be able to talk right.
Steve thanked them silently all times, grateful for their carefulness, as he would've snapped otherwise thanks to irritation from work.
“This was our chill-out spot when we were just bros. I really like this place. Sadly, we haven't visited here in a while. I'd really like to get back to our daily trips here and have some more quality time with you. ♡ Follow the rose-petal-and-confetti trail and read the upcoming papers. - Steve x.”
Soon, Tony's advances became bolder. Although still invisible to the naked eye, Tony had offered Steve many nights out, inviting another one of the Avengers so his intentions weren't apparent. He'd say things like, "Me and Clint are going to see the game, wanna come?" or "Nat is forcing me to shop with her. Wanna suffer with me?" Casual things like that that hid so much longing.
know? “To be fair,” Steve continued, “I signed up for that experiment, but . . . It would've felt better if I wasn't looked at as a failure before I was even transformed.”
It never felt like they truly loved him, and so that just clicked into his day-to-day mind set. As if on default, he'd think nobody loved him. He never even truly believed Pepper had loved him when they were dating, even though she was there for him when the world went to hell. That was the cause to their break-up. Pepper was done with him and Tony believed she deserved better. No, Tony
"Never, Steve. Never you." He replied as solidly as he could through his slurred tongue. "I love you, and I know you love me, so why bother being toxic with something as butiful as being in a relationship with you when there are other things out there to be mopey about?"

“Yes, of course, why else would I be here if you weren't my repairman?” Tony fake-sniffed. Steve rolled his eyes. Steve loved this man a lot--of course he did, this man was his boyfriend--but my
Tony didn't have anything serious to discuss when he thought of calling Steve, he just wanted to do late night talks that weren't limited by time or distance--he wanted the warmth of Steve's voice to swirl him around and revive his soul that had since been dull. He just wanted to beg Steve back, as if it was his fault the accords appeared, as if it were his fault his boyfriend's best friend killed his parents. As if everything was his fault. He would gladly admit to it if it meant Steve would fall back to him.
Tony allowed himself to be hugged, but said, “Steve, I'm dirty as hell. You're ruining your clothes.”
Steve snorts once more, then leans forward and places a gentle peck on Tony's forehead. “Stark, you are chaotic.”
Maybe the haunting call of the sea wouldn't leave him alone probably until he died, but his nasal bridge would now be his new favorite body part, and Tony would still be the most beautiful person in Steve Rogers's world.
Tony stares at him, expression blank until he straightens his posture and shrugs again. Quick and casual. “Maybe, maybe not.”
“Steve, I-I'm serious!” Tony yelled, hoping that if he talked louder Steve would believe his lies. But there was no such luck.
Steve smiles. “You really don't know why you bought these, do you?”

“Is this why you barged into my house without even a warning text?” The jock pulled his hand from his face, instead placing it on his hip.
Steve shook his head, coming over to the billionaire and holding his bloodied face in his hands. "I
The baby bed was blue and the bars could slide up and down so it'd be easy to pick out and keep in their plus one. Steve was surprised with how prepared Tony was, and was also surprised that he agreed with all the options. They purchased every item immediately after about a thirty-second discussion before each one, and weren't disappointed when they arrived at the doorstep in such short timing.
Tony was now the one to resist. He didn't want Steve to see him so miserable like this, and as late as it is, he hoped to convince the blond to get some rest despite himself.
But still, with Tony's developing obsessiveness over Steve's possible reaction to his offer, he found the determination to continue planning his approach. Of course, he'd need Steve to trust him--build their relationship a little more, because during this time Tony and Steve weren't on the best of terms. They argued days on end like an old married couple, always catching something, whether big or small, to shout about.
Every folder Steve had pulled out during the next few minutes were boring, but finally, after some not-so-deep searching, he found something jackpot-like.
When he’s close enough, Steve throws himself to the brunette, gasping his name and hugging him tight.
When Steve caught up with him, Tony was already looking for which one to choose, nearly shedding tears with every little face he saw.
“Do you expect me to believe that?" Steve asked helplessly, staring at Tony's bruised and bloodied face with tainted determination. His voice was so soft Tony could barely hear him.
“Oh god, thank you . . . “ Tony says into his hands as he tries to hold back tears. “You're okay . . .
for Steve to get out of the car, because by then, he was already inside the shelter filling out paperwork.
Steve turned away and slapped his hands to his face, balling his eyes as he silently sobbed. No . . . Please, god,
Except for Tony Stark.
Steve looked up, face pale and mentality shaken. Tony had snacks in his arm, some ready to fall, as he said, "Hey, Steve. Brought you some snacks since you haven't been out for a few hours." He was looking down as he talked, but the second he looked up the brunette's face hardened with concern. He rushed to Steve and dropped the snacks down in a pile on the floor, kneeling before him and grabbing his hand. "What's wrong?" He asked solidly, squeezing his hand a tad.
He was at it again.
“Why?”
“Yeah, yeah. I know.” Tony nods quickly and casually, really dismissive with Steve's reminders. Steve is just fiddling with his own headband now. Honestly, Stark, what purpose does this even have? He thinks.
When they decided on one, they got him and drove back home, Tony now being the passenger as he gawked at their little one. His and Steve's little one.
“Suck my dick, Steve.”
Except--when Tony did it, it didn't come out as a question or an offer. More of a suggestion or demand.
The next morning, Steve Rogers is sipping a lemonade and Tony Stark is chugging a black coffee.
From this point, Steve didn't reply. He simply smiled as he listened to Tony ramble, humming in response to some of the things he said. God, was he adorable.
Tony smiled, his face going red as quickly as an anime girl's. He leaned in and kissed Steve briefly, whispering an “I love you too,” against his lips before pulling away.
Okay, maybe hooking up with an officer that’s on your case isn't ideal, Tony realizes as he sips nervously from a martini glass. Right now he's surrounded by friends that work under the same criminal business as him, blaring music acting as a fuel for this chaotic night. It's actually a baby shower for Natasha Romanoff, a Russian spy, and her fiancé Clint Barton, who's sort of her hawk eye when it comes to scouting policemen or any law enforcement figure. There’s also Tony's CEO and partner-in-crime Pepper Potts, a woman he once had something beautiful with, and Peter Parker, a boy who's life was turned so upside down that he accepted his fate and started to rob places as a living.

"Awwwh, look at you!" Tony leaned into Steve dramatically to show the captain pictures of him before and after the super soldier project.
It was innocent at first, he swears, but then it just . . . got a lot more intense.

unimportant things and, for the most part, he'd won many arguments about whatever the topic was at that time.
Steve’s face relaxed after the smooch, and he went back to stitching. It didn't take much longer until his slow-paced hands were finally done helping the needle and making his definite A-plus design. He lifted the jacket up all the way and showed Tony with a “Ta-dah!” and Tony really couldn't sigh any heavier than he just did.
Tony was very careful when it came to Steve Rogers.

What Steve stitched was the shape of a zipper. Right at the corner. Near the broken zipper.
i'm gonna get back into the gig though don't worry babies
It took a minute, but Tony finally arrived at the cafe and stepped inside, seeing how it was barely full. There was only two insomniac college students typing away on their computers in the corners. There was them, but no Steve. Tony's eyebrows furrowed in confusion. Didn't blondie say to meet up here? He made it up to the register and was greeted by a female brunette, who tried very effortlessly to hide the smile on her face.
“Yeah. Remember when you barged in during fourth mod and started screaming? And then you were forced out by me? When I sat down again I heard him whisper about you being an ass.”
Tony gasps awake, sweat covering his arms and face. He looks around his bedroom, breathing heavily. Everything's the same. It . . . It was just a dream. A god-awful dream. He wipes his face and rubs his temples, trying to forget  that traumatic nightmare.
He wasn't the kind of guy to go out of his way and ask anyone to give him a hand because he took his independence
Tony thanked him and the man left after a kind wave goodbye. The brunette himself sat on the fountain and started to read. “Our first kiss was here baby! I sort of died when you pulled me in so suddenly and shut me up. I still cringe thinking about how rambly I got prior to the lip lock. But anyway, your lips are really nice. You're really nice. I like you. Maybe we can be boyfriends. ;) Move on to the forest. - Steve x.”
Steve sits here now, holding Tony’s hand. “I love you so much. Do you know that?” He asks, words soft and oozing with love. “Yes,” Tony replies, just as softly. "I love you too, Steven."
Eventually he did find it, and he held it up with victory before opening it and studying the subject's pictures.
she deserved better.
The note read, “This is where we had our first date. Cliche, I know, but it was great nonetheless. Now that I look back on it, I remember how euphoric I was when you said yes to my offer. My god, you were adorable when your face turned red and couldn't speak. Move on to the center water fountain. - Steve x.”
They made eye contact, more chaotic confusion building alongside tension. “You annoy me.” Tony said finally, moving a step back from the captain.
“Well, I mean . . . Do you want me to propose to you?” Steve hummed.
Steve still has a confused smile on his face, but he nods anyway and plays with the bells himself.
“Iron Man!” A voice Tony could barely familiarize shouted. He couldn't tell if it was a villain preparing to end him or if it was a good guy preparing to help him, but when he saw the outline of that physique, strands of blond hair and streaks of red, white and blue, the hurting genius almost bolted up. Almost.
"Uh--uh, yeah. Yeah, I'll go. No biggie." He finally managed. He saw relief and victory in Steve's dazzling blue eyes as he said, "Sweet. See you then."
And when Tony Stark sacrificed himself for the whole world, Steve Rogers found something new to look forward to. He no longer had to search, no longer had to drag his feet through the rubble and find nothing.

So when Captain America said “I love you” to Iron Man himself, Tony almost lost his breath. He had laughed long and hard, hiding the panic on his face. No, no, no, he had thought, this is a joke. Captain America could
Steve gave that half smile Tony's been mesmerised by since the first time he'd seen it, even letting a chuckle pass his lips a bit.
Nothing,
Tony's cheeks flushed considerably. “All-American shameless prick of a bastard,” he muttered under his breath.
With no real hobbies aside from kicking bad-guy ass and art, Steve honestly didn't have better to do. And when he couldn't find anymore files to read, he decided to head down to where the science bros were chilling to check for anymore files there--or at least, the ones Tony would let him read.
is what Steve pictures as home.
“I don't hear you complaining.” Tony commented, smugness glinting in his eyes. He leaned in closer, as if challenging the man to do it. “You can kiss me,” Tony offered, “or you can give me your name.” A tension-rising pause. “Or you can give me both. I can't wait to talk to you endlessly from within my cell, officer. You'd be welcome anytime--”
Tony hopped off his ass and marched to the forest. The forest wasn't really a forest so much as it was just a couple trees that were deep enough to barely be considered one.
not my best chapter thanks to the lack of inspiration, but I've done worse (surprisingly)

“An accident?” Bruce laughed, almost dryly, stepping deeper into the lab. “You're telling me kissing Tony Stark at such an angle it looked like a cheesy scene like the ones in rom-coms was an

." He murmured calmly.
But every time he saw his reflection on the phone screen and Steve's number just sitting there--he couldn't do it. He couldn't see himself or Steve's number and have the confidence to make a call. He couldn't see the damage done and he didn't have strength to make it better.

It went silent between them for a moment before Tony finally added, “Sometimes I wonder why you, the god of the school, chose me, a speck of dust--you know? Like . . . You asked me to homecoming so suddenly last year and now . . . Here we are. I'm still trying to wrap my head around it.”
And when the date day arrived, both men out-did themselves. They dressed casually but fancy, trying to be as pleasing to the other as possible. They had went out to eat and played arcade games, even rushing to an amusement park to just have a blast with each other.
Stars ‘n’ Stripes.
Steve hung to every word, keeping his mouth shut as he let Tony ramble. Steve was never a son to Howard. Sure, Howard said “you're like a son to me” a couple times, but he wasn't blood like Tony was. He could only imagine how lonely and hurtful it must've been to have your father call someone else their son and hold them closer than they ever have with their own blood.
Tony pulled his hand back and nodded, letting silence take the lead. How nice of him, making things awkward between himself and his companion so quickly.
Tony was breathing heavily, on the verge of crying. Helping him was useless. All it would do is give him more pain.
It was so real. So vivid. But then Tony Stark walked in, and everything silenced.
“Well, yeah, I mean . . . You're--you're brilliant, and talented, and can last for
Tony had been studying him ever since freshman year, watching from afar every movement the pretty boy made. The way he'd smile or the way his jaw clenched was all vivid in Tony's ripe memory, being replayed over and over again as if there was something that was hidden behind every twitch of skin that needed to be unfolded and glorified. But it just so happened that the harder Tony tried, the more mysterious Steve became.
So when Captain America came aboard the Avengers team that damned fateful day, instantly being greeted with smiles from the whole team, the cocky billionaire held his breath and tried processing everything.
But Steve is drunk, and that's that.
Everyone said their chemistry was so thick not even Natasha could quote-unquote “slice that bitch.” It was a hilarious phrase when spoken by J.A.R.V.I.S., but it made Tony have an actual crisis on how far gone he and Cap really were with each other.
Tony covered his mouth, breathing in dramatically. Then, wheezing silently, he said, “He’s so fucking precious I think I might die.”
Steve popped his mouth and lazily walked back over to the door, placing his hand on the knob. With a little groan, he said, "I'll go get the sewing kit from mom's room."
Tony gasped as he turned around, immediately delighted to see who it was. "Steve!"

“You're Tony Stark.” He said.
deserved the saving.
"Doin' what again?" Tony rose a brow, opening up the file in his hands and continuing to read what he could make out.
“Quit being a sap. I know that.” Tony shook his head, his grin growing then quickly fading. Steve huffed a laugh but said nothing more.
- please accept this trash
“You okay?” Bruce asked the brunette, arms crossing with hidden amusement.
He had slid into the same booth as that eye-catching man and did as much of a suggestive pose as he could, but, instead of being greeted with a smirk back and some flirty comment, he got a surprised, shaken stare, as if the man was seeing ghosts.
When Clint and Cap are on the main living floor, Thor and Bruce are shoving each other while playing video games, Natasha is there watching them, and Tony is standing at the island counter in the open kitchen.
He was just about to lull back into unconsciousness, but just then he heard a scream. It was close, and Tony's instincts were spiked so quickly that he sat up--or at least,
“Tony, you've had at least thirteen martinis by now. Is everything okay?” Tony looks up from the ground to see Pepper standing beside him, eyebrow perked with worry on her pretty face.
"Aye-aye, Captun!"
Tony nearly chokes on his coffee from the question, putting his own cup down in a panic. He wipes his mouth and slowly swallows the beverage, clearing his throat to stall on his answer.
His words are slurred and his mind is gone from his head, but Clint can hear him loud and clear, and so can the super soldier himself.
The itch in the back of his neck disappeared, and Tony almost breathed out in relief.
Now that Steve thinks about it, that's probably why Tony never touched those drawers in the first place.
Suddenly, there's a knock on his door, and Tony gets up to see who it is, wiping his arms and face into his tank top to rid of the anxious sweat.
Every night when Tony was drowsy from restless naps in his lab, he'd trudge all the way up the bedroom floor and into Steve's pristinely chaotic room, right to his bed and then right next to him under the sheets.
You might be guessing what Steve's "home" is. Is the tower he lives in home? On a literal standpoint, yes, but in Steve's head? No. Is his bedroom filled with vintage souvenirs and a cozy bed his home? Though Steve reflects on the life he should've had and his room is the provider for those memories, no, that place isn't home either.
"Excuse me?" I'm sorry, but have you seen yourself? Tony thought. You say I'm a mystery? I'm an open fucking book unlike you!
In that second, as he looked back and forth between Tony and the vintage picture of him, Steve frantically asked himself,
"Rrr . . . Research! Please don't wurry." Tony slurred helplessly, his grip on Steve's forearm falling as the captain stepped closer to the growing pile of files a foot away. The blond picked one up and quickly scanned through the contents, looking at Stark the second he finished. "You're doing it again."
He jumped over fences, fallen trash cans, even a few car hoods, but every time he looked back he still saw that cop just a few feet behind him. He used crowds as his disguise, hunching over and running in that position as to not be seen. He then took a sharp turn into an alley, trying to keep his breathing shallow despite the burning of his lungs and the soreness of his throat.
"You, Stark, are the biggest mystery I've ever encountered." He said smoothly, looking back up at the brunette with internal panic and longing.
"Uh . . . Can I help you?" Tony asked, feeling the back of his neck become hot with awkwardness.
The babe gave a little bark, then opened his eyes and looked up at the couple. His tail wagged and his mouth opened, and Tony was about to faint from happiness as he reached a hand out and pet the babe's head.
On the night he asked Steve on a date, they were alone walking down the Manhattan sidewalks, peeking through windows of vintage shops and occasionally stopping at a food place for a quick munch. Tony hadn't invited anyone else other than Steve this time. If he was going to ask, he didn't need the surprised gasping of one of the guys in his ear. Doing what he was going to do would be unnerving enough, and to have reactions from an audience that didn't need to hear it weren't going to simmer his tension.
The day before prom, Tony was opening his locker, taking his stuff and shoving them into his bag quickly so he could see Steve before he walked home with Bucky. As he closed his locker, he was frightened of the sight of Steve right next to him, leaned against the neighboring locker and studying him carefully.
Tony rolled his eyes as he grinned at the open space surrounding him. His boyfriend asking to be his boyfriend. What is this? Their wedding anniversary?
oh and pre-relationship

“Aaaand it's the start of May, you know that, right?”
“Of course I do.” Tony put the headband he was previously holding down, leaning against the counter and resting his chin on his palm.
Steve silently thanked him every morning as he took a sip, feeling refreshed with the spoonful of creamer, dash of sugar, and sprinkle of affection all mixed into one special mug.
After recovering from the upsetting shout, the blond got out of his seat and tugged Tony into his room, shutting his door quick before his mom could appear out of nowhere and lecture them about bad language. He sat Tony down on his bed then pinched his nasal bridge, sighing heavily as the brunette looked at his jacket with anger and sadness.
Okay, listen, he was out that night, looking to get drunk with Rhodey and have an overall good time, but then something--some
“Uh--haha,” Tony sat up completely now. “No, I think you're mistaking me for--”
Finally, when Steve leveled eyes with Tony, he kissed his lips, chapped and bitten and yet still holding that perfection Steve had been missing. Tony didn't complain, he just avoided touching Steve as to not cover him in grease, but honestly the great Captain America couldn't care less.
“How can you say all that after how you’ve seen him treat Pepper? He’s been the best he’s ever been these past few weeks. He’s cooperative with the team, nonviolent, sleeping, eating, smiling. If this isn’t who he’s meant to be, then you go right ahead down there and tell him whatever you think is going on. Just go.” Nat is still, preternaturally so, before she starts to move back, eyes still wary on Steve.
It’s the right time. There will never be a better place and feeling than this, Steve thinks as he descends on Tony, Alpha teeth snicked out and waiting to strike. And strike he does, sinking into Tony’s neck, puncturing the delicious gland underneath. The scent of Tony abruptly changes, morphing into a medley of Steve and Tony. Unique, mesmerizing. Tony moans long and low, helpless. The connection tears through him with violence, like feathers beating at his brain, he feels Tony all over. The fear, the pleasure, his despair, and underneath it all, a dark and twisted desire for Steve that is pressing at the membrane of Tony’s self-control.
“Oh god, Steve!”
Tony easily dodges the rest of the Avengers as they all go to make ready.
!” In his dreams, Steve worships Tony just like this, like Tony is
Steve hitches his hips up to try and follow Tony’s body as it tugs at him. It hurts, just that little bit, and he can’t imagine how it must feel to Tony, how upset he must be to try and get away. But he can’t allow Tony to hurt himself, so he gropes at Tony’s shoulders and presses his hips down to pin Tony.
Steve surges forward and kisses Tony roughly, mouthing at his lips, then chin, and throat. He moves down in a wave, taking first one nipple, then the other into his mouth and plucking at them with his wet lips. Tony never said he couldn’t do it through the shirt, so he hopes he’s not crossing a line.
“I suppose that’s all I can ask for. Next is that when we’re done with the heat, I won’t want you again. This is it. One heat and we won’t share anything else again.” Steve’s heart, that he didn’t know belonged to Tony now, breaks. This is all he’ll get with Tony. One chance to be his partner and take care of him. There are no more chances after this. He’s irrevocably ruined any possibility that they’ll be together.
Exhausted from running, fighting, and generally being fraught, Tony doesn’t quite realize they’ve made it to his bed until Steve gently rests him on it. He gazes up at the two alphas, their faces inscrutable as they examine Tony. It makes him squirm, and he pushes himself up closer to his pillows, full well knowing that he can’t run, and there’s nowhere to hide.
“No I suppose it doesn’t. The Chitauri are coming. Nothing will change that. What have I to fear?” The other man is staring out the window now, and he looks small in his elaborate robes. He wears his wealth and class like armor against the world. Thor hadn’t mentioned what Loki had against his family, but Tony knows Daddy issues when he sees them. Loki is much like himself, if Tony had decided to be a wreck of a human being. The truth of that stretches between them like a chasm, and Tony sees a dark reflection on the other side.
“Ah, well. You picked a hell of an omega to lay hands on. Oh don’t give me that look, it really is the right word. Mr. Stark is well connected within the community. He’s admired by many. Sorry, I’m not helping much, am I? The way you come back. Well, you have to apologize. And you have to mean it. Understand what you did wrong, and tell him you’re sorry. That’s all you can do. It’s up to him if he wants to forgive you. You can’t ask him to forgive you. What you need to do is forgive yourself. And doing that is a journey that starts with figuring out why you did what you did, and what you need in order to not do it again. Do you understand, son?”
“You don’t know anything about omegas, do you? Not a thing.” At that, Tony gets up and stands there, waiting for dismissal. Steve sighs and nods, and Tony retreats to his workshop.
“Steve, please, I don’t need that much.”
Oh god, he has to choose. He can’t. He
“With the suit separate from Tony Stark, you’re looking at a military who thinks Iron Man is nothing more than property. Property that needs strict regulation.” And wasn’t that just the truth. By disavowing that he was Iron Man, publicly, his position was more tenuous. It irked to be reminded of that by an intelligence agency of all things.
, Steve.”
“If I had known you wanted me– I would have,” Tony pauses, his face twisting. “I would have let you have me.”
“Excuse me but I don’t share. I don’t need to,” Tony says.
Steve doesn’t want to go anymore. He wants to stay here and guard Tony. It’s only now that he’s seeing how dangerous this might be. Someone might try to claim Tony for his heat. Someone who isn’t Steve.
Tony is plastered to the floor, his jeans tucked down to the curve of his knees, underwear mangled in the waistline. One palm is smashed to the floor to prop him up, and his other hand occupied with his ass, the jerky motion of his wrist pushing what must be his fingers deep inside his hole. Tony’s face is a rictus of ecstasy, his neck thrown back, careless in repose.
“Thank you.”
“Fuck you Rogers. Give me that last pill, now.” Bucky reaches over the counter and holds out his hand. Steve crosses his arms.
“Well, he’s one of the foremost proponents of omega rights! Of course, he puts his money where his mouth is.”
He feels this uplifted all the way to SHIELD, through his shower, and the moments before he goes to seek Natasha and Clint out. He’s going to use this opportunity to apologize to everyone who he’s inadvertently hurt with his behavior.
It was possible that it was only an omega thing, but Tony detested colognes and perfumes. And for as much as he hated them, he always had to show up to these gigs and endure it. He liked to scent people naturally, and all these artificial means and methods of hiding or accentuating scent caused his natural responses to go haywire. He didn't know how anyone dealt with it.
Equally?
“Fuck you.” Tony says as he tries to push back up against Steve again, only managing to wedge his hips into the curve of Steve’s sharply defined groin. The burgeoning hardness that rests between his ass cheeks makes his efforts feel futile, and if that didn’t make him slick up even more.
This ‘Ty’ would look good out cold on the floor.
And all of this, all of what’s happening, is like a filthy dream come true.
They’ll find him. They have to. This fight isn’t over.
Bucky swoops around him and pours himself some coffee. He’s wearing a thin t-shirt and low-slung sweatpants, which Tony tries not to notice, but with the curve of Bucky’s hip bones pressed free from their confines, he can’t help himself. Bucky is right behind him, coffee in hand, when he puts a hand on Tony’s shoulder.
“I always keep my promises Steve. You’ll be my little slut forever. I’ll never let you go. Someday you’ll come to me, and you’ll be completely mine. I’d say I can’t wait, but my patience for you has remained rather impressive. My finest project yet.” Tony pets over his back, fingers dipping around Steve’s muscles. Steve feels hollowed out, like he’s broken all his promises, though he’s only halfway to hell. It doesn’t matter, though. He was gone the first time Tony claimed his lips and told him to bend, just a little.
As for Fury, Steve has no intention ever of making Tony produce anything he doesn’t want to. Despite what this may look like from the outside, Steve truly has Tony’s best interests at heart.
And the wolf
What’s he supposed to say?
They get into the car, and Natasha sits there for a moment, not turning the key in the ignition.
“I was twenty-nine when he told me that it was time to settle down and have a child. That my job was expendable. Thing is, I was making almost $25,000 more a year than he was. I never realized how much this bothered him until he said that what I did wasn’t that important. Nothing was more important than raising our family.”
He shouldn’t think of Tony in that way, but there’s something about the defiance he exhibits that while agitating his beliefs, it gets under his skin in another way. He has to admit to himself that he wants Tony. It’s hard for him to do that, because when he opens that door, that makes his duty all the harder. How can he enforce necessary rules if he’s busy wanting Tony to like him?
“So, what brings you to Delta-5? The stunning cuisine and entertainment?” This place is a shit hole, as is every unregulated hole-in-the-wall waystation they’ve stopped at. Being in Kree space means they need to stay off the radar and out of slaver’s hands. At least here there’s some amount of rules that keep places like this flowing. Kidnapped clientele is just bad for business. Those whose business, Tony doesn’t exactly know or care to find out. He’s just glad he doesn’t have to worry so much.
Steve, the wing wrangler, grabbed right where Tony’s ulna was and smoothed the wings down to the primaries, cinching them back up onto Tony’s back.
“I want you to look me in the eyes as I knot you, ok love?”
“Capsicle,” he replies, leaning over the side door and giving his best impression of a carefree billionaire who’d much rather be somewhere else, but is in the mood to be indulgent, if only for a moment.
“Tony, I just want to say thank you for having us at the tower and maybe— maybe clear the air between us?” Rogers looks so earnest that Tony imagines for a moment that he means it. That it’s not just a tactic to get everyone working together smoothly. Thing is, he’s willing to play the part. Especially just to have Rogers look at him with something that isn’t disdain for a moment before Tony ruins things, like he always does.
“Tony? The contractors are working as fast as they can—”
“Son, he’s already the kind of omega that people, and other omegas, look up to. That’s not a battle you’ll be able to fight with him.”
“Yeah, you’re right, but old habits die hard.” He can feel his skin heat and he tastes shame like a hot fragment of metal on his tongue. He swallows, the action loud in the quiet of the room.
“Oh? You want to get between a cat and his hunt? Brave wolf. Let’s skip the pleasantries and get to the part where you hand me my letter from Steve.”
“Would you like a bath sweetheart?” They’re both filthy by this point, and Steve thinks it’s time to rinse off the numerous bodily fluids that coat their bodies.
“There’s a few more rules. And I wanted to remind you of rule one.” Tony pulls his jacket off and lays it on his bed. He untucks his shirt and throws it down next to the jacket. Steve watches him with hooded eyes.
“Yes, Rogers. Ok, Rogers. I’ll get right on that, Rogers.” His tone drops into a lower register every time he says Steve’s name.
“Don’t ruin this for Tony,” Steve says, with an edge of desperation. Tony stays still and silent throughout the exchange, terrified that the two alphas will attack each other. He wishes Bucky would stop antagonizing Steve, and shamefully, he wishes Steve would
“A proper omega? Tony Stark is one of the smartest men alive, omega or not, and he fulfills our contracts for SHIELD’s technology. Contracts that should be being fulfilled as we speak. Instead, I’m here, cleaning up your fucking mess. Forget this. You’re coming in for reeducation. This won’t stand. Not with me, not with your team. I’d say that I won’t tell them about this, but they’ll find out anyway. I don’t want to be there when they do.” Steve’s gut is lead, and he thinks he may have done something horrible. He doesn’t know what a false heat is, but stress-induced heat is a more obvious namesake. He was just trying to do the right thing, and he doesn’t know how or why it hasn’t worked, but it hasn’t. He knows that. He just thought he had more time to figure out a different solution or otherwise convince Tony that what they were working on is important. Tony is simply being stubborn about learning.
“When my decryption finishes, we’ll know!” Tony claps his hands delightedly before striding back over to Bruce.
“Now the rest of it, Tony. I need you ready for me. Will you be a good boy and do that, for me?” Giving up his dreams wasn’t so awful, a small part of himself reasoned. Steve’s dreams were big enough. His alpha would be strong.
“Sir, are you sure?”
“Come on, punk, let’s talk over it in my room.” Bucky adjusts his hand so it lays on Steve’s shoulder, pulling him closer. Tilting his head as Steve pauses, Bucky squeezes just the barest amount, reminding Steve to speak up.
. Sunshine means the sun, means bright light, means getting out of bed. Tony
“It’s pretty soft,” Steve says.
“Does he want his blankets now?” The AI pauses for a moment, before responding.
“You’ll see. Follow me, Rogers.”
“I’m Tracy. I was a betrothal baby. They grandfathered us in, you know. My alpha was much older than I am. Something like twenty years? I was given to him when I was sixteen, the age of omega consent in my state. Maybe someone else would have been fine with it. Sometimes I think I just complained too much about things.” Angela puts a hand on Tracy’s arm as if to say that what she said isn’t true.
Still, Tony is learning, so he says nothing.
“Ah, I remember you do everything yourself, except for pilot the Iron Man suit. How’s that working out for you?” As Fury side-stepped Tony’s interrogation with his bold declaration, Tony knew the other man knew his identity and maybe that he was dying. Fury knew, Tony knew he knew, and Fury knew that Tony knew that he knew. If he weren’t so tired, he’d be furious. As it is, he’s reflexively defensive.
“Just some of the good scotch, JARVIS. I’m not a hobo.” Would his— this alpha, distract him from drinking? He glanced at Rhodey, taking a sip of his drink. The other man grinned at him and Tony thought about what it would look like to replace the person in the chair with his alpha. His, and only his. With eyes for him and the whole nine yards. It could have been the scotch, but he felt warmed, hopeful.
for Steve with a yearning that Tony feels in his heart, the primary feathers pointing towards the other man in a frankly rude demonstration. This was just terrible, because of all the things he’s never wanted to do, it’s to put his feelings before Steve’s. If Steve knew, he’d be so uncomfortable, Tony knew.
“Seems like they’re tied to your emotional state.”
Those words run through him like refrigerant in his veins. He’s always said that Tony was cherished. That Tony needed minding. But instead, he’s thinking of himself as Alex and he’s revolted. Alex said he loved his omega, but he so easily gave her up when she became inconvenient. And there was no protection for her to ensure that didn’t happen.
“None whatsoever. I’m as shameless as a newborn.” Tony is grinning at him, a dare, and a challenge to Steve’s authority all at once.
A little cognitive dissonance or willful ignorance of the facts when he was young? Sure. Six of one, half dozen of the other.
. He’s shiny and clean, and all the things in this world that people strive to be and to have in their life.
Come leaks out the sides of Tony’s mouth, and there’s a savage look that’s starting to simmer in Tony’s face. When Steve pulls out, Tony half-heartedly spits out a wad, letting it trail down his chin.
“As if I’d leave you to your own devices, Rogers.”
, he feels a swelling inside of him. It’s so good, tight in his channel and pressing into him deeply.
“Selling parts.” Andorians are also short and sweet speakers, never adding anything unnecessary. Did Tony mention he loves Andorians? They’re mostly human-looking, except for the fact that they’re blue with white hair and have two antennae that peek out from the top of their bangs. Tony has long since gotten over insignificant differences such as the color of someone’s skin or whatever weird things they have on their face. Not to mention the variety of dick and vagina he’s seen. It’s enough for a lifetime and has quite possibly made his sexuality broader than any one human has ever been before.
At the terminal, he asks whether they had been having a moment.
Steve anticipated this too. When you can’t fight, you give up sensation. That which any partner wants to see.
“If she were alive, I’d tell her that this ass is mine. Your body is mine, and that I use it however I want. Whenever I want. I’d want her to know how debased you are, how humiliating your fall.” Tony’s voice is casual, as thought he’s talking about the weather, but Steve can feel the bite of possession underlying it. Tony is not as distant as he makes himself seem. Steve knows he has a part of Tony as well. It’s in the way he’s tender after. The way he always lets Steve go. The way he gives Steve a choice.
“You don’t even like me.” Tony gives him a look then, his face as hard as a clenched fist.
Steve knows that as he’s on his way to meet with Natasha and Clint, that he’s trading Tony’s disdain for theirs.
“Steve,” Tony spits back.
The scene in front of him is one he isn’t sure he could live without seeing again some time, in better circumstances.
“Tony.” Just one word, and he glances up at Steve before he examines the rest of the Avengers. They’re acting like they’re not paying attention, but Tony swears this is their weekly entertainment.
“Well, if you say so. It’s—it’s my omega. We haven’t got on very well for most of the time we’ve been married. It’s always to do with that, isn’t it? I’ve been—I’ve been awful to him. And I know that. We shared his heat though, recently, because I did say yes to him, like you suggested. But now he wants nothing to do with me, and I know that he’s not wrong in the sense that I’ve been cruel to him. It’s just, now I want him. I want him so badly I can’t even think straight. I think I’m in love with him.”
He vows to ensure those things as he heads home.
“Shh, you want this, I can see it.” Fuck. He does. He didn’t exactly realize it until now, but all he’s been doing is dancing around the attraction he has for Bucky, and for Steve. And what about Steve? This is madness, as fierce as hunger and fever bright.
“That’s right. You have never cared about them. But they’re not that foolish. Eventually, SHIELD will come for you. The rest of the Avengers will, especially if I tell them what you’ve been up to and why. Then where will you be? You want to have all the money in the world? Then own the world, that’s Godhood. Right now you’re just a minor deity, and there’s the little fact that if you don’t fall in line and SHIELD doesn’t get to you, I will.” The threat and promise rolls off his tongue lovingly. If you make the carrot appealing enough, you never have to use the stick.
“Iron Man.”
“Yeah, right. Well, dinner is done. So you can go now, thanks, and goodbye.” Tony gets up and goes directly back to what he was working on. It’s cold of Tony, but it’s nothing less than he expects. It will not get him down though. He’s riding a high, a victory.
“Today we’re going on a little field trip. I’ll be driving.” Natasha gets up from her seat and walks towards the door. Steve also stands, feeling a little out of sorts with leaving the room.
Finally the swelling allays enough to slip out, and Steve feels his cum leak out onto his belly. Tony sighs with relief and rolls off of Steve, falling to Steve’s side in a huff.
Steve exhaled and walked away from the infuriating mutant. “We just need to figure out who sent this shit. That, and I want someone always with Tony. One of us, no exceptions.”
ved'ma- witch
Tony quirks an eyebrow. Beta-Alpha relationships aren’t unheard of, but they’re definitely less common, only having been legal for the past decade or so. “Tell me about it.” He agrees lowly, picking at a loose thread of his jeans.
“I don’t mind.” Steve blurts, reddening at the surprised look Tony gives him. “What I mean is…” Steve trails off.
I HAVENT EATEN IN LIKE 3 YEARS AND IM DYING BYE.
Tony nods, “I definitely get that. There’s a lot of days where I wish people would just forget my last name, my secondary gender, and just see
“Oh. –was prab’ly not s-posed to tell you that. Forget that, m’kay?” Tony says with an amused smile gracing his face. “I gu’s I should go t’sleep now.”
Tony blushed. “That’s… that’s actually a possibility.” He sighed. “That’s so lame, though! I could’ve at least been knocked out by like a toaster or anything slightly less humiliating.”
“Sorry, Cap, I didn’t see yo-“ Tony stopped talking once he realized that the person he ran into was not Steve.
Back in the 1940’s, this would’ve been completely normal for Steve, PTSD and nightmares weren’t strangers to him and the other soldiers in his regiment. In any other circumstance, Steve would’ve brushed it off and gone back to bed. But this time was different. He recognized that scream.
Tony gave him a slanted smile and shook his head. “You’re the only one.”
A new voice rang out, one that was actually familiar to Tony, “Yes, that would be me, Loki, frost-giant monster, betrayer of worlds, malevolent thief, etcetera, etcetera.” He said sarcastically. “Can’t say I like being back on this dreadful planet, but I can’t complain about seeing you, Anthony.” He said, making Tony shiver.
Kid. Kid. Kid.
, Jay?”
Then it sinks in.
******
Each of the Avengers went to bed almost immediately after.
Tony closes his eyes briefly, trying to relish in the protective, supportive hold of the alpha in front of him.
Steve leaned against the counter with Tony. “Like what?”
Steve Rogers.
The next day, the entire team ambushed Tony when he thought they had all gone to bed. He was on his way to the elevator, no doubt trying to make a mad dash to the workshop.
Peter stopped laughing. “Are you- No… you’re a fucking- Oh my god!” Peter burst out into uncontrollable laughter. “You’re a virgin?!” Peter was on the ground laughing.
Hulk’s eyes softened as much as they possibly could. “Little one hurt?”
Tony’s eyes narrow, “I’m not some kept omega, Cap, even if you were my alpha, I wouldn’t just roll over for yo-“
The group of superheroes stared at him for a moment before Bruce stepped forward, and soothingly asked, “What do you remember, Tony?”
“Doubtful.” Peter says, putting his head back down on the table.
The elevator door opens and Tony suddenly realizes he never even punched in a floor number. “Oh no, what floor is this?” He asks, stepping out alongside Steve.
“It is.” Fury agrees, not bothering to look at anyone other than Tony, “I don’t trust anyone else with the job.” He says and even though Tony was never planning on saying no, that definitely feels good to hear. As an omega in the weapons industry he’s heard a lot about being too emotional, too weak, and too
Pls comment & kudos!! I love hearing from y'all <3
“There are agents posted throughout the entire building, it doesn’t matter if Tony doesn’t know about them. If hey hear, see, or even just have a bad feeling about anything, they’ll be up here within a minute.” Clint pointed out.
He’ll find a way to protect himself
Phil Coulson, who had been called in not 10 minutes ago, walked into the room. “Logan’s right, whatever he has done this time is of no consequence. What is important is that someone is after you, Tony.”
scent.
Steve sighs as the Tony shuts off the video just as the avengers had burst through the door. He looks disappointed. “Not really much help, but…”
“My…. Howar-“
Tony sits back in his chair, glaring at the screens in front of him as though it’s technology’s fault for showing him this information.
Tony rolled his eyes at Bruce’s paternal instincts, “Okay, okay. Any other rules you want to add, commander?”
The unknown man grinned malevolently. “For you, yes.” He said, grasping the stolen scepter in his hand, and firing it at the now quivering demigod.
It wasn’t until he felt someone’s hand on his shoulder that he realized he was staring at nothing but a wall. He jumped slightly. The person behind him was suddenly in front of him, and once more, Tony was face-to-chest with Steve Rogers. “Tony, Tony, are you alright?” His voice was muffled, almost like Tony was underwater.
He could hear Logan behind him, Natasha probably following (but she was always silent, so hearing her footsteps was difficult). After what was probably the longest run of Steve’s life, they made it into the tower, which seemed to not have too much damage.
Tony stares at Peter for a moment, dumbfounded, before stammering, “What? Ownership? You’re one hundred percent off on that one, Petey.”
“I mean- like- he’s so hot Petey! And he just thinks I’m a fuck- sorry- freaking kid like everyone else and he’s also a big freaking jerk who needs to mind his own business! They ALL need to mind their own business!” Tony screeches, leaning heavily against the slightly drunk bartender.
“Oh, and you are…what? The guy who provides him with booze when he’s lonely?” Steve retorts cruelly.
Tony sat himself down beside Bruce, reaching for his already filled coffee cup.
“Ant, come on- I mean, you aren’t actually thinking about that, right?” Peter said with another funny look on his face.
. Part of Tony wonders if he’s seeing things as he tears the contracts apart, letter by letter. He pulls out each oddly mannered word, inspects the on-and-off capitalization and fumbles between the strange shifts between languages.
Tony looks at the man with a confused gaze, “Um yeah, hi, Tony Stark.” He says awkwardly, giving the older man his hand. “Do I know you?”
“Nobody will ever love you.”
Blood Pressure.
Tony exhaled and walked down the hallway quickly. He kicked Steve not so lightly with his foot until Steve opened his eyes. Suddenly, before Tony could register, Steve jumped up quickly, wide awake, “Shit! I fell asleep didn’t I? I’m sorry- Wait Tony? Tony! I-“
“Check out his leg, Captain.” Fury implores, and at first Steve doesn’t notice a thing out of the ordinary. It isn’t until he really focuses that he can see the leg bouncing up and down at what looks to be the speed of light. Even Steve’s enhanced sight can barely see the leg moving fractionally.
“I just don’t understand why you’re here and not out there. I’m perfectly fine, aren’t I?” Tony questioned, watching the screen intently. When he didn’t get an answer he looked over to see Clint-
“Why are you drinking coffee at three in the morning?” Bruce asked, leaning against the opposing counter.
And that sounds all too familiar to Steve. “Maybe he just needs space… it hasn’t been that long since their death. Maybe time is what he needs.” Steve’s trying to sound comforting, but something makes him feel like he’s trying to convince
The boy looks at him with furrowed eyebrows, faced scrunched in confusion before he smooths it out unconvincingly. He laughs along with Tony, “Right.”
. All of Tony’s life, he’s been told he’s short, even by omega standards, but he’s never felt shorter than he does right now. The top of his head is just brushing the alpha’s jaw, their proximity giving away just how huge their height difference is.
Tony’s jaw is clenched and his eyes are red rimmed as he reads page after page of unaccounted for weapons that the US military never received. Of contracts and papers signed by his own father for the illegal shipment of Stark weapons to go to random bases throughout Russia. He has JARVIS pull up satellite maps and corresponding intelligence for those particular areas. The bases either didn’t exist at all or hadn’t been out of commission for decades.
They seemed to have worked through their issues by now though because they’re already tossing insults and bantering between themselves like they’ve been friends for years. It’s nice, Tony decides, to see this side of Steve first. Tony has a feeling if he met the straight-laced Captain America version first they might not have gotten along that well either.
He doesn’t look up to see Steve’s distrustful look but he can feel it burning into the top of his head, he looks to Clint instead.
*****
“You went against a
Tony raises an eyebrow and quirks a smile, “So forward of you, Mr. Parker.”
Steve growls, “How do you know he’s going to come after Tony?
Hulk released the frost-giant into Logan’s capable hands and lumbered over to Steve’s side, dropping heavily near Tony.
Tony was here to meet with all of the avengers, but he’s known Clint and Nat for a while and although meeting Dr. Banner and a demigod sounded exciting in their own ways, Tony has always had a soft spot for Captain America.
Obadiah stands, taking Tony’s hand to shake with a pleased smile on his face. “Thank you, Tony, for considering. You’ve really done wonders here at SI, even better than Howard, I’d say."
He’s not alive.
“Injured, yes.” Doctor Lawson intervened this time. He gently picked up Tony’s arm, pointing to a deep purple bruise winding around the circumference of his arm, right below the elbow. Tony’s eyes widened at the bruise, blood dripping down one side of it. He recognized that it was right in the area that the gauntlet had clasped around his arm, and made a mental note to loosen the bolts and enlarge the size.
*****
Tony searched for words, his mind completely blank out of terror. Coulson didn’t want Tony near this guy, therefore Tony shouldn’t be near this guy. “Um, well, it’s definitely, err, wonderful!” Tony said, nervously laughing.
Rumlow smiles down at him, moving in as close as he can possibly go before actually touching Tony. The smile is all teeth, more of a threat than anything else. “Of course he did. There’s no other reason you came by? Seeing anyone special?” He asks in his usual patronizing manner. Rumlow has always been one of those alphas that treats omegas as if they’d never gotten past the second grade.
Tony blushed even harder and scratched the back of his neck. “Logan’s a really good guy, Steve. He’s just had a lot of dumb… stupid stuff happen to him.”
“Thank you for clearing that up Captain obvious.” Logan retorted, an easy glare settled on his face. “Now, I think it’s high time we get our asses, or somebody’s ass back to New York. You know, the place were Tony is. You know Tony, the guy who that fucking thing is threatening?” Logan ground out.
“I’m sorry, I’m sorry, it’s just—” Tony giggles as he stumbles over the couch and inevitably falls into it, laying back in a lewd position. Steve averts his eyes. “The beard. It gets me every time.”
(Hulk duty was kind of terrifying)
“This is all your fucking fault.” Rhodey paces, furiously pivoting every now and then. “Why the hell did you think that it was okay to go into his past like that? What the fuck!?” He vented, absolutely livid.
He taken away from his thoughts by JARVIS letting him know that Agent Coulson is requesting entry.
ALSO. I’ve never posted on AO3 before (I’ve always been on fanfiction.net) so I’m not really sure how the whole rating thing goes. There’s some rough language throughout this chapter and I put that as teen+ (because I’m fourteen and I’ve been hearing that word since I was like 7, so I thought that would be a fair rating) but if y’all think that I should up the rating to Mature, let me know. The rating may change further into the story ((smut))
are. Especially now that we need to track down this son of a bitch who’s after Tones.”
Clint makes a face. “Well, at least it’s something. Whoever this is has some connection to Howard.” The two packmates share an undefinable look. “That narrows down the search some.” He claps a hand on Tony’s shoulder encouragingly. “Good job, Tones.”
Steve glared over his shoulder.
“W-What, dad?” Tony stuttered, looked at Howard with big eyes. “What’s happe-“ Tony was cut off when a large hand connected with his cheek. Tony’s tiny body swung with the slap, ending him on his side, one hand clapped over his bruised cheek. “Da-“ Tony gasped for air as a booted foot was swung into his ribcage.
without Shield agents or one of us. Not until we find out who’s targeting you, understood?”
Tony clenched his jaw and gritted, “You’re… Steve you’re aroused.”
know what I’m saying, Steve, stop treating me like I’m some traumatized omega. I came to you because I trusted you and I thought you would take me seriously. Clearly I was wrong.” Tony snaps, stomping towards the elevator.
“You see how the boy holds them together? He’s their anchor.” The man smirked maliciously.
. Jesus, it’s only been two years how is he back—”
“Pet?” Tony threw out interrupting the bigger man.
******
“I have the video evidence if you need proof, Sir.” JARVIS snarks back and Tony resists the urge to flip off the ceiling.
“Super speed.” He notes, “Maybe that explains how he got away so fast the day of the attack.”
just how evil Howard Stark turned out to be. “I’m not just
It falls flat though, because Steve is staring at him like
Tony decided that it was okay for Peter and he to fight about some things. And Peter was apologizing this time
“…I can’t” Tony muttered.
“You- um you-“
Height: 5 feet, 9 inches
Tony watched as the man grabbed the clutch and a switchblade out from his pocket, basically ripping the clutch apart until he found it. The flash drive, cracked into three pieces. He gave them a smug grin. “Looks like we won’t have to drag it out any longer after all. Have fun, boys.” The man says, walking away, the remnants of the flash drive and the clutch in his hands.
“Thank you, Phi-“
“Tony.” He says in this distraught and empty voice that makes Tony want to rip his hair out despite the already pounding headache he has. Because this is exactly what he wanted to avoid by not telling the team about his past. He hated the pity. He had gotten through it all alone, right? He didn’t have a superhero around then and he survived. He didn’t need one then and he certainly didn’t need one now.
And with that he walked away from them, disappointment pungent in the air.
Natasha’s eyes flickered so quickly Steve nearly missed it. But he caught the emotion. Fear.
Also (x2) I have an awful crick in my neck and I can’t turn my head to the right so that’s a bitch. ANNNND I went to the doctor today (he was so effing hot) and he did absolutely nothing to help me- so cool. Anyway, comment and kudos and favorite my lovlies! The more comments the quicker the next chapter will be up (never this long again I promise)
Clint was over the computer in seconds, placing a card onto the computer’s attached scanner. An ID popped up, one that read, Cad. James Rhodes, with a picture of Tony’s best friend underneath. Suddenly the screen changed again
The Avengers each looked away guiltily. Bruce sighed and spoke up, “You may not be our favorite person, but Tony doesn’t exactly come across friends too often.”
“Thanks.” He said pleasantly, smiling at the room’s occupants genuinely, “It was cool meeting you guys, see y’all at home, yeah?” And with that, he waved at them and walked out.
after you. It is inevitable.”
*****
Steve sighed again, knowing he wouldn’t be winning this battle. “Fine, Tony, go to bed.” He said quietly.
The hand on his watch ticked once and Tony’s head snapped to the door.
It had been 3 days since the attack. Tony still clung to Steve like there was no one else in his life, and Steve still let him because Tony was still his everything. But when James Rhodes heard about the Loki incident, he decided to make another surprise visit to his best friend.
Steve retracted his hand like he’d been bitten. It wasn’t the threat (because really, Tony is like a kitten) but did Tony really just say that? Steve finds himself waiting for the timid Tony to return and apologize, but by the time he realizes it, Tony is already out of his sight. “Wait- Tony?!”
“So what, you’re still hung up over the bar? Or the party? Personally, this just seems like pure, unadulterated jealousy.” Peter goads snidely, “That seems very unprofessional, Captain.” Peter sneers
*******
When he reached the kitchen, Steve saw red. A huge man was holding Tony’s wrist and little Tony was looking like Tony always does, adorable and in need of protection. Steve grabbed the man by the arm and, though it was way more difficult then it would’ve with a normal human, and shoved him against the wall.
“No, Clint, Geez! Wh-”
“Is that… bad?”
know?
~~~~~~~~~~~
Tony started before gaping at Peter. “He did that? After everything?” Tony asked, sounding betrayed and hurt.
pizrak- ghost
Steve’s entire body tensed, moving so that he blocked Tony from Loki’s view. “I want him gone, Phil.”
“Daddy, please, I don-“ Tony was thrown against a wall.
I wrote Please, Dont Believe Me when I was 15, over five years ago. If you happen to go back and read that one, I'll warn you, the writing is not good, the tropes were overused, and it was B O R I N G. I really had no earthly idea what I was writing and had no plans for the fic's plot. That's where this one is different. I HOPE my writing has gotten better but i know for a fact my planning is much better on this one. I know some people may be upset that I made this universe A/B/O. I was really hesitant to do so but I did it because the story NEEDED something else to it. I just couldn't find a reasoning behind a lot of the plot points I wanted to get to and this helped out a lot with creating drama >:)
“Someone get the camera feed from the workshop, pronto-“
, but something was different. The smoke cleared almost instantly and instead of a demanding, layered voice booming through the room, it’s just-
“Each of you should know why you’re here now. The Avengers Initiative. Started by Howard Stark, continued by us, S.H.E.I.L.D., is now being put into action. Ever since the incident in New Mexico, America has realized the need for protection. So, we’ve brought in you, the world’s mightiest heroes. This is the entire team, minus Thor, a demigod from Asgard, who will be joining us once everything with his… brother,“ Fury said the simple word with distain “-Loki, is settled.”
Tony is quickly making his way through the halls, glowering at every painting and plant that he walks by when he gets JARVIS’ message. “Sir, there is a Justin Hammer here to see you.”
Also, I sort of insinuated that Clint had a religious-ish-problem. Uh-no I didn’t mean that, I don’t really think any of the avengers have beliefs like that (cept’ Steve with his whole “there’s only one god and he don’t dress like that. He fab.” thing) so yeah it’s not a biggie. Just a stupid line. (that I wrote)
Loki is halfway through laughing when he hears it. His laughter stops immediately and his eyes go wide.
“Yeah, but you’re just 153 pounds and 5’9’’, Tony. And that face, it just makes people want to-“ The cadet is cut off as he pulls Tony off the ground easily.
He doesn’t stand around to look at Steve’s heartbroken face.
Steve raised his eyebrow, standing and walking slowly towards Tony, yawning as well. “You know, Tony, I may just go to bed, long day and all…” He said. Tony’s smirk fell, thinking maybe he had lost the flirty banter he had going on with Steve.
Another moment.
The doors to the lab burst open. Within seconds there are Shield agents covering the room, weapons trained on the girl opposing Tony. There’s a hand running along Tony’s side and the omega grips Clint’s hand tightly. “I’m okay.” He says immediately, feeling the worry coming off his pack mate in waves. Clint’s body language stays on guard, but his eyes soften. Just seconds later, an overwhelming scent fills the room and Tony braces himself, turning just in time to allow Steve’s hands to grip his neck gently. The alpha uses the hold to maneuver his eyes across Tony’s face, first, then down to the rest of his body.
“No.” Tony glared at the team in front of him.
These were Jarvis hugs. From 10 years ago when his mother died, from when his father got too drunk, too upset, from when Howard lost control. Jarvis was there at the end with these hugs. He was there with these hugs and “I’m sorry, Mr. Tony. So so sorry, Mr. Tony.”
It makes Tony’s stomach drop, the way Clint looks when he tells him. Especially how Clint cuffs him on the back of the head lightly and gives him that proud older brother smile as he gently shrugs, “He kinds reminds me of you.”
Steve growled at the southern man, “Listen closely, ‘Petey’, I don’t trust you with my Tony. I can’t tell you to stay away cause’ for some reason beyond me, he likes you despite the fact that you’re a bad influence and completely untrustworthy-“
H A I L  H Y D R A
Clint groaned and flopped onto his back, “That’s it! Someone else try!”
*Screams*
“We’re going back to Shield and that’s final.” Natasha says, lifting her chin in Steve’s direction in a clear challenge. Steve doesn’t back off, taking a step towards her before Clint intervenes.
been through any kind of head injury, it might be wise to give him some time before jostling him around."
“You ungreatful little shi-“
The archer just shakes his head, looking dumbfounded, “Tony, her brother purposefully set a trap in Baltimore this morning so that she could come here while we were gone. How is none of this suspicious to you?”
“You amazing, beautiful, sm-“
Then Steve pounced, grabbing Tony by the belt loops of his black jeans, and pulling him on the ground. Tony grinned as they began to wrestle. Tony fought somewhat valiantly, but Steve and his stupid serum still won, pinning Tony’s arms down. They were both breathing heavily, though there wasn’t too much of a struggle seeing as Tony was only 150 something pounds. “No fair, you’re on steroids.” Tony whined.
He felt like something was on his chest and it was hard to breathe and-
“Like I said before, it’s just Tony.” He murmurs, looking away and standing from his chair. “Alright well? Are we done here?” He asks, looking towards Fury.
“You’re not my
Tony Stark woke up to a gentle hand on his shoulder, and a loving smile.
Tony had forgotten to change out of his suit, and he was just now noticing the people getting their phones out to take pictures of him. He cursed his decision of going out in such a noticeable fashion. Usually if he threw on a hoodie and jeans no one would even blink at him, but put on that thousand dollar suit and everyone wants an autograph.
Steve, unnerved at seeing Natasha so shaken, yanks the door open to let Natasha leave. As soon as the door closes, the boy begins
“She- Wanda.” Tony corrects, remembering the heartbreaking look that had crossed the girl’s face when talking about her names, “Wanda apologized and said she wants to help.”
“Tony,” Steve’s voice is somehow deeper than Tony remembered, “Are you okay?”
Steve scoffs. “Just because Natasha showed you a few moves does not mean you could fight off whoever it is who’s trying to get to you.”
“Er… hello?” Tony said, trying to sound nonchalant, when in reality he was a little more than freaked out. Sure, he had been in situations like this before- some business owner wanting revenge, some thief wanting money, or even crazy fans who just want to meet him- but each time was worse than the one before.
“Hate to break this to you buddy, but you kind of are.” Clint says teasingly, and Tony’s eyes blink open blearily.
Tony slumps forward, hands coming up to his temples. “My head hurting
Loki gave the 19 year old a quick smile, “I like you, Tony Stark. You’re… interesting.”
At the same time, Steve’s hand was in Tony’s hair, playing with it like Tony liked. Steve was also glaring at Logan, whose hand was tracing one of Tony’s hand’s wrinkles, causing Tony to giggle like a child every now and then. Steve resisted the urge to punch Logan in the face and tell him that only he could touch Tony so intimately.
“Right.” The boy draws the word out, clearly not believing Tony. “Then why did you run in here like you were being chased by a murderer?”
“Ok then. Bruce help little man.”
. Robots, electronics, things that would aid people’s everyday life, not things that would start wars.
Steve was so Steve.
Tony side-eyes him, “What are you talking about?”
“So, what? We’re just going to leave Tony-“ innocent, tiny, meek, vulnerable Tony “-here alone while a giant something is about to hit Albany?” Steve questioned darkly.
Logan stepped forward and crossed his arms, “It does?”
them. Everyone would know the consequences of messing with you because, if you were mine, I would never let anyone forget it.” Their noses are brushing, Steve’s voice is so angry but his face is so unbelievably fond and
Tony let out a short laugh that turned into a long string of giggles. “You are a genius. National icon.” Tony laughed again before stopping and sitting up straight. “Like me! Peter! You are me! We are we!” He giggled again, nearly falling off the barstool.
“I’m sorry, kicsi. You need to sleep more.” Natasha carded her fingers through his soft hair. She gave him another one of those loving smiles.
“My father’s dead.” A long laugh came from the background.
“Tony.” Steve’s voice is low, gravely. Tony suppresses a shiver.
Captain America didn’t have to settle for being Tony’s childhood crush, idol, and personal hero. He also had to be the kind of alpha Tony had only ever dreamed about.
Tony did not like parties.
“I will miss you dearly, sir.” Jarvis quips, sounding incredibly human.
Tony doesn’t like shouting.
He has JARVIS run scans over and over but the message never changes.
“Is there a problem here? Rumlow?” The mystery alpha asks. Yes,
Steve bit back a groan as Bruce replied. “Right, Captain America bullying Tony Stark, I can totally see that.”
“It appears to be Captain Rogers, sir. He wants you to come out to eat.” JARVIS’ British drawl filled the room. Tony groaned again, not in the mood to deal with any of the “jealous and overprotective” fools upstairs, including his boyfriend(?).
*********
Tony walked back into his building with a large sigh. He slouched down into the nearest couch and sighed once more. He was beyond surprised that the Avengers hadn’t called him yet, screaming profanities and threats all the way on their flight home. Tony had no idea when they’d be back, he didn’t even know if they’d heard about the incident (though he was positive they were keeping him under close surveillance). Feeling lonely and slightly depressed, Tony pulled out his phone and called Peter, knowing that if anyone could cheer him up, it would be his best friend.
Obadiah raises a hand, signaling for the sputtering board members to stop. “Tony, I understand your concerns. Don’t you ever wonder why Howard and I went separate ways? When I found out about the questionable way SI was distributing weapons I went to your father personally to try and sort things out. I was severely uncomfortable with how our weapons made for the US army were being found in enemy territory.” The older man shifts in his seat, an offbeat look in his eyes, “That’s where your father and I disagreed. He thought as long as we were making money, it didn’t matter.” Obie sighs, “I won’t speak ill of the deceased but you know your father, Tony, he wasn’t exactly easy to convince. When I couldn’t make him stop production, I decided that it would be for the best if I left the company. I got into this business because I wanted to help protect and defend the people that risk their lives for our country, but I can’t do that without your help. And this time around, we’ll be able to do it the right way. No backhanded deals, no potential for these weapons to fall into the wrong hands.”
“I- I mean-“ Tony sighs, “I don’t really know-“ He sighs again, “Yes. I mean- I think.”
Tony didn’t really remember what hugs like this felt like.
Several hours after having a semi-awkward breakfast with Steve and Clint, Tony settles down in the work shop, intent on finding any information he possibly could on
time.
Tony rolls his eyes at the awkward memory before stepping off the elevator, tapping his receptionist’s desk lightly with an easy smile, “Amy, please do a sleep-deprived, emotionally exhausted, and slightly depressed kid a favor and remind what today’s meeting is about?”
to be a good arms manufacturer. So to hear the head of one of the world’s most dangerous organizations say that he
“Sir,” JARVIS’ voice jumped Tony out of his reverie, “Agent Coulson is in the lobby requesting your presence.”
Dimittam de tuus praeteritum- I release you (from your past)
but you know what I mean. I wasn’t built for this kind of pressure.” Tony rambles, fully realizing how insane he probably sounds in front of this gorgeous alpha but he needs to do this. Maybe if he gets it all out now he won’t accidentally yell all of it in Captain America’s face when they finally meet.
“So I’m the last option. Great.” Tony mumbled.
Tony stares at him blankly. “You’re asking me to do a mission for S.H.I.E.L.D.?”
Tony gave him a half hearted glare muttering, “Gross,” As Steve finished and handed it to Tony.
Natasha rolled her eyes and sighed, “He didn’t read the files.” She explained to everyone else, who all had incredulous looks on their faces. “Tony doesn’t have a family, Clint, you should know that even without reading the files.”
******
“Are they dead?” Tony gasps out, gripping his knees to his chest. “Oh my gosh.” He says almost silently.
“Don’t you dare insinuate that I don’t care about his wellbeing. I’m not the one who gave him a heart att-“
The agent in front of him shakes his head. “I can’t tell you any of this until you decide to take the mission. If you decide not to, that’s okay and no one would judge you for it. This is a highly dangerous mission that needs to be taken seriously.”
“Not intimidating at all, agent.” Tony says dryly. He reads through the contract. Before Tony could walk he knew that you never sign anything until you’ve read every word of the agreement. The contract involves many terrifying articles and it takes Tony a few minutes to get through all of it, but Coulson says nothing until Tony signs it.
The other laughs at that, “It’s cool dude, confrontation isn’t my strong suit either. Just ask my ex.”
He can hear the sound of the Pistol being loaded and all he can think is,
Tony stared on, completely bewildered and slightly embarrassed, as Steve rolled around on the bed, in tears with his laughter. Tony’s blushed and hid his face in his hands, backing away further. “It’s not funny.” He mumbled.
“Okay then, Tony, just try to get some sleep, yeah?” He gave the kid a smile, ruffled his hair a little more and walked out of the room.
.” He sounds so confident, so sure of himself. “I think you’re just overwhelmed. Something really traumatic and scary happened to you and now your brain is trying to piece it all together.”
The two had woken up tangled together even more intricately than they had fallen asleep. Steve’s arms wrapped completely around the omega and his head snoozing against Tony’s fluffy bedhead. They hadn’t said much, just an awkward cough as Steve rolled out to go on his morning run. He had left Tony with a hand carding through the younger’s hair, but no words were exchanged.
Tony mobile
“Hey! Appreciate me, you jerk.”
“Well, yes. But I was going to say protect you. You’re just so small and vulnerable. Like a kitten.” Rhodey says, stroking his hair playfully.
“You mere mortals cannot kill me.” Loki ground out.
Tony sighed, “No, I guess not. I just- I could fight if I wanted!”

“So… the mess is probably going to be an issue.” Peter said nervously, sitting next to Tony after cleaning off one sofa. Tony looked around his tower and noticed the abundance of red solo cups, lone socks, and the occasional pizza crust.
In the last chapter Peter called Tony something that a bunch of people didn’t understand so I’m going to go ahead and tell you in the best way I can
At least, that’s what the vast majority of the world thought.

Tony flushes slightly as Clint rolls his eyes. “C’mere, kid, let me make you breakfast. You look like you haven’t eaten in weeks.
Tony tries his best to hide his preen as he walks Obie out, feeling warmer than he had in a while. Obie’s just about to duck into the car waiting for him when he suddenly turns, “By the way, Tony, HammerTech is having a gala this Saturday. Kind of an party for one of our newer partners. You should come, we can catch up more there.”
be about weapons.
Tony sits on the couch dutifully as each of the Avengers chew him out for succumbing to peer pressure. None of them are harsh though, and each of their words are laced wit silent apologies and pleas for forgiveness.
Howard is not alive.
Next chapter: we meet some new friends, tell some secrets, hide from supersoldiers :)
Steve gives him an interested look, “You don’t say.”
Steve’s heart stops.
Steve seems to be able to hear his thoughts now. “I know, I know it was scary, but you need to calm down Tony. I promise, I’ll protect you, okay? You just need to calm down.”
Thank you everyone sm for all of the support on the first chapter :)))
“Tony, my boy!” Obie greets with a friendly, familiar smile. His voice is just as deep and comforting as it used to be. “It’s been too long. How are you? How’s the company?”
when I realize you left the penthouse because no one would
Tony thinks for a long time.
Peter tightens his grip on Tony, recognizing the short breaths. “Alright Tony, that’s fine. Lemme just-“ Peter brings his head up and searches for the source of the music. “Do you know where the music thingy is?” Peter asks.
“I suggest that you all get to the car outside, it’ll take you to the tower.” Fury advised, sauntering out of the room just behind Phil.
The omega glances back, just barely meeting Steve’s gaze. He stops in his tracks, truly taken aback for a moment because
happen to have a little bit of a soft spot for the guy." Tony responds and Steve raises an eyebrow.
Tony nods, reveling even in the slight comfort Steve’s voices gives him. “I trust you.”
Some of the men around Tony laughed, the closet one clapping him on the shoulder. “She’s a bit old for you, isn’t she, Stark?”
Thor was quiet, and Steve almost ordered Logan to take him down, afraid that Thor was going to switch sides, but Thor recovered quickly, tightening his hand around Mjölnir. “You have hurt this world enough already.” He said simply, “You must accept defeat now, or you will regret it profoundly.” Thor advised.
Steve’s eyebrows furrow at that, “Of course.” He agrees, “And your parents too, right?” He asks, and Tony shakes his head, returning Steve’s confused face with a puzzled look of his own, like it’s so obvious why his own parents wouldn’t bond with him.
There’s a bright light, a loud thud, and a slight roasting smell. Tony takes that as a win.
The girl’s voice is soft and trembling. She can’t be older than 18, not with the way she’s curling in on herself across the room, shaking as though Tony’s the thing to be afraid of here. Tony’s shaking to, arm jammed almost painfully into the crude glove-like contraption that’s connected to a miniature arc reactor. He hasn’t tested it at all, isn’t even sure if a shot from the reactor would be more than a slight shock—isn’t sure if it would result in the entire building imploding, either.

Peter sent Tony an incredulous look, “I am not you, Antonius-whatever the hell your last name is- I’m not nearly as cute as you.” The bartender buried his face in his arms that were resting on the table, “I’m hot and manly.”
*****
-malfunction-“ Jarvis’ voice, glitching and pitchy, cuts off, startling Tony out of his work and making him push the goggles on his face up onto his head.
Steve’s reaction isn’t exactly what Tony expected. At first, yes, he looks extremely shocked. But once he fully processes the information, Steve doesn’t look concerned. If anything, he looks pitying. “Tony…” He sighs softly, “You’ve been through a lot these past few days.”
Steve exhales softly to his left, and a strong, heavy arm drapes itself over Tony’s waist. He tries his best not to snuggle backwards but allows his hand to cover Steve’s arm, a tad helplessly. Tony’s crush is just a little hero worship gone too far—he’ll get over it eventually. For now, he’ll allow himself the comfort of a strong alpha who seems to care about him at least a little bit. Blinking at the tattered picture of Steve and his dead best friend one last time, Tony closes his eyes and tries to sleep.
also clint is the best character in this story fight me
I’m sorry if this sucks, I wrote it over a long period of time so I hope it all makes sense. Plus I wrote most of it in the wee hours of the night.
. He ignores Clint’s shocked laughter because this is a serious question.
“Well, that was expected. Given his past…” The doctor trailed off.
All beautiful blue eyes and muscles and caring about the little people like Tony.
Yep. Steve.
Steve grinned warmly before reaching over and forcing Tony to look at him, “For one Tony, you can ask just about anyone and they’ll tell you that I’m telling you the honest truth when I say that you’re one of the best looking, most beautiful, hottest, sexiest-“
Tony grimaces as he turns to face Steve. “What the
Tony didn’t like not feeling.
Tony laughed. Or… he tried to.
Tony blinks up at him.
. it's kind of dead right now but I am accepting prompts for one-shots or longer fics.
Peter scrunched up his nose, “I think you’re fine the way you are.”
“Shield has been investigating the uprising of an unknown group across Northeast Asia. It wasn’t confirmed until recently, but HYDRA is back, and they’ve got their own team of supers.” Fury’s words aren’t taken lightly.
Tony’s jaw clenched. “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”
Tony sighs, running a shaking hand through his hair and scooting away from Steve so that their legs are no longer brushing against each other’s. Steve feels the distance a little too poignantly. “That’s just not how they were, I guess.” Tony says lowly. Steve can tell, Tony
Tony huffed and put down his blowtorch, “What’s so funny about that?”
Tony smiled half-heartedly at Steve as the team filed back into the tower, each bruised and battered, but clean nonetheless.
“It’s all of our damn faults!” Logan yelled.
“Of course I am. You are too.” Clint says, his tone light but there’s something else there. It’s clear that Clint is at least somewhat aware of Steve’s feelings. Not that he’s been subtle. Clint looks frustrated then, “He’s always different in December. After Jarvis died… he hasn’t been the same. But most of the time he seems to be happy. But whenever the anniversary comes around he just shuts down.”
“What are you even doing to him, you bastard?” Natasha demanded, holding Clint up, who had been re-gaining consciousness when they entered.
From her place beside him, Natasha flinches. “That is just a ghost story, Wanda, you can’t-“
The beta winces slightly, “I feel like now is the right time for me to say I do know who you are… and I also know your secondary gender.” The words come out in a rush, “But I totally don’t care about either of those things and would really like for us to be friends.”
Steve stood in front of the teenager in shock for a second before answering, “Tony we just-“
Tony is nineteen. Clint would probably kill him.
Tony gave him a bored look, “And you do understand I don’t have time for a long chat.”
“Wait-“ Tony stops Justin’s fangirling “You’re talking about the Avengers?”
“Mr. Stark.” She says, giving him a look over. “I can’t say I was expecting you to be here tonight.” She said conversationally, though her eyes clearly were asking why a teenager was here to gather the information.
None of them argued over that matter anymore.
Maybe this isn’t good, to be so dependant and reliant and in love with someone who will never feel the same way about you.
If you are not aware this is a rewrite of a story I wrote five years ago. It IS linked below so if you really want to, you can go ahead and read it. Let me warn you though, it is incomplete and terribly written. You DO NOT need to read that story before this one and in fact I'd prefer if you didn't because it has SPOILERS for this story.
Steve shakes his head before Tony even finishes his sentence. “It doesn’t matter if it makes sense, Tony. We’re on a team, I should have trusted your judgement.” He looks at his feet in what might be anger. “I should have listened. I was being a bad a friend and… an even worse alpha.”
Hulk no like.
Tony takes a deep breath as he steps into Shield headquarters. He had been here countless times before, but that didn’t stop the deep-seated anxiety that fills him every time he walks in. He does his best to reign in his emotions. No one likes the smell of a weak omega, Tony reminds himself. He needs to hold his head high, stare at the picture of Aunt Peggy that’s hanging near the doorway, and pretend like he’s meant to be here.
The boy raises his eyebrows, grinning widely, “Oh, good, you’re back! You were panicking for a second there. Whenever I’m freaking out it always helps if someone just talks to me for a while, so I thought I’d try that.”
Tony rolls his eyes good-naturedly, clenching his hands so Clint won’t see the slight tremor going through them.  “Of course. Fury just loves to catch me off guard. Luckily for him, the tower
Tony gapes, “Why?” At Coulson’s silence he reassesses. “I mean, why me? You have hundreds of trained, experienced agents on hand. There are actually two living upstairs, if you didn’t know.”
Hundreds of tabs flew across the screen. There were mixtures of doctors’ reports, video players, and news articles, each of them containing one common factor. They each had a header that somehow concluded Tony Stark’s name.
“You know, old man,” Tony said quietly, placing his hand on Steve's forearm, “you aren't just my repairman. You know that, right?”
He heard Steve give another laugh, longer and louder this time. Much nicer, in all honesty. "Then . . . Go to prom with me. Maybe then I'll finally let you know my secrets. How's that sound?"
The officer rolled his eyes and pinched his nasal bridge with a sigh. “You're really going to flirt with a cop after he's arrested you?”
He watched Steve get out of the driver's seat and join him in the back. “You wanna get us killed?” He asked sharply, his intimidating glare doing nothing to simmer Tony's thirst. “A little death never hurt nobody.” He replied.
“No. I mean, yes--I mean--” A thoughtful, confusing pause. “I don't like it.”
Steve, again, didn't say anything. He simply wrapped his arms around his boyfriend and pulled him in for a hug, breathing in the scent of oil and citrus.
Tony smiled the tiniest bit and mumbled a thanks to the man before walking off to the center fountain.
“Your father?--”
Wait. Was Steve waving at him?
Nobody could love him. Nobody would ever love him. Tony believed so. But as Captain America pulled him in for a kiss to show just how much he meant those three simple words, Iron Man realized just how wrong he was.
during the entire time he's been dating genius-billionaire-philanthropist Tony Stark. But, with Tony out of his sights for more than he ever expected, Steve couldn't take the loneliness any longer.
As both men's lips closed and their conversation was silenced, Tony's heart rate increased. He was going to do it. He was going to ask Steve on a date.
"Fucking Howerd . . . Suckin' up ta robots but not yur own son . . . Not even once . . . " Tony slurred miserably, taking another unusually huge gulp from his already mostly-downed beer. He'd lost count on how many he'd drunken already, but he was too intoxicated to care.
And everyone in the tower knew that too, because the second the duo comes crashing into the living room talking about bagels being a donut's crispier cousin or if tomato sauce is really a jelly, they can see Tony's fingers no longer twitching from constant obsessive insomnia and Steve's stretchy worn-out attitude now more blinding than the sun. And this,

. As in, literal context. Ever since their relationship became official, Tony's been giving himself permission to lay beside Steve (and Steve never complained) every night--if he wasn't tinkering with his suits down in the lab, that is.
puzzled.
The second the two met up again Clint was dragging Steve out of the Avengers tower, mumbling compliments to himself about how he just convinced Steve Rogers, the most stubborn man alive, to have a night out with him.
On many occasions Tony found himself thinking, "What if I just threw the accords away? Would me and Steve finally be able to suck up the tension and go back to normal?  Would that decision bring us both justice?"
Steve put his hand up in defense. “Fine, what
- more edgy bad boy tony!
He choked, then stammered, "Uh--Tony--"
When Steve pulled away, he smiled gently and took a step back from Tony, a few smudges of blackish-brown now present on his shirt. “Come on, try-hard, I'll make you some breakfast. And wash yourself up. You're dirty.”
Steve puts his cup down gently, clasping his hands together as if he's in a conference meeting. “Tony, what happened last night?”
Steve was then (force) fed granola bars too, and then taken, by hand, out of their home and to the car.
Steve was scrolling through his phone while procrastinating on homework when Tony--his edgy ass boyfriend--burst inside his room with a tomato-red face, his favorite AC/DC jacket clenched tightly in his fist. "MY FUCKING ZIPPER BROKE!" He yelled, nearly causing Steve to go deaf.
He scanned his surroundings. Nowhere else to go but the way he came in, and he wasn't going to take that chance. He hoped that guy would run right passed him and never be seen again, but, low and behold, this wasn't a cartoon show and that cop caught him trying to sink into the shadows almost immediately.
“He waved to me.”
On the very rare occasions that Tony would get up and fix himself in his bathroom, probably the thing he feared most other than the civil war was his own face. He couldn't stand the scars that were set deep into him. If he looked too long, he would belch. Not that the scars were gruesome, but because Steve had been the one to do the damage. His reflection was a constant reminder of this horrible, horrible mistake on both their ends. Tony had done him dirty too, he was sure of it, but part of the broken billionaire wondered if Steve went through the same problem. Did he look in the mirror and let a tear slip when he saw his scars? Would he be disgusted looking at his broken suit because it reminded him of when he and his then-boyfriend tore each other apart with no mercy or remorse? Did he ever wish to go back in time and fix them before any of this happened? Tony did. He did every day.
time ago.” He side-smiled weakly.
"Why'd you use my mug?!"
Steve no longer had to search, no longer had to drag his feet through the rubble and find nothing.
Both men were screaming and fist-pumping the air mentally, patting themselves on the back like they were kings. This was utopia, wasn't it?

. The captain's attitude completely brightens, his slumped posture straightens, and the happiness Tony makes him feel is all that he needs to destroy the empty tiredness riling up in his chest.
