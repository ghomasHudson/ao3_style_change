“Tony, I-,” Steve stopped, gazing into Tony’s fearful eyes. The brown orbs glistened with tears that wouldn’t fall and Steve felt his heart melt with empathy and concern. Should he sit by Tony? Should he…. Lay next to him to keep him warm?
“That sounds comfortable, babe. Not sure what you are talking about.” The super soldier’s dry sense of humor was met with a soft, affectionate smile from Tony, although unseen by his counterpart.
“You know what I’ll be doing on the nights I get dibs on the bed!” Tony winked and realized that his statement was more flirtatious than he meant it to be. He cast his eyes up to the ceiling and walked back to the top of the stairs as the Captain grinned and shook his head in good-humored denial.
Tony retched and fell to his side, lone functioning arm collapsing under him. He threw up the minimal contents in his stomach and then howled from the pain shooting up his bicep from where his abdomen pressed against his fracture.
“Alright. What’s the plan?” Steve looked down from the ledge, inspecting the pathway that they had already climbed through. He could see the water rising steadily despite the dim lighting. Lights snapped, glass shattering into the abyss as the liquid shorted the electrical work. It was going to be pitch black in a matter of seconds.
Tony was going to ensure that his dick remained soft this entire time. He wasn’t going to give Hammer the satisfaction of having him erect and looking as if he was ready to go. If Justin was just going to stroke him like a sloppy one-night stand, he could manage.
The hunger and thirst were also getting to him. His stomach growled painfully and several times he had turned his head to throw up foodless bile. His only words had been requests for Steve to turn his head while he used the bathroom, although even those moments were few and far between since he had nothing new digested to discard from his body.
Steve blinked, obviously confused but concern and paternal instincts flooded through him as he walked closer. “Hey, what’s going on?” He stepped towards her and a low whine sounded out with his first step.
Pig-face scoffed and dropped Tony for the final time, the leg slipping through his fingers as he cackled.
The island was bigger than Steve had guessed, so it took him a while to make it on foot. The lack of shoes made it more difficult, as he often stepped on seashells or rocks, cutting his feet open; the sand stuck to the blood and grated against his bare flesh.
Realizing what he had just done, Steve pulled back in embarrassment. He coughed and stood up, walking away with his hands on his hips. He left the encampment.
Eventually, despite Steve’s stops, the two men made their way through the grand corridors. The entrance was decorated with chandeliers, ornate carpeting, and twisted craftsman wood. It was nice. It wasn’t really Tony’s style, but he didn’t mind it. He preferred modern and high-tech versus the traditional Jack and Rose,
Natasha looked at Clint over the morning news. Clint was eating a bowl of Captain Crunch and slurping his milk noisily.
Tony blinked. His mouth moved open and then closed. Then he began chuckling. Soon his initial laughter turned thunderous and he bent over clutching his stomach as his crow’s feet crinkled. “You screamed bloody murder for me- to come up here- to see – that you found-“ he breathed “-a hidden
New York City seemed as if it was going to pure shit, however the citizens who weren't affected by the toxin had pulled together and started working hard as a collective community, clearing rubble, moving survivors, and transporting supplies to their end location.
“Do not further harm a hair on his head…. Bring him over and we can talk about who you are and what you want…” Steve raised his arms in surrender, worried more about Tony’s life than anything else. His heart was pounding, and he felt tears stinging his eyes at the thought that Tony’s last memories could be tears and hurt feelings caused by Steve’s own apprehension and fear.
Hammer removed a remote from his pocket, pressed a button, and several screen projections lit up the concrete walls. Tony’s friends. His comrades. Chained and beaten and each with a gun mere inches from their heads.
The men began stripping Steve but had trouble lifting his limbs to get the clothing off. They resorted to just slicing it with box cutters instead, accidentally slashing some of Steve’s skin in the process.
“Well, if that wasn’t a giveaway for what you don’t want me to do…” Hammer smiled and licked his lips greedily, turning on one heel and striding over to Steve. “Don’t touch…
“NEXT.” Brahn shouted, ignoring the beginnings of Tony’s argument and persuasion techniques. People rushed around them, excited to get to their destination as they shoved into the men in the middle of the ramp.
Tony clenched his teeth and his fists. What the fuck was Steve doing? Why wasn’t he fighting? Did he slip into unconsciousness after his shit-eating smirk?
Tony grabbed an upset and flabbergasted Steve, yanking him to the side of the ramp so that they were out of the way. “Fuck. Do you think this was intentional??” Tony questioned.
- were worried about you! You can’t just charge ahead without the rest of the group- and you are out of your suit- are you kidding me-” Steve continued scolding, walking towards Tony with a hand outstretched to help him up.
Tony’s body contracted, chest flying forward and fists grasping for something, anything, to grip. He howled and shook his head side to side, nurses struggling to keep a hold of him.
He swallowed, sweat dripping down his Adam’s apple, as he stared Tony down, glancing repeatedly between the embarrassed brown eyes and their owner’s cock.
Supporting Tony’s weight with one arm, Hammer unzipped his pants noisily, cock springing out of his pants and tapping Tony’s exposed, dangling sack. Tony groaned out of pain as the head bumped against his tender flesh, already raw from the pressure washer.
“Just leave him alone Hammer. Haven’t you already cause him enough pain?” Steve tried to draw the attention towards himself. Tony’s blue eyes flickered his way in irritation for the self-sacrificial move.
A little later on posting this than I expected, but ah well! Thank you so much for all of your kind reviews and kudos. If you are lurking in the shadows, please feel free to write an anonymous review or leave a kudo whether you like or not; constructive criticism or expression of enjoyment keep me writing!
As if on cue, Steve yelled out as one of the henchmen shoved an electrogun into his waist, electrical current running through his muscles. Tony opened his eyes again to see Steve slump momentarily against the wall and then weakly hold his head back up.
Tony nodded slowly and, using Steve’s shoulders, sat down on the jagged ground. He slumped against a rock for back support.
Mr. Likart was in the corner by the sewing machine. There was a reason for the disarray of sewing materials. His arm was twisted above his head in an unnatural fashion, fingers tied to the machine by the needle that penetrated them. Blood spider webbed its way down his arm. His neck was spun around like something from a horror movie and mouth wide open in shock, jaw gaping in a way that looked forced. His eyes were open, but orbitals missing, as blood dripped its way like tears down his cheeks. There were multiple pictures depicting his slaughter. Each one performed the difficult task of making Tony Stark shake with terror.
The body just coughed again in response. It was shirtless, a man, and began to shift as it coughed. Something small and fluffy zoomed from the man’s arms and into the forest, Steve following it with his gaze before settling back on the now exposed face of the man.
Tony began counting in his head to calm himself, a simple technique learned from his guru in India. He counted 97 seconds exactly until Steve jogged down the steps to his lab, tapped on the glass, and, after a relief click of the lock, opened the door and slid in.
The customer service desk did nothing for them. In fact, Tony was pretty sure that it increased his risk for stomach ulcers by 2%. They merely shrugged the two men off and, again, Tony saw the tattoos emblazoned on the desk keeper’s wrist. He told Steve about his concerns, including the tattoos and whether the staff was part of Kang’s crew or not. Though Steve had not witnessed the tattoos, Tony was happy to hear that Steve met his concerns.
Pigface's right hand grasped a black-clad ankle that was attached to a body being dangled over the balcony railing. The body appeared unconscious as it remained still and not struggling. Steve recognized the black loafers immediately upon entering the room.
Steve didn’t even know how to respond so he kept silent. Granted, he appreciated the compliment, but he didn’t want to encourage any feelings of attraction that he had already been having. These feelings had been popping up sporadically since he first met the billionaire. Specifically, when they were alone. Or when they got into an argument and they moved bitterly close to one another.
The boat lurched to one side and unintentionally, but not unpleased with himself, one of the minions jammed his knife deep into Steve’s chest. The super soldier sputtered in shock of both the knife and the ship’s sudden change in positioning.
Tony raised his hand and thumbs-upped Steve before settling the same hand on the bar, ready to get the fuck out from under the metal that had claimed him.
“I have to go, Tony.” Steve hadn’t noticed, but Tony’s arm lay gingerly over his resting belly, his small fingers clasping tightly through Steve’s own larger ones. Steve pried his hand away easily from the weakened man and patted Tony’s head. “It will be alright.”
The structure was a bright light within the dim New York forestry that surrounded it. The concrete walls were lit up from various spotlights, glowing scarlet circles of numerous landing pads, and the luminous reflections on the black glass windows lining the main dormitory bunker. The Avengers' headquarters was quiet but not fully silent as the faint sound of laughter and mild bickering could be heard through the dim lit hallways leading to Steve Rogers' room. The walls were made to be soundproof so as not to disturb one another, but when certain members of the Avengers were together, the noise level would always rise above what Stark’s engineers had planned for.
He opened his eyes when Hammer slapped his palm onto Tony’s ass, hands subsequently rubbing along his cleft, lubing it up. Justin grabbed his hips and hoisted them up so that Tony’s pelvis was flush with the villain’s hips. He looked at Tony hungrily.
He crawled on three limbs over to the bush and pulled back the leaves, revealing a small black tuft of fur with bright yellow orbs in it. He snuck his hand in and wrapped his fingers around the fur, pulling it out gently.
Steve was in the middle of retreating inside his mind and thinking of how their evening could’ve gone with them dancing the night away. How it could have gone if Steve had just given into his feelings and let his face drop down to Tony and gently-
When Tony had first woken up from his coma, he stank. He could barely stand the stench of himself and so, finally, he reached out to Steve for help. The mechanic could not walk by himself, weak as he was, so Steve had slipped an arm through his and Tony leaned on him towards the water.
Tony leaned forward and shoved Steve, “You do shit all the time. Don’t pretend that you are an angel like you do at home.”
When Hammer was finally caught and imprisoned, Tony slept soundly in the arms of Steve Rogers and didn’t wake to nightmares.
Hammer wrenched his hips back and darted forward with his dick, hitting Steve’s pucker and finding a brick wall waiting for him. Their captor cursed and grabbed himself, as his cock had bent unnaturally at Steve’s closed off entrance.
“Shit shit shit…” Steve had a huge gash on the side of his face from where the beam had struck him. Without thinking, Tony grabbed Steve’s shield and laid it over the super soldier’s chest before wrapping his smaller body around the bigger man’s. “I got you…”
Tony’s skin tasted salty with sweat but, to Steve, it was the best thing he had ever tasted. Tony’s smell infiltrated his nose and Steve found his clothed member stabbing into the man’s thigh, rubbing back and forth to increase the friction under his pants.
Tony remained silent and watched as they drug the large man over to the chains, clearly still struggling with his massive size. They wrapped the manacles around his wrists and began hoisting Steve up by the chains; it took all the men pulling to raise him up.
The super soldier jumped, pulling back at the same time and throwing his toes into the trunk of the tree before shimmying his way up. The shimmy went great, until the same bird started pecking at Steve’s head angrily. Apparently this was the bird’s tree and it wasn’t too keen on sharing.
They had reached the outside of their room. Steve slid his key-card into the door, propping the solid wood open with his hand as he motioned for Tony to go in first. “
Across from Tony’s sat an additional cloth pallet. Steve strode over to it and laid down, sighing with exhaustion. He shouldn’t sleep. He should keep watch. It was his responsibility. But he couldn’t help the tugging at his eyelids. Just for a few minutes.
rescue was coming, he supposed. He didn’t know if any of his fellow Avengers had been captured or caught in the blast, or exactly how far the blast had reached. Worry filled his every feature. Worry for Tony. Worry for his comrades. Worry for himself came last.
Finally, movement flushed through Steve’s muscles and he sprinted across what little room stood between him and his lover. He eyed the wound and noted that it didn’t have an exit; the bullet would still be inside Tony’s abdomen. The size of the entry was small, but blood poured from it never-the-less.
they were teammates. Colleagues. It would get in the way. It would ruin their friendship and teamwork if it didn’t work out. It was impossible. The team would judge them.
In frustration, Steve chucked the sticks across the campsite and fell to his knees. Normally so composed, he found himself breaking slowly. Dehydration stole his tears, so he just balled up his fists and squeezed his eyes shut.
His left arm was broken. He could see it in his peripheral vision and could see how mangled it was. It was bending at odd shapes all along the forearm and various gashes were torn into it, revealing splintered bone, fraying muscle, and the white lines of various tendons and nerves.
“Not hungry. I’ll stay here until JARVIS is done.” Tony was now sitting on the couch, flicking his finger on his phone screen as he tried to determine what to do next. He felt awkward with just him and Steve. They were friends. Co-workers. But it was rare that they spent time alone together and the time alone that they did spend normally resulted in one of them opening up to the other, feeling vulnerable, and then putting on a macho front and ruining any chance of further kindling of their relationship.
Things had become even more strained after that, with Tony’s bitterness increasing because of his embarrassment; humility was not common among the Starks and Tony was no exception.
He heard Tony’s voice echo a few rooms away, clearer now that he was in the hallway. He rushed past each room, throwing open the doors, while finding each chamber empty. The lights were flickering even more ominously. He was no expert on boats nor electrical engineering, but he knew that it was only a matter of time before the entire hallway was pitch black and overcome by the ocean’s embrace; he had to find Tony before they went out.
He walked before at least a mile before turning around. He was exhausted and started to feel his head swell from the humidity and heat. He was so thirsty that he licked a bead of sweat off of his bicep; the saltiness was bitter and did him no good.
“I’m so sorry, Tony...” Steve said with a grimace before positioning himself behind Tony, squatting, and wrapping his large arms underneath Tony’s armpits. He lifted and Tony, in a delirium, began screaming coldly, head thrashing back and eyes rolling into the back of his head. Words peeled from the genius’s lips as his hoarse voice echoed through the explosion-induced cavern.
Tony was normally feisty, but with the addition of the few drinks he had in the stateroom, he was a paragon of difficulty. Still, he wasn’t rude to Steve, just fussy about JARVIS’s attitude.
Tony was side eyeing the man, not turning his head towards him as a façade of confidence and fearlessness. “Who the fuck isn’t? Collection of nerves in one precise location…I’ve taken martial arts for years and took basic anatomy in middle school… cut to the chase.”
The beam of the flashlight was now shaking as Steve tried to comprehend what he was looking at. His mouth opened and closed as his eyes narrowed at the horror-inducing image.
As they walked, the two passed by waitresses offering more martinis and cocktails, Tony often reaching for one and Steve shifting so as to pull Tony back from the beverage tray.
Tony had been on plenty of cruises before, mostly on personal ships that he or his parents owned, so he wasn’t really surprised by the vastness that was
not a piece of meat!” It was said like Steve was defending the waiter but really, he couldn’t help but agree, as well as be a bit jealous that he wasn’t the one absorbing all of Tony’s attention.
Every now and then his mind would momentarily go to Steve. He was worried about him and couldn’t stop his heart from aching when he thought of the super soldier in the same position.
They had grabbed an uneventful breakfast from the buffet a few floors down and barely said one word to each other, much to Steve’s chagrin. Steve found that he quite enjoyed his conversations with Tony, even when they bickered like an actual married couple. He thought to himself that maybe Tony’s silence had been triggered from the events last night.
Tony’s shoulders were inflamed and swollen from being held in such an awkward position over his head for so long and from lack of use. His arms hung limply by his sides and his legs were bent weakly as he unintentionally delivered his total body weight into Steve’s embrace.
It had been one week since their escape and the surgery that had saved Tony’s physical body; Steve had barely left his side, only leaving to shower, eat minimal amounts of food, and use the bathroom. Tony had yet to wake up, although admittedly the doctors had been placing him on a heavy sedative since his dire reactions during surgery.
Meanwhile, Steve had been forcefully relocated from Tony’s direct bed side and was instead standing several feet away, witnessing the whole traumatic display. He wrung his hands nervously as the doctor grabbed forceps and, in Steve’s mind, dug in to Tony’s abdomen.
They broke through the water with gasps and flailed around, blinking fast and breathing hard. Tony's hair and beard were plastered to his skin and Steve's bald head glistened from the moisture. The water was tingling their bodies as mild electrical currents flowed through the liquid from the broken light fixtures. Tony hissed in discomfort.
With his free hand, Justin reached up to tweak Tony’s left nipple, earning a cry in response as sharp pain treaded along his synapses. Hammer leaned down and sloppily licked across his pleasure trail, leaving a humiliating wad of saliva running down the slight angle of his pelvis.
Oh well. Tony was particularly good at ignoring Steve’s thoughts and feelings. Not so good at ignoring the man’s pettiness.
questions, just shut up Steve. Shut up until we get out of here…” His voice was so low that Steve could barely make out what he was saying, especially without seeing the genius’ lips form the words.
The hallway beyond was lined with dim lighting that flicked with each boom that sounded from the crashing plains overhead. Tony blinked and scanned his screens for any abnormalities before proceeding ahead, feet lightly clanking against the hard flooring as he tried to tread as stealthily as possible.
“Antione, we need to make it to dinner before you fulfill your alcoholic desires, please.” Steve squeezed his hand and pursed his lips, looking sideways into Tony’s eyes. Tony rocked his head side to side in a
Steve preferred the busy sounds of the city; car horns, people shouting and cajoling, and the occasional ‘hot dog, get ya hot dogs!’ from the street vendors. But here he was, stuck on an island with a sick man who he may or may not have feelings for. That was to be determined… if Tony even lived.
“Well you know how I have repeating dreams sometimes?” Steve nodded, “Well… I am having them about this conversation that I had with this old man…” Tony took an hour and relayed to Steve his conversation with Mr. Likart and the traumatic events that followed with the man’s untimely and gruesome death.
, he had marked a crimson happy face on Billie. Steve had scolded him for the briefest of seconds, angry that Tony had “ruined” his friend. Steve still had no idea that Tony talked to Billie and that the boulder was indeed his friend too.
He needed to get to Tony, and from the sound of the cry that had emanated through the trees, he needed to do so fast.
“I don’t really give a shit what she has. You treat women- and humankind in general- with respect, dignity, and tenderness, buddy.” The shorter man’s blue eyes flashed as he spoke, obviously triggered by the situation.
Weirdly, Tony’s feverish brain made Steve’s entire body glisten and sparkle in the firelight. He looked as if he was sprinkled was gold flakes. Tony, still hyperventilating, smiled hysterically at the sight, half delirious and half happy.
A nurse let go of Tony’s leg and it immediately began kicking but she continued running towards the far side of the room.
While Steve stood in shock, the child suddenly screamed bloody murder and chucked Tony's body over Steve like a ragdoll. The mechanic landed beyond the couch with a sick thud.
Tony’s eyes began to water as his breathing quickened. His chest rose and fell rapidly, and his good hand began to shake as it reached for its left sided match.
“Sentry mode.” The suit peeled back off of him and Tony stepped out, decreasing his height several inches as he did so. The suit pieced itself back together behind him and raised it’s blasters defensively.
Tony thought before the panic flushed into his body. He began to fight, good arm weakly wrapping around the metal hand and attempting to pry it off of his neck.
Tony’s mouth gaped in horror. A scream built into his chest, but the muscles of his throat were so tight that it couldn’t penetrate his mouth. He couldn’t breathe, move, or blink. He could only stare at the distorted face staring back at him.
He tried to keep his emotions from surfacing and affecting his responses to the genius, but it was difficult. Cap was strong in a lot of ways but keeping his deeper emotions from painting his face was not his strong suit. Tony was extremely expressive on a normal day, but today his face was a blank slate. Tony’s lack of expression was also
At the end of every day, Tony would lock every door and set Jarvis on high alert; not even a mouse could escape the minute by minute laser scans that washed over each room. Occasionally something would trigger Jarvis’s sensors and alarms would sound; it took hours for Steve to calm Tony’s breathing and mind down for him to at the very least lay back into Steve’s arms. He would never go back to sleep and often wouldn’t sleep the next day after, instead choosing to tinker with mechanics in the bed beside Steve, a dim book light shining in his lap so as to not disturb his partner.
When they reached the limo, Steve slipped into the backseat, desperately hard, mind racing as he wondered what Tony’s plan was. What he didn’t expect was Tony sliding to his knees between Steve’s legs.
His whole body tensed and the plug was unforgiving, shifting until the vibration rested directly on his prostate. He gripped Tony’s arm. Remembering the dark glint in Tony’s eye when he slid the plug into him -- Tony loved this, Steve flustered, desperate, turned into a needy mess for Tony.
then why else are you so uncomfortable sharing a bed with…” he trailed off, walking down a logical path that could only lead to one place, given how Steve was acting all day, and Steve fell right over the edge of realization with him, breath catching and mind reeling. The conclusion Tony had come to was one Steve had only learned himself over the last twenty-four hours. His face flamed red and he wished more than anything that their heads weren’t sharing a pillow so that he could bury his into its suffocating softness.
Steve bared his teeth and moved. Allowing Stane to gain any advantage, let alone the upper hand--Steve was unwilling to let that happen. This was Tony’s fight, but there was only so much Steve could take. Tony dodged Stane’s kick and turned onto him, practically crawling over Stane’s side, still laying by the coffee table, in an attempt to wrap his hands around his neck.
Except this wasn’t Steve’s fight. It never was, and it wouldn’t be until Tony tapped him into it. And right now all Steve could tell from the situation was that Tony wanted him to keep distracting Stane far more than he wanted him to strangle him. Because on the bed, Tony moved silently to his knees.
Steve gave him no time to adjust, pushing all the way in. Tony barely had time to savour the salty taste of precum before Steve’s cock hit the back of his throat, and it was all he could do to keep from gagging. He focused on relaxing, opening up to take in all of him as Steve set a punishing rhythm, thrusting into Tony’s willing mouth.
“I thought you were in the workshop this whole time!” To Tony’s left Steve laughed and Anthony snorted, Tony turned his head to look at them. “Who's there?”
Except, when the stairwell door broke open on the floor he’d last seen him on, it was abandoned. Pulling in a deep breath through his nose revealed nothing but cleaning supplies and the adrenaline of late night business dealings.
He desperately wanted Tony to know him as Steve. He told himself that was why he pushed it to the side, failed to think about what it meant, but here he was a “Hero” and he was failing the one man he...cared for.
Clint reacted, he was a superhero after all, but since his bow and arrows were one storey below, and the biggest weapon he had on hand was in his boxer shorts (and he definitely didn’t want to use it against a knife), he instead ducked low and hid behind the kitchen island. He opened a drawer and pulled out the first thing his hand touched: a whisk. “I’m armed!” Clint warned.
Tony locked the suit in its dock and it hissed as the pressurized metal released. A technician pulled his helmet off. The green goo that filled the armour stuck to Tony's face, sliding down his neck, but Tony ignored it, his mouth moving a mile a minute the second his face was revealed. Steve fended off memories of water sliding over his shoulders as he pushed out of the pool, the pull of his fitted suit jacket around his lean, muscular waist.. The locker room--
penthouse when he wanted Tony. Tony had explained it as something to do with the memory of Howard killing Stane’s boner. Either way, Steve was grateful. He didn’t have to worry about growling throughout his entire visit from Stane’s lingering scent.
by my presence or something you can go fuck off in the dark cockpit for 5 hours and we can do this all in shifts--”
When they reached the limo, Tony slipped into the backseat, desperately hard, mind racing as he wondered what Steve’s plan was. What he didn’t expect was Steve sliding to his knees between Tony’s legs.
Tony’s fingers fumbled over it, pulling it from the wood. He held it out and Steve had to tug a little to get it out of Tony’s grip. “You know what this is, yeah?”
He sketched, trying not to think, which was probably how he ended up drawing a rough sketch of the window display from that day on the sidewalk. The clothing that had transfixed Tony, with its sleek, dark fabrics, and finely cut corners. Tony had stood in front of a three piece suit, the crisp, buttoned vest framed by an open jacket.
“Tony, so irresistible. I have to--” Steve bent over, tongue pulling at his rim. Tony arched into it when Steve fully breached him with his finger, twisting to find that place inside that never failed to alight him with pleasure. Steve’s other hand gripped into his hip hard as he shifted, and Tony looked over his shoulder to see him naked and flushed and hard, hand on his cock, dragging it around Tony’s hole. He caught Tony’s eye then his eyelids drooped almost immediately with a moan of his own. Tony flushed with satisfaction, and pushed his body onto Steve because he was Steve’s, and Steve wanted him.
Tony had to admit he was lucky that James appreciated an impulsive surprise. Taking it in stride, James leaned back on his heels with his arms crossed and smirked. He’d still followed Tony’s lead. Accompanied by a quip, of course. “If a battleship isn’t a cruise ship, neither is your private yacht.”
“This, too!” Tony buzzed around the area, holding up the grenade he once jumped on, an old sweater of his. Every object Tony showed him with an expectant face, ready to share in the joy of a hero's detritus.
Tony put his hands up. “It’s nothing like that! I hadn’t considered it before, I swear, and now I have. Blame it on the multiverse travel-induced concussion.” Agitation tightened his throat. He caught his counterpart’s gaze and let the truth of his words show. “You know I’d do anything to be with the ones I love, because you’d do the very same.” He held Anthony’s gaze until he nodded and then Tony continued, “But I will not, ever, hurt that man or any of his counterparts that may exist in any multiverse. You
Tony was in hyperfocus. His snug red breeches were tight around his thighs, narrowing into leather boots. He held a riding crop. Steve tried to clear his throat and swallow at the same time and ended up coughing instead. No one was around to hear, just Steve and his tray of refreshments, so he kept his eye on Tony as he approached the makeshift field.
“Professor Stark--Anthony!” Professor Rogers shouted, voice airy with disbelief and a note of fear. “Why are there two of you? What did you do?”
“Come on, Stevie, you have to let us help you,” Bucky implored from one side of the desk where Steve was
This time something happened immediately, a sizzling noise followed by a hum that lifted the hair on his arms, he shot a glance at Steve and Anthony and they were dashing across the hut as Tony lunged forward, grabbing the stone then hissing as the heat emanating from it burned his palms.
“Based on the data provided in the files provided by SHIELD, the helmet along will keep their powers at bay.”
From his vantage point he could see there was something about the metallic blue glow of the mechanics eyes that seemed...less than human now.
Loki has no wish to stand here any longer, he has seen to it that the alphas are alive and at least he can deliver that news. Part of him breaks when James reaches out to him. Loki steps back from the pleading hand, he doesn't deserve it not now. He can't let him any closer, never again... “I'm fine...I can not say the same for you ...” He says quietly and Barnes looks like he wants to brush off the fact that he looks like 100 miles of bad road.
This place had become not just a 2nd home to him but a real one. All this time his old thoughts had rendered his new home useless because it was stuck on the old one. This wasn't Asgard, and James was nothing like Odin. There was no one here to force his miserable failures in his face...but him. That's exactly what he had been doing this whole time. Allowing himself to become so focused on the negative he had forgotten all of the good things.
That morning he had done so well, so well keeping his mind empty. Faithfully going through the motions; taking the elevator up to the top floor; walking through the main living area and bypassing the kitchen. He didn’t turn his head to the photos on the hall walls, he didn’t shiver when he walking into their bedroom.
Tony thought the show of force was incredibly hot and ended up praising Steve in his own special way for the remainder of that evening.
“You’re not perfect Captain, close... I mean I always thought so. But not completely perfect.” A voice called from the now open doorway.
Stark chuckled, “Not great, I have a little problem, well it might not be a problem yet but the ETA on shit hitting the fan  is a little sooner than I’d like.”
“Like I said...I did what I had to do.” Tony hedges, stepping over to the bar and filling up a glass. Now that he can focus on it he can smell the sickly sour of distress all over the tower. Steve must be ripe with it now and Natasha, as kind as she is, wouldn't be enough. He needed to be with his omega.
“Play gently Jor.” Loki reminded as he kept a watchful eye on his little pup swimming over and under the looping sea serpent. Anthony had taken some time to start swimming on his own, unlike most mer who could trail after their mothers the day they were born. The baby had been smaller than most and it took him a while to catch up.
“I work with what I’m best at.” Tony shrugged and grinned when he saw the slow smile Steve was fighting down. “Exactly, now come on Bruce bun and the English muffin are waiting.”
“I am well, I saw Logan off a moment ago, and he and the team have some business to attend to. It looks like I will be taking over History class for today.”
Yet, after she was gone… it didn’t seem so ugly. In fact, there had been many a night after his parents passed that found Tony with this blanket draped around his shoulders. Savoring the faint smell of Channel No.5 that still permeated the woven threads.
Admittedly, Steve had taken some time to get used to the 'new' Tony. As might be expected Tony had made many strides recently in managing the ill effects of Extremis on his personality and mind. The couple was less anxious about Stark one day going off the deep end and becoming a super villain.
Coulson considered that and narrowed his eyes. "Ergo we both pissed the bed on this one. Then again there is no time like the present so... Loki, I forgive you."
Tony has worried. Really and truly freaked out beyond words because wow… he had feelings. Of course Tony knew he had feelings he just didn’t think about them as much as he should, which is basically at all. Because if he sat with them too long things got deep and uncomfortable. Sure he’d been able to open up to Steve, and there in lay the answer to that question that he hadn’t even known how to ask his entire life.
Seeing Barnes had hammered that into his head. That poor son of a bitch might lose the only thing he had left and here Tony was- handed the proverbial golden ticket. He had a second chance at life and yet here he sat, pissing it away with what ifs and would haves. Sure, maybe he'd done one hell of a job at scrambling up is own brain in the process, but he'd fought back against worse hadn't he? Giving up right now wasn't an option, as long as he had what little was left of his own self then he hadn't lost. Moreover, there was a whole tower full of people ready to stand behind him to fight his way back to the better part of himself. All of these people were counting on him and Stark would be damned if he failed them.
Every alarm in Starks head was screaming to leave this alone. They were treading to deeply into waters that he had never been much use at.
Sarah was a kindly woman with a good heart;giving to those in need and helping whom ever asked it of her. With blue eyes that rivaled the very heavens above and a heart of gold. Sarah turned the eye of more than a few of the young men in her village. Her family had high hopes for their lovely young daughter. She was petite and fair, and with no surprise drew the affections of the son of a duke.
An hour later, 'damn it Tony', Steve was showering while his alpha snored, at least now he'd be able to dress in peace.
Soon conversation turned away from mission files and reports and to Natasha and Peppers pup on the way any day now. The red haired alpha beamed with pride and James felt happy for her. He remembers Natasha from his brief time in the red room. The mental representation was bleary and he doesn't ask her if she remembers him. She does, he knows it by the way she never questions is command on the field. How training with her is like second nature even after all these years.
The Ai responded immediately, “Doctor Banner is on his way. Shall I have emergency services on stand by should Dr. Cho be detained?”
Letting his mind wander a bit as he pushed through the crowded isles, he was sure this was all just a ploy. Maybe he knew that when he got in the car and pulled away from the house but was too much of a coward to say so.
“Just think about it! With that kind of speed! Think how fast would the gathering season go! The hunting parties could be in the North Sea and back in no time, not to mention the fact that sharks are natural fish finders. I’m telling you this has so much potential, man I need to get back to the shop and start laying out schematics and …”
Steve sighed and ran a hand back through his sweat-slicked hair, “That’s really not necessary Jarvis.”
Miles away, beneath the foaming waves and blue depths, another vow is made…one that is not as pure, one based in lust and wrapped up in lies.
As for the rest of the team, the general feeling was that as long as Steve was health and happy it didn’t matter. In-fact, no one had even said a word about it, when Thor came to visit everyone he was a little confused by it but generally seemed unphased.
Steve was still concentrated on dinner and expected may be a subversive snort or at the boldest a muttered word from his boy. What he didn't expect was a choked sob
Tony curled up next to his omega, as much as his ribs protested. “I promise, no doom bots, slime monsters, or tentacle beasts can drag me away. You, me and the sea monkeys.”
Kurt rises quietly from his chair and sits on the arm of the soft chair that Loki occupied. “Have you told your Alpha that you feel this way?”
Something about seeing the baby faced inventor with pouty youthful lips, clearly flirting with the news reporter - made Steve feel strange. He snapped the laptop shut and decided a cold shower might be best.
Loki fell back staring up at the ceiling but not seeing. This was a nightmare, a terrible nightmare. He was going to wake up from this and he would be fine. His baby girl would be safe inside of him, the little flutters of her movements like butterfly wings in the spring. This was a nightmare. This was a nightmare.
Although, it was hard for the alpha not to pull his shoulders back a bit when the omega let out a grateful and happy little moan with the first bite of pizza. Tony tried his best to ignore what that sound did to him on a damn near cellular level.
“Yeah, you're right.” Steve said looking over to the sound of scampering feet as the twins chased Butter into the room.
Tony had his Rock/Metal - AC/CD, DIO, and Black Sabbath. Natasha had a lot of Gothic Type tunes- Birthday Massacre, Cradle of Filth, Rob Zombie. Hawkeye’s play list was…well it was more reason to make fun of Barton with this 80’s-90’s classic rock Mix - Robert Palmer, Green Day, Prodigy.
Pulling Tony into the jets private bathroom, Steve tugged off his own gloves and set to working open the zipper on Tony under suit. He knew Tony needed to feel the air, and hopefully that would stave off the panic.  “Tony, darling… look at me ok?” Steve spoke softly as he set the billionaire down on the closed toilet lid. Fingers working to free the slighter man from the tight fitting neoprene.
“So...” Loki felt pressure climbing up his chest into his throat. “So it is my fault, my mind... that's what you're saying.”
So armed with tea, a stack of adult coloring books, and pens – Bruce Banner made an attempt at soothing the other Mr. Barnes.
And there he was, Phillip Coulson stepping off the elevator and greeting the group of enthusiastic children. This wasn't even the first time Loki had seen the man so he wasn't sure why his mouth went dry and skin shivered. Yet seeing the agent around the tower in his civilian clothes or playing with the children was different.
“No you can’t Tones because you’re not the only one this is affecting. I know you miss him so why the hell are you avoiding him?”
“Phil’s right,” Pepper leaned closer  and Steve could help but lean into her shoulder. Her perfume was sweet and soft it reminded him of his mother. “There’s nothing wrong with what you did. I’ve seen Tony handle a one nightstand and that’s not what you are Steve. He cares about you, id even say that he loves you. Would it be alright if I talk to him? I know how he can get when he’s confronted and it might be better.”
Before Steve, before there was someone there who understood what it meant to not be able to just stand by and let things happen. Someone willing to stand by his side when the proverbial shit hit the fan. The Captain who did not ask him to sit back in safety while the world burned around them.
“What are you doing you heathen? What is it- like six am? Right now? Who is awake at this godforsaken hour...super villains that's who. Steeeeeb don't do to the dark-side.” Tony groaned as the bed shifted and his wonderfully warm human pillow abandoned him. Anyone who ever said that omegas were all kind and courteous, obviously never met Steve Rogers on a scheduled. Some how his sweet handsome mate could magically transform into such a cruel slave driver.
“I won’t tell you again Nicholas.” Tony slipped on the gauntlet. This wasn’t a threat it was a promise.
Steve knew this might be too soon, maybe he should wait and watch Tony a little more. Be sure of who he was sharing a home with...but then, then there was that smile against his skin and those hands sneaking under the back of his shirt just like they always do. Damn his weakness but he wanted this back so badly that it hurt. Maybe this wasn't the time for strategies when Tony needed him so much right now. When he needed his alpha just as badly. “Jarvis, will you send the kids up to Clint's floor for the night please?”
Loki glowered and snatched his son by the ear. “Sharks? Really? I had to hear from a guard that my son and his friends were out tempting brutish creatures that could very well kill or maim any one of them. Do you think these games gain you favor in the court? That the girls will coo over your antics and shows of courage?”
For the fallen noble his first bite was...well it didn't hit him right away. It was like a slowly increasing blaze that coated the inside of his mouth and the back of his throat. Loki wasn't going to let Bruce know of course not. He had a reputation to uphold here! Taking a few experimental sips of water seemed to sooth for a moment before the burn returned. He thought perhaps if he just ate quickly then it would all be over and he could excuse himself to the lavatory and freeze his own tongue. That sounded like it might help. but no Bruce just kept right on talking and so he had to respond in kind lest the man read his suffering.
“If you drive us, you can have the mask. Pawn it. Keep it. Either way, you got yourself some high-tech, high-value property.”
“Mine,” Steve hissed. “God, Tony, you’re mine.” Steve’s body curled in even more over him, his words melting into inarticulate groans. The hand gripped his hair tighter and then suddenly Tony’s mouth was abandoned as Steve pulled out. Steve collapsed against the wall and his bracing hand dropped to his cock just in time as he groaned and came all over Tony’s face.
“Buckle up, Cap.” Tony straightened his sunglasses and pasted on a brilliant smile. “Time to meet the talent.”
through a teasing smile. “Not all omegas have the flair for it. I mean, I do, but not about this. This was--” Tony pulled open the edges of his robe to soak a tan into his skin. The long span of his neck led to half his shoulder peeking out, below that for all the world to see were his dusty brown nipples. “Gosh, you’re an open book aren’t you. Even if you weren’t, your scent blockers aren’t nearly strong enough.”
Tony shook his head. “The ring. Steve had told me to take it to Strange, but I had to poke it. I always have to poke. I was just looking at it and it came to life almost--You said it had a piece of a soul?”
He clenched his eyes closed and wished he could disappear and reappear back on earth. Behind him, a stunned Tony remained frozen, at least for a second, and then he started to laugh. Steve tensed but didn’t move. Tony could do whatever he wanted. Far be it for Steve to dictate how he reacted to Steve's uncomfortable attraction to his presence.
“My sentiments.” The small smile that flickered across Tony’s bruised face felt like a victory, even as short lived as it was, flickering into a wince when Tony shifted again.
The words were ominous and soured Tony's familiar, desperate scent over the edge and into pure fear. Steve growled under his breath. They were at the end of the hall and neither of them noticed the sound, but then they both breathed in and Steve’s anger must have carried in the air.
There was a beat of silence before another shout, this time by a group of people, but it seemed to originate from up in the sky, not on ground level. Before Tony could clear his mind of the confusion three people on honest to god broomsticks shot across the sky. He blinked once, twice, then reached behind his head to feel for any cracks in his skull. The broomsticks came back, this time with one rider holding a ball. He threw it out of Tony’s line of sight and there was another boom of shouting. Then a man, blond hair poking out from under his helmet, flew fast from behind them, blowing a whistle from atop a broomstick of his own.
Unconcerned, Tony hummed, content to sit on this blanket in the sand, under the warmth of Steve’s arms, long after the storm rolled in.
Steve pushed open the doors to the large cafeteria where their company had ordered-in Korean catering, and it was like the group of suave young men transformed into absolute children, darting to the buffet line screaming, “japchae!”, “kimchi jjigae!” “gimbap!” Their leader stayed behind, nodding towards Steve and Tony. “We really do appreciate you two doing this for us. The threatening letter they’d sent was one thing, but when the shapeshifters showed up in our studios well--” he broke off looking over his group, gaze hardened from the memory. “It’s scary to think that all they need to do is get a look at one of us in the eye, and that’s it, they’d be able to take over our bodies, our lives.”
Steve realized that was exactly what they had. Months of sharing the sleep capsule, sharing each other's space, learning and tasting and touching--for some reason this second realization quickened Steve’s desire, suddenly all he wanted was more. He pulled at Tony’s pants, sliding his hands under the elastic waste to squeeze at the plump cheeks he had to admit to himself he’d checked out plenty of times before, only now could he name the snuck away glances, the flutter in his chest when he’d see Tony in a pair of perfectly tailored pants, or tight workout pants.
“Of course not!” Steve shouted, the images of it all flooding Steve’s mind and it made his breath catch, his blood run hot, then boil over with the shame rooted in the flickering of arousal he felt, couldn’t help but feel at the fact that he too now knew what Tony’s slick smelt like: citrus and honey. Until Stane intervened and then Tony’s scent soured and wilted into something perverse and haunting. Arousal mixed with fear, distress.
Steve wanted to lunge across the room and gauge out the man’s eyes with his thumbs--it wasn’t something he’d ever done before but to feel the satisfying crunch under his fingers--Steve’s fingers twitched at the thought.
Steve barely slept during the week. He split his days at the hotel and his apartment, feeling the entire time that when he was at one place, he should be in the other. His scent made Tony wince, but being far away made Steve panic. The war battled within him every night when Tony turned drowsy - he should go, give him space. He should stay, keep him safe.
He let one hand squeeze, while the other slid in, tracing over Tony’s hole. Then, with one well aimed press, he pushed his undersuit-covered finger into Tony, just a minute breach, and thick spurts of come shot into Steve’s mouth so hard they hit the back of his throat.
The crashing of the ocean broke against the sand in front of them, the sunset they’d come out to watch had long since fallen over the horizon, just leaving the faint dusk light and the dancing of lightning. Tony knew they’d need to go inside soon, that the wind would bring the cloud to shore and with it the oncoming storm.
Steve slowed them, lowered to the first rooftop he could find. He tripped over the landing but managed to secure Tony onto the concrete. Relief wouldn’t come, not until he ripped the mask off and saw Tony breathing. But the only thing he found was Tony’s blank face and closed eyes.
Fear rushed blood into his ears, the thumping heartbeat blurring out anything else, anything other than the need to get to their hotel room.
With another shout, the man hung up the phone and turned to the omega. It was like all the anger from his phone call played on his face and transferred its focus onto the omega. He grabbed his arm, jolting him away from the window so he could face him, his other hand snapping over his throat. Steve stepped forward, but before he could say anything, the man dropped his hand and pivoted towards Steve. “Can I help you?” he sneered, clearly showing what type of help he was willing to offer in the curl of his upper lip.
“You are too. And don't interrupt me.” His eyes darkened when Steve snapped his jaw shut. “It makes sense. This body hasn’t been yours for very long.”
As soon as Stane had arrived at the hotel, he would have found Tony. It wasn’t hard to imagine him using his nose, just like Steve had done when he first went to the Tower. Steve had known Tony’s scent far less back then and still found him eventually.
They nodded, and Tony followed Steve into the hallway, waiting to hear the lock turn before pushing on the door to test its sturdy resistance then following the garland-lined hallway towards the source of the scream.
Chef Ana’s brow pinched, but she kept the bag, slid it into her apron pocket and patted it through the fabric as she took in Steve. “Yes,” she finally said. “He does. I’ll make sure my husband gets it. Edwin can pass it to him.”
Steve snorted. “I think that depends entirely on whether you kick in your sleep.” This whole scenario devolved into surreal because it seemed like he was actually about to sleep with Tony.
“You don’t have to explain to me. We do what we can, but it’s never enough. It’s like that demon finds new ways to make that boy's life miserable and,” she broke off with a heavy breath. “I’m glad you’re here now, Steve. You bring a light with you, no matter what face you wear.”
“Tony.” Steve’s heart raced at the feel of his thick cock pressing into his own pajama pants and bare stomach. It felt like hot, hard velvet, and Steve couldn’t help arching into it, adding to the pressure.
“Yeah. Okay.” Steve had no intention of letting some SHIELD tech stand in the way of them and freedom.
“That face,” Tony crowded into Steve’s space. “Anyone would be lucky to see you like this. Maybe I'll parade you around-” Tony's hand gripped his shoulder and lowered him to the rug “- on your knees. For everyone to see.”
He pressed the button for the penthouse. Chef Ana put the approval code into the employee elevator before her shift ended.
They followed him into the hut, and Tony staggered, momentarily stunned at how much bigger it appeared on the inside. Anthony seemed to sense his surprise and kicked him on the back of the calf to keep moving. “Remember you’re supposed to know about magic,” he hissed in Tony’s ear.
Steve froze, heartbeat speeding up and blood shooting against his ear drums. “Right,” he said stiffly. “Well...bye.”
He still hadn’t opened his eyes, but he could imagine Tony’s lifted eyebrow well enough. Of course he latched onto Steve’s final sentence. “If it’s not
“You’re the strongest person I’ve ever met,” Steve said because it was true, because here Tony was, fighting to keep himself upright and having the fortitude to try and send
The thin chain of balled metal ran between Steve's fingers. For decades it had been holding his dog tags around his neck. But ever since that first night Steve had handed Tony the flat metal tags, they’d been his--a remnant of Steve’s past brought to the future through Tony, turned into something beautiful now. As he’d sketched, he designed the chords of blue leather around the chain so delicate, yet enduring.
Outside the van, Bucky took a deep breath. Rows of gold, and Bucky knew what caught his eye about them. The color. It reminded him of Iron Man’s helmet catching in his periphery, Tony’s gold watch pulling his eye. The sunflowers reminded him of Tony.
But instead, Tony zipped him back up and slid into the spot next to Steve. He knew he looked dazed and Tony seemed amused by it. “What do you say, Steve?” Tony asked, his voice taking on that low edge.
“You’re a muggle.” The man’s tone bore no question, instead he crossed his arms and fixed Tony with a stare. “The
. Not about him, about us, about me.” His hands reached for Stane and he pushed him back hard. Stane keened backwards, tumbling down to the floor and hitting the side of his head with the corner of the toppled coffee table. The crack echoing around the hotel room.
The elevator doors chimed behind them and loud footsteps followed. “Please,” Tony begged, still to Steve. “Please leave. The stairs--” Tony pointed behind him and with security right behind him he had no other choice but to listen.
,” Tony sang, because none of this made any sort of sense, so why filter the song that fluttered through his mind.
Glorious, in the middle of the abandoned city street, helmet retracted to reveal his face. Then he smiled, victorious, and his gaze sought out someone--grin widening when he found Steve.
He gripped hard, feeling the strength of it under his skin, imagining Tony under its layers, unable to feel, wanting to feel; was he aching for Steve’s touch? Steve felt a rush of pleasure, wanted to rip at the armor, pull at its pieces until he could get to Tony. His hands scraped down Tony’s sides, and he gripped, hard. “You look so damn beautiful in this armor, Tony. Always have, even when I first saw you flying across the sky. But
With the distraction of the battle gone, it all came back to him in a rush and his focus shot to the sky where Iron Man had disappeared into a rip in space. The only thing he could hear was the rushing of his own heartbeat in his ears; it felt like time both froze and sped up, the only thing that existed was the rip in space, and the glaring lack of Iron Man. Steve yearned, wished, begged himself to think of an answer, a way to save him. It was like a physical force, a need to do something tingling in his veins, under his skin.
Tony’s lips parted, his tongue darting out of its own volition to sneak a taste, even as he gasped in desperate lungfuls of air. Their eyes met and held, Steve panting down from his orgasm, finding their breath again, together. Tony knew what he must look like, come dripping down his cheek, flushed, lips swollen, chest heaving.
Steve pulled back the denim to reveal a pair of tight, white briefs. "Oh." The camera clicked rapidly. "Your ass looks divine in those."
He regretted it immediately. Under the chlorine and the soft, sweet honey was the barest hint of orange citrus. Only this time, it didn’t contain any of the lingering fear from when he’d first scented it in the library. Tony continued talking around a smirk, like he was thoroughly enjoying Steve’s response to him, and Steve struggled to catch up.
“If this big guy wasn’t such a stickler for big diamonds and a snug fit, I would show you the ring I bought him! It’s a beaut. Sparkles like a thousand suns…and cost about as much as a thousand suns too.” Steve picked up on Tony’s concern and rapidly delivered a coy smile.
He was winning, clearly. There were two ways to the top of Meadows Point, and he was on the fastest route, in the fastest car. No fucking way had Rogers, on his puny motorcycle and on the slowest route, beaten him to the top.
Steve continue his way up, until he was able to grab one of the lower branches and bring himself to straddle it. The coconuts were right over his head, so he reached up and grabbed 4, dropping them to the ground 20 feet below him. The bounced around, but landed without breaking. Steve, on the other hand, made to get back into his shimmy position but his footing slipped, resulting in him sliding (and screaming) all 20 feet back down and landing with a thud and ‘oof’ on the forest floor.
The other Avengers smiled through the hole they had made towards Steve. Until they saw Steve’s expression and the still man within his arms. This made the group collectively move fast. Clint came down first, separating the two of them despite Steve’s objections. He pulled them apart and laid Tony down flat on his back to evaluate his condition.
Okay, so I think this is my quickest turn around for a chapter ever. Enjoy! Don't worry, Billie is back.
“I doubt it. I rarely get out of the house. Please excuse me, I need to go after my frie- my husband.” He tried to dodge but again was blocked by the men. They began walking, pushing Steve back. One of the men’s shirt sleeves raised over their wrist and Steve saw the sword tattoo painted over his massive wrist veins. He moved back a little easier then, preferring not to injure anyone in the crowd were these buffoons to try to attack him.
Steve felt himself angled approximately 45 degrees, chains pulling on his arms as the knife still stuck in his chest. He gasped as he tried to breathe with the metal lodged into his pecs.
Within five minutes an employee with a white jacket came into the room. Steve recognized him as the man who would investigate Tony for any permanent damage and seal any open wounds deeper than a half an inch. He would often come when Tony was having one of his restless sleeps. The genius wouldn’t even stir when the guy poured straight isopropyl alcohol into his wounds and sutured them.
“Well--” the man straightened, taking a step closer, eyes fixed to Tony’s hand “--there is magic, it exists....” he whispered the words like they were an afterthought, hand reaching out for the ring. “Where did you…?”
A hot flush spread up the back of Steve's neck, and he opened his mouth but no words came out. How was he supposed to explain that he'd been admiring Tony's body out of nothing but confusion and surprise without it sounding weird?
Anthony all but rolled his eyes. “Because you always have to be the hero? If it isn’t a death dive in the Quidditch World Cup, it’s--”
They’d kissed the day before and he hadn’t seen the man since. The ambient sounds of the park and the scratch of the pencil usually helped with his focus, but it seemed Tony broke through even his most reliable defenses. He remembered the pressure of his lips, his taste...then they had parted. Tony had pulled away first, pupils blown wide, and excused himself to a meeting with a twist of regret in his smile.
Steve slammed open the stairwell door and ran into the hallway. It only took two steps in before he was blasted with the sour scent of Tony’s fear. Then he heard the shouting.
“Sure,” Steve said, giving him a reassuring smile of his own. “I have to beat you one of these days.”
The hand ran down Steve’s leg, over the arch of his foot, and off the end of his toes. A satisfied little groan that sounded suspiciously like “mine” slipped out of Tony’s mouth, then Tony's footsteps padded softly out of the room.
Steve's scowl deepened. He reached out and rapped a knuckle on the clear bulb of Tony's helmet. Tony looked down for a moment, hands opening and closing, and then the glass slid back, revealing Tony's face. Steve felt a little of the tension slip out of his shoulders. "You looked like you were in a fish bowl."
“Time to relinquish control,” Tony added, one hand running down Bucky’s chest, the other up Steve’s calf. His fingers traced over Steve’s inner thigh then wrapped around his leaking cock. “Time for us to take care of you. Just like we know how.”
As soon as they appeared, the group froze. Then, all hell broke loose. The shifters must’ve tried their powers, realized they weren’t going to get very far, and decided to immediately reach for their concealed weapons. The two remaining victims tried to run from the scene but Cap blocked their way, told them to stay close--they needed to make sure they captured the right culprits.
Tony shifted, looked over his shoulder at Steve with a groan. His face crumpled in discomfort. “Hey,” he managed.
“Didn’t think you’d want this,” Tony whispered, almost as if to himself, as he let his hands resume their tantalizing explorations. His nail caught on the corner of Steve’s nipple, the other hand leaving his chest to run up his neck. Steve could barely focus.
It's lonely and it's cold when you feel like you don’t belong anywhere. Like waking up in that fake hospital room all over again, years in the future with nothing familiar and everyone he once knew gone.
Loki assured the other omega that he would take care of his eating habits, faking a laugh and slipping behind the safety of a closed door.
“Like she wasn’t scary enough before.” Sam shook his head and followed. Knowing he would follow these crazy people come hell or in this case - high water.
Tony nodded setting his briefcase down next to the former soldiers abandoned chair, “We wouldn’t want that, last time Capsicle woke up confused he broke a wall. Not that I can’t afford the repair, I would just rather not have to dust sheet rock off a senior citizen today.”
The shift of the bed was more than enough to wake his Alpha and Barton is up and reading his omegas lips as he dresses hastily before snatching up his hearing aids. He could already tell by the stiff line in the omegas shoulders that there could be an assemble for this one and with Tony and Steve benched and Thor off world it might be all hands on deck. The archer hoped this wasn’t priority one and maybe they’d just call in Barnes, Wilson, himself and Natasha. They didn’t like to leave the tower without at least one heavy hitter to protect the homestead. Bruce might not trust himself but they all knew the good doctor and his green alter ego would protect the packs pups with his life.
No one ever said dating a magical alien prince would be easy. Actually just thinking about that on a daily bases would make most people crazy. Thankfully, Bruce had a lot of crazy in his life anyway.
Barnes picked up his too light mate and carried him into the master bathroom. “Hey sweetheart, look at me. Loki?” Nothing. If he hadn't felt the ravenette's shallow breathing, he would have sworn he was dead. “Let’s get you cleaned up ok honey? Then maybe a little food in ya and I'll take care of you.”
That quick lunch never happened though; just as Steve was stepping out of the shower, when the call to assemble went off. He tossed his towel over the rack and was heading to the wardrobe to suit up, any discomfort forgotten in the flood of adrenaline.
So, Thor was under the impression Loki and Amora had been together, he would be wrong. Amora had often said she was ‘too pure to allow him to touch her until they would be wed’. Loki had respected her wishes, he respected anything she wanted because he was in no hurry to mate and sire a brood any more than she was to birth them.
It wasn’t that Steve did these things to cause himself trouble, he  just hadn’t felt hungry at all. Also Tony wasn’t there to eat with him, while he didn’t want to admit it - he missed the alpha and found his appetite lessen with out the other mans presence.
"It's my fault...ya can say it." Bucky looked down into his coffee as if the black bitter mixture held the answers to the universes most pressing questions. Right now, all it held was hours old mud the canteen was passing off as coffee. IT was about as satisfying as the guilt that sat in the pit of James Barnes stomach as they waited outside while the doctors looked Tony over.
Charles had been right all along. Not that Hank would be in any hurry to tell the man that. Loki knew how these kids felt because he felt it. To look in the mirror and hate yourself for being different. To look at your family and suddenly feel like a stranger. Mutant children often compared themselves to monsters. How often had Loki done the same?
Omegas and their primping, he sighed,   it was a wonder they made it anywhere on time. Loki had enough hair care products in their bathroom to stock a small salon.
“alright,  my turn.. Get.” Tony said from the doorway to the nursery. “Steve your practically sleeping on the floor in here. Go to bed, I think I can cover this for a while.”
Tony had been an enormous help keeping the two squirming little ones on each knee as Bruce helped Steve to get situated so that they could begin.
Natasha just rolled her shoulder at the time and looked back at the taped security cams. “It's quieter, if they get caught breaking in then they are no longer an issue. If they make it out of the facility, it’s just a matter of interception. The only tie would be them and not SHIELD. Theft with reasonable deniability.”
As it turned out, this wasn't just over dramatics. Loki told him about discovering his true parentage, about how his 'kind' was preceved on Asgard. How he fled the castle at first wanting nothing more than to burn the whole place to the ground but then. Well, the last bit didn't take a genius to figure out. Tony had a lot of self-control but even now his dick felt like he could drive a nail through concrete with the pheromones wafting of Loki.
Thor held the little one tenderly as the baby boy simpered in his arms. “All is well little pup, your father will tend to you and love you. I too vow to protect you. You are now a prince of Asgard.” He smiled softly and rubbed at the child’s flushed cheek. “Shhh, all is well.”
“I suppose Sir, since you asked so kindly… and uncharacteristically.” The AI returned with a slight air of a front. Considering Tony had been blocking his own AI for weeks now.
It was a quarter to five in the afternoon on a Thursday when Tony Stark realized his whole world was about to change. It occurred to him vaguely that his children’s Birthday would be just a week before his; this had to be the best present ever.
That's what she would say. Sarah thought her boy respect and to value the truth. She told him to always stand up, no matter how much the world knocks you down. No matter how much it hurts. No matter how difficult the road.
“You shouldn’t just trust what people tell you Stark, especially not now. Not after all that’s happened.” The Captain’s tone was icy and defensive.
"Daddy Look!" Peter came running up waving a drawing in one hand as Dum-E rolled behind the boy beeping with an out stretched and now padded claw. The helper bot had become an impromptu nanny for when Tony was working in the lab.
Tony sank back in the chair, “First off, I don’t even know if this is accurate which is why I’m asking you first. I want you to know Steve- weather its true or not I don’t care, it doesn’t change anything. So don’t think that I’m making some play here.”
As he headed out of the building, he noticed an elderly man in beige overcoat waiting in the courtyard beginning to approach him. Too old to be a reporter - but never can be too careful, Tony threw on his winning smile ready to have witty retorts on the tip of his tongue and mildly trying to recall any bad behavior he had in the last week. It was a Wednesday…he hadn’t left the lab much over the weekend or even the building for that matter, so then something he did on Friday.  God Fridays …who the hell keeps track of that. Pepper does…why didn’t she warn him! Damn it Potts!
Tony cringed at the old slang term, but that was where Steve came from and where all the anger was coming from. Tony had just opened up an old would and Steve wasn’t done.
Tony turned and threw his arms wide, showing off the spacesuit like it was haute couture. His grin tapered off when Steve couldn't manage anything but a scowl in return. "What's wrong?" Tony asked, his voice tinny and strange through the speaker on the suit.
Then there was a scream down the hall and the entire room tensed. Jungkook and Namjoon moved to stand, shoulders back and fists clenched to their sides, but the other members quickly pulled them back onto the sofas and gestured towards Tony and Steve. “No,” Jimin said in English. “Stay here. They go.”
Steve took a step closer to Tony, the suit rolled over Tony’s shoulders and he took a matching step towards Steve.
Steve had his lips pressed together, suppressing a smirk. His hand had dropped onto his thigh, and Tony watched it rub up and down, slip a bit against his inseam. Tony swallowed, met Steve’s eye again just long enough to see the blue dancing in the lights, before looking away, back to the screen. A half-formed answer fell from him, filling the silence, and he just barely managed to keep his voice even as the plug slipped over his prostate.
They were silent as they landed, the stone following them into the hut. He had Anthony lower it onto the desk, knew that he’d have to have Steve bleed on it soon. He only hesitated because this was his last chance, if this didn’t work...
“Of course not. So long as your curiosity doesn’t become home study. But then again.” Coulson surveyed his eyes and Steve tried not to shift under the scrutiny. “What would Captain America need with a disguise?”
“Good afternoon, Captain,” Coulson greeted in the doorway. His expression dropped into a frown when he took in the scene Steve made. “Problems?”
The man paused again, like he was waiting for something to happen and that’s when Tony found his tongue.
What felt like hours later, Tony leaned forward again to whisper against Steve’s mouth, his hands continuing to explore. “I watched you in the park for such a long time, the other day. You were so beautiful, sitting there drawing. I could watch those hands move all day.”
“Tony…” Steve broke off as he pushed in the kitchen doors. The mask was firmly on Tony’s face now and this new kitchen staff didn’t recognize Steve either, so they all turned to look suspiciously at them. That was until a man in the back by the sink took a big inhale and shot his eyes towards masked Tony, face pale like he
“I’m going to fuck you,” Steve growled, another finger entered and stretched. He bent over and tugged at the collar around Tony’s neck. When Steve spoke again, his breath puffed against Steve’s ear. “Full schedule today, have to call into couple mission debriefs, train with the spies, and I can’t even get out of bed without having you.” He slid in then, just the tip, and they both moaned in unison before Steve continued easing into him. “I want to fuck you all day. Know you’re here--waiting for me. Maybe,” Steve breathed, bottoming out. “Maybe tie you up pretty to the bed, slicked up and open for me.”
Steve groaned internally; it was barely an hour into the day and he was already on edge. There were a few agenda items that the mission crew member was supposed to do everyday. Between the two of them, they worked through testing the samples in different gravity levels, check on Jared, their pet axolotl--who was gathering information on the effects of outer space on axolotls--and completed a few wellness tests.
Steve’s eyes dropped to Tony’s lips. They were full and slightly chapped from biting, and Steve closed the space between them as his answer. He thought of the families at the park, felt a brief rise of panic at what used to be indecent behavior, before he let the kiss take over.
“--and it was crazy, brazen as all hell really. What can I expect from someone who goes around claiming to be a long dead American Hero?” Tony threw himself on the deck chair.
“I guess making an impressive exit is a genetic trait.” Tony laughed and watched Anthony fly a figure eight in the sky. When he looked back at Steve, his eyes were still on Anthony, admiring but also assessing. The expression reminded Tony so fiercely of his Steve that in that moment, he almost wanted to call this whole thing off and find the shield and get back to him right away. But then the admiring in Steve’s expression tightened into pining, before slipping behind a blank expression and focusing on Tony, and Tony felt like staying had been the right idea.
“It’s okay,” Tony cut him off. “You don’t have to tell me. I know some things are like, confidential, and the fact that you’re even here, and that we’re, you know,” he gestured his hand at Steve like that explained whatever he meant but Steve had no idea.
Tony’s hand clenched around the tags, metal digging into his palm, cock straining in his jeans. He was so eager, desperate, there was nothing else in that moment but Steve’s words, and Steve’s eyes, and hunger.
Tony moved without warning, standing from the bed and coming over towards Steve. He sat next to him on the sofa. Steve could hear him breathing through his mouth as he turned towards him.
A snowflake hit Tony’s cheek, then another. He looked so beautiful framed by the white and green landscape, bits of snowfall catching on his lashes. Steve couldn’t resist tossing a chocolate onto his chest, just to see his gaze flicker with surprise then morph into delight.
“Markets falling, industry still booming, I’m sure there’s not a whole lot that mainstream news outlets can tell you that you don’t already know about from briefings.” His eyes narrowed. “Well outside of finance and the latest commercial gadgets. Speaking of things SHIELD’s an expert on, we’re missing a nanomask and I’m doing a basic ask-and-hope mission to see if it turns up. Do you know anything about it?”
Tony caught his breath, eyes on Cap. The thought of their coffee date and how they linked arms flashed in his mind. When Steve finally turned back to him, whipping his helmet off, his hard gaze softened, and a yearning shot through Tony, brief but strong, to be back in Steve’s arms. “You all right?” Steve asked.
“Are you kidding me right now Tony,” Steve snapped, his last nerve had fizzled seconds ago. “This is four months, you seriously want to be stuck here. With me. For four months?”
“Not!” Tony came over to him, tugging at his arm until Steve budged from the spot, laughing. “Not what we’re here to see.”
at Steve. “None of that.” His hand lowered to twist at Bucky’s nipple, making him hiss and arch into Tony’s touch.
Tony held up his hand, thinking. “Something is about to click, I can sense--yes!” He reached into his pocket and pulled out the ring. “This belongs to you. Your world. It must! Magic? Concussion? Nope! Multiverse--!”
“Right,” Steve didn’t need anything else. What Tony wanted, Tony would get. “A hotel then. I know of one near my apartment. Outside of Manhattan. He won’t be able to find us. I won’t let him.” Steve kept his words purposely vague in case Stane had cameras in here too. “Can you walk?”
Steve nodded, pointing at the woman who had cut him off. “Exactly that. She started on the cleaning crew and left her wallet at home. I dropped her off but she needs it to get on the train.”
James shrugged, eyes trailing over Tony. “This would’ve been more likely to have given me a sugar rush, than put me under the table.” He placed the drink to the side and took off his shirt. Tony let himself stare back, it was one of the perks of this new….thing they’d started. That didn’t mean James hadn’t caught his gaze, though, or smirked at him from under it.
Tony nodded, and Steve, who was shaking his hand on their behalf, smiled. “Please, Steve and Tony are fine alternatives. We’re out of uniform, after all.”
Steve watched Tony's eyes widen, lips part with a mix of surprise and awe. And when he looked up at Steve, he was flush and eager, and Steve knew he had made the right choice.
“Steve, shut up.” And then Tony leaned in, closing the space between them with a soft press of his lips against Steve. He pulled back after a second and sat back letting out his breath. “Yes, you still stink to high heaven.” Tony shot him a smirk, the first he’d seen since they left the Tower that reached his eyes. “So it’s a good thing I still think you’re pretty.”
“Beautiful,” Tony whispered after they pulled apart, lying side by side on Steve’s living room rug. All he could do was nod in agreement.
He took a deep breath, trying to consider what to do next, and was hit with the familiar sour aroma. It was faint, but Steve would know that scent anywhere, it’d fixed itself into his sensory awareness right there during that moment on the sidewalk.
They were obviously well off. The bruises on Tony’s neck had matched the dark navy suit he’d been wearing. The alpha’s watch probably cost more than Steve's SHIELD-issued apartment.
. The praise shot straight to Steve’s core and he sucked in a slow breath, keeping his hands steady as he snapped the device back into one piece.
Instead he pulled his backpack around and unzipped it. He opened his sketchbook to the page he’d been using to recreate the day he met Tony. Carefully, he ripped the paper free and slid the book back into his bag. Then he pulled the burner phone out of his pocket. From the front of his backpack he pulled out a pen and left a message on the back of the paper.
Tony caught him looking. He knew because he could sense his gaze even behind the sunglasses. Could see Tony’s squint in his periphery; it was pinned on him, watching him watch the cuffs.
Steve closed his eyes and counted to three, waves of angry alpha breaking through his odor blockers. Tony had told him how Stane liked to parade him around these Board meetings. Use his presence and scent to distract or--he swallowed back against the bile crawling up his throat--
“Thank you,” Steve whispered. Every time he was there, he wondered at what sort of risk the building's inhabitants put themselves in for Tony. What it said about Tony and about the staff, that they’d willingly undergo the risk, just for these clandestine meetings.
Tony moaned at Steve’s touch and helped them both by pushing down the pants, at one point almost hitting his head but Steve managed to put his hand in the way just in time, so his knuckles hit the ceiling instead, his palm full of Tony’s soft hair. “Thanks,” Tony breathed through a smile, kicking the last of the pajamas off him.
Tony hummed, looking at him from the corner of his eye, a faint blush crossing his cheeks. “Maybe.” He pointed a finger in Steve’s face, wagging it. “If you’re good.” Steve tugged on Tony’s finger, making him laugh and grab Steve’s hand to pull him along. “Over here is the stuff my parents collected during my father’s involvement with the Manhattan Project.” There were plates of sheet metal, some wiring, none of it that looked like much to Steve but apparently had something to do with one of the most famous weapons projects of all time. Even though he had no idea what he was seeing, it carried with it an aura of importance, and Steve really wished he could focus on it but a part of him was still focused on trying to think of a way to tell Tony the truth. Tony was here, showing him private, intimate details of his family, and he still had no clue who Steve really was.
Today, Tony had woken to an empty bed, the smell of coffee barely hinting in the air. It was one of the days Steve had to take Harley to his morning robotics lab, at an ungodly hour before his already early school day started. Their home might have been empty, but there was a text message waiting for Tony on his phone from Steve.
Tony nodded, walking through the doorway, a gust of frigid December air hitting him in the face. The cold weather didn’t seem to matter to the fans that had been waiting outside since the early morning hours the night
Tony’s whole body lit up like someone had flipped his circuit switch. His grip against the podium tightened, the only outward sign that he’d even noticed Steve at all. But Tony knew Steve was well aware of the effect he had him, even as he slid in the front row, close enough to the stage that Tony could see him in the dark theater, the outpouring of stage lights glinting off his smile. It was bright, but nothing out of the ordinary, not a flicker of deviousness or mischief. Not a hint for Tony to follow, of what he might do next.
The thought followed him as he settled back behind his desk, the plug pressing into him as he sat back down, a jolt reminding him of Steve’s big hands as they wrapped around his hips. Tony took a deep breath, trying to shake the thoughts of Steve and the way he could manhandle him, as he pulled up his inbox and began answering Pepper’s latest messages.
And now he clearly trusted Steve. Steve was more than trustworthy, but that didn’t change the fact that things between them had progressed quickly.
“No need to worry.” Anthony waved away his concern with his non-wand holding hand. “Simple concealment charm.”
Steve pulled him close, looking happier than Tony had ever remembered seeing him before. “Feels like Christmas,” Steve said, pushing Tony against the door.
Tony eventually stepped out of the suit, but even without the helmet he barely spoke a word to Steve. They ate in silence, sat in silence, and watched the stars together in silence.
“I understood about three of those words but at least we don’t need to worry about someone asking why there are two of us.”
Steve tried to shake the focus while also continuing the conversation. “A man like Stane, seems like he would have a lot of enemies of his own.”
Above him, Tony went wild, hands scrabbling for purchase against the door and, when he couldn't find any, twisting into Steve’s hair. Steve was unrelenting; he needed to touch Tony. He wanted to take the man apart and build him up again, just like Tony had with his armor. He wanted to swallow him down then dress him up in his own come. His tongue twisted against the head of Tony’s cock, and Steve knew he wouldn’t last long.
“I want other things too,” Tony continued, and Steve’s focus left the man’s lips, moved over the bit of collarbone that peeked above his shirt, his long eyelashes that fluttered with every blink. But Tony wasn’t blinking now, instead he grabbed Steve’s chin, forced their gazes to meet head on. “I want to do so much with you. But for now, I’ll kiss you and touch you, whenever and wherever I want.”
“Good.” He looked towards Steve as they slid up against the wall. Around the corner was the chaos, injured lying on the ground, a half a dozen people standing over them.
The elevator came to a stop, the doors opening to a huge open floor. On one side there were shelves with rows of paper files, and on the other side, were larger artifacts. There were several whole rooms worth of furniture, half-finished projects, and Steve was pretty sure there was a tank in the furthest end of the floor but it was so far away, and so many other objects were between him and it that it was hard to tell.
“Whatever you decide,” Steve whispered. Tony was so close to him, he could feel the shared warmth their bodies created, he took a deep breath, letting their mixed scents calm him. “I don’t think he’ll let you go easily.”
“--Mr. Stark, as I was saying, if you wanted to discuss R&D..” the board member trailed off, obviously having been trying to get “Mr. Stark's” attention more than once.
Watching Stane’s eyes widen in surprise set off a surge of pride within Steve. As if in slow motion, the kick pushed out Stane’s chest and knocked him off his feet. He fell forward, face first into the coffee table. Stane groaned as the wood shook under his weight and toppled to the side, taking him with it. Tony jumped from the bed and took a step towards Steve, and Stane kicked his leg out, trying to trip him to the floor.
Steve reached for his own spork and gripped it hard, mind racing for a lie about why he’d been staring, because he couldn’t tell Tony that he’d been distracted by his mere presence. For one, it was embarrassing and two, Tony would never let Steve live it down. “I was just marveling at your ability to get any food into your mouth between all those words you were chewing on.”
But nothing happened, at least not for the next few minutes. Each minute felt like an hour, even though the whole seminar was only supposed to last that long. Maybe Steve had really come to watch, and Tony had been playing a game with himself, standing under the spotlight with sex toys in his pants, their owner watching like his presentation was the most interesting thing in the world to him. For some reason, the thought flushed him hot with embarrassment, and he was just starting to wonder what kind of pervert he was when both the plug and the ring sprang to life, vibrations on full blast. The man asking him a question over the screen didn’t even react to the squeak that slipped out of Tony’s throat. His gaze shot to Steve as he covered the noise with a cough followed by clearing his throat.
Steve had told him to take it straight to Strange; that just made Tony want to keep it and poke at it even more. When he told Steve as much, Tony watched him fight the urge to roll his eyes but he was unable to hold back the flicker of amusement at the corners of his mouth.
He was due at SHIELD and dressed in his tac suit, knowing Coulson would have a car waiting. It would take him to headquarters and he’d have a small window of time to achieve his goal.
When he pulled back, Tony's eyes were closed. He broke into a smile, eyes fluttering open. "Really?" he asked quietly.
They walked in and closed the door behind them before the group broke into a bombardment of questions, only half of which Tony understood. Steve began to explain to Namjoon about SHIELD arriving on the scene, and he then translated for the rest of the group--except...Tony did a quick head count. Two were missing. The same two that had arrived late.
The field of sunflowers spanned out in front of Bucky, seemingly endless. He’d pulled over along the side of the road, back resting against the ancient blue Volkswagen van. It matched the color the sky, and it wasn’t in Bucky’s nature to stop and smell the flowers, he never made it a habit to take in the small details of life. A part of him wondered why he was even out here now.
It wasn’t until the second act that Steve realized Tony hadn’t been entirely forthcoming about the toy. A cellist led the strings into the next aria, when a vibration sparked to life from within the plug. Steve gasped, and Tony didn’t even try to suppress a dark chuckle.
Steve flushed, both at imagining Tony as his own, and at the perceived shame that he was going over his head or behind his back to be here. “He wanted to come, but because--”
James’ hands tightened on his hips, thumbs tracing over his waistband, ducking under the hem of his shirt. He didn’t say anything, just held Clint’s eye.
A bullet whizzed by, very intentionally in front of his trajectory. Tony followed it back to its source because only one man on the ground today was that precise. Perched atop a skyscraper was James, leg up and sniper resting across it. Pure relief flooding Tony, stopping in his throat and breaking free as a sob. Between breaths he was halfway across the sky and flying straight into the man’s arms.
“They make supersoldier strength headphones now?” Coulson asked, clearly already knowing the answer.
“Trust me, I’m experiencing a similar surreal sensation. Is there a reason you’re not answering my question?”
It was too soon–they’d only shared their first kiss last week. And for them to be torn apart before even having a chance to–
Steve remembered it perfectly. It was a sunny day, the sky so blue and the sun so high that it bounced off the line of bruises around Tony’s neck. At the time, he wasn’t Tony to Steve, he was a nameless stranger, a mop of messy brown hair, eyes cast low but chin still fighting to inch higher. From across the street, the bruises appeared to be a collar but as he moved closer, the sour scent of distressed omega made Steve look more carefully.
Barnes made an affirmative noise from the back of his throat and gestured to the knife, still stabbed into the drywall. “You can take that one.”
The next morning he woke up early, long before the sun, and made his way to Stark Tower. The route was familiar but every time he walked it, he wore an unfamiliar face, not taking any chances when he had the nanomask available to him. As he approached the alleyway door, he knocked a practiced pattern and waited. After a minute, the door slid open to Chef Ana’s smiling face. “Steve, what a surprise.” She stepped back to let him in, her smile sliding from her face as she took in his expression. “I’m guessing this isn’t a happy visit.” She looked to the clock. “They’re upstairs in a Board meeting right now.”
It was Tony who yawned first. Steve’s focus flicked to it. They held out for another twenty minutes or so before it was inevitable. Steve yawned, unable to hold back his stretch. He looked over his shoulder towards the sleep capsule, and Tony caught his gaze. “Want to take the first shift?”
A wicked idea popped into his mind, and he reached around Tony’s ass, the tail of his chestplate still covering but there was room for Steve’s hand to slide under it, moving so that his fingers pressed the undersuit into his crack.
Tony smirked, stepping even closer to Steve and lowering his voice, because one challenging spark met another. “So we agree, you’re distracting.”
A rustle of fabric and Barnes emerged from the darkness, an amused smirk on his lips. “Only if you hand me the plum one.”
“Park Jimin,” Steve explained. “He’s one of the missing members. It must be a common enough occurrence for them to name it after him.”
Steve swallowed, suddenly feeling like he got caught doing something he wasn’t supposed to be doing, instead of watching a charity sporting event. Not knowing what to say, he managed a, “You looked good out there.”
“Nope.” Another flash, this one of Steve from behind as he turned to look at the screens. His back was, well, if it were anyone else Steve would be impressed.
Back in the limo, Tony’s words had sent a shiver down Steve’s spine. Now, surrounded by all these people, the memory alone sent a shock straight to his groin.
“Very good.” Then he pushed Steve back so his ass dragged along the seat and he saw stars. By the time he had recovered, Tony had his pants unbuttoned and was pulling out Steve’s swollen cock. The first drag of Tony’s tongue around the tip almost had Steve believing he’d be able to last a few minutes. But then Tony sucked him down long and hard, so that Steve hit the back of his throat. His hips jolted, knocking the plug against his prostate and then Tony swallowed. Steve was done for, hips raising into Tony’s hands, cock pulsing in his throat and Steve shivered as wave after wave of pleasure shot from his prostate to the tip of his cock.
Tony was somewhere in the room watching him. Watching him move it carefully from right to left to shake someone’s hand. Watching the flush creep up the back of his neck.
Tony walked over to a shelf, pulled down a piece of fabric and his shield, the one Howard had first showed him so long ago: lightweight but sturdy, made of the strongest metal unknown to man, was glinting in the light before him. Tony ran a finger along its edge before picking it up and hooking it over his arm, turning to place it between them. Steve swallowed at the sight of Tony holding his shield, itched to remember every detail so that he could recreate it later in his sketchbook.
“Well, then you’d probably like to know that you do it more often than I’d like, especially when I’m in the workshop focusing on--”
“Huh?” Tony managed, hips jerking forward under the onslaught of stimulation. Steve pushed him back onto the seat.
The armour moved like Tony, even when every inch of him was obscured. Steve followed him down the hallway, eyes latching onto the easy way the joints slid and the metal panels fit together. It really was a marvel of engineering. Steve was vaguely aware of the rest of the team peeling off towards the debrief, but he followed Iron Man all the way to the hangar bay,
The guy blew a hiss through his teeth. “Yeah, they’ve been cracking down on that lately.” Steve blessed his luck. They stepped back, letting him have an open path to the door.
“It’s your scent,” Tony explained. “Your alpha scent. The sweater is one thing but--I know you’re not him. But a part of me is--I started to associate that deep, pungent scent with….” He broke off, brow furrowing.
Tony spread one palm flat for a moment, covering the place where the arc reactor sat in his own chest, then slid his hand up until his fingers circled Steve’s neck. Steve swallowed hard at the twisting deep in his gut that Tony’s fingers awoke. He was hard, but he had no idea where Tony intended to take this. He was entirely in Tony’s hands, and those hands were bringing him somewhere he’d never been before. He still felt half asleep, and yet vibrantly awake at the same time. Every touch was multiplied tenfold, but his body happily stayed willing and still, no matter where Tony’s fingers alighted next.
There were no references of Tony in Stane’s documents, barely a mention of him in SHIELD’s files at all, though one bio Steve found had listed him as a potential asset. Steve wasn’t sure if that was good for Tony or not; Steve decided in that instant that he’d stand between the two if need be.
"This seems unnecessarily dangerous," Steve managed to get out. He couldn't stop his feet from tapping against the concrete floor. The rest of the crew and flight technicians were far enough away that they couldn't hear them, spared them no glance, but Steve couldn't help the need to look up and check, the heat that threatened his cheeks.
Tony barked out another laugh, which dissolved into giggles again when Steve started another round of raspberry kisses across his abdomen. “I didn’t–” Tony sucked in a breath “–think flowers required repayment.”
Tony moaned at the command, groping blindly on the nightstand. Even though he preferred Steve to put it on, to claim him and center him, Tony secured it around his own throat because Steve told him to. Steve reached a hand up to grip the collar around his neck, and Tony relaxed under the pressure of it all.
Tony held out his hands. Steve’s eyes danced as he slipped the cuffs around his wrists. Steve made sure a water glass, Tony’s phone, and his StarkPad were within arm’s reach before crouching back down next to Tony. His finger traced the collar, eyes heated, and Tony was distracted by the long expanse of naked skin, but also content to close his eyes when Steve told him too, stretching back into sleep.
“What happened?” Steve whispered when Tony was close. “Only, if you want to tell me, of course. Please, maybe I can help.”
Clint laughed, searching for the right pie before sliding it over to Barnes. “Natasha is going to kill us.”
Namjoon nodded. “Absolutely sure. We were in an airplane when the shapeshifters hit the studio. Us and five of our staff. We never saw a single person that was in the building at the time, due to a strict quarantine. I don’t think I’ve seen anyone other than the six of them for longer than a couple minutes. it's all been emails and rushed schedules, isolation.”
They had both removed their helmets, shoulders brushing as they walked back down the hall to relieve the K-pop stars from their hideout. Tony tried to think of some flirtation or smooth comment, but for the first time in a long while, his mind came up blank. Instead he knocked his hip into Steve’s and smiled back when Steve grinned at him. They kept their eyes locked for a moment longer than Tony normally would, wanting to see if Steve would pull away...or lean in closer, link their arms together or maybe even kiss him, right here in the middle of the hallway.
It was dark when he initially opened his eyes, but as time went on, he was starting to make out shapes beside and in front of him. The serum helped, but not much. A light to his right kept flickering but was not bright enough nor lighting long enough to make much of a difference.
Normally the armor-clad Alpha would be zipping along beside the plane on a clear day like this. However, Tony had not left his side for more than a few moments. On one hand, Steve found it endearing and comforting; on the other, it annoyed him that Tony was posturing in front of everyone.
Tony thought it over but something just didn’t feel right, “or something found him…” The visor to the helmet snapped in place and Tony rushed to the nearest elevator prying open the doors and flying up the empty shaft. The closer he got the more the niggling feeling of something horrible tumbled around in his brain.
The three leggy beauties in fitted yoga pants and high heels, Steve finally understood what Clint had been saying about the glory of women’s stretch pants and apparently they made them for me…or Loki was wearing some of Natasha’s who knew right now. The blonde stood completely flustered at the door not sure where to look or not look. Until he managed to stutter out an apology and run away.
Steve bit his bottom lip, they were going to…. “Fondue…” The omega whispered looking up at the low ceiling.
She twists the knob and finds the door opens easily, a few feet into the dark office and it looks in disrepair. An old desk and filing cabinets overflowing with yellowed paperwork. Broken glass litters the floor, both from windows and beer bottles. The impression that perhaps some teenagers are the culprits for any recent entry is magnified by crude graffiti on the walls.
“My boy knows good pancakes.” the billionaire commented, not surprised at all when Peter scooted his chair closer to him. “Blue berry for life” holding out a fist to be bumped by a smaller one.
This was not happening, this seriously want happening. How could I be so stupid… oh god what would my ma think!
Steve smiled sadly and rubbed Peter’s hair, “Sweetie why don’t you go see if Uncle Bruce and Aunt Natasha are still here, they might need your help.”
“God of mischief to wrangle an alpha, who would have thought that,” Bruce's added before gathering up the plates. “How is he by the way? The two of them are pretty tight lipped about their personal lives. I still feel bad about that whole....smashing thing.”
It was a demanding sort of kiss, one that steals your breath and leaves your hands reaching for anything to old onto. Steve’s hands settled on the slighter mans waist. Fingers curling around the denims belt loops when Tony pressed on in this mission of his.
Breakfast was semi quiet, more so than it usually was with Peter. That was another thing that made Tony worry. Another thing that was his fault. What if Peter had anxiety and it stunted his speech? What if his son just stopped talking one day? It wasn’t as if Tony knew how that sort of thing worked. His childhood hadn’t been the best but in retro-spect maybe, that was why he was so awful at being an adult. The last thing he ever wanted was for Peter to turn out as he had.
Stark pulled a face and spun around on his work-stool. “Pep come on that’s not true - I care about a lot of things! Also, this does affect me if you consider all the shit I have built for SHIELD in the last few years. If they‘re dirty and have been using my tech I think I‘m entitled to know about it. I have a strict – no psycho killers or world domination bound megalomaniac policy.”
Phil considered the soldiers words, they were thoughts he too had. He had seen the footage, hell Coulson had been on ground zero after one of Iron Mans raids on a Hydra complex. Stark was devolving into something less than human. The man was becoming a rabid animal. “Would you Captain? Could you stop him?”
Unfortunately, despite their joint efforts team was starting to get pushed back by the overwhelming forces.  Steve realized they needed to get this together; he didn’t like not having eyes on all of his team so he called out over the coms for them to regroup.
It was a normal day when Sam came back from his morning job on the docks and tossed the paper down on the table. “I found us a job.” he said gesturing to the paper.
“James, good to see you.” The older man offered his hand. “I thought I would stop by for a visit, is Loki free by any chance?”
Stark was quiet for a time before gently squeezing his omegas hand. “ The final goal maybe to try and remove as much of the engineered virus as we can safely. I won't bother trying to adequately explain all the Sciencey bits, just know I wouldn't do this unless I was sure. I don't plan on leaving you anytime soon.”
Heading back to the tower was at most a silent affair. Steve spoke every now and again to ask about the classes Loki was teaching and how he and Tony were considering speaking to Xavier about possibly; allowing Peter and Wendy go to elementary school there for safety reasons. Being the children of such recognizable figures could be dangerous for them. Loki commiserated in that, sharing that his own education had been well with in the walls of Asgard's palace for that very reason.
Barnes was up and moving almost instantly, “Jarvis, call Banner and Dr. Cho.” he knew Bruce wasn’t that kind of doctor but it would take Cho a while to get to the tower so his teammate was the best they had right now.
Peter’s little face scrunched up as he placed his flat palms on his papa’s belly. This whole thing sounded weird to him. “There’s a baby in there?”
There had been periods of time when Tony was growing up that Loki was truly terrified for the magnitude of feelings he had concerning the little pup. Even now that the mer was fully-grown and by the rights of Asgard - an adult. Loki still thought of the tiny pup that curled up beside him every night, blissfully unaware with his petite thumb tucked between cherub lips. Those days were long gone now, big wondering eyes now replaced by a breakneck spark for knowledge.
"oh? Such a acute change. Though I suppose, saving your entire species would earn me a modicum of peculiar fondness."
Sitting in compete silence, the pair watched the movie flicker across the screen. Tony would look over every now and then. Steve wasn’t really paying attention to the film, he looked someplace else entirely.
“I mean you no harm!” Steve said trying valiantly to appear as nonthreatening as possible. Not that it seemed to appeal to the girl. She shrieked in agony and struggled desperately to hold onto the failing mermale in her arms. “Please allow me to help you!”
When Bruce saw the Vengeful armor-standing sentry in the workshop, he nearly turned green and tore up those nice new chinos. Instead, he settled for waving his arms in a quazi threaten manner in his Angry-high school-counselor voice. “You know you killed two people last night! Dose that even bother you? If you want to use Jarvis to locate criminals and inform the authorities that’s one thing, Hell if you want to call Natasha and tell her, but this can’t go on Tony. You are not judge and jury!”
“Tell him to at least make it a sleeper…”  Steve replied as they made their way back to the bedroom.
Red Skull laughed, “It is so much more fun this way. Seeing your comrade kills you, or perhaps…you will kill him? I would love to see the famed Captain America with blood on his hands.”
Tony felt his heart swell at how precious it was. He glanced back at Steve who was dabbing at his eyes. This produced another thought to the alphas mind. One day Peter would be old enough to start seeing alphas, or really anyone he wanted. Tony wasn't going to be one of those parents that pushed their own likes on their children or shame them for their feelings. He would be supportive to whomever his children chose, that being stated, he was in no hurry for it to happen. If the mechanic had his way, he'd lock Peter in the tower until he was 40. If the mechanic had his way, he'd lock Peter in the tower until he was 40.
No one could help, this was Loki's penance. Even if he had been brainwashed by a mad titian he was still a monster, still guilty of so many sins. So much death...
Speaking of, “babe, you ok in there?” Tony tapped on the bathroom door, He had just returned to the penthouse to find it sans pups and a bathroom-sequestered omega. This was going to be a winning day for sure. Part of him quietly prompted the alpha to keep on walking, don't even ask. From this point on, there be dragons!  Alas, he was a glutton for punishment and so he knocked, of course he knocked.
"I am more than capable of selecting my own dish for the afternoon Bruce. I assure you that my taste buds are far heartier than any mortal." The ravenette said snapping open his menu.
“He respects you. He might not say it much, but he likes your spirit.” Thor smiled gently.“Did he look well?”
“The common floor also has three guest bedrooms and baths, just in case ya know.” Tony explained as he showed Steve around. You can stay in one of those or pick a private floor. The one just below the penthouse is completed; Pepper was just getting together some catalogs for furnishing.”
The brunnette smirked and tugged their bodies closer. “It says I've finally corrupted you after all these years. Somewhere a poster of Uncle Sam is weeping.” he said nipping playfully at the blondes ear.
Amora began to laugh, she looked up from the sleeping baby’s face, and her fingertips glowing with magic wear she held the boy. His skin turning to scales beneath the soft yellow blanket. “You are stupid aren’t you? I never said your life.”
“He will be treated; if he can not be healed then the Lady Eir will find a way to ease his anger. Even if his mind is lost he need not be a danger.”
Steve felt the stretching and pressure at first, it was uncomfortable but it didn’t hurt per say. It felt…right, then Tony met with a bit of resistance. They both knew what it was, the thin membrane that signified untouched territory.  Steve felt the alphas length retreat a fraction before pushing forward and tearing through. He gasped and dropped his head to the pillows. “Please. Please…”
“I’m sure your very proud of yourself.” I mutter, he’s still smiling. How can he be so smug right now.
“Stark.” There was warning in his tone, warning that even Nick didn’t believe. He couldn’t stop this man, not now. All he could do was fall back on the past and play on Stark’s emotions. “Is that really what Steve would have wanted, for you to go off and get yourself killed.”
“I’m not going anywhere with you.” Steve seethed as he made to walk past Natasha. The woman blocking him once again with a steady look that said she would drop him and he knew it. “..Tasha please...”
All because he had to risk his life to save someone else. That's the kind of guy Tony is, the kind of guy that Steve fell in love with. The kind of guy who pretended to be so self absorbed but deep down where it really mattered. Was one of the kindest, selfless and most generous men Steve had ever met.
Loki pulled away and stumbled, Bruce reached out again to catch him. “Look at me...what am I worth now? You would spend your life playing nursemaid to me, David?” Loki's voice was laced with pain as he spoke Bruce's middle name, he'd liked it so much from the moment he'd learned it. Bruce loved to hear him say it because other than his own mother... Loki was the only person alive who used it. There was something so beautiful and special about hearing it fall from his lips and now..now it sounded like a cry for mercy.
Ah, so they were equipment of a healing nature. Thor had become familiar with other such tools of Midgard, such as the ‘band-aid’ and the powerful capsule of healing ‘Excedrin’. Verily humans were puny and easily harmed creatures. However, they made up for their innate weakness with many methods of care.
Somewhere in that awkward limbo of past and present he began to look at the one person who seemed to understand so keenly what it was like to have your head shaken and stirred. To become something so twisted you can’t even recognize yourself, to feel like its to late to be anything but the beast you’ve been molded to be.
There was more to be said and yet, perhaps it was best unsaid. His father left alone to wring his hands and wonder where he’d gone wrong.
“Yeah I'm in the upstairs control office now, looks like one of the freezers is currently running. I'm thinking we go ahead, kill the power, and thaw them out. I'll meet you on the main floor service entrance. That's the only way in and out of the basement.”
They went back up to the penthouse and it felt like a wash of emotions, Steve tried to close his eyes but when he did he could see it. Erksine, Schmitt, the train, the plane…the ice….the helicarrier…the water.
“I need to go pick up Peter and Wendy.” Steve replied. As if fetching their pups at the ass-crack of dawn was just as natural, crucial, and breathing. God forbid Barnes might feed and water their mini-mes and have Rock of Ages drop them off all nap ready.
Stark entered the Lab walking past the workstations and various mechanics, walking steadily back to a door on the north wall. Placing his hand on a scanner open the room to reveal a small lounge with a bed, sofa, and mini bar. It was an escape for Tony, and in truth, he had made it as an emergency nesting room at first. It was a fanciful idea that if he ever had a mate it would be a safe small room in the depths of the tower that would serve well for an unexpected heat or if there was an issue in the penthouse. Alas these days the room was little more than a bachelor dorm, with its tiny attached bathroom and laundry area. Tony would use it when he was locked in the lab for days at a time.
Steve didn’t say anything but he did relax, he watched as Tony bandaged his hand. He could say he didn’t need it - the serum would handle it. However, the serum had more important things to tend to now so maybe he should just allow it.
James charged around the momentarily downed villain and hauled Tony to his feet. It wasn't easy dragging the mass of twisted metal but some how he managed to get them both behind cover.
“Unca Loki!!!!' Peter cheered running to the elevator as soon as Jarvis announced the pair’s arrival. Wendy wasn't far behind with her own happy little sequels.
It's worse too because I know  I did this to myself. My choices led me here and I know had to do it.
The next time Steve gets his hands on Strange...he's going to wring his neck with that touchy feely cape of his. This was all the sorcerer supreme's  fault, saying that Tony would be a so much better person if he could work though his childhood trauma. Did the Doctor ask Tony...no he didn't. Did he as Steve, of course not or else Steve would have told him what a colossally bad idea this was. Not to mention how reckless it was !
“The Sergeant is progressing well, Lady Eir was able to heal his mind in part and while some of the damage done can not be undone- she feels he is no longer a danger to himself or others.”
Barnes ran to the side of the ship and lowered chains to draw the little capsule back up to the deck. “I hope you idiots had fun down there it's all I can do to scarcely keep this tub staying on the surface!” he shouted over the side as the small subs top opened and Natasha appeared.
Bruce received the alert and hurried to grab the bag of emergency supplies Cho had left in his lab. He was the towers first to respond in the event of all medical emergencies. In some ways, Banner hated that the duty had fallen to him but in another way the ability to help rather than harm helped to bolster the man.
“What the hell is that? Bucky shouts. But his questions fall on deaf ears the light flare with high pitching sound then disappears – and with it – Steven Rogers and Stark's son.
“Trust me cap if I had a lecture plan I would have opened with it and forced you to sit through it and tinkle in that fancy ashtray they give you.” Tony said gesturing to the forgotten bedpan on the nightstand.
Phil moved around the compound getting his teams in place. “So this is a test run, see how her new toy stacks up against our best and brightest?”
It hurt; it hurt more than his shoulder when it ached in the winter, or every headache he endured after too long days training new recruits at the range. This was bone deep and it lacerated his soul with every benevolent word he overheard.
The snowmobiles close in opening fire as the team splits up to divide forces. Even with the months apart, they all work like a well-oiled machine. Directions flow over the coms as enemies are displaced one after another. Stark goes airborne and there’s no surprise when the familiar red and gold of the Mark 17 ‘heartbreaker’ with its blaring audio system.
The omega was torn from his own fears by the woman's softly accented voice. She was staring at him, what had she said....what the hell had she said!?
When the elevator opened, everyone held their breath. Tony stepped into the common room looking around skeptically. “Ok…so this is either the world’s most boring party or …” he paused noticing the papers in Rhodey’s hands. “Oh fuck me it’s an intervention. No thanks I don’t have a drinking problem, I swallow liquids just fine.”
