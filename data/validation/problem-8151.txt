“I love you,” Tony said, flashing a charming smile. “I love you a lot.”
“Oh save it,” Steve croaked. “You can’t say stuff like that. You gotta know that, Tony.”
Something in his head told him to run as fast as he could and escape back to the underground barracks. His body sensed something that Steve’s brain couldn’t and he knew better than to wait around for the pieces to connect.
Steve frowned, stepping forward to rest a hand on Tony’s arm. “I meant what I said earlier though, you don’t have to tell me.”
The waves hissed below and a sea breeze sent a chill down his spine.
With a slight movement of his hand, the camera feed moved to his peripheral, but allowed him to keep an eye on things as he made his way up to where Rhodey was undoubtedly pacing.
He should have come right back to the barracks. He should have walked in crying and gone to bed. No one would have said anything and they wouldn’t have mentioned it. It would be over and done with.
Steve didn’t know why he even entertained that daydream when he’d told himself over and over that he would never—not ever—get back together with Tony. Tony still hated Bucky, even if he was civil around him in front of others. Steve would not have a boyfriend who hated his best friend—Bucky was vulnerable enough as it was.
came the text from Tony, almost immediately
Tony let out a little snort, then patted Steve’s arm. “Go home,” he said, his voice strangled with emotion. “Make sure he takes good care of you.”
Army and Air Force did not get along.
“But his pain is fading, which is why we
“You take the dog, I’ll get the AK,” Blaine murmured, settling into the snow a little more. “We’ll go on your signal.”
His target spit into the sink and scurried from the bathroom, but he wasn’t worried.
Probably Thor’s wedding present.
Steve’s eyes narrowed. “Are you referring to our breakup or the secret I kept to protect you?”
The patio (it was actually a screened-in porch) had turned into what Bucky called “da Vinci’s workshop.” Paint tubes in various states of use were littered all over the floor. Sets of oil pastels were scattered among canvas scraps and pieces of wood frames. Half-finished paintings were stacked against the walls, and a few sketchbooks lay open on whatever surface space was available.
Steve knew it was true, but it didn’t ease his fears. He wasn’t sure when they would ever leave.
Something twinged in his chest, but it was an emotion Vision couldn’t yet categorize. He was still learning, and catalogued it away to reflect on later, once he’d learned more of this world.
The waitress looked at the spitball, and trailed her eyes back to him. Tony could see her imagining a trajectory.
Peter loosed an arm and beckoned Tony over. “Dad, come on. Family hug. We’re doing it. Get over here.”
“Is Daddy gonna remember me?” Peter asked.
“I’m here,” came a quiet reply.
“I will. Don’t wake me up.” She glanced between the two of them, a little smirk on her lips. “I mean it.”
Steve blinked, confused. “What are you talking about?”
“Pretty up here,” Steve said, leaning against the wooden guardrail.
AT 5:45 AM
Tony swallowed, glancing back up to the door. “Tell me what you said to him.”
“I think we should sit first,” Winona said carefully.
One date. A date wouldn’t get him fried. Tony had already been caught with a supermodel just a few weeks ago. Ben didn’t even know who he was.
Because it was so much better than the alternative. He thought about telling Bucky, but he couldn’t. He couldn’t handle his friends sharing the same disgust for him as Peter did.
A loud
“Peter,” Steve said sternly. “I would never come to your father’s wedding to hurt him in any way. Don’t you dare accuse me of that.”
“Sleepy?” Bucky asked, but his voice was rough.
It helped that he hadn’t been present at any Avengers functions since he’d adopted Morgan. He was consulted on a few things, but kept them to video chat while he was tinkering in the lab and Morgan was doing her own tinkering in her pack-n-play. Mainly, she was devising ways to sneak out of the pack-n-play to grab his legs and nearly give him a heart attack.
“Because I need it.”
“I know,” Tony sighed. “I’m pretty close to getting you there. Do you feel…I mean, is he gone?”
Steve shrugged. “You used to get riled sometimes when I took missions without consulting you first.”
“You know I can’t get infections, right?” Steve chuckled.
When Blaine removed his hand from his pack, there was a card between his fingers, perched there like a cigarette.
“I’m doing what’s right,” he croaked. “To keep you safe, Pe—“
Fluffernutter headed straight up the stairs to his bed with Lucy tagging along right at his heels. Charlie went straight for Jackson in the kitchen, his tail wagging furiously. Nikolai greeted Steve with a sniff and then headed to check out all of the inhabitants of the house one by one.
“I believe you said you were going to call Mr. Rogers, sir,” JARVIS oh-so-helpfully reminded him.
“No. No, Tony.” Steve closed his eyes, a fresh wave of hurt crashing straight into his chest.
But this little girl was Tony’s daughter.
Steve was a dreamboat myster—
“Fucking Thor,” Tony growled. He was seriously going to kill him, right after he kicked his ass out.
“Pops, c’mon,” Peter groaned, but Steve could hear the smile on his lips. “Okay, well I just wanted to make sure.”
He wondered what Tony thought about them.
“I’ll—uh, I’ll call off the New Years date thing,” Tony said dismissively.  “But anyway, you’re allowed to have more than one bowl of oatmeal Steve. God knows you don’t look that good by starving.”
Steve laughed. “Yeah, well, neither is staying close. But I’m gonna do it, because I love you. And I think you’ll do it too because as much as you don’t think it’s the same anymore, you love me too. But I get why you don’t want to say it to me, and I think that’s for the best.”
“Incorrect password.”
“Were you gonna kill yourself if we didn’t find you?” Bucky asked quietly.
“Excellent,” said Blaine. “While Cueball is extracting data, our objective is to find anything that will get us closer to Kim. If things go belly up, head for the trees in the southeast corner of the property, at the edge of the stone fence line.”
“Is she sleeping?”
Steve cocked a brow, but then his vision went dark for a moment. He felt his cheek slump against the log.
“You’ll do the right thing. You always do.”
“I loved you with everything I had,” Steve whispered. “It was never a choice if it ever came down to you or something else. It was always you. It still is, and I hate it.”
“Where the hell were you guys? Cueball and I got back from the range and couldn’t find you.”
“I will. See ya, Buck.”
“I think you look very daddish,” Steve agreed distractedly as he worked to tie his tie. Hosting a Christmas party had sounded like a great way to announce their engagement, but now that it was the evening of, Steve wasn’t so sure. A ridiculous amount of people were attending, and their spacious ballroom venue had already looked packed full when Steve had checked the live feed online (yes, they had a live feed for a Christmas party).
“Did you hear anything last night?” Tony asked in a groggy voice. “Like, any noises?”
“Come on,” he said, grabbing Blaine’s arm and yanking him forward. They had a lot of ground to cover.
Gold flashed in the sky.
Bucky cocked a brow. “And you’re telling me you wouldn’t’ve just gotten into your car and left me by the side of the road?”
He nodded once and dipped his head, nose prickling in warning as he thought about crying again. He clawed at his temples as the smell of burning paper began to waft around the room, tempted to call out and stop the burning, to save those last few words and keep them in his pocket where he kept Blaine’s letter, still stained with blood from when Steve had carried him home.
He buzzed into the outer door, briefly wondering if maybe Tony kept tabs on his entries and exits of the building. Those thoughts were the worst, the impossibly quick ones that were labeled desperate if he ever allowed himself to remember thinking them.
Emory was impressed with kill distances and PT scores. His life was war and always would be.
The light in Bucky’s house went off and a wet nose pressed into his palm. Nikolai nudged insistently at his thigh until Steve scratched him between the ears.
Steve frowned, taking a sip of his water. “Why?”
“So why haven’t you?” Tony muttered, wiping his eyes with his free hand.
Steve looked at him, blinking in surprise. “Uh, yeah, actually. But it wasn’t like I felt controlled all the time. I wanted to be with you and spend time with you. But you did like to know everything that was going on with me, and you really didn’t like when I wasn’t here.”
Tony let out a snort, something close to terror in his eyes. “I don’t know.” He swallowed hard. “Something terrible.”
Tony hadn’t even called to make an excuse about why the ‘Rogers’ was missing from Peter’s last name. Steve was pretty sure it had been legally changed.
Blaine laughed. “Things were easier in your war.  You always knew you were actually fighting the bad guys. Out here, we kill who they tell us to kill. And according to a lot of people out there, we’re the real enemy.” He stood up and dropped his needle onto the small table by Steve’s shoulder. “You can’t look at it like we’re doing good here, and that’s supposed to wash out what’s happening back home.  We’re killing people just because some politician says they’re supposed to be dead. Some men can’t take that, but those men aren’t here.”
“Actually—”
“Stop,” Bucky said firmly. “Whatever you’re thinking about saying, don’t.”
He choked on his own words, his brain finally catching up to his mouth.
“How old are you?” Steve asked abruptly.
“So you just flew here and showed up to the ceremony but bailed on the reception because you want to make him happy. Bullshit.”
“Uh, right.” He looked up at her. “It’s just lunch, you know.”
Peter snorted. “No. It’s that you had to keep making it worse after you filed for divorce. You had to make Dad miserable.”
“You weren’t supposed to bring a gift,” Pepper said, her voice a little tight. “You were supposed to do—“
Their waitress approached and gave a disapproving look to the spitball on the seat but didn’t say anything about it. “You boys ready t’cwal it a day?” she asked with an overly dramatic Jersey drawl.
“Steve, ever since the divorce, you’ve dealt with things differently,” Tony said.
Tony wasn’t lucky enough to have seen him.
“Yeah? Well your superiors might think differently when I pull all of your tech equipment.”
“Everything’s wonderful, Your Majesty.”
Tony just smiled at him, and Steve just smiled back.
Steve glanced at the sky to see if their ride was in sight. It wasn’t.
“Today is a day that’s gonna go down in every history book of every country on this earth. Many of you will die, many of you will make it through today and die tomorrow, but some of you will live. And all of you will fight.”
The ceremony started, and Steve quickly tuned out. Not having sunglasses made it hard to look up at the dazzling ocean and sand anyway. Or maybe he was just using that as an excuse not to have to watch his ex husband and his fiancé stare at each other like lovers did.
“Daddy’s gotta,” he soothed, dabbing her face one last time before he laid her down in her crib. He covered her in a blanket when she started to shiver, thought he wasn’t sure that was the move Steve would have made.
Steve had snapped the neck of a fifteen year-old German boy guarding an SS stronghold. A lot of kids got into the Army at that point in the war. Germany refused to accept defeat and instead kept trying to throw punches, disposing of men and boys like kindling to a fire.  Steve’s job was to get in and get out. No witnesses.
He returned to his side of the bed and climbed under the covers. Despite his reputation as a prude in the media, Steve had lived through the largest war in history. Filthy conditions, human beings dying of any cause imaginable, vicious cold, scorching heat. He’d been in brothels, scummy bars, and other places where sex in public was as common as talk of war. He’d seen the very worst of humanity, and the ways men and women came to terms with that.
“—‘s son isn’t even related to him.”
“We should clean up,” Steve said, moving his hand over Tony’s to still him. “You need to get some rest. And I need to check on what the Avengers are doing.”
I’m writing this now because by the time I’m actually going, I don’t think I’ll have use of my hands anymore, and because I know none of this will change by the time you read it.
They uncloaked and pocketed their masks and glasses as Blaine led the way down a corridor. Both of them knew the interior of the compound by heart—they had spent most of last night quizzing each other; memorizing corners, hidden nooks, and potential escape routes. They probably knew this facility better than the people working inside it.
“You’re allowed to tell me to fuck off, for starters,” Tony began. His index finger tapped lightly on the frame. “And I did mean to come down earlier, I just…”
No, each morning Tony had to swallow the pill that Steve Rogers probably didn’t love him anymore, and probably never would again. He was starting to get used to sleeping alone, to not thinking about Steve as obsessively as he had before.
Peter had his family now, and Steve had his place in the dark.
Steve led the charge, careening around fisherman and earlybirds as he made his way down the street at the center of town.
Steve moved his hand up to his chest, lacing his fingers with Tony’s. He wanted to kiss each knuckle, run his lips along the callouses Tony had built up from years working and inventing. But he was too tired, so he just gave Tony’s hand another squeeze.
“I can’t tell you,” Tony interrupted. “But that doesn’t mean I don’t want to.”
Harry looked utterly bewildered at the question.
“Uh-huh.” He tugged the brim of her hat down to cover her eyes.  She gave a little shriek of laughter and pushed it back up again, jumping to her feet.
“Are you speaking from experience?” Tony dared to ask, but there was no malice in his tone now.
Clint shrugged. “You’re just a little too high profile. And you don’t speak French. Or German.”
Steve shook his head with a tiny smile. “No thanks.”
All he had to do was think about how it would have gotten worse. How he wasn’t strong enough to fight off the dark thoughts that crept up in his anger.
“You’re a fucking asshole, you know that?” Maria was furious. For some reason Steve found it hilarious. She ticked just like Tony: as long as he passed off everything she said, she would get more and more angry.
Tony paused. In his peripheral he saw Steve popping a bottle of champagne with Tony, each trading a foamy sip before holding it up to a cheering crowd of friends.
Steve chewed his bottom lip. He still didn’t know what to think.
Boone headed off toward the door and Steve and Blaine grabbed their drinks and plates and headed toward the only vacant table in the mess hall. It was a worn wooden picnic table devoid of any carvings or graffiti. But a combat knife was stuck into one of the wood planks, glinting in the light and warning anyone in the vicinity to stay away.
“Well, I’m off to go embarrass myself at a bachelorette party,” Mary Jane said with a chuckle. She hugged him again. “Really, Mr. Rogers. Please visit sometime. Peter and I would really like to see you.”
“He doesn’t want to talk to me,” Peter said. “I think that’s pretty obvious.”
“Jesus.” Tony let out a sigh of his own. Clint was right. “I’m sorry, Steve. I really didn’t—”
Tony looked around, as though something may have appeared in the room he hadn’t noticed before. Steve waited, heart in his throat. Tony must have really thought he was an idiot to believe this was the way Tony’s room had always been, that nothing had changed, that there was no evidence of a woman sleeping here.
A fraction of a smile tugged at Tony’s lips.
They had to make it.
Steve kept an eye on their corners as they moved down the hallway, looking out for any signs that hostiles were nearby. Blaine moved and Steve turned to engage on instinct, reading Blaine well enough to know he was about to shoot.
Steve handed over the picture, jerking a little when Tony grabbed his elbow.
Gone were the hard lines of Tony’s modern style. The edge of his custom half circle couch had once been made to look like slate, but was now shaved and smooth with rounded edges and no corners. The glass coffee table had been replaced with one made of wood, and the raised floor had been coated in some kind of rubbery material that made it look the same at first, but was most certainly not the rock it had once been.
Their unit didn’t exist. Therefore, they didn’t exist as soldiers.
There wasn’t anything he could say to that, because as scorching as his words had been, Peter was right.
Steve nodded again, his eyes still closed. “Leave my place at 5:30. Beat rush hour.”
“But he’s my son. He’s still my little Petey, y’know?”
“Of course I did. I love you.”
Natasha’s face appeared in the opening of their shelter and she smiled slightly upon seeing them. Steve couldn’t read anything else in her eyes, but he was certain she was trying to put the pieces together.
“Will I be able to contact you at all?” Tony asked, trying not to address it. He’d always operated on the stupid thought that avoiding the problem was the best way to deal with it.
Great, now he was becoming a shitty operator too.
Steve took Tony’s hand and stood, carefully putting weight on his foot. It stung a little, but the nanoparticles quickly adjusted inside the wound. He started to follow Tony out, but paused in the doorway.
One Private started praying, clutching his rosary with shaking hands until the soldier behind him thumped him on the head and stuck out an egg sandwich.
The black water sloshed above the side, slicking the floor of the boat. The sides were too high for Steve to see anything but the monotone grey of the sky above. Two sailors already on the boat looked on, trading a cigarette and muttering to each other.  One had a face marred with pockmarks, and the other had a crooked nose. And funny eyebrows. Steve still remembered those bushy eyebrows, the way they furrowed and lifted. He saw the guy for maybe five minutes that day. Never saw him after.
Bucky had made the right decision not joining again.
Steve let out a long breath and scrubbed his face in his hands. He hated talking with Tony just as much as he craved it. Tony was impossible. Yet that only seemed to make him more attractive.
“Go away, Bucky,” he muttered, shrugging him off. “I said I want to go to sleep.”
“No, Pops, it’s not—“ Peter let out a huff. “You can come visit at the penthouse whenever you want. Dad said you could.”
Tony nodded once. There was a little pause, and he nodded again. “Right. Got through it.”
“Correct.”
“When do you go?” Tony asked. “Do you have everything ready?”
None of the Avengers had even offered to have him sit with them.
And then he was standing at a mirror, a razor in his hand, shaving cream on his face. Except it wasn’t his face, and he couldn’t move the new body he’d been given. He was present—possessing of this body, but unable to control it, no matter how hard he struggled.
Bucky shook his head with a little smile. “Stop it, Rogers.” He leaned back, folding his arms behind his head. “Got a little carried away ‘s all. But I do want that soup.”
. About the relationship that was ever so slowly becoming real again, but that Tony knew would ultimately shatter when a kid entered the mix. He’d seen the way Steve looked at the kids on the field trip: with gratitude that he didn’t have one. Steve was amazing with children, but Tony had very well seen today he didn’t want one of his own. But Steve wanted
Tony didn’t perk up right away. “You don’t have to. You’re allowed to say I’m being a total creep.”
Peter clawed a hand through his hair, an action he’d definitely picked up from Steve.
“Nothin’ to be nervous about,” Bucky said, so plainly that Tony’s spine tingled again.
His first instinct was to test the straps that secured him, which turned out to be a useless exercise. He was hopelessly tied down, with no way of moving whatsoever.
“No,” Tony shook his head, reaching out to gently grab Steve before he could bolt. He could see that look in his eyes that said he was definitely going to bolt. “Not no—I just—Steve, I’m not exactly sure what you’re asking here.”
Oh, his lawyers were going to be all over that.
What good would it do? What good would it do to talk to anyone? They couldn’t do anything. All it did was made other people upset. And it made him look weak and broken and so fucking selfish. He knew better. His mother raised him better. His father beat him better.
“He’s all I have,” Bucky snapped. “And if you keep fucking around with those text messages you’re going to ruin whatever shot you have at salvaging you two.”
“The kid again?” Tony tried.
Steve handed Tony the coffees in his hands without a word and stepped out of the car. Nikolai burst from the door as Jackson stepped out, looking a little worried.
The mangled scars crisscrossing Steve’s arms had faded to a cheerful pink, creating intricate sleeves of flesh tattoos not visible underneath his thick winter gear. Even with three pairs of wool socks, his feet were frozen as he picked his way through the snow, carefully stepping into the tracks that Blaine left behind.
“Good luck. We’ll see you on the other side. Guardian out.”
They found a gentle rhythm so that Steve could lazily explore all of Tony’s tastes without needing to open his eyes or lift his head much. Married kisses. Parenthood kisses. So tired but so full of love. Steve would never tire of the life they had created together, and even when Tony was gone longer than expected or too busy to spend much time with him, he knew Tony’s love would never fail. He knew whenever Tony did come home, he would make sure Steve knew how much he had missed him and how much he loathed that they had been apart.
Steve brushed his hands on his pants even though they weren’t wet, and cleared his throat. His backpack was still snug at his shoulders, but he didn’t trust anything else. Something was definitely wrong. People sat on benches (he’d never seen any benches in the subway stations that weren’t peeling) and—
Bruce smiled back looking a little shocked, then turned away again.
“Am I?” Steve asked, nudging the head of his cock against Tony again.
He couldn’t turn it down.
“Two threes,” Blaine said.
“C’mon, Steve,” Tony said with a shake of his head. “You left. You didn’t reach out. I gave you time, but I didn’t plan on it being this much time. You never said anything to me—what was I supposed to think?”
, which most likely meant he wasn’t.
Wanda considered his words for a moment, but didn’t seem satisfied.
God, he was grinning like an idiot. Steve didn’t even seem excited and he was acting like an idiot.
“We care,” Tony snapped.
It was just that simple.
Steve sniffed once, then made a little wheezing noise in the back of his throat as his mood took a nosedive straight into the dirt.  He was used goods now, a hollowed out man with too much baggage for someone going places with his life like Ben. If only he would have kept his mouth shut, or kept his damn pencil in his pocket.
Steve found himself repulsed by his husband in that moment.
“I didn’t exactly plan for you to be here, Pops.” Peter sighed, and Steve could just see him running a hand through his hair.
“I’m real happy you’re here,” Bucky murmured, giving Steve a nudge.
Despite initiating the cruel little exchange, Steve was still surprised to hear Tony so flippant about it. “So…like this, then.” He leaned in again, and this time Tony didn’t resist, tipping his head back just a little.
He grabbed a fistful of her hair and yanked her head up.
“That’s hardly necessary,” Tony grumbled, sitting up completely. “I’m fine. Little spaced out because I just woke up and I haven’t had a drink of water in a day and a half, but I’m fine.”
“What? Is this about what happened on that call? You know the Council is full of shit, Barton.”
Steve nodded and grabbed the blond boy by the collar. The dog sneered up at him even after death until Steve grabbed it by the scruff of its neck and its jaws went slack.
“You were four years old when your parents divorced. How do you think that affected you?”
Blaine flicked off the cabin lights and Steve’s vision turned green as the night vision kicked on.
“Any way you want to swing this in the media?” Steve asked after a moment. “Me leaving and everything. Might stir up some rumors.”
“Sir, given Captain Rogers’ aversion to any public displays of affection, your handholding last night was quite enough to indicate the rekindling of your relationship in the eyes of the world.”
A bullet zipped by his head and Steve’s nostrils flared as he pressed forward and down the hall.
Tony put on a smile. “Morning. I got you coffee.”
Steve supposed he did, though it made his chest tighten to acknowledge it, and he wasn’t sure that was a good thing right now. This was supposed to be a favor. His way to finally find some sort of redemption with Tony so that maybe they could be on good terms again. It wasn’t supposed to develop into something else, even if he wanted that.
Steve forced another laugh. “Oh yeah. For sure.” He licked his lips. Lying to Bucky was probably on his list of things he hated to do most. But it was necessary. “But I just wanted to let you know I was okay.”
“Is that why you’re three hours late for dinner?” Steve asked.
“Central Park,” Rhodey offered.
She hadn’t been a part of their lives for almost a quarter of a century.
Steve turned, smiling out of habit. Jackson Slade was rolling his eyes as he stepped away from the Lamborghini. Harry emerged from the other side, throwing Steve a wave.
It didn’t take much thinking. Tony would absolutely comfort the Steve from an alternate dimension. No hesitation. One look at a suffering Steve, and Tony would melt.
Steve sighed. “I mean, yeah. But when people aren’t visiting I’m down on my floor by myself, and no one asks me to do anything because they just assume I’m with you.”
Steve was already walking toward the door. He opened it and lifted a hand to gently ruffle Peter’s hair. “It’s okay, Peter,” he said softly. “I should have known you felt that way.”
Hurt welled in Steve’s chest. The divorce hadn’t caused this. He refused to believe that. Peter had adored him until…he didn’t know when it had stopped.
“Good boy,” Steve whispered, scratching Nikolai’s ribs. “Good boy.”
“Don’t see why,” Bucky muttered. “Pretty sure you couldn’t gain anything but muscle, Stevie.”
A dull, thudding beat vibrated the floor beneath Tony’s Salvatore Ferragamo’s, but the lyrics were muddled. It was nice background noise, and gave him a bit of distraction from the fact that his ex-boyfriend was sitting two couch cushions away, chatting with Rhodey like they were old pals.
Fatherhood had already started beating out his time in the lab. Steve smiled. That tiredness was unbelievably endearing.
He rested his cheek on Nikolai’s shoulder, stroking his sleek coat and burying his fingers in the warmth that was always trapped in the second layer of his thick fur.
Steve chuckled. “Well, after training, Tony and I went to this diner in Jersey.”
“You had coke in your Coke, you had it made.”
When Winona entered, she was dressed in pale blue. Her pumps clicked as she walked, and Tony noticed the way she picked her steps carefully. She must have been a model. Or maybe she still was. A little short for runway, but Tony was more than proof that height stopped no man. Or woman.
And Steve had given him so much to be careful of. He couldn’t help it. He couldn’t help that he was so self-conscious and uncomfortable whenever Tony—a not-single Tony—was around.
“Now Daddy and I just fight, but so did Grandpa and Grandma when I was your age. They yelled sometimes, like Daddy and me. But then …” Peter was asleep, so it was just practice, but it still hurt his heart to speak at all.
Once he was satisfied with his shave, Steve quickly dressed, forgoing the shower in order to make it to Manhattan on time. He still took the train when he could, and not very many people ever recognized him there. Captain America really wasn’t all that stand-out without a mask or uniform. And while Steve was willing to admit his jawline was a little sharper than most, this was New York. Models and movie stars walked among regular people. Nobody really took much notice anymore.
Steve had never done heroin before, but he imagined this was something like that. He felt the solution seep cold into his bloodstream, followed by a tingling sensation so fierce that the only word he could think to describe it was orgasmic.
“Friday, Steve’s vitals, please,” Tony murmured under his breath as he waved goodbye as the elevator doors closed on Clint.
Shafts of morning sunlight washed the room in a pleasant light and the sounds of songbirds drifted in from outside. The day had only just begun, and it looked like it was going to be a gorgeous day.
“Or I just had you convinced that was all I wanted,” Tony muttered.
He scurried over to Emory, keeping his head low as he peeked through a baseball-sized hole in the wall. He blinked slowly and his contacts’ HUD flicked to targeting mode. Scanning…scanning.
“Listen to me.” Tony reached over, folding his hand over Steve’s. Steve reluctantly met his eye. “Fighting is easy. It’s always easy to find something wrong. And he’ll probably do it a lot—God knows I did. And it’s not right, but it’s temporary.”
Of all of the things Steve Rogers ought to be prepared for, being thrown around in time still caught him off guard.
Winona did not seem pleased by his answer. She sat back in her chair just slightly, just enough that Tony could read the disappointment in all of her angles. “The longer you wait to tell him, the greater the chance of him finding out from some other source. I can’t guarantee that this will stay out of the public eye. My priority is getting you a child, not protecting Steve.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Hey,” he answered softly.
Steve smiled, crouching to finally pull off his boots. In a matter of seconds he was crawling into bed after Tony, carefully avoiding touching him despite the small size of the mattress.
He jerked slightly when Tony’s hand wrapped around his length and began to stroke him. Steve bit his lip, trying to regain clarity when his mind was quickly fogging with lust. Even though they’d just fucked last night—twice—and now once already this morning. And Tony had given him a blowjob in the shower, and a handjob from behind while he stood at the sink and tried to find a semblance of his morning routine. The serum was both a curse and a blessing in the bedroom. He could go all night (and had before), but it also meant any time Tony started touching him he couldn’t say no. Didn’t want to—and that was the worst part.
“Pretending, Steve,” Tony warned.
“Shut up,” Tony muttered, but his eyes were glued to the phone, set in a stare. He couldn’t tear his gaze away.
Steve reached over and ruffled his hair. “You can sleep if you want. I know you don’t get enough at night.”
No kissing. No lovers’ whispering or joking or cute teasing or neck kisses or swaying in each other’s arms. No ‘I love you’s or nose rubs or nuzzles or slow dancing with no music. No calling Peter ‘son’ or giving him special gifts on his birthday or Christmas. No talking about sex or rehashing dates or visits to Italy or talking about previous lovey dovey things.
Bucky didn’t say anything for a minute. Then: “That dude must’a been shitfaced.”
Silence.
Tears pricked at his eyes. “Peter,” he whispered.
Their window faced East, so sunrise would probably wake them before their alarms did, as there were no blinds, just sheer curtains that did little to shield them from prying eyes—If there hadn’t been so many ferns doing that for them.
Even if he knew it would be just to prove he could.
“Steve…” Tony said softly, reaching out.
And as Steve watched Tony explain how water that wasn’t name brand could have any number of harmful additives—additives that might as well be poison, Steve—he knew that this would be enough.
There were a few other texts: one from Sam, one from Bucky, a picture from Natasha presumably taken inside a fancy nightclub in an effort to get him to come along.
Steve sighed. “That’s not the question. I know the answer to that one.”
“Friday,” Tony croaked, smacking his watch to project a hologram screen. “Is this—”
Emory took the letter and walked over to his desk. “Want me to do it now?”
“What else happened?” Bucky probed with a nudge of his elbow.
“Since when does that concern you?” Bucky snapped.
Steve’s smile fell.
“Hey Kissum,” Emory said with a chuckle as he grabbed the dog by the collar and hauled it from the man. “Did you know they used to feed dogs a piece of the kill to get ‘em to wanna do it again?”
He’d discovered recently that she had quite the vocabulary, but wasn’t fond of using it. She kept her words to herself, and with her little frame and puffy cheeks no one thought it strange yet. They would, someday, but Tony knew they’d work through it. He still hadn’t gone digging about her past, but there were things he noticed. She trusted him now, but it would be a long time before she fully knew he wouldn’t leave her.
Emory shot the other man with the same pinpoint accuracy just as the dog latched onto the man’s gun arm.
Candice pulled out her phone and Steve noticed one of her albums was named “Peter’s Creations.” There were dozens of pictures of clay sculptures, rings, necklaces, and pottery. She tapped on a picture and held it up to him.
Morgan nodded against his neck. Tony turned his head, pressing a kiss to Morgan’s hair.
“I want you to answer one question, and I want you to answer it honestly.”
“Tony? Is everything okay?”
Pepper placed a foldout chair beside him and sat once Happy started greeting everyone.
“I designed it,” Bucky said. “I can do more than hold a gun, y’know.”
“I know,” Steve said almost indignantly, but he couldn’t deny the little bit of hurt that leaked out. Tony wanted him to stay before, even if he hadn’t said it. “But what if he doesn’t?”
Tony let out a little snort. “Whatever helps you sleep at night.”
“Tell me what you want, first,” Tony said, his voice verging on pleading.
Too late.
“—uck that, I wouldn’t let him anywhere near my child.”
“I’m not being shifty,” Steve muttered, scraping at his bowl.
“What the hell are they doin’ to you over there?” Bucky hissed with fear in his eyes.
With anyone else but Tony, it would have been taken as a scathing retort. But Tony just laughed and gave Jackson’s chest a pat. “I’ll take orange juice. What about you, Apples?”
“I know,” Steve soothed. “I know you didn’t mean to. That’s why I never minded. I saw that it really stressed you out when I didn’t tell you.”
Steve’s breath came out in a shudder, like he was going to sneeze. Then he clamped his mouth shut, nodded once, and hurried from the dining room like a child, straight into his bedroom.
Pearson stuck a disc to the door—the mute charge. The team flattened to the walls on either side of the door. Pearson gripped the charge remote. “Clear.”
No Peter for three months. Tony would get to see him every day.
“No, I threw it back at him, but he spit it first!”
“Hey,” Steve said again, clawing into Blaine’s kevlar. “’M talkin’ ‘t you, Captain.”
Steve’s nostrils flared and he considered ripping his arm from Blaine’s grasp, even if there would be a lot of blood. “I called my ex husband,” Steve snarled. “There. Don’t worry, I have no intention of doing that ever again.”
Honestly, it didn’t occur to him until that moment that maybe he should have tried calling Steve at some point before this. But phone calls were always a bit too personal to him (laughable considering his history with Steve) and there was something almost negative in the connotation. Calling someone to have a conversation had once been the only purpose, but now? If he didn’t call with something to say, some plan to be made, what was the point?
“Pepper says I look daddish in this sweater,” Tony said, picking some fluff from incredibly soft cashmere. “What do you think?”
But he had very nice eyes. And a nice smile. And his voice was…charming. Sometimes.
“Crying isn’t going to make me change my mind!” Peter called bitterly behind him, but his voice cracked.
His therapist said he shouldn’t compare himself to Jackson. She said it would only make his feelings worse.
Steve blinked, mouth dropping open slightly. “Um-I mean, yeah, sure, it’s your house. I’ll just—”
Tony said it so casually, as though Steve hadn’t been shaking every time they boarded a train, refusing to look out the window because he had been so scared of seeing corpses piled in the fields and machine guns poking from the rocky outcroppings.
“Just saying, you used to stay over here longer.”
“Daddy’s really coming this time?” Peter asked.
Steve might have punched him if there had been whiskey on Tony’s breath, but there wasn’t. “You said you were coming.”
Morgan turned her head away even further, smacking him with those sausage roll fingers.
The restaurant was far different than the regular tourist fare. They sat at a grand table, with five waiters and waitresses scurrying around to make sure the serving plates were never empty and glasses were always full. A massive chandelier hung above, and the room was decorated with white and gold accents—Peter and Mary Jane’s wedding colors.
He had about a thousand questions, but he still wasn’t certain that this was real. He hadn’t seen anyone he recognized, and nothing was making sense. But the last time he’d had a panic attack, it had ended in a debilitating overload of history lessons, isolation, and forced attendance at a boxing gym.
“Yes,” Tony grinned. “That too.”
“Shuddup, shuddup,” Steve groaned, moving to stand.
“Morgan,” Tony croaked from where he stood. She didn’t turn—she probably couldn’t hear him. Or maybe he hadn’t actually spoken at all. Morgan was talking with his ex-boyfriend, saying something while looking at the floor, grinding an invisible hole in the ground with her shiny black shoes. Steve adjusted her hat, but Tony saw the moment when it registered that if Morgan was here, her father must be too.
Finally, it seemed to dawn on Tony.
“She’s not going to be comfortable. It’s a fever, Tony.” Bruce let out a sigh. “Once she starts sweating—”
“Okay!”
“I don’t—I don’t—“ Steve was paralyzed, unable to stop listening.
“Didn’t think I’d ever hear you say I was good ever again,” Steve murmured, resting their foreheads together.
“Mm. Sleeping bag,” Tony muttered, moving over to his discarded backpack to drop the tablet inside. “Don’t wanna roll around in the sheets?”
Ben was a world-class horse pedigree analyst. It didn’t sound like a job that would get him such a nice suit and cologne, but Steve was quickly made aware that he just didn’t know jack squat about horseflesh. Racehorses, show jumpers, polo ponies—all of the successful sport horses in the world relied on carefully planned breedings and genetics. And Ben loved his job. He also liked writing letters and teaching fiction writing courses for kids in low-income households.
Over Steve’s shoulder he saw Morgan watching him, and her face brightened to a bubbly smile from where she rested on Thor’s hip. She waved with all her might and blew him a kiss the way he’d taught her to do for the camera (and he had about nine thousand photos to prove it). He blew her a kiss in return.
“I dunno,” Emory laughed. “Would it make him only have a taste for Russian?”
Bucky stepped back into the shadows, but Tony could still see light reflecting in his eyes, maybe a little more than usual. Tony turned to his car, checking one last time for dents before slipping into the driver’s seat.
Drinking coffee left him with a film on his teeth and tongue that he could tell made his breath smell horrendous. Even eating a protein bar tasted like smelling peanut butter while eating chalk.
A ring. Tony had a wedding band on his finger, and Steve had to assume that Steve had one too, though his left hand was around Tony, at his back. He swallowed hard, unsure of what to say, what to ask. He didn’t want to make Tony retell a story that was bound to cause him pain, but…was Peter here? How old was he in this universe? How had he come into Tony and Steve’s life here?
Steve moved up with Blaine to the bank, staying submerged as they moved closer to the two targets Pearson had highlighted on their HUDs.
“Would if make you feel better?” Steve asked, not yet removing his hand. “Because if it’d help you feel better, I really don’t mind. Seriously. I know my Tony would do it for your Steve if things were reversed.”
There was no end for him, he realized. This torture would continue for the rest of his impossibly long life, even after Tony was six feet under. To have earned that love only to lose it—only to have the one prize he valued most in the world ripped away from him was beyond what devastation could describe.
Steve didn’t have the thought to disguise his surprise as he looked up.  On the screen were a few pictures of Peter and Mary Jane, pictures Steve had never seen.
“Good to see you, too.”
“Then I want to get to the busi—”
He saw a tiger in the bumps and grooves of the stucco wall in front of him from where he rested his head on his pillow. Peter hated him. Not the kind of adolescent hatred that happened to some kids, but truly and wholeheartedly hated him. Children were supposed to always love their parents. When they knew nothing else, they knew a parent’s love.
Now he was standing in the middle of a charming New England boutique wondering what the hell he was going to buy for Tony and Jackson’s wedding.
Tony stared at his phone where it lay on the table. A cell phone was quickly becoming old technology, but—like any old man—Tony had trouble letting go of what he was used to. He was a pretty tech-savvy guy, but something about punching in the numbers by hand when he called someone felt like the only way to really reach them. And it let some of the terror fall away with the movement of his fingers instead of just saying something in a croaky voice and having JARVIS do it.
Steve put up a hand, a bit of a blunt action. “Jackson, please. We both know the mix-up was on my end for coming.
Steve’s dining room was entirely too small for five grown men to be sitting in, but he never had company, so he supposed it would have to do for the next few days.
A part of him wanted to call Steve right now, to try to inflict maybe a sliver of the pain Bucky had caused him. But something uncomfortable welled in his chest at the thought, and he told himself it was just because it would upset Steve.  Even on his worst day as a human being, Tony could never inflict that kind of pain, not knowingly.
A car door slammed somewhere far away.
New love meant Tony was growing.
Steve rolled his neck. “You aren’t supposed to get shot.”
“Steve,” Tony said his name carefully, watching the way Steve couldn’t stay still, the way his eyes were ringed pink and his pupils were dilated.
“God, I wondered where the hell they were,” Steve whispered.
Steve didn’t buy it. “Yeah? Prove it.”
Not-Tony frowned. He looked away for a moment, and brought a hand up to pinch the bridge of his nose. The way Tony always did when he was trying to remain calm but was immensely stressed. Or frustrated, as Steve was betting in this case.
Steve nodded curtly. He had ruined plenty already. “Tony. I’ll see you tomorrow.”
“Looks like Loki isn’t the only one with magical powers,” he said a bit too loudly, just so Steve could hear. Last thing he needed was a Captain America lecture.
“Why do you suddenly care about him?”, Rhodey asked me and I didn’t miss the threatening undertone in his sentence.
“I thought we could make some Pizza together, don’t you think? I bought everything and even got a recipe that didn’t sounded too difficult and J promised he would help so… we should give it a try, he?”
“You are too happy for a fucking Monday. We have school man, don’t grin like a fool, when we have school, ha, it rhymes!” Wade crossed his arms in front of his chest like a rapper. “Say what?” he sang as Peter started laughing.
“Hey scarface! How come you can still show your ugly face?” Ajax came marching up to their table, followed by his super-stupid goons, Norman and Angel.
"Wade and I should make ourselves ready for school and then eat your breakfast without complain and then you drifted of."
Clint agreed and turned back to eating his meal.
It was Sunday and the last week he was with his Papa, so he got to stay this week with his Dad.
Thor boomed and promptly they went back to hanging on each other’s mouths again.
"Steve we have no choice!" Tony tried to reason with him.
"Yes, there is something we can do, so please stand up now, we can't afford to waist more time as we already have."
“Steve, I know you are angry now, but let me explain, there was-“
"Oh come on, don't be such a party pooper, I would take really high safety measurements before testing the hoverboard I want to built."
He fucked up. He broke the promise he made to Tony and hurt him in every possible way, knowing he still loved Tony with all of his heart. He was just a coward, afraid of Tony pushing him away when he wanted to tell him he was sorry and wanted him back. Steve knew he made a mistake but it was too late now. Tony was angry with him and he has all rights to be angry with him.
Woooooh! Another chapter! XD
It’s his kind of protection, I think, it’s the only thing he really has and fuck… I am so totally in love with him.
(See the end of the chapter for
“That didn’t go as I planned” Dad said after they slumped down onto the couch in the living room.
(See the end of the chapter for
He huffed as he flew through the skyscrapers of New York occasionally hitting some Doombots with his Repulsor beams.
Although I thought I wouldn't be able to sleep again, with Steve's solid presence beside me, his arm around me making me feel protected and safe, I fell back to sleep rather quickly again.
"I..." Tony swallowed. "I am sorry. Oh god....", Tony started to sob, finally breaking down. Hot tears burned in his eyes. Slowly rolling down his cheeks.
“I don’t know. I just think we…”, I started but was interrupted by Natasha.
"Did Tony know, Peter?" Steve asked again after Peter didn't answer.
Peter and Wade got detention for two weeks because they convinced Mrs. Finch that they didn’t start the fight and that Ajax, Norman and Angel attacked first. What wasn’t entirely true but who cares.
Shit! Fuck! I doesn’t make sense.
“That’s not true Peter, he is just worried about you” Dad said softly and slowly came up to him.
I felt myself being lifted off of the ground and before I even realized it, my eyes fell shut and I faded away into darkness.
Wade followed him inside.
“I still hate school”, Wade answered sipping on his straw in his soda.
“Well let’s go to classes now.” Natasha nodded her head in the direction of the class rooms. “I have history now and I really don’t want to handle this stupid teachers lecture about how I should never get late to his class.” She rolled her eyes, but everyone agreed. Bruce, Pepper, Thor and me had physics now, so we waved good bye to our friends and went our way. “Tony, wait”, Steve called and I stopped mid tracks throwing him a questioning look, but Steve just smiled at me and kissed me warmly. For a moment I just melted into the kiss and then I heard the one of the others whistle and pulled away. Heat crawled up my face and I couldn’t upset anyone’s eyes. Why had Steve done this? I mean... to show them all so openly that we were together? They probably knew this, but... to show them This. I mean it’s me we are talking about here. Why would anyone proudly show their friends that they were in love with me? I swallowed thickly and could not meet anyone’s eyes.
When I finally turned my view away from him, it was only because Mr. Coulson, our history teacher, strode into the room.
she explained and then added
Well, anyways I hope you like this chapter. It's still the beginning and therefore it happens not so much but I am planning Tony angst for the next chapters so be aware! ;D
I know its been a long time but there was some stuff i needed to figure out and i really want to finish my storys here. So I hope you like the new chapter. Love you all :*
Fury glared at him as if he tried to set him on fire, but Tony just grinned wider and raised his eyebrows in challenge.
“No”, I mumbled and looked at the floor to hide my blush.
“You idiot!” Peter giggled as Wade slang his arms around Peter’s hips shoving him towards the classroom. “Come my boyfriend, lets wipe the smile from your face from our history teacher.” Wade opened the door for him and then they both settled down on their seats.
Steve nodded, while Peter yelled: "No!"
“She did.”
“Fuck yes!”
The footsteps grew more loudly and more loudly. I peaked a glance from under my covers, resting my eyes on the suddenly huge looking door. The door was black. It looked like a giant shadow, the door towards hell.
"In order for the plan to function we need all your friends and Tony..." She took a deep breath. "They need to know about your situation."
“Dude, you cheated!” Peter remarked sitting on Wade’s bed and reading an old Captain America comic.
"Did Tony know?" Steve asked, carefully calm.
“Just a moment,” he said and then they left.
Or via Instagram: natalie_peracha.
"I am flattered" Peter snickered and then they made their way towards the parking lot with a sinking feeling in their bodies that seemed to follow them already the whole day, since Tony told them to tell Steve about their relationship.
“Aha”, he mumbled and went back to his meal again.
Steve opened the door to his room just as I said: "Because even though Robert Downey jr. is my favorite actor and he does a hell of a good job in being an actor and the movie is really, really good too, it has actually not much to do with the original Sherlock Holmes."
“No, no uhm… I am fine and you?”
“You didn’t even like me!” I burst out and again, Steve got an ashamed look on his face.
A few minutes later, Thor, followed by Jane strode in, bellowing loudly : “Hello my beloved friends. I am deeply sorry, that my Lady Jane and I attend to this meeting at such a late time, but I promised her a date on our anniversary day!”
“I don’t understand how you can put up with all the shit Steve throws upon you!” Peter yelled angrily when they Tony and him both sat in the car, on their way back to the mansion.
“Yeah, you are right. I just… It feels so wrong to lie to my Dad. I mean I lied to Papa more often than not because he always forbids me all the cool stuff”, Peter laughed, “But I actually never really lied to Dad. Maybe when I tell him, he could convince the others. I mean he can’t be convinced by other people that we are bad, because he knows us and I am his son, so… what do you think?”
Bruce murmured next to me and I gave him a curious look before I went back to watching Tony.
Silence.

Somehow I ended up mentioning Tony as well.
Angel and Norman both glared angrily at Peter and Wade. Ajax stumbled on his feet again, growling furiously and soon afterwards all five of them were involved in a fight.
"Just, different" He shrugged and grinned throwing himself on Peters back.
“Yes, thank you,” Franklin said from beside the car. Maria was still hugging Mary Jane, who was still sobbing.
Except his life had always revolved around Tony, ever since they had defeated a hoard of aliens trying to destroy New York. His new life had almost always had Tony in it, either on the sidelines checking in with a text or two once in awhile, or the weeks they spent together poring over missions and projects until one day Steve finally just asked him out to dinner.
"Wade you idiot" Peter laughed and slapped him on his arm.
"Then what is your problem?", Tony wanted to know.
"So, what are the reasons for calling us at this early hour in such an urgent voice, Steve?" Thor asked with his booming voice, earning a harsh glare from Natasha, who calmly went on playing with her knives.
With a shocked expression Steve turned to Peter.
I hugged her back, for a moment I was just grateful that I could bury my head in her shoulders that no one could see my face. “Tones.” I heard Rhodeys soft voice and fina,my locked up again. Rhodey clapped softly on my shoulder, holding his hand there a little bit longer to give his brotherly comfort and smiled sadly at me. I swallowed thickly. This were too much emotions to be comfortable for me. But before I could bold anywhere Thor’s loud voice boomed through the whole hallway: “Anthony, my friend! Your presence was greatly missed!” He smiled brightly and when Pepper let go of me hit me on my back, that I nearly fell over. “Thanks bug guy.” I smiled. Then came Natasha, Clint, Bruce and the rest of the group and greeted me warmly. Before I came here I was afraid of their reactions. Surely what happened must have done its rounds, at least through the group. I awaited pity and disgust maybe and not sure that I could have handled it I had already planned out my escape route. But now I didn’t quiet know what to make of this. I knew Pepper, she always greeted me like this. But the others... either they really didn’t know it, or they where just nice enough to not mention it in front of me. I didn’t know... I really didn’t care too. I was just happy that I wouldn’t have to deal with their pity.
Why heart?
And chase them all away’
“Tony?”
He loved his Papa but he loved his Dad too and he wanted to go to him.
Bucky went over to Avengers tower and Steve to Shield HQ.
Besides… he somehow looked cute like this, hair still tousled from bed, but his eyes were already sparkling with excitement, his sweatshirt hanging from his lean but muscular form and his tanned skin glowing in the morning sun that was shining through the window.
„Jarvis, please safe my work and watch out that Dum-E doesn‘t do anything stupid while I‘m gone!“
"Don't be so shy Stevie Boy, no need to blush like a tomato", I laughed again and then stumbled on my feet to go into the bathroom. "If you want, you can visit me in the shower." I winked at him and laughed again as Steve groaned loudly and hid his face in his hands.
“Only if you promise, that we will find a solution about how we will get them back together”, Peter said.
I sighed into my pillows and pulled the bed sheets over my head.
“Thanks”, I said sarcastically.
“It’s fine, Peter. They don’t know that we are Deadpool and Spiderman. We just wait for what they say about us and when they see us as threats, then we will just stop for a little while until the whole situation settles down again.” Wade’s voice was soothing and calm and Peter could only think again, about what a wonderful boyfriend he has.
With that said she turned away and signaled that that was all she was going to say about Tony, what I really appreciated since it was quiet exhausting, so I dropped the topic as well.
“Shit”, he grumbled and stumbled out of the bed.
"Hello Mr. Rogers" Wade greeted Steve then.
Steve laughed heartedly as I remembered what happened last night and then he said: "That is not a nice good morning greeting Tony."
“Did you ever played “phase ten”?” he asked me with a loving tone and my heart stuttered.
”Everything alright?” Steve asked concerned.
“You heard me Tony. I am leaving and I am taking Peter with me. I am don with your stupid behavior. I am done with you.” With those words he turned around leaving Tony behind.
I spent my whole time in school to draw new blueprints for the hoverboard I wanted to built, a new AI, a sentinel coffeemaker and a game boy that actually could do holographs. After school Steve and I went to the comic book store, discussing about who was cooler, Iron Man or Captain America. Steve was for Captain America and I proudly stood for Iron Man.
“Nothing Steve, it was-“
“Morning Bucks”, Steve answered and walked over to him, throwing his arms around him and kissing him on the cheek.
Silence rang in the kitchen. Wade looking with big eyes between Peter and Tony.
His smile seemed to grow bigger with that and it just made this wonderful tingling feeling in my belly stronger.
"Please. Do it for me", Steve pleaded.
“Good, I guess?”, he answered, not looking up.
“Really? As you cared about me when we broke up, you broke your promise and left me alone?” Tony interrupted Steve tiredly.
His Dad whirled around, nearly dropping his glass of water.
So it’s been a long time since I last updated and I am really sorry. But I’ve got some comments that I still should go on writing this story and I am so happy that I’ve got this much loyal readers. So I am going to finish this story.
I was scared.
Of course!
It was warm in his bed and soft and every thing smelled like sandal wood and honey. I loved it!
“Mission failed!” Tony whined as he realized the time, “Fuck.”
“I know”, was my answer. So I stopped.
“You are. Don’t deny yourself Rogers”, Clint laughed.
But Tony was also loud and obnoxious, he seemed like he didn’t care when people are mean to him, just brushing it off, as if it was dust, even though he does. He built himself an armor and put on a mask to protect himself. With all his stupid comments and his sometimes terrible behavior he tries to warn people, to keep them away from him. His soft core was surrounded by fire and when you get near him to fast and to hard, he is going to burn you.
“Is everything alright?” Bucky whispered from the doorway.
"Yeah I know that, Dad, doesn't mean that I have to like it" Peter grumbled.
“Come on admit it”, Bucky nudged me.
Fuck, what happened? Where is Steve and how did I got here.
I stumbled the last steps and held tightly on the doorknob, before I managed to get my frozen finger to pull the bell.
And when you are not german you can write me anyways because I love talking to people and I am lonely. :)
"If you want to" Steve nodded and then they finally climbed into Steves car.
Wade growled.
Then the whole divorce process came. The media ripped Tony apart, saying that it was sure from the beginning he would fuck up again, saying he didn’t deserved someone like Steve anyways. Through the whole process Peter wasn’t allowed to see his dad.
Panic started to force itself on Tony, making his body shake with fear.
Am I really in love with Tony Stark?
I screamed as loud as I could as I saw a giant shadowy man standing in the door way, before my whole body shook and I found myself in Steve's room with Steve standing over me, looking worriedly in my eyes.
"No."
At least it made me forget the pain.
Two hours later Peter woke up again. It was 3 am now and he would have loved to go back to sleep but then he heard clinging noises downstairs and sure that it must be his Dad he stood up and made his way downstairs to seek out his father.
“I am going home… I still have stuff to do and you know, I didn’t wanted to bother you!”
“Peter!” Tony looked shocked. “Don’t talk like that about your father! He loves you and he wants the best for you and he was right, I shouldn’t have you let stay awake for so long, but I forgot the time and I am sorry, okay. I will do it better now.”
Tony had cried this night. Peter knew it because as he had to pack his things to leave the next morning the eyes of his Dad were red and puffy. He had bags under his eyes and he looked defeated. Not like the Tony Stark everyone knew anymore. Steve had cried too but he at least looked determined.
“No Peter, don’t say that. Why would you want that?” Tony asked, pain in his voice.
I wasn’t that much out of my mind that I went to Steve’s instead of Rhodey’s home, wasn’t I?
Next chapter. I hope you like it.
"Of course", Tony whispered and stroked Peters hair, giving him a kiss on top of his head.
Wade let go of Peter still grinning widely. Peter still laughed, smiling brightly at Wade.
But somehow I couldn’t take my eyes off of the trio in front of me.
Harsh breathes where heard.
It was good being back again.
“It should!” He screamed and before I even could start my escape he had already grabbed me and punched me in the face.
Tony and the other Avengers, aside from Sam, Bucky and Nat, because they needed to train for their mission, sat down around a huge table inside Shield HQ.
His Dad just parked in front of the school to let Peter out as he said: “Before you show it, we should probably test it, just to make sure that… you know it doesn’t randomly blow up or something.”
"Stop talking now Peter!" Steve warned. "I don't want to hear anything from you. I will talk to your father."
"Oh that's so old! Please don't say that again. No one says that anymore."
Wade stood up quickly, making his stool crash loudly. The whole cafeteria went silent. Peter clenched his fists in suppressed rage.
“You know what, it’s okay Tony. Just make sure that Peter goes earlier to bed okay?” Steve gave in and then had to swallow hardly again as Tony threw him his brilliant smile and nodded contently.
She turned towards her son, hugging him strongly for a short moment. There was pain and worry in her eyes, when she looked at his flushed face, from being hugged by his mother in front of his friends.
Not that I think he is weird, awkward or difficult, but maybe he thinks it.
Tony loved Steve. He knew he still loved him and it made him angry that his stupid heart can’t seem to grab the hurt Steve caused him. It annoyed him that Tony couldn’t hate him, because he still loved him. Love, what a stupid feeling!
“No, he still thinks, he doesn’t fit in here”, Pepper said sadly.
"Everything was fine" Peter answered shortly.
Wade leaned down and kissed Peter. Peter turned around in Wades arms to have better access to Wades lips and returned the kiss.
Tony kissed Steve. Their lips meeting with a force of desire and love and fear and pain that both of them had to catch their breath when they pulled apart.
"Now!" He nearly yelled. Wade and Peter jumped and Wade didn't loose time to scramble out of the car as fast as he could.
Who was that? Not dad, I am not at home, that’s not my room and… didn’t I went to Rhodey?
“Yes, that is exactly why we are here, “What if”… Fury and I made a plan in this case”, Hill came into the front of the room from the corner where she stood.
“No you don’t”, Pepper smiled warmly at me and I couldn’t help it but look at her pleadingly.
“If you hurt him, I will kill you!” Rhodey warned me.
“Hey Ajax”, Peter looked up at him.
“Okay. Who are you and what did you do to the other guys?”, he asked and looked at every single one of us.
"Tony, are you okay? It was just a nightmare, just a nightmare. Everything is fine. Gosh, you bit your lip, you are bleeding." Steve whispered nervously and out of breath.
I blinked slowly, still too much in my trance state.
Ugh. Humans were so confusing. Why can’t everything be like numbers. Numbers were simple and logic. They didn’t joke or got offended or stupid stuff like that.
"You always say that, when we are in school" Wade argued.
And then Steve started to be nice to me and his friends too.
I looked up at that.
Wade and his granny had left after waving goodbye and now Peter stood here, next to his Dad and in front of Steve and Bucky.
“You are not using me”, Bucky answered softly.
“Exactly Mr. Rogers, but why? Either they have some deep secrets they don’t want you to know or they are afraid you would stop them, but why would they think something like that, unless there is something that they don’t want us to know. So, now the question is, what could that be.” Fury answered, crossing his arms in front if him.
“What did you just say?” Wade asked silently.
“What happened?” Steve asked as he settled himself down next to Tony.
Tony whispered something to Rhodey and Pepper gave him a hug before they came back to us with smiles plastered on their faces that couldn’t quiet mask all of the concern they were trying to hide.
“What do you mean? Do you want to bench me now?! You are not serious are you?” The last part sounded anxiously and even Papa was shortly too stunned to answer, but then he clenched his hands into fists as Tony went on talking.
He really made me want to tear my fucking hair out sometimes, with these stupid comments he was constantly throwing at teachers and these idiotic jokes that came out of his mouth, but he was never ever sad.
"I wont let you!" Steve screamed. "Please don't do this to me." Steve fell down on his knees in front of Tony not knowing what to do. He felt completely lost and out of control of the situation. Everything was perfect. Everything was good. Stupid Howard. He had to destroy everything. But Steve wouldn't let him. Steve wouldn't let Howard take the most precious thing he ever had from him.
At first I was sad, angry even, but I didn’t know where to put my rage, so I put it on myself. There are scars on my upper arm, neatly put next to each other with a kitchen knife.
"Oh oh", Wade said.  Tony clenched his hand into fists, ignoring Wades comment and turned to Peter.
The school bell rang and Peter and Wade made their way to their classes as Wade finally answered: “I don’t know if this is such a good idea Peter, maybe we should firstly tell them that we are together.”
I didn’t want to annoy them. I would spoil the party anyways with my awkwardness. They would talk about school problems and football, of failed relationships and the new movies the wanted to watch or something like that, maybe even about how annoying their parents are. I really didn’t want to talk about that.
she laughed and took my plate away.
“Hm. Maybe…”
Tony sighed after the Mango slipped from his fingers for the third time.
Tony sighed again and stood up, figuring that he wouldn't be able to fall asleep anytime soon again, he ordered Jarvis to start running the shower that he could change out of his sweat through clothes and put on some comfortable jogging pants and a T-Shirt. After that he went downstairs brewing some coffee and trying his best to prepare some healthy oatmeal breakfast with fresh fruits inside for Peter and Wade. Because obviously sticky, slimy oatmeal is the most healthiest breakfast for growing adults... at least thats what Steve told him.
“That smells good.” Steve licked his lips.
He grabbed his tray with his not even half finished food on it, walked to the bin and threw it away before angrily stomping out of the cafeteria.
“You idiotic bastard! Don’t think you can ever come back!” Was all I heard, before I turned around the corner and was gone.
Where was I?!
“I am sorry, Tony.” He heard Steve whisper.
"Uhm... Maybe I should go?", Wade said, already tip toeing to the door.
With still hazy eyes he looked at the clock on his nightstand, realized the time and rubbed over his eyes to get the sleep out of them. Next to him his boyfriend still slept peacefully, his chest moving up and down with every deep breath.
Steves hands turned white so hard did he hold onto the steering wheel now.
“No way!” Peter yelled, making both his parents flinch because of his outburst. “I want to spent as much time with Dad as I do with you!”
Peter nodded. "I know."
Tonys scowl deepened.
“I see the problem Steve, but don’t you think Fury is a little bit too suspicious with the whole situation. Spiderman and Deadpool both never gave a sign that they want to gain our trust, if anything they even avoided us more.” Bucky countered and when he finished his last bit of pancake stood up with his plate in the hand and moved it to the kitchen.
In the end they had to extinguish the fire that broke out in the stove and ordered Pizza from the nearest Restaurant.
Furiously, he wiped it away, looking determined at his father.
"I don't look cute. Puppies look cute and I am not a puppy!"
Then both turned around and tried to sleep.
"Its okay, Tony. Its okay", Steve whispered and pulled Tonys head to his chest. Tony sobbed, trying to calm down but not able to stop the flow of tears.
“I think it was funny”, snickered Rhodey.
How can Tony think, he doesn’t fit in here?
Peter nodded and shuffled upstairs into his father’s big and fluffy bed.
Wade stopped too a little started by the abrupt halt.
I out my long board into my locker and then made my way to my first two lessons of history together with my friends.
Shit! Ohshitshitshitshitshit!
Peter smiled up at him.
Dad frowned at him but followed him up to give him his usual good night kiss after Peter made himself ready for bed.
Satisfied Steve let himself lean back on the backrest.
“Aww look at that, now he is blushing like an idiot. If that doesn’t say it all”, Natasha grinned.
“Oh and how I understand. I know you still love Tony, Steve. I know you agreed with a relationship with me to take your mind off of him. I know you, Steve and I forgive you. I am your best friend, you helped me with everything when I came back from Hydra. You were there for me and if I hadn’t have you in this time, I probably would have gone crazy, maybe I wouldn’t live anymore, if it weren’t for you.” Bucky interrupted him.
“Steve?” My mom finally answered the phone.
“Okay, that was not how it should have happened, but I swear it did function earlier this day.”
Peter shook his head and then shoved his head into the fluffy pillows.
“Uhm, sorry guys, but we…” Pepper pointed at Tony and stood up, Rhodey close on her trail.
I wanted to walk past them and escape home, where hopefully I can hide in my workshop until Monday, but Mrs. Rogers grabbed me, before I could and smiled warmly at me.
I just pouted and glared at the sea of candy’s covering the table.
“I asked him for his opinion and said, that Spiderman and Deadpool seem like nice guys and they didn’t actually do something bad, they probably just want to help and that I think they are cool. Dad said, that he sees it the same and the Fury shouldn’t do such a fuss about it, but he obviously is the agent of agents and it’s his job to be suspicious. Dad is on our side in this matter but if the others are not, we are screwed.” Peter answered, getting more nervous each second that passed.
“This just became a team problem,” Blaine said evenly. “I don’t know if you think you’re a good liar, but you aren’t. I don’t need details, but I need to know what’s going to trigger this so it doesn’t happen again.”
“It’s charming,” Steve said flatly, grunting as he got himself up  and crawled to the end of the bed. It was snug against the wall on all of the other sides.
Steve paused mid-step, loosely gripping the handrail. He looked around, as though some sort of light would show, but none did.
The kitchen was different too. Steve didn’t even remember what had been on the countertops before, but they were totally clean now. Not even so much as a decorative fruit bowl adorned the granite, and the fridge was blank, no trace of any of the photos they had taken together, or even the saved notes Tony had attached to the door from months prior.
Well, past tense.
“Get ready!” a sailor called.
Jackson was speaking quietly to Tony, and Tony was nodding and saying something back, but Steve couldn’t make anything out until Tony looked up at him, his eyes still a little wild.
Even so, Tony couldn’t watch him suffer for long.
“You aren’t leaving yet,” Blaine replied, looking him dead in the eye. “Who did you call when you left?”
Peter and Harry were already raiding the fridge, talking about their trips up. Harry had gone with Jackson, Peter with Tony.
“Not this time,” Tony assured him.
“Okay,” Steve said softly. “Okay, I’ll do it.”
Steve’s stirring paused and he looked up with a furrowed brow. “Why? Did something happen?”
Steve’s personality flared back to life. “You’re sixteen. You have the rest of your life to be somebody. Tony agreed with me to keep you in school with kids your age—it wasn’t just my decision.”
In the limbo period, he could daydream of a life where Steve wanted a kid. He could imagine Steve playing with Mr. Snail, Morgan’s favorite stuffed animal that was literally just a large, puffy snail with a glittery shell. She carried him everywhere. Steve would love it. Steve probably would have painted a picture of her and Mr. Snail or something cute like that. The best Tony could do was build a little snail house for Mr. Snail to sleep in at night.
Blaine let out a shuddering breath and his face relaxed.
Franklin was staring at him. Steve didn’t meet his eyes because he had a feeling Franklin wouldn’t look away.
“We’re not having this conversation. I want my coffee.”
Tony scowled. “Don’t kid yourself, Rogers. I’m not exactly keen on this either, but backing out after photos like that--with our history?--It might be better to keep it going a little bit.” He shook his head. “We’ll discuss in two days, after we see what the news cycles spit out.
Steve’s eyes narrowed. “You’re not Tony.”
Steve’s brow furrowed a little. “He was surprised to see me at first, but—“
“Stop it right there,” Bucky said sternly, grabbing his chin and forcing Steve to look him in the eye. “Don’t you ever talk about yourself like that, Steve. Don’t you ever think that about yourself.”
“You’re being awfully quiet for a guy who wants this over with,” Tony murmured, prepping one of the IV needles.
“Wait for what, Tony? What is there to wait for?”
“For you,” Steve spat, but it was spineless.
Bucky looked back up at him, and for a moment the whole world froze.
Steve considered not answering, letting it stew in Peter’s mind what might be happening in his dinky hotel room, but then he remembered that Peter was his son, that ruining Tony’s day would only further ruin his own life, that nobody cared what happened to him as long as he didn’t go off and die.
Steve sucked in a quick breath, trying to prepare for whatever was going to happen.
Steve took a breath. “Yup. So, I just wanted to let you know. I’m about to head out to meet Peter for dinner, so I gotta go. Take good care of my dogs, yeah?”
“You’re nervous,” Steve teased.
The next room was sea themed. The walls were lined with seashells, with piles and piles of them at the base of every exhibit wall. Of course, kids were trying their best to steal away from their parents to attack the piles, but from the looks of things, so far only a few had succeeded.
“I’m gonna get you back home, Steve.”
Steve still couldn’t get over the fact that Tony had so blatantly lied to him. He’d seen that map, those portals.
“I’m fine,” Steve said in an even tone.
While he was confident Morgan would be safe from whatever danger might come their way, he couldn’t be so sure about himself. He was getting older, and every battle took longer to recover from than the last.
Or he’d been thrown forward in time somehow. Those were the only two possibilities he could think of. It certainly felt similar to when he’d woken up from his icy slumber all those years ago, so his gut told him that he’d travelled to the future, somehow.
“From Stark Industries, I know,” Steve said, trying to keep his voice level. His heartbeat was so loud he was sure Emory was flipping out in their pod, trying to see what was going on with his microchip readings.
Steve’s heart didn’t press hard against his ribs, his breathing didn’t thin with affection, his eyes didn’t even move to take in more. He just loved Tony. He loved the man he’d married and the man who’d divorced him. He loved the person he was and who he had been.
As though he’d lost something dear to him. Something fond.
“I was wondering when you’d wake up,” Tony murmured.
He had never trusted another person more. Not even Bucky. He had trusted Bucky with all of his secrets and they had been best friends, but with Tony it was so much more. Steve didn’t just trust him, he knew him. That was the only way he could think to describe it. His confidence in Tony was so strong that whenever they worked together on something, Steve knew with full certainty that they would succeed. When he couldn’t think, Tony thought for him. They filled each other’s holes. More than that, they built each other up so that even when they were separated, they weren’t any weaker. Tony made him stronger than he had ever been and Steve knew he did the same for his husband.
Steve laughed, but it was hard not to feel sad as Tony led him toward another workspace connected to the lab. Even with all that he had learned thus far, he didn’t think he would ever know the full story of this world. It would take a lifetime to dissect what had happened here, and how it had affected Tony. Steve wasn’t even sure that Tony was really better, if he had changed from the man who had kidnapped other versions of Steve Rogers to experiment on.
“We need to get under cover,” Steve said after a moment. “It’s going to storm.”
The elevator doors opened to the hotel lobby, where several paparazzi were already flashing photos as they strode out to the car. Tony held his hand a little tighter, but Steve knew he was ready for this. Nerves weren’t enough to tear down what they had now.
Sixteen years and they were finally there.
The molten shrapnel hadn’t been molten shrapnel at all, just Bucky’s metal fingers ruffling his hair like he always did.
“I wanted a ride from the tarmac,” Steve blurted out. “I wanted you to be there. I mean—I guess you have a daughter now and of course she comes first but I’ve been gone for three months. If you really want me here, why didn’t you come see me? I waited for you.”
He tossed his phone onto the mattress.
“C’mon,” Steve said, nodding toward the bed. “I don’t think it really counts as cheating if I sleep next to my boyfriend’s dimensional counterpart.”
“I waited too long,” he said first, instantly smacking down the resolve Tony scrambled to gather. “But I couldn’t let you think I was using her. I wasn’t ever going to say anything about this if I’d decided differently. I would have just stopped teaching and gone on my way.”
Something smacked against his cheek and Steve jumped back instinctively just in time to catch Natasha’s grin. Her boxing gloves were dangling from one wrist, swinging in the low light of the boxing gym.
Tony’s hands were under his shirt in seconds. “I love you,
Steve looked up from his plate, suddenly unable to breathe.
“You’re all cut up. Jesus, look at you.” Bucky let out a huff, gingerly prodding Steve’s arms. “Your goddamn ex hit you with his car. Both of you are dumbasses, I swear.” Bucky thwapped him on the head with his flesh hand, jarring Steve to alertness. “Look where you’re goin’, ya hear me?”
Tony stood, pulling a towel from beside the sink to start cleaning up the blood. “Took it off.”
He pushed past Pepper and got in line, cutting in front of most of the people waiting. Murmurs rippled through the crowd that weren’t friendly, but Steve hardly cared.
“Steve still can’t beat me,” Blaine said with a grin.
“Yes,” Morgan piped up, sensing the tension. She hopped at Tony’s side, silently asking to be lifted up. But he was frozen in place again, unable to move without fear of faltering.
“He won’t throw it away. It’s all he has left of me.”
a·tax·i·a -
they ever would.
A mortar shell burst in the water nearby, showering them with saltwater. The silence began to fall away, as though they were approaching a large crowd in a theatre. Each second made the sounds louder and the sense that they were missing something grew stronger and stronger.
He breathed okay.
God, he hoped he hadn’t missed something. Maybe kids had made fun of Morgan when she hadn’t shown up, or if they heard her father hadn’t been there.
But she was
Steve’s cheeks colored. He’d been fairly certain only a few select people knew that story. Bucky only ever told it around trusted friends--people they were
“It’s okay,” Steve said genuinely. “I’m glad to be included.”
“Three months? What kind of op is this?” Tony looked over Steve’s shoulder, as though Natasha might be standing there to tell him what could be so important that she was taking Steve out of the equation for three damn months.
“Okay,” Tony said as he finally let go of his daughter. “She’s on the couch, I’m gonna go get a cloth.”
Steve frowned, moving to sit up on his elbows. “How did you fix it?”
He found the helmet the following Wednesday, after the divorce papers had gone off to the lawyers to begin the formal separation process. It was buried under some clothes in Tony’s closet, a crumpled Post-It still stuck to the side. The writing was rushed, haphazard Sharpie scrawled across yellow paper, but the words said enough.
Steve flinched, unable to meet Peter’s eye. He had always seen Tony as the one to act too dramatically, coming over to his apartment in the middle of the night, trying to call him to hear his voice again…not a man that low.
Oh god. Steve probably grimaced at least a little bit, and his cheeks went red. He really liked his Tony, he did. But marriage? A family? He could never imagine the two of them having those kinds of conversations. Dating was difficult enough, and Steve didn’t really think his feelings could be described as being in love. Sure, he loved Tony, but he didn’t know for sure if he was
Steve had so much to catch up on when he came home. Tony feared that it would feel insurmountable. It was hard enough for him to come home after a weekend away and he saw her every day. Morgan grew so much in so little time.
Steve let out a little laugh despite himself, and rolled over onto his back. Leaving for three months normally wouldn’t faze him—in the scheme of his extended and potentially infinite lifetime it was just a blip. But leaving Tony for that length of time was harder to stomach than he’d wanted it to be. Everything felt too fragile to leave behind now. But duty always came first, no exceptions. If Natasha needed him out there, he had to go. Tony at least understood that.
“If this has something to do with Jackson, please don’t think like that, Pops,” Peter said. “You’re my dad first. Always. Jackson’s just my new dad, y’know? He’s really cool.”
A few miles away, amidst the clutter of a desk littered with shredded pieces of black thread and crusted, bloody gauze, a message notification lit Steve's tablet screen.
talking about, Steve?”
Steve bristled. “I’ve had other things to take care of.”
“He’s just getting cuter,” Steve agreed. He gently knocked Tony with his hip. “Get everything done?”
The subfloor at his feet was covered in a thick layer of dust, and only part of the room had the dark mahogany they had discussed. As usual, Tony had lost track of time, gotten distracted, let another project go unfinished. A ridiculous project at that. Steve could see much better uses for this kind of money than building a twentieth century ballroom and bar. They didn’t have enough friends to fill this kind of space, and half of them wouldn’t be interested in yet another party full of booze and too-small appetizers.
HE’S LYING, BOSS. HE’S ONLY BEEN HERE FOR—
“I mean, I think he likes you,” Rhodey said, looking off out the window.
There was an enormous amount of comfort in knowing just that one little fact. Whatever had just happened, Tony could take care of it. He could fix it, or at least tell him what was going on.
There was still a bite when Steve spoke his name. Something that flinched inside him.
“With my internship, it’s just easier,” Peter mumbled. “I already talked to Dad about it and he agreed.”
Bucky produced a laser pointer and wiggled it at him. “Had to get your attention.”
“Did my dad tell you about that?” Peter laughed, shaking his head and rolling his eyes. “We haven’t set a date yet, but yeah, we’re engaged.”
He perked up when Pete came into view up front, smiling and offering a wave that he knew Peter couldn’t see. Peter waved at someone else with a wide smile and Steve realized that it was probably Mary Jane. She had come all the way out to Malibu to support Peter and his father. That was nice of her. Steve liked MJ.
“I feel like I’m forgetting something,” Steve said distractedly, looking around the room again. Phone, keys, wallet…what was missing?
Steve kissed him again, sliding his hand back to run his fingers through Tony’s hair. Sometimes he forgot how perfect Tony was. He knew Steve was too attached to Peter, but never brought it up when Steve wasn’t ready. They had talked about it a few times, and even saw someone about it just a few weeks ago. That doctor said it was normal, to wait a month or so and see what happened.
a bag being tossed to the ground.
Steve gasped loud and flung up an arm in a reaction of complete terror. It happened quickly—he threw an elbow out and clawed for his head in a pointless attempt to stop the searing pain of his bones and brain melting, little noises of agony breaking from his battered throat, shaking his head, shoving, flailing—
Pepper gave him a weak smile. “Sorry, Steve. We’re just running out of time. Everything has to move right on time today.”
“Oh please. I’d be lying if I said he didn’t have an aesthetically pleasing appearance,” Tony said, pushing past Steve to get in the fridge.
He wondered if Jackson had ever read it. Probably not, since Jackson had stuck it into the things to send.
Tony swore under his breath as oil started to stream like a bleeding wound from his hotrod. Thankfully, none of it landed on his face, though this car was doing plenty to piss him off already. He never even drove the thing, but that was because no matter what he did, it never seemed right. New engine, new brakes, new everything—it was still wrong. Tony tore it apart about once every year and replaced every fucking piece except for the body and not once had it ever looked right since he crashed his armor into it while on a bender. Fucking car.
“Everyone knew the criminal was guilty. But he wasn’t condemned. It’s up to us to do the same—to recognize guilt, the consequences, and extend grace anyway.”
Tony sat with a paper straw bouncing between his lips. He’d chewed through two already. He wasn’t sure the sea turtles were any safer. He glanced at his timepiece, the minute hand a quarter past seven. A full half an hour after Steve was supposed to show up. Well, a full half an hour since Steve had been invited to show up.
“Dad, you’re not allowed to call Pops attractive anymore,” Peter muttered.
Really, ever since he’d been sixteen, aging had scared him. There wasn’t enough time in one measly mortal life to finish all that needed done. All that needed fixed.
Tony’s brow creased and he shook his head. “No, Steve. I’m worried about you, okay? I’m worried about what’s good for
“You guys okay?” Natasha asked. “Any injuries?”
I’ve relived every moment I can remember of our marriage with the memory tech I created. Jackson and Peter took it away from me and I hate them for it sometimes. I get it back one more time, when it’s really the end. I hope I die in your arms there.
“Nah, you’ll be good for the twelve,” Blaine said, slipping his hand away. “Like I said, it’s not addictive. The idea is that you don’t feel it working.”
He pulled away before Tony could move and scare him off.
And sometimes Tony just really needed someone to care for him. Of course he had Rhodey and Pepper and a host of others, but they didn’t ruffle his hair, cook him dinner, and kiss him goodnight (thought Rhodey probably would if Tony really nagged him to). He wanted Steve. He wanted Steve’s arms around him, someone to pull him to bed when he tried to stay up late. And someone to share the burdens of parenting, because they were significantly more straining than any course load at MIT or deadline for Stark Industries.
he had asked quietly.
The words on the newsprint in front of him went out of focus as Steve tried to see what Tony was doing out of the corner of his eye. His heartbeat was already elevated and his fingers were tingling.
“Wings you stole from the FALCON project,” Blaine said, and maybe there was a challenge in his voice.
“Your son.”
“You asshole!”  Tony grimaced as he peeled the spitball from his cheek and hurled it at Steve’s face.
“Who are you?” Steve asked warily.
“Yeah?” Peter cocked a brow.
“I didn’t do whatever you’re trying to imply,” Steve said, now confused.
No one ever called him a nice person anymore. When that had started happening, he didn’t know, but as he led his team through a deserted Russian town, it crossed his mind. People had once assumed him to be ignorant and adorable because of it. They smiled at him when he didn’t understand things, as though they had won some sort of game Steve hadn’t known they were playing.
“Both.”
Sometimes Steve wished it had, just so he would have an excuse. It was such a selfish thing, because he wanted Tony to feel sorry for him, protective of him. Steve was pretty sure if he were a weaker man that he would let himself break down sometime just to see what Tony would do to help. but he wasn’t weak. Never had been; not before the serum or since.
The Navy commander stared at them with a decent amount of hatred—he was a sailor and they were soldiers, Steve didn’t fault him for that—then nodded once.
He chuckled, kissing Tony’s forehead again. “Never.”
“Thanks for telling me about the calls,” Steve said. He wasn’t going to call back. If it was important, someone would have left a message. Tony had probably just done something stupid or was blaming him for not talking to Peter, as though that were his fault.
“Tony?”
Maybe, just maybe, he had made the wrong decision after all.
“Overwatch, do you see any other patrols near the south fence?” Steve asked.
Steve turned his gaze back to his ex-husband, watching as Tony propped himself up with one arm, hair filled with sand, utterly bewildered. But Tony’s brain was working again, and within five seconds, Steve could see that Tony remembered how they had gotten here, where “here” was, and who was there with him.
Steve hesitated.
“This was one time,” Steve choked out, gripping tight to Tony’s shirt. This was probably the last time they’d ever see each other. He didn’t think he’d be invited to Peter’s graduation. Or marriage. Or birthday parties. Or anything. He would be the uncomfortable body in the backdrop that Peter shied away from.
Tony shook his head.
Steve shot him a look and kept the towel there. “Black Widow? She’s hardly inexperienced. And in hand-to-hand, I beat her almost every time.” Natasha was a good fighter, but her weapons gave her the edge over stronger, heavier men. Without them, she could do a good enough job, but not against Steve.
Not the same. Not the same at all, actually.
Tony said nothing. He stared at Steve, those too-blue eyes searching for something Steve knew he couldn’t give. He was thankful that those eyes had been so unnerving in the beginning. He should have listened to his gut.
“Steve—“
“Tony, I’ll get—“
This was a power move and he knew it. The penthouse was a place he never wanted to be in unless he had to be, and Tony knew it. When he did have to be there, Steve always stuck as close to the lobby as he could, just in case he had to turn tail and get out of there.
“You okay?” Steve asked, grabbing his fallen rifle from the floor.
Steve kissed him then, slow and sweet. His arms were as welcoming as ever, and Tony melted into him without a second thought. He loved Steve Rogers more than he should, and he knew now he could never do anything to risk losing him again. It would take time, and there would be plenty more hurt in their future, but Tony had seen firsthand how choosing to work on a relationship brought more love than he could have hoped for.
Tony looked at the floor, and Steve could see that his eyes were still a bit glassy. “Yeah, well…” He swallowed, looking around the room, everywhere but at Steve. “Could I sleep in here?”
he was when he was lurched from a nightmare. It was easy to forget that all of the righteousness and warmth and goodness that was Captain America was also a PR masterpiece. Steve was basically untouchable, but he was not perfect like so many believed.
“No,” Tony said again. “I saw where you were, I took the glasses off.”
He ruffled Bucky’s sweaty hair and then stepped past him to head to the Ferrari. There wasn’t even a dent where Steve had collided with the back end.
Steve smiled, reaching over to fold his hand over one of Tony’s. The typing paused, but Steve could feel the way his fingers twitched, betraying the irritation Tony was trying to hide. He didn’t take offense—Tony couldn’t help it.
“Forget I said anything,” Peter tried. “I’ll stay here, it’s fine. I want to stay with you, Pops. So what if it’s twenty extra minutes? I was being whiny.”
Tony shrugged. “We pretend to be in a relationship again. You can move back into the tower—on your floor, of course. Let everyone think you moved back into the penthouse.”
“They don’t even stock rescue choppers with name brand,” Tony muttered, mostly to himself.
Tony tapped his watch and the lights went out but for the soft blue glow of the skyscrapers outside.
“He’s so talented. I tell him he needs to start painting with me—you should see his sketches!—but he just hates it, so I let him go.” Candice rolled her eyes dramatically before taking a long sip of her wine.
There was no comm in his ear telling him what to do, no weight of his Kevlar and equipment slowing him down. He was weightless, like a goddamn fairy, waiting for a wind to blow him right off the roof into the Aegean.
“Steve, you’re torturing yourself,” Tony whispered in his hair. “You just torture yourself so much. Nobody hates you. Peter loves you.”
“Jesus.” Tony flopped onto his back, his hair a bird’s nest. He rested the back of his palm on his forehead and closed his eyes, clearly trying to think through the night.
Steve lined the red dot of his scope up to the dog’s chest. It was a tricky shot, but even if he had to punch through a leg or two, the bullet would kill its target.
“Okay, okay. My bad.” Tony rested his forehead against the dip in Steve’s collarbone, taking a breath. “But can we at least make out on the couch for a bit? Please?”
“That’s a first,” Tony muttered.
“Five dogs left,” Blaine growled under his breath before heading toward the first door in the hall.
Silence hung in the air, something pressing and insistent—like he’d been asked a question. He blinked, eyes running over the room as he tried to pinpoint exactly what was causing the issue.
Well. Steve sat back in his seat, arms folded in a subconscious way to protect himself from such a callout.
Like his brain boiling. He could feel it happening in his skull, slowly but surely simmering the life away from him.
“Method,” Tony mumbled. “I’ll see what I can do.”
He had considered bringing a date, just for some kind of rub-in-Tony’s-face kind of deal, but he couldn’t even fathom actually doing it. Peter would be in the wedding anyway, and would be disappointed in him if he showed up with a date.
“Twice.”
Tony actually looked surprised. “Cruelty? I may be an asshole sometimes, but this isn’t cruelty. I’m not saying you have to stay part of this family, but…but I do want you to.”
“The wine!” Thor laughed, as though that meant anything to them.
Okay, not really. Steve himself was perfectly fine now—happy, healthy, his normal self. But something along the way to returning to normal had driven away the one person Steve Rogers loved with all of his heart.
“You could have told him from the beginning when you hatched this fatherhood plan of yours.”
Tony looked away.
“Probably not,” Steve replied.
“Nope,” the soldier replied. “Looks like light weaponry, civ shit.”
“People don’t think that so much anymore, you know that.”
“Something a little more raunchy,” Tony said in a warning tone, very much aware of his daughter on his chest, slowly falling asleep against him as he swayed left and right. “Some very consensual things.”
“Fuck you,” Pearson grumbled, snatching up the sizable pile of cards.
Steve didn’t let his gaze linger as he headed out, slipping past Tony and back into the living room. This was not the homecoming he had wanted. His gut was churning, his head spinning, and his heart didn’t know whether to break or turn to mush in his chest, so all it did was hurt.
Sam nodded slowly. “Yeah, I’ll bet.” He took a tentative step forward. “Hey man, it’s all good. Just give a man a hug.”
Tony cocked a brow. “What?”
Steve blinked, turning to Not-Tony again. “No,” he said, shaking his head. “That’s not right. I was never at Monte Cassino. We got rerouted to Belgium on our way there.”
“Anything else?”
His therapist said that was a lie. Steve didn’t believe her.
Bucky snorted. “Yeah? When’d I say that?”
He just hoped it was early enough. That their divorce wouldn’t cause Tony to snap and follow in Howard’s footsteps. Now there were statistics about abuse, and Steve knew that children who were abused were likely to abuse their children. Two fathers with a history and two fathers with alcoholism in the family? Peter was doomed.
Mail call had been a godsend or a trip to Hell for many men. Letters from home inspired men to do better, comforted them in dark times, or cut them off at the knees. He’d seen men begin to openly sob as their sweethearts left them, wives told them of other men, and fiancé’s broke off engagements. Worse was when there was no letter at all, just a maddening mind game.
“Natasha found me today while I was training. She needs my help.”
“I’m hanging on every breath here, Tones,” Steve said once they had both sat down.
“A proposal?” Steve asked, cocking a brow. He had to play it cool.
He dimly wondered if the compound still existed.
“Somebody get the hostage out of here,” Steve grumbled as he sifted through books for any traces of intel.
Tony rolled his eyes, but obviously peter couldn’t see that. “Sure thing. Just have them send a decent reporter, yeah? I don’t want to deal with some People Magazine shit.”
“Clear.”
“Mm,” Steve finally murmured after a few minutes. “Can’t keep m’eyes open.”
“I had a dream about a babysitter who didn’t show up,” Tony said, instead of asking. He told himself it was because he knew better, but it was really because he didn’t know what he’d do if Steve rejected him now.
Steve’s lips parted, but he didn’t say anything immediately. “Changed?”
The last sentence spilled from his mouth unplanned, and he closed his eyes with a quiet, sad sigh. He was a horrible father. A horrible person.
“What Iron Man’s doing,” Tony corrected with a squeeze to his cock.
“You’re an idiot,” Steve said, unscrewing the cap on his water bottle. “Name brand. C’mon.”
The cashier looked at him a little too long and her red nails clacked against the countertop as she waited for the card reader to process his receipt.
His apartment in Brooklyn wasn’t much. A little studio loft with a nice view of a few trees on the street, and he even had one that partially blocked a window, giving the wood floor a green cast and sent the light dappling across the boards. Many people and organizations had offered him much fancier places to live, and sometimes Steve did spend a few weeks at the Avengers Compound upstate, but he liked his studio. Besides, the price tag was absurd for this little place, he couldn’t imagine what it would be in Manhattan or wherever else they wanted him to live.
He hadn’t meant for it to come out like that. That sounded so desperate.
“I’m always up early.”
When the doors opened to the penthouse, Steve had his hands clenched to fists in his pockets. Tony had redecorated months ago, but it was it was always a shock to see different furniture, rigs, and paintings on the walls. It was a clear message that he was gone from Tony’s life, and any shred of familiarity he may have found here was wiped clean. Even the kitchen appliances were new, and the granite countertops replaced.
Steve cocked a brow. “Well, if I’m not mistaken, we’re a lot further than the door.”
Jackson probably knew that absolutely nothing was going on for the Avengers right now, but he was too nice of a guy to say anything. And he probably wanted Steve gone even more than everyone else.
It was only a little bit unnerving knowing he was being watched all the time, but he never asked Tony to have JARVIS turn off or stay quiet or whatever it would be. JARVIS protected them and kept watch over Peter better than any guard dog or human being ever could.  “We’re just fine, aren’t we, Pete?”
“You two co-own Stark Industries now?”
Terror numbed the pain, he discovered. Or maybe it was time.
Steve was silent for a long while, running through quiet memories from when days were something he looked forward to. The nights he had been unable to stop smiling, waiting for the next text from Tony to light up his phone, for the next time they would see each other and he would be able to entertain thoughts of Tony wanting to be with him. Then the nights where Tony fell asleep on his chest while they watched stupid movies that Steve didn’t pay attention to, too busy running his fingers through Tony’s hair and imagining a life together with him.
Steve sobbed then, a low, mournful sound. Even though he had known for well over a year now that Tony didn’t love him, hearing the words from his mouth was worse than any pain he could recall in recent memory.
“And he will. I’ll go in late tomorrow.”
Clouds of smoke were exhaled, but no one said a word.
“Tony—“
“Jesus,” Sam breathed. “Come on, let’s get him set up. Anyone know what happened?”
Steve took his hand like nothing was wrong, like they hadn’t been apart for as long as they had been. And the worst part was that Tony blindly followed, stumbling along after him.
“Are you done?” he asked after a moment, giving Tony a side-eyed glare.
“Rogers, let’s take them out,” Blaine said.
Steve turned sharply, pulling out his phone again to delete the entire text conversation with Tony, because he knew in a few minutes or a few hours he would look through it again, only to find himself utterly disappointed. What may have seemed so affectionate or intriguing or thoughtful in the moment always soured to the truth after a few hours away.
He remembered the look of absolute disbelief and disappointment in Tony’s eyes when Steve had descended to the lab to apologize.
. Richards, you prick,” Maria snapped.
Steve shook his head.
“So, yes.”
Bucky looked at him and smiled a little. “I know you’re sorry. It ain’t your fault I misunderstood.”
He walked out of the bathroom, but let the door shut softly behind him.
“Ah.” A pause. “But you wanna do something for her anyway.”
“One second, Peter. Everything’s fine,” Tony called back before standing up himself. He was frustrated, with his hands curling into fists and then uncurling again at his sides. “Come with us, Steve. Just come stay the night at the penthouse, in a guest room, and we can figure all of this out.”
Morgan loved to look at his creations. DUM-E was her favorite, since he liked to dance with her and show her things. Tony always had to watch, though, because sometimes DUM-E tried to hand her things he shouldn’t. Like glow sticks. Where he’d found glow sticks, Tony didn’t know.
“You didn’t have to do that,” Tony said with a smile.
“I think so,” Steve said, rubbing his temples. Exhaustion clung to his eyes, and he longed for Tony’s bed, the fluffy comforters and the soft pillows, and the scent of Tony’s impossibly expensive laundry detergent.
Tony hoped Steve’s heartbeat was faster now, that his skin was cold with the pressure to impress him, to fix his daughter and save the day.
“Sorry, Bucky was calling. God knows he would have jumped on a plane and headed out here if I didn’t pick up,” Steve said.
Walking across the bottom of the lake wasn’t all that difficult for Steve or the men in his spec ops unit—a refreshing change from the Howlers. Of course, the Howlers were always going to be the best group of people Steve had ever worked with, but his new team was groomed for this. They had given their all just to be selected for training to be part of Special Forces. They had been through the shit time and time again. They had unmatched accuracy, skill, and precision. Nobody beat these guys.
A younger soldier scooped up the hostage and called two other team members for cover as he carried her out. At least, Steve assumed the hostage was a her.
“Great,” Tony said with a false smile. “Now get out of my house. We’ll discuss living arrangements after we see how the reveal goes.”
“Tony, please just—“
Steve knew a decent amount of Russian from Bucky and Natasha, but he hadn’t practiced with it in a very long time. Bucky didn’t like to speak it unless he was incredibly pissed and wanted to convey it so strongly that Steve would know what he was saying even if it was in a different language. That didn’t happen very often, though.
Steve grabbed the hand, keeping his mouth shut as the aftershock of blood rain sprayed over the boat.
Steve shut up.
Steve had never realized how suffocating New York had become until he left it. Fresh air was his drug now—and Bucky was the only person that could keep up with him to enjoy it. Now he only felt at ease when his heart was trying to escape his ribcage and his lungs were burning white-hot in his chest.
He was met with a sleek interior that echoed the kind of car he was used to, but much more advanced. Screens showed exactly where they were on the route, potential delays, and estimated times for each stop. Advertisements played across surfaces where posters used to be, and as the train started to move the windows changed to a peaceful backdrop of what looked like English countryside.
Steve worked his jaw a moment. “We’ll be off the grid for three months.”
“You elected to have vitals—”
Steve frowned. He had been hoping that tingling feeling would stay.
Steve rolled his eyes. “You didn’t put us through anythi—"
“Just getting my morning run in,” Steve replied with a grin that sent the majority of the population swooning with all of its charm and handsomeness.
Steve tried to scream, but his chest buckled and his throat filled with molten copper. His ears rang as he tried to process, his eyes widening. Peter. Peter was there.
“What about Steve?” he found himself asking.
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve just seemed to realize that he had no shoes. He shrugged. “It’s a new health craze. Kind of nice to feel the ground,  I figured I shouldn’t try it on the sidewalk.”
Sometimes Tony wondered if Steve was actually bisexual, since Steve still acted like a teenager in front of women he didn’t know and perfectly normal around men he knew. Tony hadn’t once seen him give a man a once-over. Then again, he hadn’t seen him do that with women either.
He put his pencil back in his pocket and recycled his salad container, still grinning to himself as he stepped from the shop back out into the bustling atmosphere of the city. Ben was totally going to text him. Or call him. Ben was going to call and ask if—
“Tell me this isn’t alcoholic,” Tony said, shoving the wine glass toward Vision. “Test it.”
Dating Tony Stark had never entered Steve’s mind until a few months ago, when he suddenly started receiving gifts in the mail, at his desk in the Tower, and in his room in the compound. It had only taken two or three to figure out that they were from Tony, but Steve played the game until one day Tony was one of those gifts, asking him out to dinner.
Then his arms were pinned in place and he would have screamed if Bucky hadn’t looked so frightened.
“Still—”
It made sense, though. She was probably a hotshot lawyer Steve didn’t know about but should.  Divorcing her husband, keeping things out of the media until enough time had passed, and then got to be together with Tony.
“Of course! I couldn’t miss Peter’s wedding,” Candice laughed.
“The—dog ate mine,” the other replied and they shared a chuckle.
. You can’t keep living like this all alone. It’s not good for you or Peter.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“You sure you don’t want to talk?” Tony asked, hallway out the door.
Steve’s hands came up, trying not to be awkward as he cupped Tony’s face again.
“I know.”
“You can at least pretend I’m still your husband. I figured that earned some kind of respect from you,” Steve cut, but he wasn’t sure he kept the anger in it as long as he wanted to.
“Neat,” Steve mused. “That’s really good.”
reporters. He hated the press and everything they supposedly did for society. For what they had done to him decades ago, and for what they had done to Peter and Tony.
marked his stitching coming undone and his entire being collapsing all at once right there in the foyer.
Three bewildered men stared back, wide-eyed and without their guns at the ready.
He backed away, his heart already aching in his chest. As much as he didn’t want to hear an explanation, he needed to know who had turned Tony from him.
“Fair enough. But you don’t get to insult me. This is automatically part of my personal life. I’m going to lie to all of my friends and family for a year, for you. So you’d better respect that, even if you don’t respect me. “
Steve chuckled, his eyes closed. “I know he does, Tones.”
A low buzz from his pocket broke the moment before it started, and Steve fished his phone out, the blue light indicating a new text.
Marriage was always suppose to be fixable. Because love fixed everything. Love was some magic potion that made all other problems away.
It was incredibly frustrating. It felt like his own mind was betraying him.
“Let’s move forward. Whatever that entails, but no one tells Steve. I’m telling Steve when it’s the right time. Hear me?”
“I’m not nervous. I’m furious. With you, Rogers,” Blaine spat.
And he had to admit the more nightmareish scenarios were starting to look more and more like reality.
By the time Steve had finished his salad, he was nearly giddy. Ben liked him, he could see it. The place was crowded, but there were still a few open tables that Ben could have squeezed into. Any number of chairs full of any number of people, yet Ben chose him. He was nice, charming, and funny as hell. And he liked art. Genuine in a way Tony wasn’t.
Buying gifts for Tony had always been particularly hard.
Normally, this was where Tony would blow off the question and make some remark about how a gardener might be able to spruce up the neighbor’s lawn a little bit, add some color (“Every house could use flowers, Rhodey, even brownstones.”). But Rhodey had been the guy Tony came to when things fizzled out with Pepper. Though their breakup had been amicable, he still hadn’t dealt with it well. And he was maybe just a tiny little bit afraid that this thing with Steve was an attempt at a rebound.
“Look at that. ‘M all shaky.”
“I just want to talk.”
That little baby. Steve couldn’t get that cheery smile out of his head, those round, chubby cheeks. A part of him felt like he’d been there that day, like somehow he was connected to the Steve that had lived here, and he had been the one standing beside Tony at that table on their son’s second birthday.
Right?
Steve chuckled. “I was hoping you’d promise to consult me before we adopt another kid.”
Preventing it the first place would have meant not asking Steve to do this at all. No—it would have been declining that goddamn wine Thor had given him at that goddamn party.
That didn’t mean it was easy.
“Mute!” Steve shouted as Peter began wailing in his ear, still clutching tightly to the shield.
The question echoed in Steve’s head as he sat there, staring at the floor. Peter thought he was absorbed in a fictional world. Steve didn’t even know what that meant. If anything, it had just been that he couldn’t handle city life anymore. Plenty of people were like that. Plenty of people were—
Waking up at the dining room table with his face smushed against an open book, a warm blanket around his shoulders and a hot coffee waiting for him, with the background noise of Tony playing cars in the living room with Peter.
Tony sat cross legged, eyes constantly moving as he read over the screen, absorbing information in languages Steve couldn’t begin to comprehend. He’d always been fascinated with how fast Tony worked. Every limb in his body was tuned to a minute frequency where even the slightest wiggle of an eyebrow was indicative of profound discovery. His fingers were always moving, but contrary to popular belief, Tony wasn’t always typing. He liked to keep his fingertips just grazing along the surface of his keypad, as though trying out a thousand methods before finally selecting his final choice and tapping away.
Steve had never been a person who was troubled with addiction. Most things in his life had been so fleeting or scarce that there hadn’t been any time to find something to cling to. Not even people. Everything was stuck in a rapid pace he could never slow down, and even when the world stopped, it was only for a moment. Not even long enough for him to catch his breath. People, feelings, places—all of it was barely breathed in before it was exhaled again, and Steve was left grasping at a ghost. Two weeks became five seconds, five years became a few hours. Addiction never had time to set in—or so Steve had always believed.
Steve realized as he slid from the water that he had been on this team for almost two years now. Two years of hard fighting, covert missions, and enough training to destroy a normal human being. Hell, he’d even grown a beard.
Steve watched for enemy movement while Blaine dug out a facemask from his pocket. He slid it on over his beanie and then down over his face before slipping on a pair of sunglasses. When Blaine retrieved his rifle, Steve did the same.
Utensils clicked against fine china and Steve’s neck prickled with unease, glancing up each time someone’s fork scraped ceramic, every time anyone reached under the table to grab the napkin in their lap.
just a heads up, i've changed the rating from mature to explicit and added more tags.  my works rarely include sex, but this one does (this chapter at least) and it ain't pretty. if reading sex scenes isn't your thing, same. this isn't PWP.
Steve didn’t waste time. “Start explaining. “
She snorted. “I didn’t need saving. And why am I supposed to trust you anyway?”
“ ‘M okay,” Steve slurred, turning onto his left side. His right arm was a mess, but his kneepads and shin guards had protected at least the front of his legs. Operators did not give up, and Steve was not about to let Blaine handle this on his own.
Tony flinched, gently thumbing over some Sharpie markings on a blood bag that Steve couldn’t read. “I promise you’ll go home as soon as we’re done.”
The rooftop was silent as the hovercraft was expertly guided into place—far different from the days of noisy helicopters and reactor propulsion systems.
Ben laughed. “Yeah? That’s cool. I’m a little old-fashioned too. Just not in a hipster way.” His face turned serious. “I’m not a hipster. I swear.”
Steve was wrapped in one; the fuzzy green kind that was somewhere between itchy and comfortable. A fine line he didn’t like walking, especially when he wasn’t wearing any clothes. Everything had gotten soaked pulling Tony out of the sea (honestly, Steve and water retrievals were so common that he ought not to go anywhere near any body of water for the rest of his goddamn life just to save others the risk).
“I worked so hard for this internship and all I’m asking for is three months without coming here and you don’t want to let me,” Peter said tartly. “You keep acting like I’ll grow out of this science thing or that I don’t really want it. Well newsflash, Pops: I like science and math. I love it. What I don’t like is sitting around this sad little apartment sketching things. I hate painting. I hate drawing things that aren’t blueprints. Every time I suggest we do something different, you just bring it right back to doing something you like to do!”
“I just don’t want to see you hurt, Tony.”
Steve nodded.
Candice had almost kept him. Stolen him. She had made the mistake of mentioning that maybe she did want children and Steve had nearly thrown up he had gotten so scared. They had been waiting nine months for a son, over a year in total including planning and finding a surrogate. And Candice had dared to say she wasn’t sure.
stay the course,” Vision reaffirmed. “It’s too late to turn back now.”
“Night night, boys.” She held Steve’s gaze for a second and gave him a wink before she closed the door. Great.
And hopefully, that was exactly what would come of all of this.
“Yeah,” Sam said carefully. “Bucky was giving me the update on the flight over. How’s the world-traveler life treating you and your new
Steve actually smiled, though the heat came to his eyes again. “I could spend a week solid with you and I’d still feel jealous when you left to go work with Bruce for two hours.”
“With you.” Tony’s cheeks went pink, but he at least met Steve’s eyes.
“I won’t tell him. But I won’t lie to him if he asks me.”
Clint looked confused for a moment, then shook his head. “No, not here to talk about that, but it is about a mission.”
“I used to be so focused on my lab and traveling and saving the world and all of that, but now that nothing’s happening, I’ve realized how shitty it is here,” Tony continued, mostly ignoring Rhodey’s comment.
“We’re going to collect all of your blood, and replace it with blood from my Steve,” Tony explained quietly. “You’re going to feel strange, because I’ve altered it. You’ll feel awake, but you won’t be able to see anything for awhile. And when you can, you won’t be here.”
“The secret.”
Tony didn’t buy it. “What, did he get a new phone?”
Morgan tugged him toward a hallway, her white hat flopping playfully as she tried to force him along.
He had to get home, even if he didn’t want to be there. Even if he didn’t want to pretend he had gotten sleep last night instead of sitting awake, wondering if every noise was one of Jackson and Tony in the bedroom next door.
“I need something to drink that’s a little stronger than pineapple juice,” Rhodey muttered. He opened his cupboard and pulled out a bottle of Grey Goose.
“Awh man.” Peter frowned around another bite of cereal.
As soon as Steve disappeared from the doorway, Tony turned off the car and his face turned serious. Something was very, very wrong here—he could smell it. The texts Peter had sent him did not match up with what he’d just witnessed.
“It’s just an internship, Steve. Just for the summer.”
ended up saying something stupid like that.  Tony probably thought he was an idiot, like everyone else that ran into him. He had come a long way from a few years ago. He knew about the world. He wasn’t actually stupid.
He was just so tired.
“Did we--?”
He’d had to mail those presents to MIT and Peter had only sent a “thanks for the presents, Pops!” text a week later.
“Did you finish your wine?” Tony asked, surprisingly coherent for how much he could feel himself spiraling. His cheeks weren’t even flushing.
“Mm.” Tony nuzzled into his chest a little more. “I missed
Steve headed into the kitchen before he could let himself be alone with his thoughts.
Steve felt a buzzing in his pocket, and his heart started to beat right out of his chest. “Daddy’s calling right now,” he informed his son, pulling out his phone. Only Tony had the number here.
He never wanted to meet them. He didn’t want them to know that he was anything but the monster Peter knew him to be.
“Tell me what you said to him.”
Because this had to be a dream. There was no actual reality in which his own daughter had a relationship with Steve and he did not.
To think that somewhere in Washington, nice and comfortable in their offices, old men were making the decision to send 200,000 men to fight with the full knowledge that so many of them would die.
Morgan smacked her Iron Man figure into the carpet, murmuring under her breath as she dragged her father’s face through the fibers. Tony watched with a little smile—he always smiled when Morgan was around. Even when she was screaming her head off in the middle of a very important lab session, he never minded. He would never understand how his father could have ever been so furious with him as a child. He’d never screamed bloody murder around his father in the lab, and he still got the shit beat out of him more than once just for being there.
Nikolai nudged his thigh again and Steve opened the screen door to step outside into the fresh air.
“Where would we go?” Tony asked.
He headed for the door, slipping past Peter to move the trashcan while he could still feel his hands.
The word “bisexual” still made him flinch—homosexuality was a bad enough word from his past, but being attracted to both sexes? Steve still wasn’t comfortable with it. Of course, it felt good to have an accepted identity of sorts, but in his gut he still felt like he was sinning. It was his old way of thinking, he knew, but that didn’t leave him easily.
judge that,” Rhodey said, taking a sip of his drink. His face soured for a moment, but he took another sip anyway.
“Hope you’re ready to get your ass kicked, Colonel,” Tony teased.
“Steve!”
He thought about abusing his power and checking Steve’s GPS signal. Just to see if maybe he was a block away, considering. But his therapist had warned him about that. Said it was sabotaging Steve’s trust.
Steve stood up, brushing the sand off his pants.
Steve’s stomach dropped.
Something hit him hard from his right, and Tony could only make a choked noise as he crashed into the side of his car. Nanobots flashed over his face, and his sunglasses clattered to the ground as his nano lenses came to life.
Peter wasn’t a virgin anymore. His son was already having sex with his girlfriend.
Tony’s eyes welled with tears again, and he hurried to wipe them. “Steve—”
“Hold still,” Steve said, reaching up to gently wipe an eyelash from under Tony’s eye.
Steve let out a defeated sigh. “Fine. Tony, you can call someone and I’ll talk to them. But I’m staying here tonight, I don’t want to go to the penthouse.” He just wanted to be done with today.
