“Steve, please, Sir, m’gonna, ummf, please you have to help me,” he tried to warn his Dominant. The others seemed to take such deep pleasure in restricting his orgasms, he didn’t want to come without Steve’s permission, he couldn’t couldn’t couldn’t. The crop hit landed far up his leg that he felt the air currents on his dick as it passed; he screamed as the dildo slammed into his prostate far harder than he’d intended.
Yet another uncharacteristic pause from the AI, but Steve was too impatient and excited to try to parse out its meaning. He tapped his foot on the ground, then stood up to pace.
He used to love being with Clint. The archer was a category 6 switch primarily inclined toward domination, but on the rare occasions that he did go down into submissive headspace he went
Christine Everhart was not quite the last person Tony expected to see on an otherwise quiet Thursday morning, but she definitely cracked the top ten. SI’s above-board, weapons-free projects were all flourishing, and the Avengers’ last several missions had been flawless, beyond the reproach of even their most cynical critics.
Finally, Bucky engages with a brief bout of self-harm (biting his lip) that Steve notes and is part of his insistence on Bucky calling his therapist. If you want to skip this, stop reading at "Even as he finished speaking..." and pick up again after the section break.
“It’s not. I’m being briefed on a situation I could honestly use your input on, plus a friend of mine is in town and I’d really love for you to meet her.”
This rather provocative comment spurred a debate that lasted nearly an hour. Through it all, the girl in the spider suit never made noise beyond the occasional grunt or chuckle. She never even took off her mask to eat or drink, even as the others demolished the small mountain of food that sat between them. Peter tried to ignore her, focus on the others. So what if the only other spider-enhanced person he knew was apparently kind of standoffish? However, this proved to be nearly impossible. His eyes kept trailing back toward her. She wasn’t setting off his Spidey Senses, so chances that she was an immediate threat were low, but he couldn’t shake the feeling that he was missing something. And Spider-Girl didn’t appear to be in a hurry to provide any answers.
Bruce offered this with the air of someone proposing an experiment they have little but academic curiosity invested in, but Bruce had also never been a particularly good liar. Even without the Hulk as a rather dramatic indicator of any strong feelings, Bruce had never learned to affect the polished, smooth shows of disinterest that had been some of Tony’s earliest lessons, nor was he trained in out-and-out deception the way Clint, Natasha and Phil all had been. He wanted this, and badly.
“Of course he didn’t. Not until it was too late and everything was falling apart. And even then he had no semblance of a plan, no conception of what it would really take to beat Thanos. Fucking ‘together.’ What a joke. I was
, even when he’d put every bit of his goddamn genius intellect into it, Tony had failed more often than he hadn’t. So he’d chalked it up to another consequence of his forced lack of orientational socialization (thanks, Howard!) and accepted that even when forced to cede to his body’s ridiculous requirements, his role as a submissive wouldn’t be any less of an act than his decades-long impersonation of a Switch had been. But right now—now it was like someone had handed him a detailed, well-written and extremely thorough guidebook, and then illuminated the path ahead of him for good measure. For once, Tony knew exactly what to do next.
Up until this moment, there had been something just slightly off about the sound of Tony, something that didn’t quite capture the little vocal tics and lilting nuances that Steve’s memory has been playing on a loop for longer than he’d care to admit. But the protective fury in his voice, oh that was all Tony. It felt like a punch to the gut when Steve was a hundred pounds lighter and several inches shorter.
Natasha and Tony date and scene, to the confusion of the media and general public. Steve faces the wrath (but not really) of Dr. Domen, and reconnects with an old hobby.
“I am not joining SHIELD. So if that’s why you’re here, and why you paid my bills, you can just leave.”
have it easy. Ultron was not easy for him. For any of us.” And wasn’t that the understatement of the century. The circumstances leading up to Ultron had been some of the worst of Steve’s life. He was furious at the implication that any of it had been easy just because it was different from this Tony's version of things.
Her amusement at Clint’s actions allowed her to overlook the one set of eyes that was on her-or rather, on the object she'd just placed in the playroom. Rather unfortunately, said eyes also belonged to the one person most likely to recognize the full significance of what she was offering.
Tony remembered with a shiver that went all the way through him hearing the others talk about Bruce’s crop with something close to reverence. Even the switches that didn’t often need or want pain spoke in hushed tones about the experience. He’d planned to ask Bruce for a demonstration before they’d left the Malibu house, but they’d run out of time, and maybe Tony had been slightly intimidated by the idea of something that could make even Natasha speak in a voice just above a whisper. And now it was finally being offered up as the answer to a pleasure he wasn’t ready to accept. (He wondered how they’d known, how they always seemed to know.)
“I’m going to start things off, and be in charge of running the scene,” Bruce explained, his hand drifting south past Tony’s waist to caress his ass lightly. Unlike check-ins, there was nothing clinical at all about his touch now, nothing impersonal or distant. “You already have some familiarity with the kinks you chose for today, but you’re still welcome to ask any questions you have before we get started.” Bruce waited several beats and then nodded when Tony did nothing more but try to swallow with a suddenly dry mouth. “Alright. Down in a seated position, please. Steve said you’ve decided on a ritual for how you want to start scenes?”
MJ did not think much of this idea. She also fruitlessly tried to suggest that Peter slow down drinking his stolen alien booze, but Peter had cheerfully disregarded this idea. It had been so long, so fucking long since he’d felt anywhere close to okay. Why would he not want more of the deep contentment that was coursing through him now?
? Jesus, Peter, I thought you were in a gang or being—I don’t know, abused by someone at school maybe, or on some kind of weird new drug. Which I guess was actually the closest to the truth, though not something that making you watch those D.A.R.E. videos on repeat was going to help. Why would you not just tell me this?” May cast her eyes about the room again, but this time with far more intent. “Did you tell him not to? Because I’m pretty damn sure it’s illegal to—”
If he hadn’t been headed somewhere he adored, Tony definitely would have been late for lunch. He’d split his morning between SI and SHIELD. The former was well on its way to implementing the basics of the mission he and Pepper had drawn up with feverish hope (and hyper-caffeinated blood) weeks ago. The place suddenly felt like it had the energy of a young startup instead of a multi-billion dollar corporation; he hadn’t fully realized how suffocating the place had felt before, even in his own universe, until these past few weeks as it started to teem with life and energy and, yes, the occasional explosion from the general direction of the R&D Department. (Tony would go to the mat for those wonderful nerds any day; explosions were basically a requirement of innovation as far as he was concerned.) For the first time, it really felt like Tony’s company rather than an ill-fitting hand-me-down from his Dad.
“For a long time classification was determined entirely based on bloodwork. Certain hormones and neurochemicals spike at 14. Cortisol is by far the most important.” The stress hormone? But that’s that unique to this universe at all, Tony mused, unwilling to interrupt Bruce but feeling entirely skeptical of the ‘science’ of all of this. Bruce appeared to read some of this on his face, though, and smiled. “No, you don’t understand. Part of the reason that it’s mandatory for kids to be intensively immersed in their headspace at that point is that most of them are legally not of sound mind for months. Until they start to get a handle on what works for them, cortisol levels average around 50 micrograms per decilitre.”
“You got almost all of them right, you know. You could stand to brush up on your postcolonial literature, sure, but it was a pretty respectable showing on the whole. No need to run out of the place like your ass is on fire.”
And just like that, there goes Rhodey's reputation as the reasonable one baha. Also, a special shout-out to AngelAni, who ages ago suggested a scene where Tony is taught to tie Thor up.
“I think he needs something in his mouth too. Clint’s right, I think he’s just so hungry for it he doesn’t know which way is up.”
Given that Bucky had spent a cumulative total of about fifteen minutes in Peter’s company, the latter was speculative at best. But Tony smiled anyway, content for now to stand in the ruins of Howard Stark’s legacy and hope he could build something better.
“When the Princess learned that I was dining with you, she insisted on planning the meal. She wished you to be comfortable, and claimed you would prefer something from your own nation. She would not be talked down.” Steve finally gave in to the urge to snicker, and after several beats of silence, Masdee joined him.
He regretted it pretty much the second the words spilled from his mouth, but May was devious, and she knew him better than just about anyone. She rushed them out the door without even putting on the fancy dress she had laid out on the couch. By the time Peter could have mustered a real panic attack, they were already stepping out of the elevator and into the penthouse.
Which means whatever this is is more sensitive than any of that. His stomach tightened into knots so painful that for a moment he thought nausea might make it past the serum. (Tony.)
As Bucky had turned out to be a veritable sage when it came to all things Tony, no one had bothered to put up much of an argument against the idea of making the collar both thicker and slightly heavier. They also agreed fairly easily that they wanted to use a dark, espresso brown for the leather rather than the standard black; it would highlight Tony’s eyes, and stand out without making Tony feel like too much of an outsider in a universe he was still hesitant to claim as his own. That, however, had been where the agreement had stopped.
“Everyone gets like this after scenes with Phil,” Bucky advised sagely (and correctly.) “Personally I think that’s why he’s classified relatively low on the scale. I don’t think anyone could survive being Dominated by him on the regular. S’like being turned inside out.”
Bucky Barnes: always good for the kill-shot, Steve thought. He’d inserted himself in Tony’s relationship with the team, on both sides of the equation, from almost the very beginning. No wonder things were so confused between them all, no wonder Steve couldn’t seem to stop loving Tony no matter how hard he tried.
It was a relief, Tony supposed, that he wouldn’t have to answer the question immediately, but the prospect still hovered over him like a cloud as he made his way back to find Rhodey. He’d once called himself a futurist, had reveled in his ability to always be thinking several steps ahead. But then there had been Ultron, and the Civil War, and Thanos, a future full of little but fear and resentment and pain. He’d learned to stop hoping for much beyond the occasional flash of dreams for Harley and Peter’s futures. It wasn’t something he knew if he could just turn on again.
“There was a small fire in one of the labs today. Something about a bunch of at-risk kids sneaking but not really sneaking into the Tower, which no one but Pepper and Rhodes knew anything about until today when we all got an unexpected shower?” He snorted, imagining the lot of them running around the Tower trying to figure out why the building’s extremely comprehensive sprinkler system had been set off in the first place.
For the first time since the conversation had started, Peter’s defensive posture and attempts at distancing himself from Tony through anger and irony were falling away. He looked and sounded a lot more like the kid Tony had known in his own world, a resemblance that was both reassuring and devastating. (Yeah, maybe Peter wasn’t the only one who would need to go slow here.)
Mystery user (your cloaking device is quite impressive!), you are not the only one who has recently sought clarification about the connections and divergences between the Tony of this narrative and the so-called MCU. Allow me to provide a brief outline.
Strange’s cloak ruffled around him in apparent outrage, but the man himself was annoyingly unflustered. He was kinder, too, than he had seemed on Titan; he helped Harley to his feet and went into Peter’s kitchen, emerging with three glasses of water that he set down on the living room table. The sight of an actual sorcerer doing something so mundane was enough, not to make the anger dissipate, but at least to distract Peter from the force of it for a few valuable seconds.
“In truth I still despise them,” Masdee confessed. “So of course, where does Talia ask to go during our walk today? To meet the royal goats.”
“I…yes, I am capable of interfacing with Peter’s AI.” Steve waited a beat, because none of Tony’s exceptionally advanced systems typically needed to be led step by painful step through a process. If anything, they tended to be a bit too intuitive. But FRIDAY was apparently a little on the slow side tonight. (Perhaps Steve’s initial theory of some kind of glitch was not as far off as it had seemed?)
Then Steve had very nearly left, abandoning this timeline to recapture a lost ideal in Peggy Carter. He’d known even then what a mistake it would be, had known it since that day in the 70s when he’d allowed himself to linger one more time outside her office. Oh things would have been great for the first few days, maybe even weeks. They could have danced cheek-to-cheek, he could have said and done all the things he’d regretted not saying and doing when he’d woken to learn that the world had moved on, and Peggy with it. Except then he would have had to build a life with someone he barely knew, someone who's happy future without him he would have selfishly ripped away.  He would never have fit back into the life he’d lost, and while Bucky had never argued with Steve when he’d communicated his intentions, Steve also knew that moments like this one were signs that Bucky had not yet forgiven him for nearly going through with the attempt.
Bruce started the same way he always did, stretching his hand out flat across Tony’s back. Without even a verbal cue, Tony’s breathing slowed and started to deepen in response to the touch. He felt his spine lengthen and his hips sink into a more natural arch.
“Jealous,” Steve said gently. “You felt jealous.” Silence greeted the naming of the feeling Thor had been so ashamed of, and Steve felt that very particular kind of hurt that he associated with Dominance, the kind that meant he’d failed someone in his care, that they were carrying a hurt that should have been his own. “Darling, you are not the only one. We talked about this at the beginning of things, remember? Jealousy is going to happen in a relationship with this many people. There’s no way to avoid it.”
No warnings I can think of for this set of replies, but as always, let me know if you have concerns or questions.
the overly permissive parent?” Clint protested. He sounded substantially less pissed off than he had an hour or so ago, for which Tony found himself deeply grateful. Having a Dominant be pissed at you when you were still in any degree of subspace felt, it turned out, fucking horrible.
The recipe also continues to evolve. He has experimented with different herb inclusions, including mint, and has promised to attempt a variation on a recipe Agent Barton found involving both strawberries and poprocks.
He expected to be taken to the penthouse; Natasha’s updates, while relatively sparse on specifics, had made it clear enough that the team had taken to treating the floor as a common space the same way they had when Tony—their Tony—had been alive. And while seeing the new version of Tony didn’t exactly fill Steve with warm, fuzzy feelings, the dep was bad enough by now that it felt worth a few minutes of discomfort to seek out his team and find someone able to help him through this.
Right away Tony ran into somewhat of a roadblock. Practically all of the articles were written with the assumption that the person aiming to support the Dominant in deprivation was at least partially submissive; there were things other Dominants could to basically stall until someone else got there, but from Tony could understand, none of it really did much.
turned out to be the operative word, given that she ended up seizing the wooden spoon he was using and slapping him not the ass with it halfway through, leaving behind a bright red stain on his jeans.
“Alright. But we should get the others, maybe. It’s not just you who deserves to know, and I don’t think I can bear going through this more than once.”
“I can never show my face in this Tower again,” Tony declared miserably, banging his forehead against Steve’s chest. “I’m gonna have to move, or at the very least get some pretty major plastic surgery so that I’m not recognizable.”
“Not to mention that I’m sure that kid is in pretty severe Dom-dep,” Natasha added. Steve had gotten a similar sense from Peter himself, but he still groaned aloud at receiving what was essentially confirmation. According to his file, Peter was a Dominance-inclined Switch. It wasn’t entirely uncommon for kids his age to end up in dep on the Dominance end of things, simply because minors had fewer natural opportunities to take on Dominant roles; healthy parent/child relationships, and even the bonds some kids shared with teachers and other caretakers and mentors were often enough to satisfy non-sexual submissive needs for things like care and guidance, but Dominance was harder to come by—especially for kids like Peter who didn’t seem to have much in the way of friends or partners.
It felt wrong, in some ways, the idea that Bucky was proposing. They were treating Tony like a mission or a mark about whom they needed to secretly gather intel. Even if the methods were similar, though, the goal wasn’t the same. None of them were in this to force Tony to share more than he wanted, or to somehow hurt him with this information; just the opposite. If they didn’t want to risk unnecessarily triggering Tony, or force the man to constantly repeat memories that were at times deeply painful, then everyone needed to have access to the same information at the same time.
“I’m pretty sure Tony has rules about your knives around his tech,” he ventured. Steve realized too late that he probably should have made more noise on his way in, but Natasha’s over-trained reflexes had apparently grown used to living at the team at last because the weapon in her hand did not go whizzing past Steve’s head or into one of his limbs.
“I have no need for your apologies. You were given cause, I think, not to trust many of your own shield brothers. I cannot atone for their errors, but I can attempt to ensure that our bond develops differently. Perhaps it is best we forego any power exchanges for the present, but I would still enjoy the opportunity to spend time with you.”
“So you think the first thing Tony does if he stays the night on your floor is going to be to go into your guest bathroom—not even the master, the guest bathroom, which I would bet hasn’t been used at all since I moved onto my own floor—and inspect the grout? This from the guy who as recently as last week sat through an entire meal without realizing that he had bits of wire from a broken circuitboard in his hair?”
“And how do you expect to form any kind of relationship with any version of Tony Stark when you have yet to grieve the loss of the first?” Steve sputtered angrily. How
“You’re gonna take your own eye out there, Big Guy.” Tony didn’t mean to talk, he really didn’t. He’d wanted to hang back, unnoticed, a little longer and try to sort out how any of this was possible. (If this version of the team was remotely like his own, their weapons were extensions of themselves. They’d grudgingly give them up to Tony for upgrades when absolutely necessary, but to exchange them this way? To laugh and joke while these core aspects of their identity were in someone else’s hands? It was unthinkable.) But Thor had been investigating the Bites by sticking his face right against the barrels; all it would take was one accidental brush of the charging button and the idiot was going to electrocute himself. And it had been weird enough for Tony to see his own Thor with two differently coloured eyes, dammit.
The Avengers did, occasionally, still manage to surprise Phil. Like when Clint managed to get through a mission without declaring that something ‘looks bad,’ or Natasha allowed herself to baldly demonstrate kindness in a way she doesn’t typically outside of scenes.
“I know you don’t. And to be quite frank with you, this is a conversation I would prefer we not have just yet.” But,” she held a hand up as Steve made to protest, “I recognize that if I try to delay, there’s a chance you’ll end our sessions altogether. So I’m willing to compromise on that with a few conditions. The first is that I want to ensure another member of your team is currently present in the Tower, and that they will be available to support you immediately following the session. You are under no obligation to share anything about our conversation with that person, but you are not to send them away, and you are to trust their discretion regarding any care you may require this evening.”
When he could manage to speak again, he offered what explanation he could. He spoke of Natasha’s efforts to keep the team together after the Snap. He managed a brief explanation of her orphanage, how much she’d loved those kids and had been loved in return. He gasped his way through Vormir, explaining the decision his Natasha had made to give up her own life to save the world, and Clint in particular so that he would be able to go home to his wife and children. Bruce and Natasha listened without interrupting, though they both maintained constant contact with some part of Tony, whether it came in the form of wiping tears from his face or pressing kisses to his shoulder. When Tony had finished offering another apology, Natasha lifted his chin so she could stare him squarely in the face.
Steve didn’t even have to make a special effort to seek her out. He and Pepper had coffee together every Tuesday morning now, a tradition he had come to heartily enjoy. She always brought the most delicious pastries with her, convinced that someone with Steve’s metabolism should take better advantage of the myriad of sweets available in the city. That day it was something called Brooklyn Blackout cupcakes (which were filled with chocolate pudding and covered in some kind of ganache.) Even despite his impatience to arrive at the topic of Tony, Steve still managed to eat three of the things before he was even done his first coffee. As he did, Pepper filled him on the latest changes to the Avengers Celebration.
“Stop hyperextending your elbow! Your freaky hyper-flexible dancer-limbs are not a benefit to you here, I keep telling you!”
However pissed he might be at Steve, Phil was never one to disobey a direct instruction from a Dom when he was in headspace. (Undoubtedly it was why the team had decided on him instead of someone like Bucky or Nat, who might have pushed back against the Dominance just for the sake of it.) He was compliant even when Steve got him settled on the bench, which included a built in cock sleeve that Phil despised almost as much as he loved. The man had a hard enough time not coming without permission when in headspace, and combining the promise of pain with the torment of the sleeve was more of a challenge than Steve would normally set him. But today, instincts turned all the way up to 11, he wanted as much as Phil could possibly give him.
Phil seemed to have gathered as much based on how Tony had requested his time, because when he stood to greet Tony, it was with the bland, bureaucratic air that Tony’s own version of the man had spent most of his time projecting.
Steve was disregarding those instructions entirely, Tony realized with a start. He’d arranged the lot of them in the way he felt would make Tony most comfortable, regardless of the optics. That simple kindness made it almost easy to smile fondly at the other man for just a couple of seconds longer than one normally would look at a friend or co-worker. The flash of cameras in response to this mere suggestion of intimacy was dazzling even from behind a pair of sunglasses. Every hand in the room was raised, and though they had started with the usual ‘be calm, be orderly, don’t bang on the glass of the animals’ enclosure, please’ speech, almost every one of them was shouting out their questions as well. Tony addressed himself, as Pepper had suggested, to a young woman in a headscarf and a sharp blue suit in the front row. (He could already guess why. Her enthusiasm was obvious, but if she possessed the almost callous hunger of many of her peers she at least had the decency to hide it better.)
, walking around with clear comfort and familiarity in the very last place he’d ever expected to find them, and Tony’s mind and heart were reeling.
you!” he protested, not ignorant of how petulant he sounded but not particularly caring either. The thought of losing these sessions, which had somehow become a foundational element in his life, felt like a sudden wave in otherwise calm waters. He couldn’t afford to end up taking steps backward, not with the collaring/wedding and all of the other transitions on the horizon. “We have a really good rhythm, and you know me so well, you know everything I’ve been through. I don’t know how I would ever begin to explain to someone else—”
Rhodes’ willingness to protect Tony at all costs, even if it meant trying to find a way to take down the Winter Soldier himself, was paradoxically what Bucky needed to feel secure. He edged his way toward the couch, the Soldier’s practiced lightness on his feet making him almost completely silent.
, and he was absolutely gorgeous—pliant, eager-to-please, and happy to take anything his Dom wanted to give him, from elaborate scenes full of props and pain to a simple hard fuck with a few orders thrown in.
Any suspicion Tony had that Strange was just making some kind of snipe about Tony’s intelligence as compared to his was stifled the second the spell or whatever it was started. The scenes didn’t come in any logical order; it was more akin to waves of data washing over him. He asked about Rhodey first, because the immediacy of his presence in this universe had his counterpart on Tony’s mind almost constantly.
whole thing?” Peter was trying to sit up in his bed, glaring in frustration at his casted leg, which hung suspended above him by straps. (With Peter’s healing factor, he rarely needed to be in a cast longer than a day. He wondered if Tesfaye didn’t quite believe Tony about the extent of the kid’s powers yet, or if she was using the cast and the kid’s presumption of her ignorance about said enhancements as a way to keep him immobilized. He suspected the latter; she was tricky like that.)
Across the table from Tony, Natasha’s expression had gone carefully blank, as had Coulson’s. Steve, whose tendency toward sincerity had never been fully even by the many years he’d spent as the leader of SHIELD, was frowning. Tony cut in quickly before any of them could press further. (He’d be damned if he was losing two Parkers in one night.)
This one is more spoilery, so skip if you have no triggers and want to maintain the surprise: in the last section of the chapter, Tony and Bucky visit Mark 2's parents' graves on the anniversary of their death. Howard's stone has been defaced (which Tony already knew in advance) by people responding to the news of his cover-up. This scene was outline before recent events involving the deliberate damaging and removal of monuments dedicated to those who have perpetrated various forms of violence and oppression. I happily support all such efforts, but wanted to be clear that this scene was not written as a response to that context, nor as an attempt to draw some kind of 1:1 connection between Howard Stark and perpetrators of real life violences.
What is most unusual, then, about Coulson, Barton and Romanov’s arrangement to allow for intersections of professional and orientational dynamics is that it is deliberate and ongoing.
“You like it.” Bucky’s tone didn’t suggest a question, but he also didn’t seem one for self-congratulation, so Tony assumed there was still some degree of uncertainty there.
He didn’t realize he was still talking, a nonsensical, sobbing stream of pleas falling from his lips, until he ran out of air and was forced to suck in a rasping breath. Above him, Natasha frowned. (Tony didn’t want her to frown, all he wanted was to make her happy, to bring her pleasure and joy and everything she deserved, he couldn’t fuck this up!)
“I’d you to imagine your ideal day,” Phil interrupted, cooly cutting through Tony’s bullshit the  same way he always had. “Not a special occasion or anything like that, just…a regular Tuesday.”
“Uh, well yeah I think there probably was room on the door—” Clint whooped, while Nat groaned and chucked a pillow at his head. Thor’s booming voice declared something about the almighty weight of the ‘excellent Leonardo’ being relevant, “—but of course none of that would have mattered if they’d actually brought enough lifeboats and regarded the poor folks in Third Class as humans.”
He was halfway through his second cup before Tony realized that he still hadn’t gotten dressed. It was hard to even muster up annoyance about how right they’d all been about that; his whole system, deprived of its regular routines with the team for days now, was clinging to even a hint of normalcy. And spending a good portion of his time naked did feel normal, and right; Tony didn’t have it in him to fight acknowledging it, especially not after yesterday when shedding his clothes around Rhodey hadn’t produced any of the shame or awkwardness he’d expected. If it was fine around his best friend, in whom Tony had zero sexy feelings, how could it not be fine with his partners?
“Science has played a big role in our relationship, and I don’t just say this as your science bro. It was what seemed like it was going to keep us apart at first, when we realized how different our universes were. Eventually that changed; even before your body started to adjust to being here, it was sharing the science behind orientation, and just seeing you in the lab, getting to enjoy the complexities of your mind as you focused on a problem, that really started to bring us together again. But ultimately, science was only ever part of what made this work.” Gently, Bruce moved Tony’s fingers. The only detail of the collar that was semi-visible, embossed on the outer layer of the collar to one side of the buckle, was a single word: freely. Tony bowed his head, finally accepting the inevitability of tears as he traced that word over and over and over again. “Science is beautiful, but what’s even more remarkable is this. You chose this, every bit of it: this universe, your submission, our entire lives together. You chose it, you chose us, and this is us choosing you for every second that you’ll have us.”
Steve had mostly learned to stop going into meals with any kind of expectation. There was just so much food available in the world now, not to mention free and accessible information about how to cook it in hundreds of thousands of different ways—he wasn’t complaining, mind, but he’d long since given up on ever feeling like he’d mastered food. That didn’t mean he wasn’t slightly surprised to enter Masdee’s rooms and find her table covered in Kentucky Fried Chicken. The steaming buckets of fried chicken, cardboard boxes of fries and beans, and styrofoam containers of too-green coleslaw just looked fundamentally wrong in this space, particularly when Masdee emerged from her bedchamber dressed in formal robes of a warm yellow. When she followed Steve’s gaze to the table, she threw her hands up in exasperation.
“Not…bad, but just. Well, remind me what you know about evolution, Tony.” Obediently, Tony spouted off everything he could remember about monkeys and Darwin and finches and natural selection. Howard gave no visible signs of approval (of course he didn’t, Tony was six, of course he should probably know more than this), but he didn’t yell or demand Tony leave the lab and return with a better answer, so it counted as somewhat of a victory. “Now, would you say it’s a desirable trait for people to need each other as much as True subs and Doms do, Tony? For them to not be able to function, for their muscles to stop responding to their brains and their minds to become frantic, just because they aren’t spending enough time in their headspace?”
It had taken the team practically no time to notice and accommodate this preference. Tony had cuffs in nearly every colour of the rainbow now, and in various widths and patterns. The case the held them all sat open on top of the penthouse playroom’s dresser. (Yes, Tony had been horribly embarrassed to learn, there had been a playroom like the one in the Malibu house right here under his nose the whole time. It wasn’t quite as comforting as that one, since this one remained unchanged since the previous Tony’s death; the team wanted Tony to help with this particular remodel.) The pair which currently encircled his wrists were bright purple with black hardware, an unsurprising colour scheme given the man who had purchased them, and who was currently sucking Tony’s cock with a skill that Tony’s brain was struggling to conceive of.
Steve grinned as he inhaled and caught a fresh whiff of pine. Not content with having decorated the penthouse, Tony had ordered Christmas trees for every floor of the building. Steve had tried hard to feel at least a little concerned about the excess of it, but it was damned near impossible to feel negative about anything when Tony was wandering the Tower with his brand new collar around his neck, humming Christmas carols while Dummy trailed behind him wearing a Santa hat. And besides, Tony had taken the time to decorate the trees on everyone’s floors to their tastes; Steve’s was covered in elegant, simple glass ornaments in reds and golds and silvers, and it even featured an angel at the top. This despite the fact that Tony himself had no investment in the religious aspects of the holiday, had laughed outright when Clint had confessed their worries that his interest in marriage signalled some kind of secret religious practice.
“Mmm. Guess it must be someone else who’s been sleeping in the waiting room for the last three days. My mistake. See ya, kid.”
“Well, it varies depending on the material. Contextually I’m willing to bet that it’s not too high for the magnet they gave us. The little oven that’s here doesn’t get much higher than a standard kitchen stove, plus it would be kind of a bummer to spend the entire night waiting for the magnet to cool down before we could use it and I’m sure at least JARVIS would have taken that into account. I’ll have to do some calculations.” After a few more seconds, Clint let Tony slide his hand away, tucked a pen behind his own ear, and leapt soundlessly down onto the floor.
“But the problem is most of those options are portals only to specific dimensions. So if Tony’s in the one we happen to pick then great, but if not then we’re worse off than we started. Plus some of them, like the Mirror Dimension, still require that Sling Ring thing to get back.” “And stealing one of those really isn’t an option?” Harley asked for at least the tenth time.
“Actually, scientifically speaking I think Stitch would probably have an edge. He can move objects something like three thousand times his size, and he’s fire and bulletproof,” Bruce mused.
“Sounds like everything Rhodey has ever said about being dragged into things was probably pretty accurate, huh?”
Bruce gives Tony a crash-course on the science of orientation. Steve avoids the Tower, but still can't run away from his new reality.
in here after he died? He wasn’t sure which option was more horrifying. But it was also he and Coulson (notdeadnotneadnotdead) in the shop together. With a project. After the whole palladium-poisoning issue he’d always meant to get his version of the guy down in the workshop; Coulson’s wickedly dry sense of humour had seemed a promising indication of a creative and complex mind. But they’d never gotten the chance. “And yes, we’re aware of the problem. The army just got a new contractor, and they’re trying to work around the very specific conditions you—err, the other Tony—left in his will. He’s not allowed to touch any of the proprietary Stark Tech in the suit, but since the original guns were made by Justin Hammer, he’s arguing all the accessories are fair game. Our best intelligence suggests that he’s actually trying to make the weapons faulty enough to cause minor damage the suit.”
“I’m not sure why, Tony. I know you still don’t want to discuss bloodwork and I’m not pressing for it, but it’s possible that the longer you spend here, the more you’re taking on some of the biological aspects of orientation. Cells are constantly regenerating, after all, and—well, you can tell me if and when you’re ready to investigate that option further. It is also possible that even without those elements of submission, it’s still something that your mind needs and desires badly enough that it just…eliminated information that it didn’t, at least on some level, want to hear.”
Tony continues his D/s education, this time with Clint, Natasha and Phil. Steve encounters a surprise on his mission with Talia.
“Honestly, buddy, I don’t understand it either. Only parts of it. But I do know it’s damn good to see you.”
Every bit of the effort had been worth it. Thor’s head was tipped back, cock jutting proudly at a near ninety-degree angle, cradled by another knot of rope. He didn’t ask for relief on that front, however. Thor wasn’t asking for much at all; he’d been practically non-verbal since Steve had actually gotten him in the air. His pleasure seemed beyond the usual expansive poetics that Thor carried from the battlefield into the bedroom, a quiet sort of ecstasy that felt almost improper for a human to witness.
“Alright, who had ‘Steve gets distracted from the issue to rant about the amorality of class-discrimination?’ Everybody else pay up!” Money was exchanged with a hefty dose of good-natured grumbling, as it often was on movie nights. Tonight the pot went to Coulson, who always bet on the most idealized version of Steve. Bucky, loose-limbed and content after going down for Natasha the previous evening, was in the middle of calling Steve a communist when it happened.
It killed Steve just a little to refer to Tony that way, to not include himself in the dynamic. (Perhaps it was some kind of karmic retribution for the way the media had so often erased the rest of the team’s involvement with the other Tony when they talked about he and Steve.) But Domen had more than proven her point that Steve had a lot of work to do before he would be able to reach out that way, and it wasn’t fair to the team or to Tony to ask them to wait. And the smile that tugged at the corners of Clint’s mouth was worth whatever it cost.
Oh team, this was a tough but important one, and I hope it lived up to a lot of your hopes! And for those of you who have been waiting on more Bucky content for ages, we're finally getting there! Hooray!
The team battles Taskmaster, and Tony learns that skipping the subsequent medical check and debrief is not an option.
Content Notes: Underage, alien-booze drinking (accompanied by a lot of vomiting.) And the usual warnings for a grieving, hurt teenager.
“Oh, he didn’t—right. I guess he wouldn’t have. He had you.” Steve didn’t know if it was time or subspace or both that softened the harsh anger with which Tony had once spoken of the differences between he and his alternative self, but Steve almost wished for that rage over the quiet, calm acceptance that coloured Tony’s voice now. “It was…uh, seven months after New York, and I…I was a bit of a mess. Kept seeing them, the Chituari, space, wondering what else…” He trailed off for so long that three of the Dominants in the room (Nat, Phil, and Steve himself) were halfway to their feet to check on him before Tony started up again. “Started building suits and I couldn’t stop, not even when I called one to bed when Pep and I were in it.”
Tony vanished with the kid shortly thereafter, guiding Peter down the hall and into the penthouse’s best guest room with the kid’s bags slung over his shoulder. Steve watched them go with equal parts dread and anticipation. Bucky bumped a friendly shoulder against his own, and though he was smiling when Steve met his eyes, he could also see his own worry and confusion reflected in Bucky’s face.
“I was passed a note this morning by one of your teammates.” Dr. Domen made quite the show of carefully unfolding a small sheet of paper. The neat cursive on the page was instantly recognizable as Natasha’s, and Steve restrained a groan. “'Despite his non-stop grinning, humming and general absurd merriment, I want to assure you that Captain Rogers did not in fact get laid recently and countermand your suggestion about not rushing into things'—not is underlined three times by the way. 'He’s just an idiot in love. If you could at least make him stop doing that stupid little half-skip when he walks, that would be ideal.'”
Peter experiences his first hangover, and promptly decides it will be his last. Steve speaks with an old friend…sort of
Across the room, a repulsor blast from one of the Iron Legion was immediately followed by the telltale sound of shattering glass. (It was downright distressing that Steve knew the sound of the Tower windows breaking without having to look. The fact that they had managed to convince anyone to permit the Avengers to take out insurance on the property was remarkable.) One of the seemingly endless henchmen screamed, begging for Taskmaster’s help before the sound was swallowed up by the now much louder noise from the street below. The man didn’t spare him so much as a glance, entirely focused on the prone figure beneath him.
“Gross. What am I, Nick? Nah, even Nick wouldn’t—not the point. They’re, it’s honestly mostly a social thing I helped organize. A place for enhanced kids to spend time with people like them. It’s technically through SHIELD, mainly because that allows me to extend them some legal protections if they happen to get themselves in too deep. And occasionally they send me footage from some of the training sessions they do if they want my input, but they spent most of the two sessions before this one playing some game based entirely around declaring people ‘sus.’ Sometimes I swear I barely even comprehend what your generation is saying, let alone what it means. Now come on! Science awaits!”
“Phil never punishes physically, that’s a hard limit of his,” Steve reminded Tony. Both his hands were on Tony’s back and ass now, pressing hard enough to almost be a massage, though he was probably checking for scar tissue or other no-go areas. “You also lied to us in a few different ways that we’re going to handle separately. Phil will be dealing specifically with the fact that you turned in writing to him that turned out not to be your own. Bruce will be taking care of the fact that you kept back medical information that had direct bearing on our ability to adequately care for you."
The check-in that Rhodey hustled him downstairs for was, at least, familiar, though Bruce’s punishment was really starting to get to him. Halfway through the process, he grew irritated enough with being treated as untrustworthy that he stopped bothering to answer Bruce at all.
It was, in truth, a bit of a face-saving question, given that the entire meal had been designed with Peter’s tastes and caloric needs in mind. In addition to the roast beef (which Rhodey had insisted on taking charge of, to the complaints of exactly none of his spouses), the table was practically groaning under the weight of all the side dishes: a massive casserole dish contained a mound of scalloped potatoes, which sat next to Yorkshire puddings and gravy, as well as several bowls of roasted vegetables including brussel sprouts covered in some kind of honey dijon sauce, mushrooms in balsamic vinegar and white wine, and beets with goat cheese and walnuts. May’s expression was distinctly guilty as she eyed the offerings.
Tony had been fairly sure he was pretty much out of headspace when Steve had panicked that morning. Seeing Steve, who had been so confident and calm the night before, clearly terrified and full of regret had been like a yank right out of subspace and into something more akin to the adrenaline-fuelled mindset of battle. All that had mattered then had been meeting the objective: fixing whatever was going so wrong in Steve’s head, twisting a night that had been as close to perfect as any Tony could remember into something ugly and wrong.
Tony spends a highly unpleasant morning with a member of the SI Board, and a far more satisfying afternoon in the park.
Tony didn’t bother trying to curb his enthusiasm at this particular bit of news either. Bucky had excused himself from any scenes involving Tony and pain thus far, and while they were all willing to accept it if this became a permanent boundary of his, Tony was delighted by the possibility that it might not be. He didn’t like having to choose between the presence of one of his Dominants and his occasional cravings for rougher handling.
The make-shift med bay that Bruce had established in the corner of the workshop was nowhere near the setup he had back in New York. All it contained was an exam table, which the team had produced from somewhere else in the house (Tony assumed the same place that the spanking bench had come from), and a black bag that was jarringly familiar. In his own world, it had been Bruce’s go-bag, a duffle that he’d never unpacked in case he needed to make a hasty exit. Here, its function appeared to be to ferry the medical supplies Bruce deemed essential enough to travel with; Tony could see an open box of nitrite gloves and the salve they’d been putting on his ass and thighs since the punishment sitting on top, though from the way the bag was bulging at the sides, there was plenty there that he hadn’t seen yet. Clearly, Bruce did not travel lightly.
“Not really. I’m, my head’s too frantic right now. I could go down to the shop for a while unless that violates any vacation laws.”
“Sir is not aware that the protocol tree for whose orders I should follow when receiving contradictory instructions was not re-written following his entrance into this universe. If he is made aware that by my coding my first allegiance should be to you, Captain Rogers, I anticipate that he will take it rather poorly. The last thing we need is him disabling my access to him, or using some of his more dubious methods to escape my monitoring. I can alert you on occasions when he is alone, but only if he has not yet requested that I avoid sharing that information. And I cannot…or rather, I am with your permission choosing not to provide you with any information that Sir has asked be restricted.”
“Do what? Get Liz to stop treating you with kid gloves? Shut Flash up? Prove to everyone else, including you, that you deserve to be in there?” Peter gaped. He made a nondescript scoffing noise. He dragged the rubber sole of his sneaker across the floor with an obnoxious squeak. Judging from the way his nemesis’s grin only grew wider, none of these served as the devastating counterarguments he had hoped.
. Nevermind dating Peter again, would she ever even want to catch a glimpse of him after all she had heard and witnessed last night? And what were the chances that suffocating himself with a pillow would actually be successful? “The first time I ever really had a crush on someone, I accused them of sleeping with another guy based entirely on a misunderstanding of what the word fondue meant.”
“Is it bad? To be a sub like Marnie?” For a long time Howard didn’t answer. And he did have a tendency to ignore questions he thought were beneath him, so Tony had already accepted it and moved on to thinking about something else when Howard sighed and put down the soldering iron he was using.
“She was…things were different, in my universe. Wanda was an Avenger. She fought alongside us.” Tony hadn’t thought much of the admission, and neither had most of the team. But he’d forgotten his drunken, rambling confession to Cap. Rogers had been mostly quiet through the conversation so far, but at this he sat up straighter in his chair and pinned Tony with a stare.
So naturally, he and Tony were entering the gates to the park in less than twenty minutes. Tony insisted on buying their meal this time, and he returned to the table with a truly staggering pile of food. There were not just hot dogs, but soft pretzels, garlic fries, churros, and what Steve suspected might be a deep-fried candy bar of some kind.
“Oh God, you’re the one who paid the bills,” May groaned, slapping her hand to her forehead. “I’ve been getting the runaround about this for weeks.”
He thought, very seriously, about begging Pepper to let him leave. It wasn’t as if he’d never done the incognito thing, he could go to one of his most remote properties and start over, maybe open up a little mechanic shop and live out his days fixing broken things. And there was little doubt in his mind that was how this would end, if he was lucky. But for now, he had made Pepper a promise. So he took a long, deep breath and strolled over to the bar. The ritual of making a cocktail was oddly comforting, given his relative disinterest in the booze itself. The sound of the ice tinkling against the glass, the colour of the bourbon, syrup and bitters swirling together in the mixing glass, it was exactly the same as it had always been. Well, almost exactly; there wasn’t any orange in the mini-fridge to garnish it, which made sense when he thought about it. If they hadn’t been using the penthouse much since Phony had died, of course they had kept perishables out of the fridge.
“Watch the video, Mr. Parker. I have agreed to stay until it has concluded to answer any questions the two of you have, but there is no use my repeating its contents beforehand.” Peter would probably have argued this point further, but then the space between he and Harley was filled by a projection, an image Peter couldn’t have looked away from if he tried. Tony sat on an unfamiliar chair. He looked a little sad, the way he’d basically always looked in the time Peter had known him best, but all traces of the physical damage he’d endured in the fight against Thanos were done. Even his arm, the one he’d used to snap away Thanos and his army forever, appeared gloriously whole and healed.
But that was precisely why this felt right, now. Steve’s offense had been one against Tony as a person, yes, and he could and would apologize for that as well. But his greater crime had been as a Dominant against a submissive, and so, he’d decided, he would start there with the profoundest signal of contrition a Dom could give a sub.
“I suspected from the way you described your reactions to the watch that Asgardian gold had slight healing properties for you. I had the palace’s best seamstresses weave it weeks ago, and this seemed like as good a test as any.” Steve looked at the placement of the blanket again and just managed to swallow a laugh.
She didn’t want to think of the picture she had probably made. Bare feet (because hell if she was putting on vomit-covered shoes to walk a couple hundred feet), breath that probably reeked of liquor to people with enhanced senses, and completely frantic? Yeah, in some ways she would have respected all of them a lot less the next day if they hadn’t gone all stony-faced and started demanding answers.
The existence of the Ultron technology is predicated on the supposition that artificial intelligence can and, under the correct circumstances should, be regarded as sentient and feeling beings capable of meaningful contributions to global security, communication, and wellness. However, this recognition also necessitates an understanding of the system’s moral and ethical responsibilities to other beings.
Most of the time he was able to push through enough of those feelings that he could turn them into something positive, like what he had come to learn as the difference between cold shame and hot humiliation. He went down to the shop, or to SHIELD, anywhere he could remind himself that whatever else he might need from the team, he was more than needy, hungry creature he turned into when he was with them. The days off from submission helped with that too, and the orientation-free dates; usually by the next day everything had slotted back into place in his mind and he was comfortable and happy with his role again.
“Mmm.  Aftercare can take all kinds of forms, some ‘floofier’ than others. Can we give a few a try, see if they work for us?”
“Oh, are you new here? Haven’t seen you around for ages.” Then she strode across the room and made a show of surveying Steve from head to toe. “You're more relaxed than I think I’ve ever seen you. It’s a good look, Director.”
“Let. Go,” Steve growled, letting every bit of Dominance he felt press into his tone the way he so rarely did, even during scenes. Tony tipped his head back and screamed as he came.
He went to his knees with all the grace and fluidity he could manage, attempting to mimic what he’d seen the others do. Then he found the housing unit nestled against his chest and pulled. It was warm in his hand, the same as it had been the last time he’d removed it and handed it to a version of Steve Rogers.
He hadn’t thought it would effect him quite this much; Tony loved and trusted JARVIS, after all, and the AI had regularly been the closest thing to a doctor Tony ever allowed to assess him in his own universe. But every time Bruce verified something Tony had said with Jay it was a shameful reminder of the fact that Tony wasn’t fully trusted right now. When he’d lied to Bruce in this space, one that the entire team (including, he could grudgingly admit, Tony himself) regarded as almost sacred, he’d broken something between them, something that would take time and effort to repair. By comparison, the immediacy of the physical punishment felt as if it had been miles easier to endure.
“What the hell did you do?” This was Clint as Tony remembered him from his own universe: thrumming with impatient, angry energy that so perfectly mirrored the tension in a drawn bowstring. Except this version of Clint was somehow not directing that rage at Tony, but rather on his behalf. “Things went so well today! And then you spend two minutes alone with him and—”
Bruce waited a couple of seconds, long enough to see that Tony didn’t plan to argue the matter further. Then he mercifully re-positioned Tony in a seated pose, his legs dangling over the edge of the table.
“Phoenix,” Tony grunted. Steve’s gut clenched and he hoped, again, that this entire plan hadn’t been a colossal mistake.
For both the third and fourth responses, you will also want to be up to date on the last update to the main verse to avoid some spoilers.
“I’ve got the team. And Tony, as much as he’ll let me. You stay focused on your mission, and preparing to start doing the really hard work when you get back. Because I am never doing this again, Steve. I don’t care what we have to do, I
Tony thought back on the last…god, had it really been almost an hour that he’d sat here, agonizing? Needlessly, apparently, since Coulson had only been waiting on Tony to admit that he couldn’t complete the work he’d assigned, not without assistance.
“Fuck yes!” Talia’s outburst was clearly unplanned, and when her mind caught up to her mouth she groaned. Masdee laughed. The sound was rich and warm and throaty, like the bold coffees Tony had preferred mixed with smoke and the flavourful foods of the world that Bruce so often cooked for them. It made Steve homesick.
“Aww can it, old man. Not all of us are hopped up on state-sanctioned steroids.” For a few glorious seconds, it was as if no time had passed at all. Steve was back in a DC townhouse, exchanging quips with Sam while he cooked Natasha and Steve breakfast. They’d been running for their lives, and yet it had been one of the happiest periods in Steve’s life after he’d woken up. Sam was kind and smart and capable, and unlike Tony whose presence back then had often left Steve confused and wrong-footed, he’d always known where he stood with Sam.
He had permission from Coulson to be doing this, now so it wasn’t the team’s privacy it felt like he was breaching, but rather Mark II’s. The signs of his love for them were achingly palpable in the documents. It spread through his notes (
On the other hand, it might make him more capable of giving the team what they needed. There had been a few times already lately when he’d been deep down in subspace that he’d wondered with a thrilled, terrified surge to his gut if maybe he was feeling the team’s Dominance differently, more intensely. The excitement felt like being right on the precipice of discovery, like the closest thing he’d ever found to the ecstatic glee he’d felt flying the Iron Man armour for the first time. He wanted access to the shared language that the bodies of those in this universe spoke without even trying; he wanted to stop wondering all the time what he might screwing up.
“Now’s the really fun part,” Bruce added, a light and teasing note in his voice which had been so heavy and sad just moments before. (Did punishment work that way for Doms, too? Did they really feel that relieved that Tony had atoned and been forgiven? A feeling of satisfaction that Tony could only compare to his rare experiences of being perfectly, comfortably full after a meal washed over him. He couldn’t give them so many of the things that a sub in this world could, but maybe he could still give them some of what mattered.) “Now we get to tell you what a good boy you are. We get to cuddle you and feed you and cocoon you in a hundred blankets and put some cream on those pretty impressive welts you’ve got. Maybe if you’re lucky we’ll let you up to pee, but if you’ve got anything more involved than that planned in the next day or so you’ll want to give JARVIS the okay to cancel it.”
“Pep, I want to help. I just…spaced or something, I’m okay, I swear I’m okay.” She reached over to squeeze his hand. Her smile was familiarity and warmth and Tony wanted to curl up in it until the churning feeling in his stomach passed.
Peter delayed long enough to pick up the sound of an incoming Quinjet and then began webbing his way toward Avengers Tower. Tony kept the line open between them, but he wasn’t speaking to Peter. He appeared to be doing about five other things at once, including preparations for locking down Stark Industries and Avengers Tower, doubling security at the hospital where May worked, speaking to a man Peter thought might be the director of the CIA, and making real-time adjustments to the tech the SHIELD team at the scene was using. Figuring the last thing Tony needed was another distraction, Peter had offered to hang up, but Tony had cut CIA guy off mid-sentence to growl,“Don’t you
“It’s not morphine. Doctor Tesfaye has some experience with enhanced kids, it’s why I had you brought here in the first place.” This was, Tony would have argued, barely a lie. The fact that he had been the one to give her the formula a few mights ago was a minor detail.
“Ugggh Dummy if this is some kind of bizarre punishment on your part, believe me I have already learned my lesson and then some, alright? You can stop with the Mary Poppins routine.” Confirming that he was awake, it transpired, was the worst thing Tony could have done. Upon receiving signs of life from Tony, the bot’s noise and activity levels both tripled, and he wheeled gleefully over to Tony and ripped away his covers. “Okay, seriously what is it with you and taking my blankets? Do you have something against my comfort? Oh god Dummy that noise is so much louder right next to my head. JARVIIIIIIS.”
He made his way down to Bucky’s floors, a heavy coat tucked over one arm. The other man sat on a long, padded seat in front of one of the massive bay windows, staring silently out at the grey sky and snowy streets. He seemed stunned to see Tony, which all but confirmed his suspicions.
The explanation made sense, and Tony was with it enough to know that, but being on the receiving end of such a strong dose of reality made him miss the weightless feeling he’d woken with all the more. Bruce smiled a little sadly at him as he finished up his checks.
“I think it’s under control.” Natasha pointed to a figure dressed in a blue and red…well, suit would be stretching it. The outfit was not nearly as advanced as even the earliest versions of their suits; Steve recognized the amateurish outline of a spider on the back almost at once from the pictures that had been given to him through SHIELD.
The thing about Bruce, though, was that he almost always zigged when Tony thought he was about to zag. (It was infuriating and incredibly arousing all at the same time.) When Bruce spoke, his tone was softer than it had been since Tony had walked in.
With one more guilty look around the room, Tony sank down to his knees. His nerves led him to drop a bit too quickly, and he winced as his joints protested vigorously. And even once the pain of that faded, it took some fidgeting and adjusting to make it comfortable; he had to figure out how much space to leave between his knees, and how to distribute his weight, and what to do with his hands. The whole thing was rather more complicated than the rest of the team made it look when they did this. Eventually, though, after some pretty undignified wiggling and grunting and shuffling, he settled into a comfortable position and allowed his eyes to drift shut.
“Howard.” It was one word, but it was perhaps the only one that could have caused Pepper to immediately call Rescue off. She came to stand between Tony’s splayed legs, expression so tender that for a moment it recalled another scene in another workshop just like this one. He’d warned her then that he was a piping hot mess; it hadn’t been enough to scare the other Pepper away yet, but she’d gone eventually. He’d been too much for her, like he was for everyone. But this Pepper had never tried to rely on him for romantic stability, had never silently hoped that Tony would become someone else, someone he wasn’t.
“Shh,” Clint soothed, his hands coming to rest on Tony’s knees and exerting the slightest bit of pressure, just enough to prevent his legs from reflexively shutting in an attempt to escape from Clint until he could regain some measure of self-control. Goose pimples were rising everywhere Clint’s breath fell, like Tony’s body was determined to help him leave behind traces of even the slightest touch.
Which was good news, really, and definitely shouldn’t have felt somewhat like being handed a life sentence. And it didn’t stop there. Dr. Chimva glanced at Rhodey, who edged several steps closer to Tony. (Good news never started with a medical professional wanting their patient supported by their loved ones.)
. They went to Sokovia, met…the witch, and her brother. She gave Tony, at least, the same vision as she did here, but he never told anyone because no one really bothered to ask. Ultron was born out of his panic and his exhaustion, and it nearly destroyed everything.”
I originate from the so-called MCU. I cannot yet share how I have come to access information from Stark’s new home universe, but suffice to say for now that my counterpart and I have come to an understanding of sorts.
“The fact that you’re not sure you’re right is what makes me confident that you probably are, or at least that you’re asking questions that are worth asking,” Tony replied. “What? You do have a tendency to dig your heels in.”
His resolve was put to the test mere seconds after he exited the elevator. The rest of the team was absent; now that he thought about it, Steve vaguely remembered something about an inter-galactic diplomacy training session at SHIELD that Nat was taking the lead on, and which Clint, Phil, and Thor were all attending. He wasn’t sure about Bruce or Bucky, though he knew the latter had lately expressed some interest in getting to know at least the basics of the team’s most commonly used medical procedures so that he could help out if Bruce was Hulked out and unavailable. Perhaps they were spending the day working on that together.
“Oh, just—well, when I first started trying to fill this out, I called Rhodey in a panic. He sent me to bed with a vibrator and a dream, essentially, and told me to go to town fantasizing about this stuff.” The way Phil choked on his coffee in response to that was entirely too satisfying. Even moreso was the visible struggle that played out on Coulson’s face afterward, like he wanted to take Tony right there and was just barely controlling himself. It was so rare to see Phil anything but smooth and contained, it felt like Tony had cracked some kind of secret code.
“Cap, definitely.” Tony had barely seen this universe’s Cap, so the surprised look Coulson couldn’t quite contain had probably made more sense than he’d thought at the moment. But he knew enough to be fairly sure he was still right. “They’re almost the same person, but with slight differences. They’re both strategic thinkers, and they’re both used to command positions so they’re good at directing troops and keeping people focused. But Cap is emotional in a way that the Air Force has trained Rhodey out of, whereas Rhodey is rigid when he sometimes needs to be flexible.”
As his system continues to level off, the majority of his time on vacation is likely to be fairly intensive in its focus on submission. However, part of what Coulson is trying to assess with the writing prompt asked Stark to begin thinking about in Chapter 49 is the extent and ways in which he’s currently imagining submission playing a role in his daily life.
Before long, Tony was sipping cold brew and trying to regain his will to live. Richards updated him on a number of projects that Tony knew for a fact the guy had vehemently opposed, and managed to work in no less than five passive-aggressive remarks about Pepper’s leadership, too. It was hard to let those ones pass him by, but he’d promised to use every advantage they had, including the fact that the Board was currently uncertain where exactly he and Pepper stood following his ‘return to the living.’ So far he hadn’t learned anything today beyond a highly selective, verging-on-inaccurate overview of SI (most of which Tony had known anyway), but he had a feeling Richards was saving what he considered to be his best point for last. Sure enough, as Tony started shifting in his seat and making offhand comments about having plans with his Doms later that day, it happened. Richards sat up and leaned in closer to Tony as if sharing particularly juicy gossip.
The remnants of adrenaline from the battle were still running through his system. Every time his mind replayed the feeling of having the arc reactor torn out of him (not out of
“That,” Tony grunted, “is a good question. There is literally nothing a boomerang arrow can accomplish that even a rudimentary AI linked to the shafts couldn’t manage way more efficiently, and with the added bonus of, you know, not getting shot by your own weapon. But I lost a bet with Clint, and this is some kind of weird lifelong dream of his.”
“She’s right, people are going to expect it.” The words sounded like they were being wrenched from Cap…from Steve. Like they cost him everything he had left, and Tony was not going to be the one to ever make any of them sound like that ever again.
“Make sure to have it sent in multiple shipments, and have some of them mislabelled. We don’t know how far into SI Fletcher’s people have infiltrated and we don’t want to raise any flags that don’t have to be raised,” Steve added.
Some of the owl’s foam had apparently made it through Natasha’s thick bodysuit, because her left forearm was covered in a yellow paste that didn’t fully disguise the angry redness of the skin beneath it. Her lip had been split, too, and her hair was matted suspiciously against the right side of her head. Tony didn’t dare stand yet, but he squinted as surreptitiously as it was really possible to squint, trying to get a better look. Natasha had never been one to accept being fussed over, so he expected some resistance to what he knew were, to someone with her training, probably laughably bad efforts at subtlety. But Natasha was too busy staring back, eyes darting between Tony and Steve as if trying to fit the single remaining piece into a puzzle where it just wasn’t fitting.
Ah, yes. I wondered if this might come up. (I’m also impressed that you know enough of the former Stark to be so confident, and correctly so, that he did not always manage to use safe words when necessary.)
It was almost frightening, the speed with which the steady beeping of the heart monitor had become a constant presence wherever Tony happened to be (which was almost always curled up on the bed in the aftercare portion of the playroom.) It was weirdly similar, in a way, to the white noise machine that sat, still pristine and unused, at the end of that same small bed; Steve vaguely remembered that some of the machines they had looked at (which had been aimed mostly at young children and age players) had had setting that were supposed to mimic a heartbeat. But now, instead of white noise serving as a soothing backdrop to a post-scene comedown, the low, mechanical beeping coming from the room’s speaker system served as the only evidence Tony allowed himself to have that his…well, a version of his child was alive and recovering.
Steve was aware enough after a few sessions to recognize the sounds of his temper flaring, and he made a grab for the super-soldier proof stress ball on the side table next to him. His fingers dug into the rubber and whatever the stuffing was made of (Tony had told him once, but he hadn’t listened well enough, had assumed like a fool that if he didn’t keep up with Tony when he got going about science the first time that he could just ask again later) offered the perfect level of resistance, giving just a little.
And if there had been any doubt before, that was the end of it, at least for Steve. Submissives craved routine, structure, order. It was another aspect of their Tony’s nature that the man had so often despised, because he found it to be so at odds with the processes of discovery and invention. Like most aspects of Tony’s orientational needs, they’d managed through compromise, bookending Tony’s large blocks of unstructured time in the shop and the labs with morning and evening routines that weren’t optional except in cases of world-ending emergencies. If making a daily schedule, of all things, had been the thing to calm this Tony down and bring him up out of what sure as hell sounded like subdrop, then he might very well be some version of a submissive after all.
As always, let me know if you have questions or concerns, or want to read around any of these sections.
“That’ll be Sir right now. But you’re on the right track, take all the time you need.” Tony growled and felt his legs try and fail to kick, held securely in the cuffs that kept them strapped to the leg rests. The unwavering kindness in Steve’s voice even as he landed stinging slap after slap to Tony’s ass was infuriating, at least as frustrating as the bench holding open and spread for Steve’s merciless hands. “Self-esteem,” Steve prompted.
“Why does it matter if I remember the good things? Doesn’t everyone? It’s not like there’s a point in picking a fight with someone who…who’s dead.” Domen made a quiet humming sound that Steve had learned meant she was really considering her answer; that felt reassuring, the fact that she was at least taking his concerns seriously and putting thought into her answers.
“Her name is Rescue,” Tony insisted with more energy than Steve even assumed he had left. When no one disputed the title, he gave a command sequence and the blue and gold suit abandoned its post and marched its way towards the elevator. Pepper sighed in relief, smiling tiredly at Phil as he made his way over to her, saying something about helping ensure the guest rooms were prepared.
“Much like you, I specialize in those initial stages, the building up after the wreckage caused by loss. I am more than you need, now, and that is a
His clumsy, aborted attempts to sit up and escape the wonderful pleasure that was Natasha’s grip on his cock were met with Natasha’s other hand planting itself on his chest. Once she had Tony on his back again, she was on top of him in seconds. This time Natasha took him into her with an almost painful gentleness, the loud slaps of their hips replaced with the quiet slide of bodies and sheets and the occasional gasp or murmur from one or both of them.
By short, terse agreement, the little trio made its way into Steve’s chambers. The second they were inside with the door securely shut, Masdee wasted little time. She sat down one one of the functional orange chairs that surrounded the small table in the corner of the living space, waited for Steve and Talia to do the same, and then addressed herself to the latter.
“Three, ma’am.” She’d kept the request number of spheres, slid the others back into the box, and then placed the remaining ones into Coulson’s cupped palms with a reverant, ritualistic air. Clint watched avidly, and occasionally reached out to toy with the collar around Coulson’s neck, but otherwise remained silent.
Once Coulson had murmured his assent and departed for his own floor, the questions fell from Tony’s lips before he could even consider whether he was truly welcome to be asking them.
Everyone else seemed to take this news with solemn thoughtfulness. To Clint (who, admittedly, should not have attempted to out-drink Natasha, especially with vodka) the solution was obvious.
It was Bruce that finally acted. Of course it was; Bruce had taken the time to be Tony’s friend while the rest of them were still busy believing the largely fictitious public version of Tony that he had clung to for dear life. Seconds after JARVIS’s voice had drawn that horrible, animalistic noise from Tony (seconds that truly felt like hours), Bruce was crossing the room in a few long strides. His skin was still dusted with patches of green from the nearness of his transformation. (But that made sense too. Tony was the only one Bruce ever truly trusted with the Hulk part of himself.)
Ah, yes. This will likely be one of my more frustrating replies, simply because several of these events have not yet happened. Some (particualrly the first gala, given the upcoming celebration devoted to Stark and his team) will be unfolding soon in the main narrative, so I will reluctantly allow the author to share them.
I know some of you have been waiting for this entire story to see representations of non-sexual submission. I hope it was worth the wait! I absolutely love hearing from you, so feel free to let me know any fave moments/lines, questions, wishes for future chapters, I gobble it all up with delight.
There were still numerous complaints, and addenda, and questions. Bruce wanted and received permission to check in with JARVIS once a day about Tony’s general health indicators. Natasha quizzed Rhodes about his plans for the coming days—would they leave the Tower, where would they go, how long—until he tartly reminded her that he was War Machine, not a hapless civilian, and as such would be perfectly capable of ensuring Tony’s safety regardless of what they ended up doing. Thor interrupted that exchange, which had grown somewhat heated, to wonder aloud if they’d done something wrong, made some kind of mistake in their handling of Tony. Tony smiled sadly and spoke for the first time in nearly an hour.
well together, pushing one another’s assumptions and biases away from both of their tendencies toward polarizing extremes. Since avoiding this Tony clearly wasn’t something Tony himself was going to permit, maybe establishing a strong professional relationship would be the best way to move forward. Steve held a hand out, then let it hang in midair as Tony arched a skeptical brow at him.
Tony, our Tony…he was a 1. And the last thing he would have ever wanted was to be in subspace all the time. But in order for him to be stable, to get what he needed, we had to find ways to integrate his submission into his daily life. Part of that was ensuring that he had frequent opportunities to spend time kneeling when he was in the common areas with other members of the team. It was…it was a special time, for all of us.” Bruce cleared his throat as if he were choking back tears.
“Answer me. I can’t start until we’re both clear on why we’re here.” Tony wiggled impatiently, glaring at Bruce when the other man offered a patient, kind smile that clearly conveyed that the other man had no intention of contradicting Natasha’s orders.
Eek. Hope you all liked it. For those interested, MCU Tony's storyline was inspired by a pre-Infinity War fan theory about Tony having ties to the Soul Stone. Even though they turned out to be horribly wrong I loved those theories, and I wanted to experiment with what it might have meant for them to be right while still keeping some aspects of Endgame relatively intact. The storyline is also inspired by the Iron Man comics. Without getting too spoilery for those who want to read them, Howard and Maria Stark's troubles conceiving are canonical.
Bucky squeezed Tony's hand, as gentle and cautious in his touch now as he’d been brutal and unyielding that night on the road when the same metal hand ended the lives of Tony’s parents.
Everyone on the team had noticed the intermittent tremors that shook Tony’s left hand, and had taken to quietly experimenting with how to prevent them, or at least reduce their intensity. When Steve made a breakthrough in the area, though, it had been entirely accidental. He’d been in bed next to Tony, who had started exhibiting early signs of disturbed sleep. Steve had started rubbing soothing circles onto the nearest part of Tony he could reach, which had happened to be his left elbow, and had been happily stunned to see his partner immediately begin calming. The trick wasn’t foolproof, but it seemed to help the tremors and other minor upsets; the touches also had the side effect of drawing contented little grunts and sighs from the submissive, as well as information if he was awake. The latter was mostly what Steve was after, and the gambit paid off.
The reply was almost instant. Steve had sent his own picture, depicting himself walking what looked like the NYU campus in his usual not-actually-incognito spy outfit (a baseball hat and sunglasses.)
“James is here, Tony, remember? That’s fine with me if it’s okay with the two of you, but I just want to be clear since we haven’t had much of a chance for an in-depth conversation about his role yet.”
In terms of process, the way I write has really shifted since I started a couple of years ago. My ageplay verse was mapped out in extreme detail. This was necessary in part because I was juggling so many POVs and storylines in that one. But it was also because I was new to fic writing and needed those kinds of outlines in order to feel confident that I was heading in the right direction.
Tony truly wasn’t trying to step on a landmine. Sure, he sometimes liked pushing Steve’s buttons, that part of their dynamic hadn’t completely vanished in the new universe, but needling Steve was about the last thing on his mind when Steve had just recovered from the last remnants of his drop that morning. He’d really just been trying to make light, airy conversation while they munched their way through a bag of Chicago popcorn mix.
Need for air finally overcoming his desire to remain attached to Steve’s cock, Thor lifted his head and drew a deep, gasping breath. Then he settled his head against Steve’s thigh, pressing a pattern-less mess of kisses and bites against oversensitive skin.
