"No!" cried Gamora as she was being dragged to the altar. She tried in vain to break from his grasp, much like she tried to pull free from the Blcack order knight so many years ago, but, pain showing clearly on his face, he threw her over the edge, and watched sorrowfully as she falls to her death. Light pulsed overhead as the sacrifice is correctly accomplished.
Thanos curled his gauntleted fist, activating both the Power and Space Stones, scowling—causing Nebula's already extended pieces to stretch further outward. She began to scream.
"Her?" He jerked back, eyes wide in shock. The wedding, the celebration. The Dawn Bringer had been planning the event for a century and was going to marry a powerful Celestial with many mortal worshipers and, and…it was the Sun Soldier?
"WHAT?!" said Tony, since he disagreed with Pepper's warped view on Leyenar. "Are you cray-cray?! She's the best girl in the whole entire universe! If you talk about her that way again, I'll use this on
Palpatine:Ant-Man will go molecular between time and space, and come back in the past meeting up with Captain Marvel, and they will work together to destroy Thanos in the sequel.
And so, Darren joined forces with the Guardians Of The Galaxy(plus Ronan The Accuser) to go against his concept, and he WON! The universe changed, and the only thing left was ultimate salvation...or so everybody thought.
Deep inside, Tony had always known that paying for reconstruction and smiling at a few cameras wouldn't be enough this time around. He had known that something had been in the works, had known that, come the time, they would have to face the consequences of their actions. For a long while now, it was just a matter of when and in what form those consequences would be laid bare for them.
Truly, this is what made him so awesome. The Celestial Monarch loved without barriers:he loved Everything and all that was entailed. I believe that once, he even loved the Children of Darkness:Galactus, Dormammu, and myself. All of the One Above All's creations were precious to the Shining Lord, but there was one who he loved to no limit, no act of his could have derailed the passions inside him. To love him, the act was inscribed into his bones.
A car crashed in on a pole behind Tony, who put on his sunglasses and asked FRIDAY "What am I looking at?"
Inside the ship, Ebony Maw walked among the bodies of dead Asgardians. Heimdall, badly wounded, reached out as if he would stop Maw as he passes, but lacked the strength. Maw stepped over them with no mind as he spoke, as if they were scattered pieces of dirty clothing on a bedroom floor. Hear me, and rejoice. You have had the privilege of being saved by the Great Titan...You may think this is suffering...No, it is
Inside the hall, quiet footsteps echoed as the One Above All worked. There was the soft hum of the creator, a pleasant sound; it resonated with the planet and its people for seven days and seven nights. During this time, the Celestials held a great festival to celebrate the One Above All. There were many feasts and much dancing, voices rising in song and praise, and all the world thrummed with the excitement generated throughout the multiverse. Finally, all noise ceased into silence. The people crowded outside the temple, excitement growing high, as their gift was delivered.
" Rocket warned. Groot rolled his eyes. The Benatar decelerated, and Thanos's devastation suddenly covered the Guardians' field of view, revealing the distress signal to be the one from the Asgardian vessel at the beginning of the movie. Bodies were seen floating dead in space along with the pieces of the shredded ship.
"All right, Guardians. Don't forget, this might be dangerous, so let's put on our mean faces." said Star-Lord. Groot rolled his eyes as Mantis made a snarl. Groot's handheld Terran-vintage video game beeped. "Groot, put that thing away. Now. I don't wanna tell you again." The game continued beeping. "Groot." said Star-Lord.
He'd never had a best friend before, but he had fallen into the Sun Soldier's life like he was a missing piece. It was shocking how well they fit, laughing together, playing tricks and pranks, challenging each other with stupid dares. Even when the Soldier was shy or reluctant, the Prince could always coax him into trouble that more often than not resulted in them running for their immortal lives, chased by angry spirits or annoyed imps.
"Yeah. You know what there should be? No more surprises. We're gonna have a nice dinner tonight. Show off this Harry Win-stone. Right? And we should have no more surprises. Ever. I should promise you."
"Y'know what?" said Star-Lord. "You guys have NO feel for dramatic tension!" He then closed his eyes and pulled the trigger, but instead of laser beams, bubbles came out. Thanos was playing him.
he still remembered the day she called Rhodey a "nigga" and received a knuckle sandwich from Nat. Afterwards, everybody began laughing at Pepper, and she had run away with her tail between her legs.
Thanos' face expressed surprise briefly before he pressed the gauntlet to Thor's left temple. The Power Stone glowed brightly. Thor screamed hoarsely.
"This boy, he was born to shed blood." An Elder announced, pleased, to the others after the Shining Lord's favoritism became apparent. The Moon Prince, however, was quiet as he watched his brother. This child, he saw, did not once take his eyes from the King, even as he fought vigorously against those with much more experience and skill. Despite the lack of equal talent, the child was winning his rounds. In his chest, the boy's heart had slowly begun to thump in rhythm with the Lord's own heartbeat: it was an unconscious action, nearly impossible if one was not of holy origin or destined to share a fate.
"How could you marry her? How did this happen?!" The Moon Prince paced back and forth with his hands in his hair, trying to make sense of the world. The Sun Soldier was so kind and caring, he was gentle, he loved too much. He was brilliantly smart and funny. He was lonely, how could he have ever met the Dawn Bringer? It wasn't possible, this was just some kind of joke. He looked at the Soldier, silently pleading with him to deny it.
"Not to each other." said Vision. "Wanda… For two years, we've stolen these moments, trying to see if this could work. And...I don't know. You know what, I'm just gonna speak for myself. I, I...I think..."
"Now what did I say about that big mouth of yours?" he said before Pepper could say anything racial. "I will come back, and, true to the director's words, I will surely deliver a rocket punch to your pudgy face." And, with that, the connection was shut off.
"I could lose a lot. Me personally. I could lose a lot." said Rocket and revealed an artificial eye. "Okay. If fate does want you to kill that crapsack, you're gonna need more than one stupid eyeball." He then gave the artificial eye to Thor, who asked where did it come from.
STARK—Howard Anthony Walter and Maria Collins Carbonell are proud to announce the birth of their son, Anthony Edward Stark. Anthony was born on May 29th weighing 7 pounds and measuring 18 inches. Visitors are asked to call ahead.
"Oh, and I suppose you lot have been following the Dawn Bringer around looking for her fiance, him?"
"Yes, but there are more than two trillion neurons here. One misalignment could cause a cascade of circuit failures." Shuri explained. She then turned to T'Challa and said "It will take time, brother."
The Shining Lord was watching the crowds with excitement, but there was something in his chest that beat wildly. His skin felt as if it was burning, itching—someone's gaze so heavy that the Lord felt as if it had penetrated to his bones. A young warrior looked up, blue eyes glimmering in wonder, gazing at the Lord wide-eyed. He was the Moon Prince's younger brother. The Lord, in turn, found himself pulled to the contender, unable to see his fate as his advisers did. He merely saw his brilliance, shining like a star under his sights. It was an instantaneous desire, driven by Fate, racing through their veins; the kind of want that neither could recognize, but desperately ached to fulfill.
Palpatine:Well, everyone, it has been a long time coming but it is finally time for our janitor, Thanos, to finally go out and make a name for himself.
Thanos said, "You're quite the fighter, Gamora. Come. Let me help you." He offered his hand, she wrapped her little fingers around one massive finger, and he led her to a pavilion, where he crouched to her eye level again and produced a small—for him—red-jeweled handle. He pressed the switch, razor-sharp blades popped out both ends. "Look. Pretty, isn't it? Perfectly balanced. As all things should be. Too much to one side, or the other…" He balanced it on one finger, overbalanced it purposefully and caught it, then gave Gamora a try. Meanwhile, Ebony Maw was outside, proceeding the execution. One half of the crowd got shot down. The survivors screamed in horror, and Gamora tried to turn but Thanos prevented her from seeing the massacre. "Concentrate. There! You've got it."
Meanwhile, Leyenar was experimenting with the Time Stone. Suddenly, she opened her eyes with a jolt.
Your soulmate understands and connects with you in every way and on every level, which brings a sense of peace, calmness and happiness when you are around them. And when you are not around them, you are all that much more aware of the harshness of life, and how bonding with another person in this way is the most significant and satisfying thing you will experience in your lifetime. You are also all that much aware of the beauty in life because you have been given a great gift and will always be thankful.
"Hmm. Huh? Oh. I would've washed that. The only way I could sneak it off Contraxia was up my..." Rocket was cut short by a beeping sound. "Hey, we're here!" he cried.
"Mother!" yelled the girl, then punched the arm of the one dragging her who surprisingly dropped her arm and left.
The fact that we cannot categorise Stark at first appears to be something of a trivial aspect. After all, one would say, a thing is not changed by its label. It does not matter whether we consider Stark a mutant or a superhero, especially since the man himself would probably resist either classification. This would, however, be grossly underestimating both the symbolic and physical impact of people like Stark and their counterparts like Iron Man. The symbolic impact is obvious - if Stark is a superhero, this gives him a certain authority, as well as an implied mandate for physical action. Captain America acted on a mandate given to him by Command, which in turn had a mandate to give orders because the USA had declared war on Nazi Germany. Although the US is embroiled in several conflicts abroad, including that in Afghanistan where Iron Man was allegedly first created, Stark carries no such mandate. This would not change even if it were revealed that Stark carries the X-gene. Mutants, after long decades fraught with tension, are now required to be taught and schooled in their powers, and cannot carry out violent actions without belonging to an officially recognised group - of which there exists only one, the X-Men, who are mostly concerned with policing their own kind.
Tony hesitated, before pulling out the cellular phone Steve mailed him, muttering 'flip phone'. It seems as though he brings it everywhere, always ready to call his lost lover. Before clicking "Call", he paused, distracted by an unusual rumbling. "Say, Doc, you wouldn't happen to be moving your hair, would you?" he asked.
"Seems like I'm always thanking you for something." said Steve as he shook hands with the Black Panther, while Bruce bowed awkwardly.
Loki glanced at Thor like he knows something he doesn't. He lifted his right hand into the air and the Tesseract revealed itself.
"I don't think this rig has a self-park function." said Tony. "Get your hand into this steering gimbal. Close those around it. You understand?"
"Yeah, don't start celebrating yet, guys. We got more incoming outside the dome." Rhodey declared, having taken down three more ships in full War Machine armor. The shockwaves and debris from the ship landings destroyed acres of forest and boiled up against the dome. The lab had an excellent view of the landing sites. Captain America and Black Panther looked at each other in concern over the scope of what they'll be facing.
Iron Man walked past Dr. Strange, shaking his head and with his armor retreating into its containment as Dr. Strange got to his feet and donned the Cloak again. "We've gotta turn this ship around." the doctor insisted.
Bruce gave Tony a desperate hug, without answering. Leyenar understood, since she could feel that he went through a lot. And so, everybody except Pepper headed back to the Sanctum Sanctorum. "From the dawn of the universe, there was nothing. Then, boom! The Big Bang sent six elemental crystals, hurtling across the virgin universe. These Infinity Stones each control an essential aspect of existence." said Wong, using magic to show the universe and five out of six Infinity Stones.
With a thump, Thor's body got plastered to the hull of the ship. "Wipers! Wipers! Get it off!" yelled Rocket, shaking his hands wildly. Thor's remaining eye opened, and everybody gasped.
"I got it figured out. We got two ships, and a large assortment of morons. So me and Groot will go with the pirate-angel here, and the morons will go to Knowhere to try and stop Thanos. Cool? Cool." Rocket insisted.
"Go back to the pod." Thor said uneasily, then all of a sudden, a gigantic figure appeared out of nowhere and flung Thor away with one swing of his arm, then kicked Rocket and Groot against a wall of equipment.
"Oops, sorry." said both Tony and Strange as they turned to the director, scratching the back of their heads. Leyenar smirked, and began a frenzied introduction of everybody to everybody.
" The Mad Titan was quite alive and undamaged, and the red Reality Stone was already seated in the Infinity Gauntlet.
"Then I'll take it off your corpse." said Maw. He pulled Strange away from the building and threw him to the ground. Strange started the gestures to use the Eye of Agamotto, but utility cables first pinned Strange's arms, interrupting the spell and closing the Eye, while another cable wound around his torso, then tightened around his throat.
"Look, this is my ship. And I'm not goin' to…" Star-Lord paused mid-sentence, then said "Wait, what kind of weapon are we talking about here?"
"I promise, Director, you can have the Time Stone after we finish this." said Dr. Strange. Leyenar gave him another smirk.
Thor awakened, sat up violently and threw himself off the table to stumble a few steps away, then turned to see his hosts all pointing their weapons of choice at him; Groot is still playing his game. "Who the hell are you guys?" asked Thor.
"Admit it. You should have ducked out when I told you to. I tried to bench you. You refused." Tony fired his own retort.
taught you to lie. That's why you're so bad at it." declared Thanos. "Where is the Soul Stone?" When Gamora refused to answer, he raised his gauntlet next to Gamora's face. Nebula shook her head, expression terrified, to encourage her sister's silence but when Gamora didn't answer, Thanos clenched the gauntlet again, brow furrowed at his adopted daughter as the Power and Space Stones got reactivated. Gamora grimaced in shared pain at her sister's screams, growing louder as Thanos increased the pressure.
"Look anything like that?" True to Rocket's word, the thingy looked exactly like the Infinity Gauntlet.
So in the days after Lagos, the emergency plan they'd formed in case of another incident rolled into high gear the instant Tony, Maria and Pepper had started making phone calls. They had split into groups and had set up round the clock attendance, trying to keep the truce with the UN intact.
Back at Nidavellir, Eitri was showing Thor, Rocket, and Groot the mold for Stormbreaker. "This is the plan? We're gonna hit him with a brick?" asked Rocket.
Tony drew in a shaky breath. "Come on. We got a situation." He led Peter over to a viewpoint on the torture below. Peter crouched to study the situation, the Cloak leaning over his shoulder. "See him down there? He's in trouble. What's your plan? Go."
"NOOOOOOOO!" screamed the Hulk. Bruce fell back exhausted into his tree, and said, "Whaddaya mean, "no"?"
"Your powers are quaint. You must be popular with children." he said, as he attempted to grab the Eye Of Agamotto but jerked back when it burned his hand.
"If he gets all six Infinity Stones, he can do it with the snap of his fingers, like this." Gamora said as she snapped her fingers.
"Hang on, kid." said Iron Man. Black Dwarf's hammer doubled as a claw, pinning Tony to the ground and shorting his suit. As Dwarf jumped towards Tony, blades ready to end this fight, he got sent through a portal instead. The alien turned and leaps to return the same way, but Wong closed it rapidly—only Dwarf's severed hand made it back to the park. Bruce kicked the hand away with a noise of disgust.
"Tinkle in the cup. We're not looking. What's there to see? What's a twig? Everybody's seen a twig." Rocket said.
A mechanical hum grew louder as Tony approached the intersection. As he turned the corner, he saw a huge circular ship floating over Bleecker Street.
"AH! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! PLEASE DON'T PUT YOUR EGGS IN ME!" cried Peter, then shot web at Mantis in a panic, pinning arms to her body just before Star-Lord flew at him feet-first, kicking him away.
"It's just...you can't be a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man when there's no neighborhood." After saying that, Peter waited for Tony's reaction. "Okay. That didn't really make any sense, but you know what I'm trying to say."
"A confession would be nice." The suggestion, casually made, sounded almost like it could have been given from a friend. "A retraction on camera would be even better. You could even donate to a charity for displaced families since the clusterf*cker that hired you has destroyed more homes than the Avengers could have ever dreamed. Of course," and the tone turned bitter, "that was never the purpose of anything done. As you f*cking well know."
"Mother! Where's my mother?!" screamed the girl from earlier as a soldier dragged her through the crowd.
Yes, the Moon Prince is the past life of Ronan The Accuser. Him and the Sun Soldier, Star-Lord's past life, will be introduced properly at the same time as the Guardians.
This brings us back to Tony Stark, who has declared himself Iron Man. By itself, this is not remarkable, although excited chatter from my more scientifically-minded colleagues tells me that Iron Man's flight capabilities are extraordinary. What is puzzling is the attempt, and subsequent failure, to categorise Tony Stark and Iron Man. He is not a mutant, as far as we know, and Iron Man does not appear to require or use special mutant capabilities, unless they are those of flight. Neither does Stark appear to have been enhanced somehow. He is not superhuman, except if one considers genius a superhuman trait. So far, these are the only two words we have (and have needed) to describe people who can do things normal people cannot.
"I should have told you, I just didn't want to lose you." He sniffed and rubbed his face on his arm.
"Oh, boy. Adoptive father. Technically, she hates him as much as you do." said Star-Lord, and Thor calmed down instantly.
"Not anymore." replied the colonel. Just then, the fugitive Avengers entered the room, Vision supported by Sam. Steve was the first one to get in and address Ross.
She had forgotten that some people would have a little more time on their hands to do some digging. Things had come full circle and she wouldn't escape the truth this time.
"No, Vision. Vision, if that's true…Then maybe going isn't the best idea." Wanda pleaded, then suddenly Corvus Glaive appeared behind Vision, stabbing him through the back. Vision screamed, loses his disguise to return to his green, red and gold appearance, and got thrown down into the street. Wanda, enraged, circled her hands, gathering up energy for a counterattack when Proxima Midnight blasted her from behind, knocking Wanda across the street and through a bistro's window.
Long ago, when the Shining Lord ruled the multiverse and all was peaceful, a child was born to the ruler of Heaven. He was a beautiful child, smart and kind, with a streak of wild recklessness his father called bravery. His name was Moon, Prince of Heaven.
"There's six stones out there." said Thor as he finished rummaging. "Thanos already has the Power Stone because he stole it last week, when he decimated Xandar. He stole the Space Stone from me when he destroyed my ship and slaughtered half my people. The Time and Mind Stones are safe on Earth. They're with the Avengers."
"That makes sense." replied the boy, then passed out due to lack of oxygen. Suddenly, a pod jumped out of nowhere, catching him mid-air. And then Peter was enveloped in a shiny new suit. Now being able to breathe, Peter landed on a bottom part of the ship, standing up heroically. "Mr. Stark, it smells like a new car in here!" he said.
"Who's there? What are you talking about?" Her questions tripped over each other, voice quavering more than she truly wanted to admit. At that moment, the voice was recognized, and her hands began to shake.
Star-Lord glared at Thor's hand on Gamora's shoulder, on the verge of full snarl, and moved around her to push between her and Thor. "And I feel your pain, as well. I mean it's not a competition, but I've been through a lot. My father killed my mother, then I had to kill my father. And that was hard. Probably even harder than having to kill a sister. Plus, I, came out of it with both of my eyes—"
Bruce cut in. "Okay, guys, could we table this discussion right now? The fact is that we have this Stone. We know
"Give up the Stone, and she lives." Corvus told Vision, who flew with Corvus to the roof of what appears to be a church, ricocheting off the stone church tower and onto the metal-clad roof. Simultaneously, Proxima and Wanda fought below, staff weapon versus magic energy hands until Proxima used the blaster effect of her weapon to knock Wanda meters away, stunning her as Proxima leaped down, brandishing her weapon within bare inches of Wanda's face, only held back by Wanda's powers. Furiously, Vision pummeled Corvus, then threw him across the roof, firing a beam from the Mind Stone. Corvus used his glaive to deflect the beam, splitting it into several beams, cutting up Edinburgh's ancient stone like butter, until one branch finally reflected back at Vision, slamming him into the wall behind him. Down below, Wanda has blocked Proxima's staff once again when she heard an agonized cry from Vision. Desperation strengthened her to throw Proxima through the burning lorry sliced in half by the split Stone beam, stunning the alien. Wanda then flew up to the roof where Glaive has pinned Vision and is again attempting to remove the Mind Stone.
"No. You simply lack the strength to wield them. Your bodies will crumble as your minds collapse into the madness." said Thor.
Sam had drove Daisy, Rhodey, Bruce, Steve, Natasha, Wanda, and Vision to Wakanda via quinjet. King T'Challa and the Dora Milaje approached to greet the arrivals. "In all honesty, when you said we were going to open Wakanda to the rest of the world... this is not what I imagined." said General Okoye.
As Black Dwarf approached the team, a slender, shiny nano-tech suit enveloped Tony's frame. He grew a shield on one arm to protect himself, then grew a set of blasters that easily threw the Dwarf back to Maw, who gestured and deflected his massive companion into some cars. Iron Man turned to Leyenar and said "Stay back sir."
He wondered often if going to the Sheriff and simply asking for shackles would be easier than trying to make amends.
"It's not helping your case, OK?" Pepper told Tony. That aside, she was thankful that they were finally together. That crazy director hell-bent on getting "Cap and Irah" back together was no match for the power of pure true love, after all. Also, she was fed up with that girl calling her boyfriend Irah. Thank goodness that Leyenar finally gave up.
"I'm not looking for forgiveness. And I'm way past asking for permission. Earth just lost her best defender. So we're here to fight." Steve replied. "And if you wanna stand in our way, we'll fight you, too."
"Behold!" The One Above All exclaimed. His great voice boomed across the universes, all His creation. "My son, the Shining Lord. He is given to life, as the High King of the Celestials and father to all whom I have created."
The question now becomes clear: where's the war that's given Stark his mandate? Of Stark is neither a superhero, due to the lack of war, nor a mutant, due to his lack of an X-gene, he lacks a mandate for action. Iron Man has been spotted at the site of several violent altercations both in the Middle East and in the US, but is not restrained by either national or international law, and can thus act with impunity. At this point in time, the obvious classification of Iron Man is a vigilante. Vigilantism, the diligent reader will recall, is illegal, and for good reason. Citizens taking the law into their own hands without the expertise of our first responders and legal officials are sure to undermine, rather than strengthen, the rule of law. Essentially, Iron Man is either an open invitation for any idiot with a spandex suit to take "justice" into his own hands, or an admission that those with money and power can do as they please.
The issue of proportionality is another one altogether. Our idea of vigilantism is based largely on literature, as it rarely occurs on a significant scale outside of fiction. In fiction, vigilantes are violent, but they are not killers. Out of the good of their hearts (or convenient alliances, or tragic pasts) they do not kill. However, fictional vigilantes are, without exception, violent in their attempt to remove injustices and "villains" from the world. Violence, as the modern film-going audience has become used to it, is sanitized, bloodless - with the obvious exception of horror-style crime movies like Pulp Fiction and the works of directors like David Cronenberg. It does not really bother us that violent justice has become a normative representation of justice, because we are so used to violence being a thing without real consequence. This is one of the reasons fictional vigilantes do not kill, as killing is an act with a definite consequence in the movie world. That being said, our real world is not like the movies. Even what we might be tempted to consider low-level violence has real and permanent consequences, and only inspires others to seek violent solutions to problems. This is the reason our justice system is not violent. Vigilantism thus undermines both justice and peace by perpetuating violence.
"And due to that fact, we're now in a flying doughnut billions of miles away from Earth with no backup." said Tony.
"I ignored my destiny once. I cannot do that again. Even for you." said Thanos. Gamora stared down unseeing for a moment, then up at the resolution on his face. She grabbed the red-jeweled dagger from his belt with lightning reflexes, triggered the blades and stabs herself in the stomach...except it was only bubbles.
Gamora took it, then hurled it across the room where it banged against Thanos' throne with a loud clack. "I always hated that chair." she declared.
Suddenly, Thanos' disembodied voice filled the room. "Is it sadness I sense in you, daughter? In my heart, I knew you still cared. But one ever knows for sure. Reality is often disappointing." Suddenly, utter destruction unfolded in front of everybody, and the Collector vanished without a trace. "That is, it was. Now…
Yellowjacket:You guys are overthinking this. He's just gonna get the support team. Put me down for Falcon, Ant-Man, Black Widow, Drax, War Machine, and Korg.
Captain America and Iron Man were scheduled to get hitched in 2019. It was a much-expected event, and everybody was looking forward to it...'till
Loki cheerfully emerged from behind the Black Order. " If I might interject…If you're going to Earth, you might want a guide. I do have a bit of experience in that arena."
Howard Stark yesterday celebrated both his marriage to Maria Carbonell, and the initial public offering of his company, Stark Industries (SI), on the New York Stock Exchange. SI has quickly built a global reputation for building weaponry for the US military and other defence contractors. The IPO was expected to raise $25 per share. However, at the end of the day shares were trading at closer to $20, indicating investors doubt the long-term durability of SI. In a statement, business partner Obadiah Stane stated that the company needed time to "settle into its full potential." Stark retains the majority of shares and as such full executive power. SI is a major US defence contractor and has so far made a profit every year since its establishment in 1956. Stark, who has long standing ties with the US military since WWII, was seen by our analysts to be in an ideal position to enter the weapons market. It remains to be seen how well he will fare.
"I assure you, brother... the sun will shine on us again." said Loki, as he offered the cube to Thanos.
"One side is a revelation. The other, an honor known only to a few." said Maw. The girl whirled around and found herself facing Thanos in his full Titan armor.
"Hey, we haven't officially met." Peter offered the Cloak his hand to shake. It ignored his offer and continued to Dr. Strange. "Cool." said Peter.
Back at New York, Bruce found Tony's flip-phone in the debris on the street and picked it up thoughtfully. Wong opened up a portal back to the Sanctum. "Where you going?" asked Bruce.
"I like to think of myself more as a Titan-killing long-term booty call. Let her go." Star-Lord insisted. "Or I'm gonna blow that nut sack of a chin right off your face!"
" replied the Titan, and he took her to an isolated chamber where Nebula was face-on, suspended horizontally in the air in the middle of the room, her breath shuddering in pain. Gamora was shocked and hurt to see her sister in such a vulnerable state. She hurried to Nebula's left side, only to see that she has been partially disassembled, her components stretched apart—a cybernetic version of the medieval torture rack. Truly, it was Hannibal Lecter level of brutality, as it was ranked in the Four-Dimensional World.
"Just stay out of his way, you know the Dawn Bringer has a temper." He warned, but the little kids just stuck their tongues out and danced around him in circles. Would Sun like to come to a wedding with him? The Moon Prince had never really thought about bringing him down to his home. Going up to the Sun Soldier's domains, he felt like a different person. He wasn't a failure, he was the eldest son of the ruler of Heaven. People thought he was important and more than that, the Soldier liked him.
If democracy sometimes seems slow and ambling, that is because it is weighted down with responsibility; if it sometimes seems callous and uncaring to the individual, that is because it watches out over society as a whole. It is vital to our nation that we preserve the institutions that uphold it. Nobody, not even Iron Man, should be able to avoid the law. Dura lex, sed lex.
"I counted on it. There's something we need to discuss, little one." Thanos replied. Gamora hesitated for a beat, then reached for her broken sword. Thanos grabbed her by the back of the neck and swung her around in front of him.
"Going to bed hungry, scrounging for scraps. Your planet was on the brink of collapse. I'm the one who stopped that. Do you know what's happened since then? The children born have known nothing but full bellies and clear skies. It's a paradise."
One girl came up, eyes wide in awe as she cuddled up to her big brother. "They say that her betrothed is powerful and rich, but we've never seen him."
"Don't you think that we should all have a weapon like that?" asked Star-Lord, and he knew that Leyenar would agree with him if she was here.
Remember, in Age Of Ultron, that little snippet where Tony's failed experiment integrated itself successfully to the Ultron program? It was because the Fates have decided the spirit of Ion shall inhabit that program, at least, in this AU.
"You already know." The tone remained remarkably even. "Have to admit, your timing was impeccable and your acting skills superb."
Seconds later, the Time Stone was seated in Leyenar's Infinity Gauntlet, safe and sound. The director began giggling maniacally, and declared
And so it goes. When Tony Stark, CEO of the former international weapons conglomerate Stark Industries, announced his identity as the mysterious vigilante, or, as he is now being called, "superhero" Iron Man, the world understandably went a bit crazy. Stark was kidnapped after a weapons showing in Afghanistan, and subsequently presumed dead. He reemerged after almost four months, with "Iron Man" in tow. After a public showdown with the "Iron Monger" at the SI campus in California, Stark announced that he is in fact Iron Man. But amongst all the speculation about Stark's time in Afghanistan and further personal life, the question most thinkers and historians are asking is: where's the war?
"All-fathers… let the dark magic flow through me one last...time." prayed Heimdall. Immediately, he summoned the Bifrost, which carries the Hulk away; he met Thor's eye.
"'Cause we're nice. And maybe whoever it is will give us a little cheddar cheese for our help." said Star-Lord.
Tony shook himself free of the Dwarf's weapon, now powerless. "Wong, you're invited to my wedding." he said.
Meanwhile, at Planet Hala, Supreme Accuser Ronan had just received a message from Carol Danvers. "WHAAAT?!" he roared. "I'll get you, Gamora...if it's the last thing I do!"
"We all think that at first." said the figure, revealed to be the Red Skull. He guided the other two to a temple-like structure at the summit.
"If you wanted to have a kid, you wouldn't have done that." said Pepper. She untied her boyfriend's jacket sleeves and tapped his chest attachment.
"Okay, and then you're like, "Oh my god, there's no bathroom, what am I gonna do?" "Oh! Someone's watching." "I'm gonna go in my pants." joked the genius.
"The price. Soul hold a special place among the Infinity Stones. You might say it has a certain wisdom." replied the Red Skull.
. Universal scales tip toward balance because of your sacrifice. Smile..." Corvus Glaive stabbed one of the lingering Asgardians. For even in death, you have become Children of Thanos."
"And in doing so, made you the fiercest woman in the galaxy. That's why I trusted you to find the Soul Stone." Thanos declared.
"Tree, pour what's in the cup out in space, and go in the cup again." said Thor, looking out the rear portholes.
LONDON - Everyone's favorite inventor and businessman was seen last night partying it up in London. Stark, spotted near the ME London, clearly had something to celebrate. SI is making him one of the richest people in the world. Although his net worth is undisclosed, it's estimated to be in the billions at this point. He was in London to receive the prize Clifford Patterson Medal and Prize, which he won because of his work in energy physics. However, it seems like Stark swapped out one prize for another! We're not sure who these lovely ladies are, but we bet that Stark would want to study their energy all right - enthusiastically, from the way Stark is pretty much undressed. Obadiah Stane, who runs SI for Stark, reportedly doesn't much care that his wunderkind likes drinking better than inventing - which he likes a whole lot. Stark was never arrested for possession of illegal substances, but the playboy is known for liking his fun. When our reporters asked him the morning after about the events the night before, Stark stated that he liked his social time the way he likes his science: "involving hazardous substances and preferably naked."
"Yeah, but the kid's seen more movies." Tony quipped. He fired a rocket from his shoulder which pierced the side of the ship to Maw's right and began to suck everything out with depressurization, especially Maw and his weapons. Dr. Strange got pulled loose of his pinnings, lost the needles, but also heads for the hole, helpless to resist. The Cloak wrapped around his arm and an anchor point, but Dr. Strange's arm slipped loose and he kept going. Spider-Man shot a web strand at Dr. Strange with one hand and held onto a piece of the ship with the other. It broke, sending them both towards space when his Iron Spider suit's metal arms braced him to keep him from being sucked out. Fortunately, Dr. Strange was still surrounded by the ship's atmosphere, making haste to leave. Immediately, Leyenar began roleplaying with herself.
"Not cool!" Peter groaned as he freed himself. Maw bent all the utility poles in the path of the fleeing Cloak, finally snagging the loyal garment and ripping it loose of its master. Spider-Man scooped up Strange before he hit the pavement, but before he can get away with the unconscious Strange, a cone of blue light started pulling the mage inexorably upwards. Spider-Man grabbed a light pole to anchor himself, but Maw uprooted it, sending Strange, Cloak and teenager on their way to his ship. "Uhh, Mr. Stark? I'm being beamed up!" cried Peter.
We begin our story of strife and glory in a local cinema, somewhere in South Korea. The year was 2015, and Director Leyenar Oh was just 12 by the time she first phased into the MARVEL Cinematic Universe. She somehow knew that she had been chosen by the One Above All, to bring salvation to everybody in the MARVEL multiverse. And that was when she was first introduced to Ultron—Yoshida Ultron, the Steve/Tony matchmaker, who went on a rampage, forgetting his true duties. Leyenar wondered for quite some time if she can ever get to persuade Ultron. That was when Hawkward's little daughter gave her hope.
Super-heroism is neither new nor limited to America. The most famous person we tend to think of as a 'superhero' is Captain America, the propaganda figure turned war hero who, as was revealed in a groundbreaking series of government leaks, was also the subject of a government experiment on creating superhumans. He is considered the first modern superhero because of these two characteristics. He is a hero because he, amongst other various feats, single-handedly rescued over 300 allied soldiers from a German interment camp, and crashed a bomber carrying dangerous material to prevent an attack on Manhattan. He is "super" because, although he began life as a (somewhat sickly) baseline human, and was (as far as we know) not a bearer of the X-gene found in mutants like Charles Xavier, a famous scholar and mutant advocate, after Project Rebirth he had baseline strength at least two and a half times that of a standard human, as well as enhanced endurance. Since Captain America, there have been few such figures, mostly because the science required to create him has been lost to history. What was thought to be an attempt to recreate the super-soldier serum, as the procedure is known, resulted in the destruction of a significant part of Culver University's Science Campus by a rampaging green beast known only as "Hulk" in 2005.
"For the record…I know that you're only going with him because it's where Thanos isn't." Star-Lord told Rocket.
"That's enough! We need to stop Thanos. Which means we need to find out where he's going next." said Gamora.
"This was meant for one big guy, so we gotta move at the same time." said Tony, and though their landing was a little bit bumpy, they made it to Titan.
But all his worries flew out the window when he found his best friend sitting outside. The Prince launched himself at him.
"Moon is in looooooove." They chanted as he finally swatted them away. "Who is it? Moon likes somebody."
More than a product of science, however, Captain America was a product of his time - both literally and metaphorically. World War 2 required new innovations in military technology, especially if these innovations could either prevent casualties or grant an advantage to allied soldiers - as the super-serum would have. Beyond that, the public image of Captain America was shaped by the propaganda performances required to sell war bonds and raise civilian morale for the war effort. After all, if there is no war, what is the use of a soldier?
Dr. Strange placed a hand on her shoulder. "Fear not, we will find them soon." He then showed her his necklace. "Here's one, should I give it to you?"
Drax, of course, was snoring with his mouth open from his seat in front of Star-Lord. Gamora lip-synched with the song along with Star-Lord. Actually, the "Rubberband Man" song was a distress signal.
"Something's wrong. The star's gone out. And the rings are frozen." said a surprised Thor, but the trio entered the forge anyway. No matter the circumstances, it was the right thing to do.
The Titan crushed the Tesseract, revealing the blue Space Stone. He blew some of the fractals away, fingering the Stone between his thumb and index, before placing it on the gauntlet, and was momentarily rocked by the surge of energy that pulses as the stone seated in its setting.
In the beginning, there was the One Above All. He is ultimate, the creator of everything known and unknown. One of His first creations was a powerful group of beings, the Celestials. Their intelligence was unprecedented in all the galaxies, for they were creatures born with superior knowledge and abilities.
"Nobody, go away." The Moon Prince made the scariest faces he could to shoo them away, but his siblings just laughed, too used to his moods to be afraid.
"The Time Stone and the director's been taken. The Sanctum remains unguarded. What will you do?" Wong asked back.
"A lifetime ago, I, too, sought the stones. I even held one in my hand. But it cast me out, banished me here. Guiding others to a treasure I cannot possess." replied the Red Skull, and they stopped on a semicircular engraving overlooking a sheer drop. It descended in three shallow steps to a final half-circle cutout, the whole bisected by a deep cut that ran between the two spires behind them. Far, far below was a full circle with similar engraved decoration. "What you seek lies before you. As does what you fear." said the Red Skull.
Ebony Maw walked towards the controls of the ship, Strange's unconscious body floating face-down behind him, and prepared to leave Earth's atmosphere, Tony hot on his tail. "Unlock 17-A." the billionaire ordered his assistant. FRIDAY immediately responded by launching a pod from the Avengers Mansion and shooting it towards the accelerating circular ship, somehow it caught Leyenar with it...or did
"Let us begin." The High Priest cleared his throat, letting a gauntlet-covered hand fall to the marble table before the elders and drawing attention to his impatient form. The Moon Prince, eldest son of the ruler of Heaven, nodded at the others, settling into the chair beside the High King. The Shining Lord leaned forward in his seat, gazing excitedly at the contestants until he sat on the very edge.
Well, during the time of the Celestials, it was the Star Warrior who made the mistake, but during the time of Leyenar, it's Tony who makes the mistake in Spider-Man:Homecoming.
"You were supposed to protect us. Asgard was supposed to protect us!" cried Eitri as he assaulted Thor.
"I'm glad you brought this up, 'cause it's nothing. It's just a housing unit for nano particles." replied Tony. Carol sighed, watching them from afar. She thought,
I stare out into the multitude of universes, watching the ebb and flow of Time as her mighty waves crash upon every solar system, every world, every species, every life...
"Tony, listen to me. Thor's gone. Thanos is coming. It doesn't matter who you're talking to or not."
"Only Eitri the dwarf king can make me the weapon I need." said Thor. "I assume you're the captain, sir?" he asked Rocket.
"No. Knowhere? It's a place. We've been there. It sucks." said Star-Lord. Suddenly, he noticed Thor rummaging through their food stores. "Excuse me, that's our food."
Palpatine:Okay, okay. Now that he's finally going to do something with his life, who's up for a little wager?
"I don't wanna hear another single pop culture out of you for the rest of the trip. You understand?" Tony told him.
"To ensure that whoever possesses it... understands its power... the stone demands a sacrifice." the Red Skull explained. "In order to take the stone you must lose that which you love. A soul... for a soul."
In the months following the battle with Ultron, the government had requested a meeting with Tony. Back then, he had convinced them that Ultron had been an individual mistake, a horrible one-time thing, and that, in the wake of what had happened, there had been no way to save Sokovia from destruction—that they had done everything in their powers to keep casualties at a minimum. And thus, a fragile truce was negotiated.
Meanwhile, on the ringship, Leyenar, Tony, Strange and Peter were nearing Titan. "Hey, what's going on?" asked Peter.
"Shhh. We'll be safe. We'll be safe." said a mother, hushing her child. An explosion ensued and the little girl screamed, causing a Black Order knight to find them. Outside, it was a total madhouse. Leviathans, Chitauri chariots and ring-ships flew overhead; explosions and energy bolts from numerous sources criss-crossed the panicked population, felling them randomly; smoke arose from countless fires.
Steve followed them with his eyes before waving as well. "Good night," he murmured, smiling into the darkness.
"Dr. Banner, if the rest of your green friend won't be joining us..." said Strange, then he teleported Bruce to to a nearby park along with half a taxi. Tony returned and joins the fight, pushing a car thrown by Maw back at him. Maw cut it in half and let the pieces fly past him, untouched.
"I don't think this thing works. Everything seems dark." said Thor, smacking his palm against the side of his head to get the eye calibrated.
Dr. Strange threw the Winds of Watoomb over Bleeker Street, and winked at Tony. The dust cleared. Tony got begrudgingly amused for a split second. Then Ebony Maw and Black Dwarf exited the ship by transmat. "Hear me, and rejoice. You are about to die at the hands of the Children of Thanos. Be thankful, that your meaningless lives are now contributing to..." Maw began, but was interrupted.
"No, Natasha and Rex are getting married," she said, lifting the doll in the air, followed closely by some stuffed dinosaur she'd jammed beneath her armpit.
"The heck happened to this planet? It's eight degrees off its axis. Gravitational pull is all over the place." Star-Lord exclaimed.
"No, you're not!" said Star-Lord, then he began faking Thor's voice. "You'll not, be taking our pod today, sir."
"Carol Danvers. Captain Marvel. She'd been the director's assistant since 2017, and the director requested her to bring a powerful army that can match Thanos's Black Order." replied Daisy.
The Fates nearly gleamed with the progress of their work:a work to revive the lives of the heroes' past bodies and the lives their souls had once endured.
"Vormir!" Gamora cried, and Thanos deactivated the Gauntlet, and Nebula gasped in air as she was pieced back together.
might have a choice. Your mind is made up of a complex construct of overlays. JARVIS, Ultron, Tony, me, the Stone. All of them mixed together. All of them learning from one another."
Tony latched onto the hull and cuts a hole to board the ship, looking for wherever Strange and Ebony Maw went. That was when FRIDAY came in. "Boss, incoming call from Miss Potts."
Vision seemed to shake a bit at the mention of Leyenar, but then swallowed the lump in his throat and retaliated "Captain, 70 years ago, you laid down your life to save how many millions of people. Tell me, why is this any different?" Steve took a breath, but before he had a chance to answer, Bruce spoke up.
"You know, I'm 1500 years old. I've killed twice as many enemies as that, and every one would have rather killed me, but none succeeded. I'm only alive because fate wants me alive. Thanos is the latest in a long line of bastards and he will be the latest to feel my vengeance. Fate wills it so." Thor explained.
"ZIGACKLY!" Thor bellowed. " Rage, vengeance, anger, loss, regret... they're all tremendous motivators. They really clear the mind. So I'm good to go."
"I know. I had the surgery. I'm just trying to protect us. The future uses, and that's it. Just in case there's a monster in the closet, instead of, you know..."
Tony looked at the Hulk-made opening through the ceiling and saw debris flying by outside. He and Leyenar exited the Sanctum through the front door and scanned the chaotic surroundings, the camera shaking around in this following long take to illustrate the chaos, people running and screaming in alarm, traffic becoming impossibly tangled, a litter-filled wind like a nor'easter's. A woman fell nearly at their feet and they helped her up.
"I like you." Thanos told Star-Lord, and then teleported himself and Gamora away. The Reality Stone's effects disappeared once they left.
"On it!" Peter chased Ebony Maw, floating speedily and upright on a small platform of burbling debris leaving a deep rut in the streets, who in turn chases the Cloak-driven Strange through Manhattan; Maw attacked him, throwing a Rocket Mortgage billboard at Spider-Man to be rid of him.
"THANOS!" yelled Drax as he flung a blade at Strange, who neatly deflected it with a mystical shield, and in return sent the Cloak of Levitation at Drax's face, half-smothering him and throwing him to the floor. Star-Lord and Tony had a brief dogfight until a magnetic disc pinned Tony face-first to a structure.
"Yeah." Tony crossed to stand right in front of Peter. "Right where I don't want you to be. This isn't Coney Island. This isn't a field trip. It's one-way ticket. You hear me? Don't pretend like you thought this through. You could not have possibly thought this through."
Maw called upon some weapons, and said "You've saved nothing. Your powers are inconsequential compared to mine."
Thor wasn't listening, and stared at the soup spoon in his hands. "I need a hammer, not a spoon…" He attempted to fiddle with machinery. "How do I open this thing? Is there some sort of a four-digit code maybe… Maybe a birth date or something…"
"Is that is what this is?" asked Tony, then the Cloak Of Levitation smacked his arm. Tony, looking offended, straightened himself and said "I ain't going to allow that. If Thanos needs all six, why don't we just stick this one down the garbage disposal?"
His brothers and sisters knew something was wrong by the moony look their eldest sibling kept sporting and the way he didn't chase them all away when they followed him everywhere or tugged at his robes for attention, which came to a conclusion.
"300 dwarves lived on this ring. I thought if I did what he asked, they'd be safe. I made what he wanted. A device capable of harnessing the power of the stones. Then he killed everyone anyway. All except me. "Your life is yours," he said. "But your hands are mine alone."..." Eitri said as he held up his his immobile metal fists, encased in hardened molten metal.
Star-Lord, Earth name Peter Jason Quill, was chair-dancing. He seemed to have completely forgotten about his lover, Ronan The Accuser, when he returned to Planet Hala, the Kree home world, to take care of business. "Sing it, Drax!" cried Star-Lord.
"It's true. You have gained a little weight…" said Drax, motioning to Star-Lord's chest and belly. Gamora left Star-Lord's side at Thor's right, and circled around the foot of the table.
There are no examples that I can draw on here to illustrate just how devastating the consequences of this would be. With the exception of the troubles with mutants in the late 1960's and 1970's, the consequences of which have been resolved and legalised, our country has a strong history of resting on it's democratic foundation and allowing the law to mete out justice in due course. In order for this to work as it has, we hold faith that the legal system is fair, both in the sense of equal punishment for equal crime, and in that of punishment in proportion to the crime. Justice, the personification of the law, is always portrayed with a blindfold because the law must apply equally to all men and women - this is one of the founding principles of our modern society, that everyone is created equal. While we may not live in a post-racial society, as some would like it to be, the guarantee that the law, at least, sees only your actions is a powerful thing. Vigilantism, enacted by individuals, and not the legal system, automatically voids this blindness principle. An individual, even if they were truly "good" and "heroic," is inevitably biased. Even leaving aside the moral issue and focusing only on practicalities, a vigilante cannot enforce equal punishment as the State, with greater resources and reach, can.
Gamora began to laugh at the irony of the situation. "All my life, I dreamed of a day... a moment when you would get what you deserved. And I was always so disappointed. But now... you kill and torture... and you call it mercy. The universe has judged you. You asked it for a prize, and it told you no. You
Thanos scowled, his egotistical narcissism preventing him from fully listening to her. "I'm the only one who knows that. At least, I'm the only one with the will to act on it. For a time... you had that same will... as you fought by my side. Daughter."
"Oh, no, your brother can't save you! You're mine and I will never let you go! I am the evil dragon and I love eating unicorn princesses!" Tony laughed along with his children and tried to get a hold of Harley on the other side of the giant bathtub.
“Thor, are you okay? This looks bad.” Steve asked with a crease between his brows. The dried blood and open flesh looked quite painful.
“Hi. And you're who exactly again?” Clint grinned at them and crossed his arms over his chest. “Hey, Tash, did you see that just now?”
“You got some lipstick here.” He brushed over Steve’s bottom lip with the pad of his thumb. “It looks good on you.”
Instead of answering straight away, Steve could only moan in response when those fingers continued to caress his cock and he involuntarily bucked up into the touch, rubbing his erection over the crack of Tony's ass. The finger he still had inside of Tony accidentally slipped out. He buried his face in the smaller man's wild brown strands and tightened his grip on Tony’s ass. "Not everything came out of a bottle," he chuckled throatily.
“This isn’t magic, for fuck’s sake. Just put your foot in the stirrup and pull yourself up,” Bucky explained and gesticulated with his one arm.
It took them twenty minutes until they had made their way to the one corner of the giant fair hall where Peter’s friend and photographer was waiting for them. She was a pretty young woman, chewing gum and laughing along with Peter when they hugged. A huge and expensive looking camera hung around her neck.
“And these two are my parents, Tony and Steve, but for today they’re Morticia and Gomez.” Peter introduced them. They waved at a smiling MJ. No matter how annoyed their teenage son liked to pretend to be, Steve clearly heard the amusement in his voice.
Tony probably should feel bad for his husband. But it was his nature to make a bad situation even worse. He just couldn’t not. Tony blinked at Steve and in lieu of answering the rhetorical question that was still hanging in the air between them, he pointed at Peter, who simply cocked his little head at his fathers. Steve frowned and rapped Tony over the knuckles with a magazine from the table next to him.
Gentle waves woke him from his daydreaming. Steve stepped into the tub right behind him. Tony skidded forward to make space for the broad-shouldered alpha to sit behind him, but was soon pulled back into his embrace by strong arms. For as much as the kids had begged their papa to join them, they were too occupied with playing in the warm water to disturb their parents at the moment.
"...are you sure, doll?" Steve questioned, slowly catching his breath after Tony had blown his brains out via his dick. But he needed to make sure. The blonde’s thumbs brushed over Tony's cheekbones, where he was still holding his face in his hands. Right this moment there was nothing that he wanted more than being inside of Tony, to feel his heat surround him and marvel at the picture of that cute ass taking in all of him, sure that it would be the best feeling in the world. Yet… "We can always just jerk off together?"
Steve’s own balls had tightened at the picture, but he held his orgasm at bay, too fascinated by the work of art that Tony posed on top of him. The white streaks of cum on his hand were warm and the smell reached Steve’s nose, almost numbing him.
The sheriff looked at him over his shoulder and raised one amused eyebrow. Tony scowled and looked away, feeling his cheeks heat up when he heard the rest of the sheriff’s group laugh at him somewhere behind him.
Tony turned around, slow and careful, because the mermaid cut dress wouldn’t allow him big steps. The black fabric hugged his husband’s body, accentuating every dip and curve. The long bell sleeves were entrancing. And as embarrassing as it was, but Steve found his eyes constantly drawn to the deep V neck of the dress, that almost went all the way down to his abs.
“But dad has a scar! So love does hurt!” Harley clung to Steve’s bicep and peered over to where his sister was.
"Show me what you've got, soldier boy. I want to see for myself if really all the things I've heard about you were just pornhub fairytales," Tony said and one of his hands sneaked back to his own butt. Before Steve could wonder what kind of porn videos Tony had watched in his life before, he felt careful fingers pass by the digit he had knuckle-deep inside of him and touch the head of the blonde's own dick. Tony's eyes widened comically and he stared at Steve in astonishment. "Holy shit, Steve, you're not just big, you’re huge! Was that a side-effect of the serum or were you just really blessed by nature even before that?"
“Yeah, I kind of messed this up big time,” Steve sighed and looked at Peter over his shoulder. “Good thing it’s gonna grow out soon enough.”
Dodger sat next to them and the dog watched them curiously. Steve scratched him behind the fluffy ears. Their dog also needed a haircut, now that he thought about it. Thank God Dodger wasn’t scared of the pet groomer.
I'll add links in the end note if you are interested what kind of species I gave the team members and how they look :D
He shook his head at himself to clear his thoughts. Tony had big plans, and none of them included Sheriff Rogers or any member of his stupid group.
But to his surprise most of the group just hummed their approval. Only Clint piped up. “The sheriff’s shirt is a little big on him, but other than that. It’s okay, I guess. At least you don’t attract that much attention with those clothes. Because that gown is, I mean,
“Both.” Tony smiled and yawned. He rolled over to lay on his side and rubbed a hand over his face. Then he just looked at Steve. The blanket pooled around their hips and Steve let the fingers of his free hand wander down Tony’s naked side until they reached the fabric.
On top of that Steve wasn’t blind. The moment he’d laid eyes on Tony for the very first time he’d known that he was in deep shit. Tony was very attractive, it was no use to deny that. And maybe Steve really did have a type. The Captain adored the engineer's dark hair and eyes and - good God - his ass. The things Steve wanted to do to that ass kept him awake at night.
In his mind he could already see it. A little house, a child playing with the dog, and his alpha sitting with him by the fireside. Tony would lean up and his alpha would kiss him gently.
Tony couldn’t hold back, he bit the man’s finger where he was touching his lips. The man yelped in surprise. He let go of Tony and slapped him across the face hard enough that Tony crashed into the floor.
Hazel colored eyes widened in surprise and realization, staring into his own and Steve saw Tatooine's two suns shining in them.
“Let’s just say… Some people know me from instagram and tiktok.” He grinned over his shoulder at them. Then he continued to point out where you could buy japanese sweets, comics, crafting materials and where you could try the newest games and consoles.
Back in the present, Tony took his husband’s chin in his hand and turned his head around so he could press a kiss to Steve’s lips. Satisfied, he felt his beloved husband smile into it, knowing that Steve didn’t really hate him for his little stunt.
Steve suppressed the urge to pull the man into another hug. He smiled a small, private smile and almost lost himself in the depths of Tony's eyes. “May the Force be with you.”
“No. You know what the boss said. Let’s go,” he ordered and pulled the man up. Then he guided his complaining companion down the aisle. Accent guy threw one last lecherous glance at Tony before complying. They were almost out of earshot when Tony imagined hearing the alpha say “You’ll get your chance at a good fuck later.”
He should meditate over the whirlwind of emotions in his chest and hopefully the Force would calm him. Maybe he'd even confess his feelings to Tony, if the right situation presented itself. His lightsaber swayed on his belt when he picked up his book from his spot in the grass, and made his way into the temple to his quarters. He couldn't await the ceremony and meeting Tony again.
“Come here, little troublemaker.” Tony gently pulled his daughter into his lap and brushed her hair from her eyes. He booped her nose and she giggled in delight. Smiling, he started to wash her hair. The four year old girl held perfectly still. She loved it when her father paid that much attention to her hair.
Steve let his gaze secretly wander over the scenery as he quickened his pace. Never before had he seen a more wretched hive of scum and villainy. And he had been on more ugly planets in his life than he could count. Tusken Raiders and Jawas were lurking in the shadows, slaves and their owners were strolling through the streets. Various alien and humanoid races were here, as well as the occasional Stormtrooper on his patrol.
“I guess it does,” Steve agreed and raised his head to lean in for another quick peck, smiling from ear to ear. He was so incredibly happy. “I’ll cook something nice for you later, sweetheart, promise.”
"Stop being annoying, Morgan." Harley leaned over the edge of the tub and rolled his eyes at his little sister. He had learned that from watching Tony for long hours. His sister turned to look at him and stuck her tongue out.
Peter had stayed with his aunt Pepper that night, because his parents had had very parents-y things to,
"Hey, Dad. Hi, Pops." Peter smiled at them from under Steve’s hand, and tried his best to look carefree. But there was a dimness to it, like he was carrying a weight.
Steve and the rest of the team were already used to his weird speaking pattern. The big hunk of a man was the last to join their team and probably the weirdest one among them. He'd once told them that he was about 1500 years old, had fled from his home planet Asgard when his brother betrayed him and stole his throne, to search the galaxy for his sacred weapon, which had apparently gotten lost in the war between the brothers. By the time when Bruce brought him to the team he'd just retrieved his hammer. It had a weird name, that none of them could pronounce correctly.
"Hey. You're awake." The voice belonged to the alpha sheriff, who sat down next to him cross-legged.
"Daddy! Daddy, come on!" Morgan whined again and started jumping in the bathtub, like the impatient little girl that she was.
The Quinjet is their spaceship, in my head it looks a bit like a mixture from the original Quinjet design (but way larger) and the Millennium Falcon.
“Are you deaf? I meant it exactly like I said it. I can’t ride. I’ve only ever used carriages in the city,” Tony told him a little exasperated.
Tony was suddenly wide awake. "Two weeks?! Isn't there any other city close by?" How was he supposed to survive two weeks? Two weeks of living with these strangers? Two weeks in close proximity to the alpha sheriff? Tony felt sick.
“Tony… Tony, you’re so beautiful like this,” he marveled. Steve’s fingers closed around Tony’s length, unable to resist the temptation of the red and swollen flesh any longer. It was right here in front of him, alluring and sexy and calling for him as it bobbed slightly with Tony’s movements. His eyes went wide when he watched as Tony's erection nearly vanished in his fist, only the tip peeking out and he experimentally rubbed the pad of his thumb over the slit. It was warm, wet and sticky, and he was sure he'd forever feel the texture of it in his palm.
And Tony willingly offering that to him made his heart skip a beat. Steve would have been happy if this ended with them jerking off together, but the prospect of entering Tony was almost too much for him to handle.
“I know, I know… This is going to haunt me forever,” Steve admitted and pecked Tony on the lips, happy to have his husband back after three long weeks, even if said husband made fun of him now. “You haven’t seen Dodger yet, though.”
Deadpool:(popping in again) They're not gonna kill Black Panther! That would be commercial suicide. Almost like doing a Deadpool video without actually having Deadpool in it.
"Why didn't you just reprogram the synapses to work collectively?" asked Shuri, which Vision agreed with.
Corvus Glaive suddenly arrived, knocking Wanda aside and grabbing Vision into the air. "Viz!" yelled Wanda, and Corvus flied away with Vision, slamming him against several walls. Meanwhile, Proxima engaged Wanda with her staff weapon and they, too, began to fight.
"Stop. Stop it." cried Gamora as she put her hands on Thanos's gauntlet, pulling it down. "I swear to you on my life. I never found the Soul Stone."
"Except for that I'm the captain." said Star-Lord, and he knew that Leyenar would say "you're right" if she was here.
"You know, Quill, you shouldn't talk that way to your captain, Quill." said Rocket. "Come on, Groot. Put that game down, you'll rot your brain."
All in all, everything worked as they had planned should the Avengers be involved in yet another international emergency. And yet, Tony often felt like he was in an old and clichéd western movie. The good guys were surrounded by bad guys, and the bad guys were in turn surrounded by angered Indians.
"Attachment to the material is detachment from the spiritual." said Wong, dressed in his traditional clothes.
She sighed, and said "I do hope there's no monster in your closet. And don't you dare bring Director Leyenar up again! She's a bitch and a banana."
"After the whole Accords situation, he and Scott struck a deal. It was too tough on their families, they're on house arrest." Nat revealed.
Bruce crawled out from under the branches, desperate and confused. "C'mon, Hulk. What are you doing to me?" He began slapping himself multiple times. "Come out! Come out! Come out!"
"Field trip to MoMA." Suddenly, Black Dwarf grabbed Peter and threw him away. "What is this guy's problem, Mr. Stark?" asked Peter.
Rhodey sounded a little bitter. "That's right. And I'm pretty sure I've paid for that." he said, glancing down at his leg bracers.
Just then, Tony is knocked down by Dwarf, who is about to deliver a decisive blow, but the alien's hammer is easily caught by Spider-Man. "Hey, man. What's up, Mr. Stark and Director Leyenar?" asked the boy.
a Spider-Man? Okay, look, Thanos has the biggest, most powerful army in the Four-Dimensional World. And he is not gonna stop until he...he gets...Vision's Stone." Bruce murmured.
"Little one, it's a simple calculus. This universe is finite, its resources finite. If life is left unchecked, life will cease to exist. It needs correction."
Thor squinted and noticed a dagger materialize in Loki's hand. Loki braced himself, thrust upward with lightning speed and attempted to stab Thanos, but got frozen in place by the Space Stone's power before the point could strike home. "Undying." You should choose your words more carefully." said Thanos. He twisted the dagger out of Loki's hand with his right hand, then took hold of Loki's neck with the gauntlet and lifted him to eye level. Loki struggled, kicking, as his throat is squeezed. He made eye contact with Thor before Thanos increased his force on Loki's neck. "You will...never be...a god." said Loki, just before Thanos could snap his neck, killing him.
"You told me that too." said Thanos as he sat on the steps to his throne. "Every day. For almost twenty years."
At Thanos's ship, the Mad Titan himself had Gamora captive. "I thought you might be hungry." he said as he gave her a cup of food.
T'Challa began snapping out orders. "Evacuate the city. Engage all defense procedures." He then pointed at Steve and said "And get this man a shield."
It wasn't exactly advanced mathematics. The UN wanted to control what they couldn't so far, and by now, they only waited for the right timing to make the Accords public.
Little did anybody know that everything will soon be put at great stake, and long-hidden secrets would soon be unfolded.
Captain America was at first a stage performer who raised enthusiasm for war bonds. He was then sent to the Italian front to raise the morale of the troops, but Rogers was meant for more than wooden guns and paper shields. On November 3rd 1943, he coordinated and lead a rescue mission to free over 300 Allied POW's from a German internment camp, among them his childhood best friend, James Barnes. His spectacular success lead to him being placed in charge of a group of special forces, the "Howling Commandos," which enjoyed some of the highest allied mission success raids. Rogers, called a tactical mastermind by his superiors, carried out over a hundred raids on German bases and outposts. His bravery, well-known among the men at the front, manifested itself when he boarded a German airplane headed for the continental USA. To save millions at home, he made the ultimate sacrifice and brought the plane down over the arctic ocean.
As their conversation finished, the bell rung. It declared only three contestants left. From these three, the High King would choose his Guardian. The Star Warrior and two older men stood before the Celestial Council. The Shining Lord nearly bounced in his seat. He simply had eyes for the companion of his own age. The Moon Prince could not disagree that it could be more beneficial if his guard was the same year, for it would allow the two to grow in solidarity much more. It would also be easier for the two to respect each other, for the Lord had a habit of turning his nose at those who thought themselves more educated and many men had a terrible idea that he was too young to know much.
Gamora looked up at Star-Lord in concern. He returned her look and grimaced a "don't worry about it" expression at her.
"But it was such a long way down and I just thought about you on the way...and I kinda stuck to the side of the ship. And this suit is ridiculously intuitive, by the way. So if anything, it's kinda your fault that I'm here." Peter confessed.
"You'll never get the chance again." Proxima retaliated. Proxima Midnight and Corvus Glaive departed as they are beamed up. The glaive is snatched from Cap's hand as well.
Voldemort:Yes. Here's to the one villain who's done absolutely nothing but is being treated as the scariest villain of all time!
"Yeah, we got one advantage. He's coming to us. We'll use it. All right, I have a plan. Or at least the beginnings of one. It's pretty simple. We draw him in, pin him down, get what we need. Definitely don't wanna dance with this guy. We just want the gauntlet." said Tony, causing Drax to yawn. "Are you
Okoye's kimoyo beads chimed out an alarm, she flicked one bead into her palm, where it projected the globe with a pulsing location marker. "Something's entered the atmosphere." she exclaimed.
"Eitri, this isn't about your hands. Every weapon you've ever designed... every ax, hammer, sword... it's all inside your head. Now I know it feels like all hope is lost. Trust me, I know. But together, you and I, we can kill Thanos." declared Thor.
He just didn't know how, not with Lagos still weighing heavily on everyone. And not when he knew in his heart that Steve would never agree to this. Their past conversations had made that very clear.
"Asgard is destroyed." said Thor, stopping Eitri mid-strike. "Eitri, the glove. What did you do?" the Thunder God asked.
Gamora looked at him, and her haughty smile turned into a panicked gasp as she realized what was coming. "No. This isn't love." she tried to protest.
Suddenly, Leyenar fell to the floor in a crumpled heap. Her friend and assistant, Carol Danvers, Captain Marvel, rushed over to help her.
" It's nano-tech. You like it? A little somet—" Before Tony could finish his sentence, Ebony Maw created a spike of earth that threw him far up, and attacked the rest of the team with uprooted trees and other debris. Wong summoned the Shield of the Seraphim.
"Yep. I'm picking that up, too. Let's put it down right here." Star-Lord replied. The four Guardians disembarked and sneaked into the Collector's collection room, which is in ruins. Thanos was threatening the Collector while the Guardians hid behind rubble.
The fact he'd also agreed to handle reconstruction duties for the government as well as paying for a major part of it had probably weighed heavily in the Avengers' favor.
Tony pointed at the approaching Dwarf. "That's the thing right there. Let's go." Bruce gave out a loud grunt, but failed to release the Hulk. Strange looked at the two of them unbelievingly. "Dude, you're embarrassing me in front of the wizards." said Tony.
The Celestials, magnificent beings of great power and knowledge , are the Givers & Directors Of Fate, the Children Of Destiny, and the Bringers Of Life. They are known across the galaxies for being meddlesome in the affairs of Midgard or, as the humans say, Earth. The humans of Earth may liken them to holy creatures, reminiscent of the Catholic God's angels, though that does not give an accurate representation of who the Celestials are.
" Thanos held up his hand to reveal the Infinity Gauntlet, which already hosted the violet Power Stone.
As he grew, Moon learned the ways of the diplomat and the warrior, finding strength and power in both the spoken word and the blade. But his true passion lay with the forge his father had given him. With his magic, arms bared and sweating under the heat, he formed each bright star and set them hanging like jewels in the multiverse. There was one other thing that the Moon Prince was more passionate about than the forge.
Meanwhile, Maw continued to torture Strange. "Painful, aren't they? They were originally designed for microsurgery. And any one of them..." Suddenly, he paused at a sudden thump behind him, and turned to see Iron Man, repulsors fully charged and ready to fire. "...Could end your friend's life in an instant." Maw finished.
Deadpool:You're gonna have a dead pool without the real Deadpool?! Don't you know how profitable I am?!
"If it's with the Collector, then it's not safe. Only an idiot would give that man a stone." Star-Lord insisted.
"You'll have the Kingsguard, and the Dora Milaje have been alerted." General Okoye told King T'Challa.
But that is the ending to a very long story. To understand, one must learn that the Celestials, though powerful, preferred peace and merrier joys than the shedding of blood in fruitless battles. Their people have a penchant for love. One must know that, as the Midgardians say, love is a most powerful, but a fickle thing. It is a story for a different time, for the story of my death and the Shining Lord's love collides so beautifully...
"The entire time I knew Thanos, he only ever had one goal:To bring balance to the Universe by wiping out half of all life. He used to kill people planet by planet, massacre by massacre..." said Gamora.
"I gotta tell you, he's not really my friend. Saving his life is more a professional courtesy." replied Tony.
"Yeah, not gonna happen," Clint just said, holding his daughter with one hand while he pointed at Steve. "Say 'Good night, Cap'."
Back on Earth, the Quinjet arrived at the Avengers Mansion while Rhodey dealt with the red tape in the holographic person of Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross. "Still no word from Vision?" asked Ross.
"Um. Okay, okay... uh..." said Peter as he and the Cloak popped back upright. "Okay. Did you ever see this really old movie, Aliens?"
The Apple Princess was despondent and cried and begged her father to let her be reunited with the Warrior once more, but he refused, knowing that he would receive the wrath of the Shining Lord by doing so. Meanwhile, the Star Warrior realized what a terrible mistake he had made, and he was once again reunited with his liege, the Shining Lord. He never dared to go across the Milky Way for the Apple Princess, for she deserved such punishment by falling in love with the Guardian of the High King.
Tony could see everything in shades of red behind his closed eyelids, but he refused to open his eyes.
Steve almost cut himself with the knife he was using to chop the onion. He thought a little before answering and decided to tell the truth.
"Why, thank you very much, Mr. Don't ever call me Mr. Stark again," Tony said, but he smiled back. It was an extremely domestic scene and, for any spectator who didn't know the context, they'd certainly never have imagined that it was a lawyer with the father of his client accused of murder, going to trial in the next few days. Or months. Who would know?
Tony watched from the top and realized that the soldier had turned his back on the hydra's left leg while talking to Peter.
, blessed be the French for that useful expression, when Steve pushed deep. All his life, Tony felt chained. Now, feeling Steve’s hands on him, all over his body, taking care of him, loving him,
Steve glanced at the chair in front of him, on Fury’s opposite end, where the table narrowed, and sighed.
Steve released his cock and he drew his fingers from inside Tony, who moaned in protest, but he stood up and leaned over Tony with one hand on either side of his head and Tony could see that Steve was holding something in one hand. He smiled.
Tony ran his fingers through his mouth, as if sealing them, and sat down in the only vacant place, facing Steve. Still avoiding the soldier's gaze, which Tony could feel burning on his skin, he took the tablet from the table and looked at Fury with a look of interest.
“All right, relax. No need to stress. Here,” he reached out and picked up a red, white and blue popsicle, the only reference to the holiday at the party, and handed it to Tony. “Take a popsicle and chill, okay?”
It was nice, comfortable, domestic, and it warmed Tony up in much more efficient ways than anything he had ever experienced. He couldn’t help thinking that he wanted to keep having it, having Steve waking up next to him, waking up next to Steve, every day. Tony just knew he needed it, needed to know that Steve would come home with him, that they’d both tell about their stressful days, that they’d help each other, that they’d ask for food, that they’d watch stupid comedies together, that they’d try to have sex on the couch , but they’d end up sleeping because the life of world’s saviors was not a wonder, but, when sex happened, wow, it’d be the best of all. Tony wanted that. Needed.
“Good idea,” Steve agreed from the front of Quinjet. “I'll try to talk to her before we even get to the Compound.”
His vision blurred and Tony blinked, trying to clear his focus and his hot, wet eyes. He was crying. The mere prospect of Steve out Tony’s life was so unbearable, that hurt too much. Tony instinctively raised his hand to wipe away the tears, but remembered at the last moment that he was inside the armor, that the effort was useless. He needed to get out of there. Give Steve the privacy he deserved. Tony turned and prepared to take off. And he almost tripped over himself when he heard it.
Steve reached Tony's thighs and stroked them on the outside first, until he reached his calves and then went back up, but this time, from the inside, taking advantage of the position of his hands to spread Tony's legs, making room for Steve to settle there in the middle of them.
“It's great. Now use these muscles and knead the dough with your hands until it forms a ball. When this happens, throw some flour on the counter and put the dough on the counter, without stopping kneading.”
“But I was just kidding myself. I should’ve realized that everything was going downhill when every time we tried to talk it all went wrong, either it was never the right time, or it was just a mixture of those two factors.”
Strange closed his eyes and took a deep breath once before looking back at Tony and Steve. “You opened the box.” His voice was ominously calm. The hairs on the back of Tony's neck stood on end. One thing was villains making threats. They were usually empty or simple to get around. The problem was when powerful friends and allies lowered their voices in situations where screams and curses were expected. Exactly like now.
Steve bent over to kiss Tony with sweetness and passion and for a moment, there was no incursion, no fire, and no destruction. There were only the two of them under a dome of love and the certainty that their daughter was safe.
"By the power invested in me by the state of New York, I now pronounce you married. Congratulations," announced the officiant.
Tony blinked twice then smirked. “Why, why, Captain. Weren't you just saying how I should've followed Strange's instructions?” He went back to the humming.
“Come here.” Steve pulled Tony into a hug. “I help you with what you need, my love. I love you, remember?”
, Steve to take care of him, to cherish him and, more than that, to give Tony the best sex ever before he exploded.
Steve laughed. “We have a chance to start over, Tony. I can leave the past behind, where it really belongs. And you can start over, even with your second-hand memories. Learn from experience. It’s not just because you have lost the original memories that you can’t learn from what happened, that you can’t feel anything about it. But allow yourself to move on,” Steve smiled.
Ignoring Fury's talk about A.I.M., Tony opened the secret communication channel and found a message:
I kept fighting because that was what I still had. Without you, without your smile, without your energy, without your constant presence, even if far away, I just needed to wait until I died too. I could wait. I deserved that torture. If I was there with you, maybe I could have stopped you from getting on that ship, or I could have gone with you.
Steve took a deep breath. Captain's stance. He could do that. It was one of the few things he had never forgotten how to do. It was like riding a bicycle.
Tony really wanted to be able to know if he was still welcome to get Steve’s real smiles out, but his heart sank when he thought about everything they had not so long ago, everything they said Tony said to Steve and everything Steve said to Tony. It wasn’t pretty. They didn’t end it as friends. Not even as colleagues. They ended that War as enemies who hated each other, who managed to get the worst out of each other.
“What?” Fury was offended. “Of course not, for God's sake. What do you think I am? Some homophobic asshole?”
"Almost eight o'clock on the fourth of July. And as far as I know, you're invited to a very important party today.”
Everyone around the table nodded, including Sam, who was watching perched on the couch behind Natasha.
that girl, because that's what that would be: they would adopt from themselves, as strange as it may seem. But he couldn’t force Liz to accept them. Moreover, both he and Tony had to deal with it.
"We're gonna order some pizzas," Steve said with a smirk as he saw Tony's expression wither. "And play some poker." He touched Tony's arm and squeezed lightly, sending messages not at all appropriate for that time of the day through Tony's body. “You are invited.”
Tony’s entire body lit up, reacting to the vision, and he felt a smile spread across his face and found himself watching the gleam in his eyes on the armor’s hub. His body moved, coming out from behind the chimney and taking a step, instinctively. But, then, Tony stopped. As if someone was holding him by the collar, he was unable to move. He was so close, why couldn’t he take that leap and reveal himself to Steve? Why couldn’t he show his face and his smile of extreme happiness to see his best friend alive again?
Strange frowned and looked at Tony suspiciously. “First, that person would have to have inhaled an enormous amount of pollen, an amount that I can't even imagine within a human's system.”
“Could you run the tests you probably ran on Tony before to find out if the pollen has already left him?”
"You should stop worrying so much, darling," Tony laughed. "He better listen to our mouths than the mouths of strangers, is not that what they say?"
“It was my idea, yes. I-I thought about what you would’ve preferred.” Tony Stark, stuttering, ladies and gentlemen. Enjoy the moment, it doesn’t happen often. Only Steve Rogers has that power.
And fate had been very generous to them, bringing them a beautiful boy, whose parents had died in a tragic accident. Initially, the boy had been placed in the custody of a couple of uncles. Unfortunately, the same luck that smiled for Steve and Peggy wasn't so friendly with the boy's family, since the uncle died in a robbery and his aunt, already old, shortly afterwards, of natural causes, leaving the boy alone.
The last community card was opened by Natasha, a beautiful three of clubs and Tony couldn’t be more pleased. With the new card, he now had a four of a kind, joining his original three diamonds plus the other three threes that were opened at the table. Chances were extremely favorable, which made him open the betting round by betting high, placing eight chips in the center of the table.
"We have a ship, apparently of non-terrestrial origin, with some damage, but with the structure still stable and” Vision went a few feet to the right, being exactly by the side of the ship, facing the place where Natasha was “yes, there is a person here. A young woman.”
When I left you alone in that bunker, I left you there thinking that I had never felt anything real for you, that everything we lived and shared had been a convincing and convenient lie. Never was. It was always so much more. It was always real.
“We have reports of Doombots attacking in Queens, near Queens College,” Captain continued. “We have many schools in the area and many civilians on the way. Me, Tony, Wanda and Bruce are going there.”
Taking a deep breath and letting the freezing air of that night enter his lungs, Tony turned the door handle that gave access to the apartment and entered, feeling the breath of hot air, bringing in the smell of coffee, clean clothes and the soap that Steve used. Tony let himself smell those scents for a second or two before entering the apartment completely and closing the door behind him.
Rhodes smiled. "It's only a couple of blocks, Tony. Your legs aren't gonna fall off and leave you behind."
They all got up and started to get off the plane toward the Tower, all exhausted and unworried to talk. Tony took Steve's arm.
“Thor!” Ares's voice echoed down 44th Street, which, thanks to all that was sacred, was empty. People were smarter after Thanos. “I was really waiting for you.”
Tony didn’t understand. Then he dropped his hands to his sides and faced Steve. Looking at him was like being punched in the stomach and wanting to repeat the experience. It was beautiful and suffocating. Perfect enough to hurt.
“Eighteen.” Her voice was strong, but also with a very characteristic softness and Tony found himself thinking he could listen to that girl talk for hours.
after the way we said goodbye. Cool things out a bit and focus on what I needed to do there or else I wouldn’t even have been able to stay in Dubai, Nat.”
Steve looked at Tony again and his look was pained. “Thor had to run to resolve matters for Asgard, that was going through its own problems. When I saw that you weren’t waking up, I went to Strange to ask for help. I stayed long enough to help him prepare the ritual that would bring you back.”
"Don’t worry," Tony dismissed him with a nod. "We don’t plan on talking much. It was a very tiring morning, so we’re gonna sleep back here.”
Tony was taken aback, not knowing what to say or think. But his body was more lucid, so his legs followed Steve down a short corridor, just to Tony's left, and stopped by a door on the right. Steve opened it and showed the room: a double bed right in the middle of the room, with clean, soft sheets and fluffy pillows, a small wardrobe against the opposite wall, a nightstand beside the bed, a door leading to a bathroom stocked with towels and soap, a large window overlooking the city, and below it a desk with a chair.
“No. He only had time to schedule the ship to leave the planet. Where she would fall would be another matter.”
“Remember when you called me an old man?” Steve asked and Tony nodded slowly, still not understanding. “We were always like this, I was the old man, stuck in the past, and you were always the futurist, thinking about how to make everyone’s life easier for when tomorrow comes.”
They both laughed and it was good. The sound of the two laughs mixed and Tony was transported to lighter and happier times, when the Avengers shared the Mansion that Tony had donated to the team to serve as their HQ. Those were times that seemed so far away now. So unattainable. So unreal. Tony was afraid that sometimes he was just imagining all those memories, that he had much more than just a part of his memory erased. What if he was imagining those happy times? No. He could never just imagine the laughter and game nights at the Mansion with Steve and the others. That was too precious.
And what a wonderful taste Steve had. A shiver ran through Tony's body when the two tongues met, dancing together, seeking dominance, until Tony gave up, because he couldn't take control anymore. He wanted,
“I remember everything,” Tony watched Steve’s face carefully, not to lose any reaction. Steve looked relieved. Then Tony released the grenade pin. “Up to a week
Steve cleared his throat, suddenly uncomfortable. Tony saw that he was red and felt his heart heat up. So, he still had the power to make Steve Rogers blush. Well, that was certainly a victory. “You said Osborn had other intentions ...” Steve said, drinking his own coffee.
The dog was huge, at least sixteen feet high, and he was furious. But it was difficult to know exactly why. The left head seemed furious because Steve had hit the shield on it while the right head was furious because it had been prevented from continuing to attack Wanda, and the middle head was furious because it couldn’t participate entirely in any attack.
“Is everything all right, Tony?” Steve asked, still in a cheerful tone, handing one of the mugs to the engineer.
Tony set his coffee mug on the counter and, with an impulse, sat on it with his legs folded one over the other.
“Could you say that again, a little louder this time? I forgot to ask Jarvis to record it for me to use it as the ringtone on my Starkphone.”
"Nothing." Steve swallowed. "I'm just wondering when you're going there." He nodded at the karaoke stage, where Nat and Bruce were singing Mamma Mia.
Steve could never know what was happening, that it ever happened. Tony could already imagine the expression of disgust and pity on the soldier's face. Having your greatest passions exacerbated by a flower and being unable to control yourself? No, Tony could be stronger than the flower.
Steve started by betting four chips. Natasha kept the bet on four chips, Clint only put two more and Tony didn’t bet anything, perks of big blind.
Tony leaned over, opened one of the drawers, and took the remote control of the air conditioning. Immediately the windows closed automatically, sealing the house in a pleasantly cool setting at sixty-eight degrees. He pushed his sneakers out of his feet and smiled.
I hope you're able to calmly breathe until there (because from here the anxiety is very difficult to handle!)
Tony tried again to step out of the shadows and say something, anything, make any sound so that Steve knew he was there, but he couldn’t.
Steve thought. "Art. I draw. I paint some pictures sometimes, but most of the time I draw. And then I sell them," he looked at the man in front of him, who was looking back at him with a strange expression of recognition.
With those words, Tony gently slid his cock in Steve and they both groaned loudly when Tony was fully inside Steve.
“You say you’re not worthy, that you don’t deserve it. You stay there, focusing on your flaws, but you want to know something?” Steve asked. Tony nodded in agreement. “To me, you are perfect.”
“Captain Rogers left your dinner outside the lab and said, and I quote, 'Let me know if you need me. Together, remember?' And then he returned to his quarters.”
“It couldn’t be different with the family I have.” She stopped and her smile died. “With the family I
Steve thought for a while, biting his lower lip and making Tony think a little more than he should have, going in ways not recommended for PG-13. No. Definitely, after seeing Steve bite his lip, Tony went on an exclusive route rated R, with huge NSFW signs.
Tony laughed out loud. "Pepper and me married? Never! She's my associate. And my secretary. And my best friend. And the closest to a family I have. But, no. Not my wife. By the way," Tony paused dramatically and looked at Steve sideways. "I'm not even married."
"No, Hulk and I are fine." Bruce waved his hand, dismissing Thor's concern. "What has been stressing me out are Bucky and Sam, who have now met Peter." Bruce sighed. "As if Wanda and Vision weren't enough."
“Die faster, stupid monster!” Hulk screamed and punched one of the heads, making the hydra unbalanced.
“So that's how you managed to get through all of my radars.” Tony said, more astonished than outraged.
“That day, in court,” Steve began, leaning over the marble island and leaning on his arms. “I was shot -”
Steve smiled kindly and wiped an insolent tear that was streaming down Tony’s face, and that corroded Tony inside. “It’s already gone. It’s over.” Steve squeezed Tony’s arms lightly, reaffirming that everything was fine. “I died and came back. You have lost part of your memory, the most painful, according to yourself. It seems obvious what we have to do here.”
He straddled Steve, kissed him, and looked him in the eye. “Are we going to need a condom, soldier? Or can we go bareback?”
"I know that his head, that his life, turned inside out in less time than anyone would consider possible," Steve said placing a cutting board on the island and placing an eggplant there to slice it. "But I wish there was a way to reach him right now, you know? I wish there was a way to show him that he’s not alone and that this isn’t just lip service."
Vision did not respond immediately and this turned on a warning light on Natasha's head. It was not usual the android to hesitate, much less look from side to side, clearly unsure of what response to give.
“How can you be so kind to me?” Tony practically shouted. “You just heard me say that I took advantage of the Civil War, that I lied to you, to our friends, to the press, that I let them think you were the villain. Damn it, I let them kill you!” Tony felt like a scratched vinyl, repeating the same thing over and over, trying to get Steve to come to his senses, that he finally understood the seriousness of Tony’s words, that he finally kicked Tony out of that apartment, damn it, that he finally expelled Tony from his whole life, but no matter how many times Tony repeated it, Steve continued to ignore him, and worse: he kept bringing him closer, preventing him from leaving, from being guilty.
“What time is it?” Tony rubbed his eyes and looked out the window. The lights of New York already contrasted with the dark sky.
feel, I need to remember to know why I’m ashamed, why I’m feeling guilty, why I’m afraid to be here.”
"What's the matter with you kids? You've never seen a spaceship before?" said the driver. Peter jumped out the window, clinging to the side of the bus and pulling on his mask before leaping over the side of the bridge, shooting a web-line and swinging free. He made his way hastily towards the ship.
It had been two days ago, when Tony had—not so legally—gotten notice of the document. Ever since, he had researched every law paragraph, every draft, every e-mail he could locate in an effort to understand what was going to happen.
