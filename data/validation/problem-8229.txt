“Language” now Tony snickered but allowed himself to be dragged around.
“ stop laughing. It’s not even funny. What if I don’t want to go?” he said lifting his chin up just slightly challenging.
”don’t say that, that’s not what’s happening” Steve didn’t like this , he didn’t like the way tony was still denying it. What had they done to him?
“What’s there to talk about?”
And when Steve reached out to takes Tony’s hand, he shrugged them off “I am sorry okay? And I didn’t ask Steve to get in the water with me. He doesn’t tell me things either, if he had told me then I wouldn’t have let him do it.” He forced out angrily still unable to look at any of them.
Tony was shaking his head to something Clint was saying and the carton of food beside him on the table stayed untouched and cold.
Steve’s voice trailed off in a whisper as he wondered just how much Tony should hate him. Is that tony kept the information about the palladium poisoning from him? Because he was afraid Steve would force his decision on him on this as well?
“He dropped my yogurt" he said his lips quivering
Steve hadn’t actually expected Tony to be this wiped out considering the teenage refractory period . But of what tony said was true hand has had no release of any kind in the past two years then maybe it was okay .
“There is a Tony stark in medical and is refusing treatment. He says he needs to make sure you are okay sir. He seems terrified and hysterical.”
“Woahhh" he said drawing out the word and leaned forward as if to touch but he pulled his hand back to himself unsure and Steve was actually very glad for that. He did not want to be reacting inappropriately to Tony’s touch at the moment.
“It’s not broken” he said and Steve’s eyes snapped up to meet his , had tony gone to a doctor after all?
"I am hungry though, I didn't eat my lunch cause pep needed help with her math homework" tony was chewing on his lip looking at Steve through fluttering lashes.
"sounds good" he shrugged as he walked toward the couch waving at bruce and nat.
tony was sitting cross legged on the bed, he looked pale and ashy. But the latter was because he still had considerable amount of ash and soot covering his skin. He had his chin resting on his palms, staring at the bland painting on the wall. His eyelids dropped every few seconds and Steve wanted to leave him be and let him get some sleep.
Tony’s legs came around Steve’s waist and he clung to Steve desperately, breathing hitching as tears fell from his eyes.
“Tony, honey?” Steve asked slowing his moments as he felt Tony go lax and the tears continued to flow down his cheeks .
A plate of hot food was placed in front of him as he sat himself down at the small makeshift conference table they had made on the jet facing the big screen. He gratefully smiled as he settled in for what he knew was a very long lecture from fury about getting Tony involved.
“ yeah, impressed by how Clint shot the man” he said and sighed his tense shoulders relaxing.
“Are you feeling alright?” concern was taking over now and natasha muttered something about a sedative .
“He put this thing in there……so I couldn’t come. It hurt. A lot.”
Five minutes into the silence of his class while he spoke about the French revolution Tony’s head dropped onto rhodey's shoulder, his eyes shut. Steve almost took a tentative step towards him but aborted at The last moment and tried to finish the class as best as he could.
“Pepper is a nice girl, she is good for you” he said giving him the warmest smile he could muster.
“water?” steve asked holding the cup up in front of tony and he took it with shaky hands , steve allowing him to take his time as he carefully removed the straw and drank straight from the cup most of the water dribbling down his chest.
“Sure"
“you want me to leave?” He asked as he carefully eased his hands away as if to get up but before Steve could move tony had placed both his hands on his chest, fingers trying to desperately grasp at the material of his uniform to keep him from moving.
The doctor had already confirmed to Steve that there was something there , but Steve was still nervous as the image loaded on the screen and Tony glared daggers at him from the other side of the glass wall.
"Tony, hey you have to tell us what you took buddy. Come on, we just want to help" clint said and Tony looked up at Steve and then Clint, quickly looking away again. He was clearly contemplating something
“I am going assume it has something to do with Tony. Speaking of Tony, how is he doing?” ofcourse bruce had caught on, bruce was one of the smartest people he knew.
“No please”
“Steve someone needs to teach your palate a lesson" steve raised an eyebrow turning towards the teen , he kept his face perfectly calm as he leaned down close to him and whispered
Steve smiled and left the room , making a quick detour towards Clint and natasha. He found them sitting at a table in a conference room. Natasha looked like she wanted to murder someone and her expression softened as she spotted Steve
"so what's for lunch? I am craving bacon!" I exclaimed as the elevator moved up.
“One of the boys may or may not have landed on top of me” Steve cringed internally at the thought of someone falling on the already small framed brunette. Tony was small for his age, his cheeks still had that roundness to them but Steve found it adorable none the same.
“you have to understand-“
"thor we need to get him back to the tower, can you carry him to the jet?"
“I think we need to talk to him again, see if he remembers anything that might help us" because it cannot be a co incidence and Steve was willing to bet that stane had something to do with Bucky or rather , the winter soldier.
“you ready to go?” steve asked as he stepped in to find Tony pulling on a fresh shirt over his head.
“Uhm I don’t think obie will appreciate that. I’ll take a cab" he had a point, and if tony was insisting then Steve wasn’t going to push.
“I love you too" he said running his palm over the bulk of bandages on his back. Steve gently pulled him away only to readjust his grip so Tony wouldn’t be hurting himself. They stayed that way for a while until bruce came in carrying two syringes in his hands.
Tony for his part shook his head and Steve moved to put him down on the bed but Tony refused to let go.
“you people are crazy.”
“if you wanted the money Steve you could have just asked me,there was no need to kidnap a billionaire from school” she said taking a water bottle out of the fridge while Tony fake gasped rubbing the sleep out of his eyes
"Are you both alright?" He asked feeling calmer now that he had eyes on them.
He sat on the edge of the bed just looking around waiting for Tony to get back when he spotted something,  a picture frame of a much younger Tony, couldn’t have been older than ten but Steve would recognize those eyes anywhere. But that is not what caught Steve’s attention,  it was the person next to him. A brunette , with red lipstick hugging him from behind. Peggy was Steve’s first love , and Steve had to wonder what happened, if she got married or if she was still…
"I am fine, just peachy. This party is a bummer. Who planned it anyway? I should fire him."
“It will be safer for you” Steve said
“No, take off your shirt too ,why do I have to be naked and you don’t” steve sighed as Tony tried to get his buttons open.
“It’s okay , we are not going to do anything you don’t want to.” Steve cut him off and Tony swallowed loudly “ it feels weird to just talk about it” he whined a little as he said it and Steve smiled at him
It took another thirty minutes for them to catch Steve up on everything and round the meeting off. Most of Steve's attention still on Tony. He was given even orders by fury to lead this mission. It would take about five days if everything went to plan. And all Steve could think about is what more trouble tomy can get into in those five days .
So it amused him when Steve found said genius sitting outside the gym on a bench with none of his friends with whom he was always in non stop chatter with. As he walked closer Steve noticed the slight hunch in his posture and his left arm loosely wrapped around his abdomen .
All the guilt , worry and anger was gone the moment he saw Tony,  surrounded by Bruce and natasha .
Steve turned again to look at him and smiled to himself as he saw Tony nibbling on the spoon in his hand ,which held no food. He looked tired and exhausted and looked worse than Steve felt.
“Okay, tony?” natasha asked and everyone turned to him to see what he had to say.
“I did”
“The team?” he asked his eyebrows scrunching up the way they did in class when Tony was trying to process information, it was cute.
Steve sighed, this was going to be a long recovery. His mind although ,had reached a level of calm he didn’t expect as soon as he had wrapped his arms around tony. A very conscious Tony.
“It's fine , you are tired” steve cut him off mid sentence and Tony looked terrified for a second before he composed his face into something more normal.
"only if you can catch me!" sticking his tongue out at me.
“Shit I am sorry" he said biting his finger as the red creeped up his skin along his neck and cheeks
Steve rolled his but agreed anyway. “okay, but we are having this conversation one way or another today. Even if that means I have to give you detention to hold you back a couple of hours.”
“Damn straight! I was right and that’s why he is going back to boarding school away from you” Steve was having a little trouble breathing himself, as he watched stane stomp out to take tony away from him.
“Kitchen, steve let go" he said tugging on Steve’s hold.
“I am not sure" he said turning to bruce who nodded “okay, I will be there” he said definitely.
But I actually felt more awake and alert after drinking the water. I zoned out again for a second and hands unbuttoning my suit bought me back to reality.
“You and Bucky, was there something?”
He gave her quick once over nothing the pallor and pinched her skin on the back of her palm finding that she was indeed just dehydrated.
“right so details, tony I have already spoken to your surgeon. He says you need to be admitted tonight, they need to do some tests before they can go ahead. I know it’s scary buddy but I will be in the OR with you the whole time.” He said and Tony briefly nodded and looked towards Steve “can you also be there?” he asked
“Green?” he asked
“As a teacher I am obligated to report any incidents involving students to their guardian” he said watching for any signs that’s tony was throwing up his walls again but tony only sighed again, twirling the note in his fingers.
How had no one been paying any attention to how sick he actually was? Or was this the effect of him learning that Steve was dead and the stress of being told otherwise had gotten to him?
“That’s the point. It will help, I promise. I’ll go bring you some change of clothes, I’ll be right outside ,just call for me if you need me.” He said  turning towards the door
The bell rang a few moments later and Steve watched as Tony and his friends clambered to get their books and bags and make their way out of the cafeteria. Now that steve was noticing, he looked younger than most people. Even if by only a year, Tony’s physique and build made him look like rhodeys younger brother who was always around him to protect him. Steve appreciated his friends a lot and didn’t think he could have maintained this distance if not for the knowledge that the two of them were there watching over him.
“Honey, it’s okay” he said as he ran his up and down Tony’s chest and Tony whimpered as Steve pulled his knees apart and ran his palm over the wet material.
“Okay sweetheart, we are going to do this together”
“These are my friends, Clint and Natasha . They are here to make sure you guys don’t get into trouble” there was a round of groans that went around and clint stepped up “we are actually here, to make sure this guy doesn’t kill your fun” the cheers that went around made Steve roll eyes as they all made their way into the museum.
“One, you let me call your guardian” Tony’s eyes went wide and before he could shake his head Steve continued “two, I can have the school counsellor talk to you about what is going on” he held up his finger when tony opened his mouth to argue “or three, you let me asses this injury of yours, and then we can talk about what is going to happen next”
“Uhm….just don’t be mad okay?” he told natasha and she was still frowning at him and she shot Steve a quick look before Steve eased the blanket off Tony’s back and as Steve had predicted, natasha took it very well.
"you would tell me if something was wrong won't you?"
Steve sat down at one of the seats at front of the bus, once all the kids had boarded and he was startled out of his thoughts five minutes later when someone sat next to him.
“You should teach spiritual meditation or something instead of history" he said smiling his voice thick and rough from sleep
“Look at me sweetheart, please" the tears fell as he lifted his head but neither did anything about it.
Steve held him down giving him a quick kiss on the cheek
Halfway through his lecture, Steve noticed Tony looking unimpressed and tried to make his voice more upbeat because he knew history was not the best subject but he intended to make it as fun as possible , especially to the new one’s so they can develop interest faster.
"Bruce, you are always getting me in trouble" I mumbled
He wasn’t sure if Tony was aware but he was fully naked under the thin sheets they had put over him. He had no idea how he would feel about that if he later found out that not only had the entire team seen him bare but his friends too.
“I don’t want you to” he said staring intently at the piece of paper in his hand.
“Tony sweetheart you are going to be fine , I promise. You are okay" he continued as he reached down pulling Tony’s throbbing erection away to look at the bruises.
Sorry I am not being consistent in updating!!
“I know you are scared , but we will take it very slow. Anytime you want to stop and we will.” He nodded again “which brings me to my next point, safe word. I need one okay? You can pick whatever you want” tony looked at him confused and Steve continued “pick one word, you say the word and we stop. No matter what, you have my promise okay?” tony nodded again but didn’t say anything as Steve waited
But what he really did not see coming was as Clint and natasha came back carrying hands full of food ,fresh and hot , for her to lean down and drop a kiss to Tony’s forehead.
“I have palladium poisoning”
“that was a really bad hit mr Rogers" that other boy warned before they left even though rhodey looked very reluctant to leave.
“He’s okay, you can trust me. Tony do you want to go back to class while I talk to them?”
“Do need anything else?” he asked
Steve groaned at that “he’s not a child.” He said mildly irritated.
Worried was only an emotion Steve could begin to describe as he watched Tony’s discomfort.
“That’s gonna be a fun conversation” Clint snickered
“He won’t take it well, he’s already sick. He’s only sixteen, I can’t do that to him" he was also Steve’s precious lover , someone steve had connected with like never before and this one piece of information would destroy everything.
Because, it's been an absolute mess! I myself had no clue where It was going. But i have thought it over and would like to give it another go!
“ugh adult conversations are so boring, tony come on one more round" he said and Steve silently thanked him even though he knew Clint was very aware of their conversation. Tony groaned throwing the gun onto the table,
Tony’s trembling didn’t stop even after a few moments and Steve gravely wondered if he had made a terrible mistake. Tony had asked if they could do something more intimate just two days back and Steve did know he was still far too young. But seeing Tony dressed in uniform had taken him by surprise and Steve had been holding back for so long now.
Steve was still speechless worried for the boys health.
“what situation?” Rhodey asked now concerned and fitting the pieces together ,he stared between Steve and Tony demanding an answer.
“tony?” he felt desperate now, needing to see those brown eyes and Steve pulled back a little and the hair at the back of his neck prickled forming goosebumps when Tony’s head just lolled forward.
This time around Steve didn’t hesitate to tell him about tony. Bucky listened painfully quiet about everything that Steve had to say  and he never gave away even a small emotion and Steve worried that maybe he was making a mistake.
“Do you want to go spar? Break some of that tension , it will be good for you” clint asked as he cleaned up and Steve nodded “I do, but I don’t want him to wake up alone” he said pointing to Tony
“Steve! Wake up please . Please be okay"
“Uhm, I hope this will do I couldn’t find anything else in your size” Tony said walking in. He had already changed his hair still wet and hanging limp across his forehead. He dropped a pair of sweatpants and a matching shirt which was brand new and as Steve opened the packaging he saw the bright logo of SI.
“no please just a while longer . I promise nothing happened ,I just like this” he admitted and Steve gave him an unimpressed look ready to argue that something must have happened but Tony smirked at him and added “A lot"  Steve’s racing heart took a minute to calm down
“Okay, yeah let’s do that" he said smiling at him and Tony beamed back
Steve was just glad he was wearing clothes.
“Bruce! Nice to see you , how was your summer?” Bruce, smiled at him genuine and happy as he extended a hand for Steve to shake. Steve loved Bruce,the man was quiet and often kept to himself but what Steve liked the most about him was that he had a genius mind but that didn’t keep him from staying humble always. Bruce was the school’s favourite physics teacher and he even occasionally taught biology because he had had experience in the medical field before he started teaching.
“No, you don’t get to talk to Bruce about it. Want to know why?” he asked or rather shouted and Tony looked at him eyes questioning “because whatever you say tony , it was still my fault. You were not a day over seventeen,tony you were ,no you are still a minor. And I am the asshole who thought it would make things right if I gave you what you wanted even though I knew you had no idea what you were asking for. And after you asked for stane I felt like it was me who was the actual monster not stane. Me tony , bruce was right. So no, you don’t get to defend me about it"
“That’s an emergency,  I need to get that" he said tapping on his ear to indicate the noise and Tony let go and Steve jogged over the living room for his phone.
“you said something else before, can I ask you about it?” tony nodded sluggishly like he didn’t care anymore
“Okay?” he asked trying to point to himself , he was not able to fully focus on what he was saying and Steve knew he was falling asleep again
“That was so cool!” he said and looked up Steve “did you see that?!”
“no matter what you think, you still look just as beautiful to me with the reactor as how you did before.”  And with  that said Steve didn’t bother holding back as he kissed tony fiercely.
“Yesss! You are the best!”
“how sick is he now? Is that why you asked him if he needed a hospital?” Bruce nodded and Tony tugged on his freed hand.
“No tony, go to the nurse, you are a big boy. You can handle it” he said and tony frowned at him shaking his head. Steve groaned internally before relenting and Tony’s face lit up.
“I…don’t ..”
“We will watch a short movie” Steve said instead walking with his bundle towards the bedroom.
“What?” he asked confused and Tony pointed to the chocolate in his hand and Steve smiled at him before handing it over
“Do you think it will work on him?” he asked
Steve’s side indicating that he should put his legs up. Tony very reluctantly did so and it was painful to watch him ho through this and not being able to fo much.
“Think he had a nightmare" steve told them and natasha moved onto Tony’s right reaching out to touch him.
“hey,” he said suddenly remembering something and Tony looked up at him expectantly
“I am sorry tony you really do need that" tony scowled at him and Steve shrugged
“What is it?” He asked flipping it back and forth and Steve wiped the drop of water that dripped from his hair and was trailing down his temple.
He turned towards me giving me an appraisal before saying "Are you okay tony? Something wrong? I have never seen you this anti-social ever before"
“Tony? Answer me honey” he asked again and when he didn’t hear anything natasha quickly strode over trying the knob but the door was locked from the inside.
"Jarvis briefed us on the battle, is everyone okay?any one of you hurt? "I asked as I rearranged myself to accommodate Tony into my hold.
Tony all but shouted and grabbed Steve’s hands tightly and Steve sighed turning his wrists around and captured Tony’s hands instead.
“What intel?” he asked eyes zeroing in on steve and he sighed as he motioned with his hands towards his still pasta clad hair
Bruce had woken him up a few hours into his fatigued sleep , and he raised him head up careful not to jostle any of the things attached to Tony.
“I am okay Tony, I promise everything is okay” He said and Tony pushed away the food from near him to create space and moved closer to Steve allowing Steve to wrap an arm around his waist.
“I am not sure, there was a kid sixteen at most that knocked on the door.” Steve winced as Bucky nailed the age spot on. I don’t know what happened, one minute I just wanted to open the door and next I was strangling the kid. I just… he…I..am sorry.” He struggled to finish by this point clints eyes were wide looking angry but natasha kept her cool.
“oh sweetheart. I wanted you to go with stane because I thought it was safer for you not because I didn’t want you. And trust me when I say this , you are not going anywhere okay, I am not going to let that happen now.” Tony’s eyes lit up as he turned to look at him
“ I know the serum enhance your healing capabilities,  but do you still feel the same amount of pain as others?” he asked fingers tracing the bruise again with a feather light touch and Steve shivered as his fingers ghosted over his skin.
“cap, how is he?” Clint asked as Steve made a quick stop at the interrogation room where they had the guy. Natasha and Clint were going over some files as Clint chewed on a sandwich noisily.
"He started it" I muttered before turning to the plate that appeared in front of didn't look that bad honestly. Looked like a wheat bread sandwich with green stuff inside it. But hey,on the bright side, look chips! I reached out to grab a handful from the open packet,only to have my hand swatted away by Steve with a "Eat your sandwich first".
“what the hell was that for? ”tony rasped  “for being the stubborn idiot that you are” she said handing out cartons of food to everyone as everyone chuckled while tony pouted .
A perfectly circular opacity in the center of his chest.
“Don’t want to change?” Steve asked as Tony all but tucked himself under the comforter before Steve had even pulled out a change of clothes from his closet.
“you were tired, I thought you could use the sleep" he said walking him towards their room.
Tony rolled his eyes and walked back to Steve tugging on his wrist to pull him along and Steve followed him this time. The stark mansion was actually quiet huge, Steve was stunned that he did even remember layout of the house. It had been more than twelve years since he and Howard sat in the study discussing designs for his shield.
"okay ,take it easy please?" Steve said as he let me go. "yes,daddy!" I quipped as I walked out,imagining the blush creeping up Steve's face.
“so you are completely healed now? Nothing is even bleeding anymore?” Tony said as he practically bounced on the bed from excitement his exhaustion momentarily forgotten.
“Not so much in words, but I know him well enough" she said flashing a grin at him
“It will happen Tony, be patient” he said and Tony sighed but Steve didn’t miss the way his shoulders relaxed.
“is she hurt?”
Right, don’t get mad.
Just as Bruce was listening to his, his face sporting a concerned frown  natasha and clint came in carrying the needful. Natasha quickly got to work checking his temp and cursed in Russian “ how bad is it?” steve whispered his hand running through Tony’s hair again, afraid he would wake up and panic.
“Avoiding gym class, Mr. Stark?” Steve asked as he approached the boy
“Tony, hey it’s me buddy, I am okay” he said and tony froze as his eyes landed on Steve’s form. It would have been comical if not for the situation, just as Steve reached out to put a hand on his shoulder, tony seemed to snap out of his trance , flinging himself at Steve, trembling arms hugging him as tightly as posssible.
“Green" he said breathily after a moment and Steve took a deep breath before pushing in, he was trying to be as gentle as possible but he was very aware of just how big he was and Tony wailed as he was stretched wider ,hands grasping at nothing and Steve bent down over him so tony could put his arms around him. His fingers dug into Steve's skin drawing blood as he whimpered and cried out , but Steve couldn’t move fast or he could hurt him terribly.
He released his hold on Tony’s hand and wrapped an arm around his midsection to pull him upright so he could complete lean against the wall but Tony gasped as Steve’s hand made contact with his midsection his hands trying to push him away but Steve quickly maneuvered him into a sitting position before letting go.
“yeah, he told me" Steve said crossing his arms and leaning against the lockers.
Steve's anger with shield was only increasing with every minute he had to still sit in school until the bell rang signifying it was time to leave. So by the time he reached shield, it was safe to say he was fuming.
“It’s me” Natasha confirmed, her hand never leaving his cheek the touch kept him grounded as he blinked a couple of times trying to clear his vision.
“Look at me tony,” tony turned , lips pursed “this infatuation you have with me is just a phase, you are very young. You deserve better , a lot better than this” he said waving at his battered body.
“I am going to need a reference here" steve asked looking at him cautiously running his hands along Tony’s back.
He was dialing before he even realized it. It rang endlessly. He bypassed voicemail (thank you, Pepper, you’re a genius) and let it ring, nerves beginning to eat at him.  There was no reason to think anything was amiss, but Tony always picked up the phone when he called.  Always.  He’d never even had to use the voicemail trick before.  Even when he was in that meeting with Legal, when Steve knew he wouldn’t use Jarvis.  He didn’t talk to Jarvis when other people were around. Fuck, Tony, pick up the phone!
A curly haired boy looked up, startled.  “Me?”
Tony took a step back, rightfully alarmed.
He went to SHIELD.  He read through the carefully curated list of Wikipedia pages, History.com websites. Coulson would send him a list, and he’d read through it in his room, closeted away from the world. In his office, he could see daylight through a small window.  Other offices opened, pure glass over the city, the daylight and the bustle of the city vibrant and near.  His office didn’t have the same access to the world. The world didn’t have access to him.  He wasn’t sure if it was beneficial or not.  He was sure it was intentional.
From: SamIAm 10:34am
could be like Steve, at least a little more.  He brushed off Steve’s thanks glibly, but he could hear the wonder in his voice.
Steve-related.
The reporter turned a predatory eye on him, but Steve was clearly not playing ball.
“Yes, sir?”
“You know, there’s a fair amount of irony in this.  Considering whose file this is. But there’s just something about the feel of manila.  It feels right. This is the way a file should feel,” Coulson rambled, smiling.  He stopped in front of Steve’s desk.  “This one. This is the big guy.  He’s been through a lot.  Cut him a little slack, will you? He’s a good guy.  Hides it well. But when all the cards are on the table, well…” He set the packet down with a hefty thump. “I hear you knew his dad.  I think this one’s an upgrade.”
Tony laughed, giving up the pose and the sultry voice. “You’re so…” He tossed the stylus on the desk and moved to stand over Steve.  He bent down, hand reaching out for Steve’s face, drawing him in. He settled into Steve’s lap, mouth closing over Steve’s, tilting his head back and recapturing his lips.  Tony licked over Steve’s mouth, sucking on his lower lip, Steve’s hands coming up to hold Tony’s hips. “You’re so distracting,” Tony finally said. “What’s Clint going to think when his arrows start exploding before they’re supposed to?”
56 seconds.
“What are you talking about?”
Bucky looked up, squinching his eyes against the sunlight, hearing something in Steve’s tone.
“Thank you, Jarvis,” Steve said, making his way toward the office near his room.  He paused.  “You don’t need to call me Captain. I’m not.” He swallowed. “I’m not in the army anymore.”
It had only been a few hours, but he missed him.  The house felt too empty. Steve brought warmth and life to this place that Tony hadn’t even known was missing.  Now, though, it was all he could focus on.  The cold that seeped in when Steve left.  Not that he regretted sending him away.  It was the right thing to do.  Barnes needed him, and Steve didn’t owe Tony anything.  Everyone got what he or, well, he needed.  Barnes got his friend, and his friend’s contract.  Steve got freedom from Stern.  Tony had an unbelievably talented PA for nearly a month. He rubbed his hands over his tired eyes, then ran his hand over the metal in his chest.
“I found what Barnes was looking for, Steve.  I know you were in Project Rebirth. I found Howard’s papers, your contract.”
Tony smothered his laugh in Steve’s neck.  “Or at least he’ll know what I was thinking about when I was making them.” He pulled himself up and kissed Steve between words. “You. Are. Devastatingly. Sexy.”
Suddenly, his hand was swinging loosely by his side, Stane was yelping, his nose gushing blood, and Steve was giving Tony a somewhat sheepish look from across the room, rubbing his knuckles.
Steve hopped in the shower, still trying not to think about ice cream, and gave Natasha the video without his translation.  She didn’t need it, and he wanted independent confirmation.  She wrote down what Raza was saying, not falling for Steve’s misinterpretations. She noted the dates and the location, moving swiftly through the messages.  She’d made her way through the chain by the time he was done getting dressed. Impressive, as always. Steve looked them over.  He’d been pretty close, but her translations were better than Google. He handed the notes to Bucky.
Tony lingered in the elevator when they reached the garage, not going back up to his workshop, but not stepping into the garage either. “Is there something you need here? I tried to make your room all, you know, you, but I’m happy to make changes if you want something. You just have to tell me, or Pep, or well, no, probably just me, Pep’s designer is a little too into feathers, if you know what I mean, but we can customize however you want. Those floors were mostly a base plan anyway.” He made a note on his phone, muttering “sheets” under his breath. Then he looked back up, eyes sharp. “Is this about this morning? It’s not a big deal, Rogers. Look, we’re in a new era, it’s not the end of the world when two guys wake up together. Not the first time it’s happened to me, although sure, usually not a coworker, or, you know, someone who’s almost double my age, I’m not usually the Anna Nicole type, you know?”
that man, and he owed him the truth.  Tony twisted the watch again, feeling the metal edge bite deep.
“Lock it down, J.”
,” and Bruce’s (“Shakespearean Reference to Scientific Developments”). He had never been more grateful for whatever luck that plopped her squarely in his high school for his senior year.  His email pinged.
“It was StarkTech,” Rhodey added gently.
She looked downright furious at him. “He owes you, Steven. More than just some sop-gut apology that Fury’s going to send him over with.”
Not on Tony’s watch.
“I hear nothing either, Captain,” Thor responded, mouth full of rice.
He took a deep breath and rolled up the blueprints, tucking them under his arm, and marched straight to Mr. Stark’s office.
Tony’s eyes went wide, but he did as he was told.  That was interesting.  He was never all that good at taking orders without question in the field, but now he complied without protest, stripping his shirt off and letting it fall on the floor.
Tony closed the door.  Ugh.  Where had he gone so wrong? He’d only seen what he wanted to see.  After all, how many guys had had a friend move away? How many guys didn’t want to disappoint their parents? Basically everyone, on some level.  Even Tony, himself, to some extent.  And who didn’t love Batman? He’d heard Clint go on a rant that lasted the entire lunch period about how Batman was way better than any other superhero, and his entire thesis was that “he could shoot better.” Not only inaccurate, but extremely long-winded.
He stayed away a long time.
. “It’s true.” His side is already starting to heal.  It’s unfortunate. He likes focusing on that feeling. It helps.
Ouch. As if that question didn’t literally keep Steve up at night. Coulson had thought Steve was getting a friend.  So had Steve for that matter.  But clearly that wasn’t Stark’s intention.  Not with that tone.  With that spite for Steve’s very existence.  Steve tried to make a conciliatory effort—he could empathize with Tony. If Howard turned as cruel as it seemed he had, well, Steve knew what those men were like.  “We are supposed to strive to be kind,” he began, thinking of the way Howard must have abandoned that path.  “To be brave,” he added under his breath, thinking of himself and how he wished he felt brave now, in the face of such startling modernity. “And—”
This was a little weird.  Weird wasn’t really good for data though. Hard to quantify the effects of the apple if “weird” was all he had to go on.
“Flying,
Tony grabbed the file from Rhodey he’d never gotten around to opening.  Looked at that squiggly little code again.
Steve looks around.  Tries to think of a better solution.  Doesn’t see one.  He starts pulling off his costume in the goddamn hallway.
Tony willed himself to think of other things. Anything else.  He kept running over the details in his mind. Who was Flying?  Was he being catfished? What details had he missed? A guy on a bike, with a blaring throwback boombox, weaving drunkenly through the park, blasted The Ataris for the sleeping squirrels and pigeons.
“The one thing Howard got right, and it was this,” Tony said, derision clear in his voice.  “Muscles. And I thought today was going to be a good day. I got a full night’s sleep, I ate breakfast.  And then this piece of sheer idiocy. It’s a goddamn monument.” His tone turned more deeply bitter.  “What the hell am I supposed to do with this? Of all the things.  Why did it have to be you?”
“You sure? Is there something else you wanted?” Tony asked. They’d been together for a while. Maybe Steve wanted something different, something new.
Steve had been confident in her abilities, but what had Nat said that got the senator to back off so quickly?
Tony grabbed Steve’s hand as she left.  “I’ll take you home,” he said.
Pepper had walked over to the other man, still lying on the floor.  She looked for blood, but there didn’t seem to be any.  Eventually she poked at his cheek with the point of her shoe.  “What about this one?”
He wasn’t wrong, Tony thought.  On any counts.  He was so much better than Tony’s normal partners.  And Tony was happy.
Steve opens his eyes. “Yes,” he says, and Tony knows it’s a promise.
“Just, tell me what you see.” He held his breath.  Maybe he had been wrong.  Maybe this was something else entirely.  He could have been overly suspicious, overly protective, like Bucky was always saying that he was.
“Wait, no, seriously, what are you talking about?” Tony asked again.
Steve coughs, like he’s a little embarrassed.  His tone says it too, he’s actually embarrassed for both of them. “Did you look at who’s running the school?”
Steve goes red, then white.  He makes a tiny sound in the back of his throat.  Keeps that calm demeanor fixed in place.
, as Sir generally finds it quite soothing.”
Tony had the glass halfway to his mouth when Steve came into the room, smiling goofily and swaying just a little.
They paused kissing, turning to look at their friends, Steve’s arms encircling Tony naturally, the most obvious position in the world.  Rhodey was giving them a thumbs up and Natasha just winked slowly.  Peggy kept up her catcalling and Sam joined in, a loud caterwaul under a perfect full moon.
Better, Tony thought.  “Clint, shoot him if he gets any clever ideas, would you?”
Steve looked up quickly, chastised. If Tony hadn’t been watching closely, he would have missed the lie. “I forgot Natasha’s birthday. Not a big deal. We’ve been putting together a book from her old unit.  Bucky gave it to her without me.” He made a face.  Not a lie.  Not exactly. Tony would have put money on at least half of that all being true. He could just have Jarvis pull up the texts later.  If he needed. Not that he would. Probably. But if Steve was in trouble…
Steve sat up, still holding Tony’s hand, watched the light advance closer, desperately wanting to block out the sun, finally understanding Thanos’s desire to control the universe, if he could only turn back the clock on this one, live forever in this day.
Sam plopped his tray down at the table, unceremoniously depositing his carrot sticks on Steve’s tray and grabbing his apple slices instead.  Steve just rolled his eyes.
“Um, thanks, buddy,” Tony said.  “Don’t you think some hipsters are going to miss their gardening project? It’ll probably interrupt their organic salads if we take this.”
also, I had to make minor changes to chapters 10 and 11 (I think) for continuity.
“Sure,” Tony agrees, not agreeing at all.  “Wilson? Barton?”
“Wait a goddamn minute, what did he mean ‘difficult time of year’?” Rhodey asked, making Tony smile gratefully on the inside.
Steve sat in the corner of the bed, holding Bucky’s hand as he slept it off.  It had been a bad night. Alcohol had always fueled bad dreams for Bucky. He knew it, but he’d been so devastated yesterday it hadn’t mattered.  Turned down by the VA.  No real answers, just a vague dismissal from the program.  Natasha had apparently left.  Packed a bag and taken off.  Her stuff was mostly still around, and Steve had a feeling she wasn’t gone for good, but Buck had been too distraught see anything with a clear eye.
Natasha’s reaction was so steady.  He could trust her.  He could.  He hadn’t known her that long, but she would keep his secrets.
Steve put his bowl down on the counter immediately.
.  That’s what he used to call himself when he was in school and competing in kickboxing.  But he’s just a low-level bureaucrat.  There’s no way he has the money to buy a yacht.  Especially not one like that.  Not on his own. And I read through HammerTech’s public declarations for the French market—they want to release their new model early next week.  I think he’s trying to get a jump on you.”
“Who says it’s for you? It’s for me.  I’ve finally found one that lasts.  That’s big.  That’s like, mini golf big.  Dancing big.  Piñata big.” He shoved a cracker in his mouth, chewing for a moment.  “So what do you think, Rogers? Dancing? Mini golf?”
Bucky pushed the lid of his laptop shut and set his hand on Steve’s shoulder.  “Steve, I’ve known you since we were small enough to wear diapers. I was there when you decided horses were evil without ever having met one in person—“
“Thought I’d finish reading Stark’s files from home,” Steve replied, equally mildly.  If it was sparring Coulson wanted, the niceties and politeness, Steve was well-trained.  If Coulson wanted to prove a point, he’d have to get mad.
Steve looked up, knowingly. He nabbed a piece of chicken and handed over the rest of his bowl.  Tony and the kitten both sniffed the air.  He had to stifle a laugh.
Tony was inwardly delighted.  Pepper was handling Johansson with grace, getting him fully on board with the new project. Tony thought he might have met a new collaborator—collaborators, actually—a pair of sweet, enthusiastic British kids.  They might be able to come up with a replacement for the palladium that even Tony hadn’t yet.  Maybe. He wasn’t going to bet on it or anything, but the chance was there.  And Steve.  Steve had been at his side all night, distractingly and devastatingly handsome.  More than that, Steve had been watching his back, taking care of him.  He’d somehow managed to intercept every drink someone brought Tony, swapping them unobtrusively for a more innocuous imposter. He’d managed to divert Christine Everhart to an “inside scoop” with Maya Hansen, playing just dumb enough to make her lose interest in him. There was that Brooklyn kid, again. Tony was glowing internally, basking in the protective warmth of Steve’s focus and concern. He could feel Steve’s eyes on him like a caress.
“Where were you?”
And Christ, Stark was a mess.  Daddy issues on pseudodaddy issues the likes of which Steve hadn’t even imagined before he’d gone under.  Sure, Howard Stark had been a megalomaniac, smooth-talking dick, but not the cold angry sort.  Not the abusive sort.  But Steve understood the brittle shell Tony Stark had created, he understood the incessant need to be the brightest and the best.  He understood where it came from.  Steve wondered when Howard had changed.  What had changed him.  An uncomfortable little piece of him wondered if it was—but no, that was hubris. He could have smacked himself with how arrogant he’d been tending.  What a prig, Peggy would have said.  Bucky would have just called him an asshole.  He’d have been right.
Eventually Tony throws his hands up. The idiot doesn’t have a weapon—not even a goddamn shield. Tony goes back to the tower and opens a familiar file of measurements.
“Does Pepper have an override?” Steve asked, clasping at tenuous hope.
Tony buttoned up his shirt before a sea of cops flooded in, taking their cues from Pepper and Rhodey.  When they hauled Stane off in cuffs, Tony let out a little sigh he hadn’t known he’d been keeping in.  Steve had made his way back to his side, standing close enough that Tony could feel almost feel him, but not quite touching.  Tony turned to look at him, raising an eyebrow to indicate his question.
“Steve.  Do you. You gotta take care of yourself.  Go see an ocean, stay on a beach somewhere, chop down some trees. The world’ll be okay.”
I’m really glad finals are coming soon.  How was your day?” That was general. That was bland.  “I’ve been thinking about you a lot.” It was true.  He’d been hoping, a lot, that it wasn’t Rumlow.
“Something against the Air Force, Rogers?”
“Of course, sir,” Jarvis replied, sounding enormously satisfied.  Obie and Barnes flinched at the voice. Natasha blinked rapidly.
Steve knew what he wanted.  Knew it pure, like a flame.  “I don’t know if we can ever know the consequences, fully, ma’am,” he said.
Tony’s mind raced.  A guy, with a male best friend who moved out of the country. Well, no guarantees that Flying had always been part of the school. Maybe they both moved at the same time, if he said his friends were new.  That.  Really didn’t help the odds.  That still left approximately half the school.
To:  A-Team
use a parachute, you big hypocrite! And second what do you mean did
Tony hangs up.
“Clearly Wonder Woman is the only person who can take down an evil Luke Skywalker,” Natasha broke in.  “Right, Justin?”
His phone pinged, and Tony’s heart rate sped up in a pavlovian response.  It was a text.  Fuck.  Then his heartrate really did speed up.  It was from Hammer.
“Yeah yeah, let’s go get your new playdate,” Tony grumbled, hiding the rising tension.  When they pulled up, Jimmy had quite the smile on his face.
Very gently, she took his face in her right hand and brought his eyes to look at her.  She slid the left hand toward him, then drew it up to interlace with his fingers that were holding his shirt.  “Whenever you’re ready,” she said, clear and low. She kissed him.  “I’ll never walk out on you.” A plain gold band glinted on the table.
They were all trained to deal with this, they had all dealt with it several times for that matter because every mission or battle there is always one innocent civilian who gets trapped between the misfire and they always react with their own version of going into shock. So they knew what they were dealing with but yet it was so different for Steve and to some extent the team because this was his Tony and his Tony was only sixteen and shouldn’t have to be dealing with this.
“yeah, he was having a hard time, but Dr.Brandon was there and we had things to over see.“ Steve nodded ,as he pointed to the papers
“I need you at my place stat" Steve cut her off ,he was practically growling and to be honest it was scaring Tony somewhat
“five years ago when you were pulled from the ice, we reached out to obadiah and asked him to bring Tony over because we knew you could protect him and if howard was alive he would have trusted Steve with his son . But obadiah refused , he didn’t want to trust any of us with Tony. It took us tremendous effort to convince obadiah to let tony come to school here. But his one condition was to not tell Tony who you were , because he wanted to protect the boy from every danger that comes from being associated with us.”
“did you know my parents were murdered?” he asked softly looking down
“I know you didn’t draw that conclusion just from what natasha said, please tell me what you are thinking” he asked trying to coax Tony into talking about the fact that he had chosen Bucky over him when he needed him
They arrived at the museum twenty minutes later and Steve got down to find natasha , Clint waiting for them at the parking lot .
Steve did take him for his pizza and waited patiently while Tony over chewed every bite. Steve hid a smile as he tried to deflect the conversation every possible way and chuckled when he insisted he needed to stop at a mechanic's to buy some tools.
He watched as Tony’s fingers traced every little mark already healing rapidly on his skin and when he was done Steve put his shirt back on with Tony’s permission.
Tony fished out a couple of things dropping then onto  he bed and Steve raised him arms a little to give him better access as he laid there watching Tony work.
It was truly a spectacular sight! An entire block was covered in what looked like some sort of radium glow. Anything the creature (with long sqiggly legs and arms as lanky as a man with no bones) brushed against seemed to absorb some sort of energy while radiating a blue and pink light.
“let’s not worry about that now okay?” Steve was really regretting the anger he had shown towards Tony for drinking .
“Bullshit, tell me natasha” he said staring her down “is this why you said it was dangerous?” And her lack of reaction was a clear enough answer.
“please Steve not like this" he said again his voice pleading and it tugged at Steve's heart as he realized what Tony was trying to say.  Easing his fingers down to his chin, Steve kissed him on his cheek softly
“I was talking about the ones under here” he said as he reached for Tony’s shirt and lifted a little and when Tony didn’t protest he tugged the shirt over his head dropping it to the floor.
"Ok children,that's enough bickering for the day. Let's eat , I am starving!"
“Tony , “ he started softly “when you came to my apartment the day after I came from my mission and saw Bucky , what was your first thought?” and Tony gave him a confused look
“It’s a secret lair ?”
something in Steve snapped at that . Up until now he actually had no intention of doing anything too vulgar because Tony was only sixteen. But somehow Steve thought the only way to make Tony get over it is to create a better memory to let the others fade.
“ Look at me Tony, come on just like the other day yeah?”
“I am sorry about your parents, I didn’t know”. He said softly not looking at tony.
Tony moaned at the contact and he immediately relaxed in his hold.
“Hey sweetheart, welcome back” he said as he leaned down to wipe Tony's sweaty hair off his forehead
“ it’s steve, can you open your eyes for me? I have some water for you to drink, just a little bit , come on baby” Tony shuffled a little and Steve held him still , keeping him from falling .
“You think Tony told him?” both of them shook their heads sharply before natasha calmly explained
“We are super spies , or maybe you would know us better as black widow and hawkeye"
tony stumbled back a step at how angry Steve sounded but at this point Steve was beyond being bothered.
“He is not naked,” he said defensively but she just pursed her lips putting on a sad look.
“no , I am happy for you. You seem to be doing well, I know I cant be trusted and that you will never be comfortable with me around him. But for what it’s worth Stevie, he seemed like a nice kid.” He said smiling
“Who are you calling?” he asked as he ran his palm across his face roughly trying to calm down
“We could have saved this you know” Clint started but Steve knew how dangerous their job was, it was one of the reasons why Steve couldn’t tell his students, they were all just kids. So was tony.
“Can you walk? We should get you to the nurses room. You can lay down for a while okay?” he said helping her up and as she stood her knees buckled and Steve heard several gasps as he caught her and picked her up striding out of the gym towards the nurses room.
Tony carefully peeled the shirt over his head , Steve didn’t waste a second before scanning his eyes all over the teens the abdomen chest. He didn’t see anything new. The same bruises Steve’s hands had left and a few patches from the blast.
"How are you feeling?" He asked as settled down next to the flustered teen who still seemed too rigid as he clutched tightly onto the ice cream bowl.
“You are hurt" he said simply cocking his head eyes finally settling on Steve’s face
“do you need some water? You are getting a little pale for my liking" he asked as Tony watched Steve’s hand carefully until it settled back onto his chest on the same spot.
The tears fell and Steve let him cry it out and eventually they stopped and Steve sighed
“What about the girl? Pepper?is she okay?”
Tony squeezed his eyes shut and nodded as Steve continued undoing them and let his broad hands settle along his narrow torso pushing aside his shirt letting it slip over his shoulder a bit to reveal the small coffee colored nipples Steve had come to like so much.
“Very funny" he grumbled as he ran his fingers up Steve’s chest his forehead puckering a little as he traced the outline of a faint bruise along his torso where Bucky had kicked him .
Making quick work , he pulled Tony’s boxers up and helped him into his pants. Tony noticed the sudden tremble his fingers had taken over as he tried to clean up around him.
Two more minutes of natasha and Tony talking back and forth and Steve was done. He was sooo done , like really he needed out. Now.
He knew this was him taking advantage of Tony’s drugged state of mind,  but he had make sure he wasn’t going to be making a mistake by revoking the restraining order.
“hey, everything alright?” Steve asked as he sat down opposite to him after politely declining the seat offered from the chemistry teacher. She had been trying for a while to get Steve’s attention on her but he obviously wasn’t interested, that didn’t stop her from trying though.
“have you guys never heard of knocking?” Steve said jokingly
“Bruce will come by in the morning, he just needs some time. I got you some too, do you want me to feed it to you?” she asked as she notices Steve’s hands were currently occupied with a sleeping genius.
Steve was honestly starting to get tired now. Two more days and the three weeks they had set the time limit to would be over. The team would come for him in just two more days.
“And they look very cool on you too" he said and bent down to trail butterly kissed along his shoulders and his chest and Tony giggled trying to squirm away from him and the dog tags lying on his chest clinked together making Steve move to them and kiss around them.
“I am perfectly fine, see?” he said stepping out of the bathroom and Steve smiled as he noticed the blush along Tony’s neck . In unfolding the towel Steve pulled Tony towards him and ran the towel through his hair until it stopped dripping,  tony all the while struggled to get out Steve’s embrace , whining like a child about being fussed over.
“Do it now" he said clenching his hands tight showing them that he was ready
Tony sat quietly , pliant as Steve ran his fingers over his mottled skin to check for any breaks or more serious injury . Tony cooperating meant something was wrong and it nagged at Steve’s brain until he remembered Tony favouring his left side.  He made quick work on his pants which he now realized were clints, no wonder they looked so big on him.  Tony resisted when Steve tugged on the waistband to pull them down and Steve immediately knew that there was something he was hiding there.
Steve couldn’t open his mouth, everything stane was saying was right, there was absolutely no argument there.
“No coffee until the drugs are out of your system" tony blushed , embarrassment clouding his face. Steve hated that Tony was embarrassed about it. It didn’t sit well with him that Tony was not the least bit angry with what happened and was only embarrassed to tell Steve.
“I don’t know, but I believe they will aleast know how to handle you when you are being unreasonable" steve laughed , it was more of “yeah , right" sarcastic laugh and Bruce shook his head again at him
“Agent Coulson!” Steve called for Phil as he saw him walk by the bull pen of the operations department where he went looking for Natasha and Clint.
“Can you do it?” he asked and Steve sighed considering just lying to Tony that he had no medical experience whatsoever even though shield had given him extensive lessons to manage almost all situations.
“You don’t give sick kids chocolate steve" she said amused and their eyes locked above Tony’s head
“Color baby?” he asked as his eyes bore into Tony’s,  fear and everything mixed into something that Steve wasn’t able to read.
“I don’t want to go”
Steve gave a shuddering sigh and nodded heading back inside and just as he was about to open the door she said
“you are not my father , you don’t get to decide what’s good for me and neither is Stane!” Tony was fighting hard to keep himself from crying , Steve could tell from the way his voice hitched between the last sentence.
“Right" steve said ducking just in time. He wasn’t so sure what he can do to actually make Tony’s recovery better, but the thought of Tony fighting the medical equipment around him scared him.
“show me the injury, please” Steve said turning to Tony but Tony only moved farther away from Steve into the couch.
"wanna ssleep" I slurred.
“Is he alright Mr rogers?” he startled a little at Anna’s voice and he turned to look at her.
It took a few seconds for Steve to calculate that if what natasha said was true then Tony had in infact anything to eat since the past thirty hours or so give or take.
"Jarvis? How is Tony's mood right now?"
Tony’s face perked up so fast , both peggy and Steve chuckled
“I really hope you didn’t let widow beat you again this time.”
“Is it time?” he asked as he scrubbed the weariness out of his face.
Steve frowned , they had only thought it was enough reason to give them sometime time to think of a better reason. Something didn’t seems right and he continued frowning and  Tony caught on,
“So , anyways” Clint started “ we got food, do you want salad or cheeseburgers?” and Tony made a face at him as if to say ‘ are you dumb?’
I groaned at that "Tony, honey, it's a party for you and what you have accomplished with your new SI upgrade. How about you refrain from working for just the two hours and enjoy for a while huh?" Tony was always a workaholic, it's something I have always admired about him. But off-late it was getting out of control. Ever since the fainting episode one week ago he has seemed a little off. It's been obvious that he's been having trouble sleeping, I know that from all the tossing and turning he's been doing at night. He's not been spending as much time with the team either. I just hope this party is the break he needs.
“I know honey, but who’s fault was this huh?” she said and Tony rolled his eyes at her.
“Clint I love you" tony whispered secretly but the entire room heard anyway.
“Okay, then let’s go jog" he said pulling Tony by the wrist towards his room.
“I I-I need to see him please, there was …there wa-s so much blood pleas-se"
Tony squawked trying to get out while Steve used one hand to hold him there and the other to get the shampoo bottle open.
“Oh you have no idea" Steve said as he his fingers finding a sensitive spot on Tony’s torso feeling him squirm underneath him trying to get away from his touch
Steve removed the tube carefully slowly and Tony’s sigh of relief was such a beautiful thing for Steve to hear. The whole process took about two minutes and Tony held his breath the whole time with Steve having to remind him to breathe so he wouldn’t pass out.
“You were dead" he repeated again clinging onto Steve’s robe and Steve rubbed his palm along his back trying to soothe him but it was not helping any as Tony’s breathing took a harsh turn and he started gasping for air.
“I didn’t say you have to go home” Steve said, waiting for tony to understand what he was saying,
“you need to stay down, for a few minutes Mr.stark" he nodded his head no, pushing away our hands and sat up ,he swayed as he sat there on the bed so I moved behind him and slowly tipped him backwards until he was leaning on my chest. He still looked a little disoriented but that was to be expected.
“fine, go!” steve said squeezing Tony’s hand before letting go.
“His surgeon-" steve was going to ask if he could meet him before but Bruce cut him off “waiting for us in the office. Take a shower and meet me in the cafeteria. We need to eat . Nat will come by in ten minutes and stay with him until you are back.”
“Debrief where? Is Tony okay?” he asked rushing to get up from the bed looking around for anything that could help him freshen up.
“Shut up"
“Oh.” Was all he said and Steve let out a long exhale as he reached over and grabbed the sandwiches handing over one to Tony and watched him take a bite and chew meticulously like it was the most important thing to be doing right in that moment.
”I don’t want to go home” he said rolling his eyes
“is this what you were going to tell me tomorrow?” steve asked him as Tony’s hold tightened
“Bruce please you have to-" he cut him off and Bruce moved closer to the bed
“Hi, welcome back" he said tersely and Steve deserved the tone honestly. He made his way over to the couch placing the bags down onto the floor next to his feet and sat down between the two of them. Neither of them stopped playing and Steve settled in to wait until the game was over.
“Are you sure nothing happened baby?” he asked once more as he held Tony’s gaze , the sudden neediness was worrying Steve but he will take what he gets.
They had a peaceful breakfast , well as peaceful as it could be with Clint and tony blasting paint everywhere.
Tony’s eyes drifted everywhere before meeting his and once they were finally on him Steve brushed the tears away with his thumbs big hands framing his face.
“Tony tell me, steve let him talk” he commanded and Tony looked between steve and Bruce for a second
He nodded “will you take care of him?”
Three years ,it has been since Steve started this gig as a history teacher . Actually it wasn’t a gig, it was something he really wanted to do. Shield had graciously set him up with the school, he even received a salary. It was as official as it could be, albeit the missions and impromptu world saving that occasionally kept him from school. Only a few people at school were aware of Steve’s hero status. As far as the world was concerned, captain America went in the ice eleven years ago and was found four years back and hasn’t cared to surface in the public eye. While everyone knew captain America, nobody knew ‘Steve Rogers’ , the high school history teacher and he wanted to keep it that way.
“Stress can have that effect, but what you are describing seems to me like a case of anemia, we can do a blood test.” Tony shook his head immediately scowling at them both
“Can you please take your shirt off?” he asked as he picked up his stethoscope and put it around his neck. Steve could tell Tony really didn’t want to and he slowly sauntered over towards him and sat on the bed  beside him.
Steve was now unknowingly sulking, he knows he has no say over it.
“Tony” Steve tried again as he followed Tony out the bedroom and watched him scramble around to get bag and shoes.
“Thank you , steve" bucky said quietly
“Nothing" he mumbled as he walked backwards and out of Steve’s classroom.
“Don’t you dare give up on him" she said pouring her own coffee as she sat down across from Steve
“The cut on your cheek that disappeared, the occasional absence from school . Thanks for that by the way ,the sub was such a dud! Oh and of course the muscles! “
“sorry" he said sitting up and looking around and Steve chuckled at his state, he was thoroughly disheveled and he looked like he could sleep for another ten hours straight.
“I just know things” he said smiling smugly at the brunette as he watched Tony put two and two together.
He then leaned over and gave Tony a soft kiss , pulling him carefully onto his lap where he could palm the reactor , he placed his palm carefully over it feeling the soft hum it created. Tony fidgeted t RT ying to get away or atleast turn around but Steve held him firmly.
“okay,” Steve conceded and tony initially looked like he didn’t believe him but eventually relaxed his fingers and leaned forward against his chest again, his hands trapped between them.
“she is just doing her job tony, it’s okay. I am right here I wont let anything happen . You can trust me.”
“How did you get here?” he asked them
“you will show me later? That you are fine?”
steve watched Tony’s expression change from fear to wonder and then to something he hadn’t been expecting , his cheeks turned a bright pink, it was not all bad considering how pale he was but Steve quickly realised that he was blushing.
“he thinks you are mad at him” Steve’s eyes snapped up to hers
“he has to be in school tomorrow can you-"
Steve closed his eyes for a second taking a deep breath and let it out trying to grasp all the information and really take it in.
“hmph ow" he mumbled sleepily as he shifted again to find the warmth.
“honey, I cant talk right now.”
“Has this happened before?” Curiosity was taking over and Steve needed to reign it in because he knows how defensive tony gets but when he was met with silence he knew it was already a lost cause.
Steve startled but he knew they had to talk about this. But he also didn’t have a good answer for him.
“where are you going?” he mumbled his voice thick from exhaustion. Steve was just surprised that Tony was still awake.
“so captain America huh? “ and Steve simply smiled
Tony clutched at him tighter almost clinging , Steve flipped him around so that Tony back was flush against his chest.
“I am always good" he scoffed shifting to get even closer to him.
“Kay.”
He felt Tony nod against his chest and he bent down to level his mouth near Tony’s ear “that was the hottest thing ever baby, nothing has ever turned me on more” he said knowing his low pit he’d voice was making the hair on Tony’s skin stand.
“can I put it on you?” he asked again gently bring the mask closer and when Tony didn’t shy away again he held it up over Tony’s nose and mouth feeling Tony resist the air flow
“I need to use the ladies room, I’ll be right back okay? It was nice seeing you tony” and she was off. Steve wanted to know what she had found but he understood that he needed to deal with tony first.
"I can send someone to draw some blood" all three of them jumped at the new voice , tony more so than the others.
“okay get some sleep, it’s going to be a long day tomorrow”  she told him and left pulling the door closed quietly behind her.
“I am a little tired, but nothing a little food won’t fix" tony gave a stifled laugh and Steve gave a confused look
“well, I did get kidnapped today" steve said carefully using his left hand to support Tony’s back and keep him stable as he pushed back eyes wide
“Uhm, think I’ll get my own” Steve smirked
“What do you want to know?” Fury asked, resignation lacing his tone.
steve reached for the cloth, wetting it in the warm water ,ran it over Tony’s face to clear off the soot and grime. It seemed to bring tony out of his shock as he took a few shuddering breaths and pushed away with a still trembling hand on Steve’s chest to look at him.
“right here” he said as Tony pulled away rubbing his hands over his eyes and Steve pulled them away from his face
"This is not going to be possible on this budget, you will have to give us more wiggle room on this one." Steve argued.
“I am here.” He paused for a second and Tony looked up at him
"Uhm thank you" he said politely
“Are you planning to study for it?”
Looking down at his face, I saw the paleness still persisting from yesterday night. I kissed his forehead as gently as possible trying to get a read on the temperature of his skin. In tony's anger we didn't have a chance to take his temperature with the thermometer. I frowned at the heat emanating from his.
“its okay if he doesn’t eat full meals, just maybe small portions broken down throughout the day. Whatever trauma he underwent seems to be weighing him down, kids these days don’t feel the need to share but if you can get him to open up he will find that he Is feeling better” the doctor said smiling at him confidently and Steve nodded back forehead creased as he tried to pay complete attention to him.
“Here, “ steve was handed a  cup of coffee “where is tony?”
“exactly , we can’t let that happen again. I don’t want you to get caught up in the middle like this ever again” Steve explained
Two more nurses came in followed by a cameraman who silently settled into the corner.
“ its embarrassing to talk about” he mumbled as he tried to hide his face in Steve’s chest but steve wouldn’t let him , he pushed him back and held him there.
“You don’t talk,  I bet you didn’t even know anna has the biggest crush on you! What am I saying , everyone does” That caught steve off guard and his smile dropped as he stared at Tony taking in his very serious expression.
“try – a whole LOT of food" stve chuckled , he was not wrong. With Steve’s metabolism the refrigerator needed stocking everyday. Good thing it was paid for by shield.
“Good morning" steve said with the best smile he could muster and Tony smiled back tentatively as he tried to stretch.
Nat and I decided to get refreshed and watch a movie while waiting for Tony Bruce and thor to return. Thor was probably to go back to jane's though. She always insisted that he see her as soon as the debrief. I understood that, just the same way I needed to see Tony now and make sure he is alright. I walked up to our room, upon entering there were two things I spotted immediately – 1)the bed was unkempt, which meant the call for the team had happened when Tony had just woken up or still sleeping. And 2)the iron pills I had left for Tony on the nightstand still remained in the exact same place I left it. Which meant he has not had any form of iron supplements in the past two days.
“I…” he blushed a tinge red “Kay.”
“A doctor cannot heal a cut in a day either” he was not wrong and Steve felt the small sheen of sweat that was starting to form across his forehead in panic.
“he said I could say goodbye to my friends.” He said shrugging his shoulders , he turned full bodied to Steve looking at him through his lashes “did you know they were murdered?”
“Is it already morning?” he asked
Nobody other than shield knew of his existence after he was unfrozen so it didn’t matter anyway. Steve’s lack of care to the news had only irritated him and he had left.
“I need you to lay still for just a few more seconds okay? Can you tell me if anything hurts anna?” she took her time and only after confirming once again that nothing hurt he let her sit up and supported her as he gave her the rehydration solution.
“Morning” He said as he scratched at his throat and grinned cheekily at Steve
“That’s only one” he said and ofcourse , who was stve trying to fool.
“I’ll deal with it , sir”
He dropped his head on Tony’s and sighed as he felt Tony relax.
“I will feel the need the need to protect you no matter your age.”
“Good, that’s good Bucky. Can I touch you?” he asked as he watched buckys body suddenly trembling like he was going to fall. After a slight nod he carefully gripped at his elbow pulling him closer ,it seemed to ground him more. But Steve’s intentions were to keep him away from Tony. And suddenly he remembered Tony and his head snapped towards him.
"Bruce and Natasha are waiting for us in the common room" I said to him and he visibly tensed when he realized that we had already discussed this behind his back. "Clint and thor will join us in an hour for dinner" I continued as the elevator opened and we stepped out.
“No" he mumbled and Steve lifted his chin forcing Tony to look at him “I swear nothing happened, I left before anything could" he said when he realized steve was not particularly believing him.
I woke up to the smell of singed metal. Wrinkling my nose I opened my eyes to find the source. Would you look at that! My entire left side of the Armour was black instead of its usual glimmering red. Someone was saying something to me, I should probably respond to them.
“you are back.” He said “how are you doing?” steve felt a little confused at the question that followed but he nodded anyway.
He realized that when he had told natasha that they had to monitor his urine output would have been when Tony realized that they had inserted a catheter.  Steve could have smacked himself in the face for not realizing sooner.
“we are going to need him to talk if we want to do this legally, which I am presuming is the best way to go ahead with this, considering that there is a company at stake" steve frowned, he hadn’t thought of that.
"ton-" I started to say in argument but Nat interrupted me walking into the room with clint
“where is bruce?” Tony asked suddenly, uncharacteristically quiet.
He had been holding back , allowing him to explore knowing or thinking that for Tony,  this relationship is just one of the many he is going to have until he finds the right one. He was only a teenager after all. But that wasn't the problem, the problem was that Steve had fallen very hard for this kid and there was no going back.
Tony’s breaths were now tethering on the edge of hyperventilating ,Steve gave him a small smile tipping his chin up to divert his mind from his pulsing erection
“James Buchanan barnes ,aka bucky was my bestfriend before your dad. We served in the military together, before the serum. We always , always had each others backs no matter what. Bucky and my mum were the only two people I have ever loved in my life.” Tony's eyes snapped up to meet Steve's
Steve took a moment to catalogue the faces, his eyes stopping at one. His breath faltered just a tiny bit when the brown eyes looked up to meet his. The new kid.
“Baby, look at me” steve asked using a hand to force tony to look at him
“just this once. Please.” He said and Steve glared at him
