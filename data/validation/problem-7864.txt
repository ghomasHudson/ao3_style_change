Otto starts his presentation with a joke. It’s horrible, yet people still laugh because of the suddenness of it. Even Tony realizes he has a small grin on his face, and he’s happy to see Peter smile as well. He gives him a small poke on the side to catch his attention, holding up his thumb while looking at him questioningly.
“Shhhh.” Then there’s another kiss on the lips. Tony shuts his mouth at last, waiting for Steve to continue. “Honey, I’m not proposing, it’s
This is it, after all.
“So? What’s your question?” she asks. Peter clears his throat.
There’s Karen in his ears, begging him to stop, not to do it. Wanda’s behind him, warning him that she’ll stop him is she has to. Vision is quiet, seemingly shocked about what is happening there.
“Duly noted, FRIDAY. All I need to do then is just make sure that he
“Yeah, I was wondering if I could get a ride, maybe I can help out and all? Besides, I’ve always wanted to make a trip on Captain America’s motorcycle,” Peter jokes. The Captain sits up a little bit, but there’s a smirk on his face that gives Peter enough hope that he’ll accept his proposition.
“Now, if you all excuse me, I’m getting some work done in the workshop, alright?” Tony excuses himself. Before anybody else can respond, he’s already out of the door with his tablet under his arm. Peter catches the sad look on Steve’s face when he sees him go, and for a moment he wonders if they’ve been fighting. But Peter remembers how he’s found them here on the couch, so he figures they must be alright, no?
“Hey, dude!” Peter calls out. The man lowers his glasses – they’re reading glasses, not good for far-sight – and then starts smiling as well.
“You guys are saps,” Tony says, though feeling very grateful for it.
"Tonight
And true to her word, a light starts shining somewhere on Peter’s right. Peter hurries to it, opening it up until he finds things that
“Just, uh, remind me again how Tony Stark’s son ended up being, uh,
“It’s anomalous, I know,” he told her.
“Yeah, well, as horrible as it is to say, Peter wasn’t the reason for that,” Tony confesses. “I would have gone, but I was just… burying myself in self-pity. It’s ridiculous, really.”
Tony gives Natasha a long look before scoffing.
“Rogers! You have visitors!”
Yaël grinned widely and looked at the hole in the wall she had caused. A darker-skinned man and an athletic looking woman with furious red hair stared at her with big eyes from the hallway where the hole led to. Then the woman smirked.
“My buddy Peter here has been feeling down. You think you could boost him up at least for the wedding?”
“Rogers-Stark,” Tony says before standing up. He lives for that wordless expression on Steve’s face as Tony gets back to his feet and starts walking towards the kitchen with his now empty glass in his hands. Then, behind him, he can hear Steve mutter to himself.
“I look like a cosplayer at a convention,” Tony mutters.
“Let us inside, please,” Peter says, voice shivering all of the sudden. If FRIDAY would stimulate him in using the codes, that could only mean that there’s something incredibly wrong, right?
“FUN?!” Peter shouts all of the sudden. “When have we been hanging out where we actually had
“Oh God…”
“What the hell happened, Vision?” Yaël asked down the gigantic hole through the floors of the building. That looks expensive enough to fix…
She would have helped him figure it out. She would have been by his side when he’d have his talk with Stark. She’d help him find his words when Peter couldn’t.
“You know what? Yeah, that’s exactly what this is about. Because I was alright, and you just keep on pushing and pushing and shoving it in my face with your stupid apologies! And earlier today you were too busy helping out a madman to even realize my son had just once
“Tony?” he asks. Tony shrugs and drops the glasses next to the bed, on the nightstand. Then he takes off his jacket and throws it onto the chair in the corner of the room.
“I love you guys. May was there when I felt like I didn’t have anybody left. Tony was there to fill this hole in my life that my parents made when they died. Tony took me in and treated me as his own even before he knew I was his son. And you- you’ve taken care of me as Spider-Man and Peter, even before you know the two were the same.”
“Stark, I know how to get you back in time,” Wade calls out without really answering Charles. Tony’s almost afraid to hear what he’s got, but right now he’s about ready to hear every possibility, even if it’s from Wade Wilson.
“HEY! TH-THAT’S MA FUTURE-WIFE YOU’RE T-TALKING ‘BOUT!”
That’s probably how it is now, being a Stark.
As she closed the tap with her other hand, some water kept flowing in front of her fingers like a bubble. First, she played with it by moving her fingers, so the bubble danced however she wanted it to. She was controlling the water.
“Well, I don’t know,” Peter answers truthfully. Sure, he’d rather not tell his life story to Wade Wilson, but right now he’s one of the only friends he’s got. However sad that is. “For now, I’d rather he didn’t know, but on the other hand I really
, Peter thinks to himself. It would make sense.
“I’m glad you’re back, pal,” Peter tells him. Harry slaps his shoulder twice before pulling back.
“Because- uh… we’re public figures and- uh… it could make people wonder if they could take us seriously…”
“Is there something you need, Miss Stacey?” Peter hears Tony ask in the background. Peter’s head goes into his direction immediately. This Tony sounds exactly the same like Peter’s, if not a bit more exasperated. Without prompting, Peter walks up to him, taking off his mask at last.
On his way to the interview, Peter has thought about how his talk with Mr. Stark would have gotten. His mind had gone over a casual conversation to him eventually interviewing Mr. Stark instead to figure out what kind of man he is.
“So, uh, I had fun,” Peter mumbles towards her, feeling his cheeks burning. He can’t even look at her, instead keeping his eyes on the floor. She has nice shoes, he notices.
Tony shrugs. “I’m not sure how I got married here,” Tony says, lifting up his hand and seeing the wedding ring missing. He’s not sure he even saw Mary wearing one. “Other me got married to the first girl I loved. She was actually in a relationship, but we had a drunken night where I knocked her up. In my universe, she never left her guy and married him. Here, though, it seems like she made the wrong choice.”
“What do you think? That I would bring my seventeen-year-old son with me when school’s started again?” Tony snaps. He should really hold it in, but he’s not really in the mood for that.
“Don’t worry about being seen, I know some good incognito places. Just put on something nice, but not too nice.”
“You’re building a new one, aren’t you?” he’d asked. Tony’s eyes looked up to him, something looking like fear passing in his gaze.
FRIDAY says. “
And he’s hopeful. For ten minutes, he keeps his hopes up. But when, after that, Steve still doesn’t pick up, Tony figures the guy just doesn’t want to talk to him. And it hurts, a whole lot. No matter how often he tries, all he gets is voicemail. And not because Steve’s away; the guy actively declines the call, and eventually even turns off his phone.
When Yaël was finally finished with raking all the leaves it started pouring rain again. Then the rain turned into hail. Freaking January.
“Is everyone okay?” he asks. Of course, that’s what he asks. It’s still Peter.
I hope you like it! It's something else :-)
“She kind of did, but in my defense, I can’t afford to be called a misogynistic! Pepper would have killed me!”
“Oh,” her own body made her sick on purpose,that sounded weird.
“Peter, please, let’s not fight about this…please?” Her friend looked up at her and seemed a bit disordered.
Bruce gives him a weak smile before putting his glass down. Then he stretches his arms and yawns.
“Wow, uh, okay. Where did you get this, then?” she asks. “Did you make this yourself?”
“I used to be before I moved,” he says. Peter snorts, trying to imagine Ned in one of those costumes but not able to do it. “So who is going to be there? The X-Men? Fantastic Four? The Defenders?”
“Yaël?” her answer was another cough. Goddammit, he had her good this time.
Yaël started rolling another scoop, but before she could put it in her mouth, she noticed the woman was still staring at her and was annoyingly tapping her foot. So Yaël put her fork back down.
Wade also elected some sort of silky, Bordeaux dress and a velvet, blush one. These were all clothes Yaël was sure she would never wear, but she wanted to please Wade as he looked so proud every time she fitted one of them. Next to these, she also got some new pairs of jeans, shirts and sneakers. “Jeez, are you teaching these kids how to become nuns or something?” Wade asked while she was paying her stuff.
“Next time you two have a disagreement, just call me, okay?” he jokes. Steve wraps his arm around and pulls him close.
May has been offered a bed to stay the night, but she’s refused it. Staying with Peter while he sleeps, May explains that she’s perfectly comfortable like this.
“You know what? I don’t really want to know after all,” Peter interrupts him, nodding towards their main building. “C’mon, we’ll be late.”
“Feeling well,” Peter says in confidence. Wanda just smiles at him.
“Fellas, come on! Help me find something good that I can give Dad, okay?” Peter asks the bots. U rolls towards the fridge in a speed tempo, Butterfingers shaking its head up and down excitedly and Dum-E poking him in the side. Any outsider would think they’re severely malfunctioning.
Peter smiles at her. “I thought photography was my thing?” he asks.
Instead, he rolls onto his back so he can look at Tony with questioning brown eyes, face sad.
Peter startles a bit, probably mostly because Tony is actually there. He’s speechless.
“I’ll get you your coffee,” he tells him. “I know you’ll need it.”
Peter shrugs, turning around to walk back into the apartment. He doesn’t even bother to be quiet for Johnny’s sake – knowing him, he sleeps through an entire invasion.
“Forget the dishes,” Steve suddenly mutters, jumping up from the couch and, without warning, picking Tony up again. A small shout escapes the inventor, before he, again, starts swinging his legs.
, Peter thinks bitterly.
“Oh, how hard did you hit your head, kid?” Mr. Stark then stands up again, resting his hands on his hips. “We have to get you to the training center as soon as possible. See, this is what happens when you chase after danger…”
Of course, that would be the case if Rhodey’s leg-prosthesis didn’t decide to spark out at the last point. Hurrying back towards the lab to fix the problem, they’re already finding themselves two men short despite Happy and Pepper arriving earlier to help out as well.
“Are you going to tell them hello?” Gwen asks, and Peter hesitates for a bit. It could do great, to just have another talk with Ben, joke with him, learn some wise lessons from him. But… it would screw them up. They’ve built up some sort of peace, so it seems. They don’t seem happy, but they’re working back on it, they’re getting back on their feet, no matter how long it’ll take.
“Listen, dude, I need to go. I hope your ride gets here soon,” the girl continues. Peter shakes his head to clear his mind for a bit, nodding and handing the phone back.
“I miss you. I miss you so fucking much, and I feel like I’m going to fall apart, but I know it’s my own damn fault. So, just… I’m not begging you to come back. I just- I didn’t… kick you out. Listen, I’m not making sense, but… When you’re ready, just… come home, okay?”
“Save me the formality,” he says. Then he grabs Toomes’ hand and twists it painfully, not letting go. Toomes makes a painful sound, but he knows better than to scream. He already has a black eye from his beating earlier. He surely doesn’t want to cause too much of a scene. “We have some things to talk about.”
Eventually, he speaks up: “When I figure out what that means, I’ll come up with a
“Welcome back, Dad,” he says. Tony can’t speak, his throat hurts when he tries. So he just nods and blinks once. Then he turns to his left, where, much to his surprise, Steve is
“I’m not trying to kiss you!” Wade returns. “I want to know if you’ve seen Yaël! Drinking’s been lonely without her.”
“I’m okay. Almost ready to come back home. Will you be at the tower when I get back?” Tony doesn’t really want to wait any longer to see him; but first he has to finish this thing for Steve. Of course, he can’t tell him that over the phone; he’s got no clue who might be listening in.
Shit, it’s going to blow! Peter messed it up!
“If you please, I would be very grateful,” Steve adds. Tony rolls his eyes but lets out a small chuckle nonetheless. “Now, Peter’s headed to his apartment. Will you finally sleep?”
At one point during their lunch, Steve walks back in. He doesn’t ‘live’ in the compound anymore, staying at the tower more often than not. That means he’s being spared from all these childish discussions during the normally peaceful parts of the day.
he got knocked on the ground. Peter jumps out of the way, seeing a black-and-blue boot only just missing its target, that one being his face.
But then still,
Steve is fuming even more, the longer he speaks. He should be careful before he breaks the guy’s wrist without meaning to. He loosens his grip completely, almost throwing him away from him. Being near this man makes him feel sick.
“It’s weird to see Dr. Banner here again,” Vision admits. Peter doesn’t move, but he does nod.
- Talking about things
“You old lady!” Raido threw back with a roaring laugh. “Wait, you guys count in era’s?” Lopt interrupted them again.
Wait, wasn’t he supposed to stay in the tower? Peter blinks a few times, suddenly confused. Because of that, he misses his next cue and slams against the wall of the next building. Painfully, he lets out a groand.
“Is there a particular reason for this phone call?” Peter asks, taking a seat at a bench underneath a tree and taking out the few pages of his homework there. As he continues the call, he starts tapping his pen against the paper.
- Vaguely written sexual content
- Peter has some sudden dark thoughts that come and go just as quickly
“What the-?” he starts, noticing the picture on the front page. It doesn’t seem possible, but it’s very recognizable. He can see himself – or Spider-Man, rather. There’s a shim next to him on the picture, the face faded due to movement but the rest of her body clear enough to show who it is.
“I know, it sucks, but if there are some… unspoken feelings… we may need to just, you know, put it out there,” Yaël said carefully, hoping the kid wouldn’t spill out his romantic emotions.
The corners of Steve’s lips curl up, giving Tony a small smile. His eyes look at him fondly, his hand coming to rest on Tony’s against his cheek.
“But why would you leave this planet? The Grandmaster seems to favour you...  How did you even manage to do that?”
Yaël grabbed her phone after closing the door, trying not to fall. Firstly, she texted Peter to ask when they could meet. She doubted a while if she wanted to tell him what happened, but she’d be a real bad friend if she didn’t, right? After that, she searched for Steve’s number and dialed it.
“Wait, you have an Aunt?” he asks, curious. He thought that all of Tony’s remaining family was dead – except, of course, for Peter, that is. Tony, who is busy straightening his shirt, only nods. He puts his tablet down on the table.
“I think she knows my security is unbreachable,” Tony assures him.
“Why are you doing what you’re doing? Stealing stuff?”
Tony wakes up confused and groggy, and aching all over his body. There’s noise coming from outside of his room, and other little sounds that aren’t supposed to be there at the tower. When he pulls up his hand to rub his eyes, he feels some sort of resistance.
“Tony!”
“Hmm, my cousin kissed my man? That’s something to bring up during the next family dinner,” Tony mutters out. “He didn’t kiss her back, though, right?”
“I’m not behaving any differently than before, seriously, Dad! Don’t pull that crap on me!”
“There’s nothing to be ashamed of. Hell, I go to a psychiatrist too, there’s nothing wrong with that.”
Peter subdued him, nobody got hurt – except for him, maybe.
Steve groans, rubbing his nose against Tony’s while biting the man’s lower lip teasingly.
Peter notices the people coming back up from their dinner break. Some greet him, relieved from their small moment of free time. Peter just nods at them as he waits for everybody to step out of the elevator. When the last person comes out, Peter startles upon seeing her red hair.
Steve lets out a loud breath. “It’s always serious business, honey. When else are we ever going to get a good night’s sleep with all this?”
Tony shrugs. “It would have happened, I know it was reckless… I don’t know what came over me, okay? I was miserable.”
His assigned seat is between Tony and Susan Storm. They’re on the front row, but Tony’s not next to him, instead still in the front of the room talking to the King of Wakanda and Natasha. Peter stays in his seat, wanting nothing more but to take off the mask and be here as Peter Parker instead. But a promise is a promise.
He yawns, he’s just so tired.
To be fair, when he first came here, it had mostly been because he heard the Avengers had come here once or twice for special occasions. But even as they haven’t yet appeared, Miles wouldn’t care if they’d never come. This place has become something dearly to him, and he’s not even here that often.
“You brought along a kid as a shield?” Steve asks, not sounding impressed at all. Peter tries not to be too self-conscious when he stands there with his naked chest. This is a terrible idea; Peter knows that he’s muscular – quite much more than he would appear to be, since he’s almost always wearing clothes that are a tad bit too big for him to make him look smaller.
“See for yourself,” he says, coming to a halt in front of a door. Pointing his hand inside, Tony hesitantly follows in, hearing Johnny and Wade talk nervously. Is that- what’s that noise? Is that a baby crying?
“Some inspiration! It’s almost Christmas and May asked me if I have a present yet but I don’t have anything!” Peter almost shouts in frustration, shutting the first hatch and reaching for the second. “Why aren’t these alphabetical!”
“Here we go,” he mutters to himself, looking up and giving Steve an exaggerated smile. “Hi honey, how are you doing?”
,” is what Peter gets in return. “
The man who was also very good in tearing Steve into many pieces.
Yaël neglectfully waved with her hand. "Yeah, yeah, Rogers. Let me tell you something: why are you holding yourself back? As you noticed, I don't die that easily."
“Even so,” Tony suddenly starts without looking up, “Steve is stuck in Wakanda, and I am here. As long as we haven’t changed the accords, we won’t get a chance of being together.”
- Bruce is a good bro
“Who is this for?” he asks, repeating Peter’s question for earlier. Mr. Stark puts the marker in his mouth and starts pulling at Peter’s shoulders to turn him around. Then he starts drawing more lines on the back, keeping the top of the marker between his teeth.
“It’s nothing, really,” he lies. “He’s just been forgetting that we’re no longer together, and he keeps on calling and giving me pet-names. But I understand how that could happen, now. His brain is just… fried…”
The goons let out a simultaneous growl, and they rush towards Peter, fists raised in the air and anger clear enough to be read in their eyes through the masks. Meanwhile, the shop-keeper hides behind the counter and grabs for the phone above him.
what he did, too. Only he didn’t get caught.
This was the thing that she didn’t understand; sometimes she could do a few things using air and sometimes it didn’t work out at all. That part of her power wasn’t reliable at all. She kept staring at the brush angrily.
He arrives only right on time it seems. The moment he opens up the door, he finds Johnny standing right in front of the elevator, sporting his longish hair back wearing a black leather jacket. Something that looks rather expensive.
Okay if he’s trying not to appear nervous, he’s failing miserably at it. He quickly clears his throat again before grabbing his mask again.
They might have spit out their drinks on the screen, and the bowl of pop-corn might have been dropped on the ground. Nobody would have thought Steve to
“No, no, I’ll be fine,” he assures him. “I’ll see you two tomorrow, alright?”
And even if he didn’t, the screen with information he now has in front of him proves it even more. He makes sure to let Peter look along, but Tony doesn’t look at it in detail, only just checking the numbers to make sure. After that, he nods and pushes the screen away.
She coughed as soon as the smoke found its way into her nose.
Wade Wilson? Deadpool?”
And it’s true, Peter feels a constant urge to head out, to get away from these people. There’s something knocking behind his mind, trying to sink into his thoughts and prevent him from doing anything more. It’s really distracting, but Peter can’t give in. He keeps on fighting it, despite the headache it brings him.
After that, Johnny is out of the room. Sue gives Reed a stern look before hurrying after her brother. He might be the youngest of them all, but he’s the only one who seems to agree with her.
It’s nothing too important, just administrative papers for school for his request at doing an internship; his hours for school, his papers to arrange transport there, and whatever else. Peter figures he might have a look at that later.
The next time they spoke, was at Oscorp’s. Peter had just found some stuff in his dad’s journals, and found himself at the organization in search for more. He got himself in Dr. Connor’s radar, and Gwen, who was touring the group of interns, gave him a chance to stay as long as he kept her out of trouble. After she found him snooping around where he shouldn’t go, she
Now, to be honest, Tony can’t remember Otto that much. Sure, they went to the same school together, but let’s face it, Tony was never really sober most of the classes they’d shared. He remembers Otto saying something about clean energy, but that’s about it. He would have thought Otto would have let it go since Tony has Arc Reactor energy already taking care of that.
With the speed writing is going, I'm going to try to go for two updates a week. I hope I can keep it up! Anyway, here's the chapter that was somehow hell to write.
“I like your style,” Peter jokes, pointing towards the shirt. MJ looks down, smirking after that.
need to have yourself checked at.” Peter gets on his feet and starts searching through his closet. Then, he pulls out a couple of clothes and throws them on the bed. “Put these on, leave the suit here. And let me know what the doctors say.”
“Uh, yeah! Yeah!” Peter shouts, a little bit too loud, thus startling the girl a little bit. She eyes him like she’s about ready to just run off at any point. Carefully, she takes out her phone and hands it to Peter.
“So tell me, Peter. How has it been lately? It’s been a little while?”
What’s going on? Is it the Goblin again? Is he after Peter once more? He wouldn’t put it past Harry, but right now he really wishes it isn’t him. Harry is the last person he needs to see right now; he already knows his dreams will be filled with bad memories.
"Steve, honey, can you check on Butterfingers and see what he's doing back there?" Tony asks. That's when Peter notices the noises from further away in the workshop. At the small bar, he can see movement from what seems like one of the bots, but what he's doing, he can't tell.
Steve nods, suddenly pulling up his hand and holding it out as a fist towards Thor. The God looks down at it, smirking once again when he recognizes it. Then, without speaking, he taps his own fist against Steve’s before the two bump their sides against one another.
Wait, did Yaël also know people from other planets? Cool!
?! How...? Why…? And you’re just
The world around her was shaking, forcing her to open her eyes again. She didn’t even notice it was night already, or that there was a stray cat who rolled himself up against her waist. The only thing she saw, was her own face, staring back at her viciously.
Yay Harry! Or maybe not? Who knows?
He’s been so close to losing Peter, today. Heck, it hasn’t even been a week since he found it out, and he’s already almost lost Peter once. It’s safe to say that he’s feeling like a pretty crap father right now.
“So, uh, with Felicia. You think I could try and make a move? She’s hot, you know,’ Johnny jokes. Peter shrugs in return, not really caring either way if Johnny would try and get into Felicia’s pants, as long as it doesn’t become awkward afterwards.
“I don’t know, I suddenly got a call from your Dad’s assistant telling me that because of my ‘impeccable performance’ during my internship I was invited to meet the King of Wakanda,” she says with a wink. “I think your father likes me.”
- Of course, FRIDAY doesn't want Peter to enter the room. She cares for him and doesn't want to see him hurt. Sadly, it's a small flaw in her programming that causes for her to be unable to ignore a direct command from any Stark. If Peter tells her to open the door, she might try reasoning but eventually has to open the door. Clearly, soon enough Tony will find a flaw in this way of thinking and he'll make the necessary adjustments.
They let go of each other while they head in the hallway. The walls are blackened, the smell of ash all around them. Behind them, Harry is complaining about losing all the stuff he just bought for his departure tomorrow.
“Morning, Bruce!” Peter responds. Then he makes his way back to the breakfast table. They stay there for about fifteen more minutes before Peter hurries back into his room to get changed. With the hotel being close to the building they’re supposed to be, they all just go walking. Because of the weather Peter dresses for the occasion, pulling out a Spider-Man hoodie he once found in a shop in the streets and putting it on over his suit.
“So, uh… how have you been?”
“But… how can you do this to her?” Tony asks, then.
Holy, cow! She totally forgot about Bucky. It was a sacred secret between her, Barnes and Steve. Her cheeks turned red as she snorted. X raised an eyebrow and smiled.
“Come in!” Steve shouts, then. He throws an arm over Tony’s own shoulders. Then he gently kisses the top of his head.
“Lead her on like that?”
This time, his entrance doesn’t give the same reaction. He’s pretty much ignored by the dancing people. So Peter hurries to the improvised bar, nods once towards Flash who is by now too drunk to even notice him, and gets himself something to drink.
She pulled out the last piece of weeds, stood up and stretched her back.
“What are they doing now?” Harry asks.
“WHAT?!” Peter waved his hand, he shifted on his place. “Calm down, that’s what I’m trying to tell you… I went to visit him in his cell.” To make sure Yaël didn’t have the chance to yell again, he just kept talking. “I just needed to see him with my own two eyes, you know? They’re trying to find a cure for him, but I think they’re not trying hard enough!”
There’s nothing from the other side, but Steve knows Tony heard it.
“Peter, watch out!” Yaël still shouted. Somehow, Peter managed to pull Wade away from the steering wheel. As a reflex, Yaël tried to get to the oil of the car, trying to steer it, pull it from the car and use it to push the lady aside. While steering her powers, she felt the car brake roughly. Yaël looked up and saw Peter shooting webs out of the window, but she kept focusing of the old lady.
Steve sighs, opening his eyes at last. “Have you been drinking coffee before bed?”
“It was alright, the cuts itch a bit,” Peter says with a shrug. Harry doesn’t say anything, instead just heading to the coffee machine and filling himself a cup. Tony drops the carton on the table to hurry towards his son, immediately grabbing his arm.
Steve smiles fondly at him while Peter’s already pulling out his cellphone to send the girl a message. They don’t text each other, instead sending messages online. He wonders what weird gadget she’ll bring him this time!
When Wanda passes the key, there’s a confirming beep and then the lock is opened. She gets inside so quickly that Peter lets out a breath of surprise when he’s tugged along, apparently still holding her hand.
After that, she carefully opened the door and walked out of her bedroom. A shriek left her mouth as out of nowhere somebody wrapped his arms around her and forced her to face him. It was Charles, of course it was Charles. Well, his younger and illusive version. But he felt real enough, as Charles was a damn pro in casting illusions.
He’s felt close to cancel all meetings so far, but he would feel like that would be unfair to the students; there are about three of them that come for an internship at the logistics division, two for the engineering program, and then there’s one more interview for the scholarship itself, which is actually the second one that comes to ask for it one year in advance.
“I’m- uh,  I’m still-. I just…”
“What?!” Yaël’s voices echoed through the iron hallway. “Who put me in the board in the first place?!” she asked, trying her best to be a bit more quiet. What dumb piece of salmon would do that? The last thing Yaël wanted to do is interfere with important stuff.
“Yeah, me too,” MJ returns. Then she puts a hand on Peter’s cheek and leans forward, pressing her lips against his. As a complete mirror of earlier today, MJ’s kiss is soft and sweet instead of hard and insisting. Peter’s eyes close automatically, and his hand goes up to the back of her head. His fingers tangle in her messy curls. Gently, he’s pulling her closer to him.
“Selling weapons?”
“He will. I’ll make sure of that,” Tony says. And, true enough, in his head he’s already preparing everything he needs. It’s just a little folder, filled with all the files necessary to tell the other Tony a story. The story of how Tony fell in love. The story of how he’s never alone because of Steve. The story of how this Steve confesses everything to the wrong Tony.
“I will withhold sex if you don’t delete that footage right now,” Steve warns him. Peter scrunches his face together, though Harry watches it happen in fascination.
The part that he’s been postponing for the past few days.
“Sounds… amazing,” Tony breathes out, hurrying towards Peter’s side to see what he’s got so far. “I wouldn’t make this so long; it’ll throw it out of balance.” Tony points his finger at the neck of the bot that Peter created.
It was safe to say that Natasha threw a fit when she found out. Though, instead of lingering on it, she started working forward. And she introduced him to Trish, Jenna, Reilly, and Mary. And with each date it seemed to get worse. Trish was kind of a drama queen, Jenna ate with her mouth open, Reilly hated art, and Mary was already talking about having children before the first hour was over.
Peter’s heart skips a beat, his mind going over the idea of just telling him the truth. Francis is a cool dude, he’ll surely not spread around the word that Peter Parker is Tony Stark’s long lost son, right? But, there’s already too many people that know. Peter shouldn’t do it. He puts his hands in his pockets and clears his throat.
Tony startles, feeling his body freeze up. Wait, is Steve seriously going to talk about this again? Steve seems to have notices his sudden reaction. He pulls away a little bit allowing Tony to sit up again. The moment he faces him, his eyes can’t leave him.
“Don’t hesitate, just face it,” she tells him. At least it’s better advice than ‘It’ll be alright, things will be fine blablabla’. Peter nods at her thankfully while knocking on the door. After a short moment of silence, he hears her voice inviting him in. Peter takes a deep breath, and then silently counts to ten to calm his own nerves. After that, he gets inside.
A photograph of Tony and Pepper together, the Eiffel-tower standing behind them. Pepper was kissing Tony on the cheek, and Tony looked… happy.
, and that bad guys might try to hurt me to get to him?”
“You’re a kid,” Tony returns, finally looking up. He looks horrible, Peter notes. Though his skin looks healthier, there are dark circles around his eyes, probably from the lack of sleep. “The whole point of keeping you out of the accords is so you can stay a kid, hidden from the eyes of the government.”
“I said I like ponies.” Yaël took a step closer towards her sister and let go of the handle.
“He’s seventeen. He shouldn’t have lost all the people he already has,” Tony answers.
- Sad Tony
Peter smiles lightly before letting the first tear roll out of his eye. Tony panics; it wasn’t his intention to make the kid cry! He can’t comfort people, he’s horrible at it! Usually he just buys them presents and hopes that it distracts them from whatever happened.
“For having no powers at all.”
“Is there anything else I need to know to figure this out?” Peter asks. FRIDAY stays quiet, probably instructed by Mr. Stark not to help any further. Peter then just sighs and takes another look at the gauntlet.
“I can understand why they’re here, but I think it would have been better if they hadn’t been made. There’s so much shit going on now, and we can’t even help out…” That was true. Somewhere, Yaël did understand why Stark and the others signed the accords. Just like Vision said, it was the logical thing to do. “Wouldn’t you be a victim of them as well?” Wanda hinted to make clear that Yaël should tell Peter she was already affected by the accords.
“Thank you, granpa Steve and granpa Tony,” Annie says before pulling away and heading upstairs. Tony and Steve both chuckle.
“You know what?! I’m so done with your shit. We’re getting divorced!” Tony snaps, bursting through the door opening and storming into the hallway. He doesn’t even look at Bruce and Peter as he passes them by. Peter blinks a few times, surprised at what just happened.
“Really? Did you ever meet Tony Stark? He’s like my Uncle,” Sharon says, laughing a bit. Next to her, Steve looks just extremely uncomfortable.
Tony Stark’s voice says jokingly, and Peter once again rolls his eyes. Yeah, maybe one day he’d thought that having Iron Man as a father would be cool, but now he’s quickly come to realize that he’s not much different like other fathers – a huge dork, that is.
Tony hesitates for a bit, just a few seconds, before his mind tells him that, once upon a time, he could tell Mary anything. She would never judge him, no matter what it was. He figures things wouldn’t have changed that much.
“I broke through the door while I was opening it. It doesn’t hurt too much,” he admits. Tony still takes his arms and inspects the cuts closer. While Peter then expects for the other Avengers to come, there’s nobody. He frowns a bit, almost ready to ask when Tony starts talking instead.
“Ah, Miss Beauty! How are you?” And with that he’s gone. Peter blinks a few times, and Yaël gives him another apologetic glance.
Chapter warnings:
“The year is almost over,” Tony grunts back. “After that we’ll nominate Winterwidow over there.” Tony points at Natasha and Bucky, who are giving him a very unimpressed look.
No, said reaction won't be written out in this specific story. (reaction being: holy crap I hurt my boy in Leipzig)
Now, don’t get me wrong, I want you to see your friend again. I’d be a shame if we’d keep you separated, but I want to talk to Nick first. So that he has a chance to prepare Steve and the others, if he wants to.
He quickly waves at Daisy, who holds her thumb up towards him for good luck. After that, she disappears as the door closes behind him. Steve glares at him shortly before continuing through the hallway.
With his other hand, Tony rubs his scar. He’s been doing that too often, lately. At least the bruising from the shield is gone, but in the end, Tony will always feel it.
“I’ll take this one, then,” she says with a wink. “Now, let me make my ‘before’ picture before I have to go.”
Seeing Steve being so careful around his son is just doing things to Tony that he doesn’t really know how to express. It makes him want to forget the whole thing Natasha warned him about before Steve left, and just pretend that nothing is wrong.
Aunt May just looks at him sadly. Then she holds out her arms and pulls him into a hug. Her hand comes to the back of his head, and Peter’s cheek rests on her shoulder. In front of Agent Carter’s video about Steve, they stand there in a strong embrace.
“You know, you surprise me sometimes,” MJ suddenly says.
There have been a few occasions in which Peter has been wondering what exactly he did to derserve this. Sure, his Dad loves him, and so does Steve, and he now has a whole family of Avengers out there that cares about him. But as it is, he can't help but wonder once or twice why he couldn't have just been normal?
Then he stops, eyes meeting Sharon’s, who is trying to act like the name doesn’t bother her. Tony hasn’t heard from the kissing experience on her side, but then again, she wouldn’t exactly go to
Peter looks down, feeling heavy all the sudden. Then he sighs, lowering his hand and taking a step back from the door. Steve’s right; he’s behaving like a child again.
“I can’t promise you that, son,” Tony admits. “I’m going to try and see what I can do, though.”
Bucky, Sam and Clint are sitting a bit to the side. Not because they’ve been excluded from the others, but more because they’ve excluded themselves instead. As it turns out, they’ve found some sort of creature that came along from space, and now they’re trying to make it do tricks. Steve can’t help but roll his eyes when he sees it. They are, and will always be children. Bucky’s clothes are mostly black with a little bit of silver. Sam’s are black, white and red. Clint’s have his usual purple, along with a bit of black and grey.
The moment Tony kneels down to pull out on of the boxes he feels a wet nose against his arm, followed by a small tongue licking his skin. Tony looks sideways to find the little brown Labrador Retriever breathing heavily at his side, tail waggling happily.
“But, you know, it’s a good thing. I mean, the more guards that are down already, the quicker all the slaves, I mean, “gladiators”, can be released,” Korg didn’t even sound a tad bit nervous, the freaking optimist. Yaël rolled her eyes. He finally found the right buttons, apparently, because he pushed a few.
“Looks like we’ll be carrying our men,” she says. Tony rolls his eyes but can’t help but agree. Sure, Steve might be much taller and more muscular than Tony, but he’s no longer that heavy for him. Tony can lift easily enough as long as he doesn’t struggle.
“P-Peter?” Felicia asks, her voice hoarse. She grunts painfully while trying to turn her head. Once her eyes meet Peter’s, she holds up a hand and puts it on his cheek. “You’re back.”
“Uh, I’ve almost taken over earth and I’ve fought in the arena and partly lead the rebellion on Sakaar, those are the only two things I can think of that could somehow make me notorious,” Yaël shrugged.
I would first of all like to thank Caspinn! I'm sorry I've been bugging you with ever little suggestion about this story. She's not a Steve/Tony shipper, and the fact that she agreed to collaborate on this story with me, to allow this story to be a part of hers, means so much to me. As it is, I'm sorry I put you through all this fluff and mushy stuff, but I'm sure you've survived given that we're still spending New Year at my place ;-)
“Peter, watch out!” Yaël suddenly shouts, pointing towards something on the road. When Peter looks up, he realizes too late that there’s an old lady crossing the road. The only way of avoiding her is to crash the car, meaning that they could end up wounded. Peter really doesn’t want to end up at the interview all bloody.
“Welcome home,” the dude with the dreadlocks said. “I saw you coming.” His eyes flew to Yaël, like he even expected her to be there. She raised her eyebrows in surprise.
In his annoyance Tony turns to his side, looking at Steve’s peaceful face. Asleep, it’s hard to see how troubled the man must be. And still they haven’t talked this evening. Tony gave him the distraction he needed, but after that he was just too tired to do any form of discussion. So instead Tony called up Peter, forced Steve to speak up a little, too, and after that call Steve went to sleep.
Yaël couldn’t see the woman anymore as the turned and screeched by Peter using his webs to try to stop the vehicle. Something flew of the roof, probably that Wolverine-thing and that was exactly when Yaël had the feeling they started flying…in a bad way.
Yaël didn’t feel like she knew Wanda already good enough to spill her problems to her, so she wasn’t going to call her either.
“He’s stronger than I am,” Tony counters. There’s another shifting noise, and then Peter feels himself being lifted up from the couch, once again taken into Steve’s strong arms. Tony’s hand in his hair disappears as he’s being maneuvered away from the couch.
His freaking
“You can join us, I don’t mind,” Peter says with a shrug, because it’s true. He doesn’t mind at all. “B-but please, don’t try to pretend like there’s nothing going on, because it’s driving me crazy. I’m not going to cry if you two want to smooch it up a little bit.”
“Hey, May,” Peter greets his aunt. He doesn’t need to see her to know it’s her. He knows her strokes to his head, knows the feel of her hands, her breathing. He’s been raised by her, he could recognize her even if he would have been deaf and blind at the same time.
And Tony can see immediately when Steve feels the same heartbreak Tony’s feeling right now.
A few desks away from him, Flash – with now a very black eye – is throwing spit-balls at Peter’s head. So far, Peter hasn’t reacted to it. He knows that if he would open his mouth, it could be used against him. It’s probably better to just ignore it and wait for detention to be done with.
“How have I been, Rogers? Horrible! That’s how I’ve been. You happy now? What did you expect? That I would just… get over this so quickly?”
asked for him, which can only mean one thing.
. His hands are thrown up, held there by Steve’s strong fingers. The super soldier is kissing his way down on Tony’s chest, paying most of his attention on the scar on his chest.
“In case you’ve forgotten, you’re still under watch. I don’t want to be the first son that has to remind his own father that he’s supposed to be nice to the babysitter.”
“Because I know my brother,” she says. The secret is that she only just received a text from him, saying ‘be there in ten’. Reed doesn’t need to know that, of course. The fact that they got the eighteen-year-old to agree to be here at all is enough of a wonder as it is. Sue sighs a bit, wondering what could possibly be
one and only Iron Man,” Wade’s voice suddenly says from behind them. The two turn around in a quick surprise, though Yaël seems to jump a bit more than Peter does. To be honest, in his time as Spider-Man, Peter has quite grown used to the guy popping in during the most random moments.
“I don’t have any other clothes,” he says, and Tony’s heart breaks at the hurt in his voice. He doesn’t like this. Not one bit! Peter’s a good kid, so what if he’s been making a few mistakes lately? He’s a teenager! That’s what they do, for crying out loud.
Bruce shrugs. “Maybe Jane? Selvig? Maybe if I send it to Betty she might-“
. The lack of retort seems to surprise even Steve, who waits for anything to come out of Tony’s mouth.
“Can I at least know your name?” she asked while jumped on one leg as she tried to tie the laces of her shoe. The woman turned around very quickly and elegantly, her hair swung with her movement, and smiled, it was actually the first time Yaël saw her smile, though there was an obvious underlying emotion underneath it, as if she’s sad about something, perhaps?
“That’s not what you thought when you asked me to take on Steve,” Peter throws at him, but regrets it immediately. He can see the change in stance on the suit almost instantly. Tony doesn’t respond immediately, leaning forward a bit while his free hand goes to his chest. Peter knows what that means; he’s rubbing his scar again.
“I’m not a dog!” she yelled at him angrily.
‘Oh, jeez, Charles. Are you going to follow me on my adventure the entire time?’
Steve just nods. “I’m always happy to help,” he says. Loki gives him an intense look at that before nodding.
Peter compares everything he sees on the pieces of paper with whatever he finds in the gauntlet. Every little screw – not that there are many – or cable inside, he searches through it all to find anything that might indicate that there’s something wrong. But even with the limited knowledge he has on electrical engineering, Peter quickly comes to find that there’s nothing wrong with it, really.
“We can add a picture of you and Dum-E, then. His name is very obviously written on his base,” Tony says calmly. “Now what should I say? That you do a
,” Zemo continues, suddenly lighting up a control room he’s hiding inside of. Out of reflex, Steve throws his shield towards him, but it bounces off the wall and comes back to him without having caused any damage. “
“Harry?” Peter asks. The figure on the ground shudders a bit upon hearing his voice. Peter takes a careful step forward. He tries again. “Harry, it’s me; Peter.”
Peter hears Cap say.
On the other hand, the Infinity War won't be a complete part of this story! So whatever (horrible?) things we have planned, you won't read them here, but more in the second part of the series (aka Yael's story) if you want to read it still when the time comes.
“Steve flew all the way from Wakanda to donate his liver to him. Sadly, somebody called the cops on him and now he’s in jail until they’ve finalized the accords.”
Still no answer. Tony’s not feeling like saying anything, anyway. There’s footsteps in the background, slowly nearing the bed.
“You could have woken me,” Yaël mutters into her cup. After taking a large gulp, she turns back to Peter. “You have your interview, no?”
“Ah, Stark, always fun talking with ya,” Wolverine says, though his tone doesn’t sound like he finds it ‘fun’ indeed. Then, without a warning, he jumps out of the window to get back to Deadpool, but when Peter casts one third look, it seems like the guy has disappeared. How did he do that?
Not that Peter expected her to be angry about this, anyway.
“That’s not all that bothers you, is it?” she asks, because she’s all knowing – something she shares with Aunty Peggy.
“When your friend almost died for what feels like the hundredth time, one would feel compelled to hug said friend, no?” she says with a light smirk on her face. Tony blinks once before telling his body to pull back the suit. It doesn’t hurt as the nanites sink back into Tony’s bones. That’s a good thing; if it had hurt all the time the way it did when injecting it, Tony would surely have it all removed on the same fucking day.
“What?! No way, you look way to fancy and fabulous to be a prostitute!”
“We’ve never been good at talking, have we?” he states. Tony can’t help but agree with that.
Tony takes the CT-picture to have a good look at it. Meanwhile, the nurse starts pulling away the bandage to clean his wound, only to snort when she sees the state of it.
He doesn’t feel anything of the removal of the stitches, and before he knows it he can turn around again. Once he’s on his back, he sees how Dr. Cho works. It’s interesting, how quickly she can work on it. With a small knife, she cuts the strings open on one side, and with a pincer she pulls them out on the other. It doesn’t hurt, only tickles a bit.
“And we’re glad you are,” Peter says. Tony hums in agreement, simply resting his head on Steve’s shoulder with his eyes closed. This is probably the happiest Peter has ever seen Tony. It’s a good sight.
Feeling a sudden vibration in his pocket, Peter snatches out his phone from his pants. On the cracked screen, a picture of Happy shows up – one Tony once took for him. With sudden panic, he realizes he’s being called. In the meantime, Liz is asking another question.
Somewhere next to her, a door opened. Yaël didn’t look up, she kept on attacking and defending herself on the same time, which felt kind of weird and extremely exhausting, but she was curious to see how far she’d be able to push this.
Well, with that info, she couldn’t get a real job anywhere. Someone also wrote down she had asthma, but somehow, Yaël doubted that. There was something weird going on with her voice, she was sure about that. It sounded hoarse, like she was sick, had a cold.
“Can I get a quick selfie before you head back there?” she asks. The crowd laughs, and Tony, too, can’t help but chuckle. As she points the camera at them, Tony turns to look at Steve, who looks back at him as well. Then, right when she takes the shot, the two give each other another quick peck on the lips.
“That creep is here again,” he mutters while he takes the money from the customers. He greets them quickly and then puts the money in his pockets to bring it to the front.
Peter throws the sunglasses on his bed and reaches out for Tony, giving him a short, reassuring hug. He doesn’t expect Tony to just grab on to him and not letting go. Peter chuckles hesitantly, gently patting his father on the back.
“How you’re feeling right now? Knowing that your friend is currently killing you? That’s how
Tony knows that he’s in the medical department of the Facility, and he remembers well enough why.
Peter clears his throat.
Sadly, the little soundtrack that he put up for himself is already pulled away when he’s suddenly pushed against the lockers by an annoyed Flash Thompson, who doesn’t look like he’s taking well at being ignored like that.
When Tony passes them, he puts his hand through Peter’s hair and kisses him on the head.
“Anthony Edward Stark!” Steve calls out, giving Tony some shivers. He’s never used his full name before, it actually sounds weird coming from his mouth.
“Because everyone thought you were ‘damaged’-“
“Miss, can you remove those walls please?” a way too familiar voice asked her. Apparently, Yaël had built a little stone cage around them in a reflex. With just a knock of her hand against the stones, the walls crumbled down.
Their arrival at the park brought both Peter and Aunt May speechless as they walked through the gate. Thanks to Tony’s probably very expensive VIP-passes, they get in almost immediately without any trouble. They’re handed a map of the entire place, and the only thing Tony tells them is that they can chose where they want to go first.
week is all I asked for, but do I get it? Nooooo!”
Wade sighed dramatically “For the love of God, are you always that picky? Besides, I won’t get older than this. I just have to wait a few years until he is an adult and…wait is he trying to escape?”
“Yes, sir! Thank you sir!” And with that, Peter hangs up, closing his locker again and starting to run towards his biology class.
!” The Goblin sneers before throwing Peter away, literally. He feels himself fly in the air at an alarming speed, but it’s not long before the flying turns into falling. With trouble, he reaches up his arm to shoot out some webs towards a building that’s nearing, but in his horror he realizes that they don’t work. The Goblin must have broken them!
“And here we have this wonderfully incompetent bot messing everything up as per usual.”
“Thanks, Dad,” Peter returns. He clears his throat, looking down at his feet. There, he notices the first snowflake starting to fall down. The breath in front of him forms its usual cloud, and his lips curl up in a light smile. “You know I’m not angry at you, right?”
“Deadpool?!” He groaned. “Out of all people that have to stalk me, it has to be the one who would be able to send me to an early grave.” Oh, so that was his problem.
“Sorry, man, Tony and I never really hung out so I don’t know him,” he returns. Clint, too, shakes his head.
Natasha, Rhodey and Steve talk him through it. The others just call Steve.
idea:
It’s a heavy pounding in Peter’s head. He has no idea what is happening, other than wanting to empty his entire stomach on the floor.
Peter stands still, hand on the cold metal that opens the door, but not pulling it down yet. He waits.
Ross gives them the time to decide after that, telling them he’ll be back tomorrow to get their definite answer. The Four remain the moment he’s out of the room. Sue sighs, shaking her head while shoving the book away.
“Okay.”
Maybe he should tell him now, no?
When she looked to her side, she saw Loki’s face turn even more pale than it already was. An odd duo, Yaël and Loki were. Err, no, they weren’t a duo. He was just going to bring her back to earth if they both survived this and then he’d probably leave again immediately.
“Yes! A thousand times yes, Mr. Stark!” He almost cries out. Then he realizes he’s being a bit too loud here, and he pulls back a little bit. “I mean, I would love to assist you in building it.”
The thing he can make from Dr. Palmer’s explanation is this; Tony caught the Hepatitis Virus somewhere in the past few weeks. It took until a few days ago to really show symptoms of it but normally it would have gotten better on its own. With the fact that Tony’s liver was already weakened due to the excessive alcohol-drinking in his past, along with the sudden intake of alcohol two days ago, his liver just couldn’t hold up anymore and decided to shut down. Which is why he’s jaundice now. Dr. Palmer even explains that it’s a good thing the encephalopathy starts up so soon after the jaundice, since that means there’s a better survival rate.
“Peter?” Tony asks, still unable to believe that it’s been almost two weeks since he last really talked to his boy. “How are you feeling, boy?”
“Is it temporary?” he asks. Dr. Cho shakes her head, hands still holding Tony’s chart.
“I’ll be like; ‘hey, man, I only came here to get to know my father, but the moment I arrive here, he’s not even there,’ and he’ll be like ‘huuh?’ and that’s how he’ll figure it out.”
The moment Peter leaves the penthouse, the two find themselves back in their bed despite the urgent need to prepare themselves. Steve on his back, with his hands on Tony’s cheeks while pressing their foreheads together, Tony leaning on his elbows as he moves and breathes out heavily. It goes on, and on, and on. And when they thumble over the edge, Tony rolls over and drops down on his back. They’re both completely out of breath and sticky in all the wrong places.
“Huh, even your nose-hair is blond. Who would have guessed?” Tony muttered out, and Steve’s hand automatically goes up to shield his nose away from Tony’s observing eyes.
- Tony having slight flashbacks to the Infinity War (will escalate a bit in the next chapter)
“Seriously, can’t you two just stop drinking your problems away? I’m getting into an early grave because of the two of you!” Pepper rubs her forehead while she looks down at her cellphone.
Yaël walked back into her bedroom, figuring Peter would be wearing clothes by now. But she just walked into her friend staring at the shirt he was holding in his hands, like he was too confused to understand how and why he should put it on. A bell rang in Yaël’s head: maybe the boy had been taking his pills and mixed those with booze… Which made him react like this. Another bell rang: she had forgotten to take her sleeping-pills last night…
“Peter,” Mr. Stark calmly says in between. Peter doesn’t hear it.
“I, uh… I don’t,” he mutters. He scratches his hair, noticing his phone ringing back in his room. That must be Aunt May. She did say she was going to call in the evening…
Or he could tell Aunt May that he’s staying over at the compound for a few nights to spend with his friends. That could be believable?
mission, but also who fired the most shots. Winning team is excluded from doing the dishes in the following week. The ultimate loser has to do the laundry for the entire month."
“Yeah I did, but you didn’t seem to do much effort in getting me back here, did you?”
“Dads, I’m- I’m sorry, okay?” Peter starts, walking up to the bed taking place on the chair that had previously been occupied by Bucky. “I just- I got angry and I behaved like a brat, and I shouldn’t have, I know that.”
“What’s his name?” Barnes asks. It’s Steve who answers.
Peter shakes his head, starting his run and then shooting two webs to catapult himself up in the air. In a speed-tempo, he climbs up on the tower. He always hates doing that because it’s such a long climb, but with all these construction-things on it he can use his webs to sling himself upward a bit faster. By the time he’s on the balcony, he runs to the door.
They’re having lunch when Peter sees her. He’s at the table with Ned, discussing the new Star Wars movie they did eventually watch a few weeks back when suddenly a third person joins their table. It’s the moment Peter sees the fiery red hair that he groans.
“Can I come in?” Steve asks in a whisper. Tony looks down at Peter, and then nods.
Tony keeps his mouth shut again. He doesn’t really know how to respond to that. He knows Bruce has a point, but it still just… he doesn’t know.
“Can I help you?” the woman asked with a smile that automatically made Yaël smile back.
Peter needs some distraction. He decides to go to the movies, watch something that seems fun enough. When he finds, much to his surprise, that there’s an autobiographical movie about Tony Stark, he doesn’t hesitate.
, as in plural. Because unlike Odin and Frigga had in Asgard, as it turns out, Thor would rather have Jane by his side at all times that she wishes so. She will become his queen and will be equally as important to the kingdom as he is.
Meanwhile, Dr. Connors was put in a tight corner, and ended up experimenting on himself. Peter was pulled away into action when the guy caused havoc on the bridge, turned into a lizard. Of course, Peter didn’t know it was Dr. Connors at the time. He couldn’t even catch him since he was trying to pull up a car that still had a kid inside.
“No way!” Peter mutters out. Because that’s MJ, hanging high above between two towers with nothing to defend herself with. Freaking MJ?! Anger boils up inside of Peter, and he’s just about ready to punch somebody in the face.
Hurriedly he mutters his address to the driver, turning his head back to check if his dad is still following. Luckily, the car drives off the moment Tony rounds around the corner, looking angry and scared at the same time. Peter lets out a long breath, actually surprised that he noticed him leaving already. He thought it would have taken at least a few hours or something like that.
“Holy shit, what an asshole!” Peter shouts out, uncaring if FRIDAY might hear it from inside. Mr. Stark can know, for all he cares! Peter just needed a breath, a bit of fresh air to clear his mind. All he gets is
“Heh,” Peter chuckles out in embarrassment. “So is this a thing you do? You constantly read minds of everybody who walks around this building?”
There’s nowhere he can go, nothing he can do. He puts his hands in his hair, eyes locked onto the sky. It’s getting dark already, seconds ticking by, precious time being wasted. And Tony’s here, unable to help out his son because he’s a couple years too late.
“Well, hurry up, I think there’s a security guard heading this way.”
But he shouldn’t bring that up now, right?
Eventually, Tony comes shuffling into the room. He’s wearing an old bathrobe, his feet stuffed into slippers Peter recognizes as Steve’s (since Tony doesn’t wear that). His face looks pale, and his eyes seem tired. To be honest, he looks horrible.
“Well, uh, we should probably get a cab now, then. Who knows how crowded the roads will be?” Peter suggests. Yaël nods and heads towards her own bag, fishing out her wallet and checking if she still has cash. Peter quickly notices there aren’t many cards in there.
“Go!” And without another word, the blonde guy who had visited her in a few dreams, ran off again.
Of course the kid was nervous! That was, again, so human of him. Peter was going to meet his dad again, who still didn’t know he had a son. Well, if Yaël really wanted to shake Peter up some more, she could tell him he was standing to what could be his stepdad someday. But Yaël didn’t want to give Peter an attack, nor did she want Steve to have a nervous breakdown. Jesus, what a weird situation.
“What are we going to do next?”
“Hey, wait a minute!” Yaël pulled her arm back out of Cho’s hands.
People start shouting when the girls come up on the stage. Tony has enough time to take off the pants and the hoodie, pulling up the hood of his own uniform before jumping out from behind the screen on his cue.
"So, you'd rather be frozen again?" She was distracting him, as much as she could distract this utterly concentrated super soldier. He saw her tap with her foot, but he was too late. She made a quick pulling-gesture with her hand and before he could turn around, Steve got knocked down by a big piece of the brick wall from behind him, flying against his back.
Of course he was! She was a complete failure, a being that shouldn’t exist. Or maybe he was laughing. Laughing because he made her think they were equals. They’re clearly not. Maybe he had been laughing all this time for her naivety and dumbness. Yes, of course.
“Absolutely not,” he says. “You know I don’t want you to have anything to do with these accords.”
“I don’t know, how are you?” Tony returns playfully. “Oh, and by the way, I brought some upgrades along.”
Tony frowns, pulling the phone away from his ear for a small second before putting it back in place. Midtown High? That’s Peter’s school… What has the kid been up to, now?
He needs to go on patrol to clear his head some more. And after that, he should try and catch up with his dad, maybe even apologize. No, surely apologize. Peter passes a hand through his messy hair before turning around.
Being excused from any form of physical education, Peter is seated on the sidelines doing some more homework he missed while his classmates are busy throwing balls at each other’s heads. Flash, of course, seems to be giving it his everything and shows no mercy at all, so it’s no surprise that Ned quickly comes to take place next to him.
“As if! You haven’t been right since after what happened at the war!” Rhodey returns. “Have you even told Peter yet?”
Peter presses his lips together. He never really heard Natasha talk about her past. The only one really knowing about it being Bucky, who was there, and Tony who got to read her files but never shared what he actually read out of respect for her.
He doesn’t give Tony a warning, instead throwing an arm over his side and pulling him closer, pressing his back against Steve’s chest. Then, with his hand resting above Tony’s heart and his nose almost pressing against his hair, Steve seems determined to go to sleep.
“I haven’t been asked out
What if that guy is actually his father?
Peter wonders why he isn’t just going home. He doesn’t know those people, and even finds himself disliking this Wade-person that has been stalking him at work for months before now. Sure, Yaël seems friendly enough, and Peter’s sure that she might one day be a great hero, but it takes only a short conversation with her to know that she’s a bit gloomy.
“You dress up nicely,” Natasha says the moment Tony walks into the living quarters. Sam, Rhodey and Wanda are seated on the couch, looking at the television. Clint and Vision are playing some pool, while Nat is seated at the bar, enjoying some sort of cocktail she must have brewed herself.
Tony isn’t too sure what exactly Steve has planned with Deadpool. In a few days, they’re heading out for a week, following some sort of lead on whatever. Tony didn’t listen to it too much, instead having his thoughts more on the fact that his son is coming home this evening.
Mary stays quiet, but Tony is all too aware of her eyes on him. She’s studying him, probably trying to get to know him again. It’s been a while since they’ve hung out for her as well.
“Ah, you know, learning that the first woman you’ve ever loved died years ago without you ever knowing might sting a bit,” Tony says dryly. He just wants to get up and get a drink, but clearly that won’t be possible with the last bottle lying on the ground. At least his subconscious helped him stay away from the booze again.
a voice in the back said. It sounded like Bruce.
Once he can see again, he’s startled so much he actually starts crawling backwards until his back hits the wall. In front of him stands the Goblin, hovering on his board and looking at Peter with intense eyes. His face looks normal, though, less murderous. He’s got the pointy ear-pieces, but the suit looks different in a way.
“And I suspect he refused because he’s a very responsible young man,” Tony states. The two boys chuckle again nervously.
The voices are blurred in his ears and he can’t really place who is talking and who isn’t. The loud noises make it clear to him that there’s still fighting going on around him, but he’s aware that there are two people crouching over him.
“If, uh… If I give you the code to bypass them, will you do it?” Peter asks. He’s just being polite here, because even if Ned will refuse, Peter can just do it himself. Ned holds up his hands in surrender.
“It’s ohso quiet, tudududuu, tudududuuu…It’s oh, so still…” Yaël sang to herself just to see her breath in the cold air. How long was she standing here? She was feeling a bit sad. Why couldn’t she just enjoy an evening without getting herself into trouble? She felt like, like…like she needed a permanent babysit or something, but she was an adult, right? It wasn’t her problem that those guys were stupid idiots filled with testosterone!
“We are going to dig some more into your memory. Don’t you want to know how you used to live on this planet?”
“Dad, I don’t- “
“I’ve got your back!” she yelled at Loki above the noise of ice scraping into metal breastplates. Loki nodded, not losing sight of the enemy’s army surrounding them.
He let the plaid go and turned to her, standing with his both hands behind his back.  Every move he made, was gracious, like he was royal or something.
“C’mon bro, if you’re not going to do anything about her, then I will,” he assures him. Bruce sighs but doesn’t comment further on it. So instead, Tony pulls up whatever they’ve found on the alien matter and the two of them start their research.
Everybody seems happy. There’s smiles and laughs. But Peter knows it’s not completely true. Not yet, at least. So Peter hurries to the bar, orders two non-alcoholic drinks, and brings them to Tony, who looks at him with a confused look.
! My kid. MY BOY! And you have the ability to go back and make sure that he won’t have his neck snapped by that purple bastard out there.”
The sex had just been because it had been a while. A long while. And Steve missed Tony, and he needed this.
Gwen looks at him sadly, but nods. “I guess we should,” she says. She leans forward and captures his lips once again, shortly. “I’m glad I got to see you again, even if it was just for such a short time.”
“You sure do,” the nurse answered dryly.
, a voice inside his head says. Peter bites his lips closely together to keep his mouth shut.
Once he’s back on the roof of the building he sees that there’s no sign left of the girl.
“Oh hell no,” Peter mutters, trying to scramble upright, but stumbling against a hard, unmoving body. Turning around, he finds none other than Steve standing there, grinning down at him, holding the gun in his hand.
“Oh.” It was a bit quiet after that while everybody tried to forget about that last bit.
He stares, can’t seem to do anything else. Because Harry’s still laughing, and it’s slowly turning into a whole other sort of laugh. Green fills Peter’s vision. The smell of smoke comes up in his nose. What’s happening?
The moment he bursts through the door, he shoots out a web to pull the gun out of the guy’s hands, only to realize a bit too late that, simultaneously, the four other goons point their own weapons at Peter out of reflex.
“You don’t, you’re just going to have this relaxing walk with me,” he answered without giving her a choice.
“What do you mean?” Wade added some milk.
“Are you smirking?!” Steve still talks a bit louder than normally, probably still excited about it. Tony raises an eyebrow, finishing his glass before dropping it down. Then he makes a complete turn, heading back to the living room.
,” Steve quickly says.
They see him as a human being, who is capable of having fun just like everybody else.
So all she could do was lay down and stare at the ceiling and think about how she had proved once more she wasn’t hero-material, back there in the arena.  Peter surely wouldn’t have been proud of her...
Thanks for all the kind comments ^^ I'm here to break your hearts a little more, I'm sorry :'(
He wouldn’t have expected the turnout.
“You’ll figure something out, I give you total freedom,” X snickered.
"You and your jokes about my hair...would you rather have that I plant the image of the senior, bald me on this bench?"
“Alright, I’m headed to the toilet, just wait here or use the dummy, okay?”
“Mr. Stark, is everything alright?” Peter asks, pulling him out of his thoughts.
A few students passed, Yaël recognized Dust, who was always wearing a black burqa, because that girl followed her art classes. The teens looked with big eyes to the scene in front of them: Captain America carrying a teacher on his back like she’s a little child. As soon as Steve noticed their judging faces, his cheeks burned red and he let go of Yaël.
“Possible disorientation, weakness and fatigue,” he starts without looking up. After that, his dark eyes meet Tony’s. “Possible hair loss. Bloody vomit and stools, and hypotension.”
Peter noticed Yaël’s thoughts had drifted off, so he decided to let go of the subject and her be wherever she was in her head.
“Oh, come on!” she let out, throwing her arms in the air. She was surprised to see the man immediately storming towards her and before she could regain herself, the man already jumped onto her, punching her right in the face, already pointing his sword towards her neck. This was so not going well! She put her hand on his shoulder, just to check his body warmth, and then grinned widely.
“I dunno, a week or two ago. I got a bit busy with school,” Peter explains. “Besides that I was mostly hanging out with Felicia…”
And seeing as it's Thursday right now, here's the third chapter!
“Peter, Tony, are you alright?” Steve asks, a bit breathless. The two are still breathing heavily. Tony gives Steve a quick look, once again noticing the dark red spots on his shirt. Immediately he reaches out for him, opening the buttons of his shirt and looking over the wounds on his chest.
Peter decides not to look at everything, still wanting to give Harry some sort of privacy. He puts the files away, stands up and stretches his arms. When something pokes him in the side, Peter can see U holding the cellphone and motioning Peter with it.
As it turns out, the Wakandans are there already. Peter is quickly greeted by Shuri, who gives him a sad look and another promise that she’ll figure this out. When she suggests to Tony and May that it would help bringing Peter to Wakanda, neither of them seems to hesitate on it. Peter doesn’t listen as they try to work something out.
“How’s he doing?” Tony asks.
“You just never know,” Tony points out, holding out the utensil towards Steve. “Can I remove spiderwebs with this?”
Wait, what?
“What did I miss?” he asks. Tony shakes his head.
Tony doesn’t make any move to stand up. Instead he takes his notebook and starts scribbling something down.
“What happened?” she asked a bit shaky from the running.
Tony shakes his head. “Water’s good,” he assures her.
Peter’s senses are tingling almost non-stop. Just when he’s lost Steve behind him, Vision randomly appears from through the wall, pointing his own gun towards Peter, who shrieks and only barely manages to avoid it.
Why was he fighting with Tony again? Because he was caught sneaking out at night and supposedly lying about it? Maybe he should just have talked to Tony instead of shouting at him immediately.
“I’m already on it. Trying to track him down for a bit, see if he has any patterns he follows. So far, my deduction is that he still goes to school.” Tony’s finger goes up, poking Steve on his chin. Steve slaps his hand away, but Tony just started to snort and poked him even more. “You know, you would look pretty hot with a beard.”
Hope laughs before patting Scott on the shoulder. “It’s alright, dear. Just go to sleep. I’ll see you in a bit.”
Well, if it fails, they at least still have Bruce’s bowl with whatever he brought along.
“Actually, he is not,” Loki counters. Next to him, Yaël nods with a guilty expression.
6 missed calls? Holy crap. Running back to the bathroom, Peter goes through the call-log, seeing that Steve has been trying to reach him all the time. But he frowns when he sees that, at eight p.m., somebody answered.
“Yeah, uh, the, uh… the voice let me in?” Ned asks, with eyes open wide, taking in Peter standing there with his suit still on.
As Peter gets back to his desk, he quickly puts in the wireless ear-pieces he got from Mr. Stark, which would allow him to take on calls while keeping his hands free. Right now, he keeps it in to be in a direct line with FRIDAY as he sits back at his desk. The others are currently at the cafeteria, scrambling together some dinner. Peter would join them, but he’s forgotten to bring money along.
Tony can see on Peter’s face that there’s something bothering him when he gets out of his bedroom. He figures it’s probably that sudden Avengers-meeting in the elevator that surely caught him off guard. And for what reason, even? They all just simultaneously decided to come up and watch some TV together? Do they need group-activities
He didn’t know if it was the medication or the sessions, but after a while, things didn’t seem so dark anymore. Sure, sometimes he started spacing out once or twice, but he managed to pick up his life more or less after a while, and wore the suit once again. By the time December was finished, though, he learned that the only way for him to succeed in his school-year was to start an internship to earn extra points.
bit of space things are probably going to get green again.”
Peter doesn’t stay around to hear his reaction. With one quick shot, he’s already back in the air, on his way once more through the streets, in search of anything to do.
“I cannot explain everything in just five minutes!” Thor calls out, suddenly panicking again. His large hands reach up into his hair, and he starts pacing the room nervously. Steve watches him for a few seconds before clearing his throat.
They keep on talking around Peter, but the teenager doesn’t really listen anymore. The words sound faded around him after a while. His head hurts too much to focus on it. After a while, Dr. Cho arrives with a few nurses and a gurney. They put Peter on top of it, and then roll him away towards her office. Peter isn’t really sure about what happens after that. He must have lost consciousness after all, since he suddenly wakes up in a dark room with only the sound of what must be a heart-monitor that fills his ears.
Neither of them says anything. This is going to be a bit harder than last time, there’s probably too many years past since Siberia.
“Uh, apparently, so,” Peter huffs out. “But the problem is that Mr. Stark doesn’t know. And I don’t know how to bring it up with him without trying to sound like the kid that wants to pull a gigantic practical joke to become rich?”
, is what his brain is telling him. “What does that mean?” he asks.
By the time they get there, a couple of the Avengers are already there. The Guardians are already out, talking to the others. There’s Gamora and Nebula, in conversation with Natasha and Hilde. Then there’s Quill with Tony and Steve. Rocket is once again trying to convince Bucky to hand over his arm – without much success, though. Draxx, Mantis and Groot are mostly just standing there awkwardly, unknowing of who to talk to. That is, until Groot notices Yaël and Raido and creates a flower to give to them. Yaël smiles at the walking tree, getting a smile in return.
Steve seems disappointed in the loss of contact, and so is Tony, but an agreement is an agreement. Instead, Tony puts his right hand on the wheel, and rests his left elbow in the open window.
As it turns out, Wade and Johnny Storm aren’t the best combination. In an attempt to prove who is the biggest lightweight, the two end up drunk off their asses and causing destruction almost everywhere they go. Jean Grey is sitting at the bar a little further away, using her telekinetic powers to clean up their messes. Sue tries desperately to pull her brother away from his drinking partner.
Great.
“Where’s your head at?” she asks. Peter sighs.
It’s not just a quick press on the lips. Suddenly feeling a strong hunger inside of him, Peter deepens the kiss, not wanting to let go just yet. MJ doesn’t seem to complain. Her hands are on his chest slowly sliding up until they’re resting on the back of his neck. After a few more seconds of just heavily breathing against each other and their mouths pressed together, MJ is the one to pull back
“Hey, uh, I’m going to take this real quick, okay?” Peter asks. Barely looking at Peter, Liz nods.
“And Stark?” If Yaël’s previous question had already been a bad one, this one seemed to be even worse.
“So, you and MJ still going strong?” Johnny asks curiously, if not a bit awkwardly. Peter shrugs.
; Peter recognizes him from one of the pictures Aunt May showed him when the guy appeared in the newspaper for one of his miraculous saves. He doesn’t pay any further attention on Peter as he walks towards the hospital. Huh, Peter hadn’t even noticed he was here already.
“Ah, right… uh, I’m not sure, I think Thor had something to do with it? We haven’t really seen him since then so it’s kind of unclear.”
“So I’m like, an alien?”
“Oh no, that sounds dangerous,” Tony interrupts. Steve throws him a glare, but then continues.
food to have a good date.
Also, a few people seemed excited about a Johnny-Peter friendship. And while that wasn't really my intention (mostly because I wasn't really aware of their friendship in the comics), I've decided to change the parts with Johnny I had written out. While at first he was around 10 years older than Peter, now he's eighteen years old, and only got his powers because he sneaked into the space craft when Sue, Reed & Ben were on their mission (because, honestly, who would take a 16-year-old up to space??). The original story-line (being the one where they'll surprise everyone by revealing he's in a serious relationship with Sharon -- see, because Chris Evans ;-) ;-) ) is with this not relevant anymore ^^ The future chapters have been changed, and timestamps will give us friendship goals!
Thor shakes his head. “Naye, I feel extremely well. I’ve washed myself, my clothes are ready at my separate dorms from Jane. I must say, it’s been a lonely night without her.”
He doesn’t speak up, and that seems to be enough for Natasha to make her conclusion.
“Looks alright to me,” Mr. Stark then says, sounding full of disbelief. “CAAAAAAP!”
promise to her father; to keep her out of everything. He had tried, but not enough. He gave in to temptation, made her part of his life.
“Uh, yeah,” Tony gets out then, scratching his hair. “You should get washed, you’re filthy.”
“He stopped breathing,” somebody behind him suddenly says. When Tony turns around he finds one of the nurses standing there. “Strange intubated him since he’s not breathing on his own. We’re now waiting for him to start up again on his own.”
“When, Tony?!” she urges on, raising her voice. Tony bites his lips together and looks down.
Suddenly, Peter is no longer standing in front of them, instead running around them. When he starts walking up the walls, both Tony and Steve tilt their heads to the side.
But who else is there? Sure, there’s
Yaël looked up after hearing the clouds rumble. Something didn’t feel right. The sky suddenly looked and felt very sinister. It was time for Yaël to move, but right when she wanted to stand up and leave, some sort of green and black spot formed right behind the two brothers. It grew bigger and bigger, it almost looked fluid, like oil, as it licked the air while growing without blending in. Thor and Loki seemed to immediately grasp what was happening, because, with just one tap against the ground with his umbrella Thor changed from a normal-clothed guy to a god in full armour. Loki, too, changed from his extremely flattering, no, scratch that, that man didn’t have the right to be called handsome, suit to his typical clothing. The green-blackish cloud-thing must’ve been some sort of portal, Yaël noticed, as a woman stepped out of it. Well, if you’d call that a woman, she surely looked more like some sort of witch.
After that, Tony walks around the table to get to his seat next to Peter. There’s one more empty seat next to Tony, reserved for Bruce. Just when Peter is about to ask where he is, Bruce comes up from behind him.
“He’s going to Siberia to find the other Winter Soldiers,” Wilson says. Tony shivers, remembering how Steve vaguely mentioned something about more of them back in Leipzig. But they were a bit too pre-occupied to talk it out, of course.
“Uh, yeah, no, that guy might be a dick sometimes but he’s a friend,” Peter returns, pointing behind him to the hurt body of Dr. Strange, who is trying to get himself back on his feet. “And we don’t really take kindly to people hurting our friends.”
MJ was right, and they finish about ten minutes after Peter joined in helping. After that, MJ fills up a bowl for themselves, handing one to Peter with a playful smirk.
“James? You mean Barnes?” Tony asks, but when he turns around again, Natasha is already a good distance away. Watching her go, Tony is reminded once more of how broken their little team is. He rubs his painful wrist, remembering FRIDAY warning him about the contusions he got in the fight. Somehow, the wrist hurts the most.
The staff at the hotel don’t seem to understand what’s going on. With the sudden addition of probably all the known superheroes in the world, some of the members try and get pictures with their idols while the others try their best at cleaning the more troublesome’s messes.
"OKAY GUYS I SUGGEST WE HANG OUT AT YAEL'S WHAT DO YOU THINK?" Peter almost shouts out, literally pulling his friends out of the couch in an attempt to get away from these losers as quickly as he can.
“Goodnight, son,” Steve whispers addressing him the same way Steve addresses Spider-Man. Peter keeps himself from smiling as Steve pulls away, only for Tony to take his place. Another kiss is planted on his forehead.
, and the first thing you think of asking me is how me and my wife got together?!”
Peter leans back in his chair, his mouth fallen open in confusion.
The Goblin… as it turns out, Falcon and War Machine failed to catch the guy, meaning that he’s still wandering around somewhere, doing who knows what! It’s no wonder Peter’s feeling so paranoid right now, since Harry – err, the Goblin – seems to have taken a special interest in getting Peter out of the picture.
“Aaaah! Why are all the hot ones always taken?” she asks in frustration. Steve just finds himself glaring at Tony.
Right, he should go. He suits up again, flying away from the school to where he remembers Mary’s home to be. In his mind he prepares a quick message for Steve, to assure him that he’s found something. Just so that they know he’s on this.
“Right,” Peter get out, deciding to just continue his journey. He throws himself off the building, hurrying towards the park.
She’s fast, and agile. When she notices Peter following her, she blows him a kiss and gives him a wink. Then she continues on without turning back, even as Peter slowly catches up to her.
These are the people that you once knew here on Earth.
“Because he’s just a rich bastard. Besides, the suit can just be remade, no matter who is flying it. See War Machine, practically the same, just a better hero inside,” she explains. And Peter then stands up angrily, causing his chair to scrape over the floor and make a painful sound that could make ears bleed.
Steve has a beard. It doesn’t look bad, at all.
“Damn it, where’s Johnny?” Peter wonders. After yesterday, he arrived home and told Johnny he wouldn’t be joining him to the party. And Johnny had been disappointed a bit, but told him that he understood why. But, when in the morning Peter came to get Johnny, he wasn’t in bed.
“Just going to do some light protesting on animal cruelty. You should join me when you’re finished here?” she tries. Peter laughs, remembering the last time she took him protesting. He ended up with a black eye after a drunk dude accidentally mistook him for somebody else. His dad had been furious and got so close to suing the guy’s ass!
“Hmmmm?”
Yes there will be a timestamp where, finally, we will get other POV's, in which we can further explore Steve's thoughts on Peter being Spidey
need some friends.
He was aware that Natasha and Clint had started up a bet. He didn’t mind too much, even though it was about him. Of course, they would bet on something like this. After all, wasn’t Steve considered as the ninety-year-old virgin?
“Oh?” Yaël took another sip.
“Oh, shit I didn’t mean-“ he starts, trying to struggle back, but Tony shakes his head. He takes a step backwards, a sudden numb look appearing in his expression. Peter swallows nervously, knowing he screwed up
“Something wrong?” Peter dares to ask. He knows there’s a lot of things wrong with his dad, but there are a few occasions where he figures there’s something
“Well, most of these kids live here. They train and study whole days, but I don’t want them to get sick of school, there has to be a fun, more relaxing subject for them to enjoy.”
-  Tony and Peter have a talk
Sam, too, averts his eyes. Clint, ever so faithful, endures it.
Suddenly she felt a hand softly resting against her back. When she wanted to turn around, she almost bumped into the friggin’ model. His hair was lose this time and fell in waves over his shoulders. He had grown a beard and, of course, it suited him well. It made Yaël almost think of some of the Helvegian guys… if she could just braid his hair here and there and-
Otherwise, things are alright again as much as they can be. After they defeated Venom, it appeared that Tony woke back up from being knocked out and, with a few simple mathematical calculations, he managed to form a plan to get himself, Rhodey and Steve out of the collapsed building. Harry’s back in New York, staying here and starting up an education that will help him earn back his company for good. Johnny’s back in the apartment. Everything sounds just about right.
Tony turns around, his bottle dropping on the floor before he even gets to open it. In his confusion, Dum-E rolls up his way and picks it back up, poking Tony in the side with it.
So Peter walks outside. There’s a little backyard, especially put down just in case there’s good weather and they could eat outside. It’s empty there, nobody having found the place yet. It’s fine. Peter walks up to a tree on the farther side of the garden, leaning against it and looking up at the sky. He smiles spontaneously, fishing out his cellphone out of his pocket to check the time.
Hey, better me than somebody else, I suppose. But he shouldn’t have brought up Gwen! Because I know she’s dead because of me; she was there when she shouldn’t have been. She only followed
“Why do you have the suit?!” he bites at Peter, but then he sees Peter’s face again as if for the first time. Eyes red from the tears, Peter stands there, bruised and broken, begging Tony for an answer. He wants to know where Steve is, he’s begging here, and all Tony can do is snap at him. All he can do is being a horrible father; again.
He feels horrible in all ways. Being connected to FRIDAY like this, to the actual entire tower, Tony feels violated in many ways. There’s an intruder in the thing that feels like another part of his body. It’s unwanted, it’s probably causing lots of damage. And, as far as Tony knows, the girl still hasn’t found her way out. He’s making sure of that.
“Back in May, you remember when Earth got invaded again, right?” he asks. Peter nods, sitting up a bit in bed to look at his father a little better. “Shit, I wanted Steve to be here for this but… this shouldn’t wait any longer.”
FRIDAY says, and Tony rolls his eyes at her sarcastic tone. She’s much like JARVIS when it comes to that.
“Do you have plans tomorrow?” Tony asks then, keeping his voice low so he wouldn’t wake up the kid in the back seat. Steve smiles and nods.
“Rogers,” comes out. The smile that was building up on Steve’s face disappears again.
“Well,” she answered with a full mouth “It should be, usually, it looks more like food.” Yaël shrugged
“Eh, I was wondering if Mr. Stark was around?” Peter asks, figuring he might as well
Steve suddenly points at Peter, not keeping his eyes away from Tony, who by now has retracted the helmet again. With his comm link in his hand, he throws it towards Strange. Peter catches it quickly, handing it to the sorcerer.
Tony pulls his hand away immediately, as if touching her burned him. He clears his throat before dropping his gaze. What- how- how did she know? Tony never told her? He’s pretty sure Peter hasn’t been meeting up with her in secret!
“Yes, I really need to-“
The kid nods eagerly, though not before trying to hide away a yawn.
So Ton finally moves. Everybody stays quiet, holding on to the toast as they all seem to realize it might not be over so soon. Impatiently, they wait for Tony to reach the door. Even Peter starts shuffling on his feet, a bit nervous. Harry snorts, next to him, finding his fidgeting amusing.
, Peter thinks to himself. Sure, he’s aware that his Aunt looks great, but he really doesn’t need anything to happen between her and his father next to him.
“Uh, thanks?” she returns, uncertainly. Then she blinks a few times more and jumps up from her seat. She grabs her plate, drops her bottle again and accidentally kicks her bag from the chair to the ground. “I- uh, I need to… go… now.”
“You know as much as I do that I’m not a great example,” she said as she moved a pawn. X quickly shook his head as she was moving the pawn the wrong way, so she corrected herself. “Besides, what could I possibly teach these kids? I’m not even a mutant, let alone human.”
He could have been sitting there for an hour; he wouldn’t be able to tell it. He doesn’t notice the call that comes through. His mind clears a little bit when suddenly something cold is pressed against his face.
Then he send her a selfie, making a peace-sign with a freakishly small hand. In the background there was only sand and rocks, like he had said. Yaël typed an answer.
“Peter, are you ready to start?” LL asks afterwards. Somewhere in the back, they can hear Peter’s uncertain stutter.
“You’re much chipper than before,” Harry points out. Peter snorts.
Tony is aware of Peter’s friends asking him where he is. He’s missing his classes – Tony already explained something to the school. It’s possible for Peter to still succeed the semester, but he’s going to have to work hard after missing all those classes. But that’s a worry for later. He gives Johnny a little update on him. He’s sure Johnny will explain it to Peter’s other friends.
“Maybe,” he says in return. He shuffles forward for a bit until their faces are close together once again. “I just want the love of my life to tell me what he’s planning.”
, Peter thinks to himself. Quickly, he throws himself off the roof, swinging his way to his own apartment building with a tension in his body that he hasn’t really felt before. Feeling as if his cheeks are permanently colored red, he goes on until he arrives at the window in his bedroom. Easily, he opens it and sneaks inside when he sees there’s nobody in there. Shrugging out of the suit, Peter grabs for some clothes he randomly finds lying around and puts them on without bothering to see if they match.
“We need to talk,” she answered.
Realization comes to him, and Peter hurries to the window, where he pulls open the blinds. The view he sees there is not disappointing at all.
“The Guardians told us they’ll come back to the tower by the end of the week. The others are fine, but worried.”
“The Queen has her sources, she found the one who used you to attack this town in the first place.” “Who the f- Thanos? Loki?”
“For crying out loud, Strange, lift the spell or he’s going to keep up this tantrum!” the other man finally shouts at him. Strange gives him an annoyed look, but eventually
is and why it’s not on the periodic table?”
“I couldn’t save Peter. When the time came to it, I wasn’t good enough.”
Peter hums.
“Eh, hi professor.”
“Sure, I mean, we have our arguments but what couple hasn’t, right?” Steve winks towards James and Natasha. Natasha gives him a vague smile, and James simply chuckles guiltily. Steve doesn’t seem to pay too much attention to it.
another part says.
But it’s the slowly shrinking man they’re all looking at that deserves the most attention. While the skin is slowly turning from green to its usual tanned color, Peter realizes all too well who this man is. It’s been years since he last saw him, but it’s undeniably him.
“But you don’t have to drink! Just be my wingman, okay? I saw this pretty girl on campus back when I went to get my schedule, and I overheard her saying to her best friend that she’ll be there. I would be
People laugh. Instead of saying anything, Tony just stands up. He leaves the microphone on his chair and starts moving forward. Once he nears Peter, he reaches his hands out. Peter recognizes the gesture, running into Tony’s arms and the two holding each other in a strong embrace. The crowd once again makes a cooing sound as they see them, and it becomes even louder and filled with screams when Steve, too, joins the hug. Chrissy, once again, takes out her phone to take a quick picture of it.
“Ah, come on! After all that fun we’ve had in the past few weeks?”
Tony then seemed to take that as his cue to sit down on the chair Sam had been in earlier. “If your answer to my question won’t be ‘I feel like crap’ then you’re lying,” he muttered out. Steve just snorted again.
“Neither do I. Just pretend you’re good at it,” she tells him. Before they know it, Felicia and Johnny are on the floor as well, quickly followed by Shuri who doesn’t need a partner to show off her moves. Eventually, it becomes less on dancing with their ‘date’ but more on dancing with the group. Peter’s aware that the adults are looking at them from the sidelines, but he ignores it. He dances with everybody at one point – even Johnny. Nobody asks any questions when suddenly a sixth person joins their group, that one being a quite drunk Wade Wilson.
Tony thought he would have been light on his feet so soon after the injection of the Bleeding Edge. As a matter of fact, he’s never felt better, stronger. It’s something he wouldn’t have thought possible, due to the small amount of Super Soldier Serum inside of him, but here we are. He noticed it when he accidentally broke the sink that morning. Again. Besides, his head is in constant over-drive, but unlike with the Serum, this time it’s something he can work a lot better with. It’s not his senses that are amplified, nor his reflexes. It’s his head literally being connected with his systems at all times. Just a step further from the Iron Man HUD or the headset he used to contact the suit.
“It helps that we might have saved the judge’s daughter during the Alien Invasion back in 2012,” he says. Then he takes one of the empty glasses and the bottle of champagne Maria brought along. “Hmm, Champagne. This looks good, man.”
Harry already knows, and that already brings enough danger with it.
“Yes, sir,” he then says, figuring he should at least try to talk a little. He notices Mr. Stark look straight at him, seeming worried. When Peter tries to look away, he suddenly notices something on the man’s right hand.
The rest of the dinner isn’t awkward at all. They get to know Felicia a lot better, and when it’s time for her to go home Peter walks her out. May and Rhodey also offer to give her a lift, which she accepts gratefully.
“You really need to stop doing that,” he complains. Steve ignores him, instead carrying him back into the bedroom and dropping him down on the bed. Then, Steve drops down next to him with a small grunt, eyes never leaving Tony’s.
“Is this a good idea?” he whispers towards him. Tony shrugs.
“What’s wrong, Peter?” aunt May asks, opening his door and raising her eyebrows when she finds him sitting on the bed.
Yaël sometimes missed someone like that, or someone like a big brother, like when she had troubles with the drains, or when she didn’t know what to read or what to play on her cello. Yeah, it must be great to have someone to fall back to.
“I have a feeling that your body is trying to block something out. It has something to do with that dream,” he told her once he looked back in her eyes.
Both Steve and Tony take a step back. Neither mentions Peter using the words ‘dads’ to address them.
Steve laughs, making them turn before pressing Tony close to him once again. “I would love you in any form I could get you.”
By the time his Royal visitors and traitor best friend have left, Tony lets out a long breath. That fake smile that has been plastered on his face the entire evening finally disappears. He loosens his shoulders, rubs his neck and looks down at the floor.
Seeing Cap, completely filthy from dirt where his mask hasn’t been, Tony finds his breath catching. He doesn’t know why his impulses brought him here. Hadn’t he just told himself days earlier that he wouldn’t think too much into whatever is happening between him and Steve? How is it that, now he’s right here again, those ideas have flown out the window without a single warning?
Tony answers. Peter starts packing in his stuff.
“Oh, my, someone’s a bit sensitive,” then comes out, and Peter lets out another breath before he tries again, once more failing. “C’mon, aren’t you happy to see an old friend?”
“Don’t
Time goes by. After many days of testing, they’ve finally deemed Peter ready to return home. They spend the holidays at the tower, much the same way they did last year. It’s fun, light, and amazing to get back in touch with all the other Carters Peter hasn’t kept in touch with due to everything happening.
and whatever else. Remember the fish-pill disaster?”
For three days after meeting with Peter, she felt comfortably numb. Probably because she told him everything, she talked about, but Yaël didn’t really overthink it, she didn’t really care. When Charles said anything about it, Yaël just waved it away. She really thought she was okay now, not feeling a thing, that must be the phase before going back to happy, right?
“So, uh, is there a lot of damage?” Ned asks nervously. Vision slowly hovers around the room, taking a good look at everything. Yaël and Wanda put Wade down against the wall, giving him the time to heal himself up. Tony stays in the suit, putting his hands on his hips and inspecting the damage.
Mary seems to hesitate for a moment longer before she hands him back the phone and shakes her head.
“Our contact wavered a bit after that. She spent less and less time at work, and eventually she resigned her job, leaving to go to Oscorp instead to work with him. The last time I saw her, we parted our ways after a stupid fight.”
“I just want to know how you figured it out?” Peter asks in confusion one he found his voice again. This had not been his plan at all; he should have just delivered the pizza and get out of there. It’s already past ten and he wants nothing more than to get back home and go to sleep. It’s already going to be a difficult weekend for him; he’s not sure if he can really handle this, too.
So, wanting the distraction more than ever, Tony pulls Steve’s shirt up while still guiding him towards the bed. Steve doesn’t complain at all. Not the entire night they spend together, bodies close and lips locked on each other almost constantly.
“I’m fine! So before you say anything else, tell me which planet we’re on,” she knew she sounded a bit arrogant, but she didn’t want to wait and risk waking up again.
“No, I was only dropping off my backpack. I’m going swinging for a little moment,” he says, pointing his thumb towards the city underneath them. Bruce nods, giving him a light smile. When he holds out his hand, Peter gives him the bag, quickly taking out his badge to make sure he’ll get inside.
Yeah, well, she asked herself that too. Why had she been standing there like that? "My thoughts drifted away..."
Charles frowned. “Well, I’ve been thinking about that a lot and… I think you shouldn’t tell anyone,” he whispered as to make sure nobody heard him, while nobody could actually see nor hear his appearance.
- Infidelity? I don't really think it could be considered that, but I'll just tag it so anyway.
He falls asleep before Steve even arrives. Meanwhile, downstairs, Peter Parker suddenly opens his eyes, suddenly finding himself cramped up in a way-too-small outfit
“Yeah, well, I was missing my man. Heard some news about him getting into a lip lock with my cousin? Needed to know from the original source, though,” Tony tries. He can see Steve’s cheeks redden at the mention of that, and even Barnes snorts from behind them, though keeping the gun up. “Hey, Manchurian candidate, you’re killing me. There’s a truce here, you can drop- it’s just typical banter between the two of us!”
“Everything alright, sir?” Peter tries, anyway. Cap turns to look at him, lowering his hand and sighing once more. Then he nods with a smile Peter knows isn’t all that genuine.
“Visiting hours are over, he’s not here,” the nurse says. Tony nods, letting out a breath. Surely, Steve will be there tomorrow. “You should go to sleep. You look tired.”
“We were worried! Strange was about to lose his grip on the portal before you came through! What took you so long?” Peter asks curiously. Tony pulls back at last, getting Steve’s help to get back on his feet.
“How are you holding up, Tony?” Steve asks quietly, respecting the distance between them. Tony just shrugs.
“You forget you’re tired and malnourished, dear sister,” Yaël said with an emotionless face. Nilla screamed, making a cry that almost sounded unnatural, and tried again to attack Yaël. But Yaël kept calm and blocked every blow that came her way.
“Thank you, Sam,” he had said. After that, Natasha arrived, and the action started instantly.
There’s another grunt before the head looks up.
Steve and Tony jump apart, the latter dropping down on the ground until he’s hidden behind the bed. Steve grabs the sheets, putting it around him in an attempt to hide himself away.
Tony frowns. “You’re not old enough to drink!” he calls out after them, but they’re already on their way out. He sighs slightly, turning back towards Peter who is already changing into his other clothes.
“Urgh, shut up,” Tony groans, walking towards the door before stopping himself. Then he hurries back to his desk, grabbing the small, long box, and brings it with him as he exits the room. Natasha watches him as he disappears, but she doesn’t say anything more.
Using his webs to bind their hands together, the men find themselves unable to get free. With loud and breathy gasps, Peter then lets go of five more webs, aiming them at their feet to pull them along. As they glide across the floor, Peter opens the door back up and makes sure to install his signature web-trap for the police to find. After making sure that they won’t be able to escape, Peter hurries back inside.
Tony finds Steve again after a while. The super soldier is slashing his shield in everything, letting out shouts of anger while his longer hair swings wildly into the air. But even Tony can see that, while he’s giving it his all right now, he’s close to exhaustion as well. It’s going on for too long, but they aren’t getting any closer to winning. With every passing second, more of their comrades fall.
Natasha nods, not lowering her head.
old monitor on the desk, his heart aching at the ancient technology this entire wagon uses, limited by the technology of their time. The screen is lid up, and there’s one single message popping up on the screen.
“After all this time? I’m on earth for a whole wile now! By the way, what kind of big plans and why does she need me for that, she has a psycho version of me already.” Yaël received another smack, way harder than the last one this time.
Limping and bleeding, the three of them make their way back to the car where they drive away without saying another word. That evening, when they’re watching the news feed about it, they learn that Otto has been found alive, but in a coma. As for the metal arms, Tony hopes that they’ll just get rid of it, afraid of what they could do in the wrong hands.
“Richard Parker isn’t Peter’s blood relative. So it wouldn’t have worked,” Steve deduces. Tony nods.
It is not limited to Steve when it comes to the fear of Tony doing stupid things. All the Avengers are alert the entire time they’re with him, listening to what he’s doing and how he’s reacting to things. Whenever things seem to be going a little less okay, they react.
There’s a fight. It’s messy. Tony can’t really say what’s happening because everything is moving too fast. With red anger flashing in his vision, he seemingly sees everything happening at once. First, there’s Steve trying to pull him away from Barnes. Then he’s warning Barnes to get out, and Tony misses only barely. Barnes tries to escape, Tony chases after him.
Tony shakes his head. He has no idea where his eyes are. Somebody squeezes his hand.
“Tony…”
“Oh, gosh, was that half-frozen guard there all along? Weird I hadn’t noticed him...”
It’s only a thin pink line now; healed much faster than it should have. It doesn’t hurt at all anymore, unless applied large pressure on it, which he doesn’t plan on having. He traces it a few times with his fingers, doing the same thing with the scar on his back which looks the exact same way.
much, and I don’t know how to do this without you.”
A small smile comes up on his lips. That’s a win!
“I wouldn’t know, I kept bumping up against everybody, and accidentally almost ran over a few kids so they moved me to a private room,” Yaël replied. Brunnhildeshared a room with her though, which was lucky because it was a huge assignment for Yaël to undress and get in her bed. So sometimes, without Yaël asking for it as she was a bit ashamed she needed help for something she was used to doing on her own perfectly, Hilde busted her fighting with her clothes or wheelchair and helped her out.
“Nah, I can’t risk him telling my dad. Bruce hates keeping secrets.”
“How about tonight you stay over, because somebody still needs to watch me – though can’t we stop that? Haven’t I been doing pretty good, lately? – anyway, tomorrow morning, you’ll be gone and I’ll spend time with Peter while you do your Avengers-business, and Monday evening, I’ll pick you up at seven and take you out for dinner?”
They stay there for about two hours, until Tony decides he better gets Peter home before May is going to report him as kidnapped by his own father. They hug Peggy in a goodbye, Tony gives her a kiss on the cheek, and then they’re on their way back to New York.
“You know, how about that’s not any of your business, okay?” she snaps before putting her hand against her lips. “Oh my God, I didn’t mean to snap! It’s just… personal.”
“Clint took her…” he mumbled, without looking up.
After ambushing Sam, who has been creeping his way through the hallways, Peter gets a gun of his own. With the compound darkened, and all the rooms evacuated, it’s easy to imagine like he’s in the middle of a video game. Peter can’t even remember ever having this much fun, especially when he gets to shoot something straight in Clint’s face.
“Run along, then!” Natasha calls out after him. Peter waves at her before running back inside. Then he starts a slow jog, nodding at all the people he sees inside. There’s Dr. Selvig – who still doesn’t really seem to know who Peter is, and sometimes just mistakes him for another intern (which he actually kind of is…) – and Jane Foster, followed by Darcy and that guy called Ian. Peter hasn’t really spoken a lot to them in the past, but he’s sure that, if he would ever get the chance, they might end up in an endless discussion about science.
“I see.”
“I’ll make it up to you,” he then says. “I’m still working on that new suit. How about you help me out with it? That way it’ll get finished sooner, and you can give it your input as well.”
“I would have to sign up for the interview, then. Have another talk with Mr. Stark to get the job…I wonder what Wanda would say about this?” Yaël nodded.
Life goes back to normal as much as possible. Sure, there are still arguments between Steve and Tony, but they’re smaller than they used to be, often talked through the very same day they occur. Tony doesn’t kick Steve out again, and Steve eventually becomes a legal owner of the tower as well. Meanwhile, May finishes the paperwork for the move. By the beginning of March, their old place is sold and everything’s moved back to the new house. It’s close to the tower, and close to Peter’s apartment, so it’s rather nice. Unofficially, Rhodey’s also kind of moved in with her. It’s good that she’s not alone, Peter figures.
But seeing things she didn’t understand? Call him? What did he mean by that?
“But there are some things I do want to say!” Peter counters, losing control of his voice, which is getting louder all of the sudden. “And don’t tell me it’s all in the past, because it’s not! It wasn’t cool what I said, and for everything in the world I wish that I hadn’t said it!”
was there as well, after all.
“I’ve always been an ass, Rogers. I thought you knew that by now?”
Standing somewhere close to the door, Peter and Harry look at the crowded penthouse. Sixteen people inside and they’re still expecting Dr. Cho, Maria Hill and Sharon. To think that Tony even invited Jane, Darcy and Erik… it might be for the best that they decided to do something small. As it turns out, Jane took Thor leaving not too well.
The woman stands still, almost unmoving. Then, with an unimpressed look, she turns back around.
I wanted to share this one already, because the issue will be often brought up in the second part of the story. I'm sorry if it's a bit... short, and maybe sudden.
“Uh, Pizza-pan?” he tries, not sure if that’s even a thing.
“I know, it’s just… Nobody really knows a lot about Spider-Man, and this Cat-person just really came out of nowhere and…” Peter scratches his hair, trying to ignore that weird feeling going through him at the idea of him together with the Cat. Shit, he doesn’t even know her damn name, while she’s been calling him Bee for the past few days.
It’s only when he gets close enough that he realizes Harry hadn’t been shivering.
Which he does, only to have his mouth fallen open.
“I hated it. No matter who it was I was sleeping with. Even with James, I hated it more often than not.” Natasha looks up at the sky, though not walking away from the window. Peter notices her red hair, put up in a messy bun that would make every prima ballerina cringe. “There were a very few occasions where I got to enjoy it a bit more. Not often, just… rarely.”
“Why is my coco getting warmer with every sip I take?” Wade sounded confused and poked around in his cup with a spoon, like the spoon was going to present him the answer. Oops, well, luckily she had been unwittingly warming chocolate milk instead of warming Wanda or Wade themselves.
“Was that alright?” Thor asks, smile bright on his face. Steve smiles in return, hiding away every bit of doubt.
“My, looks like the call is serious,” she says, frowning a bit. “Say, don’t you think he was a bit… strange yesterday? I mean, he seemed… quiet? I wonder if he’s doing alright?”
Because if you run one internship at Stark Industries, you know everything about the man. Peter just shakes his head all the time, claiming that he isn’t working there anymore and that he doesn’t know. Some people seem to accept it, others… aren’t.
“Rogers,” he returns the greeting. Another flash of hurt comes up on Steve’s face. Tony ignores it. “Is there something you wanted to say?”
“I’m pulling the plug!” Peter then says, jumping down only to have one of Otto’s robotic arms smack him across the room to stop him. With a loud noise, Peter lands against the wall in a clearly painful way. When he doesn’t get up immediately, Tony’s heart stops for a second.
“Hello?” he asks casually, shooting a few more webs to make sure the guys stays stuck. No human being is strong enough to break out of this – at least he hopes so. With a small bow he picks up the suitcase the guy has been carrying along.
“I was, uh, I found it in your office. Tony left it here. I was going to check up on Harry and-“ he stops talking. His heart is beating like crazy, because he’s
“Even so, you can’t leave,” Rhodey clarifies. Tony just snorts and angrily leans back on the bed. He doesn’t like being bedridden. He would rather just sweat it out in the workshop, maybe spend a few nights working there and exhausting himself to sleep. He can’t sleep, not without Steve next to him. It’s too cold, to lonely.
“Heimdall?” Thor asks, but the Asgardian next to him shakes his head.
“Spidey!” Wanda shouts in search for him. When Peter turns his head, he catches a glimpse of the guy.
“So, what’s your name?” Mr. Rogers asks. Peter opens up his mouth to answer, but then another coughing fit takes control of him.
But, when Peter is hugged so tightly that he would think he’d never be freed again, the only thing that crosses his mind is that
And he’s right. Twenty minutes after that, there’s a knock on the door. Tony storms up, opens it, and before he can get out a greeting Steve’s lips are once again pressed against his. Tony closes his eyes, shuts the door with his foot without moving another inch of his body, and just revels in the kiss.
“I’m breaking up with you, Steve,” Tony finally says. It takes a lot of effort, and Tony hates himself in every possible aspect, but he said it. It’s done. They’re done. He should go now, leave Steve for good. It’s for the best, after all.
Much to his surprise, two hands suddenly touch on his face. The arm around Peter’s neck is gone, and Johnny moves his head away so Peter has to look up again. Seeing Johnny in front of him all of the sudden, his eyes widen in surprise.
“So, uh… how did you and Sharon ever get married?”
“Ned! The guy with the wings is Liz’ dad!” Peter tells him quickly. Ned needs the short update if Peter wants his help.
I got my information from here: https://www.wattpad.com/459697933-all-about-asexuality-different-kinds-of-asexuals
“Tony, you’re awake,” Steve says.
“Even if May
“Or is this about this shit you guys are refusing to tell me about? I mean, I would love to hear about it when you two decide to stop acting like children and treat me like an adult, you know.”
Ned stays quiet for a bit. Peter is just about ready putting some scrapes of the suit into a few test tubes. Then he turns to the mask, turning it inside out and checking for any trace of technology in there. Much like he suspected, there’s nothing inside.
“I’m not that sure… I actually cheated on her… and sure, I wasn’t all too aware of it, but it still happened…”
Yaël thought. But, it wasn’t a bad idea actually! Steve was going to help her if Fury wanted it or not and he could…he could…Oh, fuck it!
Tony’s in the workshop. It’s a good change of scenery, a lack of voices in a room where only machinery matters now. FRIDAY barely speaks up, Dum-E, U, Butterfingers and Id-Jit are rolling around in search for something to do. The sound of their wheels on the ground, their gears moving as they lift up their arms, is soothing.
“Whoa!” Peter says, because he knows he has to appear impressed. If he wouldn’t be, Mr. Stark would surely notice. “Is this-?”
“So we’ll just have to figure out what flipped the switch and just flip it back on?” Tony asks.
“For what? The steady, loyal, faithful relationship we had?” Yaël grinned.
“I heard you blew up all your suits,” Steve muttered, trying to divert the conversation. Tony took a breath, passing his hand over his face.
“Hey, Steve! I didn’t know you were here?” Peter asks.
Had Peter been in a better mood, he would have asked Vision if they kind of aren’t brothers. But as it is, Peter keeps his mouth shut and his eyes closed.
“Say, will you ever tell me why you don’t like Yaël all that much?” Peter tries, thinking back of all the times his father mentioned his purple-haired friend. Tony snorts, but keeps reading on whatever literature he’s found on his tablet.
“I just want to prove to him that Steve’s the
- Flash?
“Can I come along?” he asks curiously. Tony then shrugs.
“Hey, uh, maybe we can go back to the workshop tomorrow? Work on some stuff? It’s been a while,” Peter offers. Tony hums while taking out the tablet from the compartment box.
“Yes?” he didn’t sound surprised to hear her at all. Yaël scratched her head. What was she supposed to say now? It’d sound idiotic if she’d just say she had a weird dream, but how would she explain it otherwise?“Yaël?”
After staying away for almost five hours, Peter decides to just head back. He’s tired, he just wants to go to sleep, go back to a day where his biggest worry was needing enough points to succeed his classes. Things were pretty fun back then, if you count out the beatings Harry gave him during that time.
Oh crap, what is this about, now? Tony has been in Berlin for the past few days… if he needs help… does that mean he’s in trouble?
“Loki, cover me!” she said as she let herself fall down onto her hands. The closer to the water, the easier this
“Is this what they teach you at school in Germany? Together with changing eye color?” Wade sat down again and spread his legs over the entire sofa. Not that it bothered Yaël, her rug was fluffy enough to even sleep on. She knew that out of (drunken) experience.
“Now, Tony, I think I’m speaking for everybody here when I ask; is that the
“I’m trying to prove a point to Wilson here,” James explains, pointing towards Sam, who rolls his eyes in return.
“Scotty, my man!” Wade yelled as someone behind the door was making such angry noises it almost sounded like roaring. How did Wade succeed in making Wolverine mad in the two seconds she had been sitting in the kitchen? Logan’s claws penetrated the wood, making splinters flying around everywhere.
“Peter! Hi! Uh, hi! Hello! Good evening! We did- We didn’t know you were coming today?” he stutters out.
Tony’s heart skips a few beats when he hears that sentence. He could be mistaken, but did she say ‘our’? Surely, she means hers and Richard’s, right?
“I’m doing fine,” Tony says. What else would he say to somebody he hasn’t really spoken to in so many years? That he’s having the worst panic attacks about his son dying again and again? Yeah, no, probably not such a good idea, really. “How are you?”
And sure, he
“Jackpot,” Tony says, throwing the folder back into the case and returning to the box. Rhodey, meanwhile, puts the dog back on the ground, letting it sprint out of the room to hastily get something to play with.
“Are you sure you want to move into an apartment, Peter? It’s not like you’re far away from us, after all.”
“I have some antiseptic, wait here for a moment,” Tony tells him, but Peter shakes his head.
“Oh.” The attack…Memories started pouring back into her brain since her dream last night.
“It’s never supposed to be easy, Tony. These things require work,” Steve tries to defend their relationship. Tony just shakes his head.
“How do you plan to get to know him?” the blue-haired girl next to him asks, and Peter turns his head again towards her. Yaël’s brown eyes look at him in genuine interest, but he fears that the answer is still not present in his mind.
“Okay, let’s get started,” Peter says, and after that they start.
“Damn it Peter, stay with me, you hear me?! Don’t you dare leave me! Just stay with me!” Tony grunted. After a little while, he let Peter’s head rest on his shoulder while supporting it, trying to keep his son close while letting out more sobs as he begs his son to come back.
“You and Steve were having an argument during a battle, you know, just a couple’s quarrel, nothing too serious. The bad guy didn’t like it and sent us somewhere. I… would like to get back now.”
“Who are they?” Peter asked friendly.
Tony frowns. That doesn’t sound like Peter, to be angry at Steve about that. He’s usually so calm?
“It won’t end there,” Thor answered. “The longer Hela’s on Asgard, the more powerful she grows. She’ll hunt us down. We need to stop her here and now.”
“It is; the Time stone is here. The sorcerer can use it. It’s quite simple actually,” the God of mischief states. Everybody turns towards Strange. Even Tony looks up with tears still in his eyes, holding Peter close to him. He’s probably only imagining him getting colder, right?
“Okay, what’s going on?” he asks in confusion.
“A bit nervous, but other than that…” When they turn towards Peter, the kid chokes on the drink he’d been taking. While he starts coughing, he holds up his thumb to indicate that he’s doing fine.
Surely, the Arc Reactor can’t be
“No, not ever! You see, I’m banished, I don’t even have the right to get married.” By being drunk, she accidentally started mixing her memories of the two worlds she had been living in.
? He thinks. He’d thought he hadn’t completely fucked his liver up yet, but as it seems his couldn’t handle it anymore, right? He closes his eyes, and just wishes for it all to be over soon. With Pepper and Happy next to him, for a moment, he decides to just forget the world.
Tony looks down at the round plate-formed shield that he’s currently carrying. Then he lifts up his microphone again.
the blueprints?” he asks. Peter’s mouth falls open, any attempt to answer that gone as the breath escapes from his lungs.
“See, you’re doing it again. You’re freezing up on the spot like you’re expecting something horrible to happen. What’s going on, Tony?”
There’s no chance to say anything else; suddenly Steve is greeted with the beeping sound that indicates Tony hung up. He lowers the phone and starts rubbing his eyes, feeling like he’s about ready to start crying.
“Who, Yaël?” Peter asks in confusion, and Tony nods. “What kind of job did she want?”
“I wasn’t much help,” she returns, sounding disappointed in herself. Tony shakes his head, putting a hand on her shoulder and turning her around so she’s looking at him.
Yaël was turning in rounds just to make her skirt swirl around. After a little while, she stopped turning, but couldn’t stop laughing. As soon as she stood still, she saw Steve standing in front of her. Then, of course, she tried wobbling over to him, but fell down of dizziness, what made her laugh even harder.
“Stark, get Dr. Banner out of here
“I got an automatic message from Mary,” Tony admits, figuring it’s best to get it all out at once. Steve frowns a bit, stopping the movement from his hand for a few seconds before resuming. Then he nods.
Of course, an order is an order – even though Tony’s never been one to follow them in the past – so he stays away from it.
He tries to sound threatening, but he wonders if it really comes over that way. He should better just go home, it’s already dark and he still has a bit of homework he needs to finish. He starts running before pulling himself back up into the air, swinging his way back to Stark Tower.
Entering the building, he’s once again greeted by multiple people he’s by now gotten to know by name. There’s Diana Lewess, a woman of forty who ran away from her abusive husband and has been trying to find a job with the help of the people here. Richard Hudson is only in his twenties and got thrown out of his parents’ house for being gay. Maggy Brown failed her classes and is afraid to go back home, while Tessa is an orphan who just didn’t have anything to her name.
Peter closes the door when the three robbers wearing a Cap, Thor and Hulk-mask are loading in the money. The man with the Iron Man-mask (a version that looks even worse than the one Peter had when he was a kid) stands guard with his gun up. Is that a shotgun? Peter wouldn’t know, he isn’t too familiar with weapons of that kind.
“I need to ask, Mr. Stark. Are you in any pain right now?”
Pepper bites through it, tells herself it’s going to pass, that Tony’s just enthusiastic about his childhood idol and him finally getting along. She even talks to Rhodey about it, notices Natasha giving her knowing looks whenever she’s around the compound – however sporadically that is.
“You’re not alone, Mr. Stark,” Peter then says, trying to mute away the sound of the phone-call. He squeezes Mr. Stark’s hand, trying to smile at him but wondering if he’s actually managing it. There are tears rolling down his cheeks, too.
“Too long,” he agrees. Then he pulls away and takes Peter’s face into his two hands. “You look great, Peter.”
“Yeah, well, this super-genius should be getting information on this Black Cat-lady Peter talked about.” Tony pulls back at last, getting out of Steve’s embrace and finally leaving the bed. He limps towards the window, leaning a hand against it, and almost automatically FRIDAY removes the blinds, revealing the city of New York underneath them;
his uncle alive for one moment longer is enough for him. The knowledge that he didn’t die here, that he’s healthy(-ish) and alive…
On the fourth week, Peter handed in the first initial ideas he’s been working on in between helping Francis, only to find that, once again, Mr. Stark
“It’s okay, after what they’ve been through, they won’t let something silly like this break them apart,” he says, waving it off. He has no doubts that later, would he ever get married, he’ll get in arguments like these as well. Besides, the subjects aren’t
“I never thought a guy would hate that there's a hot girl digging them?” Michelle jokes before standing up. Then she slaps him on the shoulder and makes her exit again. “Better not break her heart, then. She’s now captain of the Decathlon team, and from what I heard, you two losers joined as well.”
A flare spikes up, out of the miniature sun. Hitting the ceiling, rocks start dropping down on the floor, only barely missing some people.
“Yes, that’s me,” Peter says, once more cursing his nonchalant way of talking. He sounds just like a messy teenager – which he
“Are you proud now? Attacking this innocent boy with these stupid questions? You’re not going to get the answers, assholes!” she calls out, probably a bit too loud. Behind her, Tony crosses his arms together and Steve slaps his own forehead.
“Uh, how are we going to get there?” Peter asks, realizing it’s a stupid question the moment it comes out of his mouth. Tony grins at him. Even more so when there’s a knock on the door. Immediately, he frowns.
But still, Yaël kept freaking out. Like she had done many times towards him. A loud shriek next to her, didn’t really help. It made her jump and look to her right, pulling herself from Loki’s touch, ready to attack.
At one point, the person Peter’s dancing with is Johnny, who seems to have lost his quest for the day and is already pretty far gone. The guy’s blonde hair is slicked back instead of in its messy, long state. His eyes are glassy, red even. Peter’s not even sure if alcohol is the only thing the guy took. It wouldn’t be surprising, given the color of his eyes.
Come on, Yaël, she thought to herself, grow up, you’re over two-thousand years old, no reason to feel emotional for something like this. She ignored the fact that being two-thousand years was still very young on Helvegen. Luckily Peter didn’t notice her sucking up some feelings, because he threw her a smile and nodded.
“Actually, Dad said Asgard’s been destroyed. Its survivors are somewhere in Norway, he said,” he admits. Bruce looks up after that, mouth fallen open.
“Don’t be afraid, I’m not telling anybody, nor are my fellow surgeons or nurses. Though I am interested in knowing how exactly Tony Stark’s son ended up becoming Spider-Man? Or how you even got Tony’s blood in the first place?”
“So, it was an error from your side that caused the destruction of a full ferry boat?” Ross asks. Tony doesn’t look back at him.
Yaël jumped and looked to her side. Next to her suddenly sat the younger version of the professor.
Tony opens his eyes again, finding both May and Steve walking up to him, holding cups of coffee in their hands.
But, Peter figures it’s what any hero would do in this occasion. Tony’s much the same. So’s Steve, Nat, even Peter. Every one of them would do the same thing.
She wobbled around with Wade for a while. Walking went tiresome after laying down for so long. Her joints hurt from laying down on the floor for four days. After that, her friend started to cook for her. Nobody could ever say to Yaël again that Wade wasn’t a great friend. Okay, he’s crazy, but she’s there when his friends need him.
So playing dirty, is what she’s suggesting. Peter just nods, wondering if he can still call himself an orphan. He has a great Aunt who’s taking care of him, and there’s the biggest possibility that the man he’s going to ask for money to could maybe possibly
Peter looks up at the ceiling, sighing but managing to smile anyway.
“Enjoy the rest of your day, then,” he nods. Miles doubts Mr. Li would know him by name, but then again he’s been proven wrong about Mr. Li on many occasions.
“I can understand why they’re here, but I think it would have been better if they hadn’t been made. There’s so much shit going on now, and we can’t even help out…”
He cleared his throat before answering her. “I’ve been busy… you scared me, you know?”
“When have we ever done something the traditional way?” he jokes. Tony, too, chuckles at that. It’s good to see the laughing lines appear on his tired-looking face again. “I’m serious, Dad. All this crap with Steve, major surgery, the accords… I can understand if you need a little break after a while.”
“It sounds really easy when you say it like that, but basically, yeah…” Bruce looks down at the chart in his hands before turning towards Helen. “I suggest we get him into an MRI. No CT, he doesn’t need much more radiation than he already has.”
“I promise,” he says. MJ smiles again, leaning forward to press a kiss against his cheek. After that, she leans down and takes the first picture she took of him.
It was training with Wanda, the next week, that forced her to show more of herself. The psychic girl most of the times read what Yaël’s next move was going to be a second before she did it. Yaël, thinking too much about how to neatly order her next move, was no match against the Scarlet Witch. So after a frustrated grunt from ending on her back and climbing back up again and again, Yaël shot a spontaneous string of fire at her friend and pulled her down in such a speed, she managed to cause Wanda laying on the ground, flabbergasted. After that, their training only got more and more intense. At one point, a guy had opened the door to ask who wanted to join him for pizza.
“Tony?”
Tony sleeps in the plane. He’s tired, exhausted from the day. First all the arrangement at the school, then the ferry… Tony’s feeling like he’s been flying around in circles today. Even now, just to be sure, he has a suit in the plane, easy to access. He doesn’t want to chance another situation where he can’t fly anywhere because he’s missing one.
“Peter?” a soft voice says when Peter gets down to catch breakfast. His nose is already buried into the third journal by now, and his attention is completely fixed on that that he actually startles when Aunt May calls out his name. “Peter what on Earth are you reading? What are those journals in that box?”
Peter stands up and holds out his hands to both of them. He would have come between them if there hadn’t been a table in the way. “C’mon dads, you don’t have to shout like this.”
Tony loos up when he suddenly sees something in the sky. It’s like a little meteor or something. In a quick motion, it flies over the city until it lands somewhere in the forest. He looks at it for a long while before FRIDAY starts talking.
Aunt Sharon says that she used to give him a good drink, but that it’s not a possibility anymore. She, too, is in search for something else. Rhodey suggests raiding through the workshop for a bit until he comes across anything.
Peter nods, thinking back of how he put it in his bag yesterday. He didn’t take it out after that, too distracted to even do that. Then he picks up his bag from the ground, opens it up, and carefully takes out the box where he keeps the reactor. Mr. Stark looks at him silently as he works.
Tony stays. Steve can’t help but sniff. If only he wasn’t crying, right now.
Steve stays quiet for a few more seconds. Peter’s not sure if he just pissed the guy off, but honestly, he couldn’t care any less.
Eventually, Tony leaves the examination room. They’re going to do more tests, but Tony can’t help with them. He can’t do anything to help his friend for now. The only thing he can do is make a promise that he will do everything in his might to make Rhodey walk again.
Steve sighs. Peter knows it’s awful of him to ask for this, but he’s never seen Tony this scared before. He doesn’t like it one bit.
“Try and open your eyes.”
It had been a few weeks later, while he and Sam were barging in an abandoned warehouse that had been a supposed lead to Bucky, that he got the call.
“Uh, I don’t know, I was thinking you two might want to be alone, but there’s still the watch-duty going on,” Steve explains carefully. Peter nods then, crossing his arms while he leans against the wall. The lights are already dimmed a bit. Steve is just busy grabbing his drawing-materials, so it seems.
They can’t stop him with anything.
“You want him to sign, don’t you?” he asks. All the people in the room give him a knowing look. Of course, they want him to sign.
“It’s fine,” Yaël answered as she tried to wipe off the dirt that was sticking onto her pants.
“I don’t, though now that you mention it, he
He’s got so many more things to learn, after all.
“Eh, he’s almost out,” she assures him. “Now, are you gay?”
“Well, any way for me to get my hands on it?” Peter asks.
Peter lets out a shaky breath. “Yes, please,” he says. He needs Steve’s guidance for a bit. Steve’s always calm and rational (in most occasions, at least), he’ll surely talk Peter through this internal panic attack he’s been having for the past hour or so.
Anyway, chapter warnings:
“No! This is where you zip it, alright?! The
“Peter’s… catching up sleep from England. And… I’m purposely keeping him away from this. It’ll be too much stress for him,” Tony explains, and Steve nods in understanding.
“Peter! Someone’s here for you!” the aunt yelled enthusiastically. She quickly ran to a kitchen cabinet and pulled two spoons out of it, pushed them into Yaël’s hands and dragged her to the door of Peter’s room. Then she disappeared. The last thing Yaël heard from her was. “I’m heading out for work now, just shut the door behind you when you leave. I’ve put the key on the table, you can lock the door and put the key into the mailbox downstairs, okay?” Then the front door slammed shut, without giving Yaël a chance to answer.
While the medications have been helping with the lack of
“Thanks babe,” Tony returns fondly. He allows Steve to pull him up, and then with minimal pressure on his hurt leg, Tony gets himself to the kitchenette where he sits down on the stool. Steve hands him a cup of coffee, and then starts collecting some stuff to prepare breakfast. Tony watches him work for a few seconds before pulling up his phone again.
Steve had responded, and then he stands up and joins Tony to the bathroom. After that, the shot changes. It’s indeed in the bathroom, and the shower is indeed running with the two men underneath it.
“Wedding, yes, we know! Thor wanted to come and get you himself, but there had to be last-minute adjustments to his robes which he had to be present for.”
“A what? At a what?” Steve asks in confusion, pulling his head back a little bit.
“Spider-Man?!” one of the firefighters asks.
Peter wants to sit up, ask further about Mr. Stark and find out where he is, but at the same time he knows that might look a bit weird. So, instead of doing that, Peter stands up completely, giving his wet suit an exaggerated once-over.
"The argument between you and Steve is the thing that got me in here. And when I’m here, I hear that you two haven’t set things right after Siberia. That’s not how things are supposed to happen.”
Tony then finally turns around again, feeling like he’s glaring right at Steve, but not caring about it.
Natasha laughs, suddenly pushing Steve to the side and giving Peter an amused look, nodding towards the super soldier as if he’s the cutest thing around.
“That Tony could never be like Steve. That Tony isn’t deserving of knowing him. That’s why, at first, the two couldn’t really stand each other. Tony just kept blaming
“Hi, Yaël, didn’t really expect to see you here!” Peter said with a wide smile. “Who’s your friend?”
Peter eventually puts the paper aside to start on the distribution. Gesturing Miles to follow him, they take the plates to the great hall where they put them back down on the large tables. MJ is already there, preparing some glasses of water. She’s talking to May Parker who doesn’t look like she got out of her scrubs after work.
On the other hand, he really feels like he needs to pick up. His thumb is hovering above the green button, hesitating on pressing down. He really wants to know who’s calling.
“Fwint!” Yaël answered with a mouth full of cornflakes.
Around seven in the evening – which means they’ve been here for eleven freaking hours – they announce that they’re finished for today. While Peter thinks they’ve made no progress at all, Sue and Reed seem to agree that things go much better than they would have expected. Sure, there’s some arguing. Mostly Sam and Rhodey getting up their arguments and disagreeing all the time, followed by Johnny Storm – who reminds Peter a little bit of Steve, but more with his Dad’s character traits, if that’s possible? – and then Ben. Wade adds a few comments, but nobody is really sure why he’s even here.
“Sure there is,” Tony had returned, smirking slightly while leaning against the wall, still a decent distance away from the bed. “How’s the Capsicle feeling?”
They don’t speak as they serve. At least, to each other, that is. Some people passing by even take a picture of them helping the people out, and Peter doesn’t even mind the sudden attention. Maybe it could bring up some awareness for the homeless in New York.
Like anybody would be able to believe that.
Even now he’s standing there, leaning against the wall with his bag over his shoulder, with one coffee in his hand and the other one pulling his headphones back down.
“I know, stop repeating that,” Peter interrupts him. Tony just laughs towards Vision.
Yaël discovered that he had a high-functioning brain, as he started talking about making a choice between electrical engineering or biochemistry. As Yaël didn’t really know what these two words even meant, she started asking herself if she wasn’t just dumb. Maybe she never even went to school and maybe Peter was just a mainstream boy. But it didn’t matter, she told herself. Even if Peter was just a mainstream teenager, he’d always be the smartest geek to her.
Yaël walked into her apartment, turned on the light and put her cello back on its place. It was Sunday, so she had no gardens to tend today. As a compensation for the lost income, she had been playing on the streets all morning.
“I just figured out my dad wasn’t really my dad, and there’s a slight possibility that my real dad is still alive, and now I’m waiting for the DNA results,” Peter finds himself saying before he can really think of it.
Tony waits after that. Quickly, he leans towards his nightstand and takes out his cellphone, finding that he has indeed a message from Peter. It says exactly what Steve said it did, so he texts back a quick ‘okay’ and instead starts up the security feed FRIDAY has started up.
“I don’t know how this is going to affect his grades, the woman admits sadly. Tony just sighs, realizing that, indeed, Peter isn’t really at the best spot at school. He really doesn’t need this setback.
“What the hell’s going on, Steve?” Natasha asks. All the Avengers are surrounding them, each one looking even angrier than the other.
“I honestly don’t even doubt that,” Yaël answered dryly. “You don’t want to be free and erase all your mistakes? Fine! This was your one and only chance to get out and you blew it.”
“So, uh, who are you?” he asks nervously.
“Huh, you’re right,” Peter mutters out. He erases a part of the neck, and makes it shorter.
“I suppose I’ll head out as well,” Rhodey then says. He stands up and takes his coat. “Let me walk you to your floor before I leave?”
“You want a chocolate?” Wade asked.
“Wait… what?”
His last appointment is around five, which means that he can return home after that one; which actually means he’ll go back to the compound instead, having avoided his penthouse up until then. He’d rather waste his time with Sam Wilson’s dumb jokes than having to spend another lonely night up there.
, meaning that my kid hates me, here. That, and I’m not a part of the Avengers…”
“Well, Mr. Stark, I. Don’t. Care.” Dr. Strange walks off again, with Wong following behind him. Bruce gives Peter a short look before heading in the same direction.
“The only reason why you left Sakaar is because you want your brother to keep on loving you, even though disappointing him is your favourite hobby! Yet, you keep on trying to act too cool for your family’s recognition!”
Tony bites his lips together before shrugging.
an unfamiliar female voice asks on the other side of the line. Peter takes a few steps away from the guy squirming on the ground just to make sure not to be overheard.
“Eh, nothing big…I’ve been sick for a few days.”
“I love you, too, Tony. More than you can imagine.”
Tony hasn’t left his side since he flew Peter all the way here to the compound. As he was on his way, Steve had called Helen and the others that they needed a room ready for him. That’s how they got to look after him almost immediately.
“I just hit her with the biggest lightning blast in the history of lighting, it did nothing!” Thor countered.
- Implied hearing damage
Tony starts, but Peter doesn’t stick around to listen. He drops himself down in a freefall, breaking his momentum just in time. His landing is right in front of Strange, who has just been thrown across the street, smashing against a car.
“Well, thank you, Thor! I’m pretty sure Tony is going to need help. He’s worn so many things before, but I’m afraid Asgardian robes aren’t part of that.”
“FRI, did you warn Dr. Octavius for me?” Tony asks.
At that, the boy seems to need a minute to think about it, and Tony offers it to him patiently. He still feels his eyes sting a little bit, and he almost curses at leaving his sunglasses back at the compound, otherwise he could have just put them on to shield away his red eyes.
Peter chuckles, and follows his instructions. Meanwhile, as he’s busy, Steve comes to ask what he came for.
“Have you heard of anything happening in New York that might need my assistance?”
“I got my eyes opened,” Tony says truthfully. He turns to smile at her, sadly. “I wish I could tell you everything but so much has happened.”
Peter nods. Remembering the way back to his room, Peter walks back with heavy steps. He bumps up against almost every wall, and his eyes are drooping shut. If he’s not careful, he might even fall asleep on the spot. That’s not advisable.
Though the few times she went to the compound, it was to accompany Tony. Despite the fact that he’s no longer an active member of the Avengers, Tony still provides for them. Making sure that they have everything they need and the place hasn’t burned to the ground yet, Tony pays his random little visits that never last longer than an hour. To Pepper, it’s always funny to see his interactions with the people of the team. With Rhodey, for instance, it’s obvious they act the way they’ve always done.
“People of Asgard, and our beloved guests,” Thor then starts, facing the audience. “I present to you; the new Queen of Asgard, and the new keeper of Mjölnir.”
“How long have you been here?” Steve asks. Bruce shrugs.
“I- I’m okay,” Peter tells her, finally taking a few more breaths, but feeling as if there’s barely any air getting through. Maybe he
That makes Tony frown; he thought Peter was here? Or does that mean that he’s still asleep? Why would he still be sleeping? It’s almost past noon, Peter’s usually awake around nine?
Before he can collapse against the building, the Goblin picks him up again and flies him back into the air. Once more he’s grabbed by the throat. Peter’s hands try to get it off him as he’s getting a bit short on breath. He tries to scratch the Goblin’s hands – which is useless since he’s wearing gloves. Tries to kick him in the groin or the shins. Nothing works.
“You found the place easily?” Peter asks. MJ clears her throat then, pointing towards the car that has by now disappeared.
The boy seemed to startle. Almost seeming afraid, he looked back and Yaël saw his face turn red.People were looking up curiously and stare at the young boy. Poor soul, being stalked by Wade in such a public place.
is the thing that Peter hears on the other side of the phone the moment Tony picks up. Relieved to hear his dad’s voice, Peter lets out a shaky laugh.
“What the-?” they both ask at the same time, and then Peter jumps up in the air when the unfinished Lego Death Star falls down on the ground.
Isn’t it his luck that he would need to be in Washington, then?
Tony blinks a few times. Then he pulls one hand loose and pulls Peter closer to him into a strong hug. It lasts for a few seconds, the man unwilling to let his son go. It feels good, to be held like this. Peter, for a moment, doesn’t want it to stop.
“Just leave him be for now. We should get you home, son,” Steve tells him. Peter’s heart aches a bit at hearing that, suddenly feeling like he doesn’t deserve to be called ‘son’ by Steve. Without thinking about it, he wraps his arms around Steve’s torso, pulling him into a strong, needy hug. Tears appear in his eyes again, rolling down his cheeks while the sobs leave his mouth. Steve, meanwhile, stays quiet, silently rubbing Peter’s shoulders. Though the gesture is supposed to be comforting, Peter still feels pretty much like crap.
Steve sighs, walking towards Tony and grabbing him by the arms. Then he leans forward, catching Tony’s attention.
“Yeah, I have to go to the Academy, I already told you this yesterday, remember?”
“’m no longer on them,” Peter says, raising his bottle up as if he wants to toast on it. Johnny blinks a few more times, a sheer bit of worry still clear in his eyes before it’s replaced by something else.
Lopt obviously paused the memory again, since no one else reacted. Yaël saw the artworks become blurry.
“What? This is for me?” she asked. Wade nodded and that was for Yaël a sign to open it. Black, matte plates. A dozen of them.
“It doesn’t really matter. Let’s just get to work, alright? We’re almost finished with the suit!” Tony says, trying to lighten the mood with a sudden enthusiasm Peter isn’t entirely feeling. He decides it’s better to just ask Yaël about it later on.
“He didn’t do anything- I just- when he laughed I thought I heard the Goblin and I panicked.”
There are people surrounding the wreck that was once their car, looking worried and taking pictures. Some of them seem to be making phone calls, while others finally decide to help Peter and Yaël out of the wreck.
“I’m pretty sure I’ll see you around,” Felicia had continued. “And, maybe perhaps… you would be interested in going out on a date?”
Even as the music starts again, Peter’s hearing is now focused on what the other two are saying, so whatever Steve says next, he hears perfectly.
“Hey, hey come on! You’re gonna shoot somebody shoot at me!” he shouts at them.
about it all. She has her friends to do that with.
But what was it about?
“Then maybe it’s for the better I haven’t told anybody, yet,” she mutters.
“Well, no, I’m the wrong person to teach you about being responsible. They just discovered that you were doing dumb shit by being lonely and they needed to get rid of me. Or give me some kind of useful purpose, I guess. Well, they paid me better than the other dudes who wanted me to help them rob a bank.”
They get to breakfast, and they’re greeted by all the other Avengers as well as the Guardians. Everybody looks absolutely stunning – except for Stephen and Wong, who look almost exactly the same with their robes. Natasha’s red hair has been put up with what looks like hundreds of braids and pearls. She has red earrings that go perfectly with the black dress she’s wearing. It’s a great homage to her uniform, with small blue lines on them and red ornaments. Her cape is dark red, but not the same color as Steve’s or Peter’s.
But it’s obvious who it’s going to be. Because why would Sam and Clint and Natasha be let out earlier, and he wouldn’t? Why would they keep him in longer when he’s been locked up before them? It wouldn’t be fair, after all.
“Wade, I lost you!” she answered him, happy to finally see her friend back after such a long time.
“I don’t know, it just came out. You know how my brain works.”
He agrees with May that he’ll be the one to check on the principal; mostly because May is at work, and Tony’s Peter’s legal dad, anyway. It’s easy to explain. What’s even easier is handing Mr. Morita a contract of confidentiality. The man signs it immediately, still seeming extremely shocked about it.
Peter just nods without looking up again, eyes once more rested onto the pages in front of him. Right now, his parents are exchanging the details of both their work, and they seem to find something mutual in it that they agree to work together. That, and they discuss work during a date. There’s nothing
There’s a spitting noise in the background. Then Steve’s voice comes up. “
Peter shakes his head, his arms crossed over his legs while he stares ahead of himself. His expression is unbelieving, surely he’s thinking Tony’s just messing with him. Tony just wishes that’s true, but he figures he should have just told him much earlier.
Tony lets out a relieved breath. He hates nothing more in the world than board-meetings. Especially when they’re here to talk about the fact that he hasn’t been bringing much on the market lately. To be fair, he’s been inventing his proper share of things in the past year, but it’s mostly Avengers-stuff that the public should not receive. Tony isn’t sorry for it, he
Peter nods at her thankfully before moving towards May. When she spots him at last, her eyes go wide and she runs up to him until she’s hugging him. Peter lets out a chuckle as his face is pressed against her shoulder, but at the same time he can’t find much more reason for laughing.
“Good night, boss.”
“Yeah, I haven’t seen her in, like, more than a year…maybe two!”
Tony sighs, reaching for Steve’s hand and squeezing it.
“I’m just messing with you. I’ll see you after school at the compound?” he asks.
“Peter? Weren’t you at your dad’s?” Johnny asks in surprise when he notices Peter standing there.
“This is my second year here. The school’s pretty good, but I can’t wait to just… graduate,” she sighs. “I’m in the arts, what about you?”
“Exactly!” Tony says, pointing towards Barnes. But then he realizes their situations are not at all the same, given that, while Natasha pretty much
Peter smiles back at him, glad that they have Dr. Strange in their lives. Sure, his personality pretty much clashes with Tony’s on very occasions and he’s not exactly the guy they would invite for the holidays, but he’s still a valuable friend to have.
“Director, this is Iron Man. He’s interested on joining the team,” Steve tries to introduce Tony. He sounds a whole lot different from when he was talking to Sharon. He’s got his acting point back up.
Peter has asked Tony if it’s expected of him to sign the accords as well. All Tony did was huff and give a vague, cryptic answer.
“And this Peter, what is he like?” Steve asked curiously, probably to make sure Yaël hadn’t befriended two psychos.
Tony finally looks up to him, reaching out a hand and passing it through Peter’s hair. His eyes seem glassy, like he’s not completely awake from the anesthesia he’s probably been given.
This Saturday, Tony has to leave with Bruce, who has decided to be the neutral point in the whole debate. For a moment, Peter wonders if he could join. They’ll transport Steve along, after all, and he’ll get to see Nat and Wanda again. Sam, too! Even Rhodey is going to fly over for the occasion. Everybody is supposed to be there, so not only the Avengers. There are a few (enhanced) members of SHIELD, according to Tony, but also the Fantastic Four and a few of the X-Men. It’s going to be an enormous gathering, and it’ll probably take the two whole days to get to an agreement.
One look up indicates that, surprise, surprise, it’s once again the Goblin.
He’s behind the sink, having just brushed his teeth. His beard has been growing ever since his admittance in the hospital, but he hasn’t gotten around to shave it back to the usual goatee. His shirt is on the floor. He’s only wearing his pajama pants. It’s an exercise Dr. Wynedell made up for him, for him to accept the current state of his body. So far, Tony hasn’t been looking at his scar. He’s been avoiding it all the time, closing his eyes whenever he’s facing the mirror.
Despite the anger he’s still feeling, Steve smiles up at Tony, who is seated on the table. Allowing him to take his hand into his own, Steve closes his eyes when his fingers are pressed against Tony’s lips.
Around three, when the decathlon team is meeting up, Peter is leaning backwards in his seat, toying around with his pen instead of really paying attention. Michelle is asking them questions, punching him the arm once or twice until he forces out an answer. The coach is even about to call him out when his phone rescues him from this useless charade.
Peter nods, indeed remembering it all. Aunt May smiles a bit, but it’s not entirely out of happiness.
“Can you please ask FRIDAY to prepare the suit? I need to fly him out of here,” Steve says. Peter nods with an effort, but before he can open his mouth, FRIDAY already answers for him.
,” FRIDAY tells him. Tony nods.
“Really?” she asks “Because what I see is one miserable looking man.”
Granted, it’s not as long as Tony would have expected, but it’s still
No, you know what? Scratch all of that, she was going back to earth and she’d be going on with her single, easy life. Just drunkenly sleeping around with random dudes seemed just fine to her.
That information seems to be new to Mary, which makes it all the more clear that she couldn’t have known on her own. Somebody had to tell her; somebody who was aware of the situation.
“He, can’t. He’s got somewhere to go, his mother just called!” Peter makes up nervously. Tony lifts another eyebrow at that, and Ned just keeps on being speechless. A few more seconds of silence are passing between them before Tony sighs.
Peter told Gwen immediately. He didn’t know why, he just needed to confide in someone, he felt alone in this whole ordeal. So Gwen was the first person he showed it to. She was a science-geek, she probably could help figure it out.
Tony is staring. He’s aware that he’s staring, and he knows that he needs to
“We had a disagreement and he headed back to the apartment,” Tony mutters back. When Rhodey returns with his orange bottle and a glass of water, Tony downs the two little pills down in one go before squeezing his eyes shut. It’s going to be another day full of headaches.
“Because we were drunk off our asses, idiot,” Sam mumbles while getting back up. “What’s the damage?”
I still have to fix the mistakes of the previous few chapters. I'm having a nasty cold, and I can't really look at my screen without getting a bad headache, so I'll have to postpone that for later!
“You see here? You select the date you want to travel to. Could be the future, could be the past. Then once you’ve selected a date you press this button here.” Wade shows him which button he needs to push. Tony nods in understanding.
“Steve?” he starts.
So he shoots his webs, perfectly hitting Eddie on the back. Despite feeling the blood running out of his ears, he pushes through. He pulls on the webs, feeling a lot of resistance but not giving up. His muscles complains, his head complains. Tears run through his cheeks, but he doesn’t stop.
Could it be that this Tony is not getting treatment for his depression?
“Tell me, are you in trouble?” he asked.
instead of just uncareful on the road.
But the thing was, that hoarse sound never went away. It costed her a little bit more effort to breathe while talking, but it wasn’t so bad that she couldn’t rattle or chatter anymore. Though, her voice sounded like it wasn’t completely hers. And then there was that accent, which was hers. She was completely sure about that, but why did she talk so differently than the other Americans and-
“Peter!” Tony shouts. He runs to Peter, pulling his sunglasses from his face and showing his tired, red eyes. The moment he reaches Peter, the teenager is pulled into his arms, holding him in a strong hug. “Don’t
“That’s alright, I’m not going to tell anybody I stopped your metal punch with my bare hands,” he says with a wink. Suddenly, there’s a small slap on his shoulder and Tony is standing next to him.
After that he hangs up. Tony wipes his eyes dry and sighs loudly. He shakes his head, and looks everywhere but at Peter, suddenly seeming ashamed about what just happened.
Wade ever even showed up in his life for the first time – and what a meeting that had been! Peter had just been swinging around the city for a moment, checking for disturbances, when suddenly a random guy starts swinging along with him and starts a casual conversation as if it’s the most normal thing to do while hanging high up in the air. When Peter had asked him how exactly he did it, Deadpool had looked up to his empty hands and then had fallen down on the ground with a loud splat.
“Enough for you?” the man then asks, pulling his phone back and putting it inside his pocket once more. Then he taps onto the piece of paper that Peter recognizes as his homework.
They never spoke to each other, until that day. When Peter returned to school after a few days of staying at home, Harry was there with him, and gave him a box of chocolates.
Now, about twelve years later, Peter finds himself unbelieving of the fact that the person sitting in front of him is actually Harry Osborn. The kid who had been sent away to boarding school after his mother died, and had no possible way of contacting him afterwards. He looks different from when Peter last saw him.
After that, Yaël went back to her apartment. On her way back, she decided to get a sandwich, as it was already evening. Yet again, the moment she walked into the sandwich shop, people looked up and weren’t able to keep their eyes from her. If this kept going on, she’d be painting her hair back to her natural color: dark-brown.
“Bite me, Charles,” Tony returns out loud. Steve suddenly pulls back.
Or images that he never wants to see again.
“Well, heck, no, you need to fix this. Stark doesn’t even like me! But still, this needs to be fixed. You really fucked this shit up, Stark!”
The bitter end"
Before realizing it, Tony throws the blankets off and jumps out of the bed with a speed he didn’t know he had. By the time he’s in the hallway, he sees Nat and Wanda already heading towards the bathroom with their towels in hand. Sam is carrying some things out of the Quinjet, and Clint is popping open a beer.
He knows he’s not the only one feeling this way; Steve craves the touch just as much. It’s clear in the way his hands grab on to him, digging in his shirt and pulling it over his head without any warning. And while Tony would have hesitated to let anybody see him without anything to cover his chest, he’s not feeling any doubt in letting Steve see the massive circular scar he has on his sternum.
