This probably meant Steve didn't get to eat the breakfast prepared by the Michelin-starred chef. Tony kicked himself.
“Hah! I wouldn’t be too sure about that.” And with a laugh that was only slightly edged with worry, Shuri launched herself at T’Challa, pulling him into a fierce hug which he returned just as strongly. It was a sweet moment which made even Wanda’s normally-stern expression curve into smile.
“Steve?” Bucky’s voice was barely above a whisper. His grey eyes were strangely blank, searching the ceiling as if trying to part the layers of plaster for something beyond human sight.
"What happened to James Barnes was tragic. And I know that you’d do anything to..."
“And I like when people aren’t handicapping themselves with crappy tools. Just wait until your frisbee gets stuck up a tree and you’re surrounded by bad guys who want to kick your-”
“Is everyone pissed at me?” Tony asked sheepishly as he belted his pants and put his socks up, waves of guilt  already bubbling up from inside him. He hadn't even stepped outside yet and he was already screwing today up. Who missed their own wedding?
Natasha shook her head “I know about as much as you do. I’m just here to collect you two so we can all meet her boss."
Not one person moved.
“Are you saying that Stark is involved criminal activity?” T’Challa had gone still at the sight of the images.
“You want to be my big strong rescuer against the big bad machines?” Leaning against the wall, Tony snickers openly. “Jesus, I've had fantasies before, but to have them play out this literally? There must be so much Freudian stuff swimming around in my brain that I-”
4. It took me almost 30k words, but look they're finally holding hands!
Something isn't right. Steve tilts Stark’s head back and presses his fingers against the carotid artery in his neck.
Scott doesn't waste a moment, stamping down on the gas to put distance between them and the city. Wanda slumps down into her seat, breathing heavily at the exertion.
Of course everyone was. He’d been alone with his mistakes for years just like whatever demons Stark had in his own head…
“Six,” T'Challa interrupted. “I'm coming along as well.”
“I don’t think that’s any of your business.” Steve snaps. He regrets it immediately because Tony’s face goes wide and hurt, before closing off again, stung by his curt tone.
“My dad never thought much of community outreach, his loss really. He talked about the future all the time, but he didn’t think about investing in what was really important.” Stark said on their fifth circuit around the quad. He gestured towards Wanda, who was now watching them curiously. “It’s people like her who are going to change the world. Kids, they’re the future.”
Steve raised an eyebrow. “I’d better help you with that or we'll be here all day.”
“Listen, your macho routine is very charming - in another situation I’d be vocally, enthusiastically on board - but I can handle myself.” Tony casts an uneasy gaze down the currently-deserted hallway. “You're gonna need help fighting those... projection things. They pack a mean punch.”
Sam’s place was the nicest, so they tended to crash there on long jobs. To Sam’s dismay, his three colleagues brought their clutter with them, which only accumulated as the years went by. Steve’s motorcycle magazines found a place next to Sam’s record collection, while the coffee table was piled high with Natasha’s knitting projects and Bucky’s comic books.
Getting louder. Getting faster.
Breathing heavily, Steve touches his fingers to Stark’s neck once more - the return of a pulse sends a surge of relief coursing through him.
...What?
“And you chose that thing? It’s medieval.” Stark flaps his hand at the shield, trying to recover some of his composure. “I feel so much safer now.”
Tony grew warm. The view was indecent, and yet the prospect of constantly being on display was simply electrifying. It was what he was made for, after all: to be looked at. The fact that Steve was the best-looking table he'd ever seen was even better.
add a splash of visual flair to the room.
The most outlandish of these new furnishings was definitely the globe-shaped lamp hanging above him. The last time Steve been in a home, lamps were simple appliances with shades.
“Just stay close to me and don’t do anything reckless.” Steve says, feeling like his day just got more complicated.
“I know you can,” Steve puts an hand on Tony’s shoulder to stop him from blowing up the whole floor. “Save what you have for the party.”
“So. Obie’s behind this.” Tony says conversationally while jimmying open the back of a dented microwave.
Now, they’re battling twenty projections in a high-ceilinged elevator lobby. The battle had made a wreck of the place, leaving burns and gouges in the walls, strewing debris across the marble floor.
The next slide showed a bald man with jovial smile plastered on his cheeks. “Obadiah Stane. Howard Stark’s right hand man back in the day and Tony’s godfather. He’s one of the old guard and still has a lot of sway over the company. The relationship between him and Tony is...complicated.”
Natasha gave him a soft smile. “I miss him too.”
...If only he’d stop criticizing Steve’s choice of weaponry. As Tony’s kill count increased, so had the offers to upgrade his gear. Well, that and the cockiness.
and it was
“My boy…” Natasha must sense that things are starting to go off the rails, because she reaches out Stane’s big paw of a hand to clamp firmly onto Stark’s shoulder.
Guilt was an old friend, wrapping around his ribs to squeeze at his heart. Reminding him of things he couldn’t make right. On bad nights, the thought of slipping into the darkness didn’t sound unappealing. There was something calling him to jump, just jump…
“Whoa, whoa, hold up.” The click of the gun spurs Stark into action and he schools his expression into something reasonable. “Why don’t we all calm down and try work something out.” He doesn't even break a sweat at shifting gears into businessman mode, cannily trying to move things to a playing field he knows. “What do you want, Bones? Money? New tech? Plastic surgery for that unfortunate countenance of yours?”
Having apparently decided Steve was no longer a threat, Tony crouches down to examine the still-glowing power core of the dismembered projection.
6. I just got my IW tickets for the 25th! I'm going to take a few weeks' break to see how the new canon shakes down, though I highly doubt anything in the film will change my original outline for this fic. In the meantime I will continue editing the next couple chapters.  See you guys then!
Of course, no such code existed - it was all part of the gambit Natasha and Bucky had concocted years ago.
Steve had been in the warehouse for so long he had almost forgotten what light felt like.
Steve’s fingers paused over his collarbone.
“Seven… six… ” Steve presses on, trying his best to ignore the chatter. It’s distracting, the way Stark throws so many words around.
“Maybe, but it’s not your problem.” Steve makes a show of fiddling with the PASIV, hoping it would throw her off.
“I’ll be the one bringing the party to them!” Tony crows, turning on Steve with a wide, excited grin. He looks so proud of his new creation that Steve can't help smiling back.
for beta reading!
“It’s weird seeing you without a beard.”
“We sure are.” Tony beamed down at him. “Welcome to the new century.”
Tony winced. “Did they start too early? I told them to wait till you were awake-”
“Sweetheart, ‘shameless’ could be my middle name.” The smugness in Stark’s voice is infuriating. “Well, actually, it's Edward, but nobody gives a fuck about details like that.” His breath hitches, and he makes a series of sounds - short breaths and soft grunts - that Steve really doesn't want to think about too hard.
"Gotcha. We'll create a skirmish to draw enemies away from your location,” Sam replies.
Unprepared, Steve flinches and that's all the time Stark needs to bolt out of the room.
“Are you kidding me?” Panting from the run, Tony’s breath puffs out in clouds as he gazes transfixed at the train. As before, the carriage is covered by a sheen of frost - so cold that it could sear all the feeling out of human skin.
“You can’t.” Stark said shakily. His hands dropped to his sides, which clenched tightly into fists. “It’s too late.”
“I’m sorry about your brother, Wanda.” Steve says.
“Busan, Korea. I interrogated a black market arms dealer for a Wakandan client. I know, I have an interesting life,” Nat flashed them a smile through the rearview mirror. “She contacted me recently, asking me to put together a team for her. Naturally, I gave a plug for you guys."
There were so many good memories of them in this apartment; long hours spent preparing for an mission, patching up wounds, sharing celebratory pizza. It had been more than just a shared workplace or a couch to crash on - it had felt like a home.
Captain America’s shield materializes into his hands and he hurls it with all his might. The spinning edge slices off the metal arm at the shoulder joint - distracted, the now one-armed metal creature turns away from Stark just in time to catch a hit to the faceplate.
Steve realises. The last time they'd worked together Natasha hadn't quite mastered the technique of throwing her voice like that. Now, it was proving to be very effective.
“Sort of. If the subconscious focuses on a pattern, its defences become easier to predict. Let's say…” Steve raises his eyes to the ceiling, trying to come up with a better illustration. “Let’s say I tell you ‘don’t think of white bears’. What’s the first thing that pops into your head?”
“By giving up control for safety?” Steve sits down next to him. “Why are you doing this?”
Tony cursed and began putting on his clothes at a faster pace. As he buttoned up his vest, he snuck a glance at Steve, who was busy writing a text while waiting for Tony to get dressed.
Scott coughed awkwardly. “Can I have some Froot Loops, too?”
T’Challa raised his voice slightly to reach Steve’s ears. “It’s strange to me that a man who steals for a living would so suddenly develop a conscience.”
Sam gaped at him. "You’re kidding, right? That's barely enough time for a regular infiltration, let alone an inception. Just the research alone would take-"
“Incoming!” Sam’s frantic voice blares over the comm. “Guys, we have company!”
Well. As long as he doesn’t completely blow his cover, there’s no harm offering up some truth. You have to lose some to gain some.
Stark lowers his arm and eyes Steve warily. “Want to explain why there are terminator things walking around?”
The second time had started with Bucky spending an entire morning tidying, tossing out the trash in a rare streak of productivity. “Heading out to stretch my legs, Steve,” he said, rolling his shoulders till they popped. It had snowed the night before, which meant Steve could hear Bucky’s footsteps crunching away down the street. Steve had thought nothing of it until that evening when a grim-faced officer showed up on his doorstep with the news that Bucky... that Bucky had…
“Whoa, I really gotta adjust the power on the thrusters,” he clambers to his feet and lurches back to the bench. “That was only 10%, definitely way too much kickback…”
“Obie, Obie, always thinking about the bottom line. You should’ve seen his face when he heard about my freebie clause.” Tony chuckles, testing the tension on whatever mystery item he's constructing. “This is more important than money, it’s the future. ULTRON isn’t something you can put in a box and sell to the mass-market.” He starts flattening out a curved metal plate with a hammer. “I'm gonna make sure the world gets the protection it deserves, and this little program is going to change everything.”
T’Challa shifted in his chair under the weight of five incredulous gazes, looking sheepish for the first time since Steve had met him. “It seemed neater."
A red glow suffuses Wanda's hands and she draws a long breath, curling her fingers into claws.
Ever since the Incident, his dreams - both shared and personal - had been marked by three recurring signs: the train, the ice, and the Shade. Augurs of danger, warnings that his troubled psyche had started to seep into his surroundings...
Steve crouches down next to Stark, feeling slightly annoyed by her levity. Just because Stark was a huge asshole was no reason to treat him so disrespectfully when he couldn’t defend himself.
And yet he couldn't simply... Steve sneaked a glance over at the dark-ringed eyes.
“Tell you what,” Steve answers, feeling a sudden spark of playfulness. “Beat me in this little competition and I'll gladly use whatever gizmo you cook up.”
I'm on
Stark’s face darkens and his voice becomes tight. “Scratch that, let me rephrase; There’s nothing he loved more than the bottom of a bottle.”
Steve points towards the battered double doors. “Through there, it’s just a few hallways from-”
Tony made a sound like a balloon running out of air. “That’s not fair, you can’t just come into my workshop, kiss me like that, then say we have to stand in front of our friends for four hours without even touching each other.”
Steve tries not to fidget under the close scrutiny. He knows his appearance tends to attract attention, but there's not a trace of lasciviousness in Tony’s brown eyes, only open wonder. It’s...unsettling, but not entirely unwelcome.
She flicked through a series of images: a blurry photo of Stane talking to soldiers, Stane getting into a car with a bearded man in sunglasses (“That man is on several government watchlists.” Nakia murmured). The last photo showed Stane and Stark having a conversation at one of the factories - Stane standing a little too close, large hands draped on Stark’s shoulders.
“Call me a square all you like, but-” Steve backs up slowly, moving to the edge of the atrium. “-but sometimes the old-fashioned things work best,” He fixes the angle in his mind, calculating the trajectory and amount of spin needed for his next move. “Teaches you to get creative in other ways.”
“Projections. He’s had dream security training.” Steve says grimly. “Top level too, judging by the quality of armor and weaponry.”
“I think you just found ‘worse’.” mutters Natasha.
“The prototype he showed at the demonstration was nearly complete. ULTRON could launch as early as the next quarter.” The thought of that monstrous technology unleashed on the world made him feel sick.
Steve shivered. Being touched by Tony was something out of this world. He could sense the energy thrumming from Tony, from his bright heart down the pleasure-slackened string, out through the ceramic balls kissing his surface almost lazily. The whisper of electrons charged the air with static, and despite himself Steve could feel the knots in his grain tighten with the tension.
Natasha throws Steve an impatient look through the concealed one-way mirror and that's his signal to enter. Time to head things off at the gate in case Stark actually
He’d first met Natasha in a figure drawing class. One of the other artists wouldn't stop badgering her, leering and making comments about what he’d like to do to parts of her anatomy. He’d gotten bold enough to paw at her leg and Steve had been about to bodily drag him out of the studio until Natasha put the creeper's head through his own canvas. Things had… devolved after that.
It made Tony feel warm all over.
A tiny blue spark of electricity arced off Tony’s string, dancing across the table’s flat top, sending the most pecular feeling shooting through ever fiber of Steve’s being.
“I look at you say that and I almost believe you.” Stark didn't bother brushing off his hands, peering up at Steve with slow tired blinks. “Isn't that what my life has been? A big fat waste and it fucking sucks.”
Steve gazed at T'Challa skeptically. Sam was right, he should walk away from this deal - it was foolishly dangerous, a reminder of his greatest failure - but for the first time in years, Steve felt an awful, desperate hope bloom in his chest.
That is, unless Tony unplugged himself from the ceiling… Tony jiggled in his socket, giving his screws a few experimental twists. Falling for Steve would be literal death for him, and yet what a glorious end. In some way, Tony felt like he had fallen for Steve long ago.
Steve pauses. “I don’t think-”
A panicky Scott squeaks. “It's a dead end! That train took out the whole block. Oh god this is bad, we are so dead...”
With that, Tony did the thing he knew best: shine.
Wanda hovered anxiously. “Do you think we should help him?”
“Well, I’m up now.” Sam slipped past Steve, making a beeline for the coffee pot. “I could hear you thrashing around for the last twenty minutes.”
“That it is.”
“Thanks, I wanted to have fun and not just make a Generic McCitysville.” Wanda tilts her head to give him an appraising look. “Hm.”
"Very well.” He leaned down to press a kiss against her cheek. “As always, I trust your judgement."
Steve raised an arm to stop her. “Hold on, you said he’s dying?” That changed everything. “Why can't we wait until he's more stable?”
Wanda looks stricken. “I'm sorry! I used up most of my energy moving us out of the city.”
“Thanks, but no thanks. I don’t play by anyone’s rules but mine.” Stark slaps his pockets, but upon finding nothing, starts examining the mechanism of the cuffs, giving them an experimental tug. “Check your pockets, Obie. If you have something sharp on you, I can get us out of these handcuffs. Give me a tie pin, or a paperclip. Even a pen will do.”
1. I pictured this level of the dream taking place in the Berlin office in CACW
Steve pressed his lips together. “I never wanted to force-”
“You're in a dream now, Stark.” The rehearsed lie falls smoothly from Steve’s mouth. “Your mind is under attack by Obadiah Stane, but don’t worry, I’m here to help you.”
Life as a sexy lamp wasn’t all it was cracked up to be, though. Being anchored to the ceiling made him the centrepiece of the room, but it also meant that he was always apart from the other furniture pieces. Always above them, never with them.
“This is what I've prepared for each layer of the dream.” Wanda took over the screen. Her design concepts flashed on screen, showing floor plans, 3D renderings. Mazes. “Lots of places to hide, easy to defend against any violent projections.”
“We’re trapped!”
“There are several other exits, but we can't get to them with all these projections in the way…” Wanda scans her surroundings, quickly weighing up her options. “Let me try something.”
It's not too long before they’re ambushed.
They were pulling into the hospital when Steve realized that in their haste to leave, he'd left the watch behind. Too late. Another of those things that couldn't be helped.
Candles! Those things were basically naked baby lightbulbs, the flames dancing like tiny stars at the ends of sculpted ivory wax.
Stark snaps into motion like a tightly wound spring, and a pair of unlocked handcuffs go flying into Steve’s face.
Title is taken from "Afterlife" by Illenium
Steve hates admitting when he’s wrong, but he’s grateful to have backup. One person couldn't have handled it alone.
hold up his end of the deal. Sure, the king seemed sincere on the surface, but looks could be deceiving - it wouldn't have been the first time Steve’s team had gotten screwed over by a slippery customer.
“Language,” Steve answered automatically, spearing an apple slice on his fork and ignoring two pairs of rolled eyes. “I was thinking we go for someone younger this time round. A student, for instance.”
“Focus, Tony.” Steve had put his phone away and was now looking at him with that fond smile, as if he had heard the thoughts running through his head.
3. I'm hugely relieved that IW didn't introduce too much new canon, which means I can carry on with my original plans for this fic. The movie even gave me some new ideas that I'm going to weave in the later chapters - I had no idea that my 'people disintegrating into nothing' plot point would turn out to be relevant in IW too xD
“Guys, are you ok?” Sam voice crackles through the comm. He must be frantic, circling above them unable to help. “Can't see a thing through this smog. God, this train has to be at least fifty feet high…”
, rising into the air like a strand of melted taffy, lifting them high into the air. Scott squawks in alarm to see the ground suddenly fall away.
Steve huffed out a sigh. His own words sounded clumsy and vapid even to himself.
“Come on, don’t hurt her! Take me instead,” Stark’s begging now, struggling at his bonds so fiercely Steve’s afraid he'll slice his arm open or dislocate a shoulder. “I'll do anything. Please... “
2. According to my google research, it's 100% possible to pick handcuffs with a pen. Apparently you have to break it open and use the thingy inside to lift the lock.
Finally, Steve lost patience and asked her bluntly. “Why bring us here and not even tell us why?”
Steve looked at the only two friends he had left in the world and quietly crushed the lingering remnants of self-doubt. “Guess I have nothing to worry about. We're doing this.”
Sam whoops as they merge onto the freeway, diving down to cruise alongside the car. “Nice work, kid!”
“Steve!” Tony flickered anxiously. “You okay down there buddy?”
The doctors managed to pull Bucky back from the brink. But they couldn't save his arm, frostbitten beyond repair from the plunge into the river.
Until one day it wasn’t.
“Sorry, I was just asking! When you say it like that it sounds awful!” Scott held up his hands.
His blatant lack of interest cracks something loose in Stark’s attempt at pragmatism.
Stark is glowering at him from inside the glass cube, sitting as upright as the handcuffs will let him.
“Why did you do that?” Steve sounded angry.
“I wouldn't recommend copying real world buildings exactly. The worst thing that could happen is if your mind loses its grip on reality.” Steve nodded at her sketchbook, which was opened to a study of bridge drawings. “You're a designer, put your own spin on it.”
“Ladies and gentleman, I would like to introduce the Mark 2.” With a flourish, Tony slips the gauntlet on his arm and takes aim at a distant pile of trash.
The next thing Steve notices is the sharp drop in temperature. Their van is parked so close that he can see where every joint of the train is edged with ice, as if it were dredged out of a frozen river. Thick waves of fog start to billow off the carriage, washing over their van and plunging the entire city block into a bitter, oppressive cold.
Sam watched him levelly, taking a swig of coffee. “I notice you haven't told the others about Bucky,” He said. “Scott and Wanda don’t know, and now T’Challa wants to come along too…”
“Sure you aren't, and Uncle Sam doesn't piss red, white, and blue.” Tony puts his hands on his hips, drawing himself up as much as he can, despite Steve having several inches and sixty-odd pounds on him. “So, what are you fighting for? Whales, world peace, the right to wear spangly underwear…?”
Balanced on the small circle of land, Steve can see the entire expanse of the city laid out before him; how the fog sweeps through every street and avenue like a grey wave, swirling around the skyscrapers and blanketing many of the smaller buildings.
“As a matter of fact, I do. Come along, you’re going to want to hear this,” Natasha jerked her chin towards her shiny black sedan. “Remember that month I told you guys I was going to Venice for a holiday? Guess where I went.”
Still, it didn’t mean Tony couldn’t enjoy ogling Steve. Although he did so with extreme guilt.
Steve held out an arm to hold her back. “Stay here, I'll go see how he's doing.”
With that, Steve storms out of the office to join the others in the observation room. He drops the gun in the case like its a poisonous thing, rips the mask off his face, and tosses it in a corner.
“How about: I'm not my father, I'm my own man. I will build something new with my life.” Sam suggested.
“I'm hoping it won't come to that. This is the one mission I can't afford to fail,” Steve down at his cup. “It’s the only way I can move past this.”
“Steve, we would've respected your decision whether you accepted this job or turned it down.” Natasha put a hand on his arm. He turned, looking down into her surprisingly open face. “You’re our team leader, yes, but more importantly, you’re our friend." Her hand squeezed his. “You don’t have to do this alone.”
Steve looms - he’s a lot bigger than most people, he can't help
The communicator buzzes. “Come in, Steve, please tell me you’ve made contact with Stark.”
Once again, it was mesmerizing to watch him work. The flirtatious attitude from earlier had completely vanished, which made Steve suspect that it was just a persona. The dedicated engineer who spins magic out of pieces of scrap, he senses, is the real man.
. And Bucky had been there from the start; defending him from bullies, standing with him at his mother’s funeral, the first person he came out to, and, after they’d completed their first military tour, the first one on his team before he met Sam and Natasha.
“Did you have anyone in mind?”
Natasha tosses something red at him: a cheap Halloween mask emblazoned with a grinning skull. Steve looks at her incredulously. “This is your idea of stealthy?”
Although, there seemed to be something different about this table. Tony swung himself a little closer to get a better look. Upon closer inspection, Steve’s simple appearance was more than it seemed:
“Stane.” Steve lies smoothly. “He kidnapped and drugged you, as we speak he’s trying steal information from your mind.”
The golden light had been the first thing Steve became aware of. At first he thought it was the sun, so rich and warm it was. But there was something different about the light: while it lacked the all-encompassing intensity of the sun, the mild radiance was beautiful.
“I taught them all the things they needed to know, and my life story isn’t one of them.” Steve said.
“Let's hear him out, at least.” Trying to diffuse the tension in the room, Natasha stepped in. "Can you tell us more about the job, your highness?"
“Cut the crap, Rogers, I know when people aren’t being honest with me.” She crosses her arms. “Sam tells me that train was twice the size it used to be! That sounds like a problem to me.”
“You think I’m scared of torture?” Stark spits out. Something desperate and haunted flashes through his brown eyes, only to be instantly replaced by fury. “Unless you’re gonna back up your little threats, this...
“Once I've made contact with Stark, we'll meet you there directly.” The bridge from South to North Tower was several floors down from him. He'd get Stark to the access point and - if they were lucky - manage to avoid any altercations with enemies. In and out. Simple.
Tony talked incessantly, constantly bombarding Steve with bawdy jokes and inane chatter. But instead of feeling irritated, Steve found it endearing.
“...mmf, that's right. And there we go.” Stark’s voice breaks on a sigh, a satisfied little grin curling over his lips.
“That’s really gene-”
He mouthed. Sam ignored him.
“Those…those
Tony took in Steve’s gleaming profile again, and twinkled appreciatively. He had been turned on his whole life, but he'd never felt so
“Well fuck me sideways, someone’s a real hipster.” Stark scoffs, gingerly picking his way through pieces of shattered projection.
“He speaks five languages, and his hobbies include horse riding and restoring vintage cars.”
Tony went still. “We almost fucked on it.”
“Okay, but…” Sam began counting out on each finger. “That'd mean we'd have to buy out the entire wing of the hospital and all the doctors, staff, drivers….”
Gleaming in the afternoon sun, the city manages to be both futuristic and classic - they could be anywhere, any time in the world.
“That’s the point. It's called interrogate, not in-having-fun-gate.” She steps up to Steve and taps a spot on her cheek. “Now, I was gonna get Sam to help with this part, but since that anything that goes wrong from this point on is probably your fault - how about you do the honors?”
“Some of us are still in here, Scott!” Wanda yells, wedging herself into the seat as deep as she can. “Where did you learn to drive?”
Wanda's brow furrowed in concentration as she furiously sketched attempt after attempt, all of which Steve solved easily. It wasn’t like she was doing a bad job - she’d grasped the concepts faster than most people had, and Steve noticed that she kept getting closer with every new attempt - but she hadn’t quite gotten the hang of it yet.
Steve laughed at shook his head. “Sorry, mister, but you made the extravagantly overpriced bed and now you gotta lie in it.”
Nakia, Natasha’s contact, was a slender woman garbed elegantly in Wakandan fashion. Her hair was styled in knots, the tips dyed a trendy shade of maroon. She met them in the lobby of a luxury hotel, the kind of place Steve might have designed in another life.
"I know this is rather sudden, which is why I’m prepared to offer an advance. You'll find that it’s a more than generous." T’Challa gestured to one of his bodyguards, who slid over a check for a sum of money so outrageous that even Natasha raised an eyebrow. “And the other half upon successful completion.”
Swiftly as he can - all the while trying to avoid the fingers stabbing at his eyeballs - Steve wrestles Stark into the van where a waiting Natasha jabs a needle into his neck. The sedative kicks in within a few seconds and he goes limp in Steve’s hold, eyes fluttering shut.
Owner’s Companion let out a moan, a drip of his fluid starting to trickle precariously towards Steve’s surface.
Tony wished he could throw himself onto the ground to end his shame. This was all probably because Tony had bungled their first meeting and Steve thought he was arrogant or something.
Bracing herself against the seats, Natasha leans out the shattered window with a rifle, picking off any projection that gets too close. It’s a heart-stopping chase to stay ahead of the projections - every projection she shoots down is replaced by three more.
They're trapped.
Inception. The word was a horrible reminder. Of how the awful thoughts had eaten at Bucky’s mind until the words were the only thing left.
“I’m not joking, this is all a dream.” Steve sweeps his arm out, gesturing to the projection in the distance. “Look around you, since when did SI have metal bodyguards?”
A big thank you to
Until Steve had gone and ruined all that.
“I’ve never seen a hanging lamp before.” Steve examined him curiously.
It should have been hard to look kingly while holding a half-eaten bowl of cereal, but T'Challa managed it somehow. “I have been trained in combat and possess a basic understanding of dream physics, so you won't have to worry about me slowing you down.”
“As experts, wouldn’t you be able to keep these variables under control?” T’Challa commented, steepling his fingers on the table. “Unless you admit this task is beyond your ability.”
Steve’s unique patina was utterly enthralling - Tony had never seen wood with such a glossy finish.
“Don't burst.” Steve ordered sternly. He had keep things under control before both their feelings ran away with them.
Nakia sat on the edge of the bed, watching him pensively. “If the situation is already that dire, perhaps a more permanent course of action…?” Her words trailed off but he knew what he knew what she was implying.
Natasha cleared her throat. “Talk about a trip down memory lane, huh?”
Tony gives an “oof”, wind knocked out of him as Steve shunts him against the wall.
“Uh, T’Challa did give us enough money for the next couple decades,” Sam ran a hand through his buzzcut. “We can afford to hire professionals. We don’t need to scrimp on building the team.”
But Steve hadn't noticed - he'd been too busy trying to readapt to a mortal plane of existence, that he blithely assumed that Bucky would be able to make the same adjustments.
In a blink, Steve finds himself standing in a business office.
“No, what did you do to your friend?” Tony presses. His voice is apprehensive, as though he expects Steve to confirm his worst fears. “What happened?”
“Please do.” Steve’s frown deepened, which made Tony’s insides feel like they curled up and died.
Stark jerked and threw up over the roots of the tree.
When he uncuffs Stark’s hands from the pipe, the wrists come away raw and bloody; he'd shredded the skin in his desperate attempt to save “Pepper”. Feeling a stab of guilt, Steve lowers the unconscious man to the ground and starts bandaging the torn skin in a roll of gauze.
Natasha pulled up a family photo of the Starks. It looked like it came from private family album, and had probably been one of the last photos taken together, because Tony looked like he couldn't have been older than twenty.
“Yes.” Steve says tiredly. Now seemed as good a time as any to pick up where their interview had left off.
Barely three days later, the call came.
Self conscious, Steve smooths his hair back again.
“There's evidence suggesting he's selling to terrorists, rogue nation, dictators…” Natasha shook her head. “If I had more time I could dig something up more concrete, but this is all I got.”
A silence fell over the table. Something felt significant about the moment, but Steve couldn’t put his finger on why. “Looks like the gang’s back together again.”
Steve noticed his dlight, because that perfect smile brightened. And then dimmed. “But...”
“Do you ever stop talking?” Steve snaps, feeling the return of his migraine. This mission was turning into one headache after another; dealing with an uncooperative target on one hand, and the constant threat of death via nonexistence on the other.
Stark’s brow furrows in suspicion. “ ‘We?’...what do you mean “we”? Who else is here with you…?”
“Thanks, Nat. I'll have a chat with her."
"Look, you've been through so much shit without complaining and you deserve so much, all the nice things in the world.” Tony said.
“I've never never met an antique before, either.” As Tony stretched his wires to the limit, he caught sight of his reflection in Steve’s satiny surface. The image gave him a jolt, because it was a angle few got a chance to see: straight up the base of his closely-furled lampshade, through the gap where his pull string dangled out of, giving an unadulterated view of where his glowing core was nestled.
Maybe her grumpiness had been Steve’s fault. Small talk had never been his strong suit.
“All I'm saying is I can tell the difference between someone running towards something, and someone running away from it.” Sam stated. “You can’t keep blaming yourself - Don’t give me that look, I know you do it all the time, going around like a big sad golden retriever all the time.”
In the freezing darkness that followed, he could hear glass shards pattering on Steve’s surface. The thin curls of smoke streaming from his shattered bulb was evidence of his lack of control, and despite his extinguished state he felt a hot rush of shame.
Tony opens his mouth to say something, but his gaze catches on something behind Steve and his eyes fill with shock.
The man turned towards his voice and Steve realized with a shock that he was staring into the face of a bedraggled Tony Stark.
. Wandering off alone, unarmed, through a building infested with eight-foot tall metal robots falls firmly into the latter.
The elevator doors opened to a luxurious suite, lavishly decorated with with Wakandan art and textiles. Nakia brought them to a meeting room where her king was seated at the table.
Bucky had always been better with people than Steve, that was what made him so good at extracting information. But both of them shared an appreciation of architecture and the unlimited possibilities offered by the dream world.
“Not true,” Sam grinned. “Nat was telling me about that time she trashed a pub in London.”
“Creating buildings isn't all I can do - I can move things with my mind.” Wanda looks drained but her eyes are dancing. “It's pure creation… I've never felt anything like it.”
“Ah!” Steve shuddered, and acompartment sprang open from his side.
Tony swung himself on his wires to get a closer look at the mysterious package. All the essential furniture had already been moved into the new apartment. Perhaps Owner had splurged on a treadmill, or a piano, or a massage chair.
Wanda grew more agitated as her ideas were discarded, but like any artist her perfectionism been piqued. He sent a mental thanks for Natasha being such an excellent judge of character.
“Are you ready? Stark’s going to be waking up soon.” Steve asks Natasha.
And it's a feeling Steve understands all too well. He'd always hated being dependent on someone else - the patronizing way people behaved when he was fourteen and skinny and asthmatic. It had only gotten worse when “orphan” became yet another labels to describe his life. Always being underestimated and pitied, treated like he was some helpless thing in need of saving.
“No, of course not,” Steve says hastily.
“What? No!” Stark turns to Stane sharply. “Seriously, Obie? You actually wanna play ball with Jack Skellington over there?”
But Tony was a prisoner of his own technology. No matter how much he stretched out his pull-strings, Steve always remained a tantalizing few feet out of reach. So close, and yet so far. Their paths were never intended to meet.
Tony’s face shutters at the refusal. “Fine. If you're gonna be like that then it's better that we go our separate ways.” His jaw snaps shut with a click and he turns his back on Steve to leave.
“Mhm. Sounds like you had a lot going for you. But I'm sensing some tension in the use of past tense. What happened?”
Sam nodded. “We’ll need some time to scope out…”
“What are you doing?” Steve frowns as Tony starts detaching the core from the chassis.
“How soon?”
Steve’s knuckles were still tingling as he and Sam left the Hammer Industries complex. He always felt grimy after a meeting with Justin Hammer. The man was as slimy as a slug and just as spineless.
all day, every day: brighten up rooms, prevent people from tripping over things in the dark, and - since Tony was no ordinary lamp, he was a
“Can't you just hide the news that he died?” Scott asked.
Natasha was in disguise already; her petite figure replaced with the burly form of Obadiah Stane.
They’re close, far too close now; it's impossible not to notice how Stark’s pupils are fully dilated against the brown irises, and the way a bead of sweat traces a line from temple to cheekbone. There’s a purplish bruise forming beneath one eye and a crimson scratch on the edge of his jaw - had he been jostled that badly in the turbulent ride through the city? Stark’s chest is beginning to heave as his breaths pant through slightly parted lips, in and out, faster and faster…
Wanda’s eyes lit up at the challenge and quickly flipped open her sketchbook to a fresh page. Her enthusiasm had him feeling nostalgic; he remembered what it was like to be eager to show off his skill, so full of ideas that they were bursting out of him.
I'm on
Steve eyes it all dubiously. He'd seen junkyards with more life in them. “You sure about this? It's garbage.”
Hand in hand, they exited the lab together.
Steve’s hands cupped his jaw and tipped his face up. Tony blinked, surprised to see that the blue eyes were full of affection rather than annoyance.
Steve can see the exact moment Stark realises it’s a kidnapping, because the dark-haired man springs into action before Steve can get close, throwing a hard right hook towards Steve’s nose. Simple enough to counter; Steve catches the punch easily and drags Stark forward by the fist, using the momentum to throw off Stark’s centre of gravity. He feints a palm strike, and when Stark shies away, traps the shorter man in a rear headlock.
Steve clinked his coffee mug against Natasha’s espresso cup and Sam's glass of orange juice. "Here’s to success."
He felt his bulb warm, becoming uncomfortably hot. Any moment now, he was so close!
have been at me for days.” Natasha’s imitation of Stane’s voice is flawless, punctuating every word with a groan or pained croak. It's very convincing, and Steve can almost believe she really is an old man beaten to an inch of his life. “I don’t know how much more I can take.”
“There are too many enemies for one person to fight through, so we’ll have to work together.” Steve concedes grudgingly.
Natasha’s smirk fades. “Wanda feels bad, you know. She thinks the train showed up because she botched the design of the city.”
“ENOUGH!” Everyone’s attention immediately snaps to Steve. “Losing our heads isn't gonna help anyone. There’s no other way through this but forward.”
thought Tony.
Nakia smiled and lifted one hand to cup the side of T’Challa’s face. He wrapped a hand around her fingers, turning his head to kiss her palm.
Both of them turned to Steve with knowingly pointed looks.
Steve laughs, short and fierce. “I’ll take it. He did lead Camelot through a golden age.”
“That's really amazing,” Steve says. “I've never seen a weapon like that before, and the way you just came up with it right off the bat-”
The man he'd met at the college seemed like a different person; this side of Tony displays the vibrancy Steve had seen in Natasha’s research videos. However, as now he’s discovering,
Steve pulls his hands away to avoid getting his fingers pinched. “Nothing gets by you, does it?”
“That turned out fine in the end,” Maybe not for Rumlow, though. He wondered if the man ever recovered the feeling in his hands. “Still got the job done.”
Steve smiled. “No, it was actually quite lovely. They played some tunes I hadn't heard in a while. I enjoyed their arrangement of
“All I’m saying is- ” Sam began heatedly.
As luck would have it, they find a maintenance room tucked away at the end of a hall. The stuffy little room barely counts as a storage closet and it's a mess inside; piled high with broken appliances, old AC units, half assembled computer terminals, with a few battered tools scattered over a workbench.
A trembling Scott hands over a syringe and Natasha jabs it into Stark’s arm.
“Uh, not being born yesterday, that’s for sure.” Stark shifts restlessly in his seat and the handcuff clinks against his watch. “You really think I’m so gullible that I'd believe a single word that comes out of your mouth?”
“So if he kicks it, we're trapped in darkness till our brains turn to mush?” Wanda’s shoulders quake as she wraps her arms tightly around herself. “This is so messed up…”
Steve gapes several seconds too long before tearing his eyes away, feeling a burning flush run up his neck. “Can you stop playing with yourself and focus here?”
“How about my lack of a gag reflex and ability to hold my breath?” Tony replied, unable to resist poking a hole in the moment.
There had been two days which Steve could, without question, classify as the worst two days of his life. The first time happened when he was abroad with his platoon; the news of his mother’s passing was more devastating than any mortar round.
He was used being admired. To hear the oohs and aahs of visitors as they gazed on his glossy outer shell, the many hands which caressed his sculpted curves in awed wonder, the short hush that fell over the watchers when his balls were pulled and his bulb lit up, bathing the room in a warm wash of light.
. Come on, it won’t take long.”
“So. Big man, are you? Not afraid of pain. But how about your friend, Pepper?” Steve shakes the gun towards the open doorway for dramatic effect. “Give us the code or she gets a bullet to her pretty head.”
The praise makes Tony's eyes light up. “If you think this is great, you should see what I can cook up in my lab. I could make an entire set of-”
As Steve watched him walk away, something about the set of Stark’s shoulders stirred a memory.
For a split second, confusion blooms wide on Stark’s face before being swept under an insolent sneer. “Why should I give you anything?”
“Maybe.” Wanda shrugged. “What's the difference between a Point, Forger and an Architect?”
She jerks her thumb to where his discarded mask sits in the corner. “So remember to wear your mask when you interrogate him.”
“They couldn’t get through to me so they started on Pepper. Poor woman, they’ve been torturing her for days…” Natasha-as-Stane laments. “You’ve got to give them what they want or they won’t stop…”
“You don’t need to worry about me being compromised.” Steve leans against the wall. There’s too much riding on this mission for him to just… let his feelings run away with him.
They'd held hands when they leapt from the train. The freefall into the freezing canyon seemed to last an eternity, ears filling with the icy roar of the wind, not knowing which direction was up or down, desperately hoping there wasn’t a sickening crunch waiting for them at the bottom
The moment over, Sam reverted to work mode. “For starters, we're going to need a bigger team. This isn’t
“I just gave a full ride to this year’s class.” Stark carried on. “Bright kids, all of them. I mean, give people a little faith and they’ll make you proud…”
“So, tell me if I've got this right,” Wanda asked, flicking a lock of dark hair over her shoulder.  “How does designing a dream create a new reality?”
Steve’s broad frame filled out the shoulders of his suit so perfectly that Tony was two brain cells away from drooling all over himself. Everything about Steve’s appearance, from the quarter inch of crisp white shirt at his wrists to the way his jacket accentuated that trim waist, to the fine fabric hugging that perfect ass - god, Tony could write odes to that ass, get on his knees and worship it all day long-
“What… the fuck just happened?” gasps Natasha. She looks more rattled than Steve’s ever seen her.
http://www.flowermeaning.com/zinnia-flower-meaning/
“Of course.” Shuri nudged T’Challa with her elbow. “I can’t believe you’re actually joining this crazy mission too. Baba always said you were too hotheaded.”
Tony had only been in the new place for a few weeks when the movers showed up again, lugging with them a battered packing crate.
Nakia cast her eyes down and T’Challa knew they were both thinking of the same thing - N’Jadaka had changed so suddenly; the rage-filled murderer who called himself Erik was nothing like the nerdy cousin he'd grown up with. The poisonous idea had torn him apart from the inside, corrupting his mind and wreaking destruction on centuries of progress.
Scott perked up from his slouched position on the couch. “I've been synthesizing a new sedative that can sustain multiple levels of dreams while leaving inner ear function intact.” He shivered “Wouldn’t want to go too deep without giving ourselves a way out.”
“We could work with that.” Steve forced himself to speak, hoping that no one had noticed his lapse in focus. He turned to Scott. “Did you make the formula we asked for?”
There's movement from one of the rooftops. Steve catches a glimpse of a figure, shadowy and long-haired, a sniper rifle held in hand. It’s too distant to make out any facial features, but there’s a certain set to the stance that he recognizes all too well.
“Too much?” Tony flickered, withdrawing his string and closing his shell slightly. “Sorry, I know it's a little much on the eyes…”
There’s foolish and then there’s
Steve’s tone was ambivalent. “It was a little unexpected, waking up to a swing band serenading me from the street-”
“What, I can’t admire the scenery?” The words were half out of his mouth when Tony realised that other parts of him were starting to get interested.
Steve felt lucky being able to see him every day.
Stark goes taut in horror when Steve shoves a handcuffed Natasha through the door. In her Stane-disguise, she’s pretending to be delirious with pain, sporting a bruised face and a bloody nose (“Don't be such a chicken, Steve, this won’t work if you don’t make it look good.”).
“Is that what this is? An intervention?” Steve scraped bits of solidifying egg off the edges of the pan. “Because if you're worried I’m going to do something reckless...”
Unpursued, Scott races away from the wreckage.
“You're too easy to wind up.” Stark laughs, clapping Steve on the shoulder. “At ease, Wonder Bread, I'm just messing with you.”
Tony loved it. “That's it… Steve, you're so hard…”
The sight makes him wince internally, and he wonders if they’d pushed Stark a bit too far. If he were truly a narcissist, surely he would have jumped at the chance to throw Pepper under the bus and save his own ass.
Most of the enemies are on the ground so he pauses to catch his breath, but… movement from the corner of his eye draws his attention; a pack of six is advancing down the stairs, loaded cannons aimed straight at him. Steve turns, looking for support - but Tony is busy fighting two projections on the far side of the room.
“Sure know how to toot your own horn, don't you?”
“No.”
"It’s settled then," T’Challa said. "Assemble your team, Captain Rogers, and choose your people wisely."
“You’re just full of secrets, aren't you?” Tony laughed. “I look forward to discovering them all.”
“The rest of you guys know the drill. Time will stretch out as we go deeper down the levels, giving us more breathing room to work. A minute here is several hours the next level down. Remember your points and keep an ear out so you don't miss the kick.” Steve pauses. “Anything hurts you, hurt it back. Get killed - walk it off.”
Away from the thing he knew was waiting for him in the dream world.
Sometimes Steve wondered how he had come through whole ordeal with his own sanity intact. Maybe it was because he was the one who initiated the idea. Maybe it was the part of him that was too stubborn to quit, that was still a scrawny kid who picked fights with bullies. There were a hundred maybes.
Their time in Limbo had lasted decades. It had been a creative paradise - pushing their imaginations to the limit, building things that could never exist in the real world - nobody to stop them, not even time. Several lifetimes bookending each other, stretching into infinity. All the time in the world. It had felt like enough.
(See the end of the chapter for
“So he gives himself the idea?” Sam asked.
Steve darkened in embarrassment. “It seems I have a secret compartment.”
Steve hesitates. “The day I met Wanda, I also ran into Stark. He was at the college for some event.”
The wall of smog at end of the street darkens, and then the iron legion bursts through the fog, heavy bootsteps echoing off the buildings as they advance on the van.
“He dated a whole string of supermodels and actresses over the years, but nothing ever serious.” Natasha had compiled a huge collection of tabloid covers and paparazzi photos of Stark out with a model or pop star. Stark didn't have a type other than young and pretty...he did seem partial to blondes, though.
Wanda yelps as a bullet crunches into her window.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about! I couldn't tell you a code even if I wanted to.” Stark appeals to Stane but Natasha remains unhelpfully silent. His eyes widen imploringly when he looks up Steve. “Look, I’m trying to work with you here, but you gotta ask me for something that isn’t made up.”
“That's a huge exaggeration, it was only one tiny brawl. Hardly what you'd call a ‘trashing’, no matter how you slice it.” Natasha blew a stray strand of red hair out of her eyes. “The fire was definitely an accident though.”
His eye caught on the stack of boxes which had sat in the corner of the living room for years.
Steve was shocked by how strung-out Stark looked; dark shadows were ringed around swollen eyes, his clothes hung loosely on his compact frame like he'd lost a lot of weight, the scent clinging to him reeked of sweat and medicine and too much coffee.
“ALRIGHT! Alright, I’ll give you your damn code! For god’s sake don’t hurt her, please.
“He’s not my friend.” Wanda shoved her phone into a pocket with a surly glare. “You said something about an internship?”
His surroundings are furnished in dark greys and frosted glass, modern and minimalist. Rows of computer screens and server towers line the walls, glinting coldly under the fluorescent lighting.
“That's what I like to hear,” Natasha grinned. “As a wise captain once said: let’s get down to business.”
“This is it, people. We gotta go.” Sam tossed his phone on the couch and immediately began grabbing equipment.
With no time to think, Steve summons the first weapon that comes into his head.
“I just have one of those faces.” Steve answers as noncommittally as he can.
“Shall... shall I just cancel everything? Let’s elope right here. I have pillows and snacks in the cupboard so we can cut right to the sex marathon.” Tony ground his hips against Steve’s impatiently, suddenly annoyed at how many clothes they both were wearing. This never would’ve happened if they’d held a beach wedding.
“I'm looking forward it,” Steve looked down at him, lips curling into one of those blindingly sweet smiles, the ones that made every thought go straight out of Tony’s head, reducing him to a state of dopey contentment. Tony was vaguely aware of the other Avengers vacating the landing pad with disgusted groans, but who cared what they thought, anyway?
“I don’t want to be defenseless.” Tony’s voice has gone soft and uncertain, as if he’s ashamed of admitting it. His gaze flicks up and for an instant the mask of bravado drops away, and in his eyes- there, Steve can see it now - is the fear of being a burden, of being useless. Of being weak.
“Don’t be ridiculous, Tony, it’s just furniture.” Steve folded him into an embrace. “I need to get you to lighten up more.”
Steve noticed what he was doing. “Don’t do it, Tony! He’ll throw you away!”
“...and that’s why I can’t bring strawberries into the office anymore.” Stark finished his rant with a disgusted scoff. He nudged his knee against Steve’s, like he expected Steve to know what he was talking about. “Unbelievable, right?”
mistake. He could still hear the crunch of snow as Bucky had walked away that day, walked straight to the bridge in the dead of winter where he had…
“I know there's little she can't handle, especially under your tutelage. I’m thinking of my own stress levels.” T’Challa muttered ruefully.
To Tony’s dismay, his new home had been dull, putting a real dimmer on his expectations. He was simply too far away from any of the other furniture to make friends with them. Tony didn’t expect the rest of his future to be bright.
Tony raised an eyebrow. “Was that directed at me?”
“They took all my belongings,” Stane says unhelpfully, but Steve catches Natasha quickly palming her tie clip.
Steve chases after him, cursing his inattentiveness all the way. Stark must have been picking his handcuffs under the table the entire time, using his mouthiness as a distraction - and like a fool, Steve had fallen for it. If they weren't so pressed for time, Steve would be more amazed at the speed of his escape, and that he'd managed it with a
Being thrown out from places seemed to be a running theme with his friends.
“Kind of. And I'll tell her you said that.” Steve smiled, imagining Natasha’s reaction.
“The only way to getting out of a dream is to die. The easiest way is to fall from a high place.” Steve watched her carefully to see how she’d take that piece of information. This was the part of the conversation where most sane people yelled at him and walked away.
Steve tucked him against his chest, settling them both under the sheets. “It was my grandfather’s, he had it way back in the 30s.”
Steve shakes his head, still a little stunned at how Tony’s mood could change on a dime.
A lone projection patrols the rows of cubicles, regarding Steve with little interest as it trudges out of the office and into the main corridor.
Natasha grimaces, an effect greatly enhanced by Stane’s beady eyes. “You met him before this? That's not good. If he recognizes your face, that could throw off all our calculations.”
Steve rolls his eyes, trying to hide his relief at not being recognized. “You know, just because we're in your dream doesn't mean I have to put up with your bull.”
Steve is on his own.
“Where did you go that was Not-Venice?” Steve asked as Natasha drove them uptown.
T’Challa was younger than Steve had guessed; the young king was handsome-featured, with close cropped hair and a neat beard. He was wearing a long black tunic with silver detailing at the collar and cuffs. His dark eyes, large and thoughtful, met Steve’s with a commanding gaze. His chair was flanked by two female bodyguards, both attired in red body armour and carrying formidable-looking spears.
The roar of an engine filled the air.
Steve splashed water on his face in Sam’s bathroom. T’Challa’s words were still running through his head. The king's promise both intrigued and unsettled him. He’d been searching for a cure for so long, but now… he wondered if the price was too high.
He’d been proud of himself for keeping a level head in the weeks leading up to the wedding, but now that he was just twelve hours away from the ceremony, doubts had started to trickle in, and now he wasn’t sure a quiet little ceremony would be enough to convey the
“Not to me. Tony you’re the literal the light of my life.” Steve answered. The timbre of his words was sincere.
“I'm here to keep you out of trouble.”
Steve immediately drops his hands and steps back. “Sorry. That was completely uncalled for.”
Steve draws his shield, not liking the atmosphere of the hallway. Something’s coming, and he has to be ready.
- that stuff is so easy that we could do it in our sleep,” Sam tilted his neck to the side, narrowly dodging a grape thrown by a groaning Natasha. “A full blown inception is going to take more than the three of us to carry out.”
Their path to the bridge is blocked.
Steve was not a violent man, but in that moment he’d been pissed enough to contemplate wringing the idiotic man by the neck. Still, it’d bought him some small satisfaction to leave a huge hole in the wall of Hammer’s new conference room, if only for the dumbfounded look on Hammer’s weaselly face.
Now, with only two weeks to the deadline, everyone was gathered in Sam’s living room for a team meeting.
“Did your table just dump us on the ground by itself?” Owner’s Companion grumbled.
Steve had awoken to a room painted in the deep orange glow of the early evening. By the clock on the mantle, their entire sleep (
“Terrific.”
"Address him as your highness." Nakia cracked a smile at him. "Don’t worry, we don’t insist on all the formalities. Just treat this like you would any business meeting."
Sam paused, opened his mouth, and closed it again. Steve knew what the words on his tongue were, they've had this conversation so many times he knows it by heart.
Wanda was a sophomore with a penchant for red leather jackets and black nail polish. Her entire style - from the pin-straight dark brown hair and heavily lined eyes which pinned him with a frosty gaze - screamed punk rock vampire.
“Yes.”
“Oh, I like this. I’m gonna make you eat those words,” Tony practically cackles at the challenge. “Prepare to be upgraded so hard you won’t even know what happened.”
So he scans his surroundings, looking for anything he can turn to his advantage... Steve catches sight of the humongous wrought-iron chandelier, an evil-looking thing studded with jagged spikes.
"Good idea. World's been through the wringer. Ostentatious displays of wealth, probably not the best look.” Tony nodded, mentally scratching off his fantasies of marrying Steve on a private island with a 100-piece orchestra in attendance, as flocks of doves were released to fly across the dramatic sunset. Yeah, he was a little disappointed he wouldn't get to throw the big fancy wedding he’d always dreamed of - Tony wanted to
The comic book at the top of the stack was a vintage copy of
And doves were tacky, now that Tony thought about it. Perhaps a flock of bald eagles was more befitting of the occasion...
T’Challa’s eyes flashed. “You're asking my sister to cover up a death, never mind it's the death of one of the most prominent businessmen in the world? Are you out of your mind?”
“But Steve, I-” Tony’s train of thought puttered out when Steve closed the distance with a kiss. His arms automatically went around Steve’s waist the same time Steve’s fingers threaded through his hair. The gentle pressure as Steve opened his mouth to accept his tongue sent a spark of sensation up his spine, and the sound Steve made when Tony’s hands wandered lower to squeeze at his ass had every every synapse in his brain short-circuiting.
(See the end of the chapter for
Shaking her head, Natasha starts rolling her shirtsleeves up over Stane’s huge arms. “Anyway, what's done is done. I suppose you did what you thought was right.” She messes up her tie and rumples up Stane’s clothes. “The possibility of Stark recognizing you won't torpedo our plans, but it could throw a wrench into them.”
“Tony has a heart condition.” said Natasha. “Every few months he checks into a private hospital for a medical procedure. The next one’s due in 2 weeks, which puts us right on schedule with T’Challa’s deadline.”
“-from stealing an idea out of my brain.”
A broad, perfectly round surface, balanced on shapely legs. Strong lines enhanced the dense applewood grain, the rich colour free of knots and imperfections. The rim of the tabletop shimmered where a delicate pattern of scrollwork and stars was picked out with mother-of-pearl inlay. Every inch of the table gleamed with varnish, the kind of coat that indicated Steve was built to last.
“Nice face, Skeletor.” Stark raises an eyebrow, clearly unimpressed by the mask.
He really didn’t know. He had no clue what to do, and Stark was gazing at him like he held all the answers in the universe.
“So what?” Tony flared. “He can just buy another lamp.”
The garbage truck had moved on and now the street was completely silent. Stark’s watch was sitting on his desk where he had placed it the other day. He picked it up - the watch sat heavy in his hand, and was so finely made that the mechanism didn't even make a sound as the hands ticked the seconds away.
“So how’d that speech go?”
“What? No, that’s not her fault, I'd better talk to her...” Steve heads for the door but Natasha’s chilly tone freezes him in his tracks.
Tony gulps. “Where to next?”
He’d always had good instincts, and his father had taught him well; how to read the swirls and eddies of power like the signs before a storm.
But Steve didn’t need to know that.
He only wished he knew what to say. Every time he tried to get his courage to talk to Tony, nervousness would cause him to table the decision for later.
“And talking about it will? Doesn't change what I did.”
Steve huffs a sigh and puts on the ugly thing.
“That reminds me, I forgot to tell you that your appearance within the dream reflects how you see yourself.”
Steve blinked. “I…”
Tony paced the workshop restlessly, trying to drown out the persistent gnawing feeling of
Steve hesitates. “I don't have time for this.”
"Well, I wouldn’t say exactly like old times, we've gotten a lot better at not getting kicked out of every place we go to.”
“It was the first thing I could come up with,” Steve answers, miffed. He always tried to avoid creating structures and tools within dreams, but the shock of seeing Stark in danger had pushed him to react by instinct - and as it turned out, his first instinct had been to summon a shield.
"No, if we're going to tamper with this man's mind it should be through people from his own country." T’Challa said, joining her on the bed. "Besides, there’s no way I’d feel comfortable with Shuri running around inside a mind like Stark’s."
And now they were back to square one. What was it about the man that made him repeatedly lose his temper?
It didn’t even matter that he’d started with good intentions. As usual, Tony had gone ahead and steamrolled right over Steve’s wishes, been too high-handed, too overbearing, too
“Everything alright there, friend?” Of all the things that had happened this week, talking to strange men in the middle of the night whilst interviewing a college student wasn’t how Steve thought this day would turn out.
Steve muses while connecting the IV to his arm. Until now, the possibility of returning to Limbo had been his only fear.
They turn the final corner to find the access point a complete wreck.
Steve's fingers tighten on the armrest. “Wanda, hurry.”
He turns to each member of his team, trying to project a confidence he doesn’t feel. They all look various degrees of shaken and he can’t blame them - nothing in the world could have prepared them for this type of danger.
“It's not that simple,” Sam shook his head. “True inspiration is impossible to create. Besides, there are too many variables at play - you never know what kind of spin a subconscious will put on the idea. The outcome is never a sure thing.”
Steve had never thought he’d become an artist, but something about it called to him after he left the military; when he set pencil to paper it felt natural in a way those years of service never had. There was something extraordinary about the way a few lines could give beauty and meaning to a empty space. He went from a world of gunfire and tactical briefings to charcoals and watercolors. Instead of helicopters and tanks he painted cathedrals and bridges, landscapes and families.
“Since when was this a competition?” Steve embeds the shield into a robot’s chestplate, then kicks it over the balcony.
A few minutes later, the package was unwrapped, revealing a circular table. An antique.
His breath is coming fast and heavy, like he’s run a marathon. They got what they came for; getting a numerical code from the target is their success indicator for this leg of the mission, but he feels empty and vaguely sick - nothing at all like a winner. The fallen skull face grins back at him mockingly.
Steve wished he could be closer, but was no way he could get a leg up off the ground. The few feet of distance between them might as well have been light years.
“If this is a shakedown, you amateurs are doing it wrong,” Stark drawls as Steve enters. His cuffed hands tug at the bolt, trying in vain to free himself. “When Rushman gets here, get ready to be sued so hard that you'll be lucky to-”
Steve considered the money. It definitely was generous, enough to cover their problems for a decent amount of time. But…
Bucky’s comic books.
“I need action, not talk.”
Right?
Tony enjoyed when Owner threw parties with fancy food, because it meant Steve would be dressed up for the occasion. Their Owner would polish Steve till he shone, and cover him with a tablecloth. Tony’s favourite was the lacy one: the delicate white lace contrasted Steve’s rich colouring beautifully, providing teasing glimpses of gleaming wood as it shifted over his broad surface. Most beautiful of all was the way Steve bore all the weight on his sturdy back without complaint.
He gestures down at the blue combat suit he's wearing. He supposes a newbie like Wanda wouldn’t be able to tell, but the outfit is several years out of date - five, to be exact. “Your physical appearance reverts to a time in your life where you experienced a big change; something like moving house, or a loss, or...”
“What would that be?” T’Challa asked. “How would one translate a business strategy into…”
“If the world were less scummy, you boys would be out of a job.” Natasha fell into step beside them.
Steve’s jaw clenched at the mention of his old rank. “It's one thing to steal an idea from someone's mind, but to plant one there?” He gestured at the video of Stark. “You don't know what the inception could do to this man, how it could change everything about him as a person. Whatever idea we plant could grow to define who he is. You're asking me essentially to...to...”
Tony huffs a sigh and looks up, down, everywhere but at Steve. His face looks pinched, nervous, like danger of the situation is finally sinking in for him. Steve supposes that's understandable; being told they were trapped in a dream would be enough to rattle anyone.
Stark’s face twitched, and he leaned over to place the wallet on the seat beside Steve. After a short hesitation, he unfastened his wristwatch too, carelessly clapping down what must have been a fifty thousand-dollar watch on the grimy wooden bench. Stark turned away, jerkily stuffing his hands back into his pockets.
There had been an awkward moment when T’Challa and Nakia unexpectedly showed up, and Sam half-jokingly offered T’Challa a bowl of cereal. To everyone’s surprise the T’Challa had accepted his offer and was now seated on Sam’s old couch munching serenely on Froot Loops. Steve supposed they'd had stranger days.
“Stop,” A few swipes of his pen and Steve was done with the maze in ten seconds. “Not good enough. Try again.”
“Protect m-? So you're like my imaginary friend?” Stark sputters weakly, looking like he wants nothing more than a stiff drink. “Okay, then… that's new…definitely shouldn’t have stopped going to therapy…”
Stark hissed at the jostling. He fished something out of his pocket but it slipped from his unsteady fingers, falling onto the withered grass. He looked like he was going to cry, face twisting as he reached for the fallen pill box with slow, laborious movements.
The noises of construction cease. Tony looks at him sharply and Steve can see the wheels in his head turning, searching his words for some hidden trap. “What did you do?”
“We should've known a piece of shit like Hammer was gonna screw us over.” Sam said with a grimace (“Language,” said Steve). “If he spent on actual R&D instead of stealing from his competitors, his company might not be in the shitter in the first place.”
Wary of his foul mood, the others hang back but T’Challa has no such compunctions. “What’s the significance of the numbers?”
“You guys better hold on,” Scott floors the gas and their van tears away from the advancing horde.
He catches sight of Stark at the end of the hall, facing off head-to-torso against a towering projection. Stark sinks into a defensive stance as the metal creature backs him up against the wall. It raises its weapon to strike and Stark instinctively throws up an arm to shield himself.
It was that realization that made him claw his way through the fog of inertia; his memories of the real world came back to him in flashes, like watching sunlight from the bottom of the ocean. One thing had become exceedingly clear; they couldn't stay there any longer or they'd drown in madness together. Limbo wasn't real. It wasn't and couldn't ever be.
Encouraged by the praise, Tony lowered his balls once again. They grazed against Steve’s surface with a soft click - Steve gave another creak of a shudder - before starting to trail over the glossy tabletop
Suddenly it’s all too much. The directness of the question and the attention-  Steve has always tried to avoid talking about the matter, and this is too close, too personal for him to talk about with just anyone.
) had lasted 20 hours at most.
“There you go, now go back to sleep.” She pats Stark on the cheek as he slumps against the wall. She clambers to her feet, peeling off Stane’s oversized shirt from the tactical suit she’d been wearing underneath. “Bozhe moi, that took ages, I thought he’d never shut up.”
“Natasha!” Steve shouts, and the room goes quiet. “He’s not breathing.”
“One…”
Steve takes a deep breath. “We have Shuri on the outside keeping Stark stable. Right now we have no choice but to trust her to do her job. Just like we're going to do ours.”
“Did you like the surprises I got for you?” Tony blurted out.
Stark smirks. “What’s wrong? Too scared to hit a man who can't fight back? Oh wait-” He leans forward, eyes widening. “Is that your thing? Because you're supposed to negotiate the safeword
Steve aims the gun at Stark. He had no intention of shooting, of course, but Stark didn’t need to know that. “You have ten seconds to give us the code.”
“I can give you something to toot, if you'd like…” He stops himself at the look Steve gives him. “Fine,
“...I need the soldering iron,” Tony says gruffly, turning back to his contraption.
very much.
“You always have a choice.” Sam said kindly. “You don't have to do it for us, or T'Challa, or even…” He was cut off as Steve set his plate down with a clunk.
None of them mattered now, anyway. All that mattered was that he fix what he did to Bucky.
His life Before had been normal. Most of it it good, but even the bad parts had been things he could comprehend. Work, friends,
The look Natasha gives him is equal parts exasperated and pitying. “I don’t think he’s the kind of guy you save, he's the kind you stop. You saw my report: Stark’s a textbook case of narcissism.”
"Out of the question.” T’Challa shook his head firmly. “I will not have our entry into the wider world be tainted by an act of violence - We don't assassinate civilians for agendas, no matter how noble the cause.”
“What my mom always told me to: dream big,” Sam reaches into that creative place inside him, focusing on summoning a weapon, and almost immediately a rocket launcher materializes at his feet. He hauls it up in his arms, taking aim at the concrete support beams. “Ready in three… two… one…”
A distant explosion tears shatters the stillness, the sound of something heavy slamming through concrete and glass.
A sense of dread made Steve’s words catch in his throat, and he was unable to do more than stare back.
Stark hunched forward, hands resting on his knees. “Totally hypothetical here, but if you knew this year was the last birthday you were going to have, what would you do?” He pitched his voice to sound casual but there was an odd tone to it.
“Sure did. But I wasn’t expecting to see... animal wranglers waiting around to release a flock of bald eagles, the New York Philharmonic, and Sam chatting with the fire marshals about his last-minute plans to incorporate Falcon into the fireworks show. I take it you're responsible for all these surprises.” A small frown creased Steve’s face. “Tony, I told you I didn't need all this stuff.”
Watching the work take form under his hands, Steve can't help but be impressed by his skill, for Tony worked with a speed that would surely be impossible in the real world. His movements, fluid and certain, reminded him of Wanda’s magic but applied to engineering instead of buildings.
Stark was cold...so? Why should that matter? It wasn't any of Steve's business. The fact that he had spent this long talking to Stark went against every protocol of dream walking. It was a bad idea to have too much contact with a target - any residual memories could affect the construction of the dream. The proper, by-the-book, thing to do would be to focus on the mission and just let Stark go.
Steve roughly cuffs Natasha to the pipe next to Stark then leaves swiftly, slamming the door behind him. There’s a one-way mirror panel just next to the cell, where they can all observe her.
The scene is uncanny, like something out of a movie; the front carriage of a freight train is blocking the entire corridor as if a giant had picked it up and rammed it through the building. The impact had destroyed all of the light fixtures, leaving the hallway lit by flashes of red emergency lighting.
Rejecting the prospect of going back to sleep, Steve padded into the kitchen to fix a coffee. Caffeine had long stopped affecting him; an unsynchronised body clock was one of the long-term effects of being a dream walker. The mug was warm in his hands and the bitter aroma grounded him.
But T'Challa shook his head.
“Listen, I don't know what's going on, but…” Steve reached out his hands cautiously, settling them on Stark’s shoulders. “Don't waste your life thinking that. You aren't alone.”
“I wasn't thinking about the mission! I was- I was more worried that he'd do something to himself...” It was too reminiscent of what had happened with Bucky. “I couldn’t leave another pers- I couldn't just leave him like that.”
Nodding, he steps back from Tony. “Alright. Let's have a look around.”
“It's called a flash mob, they're supposed to be fun and spontaneous-” Tony explained, already starting to deflate. How could he have been so stupid? Nothing he'd planned had turned out right, and all Tony had done was confuse and inconvenience Steve...
“The team’s with me in the West Tower. Heading to the rendezvous point in the North Tower,” Sam replies.
“Change of plans. Stark just collapsed, they’re headed to the hospital as we speak.” Sam informed him, doing a final round of checks on the PASIV. “Once we get there, it’s showtime.”
Natasha dusts off her hands matter-of-factly once settle Stark in the back seat. “That's phase one down. Now we just have to get to the next point.”
Tony was unlike any of the lamps Steve had seen before.
5. As you can see, I'm playing fast and loose with Inception canon, and the next few chapters will diverge even more. Schmoopy stuff is coming...
In the distance, the silhouette of a man was stumbling across the quad. He lurched like he was about to fall, but at the last second caught himself against a tree. With one hand against the trunk, his head hung low over his chest, body hunched in on itself like he was about to throw up or pass out.
The van tears through the streets, weaving through any obstacles in their path and steamrolling a few that are. Scott’s wild driving flings the occupants of the van around; Steve hisses as a particularly sharp turn bashes the back of his head against the car roof.
“Barely saw ‘em because I couldn't even open my bedroom door.” Steve said dryly. At this proximity Tony noticed there were indeed a few stray rose petals clinging to Steve’s shoulders. “I had to climb out the window and scale the side of the building before I could get dressed.”
“I didn’t see you at my speech. Are you new here? New lecturer? You look like an art history type of guy.” Stark's bleary eyes wandered over Steve. “Has anyone told you you have the face of a Michelangelo? And the body of a...”
“I really hope nobody took pictures of me in my underthings.” Steve muttered as he smoothed down the edge of Tony’s collar.
The number of projections would increase the deeper they progressed into the dream, so they would need to play this differently. Their success metric for this level hinged on one deceptively simple task: gaining the trust of the target.
“Shitty” didn’t even begin to describe the hardships Steve had faced: from growing up in poverty in the 40s, to fighting in a war, to being thrown into the future where all his family and friends were dead, to being forced into an endless string of battles against aliens and other inter-dimensional horrors...
Still, it's not easy to restrain the struggling man, and stars flash in his vision when Stark clocks him in the jaw with a lucky punch. Grunting in pain, Steve reinforces his grip on the other man, careful to use his strength only to incapacitate instead of injure.
“Do you ever wish you had more time to do the things you wanted to?” Stark asked quietly. His mood from earlier had returned.
He was also very tactile; Stark talked with his hands, frequently touching Steve on the shoulder or arm to emphasise some point or other. Talking seemed to have a positive effect and at least he was less teary than before. It was hard to get a word in edgewise; the most Steve could was do nod, comment occasionally, or make sounds at the right places. Stark didn’t seem to mind, and Steve found he didn't mind the chatter either.
Nakia smiled. "You don’t think Shuri could handle a few projections?”
“You're the boss.” Tony sketches a lazy salute. Then, under his breath. “Captain Uptight.”
The pause stretches out between them, long and uncomfortable.
Tony shoves his arm into Steve’s face without so much as a warning. “Check it out! What do you think?” Strapped to his forearm is a sleek gauntlet painted red and gold (how had he found time for
At a cursory glance, it appears to be a perfect replica of the city. On closer inspection, buildings from every culture and country, new and old, are scattered amid the endless rows of skyscrapers; scarlet torii gates, Gothic cathedrals, domes studded by solar panels and terraces walled with lush greenery.
The man slung Stark’s arm over a broad shoulder like he’d done it hundreds of times before, giving Steve a brusque nod as he half-walked, half-carried his boss to the car. In a few seconds the car was gone, leaving Steve standing alone in the empty driveway.
“I've got this,” With a twist of his wings, Sam flips around midair, shooting backwards and towards the armored cars. But instead of charging them head on, he veers to the side, diving under the freeway in a wide arc to land nimbly on the riverbank.
