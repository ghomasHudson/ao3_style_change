“Um, sure?” Tony answered, not wanting to piss off a nymph.
Steve stood on the door way.  “You need to eat, Tony – “
“You think I'm not?  Why did Fury call us and why now?  Why not before?  What isn't he telling us?  I can't do the equation unless I have all the variables.”
“They’re not mutually exclusive.  And idealism is not mutually exclusive with delusion.”
Bruce tilted his head, listening to whatever his daughter had to say, before stating, “Yeah, apparently our kids will grow up like cousins.”
, but still.”  Steve ran a hand through his hair.  “I don’t know if I want to bother getting married.”
Quickly growing bored of the upstairs rooms, Tony decided to scope out the rest of the buildings.  He took the back stairs down, leading him into a cramped hallway, next to a small kitchen.  Several cooks were preparing dinner by the sound of it.
“Steely Dan’s Can’t Buy a Thrill.  1972, but didn’t get very widespread until ’73.  First studio album, and rally the only one you need to listen to all the way through to get their feel.  Though, I need to get you to listen to ‘Peg’, for obvious reasons, and ‘Rikki Don’t Lose That Number’ should never be missed.  Well, do you wanna - ?”
He ran for Times Square, because people would be there.  Had they won the war?  It was so loud.  Ma had always said when the Great War was over, people had convened there.
Steve doesn’t want to hear any more.
The lavender door at the end of the hall opened.  “Sweetheart?”  It was odd to hear the term of endearment in Barton’s normally gruff voice.  “I can’t find the Monster Spray.”
She sounded way too innocent for a woman who was killing people as they talked about Steve’s feelings.
The door was opening; he could see the suit-
“So, what do I need to know about you?” Tony asked after he had situated himself on the floor of the kitchen with a glass of Jarvis’s old hangover “cure”.
Stern smiled, like he had his ace in the hole.  “Tony Stark is unstable, volatile.  He thinks that because he can create something, it is his sole weapon to control.  He refuses to corporate.”
“Yeah, big man in a suit of armor.  Take that off, what are you?”
Steve takes a lot longer to recover than one might assume.  He lays, sprawled across Tony, breathing harshly, inhaling deeply, like he’s savoring the scent of their coupling, like he needs that proof of another body next to him.
Steve ran a hand through his hair.  “I don’t know.  Just . . . help.”
“I’ve had MREs better than this shit,” Clint muttered, looking at Steve for permission before nabbing his slice.  Natasha sighed and gave him a look.
“But cracking down now will stop them from doing it in the future.”
EMTs are setting up nearby, so they’re swamped for a while, still scanning the wreckage for hot spots and getting the wounded over to the triage center. They’re lucky today.  Several have critical injuries, but nothing that is impossible to treat or will leave them with permanent damage.  Most are scraped up and a little bruised, with mild smoke inhalation.  No one here is going to die today.
Steve is still standing there, staring, oblivious to the henchmen squealing like mice everywhere.  "Tony?"  He sounds terrified.  Steve isn't usually terrified of huge beasts.  Why is he scared of Tony?
As he looked up, discerning artist’s eye mixing with childish wonderment mixed with nostalgia, Tony had to catch his breath at the man he, um, liked.  Slept with.  Cuddled and did relationshipy things with.
“Well, then clearly you knew my dad better than I did.”
Tony being love with him as Steve was in love with him.  And neither of them had known.
“That's just the prototype.  I'm kind of the only name in clean energy right now.”
Steve’s always horny.
Steve doesn’t say anything for a while.  Dead air hangs between them, miles and miles that Tony doesn’t exactly know, but he seems to feel every single one of them.
“Can we do that again?” he calls, and he feels Dikost’s eagerness. Tony has his legs hooked around the wing joints, and he feels them pull in as Dikost torpedoes back into the blanket of clouds.
Great.
Heyy, 10 chapters down, only a million more to go.  I hope y’all are enjoying it so far ‘cause I’m only getting started.  Next chapter will have some action! (and if you do like this, could you like, tell me, because I am sad and comments make me feel 100x better)
He just looked so
Tony had spent a while now getting used to the room, exploring the contents, and trying out the mattress (it would do nicely).  But as always, he was itching for something to do.
“Trading cards?”
Steve griped Tony’s jaw again, and angled him for eye contact, and oh, how he like the way Tony’s bones shifted under his fingers and his Adam’s Apple rolled along his palm.
Steve clenches his hands more. “Bullshit,” he says, and his voice cracks. His face is wet, and the salt from his tears makes his eyes itch. But he can’t wipe his face, not yet.
“What’s it called?” Steve asked, moving back towards his tablet, dragging a clinging Tony along with him.

"What about my parents?  Where are they?"
EDIT 24.5.16: Any views expressed by Steven Rogers on ADHD are not mine nor supported by me.
“I like the way you think.”
“Not at all.”
He starts to call the man he met “Stark”, and the person beneath all the layers “Tony”.
He looked up from the three data screens he was trying to read at once and muttered distractedly, “Yeah.”
Zoloto growls her laughter.
Steve shrugs, then crosses his arms in the way that Tony loves, the one where the sleeves of his tee shirt look ready to shred. “We have no idea.  We
The case they gave him was filled with junk.  Notebooks and files, old film he put on the ancient projector, a first edition Captain America comic he thought about putting up for auction for half a second until Peter complained loudly.  He paged through a notebook while idly watching his father get gradually more inebriated on film.
Barton goes out and buys the most expensive commercially available yacht the next day, and returns it after seeing the card is approved.  Tony gives him a limit after that, but mainly because he wants to be a dick.
Steve breathed deeply, like he was bracing himself for something.  “Do you know why I like it so much?”
They had slept together.  Well, had sex then fallen asleep together, and Tony didn’t know what was worse, that he managed to get Steve to sleep with him, or that he gotten Steve to
There was something . . .
Oh well.
“You’re – an Alastor?”
The media didn’t know that.
“Honestly?  I don’t know.  I didn’t do it to hurt you.  I guess I wanted to protect you from it.  And I didn’t want you to hate me.”
They stare at each other for a long moment.
“I do, too!” Clint spit abound a rib.
Steve nods wordlessly.
Tony pauses.
There was heady combination of both victorious expectation and skin-stripping nervousness heating the thick air between them.  It was caramelizing again, but this time there was no longing, no bitter feeling that comes with being denied something that sings your bones and turns your insides rancid.
But Steve was still an Athenian by birth, and the hero of the most recent war, so his image littered the palace and the city.  Howard’s favorite drinking cup depicted Steve, and a fresco of him stood in pride of place in the throne room.
A shadow crossed Steve’s face. “Right.”
“Really, honey?  I’m
rolling through him.  Tony didn’t stop talking.
Steve looks a little off put that Tony was able to sneak up on him, but he shrugs his shoulders cautiously.  “Wanted to see the Adirondacks.  Heard a lot about them.”
“Tony!  You’re not
The Alps were still freezing as they waited for Zola’s train to approach.
, which was a stormy grey.
As time passed, the course of the war was revealed in enthusiastic drunken conversation.  The barbarians had somehow tamed a breed of hydra and had sicced them on the hoplites, rendering any modern tactics useless.  They had weltered for six years, campaigning indefinitely.  The only success they found was Carol rampaging on the field of battle by herself, like the heroes of old.
He opens his eyes slowly.
Steve smiled, like dawn sun in the evening twilight.  “Good.  Let’s honor the gods,
“Just – don’t like ice.”
“I’m sorry, Tony,” he whispers, voice raw yet light as silk.
“What held you?” Tim, who was holding his racing suit and boots, asked.
“Is it?” Steve’s tone is hard to discern, like he desperately wants to beg Tony to stay, but won’t.
But Steve does have a gift for being the best at
Tony nods.
The fresco depicted the most famous scene from the Hydric War – Steve’s defeat of the Schmidtican Hydra.  People said it captured perfectly Steve’s resistance to give in, as well as his peculiar fighting style – distinctive shield held out like it was the weapon, not the sword or spear.
“Not when your nomenclature is bullsh-“
“About ten minutes.” Tony winces.
As Tony approached the shed to get a better look, a voice called out “If you’re here to steal her poppy pods, realize she has given me permission to shoot you.”
He had reverted back to Steve, but the cruel, flat blackness in their eyes was never forgotten.
It was the sailors, more than anything, which were the most tiring, with their incessant chatter and loud snores and awful hygiene.  They let their beards and hair grow slovenly and ragged, and did not oil their hair or skin.  And it wasn’t as though Tony could avoid them forever.  With the close quarters on the trireme, they were always right there.
And there he stood: Iron Man.  In the buffed and glinting armor, an injured eighteen-year-old, in both body and spirit.
?” Steve sounded intensely curious.  “They tore down the Union Terminal in DC.”
“I’ll get it together, I just . . . .  Can’t I be excited?”
“Somethin’s eatin’ you, man,” Rhodey huffs from where he’s lying on his back, doing his leg lift exercises.  Tony is sitting near his head, acting as his spotter.  There’s a physiotherapy specialist that comes to the compound every morning for two hours, the best Tony could find in the country, but Rhodey is insistent that he keeps working at it even after Carmen leaves.  So Tony helps Rhodey totter around the gym area that has only just been fixed after Clint and Vision were squabbling over Wanda.  The dull hum of a cement mixer comes through the air from beyond several layers of plastic sheeting.  Low-impact water exercises could help re-gain mobility without putting unnecessary pressure on the lower body, so Tony ordered a series of pools to be put in.  He’s been watching videos about water aerobics.
He nodded miserably. “But.” Steve’s voice was impossibly small.
“Stay with Stark!”  the guy in the front said before kicking open the door.
and sending his memories scattering to the wind.  Several of the sailors chortled.
It was odd, the feeling of ninety plus years of sexual frustration sloughing off in less than twelve hours, but it a pleasant odd feeling.  Though Steve preferred the snuggling afterwards.
Fair warning: there are some discussions relating to slavery, particularly sexual slavery, in this chapter, and will be in the rest of the fic.  It was a deeply entrenched part of Greek society, though different from what our modern assumptions of what slavery might be, and I’m not going to gloss over it.  Note that I’m altering characters and their attitudes to fit the era, so don’t . . . assume that I think they would share these attitudes in modern canon, mmkay?
“No problem, Thor.  We’re very happy to be here,” Steve said as he maintained a vice-like grip on Tony, who was trying very hard to escape.
“Nooo, this is the part where we have sweaty, love-affirming sex.”  He yawned again.
“Nah, I’ll just be surprised,” Bruce smiled good-naturedly.  He glanced back at the lab table, and seeing the spread on equipment seemed to realize what the new step was.  “Well, I’ve done all I can for you two.  Tony, you know how to implant them in the arto-utero?  Good, well, congratulations!” and he quickly made his escape, unbuttoned lab coat snapping with the sudden movement.
She curls her undulating body and beckons with a claw. Dragotsennyy moves to sit with her, letting his head fall back to rest against her scaly belly.
Tony was fairly certain bracers would not become part of the usual hoplite kit, but hopefully they would protect him from getting his hand lopped off.
“Steeeeve,” Tony whined, “s’not
constantly in motion, and seeing him still was unnatural as blue hair.
“You – you – “ Tony babbled as Steve languidly pumped is index finger in and out of Tony’s ass.  “More.  Fuck you,
The carefully, if poorly, constructed illusion crumpled when he threw the men against the wall.  The sheetrock crumbled out, revealing . . . a soundstage?  Cleaner than the ones he had filmed war propaganda on.  Or was it a hangar?
“I love you, and I don’t know if you feel exactly the same, but damint Steve, we could be
There’s no official birth date, but David was left at the orphanage as a newborn on the day he has always been told he was born, and had looked to be approximately a few hours old. The initial check-up said he was healthy and had a lusty cry.  The mother had decided to remain anonymous, but had insisted on the name he had been given.
“Just a second.” He pulled the plug from the wall socket and buttoned his shirt over the chest plate, folding the paper with the headline ‘JACK FROST STRIKES AGAIN’ away. His hands shook as he unlocked the dead bolt. “Fuck, I’m tired. Something going – oh
Ilya is also Podatlivyy.
The thing about armor was that, once a battle was over, all it was useful for was working up a good sweat.
“Yeah, I get you.” Tony shifts in his chair.
Really, why was it so wrong for him to be with Tony?  Because he was older?  Well, Steve was never going to have a relationship that lasted more than a couple years if he stuck to his peers.  There was a decent age difference between them, but then there was a decent age difference between him and everyone he knew except Peggy.
Steve is desperate, his eyes searing and searching. Trying to make Tony understand.
Of course, he's also naked.
.  Tony had appreciated the view enough from behind, but up front . . . well, Tony felt he should thank someone.  Anyone.  Everyone.  Men he knew spent hours and days working on their physiques would cry and curse the gods if they saw how perfectly sculpted this man was.  He was like a heroic statue, with all the blemishes ignored.  He was neatly groomed, hair shorter that Tony was used to seeing and a full, even beard a darker shade of golden brown than the hair up top.  Minimal body hair, enough to denote adulthood but not so much as it was disgusting.  The only thing that did not conform with traditional beauty was the massive member hanging between this muscular thighs, but with a rush of heat, Tony wondered how much he should consider what others thought beautiful.
“Nah, I think it’s time you took the heat for your actions!” (Say what you will, but the puns were half the fun of being a superhero.)   Tony triggered the tiny device he’s crafted, a miniature furnace, and threw it toward Shapanka’s feet. Ripples of heat spread out from the device, causing the metal of the armor to superheat and Shapanka to crumple.
Jane’s eyes glinted, more mad scientist than anyone had ever met.  “You will
“At ease, soldier!” a voice shouted from behind him.
Tony groaned, rolled over, and buried his face in a pillow.  “Go away.”
he thinks,
Thankfully, dragons aren’t really “magical”. Some of them have an innate talent for it, but it isn’t something that all of them are skilled at or are required to want to pursue.  Zoloto does not push him when he says he has no love for magic.
“The Golden Age of Man,” Tony intoned vaguely, selecting an olive.  “It always fascinated me.  The idea that there once was a time where mortals frolicked around all day.  No war, no famine.  We were just
“Steve – “
There was a sudden commotion, with people running to tie down jets and flue barrels.
They were doing final checks on his racer. Sleek lines, of course, because Tony designed this car himself. “She’s purrin’ like a Persian cat, boss! The Stark Special is ready for action!”
Thor rumbled in agreement.  “I have savored and enjoyed many Midgardian cuisines with great delight.  This,” he gestured with limp fry, “is not one of those times.”
Tony gestures jerkingly at the formation on the sideboard.  “Iron pyrite.  Fool’s gold.  Used to be mistaken for real gold.  It’s soft and brittle, but under close scrutiny it’s worthless.”
“Oh?  I spoke too soon.”
“Sadly, nothing interesting. He’s been locked up in his house most of the time. Iron Man’s been a bit more concerned with this whole Jack Frost business.”
Steve turns around. “What?”
“The Stark Tower?  That big ugly-“ Tony looked, daring him. “-building in New York?”
Steve just wrinkles his nose and says
“C’mon, Tony, talk to me.  What’s been eating you?  We got you.”
Tony was buoyed by that thought as they carted the inebriated Sam and Clint into the van (Nat had hollow legs, she wasn’t even
He knew something was wrong the moment he walked in, and heard Tony grunt as he white-knuckled his sheets.  Steve put the tray down on a dresser, and rushed to Tony’s bedside.
He was about to ask if anyone had seen him, but his phone buzzed with a message from Steve.  “Right outside the door, there’s a thing that looks like a water fountain.”
He wrinkles his nose at the dampness of the blanket mound, but still wiggles deeper inside. The scent of dark roast is slowly leaching into the air, another layer to the comfort that the blankets and Steve’s presence gives.
“Then you should be out.  Celebrating.  Seeing the world.”
“Come now, we must honor the terms of our gamble,” Thor berated him.
Tony would guess it was more in line with a
But, between safety and adventure? Tony will always choose adventure.
Tony was still trying to process the enormity of what little he knew of what this island held for him as they sailed into the harbor, such as it was.  A few rickety planks roped and nailed together to form a series of piers.
He picks at the chocolate, then munches the dry, crumbing granola bars. He is gathering the packaging together when he feels the prickle of eyes on him.
He jolted harshly when he recalled the moan Tony had issued earlier, a burst of precome coming suddenly.  He tasted a taste of metal.  The metal of bullet casings, the metallic taste of blood.  Copper.  No, iron.  Always iron.  Iron.
despicable
Something changed in the air, like Steve’s hand was hovering next to his face, and only by sheer force of will he kept himself still and heart rate down.
“So you saw.  Okay, so, not like this place is beautiful, but like, what are we doing here?”
But while he will hold himself accountable, which is more than many people would do, he doesn’t want to face all of what drove him
“This will be our first sort of vacation together.  Do you know what couples are supposed to do on vacation?” Tony grinned salaciously as he trailed his hands towards Steve’s belt buckle.
Steve turned to Tony.  “I’m sorry.”
“I managed to attain flight without you."
There weren’t many people in the cafeteria.  There were a small group of people in scrubs gossiping and picking at their packed lunches. Over by the exit, three middle-aged men and a middle-aged woman were talking in muted voices as one man tried to wrestle with a sniffing toddler.  They were going over some paperwork, their expressions pinched.  An old man was sitting at the head of the table, eyes unseeing as he fussed idly with his wedding band where his hands were folded around a coffee cup.  As Steve watched, the man shook his head and cut his children off.  “Just pull it.  She’d rather go with dignity.”
He regretted it as soon as he did it.  He checked the couch over for any damage.  There wasn’t any, and he breathed a sigh of relief.   Until he remembered why he had flipped it.
just as jets of water begin arching through the air.
He reached down and pinched his thigh.  There was no use getting it into his head that his father might actually be a god.  There were plenty of heroes who were only grandchildren.  Howard’s grandfather was Hermes.  Anyways, there were also plenty of heroes without significant godly blood that were still for whatever reasons blessed and favored.  Favor is what mattered with the gods, not blood.  This way of thinking would only disappoint and destroy him.
“I’ll take that into consideration, Mufasa.”
“Where are you
“So why didn't SHIELD bring him in on the Tesseract project?  I mean, what are they doing in the energy business in the first place?”
“Location?”
Nodding numbly, Steve headed back towards the elevator, with the strains of “Why Can’t This Be Love?” trying to shatter the glass behind him.
Clint nodded.  “Now, we have MREs, or Meals Ready to Eat.  You add water and heat them up, they’re not bad.  Better than the old ones.”
“That was the plan.”
“Are you
and handed him a leather thong which he knotted as a belt, pulling the excess fabric up, so the bottom hung around his knees.
Steve bit his lip.  “Do you have a voice?”
“<Do they ever come down?>”
“Told you it was my song!”
Not very likely.
“Well, what would be learning today?” Steve asked apprehensively.
hung unsaid. “But you just met the guy. He seems like good people, but how can you

“Tony – “
together.  I would suggest you take advantage of that while you can.”
“Still, I must send some to my lovely Jane!  I would appreciate seeing her in my colors!  Lady Pepper, when may I order some?” and Pepper had to explain that they would probably give Thor as many as he wanted.  Thor then busied himself with making a list of all the people in his life that he should send the polish to.  Apparently, Jane, Darcy, Selvig, and some lady who ran a café in New Mexico would be set for life.
Steve turned back to glare at Tony, hard line held between his eyebrows.  When Tony swallowed nervously, the serious face crumbled, and Steve was laughing at him.  Tony just stared at him in confusion for a moment.  “Not many people do,” Steve chuckled, dabbing at the moisture in his eyes.  “I would wear a diadem, but those tend to get sweaty.  Peggy told me you had a bit of a mouth on you, so I shouldn’t be surprised.  Don’t worry about it,” he clapped a hand to Tony’s back, nearly sending him sprawling into the dirt.  “A sharp tongue gets you farther these days than a sharp sword.  How about we start again?  I call you Tony, you call me Steve, alright?”
His voice is impossibly small when he asks the final question.  The once that dug inside his own brain and has been gnawing away.
Steve slept through the rest of the movie as Houston was able to squeeze the last few Amps out of the batteries and get the astronauts home.  Steve jolted a bit at the blast of noise that came with Odyssey’s safe arrival, but showed signs of drifting off again, so Tony had JARVIS cut the movie off.
“Gimmie
“So you're saying that the Hulk, the other guy, saved my life?  That's nice.  It's a nice sentiment.  Save it for what?”
“Close it.”
“Good.  You’re back.”  Clint was sitting on the ledge of the landing platform, feet dangling over the faintly buzzing city.  There was a nearly empty bowl of popcorn next to him and a sling shot in his hand.  Every time he came across an unpopped kernel, he loaded it and launched it into the night.
He was careful about the toys after that.
“Stark, these things are still coming!”
She blinked at him, then when back to writing. “That it?”
continent?” Steve raised an eyebrow. “You have one in Antarctica?”
“What.”  It wasn’t a question.
“Father, please,” Thor said tiredly.
“I’ve only met one person who would even qualify. And that was only for a few minutes.” He shifted and looked behind him. “Can we drop this for right now? I need to sort myself out.”
He glances down. His lap is full of wire, half-stripped so he can see the copper glinting beneath the plastic covering.  At his feet, there are boxes of nails, jars assorted bolts and screws, none of them sorted by size.  Manual tools and assorted drill bits, placed with their cases open.  Larger pieces of machinery, things lifted from the bowels of assorted vehicles and other places.  Computers and phones and tablets are piled around, filling in the cracks.
It was killing him to not have Tony laughing and joking right there with him.
Strangely, or not so strangely, Steve is the one to call first.
, a glittery black, was included in both of their packages.  Clint’s other colors were
“A hero, like you?  You're a laboratory experiment, Rogers.  Everything special about you came out of a bottle.”
Tony and Pepper went together like sodium and chlorine.  Both individually explosive, but when combined benign.  You could overlook the way they stifled one another because of how good it had tasted for only so long.
He most defiantly didn’t think about the red vibrator a foot from his right ear.
“Grow a spine, JARVIS.  I got a date.”
But Steve doesn’t react the way Tony expects him too.
Yeah, that's not a proper symposium.  I'll get to that later.  As I keep saying "Tony-boy, you ain't in Athens anymore."
“Boys, please.”  Natasha didn’t need to ask twice.
Cloth rustled, like Steve was balancing his phone between his shoulder and his cheek, and there was a faint cooing/gurgling in the foreground, the murmur of voices in the background.
The men continued to follow him.  He knocked over one that ran at him.

“Ma’am.”
She sighed.  “Hardly a hetaera.  Just a lowly
The man reached in, bending the wheel back like the steering column was made of cardboard. He wrapped his hands under Tony’s armpits and hauled him out of his seat like a child, swiftly but gently rolling him to the ground, patting the smoldering patches on his jumpsuit.
“That’s
Unceasing dread filled Steve.  Could Tony have tried to . . . ?
Tony snorts at Rhodey’s raised eyebrows.  “It’s not bumming.  C’mon.  I need you, buddy.  I need a left hand that I can rely on.  And you’re the only person I can trust to be that hand.”
Steve let out a broken laugh out of nowhere. “What’s funny?”
“Of course.  Family.”  She smiled pityingly.
“Captain Rogers!  Wait!” the strange woman called after him.
“Coffee, too,” Tony says meekly.
Hospitality must be something all normal people had learned at a very young age, Tony theorized as he tried to keep Laura in his sight over the mountain of sheets, pillows, blankets, and comforters she had  shoved in his arms.  (“The second guest room gets a bit drafty in the mornings, especially this time of year,” she’d apologized while stuffing them full of homemade food that Tony would swear that he could taste the love in.)  He remembered visiting Rhodey’s house for Thanksgiving after his parents had been killed, and being shocked by the difference in atmosphere.  Roberta had fussed over him and forced him to take forth helpings at dinner.  She’s lovingly made up the room next to Rhodey’s with knitted afghans and hand sewn quilts.
He tries to cover his mouth and nose, but blast of the gas that the creature breathes hits him, and he crumples to the snow.
“Can you take us there?”
Tony is quiet for a moment, contemplating. There goes the vague hope he'd entertained of being united with his birth parents.  It was a wild dream, but he’s had those before.  But
Steve grips the ridge of Tony’s spine, and he spreads his wings. The evening air is cool, and whispers along his scales.  Effortlessly, they alight to the air.
"I'll do what I can to keep in touch," he broadcasts through the speakers.
“Just go with it,” Clint had mouthed over the top of the son’s head as he showed him the A+ spelling tests he has missed.
“Now.”
“You – you run naked around your island,” Tony stuttered.
Steve just seems sad and a little wistful.  "You always say that."
“Forget it.”  He grabbed his emergency bag and kicked open the door.
In his head, he knew Tony
“Now we’re talkin’,” Rhodey growled, threw the van into gear, and took a long draw from his violently pink slushie.
they sing-songed in harmony.
“I suppose not,” Steve rolled his eyes before answering with a wicked grin of his own.  “Why don’t you show me?”
Steve managed a hollow laugh, and went to fetch the tray.
At least here, he can pretend.
“Glad to have you back, Shellhead,” Steve murmurs lowly in his ear, and an all-too familiar heat pools deep in his gut. He does his best to ignore it, and hugs Steve back tightly.
Steve stifled his slightly-manic grin. “It’s nothing. Stupid. I’m being ridiculous. Been riding high on adrenaline or something the past few days. Forgive me.”
something about this . . . thing between you two?”
“And this is where we part,” Thor interrupted with a smile.  “If I do not get to spend any time with you later, I wish you the best.  And thank you, for being here.”
"So I'm the bad person?"
shouldn’t we?”
“I wonder what Thor hasn’t been telling us,” Natasha said thoughtfully.  “According to Thor, Loki’s been in prison since they were teenagers.  Does a guy who’s been in jail for as long as he has really warrant such a close guard?”
Possibly the oddest sight was that of a man, perfectly built, running nude along the bottom of the ragged cliffs, powerful legs moving through knee-deep water.  As they outstripped him, the man waved.
Steve still looked dubious, but shook it off, curling in on himself and cradling his head in his hands. Tony took a blanket from one of the helpers and shooed them away. He carefully draped it over Steve’s shoulders. “Thank you for going out there to stall him. It gave me and Iron Man just enough time to trade places.”
Later, when Tony’s panting and Steve’s got three fingers in his ass, and Tony’s doing as he always does, closing his eyes and burying his face in the pillow, Steve stops.  Tony whimpers, looks up to see those too-blue eyes staring defiantly at him.
With an almighty crash, the Stark Special snapped the guardrail and spiraled, skidding on its nose for a few meters before landing in a twisted pile with a groan. Additional pain ratcheted through him as the steering column rammed into the chest plate. He tore off his restraining harness, but to no use. The sides of the vehicle were crushed, the wheel bent and pinning his torso to the seat.
“Who is she?” he had whined.
“I love you,” falls from his mouth like it’s nothing and everything at the same time.
“Steve, they’re not just saying it about me, they’re saying this shit about
Standing at the front gates of the palace, Tony took in the layout of the town of Korkyra.  A peninsula shot off from the main body of the island, with land roughly curving to the south.  The large lagoon made a natural harbor, with a tiny bottleneck that was perfect for defense.  Two tiny islands sat near the mouth of the lagoon, and a network of docks and ship-sheds dotted its eastern shore.  The boat Tony had arrived on had left, but there were a couple of other trader’s ships, numerous small fishing boats, as well as Korkyra’s small navy in dry docks.  On the northern side of the peninsula, a sandy beach was littered with more fishing boats.  The town proper, if it really could be called that, was located in the middle of the peninsula.  What had looked like nothing more than residential houses yesterday looked more like a small town from his new vantage point, abet one with no city walls.  An acropolis formed at the very tip of the peninsula on a rocky outcrop at the mouth of the lagoon, which housed a few small temples and some frankly sad-looking fortifications.  The palace was located due north of the lagoon.  The front gates opened toward the east, and the exercise yard opened to the western interior of the island.
“Well, he’s got a pretty tight leash on him,” Steve conceded finally with a grimace.  “Let’s just hope Jane doesn’t have a bunch of candles at the reception, and some of us should probably try and stay sober enough that if anything breaks out – “
In his usual grumbling way, Happy spent the entire ride from Penn Station quietly bemoaning the dressing down Pepper was going to give him when they returned, because apparently she blamed him for Tony crashing and going MIA for an hour. She was also likely to be upset that Tony had just hired Steve without consulting her, but Tony wasn’t too worried about that. Steve had already won over Happy, which was a pretty awesome feat. Happy had sort of considered himself Tony’s bodyguard in a way, but as soon as Tony had mentioned Happy had once been a professional boxer, Steve had eagerly started asking about his record. He’d been vaguely self-conscious over his history of losses, but Steve had made an approving noise when Happy said it was because of the lack of desire to finish anyone off. Happy had started grilling Steve for his favorite boxers, but Steve had laughed uncomfortably, citing he was very out of date.
“Like . . . monsters?”
He knew that Steve wasn’t going to let this rest. He was smart, far smarter than some might give him credit for. Happy didn’t suspect a thing, and Pepper was happy enough playing ignorant, but Steve would never let it lie and take Tony’s bullshit excuses. He would try and get to the bottom of this, and as long as Tony wanted to keep his secrets, he would have to keep himself from making any more mistakes. But in his gut, Tony knew: Steve would figure it out, someday, one way or another. It was only a matter of time.
“Are you nuts?”
It was unreal, being this affected by another person. But then, Steve wasn’t just any other person.
I was right.  But it’s been difficult getting you here.  Unlike everyone else, getting you here was more than just asking you.  I’ve had to deal with Howard.  I’ve offered many times to have you come here to mentor with me; at least, that was what I told him.  But his response was always an offer of him hosting me if I came back to Athens.  Howard is many things, but an idiot is not one of them, and I would not be able to pull the wool over his eyes if I was there.  He’d never approve of you becoming an Alastor, but it’s your
“Eh, we lace everything with it.  Bread and cakes, the kykeon we had for lunch.  And of course cheese and yogurt.  You’ll graduate from malnourished city slicker to strong country bumpkin in no time.”
“Wellll, this has been fun, but I gotta go stock up on my arrows for the trip,”  Clint said an hour later, jumping off the counter.  He cut around to grab a bottle of water from the fridge.  When the others turned away, he crept up behind Steve and hissed, “Have
“It’s great, Tony.”  There’s a smile on Steve’s face, one that Tony knows well.  All calcium and whiteness.  No warmth.  Tense at the corners of the mouth, cold sad eyes that asses the minimalistic room.
Steve and Agent Romanoff took a more leisurely pace as he took in the modern jets and pilots.
Zoloto stands, sighing.
“No.”
It was late afternoon when they got back, the yard decked out in overly tacky red, white, and blue.  There were streamers, and balloons, and those horrible foil centerpieces on top of the red table cloths.  The party already looked to be in full swing.
There was blinding light, someone was shouting outside.  Pain beyond anything he had ever experienced, his cells were on fire, he wasn’t going to make it.  He was screaming.  Someone else was screaming, too.
he wondered.
Tony sprinted across the deck boards and over to where Steve was leisurely hiking up a hill, at a relaxed pace but somehow taking more ground then Tony running. Steve turned for a moment, caught sight of Tony tripping and stumbling in his himation, and smirked as he sped up.
Tony filed
The tiny “
He buried his face in his hands.  “What am I going to do?”
“No offense taken.”
“That’s Tony,” he responded, wistful.  “Maybe we can get him one of those stupid Iron Man body pillows.”
And the people were bored.
“You don’t want to marry me because you like to have sex with me?”
“You look taller.”
The Ominmax show was starting in a few minutes, so a bunch of people were milling around, but Tony was able to duck past them and the doors leading back to the terminal offices.  Amtrak was covered by the TSA, so the door should have been locked when no trains were incoming, but when he tried the door, found it unlocked.  Shaking his head, he stepped in, closing the door quietly behind him.  The thick wood and glass muffled the noise outside, making the echoy nature of the room all that more prominent.
She smiled indulgently.  “Not gonna be that subtle.”
Rhodey rolls his eyes.  “Man, you’re supposed to be assembling a new team, not following me around like a duckling.”
an Alastor?  Not that I don’t think you’re physically capable or anything –“
“Well, isn’t that nice.  He gets a reprieve from the guilt.  Where’s mine?  Where’s yours?  Or do you have any guilt, Rogers?”
One week when it was going to be particularly slow, Pepper bought a new bathing suit with her company checking account and took a spontaneous trip to the Bahamas (also on the company checking account). She came back the color of a boiled lobster. Happy and Tony snuck into his office to have a quick laugh while Steve stayed with her, giving her tips on how best to treat the sunburn. (“My family is immigrant Irish, and we couldn’t afford most medicines, so my mother was quite skilled in home remedies. So yeah, I know a bit about treatment for a sunburn.”) He told her to soak in milk to soothe the heat and scrounged up a bottle of lavender oil to ease the pain. A few days after her return, he brought her a few tiny aloe vera plants, “for future use”.
Tony tangled their fingers together.  “Sounds like a plan.”
Steve relents. “Iron Man, if you can, disable the electric fences while you’re in there.”
As for him
“Birds?”
Tony put the record on, then began to move to the smooth guitar riff that oozed from the speakers.  The dance was slightly ridiculous, thrusting his hips and leaping about.  It was uniquely Tony, slightly idiotic, untamed, well thought out, and undeniably erotic.
Steve just shrugged, eyes sparkling.  “We’ve got a lot to celebrate.”
Natasha turns out to be the biggest spender, but it’s mainly for appearances.  Tony discovers that she bitches
“Could tell by the thunder-and-lightning shtick.”
“Morning.”  His final seconds before his universe crumbles, and he
“Mmmm?”
Tony shock his head minutely.  “Cherry,” Nat requested.
“Yes, but they would like your personal seal approval, all of you, before it goes to market.”
He can picture Steve down to the tiniest detail, from the two moles at the nape of his neck and the wispy straw-colored hair that covers them, to the small chip in his lower left premolar that the serum couldn't fix.  He knows pretty much everything there is to know about Steve's appearance.
“So.” She crosses her arms and attempts to stand tall and imposing, but that really doesn’t work very well on him while he’s in the armor.  “Where have you been?”
He ran a finger over the words on the back of the coin. It was a prayer, but it resonated with him. He imagines his mother whispering it in his ear as she coached him in his bedtime prayers, soft and smoky, with a hint of an accent.
His amulet flared with heat once again.
Steve hung his head against the tiled wall, water from the shower washing away all traces of orgasm.
” Steve hissed into his shoulder.
He groaned internally.  If only he had taken up the offer of a horse, he would have been back in Athens by now.
“Blue,” Steve rumbled from deep in his chest.
“I need to find my reason.”
“Well, thank you,” he says awkwardly.  Painfully.  But leaving in painful and staying is painful.  He can’t breathe.  “It was good to – “ he waves his hand as he fumbles for a word.
me understand.”
He had to admit Rogers didn’t.  He was smiling, and looked touched.   “I’ll make sure to check it out.”
“Just – can I have a moment?”
Barton walked in from the bathroom.  “I can,” he said, determined glare on his face.
One particularly large wave leapt onto the rock and seemed to slap playfully at Tony’s leg.
“My, my, Captain, I having seen you this flustered since I first had you naked in my bed.  Anyway, why should straight couples get all the fun?” Tony said with a lascivious smirk, picking up a plastic specimen cup – for
He would swear on his mother’s grave that he could hear Pepper purse her lips.
“Father, Athenians, I have been to Sparta, where I challenged the vicious Velkhanos, who called upon the gods to decimate our great city, and won.  I bring you his head -” Tony pulled the leather pouch from his belt, opening and gripping the shaggy hair and pulling it out with a flourish to a chorus of ‘ooh’s.  The stump of the neck was still damp and crusty from the heat, and there were plump maggots squirming in the eye sockets.  “- as proof of my victory.”
, this isn’t a real person, or if it is, it’s certainly not this guy.
He has their support, he reminds himself. They care. They don’t want him to relapse. They are so proud that he has quit the habit. If he needs help, he can call on them.
“Love you,” Tony felt his lips tumble over.
Everyone was giving him the
Steve had been disappointed, but ever since the breakout of the war, he had understood.  If he was finally able to join the Army like they said he would, it would be a least a few years in Europe.  Then maybe when the Nazis were beaten, he could return home looking for his future wife.
Dinner the previous night had been out of the ordinary.  Normally, meals were served communally to the entire royal household, men and women together, usually in either the main hall or the kitchen yard when the weather was nice.  There were a few tables scattered around, bearing baskets and platters.  People sat on chairs or the swept stones, bowls on their knees.  Many people wandered about socializing, grazing as they went.  Tony sat on one of the low stone walls, observing, Bruce quietly keeping him company.
Steve seemed to be debating touching him, and Tony was torn between shoving the hand away and begging for Steve’s touch.  So he stayed as still as possible.
“Junior’s.  I accept no substitutes,” Tony ordered hoarsely.
It takes two days.
Eventually, they slowed to a crawl as they reached a section of beach between the cliffs, carved out by a small bubbling stream.  It formed a small rocky harbor, not big enough and too boulder-strewn for proper ships, but if necessary could shelter fishing boats from a squall.  The area seemed almost untouched, pristine from lack of human traffic.  The only trace of civilization was a small altar hollowed out from one of the boulders, filled with a few pieces of fruit and chunks of wool.  The tide was rising fast, and soon the contents of the altar would be out with the waves.
Akim looks guilty when they reach the furthest point he is willing to traverse.
Steve kissed him.
“He’s called Loki.  He’s . . . not from around here.  There’s a lot more we’ll have to bring you up to speed on if you’re in.  The world has gotten stranger then you already know.”
Tony decided to guide Steve on a tour around the plant before meeting Pepper. Happy had already set off to “meet his doom”, grumbling about deadly secretaries.
And he is.  Phasing hasn't changed anything aside from the knowledge of how to phase.  He's still
“Listen Steve, I’m not going to lie and try and take it back, but you don’t – “
Tony.  Of course
The idea of someone waiting at home left a metallic taste in his mouth.
“Tony!” Steve calls, running back.
Like he could deny Tony anything.
“I’ve been trying to come up with the best chemical compound to describe us, and I figured it out,” he pulled the texting feature up on a tablet.  Steve sighed.  “Have you been taking lessons from Pepper?”
Tony was silent.
He was so fucking tired of being an invalid.  He wanted to
Was Steve thinking about Peggy?  Still?  It was the most likely candidate.  She had been beautiful when she was younger.
And the door hisses open, and Steve is sanding there, looking, well,
Steve just when about his business, trying to settle himself, making the team his new family.
“I can’t support something I don’t support one hundred percent.  There’s all this talk of compromise, but you’re not allowed to make a stand anymore.  But maybe someone should.”
“Nah.  I may be spoiled at home, but I’ve done some hero stuff too.  Managed to fix my own armor straps.”  They shared yet another laugh when an idea from yesterday popped back up.  “Actually, I was wondering – I saw the forge in the orchard.  I was wondering, seeing as it doesn’t look like anyone’s using it, if it would be okay for me to . . . .”  He trailed of, unable to voice the words.
Bucky had the glitter polish out, and was about to start taking his current polish off with the remover, when he stopped and stared
“Why?  For believing?”
Tony swallowed, feeling like an egg was suck in his throat.  Steve still held his face.  “Yes.”
He sighs and lets his face fall into his hands. “To stay Iron Man and an Avenger.”
But something makes him pause.
“A spine that is not made of bone.
. It wouldn’t likely be published anyhow. There was the worry that some government official could catch wind of it, but Tony would be able to say with absolute honesty that
“I wish,” he croaked, blinking harshly to stop his eyes from blurring.
The man had smelt like thyme and sweat.
“He’s sending me to Korkyra.  Now.”
“JARVIS,” Tony called, wrought with tension.
“That I will.”
It was only due to Peter’s pathetic whining and Maria’s terrified warnings that he didn’t pull his funding on the Cap recovery expeditions.
“The rest of you,” he calls over at the group of children the world relies on to save it, “let’s make this a smooth as possible. We’ll get Tony in, and we fall back as soon as he re-emerges.  Quick in-and-out, got it?”
, which was an embarrassing shade of plum, and the more subdued
Zoloto cocks its head more.
Why, why,
“Well, look at it this way, they care for us enough to put money on our happiness,” Tony smiled at him, and it was just so brilliant, Steve just had to kiss him.
It was the time when the children stopped teaching their parents, and the parents would teach their children.
“I don’t like it.”
“Mm-hm,” Tony intones, looking around.  It’s one of the older cabins, tucked up high in the mountains.  No views of water, but brown trunks are everywhere.  The leaves are tipped in gold.  They’re very high up.  “Just you?”
approach Pikas?”
Shapanka let out a muffled noise of pain, before arches of ice shot from the hole, tipped in gross exaggerations of fingers. They trapped him, in the likes of a cage and wrapped around his ankles. Tony was able to smash through the ice, but numbness was already spreading through the armor.
but he covered it quickly. “So, these are your main offices?”
The man hoisted them up again. “You don’t need to pay me. But let’s get you out of here.”
They were quiet as Rhodey got out of the van and sauntered towards the door, holding it open for a little old Asian lady carrying an armload of Mexican bagged pastries.
It didn’t matter that Tony
“Look, I’m sorry. It’s just not been easy tonight, okay? Don’t take what I’m saying seriously.”
Peter gloated while Maria spluttered.
“It has been a pleasure meeting you,” Pikas declared in awe.
“Ah, see.  I don't get a suit of armor.  I'm exposed, like a nerve.  It's a nightmare.”
Note on the Historical Era:  this is set in the late Heroic Age / Early Iron Age, before the Dorian Invasion or Greek Dark Ages, approximately one hundred years after the end of the Trojan War (maybe two/three generations removed).  However, certain elements of society, dress, architectural elements (not buildings), craftsmanship, ect. come from post-Dorian Invasion and the Classical era, mainly because there is so little information on the era this will take place in (plus, they’re interesting and look cool).  This was the time when the gods of the Greek Pantheon were taking a less active role on Earth, yet their influence was still strong.  Athens was still ruled by a king/tyrant, and Sparta had not yet adopted the militarized society we are accustomed to learning about.

“Not so selfish,” Tony murmured.
“You don’t have to tell secrets to have a discussion.”
“Just what am I looking at here?”
“I’m letting you go because of the brilliant work you did in the past,” Tony informed him. “But as I can no longer trust you with government secrets or anything of the sort, I’m going to have to ask you to vacate the premises. Empty your desk and get out. And you would do well never to show your face here again.”
“I’m brittle.  I’m worthless.  I’m fake.”
Steve nods his affirmative, then bites his lip.  “Are you . . . going to keep the phone?”
“No, dear.  We just left you alone with your thoughts for a bit,” Korkyra said kindly.
“Well, I have been considering getting it trademarked,” Tony said with a steadily relaxing smirk.  “I’ll just be over here, hopefully sleeping.  Do I have to do a pose or something?”
“Ah.”  For the first time since arriving, Tony felt gut-wrenching disappointment.  It had been too presumptive of him, he supposed, that he could just have whatever he wanted.  But he
“Jack and Coke?”
Tony rolled over so his head was lying in Steve’s lap.  He schooled is feature into a mock-glare.  “What do you mean by that, Rogers?”
But this is a danger that metal can’t defend him from. It may be possible to rewire his brain, enfold his bones over armor, but the phrase “iron will” is nothing more than a metaphor.
He crashed through the window, bits of glass glinting in the sunlight.  He heard the repulsors fire up, and he turned in mid-air.
“Yes.” There isn’t any reason to hide the truth.  Well, a portion of it.  “I tracked down my mother’s family in Ural Mountains.  My parents are dead, but my aunt was really welcoming.  It was nice, but I had to come back.”
Other people had begun strolling over, calling out their congratulations.  Bucky railroaded through the crowd with about five unlit sparklers stuck in his bun, nursing a non-alcoholic beer.  He sighed and threw his fake arm around Steve’s shoulders with an exaggerated sniff.  “I can’t believe my baby’s getting’
Something in Tony’s chest squeezed the way it did whenever Steve did something especially thoughtful that left Tony wondering why
“Our goal is fifty yards down the road,” Nat said around her red plastic straw.

There was something secret about the smile that spread across Steve’s face, like that comment pleased him or something. Whatever it was sent a warm flush through Tony’s system. Happy made a gagging noise.
“REE-uh?”  Steve aloud, hoping he got it right.
“But,” Steve looked down and wet his lips, then looked at Tony, eyes searing. “I couldn’t work for you anymore. I wouldn’t get to see you. As much.”
my home.”
beds this soft.  The radio was on.  Baseball.
Happy shot him a glare in the rearview mirror. Tony elected to ignore it. Steve didn’t notice.
“Of course.” Steve reaches over and roughly tousles his hair. “I’m Captain America. It’s my shtick. And besides, I’ve got one hell of a role model for being better, now don’t I?”
The aluminum paneling was oxidizing underneath its paint and the desert air was frigid, but Tony was too enthralled by the expanse of sky above them to pay it any heed.
Steve nodded, chewing his barely mash.  “Kronia.  I had no idea of what it was when I first arrived here.  But it is actually very nice, everyone always enjoys it.  We don’t do things anywhere near Athens’ scale, but we make up for it in enthusiasm.”
” before Shapanka aimed the hose directly act Steve, encasing him in a perfectly transparent block of ice.
“Thank you for that,” Steve called out where he still stood by the water’s edge.
and Steve groans at Tony’s shit-eating grin.
If they were together, Steve would want Tony all the time.
“Steven?  Steven!”
It doesn’t
And by his grandmother’s standards, they were successful.  Even with his Pa gone, and the scrape to pay the rent every month, American poverty was preferable to Irish poverty.
Steve sighs. He does a lot of sighing where Tony is concerned, it seems. “I’m sorry for what I’ve done that would ever make you believe that.”
Rightfully so. Tony isn’t paying him in more rubles than possibly imaginable in this region and the unreleased StarkSnowtreader to ask questions.  Akim’s job is to use his experience to escort his single passenger as deep into the Ural Mountains as possible, before dropping Tony off and heading back to his village.  It is January, but Akim, Inga, and their children’s lives will be exponentially better after this occurrence, so Akim was agreeable to the job.  They both get what they want.  Akim gets money and a vehicle that will make his mountaineering business far more profitable.  Tony gets to follow a vapor trail into one of the most treacherous regions of the world.
“It is pretty, though”
“What’s her name?  Your daughter.”
again
In retrospect, it shouldn’t have been a surprise to see Pepper, Rhodey, and Bruce milling about with Steve’s friends in the backyard.
,” Tony gasped, trying to seat himself more fully on Steve’s fingers.
“What? I’m not –“ Happy stared him down in the rear-view mirror. “I don’t have to explain myself to you. Let me out.” He plucked ineffectively at the door.
“You drew me,” he says simply when Steve finds him.
Steve was alone.  Just alone as he had been for his entire life, if he thought about it.
But maybe they’re more terrified of what will happen if this
The horse’s trot faltered, and Tony turned enough to see the startled man on the horse’s back pull his

Tony rolled his eyes.  “You told them, didn’t you?”
It wasn’t just nice.  It was perfect.
“I can’t say. There’s no rhyme or reason to it. Usually I can drown out the desire with work, but tonight’s just one of those nights where I can’t.” Tony sighs and curls into himself a bit tighter. “All my thoughts and responsibilities . . . . Sometimes I just want it to all
More and more tiny cottages appeared next to tiny fields, with tiny people emerging, pointing and waving cheerfully.  They looked excited, thrilled at the sight of the trireme, like they’d never seen an Athenian warship before.  Which they probably hadn’t.
“Problems are still there when you wake up.”
“Alright,” Tony conceded slowly, as Steve continued to chortle.
“He was out of his league.  He should have waited.  He should have...”
“Doctor?”
It was five days worth of walking from Sparta, and he was on day three.  In the baking summer heat, Vanko’s head had begun to stink only a short while after Tony had decapitated him.
Steve was probably the worst.  He was the most parent-approved Avenger, and Tony was often shocked by the soft look that appeared on his face when little kids approached him.  He always knelt down, got on their level, and chatted politely.  He saved every drawing they gave him.
From the quite nature of it, the upper floor was reserved for Steve’s digression.  After peaking around, Tony found several rooms similar to his own, but more lived-in.  From weapons hanging innocently on the wall, they were soldiers or fighters of a sort.  Not normal hoplites as far as Tony could tell.  They seemed . . . specialized.  He was fairly certain one room belonged to a woman.  So much for separating the men and the women, not that Tony would protest.  He spent far too much time in the women’s quarters to complain too loudly.
“I’m in love with Tony.”
But Tony had risen above the rest.  While the others had sat with him for half an hour, showing him YouTube videos of their favorites, Tony routinely tracked down the original albums, and would sit with Steve for hours, playing them and adding historical context, antecedents, commentary.  They watched documentaries on Woodstock and Candlestick Park.  They would sit for hours, playing the albums and taking, and talking and playing the albums.  Now, Steve was sure that was a large part in his falling in love with Tony, right up there with sitting in Tony’s workshop while Tony prattled on about his inventions.  The music lessons might have slightly more importance, because they taught Steve how wonderful it was to have all of Tony’s attention on him, no distractions or pretences.
Iron will float among the stars until it forms a new one. Iron Man will fly again. He’ll make sure of it.
There was a moment of silence.  “Wow.  You just . . . don’t care about the fact that you’re descended from so much history?” Natasha asked, not is shock, but in a calculating manner
“Where?” was all he asked.
“Tony, I’ve come to . . . an understanding, about us. I’ve been thinking. So much has happened between us, and we never have time to say it . . . but I apologize. Of how I act sometimes. I can’t say it’ll never happen again, but . . . you mean more to me than that.”
“Like shit.”
“It’s hot,” Tony complains.
.  “You need to learn to be a man, a
“Tell ya what: the next building is going to say ‘Potts’ on the tower.”
When Erskine asked, “What do your children have to say about the success of the procedure?”, Steve was about to say he didn’t know, but they piped up:
Steve reached out and claimed his share of the figs before Tony could inhale them all.  His reluctance was palpable.  “Do you . . . know what the people supposedly looked like?” he ventured cautiously.
Water vapor fills his nose, and it tries freezing his hair, his beard, his eyebrows. He feels Dikost pull and maneuver his body in such a way that sends them in a series of spiraling loops through the thin, laden air.
“I was going to ask – if I could have my shield back.  But I don’t think – I don’t deserve it right now.  I need to earn it back.”
"Well, Captain." Tony lowered his voice an octave and allowed his eyes to fall to half-mast.  He was being ridiculously sultry, but Steve was on a hair trigger, and anything Tony did right now had Steve's blood thrumming and singing in his veins.  "Why don't we move this to the bedroom, hmmm?"
“That was Fury.  Looks like we’re gonna have to break this up,” he announced apologetically.  Everyone except Steve groaned.
He traced slowly down Steve’s abs, Steve smiling sappily up at him.  When he finished, Tony chucked the wipes off the side of the bed and Steve dragged him down for a soft but still heated kiss.
Bruce smiled gratefully at her as she set the still-steeping Chi tea in front of him, and Steve set her tray next to the empty seat to Clint's left.  He put his on the end of the table and slid a chair from a nearby table over instead of pulling over another table.
They sat in the sudden silent darkness, Steve trying to wake himself, Tony trying to restrain himself from launching himself into Steve’s lap.
“You’re gonna win this for sure!”
Then Steve is standing in front of him, staring him down.  A broad hand reaches up, cups his face.  It
“Steve offered to mentor you.  He’s the best man I’ve ever known.  If you could be a tenth of the man he is, I’d be happy.  There’s a ship that’s waiting.  Now,
Pepper tugged him from the room as Maria turned to hide her tears.
Ignoring Bruce’s smug smirk, Tony winced, but spoke.  “Heeeey, Steve.  Just wondering what baby that was.”
For the first time in his life, Tony wondered what he would do in the event of war.  Not the silly imaginings of a kid, not the hypotheticals that lay unexamined.  But when the time came, and he had to raise his sword and lead his armies into battle.  Either as king or still a prince, it didn’t matter, as Howard was probably too old to realistically led from anywhere except the sidelines.  Tony still couldn’t be appointed a general for another decade according to Athenian law, but rules were always bent and sometimes ever destroyed in difficult times.  Steve was made a de-facto general after he was given his kingship that he had managed flawlessly, and he had been younger than Tony was now.  But speaking of Steve, that meant Tony wouldn’t be alone, would he?  There would be the Alastors, both the ones here and the ones who were apparently scattered to the winds.  They could fight as a team.  Maybe he could even get Rhodey included in the ranks of the Alastors.  Tony might be one of the ones doing the leading, but he wouldn’t even be alone in leadership.
“Actually, I think I can finish the pot off by myself,” Steve taunted.
He enjoyed his time with Steve entirely too much. It was difficult to put a finger on just what held so much appeal, but it was something in the purity of Steve’s sight, there was he perceived the world, realistic and idealistic at the same time. Knowing how the world worked but constantly hoping for something better. Doing what he could to make things better. Making the world into something worthwhile.
His bones felt heavy, like all that was keeping him standing was his armor and the sweat.  He’d lost his sense of smell somewhere around Argos, so the stench that came from his skin was not as overpowering as it might have been.  But the odor of the decaying head in the leather pouch on his belt would probably keep anyone who might be able to tell him how bad he smelled away.
“The king will miss me,” she hissed as Pepper firmly griped the woman’s arm.
anymore?”
“You didn’t need to.”
He stares down at his snow boots. “I got a transmission from home.  I need to go back.  I’m sorry.”
“Goddamn it, Tony!  Don’t put words in my mouth!”
Eager to change the subject, Tony latched on. “Yeah, pretty important neighbor moving in for next year. Happy, turn here.”
Tony lying on his stomach, no, back,
“Put on the suit, let's find out.”
“Right,” Tony whispered, voice thick in his ears.
“You said people are a certain way, in-in love,” Tony diverted haltingly.  “How would I be?”
But even with that, Tony somehow rose above it all to become extraordinary.
she replied calmly, belying the sound of gunfire in the background.
Tony tripped over a carriage’s spare trace and nearly spilled the basket.  “Jan is an old friend.  I haven’t made up my mind about her husband yet.”  Natasha nodded in a way that said “Fair enough.”  “But no, what I am I
But that’s not the right thing to think. He’s already damaged beyond repair, and no one can fix him. Yet he’s tempted, because if he worded it right, maybe he could guilt Steve into some semblance of a relationship. Because Steve would want to help, in any way possible, because that’s just what Steve does.
It was awful, to think that, with all his genius, he was still susceptible to not knowing what he needed until it was gone.

Tony had his teeth gritted, clenching his fists into his sheets and the red fleece sleep pants he was wearing, tablet lying forgotten by his knees.
, Tony knew that Steve would never be content to just be a helper/sidekick/bodyguard.
“No, no, it’s fine.”  He was used to people talking about him.
“He's not slowing down.”
“You’ll have to say, it was smart to have it here.  This is the closet RF tower to the Centers for Disease Control.  They have moles working there, who have coded all the canisters where they keep the old diseases.  You understand it better than I.  But from what Steve and Sam have gathered, they are at the point where they just send the signal from their site in the Sierra Navadas, it gets picked up through satellite, and gets put through this site, where it produces the frequency that would unlock the sealed specimens and release them before they can achieve lock down.  It gets to the airport, it goes international.  Smallpox, bubonic plague, everything.”
“Nasty, but fascinating. I wanna know how he figured out how to freeze himself and everyone else like that –“ The klaxon sounded. “What the hell is it
“But you're not the only people out there, are you?  And, you're not the only threat.  The world's filling up with people who can't be matched, they can't be controlled.”
Didn’t Tony
, you do kill me! There’s a better kiss in it for you when you win!” She waved flirtily, the scampered away, dragging the eyes of the pit crew to her pert derrière.
need to be pressed against Steve in the night.  There was too much temptation already in his daily life, and Tony was certain Steve would snap his neck if he got too close.
A fleet of dark, strangely shaped cars pulled up, surrounding him in three seconds.  Sleek.  Professional.
“Thought it was stew,” Tony retorted, stumbling in to sit down.  He plopped himself into one of the aluminum barstools affixed to the floor, spinning it slightly.
, no dancing girls and kithara boys.  They made the obligatory sacrifices to the gods, but it was not followed by the custom drinking songs or songs of thanksgiving.  Hell, there was no divide between eating and drinking.  Whenever anyone wanted more of anything, they went and got it for themselves.  But probably the oddest thing was there was no patterned conversation.  No going around and speaking for approximately the same amount of time.  Nothing was formal about it.
“Never mind. I talk crazy when I'm tired. Just get in here.” Steve laughs lightly and strips down to his boxer briefs and tee shirt and crawls in beneath the covers.
“I thought you would be mad at me,” he says, voice small.
“I always have.”
“‘Friend’ is a subjective term, especially in the world of war and kings.  ‘Comrade’ might equate with friend, but it is not true.  There are those you work with because you have to.  That is what Howard is to me.  But these people,” he gestured around at his ragtag crew, “are my family.”
Korkyra beckoned him over.  “I was one, already.  My father is one of the great rivers of the Peloponnese.  I caught Poseidon’s eye, and several of my sisters did as well if I am honest, and he brought me here, and then left me here to raise our son to be king of the island.  At least he let them name it after me.”  She smiled ruefully.  “Now I watch over the rivers and streams of my island.”
“So, basically sign off on any claim on SI in the event of a divorce?  Not that it will happen.”
It had become something to do when there was spare time.  Steve had been quickly introduced to the basics of music over the past seventy years: Elvis, the Beatles, Motown, disco, hair bands, grunge, but he had wanted a more in-depth education.  His friends had risen to the challenge spectacularly.
“Not so much, no.  When he’s not that thing, guy’s a regular Stephen Hawking.”
They took the road north, with was dusty and rutted from carts coming into town.  It swept high, giving excellent views of the town and the harbor.
The two of them looked over the side, staring straight into a turbine, which was apparently capable of flight.
A double sigh.
“Rogers, we gathered everything related to the Tesseract.  This does not mean that we're-“
“Tony, I wish – I wish I could go back – take it back – “
“Tony.”  She glared.
“Ha, they even got to make fun of your age in nail color,” Tony sassed, until Steve kissed him, in thanks and to shut him up.
His mother smiled, weary.  “She did.”
Firmly muscled arms loop loosely around Tony’s neck, and a face presses into the base of his skull.  It’s like pressing a button.  Fat tears spill from his eyes, and can’t stop them.  They fit together like a dream, like everything he had always wanted, but no.  No.  He messed up, he can’t . . . .
Its body is somewhere between the traditional “western” and “eastern” varieties. Its wings are pure western, thin membranes of scaly skin folded loosely.  The body longer and more serpentine, with four claws, one of which appears opposable.  That’s eastern.  The snout is just plain
Happy just sighed. “You’re good at hiding that hopeless romantic that lurks inside, but I ain’t buyin’ it.”
Steve just sat there, phone still pressed to his ear, slumped on the couch, staring at the wall.  He could imagine the pair’s squabbling, ringing around the sound of gunfire.
This, he reflected as he traced a finger along the chain of the St. Florian medallion, is why Tony Stark couldn’t have nice things.
He was thrown for a loop, though, seeming Tony’s nearly-naked form sprawled across the couch.  He was fast asleep, positioned much like Rose from
As they had gotten closer to New York, Steve had gotten more and more subdued. By the time they pulled into the station he’d been positively morose. He’s barely uttered a word beyond “Sure” and a noncommittal “Mmm”.
I'm not going to delete it.  I fucked up.  I'm keeping a record of that.  I try to remember my own failings.
Ross had shown up weeks ago, blowing steam from both nostrils, demanding to know what had happened on the Raft.  Tony had simply given him access to the security nodes for the past several days, showing that the three of them had not left the compound once.  He had then demanded to know the whereabouts of Natasha and Peter, to which Tony responded “You try tracking a Russian spy” and “Blow it out your ass.”  Ross had stormed out, and Tony went back to helping Rhodey totter around.  The order to ground the Avengers until further notice was tacked onto the fridge with the butterfly magnets that Vision had accidentally ordered five hundred of.
“Not officially.  Just putting it out there.”
– Steve,” he begged.
The hiss of flamethrowers begins as the henchmen begin aiming for . . . nothing. Fire spreads across the rotted beams of the building.
Tony examined the inlaid train outlines on the wooden walls.
And Tony would give up everything just to have this chance.
A hiss issued from the needle that Romanoff stabbed in his neck.
Steve has yet to say anything.
“So, what does Fury do?”  It was a good as a place to start as anywhere.
“Doesn’t matter.  If he frees Loki or kills him, the Tesseract’s lost.”
“Oh, yeah, hey, the growth of the car, and the introduction of the interstate system, that’s something you should look into.  A lot of culture shifts happened in the fifties and sixties because people could easily get pretty much anywhere.”
“Must be strange for you, all of this.”
“We were just about to start worrying!”
Natasha pulled him through the crowd of nurses, down the hall, into a tiny alcove.  It was down one of the hallways, tucked in a corner, across from the vending machines.  It had been furnished with a couch and several chairs, covered in a slick navy pleather.  There were several small tables covered in a mixture of outdated magazines, pamphlets for diseases and disorders and their warning signs, and worn blue hard-backed illustrated bible stories.
The Quinjet, as the agents had called it, flew smoother than anything he’d ever ridden in.
Usually, Steve’s voice is alert, ready for action. Ready to leap out of bed into his patriotic suit. But right now, he sounds exhausted. Words husky and muddled from sleep. Tony wants to apologize and hang up, let the man get his much-needed rest, but he’s already alerted Steve that something’s wrong. Steve would never dump the phone and go back to sleep, not when he knows Tony would never call him at 3:58 in the morning without a very good reason.
, and I
“You’re gold anyway.  Gold doesn’t tarnish.”
Steve continued to let his gaze bore a hole in the table. “I’m sure she was after you, Mister St – Tony. You’re a rakishly handsome genius millionaire. And I’m . . . me.” A slight blush tinged his cheeks.
“You’re in a recovery room in New York City.”
"Then why won't you let me help you?"
Tony would be so good.  And he would be Tony, not the Tony Stark.  He wouldn’t be compelled to act or be something other than himself.  The only expectation Steve ever had for Tony was for him to be himself.  Tony would be himself, all that focused energy on
Shapanka’s nostrils were dilated in rage. “So it’s true,” he spat. “Gonna call the cops now, eh?”
Steve didn’t fit in well with the social set, but he didn’t try. He stood, unobtrusively as possible for someone of his stature, off to the side while Tony mingled and accepted praise and kisses, but Tony could never look away. Steve was always one of the most beautiful people in the room, and always the most handsome man, so Tony wasn’t the only one looking. Many men looked on in jealously as ladies drifted over towards him. Steve would shift awkwardly under the attention, before he quickly found out that they dispersed as soon as he dropped “my employer, Mister Stark”. And for the rest of the night, Steve would watch Tony, and Tony would watch Steve, wishing Steve was looking at him because he wanted to, not because it was his job, before Tony would tire and tell Steve to have Happy pull the car around.
Even if he wasn’t what Tony needed.
Steve shook his head.  “I don’t understand how someone such as you could long for the Golden Age so much.  I know why I might have like it, but you don’t seem the type.”
Tony has just begun exploring possible specs for an auto-release function that would make sure any future armors can read him for phasing and will shed accordingly without being torn to shreds. It’s going to take some time.  He’s going to have to spend time measuring the physiological indicators of impending phasing.  Hell, he needs to spend some time exploring his dragon body.
And Tony sees his own staring back at him.
“Yeah, and you put
Steve
Tony’s hands scrabble for purchase, almost clawing Steve’s arms, head, back, but he ends up with his hands cupping Steve hard jaw, the tips of his middle fingers pressed into the hollows beneath Steve’s ears, the token burning between their skin. Steve keeps his hands squarely on Tony’s hips, not roaming but not letting go either.
“Really?”
“SHUT UP,”Natasha shouted.  And they did.
Shapanka just grinned manically. “Careful, Captain. We should keep ourselves
“Makes life so much sweeter,” Steve finished for him.  “The gods are eternal.  They never change.  We’re . . . so much more fragile.  Humanity is beautiful, but it’s . . . temporary.  Fleeting.  This moment will pass, and it will never happen again.  The plants will die.  My skin will wither and your hair will grey.  The conditions are impossible to replicate, so the sweetness of the moment is that much greater.  You agree?”
The tremors of an over-worked engine echoed through the sound of rubble burning.  Banner was riding an ancient motor bike, which was puttering through the debris.
, Tony thought as he squared his shoulders,
Adorable.
He let the bag fly.
“Cap, it’s a trap, we gotta go,” Tony murmurs urgently. Steve glances back at him, scorn in his eyes, but he doesn’t know.  He doesn’t know.
“You break anything, it’s on your tab,” Tony said, not blinking as he watched while Steve did some warm-up stretches before he started swimming.
The twins had actually helped him get in.  One of the questions they had asked for Erskine’s program was if he had the voices of his children in his head.  They hadn’t asked anything else, like names or anything else specific, but whoever was selected was insured survival if they would have children.  Steve didn’t know just exactly the project would require him to do, but he wanted to be the one chosen so badly it made his teeth ache.
“It’s a musical thing.  People with doctorates don’t always understand . . . doesn’t matter.  If you don’t get in your car and get your butt to Camp Nelson, I’m going to use my new tranquilizer on your butt and bring you there myself.”
He still wanted.  God, he wanted.
Bruce just laughed.  “You’re right.  Don’t worry; saying I’m not much of a fighter doesn’t offend me.  But there are more me’s than meet the eye.”  Bruce’s smile was pained.  He turned to the other two, who looked ready to stage a wrestling match to rival one of Herakles’.  “Should we be heading to dinner?  Sun’s getting low.”
He has to admit that Stark has it under control.  He makes sure to catch every news story the man is on, and the entire set up is perfect.  Hair, suit, smirk, ubiquitous sunglasses.
are you hidden?  You say we . . . are there others?  Just, gimme a primer.”
, that someone might have seen the potential between them filled him with, a fiery, restless longing.
Carol is giggling when Tony makes his way over to them. “What’re you laughing at?” he grumbles, but she just hands him the thermos, laughing the entire time.
“They say – they say with these types of –
She tapped the arc reactor.
“Love you, too.
“So you’re disinheriting me.”  Fine.  Tony would take his mother and Pepper, and . . . set up as a blacksmith.  In Corinth.  Or Argos.  Or Pylos.  Somewhere.  They could go to Zancle.  Rhodey would be king, and Tony would be free to do what he wanted.
The man cut him off. “Look, I’m scared enough without any help from you! Just – work with me here? Can you stand?”
“And your great-great-grandmother,” Korkyra supplied helpfully.
“I know.  Tony, what’s this about?”
“Uh-huh.  Or you'll be suiting up like the rest of us.”
?  I mean I do, love to have sex with you, but it’s not the only thing . . . .”  Steve was smiling lightly, nodding.  “ . . . I love you.  Everything kind of stems from that.”
as Tony accepted his own.
“And he loves you.”  There was a weighted moment where Jane just stared knowingly at him.
He has the armor, so the terrain isn’t an issue. He probably should wait for spring at least, but he is fit to burst, chasing answers that have led here.  Tony doesn’t know how the Urals might hold the key to the puzzle of his origin, but waiting has never been his strong suit.
Pepper and Happy’s angry whispers were silenced by Steve and Tony’s entrance into the ante-office. It was largely Pepper’s domain, so her taste reigned. But, if she was willing to keep all the weird little plants alive, Tony wasn’t going to say anything.
“Oh, come on Rhodes, gimme a little slack, will you?  I walked from Athens to Sparta, and half of the way back.  In armor.”
“Legendary women from the island’s history?  Are you actually surprised that they’re still here?”  Steve had a point.  “They stay as guardians and advise those who live here.  Downright scared the crap out of me when Naus first jumped out of the tide at me, and that was after I’d been at war for years.  They’ve kept me in check for ages.”
Steve is staring at him with what Tony recognizes as his artist’s eye as he approaches, filled with wonder but trying to capture and understand as well.
Steve had sacrificed everything for the good of humanity.  People often diluted it to “his country”, but Steve wouldn’t demand to see proof of citizenship before he saved someone’s life.  An American wasn’t worth more in Steve’s eyes.  All life was equally precious.  You could probably claim a lot of people thought that way, but believed it to the fullest extent?  Just one of the many ways everyone paled in the shadow of Steve Rogers.
“Taller.”
“He’s just drunk?  He didn’t take . . . anything else?”
He was a teammate, a genius, and a friend.  He was terribly mature for his age.  Tony was Iron Man, not Iron Boy.
Then he started digging around in the pack.  Along with the kykeon, there was bread, cheese, olives, and early figs.  Tony ate and drank the mash in a haze, thinking.  Or perhaps, overthinking.
“Don’t judge Steve too harshly,” Peggy scolded.  “You don’t know him; not many people
all while he hasn’t taken a shower, so there is that faint scent on his skin, of sex, of Steve, of everything he wants and nothing he can have.
The first woman stood before the others, hands on her hips.  She looked maybe Tony’s age, or a little younger, but knowing nymphs she could be a newborn or ancient.  Her tunic was a light, pure blue, like an opaque ocean wave, with silver fastenings, that ended mid-calf.  Her rich brown hair was lose, except for a circlet studded with pearls wound round her brow.  Matching armbands were on her well-tanned biceps.  She shocked Tony with how tan she was, as few women spent so much time in the sun.  But then, she obviously wasn’t any normal woman.
. . . .  He and Bucky are basically brothers.  They’re implying incest.”
“Where are we?”
And for some reason, they had taken Tony into their fold.  They treated him like they had know him for years, and while they joked about it constantly, they didn’t really want him to buy them things (well, they did, but it wasn’t so much like using him as it was helping themselves).
There is a point in the sky where it doesn’t matter what the temperature is on the ground, the cold of space will still dominate. He knows this, because he’s had to struggle with it, in both aeronautics and his suits.
Thor removed Jane’s garter with his teeth, and then grinning, ignored the crowd of guys waiting and launched it directly at Steve’s face.
Growing up in Athens, one didn’t see nature spirits all too often.  You might spy the occasional nymph out of the corner of your eye, and the rivers Kifisos and Ilisos were exceptionally cranky and aired their grievances with Howard frequently, but generally the more mortal activity going on, the less immortals wanted to reveal themselves.  In Tony’s experience, fields and forests were much better places to stumble across gods.
“<How do you mean?>”
“Nah, unless you want mine.  Hey Nat, does he know yet?”
.  This thing has no fucking AC.  I don’t do hot.  Well, I am hot, let’s face it, but I like the air to be 70 degrees and dry.”
There had been several
away from Tony’s.  Steve was leaning towards him, easy open smile and warm, understanding eyes, approval leaking from every pore.  Tony wanted to pull him closer, and feel this embodiment for heroism pressed against him.  His voice was low, intimate.  “I have to say that you are right.  Who your father is does not determine who you are.”
“We’re gonna need to work on these trust issues.”
Tony, for this part, squeaked.  “We’re not – “
Tony is in the air and has Steve slung across the floor before he can blink. The explosion destroys only a couple of feet of timber, but sends the rest careening down, pinning him.
He would overcome this.  They could set this
He ran, and ran, and ran, through streets that were familiar yet unrecognizable.  He saw a street sign and immediately recognized his location, midtown Manhattan, but no land mark was at all familiar.  It was like someone had replaced all the buildings, but left the street plan.
She pulled a knife from her belt, cut off some fresh chives and parsley from the tiny herb pots that Bruce kept on the window sill, and began brutally chopping them fine, so fine they almost became paste.  “Tony’s going to be the guy who sleeps around to try and find some sort of intimacy.  The only reason he hasn’t already is because of all he’s been through in the past few years and all of the responsibilities he has.  But mark my words,” she fixed him with a glare so intense he felt two inches tall.  “I
“We’ve secured the perimeter, but I don’t think we should hold it for too much longer.”
“Yeah, I’m – getting’ better. You can call me Tony. What’s your name?”
That left Tony confused.  “What’s your main weapon, then?”
He’d been sweating so long without a wash that the salt had run into the creases of this arms, legs, neck, and any gully formed by the armor, drying and crusting.  If he were poor, he would probably scrape it off and eat it.  Salt wasn’t cheap right now, as any shipments coming from the East or the South were stalled, as the exporters demanded twice the gold for a case of it than they had during the war.  Which was saying something, as salt prices during the war had been four times what they had ever been before.  The only shipments they were getting were from the North, and it would be some time before production had been increased to the amount that would be able to sufficiently supply the majority of the
That was the major source of Steve’s anger over Tony’s sabbatical. He’s admitted it now.  As much as he was happy that Tony had found some peace, he worried over it stealing Tony away.
, no, I take it back.”
Tony grunts, but with Steve’s help, they manage to loosen the blankets enough to free an arm. Soon enough, he is greedily slurping coffee and Steve is settling into the couch next to him after dumping a load of wet cloth into the wash.
Steve was even honest in his lying.  Tony had never met anyone who would up front
“Pepper,” Tony ordered, nearly vibrating with rage, “see that Jarvis has her on the market at once.  I won’t demand a brothel, but at least a textile factory.”
.  Tony had never seen them worn by anyone besides slaves and day laborers.  Yet somehow, the simple garment fit Steve, his legend, and the island.  So worried he was about feeling overdressed that he forgot to mourn the disappearance of the majority of Steve’s muscled form.
The water in his mouth now tasted like sand, but before he could respond, Pikas again swole to his full height and width.
But he’s never felt it on his skin, without some metal shell protecting him, with a dozen dragons surrounding him.
When he had first entered the room, Tony had been assaulted by the bright sunlight and the scent of cigar smoke, which hadn’t faded but had leached into the wood of the room, staining it darker brown.  Fat cigars, smuggled from Cuba to seal deals with emphysema.
“Word is you can find the cube.”
Both Steve and Tony laughed.  “How did Bruce find her, anyway?”
Pepper looked like he had lifted a tremendous weight off her chest.  “Thank God.  I know I’m not his guardian anymore, but I still feel obligated-“
“Something the matter?” Steve asked innocently.
Then they’re kissing, and now that Steve is an active participant it’s just south of heaven. It’s not gentle, but it’s not bruising. It’s an extension of what they’ve always had: one pushing, the other pulling, each one giving as good as they get. Pressing against one another, and molding everything into completion.
“Sorry,” Steve shrugged off his jacket and moved to hang it on a coat hook that wasn’t there.
“Guys,” Romanoff said warningly.
was going on between him and Steve.
a little voice shouted in his head.  But he quashed it.  Hera was his possible patron.  It was enough.  It had to be.  A mirage that may or may not have been Hephaestus was no proof.  Though it occurred to him that Steve hadn’t directly addressed that story.  Hmm.
“It’s good to be back,” Tony agrees breathlessly after the downs the entire bottle.
Steve laughed in spite of himself.  They hadn’t deviated from the red, white and blue formula, called here
“Alright, Tony?”
, you’re the center of us.  When I’m around you, I’m calm, I’m happy, and I never really knew what that was like until you.  When I’m with you, I feel – I feel
“Steve, a lot of our friends are gonna die. They’re gonna get old and die and there’s nothing we can do about it.  But the world isn’t going to sit back and keep the peace.  There will always be new threats, and there are going to need to be Avengers to fight those threats.”
of the Heavens and presumably the god of metalworking.
He was starting to get into it (the sweet, almost reverent way Steve kissed him was taking some getting used to, not that he was complaining), when Steve pulled back.  Tony was a grown man, so the noise he made could not be called a whine, no matter what Natasha said.
Along the way, Steve kept a running commentary, telling Tony more than could ever care to know about the seasons and the agriculture.  But Steve also asked about how things were in Athens, and in other places on the mainland.  He heard reports and got letters, of course, but it wasn’t often anyone who was involved in the finer politics of the mainland visited.  Tony told him as much as he could, about kings and princes and tyrants.  Largely, things were calm, nothing major, but Tony remarked on how bored people seemed.  He confided his worries that war would break out, and he wouldn’t be in Athens to help.
“I thought that was what I was doing to you,” Steve taunted, ignoring Tony’s requests.
The stream of energy from the top of the Tower slowed and died.  The portal seemed to suck back in on itself.
“And then usually you and Sam steal the seed to feed to the birds.  Oh yes, I’m onto you,” she responded to Clint’s affronted glare.
“Captain?  We’re ready for you,” one of the makeup girls simpered.  He thought about it, while squashed into the beautician’s chair, that there was no way three girls were needed to fix him up for the camera.  Especially how all three were consciously shoving their cleavage in his face.
“Steve asked me to come get you. You need to be debriefed on what you missed.  Rhodey tagged along because he is like a baby ducking who lost his mother when you’re gone,” Carol supplies as she helps herself to an apple spice donut hole.
But when he looked up, Steve was shaking his head.  “I understand the urge, Tony, but that’s no way to go about this.  Howard still raised you . . . well, he had total authority on how you were raised.  You’re still his heir, and unless you want a succession crisis on Athens’ hands –“
“BARTON!” but Clint was already fleeing the room, running and cackling madly.
Steve just shook his head again.  “Tony, you’ll be sitting with me, as my guest of honor.  Fury, that gives you a couch to yourself.”
Once the water was steaming, Tony stepped into the tub and pulled the polka-dot shower curtain closed.  Almost immediately, he let out a string of swears as his knee sent a mound of bath toys balanced precariously on the sides cascading onto his feet.  He bent over, swearing as he tried to haphazardly put them back into their places.  He got a face full of cold water when he tried picking up a squeaky shark and found it squirted water.
Steve had no intentions of ever pulling away, but he felt the soft tremor that meant Tony needed to breathe.  He pulled away enough to let Tony gasp and pull air into his lungs and expel the carbon dioxide Steve had breathed into him.  He relished the warmth of sour coffee breath on his face.
“So where is this thing in Cincinnati?  I can find a museum or something while you’re at the conference.”
“Go where?”
No one knew, save Peggy, the old King of Korkyra, and several others, what had made Steve, and they all refused to talk.
The Asgardian wore a self-satisfied smirk as he gazed down at the sceptere.  Really, was that what it looked liked when he was pleased with himself?
He ignored Rogers.  “You really have got a lid on it, haven't you?  What's your secret?  Mellow jazz?  Bongo drums? Huge bag of weed?”
"But what is it?"
He sat up and looked around.  It looked like a simple hospital room, but . . . off, somehow.  Hospitals didn’t usually have gossamer curtains and personal radios.  The room was more the size of a studio apartment.  And the smell of anesthetic and urine was absent.
“Well, you're not wrong.”
“Always a way out.  You know, you may not be a threat, but you better stop pretending to be a hero.”
Maybe it's not the dragon thing that has Steve frozen.
Gotta love them old Russian ladies.
still a kid.  Suffering from shell shock and whatever emotional abuse Howard had managed to put him through.
“Alright. Let’s fly.”
Steve just raises his shield. “Last warning.”
“Nothing’s wrong,” he said, too forcefully.  He jabbed at the keyboard.  “Everything is fine and dandy in Stark-land, never been better . . . .”
“Well, I’ve had a lot of practice.”  Tony couldn’t help but notice the flex of Steve’s biceps and he reached forward to slide it onto his left arm.  It his control over it made it seem like it was an extension of his body.  “I don’t use a spear – “
“I was quite the buzz around here, finding you in the ice.  I thought Coluson was gonna swoon.  Did he ask you to sign his Captain America trading cards yet?”
“When?”  Tony gazed into the sparse room, only half listening as his mind whorled.
“Don’t talk that way,” Tony urged.  “I’m pretty sure I have it worse than you.  As least you get to pick.  Howard’s always bemoaning how he only has one legitimate kid to marry off to get a peace treaty.  He waffles between a dozen rich Athenian girls, and a load of foreign princesses.  Trust me, I’ll end up saddled to whoever’s father gives him the best deal when the time comes.”
He needed to stop this, he thought as he tucked the orange Post-It and scrap of multimedia paper lovingly beneath the plate.  He needed to stop thinking of Tony this way; he needed to give up on the faint hope that he could be something more than a friend in Tony’s life.
“She seems to know how to please.”
Tony huffed the same way Maria did when she was trying to act superior.  “Okay, Rogers, but I am still taking advantage of mood swings, foot rubs, and sending you out for ice cream at 3 a.m.”
Nat sighed, and moved a precariously balanced pile of papers and sat at the end of the desk Tony was working from.  The computers were from the mid 2000’s, took ages to load, but were horrible for a modern hacker because of how incompatible the systems were.  So here he was, wiping the programs by hand while Rhodey tried to find the specific wavelength’s receiver and yank it out.  With Nat staring into his soul.
“It’ll allow us to get to know each other a bit better –“
The slick smile works now, because no one can tell that it doesn’t reach his eyes.  Contracts go through, because it’s a lot harder to call his bluff.
“What-?”  He was cut off by the door opening.
Like Tony’s happiness.  Or has the potential to be.
“Missed you,” Tony breathed in his ear.
was this metal,
“Cap – Steve Rogers.”
Something ripples above him, a shadow maybe fifty feet long.  Green.  Gold.
So he had figured it out then.
But then, Steve is always careful when the subject of alcohol is in the air. They haven’t mentioned it yet, but Steve will bring it up eventually.

But see his eyes?  Already afire.”
The interior was different from the exterior, so maybe three people knew that Tony’s blasé exterior was hiding a needy and overly affectionate interior.  Parts of it still bled out and slipped out through the cracks of his emotional armor, but throwing money at people he liked could be excused as eccentricism, and everything else as manic-depressive tendencies.   He was both, so it wasn’t too much of a lie.

He listened as Steve gently clicked through the “news” sites for a moment before he closed the door with a snap, and went to cry his eyes into Steve’s pillow.
“Ah.”

“I’m going to live a long time.”
handjobs.  Not that he would ever know.
“Ay, what if it’s one ‘a them tame birds that rich peoples sometimes has?”  The group of sailors collectively turned to Tony for conformation.
“What’s Steve’s way of . . . managing slaves?”
When it came to daddy issues, godly offspring always won, hands down.  While stories told of them watching their children grow up with a degree of fondness and pride, they weren’t ones to visit.  If a god ever did speak to their mortal child directly (in other words, not through prophets or oracles), it was usually a one-time thing, where the god tried to make up for their absence with a shiny gift and an “opportunity” for a quest that would either give them glory or death.  (Oddly, goddesses didn’t seem to have the same hang-ups, even for their non-offspring champions.  Sure they weren’t there day-to-day unless you were Akhilles and your mom was Thetis, but Athena and Artemis and Hera were a lot more likely to show up after your quest, even if it was only to demand your gratitude.)
“Steve?” Bucky pleaded.

An icy crackle sounded from behind him, and they both whirled around. Jack Frost lowered the hose he was using to ice the doorway closed. “So nice to see you again,

for three decades.  It’s – it’s important to me, Tony.  That we make that commitment.”
Steve visibly deflates, stares up at the sky for a moment, before looking down and examining a knot in the wood.  “Who else knows?”
“Medical opium, or poison opium?”
It was breaking his heart.
The woman in the purple answered first.  “I am Makris, daughter of Aristaios and Autonoe of Thebes.”
"I love you," he blurted out, because he could think of nothing else to say.
He didn’t need to listen to this.  Rogers grabbed for him.
They did as he ordered. Shapanka stood there, rubbing his wrists and looking very small.
“Genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist.”
Tony couldn’t help himself from pressing a firm kiss to Steve’s lips.  It was over quickly, but did its job: assured Steve of how he felt.
“Did he have a voice?”
Steve’s room had been left immaculate.  No empty drawers gaping or trash left in the wastebasket.  It was like a hotel room, bed made, blinds drawn, and no trace of any human in habitation.
“I asked you – and you were – “ Steve spluttered.
Pepper was suitably touched, and Steve rose to be cemented as her favorite (something Happy was endlessly bitter about), but Tony couldn’t begrudge her. Steve was his favorite, too.
“I’m beginning to recognize that.  But not everything about the modern world’s way of handling things is right.”
military. I don’t really know if I am anymore.”
“An argument can be made for fifteen.”
Zoloto tells him, mirth in her tone.
who cares for you
Makris looked over at Tony and grinned impishly.  “Lucky for you to have new member on your team, eh?”
“Tony?  Are you listening?”
Like some sort of classical god of sleeping beauty.
Somehow, the excuses weren’t cutting it anymore.  They were just that: excuses.
“The girl did.”
Tony was both tensed and relaxed, back arching up to meet him, face screwed up, clinging to Steve like a baby koala as he set a steady but relentless pace that had him grazing Tony’s prostate with every thrust.  Tony whimpered and gasped, eyelashes stuttering and clumping together with tears.  Steve worried for a moment, slowed when he saw the wetness on Tony’s face, terrified at what he might have done, until Tony growled “If you stop right
It ached his heart to see Tony like this.  He had gone down to Tony’s workshop countless times to find him slung carelessly over the couch, limbs cluttered and mouth gaping, still covered in motor oil and WD-40.
But Steve’s perceptive outside of the battlefield, which makes him more dangerous.
He was
The texture of rusting iron always intrigued him. It’s not pleasing in the slightest, but there was always some strange appeal to the powdery rough texture, and how different the dust was from sand or flour or something else. It was hard and metallic and

was all Tony could think as people shouted for the man to stop or be careful.
A fury of nodding, like this explanation made much more sense than the previous one.
“My lawyers are no match for yours.  And oxtails are what they sound like: the tails of oxen.  You boil them, and the beef falls right off the bone.  They’re really fatty, but that muscle is never used, so it’s tender.  You pull out the bones and skim the fat, and add potatoes and carrots.  Done.”
“I have a family, I just told you.”
Romanoff was breathing heavily, but sounded ready to take on the world.  “How do we do this?”
“Now, sweetheart, we’re getting somewhere.  Get them on it right away.”
A muscle in Steve’s jaw jumps with every sentence, until the last, to which he whispers “Enough.”
“What was that all about?” Steve asked as he carefully approached his husband, who had turned back to the table and was gently caressing a lone test tube.  Tony’s shoulders were tense, matching the nervousness Steve felt.  He wasn’t alone in this, then.  “Is this . . . them?” he asked, pointing at the tube.
,” Steve says in wonder.

Highway 190 was not the most scenic of California highways, but it did have its charms.
, I’m gonna – I’m –“ Tony panted, face contorting with the effort to stave off his orgasm.
,” Steve looked at him, blue eyes pale and huge in the dark and Tony couldn’t breathe.  “Is that a bad thing?”
Tony can’t breathe still, but now it’s different, just physical, so he breaks away from Steve’s mouth to gasp.  Teeth, tongue, and lips remain in contact with his skin, suckling and biting along the sweaty lines of his throat.  There is sweat in his eyes, and it stings as he blinks, but he just groans “Right there” as Steve attaches himself to the rise behind his ear.
is the highest on my list of priorities right now,” Tony muttered, walking over and snatching up one of the sets of burgundy towels.
Wanting to get away from his current line of though, and to restart their conversation, Tony gestured at a group of people plucking grass and flowers in the nearby hills, far below.  “Are you preparing for a festival?”
And wow, that’s painful.  As if he’s ever been precious to anyone.
He frequently sees Steve lugging this specific sketchbook around, hauling it down to Tony’s workshop and drawing for hours, talking only when Tony comes out of his fog long enough to tell he’s down there.
“No, just get me to the nearest motel! Lock me in the room alone and don’t ask questions!”
The voice was Shapanka’s.
“Me?”  Tony was honestly quite mystified as to why Steve would care at all about his opinion, but then, he did seem to be putting Tony feet-first into the fire of kingly decision making.  “I, um, don’t know.  It seems a neat fix.  My main concern would be flooding and storms.”
“Oh no, this is much worse.”
So he has to pace himself.
The metal plates snapped off as the creature-thing when face up.  Stark shouted a warning, then shot a missile-type thing.  Steve had just enough time to raise his shield to cover himself and Romanoff before the projectile exploded.  The carcass went careening off of the side of the bridge.
Steve leaned back against the door, pulling Tony’s left hand up to his mouth, kissing the knuckle on the fourth finger, eyes impossibly bright.  “You’re the genius.”
He stepped back and sighed.  “You’re fishing.”
“And there’s one other person you’ve pissed off.  His name is Phil.”
, not really, not at all.  But he never woke up this warm.  Like,
“I’ll always forgive you, Steve. Now, if adrenaline is what you like, you ain’t seen nothing yet . . . .”
The guards disassembled to examine the vault door and make their reports, or else returned to their stations, giddy to share new gossip with other employees. Happy slid up beside Steve and Tony. “Boss, I swear you’re as nutty as him for lettin’ him go.”
“Stark Tower is about to become a beacon of self-sustaining clean energy.”
She tells him that, if he really wanted to, he could be a wonderful partner, husband, father.  But with someone who can appreciate sitting with him as he does his genius thing, someone who can handle being put on hold so he can work on the suit, someone who’s willing to be there with him, just there, and can be happy without getting angry at his distractions.  She never could  accept not having his full, undivided attention.
“‘And they imprint on the first person to show them any affection, mm-hm, okay, not at

He closed the door with a snap.
kids in a vague, idealistic way, but he never even entertained the idea of having any.  The board had dropped the topic of an heir very quickly, remembering that Tony’s own fucked-up existence was due to their predecessors demanding Howard produce an heir.  His succession plan was finding some young, underprivileged genius, promoting them and training them up as his eventual successor.
, but he cannot flinch away.
He had found love.  And he would never be out in the cold again.
.  He gingerly removed the corks from the perfume bottles and sniffed.  One had the spicy-sweet scent of cinnamon and almond, the other a sharp waft of mint.  Corking the mint and placing it back in the box, he then dabbed the other perfumed oil on his wrists and behind his ears, and rubbed a bit into his beard.
Steve didn’t seem to be up for much discussion, so Tony carefully sat down next to him and draped an arm around him, and very gently, began massaging his upper arm. Happy’s face had melted, if his disgruntled shouts were anything to go by.
He was the first in many things.  And apparently hearing children that could never exist was one of them.
“Send him up.”
The main town of Korkyra was located on a stubby peninsula that thrust out from the mainland.  A rocky outcropping at the tip was crowned by a few smallish, weather-beaten temples.  The town proper consisted of a small grouping of shabby but well-kept cottages and houses.  The palace, if it could be called that, sat high on the gentle slope that rolled down to the half-sheltered harbor.  It was certainly the largest building, and was slightly removed from the assortment of smaller houses and cottages.  There was no defined agora, just tables and stalls set up on the main thoroughfare.  There weren't even any city walls, only low gates and fences marking property lines.
As Steve turned to go, Tony’s voice flowed over his shoulder.
They’ve gone down that path before. Tony would never like to see a repeat.
So no one can see he might not be an impassive façade, he constructs one of his own.  It just so happens to fly and shoot bad guys.
“Equipment malfunction.” True enough. “Don’t worry about it.”
It was all so surreal.  He was having a better time adjusting to the knowledge that aliens existed and wanted to destroy the Earth better than he was responding to being in the twenty-first century.
“That’s fine, because I love to be handed things.  So, let’s trade.”  She took the tablet, then smoothly slid it to Tony, stealing his champagne.  “Thank you.”
“Why?”
you all recently?” Steve asks, though it just brings on another round of laughter.
He has a good poke around.  The bed doesn't seem to have a mattress; it's really just a mound of blankest in the shape of a bed.  His spine may not love it, but it is better than falling asleep on the ground.  There are chests stacked around the perimeters of the room hold an assortment of clothing and pretty much everything he could wish for.
He fumbled for a lamp and some sealing wax before she steadily lit the flame.  After a few moments he was able to press the carnelian stone delicately carved with a helm that was his signet ring into the soft wax.
“Oh, you know, pretty unexciting.   Get fish unstuck from the reeds, kill people who dare cross me or drink from me without permission.  Nothing nearly as interesting as what a hero-prince does.”
Mineral pyrite.  Iron sulfide.  FeS
Tony was still very relaxed from Steve’s earlier ministrations, and it only took a few perfectly placed strokes that had Tony hissing from sensitivity and begging Steve to fuck him.
“I missed you.”  And Tony wanted to scream.
Talking shop. This they can do.  “Are you going to get pissed if I tell you I can track him because of that stuff I breathed on him?”
Tony froze from where he was shoving a pink-and-orange striped sock between to cushions.  “Well, not many people do.”
“Traitor.  Steve loves my butt.”  Tony said, mildly affronted.  He threw the phone onto the glass coffee table, where it slid a foot before stopping.  “I can’t go to Camp Nelson.  Or my house in the mountains.”
As the door slams shit behind her, Tony turns back to Steve. “Why aren’t we invited to brunch?”
Something alights in her eyes, and she jumps up, scrambling for her phone. “Sorry, I just remembered that I have brunch plans with pretty much everyone that’s not you two.  Toodles!”  She’s texting furiously before she leaves the table, obliviously dripping creamer everywhere.
It always surprised him, how terrified prostitutes and dancers were when they woke up in his chambers, like they expected him to once again throw himself upon them.  Truthfully, he couldn’t bring himself to sleep with them sober.
“Tony, listen to me: you are a trailblazer, are you not? Mother has done her best to teach you about our lives, but you do understand it need not be
America".  Boiling hostility rolled off of Tony in crashing waves, but Steve stood in their onslaught, determined to see this out, to see where this led.
Not dirt.  Soil.
Tony nodded numbly, still staring at the forgotten tray like it held the secrets of the universe.  He swallowed audibly, Adam’s apple moving in a tantalizing fashion.  Steve had to restrain himself from covering it with his mouth.
He had never wanted them.  But now that he couldn’t have them, he regretted it immensely.  There would be no getting a son who spent his toddler years trying to find structural faults in the bulletproof windows by repeatedly hurling himself at them.  There would be no sitting with his daughter in his lap, her trying to wire a circuit board while he tried to distract her by demanding kisses.  There would be no using the arc reactor as a night light, there would be no buying Peter rare arachnids for his birthday, there would be no Maria to demand he sing “Maria” from

Steve sat up harshly, peeling blankets and sheets off this sweaty skin.  His breathing was heaving like a racehorse’s, chest presumably swelling and contracting to their extremes.  Tony stayed relatively still, kept his breathing even, knowing any comfort he tried to offer would not be welcome or appreciated.
“Feel me.”
“Steve,” Tony said gently, laying a hand on Steve’s bicep. He unfroze, but still looked very troubled. “Iron Man has left, but I can ask him to keep Shapanka on his radar, okay?”
“Is it the

“Do not be. We needed to know.  As soon as I leave here, I am going to contact all the shells I can and tell them to be on high alert.  Thank you for sharing this with me.”
“Oh, your friend has not told you? I must credit him for my grand discovery.  You see, I once met a man who looked much like Tony Stark, and I told him this.  And the man smiled with the pride only a father can have for his son.  Then he made his mistake.  I tried to apprehend him, and he fought.  And do you know what he turned into?”
Tony cautiously walked up the stone ramp, the room all dark wood and tall windows, shafts of sunlight capturing the dust motes in their stillness.  Steve was sitting in one of the many hard burgundy benched chairs, staring at a spot on the floor near his shoe.
want me gone,” he griped, but did as he was told.
.  It’s comfortable, in a way he never would have believed.  It’s something he refused to even believe in for so long, but it’s filling some empty space that always ached and he never understood why.
Well,” a wicked grin crossed Tony’s face.  “Got things to work out.  Problems.  See ya, Steve.”
Tony didn’t interrupt, so Steve continued.  “The island was, as I said, very isolated for a long time.  During Alkinoos’ reign, both the Argonauts and Odysseus landed here, and were shown excellent hospitality.  Word got around, traders added us into their circuits, immigrants arrived and quickly integrated.  Under Erskine, the island became much more Greek.  He also solidified the name of the island as Korkyra.  Some called it Drepane and others called it Scheria, some called it Phaeacia after Phaeax.  The people still call themselves the Phaiakes, but we remember his mother in the name of the island.”
“How are you handling it?” Steve asks unexpectedly.
He was turning into lap 313 when the unwelcome but unfortunately familiar vice-like squeezing clamped down on his chest. It was sharp and twisting, like a deadweight on his torso, numbness spider-webbing from his core. The rhythmic pumping of his heart slowed a few increments despite the sudden lurch of adrenaline in his system.
“Jarvis has been running it since I hit the bridge.  In a few hours we'll know every dirty secret SHIELD has ever tried to hide.  Blueberry?”
Tony snorts humorously.  “What, is that actually what you’re calling yourselves?  More uncreative than I thought.”  Steve frowns, but Tony plows on.  He reaches into the bag, pulling out a flat expanse of metal and plastic the size and shape of a standard notebook.  “Do you trust me?”
Whenever Steve gets called a drama queen, he glares at the speaker but doesn't actually
Natasha sighed, picked up the three empty mugs, and walked over to place them in the sink.  She then draped an arm around his slumped shoulders.  “Why do you keep trying to talk yourself out of this?”
“You may be a technological genius, but I’m a tactical genius.”  He moved away to dig through Tony's bedside drawer, nudging aside the red vibrator in favor of a half-used bottle of lube.  "Condom?"
“No limit,” Tony confirms.
which was a grayish beige, which Steve couldn’t see anyone actually wanting to wear, but it seemed Bruce appreciated the thought (he sometimes complained about how there was nothing for Bruce, only Hulk).
would never hurt him,
“Yeah.”  Steve wiped a hand across his face, blinking rapidly, obviously trying to wake himself.  “I was –“ he yawned wide, ridges on the roof of his mouth visible.  “Sorry.  I was looking more into the space program, and got Lovell’s book, and well, it’s a pretty good movie.”
if you’re telling me he can only have family.  He hasn't any blood family left.  The Avengers are his family, no discussion.”), Steve had taken the hard armchair next to Tony’s head, and hadn’t moved in nine hours.
“Can it, Zemo. What’re you up to?” Steve calls over the sound of Carol preemptively smashing all the remaining windows for some reason.  Maybe to prevent injuries if someone gets chucked through a window today.  It happens often enough.  The henchmen circling the perimeter are squealing and running for cover from the shards of glass.  Or maybe she’s just messing with them.  That also happens often enough.
Cap looked shocked.  “Well, uh, thank you, Stark.  I’ll look that up.”
“I wondered the same thing.  But then I considered, where do floods and storms come from?”   Tony shrugged in agreement.  “I guess the best thing would be to try, and if we get any signs to stop, heed them.  Very good.  Alright then.  History of Korkyra.  It starts in the very beginning.  The island has been inhabited for a long time, because after Kronos castrated his father Ouranos, his blood and, um,
“Trap door,” Tony reeled off. “He was down in the labyrinth, waiting for me to give him a tune-up. I went down, he came up.”
Clever calloused fingers that knew just what to do, when to twist and pull and add pressure and take it away to insure that Steve was driven mad.  Tony, more than anyone, could make Steve lose his mind, in the heat of an argument or the throes of ecstasy.
“I’ve made up my mind,” Howard declared as he poured some unwatered wine into his cup, covering a similar scene to that on the wall.  “I need an heir who knows how to handle himself.”
“Mmm-hmm,” Natasha kicked a wooden gate open, leading the way through a storage yard that seemed to wrap around the side of the house.  There were a few broken-down carriages, stacks of amphorae, crates of unknown contents.  Further down, a small hut seemed to protrude from the foundations, next to an area filled with several cots under an awning, like a field hospital.  “He likely would have been a pottery painter if he hadn’t gone off to war.  He still enjoys it, when he gets the time.”
“Tony, why are you always wearing sunglasses?”  The inquiry comes from the breakfast bar.  Steve’s eating a mixture of about a dozen scrambled eggs, fried kale, and bacon.  Instead of either hating modern food or forgetting the old, he mixes it and makes them feel like shit when he’s happy that he
Korkyra stood, brushing her tunic of invisible dirt.  “We cannot tell you how to accomplish this task, as you would not have truly completed this challenge on your own.”
Peter snickered.
He was gonna sound like a crappy romance novel:
Steve’s hands didn’t falter.  “And?”
Not that Tony intends to die on this journey. But it’s possible.  More than likely.  But if he does survive?  Who knows if he’ll be in any fit state to return to the Avengers.
The crackle of fire on metal makes him act.  He swoops out with a claw, hooking Steve by the shield harness on his back and takes off.  A decent-sized hole has burned through the sagging ceiling, and by pulling all six limbs close to his body, he flies out.
“What are you doing, Mr. Stark?”
Steve was fairly certain that he would never be fully used to Tony’s kisses.  Tony kissed like he lived – full of emotion, fill of fire, unapologetic.  He was tender and dirty, raw and unbalanced, clever, vulnerable.  He laid everything bare, held nothing back, because he knew he could with Steve.  It had been an interesting journey, falling in love, but with the twin’s careful guidance, they had found the qualities that made them a strong, successful couple.  Tony had been able to push away any emotional hang-ups and had steadily accepted that Steve had fallen in love with him for himself, not because they heard the same children.  The kids had only served to push them together; they probably would have eventually found each other without them.
There was a clip-clop of efficient heels and a familiar voice joining the conversation.
“Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Howard Stark!”
, it was always
forward.  “Bring these down to the kitchen when you’re finished, then meet me out in the back courtyard.”  She whooshed away again.
Okay, this gets dangerously close to song fic.  I wouldn't consider it one, but music plays a big part.
Natasha shrugged when he looked at her beseechingly after he got a load of the food available.
“That’s the thing, Cap.  You’re the idealist.  You have to be.  But someone has to be a realist.”
“Yeah, sure. What do you want to talk about then?”
“Bucky, shut the fuck up.”
Steve is helping an EMT with a puffing middle-aged asthmatic’s oxygen mask, but keeps glancing over at Tony with a look that always means “we will have words later” but for the time being, he’s in the clear.
After a few more moments, Steve tells him an address.  He somehow has a pen in his hand and is scribbling it down without even making the decision to.
Tony scrunched up his nose and went to glare at him, but Steve still hadn’t looked at him.  So he poked his thigh.  Steve sighed, and turned expectantly towards him.  “Why would killing me be counterproductive?”
“What the hell are you on about?” Steve screams at Zemo as he yanks at the fallen beam.
Maria sighed.
Natasha cocked her head.  “He doesn’t like it.  He spends a lot on buying and freeing people where he can.  His attitudes are rather . . .
need to start exercising some control over yourself
He grabbed his gym bag, and swung one of the punching bags over his shoulder.
“Oh, nothing. Just remembering how you said you got caught up in Iron Man’s business plenty. You weren’t kidding.” Steve smiled at him, indulgent and maybe a little longing.
Better to have their possible last words together cordial than a spitting fight.
“The palace.  I should think you would like to rest after your journey?”
“Well, I’m going to try and hit as many places as I can, and, well, drift where the gods will me.  It might be next spring until I return.  Unless I find someone new, then I will deliver them here with posthaste.”
in the lower, right-hand corner, and he had been so betrayed, felt so lied to, until he learned Captain America had a actual, real human person name.)
century history books on it supported that, but the large amount of gay porn had been news to Tony.  Especially how most of the videos stared short men with dark hair and beards, and there were one too many mechanic / guy-with-car-trouble-who-can’t-afford-to-pay-for-mechanic’s-services-and-offers-alternative-payment scenarios.  Tony’d had to jerk off twice before he confronted Steve about lying about not wanting a tablet.  Steve had let Tony rant for several minutes, a frustratingly indulgent smile on his lips, before kissing him to shut him up.
Tony cleared his throat. “Fellas? The race?”
“Alright. Up and at ‘em,” Steve orders, tossing a pile of towels and sweats on the coffee table. Tony makes a grunt of protest and scrunches up his face. Steve lets out a soft laugh and suddenly a hot, dry palm is pressing gently onto Tony’s forehead, and a thumb is brushing at the corners of his eyes. It’s nice. It’s always nice when Steve touches him. Tony enjoys touching Steve, but there’s something about Steve initiating the contact that makes him especially pleased.
friend.  I should have told you.  I know that.  But by the time there was any proof . . . we were watching it together.”
Five days without sex is not something most people would worry about.  Especially not single people.  And people in regular relationships?  Sex once a week is nothing to sneeze at.
“Clearance level?”
Tony laughed at the tiny cartoon Steve had made of “IV Man”, sitting in his hospital bed, trying to save the world while “Nutmeg” and “Patriot” nagged him to sleep.  He handed it to Pepper (probably to have it framed), and gifted Steve with an enormous glowing smile.
.  He just lay there, pinned by Steve’s arms and legs and eyes, watching as Steve fucked himself on Tony’s cock.
She rolled her eyes. “You’re not as secretive as you think.”
Tony huffed a tiny desperate laugh, looking at Steve like he was some fever dream.
Phasing back, for all his struggle with the initial phase, is laughably easy.  The fire within him dims and he shrinks, wings folding to nothing, and he is left standing there, human again but with knowledge and power bubbling in wait.
“And it’s coming.  No, Howard doesn’t know, but it’s coming,” Steve nodded at Tony’s look of incredulity.  “The war wasn’t ended on the best terms.  Salting the ground and making sacrifices to the gods only made our enemies bitter.  Bitterness bends minds and will make man do anything for revenge.  And we can’t fight these things the same way.  That’s where we come in.”
Steve would love to draw this place, Tony thinks idly.
Tony sighed, sifting restlessly.  “Whacha’ drawing?  Please tell me Captain America draws naked ladies.  Or gentlemen.”  He waggled his eyebrows.
“Circular?  I don’t get your little military hand signs, Cap.”
“Oh. When's the meeting?”
Fury leaned over the backs of their chairs.  “You’ll both have kids; it’s in your files.  Do this for them.”
Steve was already wearing sweats and a tee shirt when he strolled in at eleven, scrubbing his damp hair from the showers.
There was nothing Steve could
“Thanks, Pepper.”  He had JARVIS cut the call, then went about trying to find some sort of towel to dry Tony off.  There was drop cloth and raggedy bits of fabric everywhere, but Steve eventually found some old beach towels with Dum-E’s help.  He cut off the shower, and gently wiped the excess moisture from Tony’s stitches, before wrapping the genius in several towels and hoisting him up bridal style.
“Sounds like a plan.  Have fun.”
“Well,” Tony stood to join him as they walked over to the left wall.  “Using my terrific powers of deduction, I would assume Poseidon, Athena, and Artemis hold top positions in your pantheon?”
“Yeah.  You’ve seen that he’s had them framed?”
, but it was clearly Carol’s idea, carried out by Jan. Inside was a bronze coin, about the size of a half-dollar, beautifully engraved with
They were going through the traditional team banter, and after a few failed attempts at pulling Steve into the conversation, they gave up and accepted he was out of it.
Tony shifted in his arms, giving him a blissed-out smirk.  Steve would never

company. Steve was shockingly easy to talk to, if you put aside the awkward pauses and vague answers about Steve’s past, but then Tony wasn’t any better than when it came to skirting anywhere near Iron Man. But it wasn’t just that Steve was easy to talk to, but Tony found himself wanting to talk to him. He wanted to hear every one of Steve’s thoughts, he wanted to know if Steve agreed with him, he wanted to know if Steve thought he was doing the right thing.
Steve wouldn’t care what the media said, but Tony would.  Because he couldn’t stand the idea of people thinking they were together when they weren’t.
When some semblance of muscle control returned to him, Tony moved over to the bedside table and grabbed the wet wipes.
JARVIS sounded both accusatory and frustrated.  That made two of them.
“Look, Steve. I can’t explain it.  Well, I could.  But you would never believe me.”
The creature lets out a growl that reverberates through the chamber, its fine acoustics making the sound vibrate a hundred times over in his mind. This is laughter.
“I never assumed your father would be faithful.  What king doesn’t have his assortments of courtesans and slaves, solely for his own pleasure?  It didn’t bother me, as long as he remembered I was his rightful wife.”  She gripped his hand tighter.  “But he ignores me, and has his concubines serve me, and lets his bastards run free through my rooms.  You have told me that you wonder why I honor Hera, when she has not blessed me?  My sweet, she cannot keep her husband any more than I may keep mine.  But she has blessed me, more than anything else.”
“Speaking of that . . . .”  Tony buried his face in his hands, wondering how to bring this up.  “Do . . . do you think that . . . Howard . . . ?”
“Aw, Steve, lets us have our fun,” one of the others, Tydeos or Pemon, whined.  Everyone laughed.
Thor frowned again.  “When we would do those battles, we would roast game on an open fire.  Surely that’s not what you mean?”

“Sorry-“ Steve chocked out.  “Just need – ah – moment.”
ask questions.”  She gave him a conspiratorial wink, and swept away.
“I need to go to Iceland,” Natasha muttered.  “Then I could access his criminal record.  Stark, could you hook me up?”
Steve just nodded and turned to lead him out of the room.  “I think you’ll find they’re much closer than you could possibly think.”
Fury grabbed at his neck and tapped the edge of the suit.
Tony had very few (read: three) close friends before he met Steve.  Everyone else was either employed by him or were mere acquaintances he made out to be best friends in the world with in the media, when in reality he detested them.  As huge as the potential was, his life was very cut off from others.
They’d had sex no fewer than five times in the past twelve hours, but it didn’t feel like they were just using each other.  Not in the way that Tony pulled Steve’s arms around him as the fell asleep afterwards, not in way that warm sunlight had refracted in his eyes when they woke in the morning.
The room is opulent, but he can’t place the style. Its characteristics remind him of something Classical or Rococo, but not quite.  The wall is smooth stone, mounted with colossal mirrors and paintings in ornate frames and luxurious tapestries.  The paintings and tapestries depict natural landscapes, mountain and sea and desert, bereft of any animals or buildings.  No identifiable school to them, but Tony can recognize a decent hand when he sees it.  No windows, but warmly glowing orbs are suspended from the ceiling, high as the Capitol Rotunda above him.
He did.  The game sounded familiar.
He was warm.
“What, JARVIS?”  Steve knew he probably sounded rude, but if JARVIS couldn’t understand Steve’s frustration, he really was beyond caring.
Ilya is a nuclear engineer. Adopted at the age of five by an older Ukrainian couple, who made sure he went to the best schools and pursued an occupation that he was both good at and was important in the grand scheme of the world.  Tony has heard of him, even read a few of his papers, but their paths have never directly crossed.  The closest they’ve been is attending several conferences at the same time.  He divides his time between schools in Berlin and Kiev, and spends the rest working on behalf of the UN.
“Well, performance issues.  Not uncommon.  One out of five-“
It’s late, very late, the persistent buzz of midtown down from a dull roar to a faint whine. Everything is just a bright as it always is, but in the early morning hours, the city that never sleeps has a bit of a lull. Offices mostly empty for the night, save the few who toiled on, or brokered shady deals, or fucked call girls after calling home that they had to work overtime. The business world is filled with slime. He almost prefers villains.
“You’re gonna kill someone one of these days, Barton.”
The day was hot, the sun not helping, but there was a very brisk breeze that didn’t make Tony regret his windbreaker at all.  They held hands, which Tony loved and found ridiculous in equal measures.  But with no one to see them, he was content just to walk with his boyfriend through the ancient trees.
So when Steve moves into the Tower, and Tony sees him curled up in an armchair, sideways with his legs thrown over the side, a multimedia sketchpad on his lap, graphite stick and smudger in his fingers, Tony allows himself a moment to think “Well, they weren’t lying then”, and goes back to getting his coffee.
to return and live among my shell.  I can do whatever I want.  Our role is to protect Earth in the way we see fit.  And you and I have a pretty decent track record of protecting Earth.”
“You said you didn’t come up here to be attacked. Why did you, then?”
He groaned and buried his face in one of Pepper’s stupid throw pillows.  “I am the worst boyfriend in the world.”
“You’re catching on.  Now go.  We’ll have breakfast soon.  And Tony,” her green eyes seemed to spark.  “Maybe you need to learn that you’ll often find more information if you
Shapanka seemed to consider it. “Mmm, nice offer, Captain, but my, what will you use as your shield?” The man laughed, sending icy tendrils up Tony’s back. “Out of my way, fool! You’re so used to being on ice? Well, back you will go!”
He wasn’t overly sensitive to sunlight, as the lie he told people said.  Sure, they helped cope a bit with his waking up with massive hangovers and
.  No children demanding cuddles, no children to teach, no children to be better than him in every way.
“That, is an electromagnet.  Hooked up to a car battery.  And it’s keeping the shrapnel from entering your heart, hmm?”
.  “Who did this to you?  What did they do to make it so you don’t believe
The moment shattered as Steve deftly pulled the check from beneath Tony’s fingers and began to shred it. “I’m not accepting your money. I could, but I can’t. I didn’t save you in the hopes of a payday. It’s just what I do. What I used to do. What I’m
, you could say, a few weeks ago.”
Pepper snorted.  “Just as long as you don’t go out on your next quest without your tunic.”  And Tony had to laugh.
The agent had sent him a list of properties available, from decent to extravagant.  Tony picked one with space enough that they wouldn’t be tripping over one another, but at a price that wouldn’t give Steve the biggest heart attack.
“I’ve seen many wounds like that in my village.  We call them the walking dead, because it takes about a week for the barbs to reach the vital organs-“
, aren’t you?”
It was telling of how far gone he was, that he was still excited in some animal part of his brain to be in such close proximity to the object of his misplaced affections even when they were yelling at each other.
“No, Steve,” Tony allowed the figs and nuts to fall to the rock with the rest of them.  “Thank you, Nausikaa.  It means a lot.”
But knowing the realities of what Steve thought was also terrible, because Tony was selfish, and Steve had made it clear through action that if he felt he could be doing more good elsewhere, he would leave. No amount of fussing or cash would sway Steve from doing the right thing. And as much as Tony hated it, it was part of why he cared for Steve the way he did. Because Steve was true to himself, and didn’t bow for anyone.
been doing the past few days, mmh?”
“I can’t dance.”
hope they make an appearance
A couple of dockworkers reached out for the mooring lines, puling and twisting, and soon enough, Tony was standing next to Fury on the creaky boards.
“I hadn’t really thought about it. I don’t really notice I’m doing it.  But I think you might be right.”
“Because I love you.”  And with that, Steve sank down onto Tony’s cock.
“Well,” she shrugged his hands off her shoulders and moved to a mountain of pamphlets and paper instructions on the coffee table.  “Seeing as you will be taking over primary care, you should be the one to peruse the doctor’s orders.”
As always, if you're curious or confused about anything regarding the Greeks, customs, names, ect, I don't bite!
With Zoloto and Dikost and the rest of the shell, he learns the life of a dragon. The millennia-long lifespan, the different shells of the world, their place in the Earth’s order.
“We will proceed.”
an annoying voice supplied.
Everyone got into it, and it was . . . fun, Steve had to admit.  He didn’t like the crazy colors, but was willing to try the more muted, traditional colors.  Tony would try anything on the warm side of the color palette.   Sam liked anything bright.  Natasha liked anything dark.  Clint only wore purple, unless you painted arrow designs on.  Thor just picked the ones with the goofiest names.  Bruce liked calm colors.  Pepper refused anything that wasn’t a French manicure, but sat for hours letting Bucky practice.  Rhodey even got in on it, letting them do whatever.  It was taken advantage of all the time.
It’s been instilled in him to feign sleep for a few seconds to assess a situation for possible dangers. Usually he’s only at home, in his own lab or bed, so it usually passes.  Hotels take a bit longer, but he can usually place it after a moment or two.  The times he’s woken in a hostile situation has made the practice worth it, saving his own life and others countless times.

“<I could take you further in the summer>” he offers, but Tony waves him off.
Wordless, Steve nods, marking his place as he sets his book aside.  Tony spies the title.
, Stark.  My children were born, and now they are gone.  I’m going to see them now.”
“Thanks, Thor.  Just why
?” Tony asks, even though he’s scared for the answer.
“Not the slightest.”
And lo and behold, there was a stream in his path up ahead.
Tony looks, because he has no sense of personal boundaries.  Just ask Pepper.
.” Happy shrugged his shoulders uncomfortably. “That’s not the issue.”
It was funny, he pondered as he crashed through the dark corridors towards the vault block, heat from the chest lamp warming the entire chest plate, how needed Iron Man was despite the loneliness and thanklessness.
“Tony.” But Steve was laughing lightly.
“Not quite,” Steve said.  He put down his water jar and stood.  “A piece of advice.  They know more than you or I.  Don’t ask for too much clarification, because you won’t get it.”
Steve nodded morosely. “Don’t mention it.”
Maria, pain still emanating from her, cautious, allowed her warmth back in.  Steve was sobbing, now in relief.  He didn’t like the cold.
“Thank you, Tony,” Steve said breathlessly. And he meant it.
“WAIT,” Sam yelled back.  “YOU MEAN JUST CLINT, RIGHT?  THE REST IF US DIDN’T DO ANYTHING.”
“It keeps bad things away,” the girl told him confidently.
He can’t stop himself from drawing the man.
There was
The others were staring at them, but Tony didn’t care.

“I am Iron Man.”
"Watch it.  Soon you're gonna have Bucky and Natasha trying to induct you into their strange rituals."  Her eyes are shining a tad. “But really, that’s wonderful, Tony.  I know this has been difficult for you, but I am so happy for you.”  Her voice is lower than usual as she reaches out and squeezes his elbow affectionately.  She straightens, and nods to something over Tony’s shoulder, just as he hears a very familiar “
They paused by a darkened gift shop.  Steve saw several Hallmark card racks, “Get Well Soon!” balloons, teddy bears, and a bunch of chachkies covered in rhinestones and bible verses.  He shivered.  He made a mental note to bring Tony a tablet and a laptop.  Or get someone else to bring him one.
She frowned at him.  “You look like you’re going to have a stroke.”  She turned to Steve.  “Is he okay?  Can I throw things at him yet?”
Tony wanted to say.
But it’s too late for that.
“Nat and the guys say ‘Hi’. Clint has requested courtside Lakers’ tickets –
the Tony on the screen waxes, because that’s what he does. No matter how long Steve has known Tony, nothing can hold a candle to space and stars and distant worlds. Nothing. Must be something to do with the wonder of discovery.

The smith had nodded.
Tony couldn’t help but feel whiny at all her runaround.  “All anyone will tell me is the gods favor us.  Why am I not allowed to know more, and why is Steve the one who has to tell me?”
He was debating asking Steve to carry him when Clint shot back “NNNOOOOooOOOooo i tak it bak id suk ur dick if steebbe woodnt br8k my nek XP”.
There was a moment of silence, before Rhodey started clapping and room dissolved into raucous applause.
After that, they proceeded in a companionable silence which allowed Tony to scramble to come to grips with his situation.
“Hopefully the next will be better than the last.”  Tony glanced at Steve quickly, seeing a helplessly wide and optimistic smile.
He stands, and Steve stands too.  He takes a few steps, past the end of the table.  Steve follows.
“Are they little smart mouths?  Your kids would be.”  Bucky’s face was smiling, but there was a bitter twist to it.  When Bucky had woken up on his eighteenth, his mind was just as much of his own as it always had been.  Bucky had said it would be fine, that he didn’t really want children, but Steve could tell that Bucky wasn’t happy with having the choice taken from him.
Steve’s mind was filled with the memory of what he had seen in that drawer: a crimson vibrator and a half-used bottle of lube.
She had cried bitterly when, two months after her arrival, she received a letter from his grandmother, who informed her very gently that Uncle Peadar had passed, and had been sick for a while, but he had forgone medicine to save up for her passage to the States.
“Sir, it would be my honor.”
When Tony had made it to the docks, he had found them man waiting by the mooring lines.  He’d introduced himself simply as Fury.  He held allegiance with . . . no one, really.  Tony could remember the man speaking with Howard and Peggy at feasts, but he was not a regular feature of the court.  He didn’t seem to belong anywhere, roving from city to city and court to court.  So the information that the man worked, at least, in conjunction with Steve was more than he’d ever had before.
“Stay here!” the nameless solider shouted before being riddled like Swiss cheese.  Shafts of sunlight filled the Humvee from the circular holes.
, he’s the Icon, the Living Legend.
None of the records were digitized, so Tony was forced to spend several days in a mildew-y basement, digging through the musty boxes holding the records from the month before his adoption. There must have been some scrap of information Howard had missed.
Now the only time Steve goes near the couch in the workshop is when he’s fucking Tony into it.
“DUDE.  HE’S RICH AND GETTING HIS DICK SUCKED.  DON’T PLAY ME LIKE THAT.”
The media room had become “their” room, an even ground that neither had control over.  Tony’s workshop was that, Tony’s, and Steve always felt like a welcome guest, but not a native element of that environment.
Tony rubbed a thumb along the side of Steve’s hand.  “We’re in no hurry.  Just breathe.”  A thought occurred seeing Steve’s dilated nostrils.  “Any one smuggle any food in here?  Come on, no one pays any attention to those rules.”
a tiny voice whispered in the back of his head.
It wasn’t.  All the stresses and surgeries in the area had weakened the heart muscle.  The reactor, for all the weight in his chest, had acted as a sort of pacemaker.  Now they were keeping a close watch on both heart and liver, and debating having him get a conventional pacemaker implanted.  Tony had drawn up blueprints and made a prototype for an arc reactor-powered implant that would act as a pacemaker, defibrillator, and artificial heart pump.  He was just waiting for some time off to have it put in.
Why did it have to be this way?
“Shh, don’t tell the feds, and it’s for things we can’t do near major populations, and also cold weather testing in case we need to invade the Russians for some reason. And don’t think your cheek is going to get you anywhere, I’m onto you. But I travel around a lot, doing demos and such. You’re gonna see the world on my dime, Steve Rogers.”
She shook her head, crimson tresses illuminated by the early-morning sun.  “You’re a worrier.  Wonderful.  Like I needed another one of those.”  Natasha stared at him for a moment, like he was a particularly interesting piece of papyrus.  She seemed to take pity on him.  “He cares deeply for all of us, but I suppose he thinks you’re a special case.  The rest of us don’t have much riding on us.  You have a reputation as a hero already, and it is not at all insignificant.  But you’re not experienced in our world, and I think he is nervous that you might not take well to it.  He will tell you, knowledge is power, but it is also an incredible burden.  But once you enter our world, you will not be able to return.  I can’t tell you much but . . . .  The gods are with us.  I’m sorry I can’t say more, but it’s not my place.  Ask Steve.  He will do his best to explain.”
“C’mon, Steve. You can tell
Tony had the painting commissioned to hang in his offices to remind those who entered of his “close relationship” with the man in golden armor. “Yes! He . . . uh . . . happens to be a very good friend of mine. You might see him on occasion. He drops by frequently.”
“Sometimes there isn't a way out, Tony.”
The Quinjet landed on an aircraft carrier in the middle of the North Atlantic.  As they exited, a woman, petite and red-headed but with a stance that reminded him of Peggy, approached them.
, honey, plums, figs, raisins and other dried fruits, and fresh soft cheese.  Tony had never eaten much cheese as it was largely viewed as rural and military food, not exactly something for the king’s table.  But Clint teased him, so Tony tried a bit, and found he loved it.  He spread some on his barley cakes with a little honey and allowed himself to gorge a bit.  Less appealing was the milk everyone seemed to be enjoying.  Tony kept his cup filled with water.  He wasn’t
Steve frowned.  “That’s my job.”
“Which is?”
He felt horrible, like he was letting them down, but he wasn’t sure
“Steve Rogers, would you do me the honor of helping me save the world for the rest of time?”
He wipes is now-greasy fingers on his thick pants.  “I’m fine right now. Tell me more about . . . everything.”
Not things normal records usually include, but there were records of correspondence with

Natasha and Bucky would be laughing at him so hard.

“I, uh, took the
“Pedicure and all!  And now,” Tony aggrandized, obviously bursting to reveal the last set.  “Obviously, mine was best, but this one’s not bad.”
“Mr. Stark!”
“Not a great plan.  When they come - and they will - they’ll come for you.”
Suddenly feeling exhausted, he retorted with a brisk “What?”
and bonding.  Time with Howard usually boiled down to how disappointing of a son Tony was.
“Yes. I kind of live here as well. I have other houses and apartments around the city, but as I tend to fall asleep on a workbench or at my desk, I have a bit of a private apartment here. I’ll have a suite set up for you, until we can find you your own apartment. If you want.”
Howard held up his hand for silence and took a drink.  “This – this hero shit.  You don’t know anyone who is a proper warrior king.  That’s what you seem to be intent on becoming.  He’s offered –“ Howard pulled a scroll from his belt “- and you’ll do well to learn from him.  Knock some humility into you.  If I keep letting you go on these quests, your ego’s only going to inflate even more, and that’s not what I need in an heir.  No, I’ve made my decision.  I’m sending you off to Korkyra.  Now get out of my sight.”
“No!” he was screaming.  They were
” He stared at Tony in incredulity. “Is that how much you think your life is worth?”
“I need to know more about what he knows. Got an intel raid in the works?”  Steve nods and pulls up a map on the glass tabletop.  “We’re shooting blind here, so I just want to know as much as possible before we go deeper.”
“Mr. Stark.”
, like Tony is something he could very easily break, but finds too precious to handle roughly.
Steve threw his head back before pressing his smile to Tony’s.  “Deal.”
They burned, bright, too bright.  Like phosphorus sesquisulfide and potassium chlorate.  A little friction, and they were set ablaze.
“Please.”
“Wanted to.”  Tony snuggled closer.  “Steve,” he sighed.
“The skyline.”  Steve supplied.  “Mapping the changes.  Easier than the changes in people.”
“I’m sure they’re easier to carry,” Steve ignored Clint’s stuck out tongue.  “Metal cans don’t travel very well, but we managed.”  He smiled evilly at Clint.
insisted on bottoming, he rarely plunged in two fingers before he had Tony pinned to the bed, rising up and down on Tony’s cock.  Savoring and throwing his head back, alternating between moving languidly and making sure Tony hit his prostate, and ramming himself down so fast Tony felt the bed would break.
trailed out.  She cut the connection just as Clint was saying,
Because maybe he can prolong his path to non-existence.
He told himself to tamp down on his libido, he was dying for chrissakes.
It’s prickly question. Or at least, is to Tony. Because what can he say? He didn’t want to be faced with the icon of righteousness while laid low? That staving off the liquor was better than facing a mad Cap? Or worse, disappointed? That all Tony really wants is to crawl into a bed that has been warmed by Steve? That in some twisted part of his mind, he thinks having Steve’s love will cure Tony?
Steve couldn’t stop his fingers from smoothing back the hair from Tony’s forehead.  It was a smidgen too long; he would need to get it cut soon.
Everyone seemed to know the family, and were asking a bunch of questions, about how healthy the boys were, if Bruce was sure her bleeding was permanently stopped, if the woman’s sister was still going to marry such-and-such.  As far as Tony could tell, the community on the island was very small and interconnected.  So another way he was different.  The only people he knew were the ones he had met that day.
And so is Tony.  So maybe they can grow something alive together.
Tony sat on their bed, curled in on himself.  Waiting.
But he wasn’t going to stop them, he vowed to himself as he waved at a group of old women pouring libations at a tomb, who promptly dropped their wine and put their heads together to discuss the most recent development in the world of news.
“Tony – “
Steve would be bringing him to be introduced to legendary figures in the island’s history.
Steve sighed.  “I would say chatter, but why do you hate the lizards, Clint?”
Women and men fall over themselves, and into bed with him.  They don’t really look at him, seeing only momentary pleasure and a possible payoff.
“So, you wanted to get me away from him.  Why didn’t you just return to Athens in person?  I’d have stowed away even if he said no.”
Maybe he was.
She always understood him, so he thinks she'd want him to search for his birth family.  Because she would know that not knowing would make him want to peel his skin off.
He put his loneliness from his mind. There was a race to win.
Because Howard had never heard Tony’s voice.  When his mother went to his father so happy that she had stopped hearing Anthony’s voice, he had thrown a chair against the wall, thinking she had had an affair on him.  After it had been proven that she didn’t, their marriage was still over.  Howard had played no part in raising him.  Fate had known he’d be absent in his son’s life.  And insured it.
It took all of his restraint not to pull all of the wires and tubes and monitors out of Tony when Steve first entered Tony’s hospital room.  When Pepper had authorized their entry (“You must be
Steve looks up from where he’s hunched over on the picnic table.  The wood was painted red at one point, but sun exposure has bleached it to make it oranger and clay-colored.  There’s some sort of book in Steve’s hands – looks to be history.  Not unusual.  Steve’s hair is different, longer and softer, curling a tad at the ends.  He needs a haircut.  He’s never known Steve to need a haircut.
Why was Tony so forbidden?
They looked at one another for a full five seconds before dissolving into laughter.

“What?  We agreed we wouldn’t –“
Tony’s mouth had fallen open into a perfect little “O”, but he quickly snapped his mouth shut and stared over at the soup.  “So you
Lykabettos wasn’t a proper mountain.  The ranges around Athens were full of activity, from the quarries and woodsmen and hunters.  Lykabettos was just outside the city walls, but was so steep, it had much less tactical value than the lower acropolis.  It was more of a hill really, and was deeply forested. No good for looking anywhere but up.  There were some shines there, and wolves were said to roam.  Dangerous, supposedly.  But it was a popular place to rendezvous away from prying eyes.  The views of the stars were excellent, but most of the young men who frequented the place were more focused on beauties of a more carnal sort.
They were in the kitchen, Steve at the stove and Tony sitting on the counter next to him, Captain America socks dangling a foot off the ground.  Steve had complained that Tony
There were a billion tiny specks of light, but it wasn’t like how stars looked from Malibu or the Sierra Nevadas.  There, stars looked like someone had stuck a pin through black paper and shone a light through.  Here, the stars appeared to breathe, bleeding and sifting in on one another with the gauzy haze of the Milky Way overlaid across the expanse.
Steve shook his head.  “You’re right.  Maybe we’ll both luck out, and get to choose someone we actually love.”
Kevin Bacon snorted.
She paused, and it was deadly quite on her end of the line.
“I’ll forward the invite.  See you tomorrow?”
“Okay, I have to know,” Tony said over Steve’s guffaws.  “What’s the circumference of this island?  Because you’re obviously a maniac.”
the voice whispers.  It sounds old, like Steve telling stories of the war, but even older.  Like a voice emanating from the deepest bowels of time.
The World Security Council had consented to releasing the Tesseract into Asgardian custody (obviously still smarting after the whole “Nuke Manhattan” thing), as well as Loki, as Asgard was believed to be better equipped to control both.  Tony could tell Fury wasn’t pleased with losing his toy, but he didn’t do anything outside of his usual glowering as they loaded the Tesseract into Thor’s handy-dandy transport tube.  Thor nodded in acknowledgement of them all then twisted his end, and he and his brother disappearing in shafts of blue light.
that.”
Maria had supplied when they were looking into a ring for Steve.  By that time Tony had already been wearing the vibranium ring that Steve had proposed with, after careful instructions from Maria on how to scrape off enough metal from the shield and not compromise the structural integrity.
“You’re astute, aren’t you?  But you’re assuming she’s a slave.  Natasha isn’t a slave.”
was the olive drab of the 1940’s dress uniform,
“I don’t mind.  They seem like they’d be good for a beginner.”
Never mind that Tony wouldn't have paid any attention to the order even if they were still on decent terms.
“He has his heart on someone already.”
.  Why?” Tony popped up, catching sight of Steve staring down wistfully at the Google search results.  “You haven’t been there.  Why would you care?”
It was sad, because Steve would make a great dad.  But like Bruce, there were genetic concerns, and an adoption agency wasn’t likely to approve a single guy who was constantly jetting all over the world to punch people in the face.
“I don’t think I have a choice.”
Tony stopped trying to burrow into Steve’s shirt.  “You little shit.”  The door opened before he could get farther.

“Not it!” Clint, Sam, and Natasha shouted at the same time.  Bucky swore.  Steve just rolled his eyes.

So he knew how to be naked in front of people.  But standing here with Steve, just the two of them and the sea, made Tony feel more vulnerable than usual.  Maybe it was because Tony was usually the most beautiful person in the room, maybe it was because this wasn’t a group setting with people he’d known for years.
