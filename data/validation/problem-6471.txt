On the second day, he talks to Pepper, talks to Rhodey, talks to Happy, talks to Pepper again. Debriefs with Hill. She had his back out there; he can't thank her for ordering the kid's assassination, but she was willing to take out Tony himself when it counted, and that more than anything secures his esteem. He already respected Hill, but now he thinks he might be willing to trust her.
"That defense always holds up in court." Three people are dead. That guy Steve was trying to help, he might lose his leg. What else can they do but joke about it?
Tony shoves back from the table, sends his chair wheeling across from the room until he's far, far, far away enough to shoot to his feet without standing chest-to-chest with Steve. He runs his hands through his hair, over his beard, and ends up with them in his pockets.
"Sue and Steve working together makes the resistance too erratic to predict." Reed captures one of Tony's knights. "With Captain America as their figurehead, a group that might have been no more than a localized resistance has turned into a national movement. You know what will happen if we allow this to go on any longer."
"More weight," she agrees. "Every time they asked him the question that could save his life, he refused to speak except to ask for more weight." She pauses. "It's somethin' to think about."
Tony once had shrapnel edging so close to his heart that most of the country's best surgeons deemed surgery to remove the fragments too risky to attempt. He understands the feeling of having a sharp shard of metal cut picometer by picometer through flesh and bone. This hurts in a way that is different but no less excruciating—a pain that comes from hearing exactly what he wants to hear despite knowing that it's a lie.
"There's something. It's right there. It feels familiar." Tony can taste it on the tip of his tongue. There's a state he can reach under certain conditions of deprivation, a state that sits on the tip of his tongue like grace and arcs connections like lightning. He remembers that state of grace the way a man standing at the bottom of a black oubliette remembers a distant slice of sky. Maybe he's too comfortable here. Maybe he isn't hurting enough. "Someone changed her on a cellular level," he says. "Someone tried to overwrite her," he says, "someone tried to
TS: There's another concept known as the "bleeding edge." Not just the most developed applications, but the most visionary, the most prescient. The kind of innovations that eventually become the cutting edge, after the risk recedes and the cost-efficiency is proven.
three levels instead, but there's a lot to be said for the added security of being buried seventy feet underground. Function over form, safety over inspiration—which is a joke, Tony's never needed sunlight for inspiration, he built his greatest work of art in a cave. Sometimes he had to hold a flashlight between his teeth while he worked on the finer points of the Model I.
And then he pours the bottle of whisky down the drain. The smell lingers. It's rich and sharp. Deep enough that he can imagine the weight of a mouthful. When the bottle is empty, he breaks that, too. It takes him a while to find a broom and dustpan, but eventually he locates them in a cabinet by the sink. He has to make three trips to the trash can before he's sure he swept up all the glass shards. When you can't help anyone else, the least you can do is clean up behind yourself.
There's nothing in the Constitution about the right to put on a mask and beat people up in the street, even if it's for a good cause.
In a subjective sense it feels like months since he was last in Avengers Tower. He's been spending time in D.C., time in his workshop, time in the loft in lower Manhattan. The tower is empty. Carol has her own apartment; Jan has her own penthouse. Tony isn't sure about the rest of them. They aren't a team, not really. All they are is a holding pattern, a suggestion that might one day evolve into a functional whole.
The super-soldier serum was the holy grail, and men would lay down their lives in pursuit of it. The one successful application was six feet two inches and two hundred twenty pounds of all-American ass-kicking; he might look like a nice boy, but that didn't mean he was one. Good luck getting a blood sample out of
The only official statement comes from the office of President Yann Pujol. The press release expressed condolences for the families of the deceased and confirmed that the Strategic Hazard Intervention, Espionage, and Logistics Directorate was heading an investigation.
The first thing Iron Man does is recalibrate his sensor arrays to recognize Sue Storm's particular signature. She can't be detected by conventional means, being truly invisible in an electromagnetic sense, but she does leave certain traces—she's invisible, not intangible, even if her ability involves the manipulation of cosmic energy. He doesn't run his calibration past Reed; they can't afford distraction.
The blaze is on the horizon: a red smudge against the sharper lights of the city. Behind it he can pick out the flashing strobe of fire trucks.
When Tony was a kid, he lived in the Air & Space Museum. Not literally, except for the one time he'd given his au pair the slip and spent a memorable night dreaming about chemical propellants while slumbering next to a space shuttle, but every time his old man caught a flight to DC, Tony begged and begged to be brought along. He usually begged his mother, who was sometimes sad or distant but who was never cruel; but if he was desperate enough, he would approach his father. It was worth it. It was always worth it.
They're right in the most base and pedantic sense. The SRA's preferred terms are "extra-legal peacekeeper" (frequently shortened to "peacekeeper"), "parahuman", "metahuman", and of course the titular "superhuman". It uses these terms in incredibly specific ways; they are neither broad nor interchangeable.
Tony hangs around to pester her. He and Steve supervise the next generation of Avengers. Howard Stark rolls over in his grave and nobody cares. It's a good What If. It's one of his favorites. All the best people are there.
They crash into the conference room together, grappling, until Steve manages to get Tony in some kind of hold that makes him incredibly, exactly aware of how delicate the bones in his wrist and elbow are. A little more force in one direction, and Tony will become double-jointed against his body's will. He mule-kicks blindly, catches Steve off-guard enough to scramble away—past the crumbled outer wall and the empty window frame and out into the garden.
"Funny," Steve says. "Could've fooled me. I've heard enough." He picks up his shield, doesn't bother yanking his cowl over his face.
other person is too many. Some futurists disregard possibilities with low probabilities, but Tony knows better. He plans for every disaster.
"So far the only bodies we've found are people who escaped," Tony corrects. "And we can assume that the kidnapper is using those people as test subjects."
I'd call local law enforcement the real heroes. No, no plans to force them into conflict with resistors. They're overworked enough, and confronting those with extreme abilities demands an extreme response team. SHIELD is exploring further options.
"None of us doubt that the superhero community is necessary or wanted. The rise of super-powered terrorists and dictators and our planet's recent introduction to extraterrestrial nations make their contributions even more crucial, and—personal sidebar—I can't think of anything more American than a single individual standing up every day to make sure the people around them are safe.
"For that reason, HomeSec and Registration have the full support of Stark Industries. Ladies and gentlemen, I remain in your service. Do with me what you will."
"All play and no work makes Jack a dull boy," Tony says. "What's up with the night owl routine? Still on Madripoor time?"
"Kid, you're not going to walk away. I may not have the armor, but SHIELD's on your tail now, and they'll run you to the ground if you try to escape."
"Because something's changed," Steve would correct, and Tony would lean his hip against his workbench and marvel at how the air felt on his open, exposed skin. There'd be only a thin shirt between him and the rest of the world, and Steve wouldn't have looked at Tony like Tony deserved to die, and Tony would never have begged him to finish it, because Tony wouldn't have been selfish enough to believe he deserved an escape from the consequences of his own actions. It's the most pointless, the most unprofitable, and the most painful kind of What If: the What Could Have Been. Except who is Tony kidding, they were always going to end up here, and there was never a world in which Steve would've looked at Tony in the way Tony wanted. It's the worst kind of What If. It's the kind that crawls out of people who try to pack their hollow insides with mimicries of feeling. Tony knows what he is. Eventually, his self-knowledge will be perfect.
And over and over again, there's one thing Steve came back to. Furrowed in concentration, slack with shock, lit up with anger and with joy—at rest, in thought, with sorrow—over and over again, Steve came back to Tony's face. The range of emotions, the nakedness, is terrifying. Being seen is always terrifying. This is a march of what Tony has tried to excise, all the human flaws and human sins he's learning how to code out of himself.
"And what about the political side?" Hill asks. "The public's still divided. If the Act gets repealed as quickly as it passed, we'll be dead in the water."
"SHIELD provided an affidavit stating that he wasn't acting under his own control. It won't stop our stock from plummeting if the media ever gets the full story, but at least he won't go to jail."
Friday's hologram promptly flickers into existence in the center of the elevator. Today she's wearing Data from
After midnight, when Tony has finished a preliminary inspection and conferred with the fire captain, they'll all go home together: Tony and Carol, Jess and Jenn, Jan and Steve. Clint tries to convince the rest of them to stop for pizza on the way back. Hank carefully scoops up a moth with a bent wing and carries it back to the quinjet with cupped hands.  The Vision, in one of his curiously old-fashioned gestures, offers Wanda a hand to help her up the plane's ramp. Steve claps Tony on the shoulder as he passes and asks if he's heard from Rhodey lately. Tony takes off his helmet and follows. There is no Registration Act, because none is required.
VP: It's what he'd want. There's no reason to drag this out and make him suffer. You can make it an equipment malfunction. Or not. You can fool the monitors. Maybe he just fades.
"Regulation," Tony says. "It'll come as an offer of resources at first—better equipment, faster response from support teams, social services, health care."
BOWMAN: I don't care about that. It's enough that they survive. In the meantime, we can alleviate suffering on a massive scale.
In the What If he builds as he looks down at New York, he is excised of all weakness. The only sentiment he retains is a benevolent belief in the future of humanity, a hollow golden glow that encompasses the perfection of his reason. He is not an alcoholic, not an addict, not prone to obsession at all. He understands everything that has happened, sees with flawless clarity what is to come. He acts according to the greater good. He sublimates the self. He engineers himself into the armor.
"Good to know you're still alive in there," she says. "I thought I was playing all these old recordings to an empty shell."
"So what you're saying—" Lila waits to make sure he's done bickering with Rhodey, as if he could ever be done bickering with Rhodey. "You're saying that you make consumer electronics to pay for your research guys to develop weird stuff."
STARK: I've known Reed since we were both knee-high to an undergrad, and Sue's been very welcoming to me.
Renada had been linked to multiple terrorist groups through Europe and the Middle East. The FBI believes his extensive organization is responsible for redistributing arms stolen from the United States military to groups including Advanced Idea Mechanics and the Sons of the Serpent.
Despite all of that, when he saw Steve leap out of the helicarrier six miles above the ground, he thought he was having a heart attack.
Friday pauses, and in that pause Tony reads her pleasure at having her own told-you-so moment. "Unfortunately," she says, "unfortunately, it seems like the former Director of SHIELD saw fit to upgrade SHIELD's equipment to better detect advanced camouflage. For instance, the sort of stealth capability built into every iteration of your armor other than the most recent."
The genesis: when he was still staring down Afghanistan in his dreams every night and refusing to admit the strain during the day, and after pulling Steve from the ice he became so wrapped up in convincing Cap that the here, now, this future that wasn't a future at all except in the relative, was worth something.
BOWMAN: That's the next stage. When I can consistently achieve more stable results, we'll broaden our criteria.
Of course, after all that primordial nucleosynthesis came the dazzling part, the stellar nucleosynthesis that produced the fun heavy elements: carbon, neon, oxygen, silicon. All those luminous stars still tick-tick-ticking away in the heavens are actually crushing themselves heavier and heavier as they blaze. The biggest stars, the ones that explode into supernovas before they collapse, produce iron.
What is he like? Tony hasn't let himself wonder, but the Doctor Yinsen he knew was a good man, a great man, a humanitarian and a pacifist, but a realist, too. Tony still misses him, sometimes, when it's late and he's alone; he and Yinsen used to talk for hours, for days, holding discussions that meandered in and out of the more important conversation of survival so elaborately they would have been opaque to anyone else. Tony wants to talk to him again. Maybe it's only the illusion of forced intimacy that he misses, though; maybe Yinsen wasn't as accepting as he seemed. Maybe it was only that Tony felt he could finally, at the end, stop pretending.
It's right there, on the tip of his tongue, but the connection isn't coming. He has all the pieces but none of the insight required to string them together. Steve stares back at him, impassive; there's the clarity he requires. Meanwhile Tony is carrying the kind of tiredness that leeches meaning and color from the world around him. He no longer has the energy to censure himself for wanting to sleep. He just wants to be done. Is that so much to ask?
despite any evidence whatsoever—just another comorbid condition, just one more thing to excise from Tony Stark 3.0. Now he has no problem with the reality of it. Of course he doesn't. He could fuck a man if he wanted. He could fall in love with a man if he wanted. He could fall in love with a man if he didn't want, could find himself in a one-sided love story without his consent.
"Good," Tony says. "Go. Get. Smack them on the nose with a newspaper if you have to." She leaves, already on the phone before the elevator door can close on her; there's enough time for her to roll her eyes at Tony before she's out of sight entirely.
"You work too hard," Stevie says, but for once she's not being bossy about it. "Remember when you were coding Friday? I don't think you slept for a week."
What people neglect when they talk about alcoholism is the genetic component. He doesn't use that as an excuse for his own personal shortcomings; but perhaps it offers an explanation for how easily he slid into it, how covertly but thoroughly the addiction took over his life. It took him out of his head. If there's one place Tony Stark has always been desperate to go, it's out of his head.
I ask Stark about his efforts to reach out to Yinsen's family. He smiles again. "They don't want to talk to me," he says. "I can't say I blame them."
"Yinsen saved my life half a dozen times," Stark says. "That isn't exaggeration. He was one of the most brilliant men I've ever met, and coming from me, that's saying something. Medicine, biomechanical engineering, physics—he was straight out of the Renaissance.  He was a damn good chess player, too. Like to start with black." Stark chuckles and flashes the warm but practiced smile of a businessman. "I used to think he wanted the handicap."
"There's always another way," Steve says, stubborn, because he's the real kind of hero, the kind that's solid all the way through, the kind that doesn't have any hidden hollows where he stores his machinations.
"Do you know how many patents I had by the age of twelve? Neither do I, but it was a lot. C'mon, let me give her that chance."
TS: Yeah, well, if we want turn the place into an emergency refuge, we have to prepare for everything, and there's no telling when the latest Ultron wannabe is going to go after the power grid.
"It means something that I'm saying this in front of him," Pepper goes on. "I want you to know that."
"Tony," Pepper says. She has Happy with her. Great. He can't remember the last time they double-teamed him. It's never as fun as he's expecting. At one point he thought it was great that his personal-assistant-chauffer-bodyguard married his executive-assistant-life-coach, but it turns out that marriage has only made them better at waylaying him.
BOWMAN: Of course, but it's also absurd to pretend that we don't have enough data to move forward. Don't mistake me. We won't stop testing, but I am not going to put this operation in jeopardy merely because you want to replicate predictable results an additional hundred times.
At one point, Steve had been one of the people running security checks. He liked to keep an eye on anyone around or in space that the Avengers used, "and that means your quarters, too, Tony," which was laughable in light of Tony's penthouse being little more than a glorified dressing room, touching in the way that Steve's gestures always were, and painful in this newer and harsher existence. Now, Tony runs security checks on his people to make sure they weren't sent by Steve.
Tony plays What If the way some people play chess: to sharpen his instincts, inure him to his flaws, and develop his ability to value strategy over sentiment. In older days he used it as a catharsis, the sort of emotional release he denied himself in the real world because Tony's real-world releases tended to be messy and involve far too much fallout. Now he doesn't drink, doesn't dream, doesn't waste time building castles in the air. It's locked down. He's in control. He's taking responsibility.
Trouble in the ranks? The matriarch of America's first family of superheroes, New York's very own Susan Storm, is (apparently!) spending some time abroad. "She's in Atlantis," our inside source reports. Catching up with an old friend or visiting a new lover? "No comment!"
"I'm sure." Stevie sets the kettle down, braces her right hand against the countertop, and swivels her hips so she's facing Tony. Tony takes an automatic step back, aware that she's too close. "I can tell," Stevie continues. "You know how your mark—" She catches herself, and says, apologetic and not a little rueful, "Sorry. Guess you wouldn't know. Not like I'll ever meet her, anyway. The odds are against me on that one." Because there are so many people in the world, she doesn't say, and so few of them have soulmates. Because
Reed hasn't continued. He's still looking over the blueprints, probably studying Tony's electronic protective measures. It's crazy to think that Happy's blood is on the paper, but there's a smudge in one corner, right next to Reed's forefinger, that almost looks like—but then Reed sweeps his hand over the paper, and the eraser shavings drift to the floor. Reed's not talking because Reed is lonely. He's alone. He's not like Tony, accepting of company but ultimately the sole occupant of his workshop sanctuary. Reed has family. Reed needs his family. He's admitted as much to Tony before.
It happens fast. Maybe forty-five seconds elapse from the time the helmet comes down over his head. Maybe less. No more than a minute.
"We almost started without you," she says. There's an empty chair between her and Steve, who sits at the foot of the table. Jan's at the head. Clint, Monica, Jessica, Luke, and Adam take up the rest of the seats. Natasha and Peter are absent.
Everyone likes to focus on the neural interface that Extremis wrote into him, but that's not the only perk. The virus restructured his thought patterns, too; not all of it's conscious, but he can problem-solve at teraflop speeds now, at petaflop speeds, more parallel processes than most people can comprehend. He can think about the garage while he misses the Mansion while he tracks the progression of the Registration Movement while he gripes to Carol while he tweaks the cloaking shield on the Model 29.
In 1945 Steve Rogers, through a combination of factors that made lightning strikes look common, was lifted outside of time. Some decades later, he was pulled from his rest and made to resume living in a world of linear cause and effect. Tony can't imagine the shock of that, can't imagine how badly Steve must have wanted to return to sleep. When he'd passed, it only seemed fair to return him to the one place he'd known peace.
NB: Hell, if you can figure out what happened we'll appreciate yours. Grif's a good guy. Kind of a grouch, but a good man.
Absolutely not. The job of any—let's say "extra-legal peacekeeper", since some of my friends aren't comfortable with the term "superhero"—the job of any peacekeeper, whether they're keeping robbers from knocking off some 7-11 or going toe-to-toe with big boys like Kang, is to serve the best interests of their community. Part of that, of course, is gauging the immediacy and severity of a particular threat, which is why I'm working so closely with the Registration Oversight Commission to ensure that no superhero is prevented from taking necessary action by red tape, but serving the community means respecting that community's laws and their wishes on what those laws should be.
"My current pursuits include playing the stock market and finding rare recordings of early jazz musicians. I am looking into global domination as a side-project."
Tony shrugs a shoulder and comes around to the other side of the couch. "Too tired to sleep," he admits. It's maybe more than he would have given anyone else, a nod to the laundry list of defects he has yet to solve.
Tony closes his eyes so he doesn't have to watch the team leave. When he opens them again, Rhodey's still there.
"I didn't say he wasn't," says Maya. They had—this isn't common knowledge outside of a certain academic sector, and there it had ascended beyond legend into myth—met while both were under the tutelage of Sal Kennedy, who had believed that his two awkward, undergraduate prodigies would shape the world to come. Sal's field was biology, but his interest was in systems of thought; although only Maya and not Tony had followed him into the life sciences, they had both looked to him as a model of reason and passion. To say Sal is disappointed in their respective divergent career choices understates reality by a factor of infinity.
The Avengers are not only one of the most prominent but also one of the most diverse superhero teams on the global stage. Members have included not only parahumans like the Scarlet Witch, metahumans like the Wasp and the Black Panther, and garden-variety humans like Hawkeye, but also aliens and fully-synthetic androids. What about the heroes that exist in that more nebulous area, though? Who are they, and by what names do we know them?
"It's the cycle of promising to get better that's the hardest to deal with," continues Sue, who sounds like she knows something about addicts. "But no matter how hard they try, alcoholics always manage to make everything about themselves."
JK: This is a time of transition. We're bringing in some new advisors, some guys who can give us outside opinions. In the meantime all you have to do is sit tight while we handle the situation.
"Okay," Carol says, willing to maintain that polite fiction. "Then make sure Hill didn't booby-trap it."
"You're not okay," Rhodey says. "I don't know what it is, man, but something is wrong with you. You haven't picked up a fatal heart condition again, have you?"
"Fine," says Carol. She pivots and falls into step beside him as Hill leads them to a conference room. "Jenn's on temporary leave. Something about a family problem."
He's curled on his cot in the corner, forehead nearly pressed against the wall; he feels slow when he wakes up. Tacky. Like part of him is missing.
Behind his back, the elevator doors roll open to reveal one of the most advanced, certainly one of the most fun, and undoubtedly one of the most impressive personal workshops in the world. The showcase, of course, is the half-circle of cases around the perimeter of the shop housing every intact and retired iteration of the Iron Man. He's got a couple of his favorites pulled out for display; on the landing just outside of the elevator is the old Model 16, posed with one palm facing out in his signature stance.
There's a long pause. Despite the threatening tidal wave of despair, Tony's pulse beats out a slow, steady beat. All thanks to Extremis: he has the heart of a super-soldier.
So. It was raining the day of the funeral, and 2.5 million people lined the avenue from the Capitol Building to Arlington National Cemetery. They were universally soaked through, shivering, and miserable. I wish I could say that they bore the conditions without complaint, that each and every person present was devoted to paying respect, not making spectacle, but that wouldn't be the America I knew, and it wouldn't be the America Steve Rogers knew either. Of course people were complaining about the weather, and arguing about politics, and talking about how expensive hotels are in D.C., and polling each other to see who says 'soda' and who uses 'pop,' because if you put ten Americans in a room you'll end up with twelve opinions about any one topic. Some of the arguments were ugly. Some of them made me ashamed to call myself an American. Some of them would've made Steve Rogers ashamed to call himself an American, too. It was an honest sort of ugliness. It showed exactly who we are, as Steve Rogers knew us, and as we know ourselves.
Rhodey's right. It isn't fair to put that on her. She's a kid. He'll give her a couple of new supercomputers instead—she always gets a kick out of that, likes seeing if she can reverse-engineer the hardware.
That Dr. Yinsen was able to survive for three months in such mean conditions is a testament not only to his strength of character but also to his resourcefulness. He was carrying out humanitarian work in a small village when it came under attack from Ten Rings; a local informant identified him to the leaders of the terrorist cell, and he was taken captive to serve his jailers in whatever way they deemed necessary. Shortly thereafter, Stark was captured from the convoy carrying him from a U.S. Army forward operating base to the testing ground for one of his more recent weapons contracts. Details about what happened next are hard to come by; most of the reports on Stark's captivity remain top-secret.
For almost a full decade, Tony walked around with a bum ticker in his chest. He walked like a real boy and talked like a real boy, but his insides were made of tin. He knows what it's like to live through arrhythmia and myocardial infarctions and good wholesome old-fashioned heart failures and even the total absence of a flesh-and-blood heart, although it's been years since he had to worry about any problems and months since he last woke gasping with his hands pressing so hard into his chest that despite his increased healing he still had bruises the next day. After he injected himself with the Extremis virus and reprogrammed his cells, his body grew him a new heart, and it thumps away in his chest like a war-drum, loud enough to drown out the memory of having nothing but a lump of metal behind his ribs.
Only one copy of the footage exists. In it, Tony enters the room, sits down, takes off his helmet, and cradles it in his hands. He spends twenty-seven minutes staring into the blank eyes of the Iron Man. He spends the minute after that sniveling, and the minute after that standing. Once upright, he leans over the body on the table and tells it one thing before replacing his helmet and exiting. The whole affair takes slightly less than half an hour. Friday has the only recording.
NB: She's pretty traumatized. Doesn't recall much, but you're welcome to try provided you don't mind taking me into the room with you.
"You're wrong," Steve says. "Those are exactly the people we should be fighting against. We're down on the street helping people. They're removed from the situation at best and willing to compromise their values at worst. We can't be answerable to some of the most corrupt men and women in the country."
"He's had his heart broken by an alcoholic before. It won't be the first time." She takes a turn around the island, looks at the old Invaders calendar pinned up on the wall, glances at the open junk drawer. She's still wearing her Fantastic Four uniform, and her face is drawn, and her jaw is set. Sue's a problem-solver. She's a multi-tasker. It's a blend he sees in a lot of successful CEOs. The boldness, though, is what marks her as the kind of explorer who thought taking a ride into space in an experimental craft sounded like a great adventure, who walks straight into the most heavily-secured skyscraper in Manhattan to confront an adversary. That quality runs in her family; all of them are crazy.
He doesn't feel hope when his ID card crackles to life again. He feels nothing at all when Steve's voice says, "All right, Stark. I'm giving you one chance." He doesn't feel hope; he doesn't feel anything. This is Tony Stark 2.0; he is not yet perfect, but under certain conditions of deprivation, he comes dangerously close.
He takes a helicopter to Ryker's. Tony flies at will in American and international airspace. There's no one to tell him he can't land his Robinson R22 on Yinsen's son's head.
"Killing Gorlovich would please me," the kid says, "but that isn't my primary objective. It's nice collateral, that's all. What would you call what I was doing, if not making you dance like a puppet?"
"Tell the FDNY to concentrate on stopping the fire from spreading," he says. "The Avengers will handle evac. Danvers?"
It was raining, and someone somewhere had come up with the dumb idea to have Cap's procession consist solely of a single white horse pulling a casket draped in the American flag. I like to think he would've been baffled by that, and maybe a little amused by the possibility of the horse wandering off the rails when some eight-year-old offered him a piece of candy. The horse was just as soaked and miserable as the rest of us. I hope his caretaker unhitched him later, and rubbed him down with a clean towel, and fed him a warm mash before the patter of the rain on the stable roof lulled him to sleep. I could use an evening like that; I bet he could, too.
"Tony…" Steve says. He's on his feet, leaning against the edge of the table so he faces Tony. "We need to talk."
"You figured it out faster than I thought you would," Maya says. All he can see of her is her feet—practical boots, what Carol might call shitkickers. She leans over him, he can tell by the way the bottom fringe of her hair sweeps over his neck, and then she shoves a hand into his pocket and pulls out Friday. Pulls out his phone. Pulls out his last benevolent ghost.
"It's… going," Tony says. "Slowly. Some of the initiatives are proceeding more efficiently than others. Camp Hammond's training program for let's say gifted youngsters has already demonstrated its efficacy. We hope to launch something similar for more experienced peacekeepers who need additional support in mastering their abilities and handling crisis situations."
"I told you before," the kid says. "Killing Ten Rings is a happy effect, but not my goal. I don't want to kill you, either. I want you to hurt, Stark. I want you to
"That's enough self-pity," Steve says, and when he raps the thing he's holding in his hand against the cuff on Tony's ankle, the sound cuts through the cathedral like a bell. "You're running out of time."
Under the faceplate, Tony opens his eyes. The most sophisticated heads-up display in the world greets him. Beyond the smart overlay and through the lenses he sees himself—taller and stronger, gleaming and invincible. Iron Man doesn't have bags under his eyes. Iron Man's eyes have been replaced with something better.
HH: I guess with all the other wild stuff that's going on now, the magic, all those guys from outer space…
"Not like this," Rogers says. "We're done here. I'm surrendering myself as a private citizen to SHIELD's custody." His strips off both his gloves, shows Iron Man his empty palms, and offers his wrists. A hundred people are watching with bloody disbelief, and not a single one makes a move to touch him.
Eleanor Bishop, wife of publishing mogul Derek Bishop, was killed in a skiing accident last month. How soon will her hubby be on the market? We're betting on 'soon'—Bishop was spotted in a romantic restaurant with a new squeeze two days ago. That's some cold comfort!
"Would I be rude enough to remark on the sleep habits of scientists?" Friday says, a little blandly. "Sally Floyd is still tryin' to get that interview—"
No part of Tony believes Steve would be capable of seriously harming him, but some parts of him wonder if he wouldn't deserve it—if Steve, should he decide to take this conflict out on Tony personally, wouldn't be in the right. There are lines being crossed, and Tony is the one crossing them; but Steve wouldn't send someone undercover to hurt Tony or (and this is the more salient point) to hurt Happy to hurt Tony. A little information gathering, though…
"Someone could make an argument that what you do isn't science but magic." At his sharp look, Friday shrugs. "Just sayin'."
She skitters back and forth for a while, like she can't decide what to look at first, but ultimately she's drawn to the armor. The Model 7 catches her eye first; Tony can't blame her. It's less flashy than some of his other suits, but it's also undeniably badass.
"Tell him thanks for asking," he says. "And send Carol a bouquet of flowers. No, hold on—get her some Red Sox tickets. Best seats available for the rest of the postseason."
He picks up the earpiece and carefully fits it over the ear that wasn't ripped off. The cartilage feels like tissue paper under his thick, deadened fingers.
"And you think I'm… what? Secretly in touch with Cap's underground? Feeding them information? Hiding that I'm a sympathizer?" Tony's getting angry. He's sick of people questioning his motivation in the way that only an addict can be sick. There's a streak of self-righteous hypocrisy in there, a dash of cowardly loathing, because of course they're right to question him. Doesn't matter. He's still angry.
"And they want to talk to you," Happy adds. "Wouldn't leave Pep alone until she agreed to go looking for you."
Iron Man bats the shield aside, fires a muon beam, and follows it up with a backhand. Rogers staggers again. Without hesitation, his hand closes around Rogers' throat—
Carol's voice: "You know why you're an idiot, Tony?" He comes around just enough to realize that she's cradling him in a bridal carry. "You left a helicarrier full of your people parked six miles above Omaha. What the hell made you think we wouldn't help?"
Tony nodded, took the gun from Howard. They reloaded it together; this time, Howard showed him how to use a speed loader. Tony lifted the gun, looked at the target. He squeezed the trigger. In the fractional second between when he started applying pressure to the trigger and when the hammer hit the firing pin, his body once again tensed and recoiled against the instructions of his brain. At that age it was the most vivid illustration of all the ways your self can betray you that he had yet encountered.
Iron is the last and heaviest element produced before supernovas collapse into black holes or neutron stars or into nothing at all. Iron is that final gasping breath, a heavy ghost disassembled into discrete particles and scattered among the stars.
Stark, uncharacteristically reticent about his time as a civilian prisoner-of-war, was nonetheless effusive in his praise for Dr. Yinsen in the years following his escape from the terrorist camp where he and Yinsen were held. The two men spent three months in captivity together and shared meals, a workshop, and even living quarters. War correspondent Aisha Summers toured the camp less than a year after Stark's escape.
"No," Tony says, because he can be honest with Steve if no one else. In the end, it's almost the only thing he can do for Steve. In the end, Steve thought he deserved to die, and Tony can do that, too, but right now there's this, the body, the pursuit, the job. He has to take responsibility.
TS: Yeah. Or sociology, or physics, or whatever. In the technology sector, more bleeding-edge projects fail than succeed. If you could figure out a way to predict the safe bets…
Here's his figure, leaning forward flirtatiously or looking away. Here's his hands, the burn scar at the base of his thumb that was only recently healed by Extremis, the blunt edge of his fingernails and fine tips of his fingers. Here's his suits, three-button and double-breasted, models fifteen and twenty. Here's an entire page of just his jawline and his beard.
Tony slumps back into his nice groove in the couch and discreetly activates certain subroutines in the secure computer network most closely slaved to his brain. He'll have a name by morning.
SR: Actually, that's a good comparison. You have to be in good shape, or you start putting yourself and the people around you in danger.
"You won't need this," she adds, which is followed by a crack that Tony understands as his lifeline breaking. He hurts. Everything hurts. How did she hit him so hard? Maya's on the tall side of average for a woman, but she has the whipcord build of someone often too absorbed to eat and more likely to drink her calories when she remembers she's hungry. "It strikes me as notably short-sighted that you apparently came here alone." She crouches down, takes him by the chin. She forces him to look. "Without the armor." The blood from his ear is running into his eyes. "How arrogant of you. What did you ever hope to accomplish?"
"Not everyone is fixated on Captain America. He's a factor, maybe the most important factor, but Cage and Sue Storm are both more than capable of pulling a stunt like this without Rogers leading them."
"He didn't backflip out of the helicarrier," Reed says. "The helicarrier's viewport is made of four layers of polycarbonate and exotic acrylics, which makes it more secure than the canopy of a conventional jet fighter. The force required for a human to crack—"
NB: We don't have all the crazy shit here that you do in New York, but we aren't completely ignorant. A regular criminal couldn't overpower Grif, especially not when he had the kids with him.
Tony turns the page and finds the latest version of his armor. The attention to detail is incredible, the care far beyond what Tony would expect; he never thought anyone other than he himself saw the Iron Man like this.
. Bleed too much? Extremis. Not strong enough? Extremis. Need a direct neural interface to your superhero suit? Extremis.
"He did it," Tony interrupts. "Hill showed me the footage. They were at an altitude of thirty-thousand feet. If the helicarrier didn't have emergency force shields, the entire bridge crew would be in the hospital from the decompression."
Tony used to have buddies and then one of them got shot in the head and the other got shot in the heart and the only guy remaining fucked off to Camp Hammond because Tony decided cutting Rhodey out of his life was the cleanest, the simplest, and by some measure the best choice.
"Contact Director Hill," Iron Man tells him. "I have some new information that might interest her. And follow up with Colonel Layton about that joint training exercise." Alpha Team in particular still needs work; they've having trouble integrating Iron Man into their tactics. Danvers' strike force, on the other hand, is currently their most valuable asset by an order of magnitude—
"Do you really think that's going to work, Tony?" Steve says. There's a body laid out on the slab between them.
"Unassailable logic," Tony says. "I was thinking we could go down to my garage, but if you'd rather meet the Avengers..."
If Stark is best known as Iron Man, it's only because the Avengers are the face of a generation. In his civilian guise, Stark is a media magnet, a modern-day Howard Hughes: brilliant, driven, and glib. There's no doubt that Stark is an incredible inventor, although how much involvement he retains in the day-to-day running of Stark Industries is questionable, but despite his skill as a technologist, Stark is less than gifted at navigating life as a hero. Stark appears to only intermittently grasp the clarity that comes so easily to leaders like Steve Rogers; while Rogers believes that the greater good transcends the law, Stark has all too often allowed himself to be influenced by his role as a business mogul and guided by his own best interests.
"Cut the crap. I don't want whatever lines you feed Jack Kooning and his buddies on the golf course. I want to know why Tony Stark—why
For the first hour of the day he managed glibness; it's easy to be glib with Friday, to be glib with himself, but Pepper deserves better, and that kind of attitude won't fly with the good ol' boys of HomeSec. Tony's position is tenuous. He's playing the appeasement game: act good, and be absolved. See how Tony is justified by works and not by faith alone? No
Jack says, with the sort of mildly friendly warning that only comes from years of political ass-kissing,
The Iron Man armor is fully equipped with a number of fire suppression methods, and Steve knows that, but four months were enough to dull the reflexes of a decade. When Tony says "Move," Steve hesitates. It's a picosecond, a blink in the grand scheme, but that fraction of a moment suspends them in infinity. For one hanging instant, Steve's distrust of Tony is stronger than his drive to save a human life.
"Is that really the right thing to do?" Danvers plants her fists on the table. "We could offer them pardons if they turn themselves in and comply with the law."
"...I met Doctor Yinsen once," she says. She looks at him, precise, takes him in, and then her gaze wanders away. "Years before you did. We were both presenting at a conference in Bern." She pauses, but not to gather her thoughts; she thinks much faster than she can talk. "He had his son with him," she says.
BIRCH: Ms. Potts has us scheduled for several long sessions, with follow-ups as needed while I work on drafting the manuscript. I'm also going to be posting some sound bites from our interviews on my blog—I usually document my writing process on new projects online. It's good advertising.
In one world, Tony falls in love easily. He loves Cancun, he loves his Porsche, he loves seeing his company sit at the top of the stock exchange. He loves every woman he ever dates, every woman he ever fucks. He doesn't fall in love with any men—not because he's avoiding complications, but because here he isn't built that way. He falls in love with Bethany Cabe, with Whitney Frost, with Sunset Bain, and they fall in love with him back, and nobody leaves anybody until Tony falls in love with the next woman. He falls in love with Jan and Natasha, Emma and Pepper. He falls in love with them twice on the same day. He falls out of love and back into it like a gull diving down to skim the surface of the ocean.
All prelude. He no longer feels concern, because concern is the province of men who flinch. Tony can't afford concern. He's sitting on the bank of the Rubicon right now, and across the river is Camlann, and if Steve were here listening he'd laugh at how Tony mingles history with myth. Mixing metaphors, that's what he's doing. It's another glitch, one of those abhorrent structural defects that comes with being human.
"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy," Tony says, because he knows a little something about taking a blow to the head.
"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic," Friday recites. "Not that, though. The divination. Prophecy. Foreknowledge obtained by some black art." Part of Friday will always be the precocious, dramatic brat whose birth took Tony's life by storm. Her childhood was short, as her nature as a synthetic being dictated, but for all her youthful hellfire he sometimes wished it had lasted longer.
At 6:03:21, Iron Man leaps, fires his repulsors, comes down hard with a punch aimed straight at Captain America's weak shoulder. Beneath the the thud of impact and after the snap of bone, the sound of bone shards grinding against each other is barely but crucially audible.
Until Director Hill strides forward and claps a pair of handcuffs on him. Two SHIELD agents flank her, and more fall into place once they're sure Rogers is secured.
"Fine." But for all his anger, his motivations have always been shamefully unclothed: "Then take off your mask. I want to see your face, too."
Friday lets him sit with that thought. She must know how it haunts him. He should've approached Steve earlier (why would Steve pay any special attention whatsoever to the garbage that came out of Tony's mouth?), he should've tried harder to get through to Steve (if he'd tried any harder, Steve would have split open his skull), he should have—should have stopped making excuses, should have taken—
Stevie rolls her eyes. "I'm not going to try winning this one again," she says, and then she opens the cabinet where they keep the mugs, and that's when Tony loses the battle. She reaches up, like she might reach up if she were trying to steady Stevie's balance, and puts her hand over the mark.
"That's the five-year plan," Tony says. "We're going the distance, haven't you heard? And what sets SI apart from competitors is innovation."
New tack. Keep up, Cap. "Do you ever think about what would happen?" Tony says. "If one of us turned rogue, got brainwashed… we've built quite the cabal."
Norman Osborn was previously held in a secure facility for the criminally insane out west. Iron Man only secured permission to transfer him after agreeing to transfer his team of mental healthcare professionals alongside him, which is why Doctor Covington, Doctor Cashman, and Father Coulmier are now the only personnel not selected by SHIELD to have access to Prison 42. He doesn't like it, but he doesn't have to. Iron Man bows to necessity.
NB: FuturePharm. They're really out in the middle of nowhere. I think they do some contract work with the government.
Cap blocks the edge of the shield with the meat of his forearm. It's enough to make even him stagger; he catches himself against the table and bounces back like a rubber squash ball. One minute the shield is in Tony's hand under Tony's control; the next minute the shield is not. Steve rips it out of his hands and flings it back-handed into a wall. It stays there, wedged into the fissure it created, and Steve uses his momentum to slam his other fist into Tony's side.
"But Tony—" This, what's coming, is how he and Carol are different, because he knows what she's going to say. "That's a worst-case scenario. The government has tried to regulate mutants before, and you know how well that went."
When he slides into his chair, Steve knocks his foot against Tony's, and something liquid and ashamed slides down Tony's spine.
because it implies something neat, clean, surgical, something efficient, something brutally delicate. It implies a total severance, a resection, the sort of precise non-pain that comes from using a very sharp scalpel to cut through tissue and muscle. Tony has performed surgery on himself before. He knows what it's like to be  armed with a tool so sharp you don't feel the hurt until you look down at what you did and realize you're bleeding.
He's forty feet in when he meets his first casualty. Eighty feet, and he meets someone living, someone bleeding from the temple and coated in dust and soot and she's wearing an employee badge clipped to her shirt and he remembers her—Shonda—he met her once on a tour. She's the head of security—
The articulation of movement as he sits up is transcendent; a hundred thousand processes and a hundred thousand seconds go into merely dragging his constituent parts together, bracing a forearm against his stomach, and leaning forward. "We're running out of time," Steve reminds him, but he lets Tony take the laser cutter from his hand.
For one hysterical moment, Tony had thought he was meant to knight the kid. He didn't have a sword, though, and they had stripped his authority and laid it out on the floor, so he couldn't grant any titles that day. What had finally cut through his remove was the almost inaudible clink of the circlet closing around his ankle. The consequence of that clink was having his brain stem pulled out the back of his skull.
In this brave new world, though, Tony has all the tools he needs to excise those weaknesses that lead to lapses in judgment. He hasn't coded out the latent addiction to alcoholism, because that's something he deserves to live with every day, but he has workarounds or the seeds of workarounds for everything else. Some of those workarounds are in alpha; it's fine. He's fine. He has years of experience at this.
She waits for him to catch his breath and wipe the blood from his face, and then, sounding amused, she says, "Go ahead and ask."
Maya, or at least he liked her once; he likes how her mind works, he likes her focus and dry, dark humor.
TS: It might actually be more entertaining to watch us fight over the TV remote. There's a lot more at stake. The gym is just for blowing off steam.
. It's right there, sitting on his tongue, ready to share with the world; but Tony, who spent most of the past decade atoning for the many and varying sins he committed even without the excuse of brainwashing, is already wondering whether he's strong enough to carry the weight of a sin even more abhorrent still. It's the same quantum leap in thinking that carried him to the armor, the same revelatory transformation that came over him after the death of his parents—pain as the lash to drive him towards what is, if not transcendent, at least survivable; if not better, at least necessary.
"Send a message to Hill. Top priority, her eyes only. I want a description of Yinsen's kid, as many pictures are you can pull, and a full report of the situation."
"I don't think you really thought that one through," says Yinsen's son. "Even if you choose to believe that you're here of your own free will and not because I compelled you, I could still have a gun."
Tony knows, but he's going to let her say it anyway; god knows she's offered him the same indulgence enough times.
Sometime in the past few days, Tony has lost operational efficiency. It's probably because he was stripped of his armor, which in one important way was the only thing keeping him upright. He doesn't even have the bright webbed overlay that used to paint his eyes and nerves, and maybe that's one more sign that this is the afterlife. All he knows is that someone has to stop Maya, and Tony gave away his armor and his authority, so now he has to clean up his own mess. It's fitting that he left the armor behind. The armor is dry, hard, clean; Tony is wet, soft, decomposing. The armor isn't messy. This is an organic problem.
"The trade-off is Big Brother, looking over our shoulder," Tony says. This is the best, the clearest kind of What If: the What's Coming. He can see the foundation of it, can draft the dozen different blueprints that could lead to its construction. "First they monitor us. Then… then they dictate to us. Then they start calling for internment. Any of us step out of line, we go to the Raft. We question the law, we go to the Raft."
Mr. Grey was last seen the evening of the 12th by his wife, Grace. He left for the grocery store around 7 o'clock and never returned home. Security footage shows Mr. Grey pulling out of the store parking lot at 8 o'clock. His car was found abandoned on the side of 225th Street.
"Hit," Friday says. She puts a holographic table at ground-level for him. "Converting to local time zone. Kellard expired at 2:30 in the afternoon, Renada at 10 o'clock in the morning, and Norriss at 3:45 in the morning."
"You want an explanation? Try this on. I'm a weapon, Steve. You're a weapon. We, all of us, are weapons. I've spent the past decade extracting myself from the business; this is something I understand. And we can't stop existing, can't stop doing what we do—we're addicts, on top of everything else, and I know something about addiction, too. You put a bunch of dangerous addicts in a closed community, and you know what you get? You get a time-bomb. And we're ticking away, and none of us know how much longer the timer has. Maybe this is the explosion, but maybe it isn't. Maybe there's something worse coming. I don't care. All I care about is containing the collateral damage. Tick tick, Steve. Are you going to fan the flames, or help me put them out? The last thing I want is to see someone put a bullet between your eyes because they mistake you for a Skrull, or because you won't let us monitor you for telepathic interference, or just because you don't know when to quit."
"I took the security precautions I deemed necessary. If you want to fight about this, I suggest you try contacting the president and the Secretary of Defense first."
"Since I wasn't planning on asking, that's such a relief. Have I ever mentioned that I tingle when you give me unsolicited orders?"
"No, nothing," Reed says. "I thought—but I'm not always the best at reading the nuances of relationships."
. Over the past two years, Stark, already untouchable, has climbed threateningly close to the pinnacle of the mountain. He went from occasional expert witness to a mainstay of the Department of Defense's payroll, and from there to SHIELD consultant. By the time the Registration Act passed, half of Congress was nestled in his pocket and he was well on his way to absolute control over SHIELD and its subsidiary entities. That language is by far the most applicable; Stark is running SHIELD the same way he runs his Fortune 500 company but with far less success.
"It's the worst part," Tony counters. "I've tried to cut it out, code it out, trick myself out of it. I can't excise it. It doesn't ebb, it won't be replaced. It's the worst part of me, Steve."
. What Friday doesn't understand is the sheer astonishing juxtaposition of being a worthless piece of crap while sober and knowing with complete assurance that the world revolves around you when intoxicated. She doesn't understand that.
"He's an outlaw," says Lansing. "Which doesn't erase the enormous good he's done for this country. Mr. Stark is doing the right thing by concentrating his efforts on SRA's other initiatives. Chasing after Captain Rogers only lends credibility to his cause."
"Not here," Tony says, and he retreats to one of the dark corners on the far side of the living room. The view here is a totality; floor-to-ceiling glass, and at night and with the lights off, New York unfolds so far below it looks like a toy or a dream. Steve must have an entire notebook filled with cityscapes by now—Tony's caught him at it before, drawing brownstones in Brooklyn from memory or the sun coming up over the Empire State Building from this exact spot.
I want detailed reports on every meeting between Stark and Hill. Secure this goal by any means necessary. Kooning is still dead-set on installing Stark as SHIELD's new director, and while I have private concerns that Hill would be willing to surrender the role, there is no denying that she is the best man for the job. (Recall our conversation concerning Stark's fallout with Maya Hansen.)
HH: I, uh… I just wanted to say something. I don't know if it's my place, but you… uh, you don't seem fine.
Steve used to joke about it; things got rough, he asked if someone had an eight-foot block of ice he could crawl into. He was joking, but the joke was about escape. Tony, who often joked about escapes, wondered if some part of Steve meant it, if he missed that cool remote place, missed the armor of the ice. Steve was probably joking, but Tony didn't want to bet on his ability to read Steve.
), the world's worst timing, and the usual impeccable taste of the media combined in a perfect shitstorm of circumstances to make superhero regulation the hottest issue of the year.
Friday gives him three entry points, her best guess at employee locations, and a building layout with projected structural damage. It's all laid out in lines of shining blue and green, overlaid on the world, providing distance and reason to the crackle and the heat and the crumble of debris. Tony pulls up, kills his repulsors, and drops like a rock right through the hole in the roof through which black smoke pours.
"What I'm suggesting today—actually, that's a fallacy. What I'm here to demonstrate is that it is possible, that it is
"You've been out late," Steve says. They haven't really talked since Steve put him on probation; that's by Tony's design.
"Do you remember what happened last time?" she argues. "I threw a temper-tantrum and nearly harmed Ms. Potts."
Here's how you know Tony Stark has the moral fiber of mayonnaise: this right here, this act of merely walking into a room containing the hollow shell of a man who more than once saved Tony's life, this is the hardest thing he's going to do today, and it's the hardest thing he's going to do tomorrow, and it's the hardest thing he's going to do in a week that includes jailing people he loves and crawling into bed with people he hates. Tony Stark is a black hole of conviction. He does it, because Happy deserves better than Tony, but nothing about it comes easy.
"And you can't oppose every politician in Washington just because they back legislation you don't like."
In the next patch, he hopes to remove the need for sleep entirely. 2.3 is underway, a high-priority project. He likes to joke about it. "Imagine how much I could get done if I didn't need to sleep," he'll say, and Pepper will sigh and smile.
Sleeping. Napping. He's been so tired lately—is that natural, or artificially induced? Would Yinsen's son find it easier to access his brain while sleeping?
STARK: She's the rock this place is built on. You can quote me on that. I keep trying to make her VP, and she keeps turning me down.
He comes back to his senses in stages. Touch first, that's the pressure of his feet flat against the rug and the hard edge of the bedframe at his back (when did he crumple to the floor?), and then smell, the linen scent of bedding and crisp edge of recycled air. Taste: his mouth baked dry. Vision: the floaters from pressing his palms into his eye sockets. And finally hearing: Friday's voice murmuring a count to which his breath is synchronized.
Now, currently, he needs that state of clarity more than ever. He's in his workshop; the most recent model of the armor is fully assembled and standing in the middle of the floor in standby mode. Behind it, above it and through it and around it, are a series of holographic models and readouts that tell Tony what he already knows.
POLASTRI: My name's Jane Polastri, and my question is… I'm sorry, I can't resist… who's your favorite Avenger?
"The longer we let them go unchecked, the more the tide turns in their favor," says Hill. She's standing with both hands planted on the ops table, hip cocked, staring Tony down. "Let me be blunt," she says. "I don't think you're telling us everything."
"Notify Danvers. I want the Avengers on the ground now. Hold all SHIELD units in reserve," Iron Man tells Director Hill. "We're finishing this fight
"Stall them," Tony says. "Tell them I'm in Malibu. Tell them I'm skiing in the Alps. Tell them whatever you need to tell them to get them out of the Tower, and then put every lawyer we have on this. I want the helicarrier wallpapered with injunctions. Get Jack Kooning on the phone and have him apply as much pressure as necessary on Hill. I don't care if he has to fabricate a war that desperately requires SHIELD intervention—"
"But how did they find her?" Tony says. As long as he keeps tick-tick-ticking along at the surface—that's what matters. He doesn't have to have substance as long as he has the performance of substance. He can while away the hours doing whatever he likes in the sanctity of his own head as long as he keeps tick-tick-ticking.
Meanwhile, Iron Man. Tony Stark exists at the other end of the spectrum. In the years since the public revelation of Iron Man's identity, Stark Industries has stuck to the story that Tony Stark is no more than a man in a can, but rumors of self-modification have plagued Stark since the beginning of his career. Those rumors were confirmed recently when news outlets obtained partial medical records from Stark's recent hospital stay (for, of course, undisclosed reasons) and connected them to a talk he gave a few months prior on what he called the Extremis enhancile. Even discounting the shortcut of the armor, Stark is no longer human—if he ever was in the first place.
Extremis is an entire other topic of conversation. It's not a What If; it's a What Is, maybe the most glorious What Is to come from Tony's brain other than the Iron Man itself. It's programmable, versatile, incredible. Extremis allows you to rewrite
"I don't care. The Foundation PR team is supposed to vet news sources and then communicate a list of approvals to whoever's hosting one of our appearances. I'll have someone's head on a block if they aren't doing their job. What did they hit you with?"
humans, which breeds understanding if not sympathy, similarity if not sameness. And the easiest way to make a creature obey is to make it want to obey, after all—there's that, too. Tony built that trait into Friday: not obedience, but the desire for collaboration. In avoiding hard limits, he'd given her the freedom to decide whether she liked people or not.
"Divide and conquer," she suggests. "Target each one of them individually. Cage's obvious weak point is his family—"
HP: Remember how Steve decided he was going to adopt three teenagers and start his own team of Avengers?
He builds a What If with Lila at the center. In this What If, Tony recognizes the hereditary defects he'd rather not pass to a child (alcoholism, depression, megalomania, an exciting but ultimately dangerous tendency to install jets in places they shouldn't be), he refuses to turn to gene engineering to eradicate those defects from progeny, he admits that the last thing he wants is to emulate his own example of fatherhood. He shuts down production on the Stark line. Faulty model, out with the rest of the trash.
you an explanation. Okay, try this one on for size: I'm doing what you told me to do, Cap. I'm owning my problems. I'm taking responsibility."
"What a short-sighted idiot," Tony says, and that's how he ends up preparing to sneak out of his own building to LaGuardia at two in the morning.
TS: Did you say you were going by the community center? I have a few things to pass along to the project manager, she should be on-site today.
"This conversation is over," Carol says, her tone now the whip-crack of a woman who gave her dad the middle finger, joined the Air Force to pay for her own education, and ended up a full-bird colonel, a security chief for NASA, a bestselling author, an intergalactic adventurer, and one of Earth's mightiest heroes all before the age of forty.
The fixation isn't unusual or concerning by itself. Mr. Stark is a man of science, and like many of his (admittedly small field of) peers, he exists at the forefront of technological development. What does concern me are some of his more radical views on the boundaries of human existence and how they might be eradicated. This field of thinking is certainly important and will arguably play a major role in the future, but Mr. Stark appears to be accelerating these core transhumanist ideas by using himself as a test subject.
There's nothing in the garage that can help with this. It's a good garage, a great garage, a garage that takes up the lowest three levels of the Tower's basement. He'd like a little sunlight, had considered installing this iteration of the garage on the
Iron Man decloaks just before he touches down ten feet away from Rogers in the empty street. He isn't sure how they cleared the civilians out of here so far, but trust Cap to have thought of everything.
ROGERS: It gives you exactly the amount of credit you deserve. You're a hard person to know, but the reward is more than worth the effort. I've always thought…
God, that voice is relentless. If Friday's talking to him, he'll never hear it over the slow tidal power of that voice. He can no more unhear that voice than a dog can unhear its master's command.
,' thank you all, you really are great for my ego—personally, I'm more interested in the ways I could tailor a serum like that to act as an interface between my big, giant brain and my big, cutting-edge tech. I say 'serum,' we all know that's a euphemism; what we're discussing is a nano-machine swarm that hacks the body's repair center delivered directly to the bloodstream via… let's just say that the delivery technique could use some refinement and leave it at that."
NB: Couple of farms. We're far enough from Omaha that there isn't much out here other than cornfields.
"Thirty-seven percent," she says, satisfied, and then she stands. "When you think about it, we're both getting what we deserve." She halts there for a moment, looking down at him, and her mouth holds a snarl or a smile or a sneer. "It was good knowing you, Tony," she says, and then she adds, "You can fuck off now." And she takes her own advice and fucks off, with even measured steps in her shitkicker boots and dress slacks and lab coat. Maya Hansen: multifaceted, a master of practicalities. Tony's going to die, and he didn't even get the good exit line.
designed roller coasters for a hobby. Cedar Point in Ohio has one of his designs; it's not the tallest or the fastest, but it's the one most likely to make you puke. Tony likes that. They gave him an award for it.
"Why are you here? You're here because you're futurists. You're here because you think that the human condition can be
It is my opinion that Mr. Stark's reliance on his armor is pathological, although please remember that this is an informal assessment for internal use rather than a formal diagnosis. Mr. Stark appears to idealize his "Iron Man" persona at the expense of his other identities. This is a trait that appears in a lot of costumed heroes, but what makes Mr. Stark's case unique is how this idealization interacts with his fixation on technology.
His first divisional meeting is held aboard his own helicarrier with only his own hand-selected personnel present. He doesn't bother introducing himself. "This is a special SHIELD department," he says. "We are comprised of the Superhuman Restraint Division, Operation Lightning Storm, and Alpha Team, along with a full support staff. We work alongside Director Hill and have full access to her resources but are not subordinate to her. Our goals are the supervision and enforcement of all programs and laws pertaining to the SRA, which includes safeguarding the registry itself." Registration Division: his people take to calling it R&D by the end of the first day, and jokingly start referring to themselves as the 'Tin Men' by the end of the week.
is 100% due to the community who reads and comments on the pieces posted here. I'm sad to announce that the blog's time has come to a close, but I remain as committed as ever to bringing you the stories that larger outlets obfuscate.
Steve looks away. It's a tactical retreat, a tacit acknowledgement that he's making the conscious decision to set this topic aside lest he dig his feet in and defeat the entire purpose of the meeting. Tony doesn't appreciate it. He thought they could
BIRCH: Forgive me. Executive assistant, and has been since shortly after you took control of Stark Industries.
He gives a lecture at Cal-Poly—big symposium, he's the featured speaker because of course he is, and they want him to talk about micromunitions but Tony wants to talk about Extremis because he
"What are you lookin' for?" Friday asks. There are no cameras in the bedrooms, so she doesn't have eyes on him.
"Imagine if you were being stubborn about this," Tony snaps. "Oh, wait, never mind. How am I supposed to explain it, Steve? You can't tell me you don't see the need for regulation. Springfield, Stamford, the Young Avengers—they're great kids, but they deserve more than a slapdash training regimen whenever we can make time for them. The American public saw a need, and their duly-elected representatives enacted a law to meet that need. The rest of us only get to decide whether we serve the law or dictate it."
If the satellite connected to Tony while he was displaying the increased delta activity of deep sleep, it would automatically send a second signal with the trigger. The instructions wouldn't even have to be specific, just a target and some kind of workaround to shut down his resistance and keep him from being aware of what he was doing. That was why Yinsen's son had been able to coerce him into a long series of complex tasks that included overriding Friday and running the armor in stealth mode—he'd told Tony
ROGERS: And you play dumb when it suits you. See, though, right there; you have us watching you conjure with your right hand while the left picks our pockets.
"Got it," he says, and then, before Shonda can protest, he scoops her up, fires his boots, and rockets outside to deposit her in the street. One down. That's the easy one; the deeper into the building he goes, the more time it's going to take to weave his way in and out. He catches a glimpse of Danvers backlit by the sky with one person in her arms bridal-style and two more clinging to her neck before he drops back into hell.
Earlier I said that 'they' stripped him of his shield and 'they' handcuffed him instead of affording him the dignity he deserved, which was disingenuous bullshit of the kind Steve Rogers abhorred. Every journalist who chooses Steve Rogers as a subject encounters this problem sooner or later, because you can't write about one without eventually writing about the other. 'They' didn't strip Cap of his shield. Tony Stark did.
"That's an exaggeration," Byrd says. Byrd is Tony's favorite. He's a battleaxe. He's a skeptic, and he doesn't like Tony. Respects him, maybe; but doesn't like him. "We are interested to hear your assessment of how the application of the SRA is going."
"I'm going to fix this," Tony says. He reaches out and touches one hand to the glass; it's cool beneath his palm, reinforced to the
JK: See, that's what I mean. You need some time to get out of your own head. I hear the Grenadines are nice.
"So that's how your new police state works." Rogers glances over at Danvers, and his jaw clenches. After a moment of thought, he says, "What's the question?"
It was raining, and his pallbearers settled Steve's casket beside an open grave marked by the same plain marble headstone as the next soldier over. Someone, probably the same idiot who came up with the horse, wanted to stick a big statue of Cap right at the crest of a hill and put Cap's body to rest beneath it, but Sam Wilson dug in his feet, a tactic he honed alongside the only other man as stubborn as him. You can guess who flinched first. After that fight, Sam still had the fortitude to stand in front of an entire world and give a eulogy that will surely go down in history alongside the Gettysburg Address and FDR's inaugural assertion that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself as one of the great pieces of American oration. Too bad Sam didn't put his foot down about the horse, too.
Hill eyes him. She's wary but curious—she might even sense his roiling anger, but she's reserved enough not to mention it. "I thought you didn't drink anymore."
"Okay," Tony says, and then after too long a pause, he adds, "Thank you," because it seems like what he's supposed to say.
A few years ago I was allowed to go through a box of old photographs for a story I was doing on Avengers Mansion. There was a candid in there of Carol Danvers and Wanda Maximoff sitting on a kitchen counter sharing a carton of ice cream. I showed the picture to Carol. "Wanda and I were always getting caught eating out of the carton," she said. "Steve took that picture, and then he blew it up and gave us each a copy for Christmas." I told her I was surprised that Cap, a noted cartoonist, hadn't sketched them. "I said that, too," she replied. "And he said that by the time he finished drawing us, the ice cream would've melted."
. The camaraderie, the easy banter: he half expects Wanda to walk through the door and tease Carol about having her head in the clouds, expects Thor to come behind her and unfasten his cape and inquire about dinner. They talk easily, unburdened by guilt or grief, and Carol and Tony share a look across the room, a look of
"Business as usual," Tony agrees, "although it couldn't hurt to have you watching her back in case Hill decides to abandon subtlety."
There is nothing in the world that beats flying; Tony's in love with excess, but nothing beats this. He could throw millions of dollars at every attraction the universe has to offer—there are a lot, and he's tried most of them—and even the fastest cars driven by the most gorgeous models piled on all the fame in Hollywood on top of a flawless reputation on top of his mom on top of Happy on top of Pepper on top of Rhodey on top of his workshop on top of the Avengers and craven dreams of chivalry and Steve's presence in his bed and not having once had a cavity sitting where his heart should be—
In a perfect world, he wouldn't even need to go supersonic on the flight home from the New York Women's Correctional Facility. In a perfect world, he wears the armor for the sheer hell of it, forgoes the car, forgoes the drive, follows the Hudson all the way back to Manhattan. He pulls a couple of aileron turns over the Lincoln Tunnel and then heads straight into a vertical climb, up and up and up, away from the lights of the city below and towards the lights of the stars above. When he reaches the apex of his climb, he cuts his thrust and stalls; and for the span of a heartbeat, he hangs there suspended before gravity pulls him back down.
It's dark by the time he makes it back to the Tower. The drive did him no favors; he thought about contingency plans and about incentive and about Maya. Friday had been quiet, but every now and then the speakers would crackle with artificial distortion—letting him know that she was there, that she was listening. Hard to believe that she'd once been one of his problem children, but she'd had growing pains the same as any other person. He'd taken her off the workforce and given her a few years to grow up, and now she's brilliant and fathomless. He wishes he could say the same.
The lights are dimmed, the glass cases holding his armor cast in a reflective sheen that only hints at the threatening figures within. If he bothered taking his armor off anymore, he'd be in slippers and one of his ragged bathrobes, but he's in the armor, so he doesn't sit, doesn't sprawl, doesn't kick his feet out in front of him and prop his chin in his palm as he stares off into the distance and thinks.
"Yeah," says Tony, and he wipes the blood from his face, and then he accepts what he'd denying with the all the blind, faithful fervor of a true believer: that it's already too late.
At 6:03:08, Steve hauls himself to his feet and swings his shield edge-first at Iron Man's face. It's brutally, impossibly fast; anyone else would be left in the dust. On the third swing, Iron Man catches the shield and rips it away.
They enter the conference room. Iron Man triggers the door before Hill can lay her hand on the security scanner.
Extremis. He doesn't provide details; the last thing he needs is some infant genius getting enough information to craft an approximate replication.
"Ah." There's a world of meaning packed in there, but maybe Stevie's as determined to keep the peace as Tony. "Well, I didn't mean to startle you."
"You're being reinstated. And we're returning your armor." Jack looks down at his coffee. They were friends, once, just like Tony and Maya were friends, but now Tony wonders if he ever really knew Jack Kooning at all. "We—
"Aw, did you watch the Disney movie too many times?" Tony teases, and then, when Steve looks blank, says, "Don't worry, we'll watch it together. I thought Merlin was a hero when I was a kid, too. Maybe he knew Arthur had to be born, though. Maybe he didn't see any other way."
"Yeah," Tony says, and he opens the closet door with hands that are still trembling. No shared rooms with fluorescent lights for
He plays What If like he breathes, like he'll die if he doesn't. He falls asleep building a What If. He wakes building a What Is. It's causality. It's just pain.
"He used to go to the gym every day, you know, and there were… Boxers are often forced into retirement because of too many blows to the head. It's an early form of dementia. Punch-drunk, they call it."
In the aftermath, they rebuild. A pocket of Cap's underground refuses to turn themselves in, but they're a small group with capable leaders but no figurehead. Where Rogers goes, the rest follow.
want." And then Tony really starts to get it, what it's like to go up against Captain America, what facing down Steve Rogers means: one second Cap's standing there, talking, and the next he's slamming a fist into Tony's side. He catches it on his lower ribs. Despite the protective sheath of his underarmor, he feels—hears—no: some amalgamation of the two, like the way a low bass vibrato is felt with the entire body—he
This is Iron Man sacrificing himself to Captain America. He's at the altar now. He might as well sit down here and wait to die; it's a hell of a lot better than being Tony Stark for one more day.

TS: Which isn't as much fun for a desk jockey as a super-soldier. He's been teaching me to fight on and off for years, and I still have trouble keeping up.
. You're here because you think that the mountains of debt, the years spent toiling for a scrap of paper, all those nasty things you do to each other for just a little more lab time, you're here because you think the end goal makes all that suffering worth it. You think that with innovation, with an open flow of ideas, that with rigorous testing, skepticism, and clear eyes, we can build tomorrow.
One-thirty, one-forty and climbing. Where once an elevated pulse might have meant at best severe pain and at worst a terminal condition, now it barely makes him short of breath. His heart is new and improved. It's
In some way, it's all a function of luck. Consider his love for Steve: low probability, high impact. A wildcard. He doesn't believe in fate, not in the sense of predestination, but he does believe that sometimes certain factors align in such a way that a particular outcome is so highly probable it might as well be inevitable. Becoming Iron Man—he wants to believe that was inevitable. Forming the Avengers. Meeting Rhodey, the Hogans, Reed, Rumiko.
There are at least three people—Carol, Adam, Monica—on the current Avengers roster who have a decent shot of taking down Iron Man, and Tony has hinted at or outright given them the best tactics for doing so. A couple of the others might have a chance, particularly if they cooperate; Peter, Rhodey, and Steve have enough working knowledge of the armor that they can pick out its weak points and at least begin to disable it.
Eventually, Tony thinks of everything. He thought of this: he thought of this exact outcome, under these conditions, he thought of how the bullet might look as it caught Steve in the sternum, he thought of how Steve would jerk and slump, his great heart still working, still pumping blood out the profane hole punched in his chest. Tony thought of that. He thinks of it often, in color and stereo. He thinks of it so often it's frozen on the backs of his eyelids, a ghost image on a faulty screen.
He spends the rest of the meeting redesigning the phone in his head. See, that's the thing: what Tony builds is not, generally speaking, for consumer use. It's too much, too big or too small, too flashy or too utilitarian, too expensive or too complicated. Over the years, he and Pepper have worked out a system. Tony invents, and Pepper sweeps in behind him, picks over his workshop, picks out what's new, what's marketable, and what's going to be relegated to the toy pile. Tony understands this system; he goes in the toy pile himself, being too much, too flashy, too utilitarian, too expensive, and too complicated for general consumption.
"It's been weeks. I can't smell, but I've got a vivid imagination." He imagines that if he weren't hovering a couple of miles over the Upper Bay, one of her holograms would shimmer into life beside him—one of the human ones, maybe the woman with the asymmetric haircut or maybe one of her favorite celebrities. She used to do Einstein a lot, because she thought it was funny and because she liked the accent. Since she no longer has enough control over Iron Man to activate his projectors, he remains alone.
At last he disassembles the bones, the lunate and triqueturm, the metacarpals, the distal and proximal phalanges. He sorts them by size and lines them up beside his nails on the worktable in front of him, working one-handed because his other hand has been broken down and set aside to be studied and then discarded. Now the real work begins, the fun work, the work of construction. He doesn't waste time perfecting the osseointegration of bone and implant, because soon enough he'll be nothing but implant. He doesn't fine-tune the artificial nerves; his new hand is wireless.
That's why they wanted him here. The rest of it is just a powerplay; they don't need Tony to show up in person to tell him about Camp Hammond, the registry, the prison. What they need is a gesture that allows them to believe they're in charge. That's what this is. It's a chastisement, a reminder that Tony might be the one with his hand in the bird but HomeSec are the ones holding a cleaver to Tony's wrist. They want to flagellate him with Steve.
"Not a problem," he summarizes. Not a problem, not after years of working out ways to let his tissue-paper body in a tin-can suit withstand the Melter and Radioactive Man, the cold of space and the high heat of magma. A burning building, even a burning chemical plant, is nothing. People look at the armor and they think that's it, that's the trick, but the real trick is everything they can't see—the inertial systems that let him survive a hundred g's of force, the gravitational manipulation that works in concert with his repulsors to let him fly, the sophisticated converters that let him walk through a burning building without being cooked alive. What good is theory without application?
"You invited yourself over in the middle of the night expecting that you'd find me up, and hey, gold star, you were right. Which means I have no room to judge. Comparing me to Doctor Doom, though…"
gave a pop-up concert late last night in Central Park. The light show went on for almost forty minutes before the police finally arrived to shut her down. Gotta love a lady with a best-selling album who still gives free performances in the middle of NYC.
Tony sits. He sits exactly this far from Steve: close enough to steal Steve's warmth, but not close enough that any part of Tony is touching any part of Steve. "How was Madripoor?"
Steve taps his tool against the cuff. Extremis was a tool; Maya had given him Extremis, and Extremis could fix this. All those parts of his body that Maya's locked away—
He steadies himself against the base of a statue, forces himself upright, clenches his fist to check the function of his hand. All his fingers still move. His head is bare; his hands work. He'll be fine.
"Business as usual," he says, because even SHIELD is an industry. "Something I can help you with, sir?"
Tony's a big fan of humanity, but he's also aware that humanity as it is lacks a certain something. On the basest level, the material can't withstand any significant degree of stress. There's elegance in cells and tissues and muscles, he can't deny there's a sort of messy efficiency there, but skin and bone are poor substitutes for carbon nanotube composite fibers and adamantium-skinned biomemitic ceramics. For instance: if Happy were made of metal and circuits instead of flesh and blood, he very likely wouldn't be lying braindead at Memorial Hospital after a hired gun who disagreed with Tony's politics decided to take his ire out on Happy.
He buys the headset, syncs it to his phone, tosses the crappy earbuds he'd stolen from Clint in the trash. Discarding the tether comforts him, and Friday's voice is clear in his head all the same.
Tony had teased back, said something about… about… something about how he could sit down at a computer and within thirty seconds have a falsified identity. "You might not always have a computer," Steve had countered, and then he'd gently knocked his fingers against the top of Tony's skull. "Gotta keep you safe, Shellhead."
"He's pissed that you won't call him back," Carol says, "how do you think he is?" She inhales, sucking air through her teeth, and then exhales, long and weighty. "I get it. I remember having the energy to care about people, but now…"
There's a riot of daisies on the windowsills. Most of them are from Tony. The other flowers, the roses and carnations and baby's breath, are from other Stark Industries employees, from Happy's friends, from the boys down at the club, from family.
All the pain, all the suffering, all the blood and angry words—all for what? And you know, at the end, all he really wants is for it to be over.
"What," he says, because that's his line; he's been on the other side of the stage often enough to know.
Jack stays standing, shoves a hand in one pockets, picks up his own mug of coffee, and clears his throat. "Well. It looks like we owe you an apology." Translation: we accidentally hired a monster who misused our funds, our personnel, and our equipment. "We were worried that… but you were on to something, with those cornfield murders. Good bit of detective work. Of course, we'd expect nothing less."
He scans again for bugs. Nothing comes up other than the standard SHIELD surveillance, although he disables that, too, as a precaution. "We finished cracking the cipher Captain America is using," he says.
The soldiers had still had their hands around his wrists, but now they touched skin rather than a flawless golden lattice. They were touching his skin. Nobody had touched Tony since Steve Rogers tried (first with his shield and then with his bare hands) to beat Tony to death in the middle of a Manhattan street. Having someone else erase that last touch is profane, it's disturbing. It makes Tony dirty. The last person to touch Tony had been Steve and now these strangers had come along to touch him instead, and what should make Tony angry only makes him feel washed away and vacant. Of course they'd take this from him. Of course they'd leave him naked and sagging in front of his own men. Of course he couldn't keep that perfect last touch, Steve's final gift to him, the sort of gift that was beautiful and useful and so exquisite it hurt like a blow to the head. He'd folded it gently into memory, but now that's been ripped from him, too.
When the gun fired, it was the noise that frightened him. Even through his earplugs and earmuffs, the crack of it was violent and deafening. He jerked back hard but managed to keep the muzzle pointing downrange, as Howard had taught him, and he swallowed down the thick, caustic sensation in his throat, also as Howard had taught him.
"Whoa!" Stevie says. She really does lose her balance then, and Tony yanks her hand away from that electric arc of sensation like she's burning.
Because the What If is indulgent and opportunistic, he kills it off. Doesn't think about it again, just gives it the axe as he towels himself dry. He shaves at Friday's urging and returns to the closet, where he chooses a three-piece suit in deep navy with a subtle pinstripe. It pairs nicely with a light blue shirt; he goes bold with the tie, because frankly he could wear the greasy undershirt and nobody would blink. A few years ago one of his PR heads suggested he figure out a way to make it so his damn armor would stop wrinkling his damn suits, and ever since he's had the majority of his clothes tailored from a memory fabric that was the product of a particularly fruitful luncheon with some of his people from R&D.
still in there. I was startin' to wonder," she says. "Speaking of, have you thought maybe about having a shower today?"
Behind the kid, the mist is burning off the river. Rhodey has to be beat—he was up all night fighting the good fight, while Tony was sleeping it off in his nice warm workshop.
He lost the secret identity but kept the armor, and the armor is better. It will be better. That's what he has to figure out: how to make the armor absolute, impenetrable, smart enough and tough enough and strong enough to make up for all his human sins. The external suit is assembled in front of him; the finish on the Model 29 is matte, but to Tony's eyes it gleams nonetheless. He sees the whole of it, not just the surface matter.
You can't talk about Steve Rogers without talking about the people around him. He built communities as easily as some of his peers built skyscrapers. Cap may not have been a founding member of the Avengers, but he was so quickly deemed a foundational member of the team that the founders rewrote their history to include him at the inception. Every Avenger I have met has gone out of their way to assure me that the Avengers are not merely a team but a family that has been knit together through years of highs and lows, triumphs and sorrows and the many days in between where we all get about the more ordinary business of living.
"Having one? Having her," Stevie corrects herself. "Or maybe not having her, I guess. No, I don't regret it. Look, tea's done." She knocks the back of her knuckles against Tony's ribcage, a casual touch, and Tony, already halfway unzipped, just about crawls out of her skin. "Want to show me what you're working on?"
HP: It's what I would've… I just meant that we're making sure no one can find Steve's body. No exhuming him to run experiments, no more attempts to replicate the super-soldier serum. Right, Tony?
He closes his eyes. The mirror drops away. The reflection drops away. Tony Stark drops away, replaced by a natal presence with the potential to be everything Tony is not: Tony Stark 2.0.
Tony considers the suit. It won't be much protection, but the fabric is a special weave that came right out of SIR&D. At least he won't be naked.
BOWMAN: I'm not as single-minded as everyone believes me to be. Anyway, this is a favor for the guy at the other end of the leash.
BIRCH: Colonel Danvers has been very publicly appreciative of how you sponsored her in Alcoholics Anonymous.
He sees her on the CNN feed the next day; someone managed to get footage of her diving into the East River to rescue a kid and his moms after they lost control of their car and went sailing off the Brooklyn Bridge. That's because Carol is a hero. She got into this business to save people. Iron Man—Iron Man is a failsafe.
and then promptly gotten the shit kicked out of him by the guy who had stolen Extremis in the first place. Maya came to Tony for help, and when Tony failed at helping, he shot himself up with Extremis, too.
Tony yawns and rolls over. "Hey, soldier," he says, and then he catches the time on the wall panel over Steve's shoulder and grins. "Little late for a relic like you to still be in bed. Afraid you'll miss the early-bird special down at the waffle house?"
When they'd put that circlet around his ankle, the world had dropped out from under him. His connection to the armor: gone. Friday, whispering in his ear: gone. That massive net of datastreams: gone.
Good old Danvers, putting voice to all his fears. They have the kind of understanding and mutual sympathy only possible between two fuck-ups who realize that they don't deserve sympathy. Rhodey's always going to be his number one, and Steve is on a whole other level, but Carol Danvers is the kind of friend who intuitively grasps all the ways Tony is weak.
There's Pepper and Happy and Rhodey; there's his company, his legacy, and his image. There's his armor. God in heaven, there's his armor. It's the best thing he's ever done, the best and the biggest, the most beautiful by far, sleek and hard and fast, and Tony loves it in a way he's never loved another piece of himself.
"It was still negligent." Maybe if she touches it, she'll be able to sleep. Be able to put it out of her head. In Tony's world, knowing is always preferable to not knowing.
He knows what he's looking for, because Steve had showed him this before. The idea was something he'd expect from Natasha, and for all he knew Natasha had helped with the execution; but Steve one evening had pulled him aside, showed him the safe, showed him the lock, showed him what was inside. "There's two sets for you," he'd said. "I'd like at least one set for everyone, but I had yours done first."
Tony shoves his hands in his pockets and displays his best, his smarmiest, his cockiest grin, the grin he reserves purely for investors or moments of great personal triumph, the grin that declares he'd eat shit and enjoy it. "That," he says, "and I have to fund my hobbies."
"Maybe," Friday says. "Depends on how long the time-delay is. There's a good chance of it, but if you're plannin' what you seem to be plannin', you should know it won't work when you can override me."
Tony's palms are broad and calloused, his arms hard with lean muscle, but his wrists have always been too delicate to belong to a man who doesn't flinch. When they had taken his gauntlets, the soldiers' hands were around his wrists. They hadn't touched his skin, because he still wore the undersheath with its golden lattice of peptide chains, but he'd felt the pressure of their fingers like manacles nonetheless.
Extremis could fix his ear. Maya had shut off his ability to heal rapidly, too, or else he wouldn't be bleeding, wouldn't be hearing that sucking whistle every time he breathed. He'd given himself the heart of a super-soldier, but apparently the heart of a super-soldier wasn't all that resilient.
He's lacking in certainty. That's what Reed is missing. He's occasionally unsure, but he always has this
. I'm not just talking about discovering the cure for cancer or building a safer car, I'm talking about improving on the baseline human in ways that make those cures unnecessary.
STARK: Absolutely. You can talk to the legal team if you don't believe me—I had the paperwork done up years ago.
Boynton, 68, has been a sitting senator for fourteen years. He is a Vietnam veteran, a recipient of the Congressional Gold Medal, and the Vice Chairman of the Senate Democratic Caucus. He is also tied for the record of most appearances by a U.S. senator on
"They were holed up in a cave, really," she says. "The mountains there are riddled with them, and the organization that held Stark had enlarged the natural structure to make a fortified base. Stark and Yinsen were held near the back of the base behind a steel door."
"Really," says Osborn, and his smile grows and grows. "Well now. Good thing for you that I've turned over a new leaf."
HH: We both know it is. And that's okay, boss, you're doing the right thing. Just don't let the cost get too high, all right?
If he allowed himself the luxury of missing things, though, he'd miss the Mansion; and he'd miss the West Coast; and he'd miss the simplicity of what his life had once been, the clarity of it, the sweep of desire that had let him sublimate himself instead of the agonizing, intent need to account for all factors at all times. Maybe he's kidding himself. Even at the height of his amoral debauchery, he was always able to care about the design, the company, the pursuit. Maybe he's kidding himself; he is a kidder.
Jack Kooning heaves a sigh that indicates he's carrying the weight of the world, that he acts solemnly and according to duty, that he doesn't want to deliver the heavy burden of news but knows he must.
"Because they're sentient," Tony says. "Because it's hard to program limits into AGI so they won't abuse or be abused by the system. Because we're one immoral competitor away from Ultron."
"Not since he backflipped out of a helicarrier," Tony says. "I don't know what Hill was expecting." Sometimes Tony thinks that if he could talk to Steve, really talk, just talk, he could engineer an understanding: but then he realizes that's the most fantastic What If of all. Steve doesn't change his mind. When he plants his feet, you could use his shoulders as a fulcrum to move mountains. And he doesn't change his mind for
"Why doesn't SI sell artificial general intelligences?" Lila wants to know. That's another thing he likes about her—not just that she never cuts him a break, which is a quality shared by all his favorite people, but that there's no end to her questions.
"We don't know that they aren't dumping bodies." She's too smart for his own good. Maybe this is what a father feels, when he looks at his child and sees how far beyond him they've grown. It's pride, maybe, or a sort of awe that is not untainted by wry resignation. Tony wouldn't know. Fatherhood is a state that escapes him.
"Scoot," Stevie says, and she edges into Tony's side to flip on the electric kettle. She takes up all the space in the room, and not only because of her size, although she's big—not much taller than Tony, herself a tall woman, but Cap's broad, with defined arms and the kind of shoulders that can move mountains. She could take apart a man in the time it took most men to blink, and there's a security in standing beside her that Tony has never been able to replicate under other conditions. Maybe it's less that Stevie takes up all the space in a room and more that she takes up all the space in Tony's room. Tony wouldn't know.
He almost gives it up, but then Steve looks at him, easy, expectant but not hurried, like he won't hold Tony's failings against him despite his willingness to take the measures necessary to safeguard the team, and although the weight of that attention is usually (always) enough to make Tony want to flinch, it also anchors him in a way that nothing else does. Ballast, but welcome ballast. If Steve were willing, if he gave Tony a favor, Tony would wear it forever.
"Looks like," Friday says. "Three hours remaining on armor lockout. The Avengers are still containing the situation."
Norriss's cause of death remains unknown, although officials have ruled out natural causes. Norriss is survived by his wife, Natalie Liu, and his cousin and financial backer, Sasha Hammer.
His skin has been replaced by tessellated memory metal and peptide chains, his eyes by a deep-spectra visual array. Over the ribs of his first body curves an assembly that houses a fractal antenna and synthetic aperture radar/lidar. Above that is the upper dorsal thorax ESD with its microwave lensing and RT core. There is no cuirass here, no pauldrons, no greaves; Iron Man is made of smart molecules and external suit devices, with some small remaining organic mass at his center. He has plans for that: Models 30 through 32 are already drafted and awaiting synthesis. He may have lost the art of it all, but the trade-off is more than fair.
He sets the shield down on the bed. It's neatly made, which you'd expect; there are books on the nightstand and a tablet on the desk, which you'd expect; there's a stack of sketchpads and a riot of artist's tools and a couple of pictures, all the pictures you'd expect. Steve was pretty neat, but not neurotically so, especially in this space where he didn't have to impose military order. The bed is made, but there's a few pairs of shoes right inside the door instead of in the closet, a jacket tossed on top of the dresser, a dirty coffee mug on top of the bookcase. The lampshade is askew. Tony straightens the lampshade. Someone should clean out this room. Steve's personal effects, those should go to someone who loved him—Sam, or Sharon—
"So! You nerds—I can say that, I'm a nerd myself, don't let the suit fool you—you're all here today for one reason. It's not because you're required to be here, or because you had nothing better to do on a Thursday afternoon. It's probably not because you all think I hid a car under your seat—this guy in the front row's not taking my word for it. Hey! Car Guy! Yeah, you, who do I look like I'm pointing at? Nothing under there, I promise. You can pull your head out from between your legs now.
Happy's not doing much. He's knocking around with his hands in his pockets, looking at the armor like he's a bored tourist in a museum. Happy likes to act like he's less than he is. For all his boss knows, he believes it, genuinely believes that he's just a washed-up pugilist with face of a bum, the talent of a hack, and the luck to get a girl too good for him. He's wrong, but good luck convincing him otherwise.
The air has been punched out of him. It takes a moment for him to get past the vacuum-suck in his lungs and start breathing again. "I don't… I don't know."
Said lead detective Selina Galli: "This kind of exotic weaponry is unusual, but it makes identifying the suspect much easier. Renada collected a number of enemies thanks to his line of work… We're investigating every possibility."
He'd give every dollar to his name in trade for the words to impress upon Steve why Tony can't yet have what he deserves. If he sits down right now in this hallway to wait to die because it's better than being Tony Stark for one more day, he isn't conceding to a point Steve never had to argue in the first place; he's abdicating responsibility. Steve may have believed that Tony deserved to die, but he believed in nothing so much as taking responsibility. That's what you do. You step up, you step forward. You volunteer to carry the weight. You get tough and chew grit and grow a spine. You take responsibility.
