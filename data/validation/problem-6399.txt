This feels good, it feels right. He's missed this companionship, having people around him that he likes and that genuinely like him in return. His company lately has consisted of greasy business men at board meetings that have never thought he was good enough to take over from his dad, and the SI R&D department, who are either too busy resenting his genius to pay attention to anything he has to say, or so in love with his genius that they spend the whole time he talks nodding and drooling and not actually paying attention to anything he says.
Tony gets cruel when he’s angry. He gets sharp and petty and very, very calculating, but he never lets that anger consume him physically. He becomes still and dangerous, a poised weapon ready to strike.
Steve doesn't even slow down as he approaches at breakneck speed, swinging his shield and downing two bots in seconds. He can see the Iron Man armor grappling with stuttering gauntlets at the leader's sparking fuse box, and the other Doombots doing their best to tear his teammate to pieces. Steve pummels robots with his shield and fists, and then there's a small explosion of light and everything stops. The army of Doombots drops to the pavement, unmoving, and Steve starts hauling them off of the dented red and gold figure lying motionless beneath them.
Tony rolls his eyes. “No need to be so sensitive, Cap. It’s not like anyone could have seen it coming, international intelligence agency crumbling around their ears and all that. I’m pretty sure there are a lot of other former employees out there wallowing over the fact that they no longer have a job, too, and they can’t even list it as a reference, since SHIELD doesn’t exist to most people. Well, didn’t, until Natasha leaked everything. Not that it would be a good idea to list them as a reference now anyway, I don’t think prospective employers will jump for joy at an applicant admitting that they worked for Hydra for the last ten years or so.”
“For what?” he asks hotly. He’s been so sad lately, so withdrawn and upset that he’s shocked at the anger burning up from within him. It’s sudden and powerful and he wants to lash out, make Steve feel how Steve made
Tony makes a sound in his throat, and it’s not pretty, but Steve seems to understand, because he squeezes Tony’s hand and continues talking.
His heart is breaking into a thousand sharp pieces and he wants to pretend nothing’s happened, but that’s not him. Tony’s done enough of that for both of them, trying to hold the pieces of them together when they so clearly don’t fit together anymore.
"Idiot," she says in English. She glares and now Tony has to avert his eyes. So much for bravery, he thinks. He waits but she doesn't say anything else, just picks up her book and settles back into her chair to read.
They’re interrupted when Jamie squeals loudly, not exactly keen on being squished between his two daddies. Or maybe it’s because he dropped his nappy, who knows. Steve chuckles and kisses Tony softly one more time before pulling away.
The suit releases him and someone pulls him out into the hallway and he collapses, retching onto the floor. He heaves and heaves until there’s nothing, he’s just gasping for breath and his vision is spotted with black but he can still see Steve and Jamie so clearly, can see the gun going off, can see the deep red of their blood, and he chokes again, on his hands and knees, body rocking forward.
“What’s the point of having Tony Stark for a friend if you don’t even let him pay for your food?” Tony quips. Instead of laughing, Steve looks slightly appalled.
Tony rises from his desk, closing the holographic windows displaying the newest Iron Man specs. He keeps them locked down because he can’t take another argument, not about Iron Man. The guy he gave up. The one he’s not supposed to be anymore. The one he’s always going to be, no matter what Pepper thinks.
Tony drags up a smile from somewhere. “Great, Cap, working on new network capabilities for SI, it’s hard work but it’s good work, keeps me busy, you know?”
Tony remembers what he was trying to say, why on earth he told Steve to stop. “Nothing, nothing’s wrong, I just want you to know I’m not with Pepper anymore, I don’t want you to think we’re, I’m, cheating. We broke up. Months ago.”
Tony’s eyes are blurring. He’s not crying, there’s no reason to cry over a fucking text message, he’s just overwhelmed and overtired and he has no idea what this means. Is it a breakup? Is Steve going to apologize? He doesn’t have to, it’s completely Tony’s fault for running his mouth, for ruining everything.
“You sure about that, Cap?” His voice is still a little shaky, but getting more steady as he speaks. “I meant it when I said I’m an asshole.”
Steve hasn’t said anything, just continues to walk steadily ahead. Tony shrugs to himself, decides to take advantage of it. He’s feeling talkative about it, for once, and Steve doesn’t seem to mind.
He takes his hot shower, spends most of it curled up on the floor like a pathetic teenager, trying to avoid feeling anything. If he lets himself think on it, he’ll lose it, he really will, because he gets that people cheat, he’s cheated before (he’s not proud of it), but he really fucking liked Steve, probably loved him, and Barnes was able to waltz right in and take him, take him
“Problem?” Tony sneers back, sarcastic. “I don’t have a problem. No problem at all. Just, you know, you coming to your boyfriend’s penthouse to tell him you’re leaving on a dangerous mission for an unspecified amount of time so you can go find your other, better boyfriend. No problem, though, I understand.” Tony takes a sip of his scotch, eyes burning.
“Yeah, well, people change, I’m a changed man,” Tony says, heading toward the main entrance to the facility.
“I was getting ready to leave anyway,” the guy says companionably, shrugging. He pushes himself up from his chair and grabs his jacket, swinging it over wide shoulders and tucking his book into an inside pocket. He wraps the scarf loosely around his neck.
But this, talking to Steve, even just that little bit, seemed surprisingly easy. Maybe it’s the anonymity of it, of talking to a complete stranger who isn’t being paid to listen to his fucked up thoughts and feelings and offer bullshit suggestions for dealing with his recurring nightmares. Maybe it’s that Steve is military, being over there in the sandbox the way Rhodey isn’t, not really, knowing the feel of the grit constantly between his teeth, day in and day out, every meal, regardless of how many times he rinses his mouth out. The feel of the sun beating down on the back of his neck, hotter than hell during the day, then the temperatures dropping him into a different kind of hell at night, seeping into his bones, making his joints ache.
Tony doesn’t know what to say to that, so he doesn’t say anything. He signals the waitress over with the check and hands her a bill entirely too large for their small meal and tells her to keep the change. He bats Steve’s hands away when he attempts to give him cash for his portion of the meal, laughing when Steve tries to shove it in his shirt pocket.
He stumbles forward a step before he rights himself, pulling his shoulders up and chin out. He can have a little dignity, even if his eyesight is starting to blur.
“So, Steve Rogers, no parties to bring in the New Year? Champagne flowing, confetti streaming, Auld Lang Syne-ing, and all that jazz?” He glances over to see Steve’s brow furrowed slightly.
Cap's gaze hardens, hand clenching around his glass a little tighter. “No, seeing as SHIELD no longer exists, I am currently out of a job. Thank you for reminding me,” he snaps, voice tight.
She feeds him half the bowl in silence until he waves her off, feeling like he can't eat another bite without either exploding or throwing up first, and Tony is really starting to feel like he's in the doghouse here and shouldn't they be thanking him? He saved them all.
Sam had left him a while back, before everything went down with the Mandarin, saying he had to get home, he had a life there, a job. He told Steve to call if he needed anything at all, or if he got a good lead, but Steve hasn't called. Sam did leave him with some advice: “He’s like a hurt animal, Steve. He’s gonna hide and lick his wounds, and he won’t come back ’til he’s ready. I know you want to be there for him, but chasing him around the world might just be making it worse. Let him come to you.”
Apparently yes, it was, because he turned the corner to the communal kitchen at 3 am to see that same super-soldier boyfriend locking lips with his newly recovered super-soldier best friend.
The three of them make short work of the remaining half dozen bots, and then it’s quiet except for their heavy breathing. Surprisingly, Barnes speaks first.
Cap looks up at that. His gaze is steady and measuring. “Tony. Thank you for what you’ve done for me, and for helping with Bucky. It’s more than enough.” He stands, readying himself to leave. Tony stands along with him.
Tony doesn’t even realize he falls asleep until he wakes up to Steve placing him gently in his own bed. He honestly doesn’t remember the last time he slept in the penthouse. He forgot how comfortable his bed is. He groans and flops his head to the side, eyes squinting open.
He looks out over the heads of the crowd toward the dance floor, searching for Tony. His clothes make him difficult to find, all black in a dimly lit club, but Steve’s super soldier eyes are sharp enough to pick him out. Tony’s near the edge of the dance floor, drink in hand, leaning in to talk into the ear of a tall woman in a short red dress with legs for days. Steve feels a pang of irritation; Tony brought him here, why isn’t he talking to Steve? Is Steve too boring? Does he come with too much baggage? Would Tony rather hit it off with some woman he doesn’t even know than spend time with his ex-teammate? Then why not come alone? Why drag Steve here with him?
“Shh. You’re okay. You’re going to be okay. Just stay with me. You're going to be fine.” Tony closes his eyes, drifting. There is movement around him, pressure on different parts of his body, but he can’t feel it, not really. He lays there, content to listen to Steve’s voice as he fades slowly in and out of consciousness.
Steve knows Sam means well, but it’s just not something he wants to talk about. He shakes his head and continues punching the heavy bag.
FRIDAY computerized voice cuts across the music. “Boss, Steve is here. He’s on his way up to the penthouse now.”
He looks over and Steve isn't moving. His hands are resting in his lap and he’s staring at Tony’s drink on the low table in front of them.
There are smiles around the room and murmurs of agreement. Tony breathes a (careful) sigh of relief, glad he can put off defending his actions for now. He's sure he's going to hear it later but right now he just wants to see that everyone is safe and alive and he's going to live to be yelled at another day.
“Tony.” The way he says Tony’s name has Tony’s eyes flooding again and he swipes them away angrily. Steve lets go of Tony’s other hand and reaches up to cup Tony’s face in his big palms, thumbs stroking gently across his cheekbones. “I’m not ashamed of you.” Tony makes a noise and Steve cuts him off. “I’m not. I have my own— issues, I guess,” he smiles, self-deprecating, before he’s serious again and he continues, “and I need to work them out, but it’s not you, Tony, it was never you. I’m so, so
Before he knows it, it’s been almost two months since the breakup, and Bucky is a full member of the new Avengers, and Tony isn’t even jealous, because if it makes Steve happy, he’s happy. Well, not happy, but it’s good enough for him. Steve deserves this, a family, and his best friend back, and Tony can’t be mad about that. It’s more than Tony deserves, anyway.
“It’s fine, you didn’t want to be rude, I get it. Don’t worry about it. It’s just easier to skip all the bullshit sometimes, you know?” Tony says wryly. He gives a little laugh that Steve decides he hates and throws back the rest of his drink before signaling for another.
Tony rolls his eyes and heaves an exasperated sigh. “Nobody wants to see me, Steve. Besides maybe Rhodey, but that’s different. I’m not an Avenger anymore, and I’m pretty sure they remember why.”
They have good days and bad days, and Tony tries not to worry too much that most times even the good days have their moments. That’s just how they are, Tony and Steve, they’re two totally different people with two very different backgrounds, and it’s only expected that there are a few bumps in the road. Tony can get under Steve’s skin like no one else can, and he knows it’s the same the other way around.
There's a wide swath of bandages around his middle, thickest on his right side, with several more on his chest. He's got a pretty large one on his left thigh as well, and when Tony experimentally tries to move his leg agony spikes from his hip to his toes and spots flood his vision, and he has to take a few deep breaths before he doesn't feel like he's going to puke up the meager contents of his stomach.
He registers the fact that his armored hands have shoved past the forcefield before he feels the first shocks running through his body. They’re sharp, horribly painful, like he’s gripped a live telephone wire tight in both hands, and the jolts run from his fingertips and into his chest, down through the rest of his body, and he can feel his heart falter with each pulse. It’s like another heartbeat, one that’s trying to overtake his own and is probably going to win the fight.
“Hey, Tony,” Steve says. He sounds good. Less tortured, lighter. There’s a lump suddenly constricting his throat. He clears it as subtly.
“Get dressed,” he says. His voice comes out rougher than he expected, but he clears his throat and tries again. “We’re going right now, go put some clothes on and tell the team. I’ll be right behind you.” Steve nods and turns around, leaving the room and shutting the door quietly behind him.
And since his second “rebirth”, opening his eyes nearly seventy years later. Watching videos of the history he’d missed, and the wars nobody ever won or ever learned from, all of the pointless death, the atomic bomb. Standing on the edge of the SHIELD helicarrier as it lifted him into the sky. The son of Howard Stark hurling truth wrapped in insults, not afraid or intimidated by Captain America towering over him. Aliens crashing through a 3-dimensional portal, intent on wrecking his city, his home. Tony Stark, making that sacrifice play. Tony Stark, falling back to earth, surviving, overcoming once again.
He unlocks it, checking his texts. Several from Rhodey, a couple from Pepper reminding him about some meeting tomorrow that he’s got to tell her he won’t be at, and then—
“To Asgardian liquor,” Tony shouts across at him, and it takes Steve a second before he puts two and two together. He clinks his glass against Tony’s and takes a large swallow of the Asgardian-scotch cocktail. The Asgardian liquor is nearly tasteless, so Steve’s able to appreciate the smokey flavor of the expensive scotch Tony ordered. It’s exciting, in a way, to be able to drink with someone and know that his drink is having the same effect on him as theirs is on them.
Tony nods solemnly. “I shot a 162 at the last charity golf tournament I played at.” Steve nearly chokes on his beer, coughs as he sets it down on the bar. He doesn’t know golf that well, but he knows enough to know that’s awful. Tony grins while he slaps him on the back genially.
The pub is dim and dirty, dark wood countertops sticky with all the beers spilled on it over the years, the scent of sour alcohol and stale air almost cloying. It doesn’t bother Steve. It’s almost a balm to his restlessness, a glimpse back in time to when he and the Commandos would find some dingy pub to call theirs for a few nights, drinking and having as much of a good time as a man serving in wartime could have. The damp air reminds him of camaraderie, and friendship, and a little bit of grief tugs at his heart, for then and for now.
He turns to Bruce urgently. “Bruce, listen to me.” Bruce is breathing heavily, but he locks eyes with Tony. Tony shakes him slightly. “You cannot go green, okay buddy? That’ll just give them another reason to take you in.” Bruce looks at him, looks past him, and Tony shakes him again, a little harder. “Do you hear me? You can’t hulk out, Bruce.” Bruce gives him a little nod, and it’s the best Tony’s going to get so he nods in return.
Steve snorts and rolls his eyes. Tony grins at him shamelessly. Steve does like it, especially when he smiles like that, but he’s not telling Tony that.
“No, Steve. I’m not changing my mind on this. I’m not Iron Man anymore, I’m just Tony Stark, billionaire, genius, playboy, philanthropist,” he says wryly.
“Why is he here, Steve?” He gestures angrily at Sam, hovering in the background. “Moral support while you break my heart? Someone to reminisce with later about just how pathetic Tony Stark can be?”
He’s turning back to call his suit to him when Steve grabs his arm, halting his progress. He looks back at his husband, with their child in his arms, and Tony suddenly wants to say screw it, let the rest of the Avengers handle it, he’s staying right here with his family.
Steve feels numb. They are reporting that the President is okay, rescued by Colonel Rhodes in the Iron Patriot/War Machine armor, but they haven’t said anything about Tony, or Pepper.
“Let me guess,” Tony interrupts. He takes a sip of his very expensive brandy and swirls it around in his mouth, savoring the taste. Only the best. Swallowing, he continues, “Turns out your assassin friend is harder to find than you expected, and with no SHIELD resources to back you up—Good job with that, by the way, they had it coming with their secrets upon secrets thing they had going on—now you need my help. Sound about right?” He finishes, and downs the rest of his glass.
Tony takes them into the city. It’s a decently long drive, but time passes relatively quickly. Tony chats incessantly about SI and asks about the team and how training is coming along and they’re bouncing ideas off of each other like no time has passed at all and they’re still living in the tower discussing training tactics and strengths and weakness. Steve’s missed this companionship with Tony, and he thinks maybe Tony missed it too, judging by the way his face lights up as he talks. He’s smiling a lot, and when he’s not Steve can still see it in his eyes, the crows feet at the corners.
“I’m hit, by the way. Not bad, but I’m not moving for the time being,” Clint announces, voice casual but strained.
, okay? He’s fucking wicked with his dry sense of humor and his sneaky mouth and Tony thought he was in trouble before but he’s fucked now, because he’s head over heels for the guy and there’s nothing he can do about it.
, and Tony’s here thinking about only himself, like he’s always done. Even Bucky fucking Barnes, the fucking
When Tony comes back to himself, Steve pulls out slowly, tying off the condom and tossing it into the trash bin across the room. Tony hmphs an impressed noise and Steve shrugs, smiling, before he leans over to kiss Tony softly on the mouth. Tony whines when he pulls away, so Steve pecks him on the end of the nose, once on each eyelid, and then again on the mouth, eyes open and gazing into in his, and Tony’s heart clenches in a way that has nothing to do with the failing arc reactor. Eyes flicking between Steve’s, he takes a chance.
"Tony," he's pleading. He doesn't know when he started talking. All he knows is he's got one hand holding Tony's blood inside his body and another running through his hair in some weak gesture of comfort, for him or for Tony, he doesn't know, he's not sure it matters. "Tony, can you hear me? Tony, please answer me. Please." His voice is breaking, his eyesight is blurred. Where the hell is Bruce?
Tony opens his mouth, to say what exactly he doesn’t know, deny it or brush it off, he’s not good with thank yous and he’s not used to people being so direct, he’s in business and politics and people saying anything but what they really mean. But before he can say anything at all, Rogers continues.
Steve breaks eye contact first, mumbles something about using the restroom. He makes his way to the back of the bar, stumbles into the stall and leans back against the door. His breath is coming in sharp pants and he needs to get a hold of himself. Nobody knows he’s Steve Rogers. He’s supposed to be keeping a low profile, staying under the radar in case something goes awry at this conference. He’s not supposed to be meeting up with Tony fucking Stark at a seedy pub, having heart to hearts and breaking down in front of the guy.
They’re so close now their shoulders bump gently when they walk, and then Tony feels warm fingers weave themselves between his and he squeezes back. He can feel that he’s grinning like a loon, and when he looks Steve’s way his cheeks are flushed pink and Tony would bet one of his private jets that it’s not all from the chill outside.
Steve’s frozen for a few seconds, staring at Tony’s closed eyelids, before he has the presence of mind to gently push him away.
It’s now or never, so Tony dives in, thrusters firing at full power, hands outstretched. He smashes into the Doombot and carries it with him, over Barnes’s motionless body, and they crash into the wall of a neighboring building, four stories above the ground.
Tony’s having a fierce internal debate with himself. Should he invite Steve up or not? On one hand, Tony’s at least partially convinced Steve wouldn’t be against the idea. And he seems like the kind of guy who can be discreet, won’t go spreading rumors tomorrow morning or selling a story to the papers. On the other hand…
“The rest is history. It was the Accords or retire. Or become a fugitive, I guess,” Tony finishes ruefully.
He’s gasping around the tears now, trembling violently, and Tony reaches out blindly, hands finding Bucky’s clenched ones. Bucky’s still for a moment, and then his hands shift and turn and they’re clasping Tony’s firmly back.
He makes eye contact with Yinsen as there’s another rumbling, and it sounds like an explosion this time, a little deeper and a little closer. They cover their heads as some bigger rocks come tumbling down, and the electricity flickers but steadies after a moment. Tony wants whatever it is to just stop already, it’s putting their project in danger, but he doesn’t, because what if it’s a rescue? What if they’ve found him? Tony Stark’s gone missing, there’s got to be people searching for him. And Rhodey was there, in the hum-vee behind him, and Tony doesn’t think it got hit in the attack, and what if it’s him, coming to find Tony finally?
Tony turns to the leader bot, hovering in front of it. It seems to understand that something is happening, because all of a sudden the sounds of fighting and explosions behind him stops, and he knows the thing is calling all the remaining bots here.
“Stay?” he asks, pleading. He’s been pretty pathetic tonight but he’s beyond caring now. He’s still not ready to let this go. Not yet. He just wants tonight. If he’s going to die, if he can’t have this for real, he at least wants tonight.
All of the little details Tony couldn’t see on the surveillance footage in his lab jump out at him now: the bags under his eyes, the shaggy hair sadly in need of a trim (strange on such a put-together guy like Captain America—Tony can’t think of a time the Captain hadn’t had that ruler straight part and perfectly combed hair, even in the middle of a battle), the defeated posture and tired slope of his (insanely) wide shoulders.
Steve goes back to kissing and sucking his way down Tony’s neck, which Tony is totally okay with, and then he tugs at Tony’s bowtie with his teeth, which Tony is absofuckinglutely one hundred percent okay with as well. Capturing both of Tony’s smaller wrists in one of his enormous hands, he draws the other slowly down Tony’s arm, wrist to elbow to shoulder, drags his fingers teasingly across Tony’s collarbone, yanks gently at his bowtie. It comes undone easily and Steve gets to work unbuttoning Tony’s starched white dress shirt.
it’s Steve’s towel, because this isn’t hard enough without being reminded of him every fucking second — he roughly brushes it against the back of his hand, dislodging most of the larger pieces of glass embedded in his skin. Then he wraps the towel around the whole thing and leaves the bathroom, carefully looking at the floor as he climbs back into bed.
Steve looks at him, eyes sharp, taking everything in. “I didn’t mean to make you upset. I just saw you here and wanted to ask how you were doing.”
It’s been a particularly long day, and it’s the middle of the week so Tony’s not expecting company. He’s sprawled on his black leather couch, head tilted back against the cushions, humming along to the classic rock music he’s got playing softly in the background. There’s a StarkPad on the seat next to him, but he’d abandoned that a while ago, when his vision got a little blurry. He’s on his fourth glass of high-end scotch now, and if they’re a little more full than they should be when he refills, no one needs to know. It’s just him, and his music, and a whole 12 hours until he has to be at a meeting tomorrow.
“Why am I even asking you? You don’t know how to have fun.” And it’s like before, when Tony’s jokes were just a little too pointed and Steve took everything just a little too personally, and Steve forgets that he’s supposed to have grown out of this. He takes it as a challenge.
“We then proceed to start a torrid phone sex relationship for the next seven days, then go our separate ways, though he’ll never be the same, really, and all of his relationships will fall short, though he won’t want to admit
“That’s great, Tony.  That’s—I mean, yeah, that’s great, but that happens in cases like this.  The limbs may move.  It may even seem purposeful when we—when we want it--I mean we don’t know—“ Bruce began.
No, wait.  That wasn’t…he hadn’t meant to think that.  It was the alcohol, Tony thought, glancing down somewhat dubiously at the red solo cup still perched precariously on the edge of the nightstand where he’d left it.  Some kind of punch, Ty had said.  He wasn’t sure.  Ty said it was good.  It had tasted like cough syrup to Tony and left a funny, bitter taste in the back of his now-dry throat, like he had sucked on a particularly vile piece of cotton, but God only knew what passed for a mixer at a place like this.
“Do you think he truly means to take you to visit the Free States one day?” Cam asked, sounding merely curious. The Free States, though, Steve noted. Not your home, no, Cam was too careful for that. “I think he will,” Cam continued. “Once he has an heir or two, most likely. Then he will be able to travel more freely. You will see. And then you shall truly be able to see the Dark Sea, and be glad to cross it as befits your station. And you would see your friends. You would like that. They will rejoice to see you, too, I think. Then they will know that the King is a good and kind king, and that you are happy here with us. This will give them much comfort, I think.”
“Escort the Raj’Inama back to our chambers while I, er, enjoy my time with Lord Ellis,” Tony ordered, struggling to keep the lack of enthusiasm out of his voice.  “Bruce, would you care to return now or are you going to keep picking flowers?”
it.  He squeezed his eyes shut, then opened them and looked back down at his hand. Bucky stared back at him, dangling from the railing while Steve stood there, moored to the spot with horror.
“No,” Steve said quickly.  “No, I want to go. Need to go.  Anyone but me, he gets a bit testy with them. It’s the medication.  Messes with his head sometimes, and, well.  I mean, it’s not just the medicine, but…everything that’s happened, he’s—it’s hard on him.  He blames himself, you know, and I’ve told him, if it was me there in that bar, I’d have done the same thing.  I tell him, it’d be him up on stage and it would take a hell of a lot longer to get the money, nickels at a time, you know?” Steve said, shooting Tony a half-embarrassed, half-apologetic twist of a smile.  “But, it wasn’t me, it was him, and now, with everything…” he trailed off, turning back to look at the Strip and away from Tony.  “It’s not that I don’t want to see him.  I do. He’s my best friend.  It’s just…it’s always there.  Him.  Taking care of him. He doesn’t have anyone else.  I’m not complaining, but…this, the last few days, it’s like some kind of—of dream or fairy tale or something crazy, I don’t know.  Going back there, seeing him…it’s…”
beautiful.  You really made this?  In that cave?” Steve asked, shaking his head. He didn’t wait for Tony to answer.  He already knew, anyway. This was what saved Tony. This beautiful, delicate, terrible, incredible thing.  It saved Tony, which made it more beautiful than anything Steve had ever seen.
He stopped.  Looked around.  Tried to take it all in and find some sort of context for it.  He looked around for Zola, but the man didn’t materialize.  Just as he turned to ask the guards, he saw the door shutting behind him and heard the key turn in the lock.  He stepped forward, his feet sinking into a soft, thick carpet that covered the tile floor.  A long couch, covered with plump, silk pillows dotted with tassels at their corners, was in front of him, flanked by two gilded chairs stuffed with fat, feather filled cushions.
“He’s never walked away from a fight.  He’s not walking away from this one,” Tony replied, keeping his eyes on Steve’s face, thumb running rhythmically back and forth over the back of Steve’s hand.  “He wouldn’t do that,” Tony finished with a firm nod.
Sometimes, Steve told him stories about his home, though Anto didn’t understand it all.  He listened, though. It helped with the words, to listen, and he just liked hearing Steve talk.  Once, he pointed at Steve’s amulet, and Steve explained that it was his symbol, and that everyone was given one when they went through their coming of age ceremony, and it was how they would find the people they loved in the next world, when they may look different.   Anto wished he had a symbol, but at least he would know to look for Steve’s, if that was how the spirit-world worked, though he thought he would know Steve, even without a symbol. He would just know. Maybe there were so many Others, they couldn’t remember each other, he allowed.  He would remember Steve, though. He wondered if Steve would remember him. If Steve even wanted to remember him. He didn’t try to ask. He wasn’t sure he wanted an answer.
“You know, when the For Sale ad for this place boasted a well-stocked pond, I imagined something far different,” Steve pointed out, raising his eyebrows as he looked down at Tony.
“Right.  I need everything you can find on glassblowing.  And art therapy.  And PTSD.  And flexion spinal fractures.  Nerve damage.  Microsurgery.  Physical therapy,” Tony ticked off the list in his head.  “Don’t we fund some kind of recovery center for wounded veterans?  We should.  Let’s do that.  We also need to improve vehicle protection on our ground transports, too, I’ll take a look at—“
“That’s enough,” Steve’s voice snapped like a whip-crack through the room.  “Tony,” Steve called out, walking towards him and brushing past Barnes with a hard, pointed look.  “Let’s go.”
Many of you probably don't remember it, but there was a movie called Frequency that featured a father and son communicating via a cross-time radio link.  I thought that was a neat idea for Steve and Tony.  I'm not sure what, if anything, I'll do with this, since I have two WiPs going as it is, but the plot bunny wouldn't leave me alone until I wrote something.
“Those aren’t events, Tony, those are you’ve had an idea and want someone to listen to you moments,” Bruce said.
His gaze lingered on Tony a moment, before slipping away down the hall at the sound of raised voices.  Obie was trying to talk about something to do with the stock, but Howard was on some tired tangent about the time he invested in a production company, made a terrible movie and built a UAV camera that eventually ended up in some military drones.  Tony remembered fiddling around with it, trying to make a movie about the garden gnomes until one of them pulled a Humpty-Dumpty.  Tony had heard the story a dozen times, but Howard liked to remind everyone that even his failures weren’t really failures.  Just genius that had yet to be recognized.  Tony wanted to throw something at his head.  Preferably a camera.
“The hell you aren’t, Rogers!  I’ve put up with your whiny, loser bullshit for months and for what?  A lousy lay?
“I know.  It really annoys him,” Steve replied, wiping the smile from his face with one hand, though not before Tony caught it and gave him an annoyed look. “Clint’s Hawkeye,” Steve said.
“I’ve seen your suits enough to know that’s not true,” Steve countered, still trying to take everything in as they walked further into the museum, past the ticket kiosks and information desk.  Tony looked at him out of the corner of his eye, wondering, not for the first time, what it was about Steve that let him look past the flash and bang and see the beauty underneath.   It took him a moment, but he realized he wasn’t thinking about the suits, not really, his stomach suddenly clenching as he squinted at Steve.  I’m not going to lose this, he vowed to himself.  Not now that I know I had it.
“There is so much, so much, that I would show you, so much we could do...A war rages that you barely know about, and--and I would have you by my side again, if I could,” Tony told him, his voice soft and rough, almost beseeching.  “I do not ask you to forget your family.  I would never do that. For them, you will pass into memory.  Good memories, I have no doubt.  You’ve made a difference, Steve, you really have. But, there is a new family waiting for you.  You can be reborn, as you once were, young and stronger and faster than you can imagine. A new life, if you want it. If you do not,” Tony broke off, looking away, his face stretched thin, “then I will offer you that, too,” he finished, turning dark eyes back to Steve.
“Great.  Ellis it is, then,” Steve agreed with a quick nod, like they had settled something, and, in Steve’s mind, Tony supposed they had, which, honestly, made Tony want to roll up the newspaper and whack him on the nose with it until he learned.
Shellhead rolled his mouth a bit, then hefted up two enormous crabs, each hanging by one tentacle.  Each had two large pincers and six spindly legs, making them look a bit more like some kind of sea spider than crabs.  Shellhead dropped them unceremoniously over the side of the boat before Steve could say anything, making Steve jerk backwards as the crabs scuttled around the bottom of the boat, intent on escape, perhaps by clawing through the hull, Steve could only assume.  Shellhead wasted no time in slamming his tentacle down on top of each of them in rapid succession. The both went still a moment later, once they apparently realized they were quite dead.
Steve picked up the cup of cold tea.  I hope you are still able to build your machines, old friend, Steve thought, looking down at his hands to steady them. The papery skin stretched over bones that cracked and ached when he tried to use them now, but once, once they held a shield like no other and helped shape the fate of the world. Hard to believe, looking at them now, all spotted with age and dappled with bruises that seemed to appear from no discernible cause.
“’Night, Tony.  Sleep well,” Steve offered as he pulled out one of the kitchen table chairs and started opening his stack of clear, plastic containers.
The person looking back at him was wide-eyed, with dark circles from last night’s mascara casting judgment on him this morning, hair askew, still trying to be slicked down in spots while the rest of it decided to try to pull off an 80’s permed look.  He quickly wet his hands and combed his fingers through it, trying to make it look at least like he hadn’t tried to partially electrocute himself last night.  He grabbed a tissue and wet it, then dabbed at the dark circles until he just looked hungover instead of like he’d lost a fight to the MAC counter.
“Here, I have brought you food from the feast,” Cam said in a rush, arranging things on the table in front of Steve.  “The King said that I may return to the hall if you’ve no need of me, but I am to tell him in great detail how you fare.  So,” he gulped down air. “How do you fare?”
Tony’s gut clenched, and he tried to get enough saliva in his mouth to swallow, but that was apparently a losing battle.
he knew it, he knew him, that voice, didn’t he?--but just as before, the path was empty. He was alone. He looked back up at the castle.  The voice was in his head, he was sure of it this time.
“So. So, I'm just going to go inside,” Tony said haltingly. “To sleep. 'Night.” It wasn't exactly asking for permission, but it was, at the same time, and a small voice inside his head added
Steve rinsed out his mouth and headed into the bedroom, where Brock sat on top of the covers, drinking a beer from the mini-fridge, which he pointed at the now-muted TV where a stock picture of Tony Stark in a black tuxedo on a stage somewhere flashed across the screen.  It was the only light in the room, and Steve couldn’t help but look.  He’d seen the picture before.  It was one of the more flattering ones, Steve thought, though having seen the man in person now, it occurred to Steve that it didn’t quite do him justice.  It was the eyes.  They were softer in person.  Kinder. Or, at least, they were right up until he made his insane offer or prank or whatever it was.
His ears buzzed.  His throat seized up, and he couldn’t swallow.  His tongue felt too big for his mouth all of a sudden. His chest felt like it weighed a ton, like just the effort to expand and contract his lungs might be too much. White-hot agony burned through his chest as he struggled to find air.
“My parents are dead,” Steve told him, though saying it didn’t sting the way it once had, when he kept tripping over my dad is dead to backtrack and remember it was both of them now.
Steve drew back, blinking at Stark in shock.  “You’d pay me a thousand dollars to answer your question?”
“My defining character trait. Or so I’m told,” Tony agreed nonchalantly, giving Steve a slight nod then tilting his head with a sigh. “Steve, I’m serious. I’d like to hear what you have to say.  Both are rare circumstances for me, so don’t be shy.”
“I promise.  I promise, Tony.  I’m sorry.  I’m so sorry, Tony. I can’t—you were gone.  You were gone. You were gone, and I’m
“Incredibly hot guy still single and willing to go on a blind date?” Steve asked.  “What’s wrong with him?”
“Eh.  Well.  I mean.  I wasn’t exactly not looking,” Tony admitted.  “I think we both know that.  You came out, and…truth be told, I couldn’t take my eyes off you.”  He dropped his gaze down to his plate and twirled his fork against the edge, picking apart the cannelloni without eating it, then looked back up at Steve with an apologetic grimace.
“I’m trying, you ass,” Tony shouted back over a throng of students cutting their way between them.  “You want me to go through every messed up thing about me?  We’re going to need to sit down. This might take a while.”
Huge thank you to tastes-like-coconut for the beta.  She is an incredible artist.  You should look her up on tumblr.
Tony burst out laughing, which was, he knew, incredibly inappropriate and rude, but he couldn’t help himself.  It was all suddenly just too much, though Coulson’s bland expression didn’t falter.
“Tony,” Steve called out softly at the same time his hand reached over and covered Tony’s where it lay on the seat between them, threading his fingers through Tony’s against the leather of the seat.  It reminded Tony of his thoughts while he and Steve were curled up on the sofa.  How badly he had wanted to twine his hand into Steve’s, to feel that connection, and here it was, offered up freely and without expectation.  It was wonderful and terrible at the same time.  So near to what he wanted.  He could close his eyes and push away that single sliver of space between what he had and what he wanted.
“’Course I am. I’m with you,” Steve replied in the same easy, certain tone that Steve seemed able to say those kinds of things in, like he wasn’t handing Tony a piece of his heart each time.  Or, maybe that’s why it was so easy for him.  He wasn’t giving Tony anything Tony didn’t already have.  His ring, the one with the hands holding the heart, flashed through Tony’s mind.
“I’m sorry for hurting you,” Steve said, keeping his eyes on Tony, drinking him in.  I’m so sorry, he thought, feeling the familiar tug in his gut whenever he thought of Tony.  I should have told you the truth from the beginning. All I could think about was not losing him again, not failing him again, and I just ended up doing that to you instead.   “More sorry than you’ll ever know.”
“Tony, no island. Why do you even want an island all of a sudden? What, by all that is holy and good, is going on here?” Pepper demanded.  “Look, would you just come back to the Tower?  I’m sure this Captain…Steve…whatever…will be just fine.  You admitted so yourself, so would you just…whatever this is, would you just stop it already, before Fury puts a stop to it?  I do not need to deal with a PR disaster because you and SHIELD get into some kind of dust-up over…over whatever this is,”  Pepper requested, breathing deeply.
“You’re just going to let him walk away when all this is said and done, huh?  Steve,” Barnes spat out, voice threaded with anger and frustration.  “Guy like that, and you’re just going to pat him on the back and thanks for the memories or whatever?” Barnes demanded.   “You’re an idiot.”
“Right,” Tony continued, “so, the way I see it, we have a sort of friends with benefits thing. Very weird benefits, but the point stands. You share your Gift, you feel better, and we keep going on our little voyage of discovery until we find your people. There’s literally no reason not to do this. It helps both of us, right? Besides, the whole Gift sharing thing was--if you put aside the dying of palladium poisoning, asphyxiating in space, communication via mind meld, and Barbarella-eat-your-heart-out-alien-sex--actually barely my top three weirdest sexual things, so. Friends with benefits. It’s a thing. An Earth thing, and I know that you would normally share this with your mate, but I really think this can work, is what I’m saying. A temporary fix, anyway, but a fix. Like...duct tape.”
As they made the front of the building Tony waved to the car window, behind which he assumed Rhodey was making a what-the-hell-face. He followed Steve down to the bus stop and stood next to him, rubbing at his arms in the cold. Would've brought his coat if he'd known the evening would involve the outdoor variety of stalking.
He hadn’t even noticed the photos being taken, truth be told.  He’d been far too engrossed in Steve to pay attention to anything else, though he supposed that pretty well sold the whole twitterpated newlyweds thing.
“You really like it?  You aren’t just saying that because of the great sex?” Tony asked, settling back down on Steve’s thigh.
“No jumping off things,” Tony admonished lightly as he lifted Steve up to his chest.  “No falling from things.  No leaping off things assuming people—people who are not me, I might add—will just catch you.  While we’re at it, no getting shot.  No taking a beating because you still have your half of the best friend necklace.  No nearly drowning.  No deciding you’ll just hang out on falling cities.  Have I told you that you might not be the best decision-maker when it comes to your own safety?  Because, I’m not judging, but I’m kind of seeing a pattern here.”
There was a tang of coppery metal there, too, mixed in with the familiar, comforting scents, splotches on the uniform that were too dark for sweat.  The backs of Steve’s knuckles were still smeared with brownish-red streaks, and crusty flecks darkened the ridges of his fingernails.  Steve had been busy, Tony thought, though there wasn’t really any satisfaction to it—maybe later, but not yet--just a solid sort of certainty.
Steve was warm. Not hot or cold anymore.  Just warm.  He ached, but like running a long way and slowly coming to a halt.  His breathing was shallow, but steady, almost like…dreaming of being asleep.  Finally, Tony nudged Steve’s chin up with one finger until Steve managed to return his gaze, though there was a halo of softness at the edges of his vision, as if someone had rubbed the colors into smoothness.
“I did an after-hours thing for him a while back.  Like—uh, like—for you,” Steve stammered, because the words didn’t seem to want to cooperate.  “During some weapons industry convention they were having here.  We had a…misunderstanding about the nature of the services I would be providing.  I handled it,” Steve stated in what he hoped was an even, unremarkable tone.
“You, too,” Sam said, pushing Dominic’s shoulder to nudge him into motion when he seemed rooted to the spot.
A large white, blue-striped bus pulled up, tires splashing through the sludge that trickled along the edge of the road. A woman with a toddler bundled up in a pink Hello Kitty jacket stepped on first, then Steve, and Tony followed behind him. He felt his phone vibrate in his suit pocket. Rhodey, he assumed. Steve passed by the driver and sat down. Tony moved after him, grinning at Steve's look.
“Make the face all you want, it’s good this way,” Steve said without sparing Tony a glance, but there was a small smile tugging at the corner of his mouth as he chewed.  “You should eat something, too.  You didn’t have enough breakfast.”
“First, this is classified.  What I’m telling you, I got from a guy I know, because this shit is above even my pay grade.  There was an op.  It went south.  They were at a place called Gulmira.  Looking for you, maybe, my guy wouldn’t say.  Him and his squad.  Got pinned down there, with the Ten Rings all around them using civilians as human shields. Which meant no air support, no back-up, just them, for three weeks, snipers picking ‘em off, taking shells, missiles, whatever.  Not the kind you build in your garage, either, but some pretty sophisticated stuff.”
Steve turned into Tony’s embrace, wrapping his arms around him and letting his head fall to rest on Tony’s forehead.  “It’ll be okay.  You’ll see.  They’ll come around as soon as they see it working.  No one likes change. Well, except you.”
“Brooklyn, originally,” Steve acknowledged with a grin as he thought of home.  “My mom is here,” Steve heard himself say.  “And Bucky.  I’ve known him since we were kids.  He said he could get me on at the construction company.  So, it just seemed like as good a place as any.”
Tony glanced at him, his face sharp and shrewd. “You keep saying that.  I don’t have to. I can if I want to,” he shook his head, his voice tight.  He laughed, though it wasn’t really a laugh.  Steve didn’t like how it sounded on him, how it looked on him. Tony shouldn’t look like that.  “I don’t think that means what you think it means,” he finished in a flat, dull voice.
Steve had stopped filling his backpack, gone still mid-motion so one hand was still holding the end of a book while the other held the bag. He wasn't looking at Tony, and Tony followed his gaze to the line of glass vases on the bookshelf by the pictures and the files.
“Relax, Tony.  Let me take care of you,” Steve urged, voice soft and throaty as he let go of Tony’s neck.
Tony took a sip of his bottled water, then nearly choked on it as he caught sight of the sketch.  It was him, inside the power loader from Aliens, with a squirrel holding a missile perched on his shoulder.  DUM-E was on one side of him attempting to pick up a round, cartoon bomb with a lit fuse, and U was on the other side with a fire extinguisher at the ready.  A wide grin split Tony’s face as he looked at the drawing.  He cast a glance over his shoulder, but Steve was already out of the garage.  He quirked his mouth and bit his lip.  A warm, loose bolt of pleasure raced through him, curling around inside until it settled in the center of his chest.
“He told you what he saw.  On the Valkyrie. With the Red Skull. That’s what you mean, isn’t it?” Tony asked, almost not wanting an answer. Fury didn’t answer, which Tony supposed was answer enough.  “Look, that’s exactly what I’m saying. He needs people around him, to help him figure all this stuff out. These special people, or whatever.  People he can trust, who would have his back. I mean, I don’t know where you find people like that.  Probably not Monster.com.  But, yeah, that.  You should do that.”
“Why should I take him?” Clint asked as he stowed his bow and arrows on the Quin-Jet.  He shot Tony a disgruntled look as he made his way to sit in the pilot’s chair, pointedly not taking the squirming baby from Tony’s hands, which served to lull Steve into a false sense of accomplishment long enough that he loosened his grip on one of the armor panels in time for Tony to hold him out at arm’s length.  Steve looked bewildered, then managed accusing and sucked in air like he was going diving.
himself from coming.  I want to come with him inside me, though, he realized, gripping the bedding so hard he felt the sheets pull away from the mattress.
He managed to brace his forearms on either side of Tony’s head, hands threading through Tony’s tousled hair, head dipping forward to bury against Tony’s shoulder. Steve could feel Tony’s hands running over his back in slow, gentle strokes.  Tony was making soothing, shushing sounds into Steve’s temple.  Steve wondered why, then realized he was still shuddering, and some kind of half-sob, half-gasps were being torn from his throat.  He wanted to tell Tony that it had been too good, too much, too everything, but he couldn’t get his throat to do more than try to swallow over a sand-dry patch.
This was the beginning he’d been waiting for, spending his life pushing forward, reaching out for something that he couldn’t find, but it had always been there, waiting.  It’s up.  I’ve been leaning forward for so long, my head was against the wind, and I could only see one foot in front of the other.
Tony gulped, forced himself to swallow, and nodded.  Steve lifted Tony’s hips and slid part of the wrap underneath him.  Deft hands pulled the long ends of the sash around, twisted and looped it, until the swath of silk covered Tony’s hips and groin, with an intricate knot just below his navel, leaving Tony to marvel at the simple beauty of it.
“That you’re married to Tony Stark?  It’s possible that came up a few times here recently,” the man—Barnes, Tony mentally corrected—replied.  “Got like fifty voicemails about it.  Don’t know how the hell they got my number.  They showed up at the club looking for you, Nat said. Had three of them come by posing as salesmen, like anyone would come to this shithole to sell stuff.  One claimed the landlord sent him to check the HVAC, as if Morrison has ever, in his life, sent freaking maintenance to fix something.  They tried to talk to Enrique, too, but he just kept telling them he didn’t speak English.  In English. It was great.”
“Most don’t,” Tony replied with a cant of his head.  “I like it.  Helping. Being a part of it.  The team, they need to focus.  This is something I can do for them.  Take it off their shoulders.”
“Yeah,” Tony said softly, reaching out to brush a hand across Steve’s brow.  That was familiar in a different way. Comforting. You did that before, Steve thought, though he couldn’t quite grasp the memory of when.  His head throbbed. “It’s okay. I’m here. Friday, what’s the ETA on Bruce?”
“You...you killed my father,” Steve said again, mouth flattening into a grimace.  He honestly wasn’t sure how to feel about that.  His feelings on his father and that night he disappeared were buried too deep to resurface now with any precision, but it wasn’t quite anger he felt, he realized, though he didn’t think he would wish his father’s fate on anyone.
“No one’s making you be here,” Ty said curtly.  Dan looked towards the door again.  No, hey, don’t go, Tony thought.
He blinked back the sudden stinging in his eyes and looked up at Steve with an expectant rush of, not excitement, exactly, but hope.  Maybe.  Maybe, hope.  Maybe he could hope.
.  He looked down at his watch, then over at Steve, siting ramrod straight next to him.  Not tonight.  Tonight, he would stay.  It would be alright.  Steve had promised, and that might not be familiar, but it was true.
He disobeyed.  Not just tonight, but all the nights, all the thoughts, all the plans.  Each time he looked at the map, he disobeyed, he lied, he defied.  He didn’t deserve Tony’s trust, not really, and he knew it. Leaving would hurt Tony so much.  Indescribably so, Steve knew that, and he would still do it, and for what?  He still wasn’t sure he knew.  Who knew what kind of fodder Steve’s escape might give those who would use it against Tony?
“No, no, I'm not saying—Fuck. Look, I'm saying he took the money. He said—he said, Rhodey!” Tony stammered, a belated feeling of panic creeping down his spine and out to his extremities, making him feel shaky and tense at the same time, like the two impulses were fighting for control and he couldn't figure out which one to let win. “He said,” Tony repeated, this time, the words scraping out in a rasp.
“Rhodey!” Tony shouted when he saw the figure sitting on the sectional.  “I know you’re upset you didn’t get to be best man, but try to put your feelings aside and just be happy for me.”
A week later, when he stopped by Clint and Bucky’s to grab the last of his few personal items, there was a Jacuzzi hooked up in the living room.
Steve felt a frown pull at her use of Tony’s endearment, and wondered, again, how much anything here was truly private. Happenstance or deliberate, he did not like to hear it from her, and he thought she knew that.   If Nat were here, these two would crush worlds under the heels of their words, so full of barbs and traps.
Later, he would blame terrible decision-making skills on that ebullient, overwhelming surge of feeling, but in the moment, he didn’t think at all, just grabbed onto the current of feeling running through him and let himself get carried away.
“Well, yes, I agree, the Realm has some steps to take to modernize the education system, but, you know, Pepper—Ms. Potts—runs the entire Castle, and sits on the Council, which is pretty exciting,” Tony added.
“It’s over.  Shmidt is dead.   Most of his forces with him,” Steve replied, dropping his gaze down to the leather-bound book in his lap.  Vestigus went on for volumes, dry tactics and strategy when the pages should have run red with blood. That was what war was, page after page of death until the stories all ran together and lost their meaning, the worst and best of men meeting not on some battlefield, but in every choice each one of them made.  He doubted Tony’s book said that.
“This way, Gentlemen,” Stewart said, sweeping an arm forward.  Steve wound his arm around Tony’s shoulders and pulled him along towards the elevators.
He couldn’t quite remember the entire menu, and hadn’t bothered paying attention to the names of the various types of cuvee that paired with each course, but he did his best.  It was something, at least.  Here’s your hotel towel, fancy soaps and a handwritten menu of what I ate. Thanks for not choking Bucky while I was gone, Steve thought with a small huff of a laugh as he stared down at the notebook and imagined Natasha’s reaction.
said you weren't any good, but I bet you're still great. Because I sure as hell believe my friends. I don't believe him. Not for a second."
"Mmm." Tony's brow furrows, and his face darkens a little. "Would you believe me if I told you that generally hasn't been how my life goes?"
The metal wrapped around Tony's chest is a thin, delicate sheet, covering him from the bottom of his ribcage to the top of his breastbone. The scarring starts at Tony's hips, where the armor's crimson-metal groin plates still sit. Coarse, ridged lines travel up to disappear under the chestplate; on the other side of them, the scarring continues in silvery knots up to his collarbone. Asymmetrically, on his other side, a jagged line cuts up and over his other shoulder, almost to his back.
Steve can't help but laugh. Iron Man -- Tony -- always makes him laugh. "And how do we tell who's winning?"
Steve was willing to admit that he hadn't been in his Quinjet seat with his safety harness securely fastened, but that was because they'd taken off about twenty seconds ago and Tony had gotten to the cockpit faster. Trying to clear out an AIM base with just the two of them, Steve could acknowledge in hindsight, had been a mistake, but at least there was no permanent harm done. Unfortunately, that included to the AIM base as well -- if Steve could have looked behind them, he thought he might have seen half a dozen beekeepers angrily shaking their fists.
He shouldn't want to know. He doesn't need to know. But that doesn't stop him from being curious, just a little. But he knows Iron Man won't tell him, and he's fine with that. He is. Iron Man's privacy is important.
Yinsen puts his hand on Tony's shoulder. The touch is a comfort until Tony starts thinking about how it might be the last time another human being will touch him there; the chestplate will cover everything. But this is what he has to do.
Tony felt his arm move; he wasn't the one lifting it. That was Steve, he realized. Steve was holding his hand. He could see Steve fumbling with his belt pouch with his other hand, tapping something out on his identicard.
Then from the bedroom, there was an awful lot of rustling, followed by the sound of soft footsteps. When Steve glanced over, he could see Tony in the darkness, a shadowy outline, leaning against the doorframe.
"Up!" Tony called out, even as he felt himself glow with the pride that he could do this to Steve. "Up, up, back on your knees. Come on! You're going to fall with one good hit?
It was the easiest thing in the world to roll them over. Tony relaxed against him, his body loose and pliant, and he clung to Steve, very pleasantly, as Steve tipped them both to the side and over. On his back now, Tony sank into the mattress, everything in him gone languid and easy. He tipped his head back and Steve felt a shudder run through Tony's body, as Tony arched up against him as if borne by a wave.
He hadn't talked to Tony after reading his mission report about the Sentient Armor. Tony hadn't seemed to want to talk about it, and Steve hadn't had any idea what to say. It was starting to look like he should have said something anyway. God, it was like the goddamn Carnelian ambassador all over again.
"You remember that night when neither of us could sleep and you decided to tell me how to play Dungeons & Dragons?" Steve asked.
It was all too easy to get caught up in it, and Steve was surprised when Jan looked at her watch, winced, and said, "I think Hank and I ought to be going. It's already past eleven."
, like a raincloud on the horizon. Maybe Iron Man just hasn't let him see this side of him before. "I'm staying. I mean that. Is there anything I can do?"
Oh, it's not like Steve didn't know it was something Tony liked. Sure, Tony's spent years grousing about physical therapy and Steve knows it's not like that always feels great, but he also knows Tony is the kind of fella who occasionally buys himself professional massages. Tony likes being touched, a lot; of course he likes that. That just makes it even weirder that Steve hasn't offered it sometime this year. It would have been okay.
Steve taps the side of his head, and then Tony figures out what he means and clicks over to the private channel. "Are
know what it is, though," Tony said. "Ty treated you like shit, and I didn't even notice. And you've never worried about that from me, but now you can't help but wonder. If I would." He sighed again, and Steve thought maybe he was right. "And I know you know I wouldn't, but there's knowing and there's
There was a stab of pain somewhere up and under Steve's ribs. A knife to the heart. His face was hot. God, Tony was
"I know a lot of things, Cap," Tony said, too worn out and tired to come up with anything wittier than that. "I'm a futurist. It's kind of in the job description."
"Thank you," Steve says. "Both of you." But his gaze settles on Tony as he says it. He's smiling, and it's ripping Tony apart. "I know it'll be different when I remember, but I'm glad I got to see the future with you."
Steve tries not to wonder whether Tony's ever set the autopilot and then passed out. If he's ever set the autopilot and then had a heart attack. Probably. He doesn't ask because he doesn't want to hear the answer. He knows Tony is barely functional as-is.
"Eighth floor," Steve confirmed, and Tony was so glad Steve couldn't see the face he was making. Yep, there went Christmas.
The offer of reprieve didn't seem to be what Steve wanted; Steve just shook his head. "No, I'm okay. I said I'd help, and I'll help."
Iron Man shrugs again and has another sip of coffee. "Oh, that? That was nothing. There's no trick to it or anything. You just kind of have to, well, remember what it was like to be a kid, and think of what you would have wanted an adult to tell you. Then you just... be that person. You pretend."
Tony flailed out a hand and brushed Steve's arm. Steve grabbed his hand back like he was hanging on for dear life.
"Hmm?" Steve asked, and that was when Tony pulled Steve's head into his lap and ran his fingers through his hair. "Mmm." God, that felt good. "This is nice," Steve murmured. "I like this."
It was a bad move, because Tony wouldn't be able to get his hand free as quickly in an emergency, and it was also a bad move because Steve was going to die right now of his aching, unfulfilled desire, and Tony didn't even know he was doing it. It was a fidgety little gesture; Tony often stood with his hand like that, one hand on his hip, thumb tucked into his belt loops or the edge of his belt or the waistband of his pants. Tony had always been tactile, ever since Steve had known him. Even in the early years, when he hadn't touched people because he'd been hiding the chestplate, he'd always been the sort of man whose fingers were always itching for something to touch, tapping his thighs or spinning a pencil or smoothing back his hair. Steve had had nearly a decade of thoughts about Tony's hands. And now it was all too easy to picture Tony's graceful hands sliding a little further forward, his long, dexterous fingers quick on Steve's belt buckle, and nope, nope, nope, Steve was definitely not going to think about that right now. Or ever. Tony certainly hadn't meant that.
, Shellhead. When Zemo was holding me captive, he dragged out my old Army footlocker from my room and ripped up everything, because he could. My old journals. Pictures of me and Bucky. Keepsakes. And--and-- the only picture I ever had of my mother." He was practically crying now. "You can't-- you can't bring that back. Not for all the money in the world."
, and Tony can feel the strange heat of him all through his body. Steve's eyes flash fire-bright, he clutches Tony to him, and he shuts his eyes and comes and comes. It's always a lot, with Steve. Tony absolutely doesn't mind.
"If Project Rebirth ever happens again," Steve said, deadpan, "I'll be sure to let you know." He chuckled. "Yeah, yeah, I guess I should also be heading--"
"What--?" Steve began, but that wasn't the question he wanted. "How--?" That was closer, but somehow he couldn't manage to get the words out.
"I'm offering. It's not a sacrifice to not do something that doesn't do much for me anyway, and even if it were a sacrifice, I'd still do it. I can do without, and you'd like to do without, and I'd like to help." Steve held out his hands, imploring; the worried set of Tony's brow hadn't vanished yet. "And I can see you over there fretting about how you'll feel when it's not three in the morning anymore, you know. And I can't promise I know the future. But I'm hoping you'll feel at least a bit better in the morning. And if you aren't feeling better, we'll reevaluate. Revise the plan. Maybe call someone who knows what it feels like and see if they can help you out. That sound fair?"
Steve was pushing his underwear all the way off, baring a pale thatch of hair and, slowly, the sizable shaft of his cock, and Tony momentarily forgot everything else he'd been talking about.
"All right," Steve said, dubiously, taking the shield from him. "Back in a second. Feel free to make yourself at home."
He sketched a few arrows, fliers moving ahead in a formation on a stylized map of a battlefield, and he sighed. He missed art. God knew he didn't have the free time for it anymore, as chair, but maybe it would be nice to get back to, someday. Tony had given him the tablet for his birthday last year and he'd probably thought Steve would have wanted to use it for actual art. Steve just hadn't gotten around to that, and this way it was a lot easier to send diagrams to the Avengers mailing list. Tony had looked happy that he was using the tablet for something, at least.
Hell, Tony thought, starting to smile to himself, maybe they'd even find some more of Steve's stuff. That would cheer him up for sure.
When Steve finally got the TV on, he found it had already been on SNN. He repressed a frown. Tony had probably been the last one watching TV, then.
It was going to be a few minutes to get up there, probably. Steve tipped his head back and took a breath, enjoying a brief reprieve as the elevator started to move. He'd never been here before, so he didn't know the layout, which put him at a disadvantage. And he was going to be at even more of a disadvantage if the guard had also called up and told Tiberius he was coming. He'd deal with that when he got there.
It was clear that Tony needed all the reassurance he could get. Not just about Tiberius. He'd gone his whole life with nowhere near enough love in it. Steve knew he couldn't just fix Tony all by himself. But he could love him with his whole damn heart.
"Just trust me," Tony said, and he unclipped the chains from Steve's ankles, letting the chain slide through the rings and free Steve's legs. "And roll over onto your back. Arms above your head."
How had Tiberius managed to ruin even this? All Steve wanted to do was make Tony happy, and Tony was terrified of it.
Steve was... smiling? He was trembling, eyes wide in astonishment, and tears were tracing their way down his face, soaking his cowl and sliding down, but he was definitely smiling.
"This is because of Tony," she said, softly, almost to herself, and then a little louder: "And last week, when you were so upset about that thing you couldn't tell me about... was that because of Tony, too?"
"We did," Tony acknowledged. At least they agreed that he wasn't dreaming. "But, you're just. You're so." He seemed to be at a loss for words. "Uh. May I?"
Eventually Tony did up the last of his buttons over the port in his sternum -- Steve understood now why Tony might have wanted to keep his chest covered up -- tied his tie credibly well considering that he didn't have a mirror to check it in, and looked up. He seemed a fair bit more comfortable now that he wasn't naked, although he still wasn't what Steve would have called
Steve could slide right inside him, like this. He knows Tony would let him, if he wanted to. Tony would open so easily for him, under his fingers, the way the entire rest of his body has. He'd give himself to Steve, his body hot and plush and welcoming, as if he'd been made for Steve, and he'd let Steve spend himself inside him. Steve knows exactly how it would go, because they've done this before. A lot. It's not something they always do the same way around, or even something they always do at all, but Steve does fuck him, sometimes. Tony likes Steve to fuck him early in the morning, when his limbs are still lax and heavy with sleep, when he doesn't have to worry about a thing, when he's not fretting about whether he's being good enough and it's easy for him to just
Maybe it was because of the drugs, but Tony found it was easy to believe him. Maybe things were going to be okay. That was a weird thought. He tried thinking it again. It still seemed true. Steve took promises more seriously than anyone Tony had ever known.
He knows he's shaking now; Iron Man has to be able to see it. He wonders if Iron Man's sensors can measure his heart rate, his breathing. He's never asked. There's a lot he doesn't know about Iron Man.
This wasn't fair. None of this was fair. He was supposed to be going on a date with Steve, not bleeding to death in the middle of Macy's on 34th Street because he'd been magically shanked by a sorcerer who didn't even have the decency to obey the goddamn laws of physics.
Steve looks down at the mess of petals in the sink and back up at Tony. Tony watches his throat work, watches him realize that he knows just how far along Tony is in the progression of the disease, watches him try to figure out how diplomatic he should be, if he should tell him--
joke about it, sometimes," he said, and Tony remembered the excuse he'd made when he'd taken the box. That had probably been torture for Steve, and not in the good way. "So you say these things but I don't know how serious you are about doing them. And if you couldn't do them, if you didn't really want to do them at all and were just being nice for me... it'd be a dealbreaker. I'm not the same as everyone else. I-- I
She smiled. "Then let's get right to it. And I'd like to start with something more recent, if I may." She leaned forward. "The most current public discussion surrounding Iron Man obviously concerns his role in the hostage situation last night that ended with the tragic deaths of four SNN employees. You're undoubtedly familiar with the situation, Captain."
"You're going to be the death of me," Iron Man says. The words are gentle, now, and Steve can tell he's smiling too, a broad grin in the shadows. "Close your eyes?"
Iron Man's voice is almost too quiet to hear, nearly lost in the mechanical crackle. "If I said I didn't want to, would that be okay with you?"
Steve didn't know until tonight that Tony uses his armor to keep him upright, but he's not surprised, now that he considers it from this angle. It sounds like a thing Tony would do. He always wants to look fine from the outside.
"Do you know how the Spymaster died?" Oh, Ghost is gloating now. "Just like this, Captain. Ask your buddy Iron Man. He can tell you all about it. The tech I loaned the Spymaster stopped working as he was in the middle of a wall. Tragic." He clicks his tongue. "As long as this device on my wrist is active, as long as I'm touching you, you'll stay out of phase with reality. But as soon as I let you go, or press this button, there'll be a solid glass window through your chest, Captain." He laughs. "You know that magic trick where they saw the lady in half? That'll be you. And I know you're a super-soldier, but even you can't survive that one." He extends a hand. "Save yourself. Hand over the drive."
Steve stared at the mess of straps surrounding him -- the five-point restraint harness was a mess at the best of times -- and then stared at his arm in a sling and sighed. "I don't suppose I could put my head in your lap again?" he asked, hopefully.
Steve spends his morning run lost in a haze of daydreaming, counting down the minutes until he can finally see Iron Man, planning every word of his speech. His feet carry him back to the mansion, through the gate, through the door, past the foyer, into the kitchen, where Iron Man-- where Iron Man--
He squeezes Tony's shoulder again, and slowly, slowly, so slowly that Tony has plenty of time to stop him if he wants to -- he starts to move his hand up Tony's shoulder, to the side of his neck. His thumb brushes Tony's jaw.
Under him, Tony shivers once, convulsively, and goes very still. He's holding his breath, Steve realizes. Steve's probably squashing him after all. Steve's usually scrupulously careful about not crushing Tony. Or anyone, really. He's so much stronger than most people that he has to care a whole lot about how he touches them. He's pretty sure he's never just... lain down on someone. Not since the serum, anyway.
Tony's head jerks in a nod. "Oh," he says, a breath in a haze of static. He sounds surprised. "Okay."
"So if I could just have that box back," Steve continued, marshaling up an unbelievable amount of courage and once again looking Tony in the eye, "I'll be on my way."
, Tony. This is what I meant. I'll back you all the way. You're an Avenger. It doesn't matter what lies they print. They're wrong. I trust you. And I want you on the team. There's no one else I'd rather have at my side. It's as simple as that. Okay?"
Mr. Stark sighs. His face is slack with exhaustion and an emotion that Steve almost wants to call regret; his eyes are dull, his gaze far away. "He told you."
. When Steve had caught him with Tiberius, he'd said Steve wasn't his boyfriend, which had been factually true -- and even if he'd wanted Steve to be his boyfriend, he wouldn't have said so to a man he was dating, a man he thought loved him. And he certainly wouldn't have said so anywhere in Steve's hearing, ever, if he'd thought Steve was straight. And just now, Tony had said he wasn't going to try anything. But Steve knew very, very well that
Tony threw himself into Steve's arms like he had something to prove, and specifically that the thing he had to prove was how much he wanted Steve. His lips met Steve's, again and again.
It's a bit of a contradiction, given what Steve is actually here to do, but whoever said that humans made sense?
"No," Iron Man says, and that damned sadness is creeping back into his voice again. "You wouldn't. You're a good man."
The kiss is brief but heartfelt, and when Steve lifts his head, Tony is staring at him in unmixed awe.
"Shellhead," Steve gasps. He feels like he's the one who can't breathe. "Shellhead, please, say something!"
With his whole heart, Steve believes him. But that's not a conversation to have with Ghost in the room. He'll have to demonstrate his feelings some other way.
Tiberius stepped to one side as the curtain behind him began to lift, and he held out a hand to the tableau within. The set looked like an ordinary living room in this century: a couple of couches, a cabinet, potted plants, a recliner, a big-screen TV. Next to the recliner was a desk with a computer on it. There seemed to be more wires coming from the computer than were strictly necessary, Steve thought. Not that this was his area of expertise.
"I did that to myself once too, you know," Tony said, sympathetically. Not tenderly. Steve had to be hearing things. "A long time ago. Just after you'd joined the team, I think. I barely knew how to fight, back then. Only broke one, unlike you, and it still took a whole month to heal. Then Happy taught me how to throw a punch the right way, and I never made that mistake again." He looked up again, and Steve could practically see the gears in Tony's brain turning... and then jamming. "You, though," Tony said, deep in thought. "What the hell did
Tony undid the button of Steve's pants, unzipped the zipper, and then -- finally -- slid his hand inside. His fingers were over Steve's underwear, another boundary he hadn't crossed, but that wasn't much of a boundary, because Steve could feel every touch of Tony's deft hand. Tony was smiling down at him, delighted, as he mapped the shape of Steve's cock, stroking him gently through the already-damp fabric. Tony had paused on an indrawn breath; his other hand, still on Steve's thigh, was trembling. When Steve glanced over -- it was all right to look, it had to be all right to look -- he saw that Tony was hard too, the thin sleep pants stretched across his lap outlining the considerable state of his arousal. Tony shifted his weight, clearly trying to stave off some of his own urgency. And knowing that, knowing that Tony was
"I know," Steve said, quickly. "I'm not upset. I know what you meant. It's a good question." He thought about it, turned it over in his mind like yet another tactical problem, and then, finally, saw the shape of the answer. "You're going to say that this is terribly unsentimental, but you know how these days, in politics, they say
Well, at least he's definitely still breathing now. In Steve's ears, Tony is almost gasping, ragged and hoarse.
Tony raised his eyebrows as Steve carried him toward the closest set of stairs. "And then it's time for the striptease, right?"
There's a little catch in the static Iron Man makes now, like a sharply-indrawn breath. "You like that?" Iron Man says, in a voice Steve has never heard from him before, something laden with a nebulous sort of promise. What he could be promising, Steve has no idea -- but, boy, does he want to find out. Iron Man makes a little clicking noise, sounding almost shy. "The, uh. The environmental systems dump a lot of waste heat through the outer layer of the suit. I-- I mean, Mr. Stark originally had a design that was more vented, but it added too much bulk."
Tony was silent for several long seconds. He wasn't asleep; his eyes were still open. Then he focused on Steve, and once again there was sadness in his gaze. "You know what the worst part of this whole thing is?" He laughed. "I mean, it really shouldn't be the worst part, but you know what keeps getting stuck in my head?"
Tony smiled, and it was his real smile, not the one he'd been giving to the cameras and the strangers all night. "It was nice to at least look around and see you, though, I'll say that," he murmured. "I missed you. You were right here and I missed you so much all night."
Tiberius gestured at the raised stage at the other end of the room. The curtains had been closed since Steve and Tony had arrived, and Steve had assumed it was a feature of the room that wasn't going to be in use tonight. But now that he was taking a closer look, he could see that the main curtain rippled and bumped; there were people moving around back there.
, Iron Man had confided, and no amount of money can fix that. Steve doesn't know what he can do about that except be here, and give Tony what he wants. And that's what he'll do.
And then he jumps and jerks his hands away as the comm crackles. "Cap," Hank asks. "Everything okay?"
"It's over," Steve told him. "It's all over now. I know it was bad. I know you must feel awful. But you have nothing to be ashamed of. You didn't do anything wrong. I know he hurt you. But he's never going to be able to hurt you again. And you'll never have to see him again."
"I take it that's a yes," Tony said, with an amused smile. He was confident, again. He knew what he was doing. He knew how to make Steve feel good. This was the part, Steve was sure, where Tony would brag a little, would tell him how good he was at this, how good he was going to make Steve feel. "I've been told I'm--" Tony began to say, and then there was something cold and broken in his eyes. The smile was gone. "Well, I've been told I'm adequate at best, actually."
Steve wanted to ask Tony if he'd also like to remove some clothing -- he very urgently wanted to see a whole lot more of Tony -- but, of course, Tony had already gone over all the reasons he didn't want other people to look at him these days. Steve absolutely still wanted to look at Tony -- the scars didn't matter to him, not in the slightest -- but the idea obviously bothered Tony, and Steve wasn't about to be the jerk who ignored that.
It's more than a little undignified when he tries to get the cup on, but the upshot is that he's not hard by the end of it. He buttons his pants, buckles his belt, pulls an undershirt on, lets the mail shirt settle on his shoulders. It's when he's sitting down to struggle with his boots that he realizes the clanking from Tony's side of the bed has stopped entirely.
Whatever the hell that means. Steve's never bothered to get out a dictionary for it. Tony used it once, the second or third time Steve tried tying him up, when they hadn't quite figured out yet that he needed to not put certain kinds of pressure on very particular spots on Tony's chest. While they do have regular safewords, it's not always apparent what the exact nature of the problem is if one gets called. That one is unambiguous and urgent: out now, off now, away now.
And then the woman at the agency.  She’d seemed so professional in her tailored suit and sharp heels, going over paperwork and giving him her business card, embossed with nothing more than a black spider with a red dot and a phone number beneath it.  Just another day at the office.
“Uh-huh,” Tony nodded sagely.  “You know, it’s a good thing the public doesn’t get to see the devious, food-stealing side of you, Rogers.  Your image would be crushed.”
He was going to die. Steve was going to kill him.  Cause of death:  Steven Grant Rogers’ depraved tongue.  Here lies Tony Stark, he came and went.
“We spar by rules of training.  Head and groin are off limits.  Open hand only, no punches or grabbing by the clothes.  The fight is won when one yields or is pinned for three beats,” Tony said.  He studied Steve for a moment, tilting his head to one side.  “Let’s see what you can do,” Tony urged, eyes sparkling with excitement.  “Ready?” Steve nodded and brought his hands up, sinking into a crouch.  “Then let’s begin.  Go—ah—
Actually, a puff of dust to the face would have been far better than the brick wall that slammed into him, knocking his breath out of his lungs, when he looked down and saw his own face smiling back at him. It was a picture from his birthday, him in one of those shiny, cone-shaped hats with the elastic band around his chin, curly hair sticking out at all angles, a party horn cocked jauntily between his lips as he grinned at the camera. Underneath that photo were others, some of just him, some of him and Steve, some with the whole gang. Most he recognized. They’d once graced the wall above Steve’s mattress, a mishmashed collage of their lives that was better to look at than any artwork he’d ever seen.
Tony wanted to be away.  From him, Steve mentally corrected himself. Tony wanted to be away from him.
“Okay, so it’s not that long of a story,” Steve sighed.  Bucky’s eyes went wide, and he opened his mouth, then snapped it closed again.
“Does it seem like I’m not having a fabulous time getting to make you lose your God-damned mind?” Tony demanded.
“You are not going to stand there and pretend you didn’t know.  Come on, Stark, not even you are that blind.  ‘Look, Tony noticed I was in the room, I have to go sit in his lab now and listen to him blather on because maybe he’ll pay attention to me then.’  ‘Tony did something dangerous, nevermind that we all pretty much do that on days ending in Y, let me freak out about it.  Just walk off the bleeding, Clint, you’re fine, Tony got a hangnail though, so I’m gonna have to check on that.’  ‘Sure, I worked with SHIELD tech just fine for months and knew how to take out a Quin-Jet with a giant Frisbee, but this gosh-darn phone just has me stumped, Tony, can you help a fella out?’” Clint jibed in what was obviously meant as a mock-Steve voice.  “Jesus, Stark, you don’t want something with the guy, fine.  You’re an idiot, but your call.  But back the fuck off, man.”
Everyone. Everyone had the chance to be loved, completely and inexorably, without pretense or fear. To be free.
No, Steve thought. That much he was sure of, though he didn’t know why or what to think of the rest of the boy’s dramatics.  Youth, Steve supposed, could be forgiven for seeing what they wanted to see.
Jarvis had come, of course, as soon as he received Steve’s message.  A scandal avoided.  Tony sobered up and spent the next three days ignoring Steve in favor of a trebuchet, spent a dinner with the team making enough jests about the incident to send Steve away from the table in a rush of anger and then never spoke of it again.
His whole body had gone taut.  He was pushing his teeth together, making his jaw ache.  But, that was somehow keeping him rooted to his seat instead of running off down the hall for his room.  Flight or faster flight, he thought, somewhat hysterically.  His throat was dry and sticky.   Should’ve stuck to Tesla.  Or the ‘bots.  Always had to push, didn’t he?  Couldn’t leave well enough alone.  He forced himself to swallow, and almost choked on the saliva when his throat wouldn’t cooperate fully.
“He’s still frowning a lot and hasn’t moved anything,” Cam called out.  Steve rolled his eyes.  “He rolled his eyes!”  Cam pulled a smug look at him and wagged his head back and forth, rolling his eyes in mimicry.
“Probably the same way Rhodey found out about it.  They have sources, too, I don’t know,” Tony replied. “Someone will always talk.  Hey,” Tony stopped abruptly, turning around to face Steve in the narrow, white-walled hallway.  “Have I mentioned lately that you’re amazing? Because you’re amazing. I know you hated all that back there.  I know that was hard on you, but damn, Steve. You did good. Real good. What you said…what you said about me and---and always being this guy, did you mean it?  “Cause I gotta tell you, that’s not really a take many people are going to share.”
“Yeah,” Tony said, massaging a hand into the sides of his forehead where the sudden spike of anger-fueled pressure was throbbing against his temples.  “Just handle it, okay? I’ll figure out something else later, but for now. I don’t want him getting up another morning thinking I don’t know what he did.”
“Yeah, well, it’s going to come to a head, Tony.  You know that. The slave states aren’t going to keep looking the other way forever,” Bruce said, his eyes narrowing on Steve.  “It was one thing when it was a handful of zealots, but they put an army together and drove back Schmidt and his forces, which is no small feat, even after they were driven out of the Erlands. The world isn’t going to just ignore that,” he added, turning back to Tony.  “I know you see what’s coming, Tony, I know you do. It’s a tinderbox, just waiting for a spark, and then…”
His mother’s tales of falling down a fairy hole popped into his mind. The fairies, she would say, knew a human’s deepest desire, and that was what was presented in offering, but it was always a trick, she had warned.  A deception, so that you could never leave, and if you chose to partake of their gifts and hospitality, you would be bound to them forever.  Steve felt a chill run down his spine as he pushed open the door to his quarters and headed for the balcony, where the afternoon sun spilled into the room through the open curtains that billowed gently in the breeze.
Absently, Steve stroked one hand over his nipple, sucking in a breath at the sudden sensation. With the other hand he reached up and gave the other peak a light twist.  His cock twitched, angling upward, a line of fluid trailing from the tip. Steve hissed out a breath.
concussed, so cut me some slack.  But, yeah.  You and me.  We could do this. And, if you haven’t noticed, you’re kind of my everything, too.  If this is something you feel you have to do, I want to be a part of it. Whatever that means.”
Honestly, having an Alpha was turning out to be a lot like having a butler.  Sure, a butler who could beat you or fuck you on a whim, but at least there were snacks.  No one told him about the snacks, he thought with a strange, giddy sort of breathy high running through him.
“I’d appreciate your expertise,” Steve said.  She smiled.  Liked hearing that.  Wanted the validation, wanted to help, probably thought they were the same thing.
“They affect me a bit differently, but I still felt them. That’s um…actually how the glass got cracked,” Steve admitted sheepishly. That was a little hot.  More than a little.  Tony wondered if Steve would crack the windows at the house on the island.  That would be neat.  “They just wear off a lot faster for me with the serum,” Steve continued.
“You can’t just ignore this, Tony!” Rhodes said in a loud, frustrated voice. “He’s not some foot soldier, for God’s sake!”
“You have Room Six,” the man said, turning his head slightly to the right where the hallway extended further. Steve automatically followed his gaze. A series of numbered doors extended down the hallway. In the distance, he could see a black six on one of them. “Let’s see… no hard nos on the list,” he added thinly, clucking his tongue a bit as he scrolled through whatever was on his screen. Steve wondered if the man recognized him, and adjusted the baseball cap on his head, not that the man seemed even remotely fazed if he did recognize Captain America coming to use a glory hole.
He had first noticed the slight wobble last night, during his live broadcast to planet earth (streamed by over half a billion people, not bad, if he did say so himself, but--yeah, not the point right now).  He had checked his systems, of course. Had JARVIS run through everything. But, diagnostics failed to report any kind of problem, and he had put it down to just another one of those things they don’t tell you in the brochure.  Everything behaves differently in space. That was the thing. Machines behave differently. People behave differently. Life behaves differently. Maybe he had wanted that, a bit. A different life, just for a while. Point being, the shimmy hadn’t worried him, not then, anyway, and not when he felt it again an hour or so ago.
“Because they wanted you to learn about how to behave, how to have good manners and act appropriately.  A lesson which you seem to have missed,” Howard pointed out.
Sometimes, when Steve was asking the bots about their day or drawing silly doodles to leave in various places around the apartment or cabin for Tony to find or laughing uproariously at Bugs Bunny cartoons or the Three Stooges, like they were the height of comedy, it was easy to forget that Steve was who he was.  That when he wanted to, Steve could move.  Fast.  One second, he was standing in the doorway looking like someone hit him with a wall and the next, while the breath was still cool in Tony’s chest, he was there, standing in front of Tony by the bed.
Another breath.  The shadows were still.  His dog tags were next to where his fist curled into the comforter.  He reached out his fingers and pulled them into his hand, feeling their familiar coolness against his skin, the pattern of letters and numbers that said Steve was his and he was Steve’s.  Another breath.  In and out.
Steve was panting, shallow little breaths, his heartbeat skittering in Tony’s ear as he lay his head over Steve’s chest, still cradling Steve’s cock with one hand. “You did good, so good for me, Steve,” Tony told him as he looked down, running the fingertips of his other hand lightly up and down Steve’s side in soothing trails. “You’re beautiful.”
“Happily, my King,” Cam nodded, bowed again, and left them, though not before Steve caught the pleased look that crossed his face at the King’s concern.
…when this whole place had been a prison, he had wanted to be able to see that bit of light through the keyhole.
“Yeah, that’s...” Steve began, sucking in a sharp breath. He glanced back down the hall towards Room Six, flattening his mouth for a moment, then relaxing. Trust like that, you couldn’t find it many places. But, he had it. He had it, and that meant...well, it meant he had to have a conversation he didn’t want to have, but if he trusted Tony, and he did, then he owed him that much.
“Uncle Bruce thought that knowledge wasn’t relevant to team activities.  He mocked me,” Tony told Steve, who was watching everything he did as it related to the container of lasagna as if Tony was opening the arc of the Covenant.  Tony reached into a cupboard and opened a plastic package, then handed Steve a thin, crispy breadstick to chew on while he got the meal ready. “Cast aspersions on my character.”  Steve made a series of sounds that Tony took for shocked indignation.
Tony had done that for him.   Yes, to assuage Tony’s own anger, certainly, but there was no denying that the nature of his choice of punishment for Hammer was for Steve’s benefit.  All Tony would say when Steve tried to question him was that it was fitting, and then asked Steve, in a tired, ragged voice, to leave it alone.  Steve obliged him at the time, but he knew he could not hold his tongue forever, though he wasn’t even sure what he wanted to say. Thank you, he supposed, though that sounded so small.  Steve was often left with small words for Tony’s grand gestures, though it hadn’t escaped his notice that his words seemed to satisfy Tony in some way that made Steve remember his mother making ornaments from painted eggshells she had carefully hollowed out with a needle, where too much pressure or a wrong move crumbled the whole thing to pieces.
Distraction, he supposed.  If he couldn’t have everything he needed just now, he could have something he very much wanted.  Tony scrolled through his messages, deleting most of them that were not from Pepper, then did a quick internet search for their oh-so-cooperative judge, who obviously needed to be punished.
Neither of them seemed to be in any hurry to leave, both just sort of lingering and puttering around the suite, touching each other, kissing, once, just randomly dancing in a swirl around the bedroom, laughing like teenagers.  Steve kept finding reasons to touch him, Tony noticed, like he couldn’t quite help himself, and Tony found himself doing the same once he seemed to have Steve’s tacit permission. Since Afghanistan, most of the people Tony let touch him had been doing it for one medical reason or another, and for Steve, Tony could imagine where the wariness came from whenever someone wanted to touch him, so for both of them, this newfound freedom with each other seemed to have opened up a deep well of aching need to touch and be touched, and they both grappled for every opportunity.
“Back’s not pretty either.  Upper legs and my right knee have damage,” Steve continued, as if Tony hadn’t spoken.  He honestly wasn’t even sure if he had.  Felt a bit like he’d slipped into a nightmare, and any minute now, the jump-scare would wake him up.  Steve put his fork down on his plate and looked down at the table, then off to the side, where the line of vases glinted on the bookcase.  “Do you really know about what you’re getting into here?  Really, Tony?  It’s…there are times.  It’s hard.  Not just for me. For the people around me.”
Steve considered it. Tony and Rhodes were both right, really, but the nature of battle was changing. He had seen that with his own eyes. He stared at the cannon and thought for a moment, seeing the battle spread out in his mind as if a painting came to life.
“Maybe.  They want that cold-launch ICBM, that’s for sure,” Obie added.  “Lockheed’s salivating, but I think we’ve got an in with the committee.”
The man’s voice was nice, Steve decided.  It was oddly soothing, like when Steve’s mother tucked a blanket warmed by the fire over him when he was having one of his spells.  That didn’t make the man nice.  Steve wasn’t stupid, and he knew better than most how quickly a nice voice could turn cruel, but he liked the man’s way of talking, anyway, if only because it was so different, and not much different ever happened to him, even when he so desperately wanted it to.
“Please tell me that you’re Steve,” the man said, tilting his head to the side and shooting what was far better more well-practiced smirk at Steve.
“I want to see you,” Steve repeated more firmly, setting his jaw, and Tony knew that part of the discussion was over.
“That place is terrible for him. Terrible,” Ana said.  “They are awful to him because he is smarter, and he just wants to help and have friends, but those boys, boys like
“You’d be surprised how much goes missing over there.  Bagram lost a couple of those MRAP counter-measure sets we sent over because the cage was too full and no one wanted to go to the trouble to set up another cage.  Apparently, they just up and walked off on their own.  Stuff happens,” Tony said with a shrug.  “Not that I like it happening to my stuff.  But, that kind of environment, things are going to fall through the cracks.  Just doesn’t get reported, until it’s on us.”
“Yes,” Tony replied, raising his eyes to Steve’s, waiting.  He bit his lip and dropped his gaze, then felt Steve’s hand wrap around his own, solid and warm and centering somehow.  Tony drew in a shuddering breath, then let it out, keeping his eyes on Steve.  “I’m ready.  If you are.”
“Hey, fuck you, asshole,” Calhoun shot back.  “He probably fucks the same way he does everything else around here, all dead-eyed and grunting out orders when he bothers to say anything at all.  I’m just saying, what do you want to bet it’s like the fucking Deepwater Horizon back there, just gushing every time, you know, even though he knows he’s gonna get fucked ‘til he’s raw as the God-damned desert.  I mean, look at him, you can just
Steve cradled Tony’s head in the crook of his arm. His other hand splayed over Tony’s chest, fingers idly running along the seam of skin that circled the disc.  The waning afternoon light that filtered through the trees above, dappling Tony’s skin with spots of brightness.  He stroked his hand across Tony’s chest, watching as the light wavered minutely as he moved through it, like it didn’t want to be caught.
“That was a fluke,” Tony declared after Steve won the first hole by two shots, though he gave Steve a disgruntled look that verged on a pout, which Steve definitely did not find adorable at all.
“To be fair, Steve would tell you me being a dick isn’t really that much of a stretch,” Barnes admitted, mouth twisting into the ghost of a smile.  “He did used to paint.  Was really good at it, too. Always made him happy, you know? I don’t know.  Hell, I saw them by the dumpster, and…he shouldn’t be here.  Not him,” Barnes husked out in a soft, brittle voice.  “He’s not…this isn’t supposed to be his life, you know? Not Steve. But, he’s too damned stubborn and good to just peace the fuck out like a normal person,” Barnes said, tossing his hand in the air with a snort of frustration.  “No, he’s going to stay until, I don’t know, forever—where I’m whatever definition of fixed enough is in his head—and meanwhile, his life,” Barnes stopped, swallowed and drew in a shaky breath.  “This isn’t supposed to be his life.”
“You would truly do that?” Steve asked, the words seemingly punched out of him as something heavy settled into his chest. “Forego marriage?”
“Fine,” Tony said, canting his head a bit and giving Steve a wide-eyed look and reaching for the plate after the other man left them. “You see how he bullies me,” Tony said to Rhodes, who rolled his eyes as Tony took a bite of cured meat.
“I’ve got you, Tony.  It’s okay now, baby.  No one is going to take you from me again,” Steve was whispering hoarsely into Tony’s skin, ghosts of words branding themselves into his flesh like invisible scars.  It hurt, to hear Steve like this.  Maybe I didn’t leave my heart in the cave after all, Tony thought, slurry with sleep and medicine and safety, scattered thoughts that kept gathering to pool in his chest before skittering away again.  He couldn’t quite grab them, not and hold on, so he held on to Steve instead, and let those thoughts go.
Doctors talked to him about CT scans and charts and cognitive and occupational therapies and clinical trials.  He nodded his head and took the paperwork they gave him, shaking everyone’s hand and promising them he wouldn’t get discouraged if there wasn’t any immediate progress, and by the end of it, he wanted nothing more than to run out of the building and keep running until this was far enough behind him that he didn’t have to think about it anymore.
“That’s true.  Implying to Steve that he probably couldn’t handle this given his delicate condition was definitely the way to get him not to do it,” Natasha observed evenly.  “Shocking that your strategy didn’t work.”
“That’s placating. You’re placating me,” Tony grumbled, mouth twisting into a grimace as he walked over to the circular platform he’d built for the armor where it could be stored and cleaned. “So--aside from your Evel Knievel impersonation--overall, I’d call that one a success. I mean, helping overthrow Kree enslavement one backwater outpost at a time wasn’t on my to-do list, but I can’t say I’m against it.”
“So.  How do you want to do this?” Kirk asked, glancing around the studio apartment where a kitchenette with a toaster oven on the single counter stood over a small refrigerator.  A futon was shoved against one wall next to a chest of drawers draped with neat piles of clothes.  The rest of the tiny apartment held Steve’s easel, with a small table filled with paints and brushes next to it, and, currently, at least, his weight bench, sans weights, on top of a paint-splattered white sheet he used to keep Mr. Hall, the landlord, from freaking out over the possible damage to the floors that Steve’s fifty-dollar security deposit seemed somewhat unlikely to cover.
than enough,” Steve said with a sudden urgency gripping him. “I love you. I always will. You’re all I want, too.”
“Charming,” Tony observed dully.  He was really supposed to live here?  “Should I be expecting a little, blonde girl to come around and eat my porridge?”
“Oh, God, please, please, Steve, please, I need, please, I need…for you, please, for you,” Tony babbled, the nonsense words spilling out of him, half muffled by him grinding his face into the bed.
Everything was a haze of pleasure.  Tony tried to open his eyes, but his vision was blurred, softening at the edges.  Tony couldn’t think.  There were things to think about, important things, but none of that seemed to matter to his body.  Electricity was coursing through his body, up and down, sparking to the ends of his nerves and back again, settling low in his belly with a blazing pressure.  He could feel his body loosening, relaxing. Preparing.  A warm rush of slick coated him.  His cock answered with a jolt, a buzzing, insistent pulse of almost-pain that sent tendrils of heat coiling from his groin to the base of his neck. He didn’t care.  Or, he did, but it didn’t matter.  Nothing mattered in the world except the way Steve’s mouth felt on his, the way Steve’s hands held him, the way Steve’s body was moving against his.
Bucky paused, holding the egg atop the spatula over his plate.  “You hear what you’re saying, right?  I mean, you hear the words coming out of your mouth.  And you’re telling me I’m not supposed to--”
“This is never going to work if we keep using each other to punish ourselves,” Steve choked out against the skin of Tony’s neck, half a plea, half a promise.  Tony moved his hands from Steve’s waist up to cup both sides of Steve’s jaw, angling Steve’s head so they were facing each other.
“Let me go out on a limb here,” Tony said wearily.  “And guess that a bad conduct discharge affects your benefits.”
“You--you--excuse me, what?  What the fuck did you just say?” Brock spluttered, staring aghast at Steve.  “You did
“That’s not what Zola meant, Tony.  I know you believe that to be true.  I know you’ve heard that your whole life, but I also know that you don’t actually have any idea what goes on under Zola’s thumb, because if you did, you’d put a stop to it.  I know you would.  So—so I have to believe that you don’t know,” Steve ground out.  “Zola wasn’t talking about sending Cam to clean someone else’s chamber pots or scuttle out the mice from the cellars.  He was talking about hurting him.  And me.  If I did something, misbehaved, rebelled, I don’t know, but he didn’t mean pleasure or status or the kind of pain you—what you mean.  He meant punishment.  Torture.”
“It sucks. I know it sucks. You don't have to pretend,” Tony bit out with a spark of annoyance that quickly faded to a self-loathing filled sense of resignation. He'd done this to himself, which was perhaps the worst part of the whole thing. No one to blame, just his own giant vat of stupidity. “Just...can we just, you know. Whatever you're going to do. I'd rather just get it over with,” he finished with a sigh, bracing his hands on the back of the dining chair and looking down at the truly, spectacularly appalling omelet.
“No,” Tony said immediately.  “A little.  Maybe. Yes,” he amended with a sharp intake of breath.  Fuck. Why couldn’t he shut the hell up?  “Look, I know that isn’t fair or reasonable or—I shouldn’t feel that way, I get it, I do.  But I thought you were---you know,” Tony rushed out, waving a hand in the air in front of him.  “Which I told you.  Is fine.  If that’s what you, you know.  Want. Whatever.  Up to you.  But, you didn’t, so.  That’s…it just…it was kind of.  The car,” Tony said, gulping down a swallow of air that turned out to be too much and made his voice thin, like it was stretched out like candy floss.  “The car was right there.  All the time. And I—forget it.  I don’t what I’m.  You were on a mission, it went long.  Forget I said anything.”
That was all his mind could process.  It was strange, the lack of a constant barrage of input and output.  Disconcerting.  But, if he tried to look past that next step, that one thing, there was a dark expanse of nothingness, and each current of thought threatened to spill over the edge of whatever was holding him together in that space.  Panic, waiting to happen, not in a rush, but in a thousand drops of too much thinking.  So, he just closed that part of his mind off, hung a Steve Will Be Fine sign on the door and headed for the elevators.
“Well, I expect there to be actual pizza here when I get back!” Tony said, standing and heading for the door.  “Hey, you should take a look at this stuff, too.  I mean, obviously, you’re on a lot of it.  But there’s like, art stuff, and all,” Tony finished.
“It’s okay.  It’s okay.  I’m here,” Tony murmured, finally settling his other hand on Steve’s shoulder.  He lifted his eyes to look at the doctors and nurses, swallowed, and gripped Steve’s hand where it hung halfway off the table.  “I’m right here,” Tony said, sucking in a breath and tightening his grip on Steve’s shoulder.
This place was like nothing he had ever seen before, Steve realized as his panic slowly abated and he managed to look around with something other than shock.  Perhaps even like no place anyone alive had ever seen before, for it was surely an old place, long abandoned if ever used.  Nothing moved here, save the air. No animals chittered about.  No birds rode the winds or called from their rookeries high above.  No one hailed him. He could be the only living thing in the world, for all that this place offered to the contrary, he thought, swallowing hard at the stray thought.
It was worse.  Way, way worse. Tony stared in paralyzed horror for a moment.  He must’ve scrolled right past Rhodey’s name and into the S’s by mistake, though at least it was Steve’s work number,
“You should sleep,” Tony urged.  They were going to have a tiring day tomorrow, because it had been very good.  Steve had said so, and Steve didn’t lie.
Steve read it again.  Then again.  Five stars, he thought and turned around again to look at where the painting rested.  I like how you painted me, Steve remembered Tony saying.  Not just, I like the painting.  I like how you painted me.
“No,” Tony admitted with a slight wince.  In retrospect, he probably should have brought one with him, but showing up here with a stranger in tow to watch the drama and literally give it an official stamp was top of the list of things that just were not happening.  “You can come down to the Tower.  Or, my lawyer’s office.  Card’s in the file.  Bank.  Whatever.  Here,” he said, sliding the manila folder out from where it was tucked under his arm.  Steve grabbed it out of his hand before he could offer it, then turned and walked back to the kitchen, dropping the folder on the counter next to a can of corn.  “Everything’s in there.  You just sign.  Sign and we’re done,” Tony finished flatly, repeating Steve’s words back to him.
“Uh,” Tony said, reaching inside his shirt and tugging the dog tags over his head to hand to the guard, who took them almost out of surprise as much as anything else.  “I’m this—this is me.  I’m—“ he stopped, took a deep breath.  “I’m Captain Rogers’ Omega.  He, ah…needed me to come in. Here. To SHIELD. Immediately.  For the…he’s been gone.  On a mission and all.  But, he’s back, and I’m—supposed to be here.  He said.  You know how Alphas get. With the…seeing their Omegas…stuff.”
When Tony arrived, the team, minus Thor and including Rhodey and Wilson, was seated around the dining table, stacks of colored poker chips in front of each of them and a pile of in the center of the table.
.  The SHIELD agents hadn’t quite known what to do when Steve just sat down and put his head in his hands, but somehow, he had ended up in a room with ten-inch thick steel walls, a chair, a table, a water in a Styrofoam cup and Peggy.  Peggy, who had been practically vibrating with anger, demanding to know who he was, how he had gotten into one of the most secure buildings on the planet, and what kind of sick, twisted joke he thought this was. She hadn’t expected him to start laughing at that, but he had, laughing until he couldn’t stop, until he wasn’t sure if he was laughing or crying.  1992. SHIELD had the Tesseract. Right here. Somewhere in the bowels of this building, but Steve had no way to get it home, not when Howard’s machine relied on it to work. They’d given him a sedative then. Needle to the neck. Steve hadn’t bothered stopping them. It hadn’t worked, of course. That clued them in, at least. They ran tests, but there was no comparison to run his DNA against.
“Captain?” Agent Coulson questioned with a quick glance at Tony, his gaze dropping to the dog tags slung around Tony’s neck.  “Ah.  Congratulations are in order, I see.”
“The same offer you would make to those who would seat themselves in my place is hardly a balanced scale when I offer my only son, Stark,” the Ul retorted, his voice low and steady, but Steve could hear the bitterness creeping in at the edges.
“I didn’t say anything that wasn’t true,” Steve replied with a shrug.  “I’m sorry I went off script.”
“Just, you know, like maybe Amazon.  And Consumer Reports.  And Parenting.  Though, really, can you trust them or are they in the pockets of their advertisers?”  Tony wondered out loud.  “You know, why don’t, uh, why don’t you just rest.  You rest here, and I’ll—I’m just going to---I mean, the thing is, you should rest and I need to—I should--“ Tony stuttered.
“Celestial navigation,” Steve broke in, making Tony stop and look to the side then back at Steve in confusion.
Except Tony was almost certain it was for his benefit.  He didn’t know why, except that it was Tesla, and Tony had brought it up, but this was the hill Sisyphus there across the table from him decided to push his rock up, so whatever.
Steve sighed. This was going even worse than he’d imagined, and that was saying something.  “I know.  I completely understand.  I’m so sorry and if I lost you business, well…I will certainly do everything I can to see that you are paid back, I swear.  I…l should tell you though…I don’t think I’m cut out for this.  I mean, I appreciate the opportunity and all, but I just…don’t think I can do this again,” Steve finished.
“We’re just going to stand here and wait?” Tony asked.  “For God knows how long until Steve maybe shows up?  Assuming he even does.  Could have plans, you know.”
Tony’s eyes fell shut, and he let out a low, shuddering moan.  His heart thudded against his ribs, and his cock seemed to pulse in time with the rhythm.  Fuck.  He wanted Steve.   Needed him. Now.
Steve donned the robe he had tossed aside last night and went searching for the veil and loincloth that had somehow ended up halfway across the room.  The veil was nowhere to be found, though Steve did not waste much time looking for it.   Cam would be waiting, anxious excitement and youth being something of a heady combination, Steve knew.  He nodded to the guards as the dour-faced one held the door for him, and caught an exchange of looks between the two as he departed, though on what cause, he could not say.
“I have to admit, this is a pretty impressive transformation,” Rhodey said from where he lounged on Tony’s sofa with his feet propped up on the ottoman that doubled as a coffee table.  “Your Wi-Fi’s acting up, though,” he said with a frown at the phone he held in his hand, making Tony roll his eyes.
The jet had been in stealth mode for the flight, which meant the team couldn’t track them, and they weren’t technically due back until early tomorrow.  Since the op was covert, no one would question it when they didn’t check in.  No one had expected anything near those kinds of perimeter defenses, not for something that was supposed to be a simple grab and go of some Shield tech that had fallen into the wrong kind of hands.  Hell, the team probably wouldn’t panic until they were at least a few hours overdue, which meant another fourteen hours or so before a rescue mission would even be considered, let alone successful.
He wasn’t sure how long it had been.  A while by the look of the progress Tony had made in his book.  Steve’s knees ached.  His thighs burned.  Half of his body was hot, the other half chilled.  His jaw hurt, and he was desperate to wet his lips and mouth, to swallow freely, just once.  His eyes stung, prickling at the corners as wetness made his lashes stick together.   He wasn’t sure how long it had been.  A long time, surely.  The springy hairs above Tony’s cock made him want to scratch his nose.  It was all he could think about.  That and the need to swallow fully.
“Police guy came by, too.  Left his card in the door when I didn’t answer.  Said to call,” Barnes added.
“I just mean from before,” Steve interjected.  “You’re not what I expected.  Some of it, yeah, sure. All the—all the
“S’alright.  I guess,” Steve finally said in a gravelly tone, his throat working around the words.  He hefted the backpack a bit on his shoulder and shrugged, aiming for a nonchalance that Steve could never pull off.  “If you want.”
The creature looked at him a long time. Contemplative. Like it was mulling something over.  Then finally, its mouth twisted into a rueful grimace and it shrugged, then smiled, almost shyly, its eyes warm and fond on Steve.  It hummed agreeably through its gills and disappeared under the water again. Steve supposed that meant all was forgiven.
“And Pepper left about ten minutes ago,” Steve said mildly, though Tony heard the gentle jibe behind it.
special?" he asked, awestruck. "I-- I really mean that much to you? So much that you'd want to do that with me? You've been waiting your whole life for... me?"
At least the program wasn't going to air until the evening. He had, what, four or five more hours before Tony found out exactly what he'd done? And if Tony was in the mood to talk to him afterwards, he had that long to figure out what he was going to say to him.
"One more letter. Listen carefully, please." Tony's voice is unsteady. It's kind of an odd request, as Steve is sure Ghost is hanging on Tony's every word. Tony clears his throat. "Octothorp."
"I have two reasons, actually." Steve held up one finger. "One is that, for professional reasons, I'm intimately familiar with the details of Iron Man's weapons loadout, just as I'm familiar with the abilities of every Avenger. Iron Man doesn't carry anything capable of creating that kind of explosion, whereas Radioactive Man has been known to trigger explosions nearly identical to that one." Steve straightened up and faced the nearest camera. He held up a second finger. "The other reason is that I have proof. Iron Man's armor provides real-time telemetry, which I personally was monitoring during the fight. In accordance with long-standing Avengers protocol, the armor records and reports all weapons discharge, which would include any alleged explosions. The only weapon activity reported during that entire fight was two repulsor blasts whose time codes match up with shots that your own station has visual records of. There is no record of any other weapons discharge. Simply put, Ms. Walders, I can verify that it wasn't Iron Man."
Steve amends his answer. "Don't worry about me, Tony." That is, at least, the truth. "I'm here for you."
Oh, he'd known he'd loved Tony before then. But that was the exact moment he'd known he was completely gone for him.
"Just for you," Steve said, but then he felt like he also had to admit the rest. "Okay, maybe it's not entirely altruistic. It's, um, a big fantasy for me." Damn, there he was again, blushing. "That, um. That act specifically, I mean. Probably my all-time biggest fantasy."
"It's all right," he says, as gently as he can. "I'm sorry that happened to you. The doctors couldn't do anything for it?"
"What-- how--?" Tony was still smiling, and he hadn't gotten back to complete sentences yet. His eyes were shining, as if for once he might cry from pure joy. "How-- how long?"
Oh, no, no, no. This won't work at all. Tony doesn't need to concern himself with Steve's welfare right now. Tony has more important problems. Steve's not the one who's still dropping. Is he? It's not
Tony raised an eyebrow, considering. "Could be either. He is definitely lacking in Wisdom." And then he grinned wide. "Glad I've found someone who put all their points in it. Good choice." He leaned his head against Steve's shoulder. He was nuzzling him. It felt great.
Nodding, Tony looks like he's going to cry again. "Three years. God, Steve, you feel so good." He presses up against Steve, wrapping his arms around him like he wants to touch him with every square inch of skin. Steve thinks that sounds like a great idea.
Carol grinned back. "Hey, there you are. Do you want this to be a team lift or are you okay with just me?"
fantasies now, why don't you?" he murmured. Steve realized that Tony had thought about this too, had pictured this. Their desires reflected back on each other, endless mirrors.
His laugh is a little mechanical beep, and he slaps his hands against his thighs. There's no metallic sound whatsoever. How much armor isn't he wearing?
Steve was touching his arm. Probably. Tony couldn't really see that far anymore. "It's not going to change how I feel," Steve said, his voice full of fierce confidence, and Tony breathed out hard at the reassurance he hadn't even known he needed, and then he couldn't quite catch his breath again. "You're still you, and I'm still going to love you. No matter what."
Something hot and wet sluiced down Tony's torso, underneath the armor, slick against the metal of the chestplate, and, oh shit, that was blood, that was what that was, that was blood outside his body where blood didn't belong, that was
"I wanted to figure out who it belonged to." Tony was fully aware that his defense was pathetic. He'd violated Steve's privacy. What the hell had he been thinking? "I figured I'd open it up, see what was inside, see if there were any clues about its owner."
In response, Tony held up the newspaper, bunched in his fist, then began to unroll it and smooth it out in an exaggerated manner that suggested that this task was taking all his remaining physical dexterity to accomplish. When it was relatively flat, he turned it around. The front-page headline -- it was one of the sleazier daily newspapers -- said IRON MAN NOT NEEDED. Tony was holding it upside-down. The subtitle, as far as Steve could tell, read AVENGERS GOV'T LIAISON ASKED TO INTERVENE.
“Scan this for me, would you?  Then have it blown up to something that would look good over the fireplace,” Tony said, holding up the phone for the scanner to get a good picture.
Steve sighed and turned to head back to where his guards--his, now, assigned by Tony to Steve’s personal protection after Tony banished them from his bedchamber, declaring that Steve was not going to murder him while he slept.  Apparently, there were a number of instances of concubines being used by rival states or opposing political factions throughout the kingdom’s history so as to warrant guards in the rooms of higher-placed courtiers and, most especially, the regent.
“I did?” Steve asked, surprise making his voice rise, though still sluggish and thick-tongued.  He frowned. “I don’t remember. I’m sorry if I disturbed your sleep.”
“The King is coming,” Cam observed from Steve’s side. He stopped rubbing at his sore backside and tugged his tunic into place, or tried to, at least. Around them, the furtive work ceased, and everyone from soldiers to slaves stopped to bow as their King passed by. Steve dipped his head and shoulders, as he had been taught, while Cam bowed almost comically low with sweeping formality. As much as Cam was devoted to his King, Steve mostly thought the boy simply enjoyed the ceremony of it all.
“That’s not—you can’t just punch it, okay?” Tony said, twisting his head around to frown at Steve in frustration.  “What part of acid for blood did you not understand?  You get your ass in the power loader. Even things out. Then you punch it.”
“Look, you asked me before about, you know, some things,” Tony reminded him, “which, I mean, sure, I get why you’d come to me.”
“If those Doombot collectibles down there your Omega just made are any indication, you haven’t,” Widow responded softly.  Tony nodded in reply, though he knew she couldn’t see him.  He moved over to where Steve still sat on top of the Doombot, noticing that Steve was breathing heavily and the  Doombot’s still-attached arm hard enough to leave finger impressions in the metal.
“Dangerous.  Yes,” Tony nodded. “Perhaps it is.” He stepped closer to Steve, then reached out and took Steve’s hands. “Dangerous, but
The distance between them was so clear now, and Steve knew he had been the one to put it there. For a brief moment, his mind shuttered, and he could smell the sea air, feel the wind against his face and see his village in the distance, except now, there was a man on the shore he knew, calling to him and he was still sitting there on the cliff, watching as the fires grew closer and closer. Down there was ash and death and loss, yes, but down there was life and love, too. There was nothing for him up here except the safety of barren rock, an illusion of gaining something, without risking anything. As if such a thing were possible.
“Well.  We’re here.  Home sweet home.  I, ah, hope you like it,” Tony said, extending an arm toward the second elevator in invitation.
“Don’t cross the streams,” Tony mumbled, then reached out in blind panic as the earth underneath him started rocking back and forth.  No.  Wait.  He blinked and groped for purchase as his hands found the arms of the chair he was…sleeping in?  It’s legs settled against the deck where his panicked waking had sent it into motion, and he looked up to find Steve leaning over him.  There was a warmth ghosting its way across his cheek, and a heavy weight settled on his shoulder as he twisted to an upright position in the chair and shook himself awake.
“Wonderful. I’ll have the mission files and all SHIELD’s information on this Krakoa available for review in just a moment,” Fury informed them.  “I’d like your assessment and mission plan within the hour.”
“I didn’t say you were!” Tony retorted, turning around to glare at Steve, who was watching him with narrowed eyes and probably grinding his teeth to sand from the look of his jawline.
Steve frowned down at him for a moment, then his face went soft, the lines that sometimes crept around the corners of his eyes smoothing out. “You, too, Tony,” Steve replied, placing his hand over Tony's and giving it a slight squeeze.
There was a rush of people towards the door.  The camera faltered, the lens dropping so all Steve saw was pounding feet.  He could hear someone calling Tony’s name, though it was distant now, hard to pick out over the swirl of movement and questions called out that no one could answer.  Then the light of the porch and the crunch of shoes on gravel, footfalls over stairsteps of flat rocks, heels clicking and breaths huffing.  A woman’s high-pitched shout of Tony’s name.
“To be fair, I’m pretty sure he was kidding,” Steve replied. Then, he frowned.  “Pretty sure he was kidding. Anyway, if, um, if JARVIS has it, I was thinking about maybe something a little old school?”
“I didn't...I should have realized that you'd...worry. I'm—damn, okay. This is--I'm--Tony, I'm not—I'm not going to do anything to—to punish you. I wouldn't...” Steve broke off, rolling his lower lip between his teeth, his whole posture going rigid.
“It’s a bit of a fixer-upper, I know, but it has a lot of charm.  Two bedrooms, one bath.  Nice sized rooms, actually.  Bigger than you’d think, and for California, actually what we would call downright roomy,” Allen, the realtor Coulson referred Steve to, said, drawing Steve out of his reverie, having apparently taken Steve’s silence for a judgment about the square footage.  “Built in ’53 for the officer housing at Fort Ord.  They updated all the base housing in the late sixties, and someone bought one of the cabins, moved it up here.  Kind of off the grid, but if you’re looking for privacy, this is it.  Floors are the original hardwoods.  Fireplace is original, too.  Some great, classic features,” Allen continued, pivoting in the middle of the kitchen.
“In fact…okay, new plan,” Tony cut him off. “You, Fugitive reject, come back with us. Now. To the hotel, I mean.  Be easier than picking you up tomorrow.  We’ve got plenty of room, and you can keep Steve company.”
“Two of your hamburgers for Jane, if you please!  And she will have some of your apology snacks, as well, Sam Wilson,” Thor called out from the hallway.  “She is a woman of great appetites,” Thor finished with a shrug and pleased nod while Jane smiled proudly.
“God, yes, that’s terrible. Revengers. What, are you all twelve?” Tony said, making a face of disgust. “Don’t worry. We’ll come up with something better.  Brooklyn’s finest?  That’s taken, I guess. Brooklyn’s, I don’t know…mightiest…something?  Eh. My head hurts,” Tony said, pressing his cheek against Steve’s chest.  “Dumbasses.  Carjacking is so 2000’s.  Who does that anymore?  What, were they going to sell the parts to buy a GameCube?  Ugh,” Tony groaned, burying his head a little more into the curve of Steve’s arm as Steve carried him.  “By the way,” he started, clearing his throat a little. “Did I thank you for saving me?  Thank you. That was awesome. I’m still pissed, but, also kind of woozy, and that was really hot, so you’re getting a pass at the moment.  The whole defending my honor, avenging angel thing really works for you, just so you know.  Anyway, so names…I’m blanking.”
“Wouldn’t have,” Tony grunted and coughed a bit, then bowed into a curve as the pain of the action wracked though his body.  “Wouldn’t have pegged you for having a kinky side, Cap,” he managed to gasp out after forcing several deep breaths to fill his lungs.
Tony’s face, hair stringy and wet where it clung to the sides of the helmet, filled Steve’s mind.  Waking up screaming and Tony there by the bed, out of breath and wild-eyed, telling him he was okay, giving him the date, turning on the lights and having Jarvis warm up the room.  Waking up and Tony there. Tony there.
Steve scrubbed a hand over his face, leaving a lock of hair brushing over his forehead that Tony had to resist the urge to push back into place.  He looked off to the side for a moment, then back at Tony with dark eyes that seemed too old and weary for his face.
“I think we could.  Date. I think…I think we would be really good together,” Tony finished, looking down at his feet, his hands shoved so far into his pockets he could practically feel his knees shaking.
Tony threw his hands in the air and walked down the hall to call the elevator again.  At least Steve knew he could come to Tony when he had questions.  That was something.  Tony hadn’t offered that in the beginning, not really.  He should have, but it honestly hadn’t occurred to him.  Steve had just kind of…shown up.  Mission-related questions at first, then later about whatever gadget managed to stump him.  Most of what Tony used in the Tower made that SHIELD crap look like the equivalent of smoke signals.  With a bit of an explanation, Steve got the hang of the new stuff quickly enough, Tony would give him that.
, Tony smiled down at his phone, then switched over to the app and activated Covi’s motors. The drone whirred into the air and Steve’s face filled the camera again.  He was smiling now, wide and happy, his phone cradled in one hand.
Tony stopped and turned to him, clasping his hands onto Steve’s upper arms in a semblance of a hug.  “Steve.  You know we just had our big declaration moment, right?  Right there,” he indicated the bench, “like just a minute ago.  So, when I say this, please know that I say this will all the love in my heart.”
God, how he’d hated that stupid, fucking FAFSA form, Tony remembered with a frown. Granted, he’d probably spent more time complaining about it than actually trying to fill it out, but the whole thing had just been galling, having to squeeze his family’s income into the little boxes while Howard held the threat of cutting him off teetering over his head, sword of Damocles style. All he'd wanted was to take care of Steve, and he'd ended up being more of a burden than anything, not that Steve treated him like that, but it had been painfully clear who was bringing in income and who was drinking it down, one cup of joe at a time.
A thing.  Tony had a thing.  Which was Tony-speak for he’d met someone and was done with team-bonding for the night.  It hit Steve right in the solar plexus, a stabbing burn that made his eyes water and he blinked to clear them.  It was unusual these days for Tony to abandon Steve alone at one of these functions, knowing how much Steve hated the dancing monkey act.  At least it was bearable when Tony was shilling it up by his side.
“Engine stops whining after it lands,” Steve said mildly, then laughed at his own joke.  Tony bit the inside of his cheek, shoulders shaking with mirth, mostly at the familiar resurgence of Steve’s inherent goofball.
Steve shrugged, then toed one shoe off, then the other, then bent to pull his socks off.  It wasn’t like Tony hadn’t seen him, after all.  His hands went to the buttons of his shirt, making short work of them and shrugging it off.  Tony took a seat in one of the ornate armchairs and started placidly picking at the corner of his suit jacket, eyes darting around the room when Steve looked up, so he unbuckled his belt and slid it out of the belt loops, dropping it on top of his shirt on the round, fringed ottoman that sat in the center of the room.
“Nguh?” Tony asked, teeth clacking together as he pushed all the way down again, feeling Steve fill him.
Until then, Steve had believed he understood how much he had missed Tony, but seeing him again, the air left Steve’s chest in a rush, and he felt almost dizzy with relief, as if he had spun round and round in MacGregor’s field until he fell down in a heap while Bucky laughed and told him he looked like Old Duncan, who made drink from the sap that dripped from the pines and stumbled through town trying to trade acorns and mushrooms he’d gathered when he got hungry enough.  He and Bucky had tried them, once, trading the few turnips and potatoes Steve had on him that day for the mushrooms, a sip of the concoction and Old Duncan’s promise that they would feel like they were flying.  They had ended up with stomach cramps for their troubles, and Steve had gotten his ears boxed by his mom and a good talking to, but he still remembered the thrill of that first bite, closing his eyes and expecting something amazing to happen.  That, finally, they would have something that was on the other side of hunger and work and another day of the same.
Not that Steve had been trying, exactly, but he hadn’t not been trying, either, and yet no one ever came close to making him feel like Shellhead did. Not just last night, but all the times he was with Shellhead.  And that…well, that was the heart of it, wasn’t it? Shellhead was different. Special. Clearly, he was special, of course he was, but Steve thought Shellhead would be special if he was just another man sitting next to Steve on a train or waiting in the work line back in Brooklyn, hoping to get picked for the day.  I’d notice him, Steve thought. I’d see him, the way he sees me, even if I’m just Steve Rogers, some know-nothing Irish with barely ten dollars to his name, with scars you can see and those you can’t, with nightmares and dreams, he sees me, and I think I’d see him, too. Shellhead would be extraordinary, even then, at least to Steve, he was sure of it.  How could he not be? The problem was, Shellhead wasn’t just another man on a train or waiting in the work line. And that…well, that was a problem.
They rode the rest of the way in relative silence, though Happy occasionally punctuated it with comments about the other drivers, the interminable road construction and how Google maps once tried to kill him by giving him a route through Buchanan Street down in San Diego, which involved the rather dubious prospect of driving across a gaping chasm of death.  ‘
“I thought you’d like the view up here,” Steve said, lifting his gaze back to the sky.  “I thought you’d like the car, too.”
“I think I understand the Tantric Scrabble thing now,” Steve said as Tony pushed the sheet aside with one hand and grabbed the pillows from behind Steve’s back with the other, urging him down on the bed.  Steve seemed to force his sluggish body to comply, flattening himself out on the bed and letting his legs fall open.
Steve felt his eyes widen. His mouth went dry. His tongue darted out to wet his lips. Blinking, he lifted his eyes to Tony.
Tony’s hips found a slow, languorous rhythm as he thrust in and out of Steve’s slick hole.  It was glorious. Steve felt light, boneless, stretched apart, like a cobweb pulled wide between two trees, seemingly one moment from snapping.  He could hear Tony moaning his name, calling out endearments and praise. It sunk into his skin like he could absorb the words the way a sponge seeps up water.
“The Avengers. SHIELD. Ultron.  Bucky. What’s coming. Us.  I don’t know,” Steve replied, running a hand through his hair.  “Like I said, I couldn’t sleep.”
Zola made his way to an antechamber, the likes of which Steve had never seen.  He forgot the admonition to keep his eyes down and stared in utter amazement at the seemingly random assortment.  He had no idea what he expected to find in the King’s chambers, but this…this was definitely not it.  The room was filled with all manner of contraptions.  Rolls of paper were haphazardly piled on the floor, what looked like a part of a ballista, two wheels of various sizes, and a long table that ran the length of one wall held everything from hammers and awls to finely wrought pincers, the kind goldsmiths used. Pots and jars labeled with words that barely made sense lined a tall cabinet.  Ropes and pulleys hung from the ceiling and walls and connected to the various contraptions that whirred and churned in the room, as if moving of their own accord.  It was almost too much to take in at once.
Finally, Shellhead dragged his gaze back to Steve, his lip caught between his teeth.  One hand was wrapped around Steve’s coin, and he reached up, his hand hovering for a moment as he hesitated, then stroked his fingers through Steve’s hair, just once, but it was enough.  Steve felt a tremor run through him. His body remembered. His body remembered everything. It was all Steve could do not to melt into the touch, and that...well, that was probably going to be a problem, he figured, but it was a problem for tomorrow.  Steve leaned forward and pressed his forehead to Shellhead’s, holding it there as his eyes fell closed. He let out a long, low breath through his nose, licked his cracked lips, and sighed heavily. After a while, Shellhead sagged against him, his hands threading through Steve’s hair, holding him close.
He liked to watch Steve run.  He liked to watch Steve do a lot of things, but when he would see Tony leaning up against the gray stone sidewall that buttressed the steps, if there wasn’t anyone else out walking their dog or off to catch one of the early trains, if the street was quiet, as it often was, if no cars eased past and no trucks trundled over the potholes that Mrs. Kaczynski wrote her letters to City Hall about, if it was just the two of them, he would stop being Steve for a moment.  He would
Yeah, that’s a real tough nut to crack, Rogers. Going to have to think on that some, Steve mentally admonished himself.
“Home, Happy,” Tony said, then hit the button to raise the privacy glass and leaned back against the limo’s plush interior.  “Dating while married is nice.  Kind of like a sure thing, but with all the getting to know you excitement thrown in for good measure.  Why don’t people do this more often?  Get married, fall in like, bring down a global terrorist network.  And people say romance is dead,” Tony clucked his tongue, shaking his head.  “We could start a trend.  Speaking of,” he said, pulling out his phone and reading the ubiquitous email from Pepper. “Pepper sent some Instagram pics.   We truly are
It was wonderful agony. His abused hole quivered at the touch of Tony’s tongue and his cock jerked. He pushed his hips back, eager for more, and Tony obliged, darting his tongue into the gaping opening and licking along Steve’s soft inner walls. Steve’s hips canted forward, jerking spasmodically as Tony’s tongue thrust in and out in some kind of obscene mirror of his cock. In and out, flicking the tip against Steve’s rim, then thrusing in deep to taste. Tony took the edge of Steve’s rim between his teeth and nipped, then sucked, stroking the abused flesh with his tongue when he was finished, then licked deep, his fingers digging into Steve’s hips.
“No.  No, let me get this out.  Please.  I need to just…say this.  Half the time, nothing makes sense anymore, and everything that I thought I knew, it’s like…it’s just gone.  And there’s this…this blank space in front of me, but it’s that white space, that white that’s so white, it almost hurts to look at, so I just…don’t.  I don’t look at it.  See, so, I need you to tell me,” Tony broke off, drawing in a shuddering breath.  Steve’s shoulder was wet.  Tony’s whole body felt shaky, tense and too loose at the same time.  “I need you to tell me how to do this.  Because, I’m…everywhere I look, it’s too bright, and I can’t see.  I can’t see, Steve.  How we do this.   I can’t see it.  So.  I need you to tell me.  Please.
“Yeah.  Yeah, sure, that’ll work. Thanks,” Cap said.  He sounded relieved, though Tony was probably reading way too much into rescheduling a training session.
“Almost there, baby. You can do it,” Tony encouraged. Steve let out a choked, desperate sounding sob as Tony pressed down hard on his prostate, then let up, then pushed hard again and again, repeating the motion over and over as he pumped his fingers into Steve’s body. Steve’s back bowed and he let out a sharp cry, his cock once again hardening in Tony’s hand.
Steve took another sip of tea and watched the fire. It was cooling fast, but still warm enough to hide some of the taste. It was supposed to help his digestion before bed, or so the doctor claimed, though he managed just fine by not having much of an appetite to begin with.  He ought to try to go to bed, but the storm was too loud, he told himself, and he still had his tea to finish anyway, since he had promised Lizzie he would drink it.  Damn tea should make at least one of them feel better, he thought with a frown aimed down at the cup.  Might as well be Lizzie, he supposed. She worried about him too much.
“Steve.  You know we don’t make the schedules. The client makes the schedules.  Mr. Stark did not request you today,” she admonished firmly.  “We do not interrupt our clients’ lives to let them know we can work them in.  That’s not how this works.”
be your Omega,” Tony finally managed.  He nudged the bottle cap with his fingers, sending it rolling across the desk.  They both watched it tumble, neither of them moving.
I'd also like to thank Joss Whedon for Age of Ultron making all my headcanons about how messed up Steve is into canon.  Made writing this a lot easier!
“A house to retire in,” Tony replied dully.  “You could put one of those plastic flamingos in the yard.  Make the neighbors hate you.”
“I...I don’t think I’m the right person to do that, Tony,” Steve protested, shifting uncomfortably in his chair.
He could imagine it. What something like this would have done to someone like Steve. The idea that he had scared Tony. That Tony went to this kind of length to get away from him. Because, you're a precious princess who must be protected, he recalled Rhodey's words. A joke, but only because they'd all believed it to be true back then. Steve and his mother-henning, showing up to walk Tony home from a late night at the lab or giving their neighbor such a stern talking to, the guy practically ran every time he saw Tony, much to Tony's utter delight. Skinny little nothing of a thing palling around with Barnes and getting his ass kicked because he couldn't figure out that walking away from the bully might be the better part of valor.
