Yinsen has come over, shocked and yelling with wide eyes. “Why would you -” is all that Tony hears before the edges go black, his throat closes up and he thinks hysterically ‘I shouldn’t be able to die in Hell’.
“Stay,” Steve demands and tightens his hold on Tony. Tony lets out a hum and rolls over to face Steve, all mischief and happiness.
So, he goes home. He takes a long hot shower and changes into a comfortable pair of jeans, ignoring that his favorite pair is still missing, and pulls on a tattered green hoodie. It takes drinking two full glasses of tap water to work up the courage to ask JARVIS where he can find Tony.
“It’s an electromagnet, hooked up to a car battery, trying to keep the shrapnel stationary.” Tony says, looking over the lines of Yinsens suit. It looks neat, but the tattering along the edges and the yellowing along the collar make Tony ache for the other man’s losses.
Rhodey looks away and sighs, laying his head against the tent’s tension tight wall. “We need to have someone look into that.” He remarks with a gesture to Tony’s chest.” Make sure-”
“Anything else Mr. Stark?” Pepper sighs, somehow professionally.
He watches her, nothing but a friendly gleam to his eye as she pulls out a few bottles of disgustingly expensive liquor. “Now, this one I learned in Agia Paraskevi.”
Gun to the head is actually not a bad way to go. Quick.
“Oh shut up.” Tony replies, but the words sound like a caress, soft and gentle as Tony’s fingers playing with the strands of his hair.
It’s awkward for all of three seconds, before Steve sags with a deep exhale and allows his weight to rest up against Tony. "Yeah, okay."
Aside from the stillness there is nothing new or particularly interesting about Starks appearance. He is in one of his usual suits, jacket tossed over the back of his chair and sleeves rolled to the elbows. The vest is still on, though unbuttoned and his tie is only loosened enough to allow his collar to splay open to the first button. He wears a watch on his left wrist, a silver piece with a large black face that likely lights up when he tilts his wrist in just the right way. Sunlight catches in his hair and Steve is struck by how light some of the strands are, a vibrant honey brown weaved in along the near black of the artful tousle.  Even though his face is relaxed and tired, Steve can make out the marks of laugh lines around both of his eyes, can almost trace the worry lines on his forehead. His fingers itch to smooth down the deep furrow between his brows.
“I had a really good time.” Steve murmurs and finally leans back far enough for Tony to start seeing straight again. His hair is a little wild and it seems Tony got a good handle on his collar if the crooked swoop of his T-shirt is anything to go by. Hell, even his hoodie is precariously close to sliding down his arm on the one side. It is a sight, a beautiful one sure, but Tony barely sees it.
“Shouldn't try to breathe the coffee.” Steve remarks once he is back in his seat, watching Stark take small sips of the water between a couple more coughs. “If you need it that bad at least use an I.V.”
One more acre comes up empty when the sensors flash, and Tony’s eyes lock onto the faint red and yellow blur.
Alright, no it
There is always this angry bundle in his nerves whenever Iron Man goes off on a mission by himself. At least with Clint and Natasha he knows SHIELD usually sends them off together or with a group of other agents. Iron Man always goes alone and it feels wrong in just about every way possible. Steve is his partner, they fight alongside each other, lead the Avengers together. It makes him itch whenever he can’t be of assistance, when he is no better than benched. Stark never allows it though, and Steve has tried many times. He promised to sign any non-disclosure agreements, just about begged Iron Man to talk some sense into his boss. In the end though he respected Iron Man's choice for secrecy and Stark’s right to decide his employees responsibilities. “Well, okay. Tell Shellhead good luck for me will ya, JARVIS?”
“Captain, are you alright? Your breathing is elevated and your heart rate is well outside normal bounds.” JARVIS calls out and Steve jumps. The box falls to the ground and Steve dives after it without thinking. Luckily, the ring stays snug in its seat, but Steve is now on his hands and knees holding a tiny box that should not exist.
“You are such a spoilsport.” And maybe that is the heart of it. Maybe she is the problem, too uptight, too pulled together by years of clawing her way through and above the glass ceiling. Maybe she is too grounded and he is too high above it all, burning bright and blinding.
“Oh my god. How could, I can’t believe-” Her eyes are filling with tears as she stares at his exposed chest. She reaches out, but does not touch it before enveloping him in the hug he so sorely longed for this entire time. “Oh Tony, I am so sorry!” He lets her hold him for longer than is really appropriate for the type of relationship he is steadfastly determined to have with her. Still he is the one to pull away and he mentally pats himself on the back for the show of strength.
Tony can’t spare much thought for that though because his eyes are open now, and just past the top of Steve’s head he can see his dick. He can see it as it jerks in his hand and then as his cum spurts out and onto Tony’s stomach. It’s on him, it’s getting on the hem of his shirt and Tony can’t fucking care because some of it is getting on his cock and Steve’s cum is on his dick and that is… That is so
Stepping back, Steve shoves his hand deep into his pockets. He picked Tony to focus on, he picked talking to Iron Man and all the strange memories will have to wait. Tony shifts and finally meets his eyes, the expression is only barely better than earlier that afternoon. His face should never look that destroyed.
Steve is twisting his wrist on the upstroke and sliding down quick right after running his palm over the head. Tony breathes harshly, neck arching and back bowing. Steve is fucking faster into his hand, matching the pace of his own strokes over Tony.
And all of that only speaks to the underlying personality, the part she figured out well enough within the first two weeks. The parts that make him truly interesting are much harder to write up in a report without sounding like a loquacious mid century author. He shows nothing resembling jealousy or possessiveness for any lover, but nearly hisses when anyone so much as looks at his favorite mug. The mansion is kept firmly above 78 degrees at all times and still, the fireplace is lit most evenings and he sits near it no matter how many blankets cover him at the time. Yet, when anything hot so much as ghosts his skin he soaks it under ice cold water for ages.
People base romantic entanglements on less and for all Steve usually likes to befriend someone first, he is not above going into that sort of thing with a hope for more. If Stark is interested, well, he would definitely not complain.
He is losing track, lost and consumed, happily drowning in the slick slide of their mouths. Then Steve pulls back just enough to trail across Tony’s cheek and over to his ear. There is nothing to stop him, nothing for his lips to focus on and the sound is out before he can think to stop it. Cracking and breathy, it slips into the air like it has a life of its own and it might as well because Tony can’t be responsible for himself, let alone a noise. Steve is biting his earlobe and holy fuck it makes his body collapse, makes his shoulder drop and his back twist. His hips grind down harshly and Steve grunts.
The run goes smoothly, as does the rest of the morning. He eats a large breakfast on his own floor and goes up to the common living room afterwards. No one else seems to be up yet, but he prefers to write up his reports in the expansive and bright space.
“What?! No! Of course not!” Tony all but squeaks back. “We almost killed each other before Loki broke out and the whole world ending shit distracted us!”
“Guess I’m making you a new suit, then, Cap.” Tony finally says when he can’t stand it anymore and resolutely turns to look at Steve’s face. He keeps his frown hard, demanding Steve to say something, anything to that. Steve’s eyes widen even as he continues to stare at the far wall. His whole body looks coiled, ready to run back into the storm and Tony nearly dares him to do it.
“The other ones I want you to scan in, then sort the timeline entries in order of occurrence and split into subcategories for Banner, Romanoff, Barton, Thor, Rogers, and SHIELD. For anything not mentioning those categories set in a personal directory split in whatever way makes the most sense to you.” Tony continues, voice beginning to slur with the comfort of the whirling machines all around him. The light behind his eyes begins to dim, but he does not bother thanking Jarvis.  “I’m sure it goes without saying, but all of these are of the highest security rating. They should only be held on my personal servers behind the absolute most stunning firewall and encryption your little heart can come up with.”
For reasons unknown, that makes a rush of heat flood Steve’s face and he looks down at the table to hide what is sure to be an impressive flush. “I mean, like talking one on one.” He tries and simply has to rub a hand over the back of his neck. Chancing a glance back up at Stark he sees the man look at him with something like understanding. It seems Stark actually knows exactly what he means, but he still feels himself continue. “With people, strangers. Getting to know people and, well.” His flush deepens, he can feel the rush of blood spreading down his chest and over his nose. He flails a hand out to gesture at Stark’s chest. “I never had any luck like you do.”
Without looking up, Tony responds, “can I, well, I wanted to ask you something?” He is all but scuffing his toe into the floor and Steve chuckles a bit at the nervous gesture. Something about it makes him feel more at ease.
“It’s late.” Steve mutters from far away, but he’s leaning forward, down down down, to press his lips into the side of Tony’s neck. That is, wow, that is so much better than kissing Steve’s jaw. He is gentle, soft and sweet with his light sucking kisses. He takes his time, drags his lips up the length of Tony’s carotid and bites down where it meets his jaw. God, no wonder Steve let out such a great huff of air. Tony can feel his own leeking out, a high pitched thing dragged up right along with it.
“But, those aren’t even the weirdest things.” Steve says instead, remembering the apologetic way JARVIS told him the mission was classified. If Iron Man needs to talk about it, he will. They have built up a solid friendship over the last two years. He knows he can tell his Shellhead anything and knows Iron Man feels the same way.
“I thought you just wanted to kiss me.” Steve says softly, cutting Tony off mid stroke. His grin is cheeky, clearly pleased to have Tony so focused on petting his hair.
They are eye to eye now, Tony can make out every individual shade of Steve’s eyes and they are so horribly beautiful. The little crinkles at the edges hint at what he’ll look like as the years pass, and Tony is overcome with the need to see that someday. It’s dumb, just a fleeting idea, but something about watching the age lines work their way into Steve’s skin, of being the one to make sure they are more for laughs than worry. Well, it has an appeal to it. Something much more than an appeal if Tony is being honest.
Their aim is not as good the second time around. Bullet to the eye apparently is not always fatal. Almost hurts worse than a hole in the chest, but he doesn’t bare it for long before, “I’m sorry. You can’t-”
“Yes.” Steve agrees and something about Tony’s rising body temperature must be coming across as promising because his hands are shaking less, gripping tighter. It’s so unbelievably good, Tony just might not even make it to doing whatever the hell it is Steve’s suddenly decided he wants to try. “I really really want to. Could we do something?”
“Nope, I actually really don’t.” Tony declares, stuffing his hands into his pockets and pointedly ignoring the sting in his shoulder at the movement.
it for you!”
“I thought we were gonna play some chess?” He asks and Tony simply has to roll over and bury his grin in Steve’s chest.
“I did really think we were going to play a few games first,” He can’t help but tease, trying to salvage some dignity in the face of his panting breaths and the string of saliva looping between their open mouths. Steve just smirks and shifts to squeeze hard at Tony’s ass before suddenly scooping him up and against his chest. Reflexively Tony wraps his legs around Steve’s waist and gasps when the movement presses the hard lines of Steve’s abs against his leaking dick.
An explosion and Yinsen is pressing close behind him as Tony pushes through the smoke and falling rocks, out into the startling morning. More yelling and another missle, heavy breathing behind and next to him, a grunt and a hiss. Then Tony is grappling for Yinsen, who struggles but latches onto the handholds carved into the backplate and steps into the protrusions on the side of each knee. For a briefe hysterical moment the jets remain dormant and Tony hacks a small laugh at having to do all this again. Then just as quickly, they pulse to life and he assumes the familiar stance as they blast jarringly into the sky. The last rocket drops heavy as they rise, and the entire cave is engulfed in blazing plumes.
Tony looks a little abashed at her tone, but quickly ties up his features into the fake smirk he’s been sporting so often as of late. “And it is lovely, but the blue just doesn’t go with my complexion.”
When Tony woke up the next morning, ass sore in the most delicious way possible he tried not to be disappointed by the lack of a warm body next to him. When he saw nothing but the faintest glimpses of Steve for the following four days he let himself pout a bit and locked himself in the workshop to get over the self hatred for apparently making their tenuous friendship even worse.
They rolled off, tussled with each other between laughing and Tony thought maybe things were finally going to be good between them, maybe a little outlet was all they needed. But suddenly Steve was over him, straddling his hips and pinning his wrists to the ground and Tony’s breath choked. Everything had stilled, suspended for a second before Steve shifted and brushed his ass down over Tony’s stunningly hard erection.
The burning of jet fuel drowns out any other sound and Tony focuses entirely on getting enough horizontal distance while preventing too much vertical raise. The rudimentary stabilizers in his forearms are nearly pointless, but any aim is better than blind tumbling out of the sky. The boots begin to putter and short, just a few moments before the stabilizers completely run out of fuel and they are sinking heavy through the air. Managing to keep Yinsen above him is all Tony can manage, but a poorly cushioned landing will be better than being crushed into the sand by 300 pounds of metal. Besides, somehow Tony did manage to buoy the descent, so the collapse is not as sharp as his last life’s attempt.
If you don't mind the scars
He only got to talk with Tony for another few minutes before Clint came in for breakfast, followed closely by Bruce and Thor. The asgardian only stayed in the tower on rare occasions, so catching up with him ended up taking most of Steve’s attention. Before he realized, Tony had left the room without a goodbye. Steve decided not to take it to heart, well use to Tony removing himself from team moments. Instead, he promised to make the genius feel more welcome among them. Even if their little step into flirting leads nowhere, it would be good for everyone to see the same things in Tony he is starting to.
"Move." This time the demand is paired with a light shove to Steve’s shoulder as Tony tries to pull up the edge enough to get room for him to crawl into the pile.
“Tony.” The name feels perfect on his tongue. He wants to say it a hundred times.
“There is. I need you to get that agent you talked with today on my calendar ASAP.” He saw Coulson in the back talking to her right as he’d stepped onto the stage. His entire plan had hinged on the guy coming into the picture and he is glad he remembered Pepper mentioning how she’d met the agent correctly.
“Steve,” is all Tony seems able to say in response. His smile wavers, then brightens. He laughs and leans forward to brush their lips together.
“It’s a college town right by Athens.” She answers with an airy chuckle and shy sideways smile. He grins back and nods in some sort of understanding.
“You know it’s true. I know-” Tony bites back that, because really there is no way the person he was at this point would have even considered Obadiah, even though the signs all blazed out in hindsight.“I think I know who tipped them off.”
“Not a damn clue.” Steve admits and Tony lets out a sigh, fainted annoyance clear in the over exaggerated raise and drop of his shoulders. It reminds Steve of the armor and he realizes so many of Tony’s gestures are too large because he learned to convey them through the suit. It’s such a little thing to realize, a fact that really serves no purpose in the grand scheme, but Steve treasures it. Steve feels his heart full to bursting at the thought that he gets to realize these little things, that he gets to learn the insignificant facts that make up Tony Stark.
“What happened?” Tony asks once the fire is stoked and filling the room with a pleasant warmth. Steve is still shivering, but the violence of the movements has subsided enough to calm Tony’s nerves. For a long moment the silence stretches and Tony wonders if Steve will ever tell him anything again.
They make it to the restaurant without more hazy half memories flashing in Steve’s mind and he is familiar enough with Il Ghiottone’s to ignore the unreality at being seated in the familiar space. They sit at a table further to the back than where he always saw himself eating the pasta, but it feels more secluded and private. Plus, sitting in a new place helps pull him more firmly into the present moment and away from the fake past.
Steve wakes up just as the sun starts to peek into the room. He feels stiff, likely from the long battle yesterday, and a bit chilly. With a deep yawn he stretches his left arm out across the bed. For a moment he is disoriented, but upon opening his eyes he realizes the large amount of empty bed between himself and the night stand is only because he migrated completely to one side. Usually, he ends up in the exact center, sprawled to make use of all available space. With that in mind he rolls once and swipes up his phone to check the time.
“And you think they stayed in contact after.” Not a question. Rhodey’s jaw tightens, anger building under his skin.
It’s that ‘about to face down the world with just my own two fists’ fire in his eyes, the one Tony fell for that first day. That righteous bite to his look that meant he was going to pass calculus whether Tony helped him or not, but that he intended to get the world’s worst T.A to take his job seriously. Which of course he did, because Steve could do absolutely everything he set his mind to. He could get someone that finished learning single variable calc when he was 8, actually looking at the material again. He could get the guy who scheduled office hours every second thursday from 12am-3am, hold test review for the entire class without more than two minutes of prompting.
“Who, Tony?” He knew the answer already, Tony could see it in the heavy rise and fall of the man’s breathing.
Steve knows Tony Stark for all of twenty minutes when he figures out there is something decidedly different about the man. Certainly, the idea that Stark is anything but normal occurs to him long before their less than stellar introduction. Even if the man’s file hadn’t made it quite clear how out of the box he was, the sudden jarring music vibrating through the air as a glowing suit of red and gold comes flying down upon him would have clued Steve in. Still the extent, the sheer enormity of how unique this explosion of a person is, really hits after they subdue Loki and make it onto the jet Romanov pilots.
“Sir, I have located Captain Rogers.” JARVIS announces then. Tony smiles in silent thanks for getting that train wreck of a thought process cut off. Pepper looks up from her hands, lips pursed and eyes crinkled in mirth like she somehow new exactly what Tony had just been thinking. “He is currently staying at the Best Westerns on Wildcat Cir. in Lincoln Nebraska. Also his cell number is listed on the file Agent Coulson gave you.”
“Sleep,” Steve finally tells him, when they are more breathing each other’s air then kissing.
Tony is far from the last person on earth to figure it out, but the amount of time it takes him to finally realize there is more than spontaneous empathic abilities happening here is ludicrous to say the least.
“I have a plan. Attack!” All his effort to keep the panic at bay sweeps away instantly as Stark disappears into the black sky. The rope stays taut even as it stretches out and passes through the bottom of the plane, staying perfectly straight. It hurts in some distant way, an ache that asks for soothing, but does not demand it. Still, something about the sensation, this invisible tether between him and the strange metallic man, spurs him into action. His hands are on a parachute before any thought can be given to the motion.
"Okay, I don't wanna pry or poke at some weird super soldier psychosis or anything, but what the hell is up with the eskimo look you got going here?" Which, okay may have not be the gentlest way to get Steve back into the living room with him, but brash humor is Tony’s default setting. Poke hard, but in a funny place so you get their attention but can be indignant at their anger.
“Never.” Steve hisses, arms pulling Tony too tight, but he relishes the feel of the reactor digging into his sternum, the feel of his body tucked into his arms. Tony shivers, but he doesn’t flinch or try to wriggle free and Steve thinks he needs it just as much. Needs it more.
“Yeah?” He calls when it looks like Tony will continue to stare at the workbench for the rest of the day if he doesn’t say something.
“What?” Tony’s eyes are comically wide in mock indignation and she can feel some tears prickling at the edge of her eyes with how hard she is pushing to keep a straight face. Tony sees it, because of course he does, and the mirth in his eyes doubles as he waves the metal in the air in the same way she would wag her finger at him. “I think that last one was a keeper.”
Pepper gestures to her watch at that, nearly 10:30 PM, but he just shrugs. He knows Rogers is awake, sleeping emotions are muted and far away, and even if he didn’t it gets earlier when you go west. It’s not like 9:30 PM is really that late on a Tuesday night. The guy is barely in his late twenties.
“You look great.” Tony tells him, but his eyes are fixed on Steve’s face. They’ve been fixed on his face since the moment the door opened and Steve wants to do something crazy. He wants to kiss Tony right now, wants to grab his face in both his hands and press himself in close. They’ll fit together perfectly, he knows Tony’s facial hair will prickle against his own freshly shaved skin, remembers the tingle of it. He wants to experience it for real though, wants to put a solid focus to that memory, that maybe premonition.
“Phase Two is SHIELD used the Cube to make weapons.” He announces, feeling a wash of pride as Stark’s eyes widen in surprise. The feeling only flows brighter when he gets a smirk from the man after turning to say, “Sorry, the computer was moving a little slow for me.”
Clint, however, seemed to have absolutely no reservations. He’d gotten up without a word to anyone else and started yelling for Stark to get his ass to the party before even getting into the elevator. Three minutes later they both entered the room, Tony disheveled and irritated, Clint all smiles. Without so much as an explanation, Clint tossed Tony into the seat next to Steve, took his own on the floor in front of Natasha and immediately started campaigning for Wreck it Ralph.
They’d finished running through a layer of contracts for the coming year, something Stark approached with a ruthless thoroughness that still shocked her at times. When the man suddenly flipped the light switch of his personality and demanded to know her prowess with mixed drinks, she’d happily insisted he allow her to show him some of her favorites. Now, six of her most elaborate shot concoctions later, the man was treating the living room like a five star club, loud rhythmic music and low lighting included.
Steve’s hands stop kneading into the meet of his ass to start running up and down his back, long sweeping movements that settle Tony further. It gets tender, grows sweet and soft and so achingly gentle Tony isn’t sure anything before even happened. His chest is still heaving, he is still gulping down great breaths every time they seperate an inch, but it feels slower. His lungs fill, his diaphragm expands and his heart thump thump thumps in his chest like a deep base rhythm.
“Tony, did you
“A miniature arc reactor cut into my chest.” Tony admits after a small pause. Rhodey knowing would not disprove that Obidah got the information from someone in the Ten Rings. Tony is pretty sure, but he never got a complete picture of how personally involved Stane was post capture. If he found out another way, well, Obidah having no idea about the arc can only mean good things.
“No, no. More.” Tony is saying, even before Steve really opens his eyes. Again, it works for a moment, it always works for a moment and that is the best thing about Steve, honestly. He leans in closer, pressed tight and hard. His mouth is closed but so firm and plump. God, how is just pressing their mouths together so wonderful?
“There has to be something we can do.” Pepper asks helplessly, fists releasing.
With a jerk Steve pulls himself out of his thoughts and turns to grab the freshly filled mug from under the coffee maker. The gesture feels strange after all the, well, ogling Steve just partook in. Still, it feels like a nice enough ice breaker and Steve’s wanted to get to know the man better for years now. They started on such wrong footing and even after moving the whole team into his Tower, he still kept his distance.
With Steve though, god, it just makes him feel so good. He loves being crowded into the wall, loves how Steve can cover his entire body without trying at all. It makes him want things, want to grasp and grind and move this to a more horizontal location. Steve’s hands are so big, they can hold Tony’s entire head between them, block his view from anything but those plump pink lips. His arms, his arms are so strong, firm and warm and Tony could run his hands over them all day and still find a new curve to investigate. And his shoulders. They are perfect, solid and wide and shaped exactly for Tony’s arms to drape over them, for his hand to clutch into and hold when Steve twirls his tongue just so.
"I go lay on top of one of my car's engines." It’s true, even before Pepper left, the rumble was like a heartbeat that never asked questions. Lately, he found himself up here more often, but when it got really bad, when is felt too silent and empty around him, when he woke up to JARVIS’s disembodied voice as the only noise he would start up one of his babies. Would lay on top of it and pretend it was someone breathing beneath him. Would sometimes pretend the whirling was JARVIS’s heartbeat beneath him.
“No, I did it so I could sleep at night. Distracting you is just a happy side effect.” Tony grins at him and lets their hands separate. Rhodey moves further back but his eyebrows are pulled tight together and his eyes are stern in warning.
Tony pulls away from him, settles into his lap so they can see each other’s faces again. His skin is blotchy from crying, but his eyes are clear and warm. His smile is contagious, so bittersweet and beautiful. “I missed you so much, Steve.”
Nothing else seems forth coming, but he does not ask for another shot, so she probes. “When were you breathing fire?”
“Sure.” Iron Man replies easily enough, but even through the voice modulator Steve can make out an under current of hesitation. He takes a breath and looks at the indistinct expression of the faceplate until Iron Man brings a hand up in a gesture of ‘go on’.
“When you started coming down and eating with me, I was so happy.” Tony admits and he smiles, faint and wobbly, but real all the same. “God Steve, I went weeks just wanting you to sit on the couch with me. I just wanted to talk to you. I just wanted you to tell me it was going to be okay.”
There is nothing to say to that, nothing that won’t sound pathetic and needy, so Tony turns away and leaves the room. He shuts down the face plate and connects to the nearest satellite. It takes a few moments, but Natasha picks up, her face flickering into view. She doesn’t say anything, just looks over his face and sags in sudden relief.
“Sorry sorry!” Iron Man replies, back straightening. The static tapers off while Steve schools his features into a less manic grin. The smile doesn’t completely dissolve though and Iron Man seems more relaxed, his posture easy and friendly like Steve has come to know.
Stark headbutts Thor, the name for their current foe that Steve pulls up in correspondence to the face he'd glimpsed. If the following impact and subsequent free fall backwards is anything to go by, Stark's move did little more than upset the 'God'. Somehow, the man stops himself from crashing into anything behind him and instead starts gliding forward quickly. Flight is decidedly the most surreal thing to feel without the sight to put the weightlessness into context. Fists are being thrown now, punctuated by what must be Thor's own fists rattling the casing Steve can just barely feel surrounding Stark's body. The suit absorbs most of what he can only assume would be rather harsh jabs, but the way it vibrates Starks' skin is not at all pleasant.
The doors open then and Steve blinks to see the penthouse living room. His blankets is still tossed over the couch, but it’s clearly been moved. He wonders if Tony knows it belongs to him, if he covers himself in the soft fabric and thinks of Steve.
“Can’t believe you took me there on our second first date.” Steve tells him, giving into his pout with two quick pecks.
“It’s good. Open.” Pepper has finished packing up now and slings the bag over her shoulder. After smoothing the wrinkles in her skirt as best she can, she smiles and waves at him. He returns the gesture, grabbing the only pen left on the table so he can twirl it in his fingers. She points at her watch and raises both eyebrows to silently remind him that she plans to be over bright and stupid early tomorrow. He bites the end of his pen and nods.
“Not just yet.”
“Hey,” He whispers when he stands close enough to brush the fringe of Steve’s hair off his forehead. It’s gotten long, but something about it and the new beard suit him. Tony decides not to say anything about it.“Can you eat a bit of this for me?”
Then he pulls back and opens his eyes and Tony keeps his closed on principle, keeps his chin tilted up and parts his lips to lick the bottom one because he knows how to play these games. It gets him a rough huff of air that tastes like victory.
Steve looks up at him again and Tony’s reaching seems to have only pushed the man farther away. His eyes are nearly glazed over and he spends several long breaths just staring at Tony, through and past him. Tension slowly bleeds in all around them and Tony’s eyes are getting watery from the steam, but he no longer remembers how to lower his arms. The walls of the room are in stark focus, the texture of the carpet too rough on Tony’s feet, the soft white light from the kitchen burning his peripheral. The room is far too aware of itself, the tension is sentient and staring down Tony with the same blue glaze of Steve’s eyes.
He changes into a suit on the way, while Rhodey sits and watches Yinsen for him. A good dozen cuts line his face and about 98% of his body is a bruise, but the padding in the suit had been enough to avoid any broken or sprained limbs. Rhodey still has to help him stand from the wheelchair when the cargo doors open onto the landing bay of Edwards Air Force Base. Yinsen is wheeled away to the ground transport vehicles and Tony reluctantly allows himself to be separated from the man. For now.
Tony steps out first and Steve follows like they’ve been connected by some invisible string and it can only be pulled so tight. It’s because of this, that they are standing so ridiculously close when Tony turns around to face him.
“Fuck.” Tony mutters to himself as he staggers unevenly in the sand, leavering up from his hands and knees with effort. He takes a long shaky pull of dry air with closed eyes. Then he is grinning and laughing and coughing with delight.
“Do you think, if you’re free I mean...” Tony starts, still in that same nervous tone. Then he shifts and takes in a deep breath. Steve always marvels this ability to shift from one tone to another so seamlessly. It is something he saw hints of with Iron Man, but the full power Tony has over his mannerisms can be staggering at times. It feels like a privilege to ever see him unguarded. His eyes are back on Steve and his smile is all friendly nonchalance. “Do you want to go for dinner tonight?”
“Cap!” He screams and trudges forward, blasting the snow out of his way. “Answer me, damn it!” The HUD is spitting readouts of a lowered heartbeat and shallow breaths and Tony wants to start sobbing in relief. Somehow he keeps it together long enough to fall to his knees at Steve’s side and start digging him out.
“That’s all?”
“Mm.” Steve mumbles and tightens his hold on Tony’s middle. Tony laughs and tries to squirm away. “Going somewhere?”
“Tony.” Pepper tries, but he starts walking them towards the car, somehow pulling Rhodey along through sheer stubbornness. On whose part he is not sure.
be better.”
It’s way too warm and Tony still vaguely wants to be holding his mug, but he also feels more comfortable than he has in months, years even. Steve is solid, but soft, all along his right side and the comforter is a thick down not dissimilar to the one Tony himself sleeps with whenever he makes it to his bedroom. The window directly in front of them is open to let in the neverending glimmering of Manhattan stretching out into the horizon. It feels like home.
When Stark opens his eyes, when Steve can feel him breathing, can feel him talking, he nearly collapses in relief. He feels so overwhelmed by joy, feels completely wracked through with sorrow at how wrong he was about this astonishing man.
Another pause and Pepper is staking up all their piles and sliding them evenly into her medieval torture device of an accordion folder. She keeps glancing over at Tony, observing his strange fiddling and jerky not quite spinning in his chair. He would probably be twirling the cord if such phones still existed and he wasn’t using surround sound.
"Hey!" The shout is unnecessary by the time it leaves his mouth as both men are now zeroed in on Steve. He tries to persuade Thor into standing down, tries to remind him that they are suppose to be on the same side. But, it dissolves quickly and before Steve has time to think about the uptick of Stark's heart beat, he is thrusting his shield up in time with Thor crashing his hammer down and they are all sent careening backwards from the explosion. The strange looping as Stark and he experience the same sensations, however Iron Man's are muted by the armor, knocks more wind out of him than the impact with the dirt.
For a second there is just the sensation of Tony’s smile, just the pressure of him kissing back. Then the world starts spinning and Steve stumbles backwards, clutching at his head as it starts to fracture and throb. He can feel the cry of pain travel up his throat, but the world is flashing too bright by the time it comes out for him to hear it.
Yinsen is shaving in front of a tiny warped mirror and Tony freezes. So still dreaming.
Pepper stares at him in bafflement and it takes until they are out of the conference centers parking lot for her to finally speak. “What is going on? I am more lost than I think I have ever been in all my time working for you and I was here during the Tokyo debacle.”
When Bruce leaves, Steve takes a break from the report to eat lunch and sit on the bench by the far window. He looks out on the large expanse of New York swathed in the bright glow of early afternoon and finds himself grinning at the sight of a red and gold blur approaching the Tower. When it passes under the common floor balcony, Steve bites his lip in disappointment, but resolves to wait patiently for Iron Man to finish his business with Stark. His Shellhead always comes up for a conversation before leaving anyways.
“How, uh, what have you been doing lately?” Stark asks. His voice is a little awkward, but his smile is soft and inviting. All of his attention is on Steve and despite the stiffness to his posture, the genuine interest makes Steve grin back.
Something occurs to her at that and she lets her mind pull up the memories as he takes a gulp of air and shoots. A man, not much younger than Stark, alone in a remote house somewhere east of Mezyn. He stoked the fire and spat into it a ball not unlike an ember, igniting the hearth anew as she observed through the far window. His death was quick and his body dragged thirty miles back to a rendezvous point. She’d been fifteen and freshly upgraded to missions at the highest risk level. A Drakon, hunted for his blood and bones, whose last words she no longer remembered.
He does not get far before both Pepper and Rhodey are at his sides and fuming. “Tony, what the hell are you doing?” and “Really, you couldn’t have warned me at all?” snap out of each respectively but he just grins and continues walking.
For all Tony loved being pressed into the wall and surrounded by every inch of Steve, this position feels just as satisfying. Steve under him, solid weight between his legs and head tilted up to meet Tony, is heady. His hands are big and solid against the sides of his waist, but Tony feels in control, feels powerful. It is his decision to tilt their heads, to collapse more and more weight into Steve, to shift his hips up and down just the slightest amount.
“Be a good man and drop this down in my shop would you, Cap? You still know the code, don’t you?” He says and tosses the case to Steve, not bothering to watch if he caught it before moving towards the doorway.
“It’s points that say how smart you are, so no not exaggerating.” He insists and, yeah, this is definitely working.
“Don’t.” Steve cuts off and yanks Tony back so hard, their chests bump off each other and it’s all Tony can do to avoid colliding his chin with Steve’s forehead. It seems to shock both of them and when Tony cranes his neck to see Steve’s face his eyes are open wide. He just stares up at Tony for a long stretch, blotchy skin smoothing over into one bright shade of red.
“You’re something else, Tony.” Steve whispers into Tony’s neck, body still limp over him like the world’s most wonderful blanket.
“Not knowing something isn’t the same as being bad at it.” Stark reassures him, sentiment serious for all the teasing in his tone. It sombers Steve’s mood even more. He can tell Stark really believes it and it stirs up something in his chest. Suddenly he is that small skinny kid, looking up at Peggy and finally feeling like someone other than Bucky can see him. Someone is looking and doesn’t find him lacking. “You are practically an expert now. Anything you try, you’re good at by the end of the day.”
“Look, Cap.” Tony starts, and his hand comes up to cup Steve’s cheek. It burns and feel so sweetly perfect Steve could live in this position forever. Using the hand to guide his face up, Tony forces him to lock their gazes. He looks so wrecked, eyes brimming over and face tight in pleading sorrow. It makes Steve angry, at what he cannot be sure. “I wanted to, I did. I just–”
The A.I. immediately responds and directs Steve to the penthouse floor. The quickness startles him, but Steve just goes to the elevator and rides up without comment. When they open, he stays inside for a moment just staring out at the open living room before him. The room itself is nothing new, they’ve all been up here for a handful of dinners and little gatherings Stark put on for them. No, the thing fixing him in place is the blanket tossed over the back of the long grey sectional. It’s his missing one. He remembers pulling it over Tony’s shoulders when he fell asleep watching Star Wars. This is too much, he picked the wrong thing to focus on and he needs to leave.
Tony breathes sharply in through his nose to dislodge that persistent thought. No use in resenting an already impossible situation, there is plenty of pain to prevent from this start already.
Tony nods, yanking off the metal glove and resolutely ignoring the shiver when his arm brushes along Steve’s abs.
“Yes. And if they know anything about this…” it would be proof. Rhodey nods with clenching teeth and then turns to Tony with pure steel eyes.
It takes no time at all to make his way to another staggeringly large room with more impossibly floating screens and unnamable machines that seem more fit for the science fiction book Steve loved so much as a child.
“I’m prepared to leave the team.” Tony says suddenly and Steve snaps up to stare in shock. “Rhodey may be the militaries little yappy chihuahua, but he’s good for lending air support when you need it.”
“You sure?” The man calls out after him, reaching an arm out and moving to follow. Tony waves him off firmly and shoots over his shoulder, “Yes and sorry for not warning you about this next bit.” He ignores the “What, Tony?” called after him and moves up to the stage with forced steady steps. Obadiah moves away to give him room behind the podium, which Tony fills without so much as a glance towards the man.
JARVIS interrupts him, likely growing concerned with Steve just standing motionless and contemplating his shoes for a solid two minutes. Deciding he needs the run more than usual, Steve snaggs them and slips them on. He walks out the door without further rumination.
His body is different and the same is such strange ways that Tony is both completely comfortable and helplessly jarred in equal measure. In most ways, aside from the reinstalled arc and missing musculature, the differences are rather nice. There is a lack of grey at his temple that is natural instead of boxed and enough smooth skin instead of raised scars to feel almost naked. He completely forgot the buoyancy possible in his steps with all the aches and poorly healed fractures of superheroing and is enjoying relearning the flexibility and spring. Sure, he’ll have to re-hone the instincts and muscle memory his mind seems stuck on missing, but the number of lines taken away from the crease of his eyes and forehead seem worth the effort. If not that then at least the thickness of his hair certainly. Which, admittedly, he is ridiculous for fixating on since he was decades from going bald at 46. But, the fluff and body cannot fully be accounted for by length and he will take comfort where he damn well pleases.
“Sure, sure.” It’s a dismissal and it bites deep. Every day he floats farther and farther away.
Then Steve is kissing him, bumping their mouths together awkwardly until Tony opens his mouth to gasp. It tips into absolutely wonderful then, lips slotting together like it is their designed purpose. Tony melts, arms limp at his sides and eyes fluttering closed, giving over to the direction of Steve’s hand now at his nape. Tony feels Steve’s other arm circle all the way around his waist, feels it tighten and moans so loud into Steve’s mouth it fills the entire living room.
“Please kiss me.” Someone says and Steve obeys, leans forward without thought and presses in to catch that bottom lip between his own.
"Nrrgggh?" Steve slurs suddenly and Tony stills, holds his breath even. Then he remembers that they are both outside their beds at ungodly o’clock, so he has nothing to feel guilty or weird about.
“Captain.” He grins brightly to pull himself out of those thoughts. It’s been months since their last encounter and Tony is pretty sure they’ve both moved on. Or at least tried, if the lack of Pepper in the state of New York says anything about Tony’s personal failure on that front.
The metal door is off its hinges and clanging to the floor. Tony is pressing forward with panting breaths as the auxiliaries pulse to life. They are out into the hallway, Yinsen’s face covered by a helmeted welder’s mask. Before the door is fully settled and motionless on the floor, they are half the hallway away and moving fast. Heads and guns are moving in time and turning towards them as they continue racing down the cavern and before the first shots have a chance to go off, a blast of flames shoots from Tony’s arm. The repulsors will always be better, but damn he sort of forgets why this tool is not standard issue in all armors.
“We don’t have to keep standing here.” Steve says a good thousand years later and Tony has to blink a few times before he can understand english again. He feels his body warm a little and takes the tiny step back allowed by his close proximity to the wall. His hands trail down Steve’s chest, before flopping down to his sides. He swings them back and forth and Steve chuckles before scooping them both up in his own. As always, Tony can feel the skin of his knuckles tingle as Steve rubs his thumbs along them.
really fucking want to do this.
They don’t say much else until well after a young man comes in to announce the transport will be arriving in one hour. Things get hectic again as Tony ignores everyone pleading for him to just sit and rest and instead sets off to insure that Yinsen will be coming along with them and have absolutely no issues remaining in the U.S. for as long as the man damn well pleases.
“A kept man?” She sighs and brings up one hand to rub at her temple. It’s always down here that she remembers why backing off all those times had been a good idea.
Natasha tells him to talk to Bruce about it because this forgetfulness shouldn’t be happening with the serum. She seems worried, but tries to put him at ease and lets him complain about how weird it all makes him feel. Before he leaves she tells him she will look into any causes herself. He doesn’t tell her all of it, does not go into detail about how strange Iron Man is acting. Still, even without all the information she has the best luck at pulling on the right strings.
“Tones, is that thing still on?”
“He’s not hurt is he?” Steve asks, quickly setting aside the filled bottle and turning back towards his front door. He is not above going straight to Stark’s workshop to make sure himself. It may not be the most welcoming place, and he may have been kicked out of it on multiple occasions, but he is willing to put up with Stark’s snarking to make sure his best friend is alright. “He seemed pretty okay after the battle. I think we all made it out with minimal hits. He took off pretty quick though, so I might have mis–”
He starts towards the couch, but glances back at Steve and sees the still mostly askew hoodie and tied up sneakers. He stops and Steve bumps into him a little, clearly not paying too much attention to anything other than Tony’s back. Normally, that would give him a little thrill, a spike of adrenaline and joy, but he feels stupidly uncertain. Part of him wants to just rewind and let Steve go back to his stupid dorm room, just take a handful more kisses and call it good.
Tony can’t do anything but fling his arms up and around Steve’s neck and open up his mouth as Steve presses in. His lips feel like fire, his tongue wet and warm where it presses in along Tony’s. A moan vibrates between them, caught in the space where their chests press heavily into each other, and Tony honestly has no clue if the sourse is himself, Steve or some delicious combination of them both. Running his hands up Tony’s thighs, Steve presses him further into the metal wall, rubs his solid erection into the flat of Tony’s lower stomach.
“What happened Jarvis?” She calls out as she steps away from the door and stumbles towards them. The once soothing blur of the world seems sinister and cruel as it attempts to slow her progression.
“That’s roughly thirty acres of wilderness you’re aiming to search, Boss,” FRIDAY adds and Tony would punch her if he could, would punch every thing around him if it would somehow make Steve alright. He shouldn’t still care this much, but that is a regret he had long before Siberia. By now it seems fair to say Steve will always be the ache in his chest, will never ever let the stupid feathered hope in his chest die out completely.
“Mama, non piangere.”
“Certainly, Sir.” And boy does JARVIS sound just as confused as Pepper looks. Tony, however, feels completely justified for the outburst. He is over feeling the guy fluctuate between wonder and soul crushing nostalgia every fifteen minutes. He is done waiting for the stupid lonely asshole to reach out to him and ask for some fucking company. Jesus! He told the guy to call whenever, gave him an actual business card with his personal number written on the back and everything. What more of an invitation could the man need? An actual wax sealed hand written letter inviting him to chew Tony’s ear off whenever he needed to chat? Honestly, Tony is about two more hours of this bullshit away from doing just that.
“Okay? Was it a magical box?” Iron Man teases, but Steve feels the weariness settling back on his shoulders and can’t manage more than an amused huff in response.
“Real surprising,” Fondness leaks through the statement and the warmth of it calms the buzzing in Tony’s bones. He already feels splayed open, already feels like Steve has looked into the very core of him.
It’s clear they both know what Steve is really talking about, what he’s likely been talking about since the start of this conversation. It’s been going on for years now, since the first few weeks all of the original group were crashing in the tower. The first time was fast and rushing in its rhythm, something born of mutual frustration and too many sleepless nights. They never talked about it, still never really talk about it in more than abstract terms and innuendo. Whenever Tony is on the outs with Pepper and Steve is especially frustrated, or lonely, or some other goddamn reason Tony still can’t seem to pin down, they’ll lend each other their bodies. At least, that’s how it was in the beginning, some warmth between not really friends. Now though, now it feels like this fragile silent thing neither of them can let go. Their nights are longer and more frequent, the morning afters more languid and still they never outright say whether it matters or not. Tony half thinks Steve is punishing him and half thinks he is punishing himself. Its tortuous and beautiful and something Tony spends more time drinking about than not. He can’t stop it and can’t get the ‘more more more!’ that some possessive monster in his chest screams for everytime Steve leaves before breakfast.
Steve blinks his eyes open to see Tony standing over him, face tight in worry. He is saying something, but it takes a minute for Steve to hear it, for him to feel the way Tony is shaking his shoulders. “Steve! Steve, what is going on?”
Tony is stumbling into the communal living room after a three day inventing binge at roughly 3:30 in the morning. He just wants a nice decaf cup of hot liquid sludge before bed and the living room happens to sit between the hallway (and thus elevator doors) and the communal kitchen. (And sure he knows that his own floor has a very functional coffee machine, but the one on this floor always gets a nice undertone to it since Bruce always uses it to brew his weird herbal teas and something about the floral taste really adds to the burnt acidity Tony prefers). He is stumbling in the dark, or actually slight blue hue of the arc reactor, since he'd insisted JARVIS not bother with the overhead lights incase any teammates where about at this hours.
Trying to curl in on himself for warmth, he feels a tug in the center of his chest and reevaluates. Maybe this should be the eternal flame, a tethered hole in his chest and a red ledger he’ll never get the chance to wipe away. Seems he’ll never do enough penance, though that is not a surprise. He wants to roll and fall and let that hole rip open and away.
His hands clasp at the thick blue silk of her sides, tight enough that she can feel the pulling of the seems along the zip. Hiccups and gasps drown out the crackling of the fire beside them and she simply holds the boy and lets all the fear and sorrow spill out of her. Hysterically she feels sorry for the snot that Anna will have to wash out of the little one’s hair, but cannot stop from burying her soaking face into the dark curls. Time passes in a blur as both the terror of this revelation and the cold ice of repressed memories rack through her in tumbling, thrashing waves.
“That’s what I said, isn’t it?” Steve reassures and Tony walks the rest of the way to the bed. He does not look away as he pulls his shirt off, nor when he lets his jeans fall to the floor. There is a hunger there in Steve’s eyes, but it is shadowed over by a gentle adoration that feels more intimate than anything they’ve ever done together.
“Fuck, how long was your hand on there?” Rhodey asks after shoving the younger man’s entire arm under the spray of ice cold water. Tony is hissing at the contact and Rhodey remembers distantly something about using warm water to help the skin and twists the faucet.
“Steve, I’d date you in 100 lifetimes if I could.” Tony replies, voice gone serious and eyes boring deeply into his own. It’s the same intense look Steve’s come to long for, the one Tony fixed on him so many times these past weeks.
They are rare creatures, even rarer in North America. The chances that Stark could be one of these creatures without being on SHIELD’s list… Then it hits her and she nearly reals back at the realization.
“Oh my god, Tony.” Pepper whispers to her hands, which now hold her face. Her voice is two parts exasperation and three parts incredulity, but that’s a normal cocktail for their conversations. Tony wants to be annoyed that she would even think something like that, but well. It’s not like he didn’t think about it at least 400 times in his youth, and later in is admittedly not youth. And okay, for like the entire time he was standing next to the guy. That’s neither here nor there though, and certainly does not mean he is the ditched prom date in the scenario.
"Should you be having coffee this late?" Steve asks and even Tony can tell it is an empty platitude, something said so often his mouth is making the noises without conscious effort.
“You drive me mad, you know that?” He can’t help but say. It’s the most honest thing he’s ever said.
“You’re right,” Steve tells the now closed fridge door, his hand threatening to bend the handle. It takes a moment, long and stretching, but Steve turns back to stare him down. The sadness is back along with some impossibly deep something that pulls Tony right back into perpetual orbit.  “Can’t fault me for wanting to spend the holiday taking care of the best friend I actually know where to find.”
It’s so hot and Steve is panting into his neck, breath humid and Tony can’t help but curl into it. His hands grip hard in to Steve’s back and Steve’s just get firmer, start guiding his movement. Oh fuck, is that even better and Tony let’s him. Goes limp and shivery as Steve pushes and pulls and suddenly freezes.
“I apologize, I stepped out of the room for a moment and Master Anthony came in to have one of the biscuits.” Jarvis explains in a rush, hurrying over and dropping down to extend an arm in extra support. Maria smiles dazedly at him because the world was just starting to list a bit to the right.
Tony’s face scrunches up at that and he lets out a gasping sob. His eyes squeeze shut, but a few tears manage to peek out at the edges and Steve lifts one hand to wipe them away.
Steve is just looking at him with so much, so much
She is busy reordering a stack of papers that require the R&D head’s signature and makes it fully through the glass doors of his workshop before taking in the sight before her. For a moment she holds her breath and considers if this really merits a comment or if it should be added to the list of things Tony Stark does that should be ignored. In the end she lets the curiosity of how he’ll explain his strange positioning win out.
“And you’re gonna rectify that, being the good team captain and all?” It comes out a little biting, but Tony thinks they both need that, a little sting before they can make the same mistakes again. His voice gets a little bit louder and he lets his arm drop from where it had settled on Steve’s waist. “Can’t have a old drunk billionaire ruining this sacred day!”
“You always want to go to that same run down joint, Cap.” Tony replies with an easy grin of his own, something under his skin buzzing.
“Tony, I can’t just stay here all night.” Steve tells him, but he doesn’t sound even half convinced of that fact himself. His voice is gravelly, rough and catching at the edges. It pours like hot molasses down Tony’s body and he feels sticky sweet with the rumbling texture of it.
He may abuse that ability abit. Everytime he knocks on the workshop door though, Tony grins at him like nothing on earth will ever be better than leftover pasta and Steve. It’s the happiest he’s been in a long time. Iron Man may have been his best friend, but they never got to see each other like this; never got to spend more days together than apart and it kept them both at a distance.
Weeks pass and Steve is no closer to an answer for his problem. The oddities are starting to just feel like a part of his normal life, the little hazy memories no longer fill him with abject dread. It still makes him uneasy and he spends several hours each week going through tests with Bruce. Natasha is yet to find anything that could narrow down their searching, but she continues to look between her own missions and Avengers business. Clint teases him about going senile and Tony keeps looking at him with such intense emotion Steve always ends up looking away first.
Then the world is tilting and Steve is fucking standing up, standing straight off the couch with Tony in his arms like it is something completely normal and not at all insane. Tony’s body freezes, goes completely rigid for one insane second. Then, well, then he loses all control of every single part of his mind in one fell swoop.
“Fine, fine.” Stark manages between a few more coughs, rubbing his chest and leaning a bit into Steve’s hand. “Just, down the wrong tube.”
For a few hours, everything seems completely normal. He sits at the glass dining and work table, makes himself a mid morning smoothie and drinks it while writing up the detailed debriefing. At one point, Bruce makes his way in and sits at the table to drink some tea and chat. Steve makes a few notes on the report as they talk, listens when Bruce describes his latest experiment and laughs along at the story of Stark messing up the previous step with an ill timed interruption.
“I’m glad to see you are feeling alright, then.” Steve cuts off and he can’t help but laugh. This really is Iron Man. All this time, all those conversations, it’s been those expressions playing behind the face plate. It is gorgeous. Tony’s face is so ubsurdly expressive, like it’s trying to make up for all the time Steve spent just imagining it.
"It was really dark and so cold. I–" A deep breath in and Steve shudders– shivers –a bit as he lets it out. Tony presses impossibly closer, wishing furiously the poor circulation from the arc reactor did not make his fingertips too cold. "I know I'm not there anymore. I know it, but it's just so cold." Another shiver, but it is more subdued and Steve is resting his head on top of Tony’s and pulling their joined hands into his lap to clasp in his other.
The entire suit is motionless, not even the faint sound of mechanical whirling is breaking the silence. His face plate is focus so intently on Steve, he can practically feel them both holding their breath. “I’ve never seen it before, but I, I knew–”
“Stay,” Steve growls in response, shifting to crawl over Tony and press him down into the bed. His eyes are bright and alert when he reaches for Tony’s dick, earning a soft gasp and grown. He leans down more, settles his weight over Tony in a delicious slide of skin and nips his own path up to Tony’s ear. “Tony.”
She demands, shaking the poor boy as if somehow his lost eyes will hold the answers. He trembles as her grip tightens and though she knows she must be hurting him she cannot let go.
When they reluctantly make it to the car, Tony drops him at the passenger side again. It takes too long for them to stop grinning at each other, to untangle their fingers. When Tony slides into the driver's seat, Steve can only control himself long enough for Tony to pull out onto the street. If Tony is bothered by Steve insisting they hold hands even for the short drive back, his grin certainly does a poor job at conveying it.
The real kicker of it all, though, is for all Tony is brimming over with wants, he is also so perfectly content. He could spend the next ten years doing nothing more than laughing into a kiss with Steve. They could go the rest of their lives without Steve ever daring to dip his hand lower and Tony wouldn’t mind. If he can get nothing but these happy kisses, he honestly will be satisfied.
“I just.” And he pauses, because he wants to tell her. Really, this is Pepper, his rock, his lighthouse in the distance. If anyone could take it, Pepper would be the girl. She would probably tell him he was overreacting and to just talk to Rogers about it. Would probably not even bat an eyelash at the situation and make Tony feel like it is completely normal and something he can totally handle.
“Oh,” It’s inadequate, so horribly inadequate. Yet, Tony is absolutely certain there is no word for just how much he hates being called Steve’s best friend, how much he rejoices in even getting to matter that much to this wonderful man.  It is closing into his throat, threatening to choke him with its non-existence and Tony tries to deflect, tries to shoot a blast strong enough to knock himself free of Steve’s gravity once and for all.  “I don’t know who we should feel more sorry for, then, Cap. The team drunk, or the good captain who’s only got the team drunk to tell his sorrows to?”
“He’s gonna try to hug me.” Tony whispers to Rhodey as the car pulls up to the curb and an entire swarm of reporters. God if it wasn’t the most efficient way to get the ball rolling on this, Tony honestly would just cancel the whole thing and go to bed.
He turns away, ignoring his wet pants as he sits down at a stool and begins tilting the metal plate again. They both know she is lying, both know he isn’t looking at the metal at all.
She rolls her eyes. He loves that way too much.
“Of course.” JARVIS still sounds apologetic and Steve takes it with a tense smile.  “He sends his thanks.”
“Stop fighting,” Tony snaps, as he lowers Steve onto the surprisingly sturdy old wire frame bed someone left in here. The building is sealed off from the storm outside and a wood burning stove is positioned in the far corner with a stack of dry firewood next to it. Clearly, this place has been used recently, but the storm will buy them some security from the official owners.
He is uniformed and on the common balcony just as Iron Man blasts up from the workshop floors to meet him. The sounds of the Quinjet starting lets them know the others will be following close behind, so they waste no time in assuming their usual flight position and taking off to meet the latest threat.
“How so?” He finally asks and Steve shakes himself for those oddly specific thoughts.
“I’m fine. I’m- I’ll be fine.” Steve finally answers and forces himself to close the box. It makes it somewhat easier to stand up, to place it gently where he found it. Maybe if he thinks hard enough it will disappear.
His hands are red, eyes blurring. “It’s going to be fine. Rhodey is coming. Just hold on, just hold on, come on.” The belt is in place and Tony is ripping off the leather cuffs around his upper arm, dropping them and moving Yinsens leg into the cradle created by their previous curling. Again no hesitation, grunting and whimpering as he ties the makeshift gauze tight with string and old striped fabric. “We did so good. We are so close, I don’t-” Tony’s own gasping enters the fray, but he is standing and pulling off the leather around his knees. He is padding the largest plate of metal he can find and ripping at the exposed wiring at the arms of mach U2.1. “I don’t want to do this again, please Yinsen. We can, we can make it.” His voice is high and wobbly, but he ties the tangling braid of wires to the top end of the metal. “Hold on.”
“He’s alive.” He confirms, voice wavering before he coughs and lets out a long breath. “Looks like shit and the storms picked up enough that I can’t fly him out of here like this. It’ll be a day or two before you can pilot in here either.”
“Camera. JARVIS can get in anywhere.” He cuts off, not wanting to hear the end of that question. Rogers is filling with awe and relief, like he knows Tony is calling because he knew the guy was feeling lonely, knew his recent outburst were making him nervous and wanted to lend some comfort. It may be true, but well, Pepper is still here and honestly, even if she wasn’t Tony still wouldn’t want any of that acknowledged.
“If you’re not ready, it’s okay.” Steve rushes out then, looking Tony in the eye like he is half a second away from giving a lecture on enthusiastic consent. “I like just kissing you, too.”
“Try me?” She prods, gently and with that lovely little grin. It feels so good to be back to this place with her. After everything with the palladium and his less than stellar life choices, he sort of expected there to always be a wall up between them. He lied, kept so much from her and somehow she is still here, smiling at him with all that care of their long years together. It’s so different than what he feels joking around and fighting with Rhodey, but the love he has for her is just as strong, just as permanent and loyal.
The world is a mess, so much of which he made with his own two hands. Although he never really cared much for manners, it still feels wrong to leave the party without at least throwing out his own garbage. There is a laundry list of things he wants to fix, people he needs to care for and protect, wrongs to undo. But oh, is he tired. He has been so tired for so long and this just feels like finally finding a bed comfortable enough to close his eyes and not have to dream.
“Sure.” She says on a sigh, moving to tidy up the papers Tony had scattered earlier. Tony smiles at her, but feels himself stiffen when Rogers cuts everything off to start projecting surprise into their bond. It takes another entire ring before he answers and the whole thing is so agonizing, Tony almost has JARVIS hang up.
But, Tony will save him. Of course he will. Tony will save him and eat any guilt for the pain Yinsen will surely have to face gladly. Yinsen is too good a man, too good a friend for Tony not to be selfish.
“What?” Pepper starts, shaking her head as if to clear out the fog that must be covering up Tony’s motivations. She looks at him for a long moment, in which Tony just pants out large frustrated breaths. His shoulders are heaving up with the movement, his hands clenched into fists at his side to stop himself from throwing things at the wall. When he feels Rogers’ mood shift over into worry, he groans loud and long before wiping a hand over his face. Of course the guy can feel the unrelenting frustration rolling off of him.
“Not at the moment,” is all he gets in return and he feels a little spike of anxiety dig its way under his ribcage. Iron Man did take off pretty fast after making sure everyone was alright. Steve usually berated him into admitting at least some of his injuries, but the battle had been standard, so he’d let him go without the usual questioning. It felt like maybe that had been a huge mistake.
It started slowly, the morning after their conversation they’d both only managed to stay in the same room for about ten minutes. Still, making coffee for Tony and watching him smile around the mug filled him with so much warmth he started making a batch on the communal floor everyday. Those first few days consisted mostly of not talking about the elephant in the room and simultaneously avoiding and seaking each other out. It probably would have kept going like that for weeks if not for Clint.
“Anthony!” Jarvis’ voice is strangled around the name and Maria’s whole body clenches tight in panic. Before any decision can be made she is up, tumbling herself out of the room and over the shattered remains of a glass on the hardwood floor. The sounds of running water and a child sniffling draw her quickly to the light spilling from the kitchen. It is a room she barely knows, but the sound of her child crying forces down any awkwardness in the unfamiliar surroundings.
“JARVIS, find me Captain America!” Tony yells out of nowhere, throwing his hands up in frustration and scattering various papers in his wake. Pepper stares at him with wide eyes, completely caught off guard. It makes sense, Tony knows, since they were literally in the middle of a discussion about the surprisingly limited structural damage done to the lower fifty two floors.
“One more.” He replies, because tests are stupid and Steve is so very good at kissing and it is just ridiculous that Tony might be deprived this. He said the same thing earlier, but as always Steve doesn’t call him out on it. He just smiles, soft and silky smooth against Tony’s upper lip. It tingles, makes Tony shiver a bit and how had he ever kissed anyone else.
“I’m right fucking here.” Rhodey insists, waving his hands to draw Tony’s attention back to him and away from remembering how dumb he’d looked when falling out of that very stool an hour ago. The waving turns out to be a horrible idea and Rhodey finds himself pitching forward and flat onto his stomach, face half on one of the gross pancakes.
One observation does not prove a hypothesis. He is a scientist and the scientist longs for data. Yinsen doesn’t have to pull him to his feet, but does try to grab him when Tony lunges forward.
Humming, Tony can hear the man humming clearly. The thin mattress under his shoulder does nothing to cover the sharp metal of the bed frame and that is so sharply familiar. It’s playing out exactly as it should, but he feels too aware, able to decide his own movements more than unconsciousness usually allows. Everything is in such sharp focus. This can’t be a dream, the dampness in this bones is too heavy. Nothing but being wide awake feels like this. He wants to laugh, cry even. He died, finally died and this is what was waiting behind the curtain all this time.
He is nervous and Steve can’t believe he couldn’t hear it in his voice before. For years he had only the modulated tones to go on, but that never stopped him from coming to understand his Shellhead nearly as well as he understood himself. Tony is nervous, is scared and trying to act like he is completely in control.
“Well,” Steve starts, smirking when Tony swallows at the suddenly deeper tone of his voice. “if you’re gonna be like that about it-”
Steve’s hand feels amazing, palms silky smooth and fingers calloused from all his sketching and painting. Even with his eyes closed Tony would know that hand anywhere, can remember running his fingers along those knuckles and it makes it all so much better. Steve is jerking him off.
"I–" It hurts, the noise. It hurts how tenderly Steve is looking at him. Like all of it is okay, sad and terrible, but okay.
"Then. Next time.” A nod and his smile wobbles just the smallest amount. “Next time you come find me too. Okay?"
“Stark?” Tony looks up from examining his still full glass of scotch, his sixth of the night, and sees Steve leaning against the bar next to him. Damn does he look good, pale skin off set by the low red lights in this section of the party. It contrasts perfectly with his rich green dress shirt and grey slacks. He looks like the cover of some risque and vaguely holiday themed calendar. Tony can’t decide if its made better or worse by the fact that he knows exactly how that partially exposed collarbone tastes.
“I don’t see you naming anything that contradicts me.” Stark says and Steve shakes his head to get out of such maudlin thoughts. He can make up for it now, he can be the cause of that happy grin instead of someone believing it only comes with ulterior motives. He can open up himself and be genuine in a way he’s been avoiding since that first day.
Maria Stark first thinks her son carries the curse when he is four years old. She sits in the library, flipping uselessly through an old book and sipping on her fifth glass of wine. The world is starting to fuzz around the edges in a pleasant sleepy sort of way that eases her mind into a blessed silence. Dragging a deep red nail up the length of the tattered page, she hooks it lightly and flips without having a single idea of the information on the previous one. She moves to repeat the soothing rhythm after another swallow of rich red when a loud insistent clattering thunders in from somewhere in the hallway.
The only thing on earth Tony can do in response is crash into him with all the passion of a freight train, barreling off the rails and over the edge of a cliff.
“Tony.” Rhodey chides, but the tension in his arm is rolling off in over protective waves that really contradict any exasperated note in his voice. Behind them he hears Obadiah boasting to the crowd like a carnival barker, “hey, look who is here!”
“No.” Tony cuts in sharply, reaching for the leather once more. It is only a matter of time before someone comes in to get Rhodey or tell them about the jet scheduled to transport them back to California. He decides to leave the papers where they are, loath to draw Rhodey’s attention to them. They gave him a bag along with the change of clothes anyways, he can keep them close still.
