isn’t something he does these days, though he promises himself immediately that it will be— “or to see if he wanted to come train with me or—or help me with my chemistry homework.”
This is it. Everything is going according to plan. Tony will become a martyr to Registration. Steve hates him now, but this is how it has to be. At least this way, Steve won’t miss him when he’s gone.
Steve throws the bowling ball—just throws it, like it’s a beachball—across the room and in one motion grabs the guy in the purple hat, flipping him onto his back with a growl.
No sooner does the inferno pour forth than Victor speaks again, voice low as perdition, and the ground quakes. The earth under their boots bucks like a hurricane deck. Tony nearly falls off his feet; even Victor exerts real effort to remain upright. The sand pulses outward in circles, the ripples knee-high if they’re an inch.
Tony leans against the inside of Steve’s door frame, hip jutting distractingly to one side. “I would’ve told you if I was flaking,” he says, watching Steve hunt through his piles of dirty laundry and stacks of paper.
Steve goes back to work. He answers no questions about his restored strength and youth. He worries that everyone guesses—or knows—how he got it, but he can’t tell if there’s any evidence of that or he’s just paranoid.
The man with bare hands steps in closer, a leering smile on his face, leaning in so his breaths come hot and harsh in Tony’s ear, and this is where Steve wants them both.
Tony scrubs a hand over his face. Of course he is. “Add to the list, please: look into limiting the data passed on by the nanite network.”
Deals 3475 damage, plus 190 for each Team Cap Escalation tile, or 235 per tile if target is Team Iron Man, or 300 per tile if target is Iron Man.
“Thanks.” Steve didn't know that, or not in so many words. It makes a kind of sense. His decision to ask Tony had been less about bravery and strategy and more about embarrassing levels of loneliness and sexual desperation, but there’s no need to tell Sam that.
"Do—does the team need me?" he asks instead, because even when his friends hate him, they'll do what's necessary to help people. Even if it means involving Tony.
Likewise, Tony—who, while completing PHDs in mathematics, engineering, and physics, incidentally also completed the requisite coursework for a masters in statistics—insisted that the timing of the sorceress lifting the spell and that of his kiss with Steve were pure coincidence, and that no conclusions could be drawn from this correlation.
Steve hasn’t seen the three strangers since the night Honton died. He doesn’t think for a minute that they’re gone, though.
I have x-ray diffraction and fluorescence analyses. The chemical structure of the paint matches what would’ve been around at the turn of the 17th century. I’ve also got UV and infrared breakdown if you want to look at older layers. I’ll give you guys all the readings I have on it, of course.”
Steve lets himself be led, feeling a bit lost. It’s not long, though, before he forgets to worry, because he and Tony are bickering over a racing game, and then they’re laughing, and then Tony’s hand is over his, trying to wrest a joystick out of his grasp, boasting about how he’s going to kick Steve’s ass in the next round, just wait and see, Cap.
Converts chosen tile into a 3-turn Countdown tile. Countdown Tile deals 420 damage when it reaches 2, 780 when it reaches 1, and 940 when it reaches 0.
Future divisions, Steve repeats to himself. What a way to run a—whatever it is. Organization or branch of government or bureaucracy.
The frenetic crowd swells into a screaming swarm. There’s blood in Steve’s eyes, obscuring his vision, and he’s disoriented, from falling and from the bullets that knocked him over—but he knows what the burst of red and gold approaching him is, and he knows it’s Sharon who’s screaming his name. Then red and gold is all he can see; Tony crouches over him, pinning and shielding him. The sniper is still firing. Bullets strike the armor, then fall harmlessly to the ground.
Like knives, expectations can be used to wound quite effectively even when used by someone who has never even seen a knife before. A novice with knives can still drive one into the bowels of an unwitting opponent, spilling their intestines and bringing on a slow and painful death. An emotionally stunted person who claims to have no expectations of anyone but himself can still be brutally hurt and disappointed when he learns a friend has neglected to pass on information of particular personal importance to him.
a big deal, Steve—god, this is perfectly clear, I am completely sure of what we’re trying to say right now—”
Tony snarls and slams his weight forward, his hands gripping Steve’s arms, their chests flush together as he pins Steve under him. “Then I’ll
Steve hauls Tony into his lap, his arms tight around Tony’s back. He buries his face in Tony’s shoulder. “Don’t—can—did you ever—you and me” —he doesn’t know what he’s saying, his words are broken up by hiccuping sobs— “did you—did you ever think—”
“Please,” Tony says, panting, internally reviewing the helicarrier’s security footage from the past week. He needs to know what Steve’s been up to. What Steve’s going to ask him for. “Tell me what you want. Let me make you feel good.” There are so many vulnerabilities in the helicarrier’s systems. He’ll have a bounty of opportunities to disable or destroy it when he needs to. “Thank you for giving me this chance. I’ll do whatever you want, whatever Hydra needs me to. You’ll see.”
As if summoned by Steve’s thought, Tony walks into view across the room, catches sight of Steve, and lifts an arm to flag him down.
The nightmare will be over. His part is done. Registration will only gain more support after his death. Dying was always part of the plan. He thought it would be in a fight; Steve doesn’t kill, after all. No, he leaves that to his friends. In the confusion of battle, maybe no one would be sure how Tony died, who was responsible. Maybe no one would have to bear the burden of being his executioner. But Steve volunteered, and maybe it’s better this way. Steve will be the last thing Tony sees.
Tony shakes his head. He startles when Steve’s bare fingertips brush over his eyelids. He blinks them open, not knowing when he closed them. One of Steve’s gloves is on the floor. This can’t be happening, not now, when Tony’s so thoroughly ruined them.
Getting to know the different types of lies and the motivations of liars is like getting to better know someone with whom you are already deeply, childishly in love: every time you think there is nothing more to learn, a new surprise sweeps you off your feet.
“Well,” Lieutenant Gonzales says, glancing between them and getting to her feet, “I think you two have a lot to think about. I’ll leave you to it. We’ll reach Frontier Outpost 12 in just over ten hours. You have quarters on the passenger deck. If you need anything, the ship’s computer can direct you anywhere you’d like to go, answer your questions, or get you in contact with me, if you prefer. Enjoy your evening.”
“‘When the time comes, the world will still need heroes. It will still need you. And when the fighting is over and history is written, I can only hope we will be remembered as more than just heroes.’” The letter’s almost over. In a matter of seconds, Steve will go back and sit beside Jen, and if he’s lucky, his mind will shut down again. “‘I hope that we will be remembered as I will always remember us: as friends.’”
It’s hours past suppertime, if Tony’s belly is any guide, though the contents of his pack seem none too appetizing and he doesn’t think he’d keep down even the finest of fare if he ate it in this place. The corridors beyond the gate throb with the same uncanny pulse and corkscrew down in the same dim spiral, but the further he goes, the higher the temperature and humidity rise. He slaps at a mosquito on reflex, and isn’t surprised to hear its brethren buzzing in his ears.
There aren’t as many gifts as Steve expected. A lot of people must’ve just brought bottles of alcohol or snacks to share with the whole party.
“Right,” Tony says, his voice gone sharp. He settles a hand on Steve’s shoulder and starts guiding him toward the arcade, like it was his idea. His smile is wider than ever. “Then let’s go to the arcade.”
His mind is difficult to distract. Without missing a single word Tony’s speaks, it’s still too easy to seethe and brood, plan a dozen different discreet routes away from the mansion, listen for footsteps, tires, or voices—to imagine his own voice launching out of him and shattering over Tony’s body and incinerating every selfish lie and secret and betrayal. Each consideration occupies a track of his thoughts, alongside the runaway train of
Dragonflies and damselflies join the mosquitos, their lacy fairy-wings beating the air in tandem, bodies a plump, poisonous-looking red. He pulls his boot out of the mud with a squelch and sees that a dragonfly the size of his fist has landed on his shoulder.
He’s nearly to the door. A voice he knows he should recognize says, “I'm glad you called everyone out, Rogers, so you can say goodbye.”
Steve could ask how Tony knew he was hurt, how he knew where to look, how he was able to arrive in time. He knows Tony won’t answer. “I—you didn’t have to come yourself.”
is running on fumes, and is barely a safe distance from the newborn star when the ship’s instruments alert them to the imminent arrival of three more Star Culler ships.
Steve doesn’t speak. Every second that passes is another second for Steve to decide to move. To attack.
Delighting in Tony’s confusion puts an ugly grin on Steve’s face, but at least it masks his own desperation. Anger is safer. Anger is all Tony deserves.
The last time Steve thought an elevator moved too slowly it was 1944, so this one is probably moving at normal speeds for the compound—which is to say, faster and smoother than any elevators commercially available outside of Wakanda—but it definitely doesn’t feel like it.
What is special is certain lies from certain people. Sometimes the right lie, at the right time, can mean the world.
Consciousness returns swaddled in oppressive layers of cotton; Tony's mouth is dry, and when he opens his eyes, those are dry too. In his peripheral vision he catches Steve snatching his arm away, like he'd had his hand beside Tony's and has drawn it back now that Tony's awake. But Steve's here, like he said he would be, and even though Tony has to turn and tilt his neck awkwardly to keep Steve in view properly, he thinks Steve almost looks happy to see him.
“No,” Steve says, panicking, before he realizes that Tony’s made no move to leave, or even stand up. “I—can we start over?”
Thirty-six hours before Dr. Strange was scheduled to return to his home dimension, Steve turned to Tony and said, “Wait, so, do you know where Dr. Suresh went?”
Steve grabs Tony by the hair and jerks him up, forcing Tony to face him. In his other hand is a Cosmic Cube.
Sunlight strikes Tony’s gilded skin and ricochets off in dazzling brightness. “What are you waiting for?” he sneers, or sounds like he’s trying to; this close all Steve can concentrate on are the bruises under his eyes.
When they want a less open-ended game, they pull a piloting simulation for a spaceship the shape of a pineapple. Then a collaborative murder-mystery-solving game, followed by a game of scrabble played on the surface of a holographic moon. Tony insists they try the oil-painting simulator, even though it just ends up being him watching and praising Steve as he makes messy underpaintings on a holographic canvas. The NMAT provides hot drinks and sweet sticky rice buns, and they play and explore until they can’t lift their arms and fall asleep piled together on Steve’s bed, surrounded by the calls and flights and fiery breaths of dragons the size of songbirds.
“That’s it,” Tony says, thinking of holding the Gems under his command and what he imagined and didn’t imagine, all that he imagined he didn’t.
which stayed in the same ranges the whole time, some going up or down a little, but overall nothing too different from the readings we get from the Sanctum Sanctorum or Haunted Stark Mansion sometimes
y’all, it was the only thing from home I was able to take with me—it had a broad, all-encompassing kinda sentimental value. Unlike you and Tony Stark, who you look at like if you’re a really good boy, he might take you out for walkies later.”
“No,” Steve says, animosity leaking out of him like flour from a burst sack. “I don’t expect it will.”
, like a sonic weapon. Unwary Skrulls fall under the dinosaur’s tremendous feet; others fly or roll away. The whirl of brightly-colored costumes matches the vivid flowers and fleeing birds of the jungle.
Tony strides forward and wraps an arm around Steve’s back as tendrils of silver-white armor circle toward Tony like satellites losing orbit. The armor crawls over him, a snake shedding its skin in reverse, and when his jet-boots kick in he lifts Steve with him. Steve dangles in Tony’s grip, a dead weight, as Tony locks his mouth onto Steve’s and forces it open with his tongue.
His eyes slide away from Steve’s, landing on the wall behind Steve’s bed. He tilts his head so his sunglasses catch the light and the rosy glass turns to a glare of impenetrable white. He uncrosses his legs, crosses them the opposite direction, wriggles his hips, crosses his legs back the way they were. “Hey Pep, y’know what, my lunch date is here, can I call you back in a couple hours? Okay, four and three-quarters hours, how’s that? Yeah. Yeah. You too. I will. Bye.”
Later, after a hearty meal, several orgasms, a shared shower, and a couple hours of reading in bed, Tony sleeps, Steve snoring faintly beside him. The snow falling against the windows follows him into his dream. The town of Pleasant Hill is inside of a soap bubble. A little girl watches him. She smiles and waves shyly when she sees him notice her. The world gleams glossy pink and lavender, a miniature rainbow refracting across the surface of the soap bubble. A splash of iridescence against concrete. An oil slick and a sickly-sweet smell. The static snow of an old, detuned television set.
It’s fine, Tony. We’re just getting started anyway. Meet us in the stacks by the globe room. ::upside-down smiley-face::
If Tony’s smile on waking up was a lightning flash, this one is a storm blowing away to reveal a noonday sun. “Well of course,” Tony replies, and Steve grins back so wide his cheeks are already sore. “
He picks up where he and Steve left off: talking to people who might have seen or heard something. He speaks with Missus Knight, Miss Jones, and young Rick Jones (no relation), who know a few things about that accursed book. The next evening Tony walks into Nodding's saloon and smiles at Neppie. She smiles back and flounces up to him, murderous rumors apparently forgotten. Good thing, too: she and the other dancers pick up more about Timely’s comings, goings, and goings-on than you can shake a stick at. They'll know more than anyone else what's happened since the night Red Wolf was almost killed. They point him in the direction of one Thornton Tillard.
Tony's heart clenches. He can certainly draw conclusions from a question like that. "We were in DC," he says, watching Steve's face. "You were with Spider-Man and I was fighting Carol." He swallows; it's an unpleasant sensation in his dry throat. "That's not right, is it?"
That’s what a friend should do, right? Enjoy seeing his teammate so thrilled, so awestruck. There will be plenty of time, later, to deal with the consequences. Too much time, really.
Tony expects to feel the press of Steve’s cock against his hole at any moment, but it doesn’t come. Instead Steve’s hand brushes occasionally brushes Tony's ass as if accidental, incidental.
In the morning he takes the light-rail on full loops of its route. Its resemblance to New York’s subways are superficial at best. The train lurches and shudders, but he stays standing, not needing to hold a railing to keep his footing. The sound of it hurtling along its track is louder than a Kree warship—and positively quiet compared to the banshee wail it makes each time it turns a corner. It renders Steve’s thoughts inaudible.
Wormseed is getting into a rip-snorting row with old Virgle Groslin, a trader in fine and unusual goods who’s in and out of Timely every fortnight with new trinkets to peddle. They’re getting into it, Virgle raising a ruckus and Wormseed holding himself stiller than molasses in January.
“I don’t think it’s a good idea” —Tony barks his not-laugh again— “but—but I’m really glad you’re here.”
Today it’s nearing evening when Steve’s done. He stops by the dram shop and Stark is full as a tick. He sings through hiccups and guffaws as Steve walks him back to his forge. When they reach it, Stark lets himself in, still singing, giving no sign he even knows Steve is there.
Tony snakes a hand down Steve’s side to his ass, curling his hand so his fingers are in Steve’s crease. Steve shivers. “No,” he promises.
Steve lifts it by its shoulders and slams the back of its head against the wall. It collapses, eyes falling shut like a doll’s.
Determined to, at least once, find him before he’s corned, Steve lets himself into Stark’s forge before noon. He seems a bit down with barrel fever, but he’s upright and working when Steve comes inside.
—but he doesn’t, he’s never seen this woman before today, he shouldn’t know her voice, it shouldn’t make his blood run cold with dread, he shouldn’t know it well enough to recognize it when she says,
“Cap,” Maria had replied, “anyone with sense has given up on you looking like you even know what a facial expression is, let alone an emotion.”
Steve sits at cafes and at parklets and on the damp sand of Ocean Beach. He tells himself he likes looking unremarkable. He walks to the Sutro Baths, decides he doesn’t want to embarrass himself by falling over in the ruins, and finds a nice rock to sit on instead. He drinks hand-brewed kombucha, matcha ginger lattes with oat milk, and coconut water. He pays for everything with cash, including his motel room.
“Sure don’t,” Missus Knight agrees. In altogether another tone of voice, she says, “You see Mister Stark, you tell ‘im I’ve made some improvements to the arm.” She taps at her mechanical prosthetic with her flesh hand. “Off you go now, Sheriff. I don’t want any of that trouble showing its face here, nor the rumors we’ll be hearin’ about if you’re seen goin’ in and out of my home on your lonesome.”
“What? Why not?” Are there special billionaire cheese knives? Or maybe 21st-century ones Steve doesn’t know about? Probably not the latter, at least, because if there were a known way to improve something metal and analog by adding lasers or hard light holograms or an AI, Tony would’ve been the one to figure it out, and all of campus—and by extension Steve—would know all about it.
A week after being cleared by the compound’s medical team and given federal permission to stay on the grounds for the time being, James joined the team to eat pizza and watch “West Side Story.”
“Rogers—” a voice starts from the front, before it’s cut off by a thundering shot and the sound of a man falling to the floor with a groan.
By the time Steve makes it to his suite he’s so hard it hurts and he can’t think of anything but the toy stuffed into his jacket. He’s half undressed when he reaches his bedroom, his pants, belt, jacket, socks, and shoes a trail behind him like fairytale breadcrumbs. He reverently sets the toy on his bed. He means to take the rest of his clothes off and find his lube, but he can’t take his eyes off the thing. It’s perfect. It’s real. And Steve talked to Tony about it—god, the way he spoke to Steve undid him, gentle and straightforward. Trying to show Steve it was no big deal.
Steve’s steps are light, whisper-quiet. His slow pace is a self-indulgence; the longer he drags it out, the longer he has to hope. For now, the possibilities are infinite. Tony could be planning to apologize.
“This is me taking what’s mine,” Steve growls. “Isn’t that what you always wanted, Tony? To be mine?”
On seeing him, Natasha—careful not to lower her weapon or let her guard down—said, “James?” Her voice was a step louder than she’d intended.
He thinks he sees Stark’s eyes land on the ‘64 Stark Rifle hanging above the bar before he takes another swig.
There’s a strategy meeting the next day, going over what they know about AIM and their plans—which isn’t much, but at least now everyone’s on the same page. Natasha, Peggy, and Coulson report on the intel they’ve gathered, then Tony talks them through his analysis of AIM’s last video transmission.
Steve does. He watches Tony soar and dive and fly loop-de-loops like he was rained out of the sky instead of born.
"I have to go." Steve stands all at once, with a speed he usually reserves for battle. "I know you have a lot of questions, and I'll try to answer them." Once, Steve would've followed that by reminiscing about the questions Tony answered for him when he first came out of the ice. Instead there's a beat where such a memory could be spoken aloud, and isn't. "I'll be here the next time you wake up. I promise."
“Well,” Tony says, tilting his helmeted head as he looks around the room, “if this is a supervillain lair, it’s much nicer than our usual fare.”
A tingling sensation tiptoes up Steve’s spine. Tony’s eyes remind him of pouring maple syrup onto a stack of challah French toast.
It’s the day after Tony’s funeral. Steve would be surprised by how quickly time has gone by, if he had the capacity to do so.
“So we call Tara. Hammer and Stone already don’t trust each other, so she and Alec and Stark can do the Soft Shoulder or—”
Steve read sitting up in bed, wearing his winter coat, paperback balanced on his knees, illuminated by the night sky and the neon deli sign. Instead of his patched and mostly intact gloves, he wore an old pair he’d saved despite its irreparable holes; an opening on his index finger allowed him the dexterity to turn the pages of his book. He’d doze off now and then, but couldn’t escape the chill that cut through wool straight to his bones.
so I had to cover for this guy like “oh I was just working on some armor upgrades when we started traveling through the multiverse”
“Lemme—” Tony tries to say, but Steve shifts his weight so Tony can’t find his feet. Steve covers his mouth with one hand and drives against him harder than before. He hoists Tony higher by one hip, so that Tony’s feet scrabble to find purchase, while Steve boxes him in with his legs and weight, keeping his thighs pressed tight around Steve’s cock.
“Might I?” Tony wonders. He doesn’t carry his wrist piece anymore, but he has a knife up his sleeve instead. It’s warm in his palm; not fever-hot like the book, but familiar and solid, like a river rock left on a sunny windowsill.
Their feet crunch over frost-tipped grass. The fog is so thick that it obscures the outline of the gazebo barely twenty yards away. “If you’re a dragon,” Tony says, “then I guess I’ll have to put on my shining armor and defeat you.”
“Uh, yes, nothing straight about it, and I better not be getting a shovel speech from you, because, given our history—I mean, wow,
“I think this one is like a cheeseboard,” Tony says, spreading a creamy violet something onto a something-else that looks like steamed flatbread. “See, this stuff is fermented, this is some kind of jam or chutney, I think these are the fruits from that ocean moon the computer was saying are kind of like apples, and this is a little charcuterie section.”
Steve lifts his hand to the back of Tony’s head. The undersuit instantly dissolves from Tony’s neck up. Steve tugs off his other glove with his teeth and combs Tony’s hair between his fingers.
The only sign of snow is the frost forming small spiderweb cracks in the corners of shop windows and the wet sound of tires. Mayor Hill and Dr. Selvig are across the street, standing very close as they speak; not like they’re intimate, but like they’re speaking in hushed voices. Dan from the scrapyard drives by, his pickup loaded with salvage, waving as he passes.
“Yes,” Tony says immediately. He doesn’t want to compromise. He’s right, he believes in this. But this is unsustainable, and if there’s any other way, a way where Steve doesn’t fight him, he’ll find a way to swallow his pride.
Hydra’s systems have no defense against a technopath. By the time Steve’s pulled Tony into a kiss, Tony has full control of the helicarrier and its security systems. He lets Steve guide their mouths and then their bodies, lays back and lets Steve run his hands over Tony’s freshly healed skin. Tony schools his expression into one of delight and awe. It’s easy to replicate the pitiful gratitude and wonderment of his past, lesser self.
Steve watches in growing rage as his closest friend in this century betrays him again and again, attacking and imprisoning their friends, destroying the very freedom Steve thought they’d been fighting for.
It is. It really is. There’s no reason for Steve to be upset. Of course Tony is enjoying this more than he is; Tony’s the futurist, after all. Steve’s the one who’s already woken up decades in the future.
“I’m bringing Fisk to justice,” Red Wolf says, sounding so like Steve it hurts. “Banner and Natasha are blowing up the dam and saving my people.”
Another day, when Natasha and Steve were drilling Tony and Wanda in martial arts techniques, Steve rolled his eyes at a remark of Tony’s and said, “Some of us have better things to do than ogle your ass, Stark.”
“Your faces are, like, the only thing visible on the magazine stands,” Parker says. “You beat out a poorly behaved British royal and a guy in Florida who got in a footrace through a cattle field trying to escape local deputies.”
It doesn't have to mean what Tony wants it to mean. But, if nothing else, Steve wants to work together.
“Well, what did you have in mind? Can’t be my soul, I’m afraid it’s already spoken for.” Tony tries not to shift under the scrutiny he receives upon saying this. He wonders if the not-horse knows he accidentally punched a thoroughbred in the face not long ago. “I hope it won’t offend if I offer you an apple; a friend of mine, who looks much like you, enjoys them immensely.”
“Then you can see how he feels then,” Bucky says brightly, like this is a solution that in no way could result in Tony ending his friendship with Steve. Again. “And if he seems weird, just ask him about it. You guys can work it out.”
If the target is a member of Team Iron Man, deals 72 damage per tile. If the target is Iron Man himself, deals 95 damage per tile.
“Why did I agree to this interview?” Steve scowls at the list of questions he’s been asked to review.
Steve’s heart soars at the way Tony picks up and settles in like their last words to each other were only seconds ago. Picking up where they left off. Some things, like this, have always come so easily to them.
“Tony,” Steve says, raising his voice. “I didn’t mean it like that,” he goes on, more quietly, speaking carefully and over-enunciating as a result. “You have every reason to not want to see me. To be angry with me.”
“What can I do to help?” Tony asks when the conversation gives him an opening. “You don’t have to give me details, but there must be something I can do, for the survivors of Vegas, or—”
The man straightens up and frowns at Steve. Probably he's realized that he and Stark have been having their row in the middle of the street and happened upon by the town sheriff. “Honton,” he replies.
Tony’s stomach flips and they aren’t walking away from the cafe, they’re standing in front of the town museum, and Mayor Hill is chatting pleasantly with Steve.
Tony’s heart is entirely organic, now, beating under its own power, but his mind is digital. His thoughts are on/off, yes/no, positive/negative, hope/hopeless.
all the doors and windows of the timeless archives disappeared and my friends are trapped in there and i was hoping you could kick open some kind of portal or something and help get them out?
They’re halfway to Apple when Red Wolf says, “What'll we do with the silver? We're not sending it along to Governor Roxxon.”
Like when the other Steve talked about other Tony it was like Iron Man was sad it wasn’t him, and when the other Steve talked about the other Iron Man it was like Tony was sad it wasn’t *him*.
Steve pressed his lips against Tony’s. Their mouths parted against each other. Tony reached out and stuck his fingers in Steve’s hair, tugging him closer.
“Did you mean it?” Steve asked, making Tony bristle. “When you said you would trust me, and what I decided. Did you mean it?”
He shrugged. Natasha had always thought him beautiful. Jagged, with a hint of violence, like a spider web pattern left by a bullet in glass—and all the more compelling for it, rather than despite it. He tucked a strand of hair behind one ear. “Does it matter?”
Tony looked Steve in the eye and said, “I had pancakes and tea for breakfast. Um? I was trying to say that.”
If he pulls out one of the IVs, an alarm will go off on one of the machines monitoring him. That's usually enough to bring a medical professional in, to check that he's getting enough of whatever fluids or medications he's been prescribed. There's probably a computer somewhere that monitors that sort of thing, even if the beeping isn't audible to anyone nearby. Should he take one out? He has no way of knowing what drugs they’re piping into him, or how much. Maybe he can jostle one enough to set off the machines, and then reinsert it himself.
Steve finds Tony on a lounge chair wearing a tiny red bathing suit. The lenses of his sunglasses are tinted a matching crimson; the thin metal frames are gold. The sun is bright enough that Tony’s closed eyelids are visible through the tinted lenses.
Sorry, there’s not going to be any hot tub cuddling in this fic. In case you were getting your hopes up. (There will be clothed cuddling!)
“No. I—Tony.” It makes sense, given the last events Tony can remember, but it means not only did Tony die for Steve thinking Steve hated him, but he came to Steve last night ready to die for him again. Steve starts to reach for Tony, then drops his hand, unsure of his welcome. “That was more than a year ago. You—your death gave me some perspective.” He chews on his lips. “And your letter.”
He just—knowing it was coming doesn’t make this easy. It’s one thing for Steve to stick to impractical ideals, to attack what he doesn’t understand, to assume the worst of Tony. That’s—it’s awful, and frustrating, because Tony still fucking believes in this, in accountability and structure and keeping it from being an absolute slaughter, and at the moment he can’t quite see how that means he has to die.
It feels good to have Tony’s arms around him, nestled against his back. “I’ll make you a new one,” Tony vows as they canter off. “A bigger, brighter star. Bulletproof.”
“Of course,” Tony says, tipping his teacup across the table as if this is an ordinary reply. Jessica Jones had called it the Book of Sins, though it doesn’t look big enough to hold all of Tony’s.
“I need you,” Steve says, opening his eyes to find Tony’s expression a reflection of his own. “I can’t do this, any of this, without you.”
Either way, there is much that can be gleaned from the shape and absence of snow, whether it’s the shadows cast on the blank canvas nature has provided or the impressions left by hooves and combat boots and paws and frostbitten bare feet.
He follows Steve to the door, and watches out of his peripheral vision as Steve punches a code into a keypad by the door. The sequence is just nine characters long, but there are both letters and numbers; there’s a lot of room for error, and without concentrating on it, Tony can’t be sure he has all of it right.
Steve smiled and took Tony’s hand. “Hey, you know how in fairy tales, true love’s kiss will break a witch’s spell?”
When he lands, the soles of his boots are on pale gray pavement, the sky has taken on a cyan cast, and Steve has an arm around his shoulders. “—deciding how to celebrate our anniversary,” Steve is saying.
It’s like Tony never found him, like Steve died decades ago, alone in the ice, like Tony doesn’t even see it’s Steve he’s been fighting with. Tony’s not talking about him but some distant, infallible paragon. He’d think Steve such a child if he knew that for all these years, Steve thought he’d really meant something to Tony.
For a bit, Tony takes part in the conversation. Steve just lets the voices wash over him. He’s drunk enough, or tired enough, or both, to not care that he’s awake and bored. Tony starts out gesturing widely with his hands, but after startling Steve several times—“Woa there Cap, sorry, guess you get spooked pretty easy when you’re buzzed!”—lounges against the back of the couch, his hands tapping at his legs instead.
Tony still hasn’t caught the man blinking. “I’m sure I will,” Tony replies at last, and, taking Wormseed’s words as a dismissal, takes his leave.
Eventually: a long multi-chapter sequel about them dating, sucking at dating, having kinky sex, and maybe figuring out how this whole relationship thing works.
No one stops Steve from putting himself on the mission. He meets the first wave of Hydra cannon fodder with more vitality and emotion than he’s felt in weeks. It’s like sensation returning to his limbs after coming in from the cold; he’s connected to his body, his purpose, his ideals. This is what he’s for. He knows this. There’s no question that this is right.
—and lifts the shield over his head—but before he can bring it down over the Skrull’s neck, the false Iron Man throws his upper body between Steve and his double.
“He has,” Steve insists, turning to snag the condiments tray from the table behind him. “This one has the hot sauce you like and a full thing of sugar,” he says by way of explanation, trading out the containers before returning the tray where he found it.
Snowfall doesn’t come with a soundtrack like rainfall, but even cocooned in Steve’s duvet, the curtains drawn, Tony can feel the town becoming enveloped in a blanket of snow.
When he’s cried out, he kicks open the door of his forge, tosses the bottle onto his anvil, and smashes it to smithereens before it has time to roll away.
“No, c’mon, it’s weird,” Steve whispers back, watching Otto’s return to the kitchen out of the corner of his eye.
he seemed really surprised to see us and kept asking if we’d “been in the computer” and “what year we’d arrived” and “why we hadn’t teleported out”
“I know what you mean,” Tony snaps. He sighs. “Look, the way I see it, the supersoldier serum, it’s just technology. You with the serum, me with the armor—they help us be who we really are.” His voice is softer now, and Steve doesn’t think it’s just because he’s talking about armor. “Who we want to be. I’m not saying it would be the same, just that, you know, you can still help.”
Steve brushes past that to call Tony an authoritarian, to compare registration to Japanese internment camps.
Tony doesn’t so much as flinch. His eyes—and god, he looks tired—lock on Steve’s face, steady as the rest of him. The armor remains motionless on the ground.
“I did say that.” Steve tries to be grateful that he has time to prepare answers to some of these instead of being blind-sided by them. “‘Would you say that the role of Captain America has shaped your identity?’ Really?”
Carol insists that Rhodes needs to see a video of rotini being manufactured. JARVIS brings it up on the main screen and everyone settles into couches to watch, clutching their drinks and dessert plates. When the video ends, Jen puts on a compilation of cats wandering into courtrooms, then T’Challa presents one of a parade of cats dressed in Avengers costumes, and Natasha—who had never struck Steve as a dog person, but here they are—insists they balance out the cat representation and asks JARVIS to play what transpires to be a video of a dachshund proudly carrying an oversized branch. Jan follows it with an Instagram post of Lucky stealing pizza out of Clint’s hand without him noticing. Pepper plays a video she took of Tony in Pym’s lab. Her giggles are audible in the background, as well as the buzz of other students. Onscreen, Tony pours beakers of liquids Steve doesn’t recognize into other beakers, until the mixture he’s made lights up in a flash, making a little round cloud of gray dust just above the beaker’s rim. Video-Pepper’s laughter rises into a guffaw at the stunned expression on video-Tony’s dust-covered face.
He wishes he had the armor to hide his face. How long has it been since he ended that sentence? A millisecond? A minute? Extremis could tell him, but not in any way that would be meaningful to him.
. “We should try that sometime,” he says, a giddy smile on his face. “Do you want an armor? I could make you one. It could have a star-shaped arc reactor.”
And now they’re in—a very stylish cruise liner? The room is huge and there are no windows, but it has the sleek, efficient curves Steve associates with boats and submarines. Not that there would be any reason for such a big, mostly empty room like this on a submarine.
. Everyone loves you. Hardly any chatter from Evangelical or any other conservative groups. A couple of ‘em just sent out a brief statement reiterating their views on ‘homosexuality,’ without even mentioning you by name. Fox News just had a line on the news ticker: ‘Billionaire and Iron Man Tony Stark comes out as bisexual.’ Hey, they even got the term right, way to hit the bare minimum, Fox News.”
a bicep reads. Beside it is a crude sketch of a syringe with droplets spilling out the tip. Below that is a drawing of a penis, also with droplets coming out the end. His other arm has a laughing Iron Man faceplate and a note that says,
Three days after the Leverage team has taken the job, Tony’s on the secure line that he and Hardison set up for their daily check-ins, and without preamble Spencer says, “Hammer’s working with ViaStone.”
A few minutes later Loki, no doubt bored by the lack of attention, huffs and says, “Armor Man had to leave Dr. Pym’s Nanoscale Materials seminar in quite a hurry.”
Reed would know, Steve supposes. Steve used to think he knew what Tony wanted. The war taught him that he never did.
He sags, buries his face against the broad wall of Steve’s chest. “Every way I’ve ever tried to be better, it was because of you.”
Yet, Steve feels it acutely. They have the same chemistry lab time that afternoon, one of the few academic classes they share. And they don’t share it, exactly, since Tony’s working on his projects for the two advanced courses he was taking with Dr. Pym—Organometallic Compounds and Crystal Structure Analysis—while Steve is still just fighting his way through Basic Principles of Chemistry. Tony is several rows away, perched on a tall stool, bending over the lab table, his jet boots tucked under him, showing Jan a robot he’d shrunk with Pym particles. Steve can hear Tony’s breath even over the chatter of the other students, the whir of centrifuges, the sizzle of solutions over Bunsen burners.
Is it even Tony that he’s mourning? Steve didn't know him like he thought he did. Like he wishes he did.
Tony blinks with eyes that are hazy but all his own. The silver on his skin recedes like a tide going out. He flexes one hand, watching it as if he doesn’t recognize it as his own. When his gaze lands on Steve, his face softens. “Steve,” he says.
Steve redirects his ire into the battle. The Skrulls are doing this to manipulate them. He’s not going to let them succeed.
, is that Virgle Groslin’s body washed up the night before on the banks of the Kirby River, crawling all over with dragonfly nymphs.
Around them, cooling fans whir softly. The sound of a fabricator working is dulled by walls and distance. Music plays, something Tony wasn’t listening to in the first place, volume so low he couldn’t make out lyrics, just a steady buzz to match the chatter of his brain.
Steve takes Tony’s hand as they step, together, toward it, and thinks that this time, they really do feel the same way about things.
“I’ll run laps another time,” Steve says firmly. Then he starts to second-guess himself. “Or, I could do that now, if you have something else—”
pull off undercover? Just a little, mostly at the start.” Parker sounds like she’s trying to be reassuring, but it’s not really working.
"That makes sense," Steve says, voice tight. "That was right before you—" He cuts himself off. His eyes are unfocused, and Tony wonders just how long it took for Tony to ruin everything between them. Again.
Steve missed his chance. He thought he’d have time. He’s a coward, and he thought—he’d hoped—that it would be Tony’s idea. They’d go to their favorite diner, the one with the weird omelets named after the Avengers, or a new restaurant Tony wanted to try. Tony would order dessert, and offer Steve a taste: a kiss once removed. They’d walk back to the mansion together, too absorbed in conversation to notice the cold or the passage of time or the clouds obscuring the night sky. And then Tony would take hold of his hand and smile that soaring, sky-high smile, and—
He jogs up and down the stairs on Lombard Street while cars of tourists slowly wind up the road. The sun glares through the solid wall of fog, casting no shadows on the coral-colored bursts of hydrangeas.
There are white lies, like, “I can’t see the scar at all, even when I look for it” or "That color looks great on you." There are lies to manipulate and control, like, “It’s for your own good,” or, “For the glory of the USSR!” There are lies we tell out of love, like, “It’s nothing to worry about.” There are truths omitted out of fear, twisted out of envy, inverted out of malice. There are lies we tell without words, lies made out of our bodies and clothes and the frightened expressions we wear on our faces even as we lift the gun out of our mark’s holster without him noticing us cut through the ropes tying us to a chair in an abandoned warehouse.
Steve pictures himself standing in Tony’s workshop and asking him to make a personalized dildo out of the same material as his prosthetic arm. “You could call it that.”
The man facing Stark is another visitor, one Steve noticed two days before and hadn’t expected to see again after the following day's train out of town. He’s an ordinary enough fellow, in fine black clothes only a little rumpled and besprinkled with sand. Right now, he looks mad enough to bite himself. “This is nothing to joke about,” he hisses.
Steve gets through the first day by operating his body like a puppet. He should hate this. He should refuse to take part in any of this. But he just feels empty. No, he’d feel empty if he were capable of feeling. He
The store’s PA system starts playing “Singin’ in the Rain,” the way it always does when the automated misters in the produce section turn on. Tony imagines that the store’s employees tire of that gimmick very quickly.
After a moment to process this, Parker says, “We can definitely use that,” and then everyone but Tony starts talking at once.
Tony tells himself it doesn’t matter why Steve’s agreed to talk and just starts talking. He begins with the Armor Wars. How different things are now.
Nat, Pepper, and Rhodes devote themselves to showing off their favorite video clips. Carol begs Jen for a massage, and ends up sitting on the floor so Jen can reach her shoulders from the couch. T’Challa and JARVIS are deep in a conversation about flexible body armor, and Jan is taking photos of everyone—mostly Tony, who is posing and shooting kisses at her phone. Steve watches them both.
“So we were just sort of floating, weightless, inside of this glass bowl, except it wasn’t glass, really, it was some kind of energy, with these little pink and purple pulses running through it, and the whole thing was hovering in this kind of—I don’t know, wireframe. Like a cube, but just the outline, like it was a neon sign.”
For now, they tell the NMAT their favorite foods and what they’re in the mood for, and after providing lists that include fettuccine alfredo, chanterelle mushrooms, Chinese steamed pork dumplings, lemon meringue pie, smoked gouda, eggs over easy, Caesar salad, matzo ball soup, millefeuille pastries, and kalamata olives—generates a five-course meal with flavors from all over United Space.
The soundless voice tells Steve how it could fix him. But he need only look at Tony for evidence as to what the price for that might be.
“You’re going to make it up to me,” Tony says. He doesn’t draw his face away; his lips graze Steve’s while he speaks. “You’re going to keep making it up to me.”
“Funny.” Steve slaps him across the face, rattling his jaw together. Before Tony can prepare himself, Steve hits him again, knocking his head in the opposite direction. “I don’t need your participation.”
“Parker has to be on call as Agent Hagen or McSweeten will spook. Gotta be something Hardison can pull. Like the Geneva Paso Doble.”
Tony screams. Steve lowers himself down so their chests are flush, humming in satisfaction. He covers Tony’s forearms with his own, pinning him completely, and wraps two fingers around Tony’s wrist, covering Tony’s soulmark. “He had your mark, too,” Steve says, mildly, like he’s not fucking Tony raw.
Instead Tony leans in unsteadily to kiss him, and Steve leans in to meet him. He welcomes Tony’s mouth, so hot and alive, with his own. His kiss is firm and searching. Steve squeezes Tony’s hand, his thumb still resting against Tony’s humming pulse. Alive, alive, alive.
"Can we talk about it later?" Steve asks. He sounds tentative, unlike himself. He's usually so big in his fury.
Tony closes his eyes, takes a deep breath, lifts his head, and by the time he’s sitting up and looking at Steve again, he’s smiling. “Alright, the next one I want you to see is ‘Spock’s Brain.’ Spock’s brain gets
“There he is,” Steve says, relieved to have an excuse to cut the conversation short and avoid further discussion of Winter’s songwriting. “See you tonight!”
“It’s a phone, I’m me, that’s how, no problem.” Tony chooses not to take offense. He’s a big person, he’s moving on. Onto business. “Anyway, I was calling because—”
There’s a woman in one of the single seats along one side of the car, a backpack on the floor between her legs, a handbag resting on top of that, and an upright bass in a hard case wedged between the wall and her arm. There’s an open bottle of cola under the seat behind her—the man sitting there has both feet on the seat and his arms wrapped around his knees while he dozes, forehead bouncing against the window. Every time the train jostles, the puddle draws closer to her backpack. The woman eyes it, warily; other than the cola and a few inches around each seat, bodies fill every square inch of floor in the train.
The book is warm even through the fabric of his clothes, warmer even than standing in the bright noonday sun. Forgetting it’s there is hard to do with its heat drumming against his breast.
Steve is working late in his office. Maria tells him that even Fury took breaks, but Steve doubts Maria believes that herself.
Tony turns his head away, unwilling to close his eyes and unable to look Steve in the face. The throbbing in his side settles into a rhythm with Steve’s unhurried thrusting.
"I'm on your side for good," Tony says. "No matter what. Please. I don't know why I did—whatever I did, why I thought it could go any other way, but I won't—I
When Steve had cornered him for a conversation, Tony knew with dread and certainty that Steve was going to tell him he was wrong about Ulysses. That he should listen to Carol.
After Lieutenant Gonzales leaves, Tony suggests an early dinner. He leads Steve to a wall panel he assures Steve is called an NMAT (Nutritional Molecule Assembly Tech). Apparently Lieutenant Gonzales explained it, but Steve missed it. Tony says that it’s basically a “molecular 3D printer,” which makes sense, but then starts talking about Minkowski transponders and paraphased singularity inhibitors and Steve loses track.
Stark’s splashed out on the porch of his forge, out too late or up too early. Honton stands a foot away, hollering loud enough to shake rain out of a clear sky.
need them, if Tony chose it. Once Steve is immobilized to his liking, Tony prepares Steve cursorily and then drives into him in a single violent stroke.
The man with the cane is systematic. He avoids Tony’s ribs, softens the blows on Tony’s lower back. He favors Tony’s shoulders, at first, until a hard hit knocks Tony’s right arm out of its socket, loosing a yell that he bites back too late. Then the blows come harder, faster, against his ass and thighs, switching position before he can acclimate.
“Unhelpful comparison, then. Okay, so, there’s nothing actually blocking my airway or in my lungs or anything like that—nothing more than usual anyway—but when it gets bad, it’s like, this pressure, digging into me. I can’t actually feel the reactor, inside me. I mean, there aren’t nerve endings there. But when it flares up it’s this—this spiraling pressure, like, like a whirlpool, and the centripetal force is making my ribcage curl in on itself, pressing more and more until it’s pushing all the air out of my lungs and just trying to inhale makes everything hurt worse.”
The truth is that lies are everywhere, covering up the truth like snow covers the frozen ground of the Siberian tundra. Sometimes the lies are barefaced and glaring, like the visibility of fresh arterial blood against newly fallen snow in the noonday sun. Other times the lies are lost among the truth, like when the northern nights are so long and dark that a figure clad in a black leather tactical suit can disappear entirely among the brush. A person experienced in such things can come to discern the shape of the land from the shape of snowdrifts, but they can also be fooled, believing that a flat stretch of snow is innocuous when really it covers a series of secret tunnels and underground bunkers, or perhaps thinking that a small hill is a snow-covered barn.
A liver spot recedes, then vanishes entirely. The saggy, wrinkled skin on his hands retracts, growing taut and smooth. By the time he has his phone out, his hands are perfect, nimble and rosy. His reflection in the phone is that of a young man with thick blond hair and hard eyes.
It feels like he’s lost two people, and each loss has disemboweled him. His closest friend and an implacable despot, attacking and imprisoning their friends, building a war around himself until it carried him into the power he craved. Tony was the most important person in Steve’s life, and the man who took that person away.
like to the point where he actually seems anxious even though you’re both in dangerous situations all the time?
He should’ve learned by now not to let opportunities pass him by. Tony had seemed unattainable. And then Tony had been an adversary. An impossibility.
He’s worried about his company, Steve thinks. He has so many responsibilities back home. Too many, really. He could stay here and have everything he wants, but he’s thinking about his employees. About the Avengers. “You thinking about visiting King Arthur’s court, Shellhead?” he teases, hoping to bring back a sliver of that smile.
“Halt,” says the not-horse. How it does so without looking absurd is anyone’s guess, but it manages.
Steve’s reply is the same. He shakes his head, says, “No. He just carried on like nothing had happened. Had the robots squeeze oranges and make bloody Marys and waffles. We all ate breakfast and talked about that lecture Lunella gave about depictions of women as gynoids, cyborgs, and computers. Then he saw everyone off.”
Tony, as if noticing Steve watching him, blinks himself awake. He smiles like a lightning flash, just as brief and just as bright, before pushing himself up. Steve realizes he doesn’t know how long he’s been staring, and pulls his gaze away. “Computer, how long until we dock at Frontier Outpost 12?”
Tony stills. It’s like the rough waters of a lake smoothing out all at once when the wind stops. “Well. Then. Good.”
Sure enough, there’s a new sound coming from behind Tony now, one that Tony realizes with leaden dread is Steve unzipping his fly. The soft noises of Steve taking out his cock reach Tony over the pounding of his blood in his ears. He hears the flesh-slapping sounds of Steve jerking himself and Tony’s trembling turns to full-body shudders, wracking his shoulders and setting off the pain in his side all over again. Stars burst against his eyelids. Maybe he’ll black out again. Maybe he’ll pass out entirely.
Steve hadn’t heard about those lenses, and he’s surprised Tony follows that sort of thing. Maybe he shouldn’t be, since apparently he makes Clint’s hearing aids, too. “But it wouldn’t really be me,” Steve says, then regrets it as soon as it’s out of his mouth. “I mean—”
His narrow bed is practically identical to dozens of others he's awoken in in hospitals, labs, and infirmaries all over the world. Except those beds had had call buttons. This one has a small panel with controls to raise or lower the head of the bed, and an outlet with a USB port next to it. Nothing else.
Steve releases Tony’s wrist to take hold of his chin, forcing their eyes to meet. “He loved you and admired you, but it wasn’t enough. He knew he couldn’t trust you. You’d only hurt him and use him, wouldn’t you?”
He drops his hand, steps back, and zips himself up again. “See you soon,” he promises before he goes.
For Wanda’s Purim party, Tony dressed as an astronaut, Steve as a cowboy. Wanda and Vision were both dressed in Hogwarts robes with Gryffindor colors, leading many on the team to speculate that they were Ginny Weasley and Harry Potter, respectively.
“I’m so glad,” Tony says, surprised to find he’s shivering. Isn’t it August? “That’s all I want to do, Steve.”
“You do,” Tony says. He sinks back against the headboard, pulling Steve into his lap with him as he does. “Even if I hurt you?”
He lifts Tony’s wrist in his hand, clamping down on his soulmark. Tony tries to jerk away. His body tenses at the new contact—then relaxes. He’s lightheaded. Sated. Safe. No. No, this can’t be happening, he’s none of those things. It’s a trick his body’s playing on him. This isn’t Steve. It isn’t.
“Don’t start with jewelry, you have to build up to it. Flowers are good. Steve likes big peonies, the kind that grows all over France and Italy in the spring. He’s always been a sucker for flashy shit when it comes to romance, so you’re in luck. But don’t take him somewhere too fancy or you’ll make him uncomfortable. And give me a call if he fucks up, I’ll kick
He's out the door before Tony can reply. Tony doesn't see how Steve can promise that, when Tony doesn't even know how he'll fall asleep, let alone how long he can stay that way.
So Steve agrees and the computer pulls up a map showing them to their quarters, and they board something like a large elevator with half-a-dozen crew members, including an eight-foot-tall one with six legs and a pair of wheels. People get on and off, chatting, and it seems strange to start a conversation with Tony halfway through getting inside the elevator car, so Steve doesn’t, and they stand together in silence until a display indicates that the doors are about to open on the corridor containing their temporary living space.
Tony takes an involuntary step back. His ankle hits the leg of a wheeled desk chair, sending it spinning out behind him.
He doesn’t realize he’s agreed to anything until Steve says, “Great. Mayor Hill recommended someone. I can’t wait to see what you come up with.”
. The tutors who taught him Shakespeare would weep. “What’s the circumstance of life that if you take all trouble there, there’ll remain some still?”
The first thing Tony notices as he and Apple approach the massive wooden doors is that the intricate iron hinges are quite skilled work and he’d like to meet the smith that cast them. The second thing he notices is the tall, cloaked man standing in front of them.
Another not-quite smile. "I'm getting better." Tony must look skeptical because Steve leans in several millimeters, so slightly he must not realize he's doing it, and says, "Really, Tony. I'm alright. I'm worried about you."
Steve looks at him with an unnameable intensity. His eyes search Tony's face and his grip tightens on Tony's hand. A spike of fear shoots up Tony's spine, though what he's frightened of, he can't say. "Do you mean that?"
There is an idiom in the English language that goes: “don’t bring a knife to a gunfight.” It means: “be prepared and bring the appropriate equipment and expectations to a given situation.” However, it is also worth mentioning that even during a knife fight, it’s important to bring not only a knife, but the right kind of knife. A butter knife or artistic reproduction of an antique hunting knife or a knife made of jell-o would be just as inadvisable in a knife fight as a knife in a gunfight.
“I could—if we find a way for it to stop this, then I’ll denounce the Act. Erase the database entirely.”
Tony waved the thought away. “I’ve had this in storage for nearly a decade. Pepper’s assistant found it and brought it out for the party.”
hey so sorry to text you out of nowhere and maybe this is really random but are you at the timeless archives right now
“Close to the chest” is a phrase which here means that she habitually obfuscates and misrepresents her thoughts, with a few exceptions for those she holds dear.
The third time Natasha had encountered James, she had been on a mission to the Forbidden Zone, later known to SHIELD as the Dead Zone. This radioactive area in Bashkortostan had been the site of Cold-War-era experiments in both nuclear physics and human genetics. Its use had been suspended after a fatal mistake in nuclear waste disposal destroyed the base. All history of the site had been publicly erased and disavowed.
“I hunted down our friends. I used Thor’s DNA to make the abomination that killed Bill. I betrayed you. All of you.” Tony’s voice is so matter-of-fact it makes Steve want to scream. Tony is a liar, a hypocrite, a turncoat, and he’s standing here, saying all this like Steve doesn’t already know it, like it explains anything.
Tony forces his face into blankness and turns to meet Steve's gaze. "Can you tell me why the—was I injured?"
"Better be." He helps Tony back into his shirt and waistcoat. Tying his cravat turns into a kiss, long and leisurely, and already familiar and comfortable. Steve considers it just about the perfect way to spend the time until Tony's well enough to walk back to town.
James found the nearest security camera, stood square in front of its line of sight, and waved at it.
. The back cover promises a sequel is in the works, and eventually, a complete trilogy. In the summary for the second book, Brickenn and Klithua are alive, so they must survive their injuries and their second encounter with the Star Cullers. If further books were published, it was after Steve was lost to the ice; and when he came back, he couldn’t find them.
Steve’s hand is still in Tony’s hair, the other wrapped around the small of his back. He pulls away with reluctance, a fond smile on his face. “What’re you packin’, then?”
Tony makes himself comfortable sitting on the edge of the bed, arranges Steve flat on his stomach, and places Steve’s head in his lap. His groin smells like his expensive bodywash, his arousal adding a note of musk. “Open wide,” he says, a smile in his voice, driving his cock into Steve’s mouth the moment his lips touch the head.
Steve lifts his eyes back to Tony’s face and finds Tony gazing back at him, wearing the same expression of weariness and resignation that he feels on his own face.
There’s a dragonfly on his head and two damselflies on one arm. Their wings flutter and tickle through his clothes. A bone-white hand bobs out the mud near one boot. Another step. Wet grass brushes slippery tendrils over one knee. His other is entangled in long strands of hair from the floating body of a redheaded woman in a chiffon dress. He walks on. Another damselfly alights by one ear. The next body skimming the surface of the mud wears a Union uniform.
“Hey, okay, so,” Tony begins, looking thoughtful. “Before you—I mean, when you aren’t pumped full of super-soldier serum, you have asthma, right?”
Steve comes in a rush. He blinks at the mess dripping down his chest. The dildo is still in his mouth.
Initially intending to assassinate Brickenn on behalf of the Dread Assembly, Klithua first encounters Brickenn when she tracks him to a remote town in the sapphire desert of Ungoliant VII. He works there as a test pilot flying experimental starfighters. She passes up several opportunities to kill him in favor of learning more about him instead, though she discovers very little. All the locals know about him is that he keeps to himself, dresses in black, and was once a captain with the Sunken Division of the Crimson Company.
“Oh!” Tony takes a moment to recover, then he gets to his feet, the high-watt smile back on his face. “Sure thing, Cap. Can’t get enough training in, huh?”
“It’s not for you to fix,” Steve snaps. Tony always does this, offering too much even as he steps back, makes it impersonal. He’ll spend hundreds of thousands—often
“It’s like that with asthma, sometimes,” Steve agrees. “I can’t really breathe when I get a bad attack.”
Steve’s heart sinks. Tony had another flare-up, and Steve didn’t know. It probably hadn’t even occurred to Tony that Steve would want to help. Rhodes had said that Tony doesn’t want Steve to think poorly of him, but what does it mean that Tony thinks so poorly of
I think he was gonna say something about it but then we got attacked by not-robots and were separated
The PH Diner—Tony’s sure it’s meant to stand for Pleasant Hill, but Tony always thinks of acids and bases—is halfway an Edward Hopper painting, half a puddle of motor oil reflecting a landscape of neon and fog. The booth seats are tomato-red vinyl and shiny enough to be used as rearview mirrors. The parking lot is always empty and damp with rain or melted snow, one streetlamp flickering in and out, the sound of a suspended street sign creaking in the wind overpowering the sizzle of the deep fryer. The town is gray through the big windows, far foggier than it should be this time of year—whatever time of year that is. The bright lights, gleaming vinyl tabletops, and laminated menus make the dull purple-gray outside all the more bleak.
Tony’s left him a note; a paper one. How quaint. It’s on a corner of copy paper totally unlike the hotel letterhead that sits on the polished mahogany desk. His handwriting is the same, blocky and utilitarian. There are depressions in the paper under each letter, deeper at the joints; Tony used a crappy ballpoint pen, the kind that left-handers have to fight against to keep from jumping over the paper.
“Look, I hope this isn’t weird,” Tony says, looking down at his hands, “but after today I may never see you again. So, I wanted to say, I’m going to miss you so much. The day we found you in the ice, it was—that will always be the best day of my life.” He meets Steve’s eyes once more. “I’m so glad I met you.”
Tony is cuddled pressed against him, asleep, and Steve is an utter asshole. Tony wouldn’t have allowed this is he knew how Steve feels about him. Not that he’d show it if he were uncomfortable—he’d be so kind, and never mention it again if that’s what Steve wanted—but that he wouldn’t want to lead Steve on. Once Steve had inched over so their hips were flush, Tony would have waited a couple minutes, then excused himself to grab a beer or check on a robot. When he came back, he’d sit somewhere else, taking the last spot on another couch so Steve couldn’t join him.
Of course Tony knows what it’s like being disabled, just as well as Winter, Clint, Misty, and so many others on campus do. Steve feels like an asshole.
“Oh, well that’s okay then!” Tony throws up his hands. He’s facing Steve now, backlit by the sun. Steve takes it as a small victory that Tony’s eyes are visible again through his glasses. “If I’m caught—because obviously, I didn’t take any precautions, right, that’s me, just barreling in and showing off—I might get sent to the principal’s office, so, too bad, I guess I should’ve just left you in a burning warehouse to die.”
Tony pulls out his sunglasses, sets them on, and turns to give Jan a peck on the forehead, holding the pose long enough for her to get a few pictures. Steve pretends to himself that the tightness in his throat is some kind of reaction to the booze. He’s never gotten drunk before, after all.
Steve squeezes Tony’s throat until Tony blacks out again, then shudders and comes as he releases his hand and Tony coughs and gasps for breath. He doesn’t pause. Nor does he slow. He keeps up his brutal pace, grinding their bodies together, pushing and pushing into Tony until Tony feels like this is just another wound Steve has given him, another place where his flesh has been parted and pierced—like his body is nothing but a target for Steve’s malice and gratification.
Tony has to fight through a haze of pain to take in what Steve’s saying. He believes Steve immediately. It’s not that Tony’s pretending Steve’s someone else. It’s not that this man speaks with the voice of the one Tony loves. No, Tony knows it’s true because he has no doubt of Steve’s eagerness to hurt Tony himself.
Steve catches him and guides him into the entry hall. “Let’s get some real food in you,” Steve says, stomping melted snow off his boots and locking the door behind them.
They congregate in one of the penthouse’s smaller entertaining areas, the couch-filled den where Steve and Tony watch Star Trek. Robots serve birthday cake, tea, and coffee in addition to the alcohol selection they’d provided before. Steve gets a slice with most of Tony’s name written on it in frosting.
Steve tries to tug his hands away; Tony’s grip tightens in response. His skin crawls. He’s never been more aware than this moment that the man with him isn’t Tony, not really. “Don’t say that to me.”
Tony is slow to regain full consciousness. The first thing he says is, "I think I hate magic." He's smiling though.
Steve had thought saying it would be impossible. He wishes he could’ve remembered all the impossibilities Tony achieved every day, and said it anyway.
Like he could look anywhere else. Steve’s wearing a Hydra uniform, and he smirks down at Tony. “I thought I’d have another day or two before you figured it out.”
Something in Steve’s face closes off. Tony admonishes himself for the surge of hurt he feels seeing it. It’s better to get this over with now.
As he crosses the room to reach Tony, he catches Sam saying, “Have fun!” in a sing-song voice Steve doesn’t know quite what to make of.
Wong is first to reach them. He dismounts with a disdainful look on his face and snatches up the book from where Steve's let it fall. “You ever listen to anyone other than yourself, Stark?” he asks, climbing back into the saddle.
Tony stands up the moment the meeting closes. He’s turning away from the table, composing press releases in his head, when Steve appears in front of him. Tony has one foot on the ground, the other still in the air—he flails, fails to catch his balance, feels fingers grasping his wrist. The hand on him tugs him into a corner of the quickly emptying room.
, but there’s nothing to be done. There’s not even much to distract him—beyond thoughts of Tony, but those are always in the back of his mind anyway. He knows Natasha prefers to do most things in silence, but he also knows that she won’t press him or tease him too much and will let him leave a lot of what he doesn’t want to say unsaid. He’s not sure where that leaves him.
The device is warm and buzzing under Steve's fingers. "I can," Steve says, and Tony's smile turns knowing and rueful.
Bucky is there when Steve and his team arrive. “What the hell are you doing, Barnes?” Maria yells when she sees him. Bucky slips away once it’s clear that Zola has escaped, and Lukin, if he had even visited recently, is absent as well.
Still, it’s strange to think of the suit and the serum that way—as just tech, the same, just ways they make themselves closer to their own ideals. “You’d really build me an armor like that?”
Steve shifts in his seat restlessly. His and Nat’s reconnaissance at the AIM Institute of Super-Technology provided no leads on the rumored attack. He wants to act, to do
Later than evening, Tony turned to Steve—who had barely left Tony’s side throughout the whole party, not that he would admit it or Tony would realize the implication—and said, “Where’s the illustrious Agent 13? I was looking forward to seeing her here.”
“You won’t.” He can’t. Steve believes the SHRA is wrong, Tony knows he does. He’ll never stop fighting what he thinks is unjust. That’s just Steve.
Most of an hour passes before Stark stirs. He pushes himself upright, his eyes falling on the glass of water. He puzzles at it for a moment before he notices Steve beside him. “Didn’t have to sit here doin’ nuthin’ like that,” he says, taking a chunk of buttered bread. He gobbles it down without getting a crumb in his mustache, though his fingers are greasy with butter. He licks them clean.
“Yeah,” Steve says, pushing himself into a sitting position. He stares down at his wrists. They look painfully thin. “That’s what I hate about it.”
And though she doesn’t mean it to be, this is also where Steve’s reminded that Carol stood by Tony, listened to him, when Steve wouldn’t. He shouldn’t hold it against her. He’s glad Tony had a friend who was worthy of him. He just can’t abide her sympathy, which he doesn’t deserve, and right now he can’t stand her company, either.
“I like you desperate,” Tony remarks, and replaces the gag. “You’re going to have to be patient again, now. Can you do that? Wait your turn like everyone else?”
“It’s all gonna go bad anyway, and it don’t need my interferin’ to do it,” Stark replies, not noticing or not minding Steve’s rage. “Keepin’ to myself might even keep me outta trouble.”
Tony inhales sharply, blinking tears out of his eyes. The expression on his face is full of wonder and affection. Has Tony looked at him like this before? He would’ve noticed, surely.
Steve introduces the Mighty Avengers. It’s wrong, and not just because of Registration. He shouldn’t be doing this alone. He shouldn’t be standing here without Tony. It can’t be the Avengers when Iron Man, Thor, Hawkeye, Scarlet Witch, and so many others are missing—when more still are fugitives from the organization sponsoring the team.
“If we decide that’s what’s best, that’s what I’ll do,” Steve says, voice rising. “Damnit, I’m trying to—I’d have conditions. I’m not going to—I wouldn’t just hand myself over to SHIELD, I wouldn’t just abandon my ideals, but I can—compromise. And I expect the same of you.”
“Okay,” Steve says without conviction. He’s going to be a jumble of nerves until tomorrow night. Natasha’s still watching him with that inscrutable expression, which only adds to his disquiet. “You’re probably right.”
If he goes a few days, or a week, at a time without sleeping, it only means he’ll sleep soundly when he finally collapses in bed, deep and dreamless.
Some stories have clear morals. The moral of every Baba Yaga story recorded is “don’t piss off Baba Yaga.” The moral of “Pinocchio” is usually interpreted as “don’t lie.” The moral of “The Frog Princess” is “don’t be impatient.”
Steve’s sure the ferryman is someone he knows, someone from town, maybe, who he’s walked past every day for years. He’s also sure he’s never met the man before.
Some turns later, he rounds a bend to the sight of a three-headed dog. The pup’s mouths are hanging open, panting, showing off their teeth. In other circumstances, Tony would call them a handsome dog indeed; with a thick, salt-and-pepper coat like a coyote, a curled, bushy tail, bright brown eyes, and wide, wolfish faces, the critter wouldn’t look out of place at the Westminster Dog Show. Other than the extra heads, of course.
“‘I hope you never have to read this, old friend,’” Steve begins, and wishes for his mind to sever him from reality as fully as it had before. His awareness of the courtroom is dim, but not dim enough.
Steve lets Tony take his time, watches as Tony ostentatiously bends over to retrieve a cocktail glass from a slender acrylic side table. Wind skims across the surface of the swimming pool, rippling Tony’s reflection. He swirls the pale chartreuse alcohol before drinking it. Vapor sublimates off the foggy, frozen glass as Tony knocks it back, leaving only a thin medallion of lime.
“Is that true?” someone says. Tony’s missed another chunk of the conversation. He’s not sure who asked the question, and only realizes it’s pointed at him when he looks up to see everyone looking at him.
He’s prepared for the dizziness when he stands this time, taking slow breaths. He pulls the chain over his head and carefully, slowly, telegraphing his movements, steps forward and places it around Tony’s neck. Tony’s grip on the arm of his chair has gone white-knuckled. He searches Steve’s face, but Steve doesn’t know what he’s looking for.
Did Tony see Steve's mark once before? Steve had died a prisoner of SHIELD, and Tony had been director. Did he look? Would he violate Steve's privacy like that, knowing what he found would hurt him either way?
Count Lev Nikolayevich Tolstoy wrote: "All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way."
Deals 1520 damage, plus 115 for each Team Iron Man Escalation tile, 135 per tile if target is Team Cap, or 165 per tile if target is Cap.
interplanetary journeys, and had retrieved the book—cover falling off, pages curling with damp—from the collection he kept under his bed. The neon marquee of the Jewish delicatessen on the ground floor climbed alongside his window, and its scant saffron light was just enough to read by.
“What I don’t get,” Sam said, “is why you two—a tech genius and a strategic genius—are still trying to talk to each other.”
The way Tony meets his gaze leaves Steve no doubt that Tony knows he doesn’t mean just now. “You could’ve told me the truth. You know, before a bad guy blindsided me with a video of my mom being murdered.”
In the morning, Steve pulls the curtains open to a clear sky and several feet of fresh, powdery snow on the ground.
When Tony comes back with Banner, the four fellas are hanging by their wrists from the porch of Fisk’s casino.
The smell of putrid meat dissipates the further they walk from the hellmouth, though Steve can still feel its hot breath on his back.
“We’ll find something together,” Steve says, almost like he believes it, “and when we’re ready we’ll be a united front. And—if that means I stop fighting registration, then that’s what I’ll do.”
The man with his hand on Tony is broad and blond, and Tony’s never seen a sadder or more beautiful smile. A fleeting, intrusive thought tells him that this is the best day of his life. “Thanks,” Tony says, smiling back into bright, clever eyes. He feels he should explain why he almost stepped into traffic, but all he has is the provably false impression that the street had been empty a second ago. “Can I thank you more over coffee?”
, I just…” He trails off, making a kind of shrug with his hands. “What I was trying to say is—and never, ever tell Jan or Rhodey or Pep this, okay—I can’t think of the last time someone gave me a present they really
Tony glares, but the air goes out of his sails. His voice is low and steady when he says, “Yeah. I did.”
A week after Purim, Tony and Rhodes stumbled into the kitchen at 1:00 in the afternoon, griping about the lights and bickering over who would make coffee. Wanda asked what the occasion had been.
If Iron Man takes more than 2250 damage in a single hit, create a Team Iron Man Escalation tile. If the damage is dealt by a member of Team Cap, the threshold to create a tile drops to 1810. If the damage is dealt by Captain America himself, the threshold drops to 1660.
This was a lie, in the sense that it was not James, strictly speaking, who had shot her. Had James been himself, he wouldn’t have even been present to do so. It also suggested that James had only shot her once—while the truth was he had shot
“What's to give up? The sheriff hasn’t put me in hoosegow and Fisk won't bother to hang me. Don't matter much if half the town thinks I'm a killer.”
The sorceress was—in what Natasha considered an amusing coincidence—hiding in the Forbidden Zone. When questioned, the sorceress admitted that she had cast the spell in order to try to disrupt the team. Under the impression that compliance would be rewarded with leniency, the sorceress lifted the spell.
The Skrulls had hit everywhere at once: SWORD, the Helicarrier, the Raft, the Cube, Thunderbolt Mountain, the Baxter Building, the Sentry. And a virus was uploaded to the Stark mainframe, destroying satellites and SHIELD defense systems.
The mirror over the bar is twelve feet long if it’s an inch, all one pane of glass. Nodding said it’d come from New York down through the Panama Canal, to San Francisco, to Carson City, by boat, cart, burro, and carried by hand, all to get to Timely. The men in town don't like to drink or gamble anyplace they can't see who's coming in the door. It was Nodding's largest expense in setting up his business, but paid for itself in a matter of months.
That’s not what Steve thought he'd hear. He swallows and wishes, not for the first time, that Stark would give up his bottles. Stark seems to be holding his breath.
James turned back toward the horizon. “Dunno if it’s a good idea.” The low sun cast glaring beams of light that wreathed his long dark hair in a halo of light, like a painted icon. Natasha thought the image both ironic and apt.
Steve knows that any news he's going to get about Honton, the three strangers, or Fisk's boys is bound to be lousy. He wonders which will cause the most trouble, in the end.
“Me too,” Steve says, and squeezes Tony’s left wrist, hard enough that it twinges even after Steve’s gone, pain alongside the buzz of his soulmate touching his mark.
Steve comes twice more like that, buried inside of Tony, cutting off Tony’s air just to feel Tony shudder and clench around him. When he finishes he showers alone, dresses, and leaves Tony there, messy and naked and barely clinging to consciousness. Steve doesn’t bother with restraints. He doesn’t need them; Tony can’t walk on his own.
Steve's eyes, blue as gemstones, are locked on Tony. Steve takes a breath in a deep gust. He leans in even further, but he's still waiting for something.
He exhales and leans in, closing the scant distance between their faces. Tony’s eyes fall shut. He tilts his head and lets Steve’s lips find his.
They hoist him onto his feet, pinning his arms behind his back, and half-carry to Steve. They shove him down so he lands, hard, on his knees, and tug his head back so he’s looking up at Steve.
Three more fingers join the first, scraping down Tony’s abused back. Then a second hand, grazing along Tony’s front, a fingernail scratching at his nipple. All that Tony gives away is his rabbiting heart and gasping breath. He can do this. Steve’s trying to provoke him, so he won’t react. It’s not even pain, not as Tony reckons these things.
“Sorry, I’m not saying this right.” Tony rearranges his legs, making the mattress dip and buckle, and Steve is painfully aware that they’re alone in his room. Sure, the door’s been blown open and Steve’s hiding under the covers, but they’re both on his bed, technically, and that’s all that matters to some primal part of his brain. “Do you think you can look at me while we’re talking?”
- A real word which means an ardent reader of bookworm, though in this case I’ve used “bibliophagic” poetically to suggest eating a book with a fork and knife
“Right.” Tony looks at his hands. He wishes he still had the stylus to fiddle with, and has to will his fingers still instead.
“Because,” Steve says, like Tony hasn’t spoken, “I was hoping we could—I mean. In Asgard—look. Did you mean what you said?”
“Wow, truly embarrassing for you. Yeah, I’m starting to see why we’ve never spoken to each other before now. Constantly interrupting, inferior phone, insinuating I can only work Stark tech—I don’t know how Steve puts up with you—”
Steve, who was attending out of a desire to get to know Tony better, said, “Just being a supportive teammate.”
“What job?” Tony asks, perching on a stool across from where Steve’s dicing onions for their dinner.
When the door to his cell opens again, an indeterminate amount of time later, Tony expects it to be more men coming to hurt him. He’s almost looking forward to it. It would be a reprieve from his endlessly circling thoughts of Steve, and maybe his body will hurt in new and distracting ways.
Rhodey says, “Absolutely not. I’ve already got a job Tony wanted me to do, and that’s running the Initiative. I’ve done the Iron Man thing, and I’m sticking with War Machine.”
He stomps in. Steve knows he can step lightly when he wants to, even in his wide jet boots. These loud, heavy footfalls are intentional. “I was worried about you,” Tony says, tromping toward Steve’s bed.
Tony stops talking. Steve can barely hold himself still. He forces sincerity into every line of his body.
No one is standing over their game making side bets, though plenty are crowded round the other tables.
That doesn’t make any sense. That’s not how Steve thinks. But before Tony can say so, Steve is on his feet, putting his clothes back on. It’s all Tony can do to grab a robe and trail after him as he heads to the door. Tony’s still covered in lube and come and his own sweat, and his thighs tremble as he hurries to catch Steve entering his code again.
Sharon fired the shots that killed Tony. She’s in SHIELD custody, as is Crossbones, who’d been sniping. Bucky and Sam caught up to him, apparently, though Bucky’s in the wind again. Sharon’s memory is spotty, but psychics have traced her brainwashing to Dr. Faustus, who was posing as a SHIELD psychiatrist, and Faustus in turn has been connected to Red Skull. She’s confused on most points, but didn’t seem to have expected Tony to be there at all. Her target was supposed to be Steve. This was meant to be the climax of Red Skull’s master plan: Steve’s public death at Sharon’s hands.
Tony opens the door to the bedroom. Alicia steps inside, and he follows after her. It’s just Steve’s bedroom, walls the same real-estate-agent white as the rest of the house, utilitarian black-out curtains over the windows, empty other than the old-fashioned bed, a single nightstand, and a pair of matching dressers. Steve’s tidied away the small piles of clothes that usually litter the floor, leaching it of some of its warmth—some big, thick rugs would help with that, Tony thinks—and made the bed with military precision.
“Are you having some kind of moral panic about lying?” Tony asked. “You can fucking save it, I’m used to being lied to by now.”
right so we told him how we got here and what’s been happening and he went on this whole long thing about the knowledge = power part and how much sense it makes that books could generate spacetime distortions and he was talking REALLY fast but he did say “well, that makes sense. what’s a bookshop but a genteel black hole that’s learned to read”
. I’m probably making up half of what I promised you on licensed Iron Man and Captain America action figure sales alone. Think of it as a bonus for a job well done.”
Tony runs through the riddles he knows by heart, and chooses a question best answered by an engineer. “You've got three sacks, all the same size. One is full up with coffee beans. How do you fill the other two by emptying that one?”
That’s who he is. He does the job. The world needs Captain America. The world needs heroes, and they think that’s him.
A part of Steve wants him to, but he doesn’t know what he would say. He lets the back of his head fall over the back of the couch, remembering Tony’s profuse thanks from earlier in the night. If only Tony would let Steve make him that happy all the time. Or try to, anyway. Steve would try so hard, and sometimes he’d get it right, and Tony would be that much happier and taken care of. He’d bring Tony meals when he was lost in a project, help him clean up after lab explosions, and fall asleep squashed together. Just like this.
“Hey,” Steve says, opening the door and then ducking back into his room. “Sorry I’m not ready, I can’t find my workout clothes, and I wasn’t sure you were going to make it.”
"Hey," Steve says softly. He isn't quite smiling. The chair he's in looks comfortable, not like what you usually find in hospitals. Tony wonders how long he's been sitting there, or how often. "How're you feeling?"
More importantly, Wormseed, Mugwort, and Slovenwood are gone; Tony’s liquid silver and arcane words have twisted and unmade them into nothing but crimson sand that spills into the desert like blooms of a claret cup cactus. Doom's been knocked to the ground, slowly pushing himself upright as if it pains him. The ground is strewn with strands of metal like ocean waves frozen solid and made miniature.
“So say I show up, I’m—ostensibly—in charge of SHIELD… what’s supposed to stop me from disbanding the Cape-Killers—”
“I saw it out on Iron Man business, so I didn’t have the time or the tech to 100% verify authenticity,
Outside the windows of Club A, the marquee of Stark Tower flares with the words STARK, STARK, STARK—a lot like the inside of Steve’s brain, really. On the dance floor, Tony himself dances, moving like molten metal and light given form. He dances how he flies: effortlessly and joyfully. He flashes a dazzling smile—not toward Steve, he’s probably looking at Eric or Pepper or one of the other beautiful people who are already gravitating toward where Tony and Jan are dancing. Fuchsia spotlights and blinking string lights reflect off the brick walls, off Tony’s skin, off the smooth metal of Tony’s gauntlet. The arc reactor glows cyan through his dark tee, drawing Steve’s eyes across the club like a ship to a lighthouse.
“What happened?” Red Wolf asks when he and the others arrive. His face when his eyes land on Steve is nearly comical. “Rogers?” He shakes his head. “Wong said, but I thought maybe he’d been putting the wrong kind of plants in his pipe.”
“That’s the reason,” Steve says, and that isn’t right, this isn’t happening, because he sounds heartbroken. “That’s why you never changed my overrides.”
He knows what Steve can do with this. What he can make Tony do, make Tony feel. What he can turn Tony into. What he can turn the world into.
A tear-track runs down the corner of one eye to Tony’s chin. His throat works. “Okay.” He opens his eyes. “Let’s—” He breaks off.
Right, of course Nat knows what happened better than Steve, even though Steve was actually there. He should have asked her in the first place.
The others are engaging with the Skrull duplicates—speaking, aiming, sizing each other up. Luke’s arguing with the Skrull impersonating him, Clint can’t look away from the false version of Bobbi, the Spider-Men face each other with identically wary posture, and Ares shouts at everyone to leave and let him handle the Skrulls on his own. No one listens. Instead, the two groups converge in a rush of voices and weapons.
Steve’s had enough; now he’s fighting dirty. He bashes his opponent, channeling all of his strength and fury into his shield.
Days pile up behind him. He gets through the week. He wonders when the outrage will hit. Or maybe the shame will come first.
“Why?” Steve asks. Tony’s already reaching for his bag of toys, the big leather one with the silk rope and reinforced cuffs—Steve’s opinion is irrelevant.
“You don’t just think registration is wrong. You think it’s—authoritarian, an invasion of privacy. That I’m chasing power, or control, or I don’t know what, but you think going after our friends meant nothing to me, that I want to lock them up.”
“Next time,” says the second voice, and the sounds of their booted feet trail out of the room. They take the light with them when they leave.
“Guess they were too distracted by that super-soldier body squished into that tiny little suit,” Spencer says, his tone so steadily maintaining its usual grumble that it takes a moment for Tony to catch up with what he’s saying. “You responsible for the tailoring on that thing?”
He reaches the edge of the park just in time to hear a hum of repulsors and catch a flash of gunmetal gray and a glint of red; War Machine is flying Tony toward the tower. Steve watches their arc through the air. When they light on the landing pad on the roof of Stark Tower, Steve breaks back into a run.
“Ooh, ‘denouement,’” Parker says with an exaggerated French accent. “I love it when you let people know you’re not actually a himbo.”
Pepper says, “Maybe Tony ran a company and worked as a superhero, but honestly, Steve, just getting out of bed and brushing my hair is a big accomplishment for me right now, and it’s already my job to keep Tony’s millions of employees from losing their jobs, working for Aleksander Lukin, or both.”
He almost doesn't hear Doom's careful footsteps across the sand. He manages to snatch the book from the ground before he reaches them. When he does, Doom stands over them, observing through his unreadable mask.
“What do I—right. I must have some ulterior motive for not wanting you to die. I don’t know why—I’ll just go, shall I?”
But he can’t shake off the images of the man with bare hands, brushing the pads of his fingers over the spot where Tony was just caned, of Steve wearing their uniform, of Steve taunting him.
Tony pulls out the second he finishes and replaces his cock with a plug. He doesn’t bother with lube, just slams it past any resistance and walks away. Steve can't turn his head far enough to see him, can't call out to him through the gag. With the senses left to him, he tastes the leather and metal of the bit in his mouth and hears a shower running in a nearby room. Tony doesn’t return after the water stops.
When Tony looked up again, Steve was crouching next to Tony’s bed. “What about—everything with Bucky?”
There’s one man who has barely spoken a word. His bare hands distinguish him among the men in their identical uniforms. His gloves are stuffed into his belt. There’s blood under his fingernails. Each time they need Tony moved, this man is the one to do it. He draws his fingertips down Tony’s torso. He runs one finger along Tony’s jaw. When Tony flinches, the man smiles and licks his lips. When one starts on Tony’s back with the cane, the quiet one wraps his hands around Tony’s waist to hold him steady against the force of the blows.
“Oh yeah?” Steve asks, sounding more sour than he intends to. Tony’s baseline human without his armor, but now, without the serum, Steve’s… much less than that, even.
“Wow.” Sam shakes his head as if in disbelief. “Man. You make this armor-fucking thing sound almost cute.”
, Steve doesn’t say. Instead, he slowly draws himself up, musters a smile, and says, “Hi, Tony. It’s good to see you. Thanks for coming out here to help.”
“When I asked you to meet me here, I thought—after everything we’ve been through, after all these years—”
if he has had any successful long-term romantic partnerships on this campus I am unaware of them. do you know of any?
He tells himself it’s the evening chill that sets him to trembling. It could just as well be his hankering for a tipple. He’s already heading to hell, he tells himself.
“Hey. That pain you were telling me about the other day—if you get it while we’re hanging out, what should I do?”
Doom is raising Cain with his yelling and cursing—some of the cursing literal, Steve thinks. Apparently no longer considering Doom a threat, Wormseed turns his full attention to Tony, and begins reciting words Steve doesn’t like the sound of.
“I’m not,” Tony insists. “I wouldn’t. C’mon. They make these special lenses now; they basically correct red-green colorblindness entirely. I could figure out how they work and make you something custom, maybe even contact lenses.” He’s talking quickly, both excitement and trepidation in his voice. “And Clint’s Deaf, he has this crazy inner ear thing actually, did you know he needs these special custom-built hearing aids? You wouldn’t say he shouldn’t fight.”
“Yes,” Steve and Tony say at the same time and holy shit, he saw Steve yesterday, but he misses him so fucking much right now.
Steve’s rhythm finally speeds up, but Tony doesn’t have it in him to be relieved. Steve will stay hard. He can keep fucking Tony’s face for hours, if he wants.
Three episodes, two tubs of popcorn, and several grilled cheese sandwiches later—the sandwiches are fancy, of course, prepared by robots, made with provolone, mozzarella, and fresh pesto—Steve gathers the courage to ask something he’s been thinking about since Tony first visited him while he was de-serumed.
Tony’s got plenty in his pack that could be used as a weapon, but he’d prefer not to fight if he doesn’t have to. Plus, he’d rather save that fuel for later. “Riddles. Best of three.”
Steve’s voice sounds like someone forgot to grease the wagon at the best of times, but he sings anyway.
If that sockdolager was affecting, the time it takes Rogers to draw, turn around, and blast the man who’d been slinking up with his piece in hand is something else again. Tony doesn't think it's just because his brain isn't moving very fast at the moment.
“You’re not stupid,” Tony grumbles. “You’re just acting stupid. And I get why you don’t want anyone to see you, okay?”
“Let me buy you a treadmill,” Tony says, not for the first time. “You can still get up with the proverbial bird for your run, but then you can come right back to bed, and get me all sweaty to match, and then we can shower together—”
He works through the night, into the next day, and then all day through. The sun is down by the time the armor’s functional; Tony’s not sure how long it has been, having not noticed it setting. Now that his hammering’s done, he can hear a hubbub of voices, blows, and shattering glass.
Jan hands him a small, flat box wrapped in mint green fabric with magenta polka-dots, the cloth forming the bow at the top. Tony carefully undoes the bow, while Jan clasps her hands and jumps up and down. Steve, who’s been maintaining a steady buzz on Grandmaster’s booze since the toast, has no idea how she still has so much energy. Watching her is making him sleepy, so he watches Tony, instead: his clever fingers, both flesh and metal, moving with utmost precision. When he finishes unwrapping, Tony sticks the fabric in his back pocket like a handkerchief.
At least it’s a distraction from feeling self-conscious about how messy his room is. He tosses some energy drinks and power bars into his bag too, for good measure, and is struggling with the zipper when he notices Tony watching him. He suppresses the shivering feeling crawling up his spine. “What?”
can change what I believe in,” Steve says, though he’s not sure he ever has. “We’re going to see this through.” It’s already easier to believe when they’re like this, standing close enough that their eyelashes touch. “We’ll figure it out.”
In this case, he’s trying to exonerate himself of involvement in Honton's murder. Not because anyone in town seems to care or even remember, but because that kind of civism was important to Steve—and perhaps a bit because Tony can’t abide an unanswered question. Steve would’ve done it proper, being the law and all, but Red Wolf's got enough on his plate, especially with Mister Osborn going missing. Tony can find out who’s responsible on his own.
Jan snaps a pic of Tony biting into a Rhodes cookie with a rapturous expression on his face. His eyes are closed in elation. There’s a dusting of powdered sugar on his lips and chin when he finishes gobbling the cookie. Steve has a feeling that that expression—and Jan’s photo of it—is going to haunt his dreams.
Beneath the fabric is a plain white box. Tony removes the lid and pulls out a wool scarf—knowing Jan, it’s one she knitted herself—in the same red, yellow, and black of Tony’s favorite jacket. “Awesome!” he says, putting it on. It’s wide, and long enough to wrap around his neck at least twice, so it ends up looking like a bulky cowl, incongruous with his skin-tight tee and generous sprinkling of glitter and confetti.
Steve drops his arms and takes a step back, pushing the table with him. It takes a floorboard with it.
It’s like Steve refuses to understand. He compares what Tony did to what Jan and Hank went through, but that’s not the same at all. Tony almost killed innocent people with his recklessness, and wasn’t Steve just accusing him of doing the same thing now?
A second memory is layered over it—though neither can be a memory, since they didn’t happen—and Tony’s cuffed to the wall by metal bands—
When Tony looks up, Steve’s staring at Tony's wrist. Tony's eyes dart away, his face heating. "I learned my lesson," Tony says with more force.
Tony rebuilt his whole right arm and shoulder with armor nanites. If he touched Steve with that arm, it would feel like touching this toy.
“If he were sick he wouldn’t have been in Probability and Stochastic Processes this morning.” When Steve opens his mouth to say something, Natasha rolls her eyes and adds, “It’s across the hall from my Programming Abstractions class, I saw him go in. And,” she goes on, her tone growing sharper, “he wouldn’t be studying in here, he’d be letting Jan take care of him in Stark Tower.”
He hasn’t yet managed to get to his feet, and cranes his neck to watch Tony’s approach. His movements are impossibly fluid, entirely effortless. He grabs Steve by the hair and holds him, forcing their gazes to meet—not that it occurred to Steve to look anywhere else.
Tony—one foot on the curb, the other still in the air—flails, fails to catch his balance, hears brakes screeching, horns honking, feels fingers grasping his wrist—feels time suspend. Like being hung on wires over a stage. And then with an intake of breath the streets of Pleasant Hill move around him again. The hand on him tugs him all the way back to the sidewalk, spinning him into an off-kilter pirouette so he faces his rescuer.
“The coffee grinder at the general store’s broken,” Steve says, setting it down beside a bar of iron and an empty whisky bottle. The grinder is some newfangled contraption of Stark’s, run off wires and magnets and conductivity.
They talk about the Young Avengers, Gwen Stacy, White Tiger. Times when maintaining secret identities would’ve saved lives. Tony promises no one’s name will go public unless they want it to. Didn’t the Army keep Steve’s identity safe, even after he was presumed dead?
Doom Manor strikes Tony’s as both unfortunately and inaccurately named. It has more in common with French palaces and châteaus than even the grandest of the mansions and plantations he’s seen in the Americas. The roofline is all spires and pinnacles and too-tall chimneys. The facade is a patchwork of pointed arches, sharp cornices, and towers branching off of towers. It looks altogether as steep and sheer and formidable as the mountain face it’s built into. Tony can’t fathom how the supplies and manpower for its construction could
“Still breathing?” Tony asks. He smiles when he sees Steve’s red eyes, the tracks of tears down his cheeks. “You miss me that much?”
Steve shakes his head. “Nah, Honton didn’t know this book from the rear end of a horse. Someone thought he did, though.”
“We lived together,” Steve says tightly. Tony wishes he could resent Steve for the flood of relief he feels at being spared coming up with a reply himself.
“Don’t see as how there’s anythin’ left to figure out. That dark book of spells ‘n curses is ‘bout as real as the fortunes my busted contraption don’t spit out no more.” Stark tosses back a full tumbler of whiskey and signals to Nodding for another. “A man was arguin’ with Worley Honton in public time and again. In the very hotel where Honton was stayin’, even out in the middle of the street. Next thing, Honton’s lookin’ like target practice for a twenny-inch heavy cannon, an’ the only other fella on the whole floor of rooms is the one that’d been hollerin’ at ‘im.”
all of my surveillance devices in the library stopped working at the same time, approximately 52 seconds before you arrived and attempted to text your study group
With a sharp nod, Doom removes his own gauntlets and examines Tony's. Together, Steve guided by Doom's instructions, they cobble together the wires and magnets and deconstructed metal casing into a device that they strap to Tony’s chest and plug straight into his skin.
“The town was in this, I don’t know, fish bowl. Like it was under a bell jar, except round, almost like a snowglobe.”
“No,” Tony cuts him off. “Let’s watch Star Trek. There’s this episode from season two I wanna show you. C’mon, I’ll have JARVIS start some popcorn.” He’s smiling now, grabbing Steve by the wrist and tugging him further into the penthouse.
Steve blinks. Tony had definitely said that he wasn’t sharing them with anyone. He’s spent the entire time after receiving them clutching the container protectively to his chest. But here he is, offering one for Steve to take. He’s holding it right up to Steve’s face; if he were to lean forward just a little, he could eat it right out of Tony’s hand.
“How’d you find out?” Steve asks. At her glare, he adds, “If it’s not, I don’t know, against your spy code to tell me.”
.” He has a particular fixation on flaying Tony alive. “Sharp knife. Or a dull one. Maybe a potato peeler. Or just a bullwhip. String him up and go at it.” His laughter, though, is a joyful chortle—it should be the laugh of a kinder man.
The world tilts. For a moment, Tony is weightless, like he’s standing in an accelerating elevator, and the snow is rising from his feet toward the sky.
Tony sighs. There’s a comforter and a quilt and a sheet and of course all their clothes between them, but they’re still pressed against each other, Tony’s lower back nestled right up to Steve’s waist, and Steve thinks he can hear Tony’s heartbeat. Or maybe it’s only his own. His hearing isn’t at peak levels right now, after all.
Tony swallows. “I…” he trails off. “Just because—wanting me doesn’t mean you have to like me. We don’t—you don’t have to do this. You don’t owe me anything. We promised to talk, to try to compromise, and that’s—as long as we can make the fighting stop…” There’s a frantic expression in Tony’s eyes. He’s tense and nearly shaking, like he still expects Steve to sucker punch him and leave him bleeding. Like he won’t do anything to protect himself if Steve does just that.
Furthermore, it is often said that apologies are for small things, mistakes and errors in judgment you have learned from and will never repeat, like using a teammate's throwing knife to slice a cantaloupe or replacing a friend's quiver with a plastic toy designed to market the film "Brave." People who believe such things will tell you that there are no apologies for things like shooting someone with whom you have previously been romantically involved, using a teammate's curling iron to perform an experiment on gamma radiation, or stalking you through the Siberian taiga. These people will tell you that apologies are only meaningful if you will truly never perform the offending action again—actions like doing unspeakable things while brainwashed, when one doesn't exactly choose to be brainwashed in the first place.
“You get started without us, Tony?” she asks, clearly aiming for light and pleased and landing closer to confused and disappointed.
Destroy all Escalation tiles if there are at least 5 Iron Man Escalation Tiles. Generate 1 Red AP per tile destroyed and 1 Yellow AP for every 2 tiles destroyed.
Steve counts his breaths. He doesn’t bother trying to break or slip his restraints. Ten minutes pass with nothing but the forced air of the environmental system skimming Steve’s skin. Tony’s come is dry and itchy in Steve’s crease and down his thighs. A quarter of an hour. A half. Steve fills his mind with numbers to the exclusion of anything else. He reaches a count of two thousand breaths—nearly an hour. He wonders if Tony’s going to leave him like this until the last trace of Extremis vacates Steve’s body. He wonders how Tony will look at him once he’s no longer beautiful, once his body no longer belongs to Tony.
Steve, with his quaint misunderstandings and old-fashioned clothes, isn’t fancy enough for Tony, anyway. Tony will probably end up with Jan, or someone like her: fashionable, old money, cheerful. Not someone who sees things so differently that they split the entire student body down the middle.
“Stark!” someone cries. It’s Red Wolf, and from the sound of it, he’s practically at Tony’s front door. “Stark, are you there?”
Pyrotechnic stars launch from the hidden barrel in his index finger and explode a foot above their heads into a burst of fuchsia.
Tony jerks, cutting off a breath that’s not quite a gasp. His eyes are wide, his body lit on one side by an aurora of sunlight through the bedroom window, on the other by the blue-cast light of his chest implant.
—there’s a use for Captain America. Out here, where everyone’s needs are easily met, where all of the planets and species of the galaxy are at peace or working toward it, where the only ships being sent out are research and exploration vessels, where superhumans are accepted and celebrated, there’s no need for Captain America at all.
Tony is back in his armor. His helmet is tucked under one arm when he walks up, smiling like it’s a regular morning and they’re standing at the coffeemaker, Steve back from his morning run, Tony either still awake after a long night or getting up for an early meeting. Which will never happen again.
“Please,” Tony sneers. “Like you didn’t know.” All bragging aside, Tony’s sure he wouldn’t be seeing the inside of any of Hardison’s systems unless he was allowed there.
“Here.” Steve takes the lid off a saucepan, takes a scoop with a slotted spoon, and holds it to Tony’s face. “Taste this.”
“I wouldn’t suggest that. Sam may have registered, but he can still be prosecuted for working with you. Same for the rest of your team.”
Smiling weakly, Tony lifts the arm armored by his gauntlet. “Needs more power.” Then unconsciousness takes him.
The damage from that battle is, according to Pym and Reed, what caused the fault. Tony replaced the helmet and had diagnostics running on the rest of the armor. To all appearances, it was pristine. But it hadn’t been, and then there was Tony, fully armored, bleeding out from a few measly bullets.
If Sam’s noticed Steve’s distraction, he’s kind enough not to mention it.  “Why doesn’t the Academy have a Quidditch team?” Sam muses. “We’ve got enough fliers, after all.”
Tony’s breath is hot on Steve’s skin. “Steve,” he says, speaking so quietly Steve has to strain to hear, letting more and more of his weight fall into Steve, lips close and wet. He wriggles, like he can go deeper, like he can make this even more intimate. “Don’t be silly.” He sounds amused. His thrusts are leisurely, dragging slick and hard in Steve’s hole.
“Oh, do you only see women?” The hope in her voice sickens him more than anything she’s said so far.
“What do you want me to say? You said I’d crossed a line, with Cloak and Wiccan. I tried to talk to you, I practically begged you! And now you’ve come here and disabled my armor. Seems pretty goddamn straightforward.”
“So,” Tony starts, “that could have gone better.” He wishes he were in the same room as Steve right now. This is one of those relationship things where he should be there, he’s sure.
The hand lifts, buries itself in Tony’s hair. Full contact. Immersion. Tony leans into it, wondering when he closed his eyes. Tears eke out of the creases. What if he could earn Steve back, for real, in small pieces just like this one?
There's also the members of Steve's team who've already been captured and imprisoned in the Negative Zone. Jen doesn't have to say out loud that their futures are contingent on Steve's cooperation, too. Someone in charge knows Steve won’t refuse, with their freedom at stake.
The lyrics I’ve included of “Poor Wayfaring Stranger” are adapted from several different recorded versions. In the folk tradition, I’ve rearranged some lines and changed some bits here and there. I’ve mostly pulled from
Apologies for not getting this up earlier in the day! I think every family in the county not observing Christmas picked the same restaurant mine did.
It’s barely five feet, but Steve lands hard. Too hard. He lands twisted up wrong, one knee bruised through his jeans, a scrape on his face, winded.
Deals 2140 damage, plus 135 for each Team Cap Escalation tile, or 165 per tile if target is Team Iron Man, or 190 per tile if target is Iron Man.
There had also been a documentary about the Beatles. Steve had watched the whole thing, finding it a good break from the depressing chronology of war and authoritarianism. He’d wondered if he should be glad they’d included a few palate cleansers, or if someone picking the contents just really liked the band.
Honestly, Steve’s surprised Rhodey doesn’t say worse. He’d deserve it. It’s his fault Tony’s dead, and they both know it.
“BuzzFeed has a 50-photo gallery of your cutest moments caught on camera,” Hardison continues. “There’s already half-a-dozen op-eds in
Tony, on his way out the door for an SI meeting in Manhattan, ran into Steve, on his way into the compound after a visit to Peggy Carter. Tony asked him how it had gone.
If you aren’t familiar with canon, here’s the rest of the ending. There are hints that Bruce has become the Hulk, and that a spider with some kind of gamma powers is lurking around town (no doubt heading for the Parker homestead). Deadpool and Punisher show up to avenge Steve (the newspaper said that the Sinister Six, who in this world are bank robbers, were responsible for his death). Governor Roxxon sends a guy implied to be Red Skull to take over for Fisk. Carol is voted mayor. Red Wolf, Natasha, and Luke enforce freedom and justice.
He’s so sure nothing will happen, and when it does it’s so fast, that he hears the plates of armor collapsing and falling to the ground before he knows he’s seeing it. It’s not a loud sound, the metal hitting the floor with blunt thuds, but the unreality of it rings in his ears. And there Tony is, already on his feet, falling into a defensive hand-to-hand stance, his gold undersuit all that covers him.
Or, imagine that the love of your life is a man you haven't been able to stop thinking about since you first met battling a trickster god, a man you admire, a man who you believe is too good for you, too honest, too old-fashioned to ever return your feelings. Imagine that he is under a spell forcing him to lie, and he says, "I like you." Or, imagine that the love of your life is a man you haven't been able to stop thinking about since you first met battling a trickster god, a man you admire, a man who you believe is too smart for you, too worldly, too dedicated to enacting a vision of a beautiful future to ever return your feelings. Imagine that he is under a spell forcing him to lie, and he says, "I hate you." What do you think he is trying to say?
“I broke it off,” Stark continues, staring at his hands, “because it all’d gone to blazes. It was the only thing I could do. Hell, she wanted me to.”
By now, Tony knows that Steve’s hiding something. Supposedly, all he’s hiding is everything that happened that Tony can’t remember. Steve’s hints suggest that he’s justified in not wanting to, and that he knows he can’t hold off on telling Tony forever.
Steve walks to the mirror to check his back. It’s covered in writing and lewd drawings. There’s an outline of a handprint on one asscheeck. Inside are the words:
“Can’t say I do. How’ll some singin’ do instead? More likely to keep you up all night than put you to sleep though, I’m told.”
The agents probably expect Steve to give a speech. Maybe Maria does too. But what the hell is he supposed to say? The whole situation is a farce.
. (Tim Eriksen has a particular way of singing that is intentionally very droning. I like it, but it’s not for everyone.)
“Steve. I…” Tony shakes his head. “I’m not an easy person to love. To be with.” His words catch, raw and quiet, in the back of his throat. Steve thinks Tony might be trembling.
Steve barely restrains himself from rolling his eyes. “What, sharpening pencils for Fury? Organizing Pepper’s files?” He shakes his head. “I’m pretty sure you’ve already built robots that can do all of that better than I can right now.” Now that he’s colorblind again, he wouldn’t even be able to decipher Pepper’s color-coded labeling system.
Satisfied with Tony’s work, the creature stands aside to let Tony pass. Tony hands over an apple and, in answer, is nudged toward one of the pathways ahead. The way from there is much the same as before, if perhaps less winding. The rounded walls of the passage glisten with moisture and pulse gently, and slope distinctly downward.
The rest of their company pass away one by one, until the ship is crewed only by the pair of them—he muted and solitary in his bereavement, she obscured by her own lies and reaching for him nonetheless. He reluctantly reveals memories at each of their stops—New Laurentia, the vaniium refinery on Mauti III, Citadel of Meni on Charybdis Prime, Draconis IV, the ice hive of Petbe.
just these white art nouveau things that couldn’t even move but then there these HUMAN FACES projected out of their heads which was deeply uncool
“Bad dream?” Steve asks, setting Tony’s mug on the nightstand. It’s Tony’s favorite, the yellow one with the black cat.
"Whatever I did, let me make it up to you. Let me show you what you mean to me. You've given me so many chances, and I don't deserve another one, but I—you must know." Tony's voice breaks, and Steve reaches out and rests his hand on Tony's. It grounds him; he's here, in this bed, magic symbols written on his skin, and he failed, and Steve is here anyway. "I always hoped you carried my name the way I carry yours, but I—I never believed you could."
By the time Steve gets there, Jan has Tony on his feet and is helping him to the back door. He’s leaning heavily on her, clutching at—his chest? They’re almost out of the club when Jan lifts her head to glare at everyone staring. Steve turns away, feeling sheepish. He ducks his head, his eyes on his shoes as he makes his way back to the pool table.
. But he isn’t. He’s telling Pepper how the manufacturing will work for the modular homes he’s designed. She thinks he’s calling from Malibu. Projections and past data have already been compiled and typed up, Steve knows, because they keep referring to page numbers and paragraphs and diagrams. They’re reviewing the proposed launch timeline on page 24 when Tony notices that Steve’s awake.
“Just wondering if I could get you to say it again,” Tony says, unthinking. He hasn’t known how to act around Steve, not since he woke up to find a whole year overwritten in his brain. This is a role reversal for them, now, Steve’s friendliness and Tony’s stiffness. It makes him feel like he’s skipped a step on a staircase, standing here and acting like he's used to the idea that they aren't friends.
“Have you ever—” Steve cuts himself off, a fresh flush blooming up from his clavicle to the apples of his cheeks. It makes Tony think of mercury expanding in heat, climbing up the cylinder of a thermometer.
It’s 54F and overcast when Steve lands in San Francisco. A private car service takes him to a hotel in Pacific Heights; the driver doesn’t say a word beyond, “Sir.”
“You’re shaking,” Steve says. Tony can hear the smile in his voice. He grabs Tony by the hair as he crowds closer. His other hand rests on Tony’s throat. It feels big enough to wrap all the way around his neck. Tony swallows against it, and Steve leans over to kiss him.
Steve grins and kicks off, catching briefly on a vertical wall to launch himself off it. In moments he’s close enough to grab Tony by the ankle—which he does, or moves to do, but then repulsors flare and Tony is soaring away, calling, “Catch me if you can, old man!”
Steve doesn’t flinch, but his body jerks. Tony’s kiss is all gin and teeth and tongue and the bite of lime juice over fresh cuts. He takes his time, lips pushing and tongue prying at Steve’s mouth, kissing like he’s trying to steal Steve’s breath away.
Steve also notices that the silent voice has evaporated from his mind, quick as green grass through a goose.
“They’re national icons,” Steve agrees, matter-of-fact. As well he should, being entirely correct. “Deserve to be shown off.”
After a moment’s consideration, Tony says, “A day and a half, at least. If we’re lucky, Victor, Wormseed, and his compatriots will have long since taken care of each other.”
“I tell ya what,” Steve begins, “Y’all pack up what’s left. Tony and I’ve had quite a time of it, and Tony’s nearly had the life sucked outta him. I’m gonna take him back to his forge so I can look after him. When he’s well and rested, we’ll tell you everythin’ you wanna know.” With that, he gets to his feet. He offers a hand and pulls Tony up with him.
It turns out that this time, knowing he’s about to be surrounded by AIM scientists isn’t enough to get by scot-free.
Two nights after the team had watched “West Side Story”—the night before the team finally observed the truth about the spell affecting Steve and Tony—James and Natasha went to the roof of the main compound building to drink vodka martinis and watch the sunset.
Tony sits at the very edge of the couch, elbows on his knees, one leg bouncing up and down, looking decidedly at the floor. Steve pokes at a screen for a bit, but can’t even pretend it’s holding his interest and ends up pacing.
Then, instead of telling him off for setting off fireworks indoors, she smiles again, this one a plastic thing, like a fake rubber plant from Ikea. “Very cool,” she says, and Tony doesn’t know whether to scream in frustration or moan at the ghostly pressure that’s riding his dick like a mechanical bull.
Tony stays quiet while they beat him. He holds back grunts of pain as steel-toed boots slam into his ribs. When he tries to curl into a ball to protect himself, they pry him open, one person holding down each of his limbs while the others get their hits in, bashing their boots into his gut.
“Perfect,” Spencer says, sounding glad but somehow still like he’s a snarling dog guarding an injured puppy.
When he’s so far from the passage he exited that it’s no longer visible in the distance, a pale sun is rising behind him. It’s nearly past the horizon when he reaches the edge of the river. It’s wide, wider than the Mississippi in Louisiana. The surface is spotted with scrubby, sand-colored grasses and arsenic-green algae. Some ways to Tony’s left is a punt barely big enough for four, a tall, solitary figure standing in it with a still-taller pole pushed into the water. The boat is smack in the middle between the two shores. The boatman is wrapped in a ragged white cloth that can only be described as a shroud, and looking at him fills Tony's head with a screech and clatter louder than a steam engine.
“No. Not to me.” Tony looked back up at Steve’s face. “It's not silly. What if we find out true love’s kiss
He didn’t think much, then, about being alone. He had few friends, none close, and no surviving family. If he’d ever failed to make rent, he’d have been replaced without a spare thought from his co-tenants. He took the bus to work because the crowds kept it warm, but the bumps and jolts shook his joints just as badly as if he walked. He worked despite aches and exhaustion, and knew he wasn’t the only one kept awake at night by the cold. Solitude was a fact of his life, background noise to his narrow breath, the pain under his ribs, the melted snow slush on the sidewalks and the frozen puddles on the pavement, the news coming from Europe. Survival left him little time for yearning, and he filled it with other people’s words of other people’s desires rather than contemplate his own.
Steve’s men take Tony to a concrete cell that reeks of ammonia. Four of them stay behind. One has a cane. Another has a leather case that he opens, showing off what’s inside—sharp, blunt, hooked, shiny, dull. It’s meant to intimidate him. It works.
If there is such a spell, though, Tony doesn’t know it, so he skedaddles right on out of there instead.
, the circuits say to the tangle of veins and muscles and breath that the rest of him runs on. His blood pulses in reply:
The grin Wormseed gives is as wide, noxious, and sour as the fold in that corroded pumpkin. “On this occasion, there’s another matter you may assist me with.”
Tony’s here, now. Steve can hear him speaking softly on his phone. He can hear the person on the other end, too: it’s Pepper. Tony could be on the phone with Ross, could be telling him,
my bad winter. the point is he was gesturing a lot and going “ook ook” and then finally he climbed up a bookshelf like a tree and showed us this book
It shouldn’t feel weird. Steve’s been on this couch with Tony before. Hell, he’s been alone in this room with Tony, for hours at a time without feeling self-conscious.
“What is it, Loki,” Steve grumbles. There are rumors that AIM’s going to launch another attack, but if that’s what’s happening now, there would be an alarm, a call to assemble. It wouldn’t just be Loki, gliding in and trying to rile Steve up.
A handful of Hydra agents are apprehended. A week later, three AIM lackeys are brought in. Several of these prisoners, independently of one another, attest that the body of Aleksander Lukin houses not only his own consciousness, but that of Red Skull as well.
“Go!” Victor yells. The flames are subsiding, the nebulous shadows within reconciling into the silhouettes of the three men. “Now, Stark!”
“Wouldn’t work with the media angle, and it’s better if the mark has children, anyway. I say a combo of the Peking Watch and the Proposal at the Seven Hills.”
“Uh, because you have the serum back?” Tony crosses his arms. “It’s okay, I know you probably want to go run, like, eighty million laps around the stadium just to celebrate that you can. The episodes are fifty years old, they’ll wait another few days.”
Ten minutes later, the intruder is still out like a light. The results on Steve’s screen haven’t changed since he first conducted the scans.
The adamantium cuffs are next, a set for each of Steve’s limbs. Then the collar, as if Tony’s point isn’t already made. He doesn’t need to bother with the rare metals, with Steve weak like this. Tony must like the reminder that Steve used to need them—that Steve
If we could find our way back to the Archives, we could then get out of range of the node and it would probably snap us and the building back into place
“And,” Lieutenant Gonzales continues, “if whatever you choose has altered the timeline, they wouldn’t have given you blanket permission.”
. Communication between two people is like a big afghan blanket that was hand-crocheted by your friend’s elderly mother: it can be a little lopsided, with one side more complete or open or duplicitous than the other; it can have uneven spots of broken trust, skipped stitches of missed opportunities, loose tails of yarn of things unsaid, and maybe the flowers don’t look all the same, because people change, and relationships change; but it can also have sections where the design and pattern are in perfect harmony, like a pair of lovesick idiots finishing each other’s sentences; it can have a whole row that had to be taken out and redone, like conversations that start out wrong and need to be paused and started over from the beginning; and it can, overall, be just the right thing to wrap around your shoulders on a chilly spring evening.
Steve pants and turns to Tony, who hovers beside him, eyes gray and dark, the color of clouds swollen with rain and thunder. His veins bulge out of his flesh in lines of silver. The metal breaches his skin most densely on his face, splitting into craggy branches from the corners of his eyes.
“But I already have one.” Steve grins and snakes a hand down Tony’s arm. “It even has my name on it.”
Sorry Bucky, I have to cut this short, there’s an ape here who might be injured. Thanks for talking with me, I’ll let you know what’s going on as soon as I have a chance!
“Exactly,” Steve says. “You didn’t. You could’ve done anything, and you didn’t. Not many people could resist a temptation like that.”
Tony’s hands come to Steve’s arms. “Okay.” It’s hard to see the expression on his face from this close. “Okay. What are we doing?”
Several days pass like this, Steve caring for Tony like a pet, leaving him drugged and naked, and then using his body for his own gratification. He lets Tony heal, but his concern doesn’t stop him from fucking Tony’s thighs or rubbing himself off against Tony’s ass.
Create tile if Iron Man takes more than 1500, 1350 from a member of Team Cap, or 1105 from Captain America himself. Destroy all Escalation tiles if there are at least 4 Iron Man Escalation Tiles. Generates 1 Yellow AP for every 3 tiles destroyed.
“I think I see what you’re getting at,” Steve says, patient but expectant. “I guess not, by the nature of the question, no, if the universe were completely altered, there wouldn’t be any evidence of it. That seems more the kind of question for you or Reed, though.”
The not-horse must’ve been walking through some thick and awful mud to get their hooves in the state Tony finds them in. The creature isn’t shod—and there’s a picture, an infernal farrier—and their frogs are as full and healthy as Tony expects from a barefoot horse. Their hoof walls are cracked and ragged
The fighting and shooting crawls on into dawn. A fair few men are happy to accept Fisk’s promises of money in return for killing Tony and Red Wolf, though they’re outnumbered by the widows with their rocks and pitchforks.
Steve says so, and when Stark turns to smile at him their faces are close enough for Steve to count his eyelashes. A familiar strain twists in his chest, catching his breath. It’s not the first time Steve’s thought of leaning in and planting a kiss on Stark's mouth, but it's the first time he’s thought Stark might have the same idea.
"Everything I've done, I did to keep you safe. I thought even if I wasn't yours, you were mine, and I wanted to protect you. And I know I did it all wrong, and I thought I knew—I thought I'd learned that I can't do that, can't do anything right, without you by my side. When you showed me—" There aren't words for how Tony felt in that moment, when Steve bared his soulmark to him. He'd thought he understood everything, then. "When I knew that I was your soulmate, I swore to myself I'd never act without you again."
Actually the other Iron Man had a secret identity that Tony helped him keep hidden from the other Captain America.
Steve knows what he’s supposed to do. He’s supposed to talk about how he’s feeling—which is impossible, because he can’t talk about what’s not there. But Sam’s been trying to get in touch with him, and, well, if Steve can manage a week working at SHIELD, he can reach out to his friends—what friends will speak to him, given his work these days.
No one’s wanted to claim Steve's horse, Apple, so a fortnight after her owner’s passing, Tony does everyone a favor and rides her out toward the mountains, the Book of Sins packed into his saddlebag.
The knife is not a large one, and quite narrow, but it’s sharper than obsidian and it’s pressed against Wormseed’s neck before the sentence is all the way out of his mouth. “You care to repeat that?” Tony hisses.
Natasha glances over at him from the cockpit. She tilts her head at him and says, “You have something you want to say about Tony.”
After a dozen rounds of that, vivid, solid-looking holograms fill the entire room, the gravity falls, and they’re swimming in an alien ocean. There are shipwrecks with quartzes growing out of their prows, pods of almost-whales trailing tresses of tails like seadragons, glittering fish that dart between and nip at their fingers, treasure chests containing bioluminescent jellyfish-esque creatures that spiral around them like synchronized swimmers. They swim through forests of seaweed that rise taller than redwoods, ride on the back of a chartreuse half-frog half-alligator, wind through labyrinthine caves with walls of undulating coral and budding geodes.
The Skrull Captain America is still trapped under not only Steve’s weight, but now half of Tony’s too. Steve rips the shield off his double’s forearm, snapping the straps, and tosses it to the side. The move disarms his opponent, but it also gives the Skrull the opportunity to drag Tony off himself.
“I hate that we’re in this pattern of mutually assured destruction—you escalate. I escalate.” Tony had been sure, scant minutes ago, that he’d finally hit Steve’s limit. That Steve came here to shut Tony down—armor, body, heartbeat, mind. But he says he believes in Tony. Maybe Tony doesn’t have to be a disappointment.
This is what Iron Man said when Captain America asked the team if there were any casualties: “Nothing to report, Cap. Did that wannabe Rambo hit you or what?”
They say little on the flight to the space station. Steve doesn’t bother to ask why Tony’s in the armor. Maybe he’s going to fly back to the
“Okay, first of all,” Sam says, all exaggerated aggrievement, “how the hell do you have an action figure of a starship? It’s a model. Hand-painted and hand-assembled. Second, I
he had this glowing wand/laser pointer/doohickey and like pointed it at our phones and it made a little noise
Steve thought he was helping Bucky when he gave him his memories back. But maybe he’s never actually known what his closest friends need from him.
“Well, good thing, ’cause there’s no undoing that,” Hardison says. “Captain America dates men. Queer kids all over the world heard that. We really are doing the lord’s work, huh?”
He doesn’t know how he’s done this job as long as he has. He doesn’t know how he’s still standing. He should have flickered and blown out, like a guttering candle—like a dying star.
“Sure you can,” Tony says. “I could make you that armor I keep talking about. That would help. You wouldn’t be a supersoldier inside it, but it’s nearly as good on the outside. Most of your health issues are at least treatable now, you know.”
“I wouldn’t have,” Steve says, too loud for how close their faces are. “I almost did it. I wanted to hurt you.”
She meets his gaze with hard, red-rimmed eyes. Standing up to him in a way few people dare—the way Tony did.
Steve could keep him here all night, all the next day, while SHIELD runs around looking for their poster boy. That would be a nice change.
Around 3 in the morning, at Jan’s insistence, Tony starts opening presents. The mood of the assembled party has drifted from jubilant and vigorous to pleased and laid-back. Vision’s finished DJing for the night, so it’s just soft classic rock playing in the background. The trip to the front room, where the gifts are piled, is chatty but subdued.
He’s disappointed he doesn’t get to eat it himself, but he has a good feeling that Tony’s going to offer him another.
They shove him to the floor, his legs straight out in front of him. His wrists are shackled. His ankles they chain to an iron bar that’s bolted to the floor. He knows that’s so he can’t twist away from blows to the soles of his feet.
Steve laughs and shoves two fingers inside, making Tony yell and writhe. “Hold still,” Steve admonishes, scissoring his fingers, no longer taking his time.
?” Tony knows he sounds desperate. In this moment, he’ll beg and bleed and split himself open for Steve’s cock rather than listen to this.
The Skrulls are no sooner gone than Thor, having come to aid Earth, now calls for help defending Asgard. Fighting is sufficient distraction from the memory of the life fading out of Tony’s eyes. Not Tony. A Skrull. A Skrull wearing his armor, his voice—
Steve takes Tony in his arms. Tony shudders, like the weight of Steve’s arms is the pulse of a sob. “I know,” Steve says. “I know, Tony. Why can’t you believe the same of me?”
Understanding falls over Steve’s face like a heavy curtain. “Oh, Tony.” His voice is soft, devastatingly so, like a handful of crushed velvet against bare skin. “You didn’t use the Gems to change me. Of course you didn’t.”
Tony clears his throat. “Yeah,” he says, turning away, “if we’re not here, definitely bring me here. I might not be able to talk, but JARVIS can help. There’s this heat thing that it helps to put on my chest, but the robots can cover that. It just” —he winces— “it helps to have someone with me. Just to, I dunno, confirm that it’s real? That sounds stupid. I mean, it’s like, to remind me that there’s nothing actually hurting me, and that I really can breathe, and that the pain is real but I’m going to be okay.”
“Yeah, you always mean it, Cap. When you say it,” Tony says, and Steve knows the hurt is showing on his face, knows he’s giving everything away, but Tony doesn’t notice. Of course he doesn’t. He’s avoiding Steve’s eyes.
Hoping to avoid the ferryman, Tony takes a tentative step into the water, as much on a spot of grassy earth as he can manage. As he hoped, it gives a little but holds firm. He brings his second foot down beside the first, regains his balance, and reaches for the closest solid patch in front of him.
, and so far he hasn’t said anything Steve hasn’t heard before—but Steve’s got time. He won’t let Tony leave these grounds until Steve knows everything about registration that Tony does.
Steve’s computer goes idle, casting the room into darkness, save for the one anomaly the scans couldn’t account for: a circle of light in Tony’s chest. Steve resists the impulse to touch it. The crisp cyan light falls diffuse over Tony’s face, luminous against the velvet shadows. He’s illuminated like the candlelit vignette of a La Tour painting. But instead of a flickering flame, fragile and insubstantial, the arcs of Tony’s face and the line of his throat are lit by a steady radiance of metal and glass. Steve wonders if it’s powering Tony’s heart. He wonders if it’s warm to the touch, if it hurts Tony where it’s set into his chest, if it feels like the tight lungs and constricted breath of an asthma attack.
Tony reattaches the chain on Steve’s collar so the length connecting it to the wall is shorter, confining Steve to the bed. That done, he tweaks one of Steve’s nipples, winks, and leaves.
Tony only obeys because trying to twist away wrenches his injured side. A new kind of hopelessness swells inside him. Steve curls Tony’s knees into his chest, presses the head of his cock against Tony’s crease, then shoves inside, only Tony’s saliva smoothing the way.
“I’m guessing you two didn’t talk about the massive boner you have for him,” Sam says, like he’s trying to be causal and mild but his shit-eating grin is peeking out the edges.
It wasn’t the first time Steve had assumed an innuendo when something really was just about… cheese.
Tony sits by the window, posture meticulously at ease, in the middle of a sunbeam that spills over the hotel carpet through sheer linen curtains. If he concentrates, Steve can hear the sounds of the street outside. If he doesn’t, he can hear Tony—Tony’s breathing, his heartbeat, the small sound he makes in the back of his throat.
“He wouldn’t,” Steve replies, holding back another groan. He can feel the scuffs in the laminate faux wood of the table through the elbows of his jacket. “He’s too polite to make a fuss.”
“Tony,” the person sighs, and though their voice is too low to be recognizable, Tony knows with utter certainty that it’s Steve.
Coming up in the next chapter: Steve's cock (again). Also featuring: the universe; Steve has a bad dream; Tony has some much better dreams; Friday dispenses medical advice.
“Sharon, the shooter—” Tony is cut off by the sound of a rifle being fired, loud and close, and Steve doesn’t know who’s been shot or if the bullet hit its target but there’s no sound of it hitting the suit or anything else, and then there’s another shot, another, another, and the full weight of Tony and his armor pins Steve to the ground, hard and cold and then warm and wet—
The water is a little sandy, and Steve thinks he can taste the desert sun. It’s the most wonderful thing he’s ever put in his body. “Y’know the way outta here?”
Steve steps through the rubble with his shield up. In the more intact areas of the mansion, the glare of the sun casts near-black shadows.
The next time Steve opens his eyes, Jan and Pepper are spooning on one of the deep sofas. T’Challa is curled into a ball like—Steve can’t help but thing—a cat. Jen has somehow sprawled even further, one leg hooked over the back of the couch, the other bent with the top of her foot resting on the ground. Natasha’s sitting mostly as before, except that her spine—still straight—is tipped at an angle from her hips, so her head and shoulders rest on the back of the couch. Rhodes’ snoring is the only soundtrack to the silent video flickering on the screen: a dog, sitting at a table with their human with a tower of Jenga blocks between them, then carefully leaning forward, using their mouth to tug a log out, before leaning back, block still resting between their teeth, tail wagging.
He’d come here hoping for a last chance to talk to Steve. Steve, apparently, came here to end this forever.
his comments on your victories in battle, leadership skills, compassion, heroism, and of course, your physique, are strong indicators
Steve knows how to do this; this is a challenge he can meet. His thoughts sharpen, honed on the siege of bodies and movement around him. He springs forward shield-first.
A voice without sound murmurs at the edges of Steve’s mind, like catching movement out of the corner of his eye. The voice is yearning. It wants to be free. It wants to help.
“If you want me to hang an American flag in the bedroom, all you have to do is ask,” Steve says, then slots their mouths together in a kiss. He doesn’t taste like snow.
There are more voices, too muffled to be clear. Tony finds his feet. He can stand, as it turns out, though he knows his own forge well enough to tell that his vision’s still doubled.
He can barely lift his arms. His body thrums, reminding him of every place Steve’s hurt him with each inhalation. He still can’t walk unassisted. Some hero he is. Tony became Iron Man because he wanted to be like Steve. But maybe Steve was never even real.
The next day Steve says he does have to get back to work, but will be back to have lunch with Tony later. Tony plays the part Steve wants him to; he smiles, and says he’ll miss Steve but of course Steve has to go, he’s so lucky Steve has spent all this time with him, and really, Tony’s recovering, he needs to rest. And everything he says is true.
Tony pulls the knife out and steps back, but instead of a mess of blood pouring all down Wormseed’s white clothes like water from a broken dam, what he sees is an overripe smile, pale eyes, and a pristine white suit unmoved by wind.
He sees it before he feels it. It happens before his eyes, while he’s wiping grease off his fingers with a paper napkin.
“The flowers.” He bends down and plucks a stalk. Several little stems branch from it, each with a cluster of small white blossoms. A dragonfly lands on it. Steve waves the insect off and lifts the flower to his nose. It smells like grass seeds, chrysanthemums, and white sugar. He offers it to Tony.
get worse at communicating with each other,” Rhodes stage-whispered to Natasha as they headed toward the medical wing.
“It’s okay, she told me she told you.” Rhodes smiles. “She has some scheme cooking, I think. I try to stay out of it. I gotta head back up, but I’ll definitely tell him you were looking for him, okay?”
The thing is, the scene is just as Tony described leaving it: the angle of the sun in the sky; Wormseed and his men still smoldering, their suits pristine beneath licks of flame; the smoke climbing to the heavens from them; the surge and shrinking of the ground, Doom standing at the center.
Steve keeps utterly still, but Tony must see some expression in his eyes because his grin widens before he shoves Steve’s face back into the mattress.
on his own power. Whatever the reason, it feels fitting. Iron Man and Captain America, just like they were when they met.
of dollars to make himself feel better, and you can’t say no, can’t be ungrateful, not when he’s given
Tony’s found a secret door in one of the bookcases. We’re going through to see if there’s a way down from the other side.
After Tony’s eaten, Steve sits and watches him. The smell of blood and sex overpowers the scent of ammonia. The pain is ebbing, replaced by a tide of white noise. Tony’s eyelids are heavy. His mind slows and stretches like taffy. “You drugged me,” he says, shaking his head against the grogginess.
When Steve wakes on the floor of his bedroom the next morning, his body is young and flawless and every bit as strong as it looks. He has a vial of dormant Extremis in his pocket, a note rubber-banded to it. It reads,
"Are we—" Tony doesn't know how to finish that thought. Or he's too much of a coward to try. "What did I do?"
“I don’t know,” Nat says. “I’ll let you know if I hear anything, okay? Now, c’mon, let’s get back to work.”
Steve shifts his weight onto his knees, relieving the weight on Tony’s chest and shoulders. His hands fall to Tony’s wrists, pinning them as he rocks slowly against Tony’s mouth. Tony’s shoulder isn’t ready for his arm to do anything but hang limply at his side, and now Steve is holding it in place, letting it take his weight. Agony wells up inside him, spreading into his skull and across his vision until everything dims.
Stark pulls himself upright by feeling along the case of his fortune-telling automaton. He leans against it for a moment, letting it support his weight, before steadying onto his feet. Honton continues yelling. Stark brushes dirt off his trousers and heads toward his front door, Honton turning with him to keep shouting.
"It was necessary," Steve replies, "after whatever you did to yourself. You might have stayed unconscious forever, otherwise."
“The computer has a bunch of holographic games in it,” Tony continues. “Tabletop games, like, chess, except, you know, alien chess, and in 3D. And regular chess too probably. And stuff that’s basically just two-person video games, building sims, racing, strategy, all that stuff. Wanna play?”
“What are you doing here?” she asked, hating the reassuring tone that crept like an uninvited guest into her voice. It wouldn’t do to reveal emotion.
It’s hard not to imagine. He imagines himself not imagining. He doesn’t imagine a world without war, without alcohol or drugs, without hate or jealousy. He doesn’t imagine a technological paradise, doesn’t imagine Howard embracing him, doesn’t imagine hearing Jan’s laugh again.
Tony dreams of a valley strewn with corpses. A massacre. Of a handful of men, meant to be fighting for freedom, mowing down hundreds of their brothers in a matter of minutes. Stark Repeating Rifles that don’t stop firing, even after the ground is nothing but blood and ruined bodies. He dreams of Union soldiers holding their fingers on the trigger and never letting go, firing endless rounds, until there’s more lead in the air than oxygen. He’s perched on a hill above, wanting a drink more than he has in his life up until then. It’s a want he hasn’t shaken; it might be the only thing he knows how to want any more.
“Thanks, Tony,” Steve says. He can see the red in Tony’s jacket again and relief surges in his chest. He’s been seeing color since Bruce and Dr. Pym injected him with the antidote, of course, and as much as his returned height and bulk should be sufficient evidence in themselves, it somehow didn’t feel like the serum was really working until he saw Tony.
In the business of espionage, there is no admitting of anything, least of all lack of knowledge. Those who know pretend that they don’t, and those who don’t carry on as if they do. It is likewise considered a weakness in other circles she’s encountered, such as among CEOs, academics, internet forums, and battle strategists. For James to even say that he lacked knowledge of something, let alone such a fundamental question, was astonishing. It was so audacious that hearing it felt as if she had stumbled upon him nude, unarmed, and asleep in foot-deep snow. Without her permission, her heart rate spiked.
Steve ends up staying after they eat, even when Tony disappears under the car again. Steve draws doodles on his phone and tells Tony light-hearted war stories that don’t feature the name of a single person, place, battle, or even weapon. Tony doesn’t press it; it means a lot to him that Steve is talking to him about this at all, and everyone has their own way of processing trauma. Tony still has those dreams about being lost in a place that’s at once a desert and a jungle, his clothes as heavy as a suit of armor, a pain in his chest that he only realized exists in the waking world because of the way it dissipates in Steve’s presence.
“Have you ever thought,” Steve says, voice quiet, low like the crackle of static electricity sparking off cold metal, “of me—I mean. Of you and me.”
Reality’s been written and rewritten more than once recently, and in the quiet of Tony’s workshop—a recreation of a place where both he and Steve once belonged but no longer fit—Tony can feel the density of if, tough and heavy like overworked dough. First the mess with Kang, and most recently the Infinity Gems—both topics they aren’t quite speaking about.
They sit like that longer than they need to. Eventually they get to their feet and set off again. Tony tells Steve some of the news from town he’s missed, and how Tony’s about to hornswoggle Victor von Doom—and has already pulled one over on Mister Wong, as well. It doesn’t much surprise Steve that all their trudging and climbing is toward a fight, nor that those three strangers are something unearthly.
