He didn’t release it until Steve emitted a low groan of bliss. He blew a breath across the hardened nub, causing goosebumps to erupt over Steve’s flesh, and moved on to his other nipple, while his hands swept down the expanse of his back to his narrow waist. “Heh. Heh. Dorito.”
Flat faced, Tony gave Steve’s opposite shoulder a slight shove, and Steve’s answering wince was the only confirmation he was going to get.
He took a few well paced drinks of water, and Steve still hadn’t moved. Tony approached him and laid a hand on his arm.
Tony was holding a giant red bow, and making a hand signal at a huge black dog, while pushing ineffectively on it’s ass. Not a robot dog, an actual dog. Tony spotted Steve and actually jumped in surprise.
“Good thing I’m stronger than you then.” Steve countered as he used that strength to slowly lower Tony back onto his cock.
This wasn’t a regular occurrence. Every once in awhile they were both bulldozed by the need to claim, to mark each other’s flesh with bruises, teeth marks, and nail scratches. It was impossible to predict what was going to set the urge off.
Fully adjusted, and feeling a little insidious, Tony rolled his hips languidly, and then suddenly switched to a frantic rhythm. His eyes shone with mischief as he maintained the eye contact Steve had insisted on.
So he moved them into a plastic tote in his workshop. It seemed the best option. It kept them safe, and they weren’t somewhere anyone could just stumble across them. Imagining Clint getting his sticky hands on them was mortifying. And he definitely couldn’t throw them out. Talk about tabloids. If he ever had to get rid of them they’d have to be burnt. And that was not happening.
“Almost there, babe. I promise. We’re going to get there. You’re going to be okay. Hear that? We’re close. So close.” Tony babbled.
Smirking, Tony prowled forward on his hands and knees. “Well, let me show you my appreciation for giving it the good ole American try.” Tony placed his hands on Steve’s shoulders, pushed him down and crawled on top of him. “And I’m going to take my time.”
Steve didn’t say anything. He just kept petting and stroking the dog and staring at him. It made Tony anxious, and he had already crumpled and crinkled the bow beyond repair by the time he noticed he was wringing and twisting it.
Now standing toe to toe, Tony firmly wrapped a chilly armored arm around Steve’s waist, whose face erupted with glee. The only time he got to ride with Iron Man was on assignment. He always wished he could actually enjoy it, but he couldn’t, wouldn’t, while in mission mode.
Tony loved the power of presentation. That even something as simple as earmuffs could highlight the boyish twinkle in Steve’s eyes and smile.
It wouldn’t be a problem if he’d had his suit. Then again, none of this would have been a problem if he’d had his suit when it started.
So now they were strolling down the sidewalk, and Steve was wearing earmuffs that should have looked really stupid, but instead were heartrendingly precious.
“Is the communal kitchen too distracting an environment for you?” Pepper cocked an eyebrow with a smirk. Some partners would have found his obvious attraction to another person threatening, but not his Pepper.
For a while their heavy breathing and skin slapping together were the only sounds in the workshop. Until Tony adjusted to the pace enough to gather his voice.
He supposed he should say something. He hadn’t said one damn thing the entire time he’d sat vigil at Steve’s grave.
When Tony invited Steve to try out some of the new gym equipment he’d been working on, because of course he was manufacturing it himself, Steve hadn’t given his answer of yes a second thought.
Light angst. Drama. Argument. Angry and shouting boys. Avengers related fight. Stubborn Tony. Bad communication.
He knew he was a good person. But he also knew good people made mistakes. Tony had no trouble calling him out on those. He just lost sight of that. He didn’t know when he stopped looking at them as a team, but it would have to change. Steve would make sure of it. It would be them vs. the world.
“Uhuh.” The child nodded eagerly, swinging his legs back and forth. “Can I have some juice, pwease?”
“Sounds great, Princess,” Tony quickly agreed, his mind supplying the words she ever so clearly refused to speak. Half of their friends and families had... left. He more than understood her reluctance to partake in the joys of science. “Though I’m sure you’re far more advanced than my tech. You could take me to school, surely.”
Rhodey sighed, carefully walking along the end of Tony’s bed before settling next to Tony’s legs, his hands running up and down his thighs. “I realized there are worse things to worry about than the people you decide to... be with.”
Which begs the question... would affection be too far for a Skrull? Maybe not. After all, Skrull Coulson had managed to even fool Fury. So, obviously, they’re not afraid to go above and beyond to pull the wool over everyone else.
Clint makes a pause and looks to the side, probably checking something on his side of the call they cannot see, but the concern in his face is clear as glass. “I think you guys should stop by before you go. We have a visitor.”
For a second, Tony fears he has made a mistake, because Thor’s expression closes off tightly, a dark cloud of worry and sadness looming over him; the memory painful, obviously, and Tony nearly apologizes for even bringing it up when that same tender, leveled yet still wistful smile returns to his face.
“It’s the Tree of Life.” Thor exhales, in almost wondrous realization, eyes wide in an agitated expression. “That is what we mean when we talk about Yggdrasil moving through the universe – it’s how the Bifrost allowed us to cross great distances in seconds. We manipulate the branches using dark energy, pushing and pulling two points closer or farther apart, so it’s faster to travel. When the two points are close enough, it’s possible to cross them like a doorway. I suspect this is what the rings of the Sorcerers do, to allow us access to his library.”
Tony tried to stay away. From both of them. It worked with Harley, more or less. He gave the kid a workshop, he even gave him a new watch for his baby sister – and a phone, an email that could reach Tony’s personal server directly, everything to make sure that he would never have any troubles getting in contact directly with Tony in case he needed it.
ring – and with a small, derisive smile, he can’t help but watch as he runs his thumb over the diamond, the band, feeling the ridges and geometric edges in contrast to the sleek, smooth plane of the band, around her long, elegant finger, in hands dexterous and gentle and, Tony remembers with a rather dark humor, small.
The turbines make the ashes and the dust swirl madly, like a storm, the world getting restless and angry around them, stirring up and awaking for revenge, for retaliation—
T’Challa gives him a mockingly solemn nod, in good humor. “Not all battles are won by charging ahead, Captain. Sometimes, knowing when to wait is as valuable as knowing when to strike.”
“We will.” Steve assures him, but his mind is slowly getting clearer, his control of his muscles is coming back and his thoughts are going
Tony can see the dread creep into Rogers just by his posture, the stiff angle of his shoulders, and he knows exactly what it feels like, because his chest tightens in the exact same way, almost like his lungs are collapsing again.
She helped. Nebula helped, didn’t she? And Tony heard the voices, the cries. He did. But… But Nebula could have just forged that – But again, why would she? What sort of elaborate scheme could she have, that would make all of this necessary? There’s no explanation Tony can find besides the obvious, even if the obvious makes no sense: She really is just helping.
“He had one.” Natasha intervenes, voice cutting, and Tony jolts with the unexpected interruption. “But he decided to leave it behind.”
Tony, fully dressed and expertly sneaking out, stops before he can even close the bedroom door, head turning so quickly in the direction of the kitchen he almost pulls a muscle.
The speakers crackle, just once, the same way it did the one and only time Tony heard it years ago, after he finally managed to put the pieces back together from the mangled mess that had been JARVIS’ memory – there would always be interference in there now, ghosts echoing between the waves, the auditory version of cracks in a mirror. Jagged bits that will never come fully close as they were before. But beneath it all, voices can still be heard.
Thor nods, though Tony is sure he has no idea what Tony is talking about. “I asked the Norns’ guidance when Ultron threatened us with the help of the HYDRA twins. I saw—” He stops, and he looks like he reconsiders his words a thousand times before he settles on what he’s actually gonna say, very carefully enunciating when he does, “I had a vision.”
“Okay, but what about the wormhole?” Bruce inquires, leaning forward so he can catch Thor’s attention. “What makes a wormhole different from those jumps? Why isn’t
“It seems he just… found it.” Bruce shrugs, helplessly. “Just like the Tesseract in Norway. It doesn’t mention anyone
“I can feel him. Through the stone.” Wanda explains, lightly touching her own forehead, right at the spot where Vision’s stone sits on his. “It’s how he finds me. And I can always find him back. When my powers started getting stronger, I started…
“Did any of you read the new ones?” Steve cuts the silence with a question so heavy, so difficult, that he might as well have taken out a gun and threatened them with it – because they all stare at him wide-eyed, open-mouthed, stunned by his bold inquiry; Or, maybe, incredulous of the so docile tone he uses when he does. “The Accords. T’Challa gave them to Scott. Did any of you ask him to read them?”
like he treats Rhodes, to trust them with all of his heart. To let Steve hand him things. To joke unthinkingly, to act like his stupid, outlandish self, being truly, completely unafraid of being genuine. Steve once thought he could only dream of convincing Tony Stark to feel as part of their team – and now he does, Steve thinks he does, and it’s

“C’mon.” Rhodey says, throwing his arm around Tony’s shoulder, pulling him towards the kitchens with practiced ease, Pepper falling into step with them easily. “I’m not letting you out of my sight until you eat.”
– sniffs loudly and horribly, wipes his eyes with the back of this hand, blinking frantically in a vain attempt to ease the bloody look in his eyes, sliding off the table with so little grace that he lands on his trembling feet with a terrible, embarrassing movement. Damn it. God fucking damn it. “Hey, buddy. What are you doing here?”
“I’m asking where the fuck are you!” Tony snaps, because he can’t do this, he has no time for this, he – he can’t let Steve get hurt just because he’s being an asshole and refusing to admit he’s in a tight spot. People are shooting at him, he has no way of defending himself, how can Tony just stand, fly, hover,
“Blocked roads stop the distribution of the food.” FRIDAY replies. “Those located closer to the source secured their own. And I fear that if this Thanos’ intention was to cut the numbers to allow more resources to those who remain… That is not what has happened.”
” Nebula forcefully holds him still as he makes the slightest motion in the direction of the hospital again. “If we go back, they will make you go back to the bed. We need to go.”
“I’m okay.” He mumbles as she pulls him up and half-hugs him again, supporting him without a question – simply pretending the past few minutes simply hadn’t happened.
He’s been waiting for her. They have a rotation schedule going on, so twice a week each of them will go around whatever city they’re in, collecting intel on whatever local conflict they can find and making sure their tracks are being nicely covered. It seems to be working. It’s been four months since the last time they were mentioned on the news, and it was in a commentary during a CNN panel, during a discussion about the possibility of including new people to the Avengers to replace its missing members.
bottom of my heart. The reason why I'm so excited to keep writing this its because you all have been supporting me and that's just amazing!
T’Challa makes a pause, and that is the only hint that Steve has that he is confused by his words. “Then what is it?”
Natasha had weaseled her way into his life so long ago that Tony had been used to have her here, to have her back and trust her with his' too, to trust her to be clever and sharp and damn sneaky, even knowing that could –

“Yeah, apparently she is.” Tony says into the speaker, even though Nebula spoke far too loud, so Rhodey definitely heard her himself. “So no shooting the blue android when you get here.”
“Where did he drop it that you found it and the government didn’t?” Rhodey asks, and when Tony averts his gaze and bites his lip, he says again, “Tony.”, with the tone that is a dangerous indicator that Rhodey is getting far too close to a subject Tony does not want to touch right now.
It sounds like there’s a story behind this assessment, Tony thinks, and he wonders what could have possibly happened for Rogers to sound so uncomfortable talking about it. What the princess must have done to Barnes,
Whatever unease he feels when he walks into that room, whatever gap he can still feel, wide and ominous, between himself and those on the other side, this is not about
“We never registered life in Saturn before.” Bruce continues, unconsciously derailing the conversation in the way he always does when something piques his interest, like he always does. Tony is actually kind of glad to see it happen, even after the end of the world. Anything that provides even the smallest feeling of familiarity is welcome. “Were there people living there?”
Tony’s lips feel so dry it’s like he hasn’t spoken in ages. He tries to open his mouth to say the words, to
“I know you are.” Natasha steps a little closer, with a sad, sad smile on her face. “But it’s not me who needs to hear it.”
Steve was at the small, quaint little diner Tony found a couple blocks away after walking around aimlessly, tending to the costumers with far too much energy for the late hour, and he had

Pepper hates it, and he knows that. They used to fight so much over it. Tony tried to stop it, to make her happy, and he thought – He thought he had been doing well, he believed that he had finally found the balance she needed after so many years of trying and failing to find a middle-ground, but then the giant
Thor had always been as bright as lightning that preceded him, boasting and strong, mighty and comforting, all at once. A presence larger than life, that no matter how he posed himself, gentle or careful or angry – because Tony had seen him angry, too –, but even then, Thor never, ever, looked
It’s ridiculous, in a way that is comforting and mocking at the same time, the way that his trembling hands immediately turn steady when he closes his fingers around a tool. Tony takes in a deep breath before he can start working, just as he always does when he needs to mess with the Reactor – the
“Is it part of you?” Nebula whispers, eyes locked on the blue hue of Tony’s nanite compartment, the bright light reflecting on her skin in a bright, almost neon shade. Ironically, the word that comes to Tony’s mind is
Steve recoils back a bit, but not enough to be perceptible. He then softens his voice, for some reason feeling like what he’s about to say has to be whispered. “It’s ok, we haven’t been spotted.” He assures her, but immediately follows with: “I need you to do me a favor”
But she made her choice. She left. Steve thought that would be it, that she would accept that and never look back, as she always did, as
when you jump across the galaxy through a bunch of them and get all warped in space-time. I’m talkin’ from experience, here.”
is the one using all my money when you ask me to buy you stuff like it’s… Rhodey? Rhodey! Don’t hang up on me!”
Tony regains his bearings first, because Nebula’s cold hands keep him grounded. As Pepper wheezes and struggles to regain breath, Tony looks up and finds Nebula’s eyes upon him, hard as steel, and the strength in them, that has not wavered a single inch since she helped him rise from Titan’s soil days ago, helps him finds footing of his own.
“You—” She begins, but immediately stops, almost coughing with the way her words get stuck, her mouth open in horror and her eyes gleaming with something that looks

the weight of their expectations, the anxious wait for his final conclusion because that’s what always happens. He doesn’t know why, he just knows it does. It’s how their dynamic works, like it always has, and feeling it come back so suddenly after so many years not needing to do it is almost jarring, overwhelming, and it makes his lungs feel tight and his mind reel, and the crashing realization of this forgotten responsibility, of this role he’s not sure he can perform again now.
any problems with Lang – which he doesn’t. Lang’s eyes are wide with sincerity, completely bare in their intentions and holding no secret intentions back, just his pure, unleashed desire to help and eager drive to do good. Irrationally, it almost makes Tony feel a little sad. A little sad, because he doesn’t know what it’s like to feel this intensely hopeful anymore, and Lang might be the only one among them who is still capable of it… But maybe that’s what they need. Maybe just one person is enough. One that is just as motivated, but not as desperate, to push them forward when all becomes too much.
“I can’t take this.” Steve blurts out, unthinking, and he immediately backtracks. “I’m sorry, Your Highness, this is very beautiful, but it’s too much. I can’t take it. You’ve done more than enough for us.”
“Your number.” He smiles. “I’m not giving you the chance to second guess this, Tony. I know you. I’m calling you, and we’ll go out sometime. Does that sound ok?”
, by his standards –, more homely, less… connected to the idea of life-risking missions and battlefields, and this bed has never really been used, just kept here in case of necessity, if someday, any emergency would force him to spend the night at the Compound and not back at home, in Pepper’s arms.
Happy 2019, everyone! I wish you all much happiness this upcoming year. Here, have a huge chapter to celebrate! And while we're here, let's get into some plot.
So yeah. The world is ending, and Captain America answered the call. Perfectly normal. Tony understands that.
The question feels a little weird in his mouth as he says it, but he can’t think of any other way to phrase it better. Maybe that’s the most accurate description Tony can make, even if it does sound like he’s asking if Bruce and the Mean Green
It doesn’t bother him. Not because it was something carved into him when he finally joined the army, because it really wasn’t – he was always like this. Focused, driven, to the point of being stubborn to a fault; making himself tall in all the ways his body wouldn’t allow him, refusing to be shoved over and ridiculed by something so fickle as appearance when his heart had so much more to offer.
T’Challa makes a pause, thoughtful, and the air between them suddenly feels stifling and tense. He gives a hum, that hum, the one that always makes Steve feel like he’s being stared down through a microscope in a mere second; And Steve immediately feels his hackles rising up, the tick in his jaw painful and tight, the grinding of his teeth loud in his own ears.
He can’t. If he doesn’t, if he’s not paying attention; If anyone, anywhere, decides to revive this dispute just for the sake of trying to gain power over them, nevermind the entire apocalypse that’s happening out there… They can’t have that. They can’t have anyone, not even the likes of General Ross, messing with the already far too delicate peace they have silently agreed to keep in order to find a solution to this. It’s no more than a thin veil of appeasement, an excuse of forgiveness, and Tony can’t have anyone disturbing that on top of everything else, or else he won’t be able to take it.
“Ross was a bastard, but we had no way of getting rid of him. Not yet, at least.” Tony says, frantically. “But if we all had signed, we could have amended them later. They weren’t perfect, but the Accords
And she looks at him; She looks at him from inside the armor he made her, enveloped by the suit he never thought she would wear, with the bright blue of the reactor glowing like a star mirroring his’, her eyes wide and desperate—
Shuri hums—the same way T’Challa does. A quiet, thoughtful thing, that sounds so loaded in such a short breath that it never fails to make him feel
– and despite their brief acquaintance, Tony sure as hell knows better than to believe this is an exaggeration. Which means Nebula truly did try to kill her sister at some point. The same sister she now promises to split the universe open and bring hell upon her captor for, which is not the contradiction Tony was expecting at
But that doesn't mean I think she fits where the MCU has placed her. I have no problem with Pepper - My problem is that I believe that her morals, at this point in the timeline, simply don't fit her role.

He stops for a moment, considering his next words, but then he sighs and says, worriedly. “I think they had something. Or it was
They don’t have to walk back all the way to the strange reality-bending door this time. Tony can hear the whooshing sounds of the circular portal before he even sees it, so unique it’s starting to become familiar, and a quick glance over shoulder confirms that it’s – yep, it’s Wong, doing the same thing Tony remembers Strange doing – holding two fingers up in both hands, holding one still in front of his body as the other makes circular motions in the air, conjuring a portal by seemingly sheer will power. Though maybe – Tony looks, trying to be sneaky, and he’s pretty sure he’s not successful, but he can
“They have no leader.” Tony mumbles, clicking his tongue pensively. “They’re just… a bunch of scared children.”
“Why didn’t you wake me up?” Tony asks, miserably, though he knows the answer will not make him feel better – he knows what this is now.
a surprisingly small amount of steve or tony in this first chapter, but don't worry. this is just a backstory.
and it hurts to think about, but he can’t help it. It’s what being too vulnerable does to him. Makes the thoughts louder. Harder to ignore. Tony sighs and rubs his hands on his face, wishing he could wipe away the exhaustion, wishing he could just

would’ve listened, and they would’ve found a way out. Tony is a genius, Steve is a tactician. They could have come up with something.
“In Scotland.” FRIDAY replies, and as she pulls up more screens to show whatever footage she managed to find from Scotland, and there it is – Wanda, being shoved inside a store through the window, breaking the glass and falling on top of chairs and tables.
“You’re always so angry! You don’t even know how not to be! You’re so angry you can’t think about it clearly! You are completely blind!”
Wanda takes in a deep breath, licking her lips and shifting her weight on her feet, seeming a little anxious, but her eyes locked steadily with Steve’s. “Yes, that’s why I think we should talk. I’ve been thinking about it, and… I want to try something.”
Not literally, of course. Very few people have seen them properly interact ever since Steve woke up, and even less people have seen them when they weren’t kicking someone’s ass or kicking each other’s ass for whatever reason. Sam has certainly seen it, and the others – Clint, Scott, Wanda, and Sharon – have been given a glimpse, but in such a hard time and so quickly he doesn’t even know how they’ve registered that encounter in their minds.
But this isn’t about him, is it? It’s not even about the team. It’s about Wanda and Vision, and this weird, complex relationship they have going on, and nothing else. Steve doesn’t get the right to prod her about this.

But then, Bucky did. He did come back. And Steve went from nothingness to an almost obsessive chase, pendulum swinging at full speed, one extreme to the other, and he hates that it does but
These two don’t know how to do that, so maybe Tony can help them. Maybe they can all help each other. And maybe the three of them, a bunch of emotionally repressed old souls who came together by sheer coincidence and luck, maybe they can share the burden on the way. Isn’t that what they’re doing here? Isn’t that
, eyes glued to the riot in front of him like a deer to a lion, body taut in anticipation to a hit, face distorted into an expression that Tony would almost describe as pained.
And if in a couple of months, it’s Steve favorite room in the Tower, it’s not like Tony didn’t expect that.
“I am quite certain there’s only one person in the world who knows what to do with this. You, Ms. Carter.” Mr. Jarvis says, quiet, and Peggy can only give him a saddened smile, a pleased yet sorrowful thing, that makes her chest a bit tight with gratitude.
, right into his face, with no fear for what Steve might do to her. “If you try to push me against a wall again I will jam my elbow in your throat, Rogers. I’m done with your tantrums.” She warns. “I
Tony remembers why the mess that pushed them apart when Thanos arrived even existed in the first place.
It’s hard to tell, especially with two spies on the house. But then again, Tony hadn’t known about Bruce either, but Steve apparently did, so information clearly goes around in odd ways in this Tower. He’s certain Steve wouldn’t
“Was it now?” Steve teases, and Tony has to lock all his muscles like they’re made of stone to prevent himself from shivering.
She gives him a soft, miserable look, the bag under her eyes deep and purple, skin with a sickly sheen over her cheekbones, hair in disarray and lips dry, and she still takes his breath. The bags under her eyes can’t hide the beauty of the blue in her irises. She pale tone of her skin does nothing to take away from the striking color of her hair. She looks ethereal and human at the same time. Tony sees – Tony sees
Thor seems all too eager to lay the gauntlet mockup on top of a table, at full display of everyone, stepping back almost immediately to watch it from a bit further away. His eyes are trained on it like a cat would watch a dog, waiting for it to pounce. Some follow him more closely than the others, eyeing the Gauntlet with varying degrees of curiosity, hesitancy, and discomfort. They are still shuffling about when Bruce, Nebula and Rocket barge in, in quick strides – until they see the thing on the table and almost trip over one another.
Nebula has to push open the emergency bar for him, because his hands aren’t strong enough. He’s probably starving, isn’t he? He can’t tell. He doesn’t feel anything in his stomach besides the ache. He sees the plaque as soon as Nebula’s hand pushes the bar and they swing open the heavy door – and the number 7 stares him back right in the face, mocking and daring, and Tony lets out a tired, anguished sigh. Seventh floor.
“I’m out, I’m safe.” Natasha says, and Tony is so geared up he can’t even be properly relieved to hear her voice. “But we have to put out the fire, quick.”
It’s a replica. A non-functional replica. Even if Tony doesn’t want to hold it, there’s no reason to let the feeling of his skin crawling get out of control.
Tony continues to gape at her, and she continues to ignore him. Tony is already bare-chested again when he finds his words, Nebula working around the bandages with a meticulous touch, trying to peek inside without removing them first.
She doesn’t spare him a glance. She holds her ground in front of the king, pushing her chest out and keeping her head raised, as if she’s preparing for a punch. But whatever it is that she is waiting from T’Challa, all she receives is this answer, quiet, in an almost mourning tone:
But it’s him that feels like they are losses. They aren’t, truly. Nothing that separates them is permanent, and even if Steve would rather have them all together, even if he
I mean, could ignore it. Canon would allow me to - As the final scene occurs in Wakanda, in an open field literally surrounded by trees, and we don't see any of them disappear with the snap (unless you want to get technical and count Groot as a tree), we could safely assume that Feige is simply shoving his foot up his mouth with that statement. Which, to be honest, he probably is, because from what I can tell from the A:E trailer, the consequences of this action won't be mentioned at all. But then, the more I thought about it, the more interesting it got. I'm not an ecologist by any means, but how horrible would it be if that was actually the case? Thanos already destroyed half our population, how much worse can it get, if we account for the loss of half of every other living thing as well? What are the consequences on a large scale of losing such a big part of our ecosystem so suddenly, and more importantly - Would it even be an acceptable plan to achieve Thanos' intent?
“How did you get the other ones?” Rogers frowns, eyes intense and mouth parted in just the smallest amount of surprise.
Because he had the time. He had. He had had the time to help Bucky with his wounds, time for Sam to call Scott, time for him to call Clint, time to
But he believes there must be a clue somewhere. He uses the old access code Mr. Stark gave him years ago to access as many files as he possibly can inside Stark Industries archives, and he’s honestly surprised when he comes out empty handed.  Howard Stark might’ve been a suspicious man, almost to a fault, but he also had been an engineer. A scientist. And scientists always leave behind annotations.
“Your shield was never recovered, Captain.” Agent Ross says, so blissfully ignorant, and Tony has to resist the urge to flinch by basically transforming himself into a statue where he sits. “Maybe it would have been better to bring a spare, if you had it.”
And Tony is not the one who came out of their disagreement with lower-body paralysis, so what can he possibly be so resentful about that he can’t handle ignoring their differences and just working together again? To beat the common enemy once more?
; Because here he is, exposing the flaws and wires of the foundation of this team they are so willing to place their bets on, ripping them open to showcase the soft, fragile insides that are so easy to hurt, mere moments after he tried so hard to give them hope.
.” Barton shakes his head. “Bastards who go around thinking the answer to the world’s problems are somehow death and slaughter? All from the same bag, Ultron, Thanos –selfish pricks.”
He says it in that tone – That tone that is not a lie, but the desperate desire to make something true, the tone all hopeless people use when they cling to an impossibility and refuse to accept any other option.
On cue, a replica of the Mind Stone, it’s small size and vibrant yellow color glimmering in the projection, appears, and next to it, images of Loki’s scepter and an entire profile on Loki himself appear beneath the marker for 2012.
“Vision figured it out. He said that if we exposed the Stone to something as strong as itself, we could destroy it.” He pauses, heavily. “So he asked Wanda to do it.”
“You did, but everyone survived. You’re fine, Tony’s fine. What does the Reactor have to do with this?”
The only reason why Tony’s breath doesn’t hitch is simply because he stops breathing at all, just for a second, because he feels like he’s watching something happen right now, something big, and not even the elusive and quiet interior of the workshop is enough to mask the feeling that suddenly rushes through him with unrelenting force.
“Could it have been exploited? The document?” Bruce asks, staring right into Tony’s face, to make sure he knows that if he

The old lady in his arms closes her eyes and trembles in his embrace. She hides her face in the crook of his elbow, sparse brows pinched in a pained expression, breath unsteady. She seems like she’s about to cry. Tony thinks she’s whispering something, because the man leans down to bring his ear closer to her, and he begins to tremble too, bottom lip caught between his teeth in a worrying gesture.
So Bucky goes, accompanied by Shuri. Once again, Steve watches them until they vanish from his sight, and he wonders if this is becoming a habit of his, watching people walk away from him, and feeling weird about it when they do.
From these two, who barely know him, or from Thor, who has more forgiveness and honor in him that Tony could ever be worthy of? And what for – because they assumed, much like he had assumed so many things about them, that Tony’s motivation is… what?
. It is a library – an old, modest one, with a cold, soft light streaming in through the sparse, small windows, illuminating the specs of dust that flow slowly through the air, dancing in mist. The entire place smells even more strongly than the entrance of the Sanctum, wooden and metallic at once, with hints of spicy aromas from somewhere Tony can’t quite place, and books, so many books, and the scent of aging pages and scrolls, of leather covers and ink, and this is
you manage to tell Rhodey you called Rogers and failed to mention the phone, by the way?” Tony deflects, actually half curious to know how this big of a problem could’ve been so easily dodged until now – but also, very eager to steer the conversation in another direction.
He presses a kiss into her hair, missing the faint fruity scent of her favorite shampoo, but he noses the strands anyway, for their softness and the tenderness of the gesture, to caress her as she is caressing him, unwilling to destroy this sheen, fragile bubble of peace he seems to have woken up to.
Sam raises a hand in a silent request for them to stop, to allow him to speak. “Dude, I don’t wanna be the voice of reason here ‘cause I’m obviously hearing something wrong, but you’re saying that Stark was trying to kill Barnes? The guy wouldn’t—”
Tony had never been in any life-risking situation until then. Not really. He'd have Happy follow him everywhere, often accompanied by another four or five bodyguards, even though he didn’t need to, because no one cared enough about a spoiled, selfish brat of a billionaire to try anything like a hit on his life – it had just been a habit. His bodyguards helped keep stalkers or anyone too handsy away. To help him maintain an appearance, to make himself untouchable, and nothing more.
But that had gotten out of his control. And when it did, he stopped realizing why it was important to even feel it at all.
Natasha fought for the Accords. Natasha distrusted Bucky, every single step of the way. Natasha is unpredictable, she could change alliances at any point in time – not because she isn’t loyal, but because she is always trying to find a way out, trying to find a second, a third, a fourth solution, whatever solution is necessary so she won’t get hurt.
“But a Bridge like that that’s kept open for too long is dangerous.” Thor continues, after what feels like forever, but couldn’t have been more than a few seconds of a tense pause. “It almost destroyed Asgard, when once it was kept open too far. The entire Bifrost had to be destroyed to stop it. Yggdrasil would have consumed it if left unattended. Wormholes work the same. The Bridges they open are not because two branches are close – they simply pull two points of the Universe together with no care for the consequences. No matter how distant, or how many other paths they may destroy on the way. Leave them open long enough, or make them large or powerful enough, and they will create a void that sinks forever, tearing through the branches of the Tree of Life and the fabric of reality itself, and when it refuses to close, the forces will have no choice but to pull everything towards its center, in vain attempt to balance its force.”
Thor steps closer to the panel, eyes lost in thought; feet light, but shoulders slumped, a stiffness to his frame that is awkward in his large body. He stares at Loki’s picture, and doesn’t say a word.
–, so they all just stand there, watching; As he curses the entire universe, the bitter hunger for revenge scratching at the edges of his voice, like nails on a chalkboard – and the universe, in return, only swallows them in darkness and cold, and does not reply.
Pepper reigns herself in with a long breath, dropping her hands from Tony’s arms and bringing them slowly to rest beside her, carefully neutral, but before Tony or anyone else can even attempt to find words that will lower the insufferable tension in this jet, Pepper asks, quietly and calmly, for Natasha to open the Quinjet door.
We're getting real, folks. These characters have been very hesitant to talk about certain things up until now - understandable, knowing how much they're hurting and how the last impression they have of each other is definitely not a good one, but that also means one other thing: there is a lot of rage and a lot of hurt hiding in there that they're holding back. That won't do. We need them to be honest, for once in their lives, because lies and omissions are exactly the things that brought them here in the first place. So now they have no choice. I will beat the truth out of them even if it seems harsh, you know why? Because they owe that to us.
of Tony’s bullshit. “But I went alone, and I’ve had a training and experience like none of you here on Terra could ever imagine – Gamora might have been the best, but I was the
“Good.” Steve puffs his chest out, just a little, like he’s proud of himself, and when Tony finally gets out a business card from his wallet and awkwardly writes his personal number on the back, it takes all his strength not to react to the brush of Steve’s cold fingers against his when he grabs the paper.
It’s done. It can’t be changed. Much like the ruins of Tony’s relationship with his own father, Tony’s feelings for his creations had been confusing, sometimes even incomprehensible, and overwhelming – and maybe, some chances had been lost. They definitely have. And it’s too late.
, Stark!” He yells, pressing his hands into his eyes, swaying precariously from side to side, as a child trying to console himself desperately. “I don’t
“I’m picking you up— FRIDAY is picking you up, ok?” Tony unhelpfully explains. “She’ll be there in…”
Past the rage and the panic, past the adrenaline pumping into his veins like a drug, the quivering of his exhausted muscles and his ragged breaths, Tony feels the hot, burning feeling of
Two days, and the air feels wrong. Two days, and the world is both too loud and too quiet, and he doesn’t see a single soul.
Through it all, even though she had never said so, not in so many words, Steve had always known that Natasha’s feelings of protectiveness for Tony ran far deeper than she’d like them to believe. For Steve, Natasha had displayed undying loyalty, far more than he deserved, truly – but for Tony, what she felt was softer, almost more dangerous in its vulnerability, and if he were any capable of giving this thought any attention, he would realize how important this is. But he can't.
What’s the point in separating now? That’s exactly why they’re in this situation to begin with – they weren’t together, and they weren’t ready.
Tony can see the yellow at the periphery of his vision, suddenly and not at all, the rough feeling of sand scratching between his fingers and under his nails, and he
“Not yet.” Rhodey replies instead. “We’re waiting for some additional information, and we might still hang here for a few hours to see if it arrives. We’ll get in contact if anything changes.”
He takes in a deep, deep breath, throat convulsing in a garbled, wet movement that makes him feel gross, humiliated and shamed, when he realizes these are the tears his body is so insistently trying to produce, but still fails in doing so. Like his body doesn’t have the energy to finish the task and fully let him break down. He
Is it weird, that he feels oddly… connected to her, in that manner? He doesn’t really know her. Tony knows that his feelings are all jumbled and messed up right now, and they probably will never be alright again, and he
” Bucky asks loudly, but then the words finally catch up to him and he blinks owlishly. “Wait. That doesn’t make sense. Cuba?”
At some points, it almost felt like they wouldn’t have enough room for everything that filled the space between the walls, the heart of the facility too full, bursting with the overflow of energy that came through it at every single moment, hope bursting at its core.
“Believe it or not, just the presence of Captain America in the room makes everyone’s wallet much lighter!”
And it’s terrible, to feel helpless. It’s despairing. Only more so after failing so spectacularly at a mission that, maybe in another time, they might have been able to perform with no problems at all.
Tony once thought, after Afghanistan, after too many sleepless nights and too much self-hatred, too many instances where he almost reached up and removed the freshly places Arc Reactor from his chest himself, he thought—
“My father.” Tony suddenly says, a flash of recognition snapping in him. “He worked on PEGASUS when it was launched. It was around the time the Expo was canceled. He had notes on the Tesseract—”
“Thanks.” Tony rasps, walking a little closer but not sitting down anywhere, still holding his shoes, looking as out of place as an elephant in a rose field. Steve places the coffee pot back in the counter, close to Tony’s reach, next to a cute, yellow mug, with a tiny picture of a cat on it. It’s empty, and Tony really wishes it
him – but he can’t imagine, for the life of him, why flying around on a Quinjet in the dark across an empty city and a sky full of ash would somehow be better than heading back to the Compound and locking himself up in his room, but Tony has never claimed to understand Barton any better than he understands, I don’t know, Lang. He and Barton were never properly close. And like the others, any knowledge Tony might have had, or suspected he had, of Barton before now amounts to practically nothing, standing on uneven and unsure ground, not nearly enough that he’d dare to make a guess on why Barton would willingly offer himself to do this, to step away from all of them, even Natasha.
been completely ignoring the other two people present in the group before he arrived, unknowingly. He takes a moment to look at them,
The dark makes him more aware. Makes him remember that the threat is still somewhere, waiting for its chance to strike, and he must not forget that fact.
Tony is slipping, his vision is getting blurry and his body is so, so heavy, his arms and legs tingling, and he will never know if he hit his head on the bench on his way down, because before he could tip over completely, he goes out like a light.
“If they have turned to ash—” FRIDAY repeats, because she knows Tony isn’t listening, she knows what is happening to him, and she’s
“What is this secret thing you’re working on?” Obie asks him on occasion, as if Howard’s answer will change magically if he keeps prodding. “Must be really special, if it gets you this focused.”
“We will.” Tony assures. “FRIDAY is working on finding surviving SHIELD agents and bringing them all to comms. Aren’t you, FRIDAY?”
“We’re becoming a full iron family now, aren’t we?” Rhodey jokingly says, but he sounds a little winded, which honestly makes it even funnier in Tony’s ears, and he lets out a barked laugh under his breath.
“That’s—” Sam’s words falter, his eyes going distracted and distant for a moment, as his thoughts and his emotions wild and out of his control for a few seconds, before he can reign himself back. “That’s really complicated, man. I’m honestly having a hard time here, because
It’s impossible not to turn and stare at the prototype sitting behind Rocket’s shoulder, not when Rhodey points at it with a deep, indignant rage, his patience straining underneath his words, pulling taut at the edge of his teeth, a sentiment Tony
, even when she’s at her most vulnerable. She sits on one of the benches and hunches over herself, her elbows on her knees, hands folded together, and the troubled look that passes through her eyes makes a shiver run down Tony’s spine.
“He can’t be obsolete! He’s one of a kind, and he’s not one of your common machines so you can keep prodding and changing him, Howard!”
Vision acquiesces, silently, and he and Wanda walk out of the apartment almost hand in hand, talking in hushed tones, as the door closes behind them with a soft click. They they’re gone, the sigh Clint gives is so long and deep that he sounds like he just left a battle, tattered and worn-out, exhausted down to his bones. Sam takes a deep breath, trying to calm himself down, and Natasha gives him a light pat on the shoulder, supportive, but she doesn’t say a word.
“I’ll fix her.” Tony eagerly offers. “That armor is the best thing I have to keep you safe on the field. I won’t have time to make another one from scratch, but repair and upgrade is easy – she’ll be as good as new.”
“Shut up, I’m allowed to admit that, aren’t we sharin’ our feelings here? You said you wouldn’t make me do this by myself!” Rocket exclaims, accusatory.
As Tony walks towards them, leaving the secure embrace on Nebula’s arms when he finds her stiff and still on her feet, his eyes run along the bots’ form paranoidly, looking for scratches or cracks, for
She sees him, eyes wide and mouth parted in a gasp, when she opens the door. She’s wearing a jacket inside. Her apartment is freezing cold.
– it rushes into Tony like a hit of a drug, loud in his ears and burning into his veins, just as impactful as Roger’s veiled concession, because if they are considering it, Tony might actually convince them of doing this. It’s not the best plan. It’s the worst of plans. Tony knows how easily this could backfire, and he knows that considering his track record, it’s not a novelty that they are doubting him. They don’t… Tony knows what they think of him. Of his risky ideas. But now they have no choice but to agree, because Tony isn’t spewing this out of his ass; the proof is right outside, in the sky, in the air, and it’s just his anxiety talking, this is the
something like this? He hadn’t been trying to tell them a sob story to make them feel pity, he had been in
For some reason, Tony doesn’t warn her to that fact. His mouth opens, gaping like a fish, but no sound actually comes out.
Tony’s eyes go wide, and he exhales harshly in a shudder, and startles a bit when Pepper suddenly moves on the other side, her faceplate sliding up again, to show her mildly surprised face inside. “So?” she says, pretending this isn’t just as overwhelming to her as it is to everyone else. “Any more complaints?”
“Steve.” Sam scoots a little closer, as if Steve isn’t getting it because he can’t hear it. Or maybe that’s just his way of trying to get something through Steve’s skull, even though all he seems to be doing is trying to shut himself off. “It’s not your fault Barnes fell off a train. I know you tried to reach for him. Everyone knows. Everyone has heard the story, and everyone knows it was an
“I’m afraid I must agree.” Vision says. “But this does seem to be a very specific concern, Captain.”
“The library of the Kamar-Taj has hundreds of scrolls and books containing information about magic in its many forms over the years.” Wong calmly says, like he’s giving them a history lesson.
“But I have to say… That when the day comes that you agree with the Accords, my friend.” He says. “I doubt I will be the one to give you the news.”
The feeling of his body giving out on him. The pain in his abdomen. The ache in his chest. The fading warmth between his fingertips. The taste of death at the back of his tongue.
You see, he does think about it. He does, because he has no choice, and he can’t escape this anymore. T’Challa has gotten what he wanted. Steve is bare, raw and aching, his heart bruised and his confidence shattered, and Natasha tore through him mercilessly, because she knew exactly where to hit. She ripped him open, and now Steve is
“Maria did not… cope well with the loss of her son.” Jarvis confesses, his tone sad and sorrowful, his heart still not strong enough to pretend to be unaffected by the memory of Mrs. Stark’s eyes, desperate and pleading, looking up at him with barely unshed tears and a silent request to
Tony hates that deep down, somewhere beneath the jumble of twisted feelings swirling in his core, the nauseating mixture of dread and sorrow, the rancid taste of blood and tears that seem to stain his tongue, he still has time to feel a twinge of too familiar sympathy for Nebula’s shy admittance, like he’s making this about
“Are you not?” Jarvis asks, not curiously, but dangerously, and the pause he’s given doesn’t feel comforting at all.
“But if you’d feel better if we left. If we stayed somewhere else…” Rogers finishes in a mutter. “We wouldn’t mind.”
is like? Just – blurt out sensitive information with no warning on someone who is kinda virtually a stranger?
What the hell. Rhodey hadn’t been joking. That thing is actually a raccoon, walking upright and wearing clothes.
“That went well.” Sam murmurs, exhaling heavily, before throwing Steve a worried glance and picking up his own belongings, picking up his pace to follow them into the palace.
“The same sorcerer that crafted the first Wands of Watoomb. Other artifacts infused with magical energy.”
“Nice. Creepy.” Tony nods in agreement, and appeased, he turns to go, taking the remaining tacos with him. “I’ll talk to Cap. He’s probably downstairs already.”
Rhodey coming outside. He insanely wants to step closer, because even the necessary wait for the jet to lad feels like too much, like a purposeful taunt, but he can’t, and so he
“Well.” Tony muses in the comms, feeling a weird necessity to keep the chatter going. “They seem to be in shock for now but I don’t think we should wait too long.”
“Steve.” Sam sighs, looking at him with sad eyes. “The guy might be a genius, but he’s not a machine. We all get irrational when someone we love gets hurt.”
“Yeah, so do I.” Tony childishly replies, but he doesn't care, because it’s true. “We can’t keep doing what we did today, spreading ourselves thin when we can go straight to the source of all these problems and reverse it.”
Tony might have had time to get used to the idea that the rest of the Avengers are back, sort of, but the general public certainly hasn’t. They don’t even have the press or gossip blogs and magazines to mass-produce quick and assertive headlines monitoring the reaction of the public, nor the reliability of Stark Industries PR and marketing department to analyze how the news of his old teammates back on Us soil were received. As far as Tony knows, as far as
Natasha reaches out and grabs Barton’s hand with a grip so strong it could hurt, and it probably does, but Barton does nothing but turn his hand and hold her back with the same strength, so much that his fingers are trembling, and he lowers his gaze, turning his head away from both Tony and Natasha, looking at the floor.
He still remembers. He’d been sitting in the dark in his living room at the Tower, nursing a half-empty glass of whisky while she’d been away in Dublin for a week-long discussion with some investors. The common floor was still full of glass and broken furniture, from when Ultron’s first attempt of an attack at them had trashed their after-party glow and disrupted the only relief Tony had in her absence. There was no JARVIS to fill the silence anymore. FRIDAY wasn’t the same. So he sat there and drank, alone, when the news came in, and in the middle of a report of what had just transpired in Sokovia mere days before, one of the commenters, with an incredibly sharp sense, had mentioned that
Steve tries not to be unfair to him, because he knows Tony uses his smiles and his over-the-top persona as a mask, as an
Shuri turns back around to him, standing in front of the chamber, checking Bucky’s status and test results in a hologram projected out of the object around her wrist. “This man is not your best friend. You don’t know him, because he doesn’t know himself. He might come out of this chamber and you might find out you despise the person he became.”
They will not leave, at least they say so. Maybe the most sensible thing would be to take a day to think, to process these suffocating emotions in blissfully empty rooms, shielded away from prying eyes and embarrassing exposure, but that is a luxury they no longer have. Where the Compound used to feel thankfully big enough that they could avoid crossing paths entirely if they didn’t want to speak, now, its emptiness is an unstoppable reminder of all the things that are missing where they should be filling up the empty spaces, and they can’t help but seek each other out, aching for companionship, or even the smallest feeling of comfort in another living being’s presence.
Nebula’s back straightens a little, as if struck with sudden realization. “When my sister was sent to track the Power Stone, she was told to look for something called the Orb. A protective barrier, between the Infinity Stone, and those who owned it.”
“And what of the others you want to find?” Nebula reminds him firmly. “While you leave to save one, others might be
”  Tony confesses. “We nearly had it. Me and… the others. The Guardians. Strange. We had him trapped and almost got the thing off his hand. He got loose, but it’s possible. We just have to hold him off.”
That might be the reason why he keeps going. He’ll tell himself it’s honesty. He’ll tell himself it’s fine. And although something inside him is begging him to just
“Uh, nothing.” Thor leans back, looking away, not convincing at all. “Well, you know, as our Captain’s trusted friend, I imagined you could help him with his troubles better than most.”
to throw himself into the war and put himself in direct line of sight of the strongest enemy they’ve ever faced; That was still safer than face the possibility that Tony had already fallen in some other battlefield Steve couldn’t reach. Of all wounds, Steve could have taken anything, anything but such a strike to his heart at that moment.
Rogers makes an awfully long pause, face displeased. “It doesn’t matter. It might be damaged, but it’s good protection.”
He won’t ask her what she said to Tony that was so insulting. He won’t drag those horrid memories back up so he can hurt her.
“They’re gonna jump from the sides.” Tony gasps, but so low no one can hear him, not even in comms, as he hovers just above the House in careful consideration. “They’ll go around, we can’t stop them all.”
They lay there, in each other’s arms, because they both know it will not last. They bask in each other’s touch, in each other’s presence, in this intimacy that is, sorrowfully, a perfect mirror of the moment they woke up, when the veil was unbroken, when the words still hadn’t been uttered. When it all was still hiding under that fragile bubble, pretending to be normal.
“Will you?” Steve asks, almost in a whisper, because now the silence around them in the street sounds deafening, and it all feels too intimate to speak too loud. Tony’s cheeks are still red –
“The world still cares for you.” Vision says, fondly. “But they are afraid. This is the first step to help them overcome that fear. In time, this divide between us will be destroyed. But we have to be patient, and be willing to compromise, on both sides, when the time comes.”
The festivities do not stop when the Captain offers him his hand, and no one halts their drinking or dancing when the man beside them, the man Antonio assumes is the Captain’s right hand, yells to the crowd to announce their leave. The Clan cheers back, raising their cups and stomping loudly on the soil, rattling metal and leather, thunderous joy shaking Antonio to his
“No civilians.” Tony says, which is true. Stats first. “No fire, no electrical discharge, but be careful anyway. It sees like the impact isn’t new. It probably… It probably fell when it happened, and no rescue team came ever since.”
“It’s in my body.” He explains, running his fingers along the line of his veins, tapping lightly at a soft spot of flesh right above his wrist. “It’s detachable, but it only works because it's inside me. I have tracking chips and motion sensors adapted to my anatomy and biological markings. I can remove it, but I can’t be sure the shock won’t cause an explosive feedback and fry the chips inside me. And my heart is not good. Electric discharge might make it stutter and stop.”
But he knew it was out of the picture. He couldn’t abandon his home, even if it were a home without Steve. He had others who relied on him, who needed him, and he needed them, too. And he couldn’t let them down.
