He slipped his arm around Tony’s waist and Tony’s hand curled around the back of Steve’s neck, pressing their foreheads together as they danced. Steve shifted impossibly closer until they were pressed together from shoulder to hip, straddling Tony’s thigh and grinding against his hip, pulling a groan from Tony’s throat.
“My pleasure,” Tony murmured.
“A wise man once said
“Coming up,” Tony nodded.
“Gimme two minutes!”
“See, that’s what I love about you: your optimism.”
Steve groaned again, then let his arms drop onto the mattress. He allowed himself one, two, three seconds then sat up slowly, letting his head hang and hoping the world would stop spinning soon.
He had three new matches. The first was from a guy who clearly spent way too much time on his looks for Steve’s liking. And the second was from a girl who Steve was pretty sure used to be a student. He grimaced. Which left him with the third match.
train of thought. Face red, he continued reading, and from what little he knew of Tony and mers, it seemed like this Bruce Banner wasn’t far off the mark. There were some things which were obviously wrong - the placement of the gills, for one - but he had the diet almost spot on.
Tony shrugged. “I like Christmas.”
With the opening statements over, it was time for them to leave the gallery and wait their turn to give evidence. The three of them claimed a bench in the hallway and waited.
. But then they heard an engine in the parking lot and the moment broke.
“What time is it?” he mumbled instead of opening his eyes to look at the clock that was right there.
“Can I stay with her?”
“You’re sick,” Steve realised.
“Why do you have to do that?”
Wait.
Once he finished setting Warren's arm, Steve left the exam room and slipped down the corridor. Pulling his phone out of his scrub top pocket, Steve scrolled through his contacts until he found Tony’s name and hit call.
"But I like other ice cream. And strawberry when Uncle Steve's not there," Evie Rose added.
Sure enough, once he’d replaced the capacitor and connected everything up, the pump spluttered into life. Steve punched the air and danced around the pump room, silently glad there was no one to see him and judge.
“Maybe if somebody hadn’t rushed me out of the house I wouldn’t have,” Tony retorted, raising his eyebrows at MJ. Then he softened his expression. “I’m sure she’ll tell you all about it.”
“I know,” Steve smiled. “Is there anything which would make you consider leaving the Army?” he asked curiously.
Then Arnie’s gaze fell to Ellie in his arms.
He ran his hand over Steve’s spine as he bent down to retrieve a pizza box from underneath the sofa, smiling as he reached his waistband.
“I’ll get cutlery,” Steve nodded.
“I did it,” Natasha whispered.
But Steve couldn’t look away.
“Uh, yeah. And you are?”
Pressing their foreheads together, Tony ran his thumb back and forth over Steve’s cheekbone, letting his wrist rub against his chin. Scent marking him. A thrill danced along Steve’s spine. He raised his own wrist and ran it over Tony’s neck, grinning at the pleased hum that elicited from his alpha.
“Woah! Sorry, Steve,” Scott apologised. Then he frowned, tilting his head to the side as he spotted Alexander on the floor. “Uhh…”
“Thank you, Your Honour,” the defence attorney replied. “Your Honour, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, counsel, my name is Jerri Hogarth. I am Mr Nefaria’s lawyer.
He knocked on the door and a moment later a familiar voice called, “Yes?”
“Alexander… is my ex-boyfriend,” Steve sighed.
“Not for another few months.”
“Hey, sunflowers,” Angie called when he arrived at the apartment. “Your favourite. Where’d you get them?”
Panting for breath, Steve let his head hang. He shook his head. Why did he think he could do anything? He couldn’t get Tony out of here, he couldn’t take down Stane. Hell, he couldn’t even take care of himself. What hope did he have of helping anyone else?
Steve hummed. “I think I probably would’ve seen you at the bar,” he mused, his lips brushing Tony’s ear. “And I probably wouldn’t have recognised you at first and then when I did I probably would’ve called you an asshole or something.”
“I’m sorry for waking you. I shouldn’t have done that.”
“Close your eyes,” Steve murmured.
“Shut up, Tony,” Clint muttered, trudging out of the room.
“He does.”
“Oh, good. I was starting to worry about my memory for a second there. Uh, why did you hire me a new PA?”
Dreadnoughts.
“I hear you, big guy,” Tony coughed, taking Bucky’s flesh hand and hauling himself up until he was sitting upright. His head swam, his vision blurring again, before settling down. “What happened?”
“Come on, buddy,” he said to Lucky with false brightness. “Let’s go home.”
“What are you doing here?” Steve frowned.
Tony led the way to the nearest Ample Hills Creamery, Evie Rose skipping along, hand in hand with Steve. Steve shot Tony a rueful smile, but Tony shook his head.
“No, I recognised his ass,” Steve said absently, shifting closer to the screen.
“It’s okay,” Tony assured him. “Come on, honey. I want you to come. Come for me.”
“He’s a big boy,” Clint replied. “Stark can take care of himself. Of course he’ll be fine.”
“Beautiful,” he whispered, flicking open the lube with one hand. “Gonna take such good care of you, honey.”
“Alright. Let’s pack this up, and ship it back to the Tower,” Bucky said. “Hey Rumlow! Make sure that shit goes to us. I don’t want it getting lost in SHIELD’s in-tray, alright?”
“You look comfortable,” a familiar voice called a few minutes later, drawing Steve’s attention from the Tumblr app on his phone.
“Yes, ma’am,” Steve nodded.
“You’re new at this, aren’t you?” Bucky growled.
Steve smiled. “Hi.”
The CEO of Dream Master Inc chuckled, pushing off of the wall and strolling towards him. From the motion of the floor and the faint mechanical rumble beneath them, Steve realised they were on a boat.
“Uh huh,” Tony agreed. “Ten out of ten. Full marks. Gold star.”
“What? Oh yeah. Turn around.”
“Thanks Dr. Romanoff.”
“Stark’s arrived.”
“Yeah, I hear severe anaphylaxis is kinda a turn off,” Steve nodded. He smiled. “Wanna head back to my place and order pizza?”
Tony sniffed. He decided to ignore the rest of his team, and dropped the cloth-covered box into Natasha’s lap. Natasha glanced between the box and Tony.
, Tony replied,
“No, into Matty’s place,” Tony teased, giggling when Steve jabbed him with his elbow. “Sorry, honey, couldn’t resist.”
“Fuck you,” he told him, before turning on his heel.
He nodded.
His eyes burning with unshed tears - and why was he crying? It was so stupid - Steve dropped the pole on the floor with a clatter which echoed off of the tiles, and strode out of the door onto the terrace. Fisting his hands in his hair, Steve gazed out over the city below, blinking when his vision blurred. His breathing sounded ridiculously loud in his ears.
“I aim to please,” Tony said, leaning forward to kiss him.
“What is it?”
“Did you go nuts at the market or something?” Tony frowned as Steve unloaded the boxes of fish and fruit.
Steve folded his arms, chewing his lip and tried to focus on Tony.
“But if I end up eating my own body weight in Jelly Beans and M&Ms then I’m blaming you!” Stark called over his shoulder and headed for the break room.
“If the timing was right, I wouldn’t say no.”
Stark huffed and when he looked at Steve, it was with eyes filled with affection and yep, they’d definitely forgotten he was standing there, Scott decided. Should he cough? Or move? Remind them he was standing right there? And oh God, his nose was starting to itch!
SLIGHTLY SPOILERY WARNINGS: homophobia, smut
Bruce smiled then went in search of his next patient with a new spring in his step.
“Good afternoon, Mr Rogers,” JARVIS greeted him.
“Definitely,” Tony nodded. “So. What was your best arrest?” he grinned, folding his arms on the table and leaning forward.
He glanced back at the photos of the mer until the bile began to rise in his throat again.
Steve fell still, listening to the sound of the strings fade into the silence of the apartment. He swallowed.
“So: Connecticut,” Tony said. “I thought the Maggia was a New York organisation.”
“Unless the world is going to end. Yeah, we know,” Tony nodded. “Pretty sure that could’ve been a phone call, though.”
“I am,” Steve smiled.
EDIT: How
“Genius, billionaire, philanthropist,” Tony provided. “Not going to lie, flying is awesome. And any time you feel like you’ve helped someone is amazing.”
But that would defeat the purpose of the justice system he wanted the country to have.
He pulled away reluctantly when the elevator
Tony hummed in agreement or commiseration; he wasn’t quite sure himself.
There was something wrong. His bed was hard, too hard. And it wasn’t soft cotton against his cheek but something cold and hard.
“Any good?” Tony asked.
Climbing into bed, Steve closed his eyes and drifted off to the sound of waves upon the beach.
“Tony,” he groaned.
“Not stupid,” Arnie corrected. “Brave. Be brave, Steve. It’s not just Ellie I want to see loved. I worry about you too, you know.”
“I thought human food wasn’t good for you,” Steve retorted.
Steve sat cross-legged on the couch, his laptop balanced on his knees, surrounded by papers, dirty dishes, and two passed-out friends. Rhodey was star-fished on the other end of the couch, a wad of papers teetering over the edge of the cushions as his grip turned lax in sleep, while Sharon was curled up in the armchair, her arms wrapped around her iPad like a teddy bear. Steve spared them a glance, smiling to himself, before scooping more ice cream from the tub and sticking the spoon in his mouth as he continued scrolling through the files they’d found on the USB drive.
But when he tried to turn the handle, nothing happened. Steve frowned. He tried it again but the handle didn’t move. He could feel his heart rate picking up, a cold flush washing over him.
“Where are her labs?”
yet.”
“I don’t know,” Steve shook his head. “I’ll be honest, I’ve never really dated anyone I met online. I’ve hooked up with a couple. But never met anyone I wanted to date.”
Once Steve was in bed, Tony returned to the kitchen to refill his water glass. To his surprise, Angie stuck her head out of her bedroom.
“Yeah. What are we gonna do for entertainment without you here? Plus, your faces are all so very beautiful,” Clint added. “I bet your pictures are the favourites in all the precinct gift shops.”
“‘lo?”
But he’d been feeling better recently. Not good, he was still a long way from good, but better. Relaxing a little more. Steve huffed.
“Do you know you can navigate using the stars?” he said, apropos of nothing. “I mean, humans can’t. Don’t. Not anymore. But it’s one of the first things you learn as a mer. So you can always find your way back home.”
“You,” Steve gasped. “I need you to fuck me.”
Steve pushed his glasses up with his middle finger. He was wearing his glasses instead of contacts today, and any guilt Tony might’ve felt when Steve told him his eyes were too tired for contacts was quickly washed away by his appreciation of how good Steve looked in glasses.
With that, he fired both palm repulsors in opposite directions before shooting forward into the Dreadnoughts directly in front of him. It was like flicking a switch; the Dreadnoughts launched towards him and Tony found himself being tossed between them, trying to get a shot in wherever he could. But the odds of thirty five against one were… well, they weren’t great. Tony could admit that. He did what he could and kept one eye on the little red dot on the map at the bottom corner of his HUD, sneaking its way towards him.
“Troublemaker,” Steve smiled affectionately. “So what’s this about a drug trial?”
“Was it something I said?” he asked.
“Nothing,” Tony replied.
“Sir,” Steve called. “Please take a seat in the waiting room. We’ll be with you as soon as we can.”
“Steve?” Tony yelled.
Wilson scrambled to get to her feet, but Bruce pushed her back down. “I really wouldn’t. Neither of us are happy about being blown up, and when I say neither, I’m not including Natasha.”
“I hope you’re hungry,” Tony continued, resuming stroking Steve’s hair. “Nat and Bruce are whipping up a veritable feast.”
“Good,” she smiled. “Then, can I give you some advice?”
“Yeah, probably,” Steve sighed.
“It’s not finding the moment that makes it perfect, Steve,” Daniel shook his head. “It’s saying
He played a few chord progressions, until something stuck in his head. Frowning, he played it again, then again, this time humming along.
“You’re not the only one… not looking forward to seeing Nefaria again,” Tony admitted. “I was back there, at the party and the bomb went off and you were gone. And then it was Afghanistan and I was being blown up again, only it wasn’t Yinsen in that cave, it was you and- And then there was that damn wormhole and you weren’t picking up.”
“You want to watch something?” Tony asked, picking up Steve’s left hand and twisting their fingers together. He stared at their entwined fingers, enchanted by the contrast of Steve’s fair skin against his own. That wasn’t where the differences ended either. Tony’s hands were calloused and rough, patches of dry skin from the amount of time spent scrubbing motor oil and other more questionable substances from them. There were scratches and nicks from working in the shop and the shiny patch of skin where he burned himself in college on an oven shelf.
“For the record, the witness pointed to the defendant,” Walters added. “Mr Rogers, Can we talk about April 13th now? What happened on the night of April 13th 2015?”
“Steve, what’s wrong?”
“Really? I didn’t notice,” he deadpanned, as though the whole room - the floor and every available surface - wasn’t covered in his belongings. Before he started packing, he thought that it wouldn’t take long because he didn’t have that much stuff. It turned out, he’d accumulated a lot of stuff over the past seven years since he’d moved into the apartment. “Are you going to help or are you just going to be a pain in the ass?”
Hanging up the intercom, Steve took the door off the latch, gathering up the takeout bags, meeting Tony at the door.
“Nothing is registering on any scans, sir,” JARVIS replied. “I believe whoever they are, they have engaged a stealth mode.”
“Darren,” Clint exclaimed with false cheer, once he finally tracked Cross down to the cafeteria. “My man!”
“Deal. Deal,” Clint nodded. “Thank you. You are amazing. Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise!”
“Because I realised I cared about Tony more than I cared about winning the fight.”
He took a second to adjust his stance in front of the bag and then he began to hit it, harder and harder, never stopping, until sweat dripped down his forehead.
“Have fun!” Tony chirped.
“Yeah, right,” Steve snorted.
Tony glanced up from the paperwork he’d agreed to fill out so Hope could leave on her date. His face fell a little when he saw Pierce entering the nurses’ station, although the double take Pierce did at the sight of him was very satisfying.
“It’s not that bad,” Tony shrugged. “You should’ve seen it after Loki. There is a reason I basically remodelled the whole Tower after the Battle of New York. Had to make it demigod proof, especially if Thor was going to live there.”
Steve straightened up, eyebrows raised. “You trying something, Dr. Stark?”
“It was not nothing,” he insisted. “And you know it. Honestly, I don’t know how you put up with my miserable, mopey ass. You probably deserve, like, a medal or something for sticking with me.”
But it was the final room, innocuous from the outside with its simple wooden door, which left the biggest impression on Steve. The door was stiff, swollen in its frame, and needed his whole weight to coax it open. When it finally swung open, Steve’s jaw dropped, taking in the mahogany panelled wooden grotto, which looked like something out of an old sailing ship.
Tony giggled, falling over on the couch and wiping his eyes with his forefinger.
Bucky sighed and rolled his eyes, sliding out of the booth.
. Can you fix it?”
The doctor raised an eyebrow. “Yeah, because people who have clearly been crying are notorious for living their best lives,” he said dryly.
“Thanks JARVIS.”
He hummed.
“You don’t have to stay,” he grumbled.
“We have the same size brain,” Steve retorted.
“Coming up.”
“What isn’t?” Tony teased, tightening the knot at the bottom of his throat before grabbing a matching vest from the hanger and pulling it on.
“You have to promise to be good to him,” she declared. Tony’s eyebrows shot up. She continued, “And you have to promise you’ll be nice to him, and you won’t make him do anything he doesn’t want to do.”
Scott’s eyes narrowed.
“Buy me a beer and I’ll forgive you,” Daniel smiled. “Come on, what happened?”
“The one who’s taken the shot.”
“Here you go,” Tony murmured, tucking her in. “D’you want to tell me about your dream?”
“Well, I’m not doing it,” Ari replied. “So…”
“Have fun,” Angie replied with a wink.
“You hired a Stark,” he repeated.
Tony considered it. Steve was busy tonight, on his own staff night out, celebrating the end of term and two weeks of freedom from teenagers with Angie and the rest of his co-workers. He glanced at the partially deconstructed Dreadnought.
“Hey, Danvers, you worked at Mass General, didn’t you?” Clint asked.
“Tall, green and full of his own self-importance?”
“Oh God,” Bucky exclaimed.
“Let us put the hell-spawn to bed and we’ll be right back,” Peggy told them. “Girls! Bed time! I know, I know,” she added when her announcement was met by complaints. “Let’s go.”
“Tony… Baby, please,” Steve whined.
And maybe Steve was meant to be with Tony.
Steve nodded, feeling a little like he might throw up.
Stane grinned knowingly. “So what department are you in?” Stane asked, removing the cigar.
“Thank you, Dr. Romanoff,” he nodded. “For everything.”
Not today.
page on her website, but he chickened out of sending a message.
“You okay?”
It was easy to forget that Bucky was a war hero when you saw him joking around or draped over his boyfriend. But this, Steve realised, wasn’t Bucky Barnes. This was Captain America.
“Like you can do any better,” he grumbled, shuffling over the tiles until he was sitting by Tony’s side.
With a sigh, he rolled off of the couch, padding across the apartment to make a BLT. His phone buzzed across the room as he returned the lettuce to the fridge. Licking mustard from the heel of his palm, Steve sat back on the couch and picked up his phone. He had a new message from Peggy with a video of Zoey dancing with Daniel.
Tony chuckled. “Come here, you,” he said, tugging Steve towards the couch. Steve curled into Tony’s side, tucking his head beneath his chin. Only then did he allow himself to relax, with Tony’s arms wrapped around him.
Tony shook his head, placing a trail of tiny kisses along his jawline, before looking up at Steve with almost revent eyes. “No way, baby. It’s been five months.”
They were lying in bed, facing each other, and Steve looked exhausted but Tony couldn’t sleep and Steve flat out refused to leave him alone when he was coming down from a panic attack. When Tony tried to argue he wasn’t alone because Steve was right next to him, Steve just fixed him with a look and a, “Tony. Shut up.”
“Looks like I’m going dancing,” he called over his shoulder.
“You wanna get up or stay in bed?” he asked, combing his fingers through Steve’s sweaty hair, carefully working the knots free.
Steve stared at him.
Tony leaned against the back of the booth, letting the easy banter of his friends wash over him and chase away any lingering tension from the mystery of the Maggia and the Dreadnoughts. Bucky was still arguing against the Christmas jumper - “You’re blind, Matty, you don’t have to look at that abomination” - and Matt smiled serenely, while Marci and Foggy were discussing the logistics of visiting both their families on Christmas. Josie appeared with their plates of wings; Tony nodded his thanks and made a mental note to slip her a fifty on the way out. She deserved it for dealing with them all year.
“Thank you,” Steve nodded.
“Only a small range,” she replied apologetically. “But we can order more, or there is a jeweller we work with who does commissions, depending on your budget.”
“Everyone in one piece?”
“You’re disgusting, Rogers,” he muttered.
When they emerged from the subway, Tony glanced up at the Tower, taking in the damage. It wasn’t too bad, he thought. Nowhere near the scale of the Battle of New York. At least he didn’t have the outline of a demigod smashed into the floor this time.
The Make-a-Match app had a bright red
“So what’s the big deal?” Hope asked, emerging from behind her locker door. “He’s your ex. Did it end badly or something?”
Tony stared at it, his thumb hovering above the screen.
“No,” he agreed. “It’s way worse.”
They made a good couple.
“Because if there is proof, it’s going to be on his computer. Probably in a ghost drive. Do you know what a ghost drive is?”
“How do you manage to see me so clearly?” he wondered.
But for the past five years, he’d stopped. Because he didn’t think he had anything to say.
Tony smiled to himself, warmed more by the fact Steve knew he was bored from his messages than by the coffee in his mug. He slouched in his chair, grinning when Steve’s reply came though.
Eventually, a strange sort of calm settled over him. Rolling onto his back, Steve heaved himself up, sitting with his arms over his knees and taking in the tree house. Typical. Rich people's tree houses were better quality than the apartment he grew up in. The walls were insulated and there were even power sockets around the room. Steve shook his head in disbelief, but then he remembered that Arno Stark died at four and probably never even had the chance to use the tree house.
“Punk,” Bucky shook his head, throwing an abandoned eraser at Steve’s head, grinning when it bounced off his forehead.
“I trust you.”
“Thanks,” he murmured.
“Right,” Rhodey nodded. “Have fun with… whatever this is,” he added, following Sharon out of the door.
“This isn’t even that bad,” he protested.
The following morning, he woke with his nose even stuffier and his voice croaking like a bullfrog. Angie raised her eyebrows at him, but Steve ignored her, pouring himself a cup of tea to soothe his throat, then headed off to work.
“Very good point,” Clint agreed.
She smiled encouragingly. Taking one last glance at the TV, Steve forced himself to move. Every step towards his classroom made his boots feel like they were made of lead.
“Right,” Tony murmured. “So that was, uh, yeah.”
“Best thing about being a teacher?” Tony asked, slouching in his chair as he relaxed into their conversation.
“Happy,” the redhead sighed, blocking his attempts to get off of the gurney. “Your heart stopped. That’s not okay.”
“Okay,” Tony grimaced. “That’s more than I ever needed to know about Thor’s sex life,” he said to Clint.
“Stane’s at a meeting with Boeing for another hour,” Sharon murmured, leading the way into her office.
“Is she in?” he asked Rebecca, who gaped at him.
Now he just needed to find the courage to say it when Steve was awake.
“You mean I’m not usually?”
“Bye,” Peggy smiled, leaning her head on Daniel’s shoulder.
Tony and Clint exchanged a look of solidarity then Tony braced himself, refusing to give in just like he’d refused to give in to the Ten Rings in Afghanistan, like he refused to give in to The Mandarin and Killian, like he refused to give in to Nefaria when he had Steve.
“Hello,” she chirruped.
“What’s going on?” he asked.
“How was I supposed to hear that? I’m deaf!”
Crossing to his bed, Steve lay down, enjoying the feeling of Tony’s eyes on him. Only once he fell still did Tony move, covering the distance to the bed in two long strides. Kneeling on the mattress, Tony shuffled forward until he was looming over Steve, and Steve felt a thrill run through him from head to toe, his toes curling in his flip flops as a slow smile spread across his face. He spread his legs, nudging Tony’s thighs with his knees until Tony took the hint and shifted between Steve’s legs.
“Alright,” Natasha sighed. “What is the problem?”
Steve recognised him from various new reports and magazine covers over the years. It was hard to live in America and not know who Obadiah Stane was. He was up there with Bill Gates and Steve Jobs and Jeff Bezos as businessmen whose fame went beyond the business community.
“I’m sure it’s just a coincidence.”
“And who’s this gorgeous little one?” Tony asked, stopping at the door.
“You look good, Steve.”
“I’m Tony Stark! I don’t need to look online for dates!”
“Alright, let’s do this,” Tony declared and stopped thrusting, holding Steve’s hips steady.
He supposed, if he’d thought about it, he would’ve assumed Tony couldn’t cook. What with the whole billionaire, growing up with staff thing. And he would’ve been so very wrong. Because Tony could not only cook, he could cook
Instead, he watched Tony shoot out from inside one of the Chitauri whales during the Battle of New York as it exploded from within, crashing into the side of a building before disappearing from view.
“You,” Steve replied. “Always you.”
In hindsight, going to a bar after all that probably wasn’t the best plan he’d ever had. But Steve changed his clothes, swapped his glasses for his contacts, and headed out to catch the F train to Manhattan to meet Tony and Bucky at Josie’s, even if he did still feel a little off.
He found a way inside the first outbuilding and discovered a workshop. Bucky would probably know what the tools were for - he’d always been more interested in mechanics than Steve - but Steve ignored them in favour of locating the elusive generator.
“You sure?”
“Yes. Screw it, yes. I’m in,” he decided.
“MJ. I haven’t seen Nick Fury since my wedding day. That was eight years ago. I have no idea where he is.”
“You think?” Hope teased and they shared a smile.
“How is that possible?”
“Not half as sorry as your boyfriend will be, I’m sure,” Stane mused. “Is that today’s paper?”
Tony nodded, “I have to leave first thing, but yeah. I can stay.”
“That obvious, huh?”
Then he took a deep breath and carried on.
As the conversation split, Tony watched Clint, chewing on his fajita thoughtfully. There was a tightness around his eyes when he thought no one was watching. But Tony was always watching.
Tony snorted quietly.
Then he leaned forward and swallowed Steve’s dick in one smooth move.
“That does not get any less terrifying,” Tony declared, landing on the deck of the Guiletta.
“Looks like you’ve got another lawyer on your hands,” Steve warned Daniel.
Yes, everyone on the night shift was at least a little crazy.
“I don’t know who that is,” Bucky replied.
Steve watched Tony race towards the elevator, shouting out instructions to JARVIS to prepare the Mark Forty Three and relay a message to Bucky. Then the elevator doors closed, leaving Steve in the silence of the apartment.
“Shower first,” Tony shook his head. “Then sleep.”
“Which is why Franklin D Roosevelt High has been chosen as the inaugural winner for our new grant,” Julie Wilson continued. “To show the importance of education for all and not just the privileged.”
A jewellery box, he realised. He flicked it open to reveal a simple gold Star of David necklace. Ellie leaned forward, drawn by the reflection of the sun on the gold, then looked up at Steve questioningly.
“Really?” Steve replied, folding his arms and raising an eyebrow.
Steve’s eyes softened.
“Congratulations,” Tony said softly. “You’re CEO of one of the biggest companies in the world.”
He racked his brain, staring out across the street, trying to figure out how on earth he was supposed to find a homeless veteran who may or may not be in the city. Unless...
“No, absolutely not!” Harry agreed slightly manically, his head bouncing up and down like a nodding dog.
As he came back to himself, Tony became aware of Steve pressing tiny kisses along his temple, a hand running soothingly through his hair. Tony caught Steve’s hand, pressing a kiss to the centre of his palm. He pulled out slowly, then finally allowed his muscles to give out, collapsing onto the bed beside Steve.
“What are you staring at?” he snapped.
“Come here,” he whispered.
He glanced up, finding Harry from economics leaning against the counter.
Steve spread his hands and turned on the spot.
Steve nodded, wrapping his arm around Tony’s shoulders, and they made their way back to the car.
“Be right back,” Tony promised. He tried to go for a kiss but Steve pushed him away, pulling a face.
“I don’t have a problem.”
He glanced up as Steve entered, giving him a small but genuine smile.
He continued along the hall until it splintered, three steps leading up to a group of four doors. The first room was empty with very little clues as to its previous use. The second had
“Tony didn’t mention anything about it,” Bucky frowned.
Bucky went through first, but Tony quickly realised the room was empty.
“Love you too,” Steve murmured.
Tony sat down with a sigh, purposely jostling Foggy with his elbow. Detaching his face from Marci’s, Foggy grinned sheepishly.
“I think you need to consider your dietary choices.”
“I could do this all day.”
“You must be Nefaria,” Tony replied, flipping up his faceplate. “Tell me, what came first; the name or the career? Or was it just a happy coincidence?”
“Shit.” Steve glanced around, but where was the best place to hide? If it was other explorers, he’d probably be fine, but it could be someone looking for a safe place to sleep, or worse: security. He was frozen by indecision, but then Tony made the decision for him, lunging out of the water, grabbing Steve by the ankle and hauling him into the pool. Steve reemerged above the surface spluttering. Meeting Tony’s eyes, he took a gulp of air, filling his lungs, then let Tony pull him underwater.
“I know you have money, I meant-”
“What do you want?” Clint sighed.
“Come on, Johnny.”
“Wonderful,” Tony declared. He glanced at Steve. “So. How did it go?”
“Feeling better?” Tony asked, leaning forward to pick up his drink.
be this turned on already. But he was, and it was because it was Tony, it was all Tony.
“And had the idea that got rid of my father for good,” Steve pointed out. “And paid him.”
Happy pulled the car to a halt outside the entrance, and Tony pasted on his best media smile as the door opened and he stepped out.
“No,” Tony smiled. “Guess not. But you’re perfect for me.”
Steve chuckled, his muscles shifting beneath Tony’s hands, and when he opened his eyes again, Steve was looking up at him with an unmeasurably fond expression. Combined with his tousled hair and kiss-red lips, it was a good look.
“I’ve never seen…” Tony frowned, ignoring Steve’s poor attempt at a joke. “They always made me look human in pictures. It never looked… You’re good.”
“Good?” Tony whispered.
,” Nefaria continued regardless. “He only fights for the Americans. Because of him, my grandparents lost everything. So many people everything because of him.”
Steve gasped for air, his chest heaving as his lungs welcomed the rush of oxygen. Suddenly, his clothes and boots felt heavy, dragging him back underwater. Steve grabbed to Tony’s shoulders for balance and felt Tony’s strong hands holding him up at the waist.
“Barton, don’t make me force feed you vegetables, again,” Bucky warned.
“Thank you,” Tony said, slipping her a twenty. Guilt twisted in his gut. “Sorry it’s not more.”
“Yeah, that about sums it up. Phil, can you let Tony know I left some files for him to look over in his office, and I need them by the end of the day.”
He watched Steve stare after him. Then Steve climbed off of the bench, wincing as he landed on his feet, before shrugging on his jacket and heading for the door.
“Do you? Because I’m pretty sure you need help, and not the kind a marine biologist can provide.”
“If it means I get to see you dressed up, I’m not complaining,” Steve grinned.
“A misunderstanding with a knife?”
They shared a glance then the door burst open and the first, yep, tracksuit thug came into the apartment. Tony threw him a wave, the distraction allowing Clint to smack him in the throat before flipping him onto the ground.
“I hate you,” Steve called.
“Stark?” Fury slurred. “The fuck are you doing here?”
Tony hissed, his knuckles going white on the edge of the tub, but he held still without complaint as Steve worked.
“Okay. Okay, hang on,” Steve promised.
“Wait a minute,” Clint’s head snapped up as he frowned. “Isn’t Liho the, uh, embodiment of evil and misfortune or whatever?”
“The door’s not opening,” Steve replied, and he could hear of the hint of hysteria in his voice but there was nothing he could do about it. “Come on, open!”
After Rhodey left, Tony went down to the storage room below the workshop, where his suits were all lined up behind glass, waiting to be summoned for a fight. Tony stared at them and for the first time, he genuinely considered how it would feel to blow them up, every last one, and just walk away. He could still design tech for the Avengers, but he wouldn’t go on missions. He could live in Brooklyn with Steve and drive to work every day like a normal person. They could return home at night, Steve could talk about his students, and Tony about his current designs, and Tony would make them dinner. And they would go to sleep next to each other, and wake up side by side the following morning. They could get married, have children, all the things they’d talked about.
“Awesome. I better call Pepper, give her a heads up. Then let’s beat Lady Gaga to 20 million followers!”
“Don’t turn off my music,” he called automatically.
“I’m sure you could’ve figured it out anyway,” Steve declared loyally.
“Just for that, I’m not getting you any more of that salmon you liked,” Steve warned.
“You always have a concussion. It’s your natural state.”
Stark grinned. “I love that movie.”
“Nailing this parenting thing,” Tony joked.
“Steve,” Arnie said gently. “Take it from an old man. Let yourself be happy.”
“That’s not the problem. The problem is, you’re flirting with Stark and you’re
“I can always ask May to pay him a visit and ‘suggest’ that he stays away,” he joked.
“Hey Steve,” Sharon called.
“Oh. Okay.”
“Debatable,” Bucky murmured.
“That’s disgusting,” Steve grimaced.
Daniel nodded, pulling a small velvet box from a bag and flicking it open to reveal a pair of pearl and diamond earrings.
“Okay, that’s creepy,” Tony grimaced.
Tony cut Steve off by pressing his hand to his mouth.
They froze.
“I will draw up a contract and get in touch with your father’s lawyers,” Marci said. “And oh my God, I can’t believe who he has as lawyers. It’s going to be so easy to get them to do what we want. I doubt they’ve ever seen the inside of a courtroom. Once I have everything arranged, we can arrange a meeting to get it signed and then you’re free.”
“Uh, Steve, this is Matt. Matt, meet Steve,” Bucky explained. “You coming to get coffee with us?”
“It is. There is no tactical advantage to this attack,” Coulson agreed.
Tony looked up. “Dr. Pym,” he greeted. “I heard you were in charge around here these days.”
“Tony?”
Turning back to the staircase, Steve made his way upstairs with a thrill of excitement. He glanced into the first open door and instantly did a double take.
“I’ll meet someone in real life,” Tony protested. “How did you two meet anyway?”
“Because you need one. I’m CEO now, Tony. I can’t be running around after you all the time.”
“Yeah,” Clint grinned lopsidedly. “In the middle of the Battle of New York. You didn’t know me. I just turned up with Cap and Tasha, and the last thing you knew, I was shooting at you. But you never even blinked at me suddenly being on your side.”
Well, technically his morning started two hours earlier, but Tony didn’t count the day as officially beginning until he received his first message from Steve. On weekdays. On weekends, when Steve didn’t have to get up for work, it was a different matter entirely, because he could, would, and indeed had happily slept the whole day away when he didn’t have to work.
“Would you back off?” he snapped. “Jesus Christ, just leave me alone!”
“Stop drinking out of the pot, you heathen,” Tony scowled. “Who says I love you anyway?”
“That would be all kinds of embarrassing,” he finished. “I mean, did you know they were together?”
Then Steve felt a pair of lips brush against his temple.
“You’ve heard of Daredevil, right?” Natasha said.
“Thank you, Steve.”
“So what was wrong with him?”
“This is our stop,” Steve murmured, nudging Angie, because he was pretty sure she was two seconds away from snoring.
Alexander held Batroc's gaze head on, standing steady in the face of his anger and disgust.
“This is a little weird,” Tony admitted, glancing around the room.
mean what Steve hoped he meant. Even if he was looking at him that way, the same way Rhodey looked at Sharon sometimes, like she was the most wonderful person in the world.
He tiptoed out of the spare bedroom, closing the door carefully behind him. Steve glanced up from clearing up their pizza boxes.
“Really?”
“Since when?”
Tony was in heaven.
“Nope.”
“Oh, that’s just great. I try to reassure you, and you turn it around and make me feel worse!” Tony teased, punching Steve’s shoulder. But then he pulled Steve into his arms, kissing him gently. “You’ll be fine,” he promised. “And if you’re not, just give me the wink, and I’ll point out to Barnes that Barton isn’t eating his vegetables and we’ll have to watch Captain America force a grown man to eat broccoli, and then we’ll all feel equally awkward.”
“Yeah. I had to ditch the helmet. Hannah objected. Violently. My Leia is around here somewhere.”
“I know, honey,” Tony laughed, drawing him in for a kiss.
“She’s not watching,” Steve pointed out.
Steve and Tony shared a smile and Tony felt a thrill of excitement run down his spine.
“I’m sorry, I think I misheard you,” Stark said, raising his voice over the drunk as he shouted angrily but keeping his tone pleasant. “I think you meant to say
“Objection, Your Honour. Relevance?” Walters called.
“Now, over here we have a mighty warrior, Thor,” Steve continued, crossing to the bed on the other side of the room, where an eight year old sat holding a plastic Mjolnir. “AKA Donnie.”
Steve nodded, watching his hands as they twisted together in his lap.
“Not well at all.”
Tony laughed.
“You’re not getting away with this,” he decided.
“It wasn’t my first try,” Steve replied, silently repeating Peggy’s advice not to give them any more than they asked for.
Useless. He was useless.
Clint gaped at the two of them because no. But it almost sounded like- No. No? No. But it almost sounded like… they were having the same conversation? Steve’s face was unreadable, but Clint had played poker with that asshole and knew he had a stone cold poker face which led to Clint losing two hundred bucks to a lousy pair of twos. But Stark’s eyes were dancing with mirth, even as his face remained impassive.
“Yes!” Evie Rose squealed, punching the air with both hands and spinning around.
Everyone in the bar looked uncomfortable or annoyed, but no one bothered to say anything. Steve glanced back at the woman from earlier. He took in her clenched jaw and glassy eyes, then returned to glaring at the asshole. From the corner of his eye, Steve saw Josie give the asshole a dirty look, before ignoring him and continuing to take orders.
“What I’m saying,” he continued, leaning forward, “Is that if Clint is showing cracks, then he wants you to see them. He wants help, despite all appearances to the contrary. He just doesn’t know how to ask.”
She kissed his cheek. “See you in there.”
“Older than six,” Tony replied, causing Steve to snort with laughter. “And do you have to babysit him often?”
Matt rolled his eyes.
“It’s festive,” Matt replied brightly, a shit eating grin on his face as he proudly showed off his jumper depicting Santa Claus riding on the back of a tyrannosaurus rex, with tiny coloured lights flashing in the place of the stars.
“You only call me sugar bear when you want something, so what do you want?” Rhodey asked.
“Right,” Steve muttered, grinding his teeth and glaring a little at Rhodey and Sharon’s backs. It wasn’t their fault, he tried to remind himself. They didn’t know Tony. They didn’t know that he
Steve’s chest heaved as he gasped for breath.
“Steve, Ari says that the Avengers aren’t here but you have it under control?” she hissed. “Please, tell me what-”
“You’re welcome. Thanks for your help.”
“You’ve got me,” Steve whispered. “Forever.”
“I’ll make you a deal,” he announced. Tony eyed him warily. “You don’t stab me, and I’ll help you get out of here. Somehow. I haven’t worked out how yet, but in the meantime I’ll help you get better and clear out some of this shit in the water. Deal?”
“Do I have a new PA?” he asked.
“So I’m not getting breakfast with you. I have a husband.”
“Guess they noticed,” he continued, angrily swiping away a few stray tears. “Because then… Then one day there was this thing, this machine. And I’d never seen anything like it. And it was just sitting there.”
“Uhh… I think…” he began. Tony watched him. Steve swallowed. “I’m gonna…”
“Steve…”
“Happy’s on his way,” Tony announced.
Johnny let Dr. Stark lead him inside because it felt so good to have someone show genuine care and concern for him. He’d almost forgotten what that felt like since his dad went to prison and his sister left for college. And even though he knew it would just hurt more to go back to no one caring afterwards, he let Dr. Stark pull him along like a moth to a flame because he was just a kid and he was tired.
Steve cocked his head, raising an eyebrow. He glanced around the room until he met Natasha’s eyes; she smiled and rolled her eyes. Steve chuckled.
“You’ll do great,” Tony smiled. “I know it.”
“Yeah, got it.”
Tony snorted. “Wow. That’s funny. Well done. Not a lot makes me laugh these days, so top marks.”
“I did it,” he announced, emerging from the basement.
Steve replied by flipping him off, but he followed Tony back to the VIP area where Steve decided to up the ante by sitting between Tony’s legs. Which resulted in Tony’s hand curling around his thigh, dangerously close to his dick, and squeezing.
Tony nodded but he looked pensive.
Tony found Steve slumped on the floor, leaning over the trash can, his skin pale and with a sheen of sweat. Tony’s heart jumped.
“Now, I make a call to social services,” Tony explained. “And find out if they’ve noticed they’re missing one fifteen year old yet. Then I can help you with everything if… If you want her to stay.”
“I saw them putting Clint and another guy into a trunk.”
“Hi troublemaker. Going to introduce me to your boyfriend?
He hated watching Tony walk out of the door and had to fight the urge to run after him, gathering him up in his arms and refusing to let go. Logically he knew Tony was keeping the world safe, but emotionally he wanted Tony here, with him, where it was safe.
“Long story.”
“Yeah. I mean, I’ve never really been around one, or held one, or anything but they’re cute as hell and a lot less annoying than adults.”
Then the weight of keeping himself became too much. He managed to pull out slowly before falling onto the mattress next to Steve. Steve tilted his head towards him and Tony had no choice but to kiss him because he loved this ridiculous, impossible, wonderful man more than he thought possible.
Steve’s face softened. He smiled. “Because I kept the flowers, Tony,” he explained softly. “I keep all of them.”
“Hey, he’s a Dodgers fan. I was always gonna like him. Plus he’s hot,” Bucky added. “Not as hot as my boyfriend, but still hot. How was Malibu?”
The problem was, Steve mused as he waited for Tony to arrive at Nerd Be Cool on Tuesday afternoon, he didn’t know what the problem was himself. It was related to the books, he knew that. He just didn’t know why. Why Tony giving him the books bothered him so much. He couldn’t look at them, could barely stand to have them in his room, which was crazy.
“Huh?”
“So who is this guy anyway?” Daniel asked.
“What if you’re wrong?” Steve muttered, running a hand through his daughter’s hair. “Tony, he’d do anything for the people he cared about. Without hesitation. It’s just how he is. What if- what if this doesn’t mean what you think it does?”
“Technically,” Steve rolled his eyes. “A little.”
“You’re good,” she nodded.
Steve fumbled on the table, before raising a foil packet triumphantly.
She wriggled in Steve’s arms, reaching for Tony.
They chatted for a few more minutes, before sitting on the roof in New York in January became too much for Tony. When he returned to the apartment, Steve looked up and announced, “I didn’t puke.”
“Wh’t is it?” Steve asked, rolling onto his back.
Steve nodded.
Tony laughed, his heart swelling with love for this ridiculous man he was completely and utterly head over heels for.
“I know. But going to the casino isn’t going to fix that.”
“Yeah,” Steve nodded.
He stopped for lunch, wiping the sweat and soot from his forehead with his shirt and sat with his feet in the pool as he ate a sandwich, hoping Tony might appear to talk to him. No such luck.
“Advanced years,” Tony muttered. “Honestly. Why do I put up with you?”
“You’ll be fine. The Avengers’ll love you.”
“Then go naked.”
“Okay,” Steve replied, “First off: if you’re a narcissist, by very definition you’re self-centred, so.”
“Fuck,” Ari exclaimed. “And the rest of the Avengers?”
The door opened and Steve wandered in. Clint glared at Banner and made a slashing motion to silence him before smiling brightly at Steve. Steve eyed him warily.
Steve smiled. He really loved Tony’s apartment.
“Whether or not they’re smart enough to cover the roof first before making their move.”
Steve relaxed, melting into the concrete and gulped for breath. He jerked in surprise when something touched him; a hand, splaying across his shoulder blade.
They watched her disappear upstairs with a smile, then Steve settled back into Tony’s side. Tony’s finger drifted over his jaw, tilting his head back before leaning in and kissing him slowly. His hand drifted down over Steve’s chest as they kissed, flicking open the buttons of his blazer. Steve’s breath hitched. He shivered, the callouses on Tony’s hands rough against his bare skin.
“Shit,” Steve gasped, collapsing onto the floor.
“Nothing,” Tony smirked. Then he backflipped into the pool, his tail spraying Steve with water.
Steve banged on Angie’s door, knocking again when the only response was a muffled grunt. The bedroom door yanked open and Angie glared up at him from beneath a frankly impressive mop of bedhead.
“Wait until Sam’s been gone more than a month,” Steve said. “Then you’ll get it.”
“Thank you,” Steve said and when Clint leaned back to glance down, he found Steve looking at Stark with a dopey expression on his face.
They were too wound up to take things slowly. Steve peeled off his blazer, balling it up and tossing it into the corner while Tony shucked his jumpsuit. His slacks stuck around his thighs, but then Tony was there, dexterous fingers untangling the material and pulling them free. Steve pulled Tony back into bed and they tumbled onto the mattress in a tangle of limbs. Then Tony had the lube because he was a genius, drizzling it over his hand and wrapping it around them both.
“I don’t want him getting your money,” Steve told Tony.
Tony’s eyes followed the movement, sending a prickle of lust down Steve’s spine. It would be so easy, so very easy to lean forward and kiss Tony. He swallowed, picking up his tea and taking a long drink, which turned out to be a very bad idea, because now Tony was staring at his throat, and was it just him, or was it hot in here?
So Tony decided to drop it for now, focusing on the three adorable children in his midst. Hannah claimed him as her own personal climbing frame, while Evie Rose loudly declared again that he was her best friend, while leaving sticky handprints on the couch. Zoey challenged Steve to beat her at whatever video game they were playing, and it was one of the best nights Tony could ever remember spending.
“I hate you,” Steve deadpanned, even as his heart fluttered at the thought of Tony taking care of him again.
Tony nodded, fidgeting with his phone, twisting it in his hands.
After several false starts and eight pages of results, Steve stumbled upon an article entitled
And the moment was gone.
“The Yankees,” Evie Rose replied promptly, with far too much innocence to mean anything good.
“Alright kids, sleep tight, don’t let the bed bugs bite,” Tony called, pulling Steve to his feet.
“Be safe,” Steve called.
Steve glanced at his laptop, sitting closed on the coffee table, then down at his guitar.
He continued through the upstairs of the house, exploring the master suite, marvelling at the chandelier which hung above the entrance hall, and grimacing in horror at the room whose decor could best be described as the most hideous Hawaiian shirt Steve had ever seen. The worst part was the matching bathroom. He snapped several photos, both for himself and to send to Bucky, as he made his way through the house.
“Under the sink,” Tony nodded.
Well. That took an unexpected turn. Of all the things Tony might’ve hypothesised as the issue, that… that wasn’t one of them.
“With Nat, who knows,” Tony chuckled.
Steve was willing to bet it was the second one.
It was good.
“So you would be in favour of going on an actual date? Not that this isn’t great, this is great, I just, I mean-“
“What, like
The next day they returned to the courthouse together. Tony was called first, so Steve left Bucky in the hallway and found a seat in the gallery to support Tony. Unfortunately, this had the disadvantage of leaving him open to Nefaria’s disquieting gaze for the second day in a row. Steve gritted his teeth and tried to avoid looking towards the dock, keeping his eyes on Tony.
But Arnie was in London on leave. When Steve realised that he couldn’t survive several more days of this, he’d called up his old friend and asked him to help him through his heat. Arnie took one look at Steve’s pained expression and agreed.
“Guess you’re right.”
Then Tony turned a little, following Stane, and something glinted below the surface, catching the light from one of the stray beams of sunlight sneaking their way into the room.
“What, you on a promise or something?” Bucky teased.
Hope sighed and studied him for a long minute, and Clint was just beginning to resign himself to the fact that it wasn’t happening when she said, “You owe me.”
“You come out on top in this ranking of Tony’s past relationships,” Angie added, without looking up from her phone.
Tony snorted. “I hardly saved you, Steve. I came in at the very end.”
“Sorry about that,” Natasha apologised. “As I was saying, I’ll get a nurse in here and we’ll get your arm plastered up and then you can go home.”
“Really? Never would’ve guessed.”
Steve winced, ducking his head. Tony chuckled again, cupping the back of Steve’s neck, nudging his head up until they were looking at each other.
“Shut up,” Steve snapped.
but when he opened his mouth, what came out was, “You stabbed me!”
Sure enough, there it was in black and write, under the CNN logo:
“I picked the lock on the handcuffs, knocked out the guard, stole his glasses and his gun then shot at you. Sorry about that by the way.”
“They’re pretty cool,” Clint nodded.
you could do is reciprocate.”
“Did you manage it?” Steve asked quietly. He’d never heard Tony mention anything about his life before the Starks.
“S’okay,” he shrugged. “I woulda blamed me too. I mean, look at my dad.”
“Fuck you!” he spat and a fire burned in his veins as he realised
“There’s someone I wanted you to meet,” Steve said, hearing his voice become choked. “And I wanted to do it in person.”
“I want you to blow me,” he declared. “And I want your fingers in my ass.”
Eventually, all of Maria Stark’s papers were gone, the final batch smouldering in the bottom of the oil drum. Steve returned to the office one last time, glancing around the now empty walls and drawers just in case he’d missed anything. Then he left the room, pulling both hidden doors closed behind him, double checking they were properly shut before making his way downstairs.
“Alright, so we can look on the Secretary of State’s website for the company details,” Rhodey explained. “If we do a business search for… Stark Industries. And here we go. Statement of information. Corporate name… address… Ah! CEO: Anthony Edward Stark. Stark’s the CEO.”
Tony nodded. “Hey Thor, pass the guacamole. Thanks. Want Some?” he offered Steve.
No. No, it wasn’t possible, because he knew Steve, and he knew Steve wouldn’t do something like this. JARVIS ran a background check, way back when they first matched on Make-a-Match, but more importantly, Tony
“I’ll think about it,” Steve shrugged, but he’d already made up his mind that it wasn’t happening.
Steve rolled over in bed, caught in that place between sleep and wakefulness thanks to the knowledge that he was in a strange bed. He reached out blindly for Tony but instead of his boyfriend, his hand met warm but empty sheets.
“And you’re disgusting,” Angie retorted.
“You wouldn’t.”
“Most dreams are,” Tony agreed. “Just remember that when you’re scared: dreams are silly. They can’t hurt you. And if you’re still scared, come and wake me or Uncle Steve, and we’ll protect you.”
“No idea.”
“I know what it’s like in Afghanistan,” Bucky barrelled on. “I’ve been there, remember?”
“It’s weird seeing all of them out of suits,” Sharon whispered.
“Right. Don’t tell Clint that Sharon’s dating Natasha,” Scott nodded.
“It’s over,” Steve reminded him softly.
“Yes.”
Very creepy, but Clint didn't want to insult the man offering to bend the rules for him.“Why do you think I want to get rid of it?”
“Sure. C’mere.”
But when he walked in, she flushed and wouldn’t look him in the eye, directing him straight into Edwards’ office without a word.
“Thank you.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“The prosecution calls Steve Rogers,” the Attorney announced.
But if he was being selfish - and he wanted to be selfish, he really wanted to be selfish - he would say it wasn’t enough. He wanted everything even though he already had so much more than he thought he would ever get. But he wanted more.
“What, you want him to die?” Tony asked, defensiveness written in his every sinew.
“True,” Tony agreed, dropping a series of tiny kisses on the freckle until Steve was squirming under his hands, his breath growing short. “But it’s part of you, which means I love it, because I love you.”
“Okay,” Tony announced, dropping his hand and closing the contract. “I’m good.”
“That one,” Tony declared, pointing to the cat in the second from last cage. “That’s Natasha’s.”
“Sure,” Steve nodded and, even though it was the last thing he wanted to do, he left his desk to assist her.
and Tony was tapping away on his tablet, Steve found the courage to say, “Um, Tony? After everything we spoke about yesterday, well, uh, I know we’re not there yet, but… I’d move to Manhattan for you.”
“Okay. And you don’t think Dr. Pym’s going to be mad I went over her head?”
Once the bedroom door closed behind her, Tony pressed a soft kiss to Steve’s temple. Gathering his courage, he whispered, “I love you.”
“Definitely,” Tony hummed, tucking himself back into Steve’s side and dropping a kiss onto his chest.
Then she grabbed the front of his shirt, yanked him forward and kissed him.
Steve tried to ignore him, since Tony seemed determined to be difficult.
“It’s a surprise.”
he wondered, as he began to tear the papers from the wall.
“I wanted to run something by you.”
“I know what it is.”
Tony smiled, before leaning down and brushing his lips against Steve’s temple.
“Can you do something for me?” Tony asked.
“Oh, you’re Hammer?”
“I need twenty thousand dollars.”
“No, they’re not. And I can’t believe these dummies are allowed to say that crap on air,” Steve scowled. “They should be working for Fox if they’re going to start spewing that kind of garbage. Assholes.”
“Mr Stark,” he greeted. At least the kid seemed to be able to be around him without shaking, that was an improvement.
But Tony was looking at Ellie like she was the greatest thing he’d ever seen.
“Did you forget that was what we were doing?” Tony teased.
, I finished my last exam. And I collapsed into bed and slept for eighteen hours. Bear in mind I’m a six hours a night guy tops. Eighteen hours later, I stumble into the kitchen and Rhodey hands me a mug of coffee, and I swear to baby Tesla, it was the greatest cup of coffee I’ve ever tasted.”
Huffing, Steve reached back to adjust his pillows before switching to YouTube for videos made by other explorers. He skipped through the videos until he found the swimming pool, but there was never any sign of anything in the water. After watching four different videos with the same result, Steve sighed and admitted defeat.
“I do know that.”
“The code has a code,” Clint explained, resting his unshaven cheek against his fist. “And that code has code. And then
They turned towards the court official standing by the entrance to the courtroom. Steve’s gut twisted with nerves. He swallowed.
Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Tony disappear underwater, but he didn’t look round, didn’t dare. He kept looking at Stane, pain shooting through him as his muscles seized.
Steve’s heart leaped. Turning his head, he pressed a kiss into the centre of Tony’s palm. “Good. Because I’m not going anywhere.” He picked up his phone. “Ready to do this?”
“Good,” Steve said. “It was good.”
Steve managed a shaky smile, brushing their lips together. “Love you too.”
“Yeah. I got kids who are involved with Stark Industries different social projects,” Steve explained. “And we dressed them up in Avengers merch and they spoke to the investors about the projects, and I had Angie there to talk about the benefits of One to One, and I contacted Dr. Helen Cho who’s been working with medical research team - she’s really interested in working more closely with you and Bruce, by the way - and it went really well. Fujikawa is already talking to Pepper about getting an exclusive partnership.”
Before he realised what he was doing, Steve had ripped the picture to shreds, crushing the pieces in his fists, his nails digging painfully into his palms, but what did that compare to everything Tony’d gone through?
“I have this lump,” Bobbi explained. “I’ve had it forever, but it’s really creeping me out and I feel like it’s more prominent. But I don’t have insurance so I can’t go to the doctor unless I want to pay through the nose for them to dismiss me.”
“I need to make an investment.”
“Wait, if we’re eating fajitas, where did the pizza come from?” Steve frowned.
“Yeah. See you then,” he echoed.
“You love it,” Steve panted.
Natasha laughed and drew her into her arms. “So. Can we try and make decisions together from now on?”
“Hopefully not too long. The department is kinda backed up, I’m afraid. I’ll let you know as soon as we know.”
Then everything exploded into fire and noise.
“Yes, Mr Rogers, come in,” Ms Edwards called. “Close the door.”
“Still counts.”
Receiving affirmatives from everyone, he made his way through the crowd to the bar, waving to catch Josie’s attention.
“Sap,” Tony smiled. “I love you too. Alright, let’s hit the road. Or the airways. Whatever, let’s-”
Then it was like a switch was flicked; Tony yanked off his own jeans and boxers - when he lost his shoes, Steve didn’t know or care - and fell back on top of Steve, their mouths fumbling together as Tony pressed him into the mattress.
“Why? It’s accurate,” Clint shrugged.
“Wait, really?”
Evie Rose huffed.
“Oh, I used to be smaller,” Steve explained. “I guess I could try and find the instructions on the internet? Maybe… Maybe I can figure it out. It’s worth a shot, I guess.”
“Mr Rogers and attorneys,” she announced.
Steve nodded, his mouth too busy stealing yet another kiss from Tony’s to answer verbally but yeah, he was down for Tony’s plan. They stumbled towards the bed, shedding their clothes as they went, until they tumbled down in a tangle of lips and limbs. Steve rolled them over until he was on top of Tony, then began kissing his way down Tony’s torso, licking and nipping at his tanned skin. Tony groaned appreciatively, arching his back to get closer to Steve’s mouth.
“I’ll bear that in mind.”
Tony flicked his tail, spraying Steve from head to toe in water. Steve blew the water out.
“I’m gonna try. Goodbye Tony,” Steve said, managing a smile for him. “Enjoy your life. You deserve it.”
“And it’s good practise,” Tony added, hoping that Steve would attribute the pounding of his heart to the orgasm.
“Don’t put yourself down,” Foggy teased, and Tony waved his middle finger in Foggy’s face. “No, seriously. I think we should do it,” Foggy laughed. “Hey Marci, pass me my laptop.”
“It’s not that bad.”
Either way, Bruce wasn’t ready to give up on his patient.
recognise his ass too?” Scott exclaimed.
Natasha brought the quinjet down onto the landing pad smoothly, the wheels touching the ground with nary a jolt. Reluctantly, Tony opened his eyes and allowed Bucky to haul him to his feet. He stretched out the kinks in his spine, watching Bucky swing the shield onto his back before leading the way off of the jet.
Daniel chuckled and shook his head, leaning in to kiss Angie’s cheek.
“Okay, three things,” Tony panted, sucking on Steve’s neck. “Lube. Condoms. What do you want?”
He found the First Aid kit in the bathroom cabinet, fishing out the thermometer before returning to the bedroom. Steve was bundled up underneath the covers, shaking and looking thoroughly miserable.
“No,” Steve smiled.
“Now you're talking.”
The little voice in his head told him to walk away before he did or said something he would regret. Just walk away.
“I… might have an idea.”
“If you don’t want to be castrated, you’ll get us more coffee,” Natasha glared.
“And?”
Joseph started to laugh, a sound so cutting that Steve flinched.
on Tumblr whose amazing mer Tony art helped inspire me, specifically
“Yes,” Angie exclaimed quietly with a fist pump.
“Don’t bullshit me, Rogers.”
“You okay, honey?”
Tony opened his eyes.
He jumped when Tony went, “Shush.”
His face like thunder, Johnny pushed past May and Sharon, disappearing out of the cubicle.
He moved back from the water; he might be giving Tony his knife back as a show of good faith, but Steve’s faith wasn’t that good. He was staying well out of stabbing range.
Tony chuckled, running his fingernails over Steve’s spine once more until he arched like a cat. “Some people would say my ego’s big enough without you inflating it.”
“Et tu, Brucie? That hurts,” Tony declared, pressing his hand to his chest in mock pain.
“Well, someone did try to kill us and kidnapped my boyfriend,” Tony shrugged.
With one final lingering kiss, Tony sat back, pulling his t-shirt over his head and Steve just stared. Technically he’d seen Tony naked before, the night they sexted, but the pictures were nothing compared to the real thing. Steve’s brain stalled, his eyes drinking in the sight of Tony in front of him, all compact muscle and a lattice of scars littering his torso around the blue light of the arc reactor.
He hated feeling powerless.
“No. Of course not,” Lang laughed, a little too loudly. “Why would it be? Okay… Yeah. Good chat, I’m gonna go.”
“The last time Mr Batroc here visited our ER, he objected to being treated by a queer nurse,” Steve replied. “Afraid he might catch gay cooties. I see you’re still as bigoted, Mr Batroc.”
“Glad to hear it,” Tony chuckled, leaning down to kiss the top of his head.
Cross hummed. “But Stark, though?”
“What’s she like?” Steve asked.
“Now he’s buying a building. Not a house, a building. He was very clear on that.”
“Why do you care anyway?” Coulson asked.
“When did you get the lube?” Steve gasped, his nails scratching Tony’s shoulder.
“You astound me. Okay, first we need to confirm who actually owns the company.”
“Make a hole,” a second voice called and Steve looked up sharply.
“This suit is Tom Ford,” Tony replied. “It doesn’t come with a lock pick. That’s an optional extra. What about you? You worked in a circus. Are you telling me you can’t get out of some ropes?”
Steve lost the ability to breathe.
And Steve watched his daughter and his alpha and thought
“Like locking me in a closet again?” Steve asked dryly, ignoring the shiver running down his spine and refusing to let those memories back into his head. “No. I’ve barely seen him and when I have, he’s been perfectly polite.”
His tone was the same tone Naomi used not twenty minutes earlier; innocent and finagling, looking for information while trying to pretend otherwise. Steve was tired of that tone. No one ever asked him how he was doing out of concern for his well-being anymore. No one asked him anything anymore, unless they were trying to get information on his relationship or Tony or the Avengers.
“And here’s your papa,” Tony finished, looking up at Steve. “See?”
Bucky levelled him with a look. “Get outta here,” he ordered.
“Well. Marci wasn’t lying. She plays dirty,” Bucky sighed.
“Well,” Steve replied, folding his arms on Tony’s chest and resting his chin on them so they were face to face. “Lucky for you, you never have to find out.”
“While I have you,” Pepper continued. “I need you to clear December 1st. Stark Industries is organising a Meet the Heroes event for our potential investors so I need all of the Avengers on their best behaviour.”
. Does that help?”
“It’s all in your head,” he muttered, shaking himself.
“Yeah, I’m good,” Steve replied unconvincingly.
“You must Joseph Rogers.”
He kissed Tony’s throat.
“Here he is now,” Hope said, sliding her last file into the tray and turning towards-
“You can tell me.”
“Or perhaps their ‘concerns’ are less about the public nature of my relationship, and more about the fact that I’m dating a man.”
“Oh. Awesome,” Bucky yawned. “What time is it?”
“Yeah,” Clint agreed.
“Yeah, maybe you’re right.”
“So he’s an eccentric billionaire?”
“Ow!” Steve jumped when Tony’s fingers touched his eye.
“Got your sunglasses?”
No answer.
“Thank you,” Steve said, swallowing the flare f irritation at the use of
Tony tipped his head back, looking up at Steve. “Do you want to go to court tomorrow?” he asked. “Watch the rest of the trial?”
“I was having an off day,” Scott pouted.
“I’ve got time.”
“Sorry I called you crazy,” Bruce said to Steve.
“This kind of perfection doesn’t just happen overnight,” Tony retorted haughtily, climbing out of bed.
“Oh really?” he teased. “I never would’ve guessed.”
“Uh, yeah. Just me,” Steve replied.
“Mr Rogers, wasn’t it?” Stane asked, turning to Steve. “We met at the party.”
They took their time getting ready, taking turns in the shower. Tony picked up Steve’s shampoo, flicking the lid open and sniffing it. When he spent what turned into pretty much the whole of January caring for Steve through the cold and then the flu, he’d used this shampoo every day. As a result, he spent most of January smelling like Steve.
“What happened?” Tony asked.
“Most likely, sir.”
“I find it highly suspicious,” Tony continued, a faint tremor in his voice, “That this happened tonight. When
“I thought they would’ve gotten over it by now,” he muttered. “So I’m dating Tony Stark. So what?”
“I’ll go fix it,” she said with a grin just on the side of too bright, hurrying down the corridor before Hank could say a word.
Steve nodded but he appreciated being asked. It felt like at SHIELD everyone expected him to be okay with everyone coming near his pup but he still had those instincts ingrained into him that no one - least of all an alpha - should go near his pup without his permission.
Tony turned to Clint. “Okay. Give it to me straight: how bad do my teeth look?”
“Are you honestly telling me that you believe there would be the same complaints if a female member of staff was dating Tony? I think we both know that there wouldn’t be. So they can take their homophobic bullshit and stuff it up their ass,” he finished.
“Didn’t they go on to win the pennant for the first time in years that year?” Steve added.
“I…” Steve’s voice wavered. He frowned, looking small and lost, and his mouth goldfished for several seconds.
, he thought.
“Do you want to dance?” Tony blurted out.
“I think you mean it is a bomb shelter,” Clint said, picking a piece of plaster out of his hair. “I mean, we did get bombed.”
“Steve, have you ever actually successfully fixed anything in your life?” Tony asked, settling on the edge of the pool and studying the instructions.
“I know how to take care of people. Well, that’s not true,” he corrected, “But I know how to take care of myself and I just do what I’d do if it was me.”
“Yeah. Go save the world,” Steve smiled.
“A car? And a carseat for a certain someone.”
“She’s something,” Steve grinned, buttoning his blazer.
“Well, Pepper’s expecting us at Stark Industries, so probably around the time she threatens my life or my manhood for not being there.”
A burst of surprise burst across Tony’s face before he could school his features into a neutral expression. He rolled his eyes again, slicing off a long strip of cod and sucking it into his mouth like a piece of spaghetti. Steve swallowed his grimace because he refused to let Tony win.
And then guard them with his life, because no one could ever know - beyond Bruce and Steve himself - that mers existed.
“Okay,” Tony whispered, leaning against the curve of Steve’s shoulder and letting it go. “Okay, honey.”
“You think?” Steve smiled.
Bruce smiled. “You’ll live.”
Steve hung up, then let out a ragged breath. He stared at the phone, then realised there was somewhere he needed to be.
“Sure you were.”
“Of course, there’s nepotism too. Like Bruce Banner. You think he would’ve worked on the Bio-Tech Force Enhancement Project if he wasn’t dating the daughter of the organiser? Clearly he wasn’t smart enough or he wouldn’t have failed.
“Just trying to get my head around you saving me.”
Johnny buried his hands into his pocket and slouched against the wall, glancing up when someone exited the ER, his heart doing that funny little jump in his chest until he saw it wasn’t Peter but a doctor in blue scrubs.
“On it,” Steve grinned.
“Yeah,” Steve replied, but his voice sounded hollow. Distant. Like he had a cold and his ears were all blocked up. “Thank you,” he added belatedly.
With Tony’s strong hands under his arm, Steve managed to climb onto his feet. He would deny exactly how unsteady his legs were until his dying day if asked. Judging by Tony’s expression, he noticed Steve’s small stumble. His face was tight as he reached towards Steve’s face.
, how about I make dinner and you-”
“It’s not happening.”
EDIT 2: Look at the amazing art by profoundlyexceeded of Angie in her costume!!!! I am in love with it!!! Look at the detail on the dress! A huge thank you to profoundlyexeeded for taking my random ideas and turning it into a beautiful piece of art. I am so lucky to have it become part of this fic. Check out more of their art on
,” Steve retorted.
“He probably has a concussion again,” she shrugged. “Are you really worrying about Clint Barton? The man who falls off of skyscrapers and only needs a band aid?”
“That’s me.”
“Let’s not tell him about what Tony did in the kitchen the other day,” Steve stage-whispered to Ellie, tickling her sides until she giggled and squirmed away from him.
“Who’s your friend?” Steve frowned, nodding at Ari.
“Don’t call me that,” Steve hissed, finally pushing Joseph off of him. “You’re an asshole.”
“Asshole,” Steve huffed, but he sounded more amused than annoyed. “You want me to move in with you?”
and winced when pain shot up his leg.
“Thanks,” Steve nodded, feeling relieved that Bucky would take him seriously enough - or was willing to indulge him - to go to Brooklyn to check up on Tony.
“Uh, yeah. I’m here. And sure, that sounds good. Josie’s?”
“This place? It’s not real.”
With a growl of frustration, he let his head fall back, the sun warming his face.He opened his eyes, staring up at the house blindly.
Crawling out of the tree house, Steve set off up the garden again. When he entered the house, Tony looked up in surprise. Steve ignored his wide-eyed stare, crossing to his backpack and rummaging inside until he found the hand towel he’d stuck in there just in case.
“He’d probably love that.”
Steve climbed out of the car, closed his eyes and tipped his head back, letting the wind blowing off of the ocean wash over him and blow away the lingering tension from his therapy session. He breathed in the smell of the ocean and the seaweed, listening to the caws of the gulls swooping overhead.
“Yes, I did,” Bruce replied. “Next time Mrs Borson comes in, feel free to send her my way.”
And who was sitting downstairs with a weird lump in her side that needed treatment. Weird lumps didn’t care about insurance or capitalism; they just appeared and usually had a horrible outcome for whoever they’d appeared on.
Before he knew what he was doing, Steve had reached down and taken himself in hand. A ridiculously short time later, he came to the thought of blue scales and mismatched eyes.
Angie was waiting in the middle of the living room, a falsely bright smile on her face.
“Too early to go to Midtown to have sex with my boyfriend?”
For a so-called genius, Nefaria wasn’t very smart, Steve decided. For starters, both he and the guard by the door had failed to notice that throughout Nefaria’s monologue, Steve had carefully worked his hands free from the cuffs behind his back.
“Steve, we need to get your temperature down,” Tony pointed out, silently begging Steve to agree because he felt like the worst kind of person imaginable pulling the blankets away from him.
“No, I’m fine,” he insisted. “Pete’s the only one who got hurt.”
“Ari,” Tony nodded. “Hey, you’re scarily efficient; any chance you could get rid of the press so Steve and I don’t have to worry about them anymore?”
Then he slipped out of the room, picking up Steve’s final bags on the way past, and Steve was alone.
“So are you,” Tony pointed out.
Steve whined.
“To reach the briefing room, head to your right upon exiting the elevator,” JARVIS explained as the doors slid open. “The briefing room is behind the elevators.”
“We’re definitely terrible examples,” Scott decided.
“Maybe,” Steve grinned.
say you still have condoms,” Tony realised suddenly, because there was no way he could run to the nearest drugstore right now.
Steve shrugged. “Nowhere else to go.”
Thank God he’d found Tony when he did.
“If the government or the military asks, no I did not,” Rhodey replied. “I’d rather not get thrown out of the Air Force.”
“He’s planning on making an entrance.”
“Thanks.”
He stepped back to avoid another tracksuited thug barrelled towards him only to run headfirst into a wall.
“I’m worried about Barton,” Tony admitted. “It’s been going on for a while now. He doesn’t seem like himself. You know about the dog, right?”
And if Tony thought to himself that figuring out how to have sex quietly when there was a kid in the house might be good practise for the future, well. That was his little secret.
“I got called into the principal’s office this afternoon.”
“You’re right. What am I thinking? Must be the exhaustion. And with that I bid you all goodnight. Or good morning. Whatever time it is.”
A lump pressed in his throat.
“That’s amazing,” Steve said, unable to believe it.
“Can we get everything ready by tomorrow?” Tony frowned.
I'm on Tumblr as
“Wait, when did this happen?”
Tony chuckled, sliding his hand onto Steve’s back, hooking his thumb into the waistband of his trousers and splaying his hand over Steve’s ass. Steve’s breath caught and heat pooled in his groin. He wasn’t usually a fan of possessiveness, but he found he didn’t find quite so much when it was Tony.
“For you, honey, of course,” Tony nodded.
“Yes, and you were the last good one,” Tony covered.
Tony didn’t even bother correcting him. Marco was his friend, even if he did betray him to Stane. “No. He was good, but not this good. I don’t know who the Maggia has working for them. But they might even be better than me."
“Ow, rude,” Barton coughed.
Mind-boggling.
“That cat hates everyone except you and Nat,” Barton declared.
“Yeah, but I already pulled that trick on them before so they went a little, uh, overboard on the knots this time,” Clint sighed.
“You will. Long as you invest in some decent lube.”
“You’re a grown man,” Angie glared. “You can’t be afraid of the dentist.”
Edwards looked up in surprise and, to his satisfaction, a flicker of guilt danced across her face. “Mr Rogers-”
“Oh fuck!” Steve exclaimed in relief. “Thank you, thank you, oh, thank God.”
“There isn’t a problem,” Sharon replied evasively. “I’m just… I think I’m busy that night.”
A voice nagged in his head, repeating
A second later, Tony laughed then shook his head. “Lucky me,” he murmured. “We should mark the calendar. If I had a calendar.”
“And second of all… dinner actually sounds good,” Steve grinned. “I’m starving.”
“Jesus Christ, Howard. Haven’t you ever heard of filing?” Steve growled. There were papers everywhere. Some of them were probably important - there were some that looked like bank statements and designs - but Steve ignored them all.
Then the doctor turned and spotted Johnny.
“Donnie here is currently engaged in a battle against Juvenile Xanthogranuloma - did I say that right?” he asked Donnie.
“Finally,” Loki snapped. “Next time, do not make us wait here. I thought this was an emergency room.”
Steve swallowed. He knew exactly what he had to do.
Stane drew back his arm; Steve flinched.
“Right, let’s see this shoulder. Oh yeah, that’s dislocated. We’ll have to pop that back into place.”
. Jarvis thought it sounded like a horror movie, so he bought us tickets.” Tony smiled, chuckling to himself. “I wasn’t exactly thrilled when it turned out to be a Disney movie. But then it started and I… loved it. So part of it is the movie, but part of it’s the memories. That last day with Jarvis before I left home.”
“Not as long as there should’ve been,” Steve admitted.
The shockwave slammed into them, throwing Tony across the room and ripping Steve’s hands from his. He slammed into something hard and fell to the ground and everything went black.
He was going to miss her.
Steve set an alarm for the following morning, knowing it would be a long day. He would have to call Foggy to check the papers had gone through, and then he had to figure out how the hell he was going to run an entire company and weed out all of Stane’s cronies from SI. He hoped he’d get a chance to give Bucky a call too; they hadn’t caught up in a while and Steve missed him.
, Steve tried to tell himself.
“So the whole world then?” Peggy smirked.
His eyes lingered on Tony’s gills on the right side of his neck and frowned. There was scarring over them, the flesh knotted and twisted where it had healed, and Steve wondered if it affected Tony’s ability to breathe.
“Cool.”
“If I wasn’t afraid for my life, I’d kiss you right now. Actually, screw it.” Tony danced around the table, dropping a kiss onto the top of her head, jumping back before Natasha could react. He grimaced, wiping his mouth. “Jesus woman, when did you last shower?”
Tony stared at the ceiling, his fingers rubbing tiny circles into Steve’s shoulder. “There was a girl. A kid. I was ordered to hand her over to her husband. I refused.”
“What’s wrong?” Steve asked, his fingers itching to reach out for Tony, desperate to comfort him in whatever way he could. He’d always been tactile, especially when it came to comfort.
“I haven’t said anything!”
“I don’t think you’re being stupid or vain,” Steve replied. “Peggy always tells me that court is a power play. No one can afford to show weakness unless they want it to be picked apart. Besides, if it makes you feel good, wear whatever you want.”
Then Joseph turned and sauntered out of the alley as though he hadn’t just threatened his only son.
And staring into Steve’s face, his expression so happy and relaxed and turning fond as he ran a hand through Evie Rose’s hair, Tony realised he wanted something real with this man. Something he hadn’t wanted in a long time.
“Steve, it’s fine,” Tony promised, because, okay, it was unexpected to have a small child on their first official date with them, but one thing Tony had learned during their text-ship was how devoted Steve was to his nieces. It was kind of adorable actually.
“I’ll take your word for it.”
“I didn’t think she’d look twice at me anymore. But she did. I’m a lucky guy. Even though we haven’t been together again long, I didn’t want to wait.”
Fury frowned. “What?”
Steve opened his mouth to argue, but then he thought about Peggy and Daniel and sighed. “Yeah, I do.”
“Oh, Lord, that’s better,” Bucky sighed, bending his arm at the elbow and clenching his fist. “Alright, I need you to be Iron Man right now, cause this is an Avengers’ level threat.”
Tony’s laughter followed him out of the house. The thought of searching the grounds - and there was a lot of ground to cover - looking for a generator was stupidly intimidating. Rationally, Steve knew it wouldn’t take that much effort, but his brain continued to whisper to him to just give up, just forget about it, because doing nothing would be
“Can you help me take my hair down?” she asked, jumping down the stairs one at a time.
“I was,” Steve insisted. “Did you get something?”
Pepper excused herself, hearing her name from across the room, but Ari appeared in her place, looking more excited that Steve had ever seen him.
Steve’s car was so old, it didn’t have air conditioning. He liked to joke that the air con was opening both windows and letting the wind whip through the car while he was driving. But today, even that brought little relief. He wasn’t looking forward to scrubbing the pool in this heat, but at least he would see Tony. When had seeing Tony become the bright spot in his day, Steve wondered, locking the car and trekking up the trail towards the Stark Mansion. At some point their discourse had turned from pointed barbs into a comfortable familiarity. And despite the fact Steve felt like shit, staying at home had never really been an option today, because he wanted to see Tony.
It took him a few more minutes to actually stand up - or maybe it was longer, Steve couldn’t tell - and stumble across the room. He picked up the t-shirt and board shorts he’d been wearing to the mansion the past few days and pulled them on again, even though a distant part of his mind told him that he should wear something clean. That was… No. Steve couldn’t think about that, couldn’t make a decision about what to wear. It was too much. Suffocating.
“Fuck,” he groaned then laughed at the irony because fucking was exactly what he was trying to avoid thinking about.
“No, it’s not. Tony, you were right: if there’s a fight, I’m going to get involved in it. If I see a situation headed south, I can’t ignore it. Sometimes I wish I could.”
“Sharon, I swear to God,” he groaned, levering himself off of the couch. “If you’ve broken bed rest, Natasha is going to kill me.”
He took a lungful of air as he made his way along the trail towards the mansion, turning to look down over the city. He understood why Howard Stark had decided to build his home up here: the view was incredible. But, Steve thought as he vaulted over the wall, it was also incredibly cruel to keep a mer locked up so far away from the sea. Talk about rubbing salt in the wound. The faint splash of blue of the Pacific on the horizon was no doubt clearer to Tony’s sharp eyes; a constant taunt of the world he would never return to.
“Nope,” Tony shook his head. “It’s that or nothing. You could add
, Steve thought angrily, then felt sick with guilt. What kind of terrible person would wish for someone to starve just because he couldn’t be bothered to get out of bed? Steve’s vision blurred and he buried his face in his pillow until the stupid and pointless tears disappeared.
Cross hummed and twisted his mouth to the side.
“It looks like Christmas threw up in here,” Bucky declared.
“Yeah?”
Steve rolled onto his back, cracking open an eyelid just long enough to see Tony perching on the edge of the bed with a shit-eating grin before snapping his eyes shut again and pressing the heels of his palms into his eyes.
He watched her eyes grow heavy, her eyelashes fanning out across her cheek as her mouth spread in a wide yawn.
“Yeah,” Tony nodded. “And you know, I was thinking we could start looking for a place, somewhere a little more permanent than this. We both have jobs so that should help with getting a mortgage and oh my God, I sound so grown up. Please kiss me again so I stop talking,” he begged.
“Yes. Some parents have some concerns about you.”
“Deal,” Clint nodded, shaking his hand. “Now, cover that thing up. It’s staring at me.”
“Kittens,” he breathed.
Sharon nodded, wrapping her arms around her girlfriend - her girlfriend! Natasha was still her girlfriend - and buried her face in Natasha’s neck. “Yeah. That sounds good.”
Stealing one more kiss, Tony murmured, “On your front?”
“I don’t know.”
Once Steve was gone, she closed her eyes. The Thing was she wanted to marry Sharon. She was positive that Sharon was the person that she wanted to spend the rest of her life with. But six months was too soon to propose, especially when her girlfriend was pregnant and dealing with a shittonne of hormones. It wasn’t fair; hell, it was downright stupid, but that didn’t stop her from scrolling through a page of engagement rings on her phone during her break the day before, reaching the bottom of the page before she realised what she was doing.
“Don’t you need to look?”
He walked Marci to the elevator but when it opened, it wasn’t empty.
Ellie beamed up at Steve and clapped her hands.
“Can you break ‘em?” Bucky asked.
“Yeah, kinda,” Steve agreed.
“Tony.”
“I hate you,” Steve muttered.
“Did you seriously just use the word atrocious?”
“How did you end up in this mess anyway?”
. He left the city lights behind, chasing after the Guiletta as she left the river for the open sea.
if you wanted. It’s certainly true.”
“I like the idea of being on the level with you,” Tony smiled and Steve had to lean in and steal another kiss.
“Nothing?” Tony pressed. “Does it make any noise at all? Start then stop?”
“This is
But Tony was sick. And the rattling cough, the grey pallor of his skin, none of it seemed healthy. And while Steve knew part of it could be his own issues, another part reminded him that Tony wouldn’t ask for help even if he needed it.
“I can pay my way,” Steve replied, trying very hard to keep his tone congenial.
“Here,” Steve said, holding up the lube.
He didn’t know how he felt.
“I’m Captain America,” Bucky pointed out. “I can do whatever I want.”
“What happened to
“That sounds amazing. You have to send me pictures.”
“What the fuck?” Bucky bellowed.
“I don’t see how that’s any of your business,” Hank scowled.
“He’s gonna kill me,” he told the empty apartment. “Well, if I’m gonna die tomorrow, I might as well eat ice cream tonight.”
Johnny ducked his head and shrank back, wishing he could blend into the wall and be forgotten, ignored. Sometimes he thought he’d like it if Peter was the only one who could see him.
Clint huffed and reminded himself that she was here as a patient, not his ex, not a woman. He pushed away the flare of attraction and moved forward to study the lump on her side.
“Yeah- Zoey, make sure Hannah doesn’t eat that! Yeah, I am. We’re making Playdoh sloths.”
“I bet.”
“You ready, baby?” Tony asked. “You ready to let me take care of you?”
Only Stane had turned up with a document claiming that Tony had made him his representative, complete with fake signature from Tony and witnessed by an obviously crooked lawyer. The document gave Stane carte blanche to run the company however he saw fit - and freedom to blame Tony for anything that went wrong. That discovery sent Sharon on a twenty minute rant against Stane, and Steve decided he was a little bit in love with her after that. He’d told her that she should consider a career change to the FBI or the CIA and she’d replied, “I just might!”
“Very much so.”
“Aww,” Tony cooed, tilting his head. “Aren’t they disgusting?”
“Same, but I’ve been stuck in a pool for the last twenty years,” Tony grinned.
“Wait, what?” Tony’s feet fell off the table with a thump. “You cracked it? You cracked the code’s code’s code’s whatever?”
When Steve entered the exam room, his heart sank. He didn't know who he was least happy to see: Alexander, or the patient lying on the gurney with what looked like a crossbow arrow through his shoulder.
“Yelling at the protesters outside Planned Parenthood always makes me feel better,” Steve muttered.
“I thought you had the night off,” Natasha called, running to meet the paramedics pushing a gurney into the ER and the familiar figure with them, admittedly not in her usual paramedics uniform.
“Yes, sir,” Ari nodded.
“No.” Tony glared into the water. Then his whole body language changed, the tension disappearing from his shoulders and he grinned lasciviously up at Steve. “Hey, did you know I can hold my breath for twenty minutes?”
“Tony, stop it, I’m fine,” Steve scowled, ducking away from Tony’s hands.
The hair on the back of Steve’s neck prickled. He had a suspicion that he knew where this was going.
He couldn’t vacuum, because there was shit everywhere on his floor - including half of the laundry which needed to be done. So that was a no.
Steve opened his eyes and spotted Tony leaning worriedly against the edge of the pool.
Arnie hummed. “A handsome young alpha. Is he anything like his father?”
. Clicking on the link, Steve found it was an undergraduate thesis from 2008 by a then-student of Harvard.
Steve looked up.
“I’m fine,” Johnny insisted, but when he jerked away, his wrist twinged and the movement pulled on his shirt where it was stuck to one of the grazes on his arm. “Fuck!”
“Yeah,” Tony sighed, squeezing her shoulder. The toe of his boot sent a used needle skittering across the ground and Tony swallowed, fighting off a shudder. This was hitting a little too close to home.
“Really?” Steve grinned.
“Thanks.”
“No problem. Anyway-”
“So, have you made a decision?” she asked.
“That sounds like great fun,” Steve grinned. “If only so I can tease him about it.”
Tony smiled. “Yeah. She got away.”
“Tony, you are possibly more biased than I am,” Steve pointed out.
Suddenly he remembered stepping through this door for the first time, with the realtor who showed it to him, and falling in love with the apartment immediately. He was ready to start his future and couldn’t wait for it to arrive.
“Good,” Steve murmured, feeling a swell of pride for his husband.
“Thanks,” Matt smiled.
“I’m gonna need some of that bail money for you, aren’t I?” Tony grinned.
“I mean I’m just guessing, but if you wanted to trick someone into a trap, taking their boyfriend would be a pretty good start,” Steve shrugged. “But I think you’d get a better answer to that question if you directed it towards your client. Since he’s the one who kidnapped me.”
And so they settled into a routine: every day Bucky went to watch the trial and reported back in the evening, while Steve took Tony sightseeing. They tried to fly under the radar as much as possible - and Tony was very good at not being noticed when he wanted to be - but their presence in DC for the trial was heavily publicised, so they often found themselves being approached. The majority of the fans were friendly and polite, so Steve found he didn’t mind too much. And several voiced their support for him in the trial, which definitely helped.
Tony was making French toast and trying not to think about how quiet the tower felt the next morning when JARVIS announced, “Sir, Miss Potts is on the line.”
“Oh, I know you can,” Coulson replied. “I also know that you see the big picture. If you're a team player, there’s a reason. So what’s the big picture?”
“Yeah, a little,” Steve replied. “I managed to get some sleep.”
“Mr Stark, what are your thoughts on the upcoming trial?”
Bruce was pretty sure that was pretty bad in normal circumstances, but when his patient was Frigga Borson? And her son was due back in a few hours, demanding answers?
“As it happens, I do,” Hope replied.
“Yeah?”
Part of him wanted to get out of here, return to the pool and try to talk to Tony. But something else told him to investigate this door, that there was something he needed to see behind it. Which was ridiculous, because how could he possibly know what was in there without looking? It was probably just a storage room or a bathroom. The house had a ridiculous amount of bathrooms, after all.
Steve grinned, watching Arnie and their pup greet each other. Beside him, Tony was very deliberately not fidgeting and Steve could smell the change in his scent that said he was nervous.
“Holy shit, this is serious. Have you told Pepper?”
“Shoot.”
“Fuck you, Stark,” Clint scowled. “If you’re not going to help, just leave.”
It should’ve been a terrifying realisation for their first official date.
A ripple of laughter ran through the crowd and Steve saw Rhodey and Sharon roll their eyes at each other. They weren’t the only ones; he noticed several eye rolls and huffs from various people throughout the crowd. His skin prickled. What was going on?
“Hey. Hey buddy?” he called. The guard turned to him. “Hey, hi. Can you help? Please? My nose, it’s, it’s really itchy. Please, can you just scratch it?”
“Okay,” Steve said softly.
Tony turned to Bruce. “I need to find Steve. Think the Other Guy would help me get out of here?”
Alexander smirked at him. “I’ve been playing this game a lot longer than you have, Steve. You think you can beat me? I’m already three steps ahead of you.”
“Hi puppy,” he murmured.
Suddenly Steve knew what the rest of the song needed to say.
“Don’t apologise.”
“Regret what?”
“Hush,” Tony laughed.
“Yeah, Sharon works there too. That’s how we met.”
He trusted them, would even go as far as to say they were his friends, but he wouldn’t risk Tony like that.
“You’re the best boyfriend ever,” Steve declared emphatically.
In 1977, Howard Stark bought the land following his marriage to socialite and renowned marine biologist Maria Stark, intending for it to become the home for their future children. The house was completed in October 1978 and the couple moved in. The decor was heavily influenced by the ocean, and the house gained its nickname ‘The Mermaid House’ as a result of the famous parties held there, where the Starks would hire performers to act as mermaids in the giant swimming pool. Their eldest son, Arno, was born in the house in 1988.
“Because…” Steve swallowed. “Because I know Tony Stark. Like, really know him. In real life. I’ve met him and I guess we’re friends, kind of. Although he’s a bit of an asshole. Understandably. And then I went with you to that event at Stark Industries and it doesn’t make sense, all those things Stane was saying about Tony not caring. It’s bullshit. Tony’s not involved in the company. At all. Stane is lying and I don’t know why. I mean, I think I know why, but to be sure I need your help.”
“He was my sergeant in basic,” Tony explained. “And his kid found me today, asking me for help to find him. I might be… a little attached.”
“It’s a very unique situation and not one comparable to… anything, really. One cannot really prepare for a kidnapping. When was the last time you were in that kind of situation?”
Steve considered it, then shook his head. “No, I’m done.”
The team greeted them - Bucky, Matt and Natasha from the kitchen, Bruce and Thor breaking their conversation at the table, and Clint perched on his own chair - warmly. Tony found himself studying Clint carefully. He was the only member of the team who’d declined to go sightseeing with Tony and Steve in DC, choosing instead to skulk away as soon as he’d given evidence.
“Is there a reason why we’re waiting out here when we could be waiting in there?” Tony smiled.
Tony hummed appreciatively.  “Oh, yeah, honey. That’s good. So, uh, how do you feel - oh, God, yes - feel about fucking me tonight?”
“I’m a lawyer,” Matt replied innocently
“Maxwell House instant,” Tony grinned. “But after that week, it was the best thing I’d ever tasted. It was also the only thing fit for consumption in our apartment.”
Wait.
The last week of term always felt more like an exercise in crowd control than education, and none more so than the final week before summer. By midweek, both Steve and Angie decided to forgo shopping for a week of takeout. Which was all very well and good at the time, but now it was Saturday and Steve’s body ached and he was tired, and there was no way he could function like a human being without a cup of tea.
“Hey Cap,” he greeted. “Mini Cap.”
Tony raised his eyebrows.
“Peggy?”
“You don’t sound like you like him,” Maria observed.
“It’s exciting.”
“I don’t think anybody would expect you to,” Angie shrugged. “For what it’s worth, I think you’re making the right choice.”
The clip ended as suddenly as it began, the playlist automatically moving on to the next video. This time it came from a news report in the wake of the Battle of New York. The anchor’s voice talked about how no one knew the full details of the origin of the nuke Iron Man was seen carrying through the portal, but Steve tuned her out, resting his chin against his fist and feeling his heart clench as Tony fell through the air far too quickly until the camera’s view was blocked by buildings. Steve knew objectively that Bruce, as the Hulk, caught Tony and he woke up, perfectly fine, only minutes later.
“And there’s my favourite junior Avenger,” Tony continued, reaching towards Ellie. He glanced up at Steve for permission before rubbing his finger against her cheek.
“What are you doing here?” he frowned. “And how did you get in here?”
“So fucking beautiful,” Tony shook his head, letting his hand run down Steve’s sternum and watching the patches of gooseflesh that erupted in its wake. “Can’t believe you’re all mine.”
To his surprise, Steve shook his head and fixed him with a look.
“Oh no,” Rhodey shook his head.
“Doctor Tony Stark,” he called back. “And you are?”
Tony’s chest heaved. Dropping his head to the side, he nudged Steve’s chin up and kissed him slowly. Steve leaned into the kiss, his fingers sliding over Tony’s collarbone, before tucking his head back into Tony’s neck and they lay there, catching their breath.
Steve laughed humourlessly. Tony’s words cut a little too close to home. “Yeah,” he sighed. “I know the feeling.”
This was really happening.
When he finally released Steve’s nipple, Tony kissed his way up Steve’s chest until he could capture his mouth again, sucking Steve’s lower lip into his mouth and rolling it between his teeth before releasing it with a wet
“You’ll be fine,” Angie assured him. “And if you’re not, I’ll be there. I’ve got your back, Rogers.”
Tony squeezed his hand.
Steve glanced up as the restroom door opened and mentally sighed when Alexander strolled in.
“A few months ago, Peggy and I were out and he came up to me out of the blue and asked if he could buy me a drink. I said no and he just left.”
“Anyway, amazingly, you two going to town on each other is not the most disgusting thing I’ve seen tonight,” Bucky continued. “You will not believe what I just saw. You know, I thought Josie’s was a reputable establishment.”
“No problem,” Steve grinned, reaching for the door handle.
When Tony shifted his attention to Steve’s split knuckles, his hands were so gentle in the way they picked up Steve’s hand, wiping away the dried blood without pressing on the bruises, that Steve felt like he might cry again. Which was stupid. He swallowed the feeling and scowled at his own ridiculousness.
“Yeah,” Steve nodded.
“Okay. Okay, uh, sure,” he nodded, leaving the nurses’ station. “Follow me.”
Steve shook it, adding, “You too,” but there was still something off about his voice.
Steve woke with a groan, sticking one hand out of his blanket burrito to fish for his phone. He knocked his glasses onto the floor, before finally finding his phone. Steve picked it up, yanking it free from the charger, and rolled onto his back to stab at the screen until the alarm fell blessedly silent.
“Ms Hogarth?” the judge turned to the defence.
“Very much so,” Foggy agreed.
“Trying to make me feel better.”
“Barton?” he hissed. “Barton? Where are you? Barton, I swear to God-”
“That’s good enough for me,” Steve replied, handing back the menu.
“Alright, let’s get him checked over,” Hope nodded, directing them to an exam room.
“I’m helpful like that,” Tony shrugged, a shit-eating grin on his face.
Tony nodded. “This is MJ. She’s his kid. According to the VA, he’s on a list for housing and has no registered address but Wilson suggested we check out the homeless camp here.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yeah, that’s right. We just started the new term,” Steve nodded. “Already I wanna hit my head against a brick wall.”
“Uncle Steve says I’m stronger than a donkey, so I’m stronger than a donkey,” Tony shrugged.
After a long moment, Tony nodded.
“Hey, it’s me,” he said.
“We’re about to land,” Tony informed him.
“Get on with it,” Steve laughed.
“Yeah. You’re good at taking care of yourself,” Pepper said quietly.
“Right,” Rhodey rolled his eyes. He swung his arm around Steve’s shoulders. “Come on, slugger.”
Steve stopped suddenly; Tony stumbled and looked up at him questioningly. Steve looked visibly nervous, taking both of Tony’s hands in his.
“My head’s kinda fuzzy,” she replied. “Feel like I’ve spent the whole day drinking or something. Matt, what did I do?”
“Yeah, yeah,” Tony waved him off. Any anxiety he’d felt on the road was gone. He couldn’t drive without freaking out, but he could do surgery in his sleep. This battlefield medicine was like coming home. “Give me all your bags, a saline pack, a couple of tubes, a needle and a scalpel,” he ordered the first paramedic. Turning to the second, he told him, “We’re gonna go on three, okay? You got this?”
