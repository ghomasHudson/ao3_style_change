“I know all this stuff must have confused you Steve, if you feel overwhelmed you can always come and talk to J. Just ask him stuff he will have the answers for you.” Tony said gently. “if you need company just go the shared living room, 8 out of 10 someone will always be there and the 2 times where there aren’t anybody else? You can always come to my workshop. I might not be the best company during my workshop binge, but I do understand some of your frustrations and if you want to unload at me, you can do it anytime.”
“As a matter of fact, I did. He was one of the founding members of SHIELD.” He said while picking up something from inside that box. “And I also think that this actually belongs to you and not to him right Tony?”
“Welp this is your floor, you room is at the back, bathroom that way, kitchen this way, yadda yadda you can ask about the rest at Jarvis, he’ll help you with everything else. Bruce, Nat, and Clint’s floors are below yours, and my floors on the penthouse. Team meetings and team dinners take place on the shared floor, you’re welcome to use any of the food in the shared floor, keep in mind though, Hulk and Natasha does NOT like to share. Any questions?”
“Sometimes there isn't a way out, Tony.” Rogers said gently. “Is this the first time you've lost a soldier?”
“Here you go,” Steve lowered him gently to his bed. “Go to sleep Tony. If you try to go to the workshop again, I will not hesitate to tie you myself to your bed so you could sleep.”
“Yeah. That's just a preview, this is opening night. Loki's a full-tilt diva. He wants flowers, he wants parades, he wants a monument built in the skies with his name plastered…”
“You’re welcome Rogers, no comment on the propositioning bit though? I’d think that a man with sensible old-timey values such as yours would frown upon the sexual nature of the 21st century.” Tony asked, stepping into the elevator that would bring them to Rogers’ floor.
“That’s not true” Fury said while smirking, looking at the content one of the box the fucking agents brought into his house.
“…of course I do. I like you too, idiot.” Tony said while hiding his face in the mug of water. Bleh.
Jarvis chuckled looking at his antics. “Well young master, I supposed you’d have to take great care of him always then so he could always see, hm? Here, I’ll teach you how you can help him see out of his long furs.” Jarvis grabbed the bear gently and held him with one hand. His right hand gently brushed away the furs around the bear’s eyes and he gave him back to Tony. “There, now he can see well Young Master.” Tony grabbed the bear excitedly where he could see the bear’s beady eyes clearly. “Yes! Now you can see well! Thank you Jarvis!” he said while running out of the kitchen and into his room where he could have grand adventures with the bear.
“Stop, just- stop, back up a little bit here.” He said while moving away from Steve’s embrace. “’The fella you like’?? Steve do you like me?”
“Right,” Tony said, turning to agent agent. “Please. First thing, I need a little bodywork. I’ll put in a little time at the lab. If we could send one of your goon squad down to The Coffee Bean, Cross Creek, for a Starbucks run, or something like that, that’d be nice.”
He gently brushed away Steve’s hair that was covering his eyes. “There,” he whispered. “now you can see.” Tony smiled and closed his eyes, laying his head on Steve’s chest and going to sleep immediately.
Tony quickly backtracked. “WELL that was a fun way to announce my daddy issues to you guys. Thank you for the inquiry, I’m going back to work now. Toodles!” he said while quickly turning to the elevator.
Rogers suddenly looked super overwhelmed and Tony mentally slapped himself on the forehead. Of course. This 27 years old guy just got catapulted 70 years into the future, given a spandex costume and immediately told to fight aliens. Of course he has questions. Hell, he probably needs a fucking therapist to unload at but which therapist can fully understand his situation?
“Yeah, I haven’t gotten to cut it just yet. Was way too worried about you lately.” Steve tightened his arms around Tony. Tony relented and just flopped down on Steve’s chest while still playing with his hair.
“Tony stop! Jarvis was worried for you! He gave me Pepper’s number who gave me the override codes so I could come in here. Jarvis said you haven’t really been sleeping and eating.” Steve said while crossing his big beefy yummy arms.
“I am really feeling the love here Steven.” He grumbled. “You better ask me out for real after I’m done with this stupid bullshit.”
“CAP!” Tony said while snatching the bear away from Fury’s hands. Fury is now currently doubled over shaking from laughter at the possessive act Tony just showed towards a decades old tattered stupid looking Captain America teddy bear.
Tony shrugged. ”I don’t know where you get your information, but he wasn’t my biggest fan. He was cold, he was calculating. He never told me he loved me. He never even told me he liked me, so it’s a little tough for me to digest when you’re telling me he said the whole future was riding on me and he’s passing it down. I don’t get that. You’re talking about a guy whose happiest day was when he shipped me off to boarding school.”
Rogers blended quickly with the team. Over time, he spent most of his time sketching in Tony’s workshop, keeping him company or even playing with Dum E, Butterfingers, and U. He made a cartoon sketch of Dum E one time and Dum E promptly snatched his sketchbook away from Rogers. Dum E made him run around the workshop a few times before he managed to finally caught him. Tony laughed so hard at the ridiculous sight of a super soldier running around his workshop, trying to catch his dumb bot and Rogers looked mad for a second, but then he also smiled and laughed heartily. That was the day that Rogers became Steve and Stark became Tony.
“That’s what I thought. Go to sleep okay? I promise we can have that date as soon as you woke up Tony.” Steve smiled gently while petting his hair. That feels really nice, and Tony doesn’t want to be separated from Steve just yet.
“You old horndog, I just meant to sleep Steven. I am way too tired to perform sexual acts with you just yet and I want to give you the whole Tony Stark experience.” He said while yawning.
“Believe it or not Stark, people in the 40s also fuck.” Rogers smirked. Fuck. Tony is so fucked. Did rogers just flirted with him? And he looks so Goddamn handsome when he’s smiling too, fuck.
“No more coffee for you! You’re gonna eat this fucking meal that I made, and you’re going straight to bed for 12 hours minimum.” Steve ushered him out of the elevator into the shared kitchen where there’s a plate of fried rice on the counter.
“I told you before Stark, you’re a part of a larger universe now, that means you can’t die yet.” Fucking cyclops said while pestering all his suspicious agents inside his fucking mansion carrying around Howard’s stuff.
When Tony was 3 years old his father started these summer long expeditions to find the brave heroic Captain America. Tony knew for a fact that Captain America was a hero, how couldn’t he? This person beat all odds by becoming the only super soldier ever in existence while having all sorts of medical conditions. He also bravely flew a plane down the Atlantic Ocean to save New York. So yeah, Tony knew how important his father’s expeditions were, doesn’t mean he didn’t want to spend holiday with him though. At least mom and Jarvis were still here at the mansion to play with him all summer, so he wasn’t that bored per se. He still had his Captain America action figures and toys and circuit boards. He just wanted an
“You’re welcome Captain. Take a rest, you could join us on dinner today. Natasha is making her famous Borscht. Spoiler alert, it’s not so good but you can’t let it show on your face ‘cus Nat will kill you with the ladle.”
Steve just smiled even wider than before. If he was a Golden Retriever, he would be barking and wagging his tail so hard.
“I love you,” Steve says before meeting him halfway and they end up making out on their knees, Steve’s cock still bobbing between them and Tony’s begging to be set free. When Steve wanders his hand down his length his bucks forward against it, moaning as he slips his briefs down to his knees and stroke those damned super soldier hands over his cock.
Clint had been the first to actually hint at anything unusual. They had been standing around the common kitchen making their usual breakfast with a missing flourish when Tony had stumbled in smelling of motor oil and week-old laundry. Clint had been perched on the chair, his elbows digging into his thighs when their resident billionaire leaned next to him and chugged down some coffee. The archer’s nose had wrinkled up, eyebrows drawing tight and his mouth opened before any of them had even registered what was about to happen.
Bucky could barely stand and Clint’s hands were warm against him, guiding him into the back of a cab, helping lead him up a few flights of stairs into a mess of an apartment. He barely registered a bra over the back of the couch or the impressive knife collection above the television. Clint brushed it all off with a quick, “I live with my crazy sister,” before tugging Bucky into the furthest bedroom.
He held up a hand quickly, bottom lip pulled between his teeth before he released it, “I’m crying to you, Cap, let me bawl,” a deep breath, “I didn’t cheat on Pepper, at least not the way you’re probably thinking. I didn’t sleep with anyone else, I didn’t take up take with anyone in any romantic sense, but I did let someone else into the part of me that should have only belonged to her. I didn’t realize it at first, again I didn’t realize any of this for a long time, until that morning. I showered, I changed, I came down for breakfast and through it all this sudden realization rumbled its way through my mind pulling me in and out of this dizzy dream state because this felt real. I kept saying it over and over in my head, “Why do you think this” but everytime I asked myself the answers kept presenting themselves over and over throughout the day, throughout the week over the course of three years my mind kept showing me the answer until I couldn’t hide it anymore. Until Pepper couldn’t ignore it anymore,”
The topic they all skirted around, that they all avoided like the damn plague since the day they heard the subtle shout, heels stomping down the penthouse hallway before Tony disappeared into his shop for the next fifty-six hours only to emerge with ghosts behind his eyes asking if there was coffee. No one had attempted to pull him out of the shop, no one called Rhodey to ask him to help and no one called- well- they left it an open door for Tony to say whatever he wanted when he wanted because that was how they worked. All of them.
"Then stop saying it's my fault," He tugged his shirt out of the man's fingers, "Stop trying to undress me.”
“I don’t know him. Punk. The first guy you’ve shown interest in since ya told me and I barely know the guy,” The brunette dropped his gaze, “Could have at least told me.”
“Steve,” Tony moaned pushing his body up against his in a cry for more. Steve nearly lost it at the desperate look on Tony’s face, those red lips swollen and wet, hair mussed and face flushed. Steve watched him dart his tongue out to wet his lips once more and groaned he dropped to Tony’s neck kissing and nipping a line down to his collar bone before biting just over the arc reactor and eliciting the dirtiest sound he has ever heard. Tony’s hands flying up to grip at Steve’s hair and pull the man’s mouth back up to his. Tony bit Steve’s lips, sucking the flesh into his mouth and tugging it back as he stretched his lithe body beneath him and wiggled his hips short circuiting Steve’s mind. Something dark, something sinful and passion fueled blanketed any further thought he had once he felt Tony slide his hand into Steve’s pants (when did he manage to undo Steve’s belt?) and wrap those clever fingers around Steve’s cock and twisted his wrist.
Grinning Steve sucked one before pulling off and dropping the towel onto the floor, sidled up next to his boyfriend and buried his face into the genius's neck.
Finally, the man dropped his hands, lifting off his knees to stand over Steve, arms crossed with a huff. He looked over his shoulder towards the coffee line then back at Steve a funny look drawing his eyebrows together before he rolled his shoulders back and stuck out a bandage covered hand, “Hi, I’m Tony, I’m sorry for spilling coffee on you.”
“You want to get lunch before I drop you off at the range?” They were making their way towards Steve's car (New car because only the best for the boyfriend of Tony Stark) Steve carrying Bucky’s bag because he hated wearing the arm after therapy.
The coffee shop was sweltering and packed full of students trying to suck some caffeine into their bloodstreams anyway they could short of straight-lining it. Steve hated coming here, hated when he forgot his favorite mug on the counter, and pinch pennies together so he can stay awake long enough to survive his last few classes of the day. For the millionth time, he wishes he’d taken the scholarship to the art school in New York. He loved art, he could spend his entire life painting or drawing if he willfully wished, but he could never lose his first love for architecture. As the line moved forwards once more he sighed remembering that this school was offering him more than he could ever imagine and having to pinch their luck a few times was worth it.
Everything about Tony screamed sex appeal from the way he talked to the angle he dropped his socks. It's what made Steve want to crawl over his lover leaving wet kisses and red bite marks across his olive skin until Tony was an undone mess beneath the soldiers hands. Steve loved to watch the billionaire unravel beneath him, hands in his hair as Steve bobbed his head over Tony’s cock making him say all those things that pooled heat into his stomach.
“Damn baby,” He breathes over Steve’s cock who moans and shifts beneath him “God you’re so fucking hard,” He grabs him, drinking in the mewls that Steve’s lets out as Tony’s works his fist over him.
Dammit and even Bucky had to admit the young man was dangerously attractive in a deep red button-up shirt, the buttons left loose to show off a lithe frame, dusky nipples visible one being pinched between his left forefinger and thumb, the other hand toying with the dark hair that disappeared beneath the waistband of dark jeans. He was okay, he really was, until his stupid laser eyes took stock of the number of hickeys covering the exposed olive skin.
Tony was making eggs at their stove with one of Steve’s hoodies on, his hips moving in time to the horrendous pop song on the radio, and his hair was wet. Steve’s was too.
He wasn’t sure how they ended up making out on Clint’s bed, or how Clint’s shirt had come off but sometimes when he looked up at Bucky his eyes were just the right shade of blue, his lips the perfect shape and when he asked if he could blow him and Bucky had mumbled he’d never been with a guy Clint didn’t even bat an eye just smiled and said, “Pretend I’m Steve.” it almost made him sick knowing he was that fucking obvious.
The saltiness of Tony’s tears mingled with the aching taste of the engineer and Steve drank it all in, holding the man so tight he could feel the hard press of the arc reactor against his own chest. Somewhere between desperate and frantic their hands traveled to each other's shirts, Steve’s fingers pressing into the small of Tony’s back feeling the curve of his spine as he moves slowly, so slowly Steve barely realized he could feel the other man’s hips grinding down against him. It nearly distracted him from the digging pressure of Tony’s nails along his shoulder blades, nails scratching at the muscle there just enough to send a shiver down the soldier’s spine and elicit a moan into the engineers mouth. Tony swallowed it down heartily, licking across the roof of Steve’s mouth before massaging his tongue and pulling back brown eyes blown wide with lust, red rimmed from falling tears.
He didn’t have to time to dwell on the thoughts to much before he saw the man himself emerge from the steaming bathroom. All golden beauty and boy-next-door smile as he walked towards the bed his hands dropping his own towel against a chair as he stood before Tony. At this stance Tony and Steve could see eye-to-eye. The super soldier leaned forwards brushing his fingers across Tony’s facial hair and brushing his thumb over his lip until Tony opened his mouth and sucked the digit in. He gasped, biting his tongue as his boyfriend licked over his thumb nail and let the fingers fall out his mouth with an exaggerated pop.
“I’m retiring, I give up, being this far away from my marvelous bed and shower for so long has proven my current track of good Samaritan acts isn’t worth it,” Tony ranted as he stumbled into his and Cap’s apartment level, FRIDAY had welcomed them asking Tony if he would like for her to start the automatic shower.
“I need to be cleaned,” Steve said softly pulling Tony out of his own head to see his lover handing him a new wash rag with the bar of soap wrapped inside of it.
“You’re ass is so beautiful,” Steve mused and he was telling the truth. Tony was a sight to behold and none should forget that. He was all olive skin, taut muscles and bright pink holes just begging to be tasted.
“Can you please stop,” He shoved the shirt back down, moving as far away from the stranger as the wall would let him.
Tony would say that his one true best friend will always be Rhodey, his honeybear, his platypus. But Steve is also becoming a strong contender for that title. They spent a lot of time together, discussing the most recent battles strategies and how to improve, discussing modern pop cultures, introducing Steve to modern cultures and technologies (“That machine LITERALLY just spit out money Tony! ACTUAL MONEY! HOW?” “That’s an ATM for you grandpa, now come along before I have to bail Captain America out for trying to rob an ATM.”) and over time, they got even closer. Like very close. Like THAT close. Enough for him to comfortably call Steve sweetheart in the morning when he got him his first cup of coffee and Steve just smiled fondly at him while blushing slightly (Clint went by and whispered something at Steve that made him blush furiously and left the room quickly with red face. Tony just looked at the scene confusedly while Clint doubled over laughing on the kitchen floor.). Tony, genius that he is, could not figure out whether the good captain is truly flirting with him sometimes or Steve is just a truly nice guy who is starved for contact after spending 70 years in the ice. Either way, he is not complaining, he’s just sexually frustrated.
“Well, then, clearly you knew my dad better than I did.” Tony said, raising one of his eyebrows, wondering what exactly made Fury suddenly more amused than ever.
On his 13th birthday, he had enough. Tony started stripping away his room of all his Captain America stuffs. He stripped down every poster, threw away every comic book, and even broke all his Captain America action figures. But the last thing that Tony couldn’t bring himself to destroy was Cap. The stupid Captain America special edition bear has been with him since his 5th birthday and he still took great care of the stupid bear. Eventually he gave Cap away to Dum E for “safekeeping” and went on his life forgetting all about it.
“Aren’t you disgusted by my childhood worship of you? The fact that I collected all your merch and stuff? And that I resented Howard for trying to find you in that ocean?”
Natasha slapped him across the back of his head. “OW WHAT THE HELL NAT??” “You’re stupid.” Nat said, munching on her own popcorns. “I kinda agree with that sentiment.” Bruce added, still fully immersed on the movie. Thor nodded sagely while smiling at Tony. “Me too!” Clint chirped. Assholes.
“…I am way too tired to process this entire thing right now. Can we have this discussion after I have my 12 cups of coffee?”
“Toodles.” Tony left on the elevator. “This guy is gonna be the death of me.” He muttered to himself in the elevator.
Steve’s heart swelled 10 times bigger and he smiled so wide. He tightened both his arms around Tony and settled down to sleep too.
Tony bristled. “So? I had Jarvis restore him after I got him back obviously because I ain’t going to sleep with a bagful of mothballs and tattered fabric. I have more respect for Cap than that.” He replied snobbily.
“Your hair is getting pretty long isn’t it?” he said, smoothing down Steve’s hair so it covered his eyes.
Finding out that the real Captain America is still alive and well and so fucking good looking is another bombshell that Fury, that fucking cyclops, forgot to mention to Tony. Meeting the real Captain America on the other hand, is not a fucking pleasant experience to say the least. Tony had put behind all of his worshipping days behind him, but childhood trauma of being compared to “the greatest human being alive ever” constantly by Howard is not something that he could overcome that quickly. And so, on the helicarrier when Rogers was being all righteous and talking all batshit about “laying down the wire” Tony couldn’t resist taking his own jabs on him and retaliated viciously. Then the explosion happened and they both snapped out of the scepter’s influence and quickly rushed away to fix helicarrier’s engine. Another day in the job for Iron Man and Captain America.
“I’m not here for that. I’ve been authorized by Director Fury to use any means necessary to keep you on premises. If you attempt to leave or play any games, I will tase you and watch Supernanny while you drool into the carpet. Okay?” Agent Coulson said while smiling innocently at him.
The mood went somber like in someone’s funeral. Steve is now looking so pale, like he’s about to throw up. “Tony…”
“For taking on Loki alone. He was out of his league. He should have waited. He should have…” Tony trailed on frustratedly.
And here he thought he got a great thing going with Steve. That it could lead somewhere. Now because of his own fucking stupidity, he ruined it. Like he ruined his relationship with Pepper, and Ty, and Whitney, and dozens other. Great job, Tony. He hugged Cap close to his chest, turned him over and gently brushed away the fur around his eyes. “Just you and me Cap. Just like old times.” He smiled sadly.
“Sir has been awake for 3 days and 16 hours. The last meal you’ve eaten was a smoothie made by Dum-e 18 hours ago.” Steve’s disapproving stare got harder and it just made him look sexier in Tony’s exhausted mind.
“Coulson was a collector,” She shrugged. “Showed me all of his collection sometimes during down times, although I must say, I have never seen this one model kept in such pristine conditions before.” She smirked.
Tony’s adult life isn’t exactly a walk in the park. Losing his parents at the age of 21, taking over Stark Industries with Obie, got his own fucking missile shrapnel in his chest inching towards his heart in the middle of fucking no where in Afghanistan, getting open heart and having to rely on fucking car battery for his life, building the first ever miniaturized arc reactor and a suit of armor from junk in a cave in the middle of the desert, losing his savior Yinsen while escaping from said desert, discovering his father figure Obie was the one who betrayed him, beating Obie down to keep Pepper safe, and privatizing world peace with his tech. So, yeah. Not exactly a walk in the park. Then comes palladium poisoning from the very thing that’s supposed to keep him alive. It’s almost like life is out to get him every instant of the way, like a very cruel fate writer just wants him dead no matter what and this time, Tony has had enough. He survived Afghanistan, he survived Obie’s murder attempts, but this time Tony could not for the sake of his life, figure a way out of this fucking conundrum. He started putting all his affairs in order. Appointing Pepper as CEO of SI, donating his money to various charities, and figure out a way to let the news out to Pepper and Rhodey. The last part of his task is the hardest thing to do ever in his life, and he was tortured in a cave in Afghanistan! So yeah Tony, being Tony, figured that the best way of telling the news that he’s dying to two of his most favorite people in the world is to act like an asshole and make them so mad that they wouldn’t be sad at all when he eventually dies. Never let it be said that Tony Stark isn’t a genius.
“Oh, I definitely will. Nat introduced Bruce and Clint to herbal tea the other day and that’s what we’ve been drinking as a coffee substitute.”
Tony gaped a little bit before smirking delightedly. “You just said fuck. You just said a swear word. J did you get that on video?!”
“Neither am I! He's got the same blood on his hands as Loki does. Right now we've got to put that aside and get this done. Now Loki needs a power source, if we can put together a list…”
“Well..” He took a peek at Steve who is still doing his best impression of a boiled octopus, face turning red all the way down to his neck while still clutching tightly at his coffee cup. “I destroyed all of it after the billionth time Howard spent his time out in the sea.” He sighed. “I mean it’s all probably in my files guys, you can read it yourself about my daddy issues and dear old cap here.”
“Young master, that looks like an excellent bear. I believe it is the limited edition Captain America bear they released for the 30 years anniversary of the dear Captain’s passing.” Jarvis said with a small smile upon looking at Tony with his prized bear.
One morning, Rogers showed up in the shared living room carrying all of his meager possessions which is exactly one, one duffle bag. All of them were sprawled around the couch and they were watching a movie together (The Lord of The Rings, because Tony likes to torture Clint with all of his Legolas jokes). “Hello mon capitan, how’s your journey across ‘murrica?” Tony asked while munching on a popcorn in his lap.
“What? What’s in my arms? Are you getting blind birdbrain, it’s obviously my Starkpad…” he looked down at what he is holding.
“Why the hell do you have him and where the hell did you find him? I actually lost him around the time I went to MIT. Dum E was supposed to be keeping an eye on him but around the time I went back to the mansion he was already gone.”
Every summer holiday, Tony went home with Cap to an empty house only filled with Jarvis and the other house servants. Howard still went on those expeditions every summer like clockwork, and his mother always spent her summer away from the empty house barren of her husband at her friends’ house, gossiping and sipping wine with her Italian friends in the vineyard. Over time, his appreciation and worship of Captain America started slipping away as his resentment grew and grew. He couldn’t understand why Howard would keep away from his family while chasing a ghost in the middle of the fucking ocean. He couldn’t understand why Howard can’t see him and his achievements and spend more time with him and that he would rather freeze every summer trying to find a dead man.
Tony went down the shared floor’s kitchen carrying something in his arms while rubbing the sleep out of his eyes. “Morning guys, what’s for breakfast today?” he made a beeline to the pot of coffee on the other side of the kitchen, not realizing that all of the Avengers are staring at him with different levels of disbelieve. Tony drank his hot cup of coffee quickly and realized that chatterings around the kitchen and living room had completely ended, and everyone are staring at him weirdly. “What? Never saw a tired guy just drank coffee before?”
Tony was dumbfounded by all of these revelations, he could only stare at Fury while gripping Cap tightly in his hands. “I-..I what?”
“YOU SLEEP WITH IT? THIS IS THE BEST DAY OF MY LIFE!” Clint laughed so hard he tipped himself over the sofa. Serves him right.
“Truly sorry sir. The security camera on the elevator is suffering from a minor malfunction, and hence no recording of Captain Rogers saying “Fuck” was saved.”
“You got this Tony. And remember, I got my eye on you.” Fury said while flipping his cloak like a stupid supervillain. Fucking cyclops.
“…tiring and also eye-opening. Stark can you just show me around to my room? I want to take a shower and a nap.” Rogers asked, looking every bit of an exhausted 70 years old grandpa that just babysat his unruly grandchildren. “Why captain if you want to take me to your room you should have bought me dinner first.” Tony waggled his eyebrows.
“That thing on your chest is based on unfinished technology.” He explained as if Tony didn’t know his own tech and its history.
“Tony please just come upstairs. You need to eat real food, then you can sleep in a real bed. After that I want to talk to you, okay?” Steve started to drag him bodily towards the elevator. Tony started struggling in his hold which just made Steve more annoyed. He eventually picked him up and carried him in a princess hold.
Tony looked down at Cap, “Right, Cap.” He brushed the fur away from his eyes. “There, you can see now. Let’s get to work.” And he got to work.
“Wha- huh?” Tony said stupidly. He was on his 7th day workshop binge ever since the great Cap bear fiasco and he’s pretty sure that Steve shouldn’t be allowed to come in.
On the 2nd summer since his father started going on these expeditions, he came back bearing a gift and a grim smile. “Here Tony, for you.” He said while gifting Tony a big box wrapped with colorful wrapping paper and a red ribbon on top. He quickly unwrapped it and found a big Captain America teddy bear, with fluffy fur that almost covered his beady eyes, complete with the full Captain America costume. “You got the Captain America bear!” shrieked Tony with glee, hugging the bear close to his chest. His father just grimaced and smiled bitterly at him. “At least this way one of us is more successful in finding him than the other. Take good care of him would you? Don’t lose him like I did.” “I won’t dad, thank you!” he said while running out of his father’s study to show Jarvis his new friend.
He named that bear Cap and took great care of him. Every night like clockwork, Tony would brush the fur over his beady eyes down to untangle it and brushed it away while whispering, “There, now you can see.” the mantra that Jarvis gave him so he could always took great care of Cap. Tony also took great care to never let him out of his sight. Cap went with him while he’s sneaking around his father’s workshop, trying to find bit and pieces of tech he could use to build his first ever robot so he and Cap would have a new friend to play with. Cap also went with him while he daydreams around the mansion, imagining battles against Hydra forces together with the Howling Commandos. Cap was also there with him the next summer, the first time he ever saw his father went on a drunken rage in his study, waving around his whiskey glass yelling at whoever was on the other side of the phone. Unluckily for Tony, Howard noticed him peeping around his office and slapped him across the face “to teach him a lesson” according to his father. That summer also marked the last time he ever called Howard dad.
“Stark what’s that in your arms?” Clint said looking manically gleeful, visibly holding his laughter.
“I KNOW!! They were talking about it on the TV and dad actually got me one!” Tony gave Jarvis the bear so he could inspect it more closely and feel as excited as he was. Jarvis took the bear and looked closely at it, taking great care to run his hands along the long fur of his bear and picking off any pieces of lint tangled in it. He noticed that the bear had such long furs around his face that some of it were actually covering his eyes. “Young master,” he said. “I believe your bear’s fur is way too long around his eyes, I’m afraid he couldn’t see well. Would you like me to cut it a bit so he could see better?”
“Fine, fine, come on Captain I’ll give you a tour of our humble abode and show you to your room. If you’re still interested you can just give J a holler.” Tony winked at Rogers.
“I’m sorry.” Rogers looks down to the same spot that Tony was looking at. “He seemed like a good man.” He offered.
eventually saved the day. Never let it be said that Tony Stark can’t play well with others and not recommended for the boyband initiative. Take that Natalie Rushman! Tony quickly modified the tower’s use as a glorified dormitory for other members of the Avengers. Bruce, his science bro accepted quickly with the promise of a state of the art lab and a quiet calm environment (sans Tony as the distraction though). Natasha and Clint came as a package deal and they just show up one day uninvited, eating breakfast in the common floor’s kitchen. Thor also came by after dropping Loki because he wanted to have a place nearby to “court the fair lady Jane”. By then, only Rogers left on a self-identifying journey across America and didn’t accept Tony’s invitation to be a fully functioning team together. Oh well, his loss then.
“I’ll put you down if you promise to eat and sleep! We’re all worried about you Tony, me especially.” Steve tightened his hold on Tony. That made Tony pause.
“..yeah okay, sure.” Steve lifted the blanket and slip into the bed with Tony. Tony immediately cuddled up to Steve and he put his arm around Tony’s shoulders. Tony looked up to Steve’s face.
“NO” cried Tony while grabbing his precious bear away from Jarvis. “Dad always said that he’s the perfect soldier, he doesn’t need anything fixed ever!” He hugged the bear close to his chest.
“JARVIS, look at what dad brought me!” he yelled waving around the bear while barging in the kitchen where Jarvis was preparing the evening’s meal.
Steve tucked him in gently with his weighted blanket and Tony instantly started to feel the fatigue from his wokshop binge. He yawned so hard his jaw cracked.
“I’ll have you know, I probably had the best and most complete Captain America memorabilia ever back then.” He smiled, remembering some of his best childhood memories.
Sometimes, when he tries to run away from his memories imaginings, he sees narrow wooden boards over a ripping current and he has to hold himself up on a bench or a tree or Tony to stop himself from falling stumbling.
And sometimes Tony lets his fingers scratch along Steve’s jawline and flinches when his nails leave red lines along it, as if he’s surprised to find his jaw clean-shaven, instead of bearded.
“It’s alright, though, we’ll come back again. And again. And again. We always come back again. The world won’t end while we sleep.”
He always drags Tony home, afterwards, both of them pushing, pulling each other into the elevator and against walls and doors and their bed. He always forces his eyes to stay open and on Tony’s face, always keeps at least one hand in Tony’s, pushing it into the mattress  beside his head, always kisses him deep and slow, until all he can taste is Tony and all he can smell is sweat and sex and all he can feel is Tony, against him and around him and inside him.
“Think about it, though,” he says, “just the two of us and the stars, flying through infinity.” His voice is hoarse and Steve watches the constant dribble of blood that trickles down from the side of his mouth get wider. He snorts bitterly.
“Yeah,” Tony drawls. “I know.” Steve tiredly opens his eyes again and watches him watch the sky. “I know exactly what you mean.” He turns his face back to Steve and his face is pale, eyes dull. Steve is bitter.
Sometimes, when he watches long enough, not concentrating on anything in particular, he sees another river. He sees New York crumble to dust and the desert merging from it. Sees the water rage and hiss at him, sees steel bars reaching out from the waves like hands, cold and wet and reaching for him.
And when Tony is asleep at his back, holding Steve tight and his hand still in Steve’s, Steve sometimes whispers I have you and I will never let you fall again and we’re  still around, just to hear something other than the unsettling silence of their bedroom.
Remembers the joy of finally having a companion, of not being alone under the vast, uncaring sky of the desert.
Steve laughs and he can feel the blood pooling on Tony’s armor under his cheek. “I like that one,” he says. “Very poetic.”  Truly together, for once, he thinks, but keeps that thought to himself. Instead, he shifts again and finds that most of his body has already become numb. “I just wish we could do more, y’know?”
Tony’s voice has become a soft murmur and the hand in Steve’s hair has stopped moving. Steve tries to open his mouth to speak, but he is so, so tired, and he can feel Tony’s heartbeat under the armor, quiet and unsteady and so he just thinks yes and you are right and I love you and sleep well, beloved, and he knows that Tony is smiling, because Tony has always known what Steve was thinking anyway, even when they were Steven and Antonio, the hanged highwaymen, or Stephan and Antonia, the indecorous lovers, or Grant and Edward, the builders that were collateral damage.
Sometimes, when he’s feeling homesick for a past long gone and decides to visit the East River, he has to stop and wonder at the slow, lazy way it drags itself forwards, wonder at the mighty Brooklyn Bridge as it arches elegantly across the water, its huge stone pillars that reach deep into the restless waves.
Sometimes, when he startles, he lifts his arm, moving his thumbs up to cock his gun and freezes when there isn’t the noticeable, reassuring click, when there isn’t the heavy feeing of iron and wood in his hands. But then he shakes himself out of it and lifts his shield. Forgets.
Sometimes, in the times between sleeping and waking, Steve remembers the calming, rhythmic movements of riding along the coach roads, the sun burning down on him and the soothing heartbeat of his horse, carrying him wherever his path leads him to. Then there is the sound of his alarm clock and the thoughts - memories? - fade away as if they never were.
And sometimes he feels ridiculous for it, feels stupid and weak because this isn’t anything new and I was born upon the tide and and I’m not weak and he very carefully shoves those thoughts - those feelings -  back down, refuses to think about them, about what they might mean.
“I’m sure you would,” he says, and doesn’t even bother trying to hide the fondness in his voice. Tony tugs on his shoulder.
And Steve finally, finally forgets when Tony pushes his heels into his thighs and bows his back and wails, and he hides his face in Tony’s neck, soft and warm and alive.
Sometimes he goes deaf and blind, sometimes he can’t breathe and he feels the air like concrete, pressing against him from all sides, from inside his lungs, and the only thing that keeps him from panicking are Tony’s hands in his, gripping back just as tightly. Behind his unseeing eyes he sees Tony, face slack with surprised panic, hand reaching towards him, reaching, reaching and then grabbing - to late, God damnit all to hell, too late again - and then it’s only Tony and the cold, cruel concrete that swallows them up greedily, Tony’s eyes, so vividly blue, so beautiful and so, so sad.
“What do you think,” he wheezes, and Steve has to tilt his head to hear him, “What do you think will we be next time?” His blue eyes shimmer with unshed tears and resignation. “I would quite fancy myself the dashing Captain of a starship,” he adds and Steve chokes out a laugh.
Sometimes Steve finds himself missing the sea-breeze on his face, and the smell of the ocean and the sounds of creaking wood and fluttering sails and watching the stars, telling them all his secret dreams and desires. And he finds himself yearning for someone to share them with, finds himself yearning for a home.
He remembers the weight of his sword, fastened securely to his belt - reaches for it sometimes during a fight, without thinking, wondering why his shield feels so foreign in his hand before shrugging it off.
He gets flashes of memories, sometimes, of blood and screaming and pain when he listens to some of the Republicans talk, spilling bigoted, homophobic bullshit. He feels his hand twitch towards his belt - to his sword? - when he’s sitting at a bar, listening to the bartender rambling on about sending them immigrants back to where they came from and them women not knowing their place anymore and those gays will all burn in hell anyway, because it’s not the first time he’s heard those words - knows it certainly won’t be the last time - and he will sometimes get the strangest of déjà-vus, can almost smell the blood dripping off his blade, can almost hear the screams and the pain and then running and running and running.
Sometimes Tony needed an escape, he needed to feel like he could let go and hide until the world couldn’t find him, but finding that escape wasn’t easy. The only time he came close was when Steve had him wrapped in his arms, lips pressing sweet nothings into his ear as his hands traced over his bruises and scars. Being just a little too soft.
“Tony,” Steve tried again this time stepping closer to the man who seemed to blink to life, if only momentarily, he spun his his chair looking up at Steve with haunted brown eyes before turning back around and realizing his hold on the wine bottle. He blinked a few times placing it on the table before him fingers lingering over the glass before dropping to his thigh and turning back around to really look at Steve this time.
He almost never stopped talking, his words sometimes bleeding into each other becoming their own language until Steve’s ears stopped being able to decipher what he was saying and he’d have to ask the man, the kid Jeesh he was barely eighteen, to slow down or at least remember that Steve couldn’t read his mind.
“I was wrong, so very wrong, you ar,e not just a gorgeous boy- you, oh you darling are a damn Adonis, magnificent and if I had not been brought up with proper etiquette, and wow would Jarvis be very proud of me I would crawl into your lap to see if you taste as good as you look. Oh,” The man noticed Steve’s expression, “Oh shit, sorry man, not gay? Damn, my meter is off are you-”
Steve pulls back, “I love the sounds you make,” He breathes into Tony’s ear. He groans again pushing back against the thumb at his entrance wanting to feel the burn of it entering him with no assistance. He needs the pain, needs to suddenly lash out of his own mind where he can do nothing but feel, feel and feel and God does Cap know how to make him feel.
“Steve,” Tony whispered close to his ear Steve shivered. He dared a look up at the man and was met with half mast eyes that were laced with worry.
“Cum for me baby,” He moans fist matching the haggard rhythm of his hips until Steve is tightening up around him, making it harder for him to slide in and out and God the sensation sends Tony over the edge as he cums with Steve’s name falling from his lips like a mantra and it doesn’t take long before Steve arches beneath him and covers both their chests in thick streaks of cum.
Tony was holding everything inside of himself, holding it all back as if it didn't exist. As if it didn’t matter that the woman he loved had left him. It did matter, it matter exceptionally because Pepper had been everything and more to Tony and losing her was almost like losing a piece of the man himself and Steve finally realized how much that woman had glued this broken man before him together. Steve moved closer to Tony, not really realizing his feet were moving until Tony’s breathe could be felt against his hand as he stood before his friend. Those ghost Steve hated knowing haunted Tony sprang to life in the man’s eyes as he looked up at Steve, blinked quickly and looked down at his calloused and scarred hands.
He was sitting on the common room couch with knees bent, a book propped on top of his knee with a twizzler between his teeth when Tony realized he was in love with Steve.
“You’ll like him, I swear, he’s awesome.” Steve kept messing with the collar of Bucky’s jacket, frowning whenever the brunette took a drag from his cigarette.
Clint nodded, leaning in closer to Bucky’s ear, warm breath brushing over his neck, stubble scratching across Bucky’s chin sending a shiver down his spine, “A Stark. Daddy owns half of New York, possibly most of California. He’s the heir to the Stark Industries company, super smart, super charismatic and kind of overall pain in the ass.”
Do not even get him started on the amount of self-control it took to keep himself from coming when he was fully sheathed inside of the engineer and moving into Tony so deep, so deep, he felt as if he took his first breath as a free man, so warm, so right so tight he had to pressed his forehead into Tony’s shoulder focusing on the pressure of Tony’s heels against his ass as he pounds into the love of his life because that was what Tony was. He had to be, This had to be some sick twisted deviation from fate pushing them together because nothing, nothing, has ever felt this incredible. Steve had loved Bucky, loved him with every inch of his being but even that paled in comparison to the quivering man beneath him begging him to “Go faster, fuck me harder, come on baby please,”
“Fuck,” Tony murmured letting Steve slip out of him with a burning loss before he fell to the bed. He felt his boyfriend move up beside him but the pressure disappeared leaving Tony aching and cold. He opened his eyes to see Steve re emerging from the bathroom with a towel and smile that sent goosebumps over Tony’s skin.
“Never mind, I don’t want to hear you say it, so I’m going to say it. I love you too,” He watched Tony whip his head towards him so quickly he swore they’d be in the medbay for whiplash later tonight. Those damned brown eyes opened so wide he could see the wheels turning in Tony’s mind trying to come up with a reaction, a response, some kind of retort that would glue this all together and make it make sense to him. Steve pressed his palm into Tony’s shoulder and forced the man to look at him, “It’ll be okay, Tony,”
“Ever since then I couldn’t be any happier than I have been in the last two years that you’ve willingly let me call you my boyfriend, it is willing right because other wise this would be-you know what never mind carrying on,” He paused again, “Steve, I haven’t been able to say this to you without wanting to eat my own tongue because I fuck this shit up so royally on an given day that I’m not sure you aren’t a secret spy from Hydra sent here to win me over before you kill me, but if you are, you’re totally earning your raise,” This time his pause was followed by a shuffling in his suit jacket and Steve watched every movement with a pounding heart terrified but on high alert. He was expecting Tony to pull out a phone, a Starkpad, maybe even a flask, he was not expecting Tony to pull an red felt box and to slide off the bench and drop to his knees.
“Bro, showers still exist in the real world y’know,” He slipped off the chair to wedge himself between Natasha and a tight-lipped Bruce. Tony’s eyes looked empty and hollow as he watched his teammate move across the room and something inside of Steve wanted to reach over and smack Clint upside the head. This was the first time in nearly three weeks Tony had stayed longer than asking for coffee with them and Clint had to go and say that? Natasha and Bruce had the decency to look anywhere but Tony. Clint still had his face scrunched up but instead of the breakdown Steve was expecting (and ultimately preparing for) Tony had nodded, placed his cup in the sink and asked JARVIS to start up his shower.
He thrusts up into him feeling Steve quake beneath him and when Tony hit the same spot he grins into the soldier’s neck. Steve is wrapped around like a koala on a tree, letting Tony fuck into his prostate as he moves his hips to meet each breathtaking thrust until Tony can feel that heating tingle starts in his spine, pooling into his balls to tighten against Steve’s ass. His hips stutter and lose rhythm.
It took Steve a while to learn that Tony liked things rough, at least a lot rougher than Steve was used to, that Tony liked to have control over Steve. That he liked to show that he is the cocky genius billionaire who knows not what the word “Stop” means, but there was another side to Tony. Aside from that usually comes out as a snide joke or a drop of his eyes when Captain America has to give a command.
Pure willpower was holding him together as he pushed into Steve’s hole, the warmth wrapping around him inch by inch until he was sheathed inside the super soldier balls pressing into his ass. Every single inch of his is pressed together with Steve, their bodies molded together, slotting so perfectly against one another that it ponders Tony’s thought on the world soulmate because no one, no one, could fill him or wrap around him the way that Steve does. No one could draw moans from his body like they need them to breathe. No one can kiss him the way Steve is with such tender passion that Tony quakes from the touch of his lips. His body shaking as he pulls out to push back in reveling in the pure ecstasy that his the love of his God damn life Steve Rogers. They move so perfectly in sync that Tony loses all concentration beyond the point of Steve’s moans, Steve wrapping tighter around and those lips are sucking on his neck.
“Steven Grant Rogers, I am stupidly telling you that I love you for the first time by asking you to marry me,”
Clint pulled his arm back and rubbed his neck, the other waving at the doorway, “UH yeah, no, sorry she just got back and wanted to have lunch before she went back to the apartment and I might have double booked myself,”
Steve couldn’t help but laugh as he watched his boyfriend stumble through the room discarding his clothes in various places only to have a robot reach for them and toss them where they belong. His eyes followed the curve of Tony’s back as he stripped his shirt off, then his tank top and Steve could see the bruises and cuts that he knew was littering all of their bodies. Steve wanted to kiss every scrape, every contusion and mark that scattered over his lover’s body. When Tony started to pull off his pants and drop them by the bedroom door Steve nearly lost his mind. The billionaire wasn’t wearing his usual briefs so the super soldier was met with a wonderful view of his ass that made the Captain want to take a bite.
“What are you doing awake,” He moved around the counter turning on the sink to wash his hands, running the water over his forearms before cupping some into his hands and splashing it over his face. He could feel the familiar tingle he got when Tony’s eyes watched his every move so he made a careful decision to leave a few drop across his cheeks as he looked up at his boyfriend. He was rewarded with a small gasp and a carnal look igniting within those gorgeous brown eyes.
Tony scrubbed at his skin until he was as pink as a baby, then he rinses blood and mud out of his hair until the water finally ran clear and he began to feel human again but also started to feel the panic rise in his chest. This was all his fault, his friends deaths will be caused by his hands and every right move in his head is a wrong step in his life. He can't keep them all safe no matter how hard he tries, he can't stop them from falling from skies and taking everything he loves.
The doctors kept telling him it would stop hurting; the therapist swore that eventually, he’ll become accustomed to the missing limb. That eventually, he’ll adapt to being armless (He still had a whole other arm, he wasn’t armless, stop saying that) but that it would take time and he would be okay.
He really wished they would understand that that wasn’t what made him not want to get up in the mornings. That wasn’t what made him skip six physical therapy appointments until Steve physically force (and when the hell did Steve get stronger than him?) Bucky out of bed. He could live around the pain, he could handle the nightmares of waking up and trying to reach for the darkness with an arm that wasn’t there, he could handle the phantom feeling that it was twitching against him.
“It’s all right, gorgeous,” He was pulling out a condom, “I’ll do all the work and you just get lost inside your mind.”
He would lie awake at night, staring up at the ceiling of the apartment Tony had bought for him, imagining that he could feel his arm being ripped from his body. Imagining that he could hear the scream coming from him as the paramedics lifted his body off the ground and the muscles and tendons stretched agonizingly as they took him away, but his arm stayed behind.
He nodded, “I’ve been trying,” She smiled checking his blood pressure, doing the regular muscle control tests before declaring he was ready and she would see him on Friday. Steve grinned at him the whole damn time, smiling away as if Bucky was his child and he was a proud parent who was just shown their gold star.
Steve noticed his friend peeking over his shoulder and quickly locked his phone, stowing it in his pocket before turning his face to hide a burning blush, “UH, that’s- he-”
“Okay, Rogers, now or never,” He murmured before knocking on the cool glass and listened for the music to be turned down but instead he was met with the same blaring Guns ‘n’ Roses noise as before. Sighing he bit his tongue let the retinal scanner identify him before punching in his key code and letting the door swish open. Stepping into the workshop felt like marching into a minefield. It was messy, Tony never really let it become too cluttered but to say it was disorganized was an understatement. Half finished projects had been pushed off into corners normally reserved for testing, hand-drawn blueprints crumpled up and tossed into the trash bins some crowding around the bins one was even stuck between a heating lamp and a prototype for the Iron Captain suit. Coffee cups were spilling over the recycle container, a few styrofoam containers laying waste on a work table Steve knew was usually used to test gauntlets. Amongst the mess with a bottle of expensive wine pressed to his lips drinking it just resting there as if the act itself was too much work, his usual artfully styled hair was an unruly mess, button-up shirt long discarded for a ragged-looking black tank top arms covered in new bruises and grease stains sat Tony himself.
“I like him, Buck,” He pleaded for his friend to understand. He knew Bucky would react negatively when he found out about Tony’s age and that Steve had said nothing about him after nearly nine months of knowing the kid, but it had become such a habit to hide this part of Steve that even after coming out he couldn’t quite break the routine.
Something in the back of Steve’s mind nagged at him. Told him to pay attention harder than he was because what Tony was saying had a different meaning, that there was multiple phrases coming from his words. Steve needed to read between the lines to get the answer he was searching for just remember how to decode cryptic messaging and here we go. He looked up at Tony, saw the man watching him with open eyes ghosts burning in fire behind the chocolate orbs that gave him all the clues in the world.
“UH-keep it G rated,” Steve adds before FRIDAYS says yes boss and suddenly the projection is lit up with footage from breakfast about two years ago.
Steve’s head went into overdrive as he picked up on the way Tony scratched at his neck, his eyes doing their darting thing when he wasn’t sure what to focus on. He hadn’t said anything for nearly ten minutes and Steve honestly cannot think of a time where Tony being silent meant something good was going to come from it.
“ ‘ When you walk into the room and all you smell is her perfume’ her perfume never lingered. I don’t know why, not really, but it just never settled in the sheets the way-” Tony sniffed again rubbing a hand across his face before breaking to a rueful smile eyes catching Steve’s before dropping again.
Tony looked up at him with pleading brown eyes and Steve’s mouth shut instantly, “I am going to need you to not say anything, anything until I finish okay,” He took Steve’s shaking hand and frowned, “Also calm down,”
“Please, please move, Steve please,” He rocked back against him and finally the super soldier gave way and thrusted his hips pushing in until Tony could feel his pubic hair before pulling back out with just his head stretching Tony’s hole before he pounded back inside of Tony. Repeating the rhythm over and over until Tony could barely handle the building burn inside of him.
He woke up covered in sweat, chest aching, shame wringing his body until he leaned over the edge of the bed and threw up.
He slowed his ministrations, “Am I doing something wrong,” Oh God, Oh God, he had very little experience at this. Maybe he had been too focused on how good it felt for him he had let Tony’s pleasure push to the back burner. Oh God.
“Fuck, yes, yes I want to fuck myself against your fingers, but God I’d rather fuck against you, Steve,” That heated the coil inside of the super soldiers stomach. He added a third finger, felt Tony tense up before relaxing and squirming around him.
A sharp, loud laugh sent him reeling asTony threw his head back shoulders shaking while clipped laughter escaped his chest. The twisted smile that pulled the man’s lips up wasn’t his normal full of light grin that he normally wore around Steve, it wasn’t even the predatory leer he reserved for the media known as his Stark face. It was cruel and ugly as tears slipped from his eyes, trailing down his cheeks to wiped away angrily as Tony kept shaking with laughter over and over causing Steve to tense in his spot. He had known there was the possibility of rejection to his help but this was sharp, cut right to the heart of the super soldier as his friend wiped more and more laughing tears from his eyes.
“Hi, I’m Tony,” The shorter man stuck out his hand, the other one already occupied by a beer that Bucky was sure he shouldn’t be drinking.
Clint and Tony fell into an easy push and pull conversation that left Bucky’s head spinning, trying to keep up with what they were talking about. Somewhere between “explosive arrows” and “painted dildos” Steve has wandered off and returned with a beer for the both of them. He kept glancing at Tony, smiling at the way the he was interacting with his friend, somehow dragging Sam into the whirlwind that was their conversation.
“Tony,” Steve snapped the man froze, fingers hovering mid-air before he dropped them and turned around to look up at Steve with indignation in those chocolate orbs. His jaw was set in a way that Steve wasn’t use to seeing on the genius, it made his teeth ache as bile rose in his throat.
“It’s okay.” he heard Steve say from the foot of the bed. Bucky tried to look, tried to turn to Steve and ask him why he wasn’t holding him, why Bucky wasn’t good enough?
Figuring it out meant Bucky had applied to a nearby community college that allowed for extension classes to be had on the university campus. It meant Steve worked grueling hours at the campus library during the school year, a coffee shop, and a children’s club during the summer, while Bucky worked nearly every free time in construction just to afford to survive.
That unleashed a dam of wanton desire. Tony moaned, arching back and letting Steve’s fingers sink into him over and over and he rocked his hips against his hand and begged to feel that brush of his prostate that would send fire through him. Steve scissored his hole as he fucked back against him, the pads of his finger finally brushing over that sweet bundle of nerves that dripped moans from Tony’s lips that could be heard from China.
‘Oh damn, Tony, ride me, God, I’m so close,” He pulled the man even tighter against his chest, feeling Tony moved his hips over his cock in a sensual delicious rhythm until he could feel Tony himself began to tighten around his length.
Tony ducked his head and Steve tucked him into his chest ignoring the wetness pooling against his chest, pressed his lips to Tony’s temple and softly thanked Sam for showing him that stupid dancing movie that gave Steve the inspiration to march his ass down to Tony’s lab and force the man to talk to him, yell at him or simply just cry.
‘Steve?” He was kneeling in front of the man, he knew what a sight he must be just dropped before him stunned over the length placed to wonderfully in his face.
The third time was actually an accident. They were in the compound’s living room, lounging on the couch for the first time in God knows when their fellow Avengers all spread out around the room doing various activities. Thor had been clicking through the channels, asking Clint what each show was until Tony couldn’t handle it anymore, “Just watch it and find out,” He had snapped causing a sharp look from his boyfriend to bite him down.
Tony was deathly silent. Mouth shut tight eyes closed off to Steve as he looked over the man’s shoulder letting the seconds tick by. For a brief moment, a flash of white-hot embarrassment went through him. He had been stupid to think this was what Tony needed, or that Tony even wanted him to be the one to help comfort him. He didn’t need Steve. Not really. The man had just assumed that Tony would want his help and Steve had selfishly hoped if he could offer himself, offer help, he would have the Tony shaped hole in his life refilled again.
“Naw,” He looked past the car hoping his mask held, “Not hungry.” Liar he was starving but anytime Steve brushed against him he’d flashback to his dream and it made him sick.
He looked down at the hand before biting his tongue and shaking it once, twice and releasing the appendage, fighting the urge to wipe his palm across his jeans. He would keep his cool tonight, really he would. He definitely was not planning on getting as smashed as possible until Sam dragged him out of here and deposited his drunk ass somewhere away from the lovesick eyes Steve was giving the brunette.
Deep brown eyes flashed with amusement, “Shy? Don’t be, darling, I’ve seen my fair share of gorgeous men shirtless,” He waved his hand, a bandage wrapped around the palm, “Besides I’ve taken some medical classes I just wanted to make sure I didn’t burn you."
“A what?” Clint kept making gestures with his hand, fingers moving quicker than Bucky’s alcohol addled brain could keep up with it. It wasn’t until Clint made a movement towards his ears that Bucky realized the gestures were sign language and he got with the program.
Tony moaned around Steve, his own cock twitching with anticipation as the super soldier starts to thrust into Tony’s mouth and repeatedly hit the back of his throat. Over and over again until Tony knew talking or swallowing would hurt and his stomach tightened as he gagged around Steve’s dick and took every single fucking inch like the damn over achiever he was. His nose repeatedly hit the course blonde hair behind the base of Steve’s dick and Tony could barely breathe in the scent before he pounded into him hard and fast his hand tightening in Tony’s hair,
He might not know exactly what Tony is going through but he knew a thing or two about heartbreak. “JARVIS, mute,” The music stopped filling the shop with shocking silence. Steve watched Tony’s shoulder tense before he shook his head side to side he didn’t say anything to Steve just kept typing in numbers over and over his fingers never slowing no matter how tense his shoulder had gotten.
“You want me to suck you, baby? You want my mouth around your cock showing how much I fucking love you,” Steve shoots a look down at him that earns a squeeze.
He googled it once, found some very awkward photographs of young ladies tied to bed posts or even some men strapped down with their ass in the air, but he found what he was looking for. Found the article about submissive and dominant partners and the roles they play. It took some digging but he found what Tony could be and it stuck with him for months. He begun to watch his boyfriend carefully, notice the way Tony would sigh when Steve’s hand lingered over his throat or how he'd blush when Captain America and Iron Man got into a screaming match.
“We’ve barely even started and you’re already so damn needy,” He leans down and licks over the slit, tongue lapping up the tangy precome and soaking up the throaty noises Steve makes.
“Yes Sir,” Tony had batted his eyelashes up at his boyfriend hoping to earn an eye roll and a ‘Just try to get some sleep,’ but instead he noticed the way Steve’s eyes had widened and his lips parted as he sucked in a quick breath of air. Tony knew that look, he’d seen it countless times on past lovers who were holding cuff for him to wear or barking orders for him to kneel.
“Sorry what?” Tony furrowed his brow, “I asked if you were okay that after breakfast we took a walk through Central Park?”
He will never deny that his mouth watered a little bit at the sight of how hard, red and wet his boyfriend was for him.
“Yes, I want to taste your cock. I want it to slide across my tongue and have it choke me until I gag for air, God Cap, fuck my face,” He didn’t mean to let all of that spill out. He was going to stop at taste your cock but the way Steve’s eyes widened as he begged for it made it all come tumbling down.
“You’re practically shaking for it,” Steve smiles down at him, “Licking your lips wanting to taste me, huh?” Their eyes meet and Tony has the decency to blush because yeah he fucking wants to swallow the Captain whole.
“Yes sir!” Tony cried as he came over Steve’s hand, white hot streaks spurting out and splashing across the scars from the arc reactor and Steve lost his mind at the sight and spilled over into Tony. The engineer rode over him slowly drawing out the orgasms they were both coming down from.
“They do this,” Steve leaned into Bucky’s ear, ‘I’ve caught them a few times when Clint’s been at the coffee shop with Tony and Bruce. It’s like they fall into a rabbit hole of who can say the weirdest thing the longest, and it usually takes drastic measures to bring them back to the surface.”
He kept the pressure soft, kissing across each hand print before biting down on tender flesh and causing Tony to make an extremely pornographic sound that shivered down Steve’s spine. He spread Tony’s cheeks even further apart, thumb brushing over Tony’s hole once more before he pressed a sloppy kiss to it listening to the mewls the genius release before he shoved his tongue into the tight heat and Tony nearly exploded beneath him.
Tony’s eyebrow rose once more this time staying near his hairline before he dropped it and wheeled back around in his chair, “Then thanks for the drop- by, Cap, but I’m pretty busy here,” He waved behind him in a parting gesture. Hands coming back up to the hologram to type in numbers Steve couldn’t follow. He stayed standing behind Tony for a few moments listening to that singer Tony always complained about but still listened to wail about about press printing lies. His stomach rolling over itself trying to decide what to do now. Did he leave? Did he stay and force Tony to acknowledge him? Nothing felt like the right thing to do in this situation. Closing his eyes he pressed his thumb and forefingers into his eyelids until he saw stars inside the darkness. His stomach lurching as his mind conjured images of the smile his friend usually wore how it melted Steve’s worries away even as he rolled his eyes at the man.
“Hey,” Tony leaned into his touch. Steve smiled, “Turn around,” there was a soft order in his voice that warmed Tony’s stomach. The brunette did as he was told and came face to face with the beauty that his Steve Rogers. No matter how many times he saw this man naked it would never be enough, ever. Steve seemed to be the embodiment of beauty and it wasn’t just his muscles. It was his smile, the soft tug of his lips as he looked at you with those damned all American blue eyes that made your skin feel washed in warmth.
