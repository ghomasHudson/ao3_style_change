It didn’t take long for Tony to suppress his feelings—to bury them so deep down inside of himself that he had forgotten what it was like to think of Steve as anything other than his friend.
The first photo was of the two of them in the elevator: because Thor managed to only capture them from the neck up, it looked a lot more family-friendly than it really was.  The second photo, however, was probably what Clint and Thor were getting so excited over: Steve had both of arms wrapped around Tony, the other man laughing as Steve kissed his cheek.
Steve’s mouth curves into a smile–a smile, Tony’s learned, that is only reserved for him–and the fact that Steve can still be so happy to see Tony after a terrible week and just look so damn
The kidnappers had given Steve an account wire some money to, and while the police weren’t able to use that to trace the owner of the account, Steve’s tech guys and Tony’s
Tony didn’t know who moved first, but it really didn’t matter, because the only thing that mattered at that moment was the fact that he was somehow kissing Steve.
.  You didn’t know me in my twenties… Which I’m actually very glad about by the way because you would’ve hated me then.”
Tony swallows. “What, like a shovel talk?” he remarks, keeping his tone as light as possible. The last thing he wants to do is give Bucky any indication of how much the man intimidates him. “If I hurt him in any way, you’ll kill me, right?  Well, don’t worry because Peggy, Natasha, Sam and even
“I don’t think setting me up on a blind date with a girl who is barely legal constitutes as trying to help me,” Steve said.  Why they had thought he would have anything in common with a behavioral neuroscience student, he had no idea.
Never in the two years that they’d known each other had Tony ever shown any signs of uncertainty, but that night, Steve’s heart had broken when he had heard Tony’s sobs of
“Who wants to accompany me on a wedding-related errand?” Tony announced to the room after hanging up the phone.
Tony gave a sigh of relief at the sight of Pepper forcing her way through the crowd. “Pepper, what—”
“I’m sorry, Mr. Stark,” the older woman says, and she does actually sound a little apologetic, “but unless you are on the approved list of visitors, I cannot allow you to go upstairs.”
“You won’t,” Steve said, determinedly. He cupped Tony’s cheek. “You won’t.  I’ll always have you, and you’ll always have me, because I love you.”
“We just… agreed to give each other some space for a little while,” Steve said, and even he could hear the doubt in his voice. “Just a little time to let things get back to normal.”
“Tony,” Steve took both of Tony’s hands in his. “Tony, I love you.  I know the possibilities of my… my future,” he said, a little remorseful. “Neither of us know what the future holds for us, but I
He most certainly ignored the way Steve was nuzzling at his neck, murmuring “I’m sorry’s” and “I love you’s” into his skin.
Even now, Tony could be surprised at just how easily and often those silences could creep up on them.
“Aw, no need for that, Cap.  I’m just telling it like it is,” Tony said before taking another bite of his pizza. “You’ve got the whole package,” he said with his mouth half-full.  It was kind of endearing, which Steve found strange. “So you’ve just gotta make it work.”
“Then call me ‘Rumiko.’  It’s only fair,” she said with a smile.  She sat down at a nearby table and beckoned Tony to sit next to her. “Why don’t you tell me about him?”
“I highly doubt that.” Steve reached for another slice of pizza, leaving the slice with more pepperoni on it for Tony.
,” he gasped when Steve rolled his hips.  Tony glared at the innocent look Steve gave him. “How you manage to fool
"I know the 1940’s were only six months ago for me, but I thought that’s what people did on dates… unless things have changed since then?"
Steve flipped them over in one fluid motion—settling himself between Tony’s legs and supporting his weight on one arm before spitting into his free hand and taking hold of both of their cocks.  Steve began to thrust into his fist, and Tony threw back his head at the incredible friction.
Tony’s breath catches when Steve steps out of his bedroom in a form-fitting navy blue suit fifteen minutes later, but the moment is short-lived because the photographer and make-up artists immediately swarm him.
.  You can’t expect me to pretend like none of this ever happened between us.  You might be able to do it, but I can’t.”  He turned on his heel and stalked away, fighting back the disappointment when Tony didn’t call for him.
“Look,” Steve starts, “Up until a few months ago, I didn’t think I’d ever fall in lo—feel this way,” he corrects himself, but it’s too late, because Tony’s already heard it.  “I was… content with my relationships, because they helped fill the void—if only temporarily.  But
Thor finds out when he goes to the gym for his weekly sparring session with Steve.  He sees Steve and Tony wrestling on the mat, but doesn’t realize anything is amiss until a few minutes later when they start shedding their clothing.
“Steeeeeve,” Tony whined, dramatically flailing his limbs and resting his chin on Steve’s broad shoulder.
“I thought you were some kind of genius,” Steve said, his voice breathless as he started to open himself up.  He hadn’t done this in some time, and he knew he probably wasn’t being thorough enough, but he really needed to get Tony inside him.
“I’m not an idiot, Tony,” Steve retorted.  “There’s something you’re not telling me and I want to know what it is.”
“You don’t think I know that?” Steve immediately regretted his outburst when Tony visibly shrunk in his seat. “I’m sorry.  I just… I’ve been trying, but it’s hard.”
Steve had no idea how Tony was able to just take everything in stride—a part of him was jealous of Tony’s ability, but a bigger part of him was disheartened to see how unaffected Tony was by the entire ordeal.
Tony flashed a smile at him, but even he knew Steve could see right through it. “You give people too much credit, Steve.”
He turns over on his side and finds himself face to face with Steve, and the events of the previous night slowly come back to him.
“What about Venice?” Tony suggests.  The last time he had been there was over thirty years ago with his mother. “We could go in September.  It’s supposed to be really nice that time of year.”
you are, Tony?  You’re handsome, intelligent and funny, and you always put others before yourself.  You do everything in your power to try to make the world a better place.” Steve reached over, tilting Tony’s chin so Tony had no choice but to look him in the eye. “
Never in a million years did he think Steve would be like this—so brazen and sensual and just downright
Steve looks unimpressed. “You’re seriously telling me that you can’t choose between your loving, doting, supersoldier boyfriend, or a mound of baked flour and sugar?”
“So this is what it takes?” Bruce says, amusement in every word. “A few G-rated compliments? You have entire legions of young women—”
Tony vividly remembers the phone call to the star registry a very long time ago; he remembers the skepticism in the operator’s voice when he had told them the name he wanted:
“It makes sense to me,” Natasha says after a slightly awkward silence. “I know none of us can remember anything since the Chitauri, but you two make sense.”
.  Steve had been on his grand motorcycle tour of the country when he saw the mug in a gift shop.  To this day, he still couldn’t pinpoint why the mug reminded him of Tony.
“He managed to escape the wreckage, but his shield wasn’t so lucky,” she says, jokingly.  “The poor guy is going to be crushed when he wakes up.”
“Thank you.” Steve gives him another sleepy smile, and yawns, yet again. “Mm... love you,” he slurs before drifting off.
“You clearly aren’t over it if your moping is any indication,” Bruce pointed out. “You haven’t spoken to one another in a week.”
Tony woke up a good ten hours later in his and Steve’s bed, with the first rays of sunlight just starting to peak over the city skyline.  He spotted Steve leaning against the railing on the balcony, wearing nothing but a t-shirt and a pair of threadbare pajama pants.  Tony put on a sweatshirt and grabbed a blanket before stepping out into the chilly November air.
Most wouldn’t consider light pollution and constellations to be normal conversation topics between two strangers, but for some reason, it seemed… well, fitting.
“If you say ‘fine’ one more time, Steve, I swear I will strangle you,” she promised. “You were out for a good twelve hours.”
Steve had learned very early on that the three most efficient ways of getting Tony to do pretty much
“I’m going to say the wrong thing again,” Tony pressed. “The last thing I want to do is drive you away, but I know it’s bound to happen.”
Steve paused, the pizza halfway to his mouth.  He eyed Tony skeptically. “What?” he asked, unsure if he had heard right.
“It is not in our style to surrender to pathetic weaklings such as yourself,” Thor quipped before sending him flying into a dumpster.
“And you won’t be doing any of us any favors by overworking yourself,” Steve said. “C’mon, you look like you need the rest more than I do.”
Tony flops down onto the couch and rolls his eyes at him. “Oh, calm down, you know I didn’t mean it like that.”
Prompt: BROKE NEWLYWEDS AU. Where Tony's been disowned shortly after graduating from MIT and their friends help them pay for a small wedding and they live in a cheap apartment while Steve waits tables and does art commissions on the side and goes to art school on a combination of scholarships and grants and Tony works at a mechanic shop while looking for a tech company that isn't afraid of SI destroying them for hiring him.
So he withdrew, and eventually drove Steve to move to DC.  And as much as Tony hoped that Steve would find someone else and move on, the mere thought of that actually happening devastated him.
Tony put down his tablet and then grabbed the nearest cushion, throwing it at Steve’s face. “Are you fucking kidding me, Rogers?”
He gives his two-weeks’ notice to Hill and spends the rest of the month looking for a new job.  The magazine he used to do a lot of work for had long-ago gone under, and he’s nowhere near qualified for any of the jobs he applies for, so he eventually goes back to the agency because, as much as Steve hates it, student loans are still a thing.
Steve edged forward, eventually resting his head on Tony’s lap and wrapping one arm around his waist while the other settled across his legs.  He buried his face in the thinning cotton of Tony’s sweatshirt, inhaling the familiar scent of soap and metal.
“Come on, you two,” Bucky says, exasperated.  “You’ve been in love with each other for over a year. Who knows when you two would’ve gotten together if this whole mess hadn’t happened?  Just kiss and make up already.”
The next three hours is excruciating, but the second the last crew member walks out the door, Tony crowds Steve against the wall and kisses him until they can’t breathe.  When they pull apart, Tony realizes he’s left creases in Steve’s jacket from where he had been gripping it too hard, and normally, he’d be apologetic about it, but after seeing the look of pure
of the spoon against the mug as Steve stirs in the milk and sugar.  It probably should’ve been awkward, but Tony’s glad to find that it isn’t in the slightest.
Steve and Tony never intended to hide their relationship from the rest of their teammates, but they didn’t feel the need to broadcast it to them all so soon either.
“I figured it was the perfect opportunity to go, since you wouldn’t know fine art if it hit you in the face.”
“This is all so sudden, Mr. Stark,” Steve says, feigning surprise. “Lucky for you, I’m free as a bird."
“He might, but I don’t,” Natasha says as she steps into the living room, Clint and Sam in tow with enough popcorn and snacks to feed a small army.
“Yeah, well I’d rather you step on my feet for the rest of my life than dance with anyone else.”  The words leave Tony’s mouth before he can even stop them, and when Steve pauses and takes a step back, he thinks he’s said the wrong thing.
Natasha’s look remained passive. “So?  You two sleep in the same bed all the time.  Why is it such a big deal?”
,” Tony responds, as if that makes all the difference, and then proceeds to eat half of the concoction in one go.
—was never boring. Each day brought along a new adventure and a different set of challenges, and no two days in the
“Tony, wait.”  Steve reaches for the other man’s hand, stopping him in his tracks. “Do you want to try sleeping with me?”  He blushes. “I mean, in my bed?  It might… help…?”  Steve was trying to refrain from revealing that he hadn’t been able to sleep well either, even if it was a little selfish.
the team!” Tony snapped. “Isn’t that the issue? Isn’t that why we fight; so we can end the fight?” he added, his voice rising.  “So we get to go
“Don’t sass your mother like that,” Steve joined in, making Thor and Clint double over in laughter, and Natasha to choke on her soda.
The morning after their fifth date, Tony walked into the kitchen only to get a newspaper unceremoniously thrown at his face.  Just as he was about to chew out Clint for the rude wake up call, Bruce walked in and handed Tony yet
the time—” The yelp that escapes his mouth when Tony tackles him is less than dignified, but he doesn’t voice any complaints when Tony pins his arms above his head.
They were so immersed in the kiss that they failed to hear JARVIS tell them they finally arrived at the communal floor of the tower; failed to notice the elevator doors open, or Clint and Thor waiting outside the doors with devious smirks on their faces.
Tony stopped in his tracks and turned towards him. “You want to get married, and I don’t,” he stated. “I don’t have any business being here.”
That was a nice sentiment, but one that Steve didn’t think was very likely.  His terrible streak of dates over the past year were testament to that.  “I’m not looking to just date
More than anything, Tony wants to take Steve in his arms and assure him that he’s okay—that they’re both alive and okay, and both sitting together on that street curb.  He wants to kiss him and just lose himself in Steve’s touch, but he knows it isn’t a possibility with so many other people around.
“Steve gave me that mug years ago!” Tony said. “You know I—” His rant was cut short by the sound of his phone ringing, and a quick glance at the caller ID told him it was Pepper. “Whatever the papers said about me is a lie,” he answered automatically.
Steve had gently pried the glass from Tony’s hand before enveloping the man in his arms, letting him cry into his shirt.
“You love it,” Tony counters, taking Steve’s hand and sucking the frosting off of his fingers. “And I love you,” he adds, kissing his nose.
“But not as much as you love cupcakes,” Steve remarks as he watches his boyfriend lick his hand clean.  He feels the familiar pull of arousal low in his belly.
by many of his teammates, but only one of those teammates has had a star named after him in a similar fashion.
Tony didn’t even realize how lost he was in his own thoughts until he saw the look of concern etched on Steve’s face.
know,” Tony drawls, “that we both have to be at very important meetings in forty-five minutes.”  He kisses Steve’s nose before getting off the bed.
Steve blushed. "I was under the impression that we are… were,” he corrected, kicking his boot against the concrete floor.  "Now, I’m thinking I probably misread things.“
They meet fall semester of their junior year in an art history class.  Steve needs to take the class for his major, but Tony’s only there for the elective credits.  He gets to class, skims through the boring text book for a couple minutes and almost walks out, but Steve (who is running a few minutes late because of practice) stumbles in and sits next to him, and Tony thinks the class might actually be all right.
Prompt: I really, really need a Steve Tony break up fic. Which focuses on the being broken up and THEN getting back together. Ideally, they would be broken up for real for quite some time, maybe date other people in the meantime but in the end, they just love each other, okay?
He remembers Steve putting the mark there earlier that night—the two of them had just gotten back from dinner and barely made it into the elevator with their clothes on, and Tony’s head was spinning from the champagne.
“Hey, every florist in Manhattan was closed!” Steve protests. “Is it my fault I got home late from a mission?”
A smile tugs on the corner of Steve’s lips. “You have to admit that it usually still results in some sort of screaming though.”
Instead, he wrapped his arms around Steve in a tight embrace and let the larger man sob into his worn college sweatshirt.
Pepper stated, and Tony could practically hear her rolling her eyes at him all the way from the Pacific.
—Steve was belatedly realizing how bizarre that particular detail would probably seem to others and was glad the others didn’t know about it… At least, he
…but the man lying on the scratchy blanket with him in the middle the deserted section of the park does not have any of the confidence of the man who Steve fights alongside with.
Steve could feel Tony’s cock pressing against his entrance—the anticipation of finally having Tony inside him was great in itself, but Steve wanted more, so he wrapped his legs around Tony’s waist.  Tony got the hint and finally pushed forward, not stopping until he was buried to the hilt.
In public, it’s always Steve who initiates any sort of intimate contact; whether it be a simple peck on the cheek, innocent handholding, or a make-out session in a semi-public place that is so steamy it’s practically fully-clothed sex.
Steve was still unconvinced, and it must have shown on his face, because Tony just shook his head and linked their hands together.
Natasha gapes. “Are you kidding me, Stark?” she says, slamming her fist on the table.  “You wait around here for
“Richards says they’re stuck in another dimension,” Tony informed as he surveyed the scene below him. “Spider-Man just finished up with a bank robbery, but he’s coming from Brooklyn, so who knows how long it’ll take for him to get here.”
It took almost no time for them to shed their clothing.  Steve’s hands cupped Tony’s ass and pulled him forward so they could grind their cocks together.
Tony talks about how much he thought of Steve throughout the day (all day) and how much he misses him when they’re apart (a
Steve wanted to tell him otherwise, but he decided against it.  “Did you really have fun tonight?” Steve asked once they entered Tony’s room and shut the door.  “You can be honest,” he added. “I know you’re probably used to more uh, upscale things.  Something fancier than some silly boardwalk games and—”
Tony raises his hand and presses it up against the window, and the vibrant city lights dull in comparison to the brilliant gold band on his finger.
Steve was doing absolutely sinful things with his tongue that made Tony want to buck up into the warm, wet heat of Steve’s mouth.
“Steve, please,” Tony begged.  One of his hands moved from Steve’s shoulder to his wrist, holding on tight.
He knows the others had seen visions too, but Steve didn’t seem affected in the slightest.  Looking back, he realizes he shouldn’t have assumed.
“I don’t see what the big deal is, Steve.” Natasha remarks, examining the document she’s holding. “You guys are married, after all.”
“Our waitress was blatantly flirting with you, and you didn’t flirt back,” Tony informed as he inspected a piece of pepperoni on his pizza.
Tony’s situated at his work bench, fine tuning something in one of the gauntlets of the Mark XLV.  His hair is in disarray, there’s a bandaid on cheek, and a dark smudge on his right arm.  The man looks up and peers at Steve through his safety goggles (which are so scratched that Steve’s surprised the man can see through them at all anymore) and he smiles, and Steve immediately feels like all of the tension leaves his body.
“N-no,” Tony gasped out when Steve sucked on the head again.  Tony stilled, thumbs shifting down to press against Steve’s cheeks, seeking the shape of his own cock in the other’s mouth. He licked his lips. “No, I wanna… I wanna do this together.”
Tony to have a genuinely good time—not to be bored out of his mind.  Steve had learned a lot about dating over the course of the past couple of months, but he had also learned quite a bit about Tony himself.
Tony didn’t realize he had dozed off until he came awake when a warm, damp towel came into contact with his stomach.  He opened his eyes and saw Steve cleaning up the mess on his body. “Thanks,” Tony mumbled.
Tony clears throat, trying to sound as authoritative as possible. “You have got a lot of explaining to do, Rogers.”
The feeling of Steve filling him up again and again was illuminating—each slide never feeling like enough, but simultaneously being too much for him to take.
“Tony,” Steve said lowly, almost a warning. He felt a shiver run down his spine from the expression on his lover’s face—if they could still be called that.  He brushed his thumb over Tony’s bottom lip to wipe away the drops of water. “Come on. Get up. You’re getting dirty.”
Tony found the room easily enough, but was surprised to hear the shower already running in the en suite.  He slid off his jacket and hung it on a nearby chair before taking off his tie.  As he toed off his shoes, he caught the end of the first verse of
Tony laughs a little at the irony of the situation: in the year that the team’s been together, Tony was usually the one that got injured in battles, not Steve. “I’ll be back in a few hours to check on you, okay?”
“Just the check is fine,” Tony said easily. “But I wouldn’t mind getting another one of those thousand-watt smiles you’ve got there,” he added.
Natasha’s seen quite a bit in her life, but she’s never seen such an expansive supply of booze disappear so quickly.
, Tony wants to say, but bites his tongue.  He’d go to the ends of the universe for Steve without a second thought.
Steve started up the shower and went over to the sink to brush his teeth as he waited for the water to heat up.
Tony looks at him imploringly. “What missions could they possibly have without SHIELD on their asses every day?”
“Steve,” Tony said quietly. He closed his mouth, thoughts piling up behind a tight lump in his throat, and all he could do was call Steve’s name again in the hopes that its cadence held the words he couldn’t voice.
Steve does, and is surprised to see that Tony is standing less than a foot away from him.  He takes a deep breath and mulls over the apology in his head.
Steve was right: in their line of work, they never knew what could happen.  Either one of them could die
Tony stops in his tracks, surveying the scene in front of him with a puzzled look on his face.  There are rows of white chairs adorned with hundreds of flowers—
“I kind of figured that, what with how Hill singled me out.  Besides, what difference does that make?”
Steve shook his head, but his gaze didn’t drift from the dark robe that Tony was wearing.  “No, just… that robe looks awfully familiar,” he said, studying the intricate gold embroidery.
Steve just grabs Tony by the arms, practically pulling Tony on top of him.  Steve hides his face in the material of Tony’s shirt. “M’okay now,” Steve says, hugging Tony even tighter. “‘m very happy.”
.  He feels light, like he has no care in the world.  It’s easy to lean into Tony’s space and drape an arm over Tony’s chair.
“Don’t be mean,” Steve admonished. “Don’t listen to Tony, little guy.  He’s a cranky old man,” he cooed to the beagle in his arms.
The couple broke apart at the bright camera flash, choosing to glare at their teammates instead.  However, given their disheveled appearance, it wasn’t very effective.
Despite the fact that Tony had no more interest in the party scene, there were some occasions that still required his presence.  After all, hosting parties and playing nice with absurdly rich investors was part of the job description for one of the most prominent businessmen in the world.
“Okay.” Steve traced Tony’s jawline with his thumb before leaning in to press a sweet kiss to the corner of Tony’s mouth. “Okay, I’ve got you.”
Steve continues sending Tony gifts throughout the week: a box of chocolate truffles from the gourmet shop across town, a mixtape of his favorite music, and even an obnoxious giant teddy bear.
“I’m sorry for making you worry, but I’m not sorry for what I did,” Steve says quietly. “I’ll do whatever it takes to keep you safe.”
And okay, maybe there’s a sex tape or two, but those don’t count because they were intended for private viewing.
“Tony?” Steve calls, surprised to see him.  Most of the bruises on his body have disappeared, but he still looks worse for wear.
“Yeah, I know,” Tony replied quietly.  His hands came up to rest at the base of Steve’s neck, his fingers playing at the short hairs there. “I love you, too.”
“Hi,” Steve says, paying no mind to Clint.  He realizes he’s still grinning at Tony, which would be embarrassing under normal circumstances, but he feels so
The lack of care for his own personal being culminated about six weeks after the break up when Tony insisted he was well enough to suit up for the battle, when in reality, he had been going on over sixty hours without sleep.  A slight miscalculation landed Natasha in the emergency room with a mild concussion, an injury that would have been much worse had Thor not swooped in and carried her off to safety.
“Don’t bother, every room is booked,” Tony said, immediately regretting it because it was now glaringly obvious to Steve that he had already tried to avoid this exact situation. “I mean—” “You’re right.  It’s just for one night,” Steve said.
“Tha—Wait, what?!” Steve exclaimed, getting the attention of some passersby.  He tipped his baseball cap to better obscure his face and lowered his voice. “What are you talking about?” “You and Tony are romantically involved, are you not?” Thor asked.
“You should blush more often,” he says, and brushes his thumb very lightly over Tony’s cheek, a tiny smile curling his lips. “It suits you.”
Tony whined when Steve pulled away a moment later. “Why’d you stop?” he asked. “I never said you could stop kissing me.”
“God knows I want to give you what you want, Tony, but you should be with someone who actually deserves you—”
“Fine,” he says, crossing his arms indignantly.  “I want to date you because I don’t want you seeing anyone else.”
“You’re here,” Steve breathes out, looking at him in amazement, like he can’t believe Tony had even bothered to fly down and see him.
Today’s mission had been a relative success, but there were still some casualties—six, to be precise, and Steve thinks it’s six too many.  He takes the elevator down to Tony’s workshop, keys in his personal code, and trudges through the sliding glass door.
Later that night, on the way to his room, Steve passes Tony’s quarters and sees the bouquet on his nightstand.
“This wasn’t the worst thing to happen to the company, Pep, or even any of the Avengers for that matter.  Remember Clint’s 4Chan debacle?”
And by that, he means getting belligerently drunk and sending him multiple incoherent texts and voice mails.
He must not say anything for a while because Steve suddenly looks worried and Tony wants to punch himself in the face for making Steve feel that way.  “Tony?”
They lay there for a few moments, catching their breath, before Tony tangled his fingers in Steve’s hair. “I love you too, beloved,” Tony murmured against his lips before kissing him lazily.
“I’m guessing this wasn’t supposed to be part of our team bonding today?” Natasha remarked. “Where the hell is the Fantastic Four?  Or that Spider kid?” she asked, jumping back just in time to avoid the Wrecker’s crowbar.  Clint took the opportunity to jump over him and kick him in the face.
Tony’s friends worry about his attachment to the star athlete, but Tony just shrugs it off and goes on a date with someone from his computer science class just to prove a point.
“Obviously steak,” Tony replies. “Nothing beats a good steak with roasted potatoes.  Oh!  And creamed spinach, of course.”
,” Steve said, his voice gentle.  “I know you just want the best for her—and don’t take this the wrong way—but you really need to learn when to back the fuck off.” “I suppose I could work on that,” Tony grudgingly agreed.
For all of the shit he’s been going through as of late, Tony actually thinks his life is going pretty well.
bed—and he can’t help the stupid grin that forms on his face because Steve is his, and he is Steve’s.
“You’re going to tell me that the money doesn’t matter, and that it never mattered, and all you want is for us to be together because we love each other, blah blah blah,” Tony said in a flippant tone, but the look on his face was anything but confident.
"Thank you," Tony says when they get to the communal floor of the tower. "No one’s ever…" He ducks his head a little. "Tonight was great.  I had a really nice time."
Steve gets sick and takes some Asgardian medicine to get better.  Tony thinks he's an adorable patient.
“I love you.”  Tony realizes it’s probably bad form to say right before fighting an army of murder bots, but it’s too late to take it back now.
When the team re-convened in the middle of all of the wreckage, Tony had opened up a compartment in his armor and pulled out a bag of licorice.
“The gardens are right around the corner,” Steve suggested, getting to his feet. “I thought some greenery might be a nice change of pace from the cement and concrete we usually see.”
They’re lying on a picnic blanket in Central Park hours after the sun has already gone down, and Steve doesn’t even realize how long they’ve been there until he notices the flashing lights of a plane flying overhead.
“I didn’t do this so Steve would love me,” Tony answered. “I did it because I already love him.  I love him more than I’ve ever loved anything. He’s worth it.”
Tony knew this was a bad idea, but he ignored the little voice in his head telling him to stop.  It had been a long time for Tony, and Steve was
“More than whatever that jackass was willing to give you,” Steve mutters under his breath, which Tony finds absolutely endearing.
Steve opens his mouth to continue yelling, but stops himself when he notices the young SHIELD agent cleaning the cut on Tony’s forehead. “Agent, could you—”
Tony looks over and sees that Steve’s entire body is practically vibrating with tension. “Are you all right, Steve?”
, the paparazzi know exactly when Tony is out and about, so in the past few years, he garners this reputation as a
Reed’s mouth sets into a hard line, but he motions for Steve to enter the machine once the levels are steady. "I’m sending you back to exactly two minutes the incident.  I’m not sure how long it will be until we can get you back, given the limited amount of time we’ve had to set this up,” he informs.  "There’s no guarantee that you can change the events, and even if you do, we have no idea what other else could transpire because of it.  I can’t guarantee that everything will turn out okay, but Bruce is right: the world needs Tony in this time, and I believe it’s still a risk worth taking.  We just have to prepare for the worst.  Do you understand me, Captain?“
have done differently?” Tony demands, his tone bordering on hysterics. “Look, I know I messed up, okay?  But I saw a way to prevent what Wanda showed me, and I thought I’d… I…”
“As much fun as this was, Cap, I’m kind of beat.  I doubt I’ll be able to stay up for another movie.”
“These trips can get a little lonely,” Tony admitted.  He took a seat on the bed. “It’s nice to have the company on my downtime.”
“Wait, what?” Steve glanced between the man and their waitress before settling his confused gaze on Tony. “What just happened?”
Tony’s hips jerked off the bed, and Steve continued massaging the little bundle of nerves as he stretched Tony carefully, but efficiently.  The pleasure was so immense that he didn’t even notice
“So you’ve been dating Steve for a while now, huh?” Bucky says with a gaze so intense that it takes all of Tony’s willpower not to fidget.
“Hey, don’t get us wrong,” Clint says. “We don’t give a fuck what you guys do; we’d just appreciate it if you kept it behind closed doors.”
Prompt: The Avengers get hit with a spell/beam/illness that makes them all come down with amnesia. But it's decided that telling the world that the Avengers are out of commission is too likely to incite a panic, so they end up muddling their way through while trying to learn about themselves. EVERYONE assumes Steve and Tony are dating, even Steve and Tony, so when they get their memories back it comes as kind of a surprise that they weren't. (Rhodey, Sam and Bucky may show up and laugh at them)
Tony knew the exact weight of Steve’s words.  He’d accompanied Steve to enough nursing homes and seen the resigned look on Steve’s face when reality set in and Steve realized all over again that they had all moved on.  He’d recognized the longing in Steve’s eyes whenever he spoke about Peggy, and heard the hollowness in his voice whenever he mentioned Bucky.
“Squirrels,” Tony replies with a chuckle. “No matter what he did, the squirrels would always find a way to eat them.  Ever since then, he swore off roses.  He wouldn’t even let anyone bring them into the house.  To be honest, I’m not a big fan of roses either.”
“How could I not?” Steve said softly. “Tony, you gave me a home and made me feel like I actually belonged.  You’ve put up with me, laughed with me, and fought with me.”  Steve pulled back to look him in the eye. “You’re my best friend and the love of my life, and I want to be with you for as possible.”
It only took another minute before Steve came down Tony’s throat, one hand clutching the cover beneath him and other grasping lightly at Tony’s hair.  Tony hummed around him gently as Steve rode the aftershocks of his orgasm, stroking his thumb over the jut of Steve’s hip.  He had barely gotten Steve’s cock out of his mouth before Steve pulled him up for a kiss.
It’s well past midnight, but the band is livelier than they were three hours ago, and the party goers are hanging off one another like their lives depend on it.
He and Pepper had promised to stay friends after their break-up, but to this day, there was still a disconnect between the two of them, regardless of how hard they tried to bridge that gap.    “Something on your mind?”
“I meant it as a compliment,” Phil assures.  “Prince Steven was rather unkempt when I fetched him this morning.”
“It’s fine. Water under the bridge,” she assures. “It didn’t take very long for both of us to realize we were making a mistake.  He’s happier now than he could have ever been with me.”
“I think… Sometimes I think I’m dreaming or something,” Tony admitted. “That one day, I’m going to wake up and I’ll find out that the past three years weren’t real because it all just seems too damn good to be true.”
Tony was just glad that they were all on the same side because he doubted the world would stand much of a chance if Natasha and Pepper decided to try their hands at world domination.
, which Tony may have found a little odd considering it wasn’t in Clint’s repertoire of music, but it
“I’ll stay at the Four Seasons and give you a few days to gather your things,” Tony says, dodging Steve’s question.
“You want a distraction; I want an escape,” Steve states.  “And I’m a man in my twenties with a stressful job and a lot of pent-up frustration. I have needs.”
“I…” It was at that moment that Tony realized he had absolutely no idea why he was keeping Steve up. Sure, he wanted to talk, but… well, it wasn’t exactly fair for him to unload all of his insecurities on Steve
The quiet way that Steve says his name is what finally makes Tony look back up, but he doesn’t even get the chance to get lost in the brilliant blues of Steve’s eyes because Steve hauls him closer and kisses him.
He goes to college and spends mornings in class, afternoons in the studio, and nights partying with his friends.  His roommate, Bucky, introduces him to Peggy halfway through sophomore year, and she and Steve hit it off right away.
Steve responded by hitting him over the head with a pillow. “Idiot,” he muttered, but the smile on his face was fond, and Tony couldn’t help but smile back.
Steve’s always admired Tony’s attention to detail for all of the dates he’s planned for his exes, but it isn’t until he comes to terms with his own feelings for the man that he realizes it’s Tony who always does the romancing.
“You weren’t a few hours ago,” she said, obviously displeased. “Thor had to carry you out because Tony was too shaken up when he found yo—”
He brought his knees up to his chest, trying to will the cold away, and burrowed deeper under the covers.  The rustle of the sheets was enough to slow the tapping of Tony’s fingers on his tablet before stopping altogether.
“I’m a mess, Steve,” Tony answers tiredly.  “I know you’re looking for a forever, and I can’t give you that.”
has work to do. The difference is everyone else puts aside some time to sleep and eat a proper meal every now and then.” “I’m fine,” Tony insisted.
Steve just sighed and rolled them over, trapping Tony between his body and the mattress. “I love you.”
“Not a chance,” Rhodey said sternly. “Everyone’s worried, Tony.  We haven’t seen you like this since—”
needs him: I can’t even fathom the implications that… that Tony’s death has on the progress of humanity for the next fifty years.” He looks at Steve apologetically.  "I’m sorry, I don’t mean to be so–“
“For so long, I thought I knew what I wanted,” Steve confesses. “I thought I had it all figured out, but then I met you, and I realized that I didn’t know
They do it again a few times over the summer before they go off to college, and Steve uses it as a learning opportunity.  He learns how to fuck, what it’s like to
“I was there!” Tony’s sad smile faded from another burst of anger. “I was there the whole time, Steve! Where were you? Gone! Every time I came out of that lab since you first left, you weren’t around. You were like a fucking ghost and it wasn’t like I could interrogate everyone without giving away your dirty little secret!”
Tony nodded, standing his ground. “We made a deal: twenty years of my life in exchange for twenty more for you.”
“Did Steve tell you guys about his huge crush on Tony, yet?” Sam asked as he and Clint approached the table.
.  Tied to the vase is a note indicating that the arrangement is from a “secret admirer.”  Tony brushes it off like it’s nothing, gulps down a shot of espresso, and grabs a bagel before heading to his office.
Like their namesake, the stars are an ideal—a constant in Tony’s life, guiding him and steering him in the right direction.  They’re something that Tony can aspire to be, but a status that he doesn’t believe he’ll ever be able to attain.
Their movie date ended up being cut short because Doctor Doom decided it was a perfect night for sending out his army of Doombots to terrorize the citizens of New York.
Between the shouting, and the bright lights, the police storming into the room, and his kidnappers crying on the floor, Tony felt like he was in the scene of a movie.
Thor took out his flask and poured some of the contents into his glass. “Are you sure you do not want any, Steve?” Thor asked.
Some days, Tony will be so immersed in his work that the only acknowledgement Steve will get is a ‘hello’ and (maybe) a quick peck on the cheek before the genius is back to coding or wiring or… whatever it is he does.  But Steve just sprawls on top of the worn leather couch in the corner of the room and listens to the sounds of the workshop until they lull him to sleep, like the steady hum of the machinery in the background, or the subtle beeping coming from Dummy’s charging station.
“Yeah, you’ve said that befor—shit, fuck, ow!” Tony curses when he trips and stubs his toe on Steve’s shield.
, Nat!” Steve exclaims, his voice slightly higher-pitched than usual. “Tony listed me as the primary beneficiary in his will a
Steve merely rolled his eyes and shrugged his navy blue jacket off his shoulders and held it out in Tony’s line of sight.
So the first time they sleep together, Tony doesn’t even hesitate to bottom.  In fact, he’s the one that rolls them over on the bed, spreads his knees and positions Steve in between them, silently pleading to just take him already.  But Steve is slow and tender; so painstakingly attentive and unlike any other person Tony’s gone to bed with.  When Steve finally enters him, Tony feels like he’s coming out of his own skin. Steve kisses him gently, hands touching every inch of skin on Tony’s body.  It isn’t rushed in the slightest, but Tony’s never felt more worn out than he is now from Steve’s languid movements.
“I’d be happier if you went out a bit more.  You’re supposed to be getting something out of this arrangement too, remember?  I don’t want to be the one holding you back—”
“Who did what?” Clint asks, casually draping an arm around her shoulders.  He knocks back the rest of the Jack and Coke in his glass. “Did I miss something?”
“That isn’t the statue of David,” Tony said, frantically scribbling numbers on his tablet. “It’s Clint.”
God, he hated this. He absolutely hated feeling like he was some pathetic, lovesick teenager begging his boyfriend to pay attention to him. But he kept seeing the jagged edges of the broken shield and he had to--he just had to try to get through to Steve how much he meant to Tony, how far Tony would go to make sure that what Wanda showed him would never come to light.
“N-no,” Tony stammered, suddenly feeling warm all over for reasons that had to do with more than just Steve’s proximity. “It’s fine.  You did fine.”
“Oh.  That… sounds good.  Great, actually.”  Tony leaned forward in his seat, resting his chin on his hand. “Did you have anything in mind?”
“It’s Natasha’s birthday this weekend, but she’s going on a mission tomorrow, so I’m throwing her a party tonight at eight,” Tony explained. “Both of you are obviously invited.”
“You guys get on my case when I don’t go to work, and now that I’m here, you’re still on my case,” Tony said tiredly. “What do you want from me?”
for cooking,” Steve said, ushering Tony to one of the barstools. “Now sit your ass down and enjoy it.”
“Steve,” Tony says, and the way so much of the tension in Steve’s body abruptly leaves is miraculous, to say the least—like Tony uttering his name was some sort of spell.
“Your self-sacrificial streak is ridiculous,” Tony said. “You turned yourself into a capsicle and now you’re stuck here in the future with me.”
His parents were never exactly the doting type.  They never told him they loved him.  They never touched him unless absolutely necessary, but even Tony knew that a pat on the back didn’t actually equate to affection.  They didn’t go to his recitals or science fairs, or parent-teacher conferences, so their deaths don’t really affect Tony as much as he believes they should.
Once again, Tony isn’t sure what it is that comes over him, but he pulls Steve down by the collar of his shirt and kisses him.
“You’ll find someone,” Steve says with a sad smile, “Someone who’ll give you everything you want and treat you the way you should be treated.  Someone—”
He feels like he should be angry at his parents for depriving him of any closeness, but he isn’t, so much as he’s hurt by the fact that any chances of it ever happening are no longer a possibility.
Tony very nearly walks right back out of the kitchen when he goes in the next morning and Bruce, Clint, and Natasha are sitting around the counter.  Natasha spots him first, and her mouth curls into a wicked grin. “Good morning, Mr. Great Laugh.”
But being on the Avengers had given Tony the opportunity for so much more.  They were a group of people that Tony genuinely cared about—a group of people he didn’t even
“Oh. That’s… that’s good.”  He smiled wryly. “I’m sorry, I’m just having a difficult time processing all of this.”
Tony felt his heart clench, phantom pain from the removed reactor spiderwebbing from the center of his chest. Of course. Bucky. He should have known. The only thing more important to Steve than saving the world.  Saving Bucky Barnes—there was no way Tony could ever be part of that.
Steve gave him an appraising look before shrugging his shoulders. “You would’ve done the same for me.”
Tony splutters and ducks his head, hiding his face behind his forearms. “It’s not—that’s not what this is... I—”
Steve peers at him through half-lidded eyes. “Like what?” He’s still working on catching his breath, and Tony takes pride in the fact that he can do that to Steve.
"I’m really sorry if I made things um, awkward.” Steve rubbed the back of his neck. “If we could just forget all of this and–and just go back to our regular work rout–Why are you laughing?"
It’s pretty ridiculous actually, because in the photo, Steve is wearing an open flannel button-down over a ratty band t-shirt, shorts, flip flops, and a backwards hat—and he looks like the guys that make fun of Tony in his classes (the ones who drive their new Audis to school and go drinking at their parents’ beach houses in the Hamptons)—so he reminds Tony of the guys he
them?  Tony was disappointed to realize that while he had more knowledge about the subject than Steve did, he didn’t have much practice.
"You love it," Tony counters, taking Steve’s hand and sucking the frosting off of his fingers. "And I love you," he adds, kissing his nose.
“Because you seated your parents with them and put me and Steve with your weird extended family from Colorado.”
“You mean you’d rather me hurt you than the other way around?” Steve clarified, and the other man said nothing. “Tony, why do you always try to find ways to punish yourself?”
“As a matter of fact, I am.”  She didn’t have to know that Tony had only turned twenty-one a month prior. Besides, Tony’s pretty sure that the drinking age in Steve’s country is lower than that in the states.
“Fuck,” Tony breathed.  It had been three months, but Steve’s touch was still achingly familiar.  Steve leaned forward with a smirk, pressing a kiss to the damp skin of Tony’s hip.
Tony never gets the time to think about it, but that’s only because he gets distracted by a letter in the mail informing him of yet
“Hi,” Tony replies easily, and his cheek twitches like he’s holding back a smile.  Steve finds himself attracted to the man’s mouth, to the carefully trimmed black hairs of his mustache.  He reaches up to touch it and then decides midway that he probably shouldn’t and curls his fingers into a fist, dropping his hand into his lap.  He looks up again and meets Tony’s gaze. “Your goatee is so precise.”
Steve thanked the AI and busied himself with the waffles, measuring out the ingredients and mixing the batter.  It wasn’t until he was waiting for the batter to cook that he took his first real look at Tony that morning.
He wants to finish this argument and kick Steve out of his workshop once and for all so that he could find someone who would be more deserving of the love and devotion that Steve has to offer, but Steve’s next words only make him freeze in place.
“I’ve been down here for almost an hour,” Steve said, a little irritated. “And we’ve been holding a conversation for the past fifteen minutes.”
"Well, for one, I prefer being asked on dates in more conventional ways,” Steve says. “Not under the pretense of work."
“Right.  Of course, mother,” Steve says, licking his lips.  He stands up and makes his way to the door. “I’ll go get our coats,” he adds before slipping out of the room.
He can’t help but steal another glance at Steve’s drawing: it’s been five years since Steve came down to his workshop and shyly presented him a stunning portrait of him in the armor, but Tony’s positive that the novelty of being the subject of Steve’s art is never going to wear off.
“I know,” Steve replies.  He fingers the gold band hanging off the chain around his neck: it’s a habit he had gotten into ever since Tony’s death, but this is the first time he’s let anyone actually see the small piece of jewelry. “I’ve got to try anyway."
Thor chose that moment to step forward and put a reassuring hand on Tony’s armored shoulder. “Are you all right, brother?”
Tony moves his head to avoid it, but Ty just brushes his lips against Tony’s neck instead.  “Ty, please, I really don’t want to—”
“It’s not going to work, Steve,” Tony interjected. “And if keeping this a secret didn’t bother you, you never would have brought this up in the first place!”
Tony’s heart aches a little because he knows Steve works extremely hard, but he still has never seen Steve look so tired or worn down.  When Tony finally makes his presence known, the hard lines on Steve’s face immediately disappear, and he practically lights up when they make eye contact.
Steve said, his voice rising. “You’ve been avoiding me ever since Paris.” “That’s not true,” Tony said, eyes downcast.
“It just did!” Tony says. “He was here for that talk, remember?  I walked with him to the lecture hall beforehand and then after he asked me to dinner.”
Tony wasn’t the type to lie: it was no secret that he had gotten around when he was younger, but none of those experiences could have ever prepared him for this.  The onslaught of sensation he got from Steve’s fingers alone was almost too much to bear, but he still wanted
“It wouldn’t be the craziest thing to happen to us this week,” Steve said, his voice barely a whisper.  He was looking at Tony expectantly, his eyes searching as if he were trying to gaze into the darkest corners of Tony’s mind, and Tony had never felt so vulnerable before, so exposed and so
Tony’s glad that Pepper isn’t there to see him stumble and almost knock his mug off the table. “Is that so?” he asks, keeping his voice as level as possible. “What did it say?”
Thor chuckles, a deep, rumbling sound that Steve loves.  He twists a little in his chair so he can lean on the table to tell him: “You’ve got a great laugh, y’know?” which makes Thor laugh even harder.
each other,” Steve clarifies. “We’re supposed to be a team, and you shouldn’t have to fight your battles alone.”
Steve does something that could only be classified as a ‘pout’ and Natasha’s not sure how a supersoldier could look that adorable. “I don’t have commitment issues.”
As a child, he spent winters in bed, swaddled in every blanket in his family’s apartment as the other kids on the block played outside in the snow.  His teenage years weren’t all that different except that he had Bucky to keep him company.
“Are you sure there isn’t something I can do?” Tony said—he was not begging, but he had a feeling it was something very close to that.
Tony’s giving Steve everything he has to offer, opening up his body to accommodate him, and meeting every single one of Steve’s movements.  He lets Steve take him apart and put him back together, over and over again.  Tony feels exposed letting Steve take him like this, but he doesn’t feel
Tony was a surprise, though.  Steve had half-expected him to fall asleep, and half-expected him to be constantly checking his phone.   But despite the occasional vibrations signaling new notifications, Tony never took out his phone.  His eyes were glued to the performance for the entire duration of the show (in fact, he only took his phone out on one occasion during their whole outing, and it was to take a selfie of the entire team outside of the theater).
“Hey, if you’re all gonna be living under my roof, you better get used to my rules,” Tony proclaims, making the other three look at him with bewildered expressions on their faces.
Steve slouches back, turning his attention back to Tony, and pats his thigh—a little too rough, he thinks, but he’s feeling kind of clumsy. “Not as great as yours, Tony.  I mean, I can feel your laugh right in
Tony loves it when Steve gets desperate.  He’s always a considerate lover—always making sure that Tony comes before he does—and Tony loves it, but Tony also loves driving Steve crazy.
“Whoa, watch it!” Tony grabs him and just barely keeps him from tipping over and cracking his skull open.
”  He yelps when Pepper abruptly shoves him into the rec room, which gets the other two men’s attention.
It had been one week since Steve had woken up next to Tony after the best night of his life, and one week since Steve and Tony had come back from Paris, and one week since Steve had heard from him.
“It was a beautiful wedding, Pep,” Tony said, putting on his best smile. “I had a lot of fun, but I think I’m gonna head up to my room.”
Steve knew that it was wrong for him to have judged Tony before even formally meeting him, and even more wrong to make those accusations before getting to know him.
in the sand should be a felony,” Tony mutters, even as he places his own shoes on top of the growing pile.
Tony sat up and looked down at the man lying next to him—his face was smushed against the pillow, his hair unkempt, and the boxers he had haphazardly thrown on were riding so low around his hipbones that Tony could see the array of bruises that would surely be gone by the morning.  Tony had no idea how anyone could look so innocent and yet so absolutely
“Okay.”  Steve abruptly gets up from his seat and gathers his things. “Well, this conversation has been lovely, but I’ve gotta go.”
“I’d have said something sooner if I’d known,” Steve says ruefully.  He reaches into his pocket and pulls out another note, one that is crumpled and evidently worn.  Tony wants to ask how long Steve’s been carrying it around, but his breath catches when he sees what’s written on it.
“No, I’m not.  Not at all.” Steve whips around in his chair so quickly he almost knocks his mug off the counter. “No one should ever treat you like that, Tony.”
Tony turns his back and pours two cups of coffee for them, and hands one to the other man before retreating behind the safety of the kitchen island.  He tries not think about the absurdity of the scene: of Bucky dressed up and ready for work, and Tony cooking barefoot in
“Well, excuse me,” Tony snapped. “It’s not like you answered your phone when I tried calling either.”
“Accept,” Tony commanded.  He fell back in his chair just as Pepper’s face materialized on a hologram. “Hey, Pep.  What’s wrong?”
either, but that happened too.  Tony’s never been so dependent on anyone—never in his life had he ever felt the need to just be
Steve just closed his eyes and leaned back on the bed, trying to block out the bright lights of the room. “Oh, how the tables have turned,” he mumbled.
“It’s fine,” Tony says, cutting her off.  He isn’t here to talk about his dead parents; he’s here to see Steve.  Honestly, that revelation is a blip on the radar compared to finding out that he was one of the people HYDRA specifically targeted to eliminated.  “So… yeah.  Back to the news: they’re useless.  Really useless.  I mean, aren’t they supposed to talk about things that are, I dunno, actually
Tony's lost in the pleasure of it all.  Steve's worshiping Tony's body like a temple; he's putting Tony's needs before his own, and that's when Tony realizes that what they’re doing
“No, I’m not.  Not at all.” Steve whips around in his chair so quickly he almost knocks his mug off the counter. “No one should ever treat you like that, Tony.”
“Why are we here?” Tony asks, but Pepper just smiles and ducks out of the elevator before he can stop her. “Pepper. Pep!” he calls out, stumbling after her. “Pepper, wait, what are you doing?  Stop!  Just hang on a second—whatever you’ve got in your head—just
So he goes back to school and does what he can to forget about it all: he drinks more, tries more drugs, and gets in bed with more people than he can remember.  He falls into the wrong crowd, but still manages to keep up a friendship with Rhodey (he’s the sole reason why Tony makes it out alive in the first place).
In the twenty-eight plus years that Tony has been living on Earth, he had had one serious relationships with a business associate shortly after taking over Stark Industries, but that had crashed and burned within six months.
Steve feels the heat in his cheeks grow even stronger, pleased and embarrassed all at once.   Over the last eight months he’s developed the worst kind of crush on Tony, and even the slightest bit of attention from the man makes Steve’s heart skip.   He takes another drink in an attempt to hide his reaction and to avoid Natasha’s knowing smirk.
Steve looked up from his drawing to see Tony walking towards his table.  His suit jacket was unbuttoned, and his tie haphazardly stuffed into the front pocket.  Upon closer inspection, Steve noticed the dark circles under his eyes, but the man was still smiling.
Steve was mortified when he realized he was blushing.  As far as Steve knew, Tony lacked a brain-to-mouth filter and said whatever was on his mind.  Steve had gotten used to it, having learned when to take Tony seriously, but comments like that could still throw him for a loop .
Steve had camped out on the couch in the room after tucking Tony into his bed, keeping an eye on him to make sure he didn’t get sick.  Tony had apologized profusely for his behavior the next morning, too embarrassed to even look Steve in the eye.  Steve had assured him that it was all right, making Tony promise to find him if he ever needed to let his frustrations out.
“I’m no better than you,” Steve says. “That’s why I…”  He sighs. “You’re always saying that you’ll never be as good as I am, but that’s just… That’s not true.”
Tony pulls back a few moments later, and for the first time since Steve’s known him, the brunet looks…
that seemed even remotely interesting.  He had to admit that events such as this also bored him to tears, but as team leader, he couldn’t let that show.  While Thor was still telling battle stories, Natasha, Clint and Bruce appeared to be in deep conversation.  Tony was, of course, at the center of the room surrounded by throngs of people; his voice a perfect accompaniment to the live jazz band playing on stage.
“I overheard you talking to Clint,” Tony interjected. “I may be a lot of things, but I’m not–and I quote–a
“I totally forgot that I have a thing,” Steve says.  It’s such a blatant lie, but Tony’s kind of curious to see where this goes. “Natasha just texted me to remind me about it.”
“Wh—what?!” Steve sputtered, scrambling to get up from the chair to follow the other man into the house. “You… Why are you
They usually consist of dinner or a movie, and end with the girl (or guy) asking to go back to Tony’s place.
“What can I say?” Tony says through a mouthful of chocolate cake. “It’s my superpower.”  Tony can feel Steve watching him unwrap another cupcake, but he can’t find it in himself to care.
He was laying claim to Tony’s mouth and coaxing sounds out of him that Tony didn’t even know he was capable of making.
Steve was always observant.  Heightened supersoldier-senses aside, he always had an eye for detail.  As such, it was no surprise that after a mere two weeks of living in Avengers Tower, he noticed a number of surprising quirks and habits that his teammates had.
Tony continued to hold him, even when his tablet chimed to notify him of a new e-mail.  Steve hoped it wasn’t too important.  He tried to squash the surge of guilt that pushed its way to the forefront of his thoughts, but it didn’t matter because Tony’s tablet chimed again.  Twice.
Unofficially, it’s Steve, who whispers it to Tony in the very early hours of the morning while the man is still deep asleep.  It happens about two months into their relationship.  Steve knows that getting into a relationship with someone like him isn’t easy, let alone for a senior at MIT… so he decides to keep it to himself, instead choosing for the “right” moment to say it.  The very last thing he wants to do is overwhelm Tony so much that he decides to leave.
“You were working, and I…” Steve trailed off, the words dying in his throat. He was tired of feeling like this—of constantly being plagued by the cold, seeking Tony out because, for some reason, he was the only person that could always make him feel even the slightest bit better.  Tony had always assured him he didn’t mind, and the selfish part of Steve indulged in that even if it made him feel guilty at the same time.
of you is pretty!” Pepper calls out just before the elevator doors close, and the noise Tony makes after is definitely not human.  Tony’s surprised that the skin hasn’t already melted off of his face.
He’s played this scenario in his head countless times, so he’s prepared for Steve to put up more of a fight.  He’s ready for Steve to rebuke every one of his calculated claims, but it never comes.
“Natasha is right,” Thor said. “We are concerned about you and Tony and would like to know if there is anything we can do.”
In the twenty-eight plus years that Tony has been living on Earth, he had had one serious relationship with a business associate shortly after taking over Stark Industries, but that had crashed and burned within six months.
“Tony, look at me.”  Steve gently butt his head against Tony’s shoulder when he refused to acknowledge him. “Please?”
“I really don’t deserve you,” Tony continues, “but I’m going to spend the rest of my life—the rest of
Steve’s job is by no means an easy one, but on particularly stressful days, he likes to go downstairs to Tony’s workshop.
“How could I after that?” Tony shot back. “He was acting like it was just another normal day— like we
Tony sighs and slumps down to the ground. “I’m sorry.  I just… I didn’t want to tell anyone yet.  This thing is still new and I have no idea where it’s going, and—”
The gifts continue, until one afternoon where Pepper goes to Tony’s office to inform him that all of Tony’s evening plans were cancelled for a dinner reservation at Tony’s favorite restaurant.
But one morning, a picture of them walking out of a restaurant together makes the front page of all of the papers, and the morning talk shows can’t get enough of Iron Man and Captain America’s secret love affair.
Steve climbed back on the bed, dropping the items on the duvet.  Tony sat up against the headboard and picked up the string of foil wrappers, scrutinizing the packaging. “You can’t get anything, right?” Tony asked.
"Hey, no, don’t work yourself up over it,” Steve reassures. “It’s just a stupid magazine, right?  They live off of stupid rumors like this.”  He scratches his throat and quietly adds: “It isn’t like any of it is true."
There’s nothing but the shocked faces of the reporters, and the faint cries of her teammates behind her.
Steve stood and plucked a pair of boxer shorts out of his luggage and slipped it on.  He looked back at Tony and saw that he was already completely dressed in a pair of dark-wash jeans, a plain gray t-shirt, and matching striped socks on his feet.  Nothing about the ensemble was particularly striking, but then again, Tony had the ability to make anything look high-end.
?!”  Steve didn’t he’d ever felt pain like this; to hear Tony say those things.  “Tony, please, just tell me—”
, Steve.  You’re going to rule your own country one day and everyone’s going to adore you even more than they do now.  Me?  I’m just the fucked up kid that my womanizing father and alcoholic mother had just so my father’s legacy could be handed down to someone,” Tony explains. “I’m a spoiled brat with a borderline drinking problem who doesn’t know when to shut up.  I’m practically destined for the same fucked up fate as my parents.”
“What? Tony, no!” Steve embedded the ax he’d picked back up into the base log and took the one long stride to stand in front of Tony again.  He grabbed the engineer’s forearm to keep him from leaving. “I tried to tell you after… After I got back to the to—”
“Mrs. Arbogast came to the PR meeting today and she showed me a certificate from the International Star Registry.”
Thor nodded in understanding. “Perhaps you can paint a portrait of our team; when you have the time, of course.”
Steve learns what Tony likes and doesn’t like, and he lets Tony fuck him as his hands grip the cotton sheets.
He wants to let Tony know just how good sex can be—that it’s more than just two people trying to get each other off.
Tony retracted his faceplate after landing next to Steve. “No problem.  Since family time got cut short, how about we all go to dinner?  I’m in the mood for pizza.  What about yo—”
“Trust? Nat, he was completely out of line. Don’t they have to swear that he’s of sound mind and body—”“
Steve scoured the cabinets for a pan to fry some eggs in, but stumbled upon a waffle iron instead.  “Hey, JARVIS, do we have any waffle mix?”
“Of course!” She then turned her full attention to Steve. “And what about you, hon’?” she asked sweetly, her hand brushing against his shoulder. “Can I get you anything?”
“Probably,” Steve agreed.  He couldn’t help the smile on his face as he watched Tony get off the bed and walk over to his suitcase, rifling through its contents for his toothbrush.  The man was completely nude, save for the sock on his left foot.  It was a seemingly innocent picture until one took in Tony’s messy hair, the darkening bruise on his neck, and the light sheen of sweat drying on his skin.
“I know.”  Steve was silent for a moment before adding: “Sometimes I can’t believe this is the kind of life I have, but I’m just glad you guys are in it.”
“You want me to fuck you good and hard?” Tony says, rutting against him. “Right up against this wall?”
“Me, too,” Steve agreed.  Between Tony’s company, Steve’s missions with SHIELD, local supervillains, and bi-annual alien invasions, it was hard for him and Tony to find any time together.  It was even harder to do anything without telling everyone else about the nature of their relationship.
Steve talks to the reporter for almost two hours, and when they shake hands, Tony thinks they’re finally done, but then Steve apologetically reminds Tony of the cover photoshoot.
Steve had had Tony’s cock in his mouth and blown him within an inch of his life not five minutes ago and now he was
Tony wakes up with a headache, but surprisingly, it isn’t one of the worst he’s ever had.  He looks over at his nightstand and finds a couple empty water bottles, which helps explain his not so unbearable state.
“What about that guy over there?” Tony asked, inconspicuously gesturing towards a young brunet man wearing a charcoal suit. “He’s been making eyes at you all night.”
“What kind of spy do you take me for?” Natasha said, rolling her eyes. “Of course I’ve known about that.  We’ve
“At least let me take another look at it.  I promise not to make any changes without your permission.”
Tony moves away to place a kiss on Steve’s forehead before taking his hand and leading him to the couch.  Tony sits and lets Steve lay his head on his lap.
Tony was sitting on the couch lazily flipping through the channels. “Don’t worry, there’s one of you and the rest of the team too.”
, and a few weeks of stolen kisses in the hallways, a series of not-dates, and more nights spent together than not).
Tony didn’t know if the Doombots had some sort of personal vendetta against Steve’s clothes that night, but he really couldn’t give a damn with Steve’s perfect physique staring him in the face.
alerts him of a phone call, and Tony gulps down half of the contents in his mug before accepting it. Pepper’s voice rings through the speakers in his lab a moment later:
“I guess we can resume planning in the morning,” Tony relented, placing his tablet on the nightstand. “Do you want to watch a movie?”
“More than whatever that jackass was willing to give you,” Steve mutters under his breath, which Tony finds absolutely endearing.
“A real bore,” Tony answered.  He made his way to the fridge and grabbed the orange juice before drinking directly from the bottle. “You guys do anything fun while I was gone?”
Steve’s just walking through the front door of his apartment an hour later when his phone chimes with a simple, one-word text message:
“Where do you expect me to put my limbs if you insist on sleeping like a starfish?” Steve countered.  His face immediately reddened at the outburst. “Uh…”
Pepper is also the one that takes a photo of Tony’s slack-jawed face when Tony sees Steve, dressed to the nines in a dark blue suit, waiting for him at the table.  She pats Tony on the back before making her exit.
“What were you expecting, Stark?” Amora asked, her lips curled into a teasing smirk. “This isn’t a Disney movie.”
Tony gets up from the couch and smooths the wrinkles out of his suit jacket, very aware of Sarah’s intense gaze.  “I’m sorry if that was inappropriate or—”
“I figured as much,” Steve says, leaning forward and pressing their foreheads together. “I’m not good at this.”
Steve bit down on Tony’s collarbone, and the contrast of the pain with the pleasure building inside of Tony’s gut was all he needed to reach his climax and spill all over his belly.  Between Steve’s relentless pace, and the friction of his own cock between their bodies, he was surprised he’d lasted as long as he had.
“That was cute, too!” Steve exclaims, delighted. “You should do that more.” He can hear their friends laughing and he’s just glad they’re so happy too: he’s sad that they don’t get to be happy enough. “You’re a swell guy, Tony,” he sighs and lays his heavy head on his arms.  He’s awfully sleepy and Tony is terrifically warm.
“I’m fine,” Tony says quickly. “I uh… I couldn’t sleep.”  He fidgets with the hem of his t-shirt. “I actually don’t know why I’m here, but I think this actually happens a lot and… Fuck, I’m sorry I woke you up.  I’m just gonna… go now…”
Tony rips the covers off of the bed. “C’mon, we need to get ready.  Pepper’s going to have my head if I’m late again.”
Maybe Steve had yet to learn how to wine and dine someone, but somewhere along the line, he had certainly learned how to embrace being a public icon.
Steve murmurs a sincere “thank you” to the medic before she scurries off, and then he turns his gaze on Tony. “You okay?”
by it.  I meant that you could be out there right now with anyone you wanted, so I don’t understand why you’re wasting your time helping
It took a surprising amount of energy for Tony not to dwell on Steve’s statement. “You’ve destroyed five motorcycles ever since we started this whole team shtick.”
“Oh, that’s—What the hell are you doing, Barton?” Tony asked, eying the familiar red and yellow mug in his hand.
“A sword?” Clint finished.  “Yeah.  Cliché, I know.  Luckily, it wasn’t too deep, and with your serum, Banner and Cho are convinced you’ll be back in fighting shape in just a couple days.”
“No, I mean, for… what you did earlier,” Tony clarifies. “I know you think it’s nothing, but I really do appreciate it.”
Tony settles for discreetly reaching for Steve’s hand and lacing their fingers together. “I'm here.  I'm here now with you, and that's all that matters.”
“I didn’t expect to see you here,” Natasha says as the doors slide closed.  She leans against the wall casually, but all of her attention is on him.  “At least, not this soon.”
He’s barely able to let out a “what the fuck?” before he’s blinded by camera flashes.  Of course, he chose
!” Tony says, looking him in the eye again. “Do you really want me to go through every single reason why we shouldn’t be together?”
The cat jumped up on the couch and gently butted its head in Tony’s hand.  Tony got the cue and started scratching behind its ear, earning him a contented purr, and that was all it took for Tony to fall in love with the cat too.
“Yessir.  I’m j-just finishing, sir.  Captain, sir,” the agent stutters, before hastily placing a bandage on Tony’s wound and leaving.
Tony whined when Steve withdrew his fingers, but he didn’t have much time to mourn the loss because Steve’s cock was easing inside him instead.  His head fell back onto the pillows as Steve continued to push forward at an agonizingly slow pace.  It seemed like hours before Tony finally felt Steve bottom out, his hips flush against Tony’s ass.
“That was over ten years ago,” Steve recalled.  Ten years ago, when Steve had woken up to find his entire world ripped out from under his feet. “You barely knew me then.”
love you, Steve.”  Tony’s beyond frustrated that those three words can’t even scratch the surface of the depth of his feelings for the man in front of him, but it’s a start.  He pulls back far enough to plant a kiss on Steve’s lips.  “I love you,” he says again when they part, and the smile Steve gives him in return is
Steve hadn’t even realized what he had said until it had already left his mouth, but when he saw the genuine surprise on Tony’s face, he found that he really didn’t care.
Of course, Steve knew that Tony was an outgoing and eccentric person, but over the past eight weeks, Steve had realized that Tony enjoyed other, simpler things too.
Tony had gotten rid of every ounce of liquor in his suite and stayed clear of the stash on the common floor.  He began to work less, ate and slept normally, and spent more time with the team.
Tony buries his face into the crook of Steve’s neck, and feels Steve’s arms curl around him protectively.  He doesn’t feel like he’ll ever truly deserve Steve’s love, but he’s grateful for it all the same.
Steve approached him slowly, tentatively reaching out and taking Tony’s hands in his. “All I want is
"He needs to,” Bruce adds, surveying the monitors around the room. “The Avengers need him.  Hell, the
“You told them Steve and I are dating,” Tony said point-blank.  Things between him and Steve had improved since their wedding errand a couple weeks ago, but they were by no means back to where they had been.
Steve gently pried the sketchbook out of Tony’s hand.  He signed the drawing and carefully ripped out the page before wordlessly handing it to him.
“I’ll give it to you,” Tony says, hand sliding down Steve’s back, “I’ll give you exactly what you need.  I’ll—What the hell is this?"
Sam glances back at the sleeping couple.  It’s obvious that this development is new.  Like the other Avengers, Sam’s had to suffer through months of Steve and Tony dancing around each other.  But between Tony’s denial and Steve’s obliviousness, he’s surprised they got together so soon.
Tony weaved his way through the crowd, ignoring the looks he got from other party-goers for deserting the bride on the dancefloor.  He shot a quick text to Rhodey to wish him luck with the blonde Air Force colonel he was talking up at the bar before ducking out of the reception.
Steve smiled in response and chastely kissed him on the mouth before finishing up his task.  He discarded the towel on the floor before getting back in the bed and pulling the sheets over them.
Steve slid his hands down Tony’s sides until they finally settled on his hips.  He was a little disappointed that Tony was no longer enveloped in his arms, but he had to admit that the lounge chair they were on was a lot more comfortable without two fully grown men lying on it.  “I think I’ve just been insulted.”
“I’d never lie to you,” Steve says.  His lips quirk into a small smile before adding: “You’d never buy it anyway.”
Steve sighs, walking around the table so he can stand next to Tony. “Don’t you think I should dictate who I want in my life?” he asks. “Who I want to be with? You can’t just say things like that—say that you aren’t ‘good enough’ to be with me, because I’m not anything special, Tony.”
Officially, it’s Tony, who says it a few weeks after Steve does.  He’s sitting in Steve’s kitchen, working on his project and waiting for Steve to get back from a week long business trip.  It’s almost midnight when he finally hears the elevator doors slide open to the penthouse, and a jetlagged Steve drags his suitcase out into the living room.
Tony could feel “I pined after you for long enough.  I’d have to be an idiot to say no and—wait, what are you—”
Steve looks at Tony with curiosity, and unwinds his legs before getting to his feet.  He approaches Tony tentatively, like he’s a landmine fit to explode.  He rubs the back of his neck. “You, um, think my eyes are pretty?” he asks.
“Do you like this music?” The question throws Tony off guard, and in an uncharacteristic move, he stumbles and steps on
“It was fine,” Steve replied. “Tony, what—” He stopped in his tracks when he realized what was so different about the room. “Where did the mural go?”
They spend two blissful years together going on dates to the café or the movies, cooking dinners together in the poor excuse of a kitchen in their dorm, and fucking like rabbits.
Tony is terrified of Bucky.  Sure, the man’s cool and all, and Tony’s seen firsthand what the CFO can do in a boardroom and how he can charm the press just as easily, if not more-so, than Steve.  Bucky’s been by Steve’s side longer than Peggy, Natasha
“I—I want…” Steve breathed out, reeling for words.  He still couldn’t believe how easy it was for Tony to turn him into an incoherent mess. “Tony, I want—”
Tony knows Steve is going to be fine.  He knows that the man will wake up and heal, and probably go out and save the world again in a few months, but as silly as it may be, it’s still a relief to hear Natasha say it.
Steve touches their foreheads together.  “I do love you, y’know?  The last thing I want is for this to change anything between us.”
statement to make him feel so gutted—so horribly void inside—but it did.  He was well-aware of his relationship with Tony—or lack thereof these days—but to hear Tony say it so plainly did nothing to help his mood.
It wasn’t slow. It wasn’t romantic. Not this time. It couldn’t be. Steve’s hands dug into Tony’s thigh and hip, grounding Tony like an anchor as they began to rock together into Tony’s fist. The rain made their movements slicker, easier.
“You have no right to talk,” Steve retorts.  “You’d spend every waking moment with your armor if you could.”
Steve looked like the wind had been knocked out of him. “You’re sure?  I don’t want you to feel like—”
However, after that stunt, Steve had started seeing less sugary items hidden around the the tower, and they were practically nonexistent after he and Tony started dating. Yes, Tony still ate sweets like it was his job, but the fact he felt less compelled to hoard them put Steve a little more at ease.
you,” Steve says. “Tony, I’m so ridiculously, head-over-heels in love with you that I doubt anything will
Tony meets Natasha’s eyes again, and the look she’s giving him is so raw and open—so unlike her usual self that it leaves him feeling a little unsettled.  “Of course,” he replies. “We’re a team, aren’t we?”
He braced himself against the slippery tile and let the water sluice over his back as a million thoughts ran through his head.
Steve’s ministrations slowed before stopping entirely, the hand holding his toothbrush frozen in midair.
Then Steve winks, and Tony’s pretty sure he died in the elevator on the way up, because this is not reality, this cannot be reality.  There is no possible way that any of this is happening right now, he clearly must be dead.  It’s the only explanation.
“Us,” Steve replies.  His hand fumbles in his jacket pocket for a few moments before taking out a sleek gold band.  “If you’ll have me, that is.”
An old, but well-preserved, photo album turned up in Steve’s room a few days later.  It was tucked away in the bookcase by his desk, but Steve was certain that it hadn’t been there before.
He swallowed and watched the way Steve’s eyes tracked the movement of his throat. He was suddenly very aware of their proximity. His fingers stilled and then clenched into the muscle of Steve’s thigh. He licked his lips and his gaze went half-lidded.
He’s slow on the trip to the bathroom, limbs heavier than normal.  He has one hand against the wall to keep him steady as he relieves himself.  Then he washes his hands and stares at his own blushing face in the mirror.  He can’t tell if his eyes seem dilated or not.  He prods at his lips, and grins at the the way they tingle around the edges.  He really might be drunk!
It’s the morning after Tony and Steve’s six-month anniversary when Tony finds himself in the kitchen making brunch for him and Steve.  The celebrations the night before had been nothing short of
“You’re telling me,” Steve muttered. “I can barely flirt—let alone tell when anyone is flirting with
“Yeah.” Tony put his food down. “Wait, are you telling me you couldn’t tell she was flirting with you?”
Tony paused mid-step and looked up to find Steve casually leaning against the hood of the Bugatti and jabbing away at his phone. “
“No, but knowing Natasha and Pepper, they probably planned for every possible outcome of this scenario,” Steve replied.  He unzipped another pocket and found a bottle of lube as he predicted.
Steve crossed his arms. “I’m not agreeing to anything that would slow my movement on the field, y’know that.”
Sam puts his hands up in surrender. “Whatever.  I’ll give you a free pass this time because Steve’s still sitting in a hospital bed.”
“Tony,” Steve says, grinning from ear to ear.  That seems to get the King and Queen’s attention because they abruptly look away from the television and stand.  Steve approaches Tony and kisses his cheek.  “I want you to meet my mother and father.”
The gifts continue, until one afternoon where Pepper goes to Tony’s office to inform him that all of Tony’s evening plans were cancelled for a dinner reservation at Tony’s favorite restaurant: a little hole-in-the-wall trattoria in Little Italy.
Tony could feel a blush creep up his cheeks, even as he felt Steve's hand settle around his cock. “I love you, too,” he gasped.  He reached over and brushed a few stray strands of hair away from Steve’s eyes.  "I still can’t believe someone as wholesome and innocent as you could be so
“I love you,” Tony says when Steve appears in his lab with two cups of coffee and a box of baked goods. “Are these from—”
Rhodey doesn’t find out about Steve until he wakes up one Saturday morning and finds one of those celebrity gossip shows talking about “Steve Rogers’ new boytoy.”  And Rhodey is still a little drunk from the night before, so he thinks it’ll be a good laugh, but when he sees grainy photos of Steve Rogers and a boy who suspiciously looks like Tony walking out of a restaurant a couple blocks from campus, he’s left staring at the television in shock until Tony gets home half an hour later.
Tony fought a smile as he half-heartedly pushed him away, but not before Thor snapped another photo.
Tony started up the coffee machine and then sidled over to Steve.  He pulled out his phone and typed in a quick search before wordlessly handing it over to the other man.
“The frosting to cake ratio on a cupcake is so much more ideal,” Tony explains, licking chocolate off of his fingers. “Besides, eating a dozen of these makes you feel slightly less guilty than eating a whole cake.”
“I have fought against the Chitauri and faced an entire army of frost giants,” Thor said gravely. “I have looked Death in the eye more times than I could count, but never in my life have I ever encountered anything as terrible as this.”
“Steve!” Thor greeted jovially. “I’m glad to see you are doing well so soon after our unfortunate encounter with the Wrecking Crew.  I’m sure Tony will—”
Suddenly all eyes are on Steve, and the Avengers visible stiffen where they’re standing.  They’ve all obviously known that someone would eventually ask Steve for his personal opinion, but that doesn’t mean any of them are
“I guess after the initial shock of seeing the other guy painted on a canvas wears off, it looks rather… majestic,” Bruce added.
Steve felt his face heat when Thor held the photos out.  “They, um.  They are rather… cute?” he tried.
Steve urged him on his back, and before Tony could process what was going on, Steve swallowed him down with little effort.
“Or you just figured I wasn’t important?” Tony called after Steve, unable to keep the full scope of the rejection out of his voice.  Steve stopped in front of the door of the shed.
Tony ran out of the bedroom to find Steve, still in his Captain America uniform, surrounded by half a dozen cats and dogs of varying ages and sizes.
Steve was one of very few people who knew that the real Tony Stark was thoughtful and selfless, and genuinely
And the truth was that Tony did believe Steve, saw the reciprocation of it in the look of pure adoration on Steve’s face, and felt it in the gently caress of Steve’s fingers over his cheeks. Tony leaned forward and pressed their foreheads together.
“I love you, Steve,” Tony murmurs into his neck.  “I love you. I’m never letting you go again, I swear.  I love you, I love you.”  Tony can count the number of times he's ever uttered those three words on his hand, but with Steve, he can't stop saying them.  It's the closest he can get to letting Steve know just how important he really is.
,” Tony amended. “Hell, the only reason you can still tolerate me after all of these years is because you’re halfway across the world most of the time.”
The second time Tony sees Steve on a cover of a magazine is about a year after that, but this one is staged, and Steve is
“Dear, there is no need for such formality,” the Queen says, her voice sweet like honey. She places her hands on Tony’s shoulders and smiles at him. “Any friend of our son’s is a friend of ours.  You may call me ‘Sarah.’”
"Everything’s fine, Steve.  I swear.”  He slowly backs into the elevator. “I have to get to work, and I’ll get my secretary to set those tabloids straight, and—"
Steve shrugged.  “I think it’d be fun.  Thor’s wanted to see a live musical ever since Clint made us watch
When they finally arrived at their destination two hours later, Tony practically bolted from the car as they left it with the hotel valet.  His apparent attempt at escape was impeded by the manager, who was waiting to greet them in the lobby.
Shortly after arriving in the future, Tony happened—the man stormed into Steve’s life and managed to find a permanent place in Steve’s life, and Steve thought that maybe, just
“So uh, do you wanna grab lunch or something?” Tony asked abruptly. “Vanessa said there’s a great seafood place down the street.”
“I wouldn’t wish those experiences upon anyone,” Steve added, quieter than before. “I couldn’t live with myself if you had gotten hurt because of me.”
Steve woke up as the first rays of the sun started to peek over the horizon, red, orange, yellow rays of light dancing across the stillness of low-tide.
Tony had tagged along because it was a Friday night and he had nothing better to do, but Bucky had side-eyed him the entire time. At one point, Tony had heard him mutter something like: “What the hell are you doing with a
near these lilies.  You can start misting those houseplants over there.  It would take a lot more than you to kill them.”
“There’s gotta be oil or something in this hotel room we can use…” Tony heard Steve say.  There was some shuffling and the opening and closing of drawers, and when Steve re-emerged from the bathroom with a bottle of lubricant and a pack of condoms in hand, Tony could only gape—it suddenly made a lot more sense why the two women from housekeeping that Tony had run into that morning were giggling so uncontrollably.
since he and Pepper were romantically involved.  She had already moved on and found someone who made her happy, and Tony found a group of friends that made
Jan and Thor make a public announcement a few days after Tony’s death, but the reporters are absolutely
“Hi,” Steve greeted with a chuckle.  He knew he was grinning like an idiot, but he couldn’t find it in himself to care.
“Okay, Steve, I love you, but if you don’t calm the hell down, then I am going to make you,” she threatens. She flashes him a pleased smile when he sits next to her on the large bed.
questions.  They managed some small talk, but by the time the appetizers came around, Steve was having a more difficult time keeping the conversation going.  After some gentle coaching, they got the conversation back on track in time for their entrees.
One of Tony’s hands pulled the duvet over Steve’s body before coming up to card through Steve’s hair.  It was longer than Steve normally preferred, but Tony had made an offhand comment a few weeks ago about how much he liked it, so Steve had decided to skip his appointment that month.  Tony’s other hand was a warm weight against Steve’s shoulder; an anchor grounding him to the present, to the two of them—just him and Tony—in their bed.
the serum, big shot,” he said, clapping him on the back. “You’ve even got a winning personality to boot.  Anyone would’ve been lucky to have you then, and they’d be lucky to have you now.”
“Hm?” Tony was still too dazed from the kiss to think properly.  He opened his eyes—he didn’t even know when he had closed them in the first place—and saw that Steve was blushing.
Pepper gave him a disapproving look. “Aunt Doris and Uncle Bob are very nice.  A little eccentric maybe, but they’re nice people, and they give
.” Steve’s hands roam over his chest to his thighs, before settling on Tony’s ass, urging him to move.
“You can’t honestly tell me you thought this would last,” Tony said.  And what killed Steve was that Tony didn’t sound bitter or self-deprecating.  He just sounded tired, as if the subject wasn’t even
Tony frowns. “They’re still complaining?  I thought gave them enough money to shut them up for the next five years.”
“Incredible.” Tony leaned forward and kissed him.  He had barely pulled out when they were interrupted by an incessant knocking on their door.
“It isn’t very polite to force others into do something they don’t want to,” Steve retorts, and his ensuing glare is enough to make Ty release his grip on Tony’s hips.
“Then shouldn’t you be thanking me for being such a thoughtful and considerate date?” Ty backs him up against the kitchen counter and places his hands on Tony’s hips. “C’mon, baby.  It’ll be fun. I’ll show you a great time—”
And Rhodey’s known Tony for going on four years now, but he’s never seen the other man quite like this.  As if—
“You ask about potatoes when you’re trying to figure out what you’re doing for dinner,” Steve says, rolling his eyes. “Besides, we’ve been talking for the past ten minutes.”
“Didn’t really have much of a choice,” Steve found himself muttering under his breath before he could stop himself.  He cursed at his lack of tact. “I’m sorry, I—”
They eventually stumble into Tony’s bedroom, and if Tony’s inexperience hadn’t already made itself apparent, it sure as was obvious now.
Steve barely knew the art of romance seventy years ago, so he didn’t know why everyone seemed to think he’d know it
“I’m fine!” he shouted, feeling a twist in his side and an ache in his gut. He was fine. He was! So what if he wanted to cry? It wasn’t like he wasn’t allowed to, but he just didn’t want to do it in front of Steve.
because Steve is the best man that Tony has ever known, and he’s pretty sure the rest of the world has the same sentiments (except maybe HYDRA).
Tony looked up from his untouched glass of wine and into the eyes of his date. “I’m sorry.  I’m just a little bit—”
“I think I have a right to be,” Steve retorts, making Tony flinch. “I’m sorry, that… That came out wrong.  I didn’t mean to—”
The design on the mug was starting to fade now, and there was a small chip in the handle, but Tony always insisted on using it.
Steve huffed a response as he grabbed a mug from the cupboard and poured himself a cup of coffee.  He knew the caffeine wouldn’t really have an effect on him, but he still found comfort in the drink.  It was a reminder of Sunday mornings spent at the diner with Bucky after Mr. and Mrs. Barnes dragged them to Sunday mass.
Steve wasn’t sure if it was the moonlight playing tricks, but he was almost positive that Tony was blushing.  “How much I love you,” he said. “How incredibly lucky I am to have you.”
It was a harmless act, but at that moment, it felt more intimate than two people who were just friends had any right to be.
They click from the beginning: work together, fight alongside each other flawlessly, and finish each other’s sentences.  Steve knows how to comfort Tony after particularly difficult missions that end in terrible casualties; knows what to say when he seeks him out after his tech is stolen again; knows how to make him feel better about yet another rebuild.
from the activities earlier.  His body aches, but it’s a wonderful ache—a more than welcome reminder of the feeling of Steve inside of him, fucking into him like they had all the time in the world.
“That makes much more sense, then,” Tony mused. “That man can barely operate a cell phone.   He even had the
“Why would you possibly need it while sleeping, though?  It’s not like anyone could break into the tower; that’s what JARVIS is for.”
Tony squeezes his hand. “I know you do, Steve, but when there comes a time that I really do need you, I know you’ll be there, and that’s more than enough.”
Tony’s watched plenty of movies, so when he comes to, he’s expecting to find himself to be tied down to a chair in some abandoned warehouse in the middle of bumblefuck nowhere.
“If I was, you would have at least told me to my face that you didn’t want to do this anymore,” Tony spat. “That you… That you’d had enough of this... of
“Yes.  It was the night of my husband’s fiftieth birthday.  The festivities were just beginning, and there he is, looking guilty as ever with the largest lovebite on his neck that I have ever seen.  He likes to think he’s quite the sneak, but that boy cannot lie to save his life—”
Steve doesn’t know when he falls asleep, but he when he wakes, the workshop is dark.  Tony’s on top of him, their bodies a tangled mess of limbs, and Steve can feel Tony’s steady breathing against his collar bone.
“Remember a few months ago when the serum suddenly stopped working and you aged seventy years ?” Tony said, keeping his tone light. “Well, now you’re fifty.  I mean, I know it’s not thirty, but it’s better than nothing, right?”
“Well, JARVIS won’t be very helpful if an alien spaceship crashes through my bedroom and tries to abduct me,” Steve retaliates.  He looks up at the closest hidden camera above his head. “No offense, JARVIS.”
Tony looks over his shoulder—back at the largest smoking crater where he had been standing not an hour ago. “This isn’t how things were supposed to happen.”
“I’ve been away at boarding school since I was eight,” Tony informs.  He takes a seat in the middle of the king-sized bed.  “I went straight to college after that, and I couldn’t exactly slip in the fact that I like cock into a two minute phone conversation.”
restaurant going to be that… um, pricey?” Steve inquired. “I can’t even afford living on my own, much less taking someone to these fancy places every night.”
“…right,” Tony said.  Steve didn’t know why he didn’t sound the least bit convinced.  Tony had met a few of his past dates—hell, Tony had even met a few of them over breakfast the next morning.  What did he
Tony’s life?—he made the medics check him over three times, and after they assured Steve that Tony was perfectly fine, Steve still refused to leave his side and was touching every inch of Tony’s body that he could, as if making sure Tony was actually there.
hadn’t made it glaringly obvious that Tony didn’t want anything to do with him, then running into Tony and his beautiful date looking pretty cozy in the elevator less than an hour ago definitely did.  Steve had stammered an apology and opted for the stairs, ignoring Tony’s voice calling his name.
Steve frowned.  This wasn’t how he was expecting the morning to go at all.  Tony seemed distant —entirely detached from what was happening between them.
“I… I’m sorry, Ty.”  He really is, because Ty is charming and very handsome, and Tony is very much attracted to him, but: “I just… I don’t think I’m up for anything more tonight.”
Steve turned over to find Natasha sitting on the edge of his bed. “Things may not have gone as I had planned,” he admitted.
Steve immediately kissed back, but tried to keep  He pulled the other man closer so he was flush against him, their cocks rubbing against each other through the fabric of their clothes.
But ten minutes later when he gets up to take a trip to the head, everything wobbles and he grabs a hold of the back of Bruce’s chair to keep from tripping and falling onto his face.
Tony couldn’t pinpoint when exactly Steve had become a permanent fixture in Tony’s life, but he was just glad that it had happened at all.  Steve was always around, to the point where it became rare for Tony to go through a day without seeing or hearing from him.
Sam coughs and gets up from his seat.  “I uh… have to go… somewhere that isn’t here,” he says before ducking out of the room.
“This video doesn’t get my good side at all,” Tony heard Steve say, and he fought the urge to laugh.
“I can be the mother if you’re that insecure about your masculinity, Tony,” Steve teased, pulling the other man into his embrace and kissing his cheek.
Tony relaxed his body and welcomed the intrusion.  Steve’s slow, languid movements were excruciating, and Tony was debating the merits of whether or not to tell Steve to hurry up the pace when Steve’s finger brushed against his prostate.
“Alrighty then.” Tony stood from his seat and linked his arm through Steve’s. “Lead the way, Captain.”
Once Steve comes to a stop in front of him, Tony notices that the right sleeve of the uniform has a large tear, and his shoulder looks like it was grazed by a bullet—
Tony isn’t sure why Steve still gets like this: why Steve is always so surprised when Tony reminds him of how much he loves him, like he’s…
The first ten minutes go relatively smoothly, with the reporters asking general questions about what transpired on that terrible day: Was Mr. Stark in top fighting condition at the time?  Had the armor been malfunctioning at all during the battle? Etc. etc.
The elevator slows to a halt before the doors slide open, and Tony realizes that Pepper had taken them to the communal floor.  Thor’s delighted laughter rings out from the rec room, immediately followed by the sound of Steve shouting, “You son of a two-legged
room and inserted his cardkey, waiting with bated breath when he saw the red light turn green.  He steeled himself before turning the handle and stepping inside just as Steve was getting into bed, dressed in a t-shirt and sweatpants, his hair still damp from his shower.
“I noticed you caught the attention of quite a few young ladies,” Tony remarked. “Surprised you didn’t take up any of their offers for a dance, though.”
Tony’s in the middle of pouring some more pancake batter on the griddle when Bucky shows up out of fucking
After missions, Steve tells Tony exactly what he wants to do to him by tapping morse code onto the armor, which results in some very uncomfortable and painful debriefings (but mind-blowing
Steve remembered how careful Tony had been in the beginning of their relationship: always second-guessing what he said, and never pushing Steve into doing… well, anything.  Steve supposed it made sense: neither of them had a particularly good track record with dating, and the last thing either of them wanted to do was ruin their friendship.
“I know you now,” Tony said matter-of-factly, “and I’ve known you better than most for the past nine and a half years.  I know that I meant it then and I mean it now.  I always will.”
Neither of them said anything for the duration of the ride to their floor, or as they walked into Steve’s room and got into bed.
“Why don’t I give you two the grand tour?” Vanessa offered, leading them down the hall. “I do believe the ballroom will live up to your standards.  A wedding such as yours should have nothing but the best, and we have no doubt that we can provide that.”
"That would make you the creeper of the century then, wouldn’t it?" Tony says, licking frosting off of his fingers. He goes to finish off the rest of the cupcake but freezes when an idea strikes him. "What about my super hot and super dorky boyfriend covered in chocolate frosting?" he asks. "Is that an option?"
“Sure thing, fellas,” she said, her cheeks rosy red, no doubt from Tony’s comment. “I’ll be right back.”
Tony ponders for a moment before he grins, wickedly . “You could tell me that story that Sarah never got to finish.”
“Sure,” Tony responded, looking back down at his tablet.  He was playing around with some plans for some sort of vehicle: it looked too large to be another suit.
“Maybe.”  Steve glanced at Tony again, but immediately looked away when he realized Tony was staring at him intently. “You really don’t think this is a little over the top?” Steve asked, changing the topic.
Thor smiled in turn, but didn’t take a genius to notice the tightness in his features. “I’m glad to hear it.”  He turned to Amora and bowed his head. “I know you and I do not always see eye to eye, but I am most grateful for your services today.”
Pepper chose that moment to bring up the elephant in the room—there was no way Tony could escape with everyone watching them.  He didn’t know whether to be annoyed or impressed by her little trap.
“I can’t believe you’re deserting me just so you guys can figure out which shade of black would make her guns less noticeable,” Tony whines. “You promised me steak and potatoes.”
But that doesn’t stop him from trying.  He continues having sex.  A lot of sex, really, but contrary to popular belief, he
Bucky leans forward and rests his elbows on the counter.  “You’re a good person, Tony, and you’re good
Steve pretended not to notice the Polaroid sticking out of Tony’s wallet when they got their tickets.
Steve doesn’t even have a chance to respond before Tony smears the remains of the cupcake all over his face and body.
“When you put it like that,” Tony leans in, “I think I could spare a few hours of sleep after all…” Steve takes a step back just before their lips brush against eachother. “What’s wrong?  Isn’t this what you want?”
The disapproving look on Steve’s face is replaced with worry and concern. “You should’ve called me,” he says quietly, taking a seat next to him on the curb.
Thor blinked. “I was going to say ‘be ecstatic about your rapid recovery,’ but yes, he will probably do that too.”
“What do you think I deserve, then?” Tony inquires.  He isn’t sure where he gets this sudden bout of confidence, but his date’s gone to hell, so he figures he doesn’t have anything to lose.
“I figured as much,” Steve says, leaning forward and pressing their foreheads together. “I’m not good at this.”
, and what would that leave the other?  Pain?  Regret?  An endless string of what-if scenarios, forever unresolved because neither of them got over themselves for long enough to give it a
Steve shook his head. “I’m sorry, I have to—I can’t do this right now,” he said before walking out of the room.
, Tony!  What was I supposed to think?  I mean, sure you asked me to dinner, but more than half the time, you’d invite someone else too.”
“You’re right.  It really is a lot better when we don’t have to worry about waking up the others,” Steve joked when they parted, earning him a chuckle from the other man.  He blindly reached for the quilt on the ground and wiped off the mess on his hand and Tony’s stomach.  Steve laid back down once they were both decent, his chest pressed to Tony’s back.
“That’s good,” Steve said, grinning from ear to ear. “What happened anyway?  Last night I was… well, y’know, and this morning I woke up and looked like…” He gestured at his body.
“Are you sure you’re all right, Mr. Stark?” the limo driver asks as escorts Tony to the Presidential Suite of the hotel.  Tony thinks his name is Phil, but he isn’t positive.
“Is that an appropriate dress to be wearing to a ball?” Tony asks coolly.  He has the tendency to fidget when under pressure, so he busies himself by twirling the olives in his martini.
This guy smells like expensive cigars and cologne, and the coffee they’ve been drinking hasn’t done much to mask the taste of alcohol on his tongue.
They act perfectly normal in class, and in public settings in general, but every night, one of them texts the other asking him to come over, and they sleep together again.
“I didn’t mean—Tony, calm down. Jesus,” Steve hissed when Tony tried fighting him off.  He cast a wary glance towards the direction of the house. Tony yanked his arm away with a snarl that was lost to the rain, but he overcompensated, feet sliding in the wet grass. He flailed and landed on one knee, nearly clocking his head on the side of the shed. He batted Steve’s hand away when he tried to help.
, he felt a little… well, unsure.  After all, he had barely known the man at that point, so he wasn’t sure what kind of boundaries there were.
Steve shot off a quick reply and then pocketed his phone.  It was one thing being forced to spend time with the man, but seeing him feign concern was something Steve would have rather not had to deal with at all.
“Thank JARVIS.” Steve rests his hip against the counter.  “He’s the one who alerted me.  I just did what any decent person would do.”
Tony looks at the screen and sees a photo of Steve on a horse, wearing a… royal officer’s uniform? “Oh, my God.”
.  I know now that nothing could have prepared me for you—for loving you so much that everything else seems insignificant.  I can’t imagine my life without you in it, so Tony Stark, will you marry me?”
Tony sighed dejectedly.  “Steve, I’m not the healthiest person around, and I never really have been.  Considering everything I’ve put my body through over the years, it’s a wonder I’m alive and talking to you
“Shouldn’t we say something first?” Natasha suggested, swatting Clint’s hand. “It’s Thanksgiving, after all.”
Tony continued his ministrations, not easing up even as Steve’s body tensed upon orgasm.  Steve growled Tony’s name in the aftershocks, broken and needy.
“We were very excited to get your call,” she said. “It caused quite a buzz among the staff.  It’s not every day that we get such noteworthy clients, even here.”
“Oh, so is that the only reason why you’re living here?” Tony joked. “In that case, there will be a rent increase effective tomorrow.”
“It was child’s play,” she says, as if breaking into a highly guarded military base was a normal occurrence.
He gets his first job only three days later attending some charity function with a woman a good ten to fifteen years older than he is.  She’s in the middle of a very messy divorce with her husband who spends more time in the bottle than he does with their kids.
“You aren’t like any of the people Steve has ever dated,” Bucky says. “I was convinced for the longest time that you were after something–his money, fame, whatever.  Even after the others warmed up to you, I was still convinced that you weren’t good enough for him.”
“No, but it would… I don’t know…” Tony trails off. “I feel like it’s the next logical step in… our relationship?”
Tony remained still, keeping his gaze fixed on the television in front of him. “Whatever you’re trying to do isn’t going to work.”
Tony had only heard the dulcet tone of that voice a handful of times before, but he could recognize it anywhere.  He made to stand up, but Frigga held up her hand, willing him to remain where he was, and with the kind of grace only a queen like her could muster, she took a seat next to him on the bench.
Steve likes to ride Tony on the living room couch.  Likes to lift him up on the kitchen counter during breakfast and slide in without prep because Tony’s still wet and loose from having sex not two hours ago.  Steve steals him away from the guests at the galas they all get roped into going, locks them in the bathroom, and bends Tony over the sink.
Steve hasn’t minded though, even if it was a little ridiculous. After all, every one had a weird quirk or two.
At that moment, however, Steve could only focus on one particular detail in the photo: the dark, gold-embroidered robe haphazardly thrown around Howard’s shoulders.
His favorite sound, however, is Tony’s running dialogue as he works: the way he mutters numbers and equations under his breath, the excited tone in his voice when he figures out a solution, the occasional curse when something doesn’t go quite the way he planned.  Steve especially loves listening to Tony’s conversations with JARVIS and his bots—Steve loves how little the man has to say to get his point across to his companions.
Steve’s face paled and he staggered back like the floor had been ripped out from right underneath him. “You…”
Steve hadn’t realized he was staring again until Tony tentatively called out his name.  Tony approached slowly, stopping within arm’s reach.  Steve wasted no time in grabbing him and pulling him into his arms, burying his face into the crook of Tony’s neck.
When he comes to, Steve’s kissing his face and gently carding his fingers through his hair, whispering the phrase against Tony’s skin like a mantra.
“We live three blocks away from Times Square,” Steve said. “How have you managed to avoid this place for over a year?”
“I do know,” Steve said, with a small, but fond smile. “Believe me, I do. But I want one good thing to look forward to at the end of this mess.”
A few days after taking up residency at the tower, Steve had found a box of doughnuts in the cabinet beneath the sink. A week after that, he found candy wrappers in between the couch cushions, and half of a chocolate cake with his name on it (literally, on a post-it in obnoxious lettering) in the fridge. The blond was also surprised to find out that Tony liked his coffee light and sweet, and not black as he had originally thought.
“And you’re being awfully rude to the royal family’s guest,” another woman—a brunette in a stunning red silk gown—cuts in.  There’s an air of elegance around her that Tony is both intimidated and captivated by. “It’s nice to see you again, Marie.”
“The police better get here soon,” Clint said, “They won’t stay that way for long.  Where’s Spidey with his webs when you need him?”
“How else are you supposed to catch up on modern pop culture?” Tony asks. “Besides, this is better than letting you mope around in your apartment again.”
The workshop is where Steve finds Tony after their latest fights to reprimand him for his recklessness, before noticing the bruises on Tony’s body and kissing them better.
“Are you sure you don’t wanna run off with Beth or Jennifer or Scott or any of those other SHIELD agents that you’ve become so fond of?  I’m sure they’re all much younger and much more fit than I am.”
“Look, I… I’ve been there.  More or less.  I told you before that, if I had the chance, I probably would’ve married Rumiko, but then she died and… I obviously don’t know how that would have turned out, but I don’t want you to have to go through that.  I can’t promise you a forever, because it
talk?” Tony asked, and the look on his face almost made Steve want to oblige, but Steve knew they couldn’t put this off.
“Yeah, well it would help if he actually learned how to clean up messes instead of making them bigger.”  Tony picked up Steve’s sketchbook and looked through the pages of sketches of the Natasha, Clint, Thor, Bruce, Sam, and even Tony, Dummy, and Butterfingers. “You’re a real good artist, Steve.  Dummy actually looks somewhat intelligent in this one.”
Steve fidgeted in his seat. “Not… exactly?  We went out again the other night but… he kind of bailed.”
The stars are a brilliant white light amidst the darkness of the sky, and Tony would never want to do anything to put out that light.
“Or if you’re too tired, we can stick to plain old vanilla sex in our bed like other boring old couples—”
“Enjoy your night!" Thor calls out after the retreating couple. "May it be pleasurable, and the orgasms plentiful!”
Tony blinked, caught off guard by Steve’s flippant response as he walked away. The sky darkened almost immediately, as if Steve was taking all of the light with him.
"Shut up,” Tony says, but doesn’t deny it.  Steve thinks it’s okay because the red blooming across Tony’s face speaks for itself.
“I’m gonna fuck up,” he answers. “Again.  Steve’s going to need me, and I won’t be there because I’m gonna fuck it up again like I did with Pepper.”
.  He doesn’t feel weak.  He doesn’t feel like he’s giving a part of himself up, like it’s some sort of payment or something he just
Tony stepped out of the en suite and found Steve sprawled on the king-sized bed in a matching hotel bathrobe robe.  “If I get pneumonia, I’m blaming you.”
Clint leaned over to look at the mostly developed photos in Thor‘s hand. “They really are,” he agreed.
“Okay, this is amazing.  You’re amazing.  I’m never going to assume anything about you ever again,” Tony gasped. “Another?  I can take another.”
“Tony!” Steve bellows.  He’s in the navy blue uniform that Tony absolutely loves, but his hair’s a mess, and there’s a giant bruise on his right cheek.
live up to his promise to Steve and came to him whenever he needed to talk, and eventually, Steve found himself doing the same thing.
“You always use that excuse,” Tony said, turning his back.  He brought up a few holograms wrote a few bullshit equations just to keep his hands busy.

, Steve wanted to say, but he bit his tongue.  Howard hadn’t been a bad person when Steve knew him—a bit of an ass sometimes, but then again, who wasn’t?  But learning about this entirely different side of Howard and the kind of person he had become to neglect his own child—to neglect someone as wonderful as

for as long as you’ll have me,” Steve replied. “I don’t… I’m not always good with words, you know that.”
he tells himself, but his eyes are apparently magnetically attracted to it, because he glances down and his brain has processed the five words before he can stop it.
Tony sighed. “It’s still too much,” he said dejectedly. “I knew it.  I’ll find something, I swear—” Steve reached out and grabbed his arm. “Steve, what are you—”
“Look,” Tony said, resigned. “I thought I could make it work with Pepper, but that just blew up in our faces.”
It was strange thinking about the development of his relationship with Tony, especially when one considered the fact that they could barely stand being in the same room when they had first met. But now, they were friends who had movie nights and went out to dinner together and
He actually finds it pretty hilarious, except on nights like tonight where he finds himself being kissed by yet another young model or singer or rising businessman.
Clint is amazed that Steve hasn’t already noticed his presence in the entryway; after all, it isn’t very easy to distract a man with heightened senses.
Steve, of course, simply replied with: “I like him. He likes me. He’s fun, and we want to see where this goes.”
“You’ll find someone,” Steve says with a sad smile, “Someone who’ll give you everything you want and treat you the way you should be treated.  Someone—”
“I love being with you, and I want to be with you forever, so…” Steve drawled, “do you want to get married?”
Afterwards, Thor brought it upon himself to buy everyone a t-shirt, and spent the entire walk home singing the entire soundtrack (and if anyone noticed Natasha quietly harmonizing every now and then, no one brought it up).
Tony shook his head.  She made it sound so easy—as if Tony wasn’t putting his friendship with Steve on the line. “I can’t do that, Pep.”
"Can you go with me to the restaurant just in case?  I could give you a signal if things are going well, and we could come up with another signal if you need to call the police, or—"
“I’m afraid I must decline,” Thor said apologetically. “I have already promised Jane that I would spend the day with her.”
Tony got into the nearest elevator and dug around his pocket for the cardkey that Natasha had slipped to him earlier that night.  Glancing at the room number, he pressed the button for the appropriate floor and waited as the doors slid closed before finally beginning the ascent to his floor.
Tony turns around and finds himself face to face with a made-up blonde in a dress so tight that it could only be described as a second skin.
Steve’s cock was a heavy and welcome weight on Tony’s tongue—the feel of it in his mouth, the knowledge that this was
Tony had a point.  In fact, the more they talked about it, the more Steve was in favor of the entire arrangement.  Steve had tried following the advice from everyone else, but what they offered wasn’t advice so much as it was feeding him to the sharks.
Steve doesn’t bother dignifying Tony with a response, instead continuing to lead Tony past the sand dunes, towards the sound of the crashing waves, until they get to…
Tony straddles the other man’s lap and licks a stripe of frosting off of his cheek. “And you are absolutely delicious.”
Tony was a little bitter about the fact that he couldn’t even get a couple minutes to revel in Steve’s excitement, but he supposed thirty seconds was better than nothing.
Steve continues sending Tony gifts throughout the week: his favorite chocolates, a mixtape of his favorite music, and even a giant teddybear.  Tony tries his best to hide it, but Steve can tell that he’s elated with all of the attention.
a good organization (he had JARVIS research it for him), but the team would have preferred to visit the sick children themselves.  None of them had any real business being there, except Tony of course, but Steve knew that he was always just as enthused as the rest of the team about going to any public functions.
“By the time I’m through with you, you won’t be able to string any words together to form a coherent sentence,” Steve said with a smirk.
Steve fixed Tony’s coffee the way he liked it—a splash of milk and two sugars—and poured a cup for himself before sitting next to Tony at the counter.  They both piled their plates with pancakes and bacon and eggs and immediately began to dig in.
"His lawyer, accountant and physician all signed off on it. Tony obviously thought it was the right thing to do, Steve. Things like this… they aren’t last minute decisions. It’s clear that he had been thinking about it for a while, so shouldn’t we respect his decision?” the redhead asks. “Besides, like I said, you guys are married. It would’ve happened anyway.”
Steve, and the rest of the Avengers, shift their gaze from the television to Tony.  His clothes are wrinkled, hair unkempt, and eyes bloodshot—it’s obvious he hadn’t left his workshop since they returned from their mission yesterday morning. “What makes you say that?”
“He wasn’t that bad…” Clint said, earning him a punch in the arm from Natasha. “What?  He’s alive, isn’t?”
“She’s just bitter that Steve never had an interest in her.”  Margaret flashes him a smile so beautiful that it makes Tony question his sexual orientation (again). “I’m Lady Margaret, but you can call me ‘Peggy.’”
Both of them look up and see a very tense Steve standing at the other side of the kitchen.  Ty immediately backs off, but his hands don’t leave Tony’s body.
“I’m never going to be able to finish making breakfast if you d-don’t stop doing that,” Tony says, his breath hitching as Steve leaves a mark on his shoulder blade.
“You know, I didn’t think it’d be cute for a military man to lose to a bunch of soccer moms,” Natasha quipped, watching Sam flirt with the group of women almost twice his age. “I was wrong.  It’s adorable.”
Steve was an idiot for thinking he ever had a chance.  He was just going to have to live with the fact that Tony didn’t feel the same way because nothing was worth losing Tony’s friendship. “Wow, is it nine already?” Tony remarked, glancing at the clock. “I’ve got a meeting in an hour.” “You should probably get ready,” Steve suggested.
The woman had gotten so upset with Tony’s inability to spare time for her that she had stolen his car and crashed it into a tree.
over breakfast with Natasha.  He even found himself going to bars with people like Maria Hill and Sam Wilson.
It doesn’t take long for the drawer in Steve’s bedside table to fill up with these various pieces of paper, and when Tony goes away on business trips, Steve spends his nights re-reading each one.
“I’m asking legitimate questions,” Tony pressed on. “Besides, we’re the only ones here.  All I’m saying is if I’m going to be helping you, I need to know all I can.”
A flicker of something unidentifiable flashed in Tony’s eyes, but it disappeared before Steve could try to decipher it.  “It’s a robe,” he said, getting up for some more coffee. “There are hundreds of thousands of styles out there. You probably saw it in a store window or something.”
“Are we at least going to have some steak?” Tony asks.  “Or chicken, or… I dunno, some sort of protein?  This isn't another one of those 'Seventeen Ways to Eat Potatoes' things, is it? Did you read another one of those Buzzfeed articles again?”
Tony had gotten so used to the quiet and easily flustered Steve he had been “dating” that he only ever assumed he’d be the same way in the bedroom.
.” Tony watched with wide eyes as Steve maneuvered himself between Tony’s legs, his hard length unashamedly pressing against Tony’s inner thigh through the thin cloth of his pajama pants. “I suppose you could
you do.” Clint rolled his eyes. “You and your ancestors have been the subject of thousands of years’ worth of art.”
“Well, it isn’t,” Steve said, standing up and encroaching on Tony’s space. “What I want is to date you.”
All Steve wanted was to have Tony at his side, helping him fend off the high-society ladies that almost seemed to gravitate towards him, and reassuring him that the night was almost over.  He wanted to hear Tony’s incessant chatter, needed it to calm his nerves whenever he was paraded around like this.  Unfortunately, some big-shot engineer or another had practically dragged Tony away the second the team stepped into the room.
Steve looked over and realized that Tony had come over to stand next to him.  He glanced back at the photo, trying to formulate a response.
“Two sugars, right?” Steve finishes for him, and Tony can only nod as he seats himself at the table.
“How do you feel?” Steve asked instead.  He had done his best to make sure Tony hadn’t experienced any discomfort, and Tony looked like he had been enjoying himself, but Steve couldn’t help but dwell on the minor detail that it had been a while since Tony was intimate with
“I… don’t think a drunken weekend getaway in Palm Springs counts as a relationship,” Tony remarked.   “Did I date anyone for longer than… I dunno, a month?”
However, after that stunt, Steve had started seeing less sugary items hidden around the the tower, and they were practically nonexistent after he and Tony started dating. Yes, Tony still ate sweets like it was his job, but the fact he felt less compelled to hoard them put Steve a little more at ease.
making it unnecessarily complicated,” Steve says, growing more and more impatient by the minute. “You just—you
Tony didn’t think it was possible for puppies to snicker, but he was almost positive that that’s exactly what the dog was doing.
,” Tony responds, as if that makes all the difference.  He breaks off the bottom of the cupcake and places it on top of the frosting, like a sandwich, and then proceeds to eat half of the concoction in one bite.
“Not quite,” the blond replied, words rumbling teasingly against Tony’s body. Steve started stroking him, firm and steady pulls of his hand that had Tony arching to follow the thrust of his fist. Steve’s mouth left a trail of open-mouthed kisses along Tony’s hip bone, before sweeping his tongue along the shaft.
