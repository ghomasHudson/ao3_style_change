Barely ten minutes later, muttering something about
He steeled his heart. He pulled back. He started pulling his pants up from around his knees. One thing at a time. Thankfully it was dark. The dark made it possible. His hands were shaking as he fumbled with the button and he was aware of Steve straightening, turning around.
Tony: Yeah, but I felt obliged to comment.
"Hey you. Enjoying the bash?"
"What,
"Tony?" Finally, Steve is saying his name.
The awkwardness was like a blazing physical pain. And while there was this one part of Tony that couldn't help but think that Steve simply didn't want to talk to him, another part of him had to notice, had to see how intensely Steve was looking at him, how his voice was a little strangled, how he seemed to be floundering for words too.
Steve's face felt stiff and frozen, like a piece of solid ice. "Excuse me," he said curtly and fled back into the corridor. Was Stark doing this on purpose?
Tony: Huh.
Sometimes, Tony even replied.
onto the slider. And then sliding it up,
He thought for a moment, then nodded.
Tony: Whatever happens, you and I at least will be okay.
Despite the quippy tone, his eyes looked serious when he knelt on the rug by the dog's side and started crooning to it, murmuring nonsense. Quickly, he checked it for obvious injuries. The animal raised it's head weakly, then decided to push it's nose into Steve's thigh. The tail did a pitty-pat from side to side, just once, then went still again. Altogether,  the dog's chances didn't look so bad, everything considered. Tony wasn't sure how else to check if an animal is well-oriented in space and time.
Eventually, words are failing him, but his legs still work, so he takes a step forward. A gust of wind tears the umbrella from his hand, but Tony barely notices. Steve's lips are wet with rain. At first they are hard and unrelenting, but then, suddenly, something gives. Last night Steve was all smiles under Tony's lips, before things went to shit. This kiss is different. It's a seal of trust. At first it's solid, and then desperate, and then, slowly, Tony turns it gentle, and finally, finally, Steve melts against him, and Tony holds his face in his hands and it's unbearable to ever let go.
being an Avenger, a hero. But this is all I can do. I can't let shit happen, I can let people die, and stay idle. I
me. So. How did you get here?"
, Tony.
Steve barked a laugh, just once. But in his eyes, something sparked; Tony could have sworn he saw the flecks of green flash inside the blue. And in one single stroke he pounded the rest of the way in. Tony sucked in air through his teeth. The stroke hadn’t been hard, nor angry, but it was forceful.
, something meaningful, but he had no idea how to put it to words and what came out was one big fat nothing.
"Well," Steve said matter-of-factly, "I don't think it's going to stay that way for much longer." Whatever had happened between them in the past, Tony thought he could hug him at that moment, just for the sheer, stupid sass.
"Why is my head so
The medic was back in her full, glaring glory. She rounded on the techs. "Who are you, people? Have you been looked over? Yes? Good, then, I'm sure you can find something useful to do
Steve pierced him with his eyes. "I think you're telling
bigger audience. Steve didn't
burned pleasantly hot in Steve's belly, and he now extended the whole length of his legs under the table, touching Tony's shoe with his own, and Tony promptly hooked an ankle over Steve's. This was even more liberty then they usually took with touching each other. It was not a time for subtlety. And Steve thought
"I suppose I tricked myself into getting to this point, so that I'd have to tell you. I won't back off now." He tried on a smile. It didn't quite work, so he went on. "So, when I said Steve and I were just sort of friends with benefits, occasionally?"
Stark didn't flinch or pretend to notice Steve suddenly. He just deigned to look in his direction a few seconds later. For a moment, under the lashes, his eyes glinted at Steve. One eyebrow cocked up, although Stark still never moved his head to look at Steve properly.
She was right. The legs were indeed very fine. Not that Tony had had any doubts.
During winter holidays, snow is generally a desirable, festive thing; white Christmas and all that. Tony wasn't a big fan, hadn't been ever since his joints started creaking, but Morgan was going to love it. Tony took out the sled and dusted it. Since it was still early in the morning, he went into his shed to work on a project, to kill time; when he emerged – or tried to emerge – a few hours later, he had to kick the door three times before it opened. Everything was blindingly
Steve lingered there. He seemed to be weighing something in his head for a minute, then evidently came to a decision.
"I'd feel better if you had it," he says; it's such a clear attempt at manipulation. It's also piss-poor and perfectly harmless. I know him. I know he just wants me to have the shield and he tries to spin it as if I'd practically be doing him a favor if I took it off his hands. Hell, it might even be true. But there's something else behind it. Something's worrying at him.
Steve turned to see who was speaking to him and almost jumped when he spotted Peter Quill, standing there, looking all friendly and
"Nonsense," Tony said. "You're talented. You just didn't have much time to dedicate to it. Have you been drawing at all since, eh...?" He faltered, because ignoring the elephant in the room had proven a pretty good strategy, and he didn't want to talk about it, he just didn't. Even mentioning the elephant indirectly seemed too much.
Tony: Me, when I sense it coming, there's a part of me that's... okay, broken in a landslide, to borrow your metaphor. And then there's another part of me that just rolls its eyes and goes like 'oh, this again'. And I just kind of stand aside and know what's happening and watch. And it hurts, but at least I'm used to it. I've been there before.
The last time Tony saw Steve – alive, thankfully – was back when the sheriff sent him to wake up Bruce in case any of Fisk's asshole associates ended up needing medical help. After Steve was done with them. Yep. That was Steve for you. A bit later, as Tony tinkered with the intricate yet unweildy device in his workshop, he realized one thing – although, coming to think of it, he surely knew it all along: Steve wasn't going to leave Timely. No matter what Tony did, no mater what they were or weren't to each other (and despite the fact Tony sometimes thought he saw something more there – they weren't anything really; Tony wasn't even sure they were friends), no matter all that, Steve wasn't going to be convinced to leave.
It was like poker, really; when someone raised the stakes, you either followed or you left your money and went home. And Steve had been raising and raising the stakes since yesterday, somehow, and
Tony: So, the dark part of the news cycle begins, we can relax for a few hours at least. I mean, no rest for the wicked, there's still some work to do, but at least we're off the crazy pace for now.
, she'd say.
Tony: Your secret missions aren't helping at all?
Tony: Okay, buddy, okay okay.
Tony: I said I just wanted him to be safe and to have some time to recuperate without worrying about all this, which, well, you can imagine how well that went down.
"Friday. When did Captain Rogers leave?"
Tony: Yeah, this may be totally unfounded, but I've a feeling we can work it out if we actually try.
Tony buried his face back into Steve’s chest and groaned. “Oh god, I said that aloud, didn’t I?”
Tony: Yeah, let's all meet and try to talk it out, like Natasha said.
Romanoff blinked at him slowly. "Steve's got his own space."
Bewildered, Steve stepped back, quickly letting go, his palms flying up in a placating gesture. He felt his face go cold and an icicle of horror stabbed at his chest. It was all distant, and he heard the echo of his own words to Sam earlier:
It was the same way with that breakup conversation. Tony hadn't been able to talk to people about what happened with him and Pepper, and then he was spilling his thoughts to this Steve. Not his guts, but his
some time." It seems to him he's loved Steve since forever, in one capacity or another,  in one way or another, reluctantly, bitterly, uselessly, as a friend, an adversary, a polar opposite, someone who let him down and whom he let down in turn. But not like this, not romantically, not hopefully, not with a view of the future. It's never been like this before, with Steve, he's never felt quite like this. It's as if he had to have all the other boxes checked first, with him, to be able to have this, in the end.
Tony picks the smallest, gentlest flogger available, buried deep in the back of one cupboard.
Then his eyes suddenly fixed on the intruder, mostly because Steve was looking at him intently. The guy's stance was a call for attention. It took Tony a second to notice that the stuff on his head wasn't winter gear – well, technically, it
The waitress had to show up then, with the damned food, and there were comments about
He didn't need to say it, though. Tony knew. He'd seen Steve come through the gate, with a stupid duffel bag slung over his shoulder, saw the way Steve looked around the Compound grounds with naked longing on his face. Heard it in his voice too, when Steve saw his old office, exactly the same as the day he left, the artwork and everything. At first, keeping it the way it had been was Tony's way of torturing himself, and then it was a conscious decision to preserve memories. And now, seeing the longing in Steve's eyes, he was glad he did, and decided he was going to fix everything again, make everything work or he'd be damned. Steve would have everything he loved back.
Tony: no
"Wanna trade?"
Tony leans over, and again he says: "
"The tiny war?" Steve said, his mind shutting down for a moment.
Tony: I've been thinking about this.
"We won the war," I said. I could still hear tears in my own voice, but I don't think anyone else could. "We lost..."
Steve studied his face furtively as Tony talked about how Steve could take the small bedroom to the left. He looked tired, and it wasn't just the sickness. That tiredness seemed to be chronically etched into Tony's features; the fact hurt Steve almost physically. He felt it resonate in his own muscles. God, Steve had
Tony: But can you really hold on like this?
"You've passed the physical," Steve began, swallowed.
while you wait to see if someone you knew had killed themselves with their own stupidity. Louis had seemed vague, confused, but now his eyes seemed to focus on Tony, which was, Tony supposed, good.
Still, it appeared Steve wasn't exactly listening. It seemed to Tony he was intently staring down the corridor, but that was impossible, wasn't it? Did he hear someone coming?
"Cap? You okay?"
Steve cleared his throat. "You, er, Stark. The left hand corridor." That was the one that lead to the landing bay and the storage area and the side engines.
Steve took a breath. "Um... remember how I asked you to keep an eye on Stark?"
, was what Tony heard instead, and yes, he damn well
," I indicated the drawing, "was hot."
Tony: THAT!
BACHMAN: I apologize.
This was when a beefy hand descended upon Tony's shoulder like an anvil falling from the sky. It's a miracle, how quiet big people could be, or at least big people who were also Norse gods and had various uncanny powers.
"You kept them," Steve managed, tearing his gaze away from Tony and looking around the office, at the drawings that still lined the walls.
, Steve wonders, and a part of him thinks this was just one big, cruel joke at his expense, but Tony wouldn't do that. (Would he?) And the other part of Steve looks the armor up and down, how slick it is, and impersonal and imposing, and he wants.
"I always miss you, Tony," Steve says, and there, see, that's how it's done; it's possible to put that into words. Steve's tongue certainly didn't fall off.
I was cradling my mug to my chest, apparently. I only became aware of it because of the way he was looking at me, and it. It was one of our old mugs, from the set that we had back in the Tower. They were made of cheap white ceramics, with our symbols on them – a set of six mugs, sent to us by a fan. They were kind of tacky, and we all loved them.
?" He put his arms around me, then. Abruptly, from behind. It startled me; his warmth startled me. I wasn't used to being hugged. Nat was the last person that had given me a hug, and the fact that I knew exactly when and where it had happened just proved my point. So I just stood there like a log, feeling the warmth of his stomach and chest against my back, and thinking how I was going to fall apart any second now.
Light-bulbs were erratically strewn along the ceiling. Mostly they were burned out. Still, enough of them gave out weak, yellowish light. Tony was suddenly overtaken by the feeling that he'd never appreciated anything in his life as much as he appreciated those light-bulbs right at that moment.
"Okay, great." Tony rubbed his hands together. "You go lie down for a bit, you still need your rest. I'll get to it. It will be ready in no time – well, not exactly, but we can have a late supper, in any case. You just go on."
started off on the wrong foot, true, but maybe things would get better now, Tony thought.
Tony delegated him some veggies that needed cutting up. The planned menu, to Steve, seemed weird and endearing and he had to admit he never expected they'd be making mac and cheese soup and meatball pops with dip and tiny tacos and pizza muffins and dozen other kid-friendly dishes that, to him sounded like breakfast food. Everything was as healthy as possible under the circumstances; everything was also made from scratch, apparently by Tony. Steve found the idea absolutely adorable, which he wouldn't quite dare tell Tony; still when he
He might have whimpered, reaching after him.
"Liar," Tony said, then flinched. Possibly it made both of them think of the last time Tony called him that. Tony certainly looked to be in distress over it. "Oh, for fuck's sake," he swore, not quite under his breath. "I didn't mean it like
but the thought wasn’t so coherent even in his own head, and he certainly had no words that matched the feeling.
Tony: Hardly anything else they could do.
you. It's... it's been too long. "
And it hurt. It hurt that he doubted me. It hurt that he thought I would actually leave him. I know he had his reasons, and, having our history in mind, maybe I deserved what I was getting, but I somehow felt it wasn't fair. I'd cheated time and tricked death so that I could spend more time with him.
Tony just shrugs. "Oh please. Everyone always complains about seats. You know what would have been actually conspicuous?
Despite the distortion over the speakers, Nick Fury's voice was unmistakable, as it boomed over their heads, over the houses and fields, over horses and pigs and people alike; and then, as everyone around him started dropping to the ground, arms raised high in the air (because people can't follow simple instructions), hands protectively covering eyes and, in only a few cases, hands behind heads, Tony watched naked fear conquer the faces around him. He found himself on his feet, however, whooping and dancing, dancing and whooping in the dirt, because
He lay very still, though; listening. No, there was no mistake. On the other side of the left hand wall, across the room, someone was moving about. Running through his options quickly, Tony decided he’d gain nothing by keeping still and pretending he wasn't there. If these were his captors, they were aware of him. If it was someone else – another captive – maybe they knew something: the time, the date, the reasons for all this; maybe they knew if the world still turned, out there.
"Just a sec, sweetie," Carol said, giving him a regretful look. She looked bored out of her mind.
movements! I breathe in, breathe out. The prospect of seeing his face again is suddenly scary. I'm not afraid of his reaction; I'm afraid of my own. I'm supposed to go look at his features and treat him as an almost-stranger? How do I explain to my heart this isn't the man I spent 40 years married to? Well – is and isn't. My whole body longs for him, every cell craves his nearness.
was the one who was supposed to be hearing this, only it was too late. But, thinking back, I hadn't been good to this new Tony either. In my attempts not to use him as a handy replacement for my dead friend, I'd been keeping my distance, not saying anything much. He was doing quite the opposite. I remembered how he said he'd cuddle with me, that he could go cry in a corner. How open he'd been about his feelings about the kid he didn't really have. He'd included me as if that was the most natural thing in the world. He'd been wearing his heart on his sleeve in some kind of flag-waving emotional defiance. He stubbornly refused to view me as a stranger.
Tony: But perhaps we could somehow remedy that, with time. If we are not too stupid.
"Okay," Tony said, calming down a little, "okay."
Tony: No effect whatsoever?
All I've taken with me are the clothes I have on and my wallet, thick with photos. Phones are great, but I still like to have photos I can hold in my hand.
"You inhaled smoke. Didn't you?" Tony made an effort to make his voice more normal, for the, it seemed, umpteenth time during this conversation.
Tony shook his head.
After a moment, Steve seemed to get it. He sighed. Said, "No, actually... I approved them. I think."
Fury nodded towards the door and Steve rose to go.
Tony: The reverse Midas.
Tony's face is resting in his wet palm and he's leaning on the bridge railing. Pressing his thumb and forefinger against his eyelids, he breathes. And breathes.
Tony: Discovered a morbid streak, have you.
Tony was, he told himself, just trying to make sure he was not imagining the whole thing, so he decided to continue with the experiments.
"Yeah," Steve said thoughtfully. "That's pretty much the impression I got. Will you keep an eye on him for me?"
"Just my... good friend," he replied with just a minuscule amount of irritation, but whether at the caller or at Steve – Steve didn't know. There was so obviously a story behind it that Steve didn't know what to say. He rubbed his hands that were – dammit – still kind of freezing. He stuffed them between his thighs to warm them up.
Tony: It's 2 am.
Stakes were being upped. The war was heating up.
It was difficult not to smile at Peter Quill, even when you really, really wanted to sink into melancholy and stay there. Tony allowed one corner of his mouth to go up and gave Peter an amused look.
. Hope bucked and went wild in seconds.
"I always wanted to be a teacher's pet." Stark grinned. Steve thought it best to ignore this as he explained a bit about what the lesson should cover.
"He's alive. I'm going back in." He was chatting to Tony, idly and unnecessarily. He knew he should stop, but where was the harm, really? Tony was waiting for Hope to arrive with the parts, anyway, and...
He was standing in the middle of the kitchen floor like a lonely island, just newly emerged from the sea. The instant I saw him, I wanted to go to him, ask him if he was all right, if he'd slept at all. But: "Steve, I'm sorry."
Tony: You never helped with this before either way, so relax.
is it?"
"Why..." Tony started.
"Do you need a place to stay? No, scratch that, I know you do. No, Steve, shut up, you don't get a say."
seem reluctant to go, if Tony read him right at all. Inside the diner, there were still some remnants of the miracle energy, perhaps. The moment they stepped out, they would be back to perfect strangers. They would have to be. What other option was there? Maybe Steve felt it too.
," he heard Steve say, insistent, pressing.
Tony thought.
Tony: Look, you don't know until you try. I never said they didn't work. I said I wasn't happy with the side effects.
Tony: Or, more precisely, didn't do.
And then a powerful smash and an explosion of wreckage, and if no one came running at this, they were either dead, drunk or having wild sex on one of the upper floors.
Tony: Yeah, this is exactly what I need now.
"I'm still here," Steve gasped as he got back to his feet. He checked the fire extinguisher, then noticed a red light blinking on the primitive control panel of the helmet. He swore. "An explosion, chemical fire," he informed Tony briskly as he waded back in. Maybe it was helping Tony stay focused, he told himself. "Going to put it out now."
Steve knew his chuckle sounded harsher than he intended. "Yeah. Completely sure."
“Hm?”
Apparently, this was some kind of a coat room, probably for the guests, since it was on the ballroom floor. Silent racks of overcoats and raincoats and jackets, almost identical in the gloom, like rows upon rows of mute auditors.
Tony to accept.
Those were her exact words, and then she refused to say anything more on the subject. I finally managed to get Tony to slow down enough to hear me out, but that was only a bit later, after he'd got tired of grilling me for answers. By that point we were aimlessly walking up and down Bleecker Street. I repeated her words. The Sanctum Sanctorum was shut tight, anyway, at least for us, and no one was answering Tony's phone calls. Stephen Strange's photo hung uselessly on the screen of Tony's phone, as it rang and rang. "I hate the asshole," Tony said without much steam left. He was done with frustrated yelling, and now he just looked tired.
Tony turned and shook his head at him, not so much in a '
Tony: After all of this dies down a tad, will you send me your blood and urine samples to tinker with?
was about.)
"Why are you here, then?" he repeated very softly. "What do you want?"
Tony: Steve, there is no such things as the Avengers right now.
to, do you...?" Tony began, and he heard his own voice, and it was too low, too angry. His control was slipping. Steve was never as beautiful as in that moment, and Tony wanted to kiss him in the roughest possible manner, to have him down on his knees, to make him
"What, you mean you haven't been monitoring my gym scores? Why the hell am I recording them, then?" Okay, well, those filters never worked the way they were supposed to anyway. They should be replaced. Or his brain should. That would probably solve all his problems.
Then they both leaned forward and, smoothly like an orchestrated scene, their lips greeted each other again in a languid kiss. Once, twice, then three times more. Their limbs—everything moved slowly like molasses. Steve closed his eyes, but Tony couldn't help but look. Not a second of this should go unobserved.
him too much to pressure him. No, not even now that they had no time left.
Tony: Also, there was nothing she could tell them even had she wanted to, which she didn't, obviously. She wouldn't have, even if we hadn't smoothed things over recently.
Still.
that was rapidly heating up between them. Well, if Tony turned on the charm, he was pretty sure he could get Steve into bed, but he wasn't so certain he could actually
And now it was apparent everything Steve thought – believed, hoped – Tony maybe wanted – well, it had all gone to shit. He'd been wrong. He let his hopes get the better of him. He let himself expect the unobtainable, somehow, for some reason, and he screwed up. Now all he needed to do was rewind, go back, go back to that place where he didn't expect anything, didn't hope for anything at all, and he could go on living like before, right, if only...
"You awake?" For some reason, Steve was whispering.
"It seemed like you needed to get that out of your system," Steve said.
Tony: Did they get a pair of phones all their own?
was being ridiculous.
he thought,
after they almost stumbled over a broken chair that had jumped into their path out of nowhere.
Steve shrugged. "Yeah. He doesn't
Contrary to his expectations, he had managed to sneak out of the bed without waking Steve up, so he lit the fire in the living room, and scooped up some snow from the windowsill and melted it for coffee.
"No, no," Tony interrupted him quickly. Bluntly. "I have to go. Sorry." Then, as an afterthought. "Your majesty."
, if just the once. He'd know what Steve felt like under his hands, warm skin against skin, Steve's lips pressed against his...
, torturously.
Tony: So you thought you'd try, and when I didn't answer, you could say you tried and that'd be that. Right?
But at the very same time, she is saying: "About Steve..."
The worst thing was, he was
Tony: For anyone involved.
"It was the last barrier," Steve said.
He imagines Tony looking him up and down, he can almost feel the searing eyes on his skin. He knows it's all in his head, knows he's getting himself worked up. But Tony's presence is like a shot of something ice cold, so cold that it's almost hot, and it makes your head swim, and Steve hasn't had something affect him like this in ages.
He didn't like the readings, so he
Tony: Thanks. Weirdly, it helps.
Tony rubs at his eyes. There is still a chance Steve simply went over to his room. Isn't there?
Tony: Oh, good God. [Tony is sending a picture]
Tony: That predictable, eh? I almost did.
to say, he added: "But you
was no joke. It was stupid and reckless – and really brave too – but no joke. And now he wanted Steve to stay. Maybe he wanted to spend more time with him while he still could? Maybe this was his way of saying goodbye?
with all the stubbornness you can muster. I never really lacked in that department. Neither did Tony. We're not exactly know for giving up. But, you know, most of it was good. Most of it was
Tony: Is that supposed to be very profound and philosophical? I've no idea what you mean, and also, the head is killing me.
Steve blinked. Blinked again. “Well,” he said, and then: “Well, it was
Tony shrugged. "I don't know. Not tomorrow, we have plans for tomorrow. If the weather lets up, that is." He snatched another strawberry Santa. "Tomorrow we are going to a theme park and out to eat – all three of us, that's going to be fun, yay –  and then she's going with Pepper to visit her family for a few days. Everything is arranged already, Morgan is looking forward to meeting her cousins and their numerous pets..." He shrugged, pretending he was cool with all that when he obviously wasn't too happy about it. He sounded as if he'd been trying to convince himself. "You don't change plans on kids."
"Hang out with kissing sounds good."
The heated looks Tony thought he was hiding didn't exactly go unnoticed. Steve had never really known how to flirt, but right now, right here, with Tony, words were practically saying themselves.  Perhaps it was the exuberance of Tony's company; perhaps he'd just waited for the right flirting partner.
"You seem awfully laconic all of a sudden," Tony commented with a certain sharpness in his voice.
The onset of drowsiness ambushed him and pummeled him down. All resistance was futile. He could barely hold his eyes open, and his thoughts were starting to wander uncontrollably. It was as bad as the last time he’d taken the stim, he’d have sworn it under oath, all the research funds down the drain, with the rain (pretty rain), all for nothing, the effect on him hadn’t improved at all, but here was Steve, and they should have gone to Malibu instead, Steve would have liked Malibu, with the warm sand and the sun and everything, not this time of year, though, obviously, but... And Tony knew he was drifting away, but he didn’t let go of Steve; that was the one thought he held firm in his mind.
Thank god Steve hadn't followed him. Tony couldn't deal with him and his pity. He practically ran into the ballroom, zeroed in on Rhodey and Carol and streaked through the few couples that still braved the dance floor – dancing in the face of the night's ending, in the face of the cleaning personnel that was already navigating the margins of the room.
"I'm actually all right," Steve told Bucky, uselessly, for the third time.
"Is this really necessary?" Steve muttered, his hands lingering on the waistband of his pants. "The legs are fine."
It had been barely a second. Steve zeroed in on him, as if reacting to the sound. Made a step toward him; another. Then his hands were firm on Tony's shoulders. "Tony, are you all
Some time passed. It was weird how cold it sometimes got down here. He tried doing a few stretches; it didn't help much. They were a few floors underground, or at least he thought so. Shouldn't the temperature be pretty stable, due to thermal inertia? Yes, yes it should. "Fuck you, thermal inertia," he muttered again. Still, the building was old, and there were all kinds of weird drafts at weirder times here, and he could sometimes hear the wind howling from somewhere above, through the antediluvian air-vents, high under the ceiling. (The vents were too narrow to escape through; he'd checked.) He knew cold southeastern wind was pretty prominent this time of year in this part of the world. So hence the cold, maybe. Or perhaps it was all in his head. It was dark, and he would get tired of darkness, and after a time the chill would creep into his bones, and no matter how much he huddled under the blankets, he couldn't get any warmer. And then, a few hours later, it would pass. Maybe it was just really, really cold overall, and from time to time his heart simply got tired of pumping so much blood. (It was tired of so many things, really.)
Tony: Because I just dreamed that you're dead, you died, and I can't take this, Steve, I can't, so just tell me you're there, you're okay. Jesus. Send a dick pic or something, whatever.
, Steve thought at himself sternly. He'd been wrong about Tony all right. Tony
I remember a conversation from over forty years ago. "For dying?"
“So? Pretty?”

"I don't think you can do it," I said. I knew it was no use, but I said it nevertheless.
Tony: So yay, another level of fucked up.
in the blanket."
Tony: No, I know.
Tony: Dammit, Rogers, do you have any idea who you're talking to? This is not crude, this is downright mannerly. You've yet to see MY crude.
Tony: I'm so pissed right now, you've no idea, Cap.
Tony: Are you actually angry with me for something that happened like 6 or 7 years ago?
They didn't talk more that night. As if by a silent agreement, they returned to reading, weirdly and unexpectedly comfortable with each other, for one evening at least, and all that could be heard was the occasional rustling of the pages. It wasn't long before Tony dozed off. Steve tossed one more blanket over him, and took another for himself. He then lay his cheek down on the book and listened to Tony's soft breathing as the fire slowly died down to embers.
Tony: And I was making a joke.
as to what would happen next, and the old feelings hitting back with a vengeance.
Tony: I once broke down because I broke a crayon, did you know? Such a weird situation. Like, you push through shit, and then you break a crayon aaand you're like 'I can't do anything right, mwaaaa'.
"We'll figure it out," Steve says softly. "I promise." And then he reaches out, and touches Tony's chest right next to the arc reactor. That's the spot that often goes numb, that still hurts when the weather is about to change. It's not numb now. And Steve splays his fingers and rests his palm against it, gently. "I know it's tired," he says. "But it's really not sucky."
Tony thinks guiltily.
more grounded thought is
Tony: Nope.
Inside the closed room, they find a note. Tony reads it and passes it to Steve without a word.
But, instead of leaping forward and getting shot, Steve seemed to have had the same idea as Tony. "For shame, Billy D.," he was saying at the same time. As an aside, to Tony: "I'll handle this." Then, again to the man with the gun: "For shame! What would your grandmother say?"
. He wanted to step up to Tony, take him back in his arms and kiss him – Jesus Christ, just one more time, just one solid, real kiss, for goodbye. The moment seemed to have passed, however. Now, somehow, although his hands were still on Tony's hips, the man seemed a hundred miles away.
Tony: We get this bullshit resolved, and then you’re all mine.
That the rescue had arrived in time was amazing. Still, Steve and Tony were used to fighting, they'd been through bad scraps before, and even hurt and incapacitated, the two of them knew what they were doing and knew how to do it together. They'd fought well, and now it was over. That they were both still in a more or less-decent condition was a miracle.
Tony: Did you always see us like this?
, a woman named Daisy had quipped, to which Fury – surprise, surprise – swore under his breath and rolled his eyes.
"Oh, you own a Santa Cap costume, do you?" He could practically
"You're actually getting off on this, are you, Rogers." A pause. And: "
, and to make things even worse, the man squeezes a bit, in warning. Jolted back to his senses, Tony quits gaping and plays along. He produces a silly, fond smile from somewhere, shooting murderous thoughts at Steve all the while. "Such a
“You know, I probably would,” Steve said and gave him the significant look number two. “That’s not the point.”
"Do what?"
A muffled hubbub came from the outside –  from the other end of the corridor, most likely, where he and Steve had left a nasty surprise for the pursuers. The bad guys will find in a minute or so... almost there... it should be sometime around now...
Tony:  The encryption's better when it's just texts. Safety and all that crap. Sry
Tony let the tablet fall beside him, propped himself up on one elbow. He blinked at Steve a few times, sighed, shook his head. "All right, Cap," he muttered. "All right."
Tony: Or they aren't trying very hard, which is my guess. At least some of them.
"So," Peter said. "How come you aren't over there?" He nodded his head toward the other end of the ballroom (still miles away). "Kyrumpting."
" Tony replies. A beat. "
Tony unlocked the door.
“Again, hm?”
The blanket was riling Tony up, and Steve couldn't resist. And Tony couldn't exactly tear his eyes away. Steve adjusted it, neatly stepping around Tony and lifting the lid off the pot. "Hmmm, something smells nice."
She looks at him like he is some bizarre space creature. Or, well, since there are a couple of bizarre space people raining snowballs on them right now, he thinks this may not be the best comparison. "I
"What, same thing, different name?" That was Daisy Johnson, who was also there. A very quick student, but prone to playing it down. "That's confusing." Tony was pretty sure it wasn't confusing to her at all. "Can't we just ditch both and call the thing something simple like... Dave?" Daisy grinned up at Rogers, who allowed himself to snort.
Tony: although i must admit 'lady' is still better than 'dame'
He now attempted to remember that breath-catching, starry-eyed feeling he'd had when he first enrolled in the Academy, but two decades of carefully practiced cynicism couldn't be so easily shaken off. It wasn't even that he wasn't sorry – he knew he'd acted inappropriately, and he'd happily submit himself  to whatever disciplinary measures...
That's what Steve is hearing, isn't it?
Steve blinked at him. Then his eyes softened. "Of course," he said. Tony replied with a small almost-smile. They, it seemed, had a truce.
"If everything is in order over there, round up some people, have them put the suits on and send them over to help out," Steve told him as the man hurried off. "Send someone up to inform the bridge of what's going on as soon as you can."
Last night, during sex, Tony didn't say a word. He can't let the last thing he said to Steve be:
It's heaven. It's agony. It's white hot shards of volcanic glass as Tony swirls his tongue over and around Steve's head. At the same time Steve wants to tear the handcuffs apart and slam Tony's head down onto him, as far as it would go, all the way to the root of the cock; and also he wants to pull it out and dunk it into a glass of cold milk because it's unbearable, it's been too long, too much stimulation, too much buildup; he can't stand this now, it's too late.
I just nodded. And then he kissed me, a barest brush of his lips against mine. That was my limit, that was more than I could take standing there. I took him in my arms, pressing my lips against his, hard, harder. I was massaging his scalp with one hand, the other I used to hold his body against mine, touching, just touching as much as possible. I wanted to flow around his body and envelop it in my own, somehow, touch every inch of it. Keep him there, mine and safe. I wanted to fall to my knees and press my face into his stomach and ask him to just hold me tight. Jesus, I was a mess, but if I knew one thing, anything at all, it was that I needed and wanted and loved this man in front of me more than anything else in the world.
. That was still me, I think, back then." I figure it's about then that time our universes diverged, but as per usual, I can't be. sure
To his left, someone who could be Darryl, although it was impossible to tell because of the smoke and the suit, was, with a few other people, pulling someone from under the viper and
"Aw, shit," Tony sighed. "Yes, yes, I know. Go ahead."
to herself.
Then Steve rolled to the side, propped himself up on an elbow. Tony felt his gaze like a caress, up and down his body. He couldn’t help but stretch languorously, then moved closer. He could feel a tired, satisfied smile invade his face.
His phone beeped, but despite a wild surge of hope – unfounded, since Steve wasn't much of a texter – he saw a years old, redheaded, longhaired picture appear on screen.
Tony: We're not going to stop talking forever.
Tony: What's with the interrogatory mode today?
Tony: Otherwise known for tasting like sponge.
He pushed in, too frantic to really appreciate it and more rushed than he liked. He gripped Steve's hips for purchase, then switched his grip, bent forward, took Steve's cock in his hand again. Steve moaned, throatily, still restrained. Tony pumped his hand back and forth, rapidly, roughly, as he pushed in, in, once, twice, just a few times. The strokes were short, uneven, not artful, not
I also think he's doing well. He's making things again, which is an unmistakable sign.  He has these crazy bouts of energy – more energy than me, these days, as a matter of fact. After those are over, he usually starts falling asleep on furniture, or on me, but then he wakes up restored and ready for more action.
Tony: A testimony, even were Everhart to give it, wouldn't be enough in itself. I haven't been in contact with any other possible witnesses. So, no case there. And Steve, when I said I gave Everhart all she wanted, it's true. This is every reporter's dream. This kind of data, this kind of opportunity for investigative journalism, she's going to lend a Pulitzer over it, wouldn't surprise me. She's not giving up a source like that. What can they promise her? Money? That's not what she's after here. Glory? They gave her that when they fucking arrested her. There are PROTESTS over the treatment of her, and for the freedom of the media. They are pretty massive. And I've got a wind that they are going to let her go by tonight, because at this point, with the government agencies, it's the matter of damage control.
"I have
Steve could still leave. He could get up, and see that Tony was better, and just... go. The truth was, they hadn’t talked, not really, and honestly Tony would rather do anything than dredge up all that again, but if he didn’t... then what? In all honesty, he’d offered Steve no reason to stay. All the interesting nuances of what had happened stayed safely  locked inside Tony’s head. And mornings tended to be way, way more difficult than nights.
"Okay," Tony whispered, and he wanted to fill his mouth with Steve, fill his
Tony: Christ, Steve, she WON'T. She just let you down gently. Relax.
It was the first time Tony had seen Steve since Siberia, and of course it had to be amidst all the snow and cold, all over again. It was his own fault entirely, that it happened here.
In and out, a few times, and then scissoring, unscissoring, and some fumbling on the inside, searching for the sweet spot that made Tony curse and arch his back all over again and dig his nails into Steve’s shoulder as hard as he could.
Tony: And I can sort of understand why you didn’t tell me, actually. About the assassination. Although I still can’t really fucking believe you didn’t. I don’t think I’m even angry with you any longer. I mean, I kind of stopped being angry, mostly, even before this, and now, I just...
. He had himself neatly convinced he simply had a huge soft spot for the guy, even though he tended to push all of Tony's irritation-buttons, enthusiastically and repeatedly and all at once. In the last year or two, Tony had even thought he was mostly cured from his non-feelings. Leipzig and Siberia had proven him spectacularly, hilariously wrong. It was a miracle, how good he was at burying his emotions into these tiny shit piles in order to hide them from himself. They were probably glaringly obvious to anyone else who cared to take a glance.
He was looking at me with a hint of glee in his eyes, waiting to see what I would say next. And I was sure about one thing: Anywhere, in any universe, Tony loved his friends. He wouldn't be looking forward to telling me the story unless it ended well.
Steve didn't move away. He stood there like a rock. He must have his own gravity, Tony figured, if he's affecting me like this. But Steve's hand rose, stayed motionless mid-air for a second, then, moved forward jerkily. His knuckles brushed against Tony's chest for a merest instant. Right where the arc reactor used to be. It was the weirdest of caresses and it made Tony's heart jump painfully, wanting more,
"No, I know it," Tony said.
Tony hooked one hand under Steve's arm (Steve acted all stiff and surprised, as usual) and the other under Fury's (who looked mildly outraged). "You and you and me," Tony said resolutely. "Saloon. Drinks. Now."
Tony: It is. But that wish lasts like two seconds.
Steve came over, sat on a stool opposite Tony. Made an attempt at a smile. (Which... didn't look half so bad, Tony mused.) "Can I make you some tea or something?"
It took a conscious effort to keep his mouth shut. His feet were itching to run to the side engines, and he kept thinking of those thuds he'd heard all the way through the well insulated ceiling, and he kept hearing the uncharacteristic urgency in Thor's voice as he said
I did my best to smile at her, and I had no idea what to say. Two people who had loved the same man for a long time, we still had nothing in common. When I came over, I usually played with Morgan, and Pepper was grateful for a bit of time for herself.
We both scooted closer, and now we were tightly pressed against each other, side to side.
find it admirable, the way Steve faced his fears without rushing headlong into danger in order to prove them nonexistent. But he couldn’t just say that, could he? It was difficult to gauge what a proper reaction would be, so: “Kudos to you for that.” And then, a beat later: “No, I actually mean it. But I bet you’d have liked Malibu better. Beaches and all.”
The battle had been slaughter. Their small flotilla – two civilian ships and their military escort – had jumped away a relatively short distance through space, in order to regroup and perhaps join with a bigger Colonial force, only to be ambushed again and again. The gunstars were picked off one by one. In the end, the remaining army ships and both civilian crafts had jumped off – a long way off, to a completely different sector of space. Tony wasn't exactly sure what happened there. He was just a bright aviatic engineer with a lot of money and a few saucy stories to his name; he wasn't on the need to know list. The rumor, however, had it that the Cylons had infiltrated the command navigation program, that they had infiltrated the whole Net. Rumors, he had come to realize, were as thick as the subliminal fear on a battleship of any sort. But if the story was true, then the Colonies were, mildly put, fucked in a very ugly way.
Tony: yeah? okay, sending them over
"What do you want from
Then, Tony again. (He was always the more talkative one anyway.) "Look, what I wanted to tell you is... I really don't have the time for this."
"I know."
suddenly painted his world a hundred of vibrant, glorious colors, because that world had Tony in it again.
Tony agreed wholeheartedly with this injury assessment, but it wasn't as if he had too much choice. "Working on it, big guy. Just a sec and we can go."
"Easy peasy," Peter said lightly and patted his arm. "Just ask him to dance."
All Steve could do was stand there and wait.
either. Steve had no idea what it was supposed to mean. Still, he was sorely tempted to just ask Stark to finish the lecture instead. Of course, it wouldn't do to put one of the cadets on the spot like that. Or to elevate him above the others.
Steve shook someone's hand – a solid handshake, as he
Tony: I didn't say I was falling apart.
Tony: If only we knew it was that easy, eh?
Tony: Oh? Did it break her heart?
Steve could still hear the alarm in Tony's voice when he said it earlier. And it made him feel guilty, but it also made him feel warm inside, that Tony apparently cared that much. Until recently, he'd thought Tony didn't want anything  to do with him whatsoever, ever again. Still, he now felt horrible that he'd caused Tony distress. All in all, he was a cocktail of mixed feelings, and it didn't taste very good at all.
Tony: I'm bored.
Honestly, it would have been enough for him just to be there quietly, just to stand beside Tony. He could have hung back. Clint and Sam had stayed, chatting with the others; and there was Thor, Thor was always easy to talk to. The others too – everyone, really, they were all okay again, weren't they. But stupidly, stupidly he'd opted for escape because he had no idea what to say or where to look, because his eyes seemed uncontrollably, magnetically drawn to Tony's eyes and Tony's lips. Steve had missed his face, even when it spooned out fake smiles.
Tony looked to the side, but the person approaching was just Carol. Rhodey seemed to already have spotted her. For a moment Tony wondered what the deal was; this wasn't like Rhodey and Carol at all, they were all about honesty and openness. Their romance seemed whirlwind fast to Tony. After the few initial, tentative steps, they skipped and skidded through most of the flirtation, and slid straight into the rock-solid area of an actual relationship. Tony had mentioned it, and Rhodey had said: "Jesus, Tony, I'm turning 49 this year, and either me or Carol could pretty much get killed in combat any day of the week. I don't waste time." It seemed like a solid strategy to Tony; he wished he himself could ever get to a level higher than high school, but there were games he simply wasn't any good at.
and the like, not strictly adhering to the truth, but, as self-reproaches went, pretty good.
a red herring, while Steve with his wholesome good looks and shy, sweet demeanor
Tony: And in the same vein, uh-oh. Rhodey just flew back from France, he's coming over, and I think he's pretty pissed at me. So I gotta go. Talk to you later.
"As soon as I saw you."
It was perhaps an hour later, when Tony stuffed his sweaty running clothes into the laundry chute, wrapped himself in a towel and stepped out of the showers. It was then he noticed the hum change.
"It's no problem. Really."
Tony: But, as I was saying, when I lash out, two seconds later I already don't want to hurt  you any more. I don't want to have hurt you. I hate myself for having done it. I just wanted to tell you that, so that you'd know.
Why was it so easy to believe Steve? When Tony tried telling that to himself, it never worked, but once Steve put it to words, it was like a charm taking hold.
Tony: Also, you are becoming a true master of deflection. Who would've thunk?
Tony: About what I said that night – which is one of the things I didn't quite mean, which you've probably figured out, but still.
The conversation was promptly turning into the theatre of the absurd, but perhaps it was better than the silences. Still, this time Tony opted for a pause, as the only option to get the convo back on track.
how they affect morals."
Steve fought a smile; lost. He was perfectly aware that Tony wouldn't fail to notice.
Tony: Preach, big guy.
STARK: Huh. [glances at the his notes] Ladies and gentlemen... and Mr. Bachman...[laughter in the audience]... We all heard what happened in Madripoor. We all saw the news. I am not here to talk to you about that. I am here today to tell you what
"I'm okay," he said tersely. Then he turned the extinguisher on and waded deeper into the area of dancing blue and green flames, flashing through the smoke like big, ghostly suns.
Tony: Well, it's not.
But Steve ducked the next missile and the following one caught him in the chest, which wasn’t nearly as satisfactory. It proved impossible to hit him anywhere near the face again, but he still managed to feed Tony another loosely packed snowball, and the snow found it’s wet, crawly way into the collar of Tony’s ski suit. This could be repaid properly only one way, and he found himself barreling into Steve, hooking the man’s ankle with his right foot and pushing him backwards into the white and the soft and the deep. On his way down, Steve grabbed Tony’s waist and pulled him with him. And he must not have been trying too hard, because Tony managed to land on top.
Tony: See, you know what you're doing there. With the light and shading and all. You make it look like a painting, almost.
He wants to wrap his arms around Steve, to help him up, whisper all sorts of soft nonsense into his ear. He wants to touch him, pet him, kiss him everywhere. Tell him how wonderful he's been, tell him how much he loves him.
Tony: God, Steve.
He needed to talk, to distract himself. Pronto.

you are making," he declared flippantly, "make it for two."
"Perhaps the stable hands down in the yard will have seen something..." the other man began, but a glare from Tony cut him in half.
STARK: Oh, yes, of course. Sorry.
Tony: Not the most tactful thing to say, given. But honestly what the fuck?
Tony: I never asked for your fucking permission.
for an agency of that ilk, I know way more about the workings of this than anyone out there should be comfortable with. Whoever bothered to sift through the data Nat and Steve released a few years back, could have seen plenty of this there. Plenty of proof. We can all politely pretend it's not so, you go ahead, but that's just not true.
"And friends don't do what we did last night," Steve adds.
"Are you going back?" the Ancient One asked. I thought she meant back to my present, obviously.
Steve trailed of, and, good god, it was as if Tony was fishing for an invite. He was alone now, so he was calling Steve, of all, people, to tag along with him to Romanoff's little gathering at the Compound? Good grief, how pathetic did Steve think Tony was?
The point I was trying to make, though, is that we still tiptoed around each other. I didn't want to pressure him into anything and I didn't have the stomach to be irritated with him even when I was rationally aware I normally would have been. He later admitted that the idea of ever  yelling at me tied his guts into a knot.
He even felt so gutsy he dared a long look at Steve. Seated on the gurney and leaning back on his left hand, Steve seemed strangely at peace.
"All right," Steve said quietly. "Yeah, all right, let's do that. Let's go to California."
Steve sat down. Tony passed him a plate of assorted goodies (blue cheese and blackberry marmalade and salsa dip), then poured himself another cup of coffee. He then turned to Steve. This type of thing had never been easy, even when
And, inevitably, in his mind Tony heard an echo of the words uttered months ago.
The gurgling in my throat must have sounded quite intelligent.
Steve was immediately sorry he'd bothered him. He should have sent Natasha. Or Thor. He shouldn't have left Thor waiting in the corridor. Maybe some congenial intimidation would work here. "This is off the record, between you and me," Steve added. "Just your professional opinion."
Tony pulls Steve away from the others at some point. He coerces him into going outside, all the way to Tony's car.
Tony: Awesome beard, ridiculous cape?
Outside, he knew, the wind had stopped during the night, and snow had fallen and hushed the world. As soon as the sun  showed up from behind the mountains, the morning would turn quietly brilliant.
?" It escaped Tony's lips before he could stop it.
Strange has implied that Tony needs me; it's not as if I could say no.
Phone, right. The thinking-people option. It had never even crossed Tony's mind. All he could think was that he should check the engines as soon as possible. "But what's with the phone line?" Tony's question was rhetorical. If the phone lines were down, it spoke of a more general damage than just the grav-strips.
He didn't want that to be that. That was the

Tony: Jesus Christ, Steve, you don't give up, do you?
Tony: For obtaining information in the not most legal of ways, eh. And aw come one, I can never know what you're going to be judgy about. It's you.
but he wanted to say so many things at the same time, that in the end he didn't.
Tony, I was sure that
"Why won't you walk down the red carpet with me?" Tony whined now, more to get his mind off things than anything else.
Something caught in Tony's throat. "I don't think you're cheesy, Steve. I think you are..."
“Not really.” He paused. “Maybe a bit. Look, Steve, I...” Tony stopped. It seemed another groan would be the only possible way to do justice to his feelings. He had to say something in return, though, he knew that; but squeezing the words out may have been one of the hardest things he’d ever done. “You’re a good guy, with a heart of gold.” It came out softer than he’d expected. “You’re my good friend too. I just don’t know what to do with everything that happened. I didn’t want to deal with it. So I didn’t call. But now... I know I want you
Steve's phone was off, for better or worse. There was also a normal-person option of finding Steve and actually striking up a conversation. And he did intend to do it, he
Bruce arrived practically at that instant, saving Tony from any further questions or too observant gods.
"Want me to put some more wood on the fire?" Steve asked. The flames looked vigorous enough to Tony. When he'd come here, that morning, it was ice-cold in the house and it smelled of agedness and dust. Fire smelled new.
Tony: Nope. Because I'm a better person than you.
He sighed and buried his face into his hands for a moment. Took a deep breath, calmed down. He gave his new Captain a tired look, then jumped to his feet, started pacing.
The warmth on the crook of his elbow came from Tony's hand that lay there, squeezing lightly. Steve held his breath. He wanted him to never remove that hand.
His suit felt too tight and unnatural around his shoulders. He could barely breathe.
He just blinks at me for a moment, then glances back at Nat. "Is this real? Is he...?"
happen?
Tony: I told you I stopped.
Tony: Now, I mean, tell me in like more than two syllables.
They didn't. They barely spoke.
After a time, the shivering started to subside. Tony imagined he felt Steve's body temperature start to creep up. That was relatively quick, he supposed, trying to swallow the tears of relief before they could get out into the wild. The serum wasn't known for taking things slow.
Tony: True. Never seen Clint get so vocal before, though.
I froze. Those words, like an echo from long ago. What was I supposed to say to that?
They had both lost their jackets, somehow. Tony bit his neck. For a moment, Steve's tender skin stayed trapped between Tony's upper teeth and his lower lip, and that patch of skin and those teeth were the only thing that still existed in Steve's world.  Making a happy, muffled sound at Steve's shiver, Tony started trailing small bites towards the shoulder, leaving a line of fire in his wake.
Tony: Because you caused yours and you caused mine.
to run into someone, because there would be people on shift. Only, what condition would they be in? Well. There's your million dollar question. Tony almost didn't want to find out. At this point, hope was beginning to seem somehow frivolous.
“Rude, Cap,” Tony escaped into their old routine. “They’re really good for you.”
"...with little snowflakes in them, and..."
"Take the left turn," Steve told him, blissfully unaware of any of this. He probably felt secure, hidden behind his hair and beard.
This was when Steve fucked up.
Tony: because it's got a certain sexist connotation
"You are not skiing off into the night, alone, in the middle of a blizzard, you ass," Tony snapped, at the same time as Steve said: "I'm not leaving you here sick, with no electricity, miles away from civilization."
Tony’s quiet admission seemed to give Steve the courage to say the words that he had been holding in. "You share them, don't you? The dreams. I thought I sensed you there."
back in my face now."
Tony: Steve?
Some of the sketches made me blush. Most of those were pretty vague, with sheets draped over the key bits, the way I usually do it, but even the full nudes were done very tastefully. But, the artist was, after all – me.
Steve was sitting back, his legs stretching in front of him for miles. Tony always wondered how he fit into normal chairs. He now gave Tony a knowing look out of the corner of his eye. “Me, sitting down in the snow,” he explained. “It was childish.” More tense than mellow now. Clutching the mug with both hands as if it held answers.
And yes, harder and harder now. Tony is really massaging it, and Steve's insides are on fire, and all he can do is suck in one breath after another and want, want, want.
way. "What do you say we get to eating? The roast should be ready and rested by now."
Tony: There's nothing to it. I told you, don't worry.
Tony: Are you crazy?
" out of the corner of his mouth.
He's pushing words out by sheer force of will. "Do... three... Put three... fingers... in me." He hears Tony's words in his head again:
As Steve opened his mouth, probably to offer something else conciliatory, Tony heard himself say: “Gee, keep me company, that’s mighty big of you, Captain...”, and crap, it was too sharp, too mocking, too
Tony: Really?
Was he going to discover a way to go back to my timeline? I had no idea. I doubted it, but then again, he solved the last unsolvable problem too. Did I root for him to succeed? I wasn't sure. I thought it was courting disaster, but Tony and disaster had had a long and painful courtship, and sometimes one came out on top, and sometimes the other. I felt stretched thin and very old at that moment, like people in their 30s sometimes do, and I didn't know anything for sure any longer. No, scratch that. I knew
Friday saved the day, as per usual. "All done, boss." And with a click, the door opened magically. Once inside, Tony had to calm down, try to do something right for once, try to talk his way through this.
His voice. It's like I've been tightly curled up around myself, somewhere on the inside, and now I've suddenly uncoiled. I know I break into a smile because my face hurts. It's an uncontrollable reflex.
And then, surprisingly, inexplicably, Fury had found him in the supply rooms, sorting through the salvaged parts. Commander Fury had actually come down to the tech deck to find him, to ask why in the name of hell Tony didn't apply for pilot training and did he have any idea how few people they had were competent at flying at all, let alone equipped with a civilian flying license of the highest order, like his. And that was it. There was an announcement later that people over the age of 35 would also be allowed to take the test, due to the scant number of survivors. Thus, Tony took the test. So did Hammer. So did, he remembered, dozens of others – techs, civilians, even some petty officers. Everyone wanted to fly. Flying was the only way to feel in control, to feel you weren't stuck in this fucking space container for ever and ever. In the tiny world trapped inside a metal shell, flying meant freedom.
his feelings were ridiculous, coming to think of it. This was happening too fast. It would be over before it began. What business did he have, getting jealous?
"I'm... Look, I'm all right, Cap. I just need to rest for a bit. I'll be all good by morning."
talk, Tony could keep this under control. If they started talking, he'd fall fast, and that just wouldn't do.
touching him there... Like he had pressed a button. Tony gasped and shuddered and his back jerked up and then down, and
Cap didn't dislike him, not exactly, he decided. The man was supposedly fair, or so everyone said; that entailed not making preemptive judgments, didn't it? Only, Tony wasn't presenting himself in the best of lights either, coming here, getting tipsy, being a jerk to Hammer yet
"Oh, I meant it," I told him, without raising my eyes, searching on. There was a two-year gap in my journals, and then, when they re-started, I saw entries and notebooks I didn't recognize. Reading them would have felt like an invasion of privacy; I wanted to do it so fiercely it hurt. To see the thoughts of that other Steve, the lucky bastard who'd had Tony to himself during those five years, who had some real history with him.
Steve: Yeah.
Tony rolled his eyes. Was it actually possible that some people somewhere
?" I asked, trying to be casual about it, but suddenly hungry for information. "
Tony blinked as if he'd been caught doing something embarrassing. "What?"
He whispered
Tony: Look, Steve, if I ever stop hating it, even for a little bit, I'm quitting and that's it.
Tony: So I'm actually pretty sorry about that one.
"More read/Reed jokes, after all these years? Really, Stark?"
After this brief introduction, he settled into a chair in the back and let himself be absorbed by the already familiar material. But what drew his attention more and more was the animation on Stark's face, the glint in his eyes as he flirted with the principles of physics, the easy grins as he courted the engines he described. It was obvious he loved the subject.
From time to time Tony would grow sad thinking about Morgan, and he still tinkered with his interquantum travel ideas. There would be crazy spurts of work; he wouldn't raise his head for days, but he always came to the same conclusion. It couldn't work. There had to be one problem he couldn't solve, I suppose. We did talk to Strange and the Ancient One (who was still alive in our timeline), and they outright refused to help and told us not to ask again. I thought it was probably for the better, but I still hurt for Tony.
It had been months.
Forgetting their squabbling, both Tony and Steve hurried to lift the rubble off. The job was painstakingly slow. Tony's heart was vaguely audible in his ears, like a background beat from far away.
There was Tony with that look again, naked just for a second, taken aback. If you didn't know his face so well, you'd have missed it. Steve thought almost anyone but himself would have missed it. He almost melted, there and then, almost took Tony's hand in his own, almost said
Although his hands are high above his head, Steve manages to shrug. "And I said that was fine." His voice is slightly wavery, and not with apprehension. He can still feel his nipple burn, and on one hand it's too sensitive, and on the other it's itching to be touched again, played with. He wants those hands on him, doing
, Tony wanted to say, but didn't.
Tony: Hill??
He'd look into Tony's eyes, and quickly away; he'd blush faintly, then try to cover it up. He'd let himself be entrapped for a second, as if getting caught in a fantasy web, then step back resolutely, all straight face and stern voice. And Tony couldn't be sure anything was actually going on there either – but on a good day, he thought Rogers was
"I'm going to hurt your nipples a little bit, now," Tony says. He sounds hoarse. "Which one do we do first, the left one or the right one? This," he adds, trying for dryness, but his voice has gone too breathy for that, "is me, asking for your opinion."
Tony: He what??
I notice the back of the head of a man she's hugging. They hold each other for a moment, she kisses his cheek, and then she's away. I wish my Tony could see her like this – all grown up and lovely, her jeans and doc Marten's stained with what appears to be motor oil.
Tony made himself stop. Sat down. Met Rogers' gaze halfway. What was it that made him feel this way? The fact the Cap held Tony's fate in his hands? No, it wasn't that. Everything in Tony reeled in protest at the thought. This was just a nervous reaction, probably. An acute fear of dying out here, in this space bucket, without ever seeing the stars again. Something understandable like that. Hangover. Lack of sleep. (That one was always a good excuse.)
"Yeah." Tony said, feigning lightheartedness, and failing.  "
He moved marginally closer to Steve. He imagined he could feel the warmth oozing off the man in waves, but, Tony rationalized, it must be himself, his heart pumping frantically, so loud Steve was probably able to hear it.
We did get married properly about two months later. Still, this was the anniversary we celebrated afterwards.
on a gala in a royal palace in Norway, to the amusement and disbelief of the surrounding people; she had always been cool, really.
now (but a good sort of too much!). And he never stopped moving inside Tony, now with choppy, short jabs. Tony opened his eyes, to see Steve’s face contorted  above him, as if in pain. And Steve jerked one more time, shuddered, and his whole body went stiff; stayed like that for a moment. And then he collapsed on top of Tony, panting wetly. It sounded almost like sobbing. Tony put both his arms around him, pulling him closer, rubbing his back, the back of his neck. He lifted his own head and placed a small kiss amid Steve’s hair. The sweet warmth that rose in his chest pretty much equaled the orgasm in intensity.
Steve felt his eyebrows climb. He'd heard stories – everyone had; he'd just forgotten the young officer in them had actually been Fury. "You knew him. At the Academy," he said, because stating the obvious was apparently his M. O. when he was this tired.
It seemed easier if they simply didn't go on.
As Tony's back disappeared into the right hand corridor, Steve promptly put the helmet back on (well, it was a sensible thing to do). He checked if the comm was working. Mostly white noise, and then quiet but distinct muttering.
. You don't have to
"Nothing, You need to concentrate on the job in front of you, Stark." He gentled his tone. "Cut the chatter now, for real. Report when you see something relevant."
"Morgan Stark," he repeated slowly, savoring the pain of every syllable. Can you miss someone you've never met? Miss them so much it made you fall apart on the inside? Tony could. "Tell me more," he murmured.
"But your people didn't let you know about the electricity problem and the possible pipe problem?" Steve asked.
Curiously enough, there was nothing about Tony in the files. It was almost as if he never existed.
Overall, if they could get any help, that would be good, but there was no time to focus on that. He needed to go on. For all Steve knew, life support could give out at any moment. The important thing was to get to the landing bay. He 'd find the techs on shift there, if they were alive. He suspected he'd find Darryl there as well, which was precisely why he'd sent Thor the other way; if something irrevocable had actually happened, Thor could live without seeing it first-hand; he'd lost too many close friends lately.
"That would be a pretty good idea, yes," Steve said and tried not to let himself be amused. "At least for a sec."
Tony shrugged in response, then remembered that wouldn't help much. "I'm fine," he said. "I don't feel like sleeping."
"We have a safe house relatively near here," Rhodey answered. "We get there, we have something to eat, we regroup, we all talk about what's to be done next." Steve couldn't discern his expression, but his voice sounded straightforward and a little dry. Steve thought he nodded at him. "All right with that, Cap?"
"How are the strength exercises going?" Cap enquired, and by now he was back to his normal stiff self, or at least he sounded it. Tony half expected him to call him 'son' one of these days, which was – everything considered – a bit too icky.
Tony: Just stress, baby.
that, intensely, but it drew his gaze. And then, sometimes, when Tony was at the lectern, explaining, or while listening to Steve's tactics lessons and scribbling in his notebook (actual, paper notebook, which he kept complaining about) – a different Tony emerged. That one wasn't all ready charm and flashy grins. There was a glint in his eye, a thoughtful smile, an endless fascination with his subject; seemingly unending patience when he needed to explain something for the fifth time. He never seemed to grow bored. He never put the other cadets down directly. But then he'd go and spoil it all by saying things like 'dumbing the matter down for the kids' to Steve. Steve couldn't decide if it was genuine, deeply rooted arrogance or just Stark's mouth running faster than his brain.
. He'd wanted to be friends at best, Tony told himself, that was that. (Well, now that's fucked too, most probably.)
“Steve, I...”, he began.
Tony: As a collateral
Very late in the evening, all of them decide to go out for a walk. It's well after midnight and it's freezing outside, and everyone is a little drunk (even Steve, on some alien liquor Carol brought), so when someone (Rocket?) lets the first snowball fly, it all descends into chaos super fast. Before Tony knows it, Carol is dragging Steve away (because
"Slow down. Hey! You need to slow
[laughter]
it not pleasant, and by now he's so desperate to feel anything at all right there that he cold weep. It goes on until his skin is burning, until Steve starts moaning in earnest, and then Tony is back at playing with his nipples, now working on his neglected right one. Taps and caresses of the tails. The warmth building, accumulating. He wakes his nerves up incredibly slowly, incredibly patiently; softness, softness, and then, all of a sudden, a sharp sting on the slightly sore left breast makes Steve jerk. Tony is smirking at him.
"Lose the self-pity, Steve", he said. "it doesn't suit you."
. When he replayed the conversation in his mind (and again; and – shamefully –
, he thought. This is crazy. Why am I doing this crazy thing. Why didn't I do it earlier? Why...
"Thor, we're not...
Tony: Again, okay, maybe it's better if you don't tell me who it is, in case I get pulled in too. But you could have your handler contact me somehow in case something goes to hell, okay?
Tony: Yeah?
Tony: I think that's exactly why it works for some people.
our memories, we
"What?" Steve asked. He located what looked like a chemical fire that could easily be the source of the thickest, blackest smoke.
Steve stepped away hurriedly. "Er," he said. "Why are you wearing a towel?"
. Wild excitement burned its way through him.
Tony: I can barely wait.
There wasn't much in the way of packing for Tony to do, really. Shaving kit. A paperback he'd read three times already and figured he could probably trade off for booze. Being so far from the civilization – if a civilization still existed – made books a rare commodity. Half the clothes he'd had in his bags Tony'd donated for the rescued civilians – not that he was likely to have much use for business suits nowadays, anyway. The only business meeting he was likely to attend, he figured, would be with Hecate, and for that he wouldn't need to dress to impress.
"Well, maybe," Steve replied. Tony's eyebrow shot up in amusement, but it was a wasted effort, since his cheek still rested against Steve's shoulder. (The good, hard, warm shoulder; he'd happily rest his head there for all eternity.) "But it doesn't mean I wasn't a jerk too. One doesn't cancel the other," Steve concluded.
Tony wants to strangle Steve. He also wants to push him against the wall and kiss him silly, because he's missed this – the missions, the stupid bickering, everything. Having him so close.
"They're almost here," Tony said, although he had no idea why he was whispering. And he turned to Steve, opening his mouth to say something... something
“I always loved the ocean,” Tony said, as if answering a riddle.
"Oh, but they are still fresher in the morning. Come
"Well, as I said, my motel is nearby," Steve began. Then  he flushed bright red, as red as Tony's sweater. "I didn't mean... All I meant..."

everywhere. He'd went overboard, as he usually did, with the kid-friendly Christmas snacks, healthy and not so healthy ones– oh god, all the cheese reindeer and the banana snowmen and the Santa hat jello shooters (with no alcohol, obviously) and all the other atrocious things Morgan would have loved. It took him almost the whole day yesterday to make them all, and there was still a ton of ingredients for the dinner he had been going to make and the easy cookies he had been going to bake and decorate with Morgan.
, not without a plan.
" He looked taken aback. "For
Only a chapter and a half left :)
Tony: See, was it that difficult???
They hug, and they hold each other, and it takes a long, long time to let go of Natasha, because Natasha also seems reluctant to let go of him.
He started towards Steve with no particular intention in mind. Hands on shoulders and such hadn't been their thing even when they were better at dealing with each other's presence. His heart burned in his chest, just like after eating too much hot sauce.
tired, and jacuzzi sounds like a wet dream, in more ways than one, even if he's alone in it, which would – let's face it – definitely be the case tonight.
Thor sighed theatrically. "Kyrumption: When two great heroes come together on the field of battle..."
Tony: Just go ahead, tell me it's none of my business.
And when a few of their captors finally figured something was wrong and filed out of an elevator, Tony and Steve were ready. Tony shot two of them before they had the time to fire, and then Steve was upon them, among them, kicking, punching, twisting and throwing. Tony was happy to knock out a nearby dude with a butt of his gun to the temple. He mostly kept silent, because Steve moved guided by his hearing, but from time to time, Tony would say
Tony: Hm.
, Tony tells him in his head. And:
Tony: I still mean what I said.
"But you..." Tony starts again.
Tony: You can't have a REMATCH if we haven't finished the previous MATCH.
that would help them figure out the intentions of their captors and the best way to screw up their plans and get the hell out of here.
"Don't apologize," Peter said, typically misreading his intention. Then he peered into Tony's face, frowning a bit. "Wanna share that crap with a friend, man?"
The frog in my throat was an unexpected addition, a neutral observer. "I do," I managed, even though I suspect I sounded a little squeaky there for a moment. The ring slipped onto my finger as if it had always been there.
"That's done and over with, Stark," Fury said curtly. "We lost. I take it you heard?"
The woman seemed awfully cool and blasé, despite the way the media treated Tony and his friends now. Hosting these events and dealing with royalty on regular basis would do that to you, he supposed. Besides, there had to be hundreds of superheroes, state officials and military brass from all over the world here; and working with superheroes, at least, was like herding cats. The woman needed to get them
Tony: It's going live tomorrow. Exclusively on Everhart's network for 24 hrs, then I'm putting the whole bulk of the thing on the net.
That wasn't much better, but the quicker he got to the point, the faster this torture would be over. After all, Steve probably had plans... But no, it wasn't fair to hope he couldn't make it; Morgan would be so disappointed.
And then, his eyes suddenly sharp, he stated: “Yeah, sorry, but that’s out of the
He's just a superior officer, so what, Tony tried telling himself. He had no idea why he was being this nervous. Nervous, yes, but also a little pissed, because... did Cap really have to come down here in order to bust him? Now, on his first day? What was the big idea, to kick him off the force before Tony even started?
, something in Tony thinks for a sec. But then the window shatters, and it's obviously a sniper, and as sweet as all this is supposed to be, Tony doesn't want Steve taking a bullet for him, and
Something new. Thank you."
Tony had let him hold his hand for eleven and a half seconds, then confiscated it.
Tony: I can hardly send an android to do it, eh? And Rhodey is still perceived more as a member of the military than anything else. And those are the options we got at the moment.
"Where to?" Tony asked. "I'm just passing through, but I can give you a lift to pretty much anywhere in the hood. As long as we don't end up in a snowdrift."
Tony: You get to do whatever you want.
Scarlet Witch and Steve Rogers are the only ones among us that have any kind of, what you would call, powers. I mean, Steve is just very strong, but whatever. The rest of us here are just normal guys, with a lot of training and good tech. I have no special powers. Natasha – Black Widow – doesn't either, though that's hard to believe. Neither does Sam. We just... we just use what we have to the best of our abilities. To try and do the damage control here, and to hunt down the bad guys.
He had to get out of here. He had to... "We need to talk. Like, now," he muttered at Steve, almost a whisper. Because this was insane. The music was getting louder, and the dancers were whirling away, not so far from them now, and maybe no one was paying attention to him and Steve any more, locked as they were in their silent battle, as per usual. Still, it seemed they were going to end up yelling or snarling at each other (probably a healthy combo of both) – even though it had been the last thing Tony wanted, merely half an hour ago – so at least they should do it away from all these people.
want to know if he's fitting in? He's – don't give me that slow smile, for gods' sake – he's older than the others, and different, and he's unused to authority, and I don't know what to make of him. So I wanted to know what you thought. He's good – he's very good, actually – but is he going to stay good, once he's out in the Black? Is he going to panic? Is he going to be rash, like the elder Quint brother was?"
Selfish.
Then a sudden thought occurred to him. Was that what Steve wanted? Did he want Tony to make that decision for him? Relieve him of the responsibility? Was it why he was here?
It felt a bit like the carnival ground on the morning after.
Tony: shit
I wanted to say, because the last thing I wanted was to think about his death, now that this other Tony was sitting here with me. Still, I could see the urgency in his face – not eagerness, exactly, but something that told me he wouldn't be at peace until he found out. And for better or worse, there was no way I was saying
Mutely, I shook my head. The jealousy I felt was momentous and sharp, and directed solely at my alter ego. He got to have what I'd wanted so badly and what I could never have had. But that feeling was quickly trumped by a deep sense of inadequacy. Inadequacy to  replace this timeline's version of myself. Tony kept insisting we were the same person, his Steve and I, more or less, but now it was clear we weren't. This place's Steve must have had something I don't. "We were...
“So, you’ll call?” Steve had asked earlier, with a small smile. They were still in the cabin. Leaving the cabin behind felt a bit like one tiny, happy world ending.
"Friend Tony!“, Thor boomed and grinned down at him, holding him at arm's length now and looking him up and down for a moment, then pulling him back in and giving him a hearty slap on the back. It'd been a year, but Thor was, as ever, unchanged. He was, oh god, he was wearing a dinner jacket and leather pants, but somehow, improbably, he was pulling it off (possibly because no one was likely to notice the dinner jacket, really). Tony himself felt rather worse for wear, and, right now, also pretty squished. He disentangled himself from the man's enthusiastic embrace and let Thor say his hellos.
Tony: And one who experimented on himself. Although that's a time-honored mad scientist practice, so.
But he hasn't considered this, really, because Steve grabs him right back, and pulls him even closer, so that they are pressed tightly against each other, chest to chest, glaring into each other's eyes, and Tony's stomach is flipping and turning with wild excitement.
They walked towards the elevator, side by side, bumping elbows, and Tony was saturated in warm glow, a golden feeling, as if this was going to lead somewhere, somewhere good and right, and not stay frozen mid-motion forever, the way it had to.
, if for a moment. The fighting had been particularly nasty that day. It didn't bear remembering. When the lull finally came, he and Tony had found each other, fallen into step as if by magic, as if for a moment the past didn't exist. Right then it certainly seemed the future wouldn't either. And they found out they couldn't exactly go rest, either of them, no matter how tired they were. Thor had kept them company, to start with, but as the night progressed, he, uncharacteristically, melted away and left the two of them to their intricate lacework of conversation and silences. And that was that – their first and last real talk since the Civil War. Steve wasn't embarrassed he cried, because certain things require crying, as long as no one found out. And when you're drunk it doesn't really count, does it? Also, he had been pretty discreet about it and maybe Tony hadn't noticed...
"I don't remember you popping the question."
Tony zoomed in on a guy on his knees, a target painted on his forehead. He saw him take something out of his sleeve; it was the same doodad Tony used, but this man didn't just want a drink, didn't just use it to carry around a concealed flask in his sleeve. The man half-turned around, opened his mouth to make an inane and no doubt malicious comment before he...
But we don't start at the beginning. Middles tend to be way more interesting.
Tony: You haven't, true.
Tony: That's precisely why I'm good at these press events and you aren't.
THE END
Tony: I don't care. But I can swing both at once. Jeez.
And then they move on. Only Bruce lets himself look decently shocked at the news of the two of them together. After Tony triumphantly starts pulling out leftovers from last night from a bag, everything descends into the normal, food-centered chaos. Even with the new people there, it somehow feels he was never away.
And Tony said, "Good idea," and then he said, "Wait, I have Darryl on the line," because finally, finally he did. And, instead of asking about Cap, he tried to stick to the priorities. He quickly informed his former boss what they were going to do and how. Then he patiently listened to Darryl give calm, thorough instructions to everyone on his side of things. And then there was floating, hovering, a gentle somersault in the air, like in slow motion. Hope kept turning the grav field up, up, until Tony could stand normally without any inclination to levitate off the ground.
Even though I'd be the first to admit a certain kind of electricity existed between the two of us, this was hardly what I'd had in mind.
Tony: You're one prickly bastard, did you know that?
Not if they can’t manage to keep this
Tony: And then we talked about way more important stuff than some cruddy super-soldier serum, bc who cares about such, eh?
Steve is still blushy but determined.
Tony fumbled for something inane to say, a comment to divert attention, to mask his eyes that had gone wide with worry.
Tony: Listen, therapists are not my thing, and not yours either. But there are other options, as we've established previously.
"If I ask you to lend me some clothes, you're going to tell me to get the hell back to bed, right?" Steve asked, finding the time for an amused twitch of the eyebrows. Still, he sounded urgent more than anything else.
, and
Tony: We just said goodbye not half an hour ago, and I miss you so fiercely it’s practically ridiculous.
It was too intimate. Every object in here tugged at a different spot in Tony's heart. (Every person here, present and absent, tugged at something too.)
No, seriously, he had to stop walking around half-naked. This was ridiculous. But, "Shower," he muttered, and "No time". He waved his hand dismissively, firmly deciding to forget the fact he was standing there with practically no clothes on. With Steve of all people next to him. Close. So very close.
Tony: But then, Clint happens, via your running commentary. Clint happens; Clint's sorry. And that's it for me, I'm done, I'm over, I'm gushing to the press. And after that, I can't but wonder – what kind of person am I, to roll over like that, to latch onto the... what wasn't even an apology, since he didn't even say it to ME?
The traces of old, faded disappointment leaking into Steve’s tone pushed Tony into the mild defensive stance. “Well, I thought you could use a luxury vacation after slumming it across America on your motorbike. Sue me. I didn’t think it’d matter if I were there or not.”
But, instead of talking, Steve snapped into action. When Tony had first found himself here, he had acted in exactly the same manner, examining everything, trying everything, looking for a way out. Now, after days and days, he knew there wasn't much he could do, but Steve was probably just captured and had a fresh portion of hope at his disposal.
. He thinks of Steve saying those same words to
"So, it's all right  for you to hop around the multiverse, but for me it isn't? Don't get me wrong, I'm glad you decided to hop over to here."
And now Rogers was at the lectern in the briefing room. His voice was obviously pertaining to seriousness, but his blue eyes were dancing, his face livelier than usual. Tony'd seen him like this before – in the landing bay, right before getting into his viper: not cheerful, no, but energetic,
"It wasn't like that," Steve said, shaking his head with some vehemence. This just rooted Tony firmer in the belief that it had been
A nod. Then, since Tony felt a better explanation was in order, he added: "I have a mother and a father of all colds, thanks very much for asking, and the electricity's out too."
, Tony wanted to snap, but clamped his mouth shut. He could just see Steve in his mind's eye, barging into the fire, all by himself. Admiration had absolutely no business showing up for something so asinine, really.
Tony: we'll talk
When Steve walked into the empty classroom, it, of course wasn't empty.
"Carrying. I don't know, I was out of it, mostly. When I wasn't... No, I'm pretty sure I didn't see any light. Look, the serum may still regenerate whatever's damaged," Steve said. His voice was level. "We'll see, eventually. Tony, why are you dragging your foot?"
It had started at the new cadets' orientation meeting. No, actually, it had started back in the tech dormitory, when Cap overheard his catty exchange with Hammer.
"Screw you, Tony," I said very gently, and I knew he knew I meant something quite different.
Tony: You seem perky today.
"I do apologize, but I'm going to have to check your names now, and I will need the list of pairs or, er, any other arrangements, please."
"I'm just asking: why would it be different, with friendship? Does it need to be... actualized in some way?"
Steve was at his side in an instant. "You got injured. What is it?"
Steve went very still for a moment. Tony could feel his muscles tense up and wondered what was wrong.
He took Steve by the arm and guided him towards the bed behind a folding screen. He sprawled on his back. He took a few shuddering breaths that didn’t do much in the way of calming him down. “What,” he forced the words out. “What do you want to do?”
"He was in the first class I taught." If he didn't know better, Steve would have dubbed the look on Fury's face as fleeting melancholy. Thankfully, it passed in a moment. Fury shook his head. "I had him kicked out of school within two months."
Tony shrugged, as if that was of no consequence whatsoever. "I made a fortune – once again – on this planet; then I lost a fortune; now I'm in Timely." He never mentioned anything about his change of heart, about melting down his guns, nothing. He could go on and on about that to Steve, once he got into his cups, but now, not a word. Perhaps it didn't matter to him as much as Steve thought it did, after all. Perhaps nothing here did. Tony's real life had come calling.
Tony thought ruefully. He had no answer, but he was pretty sure the obvious one shouldn't be taken into account. He'd reviewed all the data last night. That conclusion simply didn't hold water.
Yep. That's going to be the title of his second memoir. Fucking Walmart! It wouldn't be that noticeable if the cut of the jeans was better!
When Natasha and Thor get back from Asgard, Natasha is changed. Her movements have always been fluid, like a cat's, and economical, like a well-trained assassin's. She is what she is, after all, even if, in the later years, Steve has tended to forget that about her. She seems, however, to have gained a new kind of vigor on her trip, something resembling a belief that she can grab the world and change it, and it will stay changed. It might be the fact that the Avengers –
"You're not in trouble," he said quickly, understanding, and observed a tiny softening around Stark's eyes. Then he decided to stop looking so closely. It was a bad idea. "I was actually wondering if you'd be willing to do an impromptu presentation?" he said. And then: "You don't have to," he added. "But you seem to have a pretty good grasp of the subject, and you know how to explain it in simple terms too."
With a few quick strokes, Steve sketched a picture of a viper on his instruction board. "Who can tell me why vipers are shaped like this?" he asked with an inner sigh.
“It’s a cartoon,” Tony soldiered on, desperately aware of how good and solid Steve’s arms felt around him. “It’s called
"Shit, Steve, you okay?" Tony grabs him and pulls him up, props him up, gazes into his face. Steve wants to stay like that. Another eternal moment, but this one of his own choosing...
"You think you are ready?"
Tony: I guess.
"Never better, thanks for asking," Tony said, shivering, his head pounding worse than ever. Wasn't cold air supposed to make hangovers better? By freezing your whole face off, he suspected. "What are you doing out there?" In this weather, he didn't add.
She'd been by his side nearly every day for the past twenty years. "Steve, it's incredible. You were sent to us like a..." She trails off, probably not wanting to sound corny.
I blinked. "Tony?"
Tony: Up until two minutes ago, I was lying here, figuring if I should call you or not.
"He's... coming with his group," he said, as calmly as he could, although he thought his voice might have gone a little feeble.
"There, huh," Tony says, although Steve isn't paying much attention, really. In his head he can almost hear how Tony would say it in his own voice, self-satisfied and slightly amused. But as it is, it sounds just as mechanical and monotonous as everything else.
Tony: I'm SO looking forward to that.
"Yeah," Steve said. "Of course."
"You did that for me," Steve said in wonder. "I mean, you thought I—you knew I—"
I wanted to know where our timelines diverged. And why. It may have been a matter of philosophy, like he said, but for me it was a burning personal question, even though I couldn't really say it was entirely rational. It was as if, if I could find out how long time ago it happened, I could gauge whether his Steve was really like me; whether this Tony was essentially the same Tony that died on me two weeks before.
that worth creating yet another timeline, just to get that off my chest? It
Tony: I can barely keep my eyes open but the mind's racing 100 mph.
"Tony?" Steve is looking at him expectantly. Still not moving, still not bridging that gap between them. Tony needs Steve to take him in his arms, inexorably, like last night, with Steve's hands all over him, with Steve's body solid against him. Steve doesn't. And Tony can't speak.
"Okay, if you have to."
"I don't, but I do believe in nosy, meddling sorcerers, I suppose."
Tony: Did you know that, in Russia, apple jack is actually a moniker for a type of apple vodka?
Tony: there's always something, even if you're not aware of it right now.
Tony:  No, I'm totally okay.
"You've changed the common area, though," Steve commented, trying for off-handedness and failing so spectacularly Tony wanted to record it and have it as his ringtone.
Tony had asked in another dream, and Steve had shaken his head.
of the hole she left when she went her own way, and it hurts, but even if the two of you can't figure things out, you are fond of that hole and that hurt she left behind because they tell you she's once been there, and that means to you more than you can say.
realization
Tony: sleep tight, Steve
approve of Steve. And while Tony would normally find this thought a point of huge annoyance, here, in this place, where his childhood memories came to die, it was strangely comforting.
he heard in his head.
Steve shrugs, utterly unapologetic, which is okay, since Tony did no better. "I actually thought they were very nice. Didn't you? We should invite the receptionist and your new dentist friend for drinks later."
"What happened?" he managed, looking at Tony, at Steve.
Tony."
"Can I put this in the trunk?" the guy asked, raising his backpack with one hand.
Slowly, using just his fingertips, Tony spread the gel all over the burn area in small, rhythmic circles. The gel was cool against his skin. Steve's arm was, by contrast, like a hot stove. As Tony worked to cover the injured forearm with the thick, viscous gel, Steve closed his eyes for a second, his eyelids fluttering. Tony
"Let me introduce you to everyone," he said loudly when he and Bruce walked in. The room was rather packed, and the booze was what you could covertly ferment behind the engines, so bringing a doctor here wasn't such an insane idea, actually. They should have had one on retainer. "Bruce, these are... mainly Dales and Gales. On second thought, don't even bother memorizing the names. Everyone, this is Bruce Banner, whom you already know from your physicals." Tony put a proprietary hand on Bruce's shoulder.
"What, like go to Vegas?" he said skeptically. "Also," he added with a tiny drop of acid in his voice, "I thought you didn't believe in institutions."
Tony: But I'm bored.
," he said sweetly, creamily. "You know my door is always open." The mildly perplexed frown on Steve's face. Ground, well prepared. Ready to slide the blade in. "Friday, check if I have an opening in the next, oh, two weeks or so." He tapped his watch, unnecessarily.
Something pierced Tony’s midsection. An acute awareness that he’d fucked up, although he couldn’t quite understand how or why. It was a sickly feeling and Tony hated it. “I remember now,” he said gently. “
Tony: Poor little Nazis, stuck in toilet cubicles for hours.
, he mused. He paused for a second. "I can't talk tonight, Cap."
The smoke had thickened, but due to the curve in the corridor, Steve could see no flames in front of him. He decided to listen to his own advice for once and tackled another big pile of rubble in front of him. This one was especially tricky, and when he was done, he was sweating heavily. He sprinted forth.
Steve knew Tony vented frustration through sex; he'd told Steve that years ago, when they'd touched upon it in a conversation. Steve should accept this for what it was, he knew that.
Steve could ask, and Tony might answer,
"He was going to shoot Stark," Steve told Coulson, almost off-handedly, as he got to his feet dusting himself off. And that was Steve for you, one minute he was shouting calls to justice and insurgence, all passion and fire, the next minute he was cool as if nothing out of the ordinary was happening at all.
part of Tony that wanted to say:
"So," I said, deciding to go back to what we'd been talking about. "I actually only saw her twice – once when we went to see Tony about time-travel, and then at the... funeral." A part of me was disbelieving all this, because here I was, talking to Tony about his own funeral, more or less. "Morgan's got Pepper and Happy and Rhodey and Peter." All more adequate choices than me. "And I..." I was too broken hearted to pretend I had a life I still wanted to live in that time. I wouldn't have been much use to anyone.
he'd thought, too tired to work up a strength for flipping a bird in the general direction of Cap's office. After that he crashed and slept like he hadn't slept in ages.
The hours listed are Tony's time, btw (I thought that was clear, but maybe not).
"My things," I said, following my own line of thought. "Did some of them survive the battle or was everything at the compound totaled?"
"What the fuck was that, Rogers?"
No. That's excessive. Tony may be a bit of a stalker, at heart, but not
Seamlessly, Tony and I slipped into living together. I did ask him if he wanted me to find a place of my own, but we both knew the question was half-hearted. I really didn't want to be away from him. I know I clung to his presence for comfort, and I was aware that at that point it had more to do with grief than with love. Still, it was in concord with what I thought we both needed – to spend time together and see where it would take us. Tony was quite enthusiastic about the prospect himself. He was a bit more vocal about his emotions than my Tony had been – but, then again, even my Tony had been slanting that way towards the end. He'd told me things I couldn't imagine him saying aloud back in 2013 or 2014. Maybe the too many years we'd been apart had allowed him to change. I still beat myself up for not being there to see it happen.
Tony could be very good at The Game. Granted, he  was usually too impatient and rash to bother with it; but now, somehow, it practically played itself. He wasn't sure how he even got into it. He wasn't sure what he was hoping to achieve. But every encounter, every exchange between him and the Captain became his playground. The way they apparently didn't know how to talk to each other, things had to stay nonverbal most of the time, but perhaps that made The Game even more interesting. Tony would look up into Cap's eyes through his eyelashes, then down, instantly down. He'd bite his lower lip thoughtfully; hold it between his teeth for a moment, then release it. He'd let a tiniest of smiles play upon his lips – sometimes a dry smirk, and sometimes something playful and way more personal.
There are some things you can do if you try hard enough, if you are brave and stubborn and unwilling to give up, and he's done a lion's share over the years; and then there are some things that are undoable. He can't leave Tony's side. There's nothing more to it. He can't.
Tony: ...
Because it
Tony: Didn't you have a good time, though? You said you laughed a lot.
"I think I'm here to stay."
First impressions weren't so important, though, were they? Tony could handle a flyer craft like a dream. He'd done his share of flying under bridges and slipping through canyons sideways and racing up and down the cliffs on Gamenon, and all the other stunts no one in their right mind would try. Rich and bored, newspapers had dubbed him, but although he'd grin brilliantly, and nod, and
Still: "You worry about your own task," Steve replied, trying to bat off a tiny worm of warmth in his heart because – was that concern? Was Tony worried about him? He shook off the thought. There was a job to be done.
were over.
"Change my mind?"
Tony: You just had to notice the damn dates, did you?
Tony: You are thinking 'you and your stupid jokes' right now, aren't you?
In the country, also, it was so easy to get lost. And Steve was a natural. He was a city boy. To him, all trees and hedges and fields looked exactly alike, and one wrong turn lead inevitably to another; every stream was, well,
Tony: maybe
Across the room, that had been slowly filling for the past half hour, his eyes met Tony's. Snapping together, like two poles of a magnet. Steve felt his heart falter for a moment, unsure whether to stop or to start beating faster. Suddenly it was all too much. He remembered this one conversation with Tony, years ago, when they'd stayed up late at night, drinking very black coffee, in that short, happy time they had all stayed in the Tower together. Steve sometimes wondered if that time ever happened. It felt incredibly short, while it lasted. But now, looking back, it seemed to stretch indefinitely, like memories of childhood: every evening was like a year, every sentence seemed to bear significance.
Steve squeezed his hand. He
Avengers, the original Avengers – are together again, a family again. And they are, it took time but they are. Or it might be the fact that, one snap of big green fingers later, the world is made whole again, if for a minute. But it's not just that. Tony asks, but she refuses to acknowledge anything. Steve just observes. She reminds him of himself, once Erskine was done with him and it suddenly felt like he had the means of doing what he thought he was meant to, in the world.
. I'm leaving the planet first thing tomorrow, who can I tell?" He grinned. "Except half the galaxy, of course."
"Natasha, remind me again how old we are."
From the corner of his eye, he saw Steve frown at him. One leg up on the armrest of the couch, he was standing there in his stupid undersuit, holding his coffee cup with both hands like something precious. Allied with a slanting ray of sunlight through the window, he was making the couch look disproportionately small and shabby by comparison. He caught Tony’s eye in the process of looking away, raised both eyebrows at him. “But I thought...” he began, and then stopped. Took a deep breath. “All right,” he conceded eventually, composing himself.
Steve and his stupid attitude, and then because the man had grown on him, and he
Tony: I keep lashing out at you
I removed my hands from his shoulders, but I still kept them close, just in case. "Sorry," I said automatically, a tad devastated at his reaction. He stopped, then, passed a hand over his face. "
I watched a stray flicker from a streetlight toy with his hair for a moment because I liked fiddling with concepts like light and shadow and because it's been years since I'd had the luxury to let myself get distracted by Tony's hair.
shot through his mind. But it wasn't, it couldn't be...
"So, you went with burgundy, then?" Steve asked with a small smile, and it brought Tony back to reality. He snatched his hand back, because he knew he'd been holding on Steve's for too long. It must have been awkward for Steve. The thought of discovery was mortifying.
Tony: Look, please don't wish you didn't exist. I know that feeling. So well. But there's always something.
How can you not know these things?"
. I've waited for years to discover something worthy of the name 'Stark effect'. You can't possibly take it!"
, Steve said last night, out of the blue, just like that. At which point Tony practically threw him out of the room.
And now this.
"I'll come."
"Hey," he said, half expecting Cap to jump, but then, all of a sudden, it seemed to him the guy had known all along that Tony was there. And didn't even acknowledge him. Well, that should be a clue enough for anyone. Tony adopted an even more cheerful, unconcerned tone of voice, because, of course, Steve's indifference meant nothing to him. "I'll be in the simulator, okay? You guys take your time." Without an obvious reason, his heart palpitated in his ears. It was difficult to tear his gaze away from Steve's profile, as he bent down over Quint's notebook. Walking so close past him, in order to get to the simulator, suddenly seemed like an impossible task. Tony kept his breathing calm, kept his mask of nonchalance on. It was a relief he didn't wear his heart on his sleeve, but it did nothing to make this any easier on the
Tony showed him his own ratty paperback. "Books. Wanna trade?"
Desperately, Tony cast about for something to divert attention.
Tony: I kind of have to go now, but it's not an emergency or anything. So talk to you later. Cool?
Natasha found him like that. She was a ghost of a hand on his shoulder, a strangely sharp hiss in his ear. "Got an eyeful?" He had enough presence of mind not to jump. He just turned towards her with what he imagined to be a small self-deprecating smile and shrugged.
STARK: [looking at the audience, frowning for a moment] Kostolitz?
Tony had pretty much considered himself a kid all the way into his early thirties. Until Afghanistan. Steve never did, ever since Tony met him. He’d been 26 at the time. Bore himself like someone with experience enough  for two lifetimes. Yep, torture and war made you grow up wonderfully fast.
"Oh, so you
Things were happening relatively fast as Tony sat there, musing. Soon enough, Steve sent the girl home with a stern talking to and a slice of pie. He was, Tony reflected, completely and utterly unbelievable.
Tony: You've no idea.
to play cards." The irritability in his voice sounded almost childish. The fact that Steve found it equal parts annoying and endearing worried him slightly. He lingered for a second longer, fighting disappointment, but since he couldn't think of anything else to say, he turned to go. "I'll be in the next room if you need anything," he murmured.

Tony: No, not really.
As Coulson and the others rounded up Fisk and his cronies, Fury strode over.
Tony: At all.
Tony: Vile stuff.
"No," Tony says coldly. Despite his tone, a part of Steve is
He grunted in response and pushed harder, straining his back muscles. The weight of the viper was crushing him. Under the helmet, itchy streamlets of sweat were coursing down his temples. And then Darryl was pulling the man out.
"Are you
trying to put a positive spin on things.
When it's finally their turn to check-in, they produce their IDs. With that beard and those glasses, Steve can actually – sort of – pass for a Stephán, but Tony is honestly going to murder Fury on account of his own ID. Stephán Deleon and Tino Stirling. Dentists extraordinaire.
He swallowed. No.
As Tony always knew they would be, the emotions were too much and he could barely handle them.
; it's all Steve is able to think, to feel, because it was almost
Time was slipping away, and Steve knew he had to do something, but he was frozen in place. So many years had been leading up to this point. For so many years he'd been trying to turn himself to stone, and now he was supposed to turn himself back, all at once, to feel what he had been trying not to feel, to hope when he had been doing his best to extinguish all hope.
"Stark?"
Darryl being Darryl, he did seem tired but not overly perturbed. He clapped his hands twice, but since people (being people) didn't exactly fall silent, he just started speaking, briefing anyone nearby as to what was going on, giving terse instructions. He sounded mildly dejected, of all things, and spoke in his typical monotone.
Tony considered. "What'd he say?"
Tony opened his mouth to reply; reconsidered. "You know what," he admitted then, "I've honestly no idea. I didn't pay much attention."
Tony knew exactly what Natasha was talking about.
"I was tracking
too," Tony muttered. "If I had reception, I could download it."
"I'm fine," Steve says stubbornly.
Tony seems to be reading his mind. "I wish you could see yourself right now," he murmurs at Steve. "If we had a mirror, I'd make you look at yourself."
"Oh, the awkward conversation, yay. I'd hoped we could kind of skip that."
weak?" Tony pressed on. "Like, pre-serum weak? Normal person weak?"
Steve is standing still, like a figure chiseled in stone. Water is coursing down his face. Tony could believe he could go on standing like that for generations, enduring weather. Maybe he's really turned to stone? "So... where does that leave us?" Steve asks. He's not moving one inch closer to Tony.
Clint mock-flinched. "Harsh."
"All these years that we haven't been talking," he said slowly, looking somewhere to the left of Steve head, "I kept hearing your voice in my head, Steve. Judging. Criticizing me. For everything."
“You’re having a meltdown?”
The room is sealed, by magic or an alien technology Tony cannot fathom, at least not from the inside. There are no windows, no vents, no secret passages that they can find. If Tony had his suit on, maybe he could, but it malfunctioned earlier and he had to leave it behind. The walls are solid, the door unbreakable. They try repeatedly, but the truth is, they are stranded inside.
Tony is strangely detached from his words. Love confessions shouldn't be like this. They should be all hearts and sunflowers and chocolate strawberries and things. Or they should be heartbreaking and tragic. Not this... prosaic. But he's analyzed and overanalyzed his feelings for Steve, back and forth, over the years, he's dissected them too often, and maybe at some point he forgot to put them back together.
"It's a slippery slope?"
"Eat shit, Tony," I tell him very lovingly.
Tony: I don’t want to be smart about this. Everyone gets to be silly about things like this. I hate smart.
Tony: You weren't ranting. Stop.
you here, exactly, by the way?" All of a sudden, it seemed like the most pressing question in the world. "Steve?" he demanded. "No, wait." He jumped up. Beckoned. "You can tell me on the way."
Tony: So who IS the front line? Lang is infiltration, I guess, and Clint and Wilson are support.
"So, Thor talked my ear off tonight."
Sam shot him a sharp look. "Are you sure you're not miscalculating
"You let me stew in my own juices for five years?" I looked up at him, hearing his tone. His smile was wry, self-deprecating. "I let you stew in
he thought, as he bent lower and softly touched his lips to Steve's right shoulder blade, lingering for too long. This was hard. It was so hard  he thought he'd just die on the spot, and what walked out would be an empty shell.
Tony: I mean, who, Carter? Fury?
Tony: At best.
I shook my head. "Just you. If I had anything on the subject, I'd have told you already."
"The arm," he said. "All right, Cap?" His voice was all business, now – with an effort. But when Steve extended his forearm, Tony took it in a gentlest of grips, his fingers wrapped about Steve's wrist, his thumb resting lightly on the spot where Steve's pulse danced to a steady beat.
Needlessly, Tony glances down. His erection is very obvious in his jeans.
Which was when Tony realized he was lying on top of Steve, whose arms were still wrapped around his waist; their faces were so close that the mist of their breath mixed and combined in the icy air. Which was
Tony: And he's positively LIVID I didn't tell him anything and then I talked him into going away.
"Yeah," he echoed with a small smile. "I can believe in nosy, meddling sorcerers no problem."
"Sure, Fido. It's here in the kitchen, by the sink." Tony thought his response sounded half-hearted. To distract himself, he looked around the kitchen, opened the fridge. There was so much
He decided to brave the kitchen and rummaged around the bag he brought, looking for something fitting for breakfast among all the caviar boxes and blue cheese and salmon spreads.
Their king had ended up in the head of an otherworldly Steve (an indigenous Steve in that place, Natasha supposed); and, to make things even more complicated, that
Steve swallowed audibly. Tried again. "This was your first piece of action. You acted bravely..."
For Tony, worry and irritability were almost interchangeable. Maybe he was that way because it was easier to admit to being irritated than worried. "You're kidding," he was saying practically steamrolling over Steve, forgetting about unimportant things like rank or following orders or whatever. This was a crisis, and he was used to dealing with those, whatever their nature. He was used to making decisions. "What are you going to do down there, exactly? You can't fix this. You go see if the folks are all right and all that. Help out the survivors."
Tony: So, I got pulled in for a talking to. Regarding SOMETHING ELSE entirely, like you wouldn't believe. The phone got confiscated for the duration, very politely so. You wouldn't believe the buggage on it when I got it back.
is talking, all right? That’s all I meant, that’s all I want. Not some... whatever you’re thinking. Just...
Hangover hit Tony like a crowbar in the head before he even opened his eyes in the morning. It took him a second to remember he wasn't at home, the feeling was so familiar. He clawed his way to consciousness – and out of bed; splashing his face with icy water helped somewhat. Still, a gimlet – tool, not cocktail – kept boring holes in his stomach as the last night slowly came back to him.
"How did you recognize me?" Steve asked, not hiding his curiosity.
He ignored my question. "You know," he said conversationally, "I kept telling myself it was the only way – your death, I mean. It's a piss poor comfort, but you know... The only way we could save the world. One
(Because it would almost be better to just let Steve go altogether than to have yet another relationship with a failed start after failed start, dragging into infinity. And still he couldn't say no if Steve asked.)
On the ship, Tony banters with Strange. He banters with little Peter. He almost banters with the bad guy.
"Oh, goody. Can you get to The NoMad Hotel? There's a rooftop restaurant."
, but that was the support group talk; out here, in this small cabin away from the world, he felt he somehow had the luxury of
They stared into each other's eyes for a moment.
Tony: And I should have been more alert. But it was all so well concealed. Really deeply so. Without the pointers in Natasha's docs, I don't know when I would've found out. And you know what, it kind of scares the hell out of me.
One night, Tony lay awake, thinking about this. Things were coming clear in his mind, and they made his gut go cold. Embarrassment? No, it was worse than that.
Tony: You're just antsy because you can't do anything from there.
Both Tony and Steve had apologized to each other, via voice messages. Accepted. They proceeded to exchange small, unimportant news this way, on and off. Asked after each other's health. They would fill a few minutes with noise, then hang up.
fine," the medic said dryly. "I still need to inspect them for trauma."
"Yeah?" Tony's voice had also gone soft "So, why didn't you say so?"
I shrugged. "Look, Tony," I said. "I wish I knew what to tell you. I was offered a chance and I jumped on it. I didn't ask too many questions. I should have, I suppose." I shrugged. "Maybe I'm of no consequence any more. Maybe I'm done. Maybe I can't change anything significant any longer..."
, he thought.
Tony nodded. "In the beginning. Or – well, not
"Nuh-huh."
Like in slow motion, he watched Tony's face close up, become the genial mask again, the grin stretching his face. And he turned on his heel, saying something on the lines with "Oh, over there I see some people I actually looked forward to seeing."
Tony: Now.
for them. That's when you get a hand on your cock. Two for prostate, three for cock. Yeah?" Tony shrugs his metallic shoulders. "So let's see if you can come on my fingers alone, or how desperate you really are, because," and he wiggles his three fingers again, gives a cheerful wave, "I don't think even you are crazy enough to try this."

Steve inclined his head and looked up towards him. "I get the feeling you keep expecting me to say something cutting to you," he said mildly.
Still, all this made no sense now that Steve had actually caught up to him, here in the corridor.
gotta check the gravs and the side engines, see where's the problem." This, with more than a hint of strained patience. "There might be a chain reaction. We don't know if the other engineers are in a position to fix it or not. There's no time to...!" Tony was arguing in his best, reasonable voice, because he had a distinct feeling he was about to be sent back to his room without dinner. With both Steve and Thor staring down at him, he was suddenly feeling outnumbered. He felt a bout of inappropriate laughter, a sibling to panic, rise in his chest, but somehow he swallowed it down.
Tony: Even some ceramics and glass sculptures.
"Because you don't have to. You can just say no. No need for explanations. But in case you are genuinely just asking – Fury's people would take care of it. He wouldn't just leave folks to fend for themselves after an intervention like this. But, Steve, if coming along actually seems like..."
Tony: It's a reference to chess. C'mon, Rogers, you've played chess before. I've seen you.
, but it sounded like such a lie he couldn't get it past his lips. For the first time in forever he fervently wished he still had the arc reactor, just to
Steve made a small encouraging noise. They had done this before. Countless times. They would brainstorm on how to resolve a crisis, and if one of them seemed to be onto something, the other would try to help him get there. The familiarity of the rhythm they fell into so easily felt both comforting and a little sore.
A few months back, he'd moved out of the Stark Tower to avoid remembering the time he'd lived there with Pepper. He moved back now because the memories of Pepper and the breakup seemed positively healthy and happy and bright in comparison.
"So, you'll stay?"
Steve stepped into the kitchen, but Tony raised his hand, stopping him. "On second thought, you may actually get dressed if you want, you're beyond distracting this way. There are some clothes Rhodey left lying around over the years. In the cupboard in the living room. They'd be closer to your size than my pants, in any case."
"Now, that's an outright challenge, Richards!"
Then he realized what he was doing, tried – lamely – to pretend he was checking Steve's temperature. He let his hand drop. Steve looked up at him with big, round, very surprised eyes, and Tony cursed himself in his head for being an idiot. He was about to apologize, when Steve suddenly got to his feet, wrapping the blankets around himself  like a robe.
Then it hit me – how tragic it was, then, because they could have had those five years, happy and together, and they didn't.
Tony: And going nuts.
Tony: Thanks for the vote of confidence, I guess, but you know what, the fact that I know how to plaster a smile on my face and flirt with the audience doesn't mean it doesn't make my stomach turn. You gotta dress for the part, and play your part for these people, or they tear you to bits. And if I thought they at least did it out of passion for truth, or out of genuine malice, ANYTHING... But it's just in their job description. It’s their job to turn you into something plastic and two-dimensional. And not really human. And it depresses the shit out of me.
That's more realistic. Tony wouldn't call unless something went wrong, would he? Or perhaps Steve might call.
. Cuddling. Together.  “In summer, though...” And what did it all mean? Was he mistaken, was this a weird friendship thing instead? PTSD buddies unite and all that. Was he just keeping Steve warm? Was Steve just... well, whatever he thought he was doing, taking care of Tony? “Early autumn’s also nice,” he heard himself say and was grateful for his autopilot. “Ever been to Malibu, Cap?” His mind was slanting towards swirly mists again, but he could manage a light conversation.
This was when Steve kissed him. He didn’t mean to. Well, he did, but maybe not just then. Maybe he just wanted to lean his forehead against Tony’s and stay like that. But then his lips were on Tony’s, all salty and soft; Steve would have been content just to leave them there, just to go on feeling Tony’s lips with his own for all eternity. And there was a trickle of doubt, of fear: what if he’d been wrong all along, what if Tony didn’t want this, what if... But Tony opened his mouth, and their tongues met, and Steve could feel hot happiness and doubt course through him like a cocktail. His eyes were closed, but suddenly he felt an arm around his neck, pulling him closer, firmly, demandingly. Then another one, sneaking around his waist; and then he was on top of Tony, feeling his almost naked body under his own, pressing against it, insistent, wanting to touch everything, feel every inch of skin.
"Oh, shit," Tony jumped up. "The cinnamon rolls." He ran over to the oven, saving them at the last moment.
"Time," Steve said slowly, "can be made right. If people want to. If outside factors aren't... actually insurmountable. Like wars and.. and catastrophes. But what is a 'right way' to love someone?"
Tony: You know what, Rogers, fuck this.
Tony: No.
Because he was, he was, it was time he admitted it to himself finally. He was so far gone there was no way back now. Did he want to get into that with Peter Quill, who had just tried to take their casual flirty thing to the next level? Well, not really.
"And my eyes are all sparkly, with, with..."
Tony: You went through all that trouble to find him, just to deep-freeze his ass again?
Steve went very still for a second. And then, without changing visibly, his stance got dangerous. No, not dangerous, exactly, perhaps; not menacing either, he'd probably be incapable of that... Tony didn't know how to describe it, except as
"They just met with the Chief Rabbit," Steve replied. "You can't sleep?"
While he was frantically reviewing his choice of words, Steve interrupted him. "Okay."
And he shivers. And waits.
"No," says Tony firmly and pulls away.
Tony: I can't believe I'm talking to you about this, but I'm actually not so unhappy about it.
"And a plain triple cheese omelet for my super-scientist son, because he doesn’t like cilantro," Tony said indulgently, before taking his place at the breakfast table.
At that moment I figured why I was delaying my departure. This was a decision I didn't know how to make. The needle of my moral compass was spinning uselessly. It didn't feel as if there was a right answer, or even a right question. The direction my heart was leaning towards was something my mind warned me against. Her last words struck resonance with me – maybe just because it suited me to believe what she said. But there was nothing in my present left for me, no unfinished business, no fight left to fight. There would be the aftermath, a lot of work, a lot of things to set right – but what was wrong with the world –
can say. I got to know three different Tonys – and they
"I think we're past that phase," he adds then, and that's another truth. "I think we've moved past friendship into a whole new territory."
"What?" Then Peter's face cleared. "Oh. You've got your radars set on someone else. That's fine."
The next one was even worse. The very same night, well after midnight, when he had finally tumbled into sleep: he was (Steve was?) sitting in a highly modern kitchen, all in metallic grays and earth yellows (weirdly, inexplicably, in his dreams Tony knew names of all these colors).
"Blanket," Tony muttered and grabbed one from the pile next to the gurney. He was about to toss it to Steve, but his hands had a different idea altogether. Before he knew it, he was wrapping it around Steve's shoulders, ever so gently, taking care not to touch the cloth to the injured forearm..
"Uh," Tony began, fighting all the while for his lips not to twitch into a probably-inappropriate smirk. "About last night. I'm...", he felt his lips stretch into a grin out of pure tension – and gave up. Suddenly he wondered why he cared this much, why he was being so anxious. He'd dealt with a lot worse in his time. With men much more powerful. Men who held fate of whole colonies in their hands. Tony'd be able to stare them down without a blink.
to make contact?" he was saying, and at that very moment, Tony was going through the motions of "Steve, meet Nick Fury, I told you about him," and "Fury, this is sheriff Steve Rogers," and, simultaneously, Steve was saying "Where exactly are they taking them, Tony? Where are they
Steve peered inside. He'd heard the guy finish his phone call as if nothing out of the ordinary was happening, and then – thanks to his night vision – he found himself face to face with Tony Stark.
Near the beginning  of the mutual-ignoring-fest, Natasha had cornered him and asked, so casually Tony thought she might explode with off-handedness:
Tony: What's going on there? Don't give me any details you aren't comfortable with, but in general terms.
Tony: You are going to be giving me shit about that ‘almost’ forever, aren’t you?
He waited. And then, when from the corner of his eye he thought he saw Rogers looking, Tony turned, quick as lightning, and met the man's eyes head on. Like a clamp snapping shut. For a moment they stayed like that – it was seconds; it was days. Then Cap tore his gaze away, almost forcibly.
Tony: I thought someone might tell you, that we had a fling that one time. Or you might see the gossip somewhere, they tend to dig the dirt up in situations of this type. So I thought you should probably hear it from me.
, I thought to myself, and felt a bit better. His warm body against mine was reassuring, the muscles of his back against my stomach an anchor to reality.
Tony: You won't.
“I feel perfectly fine.” Tony did try to sound conciliatory. The irritation was just an automatic reaction to someone telling him what to do. “I’m not coughing at all. I haven’t even sneezed once.”
Tony: Steve?
"I don't think we have time for this," Steve says matter-of-factly. He doesn't sound particularly hurried, though.
And Peter got hold of Tony's hand and pulled him in – not really, but a little bit, so that they were standing closer to each other, the earphone cord pulling them together; and than even closer than that. And Peter started moving, urging Tony to do the same.
"When we're touching, I feel you much stronger." Steve paused. "I never knew you hurt this much."
. He could almost hear his bones creak, but the thing was actually moving.
A peculiar hunger in his soul won over the feelings of propriety and guilt. Sneaking around like a thief, he opened the armoire; took a peak inside all the desk drawers, one by one. Looked through the few toys in the basket under the bed. In the end he stopped in front of the bookshelf, and ran a finger along rows upon rows of kids' books, interspersed with some textbooks and manuals. Reading the spines. This time around, absorbing every word.
"Yeah, like that," Steve replied with a wry smile.
"And you, what –  you thought it would be a great idea to just walk up to me in Central Park, just like that, and give me a heart attack?"
," Tony said with a slight emphasis, as if Steve had hovered there staring into his eyes for too long. (Tony's eyes had first been afire, then they turned into small puddles of sadness, but now they seemed refocused, lively once more.), "what I
Really, why would he? He was supposed to be the experienced one. I, not so much. I'd had just a few partners in my life, but mostly I was just fumbling around blindly. And he'd slept with Steve, his Steve, so this wasn't really a completely new territory for him, while I could approach the Tony from my timeline only in my dreams.
, Tony thought,
"But I don't want you to shut up," Steve said very gently.
Tony: Computer stuff.
Then something changed – like a barrel of cold water poured right over your head. It was barely perceptible; it was huge as a mountain. Steve seemed to come to his senses. He didn't even move. It was just his eyes suddenly becoming sober – then distant – then sharp as volcanic glass.
Someone was robbing the diner, and Steve was going to intervene, for sure, and somehow, somehow, a bullet would find its way and Steve would die the stupidest of all stupid deaths, because that was how these things happened, that was just Tony's luck, and Tony simply couldn't live with the possibility.
Even later, they are making a plan of action. Morgan is with Pepper and Dog is with Happy, in case something happens to them. They are
Tony regarded him for a moment, started to say something, then changed his mind.
“Oh, I want to, trust me,” Steve said in a controlled, frustrated whisper. He sounded like he was near bursting. And he ran the fingers of his free hand lightly over Tony’s thigh, up and down, teasing, soothing, then up to his stomach, dancing up and down Tony’s cock as he pumped his finger in and out. Tony closed his eyes again.
he were single? None whatsoever, really.
The truth is, we fucked up. The intel we had, it was a setup. It was a trap, we think. We now think it was all a diversion, to set us up and to avert the eyes of the public from what was going on at the tech expo, which was where a newly acquired batch of supersoldier serum was supposed to exchange hands. At a secret auction. We... no, we don't have any proof. We think more than one government were interested in buying. We don't have real proof of that either, we would love to share it with you, but we don't have it. Just what we saw. You can believe it if you want.
to quit thinking about how gentle and nice that kiss was, despite everything.
Tony: Steve, I'll never be a fan. But I do think it's wrong to use people like machines.  And I know he's very important to you. It must be terrible to almost get a friend back, and then not. After so many years. It must be so lonely. So, I'm sorry.
Of course, of all the stupid ways to open that discussion, his mouth chose to start at the ass end of things. What he meant to say was something in the vein of: You know that on-and-off thing I think you have with Peter Quill – well, would you ever be willing to try something like that with
Tony: no
Tony: That's all legit.
Tony: Because hurling oneself into the Sun is so last year.
, Steve expected to hear. Or
Tony: Also, I'm really sorry for being an asshole to you on Monday. AGAIN. AND for not talking to you.
Tony: Well, you certainly can't be Heathcliff in this duo.
Steve swallowed. "We could play cards or something," he managed finally. "If you want. You could be lying down," he added.
It was... hurtful? Welcome? Both?
As Tony linked arms with his king, nominally to support him as he walked, and as they went to inspect the watches the way they always did, something clicked for her. Natasha smiled to herself.
Tony: Maybe.
, though.”
He's kind of surprised to hear his own voice. It was just a thought, but apparently it's decided to come into the open. Well. He isn't even sorry. It's not as if Steve didn't figure out how Tony felt about him as soon as Tony touched him last night, pretty much. He figured it out even before Tony himself did.
Tony: Jesus, Rogers, you should find someone who isn't a total asshole to talk to.
, Tony had spit out then, vicious, bitter, and all of 13 at the time. He got a slap across the mouth for his troubles – not hard, but it was the act that counted, not the muscle behind it. He could see Howard believed him, because he stopped asking. He just ranted. And what Tony had told him hadn't even been the truth. He wasn't sure what the truth had been.)
Tony: exactly!!!!
Tony: I have a few ideas.
Tony had a lot of mixed feelings regarding the man, but definitely not
The slope was intimidating. Yet, the trickle of fear was heady, and the vertigo-inducing incline was like an insistent itch before him, burning to be scratched, no matter what the price.
Tony: or in art books, which is probably more your style
sorry, dear," the receptionist says regretfully. "We do have one, and no one ever wants it – it's a bit pricey, you see – but it
Steve's eyes popped open and he gave Tony a long, earnest look, far more alert that Tony would have given him credit for. "No, Tony, it's all right.  It's... Oh
Tony: Yeah, it does feel like that, doesn't it?
Tony took a deep breath. "Say it."
Tony: I just woke up from a dream that Natasha was my sister and that I was trying to strangle her.
This was all shades and colors of not-good-at-all. Especially the thuds. The flooring between the decks was so thick and well insulated that normally you couldn't hear anything from the deck above/below you. The thuds meant something bad. Something bad and big and hard, like a piece of engine, like a huge crate, like a small flyer craft. Falling. Bouncing around.
"You kissed
Tony: I'll say it again: Oh, man.
"I'm gonna be all right," Steve said quickly. And even thought his eyelids were droopy and he seemed to barely be following Tony's words, he was himself enough to claim Tony needn't worry about him.
It wasn't even that Steve was naked. Tony had been with naked people plenty in his life, in non-sexual or only semi-sexual situations, in assorted hot tubs at parties etc. It was more about the fact that this was
Tony wasn’t checking him out, he really wasn’t. Just a moment of aesthetic appreciation, he told himself as he looked away. One single glance along his upper arm, along the biceps emphasized by the tight undershirt that Steve – unfairly – wore. It was difficult not to be appreciative of Steve’s looks. So, since the early days, Tony consciously didn’t indulge in looking. At first, because he didn’t
"Wait...
"Okay, go," he called out. Crazy excitement beat in his ears like a bass drum. A muffled thud. Another one. Apart from the sounds, there was no apparent result. Well, it would be ridiculous, wouldn't it, he thought, taking his hope by the throat, casting it on the ground and trampling on it. This wasn't happening anyway. He was losing his mind, that's what this was. Did Steve have to come to him like this, to torment him with false hopes and fake glimpsed lights at ends of tunnels?
Hope breathed out. "Okay then. You in contact with Tony right now, sir? Tell him to try and bring the wall sprinkler systems back online as soon as it makes sense to do so. It's not of the highest priority, but it would help a lot."
They dozed off not long after, in each other’s arms, in a cocoon of warmth and safety that was better left unquestioned for now, like they wouldn’t have believed possible 24 hours before.
," he muttered, not quite to himself.
Tony: There's also all kinds of talking cures.
Tony: Steve.
"Nice to meet you," Steve responded automatically, then hesitated a second. But it seemed the decision was already made. If he were going to say
in your universe?" There was, of all things, a note of semi-amused incredulity in his voice.
"You all right?" he repeated, but with less insistence. Backing off now. "Anything broken and all that, can you tell?" He realized he was modeling his tone of voice after Steve's and felt mildly embarrassed, then promptly forgot all about it. Steve squeezed his shoulder in reassurance, once, then let go.
"You seem off."
aware – that he was naked underneath the blanket. Steve was doing it on purpose. He
First, his tiny, measly bout of panic. And then the surge of perfect feelings when Steve finally,
Tony: Worried? I literally almost bit my own finger off. But I rationally know it will be okay.
He still didn't return the sweater.
"You angry at him? For drawing you like that?"
Cap was standing over Quentin Quint, his head inclined, a patient half-smile on his lips. He seemed a tad distracted.
Tony was silent for a long time – so long, in fact, that I thought he wasn't going to answer me at all. That was fine. I knew I was prying.
"No?" I say. I could never really understand Tony and Pepper as a couple. Still, for the sake of the first Tony I loved, and later for the sake of his Pepper I've come to know a little bit, I have tried to feel respect for their relationship, even deep inside my own head, where I question everything.
"Wait," Steve said. "I'm going to send you help. They'll bring the parts. The way is clear now. I'll try to lend a hand here."
The sitting down, however – it was easier said then done. His balance was all screwy, as he tried not to put weight on the foot. In the end he gave up, put a hand on Steve's shoulder and lowered himself onto a large piece of rubble. Well, another side benefit of all this was that at least he now had something to sit on.
And then he saw Steve. He was sitting on a gurney. Actually, he  was apparently trying to get up. A medic was getting into his face, repeatedly poking a stern finger at his chest. Tony couldn't make out the words, but it was pretty clear the medic wasn't done with Steve and Steve did his polite best to disagree with her assessment.
"Can I help?"
"Fifteen
it," she said without batting an eyelash. "You can feel it in the way he stumbles around in the morning, cursing at himself, saying
"Hey, Romanoff," I say. I want to laugh, but the tears don't seem to let me. I've become that old man that always cries. "Please don't stab me?"
Tony was trying not to run. It wasn't working.
And was Tony saying what Steve thought what he was saying, or was all of this a big delusion Steve had concocted in his head.
"I never even stopped to think, Tony," he said, addressing the other man even though he felt like he was telling this to himself. It only now hit him how little control he'd had over his actions. That was sobering.
something, anything that would fill the said emptiness. Like it happened with Steve – another rogue thought, he pushed it away, didn't know what to do with it. With Peter it was just... fun.
Tony reached up, rubbed his eyes with one hand. Kept at it for a few seconds. It seemed to Steve he'd never look up, but eventually he did. "You didn't think it
It was still very early for us and there were many things we hadn't told each other yet. And, when it was about Tony, my curiosity tended to win over my tact. "Did you often sit like this with your Steve?" I asked before I gave it much thought.
Tony: You mean, if the people are mostly decent, and won’t physically betray you and such, it’s easier to be friends when you are desperately fighting a common enemy. You have a common cause. Nothing disputable there.
Tony pulled his sock back on. His head was reeling. It was all too much. Days – who knew how many – of nothing but darkness and resignation, and then all these feelings, simultaneously tearing through his insides.  "Cap, are you
Tony half-nodded in his direction as he slowed down a bit on a particularly tricky section of the road. "Go ahead," he said, almost a challenge.
Tony pulls his fingers out, then, adjusts the angle, and slams them back in, almost cruelly, straight into Steve's sweet spot, and the bright pain and overwhelming pleasure are so mixed, so confusing, so
Tony: It makes your memories hurt less.
They wolfed down the food she generously refused to take any money for (Tony stashed a huge tip under the menu, though). Tony's hand wasn't close to his any more. He carefully hid it on his lap. Steve understood. He stepped back and didn't push, but he didn't have the energy for small talk either. They were largely silent, back in their own, individual glass cages. Just strangers that had met on the road. Steve's chest felt empty, but hey, that was the usual state of affairs anyway.
This was becoming very uncomfortable very rapidly, and when the medic seemed to zero in on Tony, as if seeing him for the first time, he almost welcomed it.
we do it. And yeah, we are going to survive."
"I can hear them," Steve said. "They're going from door to door, but they're still far away."
Tony: It's just... I don't really know how to react when you tell me something like that.
They were standing on the porch, and the moments were ticking by, and Tony was looking at Steve, and Steve was looking at Tony. The night was dry and starry and nearly bright, and the cicadas seemed louder and louder with every moment the two of them kept silent.
He pinched the bridge of his nose, took a deep breath. "Can you just... Look, just tell me next time, whatever it is, just fucking tell me, okay? Just assume I... just
The other techs didn't take the news as well as Darryl, though. One woman buried her mask-covered face into her hands. One man – Steve recognized him as Dale – covered his mouth with both his hands trying – unsuccessfully – to mute a loud whimper that escaped from his lips.
Some days we quarrel so much I don't even know why he tolerates me around. Still, he starts tinkering with things he thinks I'd like, so I know he's happy I'm here, even if it doesn't always look like it.
