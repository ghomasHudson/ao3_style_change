"I'm taking
"No, it's— it's not terrible," Tony murmured, even though it was a little. "The concentration of the drug in your blood
Tony shivered. He slipped the satin robe on, tying the belt loosely at his waist and feeling the hem swish at his waist. Everything felt hypersensitive, from his chest to his cock to his toes, the way the lace scratched at his groin and ass and thighs, the nylon hugging his calves, the soft flutter of the robe as he paced from one end of the room to the other.
"Well… yeah," Steve said, coloring a bit, but there was a wry grin tugging at his lips, and Tony just had to slither back up Steve's body so he could press a warm, wet kiss to them.
"Yeah, big guy?" Steve grinned, brushed a hand through Tony's hair. "You like the sound of that? You want me to just keep..." Steve reached out, slid his hand down Tony's front, over his stomach, "...filling you up. Keeping you full a' me." Tony shuddered under the touch of him, how Steve's palm felt, warm and slightly sweaty. His stomach felt- softer, than normal, distended, like he really was full of Steve, like Steve was changing his shape from the inside, like Steve could change him irreparably, just from being there.
"There's also a bottle of gin on my jet," Tony said haughtily once he'd caught up to Steve.
Steve grinned, a bit shyly. "When you‒ when you used it on me," he said, voice low and just a little rough, "you were watching me, but you‒ you were also watching
They checked his blood every four hours. There'd been a sharp dip on the third day, but for the most part the drop in the drug's concentration was slow, and agonizingly steady. Tony sighed, pressed his forehead to his knees, grabbing his phone from the bedside table. Steve was actually sleeping for the moment, not dozing or unconscious from delirium or pain, so Tony let himself run a hand through the man's hair, smiling sweetly down at Steve as he thumbed open the lockscreen to call Not-Jarvis.
"Tony," he eventually said, raising one bloody hand.
"You misunderstand me," Thor murmured, finishing off his drink and setting it to the side. He looked up at Tony with wide, earnest blue eyes, like he could fucking see every sick, twisted thought in his head (and he was a god, so who knew? Maybe he actually could). "It is never 'just sex' with you, Tony," Thor said then, his hands clasped together on the table, his arms bunching as if he was holding himself back from doing something sentimental like reaching out and hugging Tony or some other such nonsense.
, he thought to himself, albeit grimly. He swallowed him down a few more times, sucking as he slid the hot, heavy weight of him in his mouth, and caressing the shaft of Steve's dick with his tongue when he pulled up. "Does that feel good, champ?" Tony murmured, flicking his eyes up so he could look under his lashes up at Steve. "Are you gettin' what you need?"
Steve gasped, couldn't help but fuck himself into Tony's strong, secure grip, the sounds of his wet neediness slickly squelching between them. Tony smiled, flashing a bit of teeth as he sucked on his lower lip, his attention rapt on Steve and the barely-there moans he kept making. When he saw Tony's own cock, hard and bobbing and leaking, Steve's eyes snapped shut and he threw an arm over his eyes, shuddering down to his toes. It felt— incredible, God Almighty, it felt too much already, like he was seconds away from coming, his limbs trembling viciously as he bit down on his forearm and tried to keep from spilling his load all over Tony when they'd barely even started.
sliding over his ass.
"Oh, that's what I like to hear," Steve whispered; he gave Tony a soft kiss, so sweet and gentle against his sweaty temple. "Let me check on your cute little rear." Steve sat up then, fingers circling around the rim of his ass where the dildo was fucking into him. "You're still pretty wet," he murmured, massaging the (god, it wasn't tight anymore, was it? He was loose; he felt so, so loose) ring of muscle there, "but I suppose a little more wouldn't hurt." More lube, cool and slippery, dripped down his ass, his crack, and Tony could feel Steve ever so gently coating the dildo on every withdrawal, how it made Tony feel even wetter, even sloppier inside.
Tony pinched his inner thigh, hard, and Steve swore loudly, just barely keeping his hand from flying out to smack Tony in the face. When Steve looked at him, his eyes were glittering, an unrepentant grin on his face. "You looked like you needed a hand," he teased, and Steve snorted, let his head drop back down to the sheets with a sigh. Tony's smile softened. "Need a break, handsome?"
"Right‒ right back at you, pumpkin," Tony managed, rocking back again, pleased when all he felt was a soft burn, like a good warm-up stretch before a workout. "Oh, oh,
Steve sighed, made a small noise in the back of his throat. At the next kiss he melted, his lips softening under Tony's touch, his spine bowing to maintain contact as Tony crawled into his lap. Tony's tongue was rough in his mouth, sure but not demanding, had the faintest tang of liquor underneath the sharp mint of his toothpaste. Tony hooked a finger in Steve's shirt collar, hummed into his mouth, kept sucking on Steve's tongue until he was dizzy, panting with need. "Tony," he moaned. "
"Just like that, Shellhead," Steve praised. "You good to get cuffed in?"
"Good, that's good," Steve whispered, rubbing one large hand across Tony's flank. Anal sex was always… overwhelming for Tony in a way, and it was a damn shame they didn't do this as often as he wanted because Tony
Steve flinched, rolled his hips where Tony had him pinned. Suddenly the ceiling was a lot more interesting to the super soldier, and he clenched his hands into fists, the one in Tony's hair just the wrong side of too hard before it softened, petting sloppily over Tony's sweat-soaked hair. "I-I-I, I'm not—" His throat swallowed convulsively, sucking saliva back behind his teeth. "Stark I'm— I'm not—" Steve shook his head, his lashes fluttering, and let his mouth hang open, his jaw working furiously around words he couldn't quite form. "I-I, is this—" he murmured anxiously. "D-does this m-make me—"
-" Steve's hips jerked, and he hit that sweet spot inside of Tony, who jolted underneath him and dug his fingernails into the meat of Steve's back. Tony breath hitched on a whine, and Steve felt the most glorious pressure clenching around his cock, working him from the inside out. "Steve-" Tony gasped, and Steve had to drop to his elbows so he could kiss him, so he could grab at Tony's thighs and wrap them around his waist and drive his dick in deep and hard and long and feel every microscopic twitch that Tony gave as he rolled his hips and fucked him harder and deeper. Maybe Tony would leave marks on him, Steve thought with a shiver, angry red fingernail marks that Steve could look at in the mirror after and remember what it felt like to be so deep inside him he wasn't sure where he ended and Tony began. Maybe they'd-
"I've got you, fella," Steve murmured, fingers closing around Tony's cock and jerking, two of his fingers slipping down to slip down the sensitive sac. Tony cried out, shoving his fist in his mouth. He never touched Tony as roughly as he seemed to touch his own cock; he always touched Tony so gently, whether it was on his cock or his hips or even the Iron Man armor, as tough as that was. Steve jerked him slowly, fingers slipping messily under and over the head, his hand getting slick and sticky from the evidence of Tony's need. When he rubbed against the circumcision scar on Tony's shaft, another moan burst from his lips and Tony fell forward, tucking his head into Steve's neck and shivering under the attention. Tony spread his knees wide, bracketing Steve's hips, and panted harshly into Steve's skin, grinding and rolling his hips into Steve's even, sure grip.
There was a gasp, loud in the quiet of their bedroom, and Tony flushed to realize it was him, tipped his chin towards the ground in a sudden burst of shyness.
Tony shivered. No, he didn't want a break, he- he wanted to keep going, he wanted to keep bringing Steve off, wanted to feel the evidence of Steve's pleasure swirling and rolling inside of him. "S' seven now," he slurred, lifted his hips back to meet Steve's. He felt so thick, and full, and
"Hmm?" Tony asked, smiling against his lips. He spread his legs a little further, and Steve could see the folds of his robe slide apart, just barely make out the half-hard swell of his cock resting against his freshly-waxed sac. The ties dangled forward as he moved, brushing against Steve's cock in his pants, jutting out obscenely from his hips. Tony's eyes followed the motion and he grinned, dragging his knuckles up his shaft, circling his fingers around the wet, sticky fabric. Steve moaned and clutched at Tony's biceps, shuddering in his grip. "Yeah, tiger, you're hard," Tony murmured, nuzzling the crook of Steve's neck. He pressed his hand more firmly against Steve's dick, massaging his palm to the head. "You're all wet and hard for me, darling," he whispered heatedly. "You're positively
Hearing everyone here call him 'Mr. Stark' was just a blessing in and of itself.
. He whined, or he might have yelped, both hands falling to the bed so he could dig his knees in and rock his hips into the tight, hot heaven of Tony.
in you. I think I got off easy here, buster."
"And set up an appointment with one of those lovely physical therapy girls for me," Tony yelled, wincing as the sound grated on his head. "I need a massage something awful." That would definitely do the trick, Tony decided. Lots of pills and booze and pretty girls rubbing his body down. He downed the rest of his drink with a gasp and sighed, padding over to the bar to mix himself another martini, extra dirty.
"I don't-" Tony gasped, shook his head, "I want to keep it all inside-"
Steve was still shuddering through his orgasm, come spurting across the both of them, his thighs quaking as he tried to keep up the pace. He gasped, shaking his head, whined into one of his fists. God, he had to be so sensitive from the two near back-to-back orgasms, but he was still fucking himself up and down on Tony's cock, his hips corkscrewing as he ground down until Tony nearly saw stars.
Steve had prepared for him. Tony moaned, and trembled, and Steve just shushed, rubbing at his lower back as he slid another finger in against the tight vise of Tony's body, crooking them up towards Tony's prostate.
," Steve choked out, his whole face twisting up in pleasure, and he came, spilling into his pants.
I do it covered in foul-smelling  inertial-dampening gel. Just because I'm a little multi-colored right now doesn't mean you have to be scared to touch me."
"Cap?" Tony called out, trying to keep the panic out of his voice. He pressed his ear up against the door and tried to resist the urge to barge in immediately. "Steve? Darling, is everything alright?"
"You still with me, honey, hmm?" Steve's voice suddenly broke through Tony's inner dialogue, his big warm hands petting the side of his face, soft and slow. "There you are," Steve hummed, smiling and pressing a tender kiss to his forehead; Tony wanted to cry at the sweetness of the gesture.
Tony swore, and squirmed, and tried to let Steve do it at his pace, his hands fisting uselessly behind Steve's head at the slow, slick slide. Before he knew it, Tony's ass was flush against Steve's balls, and Tony was moaning almost constantly at the sensations and stimulations and how absolutely
Well, he looked
"You doin' alright, Cap?" Tony asked, finishing off his water so Steve couldn't make any snide comments if he grabbed the gin. Tony saw his jaw tighten, but he nodded, his muscles bunching under the soft cotton jumpsuit as he visibly reined himself in.
one thing
"Are you excited, my dear?" Tony murmured, rubbed his nose gently across Steve's cheekbone. He pressed his lips to Steve's skin once, twice, three times, dug his hands into the tense muscle of Steve's lower back. "I could see you practically vibrating from across the room."
). "H‒I'm good," he slurred eventually, his jaw working to sound out the syllables slowly, saliva just beginning to drip from his mouth and into his goatee. God, he was a wreck.
"Alright then," Steve said, petting down Tony's spine. "I'm going to take it out now. And you can just let it all out, alright?"
, Tony thought nastily, frowning at his own pathetic self-deprecation. The idea that— that Steve would feel this way, would say these things (would want
And oh, didn't
Tony snorted. "Like you don't already know," he teased. "I'm in heaven." And he honestly, truly was ‒ the headache that had been buzzing in his temples all day had started to recede, his muscles were loose and relaxed. He was pretty much half a second from falling asleep in the chair, embarrassingly enough, light and floaty in a way he rarely got outside of sex.
"You've been barely conscious for a week!" Tony spat back, shaking so hard his teeth chattered. "You've been in pain every waking second under the influence of some kind of mind-altering
"Steve?" Tony asked again. "When are you going to come?"
Steve's thumb caressed the edge of Tony's clavicle. "I know I'm not— not supposed to bring this stuff up right now," he admitted, pulling a grimace. His other hand was petting Tony's hair, curling through each individual strand and lighting up all of Tony's nerves. "I know we're supposed to talk about it outside of— of this, but—" Steve's eyes fluttered shut, the tendons in his throat working as Steve tried to gather up the courage to continue. "I want something for, for just the two of us. I—I would like for you to have a piece of me," Steve whispered, his big beautiful gold lashes fluttering against those gigantic and sharp cheekbones. "Something that makes you
That was simple. Steve was a soldier —  he was good at following orders. He took hold of himself, lightly, and began to slide his hand up and down his dick at a glacial pace. Tony was still laying beside him, one hand cradling the back of his head, the other just resting across his waist. He tangled his legs with Steve, tucked his head in the crook of his neck. "Beautiful," he whispered, watching Steve barely touch himself. "Go a little faster, sweetheart."
Not that forty-eight hours was really the be-all end-all of the scientific community or anything like that; Tony was just impressed a single human being could keep
In the bathroom, Steve set Tony down on the edge of the tub with a towel and bottle of water, then hopped into the shower stall, scrubbing himself down with the speed and efficiency only someone who had been in the army was capable of. "Do you want a shower or a bath?" Steve asked once he was done, seemingly unconcerned with the fact that he was dripping all over the tile, standing there in the harsh unforgiving fluorescent lighting and still unbelievably, gorgeously nude.
, Tony. I kill men, and women, and I've let the government do awful things to me because I thought it was for the greater good. And— and, what? You think because you're attracted to me, because you were kind to me, gentle to me, because you took care of me— that what? That everything you did for me wasn't kind or gentle or
. Everything hurt - his head, his back, his cock, even his jaw (probably from clenching his teeth too hard). Steve gasped, choked a little on his spit, and rolled his face against the covers. "Tony," he sobbed out, his voice hitching. He just, he
that about him, loved that he got so much genuine pleasure out of just getting Steve off, whether from jerking him or sucking him or even letting Steve take and use his body for whatever Steve wanted. But on the other hand, it... it always cut so deep, that Tony never seemed to think he was good enough, that he felt he had to convince Steve to let him have something that
"—and you need to give your dick a break," Tony continued, oh so gently, because Steve needed gentle right now. He couldn't handle anymore rough treatment, and (if Tony was honest with himself) Steve could stand to receive a little tenderness from time to time. "But I, I—, I have a better idea, cupcake, I have an idea that should make it easier on you, yeah?" Tony murmured, using his other hand to pet through the sweat-soaked strands of Steve's hair. Tony was an
"How is he?" Thor asked.
"There you go, Shellhead," Steve murmured, and slid one finger in, probing, gently stretching as he slowly fucked it in and out. "Look at you," he murmured, his expression open and dazed and flushed with sex and Tony wanted to moan, wanted to rut against the bed and spread his legs like a whore for Steve because Steve was going to
," Tony moaned. That's what he wanted - Steve filling him up, wrecking him with it. He felt- so hot inside, his soft, sloppy rim stretched wide around the girth of Steve, his hot, massive length. God, he couldn't even clench down on him anymore, could barely even shudder around Steve as he fucked in and out of him, the hot, foaming come spilling out around them, dripping down past his perineum and his sack. Tony moaned, felt his spit dripping from his lips, had to suck it back up between his teeth. It was- it was silly he knew, but he selfishly wanted to keep all that come inside him, didn't want to waste a drop of it (even though he
There Steve was, wearing an honest to god red and gold bustier, skirt, and fishnet stockings, and Tony was groaning and moving into Steve's space, fingers running up and down the boning, up under the lace of the skirt and
He practically fell asleep with a smile on his face.
Tony gasped, almost fell off the bed, his fingers stabbing in too hard at Steve's prostate, but Steve just moaned again and started rubbing at Tony's shoulders, soft blurry praise falling from his lips.
, you idiot."
When Steve could stretch his fingers comfortably without feeling Tony's body clench immediately after, Steve moved for the lube again, his gut twisting hot and tight at the small sound Tony made when his fingers slipped out. "Shhh," he soothed, one hand sliding possessively over Tony's stomach, just barely missing his flushed, messy cockhead. His own cock was on fire, the now-familiar ache starting to build up in his belly; the whole damn thing was about to start again, and Steve bit back a curse at the tell-tale trembling he could feel spreading through his limbs.
"O-oh, I don't know whether to make a boy scout joke or be hilariously turned on right now," Tony whispered, a little awe-struck, his lashes fluttering as Steve dribbled a bit of the lube over Tony's cock, tried to feed it into his stuffed slit to lessen the burn Tony had to be feelin' right now.
—), pressing him tight to his sweating, heaving chest. He bared his teeth at the man in front of him. "You can't have him—"
, Tony was so embarrassed at how needy and desperate he must look to Steve. Steve, who could go for hours on end and barely break a sweat; but a little heavy petting on the couch and suddenly Tony was a virgin on prom night.
"Y-yes," Tony gasped, clawed his fingers into the sheets. "Oh, y-yes, pumpkin, honey- you are, I-"
"Tell me what you want," Steve murmured, soft and sex rough as he yanked Tony's panties to the side so he could tongue at Tony more thoroughly. When Tony began to buck his hips, Steve used his free arm to hold him down, and Tony just moaned underneath him again. "You gotta tell me how you feel today, honey," Steve whispered, breath hot against his ass, tickling the soft, sensitive flesh of his opening. Very gently, he began to circle his fingers around Tony's dick.
"Brat," Steve snapped out, winding his arms tighter around Tony as he began to set a harder pace. Steve moaned, tossing his head back, his hips jerking up in an attempt to get his dick even closer to Tony's fingertips.
It took a lot longer than Tony expected for the meter to work, or maybe it was his own damn impatience at work, fingers tapping irritably on the wooden nightstand by the bed. "Shit," Tony breathed when he was able to see the readout.
erection tenting his sweatpants, a huge wet spot darkening the front of his pants practically down to his thighs. His hips hitched and jerked in the air, like he wanted to rut against the bedspread but couldn't bring himself to do it, and he was making desperate, choked-off little moaning sounds in between gasps for breath.
"Hey, Jonathan—" Steve started; Not-Jarvis looked up from his dusting. Steve wondered what Jonathan thought of him, of how he'd fucked his boss bloody, how he'd sent Tony running from the room. "—You haven't seen Tony, have you?" he asked; Steve wanted to fidget so he fell into parade rest instead, dug his thumb into the meat of his palm.
Tony moaned, bit down on the soft, cool fabric of the pillow and clenched his fingers in the sheets. He wasn't sure if he wanted to laugh or cry or scream — it was— it was too
"Takin' down the bad guys is the only perk I need, Stark," Steve replied, and he sounded almost fond as he finally peeled off his pants and briefs and kicked them in the corner with the rest of his clothes. "Now let's get that armor off'a you."
and six days at a time spent hurling over the toilet from the pain and chemo.
Tony hesitated, then very slowly shuffled forward and laid his head on Steve's shoulder, wrapping his arms around Steve's middle, tangling them as close together as humanly possible. "No takebacks," Tony murmured, ever so slightly shaking in Steve's grasp. "Even when I get annoying and my hair falls out and I lock you out of my lab for not wiping the mud off your boots and tracking it all over my sterile work environment."
," Steve insisted, reaching out again to cup at Tony's face. "You think if I'd wanted to, I couldn't've thrown you out on your ass and broken half your bones to do so? Get real, Stark," Steve laughed miserably, sniffling wetly and pressing their foreheads together. Tony smelled sour, like vomit and sweat and chemo, but it was the best thing he'd smelled all day because it was
Thor frowned, drew a line through the condensation on his glass. "If you need anything," he said in lieu of a proper response, "do not hesitate to ask, Tony."
"Oh, Tony, Tony, I've got you," Steve groaned, teeth sinking into the thick of his throat. "Let me‒ let me, please, oh can I‒?" he stuttered shakily, and Tony could feel his other hand grabbing at his cock, the slick slapping of skin on skin as Steve furiously jerking himself off.
“Somewhere quiet.” Bruce suggested as he got up to get more tea.
He shook his head and took off to his left. If he made it to his bike before he was spotted he knew he could get away. He made it to the parking lot but spotted a black sedan with tinted windows blocking his path to the bike.
“Fuck. Time for a new plan.”
Damn it. They had been after him for almost two months and had barely been able to catch even a glimpse of the man until her arrived in Utah and now he was in the wind again.
“Open up a tab for me, man.”
“And punched me!” Howard shrieked again, tilting his head back. “What the hell Steve.”
“You are here because you are in the top of your field. Because you are what S.H.I.E.L.D. is looking for. If your sexual frustration is too much for you to handle, then maybe you should reconsider being here.” Clint walked towards the start of the course and hears as the small group of trainees follow. “There will always be distractions out in the field, we need people who are willing and able to stay on task no matter what. That includes two of the hottest, half-naked people you have ever seen sparring within your eye range. Believe me, if you can accomplish that, the rest is cake.”
“Alright, alright.” Tony put one of his hands up in surrender.
Natasha climbed on his back and electrocuted him with her stingers before he reached him. “Thunderball is down.” She called out when Tony flew past them, “I got movement on the south side.”
“Come on Cap, we’ve been here for hours and you are the only one without a swimsuit. Now come out here.” Tony replied in a somewhat impatient tone.
Oh. Yeah, that’s right.
“Well according to our new employer, if we do this job right, we won’t have to worry about the Avengers for much longer.” The leader told them all with a vicious smile on his face.
“Professor Banner!”
Fun Fact: I have no excuse for not having updated this fic before. I wrote this chapter in 2018, I am just terrible at finishing what I start I guess.
“That’s probably true, but when have you ever known me to do what I’m supposed to?”
“Next time you two try to hijack the ‘good’ couch – my couch by the way – remember that J.A.R.V.I.S. is always listening and I’m his favorite.” Tony smiles at him and Clint from his place on Steve’s lap.
This time Bruce sighed loudly, interrupting his student. “I know you believe you understand what you think I said, but I am not sure you realize that what you heard is not what I meant."
Thor walked into the dinning chambers.
“Okay, listen up. Our intel tells us that Barton is hiding out with the carnival. Surely sticking to what he knows best.” Coulson directed his words at a newly graduated batch of agents. “We have been tracking this guy for months and he has narrowly managed to escape us each time. We cannot fail again.”
Pepper turned and glared at him, something she also usually did every time Bruce – or anyone in the tower really - addressed her as anything but Pepper. “No, thank you,
“What are you smiling at?” Betty asked in an amused tone from Bruce’s side.
He almost couldn’t believe he was standing in the middle of the Stork Club with Peggy on his arm.
He knows they are not giving up on him. They will come at him until they get him.
Natasha nods and moves to stand by Tony’s workbench.
Tony released a ragged breath and pulled Steve into a soft kiss before he nuzzled into Steve’s neck. Drifting off to sleep holding each other. There were still a lot of things they needed to talk about but for the time being everything was alright, Tony loved him and he loved Tony. Nothing else mattered.
“It was a mistake and I think we should just forget about what happened.” Steve didn’t wait for a reply and began to make his way out of the living room, only to stop when Thor placed a hand on his shoulder and squeezed until Steve turned to look at him.
Steve laughed at that, only Tony would be able to keep up a conversation while simultaneously keeping track of time. “I’ll see you out front then.”
The waitress rushes away from them and Peggy stares after her.
“I am not myself, Sif. I fear something is terribly wrong.” Thor replied.
Coulson received nods of acknowledgment from his agents, though one of them must have missed the memo since a single hand rose up from the back.
He hears the rustle of the tent flaps being open and braces himself for a fight. There is no way in hell he is going to be brought down by fucking newbie Agents. Fuck that.
He had woken up in a dirty hotel room on the edge of some small town, no knowledge of how he got there or why he was there. But that didn’t matter right now. He could figure it out later. Right now the only thing that mattered was his escape. He took off towards the parking lot before he was made.
“YES! Don’t worry Bruce. I will make you a special drink that will relax you right up.” Clint exclaimed as he began mixing drinks for the rest of the team, handing them out when he finished.
He turned to see one of his undergraduate students making his way to his office. He sighed, this was the third time this week this student came during his office hours and quite frankly all he wanted was to be left alone.
She is always nagging him to come out of his workshop to take care of SI business - read: paperwork. Or she’s monitoring his eating habits – read: limiting Tony’s coffee intake. She also makes him wake him up at ungodly hours just to attend board of directors’ meetings - even though he was the majority shareholder and what he says goes. Hell, once she kicked everyone out of his house during one of his parties because he was too drunk. Seriously, she kicked all his guests out. She is always there to “take care” of him and making sure “he doesn’t kill himself” – yes, those are direct quotes. It’s annoying and unnecessary, Tony is a grown up. He can take care of himself.
“Right, what he said.” Tony agreed and patted Bruce on the back once before turning toward Steve. “So what’s our play Cap?”
Howard gave a small chuckle and looked away while Steve smiled and gave her hand a gentle squeeze, to reassure her of his presence. Another knock drew their attention to the door followed by Colonel Phillips and the doctor walking into the room. “Captain Rogers,” the doctor spoke as he looked down at his chart, “all your test results came back normal.”
“Looks like we got a job, boys.” The burley one with the crowbar announced as he entered the warehouse.
“I love you.” Tony whispered and Steve’s eyes shot open. There was a surprised look on the other man’s face, like he hadn’t meant to say the words out loud. “I -”
He’s never been good at following the rules of what he should or shouldn’t do.
“My head is killing me.” Tony muttered and rubbed at his temple. “JARVIS, what happened last night?”
“Good. Now head back in there and put your clothes on so we can go grab something to eat.” Natasha nodded at Steve and turned to walk out of the men’s dressing area with Bruce and Clint.
He’s getting ahead of himself, he knows. But his first date with Peggy went well. They danced, went to dinner, got reacquainted with each other – rather Steve got to learn about all the adventures Peggy got to have during the year Steve lost. It was great.
“It’s alright professor, really. I have been bothering you a lot this week haven’t I?”
(See the end of the chapter for
They sat in silence for a couple of minutes before Pepper finally spoke again. “Tony, who’s Steve?”
Sam looks at the clock. It’s 7:58 on a Friday night and he is getting ready for bed. Pathetic.
Jane. The LITOS.
Tony smirked and reached for Steve’s swim trunks. “May I?” He asked and Steve nodded, leaning back on his elbows and lifting his hips to help Tony drag the fabric down his body. Tony didn’t bother making it a show this time, pulling the material down Steve’s body as quickly as possible and tossing it somewhere across the room.
It’s been a rough week – month - and Tony is sure it is going to get worse before it gets better. There is a small voice inside his head telling him that Obie is up to something.
Thor frowned. Seemingly deep in thought, Steve took the opportunity and kept talking.
“Come one Bruce, one drink will not bring out the other guy and you know it.” Natasha reasoned and added quietly, “Besides, getting a drink doesn’t mean having to drink it and we all know it will shut him up. I’ll have my usual.”
“I don’t have to eat to be present.” Steve replied halfheartedly as he sat down on the kitchen island, making sure to sit as far away from Thor as he could without seeming too obvious.
“We’re good.”
“Relax Agent Barton,” Phil said from where he was going through surveillance video, “If your presence was necessary, you’d be down there helping.”
! Hundreds of people were dead or injured and all he wanted to know was an irrelevant personal fact about Steve!
“I’m going to put a mini version of that in my chest so I can lose the car battery.”
He loved his birthfather and loved hanging out with him and the rest of the Avengers but he also loved the anonymity of his life. He loved being able to go past the paparazzi and having them look straight through him. He loved no one giving him a second glance when he walked down the street. But, mostly, he loved simply being Peter Parker: a guy who loved science and geeked out over comic book references. It protected his other life as Spider-Man. No one had ever guessed the correlation between the two because Peter’s life was so “boring.”
It was a hot day and everyone unanimously decided to change into swimsuits to make full use of the pool and spa. As Steve cooked, the others played. He too was wearing swim trunks but he wore a full body apron to protect him from the grease. The apron was something as a joke Tony had bought for him last Christmas. It was made to make it look like whoever wore it was wearing a Captain America uniform and had defined muscles. Yet, on Steve’s massive form it looked absolutely ridiculous and it always brought a smirk to his lips whenever he saw his reflection.
“You too,” Steve replied. His eyes twinkled for a moment but then suddenly that light went out. Steve looked down in shame and whispered, “Schmidt…his machine…it took a lot out of me. There’s a lot of patches…a lot of things I can’t remember –.”
Steve shifted his feet uneasily. His heart was torn. He wanted to run, to prevent the future from changing anymore but…but this was the closest he’d been to Tony since he’d died in his arms and – and Steve couldn’t stop staring at him. He was every bit the man he loved and remembered: from the determined set to his shoulders to his unwavering gaze. He was half tempted to remove his sunglasses to see him in a better light but forced himself not to in case Tony would finally recognize him.
“And I’ve got Wade,” Steve replied. They separated and ran in opposite directions. Tony was engaged in a struggle with two of the octo arms in a matter of moments, but it took Steve a few more seconds to reach Wade.
Steve rolled his eyes but didn’t say anything more and plopped the other half of his chicken into his mouth. He groaned sinfully from the taste and the hair on the back of Tony’s neck stood up.
He’d already shooed two doctors away and he ignored their stares. Bedrest could come later. He needed to be there when his family returned and personally check on their wellbeing.
When he finally turned back to them, he wore a lost expression and said, “The ocean in Italy was not as cold…”
Peter was limp. His eyes were closed and, for a second, Wade could have sworn he wasn't breathing either.
Steve nodded, he was right. Steve would probably not sleep at all tonight and think of all of the ways he could stop his best friend.
Steve’s eyes were closed and Tony felt like all the horrors he thought were gone were all jumping out of the shadows all at once. He forced Steve up into a sitting position and Steve hunched over in his hold.
Tony wrapped his arm behind Steve too and said, “I want your cock in the cockpit.”
time travel again.”
Tony’s eyes crinkled and he murmured, “That’s great, kiddo.”
Peter pulled back from the embrace, teary-eyed but smiling. His lips trembled as clearly held back tears.
“You have to eat, Steve,” Ben stated disapprovingly. In the months since Ben met him, he had become well acquainted with his and Peter’s fast metabolisms.
Tony looked down with a flush, not wanting to admit to the truth in Steve’s words. He grumbled, “Fine.”
“No!” Peter gasped, aghast. “I want to keep kissing you!”
It was
Tony had been watching him this entire time and this was the first time Steve fully faced him.
“Tis like the mighty Hydra of old!” Thor thundered in, “The forces keep growing just as the beast kept growing its heads!”
He trailed his kisses up further. He nibbled along his jawline, his scruff tickled and irritated his lips at the same time.
Steve lounged on an old couch in the workshop, right next to Peter’s mock workstation. There he watched Peter play and Tony work. He usually sketched both of them. He filled his notebooks with their images.
“Oh,” Tony whispered involuntary. That was why Steve looked uneasy. He wanted hope. Tony’s stomach twisted at the thought. He could give it but Steve would never get to experience it… Tony cleared his throat and then murmured, “Yeah, in my era, everyone is cool with it. It’s considered discriminatory to hate on people just because they’re gay…Gay marriage just became legalized in California and New York is talking about doing the same right now.”
Ben Parker has dropped Harry off when you and the other Avengers are too busy fighting. Not to mention, he looks just like Mary. How could I not know? Any rookie reporter could have discovered it by now. I’m surprised it isn’t in the headlines by now!”
“Can we meet?” Steve asked in a tight whisper.
Tony took a moment to reply. He was looking at Steve but he seemed to be elsewhere. He finally whispered, “Sounds lonely…”
Bucky flinched and looked down, flushing with shame.
Hell, J probably didn’t even remember who Steve was…
“Ohhhhh, you just made my toes curl,” Tony gasped and playfully pushed at his chest.
Using his newfound height thanks to the stairs, Tony stared down at Steve, taller than him for once in this rare moment. As he looked down at now what was his entire world, Tony felt...blessed. He still could not get over it. Steve. Here. Alive. His heart could barely contain his joy and love. Tony bent down and gently kissed Steve. Steve hummed with pleasure and held him just as gently.
“Yes, please,” Tony all but groaned. He couldn’t help but yearn for the bed he’d shared with Steve. He glanced at the man and saw Steve already looking at him. His eyes also reflected a similar yearning.
"Shh," Tony whispered; his lips, dry but warm, slid sweetly against his own, almost chaste in comparison to all their kisses until now. "You just lie there and let me take care of you, my darling. Don't come just yet. I'll tell you when." Tony shifted, and before Steve had time to panic that Tony wasn't touching them anymore, Steve could feel him again, lying between his spread legs, his forearms resting on either side of his hips. "Did you wash up like I asked you to?" Tony asked, his breath ghosting along the underside of his cock.
, or that Tony was going to read more into this than there actually was. "Oh, Steve," he whispered, laving his tongue along the band of foreskin on his dick. Tony was an idiot, a goddamn idiot. Steve didn't want to be here (wouldn't be here if it weren't for that drug), and pretending he did was only going to get Tony hurt. "Honey, this doesn't— this doesn't mean anything," he rasped, and his vision started to blur from- from the gin. Maybe he should go get Jan, after all. "This doesn't make you anything you don't want to be," Tony murmured, and swallowed that monster of a cock down his throat before it felt too raw to do anything else.
"You mean the enema hose?" Steve asked, back in front of him again, and— Jesus, it was unnerving, sometimes, or unexpected, Tony thought, how fast he could move. It made sense, obviously (super soldier, and all that), but here, with naked and soft with Tony, it was easy to forget that Steve was actually a force to be reckoned with, and how- how fortunate it was that with all the power coiled in his bones, he still touched Tony so gently.
"Sure," Steve said, and was out the door. "The whole bag, or—?"
He bit it back, but Steve could still feel the whimper tearing out of his throat, the fine tremor in his hand as he wrapped his fingers around his— his sweet, drooling cock.
Oh, God.
"Color?" Steve prompted, nipping at Tony's ear.
," Tony sputtered, tamping down on a sudden wave of anger. Thor knew him better than that. "It's just sex. What kind of a person do you think I am, Thor?"
Tony gasped at the sharp pinch of the first clamp. "You‒ got it, sugar," Tony groaned, shifting restlessly as Steve fastened the other clamp on. Steve gave a light tug on the chain and smiled at the way Tony squirmed.
into Tony's skin with his lips, and that was the most they'd ever spoken of it.
— please, harder," Steve begged; he mouthed at Tony's neck, his tongue darting out to lap at the salty tang of sweat on the tightly corded muscle there, letting his teeth just barely scrape the skin. "Can I— another? Another finger?" he asked, canting his hips back. He grunted, and Tony could feel him pull his shoulders a little straighter, tangled around Tony as he was. "Another," Steve ordered, and slid his hand down so he could urge a third finger inside of him.
"I've got a plug in my bag," Tony blurted, face flushing hot at the admission. "You can— you can put it in me before you shower."
"Mmm," Steve rumbled, cock lazily sliding in and out of Tony's ass. Tony felt another gush of come splash his insides, and he shuddered, shuddered again when he felt Steve reach down and drag Tony's duffel bag onto the bed. Tony could tell when he found it, the way Steve's body went still all at once before he whispered hotly in Tony's ear, "S' that so?"
to be here?" Tony asked desperately, screwing his eyes even tighter together. "Boo hoo, I have cancer, I'm going through chemo, I'm
, he could do this for Steve-
" punching out of him, his hands fisting in the sheets on either side of him. Steve hummed, kept up that gentle, steady pressure, even as his cock throbbed and twitched with every breathy moan Tony gave him. When Steve slipped a second finger in, so slick with lube it dripped on the bed beneath them, Tony keened, dug his heels into the bed and hitched his hips onto Steve's fingers almost desperately.
"No, no, no," Tony promised, his legs coming up and wrapping around Steve's ass and thighs. He reached out and clasped Steve's hand in his own, and Tony actually
," Tony murmured, his legs trembling, his fingertips jerking. "Greeeeeeen," he moaned again and his tongue slipped out to lap at the beads of sweat on Steve's neck, his collarbone.
, Tony told himself tightly.
—" There was a Steve in his lap, a naked and very hard Steve grinding into Tony's abs, his sweaty forehead brushing against Tony's.
"Again?" Steve asked softly, pressing his body as tight as he could to Tony's.

“Of course,” Rhodey agreed easily. “He just needed a little bit of a head start to take this in and adjust, he never planned to keep them ignorant of the results, whatever they were.” He sounded so sure of Tony’s intentions, so certain that Tony would never conceal something so significant from his partners. Tony was glad at least one of them was sure. Rhodey asked a few more questions, and then Dr. Chimva made a point of asking Tony if there was anything else he wanted to know. He shook his head, unable to manage words at this point, and she left their company shortly after, promising to make herself available if and when Tony did want to discuss matters further.
Phil had thanked Steve and sent him on his way, aware that Tony seemed to be about the last thing Steve wanted to discuss these days. (At least he was in the Tower now. It was a step forward, however small.)
I'm so appreciating your thoughts and comments and questions on this verse. Long stories are my favourites to write (as many of you know!), but they do come with their own challenges, and one of them can be staying consistently motivated and excited. Hearing from you all ensures that's pretty much never a problem with this verse!
“Over here,” Rhodey called, crawling out from behind a bit of digital scaffolding that had done a masterful job of concealing his location. “Wanted to give these fools a chance before I started pickin’ em off one by one.”
“I don’t know,” Steve shrugged. “No, this isn’t…it’s not me being science-simple, Tony, we just don’t measure levels all that often once someone has settled into their orientation. Not unless there’s a problem with dep or someone is in unexplained distress or something like that.” Tony still seemed disconcerted by this, frowning and staring at the ceiling in thought. “Wait, Bruce measured the team’s levels once we all moved in together. He wanted a sense of how our dynamic was impacting everyone, and whether or not our various enhancements had any impact on the biological aspects of orientation. I bet he’d send them to you.”
That was how Tony found them: Bucky kneeling, his hand pressed to Steve’s mouth while Steve replied with his most withering stare. Tony took this in with no small hint of amusement.
Then the heat started to feel like it was seeping right through into his muscle and bone, which, honestly, was kind of awesome. His carpel tunnel, despite Clint’s obsession with getting it assessed, really wasn’t all that severe, but Tony did still work at screens and keyboards of various kinds for most of the day. Add to that the stress tremors that he’d developed in his left hand and arm in the weeks leading up to the Civil War, which had plagued him ever since, and he was rarely what he would call comfortable. Except now.
“Please what, darling?” (Oh God she was going to make him say it, what if he asked for the wrong thing, what if she laughed and told Tony that he didn’t deserve it, didn’t deserve anything, he hadn’t even been able to save her the first time, and what if what he’d done to try to fix it  hadn’t worked, what if she was still—)
Phil’s first reaction had nearly been to laugh. It was utterly absurd, unthinkable, to imagine. Particularly after he and Tony had first gotten together, it had been all Steve could do to push past his Dominant instincts to protect and shield in order to strike Tony during training exercises. They’d worked through it, of course, because Tony would never have stood for team leader taking it easy on him, but still the notion of a Steve willing to incapacitate Tony, compounding the unspeakable error he’d already made by concealing vital information from Tony sounded like a version of Steve Rogers that Phil would have had very little interest in knowing. (A few weeks ago Phil never would have thought such a thing possible, which was a mark of just how bizarre this other universe seemed to be.)
“Okay, you were right, Natasha. That pose looks like they’re trying too hard to be intimate. Uh, alright. Let’s try the one where you’re standing behind Tony, Steve, but not touching him.”
“Just tilt your head back for Nat, Tony, good. She’s just getting the shampoo out, don’t her nails feel nice on your scalp?”
May Parker arrived at the Tower by 6:30, roughly half an hour before a car was scheduled to pick her up from her apartment in Queens. She looked mostly the same as the version of herself Tony had known, though he thought he noticed a few signs that her clothes had been worn and repaired more than had ever been necessary in the other universe, and her hair was maybe slightly less well kept. Even despite the more dire financial situation her appearance spoke to, though, May didn’t spare a second to seem impressed by the penthouse. She had only eyes for Peter, who was seated at the kitchen table, eating a cronut with an air of awkward formality. He glanced up at her, and a fraught silence of a few seconds was broken by both of them trying to speak at once. (Tony could see instantly where Peter must have gotten his penchant to babble when nervous from.)
“Why not?”
And that’s the worst of it, at least for that particular night. Tempers are still raw, minds still reeling. At one point, Sam looks like he’s about to ask Peter something. Then he shakes his head, sits back against the couch and steals a Mars bar out of Bucky’s hand.
Tony didn’t go into Howard’s notes looking for it. He wanted that made clear, even if he never re-told this story outside his own head. Originally, he’d been creeping around this corridor only because a comedy of errors worthy of a sugar-high Dummy had prevented he and Steve from gaining access to the Tessaract for several days. One time there had been too many people around; during another attempt everyone present in SHIELD HQ had been evacuated and searched because Pym had found out about the missing particles. (Thank god Steve had apparently learned some subterfuge since his days of hiding sensitive intel in vending machines; no one had suspected the two new guys.) As a result of Pym’s (admittedly justified) paranoia following that episode, a lot of the more sensitive tech had been moved to a new location: a private but rarely used laboratory of Howard Stark’s.
“S’okay. I kinda deserved it. But don’t you, I mean, it really doesn’t disappoint you to imagine lying like this, maybe indefinitely? I know you, Steve, telling the truth is practically coded into your DNA.” Steve shrugged.
Eek! I hope no one is too upset about the identity of Peter's love interest. I adore MJ and Zendaya, but since the multiverse gives us the options to right a lot of wrongs, I felt like bringing Gwen back (and racebending her, because why not?) might be a fun twist. Her band name, Fridged, comes from a term used to describe the phenomenon by which women are often killed off or brutally harmed to provoke character growth in other characters (usually men.)
For Switches, wearing a collar is a more personal decision. Some have collars, but only received them at their bonding ceremonies and never felt the need to use them again. Agent Coulson is one of these; he much prefers his pre-scene ceremony to the use of a collar, and he only wears his if it is part of a bondage arrangement. The other Switches on the team have and use collars intermittently; Agent Romanov will always wear hers during a scene, while Agent Barton usually uses them only during aftercare. Thor prefers wrist cuffs, which are more customary symbols of commitment on Asgard, though as fond as he is of bondage in general he is delighted to wear a collar if it is requested of him.
“Well since a snack food oath was made I should probably tell you that you’re not wrong, Tony, just picking up on something that was probably happening unconsciously.” She peered thoughtfully around the table at the configurations of people and food. “Food can be reflective of headspace, yes, but it’s not a sure enough thing to rely on as a major tell. For instance, Rhodes is feeding Pepper right now, which could be because she’s a sub and he’s a Dom. It might also be because Pepper loves Italian food but always worries about making sure the enhanced people in the Tower get as much as they need, so she never takes as much as she actually wants on the first round.” Pepper flushed, which always highlighted the cluster of freckles just under her left cheekbone. No matter the universe, it was one of Tony’s favourite looks on her, so he had grinned and stuck a piece of his garlic bread on her plate with an exaggerated wink.
“Go back to sleep, Tony. I’m fine.” It was not, Steve could admit to himself, his best attempt at a cover-up, given that he was still visibly shuddering despite the perpetually elevated core body temperature ensured by the serum. (Natasha, who had spent all that time training him in espionage, would be downright shamed of the effort.) To be fair, this was the fourth time in as many days that Steve had woken with a start like this, a scream that was a torn, broken version of Tony’s name still on his lips. He was pretty much out of excuses.
Steve would have given several limbs to know precisely what had gone on in Bucky and Tony’s hushed poolside conversation, but there would be plenty of time for that. It was enough for now that both of them were more settled once it was done. Tony accepted the second round of aftercare he sorely needed. He let Bruce rub him down with a massage oil formulated specifically for submissives, despite his numerous muttered protests about the lack of scientific evidence supporting its benefits (no one called him on it when he was putty under Bruce’s hands in under three minutes). He allowed the team to hand feed him both lunch and dinner, complete with sugary deserts to balance out the drop. Tony responded most, however, to a gift Thor gave him: a sumptuous blanket threaded with strings of gold. Thor had gotten Tony on his side and then draped the fabric over his back, rear and legs. Tony had sent an appreciative smile backward, but then he’d abruptly groaned and sunk so deeply into his pillow that Steve half felt like he might keep going all the way through the floor. All of them had turned to Thor, who was grinning a little guiltily.
“Is any of what you've figured out critical enough that it can’t wait a day or two?” Steve demanded, tightening his hold and pressing his nose into Tony’s hair. He smelled like all the usual scents of the workshop, and even with the grease and sweat that accompanied it, Steve could easily have stayed there forever, letting his body learn and re-learn everything there was to know abut Tony’s.
“I know you’re not interested in engaging in any sexual play with Tony, but are you open to being present for sexual scenes in which he’s involved?” Rhodey had considered the question as he made himself another coffee (which he made, Steve noted with amusement, with the exact same quantities of milk and sugar that Tony did.)
“Naturally.”
While morning found Clint much closer to his usual headspace, he elected not to put his hearing aids in immediately, a cue that his senses were still nearing overstimulation as they often did following his forays into submission. So Steve kept the lights dim, the television off, and hand fed the other man in quiet broken only by the sounds of Clint chewing or moaning lightly when Steve stopped feeding him long enough to nuzzle him or stroke his dirty blonde hair lightly. The silence was as much a gift to Steve himself as it was to Clint; he was sickeningly grateful not to have to keep up with sexy post-scene banter or even have a more mundane conversation about their respective plans for the day just now. It gave him the strength to give Clint his warmest smile and tightest hug when the man finished eating, got dressed, and put in his bright purple HawkEars.
“Oh, when he was on guard dog duty at the hospital—you really gotta quit that by the way, Tony—he came in and had a word with some of the folks in HR about the workplace orientation program. I don’t know exactly what he said, but they have since found themselves substantially more motivated to actually follow the new laws. It’s been really nice.”
“Permission granted,” Natasha declared grandly. Her feet were up on the kitchen table again, which normally Steve hated. But Thor had brought the Asgarsdian mead again and Steve was an utter horndog when he was drunk, so he was too busy with his transparent admiration of Natasha’s thighs to bother protesting her lack of decorum.
we’re going to do this, I want that paperwork filled out in as much detail as you can give me. It’s fine to not know something because of a lack of experience, but if I think you’re willfully omitting information that I need to keep you safe and well, then deal’s off and you start with a gentler Dom. Got it?” His smile when Tony replied with a quiet ‘yessir’ was almost wolfish.
His hands shook as he picked up one of the spheres, running it between his thumb and middle finger.
“Then you stay. You say whatever you want at the press conference—we’ll back you whichever way you decide to go. We make it through the celebration a couple days after, and then after that I would suggest we all have our schedules clear for a couple weeks at least. I mean really clear: no missions, no call-outs barring apocalyptic conditions, no SI or SHIELD or any of it. The press will be a nightmare for a while anyway; it’s impossible even to do Avengers work when they’re out in the kind of force I imagine they will be, they just put everyone in more danger. And if we decide we’re really going to do this, then I want to go somewhere away from everything else and have some dedicated, focused time to spend together reconnecting and figuring out what our life is going to look like.”
“You sure you don’t want to stay for lunch, Rhodes? Phil is going to fire up the grill he’s been drooling over since we got here, and I’m pretty sure that Thor brought a decent stash of Asgardian mead with him. Guaranteed to get even Steve drunk, which is always hilarious.” Steve glared halfheartedly at Clint, who offered a cheeky grin in reply. Rhodes, meanwhile, looked somewhat conflicted.
What Tony hadn’t counted on (although he damn well should have, he’d been through enough check-ins by now to know better) was his own reaction to Bruce’s presence. He wasn’t sure what it was about the sessions, because he maintained that the check-ins themselves were kind of the worst, but Tony walked out the majority of them half submersed in subspace. If it was a normal day he could usually tug himself back out of it fairly quickly by focusing on work, but today…today was different. Today Steve had been there to watch Bruce examine his most intimate places and ask invasive, personal questions, and now Steve was drawing water for a bath. Tony half wanted to crawl after him, just to be on his knees for Steve again, and because he didn’t like being left alone right now, not even for a second, even though Steve had asked and Tony had told him it would be okay. (Yeah, okay, he was more than a little bit back down in subspace then.)
“You could try white noise?” In the face of this rather unexpected response, Peter was now the one silent a bit too long, his fork hovering inches above his pancake like someone performing surprise in a movie. “I have some of the same problems. When Dr. Erksine was shot immediately after they gave me the serum the noise was so bad I was sure for just a second that I was the one who had been hit. When I came up here, especially after the rebuild when it was just me a lotta the time, my system didn’t know how to handle it either. FRIDAY can pipe in a whole buncha sounds though, and even mix them together. I really like this one—what is it, FRIDAY?”
“No. Pepper, have I said just a straight no to anything you’ve asked so far? Hear how serious I am.”
“Sirs. I am deeply sorry to interrupt. Ms. Potts is requesting entry, and has used her emergency override code.” Clint growled, practically leaping from the bed and shoving pants on. Tony sat frozen on the couch, totally unsure how to proceed. It was one thing for Clint to see him this way when he’d been the one to put Tony down in subspace, but it was entirely another to think of Pepper witnessing him this…this slow and clingy.  He had, at least, put on boxers and a pair of loose pyjama pants, so he wouldn’t have to do this naked.
“Say suit, or yellow.”
Much of what he seems to value about submission and about how the team operates with him is how very seen and known he is. So much of his time with the MCU version of the team was spent with them talking around one another, and Stark especially fell prey to others making assumptions and projections onto him rather than actually taking the time and effort involved in getting to know him.
“I have Iron Man down on 38,” a confident voice declared through the comms system Taskmaster’s people were using, loud enough for Steve’s enhanced hearing to pick it up. He barely restrained a snicker.
“Like you did?”
When her phoned chimed, his first instinct was to pitch it across the room. This was, he recognized, the height of petulance, but he suspected he might bare a kind of instinctive grudge toward Nat’s phone for quite a while. The damn thing had started all of this, broken their beautiful vacation bubble and turned it into something fraught and ugly, and yes Steve’s phone had gone off seconds later, and yes it was more the news the phone had been bringing that had been the real issue, but Steve had chosen his enemy dammit, and it was the little black rectangle sitting on the bedside table of the guest room looking all unassuming and forgettable. He barely resisted the urge to stick his tongue out at it, then reflected that perhaps he was stretching even his body’s limits with the amount of sleep he’d gotten the past several days.
“Howard.” It was one word, but it was perhaps the only one that could have caused Pepper to immediately call Rescue off. She came to stand between Tony’s splayed legs, expression so tender that for a moment it recalled another scene in another workshop just like this one. He’d warned her then that he was a piping hot mess; it hadn’t been enough to scare the other Pepper away yet, but she’d gone eventually. He’d been too much for her, like he was for everyone. But this Pepper had never tried to rely on him for romantic stability, had never silently hoped that Tony would become someone else, someone he wasn’t.
“That’s—that’s smart.” And it was. While there was no guarantee that the team would face the same foes twice, it made sense for them to know everything they could about their enemies, including how to wield their tech. (It was the kind of strategic, long-term thinking Tony had expected his own Steve to display all along.)
“What if I throw in some pyjama pants and promise to keep it strictly PG?” Steve eyed him doubtfully. “I’m serious! No funny business, Rogers, not even if you beg.”
“Cap?” he asks immediately. Because he is
Steve had just hustled Tony out of bed and to his morning date with Coulson, and he was looking forward, with an intensity bordering on the pathetic, to collapsing immediately back into bed and falling asleep with his nose pressed against Tony’s pillow. (What? He could cope with having his near-constant bedmate stolen from him in the early hours of the morning, but that didn’t mean he had to like it.)
“I want to be clear about the fact that I’m completely mortified. I mean, I could barely even talk for the first couple hours there—“
Tony, though, Tony was in his element, and it was a delight to watch. He flitted from person to person, armed with knowledge from briefing files on the attendees that Pepper had prepared for him to ensure that he didn’t make any mistakes rooted in the small differences between their universes. (Steve never would have thought of doing something like that, which was yet another reason he was glad to have her on their side.)
Steve wonders if this is what it feels like to be addicted to something. He loves both Bucky and Sam more than just about anyone. He’d been looking forward to their visit to the compound for weeks. But now he feels trapped, ready to strike out at either of them if it will get him out of this room faster.
“I mean, sort of—though if I can give you one piece of advice, it would definitely be to avoid ever calling Nat a himbo to her face. Or behind her back. Really, though, we need this many levels because SHIELD people are so specialized. Think about Clint. He’d destroy a standard archery range, so he has his own. But there are other people around here who are proficient with a bow and arrow, just not at his level. So they require another range altogether. It’s like that for a lot of the weapons around here, and that’s before we’re even talking about enhanced people. Steve had the skeleton already built, of course, but fleshing it out has been a process. I would say we still only have about half the training facilities we’ll eventually need.”
“Or maybe you could just come upstairs and finish your fruit salad. You know, with your Sir.”
Allow me to show you a relevant conversation.
“I know.” Pepper and Rhodey were two of the only people who knew that short, declarative statements were one of the only ways to cut through Tony’s rants when he really got going. He was so paranoid in the wake of the imminent threat of exposure that for a moment he wondered if Everhart had been spying somehow. Maybe she had sources closer to him than he even realized? (He’d conduct a hardline sweep of the Tower and every other building he had so much as stepped foot in the second she left.) “I just…I can only give you a couple hours head start, but I thought if there were people in your life who don’t know and who you would prefer hear it directly from you, I could at least give you the chance to tell them yourself. I really am sorry, Tony.”
And yes, maybe she should have called for help sooner than she did when it came to the latter issue. But however else she delighted in being a killjoy when it came to nonsense like structural racism and people who apparently wanted to make polio a thing again, MJ was still a damn bro when it came to helping those she loved get up to mild mischief while avoiding punishment from parental units of all sorts. So she waited it out. She found what would pass for a bucket to try to contain the mess, did her best to keep Peter’s annoyingly soft little curls out of the splash zone, and she didn’t take any photos or videos. Not even early in the evening when Peter attempted to develop an ill-advised drinking song about the booze he absolutely insisted on referring to as Thor Juice. His horrible attempts to rhyme had included mentions of Bruce (as in Banner), Seuss (as in Dr.) and a
He did not have to worry on it long for his mind grew blissfully blank as he began to sketch out the lines to his new piece.
Next time, Ch. 6: Exchanging Love for Misery
They really were like brothers, teasing and picking on each other whenever they got the chance.
Bucky groaned and mumbled something about punks.
Steve reached out to him without another thought. He helped Tony to his feet and then wound an arm around him to help him walk. Tony’s warmth seeped into his side, calming Steve further.
He went into the less busier section of the Stark Enterprises complex and didn’t look back even though he felt multiple eyes watching him go.
Peter did not reply or seem to hear him. His eyes were closed and his mouth was slightly agape.
At the moment, Tony was lying on top of Steve with his legs bracketed around the super soldier's hips. Steve had already untucked Tony's shirt and his fingers were digging into the flesh of his back. In response, Tony rubbed himself against Steve, moaning into his mouth. Steve tried to push himself up, maybe to get their bodies closer together, but, he ended up making them wobble and roll off the small couch.
After breakfast on Monday mornings, they'd usually split to deal with their various responsibilities but Steve followed him into the elevator which would take him to the lab. Tony looked at him incredulously and asked, “Are you babysitting me?”
Just when Tony was about to bare it all, Steve’s eyes narrowed and everything he thought he knew changed. Steve’s hiss of “Don’t” sliced into him like a knife. He almost staggered right there like his tendons had been cut.
But this was not his Tony.
little…
Pepper stepped over to him and hugged him from behind. She buried her face into his back and gasped, “He loves you, Tony. He would have never left you like this if he had the choice!”
Natasha was the first to move. Her first few steps were obviously forced as she did not want to take them but as she started moving, she started gaining momentum. She walked with purpose and hit Tony on the neck with a light jab and Tony’s eyes rolled into the back of his head and he slumped forward. Natasha caught him then slung him over her shoulder like Bucky had done with Peter. Natasha had tears falling from her eyes and she turned to Steve and she nodded curtly to him.
“Why would you say that?” Steve answered gently, wanting to forestall the truth for as long as possible. He directed his gaze to the horizon and recreated the plain sky with a colorful sunrise and shaded mountains he had seem once in the alps.
It felt like every bone and muscle in Tony’s body was bruised. But he never felt so good before as the warm food filled his stomach.
“Wh-What are you doing?!” Tony demanded.
"...No, I wasn't lying about that," Tony replied. Despite the situation, a smile tugged at his lips for Bucky's obsession with his hair.
“…Yeah. Why?”
The door was closed and they were left alone in the windowless van but Steve still smiled in the direction the couple had disappeared. They clearly cared deeply for each other. It was going to be interesting seeing them meet and watching their relationship develop.
Steve played with the flask in his hand and he thought about Natasha’s words and Tony. Steve had missed so much from his mate’s life but he still felt uneasy.
“He insisted on going to the lab,” Tony murmured petulantly.
Coulson bit down on the inside of his cheek and rocked the flesh between his teeth nervously. If this continued the psychiatrist would deem him mentally unsound and they will have to detain him.
Steve chuckled, murmured with an agreeing sound, and started to trail his kisses down his chest, then his waist, pausing to lick his belly button, and then…
"Perfect-perfect," Peter agreed.
“Hungryyyy,” Venom hissed with a curling smile.
The rest of the day, Steve awkwardly avoided Tony. He saw the hurt and confusion whenever he caught Tony’s gaze and felt immensely guilty for it. He knew Tony wanted to talk to him, he had to be confused by his running away from him at the pool, but Steve needed to sort through his thoughts before talking to him again. Steve wanted something more but he had to accept the fact that it was not going to happen.
BTW since these events are taking place in the middle of a WWII military operation, so please let me know if I  misinterpret Army procedures or historical facts!
Steve moved forward but she flinched back. Steve stepped back and whispered, “Mary…Mary. I-I just want you to know that what happened to you was horrible and if I could have prevented it I would have.” He saw the disbelief in her gaze and his voice dwindled as he said, “I…I’m so sorry.”
Tony’s other hand reached up and lightly grazed the side of Steve’s neck before settling at its back. His fingers played with Steve’s hair again and Steve tensed automatically at the intimate gesture. He wasn’t used to
“We can’t do this,” Steve hissed, half hysterical. “I am dating Tony. I can’t be with you!”
He was a tactician. He knew when people were looking for you, it was never wise to stay in one place for too long, but he had assumed he’d be alright with just one day in one remote location.
She grasped the front of his shirt before he could recover and hissed, with emotion shaking her voice, “You made the biggest mistake of your life.”
leaving our side for the next week.”
“You’re dead, Steve,” Tony hissed. “You should have moved on. You should have never been in my dreams. What if this is it?? What if you’re finally l-leaving me?” Tony’s voice broke with the notion.
From out of nowhere, Aunt Tasha pounced on him before he could push through the blackened doors to the ER waiting room. Peter struggled against her hold and screamed out to his father, “
Tony winced internally. This was going to be bad.
“How do I go back out there after saying all of that?” Peter whispered.
Peter cleared his throat loudly, and said pointedly to Eddie, “Eddie this is Wade. Wade, Eddie.”
Unsurprisingly, they missed breakfast altogether.
“You're more likely to meet the governor than Tony Stark,” Solo stated sarcastically. Steve dropped his head. Solo was right. Stark was famous and Steve was just a nobody. Solo sighed heavily and murmured, “We're gonna look like fools but…we can try to make an appointment. He probably has a front desk in that lobby of his.”
Peter wrapped his arms around Wade, wishing he could share everything he felt in his heart with the mercenary to make him understand how much he cared for and needed him.
Bucky did what he did best: support Steve.
SHIELD had nearly all its agents on it and Thor and Clint were helping with what they could but nothing seemed to be able to stop Venom.
The gold coloring was a little much compared to the Mark II’s more muted silver. Tony observed, “Little ostentatious, don’t you think?”
“What the fuck…” Tony gasped, watching the figure become smaller until he disappeared around a bend. He stumbled back to his car and whispered, “Cancel the emergency services, J…find out who that guy is instead.”
“B-But the Mandarin—?” Steve gasped. “Is he really going to try to take him on his own??”
to be able to help.”
Was she back?
With a wobbly smile, Steve stated, “Don’t worry about me.
He stood still, not knowing what to do other than breathlessly correct Tony, “Language.”
Steve sat down on the couch and instantly loved it. It must have been the most comfortable thing he ever sat on. He leaned back into the cushions then propped the sketchbook up on his lap. He let his head fall back and he closed his eyes for a moment.
He should have said
“Yes, Sir.”
He wanted to feel.
Eddie met his eyes in the reflection of the bathroom mirror. A stranger stared back at him. He was no longer the same person before Venom. He felt hallowed out and without purpose. Banner wanted his help…but what kind of help would he provide?
Steve pushed himself up and gasped, “Buck?”
He was in the twenty-first century.
“Tony,” Steve whispered. He tugged their clasped hands in the direction he wanted him to look. Tony lifted his head, followed his point, and smirked.
Behind the chair was a huge circular tower that had many wires and bulbs and things that looked like solar panels and Tony could only guess at its purpose. Wires from all of the terminals fed into this machine.
. He chastised himself. He quickly rubbed his eyes but it was too late, the damage was done. Peter had felt his tears and knew something was wrong.
Tony snorted and Steve rolled his eyes as he closed the door.
“What Tony is saying is true,” Bucky stated gruffly. “I had been given a version of the super solider serum that healed me, including my mind…if my mind wasn’t erased regularly, I’d remember and fight back…”
Tony woke to Steve's gentle kiss on his cheek. Tony stretched and cracked open his eyes. Steve was sitting next to him and he lay a comforting hand on Tony's stomach as soon as he opened his eyes. In his other hand, he held a mug of coffee.
The dreamscape was there so he knew his soulmate was there somewhere…but why wasn’t he responding??
“We just got him,” Natasha replied, lightly touching the communicator to activate it. “But we have to get out now. Does it look like they have most of their forces out there still?”
!” Thor yelled and ripped the Soldier off of his target.
Next time, Ch.9: Can one Fondue and Just be Friends too?
“I thought we were keeping this a secret,” Steve murmured.
“So he works for SHIELD, huh? He seems to know what he’s doing,” Steve stated with a shiver. He'd stopped breathing when heard this Coulson found his sketch. They were lucky he didn’t happen to look into the closet. Tony had told him all about SHIELD after Natasha’s visit and he wasn’t too eager to meet them just yet.
Steve grabbed Sitwell’s shoulder and hissed to the others, “We’ve got to get out of here but we need to take him with us. He can get us into Hydra.”
century,” Tony replied with a grin. Remembering Steve’s prior comments about wanting children, he added, “And those same married couples can adopt kids or use a surrogate to carry their kids. Either way, gay men can have happy families and live the American Dream now.”
Steve wrapped his arm around Tony and he leaned into his super soldier’s side.
“Professor Mason, from the Smithsonian, has confirmed that it was in fact Sergeant James Barnes—.”
Thank you for all the awesome comments! You guys are amazing! :D
Howard didn’t think he was going to be going to sleep for a long while.
Before she could be all high and mighty Tony said, "I need a drink, you need a drink? I'm going to get us some drinks. Martini, right?"
Calvin rolled her eyes and asked, “Is he ever?”
“I’m sorry, boss. I am not at liberty to divulge any information about the past or why Jarvis is not here without threatening the timeline,” the new AI replied.
Steve put a hand over Tony’s mouth and said, “I think he knows, sweetheart.”
“Get off me,” Peter whispered, digging his fingers into the black mass. “I don’t want
And as he stared at Tony, he realized it was also the first time he looked at another like this. He wasn’t just trying to commit this to memory. Simply looking at Tony made him happy. It made him so happy that he could barely keep his smile off his face.
“We’ve been over this countless times, I’m not that kind of doctor, I’m not a therapist,” Bruce stated. “Last time we talked like this I almost lost my temper.”
Thanks for reading!
Steve frowned upon the question.
“Is…Is he at the Tower?” Steve asked breathlessly. Oh God, Clint and Natasha clearly thought Steve stepped out on Tony but what would Tony think? He just told Steve he loved him as Steve was genuinely sleeping with a man Tony knew he had feelings for. Would he believe him if he said nothing happened?
“I don’t know,” the Hydra agent squeaked.
“Yes, we need to build a history…when should we have started dating?”
Steve’s brows pinched together in worry and he looked like he wanted to hold Tony. Bucky stepped in before Steve exposed themselves to a quarter of the 107
Steve reached out to Peter and asked, “Can I hold you, Pete?”
(See the end of the chapter for
They smiled warmly at each other and then both leaned in to share a brief peck. Their hands remained connected and were a testament of the trials they had endured: Tony’s metal hand in place of the one he had sacrificed to defeat Thanos and Steve’s scarred hand, marred when he was willing to give up everything to save Tony. Even with the super soldier serum, his left side never fully healed, his arm especially. The joints of his elbow and hand would ache in the cold or with overuse. It never bothered Steve. It was a happy reminder that he was mortal and got the chance to be with the man he loved another day.
“Bailiff! Remove Ms. Tyler!” The judge ordered. The bailiff ran forward followed by another uniformed court enforcer and they both pulled Tyler away from the lawyers. They dragged her out of the court, kicking and screaming.
Bucky jumped right on the idea and spent over a week on the letter. He would not let Steve or Tony read what he was compiling. When Steve visited him, he found Bucky’s living room filled with crumpled papers. From what he could see of them, they were all written in Russian.
As Steve laughed, both Sam and Tony came flying up over the edge. Sam was the one who ended up catching Sitwell and tossed him back onto the roof. He too landed and his wings folded back into his pack.
She stormed past him and Steve spun around and called out to her, “Natasha!”
Tony’s heart was pounding madly against his chest and his feet slammed just as quickly against the stairs. He slid a few times on the slick, metal stairs but never lost his momentum as he bound up the staircase in record time.
“Steve,” Sam whispered with concern, grasping his shoulder.
It had been late by the time he and Steve settled down for bed. Tony continued to persistently keep close to Steve’s side. Steve kept rolling his eyes but he did not push Tony away.
Tony smiled sadly at their clasped hands then gently slid his hand out of Steve’s grasp again. Steve’s hand twitched and wanted to grab his hand once more. A wave of fear ran through him, for half a second, he thought he would lose Tony forever if he did not grab him.
The door to the lab opened before Tony could reply and Steve stepped in. He was still in his uniform but he had removed his helmet. Tony's stupid first thoughts were about how much better Steve looked without it…
Heimdall watched the scene with a smile and, in the coming days, watched the Captain sleep less and the Man of Iron grow stronger with his every waking minute. The world clamored over their relationship and they took it all in stride. Their union had started off shaky but had grown strong in the trails they had faced together and with the knowledge of what they could have lost.
!” Wade yelled. He must have followed him out of the window. More people yelled out in fear as the mercenary cut through them to get to Peter.
Relaxing into Tony’s arms, Steve sarcastically whispered, “Oh, the horror.”
Tony returned the reactor to his chest with a heavy sigh and then looked to the Iron Man suit. He solemnly stated, “I can’t charge you anymore, Jarvis.”
“Don't worry, you look cute in all of them and, well…You can come to my place if you want?” Wade suggested.
He stumbled out of bed and paused in from of his mirror. No trace of the cut remained on his forehead, he was safe. He licked his thumb and rubbed the area for good measure. What little blood that had remained was wiped away and he felt safe enough to venture outside his room. He went straight to the kitchen and found his aunt cleaning the stove.
“…Fly?” Steve repeated in awe.
On the inside, he was overjoyed by Tony’s words. He could not believe he missed the signs that Tony was also attracted to him all those years ago. Looking at him now, Steve could see the love in Tony’s gaze and hear the affection in his voice.
“I’m taking away that gaming system!” Tony yelled in rebuttal as Natasha pulled him out of the room.
At first he thought it was heaven.
He shifted slightly to get a better look at him and Tony’s head shot up. He dropped his tablet on the chair and was instantly at Steve’s side as soon as he saw him move.
Steve broke away from him with a chuckle and promised in a whisper, “That was all for you, honey.”
Steve rolled his eyes and grasped Tony’s face with both hands. He murmured affectionately, “Come here, you maniac.”
"Who's this?" A familiar feminine voice murmured behind him and Tony.
“I-I cut you! You healed! You healed-
“Peter and I are sitting in a tree. K. I. S. S. I. N. G,” Wade lightly sang with a smile. Logan was right, he was smitten.
Tony slowly pulled to a stop in front of the house in his bright yellow Lamborghini. A pickup truck sat in the driveway and Steve could hear the sound of a TV playing a commercial from the open front window.
He wiped the corner of Wade's mouth to rid him of the spittle and Wade grinned at him for the action.
“Uh oh.”
It felt nice to cuddle with Steve like this. They rarely got to do it. Mostly he fell asleep in Steve’s arms like this so his eyes felt heavy as soon as they settled.
As soon as he saw the bullet ridden, barely sealed blast doors, he knew he found the place his father was talking about. One blast from his repulsors brought the doors down. They collapsed with a loud whine and landed with an explosion of dust.
“I can’t say sorry enough,” Tony said with a cringe. “I thought I was doing right by you.”

With them speaking the same language of science, they were quick to friend each other and now Bruce was living in the Tower with Tony. He gave Bruce his own lab to continue his research. The man was busily working to find a cure for what he had done to himself. Everyone said Tony was crazy when he brought Bruce back to New York but Tony saw himself in the man. Tony hadn’t reached his goal with finding his soulmate through SI Online, but maybe he could help Bruce in finding his cure.
stuck with me now,” Tony mumbled.
He is human. He makes mistakes.
He was afraid.
He felt out of his element and lost in the haze of desire. He let Tony lead them and followed his touches and kisses until Steve finally used their connected hands to press Tony into the bed.
“Like a rotted potato that just barely made it through the grinders,” Wade replied without missing a beat.
innocent people. Peter was never going to be a superhero now, not even a supervillain…he was simply a monster.
Peggy was at his side in the next moment and crouched beside him. She turned Tony’s head to the side to see the wound and Tony moaned pitifully. She stated, “You’ll live.”
His implant had only a row of 15 zeros instead of a countdown.
Steve looked up and saw Bruce looking up at him from his microscope. Bruce’s brows were bunched together and he asked, “Are you okay?”
He rubbed his head and pushed himself up with a grunt.
be that now.
“He survived,” Wade assured him.
The van door opened and Peter had returned with the clothes. He too was back in his civilian clothes and even wore some glasses. He seemed unfazed by their intimate cuddling. He handed over the clothes and said, “I got Pops’ old jeans, but the rest is ‘future wear’ and has been inspected by Fury and deemed okay to wear. He words exactly being ‘So I won’t have to see a naked Stark running around’.”
“Nah, back then I was a War Monger. I…I changed after that though…”
“Yeah, but I think we all were thrown together in times of disaster! He
?” Harry whined.
And Eddie looked so very alone as he walked away.
His eyes had trailed back to the clock and he was reminded of how much time had passed. His wait had been fruitless and the notion was beginning to settle in. Tony had been defeated by a force none of them understood and would continue to hold Steve in its thrall.
Well...not completely alone Pepper was there and Rhodey would’ve been there too if he wasn’t kicking Hydra butt at the moment and Tony wasn’t going to dissuade him from that particular mission.
Still holding onto each other, they wordlessly watched as their pasts played out in the present.
“Why can’t I?” Wade whined.
She felt useless too.
“We’ll…we’ll see you around camp,” Bucky murmured. “Let us know if anything changes…”
“It is made with alien components,” Peter retorted. “They must be skewing the scent… Now, Logan, not that I don’t appreciate your lovely demeanor this early in the morning nor your interest in my suit, but I was very comfortable in Wade’s arms a moment ago and would very much like to return to that position…”
He looked up to Steve and murmured, “I love you too, beloved.”
They reached the French base by the end of the night. The soldiers of the 107
Were the Captain and Stark really in a relationship?
But he was dead. He was never going to get his super soldier back…
“You know exactly why,” Steve retorted and picked up his pace when he saw the enigmatic inventor’s tent.
“Stop hogging all of the warmth, jerk,” Steve murmured and wrapped his arm around him. Maybe Steve really knew why he was shaking, or maybe he thought to share the warmth. Either way, James leaned into his friend with a sigh and let his presence be a distractor.
Tony shrugged and a slight flush stained his cheeks.
Tony’s eyebrows rose and he gasped, “Really? How??”
. Nothing could stop Venom.
The Soldier glared at the woman.
They landed with a breathless oomph and the Soldier’s back was aching from the impact but Natasha chuckled, pressing her face into his chest to muffle it, and he barely noticed the pain.
“I can do that,” Natasha replied.
Wade nodded and Peter crawled up the rest of the wall to reach Wade. He pressed a kiss into Wade’s mouth one more time and and Wade returned the kiss with a smile curling his lips. For a moment, Peter's entire world was him, Wade, and their mouths.
,” Hawkeye intoned as soon as they stepped out.
In the pause in their conversation, Steve heard Bucky’s voice. Tony’s eyes narrowed as he heard him too. He was talking to someone.
! If it weren’t for the serum you would’ve died! As it is, you freaking almost died from
Steve bust out laughing but Tony ignored him in favor of cooing to their son about how handsome he’d look.
The Commandos moved at the front of the pack and Panzer’s team was at the rear so he rarely saw them too.
“I’ll be right back,” he assured his best friend.
Tony recognized the alarm as being an outside priority and was somewhat gratified that the current tower reconstruction would not need additional construction.
“Ow!” Peter said, flinching back from her with a hiss.
She foolishly did not pay much attention to empty tree line behind her.
Peter looked down at the table with a frown then looked back up to Steve. He stated, “But if Aunt Tasha and Uncle Bucky love each other shouldn’t they be together?”
“Be careful,” Steve stated. Peter immediately turned on him, opening his mouth to voice an angry rebuttal, but, Steve raised his hand, silently asking for more time to speak. He continued, “I know he is different with you but, Pete, this is Deadpool. He’ll kill innocents for the right price.”
Tony dropped their hands then leaned heavily into Steve with a pleased grin, melding his body to Steve’s side. Steve instantly relaxed into him and lay his head on top of Tony’s.
Peter’s body was still pulsating with adrenaline from the fight and he stared at her limp form in shock. He almost didn’t believe it had happened because that was not how it worked. Venom did as he imagined and he did not imagine this.
Tony pressed Steve back into the bed for a second time and commanded, “STAY!”
They injected him with something that made him feel weak and dizzy, but it didn’t totally incapacitate him. He swung out at the person hovering over him and sent the dark figure flying through the opposite wall.
“You would be dead right now,” the man behind her murmured.
Tony grasped his arm and corrected, “All of us. It hurt all of us but there’s no way in hell we’re going to let it kill any of us…Be there for Peter, Steve. Keep an eye on that monster, don’t let it hurt anyone else.”
“Welcome, Ms. Potts,” Jarvis announced and Steve spun around with a sponge in hand.
Peter smiled again. His outright joy made Wade smile and his insides feel like gooey, hot, fresh-baked cookies.
Peter made grabby hand motions toward the framed photo with his pumpkin covered fingers. Steve laughed and handed the photo back to Tony and scooped up Peter, murmuring to the boy, “You need to be washed up.”
“Can we please not start throwing around the F word around again?” Steve asked, flushing slightly from Tony’s comment yet he did not push Tony away as he leaned into his side. He was surprised Peter was not cussing already the amount Clint did it.
Steve pressed his mouth into Tony’s with more ferocity and silenced any retort Tony may have had. Any other thoughts Tony may have had disappeared when Steve bent down and picked him up by his thighs, wrapping Tony’s legs around his waist and pressing Tony into the wall.
His friend did not reply and Tony cautiously slid closer to him. He must have been having a nightmare and Tony felt uneasy about invading Steve’s personal space in such a personal moment.
When he first heard the gunshots, he thought his fevered mind was hallucinating.
Tony began to tremble in his arms and Steve worriedly asked, “Are you in pain?”
“Thanks, Sam…” Steve replied.
His breathing shuddered and, with that image in his mind’s eye, Tony made one of the most painful decisions in his life.
Despite his protest, Steve was placed on the President’s detail after being scolded by a very unhappy Coulson.
“I know,” Steve groaned. “It was Tony’s idea…I think he’s regretting it already.”
Steve touched the screen, running his fingertips over the image of Tony’s jaw and swore to himself that they would succeed.
“Is Jarvis going to be okay?” Peter asked Steve. Between Peter’s fingers, Steve saw the dog-tag he had given his son being twirled nervously. Peter no longer wore it around his wrist like he did when he was a toddler but had it on a chain, like Steve’s, around his neck.
Tony was thinking about wanting to ingrain the image in his mind forever when he thought of his phone. Tony stopped breathing for just a second and then slowly pulled out of Steve’s arms just enough to reach for his phone sitting on the bedside table.
One of the men stood and walked over to him, asking him a question in Russian.
But it won’t come soon enough.
Peter grabbed said hips and murmured, “
“I don’t really want to think about it…” Peter murmured more to himself. No one wants to think about their parents having sex.
His entire body shuddered as it reminded him of the phantom pain from his past torture.
“My suit –,” Tony began, grabbing both of Steve’s wrists.
“Yes, Tony,” she sighed. “After the statement is released, you and Steve need to do a press conference. You need to show your faces and show the world you are together: share a kiss, hold hands,
Steve had told him all about Tony: his likes, his dislikes, his parent’s early demise and how it affected him, MIT, his alcoholism, Iron Man, the Avengers, his relationship with Steve…Anything Steve thought Peter could use to get to know Tony better. Peter looked at Tony in a new light but it was not a connection. For a connection to form, he and Tony needed to relax around each other and personally get to know each other…
Hope burned through the cold fear in his chest. Steve would notice his silence. He’d know something was wrong.
“I see you,” Bucky replied.
tell anyone!” Natasha hissed.
Peter nodded sadly, feeling bummed by the fact someone he knew had sold his image to the tabloids. He had hung out with Mac on numerous occasions. They got along. His number was one of the ones he did not delete from his phone. Peter couldn’t believe he’d do that to Peter knowing that it was an invasion of his privacy…
Steve ran over to Coulson and gasped, “My timer is about to run out! Do you have everything handled here?”
And all he had wanted from life was to see the future Tony had told him about…
Eddie met his gaze and whispered, “Do you want me to do it or you?”
Tony broke their kiss with a breathless chuckle and dragged his hands from Steve’s hair to cup his jaw. He gasped against Steve’s mouth, “I can’t believe we’re doing this.”
There was a loud thump in the laundry room and Wade sat up.
“You’re back,” Steve whispered. “We all made it back. That’s all that matters…”
Alright, never mind, Peter wanted him and that simple fact couldn’t make Wade more elated or happier. And Wade loved him. He knew it the moment Peter first kissed him. He knew Peter was nowhere near the “I love you” stage yet but Wade just knew he was irrevocably in love with the younger man. The fact that the person who Wade loved wanted to also be with him was earthshattering…and now one of his fathers was okay with it too?
“Yup,” Tony said. He turned off the car, leaned back in his seat, and turned his head toward Steve. “So you sure you want to talk to them? We could just do some reconnaissance right now…”
Steve’s chest swelled with excitement and he had to restrain himself from hugging Mary. Instead, he wrapped an arm around his husband and Tony happily returned the half hug.
“It’s nothing more than an annoying sunburn now,” Steve retorted. “I heal fast, remember?”
It took Steve a moment to comprehend Tony’s words.
Posting in another week!
Steve groaned and Tony ironically chuckled, “I guess they heard that…”
“Always talking dirty,” Tony sighed heavily. He snuggled deeper into Steve’s chest as all his anxiety melted away in the warmth of his husband’s embrace. He closed his eyes and whispered, “I think I can sleep again…”
but he still didn’t like how similar it was to the 80s-movie monster. As soon as the
“Birthday breakfast time,” Peter declared, pushing himself up by his elbows.
“STOP IT!” He screamed but they were not fast enough. The mass swung the pole at the wires overhead and sliced right through them. The sound of the shrill alarm deceased greatly as most of the speakers lost power or connection to the main computer.
Tony was so tantalizingly close. Steve so badly wanted to just leaned forward and kiss him. Even Tony's gaze was burning into his, teasing and daring him to so.
“Bruce,” Tony stated in the same tone in rebuttal.
Peter looked at Tony guiltily and whispered in a small voice, “I’m sorry.”
Mary wordlessly stepped over to her lab station and pushed the microscope aside. It slipped off the counter and shattered on the ground. She pushed aside some papers and revealed a monitor. It turned on and the notorious face of the Goblin appeared with a laughing grin.
The statement was directed at Tony and his spine prickled.
. He’d clearly changed his ways and stepping out with Steve must have been too weird.
But if this warped reality had Steve in it then Tony did not mind how insane he was.
What did they have planned for him?
Steve cupped his face and pressed their foreheads together. He whispered, “Tony, I love you, I married you, for better or for worse, I will be there for you…I was upset last night but, if you had called, if you had needed me, I would have come…”
“No,” Coulson replied. “Finish your mission for Fury. Don’t worry about us, I’ve got my second best man in New York already. He’s searching Brooklyn as we speak.”
Tony continued, “The one we keep talking about? A dinner date on the roof and dancing in my lab? We don’t have to lie about it anymore if we actually do it. How does that sound?”
He couldn’t remember the last time his skin pimpled.
“You are and it’s adorable,” Tony said, winding an arm around Steve’s waist. “I think I’ll just call you that from now on,
The Soldier glared at Tony and then pushed Steve back and charged toward Tony. Steve grabbed the man by his legs and pulled him to the ground with him.
“You think it’s trying to become one with Peter?” Scott restated breathlessly.
He didn’t notice Steve returned to his side until Peter’s wet hands grabbed at his shirt.
“I love your jokes,” Stark murmured, wrapping his arm around Steve’s waist and pressing their hips together. Wade was tempted to take a picture of the scene, his hand even twitched in the direction of the phone in his pocket.
It was a digital watch but it had no face. It didn’t tell time and was just a peculiar accessory.
“I can go three days without any sleep and can probably go longer if I continue not to do any strenuous labor,” Bucky stated without looking away from the screen.
Barnes’ eyes flickered emotionlessly from Tony to something over his shoulder. With an equally emotionless tone, he stated, “Tell me her name.”
Pepper was sitting down. She had to sit down. She stared at the same information Tony was with large eyes and a white knuckled grip on her phone. She saw him looking at her and gasped, “Do…Do you think Phil is…?”
He couldn’t lose another friend, not like this, not in front of him again. He gasped aloud, “
Behind him, he heard Tony’s espresso hit the ground and splash all over the floor. Steve spun around and his eyes focused on the back of Tony’s head. The other person in front of his boyfriend was shorter than him and pressed into Tony’s personal space, making him or her virtually impossible for Steve to see.
“You and Pepper need to trade notes,” Tony observed, already fearing the deadly force.
Steve ran as soon as he was able with his possible location. The rest of the Avengers followed closely in formation. Natasha was the closest to him with only a few feet separation them. The rest were fanned out or, in Thor’s case, flew above him. When they were close enough to hear the Goblin laughing, Steve slowed them down and they cautiously approached.
“You wouldn’t happen to know if the Army carries baking soda, would you?”
Tony wanted to get the scan over with before Steve got home. After the whole Mandarin fiasco, he and Steve had gotten into their first real fight since they’d reunited. Steve had obviously been upset that mercenaries tried to kidnap their son, had managed to destroy their home, and then very nearly kill his fiancé all in one day. Both of them were actively trying to fix it and every day it got a little better.
Tony placed his hand on Steve’s thigh and Steve jerked in surprise but he did not freeze.
Tony slid into Steve’s lap as soon as the elevator opened for her and murmured into Steve's lips, “We, my beloved husband, are going to relieve some stress”
“Aren’t those supposed to be my words?” Steve laughed. This relationship was a
Most nights, the dreamscape was created by Tony, depicting a landscape he craved. Mostly, it was ocean scenery or of his own home in Malibu.
Fuck this Steve for somehow knowing or guessing that anyway. Tony had been content to ignore the damn berries and all their taunting (
“And that’s bad?”
“I’m putting some arnica on that back before you go trying to put leather and kevlar on.” Barnes muttered some kind of protest, but Clint wasn’t having any of it. “I know this sucks, and I know you’re probably still down far enough that you want the pain to linger more than you want to be comfortable. But I’m not allowing you to start out a fight at any kind of a disadvantage. Arnica or you don’t come with us for this one.”
It wasn’t in Steve’s nature to stop. He pressed and badgered and pushed because that was the stubborn little punk he’d always been, according to Bucky at least. He barely knew how to stop, even when he knew he’d be risking everything. But then, he wouldn’t be the one taking on the risk in this instance. Natasha wasn’t scared for herself, she was protecting someone else, so maybe for now it could be enough to know that she
“Peter Parker is on-site.”
Cap offered up this account like it was nothing, as if it didn’t have the potential to change everything Tony knew about Steve Rogers. Their entire war over the Accords had practically revolved around Rogers’ refusal to see the issue as anything with more nuance than ‘government bad, individual liberties good.’ Tony had definitely made his own mistakes along the way too, but every time he’d tried to get Cap to see that there was anything resembling a middle ground, he had entirely shut down. Tony knew the Civil War hadn’t happened here, and that Rogers was somehow the head of SHIELD, but this was the first bit of real, concrete evidence of just how different this version of the man was. For just a few seconds, he let himself mourn the fact that this version of Cap had absolutely zero romantic interest in Tony. Apparently, said mourning may have lasted beyond a few seconds, because eventually Cap’s expression began to morph from patient neutrality to something more resembling concern. (Tony still kind of hated subspace right now. It was making him too slow and way too obvious.)
“I can try to buy you a bit more time, Talia, but—” She shook her head.
to wait. I will, I swear I will kiss you goodnight and take you to your floor if that’s what you want, but if you don’t, please may I take you to bed now?”
That point was pretty much impossible to argue, and Natasha had been only too happy to take on a bit more responsibility in his absence. (Even in the midst of everything, he’d taken a moment to feel painfully proud of how far Natasha had come. She hadn’t initially wanted the promotion at SHIELD; she’d avoided Steve for weeks to try to prevent him from having the opportunity to even ask. And now here she was practically pushing Steve out the door.) She had even leaned up on tip-toes to kiss Steve’s cheek, which wasn’t a remarkable gesture unless one knew anything about Nat; she never willingly did things that called attention to the size disparity between herself and (most of) the rest of the team unless she was deliberately soothing a Dominant. He’d wound his arms around her gratefully, pressing a kiss to the top of her head.
“Stevie.”
Some part of Tony must have assumed aftercare wouldn’t be as important a part of this to Clint as it had been to Bruce, because he was stunned by what unfolded over the next several hours. Clint washed them both down with a soft, wet cloth, and then insisted on giving Tony a full body rubdown. It was evident within minutes that Clint hadn’t been trained; he didn’t touch with the gentle skill of a professional, but with the targeted focus of a soldier, someone who knew major muscle groups primarily in the context of treating them after injury or strain. It still felt damn good, and he talked almost constantly to Tony as he did it, practically showering him with the praise and affection he’d been so sparing with during the scene. (And he didn’t seem offended or even particularly alarmed that Tony cried a couple of times, either.)
“Permission to alter the Thursday protocol?” Phil had drank almost half a bottle of scotch single-handedly, so the formality of this request would have once surprised many in the room. But like his teammates, Clint had long since learned that until his lover reached the tipping point into complete inebriation, his diction and speech tended to grow more, not less, precise. (Probably about a 6 on the scale, then.)
The reality of that truth just hit Peter harder the longer he let himself think about it, until soon there were tears mixed in with the vomit and snot. Given that he’d gotten his start in the superhero business through a radioactive spider bite he had sort of assumed he would never again manage to hit his ceiling for gross-out material, but this was definitely coming close.
I don't think there's any content notes needed for this one. There are mentions of asexuality and sex work, but both in supportive contexts; the third ask also contains a reference to the potential intersections of religion, sexuality and orientation. I should warn that all of these particular responses are more informative in nature; a vision may be posted later in the week (depending on whether it ends up in the main chapter or not during editing, to be honest!) As always, let me know if you have any questions or concerns.
………….oral fixation……..and some objectification, obviously.”
“My apologies, Sir. Would you prefer I alter the settings to Easy mode?” JARVIS was a troll in every universe, apparently, and Tony couldn’t possibly be more grateful for that than he was right now. He tapped at the housing unit on his chest, and the in seconds the armour was greeting him like an old friend. The suit was battered from its final encounter with Thanos, but its metal embrace was no less comforting for that. “Sir, the Avengers are requesting updates as to your status. Shall I place the room in Blackout mode until you’re finished?”
“Stop trying to figure out where I am or I’m gonna hang up, man.” Then Rhodey sighed, something deeper and more frustrated than his usual annoyance at Tony’s antics. “I had hoped it would take longer for them to do this. I wanted to be back in the Tower by then so I could be sure they weren’t, I don’t know, rushing you or something.”
“We shall have to work on your impulse control in public, Talia. In private, however…I hope you never lose that enthusiasm.” She was still smiling when she turned to face Steve fully for the first time. “Captain, I believe you have your answer.” Steve beamed, too.
, not ever again.) The only thing more unendurable than staring at all of these traces of Tony in this space that he’d loved best in the world was the thought of leaving and returning to find them all carefully hidden away, like Tony had never existed in the first place.
“I know we aren’t,” Pepper smiled. There was just a hint of sadness, or maybe pre-emptive exhaustion in her expression. (He wished that even once choosing the right path for SI and the public’s future wasn’t going to make Pepper’s life so much more challenging in the present.)
“I’m ready, Bruce. Please, I need…please.”
And now the ball is finally rolling! Your comments and kudos on part one were very much appreciated; I'm already having so much fun talking about this fic with you all! Please keep them coming; questions, specific moments/scenes you liked or are looking forward to, I love hearing it all!
“Not…not the worst idea, though I admittedly lose a lot of my appeal as a date if I can’t really spend money during the wooing part.” No one laughed. They all did that thing where they looked kind of sad and mad, and then awkwardly tried to conceal both those responses from Tony. He’d learned that usually meant they were pissed at their counterparts in his universe, and he still hadn’t decided how he felt about that.
“You can’t tell them. Or…or him. Nothing good ever came of him knowing me, Natasha. I need you to promise me that you’ll never even breathe his name to me or to anyone else ever again after tonight. Keep an eye on him, keep him as safe as you can from a distance, but never let him so much as get a whiff that you or any of the Avengers are involved. Will you do that for me?”
Then Spider-Girl rounded the corner nearest to where he and Tony stood. Peter flashed her a thumbs up, because even though he had about a hundred questions, he was hardly about to go against Team Spidey! Even standing so close, Peter wasn’t sure what happened next. Even with the improvements he felt could have been made to her webbing, there was no visible reason she should have fallen out of the air and landed with a thud on the mats below. He stepped forward, eager to make sure she was alright, but Tony held out a restraining arm.
“Not willingly, Agent Coulson, and I do apologize. But Mr. Stark was accorded all the administrative privileges that the other Mr. Stark had. This means that if I am strictly instructed to misinform other members of the team about his whereabouts or condition, I must do so.” The reminder left a sour taste (AvalonAvalon fucking Avalon) in Steve’s mouth. Pepper rubbed a hand across her face, muttering something about Tony being in for a spanking or five. Clint snorted bitterly.
I continue to adore your questions, comments, and kudos. They make returning to this fic, even after so long and so many words, a delight. Thank you <3
“I had assumed…hoped, maybe, that we could wait to address this until our mission was complete.” Talia’s arms were crossed against her chest, a show of anger and resistance entirely too familiar to Steve. But her hands, he noted, were not stiff or clenched into fists. They were gripping at her sides in the merest hint of a self-hug. (This defiance wouldn’t last long. It was already costing Talia everything she had to maintain even a semblance of her usual bravado.)
“Someone needs to tell her kids.”
“It’s going to be okay, Tones. You’re gonna be okay.”
Steve was rattling around the kitchen in search of Thor’s juice and the pixie stix he tended to inhale after scenes when he heard it. That was…well, it definitely sounded like moaning. Was Tony’s side bothering him again? If it was bad enough to have him up in the penthouse in the middle of the day, making those kinds of sounds…
Another round of painful vomiting had followed this declaration, which basically destroyed any chance Peter had of arguing with this unflattering description. Instead, he’d settled for attempting to pry a promise out of MJ that she wouldn’t call in Steve or anyone else, no matter what. It wasn’t really a fair request to make, some part of him knew that. MJ seemed truly and honestly scared now, and as brilliant as she was it wasn’t as if she was some kind of expert in the interactions between Thor-juice and Peter’s unique physiology. He couldn’t quite bring himself to care just then about what was fair, not when his entire life as of late felt like a parade of ridiculous misfortunes. MJ had sighed, tucking his hair back out of his face and thoughtfully not commenting on any particles of…stuff that may or may not have adhered to any of those stands.

at Steve for days now. He held himself stiffly, all military bearing except for the way his arms were wrapped around his own midsection, as if he were recovering from or preparing for a blow. There was stubble on his face, too, and this version of the guy had always been clean-shaven; his sudden resemblance to his counterpart’s post-Civil War aesthetic made Tony want to sob. He ached to curl up at Steve’s feet and beg for forgiveness until his knees ached and his throat was hoarse. He wanted to run from this room and never have to meet Steve’s hurt, bewildered gaze ever again.
This did mean that by the time anyone else was up and moving around the penthouse, Tony had already put the finishing touches on the SI mission statement as well as several project proposals. Steve walked in, took one look at the haze off screens surrounding Tony like thick New York smog and sighed softly. Tony quickly went on the offensive.
“Ah, so subs are made out to be overemotional and needy and doms—what, lemme guess. Dominin makes them sexually aggressive and unable to control themselves, right?” Bruce, who has heard some of the most outrageous of Tony’s behaviour and never so much as batted an eyelash, looks at him like he’s out of his entire damn mind. “Uh…it’s possible I was mapping some bullshit stereotypes from my universe onto yours.”
The silence stretched on, endless and brutal. Finally Bruce stepped forward and put a cautious hand on Tony’s shoulder.
Tony again.)
“Shh. You’re fine.” Where it had been stuttering and anxious just minutes before, Bruce’s voice had dropped into that lower, smoother cadence that Tony had come to learn meant he was feeling the press of Dominance. “You just need to slow down. This is about getting food into you, but in our world it’s about more than that. It’s a way for a Dominant to demonstrate commitment and attention, and it’s a way for the submissive to place an immediate, essential need in their Dominant’s care. You are under no pressure to eat more or less than you want, or at any particular pace. Your only job in the world right now is to enjoy, and to tell me if you want more or less of something in particular. Let’s try again.”
The food was amazing. It had apparently been Thor’s turn to choose the menu, and he had requested grilled cheese and tomato soup. It wasn’t quite like any version of either food Peter had ever had before—the soup was homemade with fresh tomatoes and a whole host of fresh herbs and spices, and the sandwiches were on fresh bread and had to have at least three kinds of cheese in them. It was still close enough to a familiar comfort food, though, that Peter found himself less aware that he was eating dinner with a room full of superheroes than he might have expected.
“Definitely not.”
It was finally the end of an extremely long first week home. Steve all but threw himself at the couch, landing with enough force that the furniture slid several inches across the hardwood floor and nearly sent Clint falling off the arm. It had been ages since Steve had forgotten his body’s strength like that, and he winced as he inspected first Clint and then the floor for any damage.
Dr. Chimva has also reserved the right to request other material (including brain/body scans) depending on the results of the original workup.
“So Tony wants…what, to refuse to do the test? Hit SI first so that if they ask for it it ends up looking like they’re just grasping at straws?”
“Nononono I can’t I can’t, Steve I swear—”
“This isn’t really my jam,” he said, waving lackadaisically at their surroundings. “Besides, I don’t have a scratch on me.” From his spot on the bed where Bruce was using a portable x-ray to scan his ankle to ensure he hadn’t reinjured it, Clint snorted.
“No interrupting, Stark. Yes, it stimulates desire and that

There was an ominous series of noises which included gunfire, angry yelling in at least three separate languages, a repulsor blast, and then the unmistakable sounds of the War Machine armour taking off. (Rhodey wasn’t panting, and the screams hadn’t sounded pained, which meant it had probably been some kind of training thing, or maybe a really low stakes op. The gunfire and repulsors had been used to frighten or instruct, not wound. Phil had been muttering something about Italy recently—)
“Different subs have unique ways of marking the division between their regular and submissive selves, especially before an actual scene. You’ve seen how some of us do it: Phil hands us his worries. Thor usually starts by being bound. For those for whom baths are effective, it’s usually the fairly literal symbolism that’s appealing—washing away the worries of the day, presenting yourself clean and fresh to your Dominant.”
“Not to you. To Tony.” Especially given how Tony had died (the Avalon protocol, Steve might never forgive him that even in death) it shouldn’t have surprised Steve that Tony had prepared for this moment. Tony’s orientation had never once made him afraid or unwilling to go behind Steve’s back, or right in front of his face, and do what he thought was right. (Beautiful, insolent,
The documents were, as Coulson had said, quite preliminary. There were half-finished profiles of potential members, a mission statement that was a disjointed mess, and incomplete designs for some kind of deep space facility called The Peak. (That last one made Tony shudder. If the Battle of New York had made him wary of space, his full on Lost in Space experience post-Titan had virtually guaranteed that Tony would have zero interest in ever returning. Still, maybe there was a way around that somehow? He didn’t have to physically be there for the program to work, did it?)
“Oh bull
Peter had learned in the past several months that Steve, while commanding and forceful on the battlefield, was also a socially awkward and lonely guy who seemed to crave company without having the first clue as to how to really be around people. This tended to mean that the two of them spent a fair amount of time in awkward silence, a trend with which Peter generally felt fine. Given that this was Steve’s fourth attempt at starting a conversation, though, he seemed to have other plans now that they were roomies.
“You want to know first,” Rhodey finished. “I get it.”
“Tell me what you want me to do.”
Bucky didn’t call Steve on his bullshit, too focused on guiding him from the room as quickly as possible. The door clicked shut with a terrible finality, and before Steve could bother asking, JARVIS offered his usual assurance that he wouldn’t permit entry to anyone without proper access codes.
“Not yet,” he smiled, then acted quickly to get Talia distracted with some of the administrative details of the pilot program before she could ask any follow up questions.
With the kind of timing that only happened in really terrible movies, Steve stepped out of the elevator no more than three seconds later. His hair was wet, his face flushed, and he had paired a beautiful plum silk button-up with a terrible pair of khakis; the latter was especially odd given that this version of Steve had a way more evolved sense of style than his counterpart had ever had the time or inclination to develop. But Tony wouldn’t have cared if the guy had entered the penthouse in an Easter Bunny costume, because he was
“We’re gonna get along just fine kid.”

“Keep track of intel. Construct a timeline once there’s enough to go on.”
The return of that knotted feeling in her stomach made her angry and tired. She let the door open a little harder than usual and scanned the apartment warily. Peter, it turned out, was not hard to find. He was sitting on the couch in the dark, grasping something small in his right hand. When he heard May enter, he turned to face her with red-rimmed eyes. His hand fell open, revealing a Lego mini figure in a purple vest and matching pants. Weighted down by a familiarity with death and an overdeveloped sense of responsibility, Peter usually looked far older than his age. But right now he seemed impossibly, heartbreakingly young, and all of May’s frustration and exhaustion vanished in the face of it. She kicked off her shoes, put down the leftovers, and stood before her nephew, who immediately buried his face against her hip.
Pepper’s hands slid from where they had been planted on her hips down to her sides. She sighed, long and tired and exasperated, and shoved her way past Rescue to press a kiss onto the top of Tony’s head.
“Aren’t you gorgeous,” Steve murmured, stopping to tweak at Thor’s nipple. The motion was clumsier with the mitt on, but Thor didn’t appear to mind all that much. “All this power. All this strength, held here for me in these ropes. Rope you
The same astounding tears that Tony remembered seeing on Nat’s face in the aftermath of her scene with Bucky and Clint were back, this time as a steady stream rather than a set of frustrated bursts. He wondered if maybe Natasha could only ever let herself go enough to do something like cry during or immediately after scenes, and then he felt a sick swoop of guilt at the idea that his presence had perhaps left her wondering if that outlet would be available to her anymore.
“As always, Tony Stark, you were the very last thing any of us could ever have expected.” (Oh no, there were already tears pooling in Steve’s endlessly blue eyes. Tony was never going to make it out of this with his dignity in tact.) “I certainly never expected to love you. Contrary to what you might think, and even what I thought at the time, that had nothing to do with you and everything to do with me. I thought—I thought I had lost that part of myself forever. I was sure the most I could do was just…hold on to the people I still had, try to give them a shadow of who I used to be and hope it was enough. But not falling for you was always going to be a lost cause. How could anyone watch you, fresh off of saving one universe and throwing yourself wholeheartedly into learning another and making it better, and not be inspired? Not want to make themselves into someone worthy of even being around you? I’m still not sure I’m there yet, but I’ll try like hell every day for the rest of my life to stay worthy of you, of the partnership we all share.”
Also, not a warning but just a reminder that one of the slight changes I made to the MCU was that Tony and Steve spent a bit more time in the 70s than they did in Endgame.
He sat down on the edge of the table and offered the little black disk to Clint. The other man splayed his palm out, but when Tony tried to drop the magnet into it, Clint caught his hand and threaded their fingers together, just as he had that day in the kitchen with Barnes. (The part of Tony’s brain that had felt permanently aroused since his little experiments the other day was practically doing somersaults to remind him how strong and competent Barton’s fingers had felt that day, how much manual dexterity Clint would have to have to wield guns and especially bows the way he did.)
Content Notes: The second of the Doctor's responses contains mention (not graphic) of recurring miscarriages and struggles with fertility.
With a harried gesture, he closed all the open windows containing evidence of his (well, the team’s, really, but Phil was the one in charge of keeping the records up to date) current project: piecing together the pieces of this new version of Tony Stark’s life.
now?” Tony demanded, rising to his feet and tossing aside a string of silver garland. Drama immediately got into a tug of war with Dummy over it.
“No. If he sticks to form it’ll be days before he surfaces again. I’ve already lifted the blackout here and at SI, but I’m keeping the extra set of eyes on your place and at May’s work. Just until we can be sure he didn’t pick up on you being at the scene.”
“Do SHIELD people literally just work out all the time? Is this a building full of himbos?” Peter wondered aloud, largely to try to keep his mind off of his nerves. Tony snorted.
“Seriously, Brucie, you’re either going to feed me or I’m going to make off with that plate of desserts and not be seen for several days. Make up your mind and do it quickly.”
Despite all the hoopla about Trues, submission had never come naturally or easily to Tony. He hated it for many reasons, but the most humiliating one was how often he was incorrect in his guesses about what his Dominant wanted or needed. In some cases it was because he’d been so frustrated and angry to need the submission in the first place that he hadn’t bothered to ask or observe enough about the Dom to have a real sense of their desires or expectations. But even when he’d
accept this.”
“What about SWORD?”
“It’s not morphine. Doctor Tesfaye has some experience with enhanced kids, it’s why I had you brought here in the first place.” This was, Tony would have argued, barely a lie. The fact that he had been the one to give her the formula a few mights ago was a minor detail.
“Dead,” Steve says mournfully.
Natasha had then reported, in the flattened tones Phil recognized from plenty of after-action debriefs, that in Tony’s world he had faced the Mandarin alone, with some aid from Colonel Rhodes. (No wonder Tony always looked to his friend so much in this world; increasingly it sounded like Rhodes and Pepper had been his only constants.) Phil added that under the category that specifically tracked divergences in major Avengers-level threats, right below ‘didn’t know Steve was head of SHIELD until told.’
Before anyone gets mad at me (slight spoilers ahead for the Peter arc) please know that I love May, and this story will not be painting her as some kind of cruel or negligent parent in order to bring Peter and Tony closer together. She's been under an incredible amount of stress for a very long time, and her actions in this chapter.
“I’m sure you have, but we really need to focus up here. Tony, JARVIS said you have questions about the SHIELD program that I could help answer? Also, what does the robot sheep want?”
Tony’s—heavy blanket out from inside a rarely used ottoman. He meant to hand it to the other man, but somehow found himself winding it around Tony’s shoulders instead. Tony started, but then sank into the couch with a quiet moan.
“The little blue thing?” Natasha said incredulously. “The whole world of fantasy pop culture mashups and you go with that?”
Tony accomplished the things he did. They were interested in the results, not the process. More than once they’d actively shut Tony down when he’d tried to explain the logic or mechanics of his actions. And here Clint was, looking utterly bewildered and almost hurt at the notion that Tony hadn’t planned on offering that information.
Tony was still tingling from a combination of science and post-date high the next morning when he stepped into the kitchen to hear a voice coming from the ceiling. It did not, despite Thor’s jesting the day before, belong to JARVIS.
Tony landed on his behind painfully and he ripped the flailing octo appendage off of his neck. Peter took the opportunity to sucker punch the doctor and the man’s “superior intellect” was no match for Peter’s physical strength as he fell back unconscious from one hit.
Peter halted and his head snapped up. Bucky and Natasha were back.
Peter stared at him with a pinched brow, not understanding. Was Wade somehow structuring their lives into chapters? Wade sighed and said, "Nevermind..."
Both Scott and Bruce’s eyes widened and Bruce gasped, “How is that possible?”
“Tony –
“Hey, now, I know your brow is sexy but we are not starting anything with our son minutes from getting here,” Steve teased. “We’ve scarred him enough by this point…”
”I’m alright!” Wade yelled as he tried to assure him but Steve used his superior strength and pushed the man down.
“So I won’t mortify him to death?” He teased.
When Steve reached the garage, he paused at its mouth and took off his helmet. He looked up and studied the skyscrapers around him.
Tony grumbled nonsense in reply. Steve had been in a good mood all night and now it looked like it leaked into morning.
Tony unbuttoned the top button of his shirt and asked, “Ready now?”
Yay! I got the next chapter out in a week!... Only because I didn't sleep! DX
Tony broke the kiss and grumbled, "But, really, Steve.
And he wasn’t whisked away to another era or frozen.
When they returned, Tony was cleaned up and his arm was in a sling, but he was still smiling. They were in each other’s arms again in seconds and Tony murmured, “I’m going home.”
“He stepped out this morning, said he needed to get something,” Tony murmured then yawned loudly. His boyfriend’s lips twitched into a smirk and he added, “A
The shock in Gabe’s expression doubled and he gasped incredulously, “Y-You two are an item?”
Bucky did not think. He just leaned down, closed his eyes, and kissed Natasha. Natasha jerked in his hold and for a moment, he imagined her relaxing into his kiss.
“Can we just jump into testing out the goo some more?”
Tony woke to Rhodey jerking his shoulder back and his hand immediately went to his chest.
They set up camp with big smiles and were loudly deducing what kind of state they’d find Zola in. Most depictions were of a scared, filthy man, an image Bucky tried hard to imagine because every time he closed his eyes all he saw was Zola standing over him with a needle or electrodes or a gas mask or…
Tony worked late into the night again and was able to finish the arm by early afternoon the next day.
When he wore the suit…could the nanobots noted the shrapnel and removed it??
To Tony’s surprise, Wade’s cheeks flushed a bright red. He awkwardly replied, “It – um – it’s cool – I mean – thank you? Uh…” He flushed brighter and murmured, “Th-Thank you, Tony…”
“Cat’s out of the bag now,” Tony murmured. “…How long has this been posted?”
On the remains of the floor above him, was an enormous green monster. The SHIELD title for it came to him immediately. “Goblin,” was definitely an appropriate descriptor.
“So I think the cat is out of the bag, Dad,” Peter murmured dryly.
“Yes,” Steve suddenly said into the phone, answering a question from Peter. “No need to be so formal. Please, call me Steve.” He was talking to Peter Parker! He was talking to his son! Was it a good thing that he called so soon? That little glimmer of hope he felt yesterday grew into a massive inferno. What would Tony say to him?
Peter sat next to him with a smile. Playing dumb, he asked, “So how do you know Stark? You fall into his reactor?”
Peter was tempted to scream,
It couldn’t end like this.
Tony wasn’t there.
Coulson’s attention focused on the shoes. They weren’t Stark’s. Stark would never wear them nonetheless fit in them.
Peggy nodded with a pinched expression and Gabe followed but he looked between Steve and Tony in confusion. He clearly was the only one who had yet to grasp the level of their relationship yet. The Commando whispered to Peggy, “Wha-What is going on??”
She walked up to them, keeping the counter between them, and her back to Bucky. She said, “Good morning, Steve.” She looked to Tony and growled, “Stark.”
“I love you too, honey,” Tony murmured affectionately, drawing a smile back to Steve’s face.
The doorbell rang when he was halfway done with the repair.
,” Tony whined.
Tony grinned to hold back his chuckle. He wasn’t seeing what Steve was in correlation to Tony, but he was glad to hear his loving super soldier wasn’t going to change much when it comes to coddling the people he cared for.
Tony thought he would have to be the one leading but he gladly let Steve take the reins and relaxed into his side. He eyed him curiously, not knowing what else to expect.
Natasha and Clint were the first to appear.
He tossed Tony the bag and it practically landed in his hands.
His mind raced, now free from the cloudy adrenaline boost of the goblin serum. He put the pieces together. The brat’s parents were still in space. The Captain’s face…from the few seconds he focused on it, he remembered it was free of aging. He hadn’t noticed it during the heat of battle but...These were the Spider’s parents but…but the younger versions of them.
The steel she had originally seen in his cold eyes buckled. He stepped back from her, lowered his gun, and pulled back the arm of his coat on his right arm.
Tony was already imagining the worst. He could already picture Steve being tortured in his mind’s eye. It made him feel sick and he tightened his hold on Pepper.
They spent the drive over talking about clichés and Steve trying to guess if Tony was pulling his leg or not about the plot of some of the movies he described.
Steve clenched his fists, hating Norman more.
Tony dealt with Vanko and started to build a new home in a skyscraper in New York.
Something was
Still shaking his head, Bucky gasped, “This – This can’t be real…I’m dreaming again.”
Tony pulled on his hand and pulled him into his own apartment. Steve whispered in agreement, “Together.”
So Bucky did. He told Steve of when he met Natasha, a young woman, cold and hard under the near lifetime tutelage under the infamous Red Room. He had been assigned to teach her what he knew and was to spar with her so her superior strength could be matched. The beginning was fuzzy to Bucky, but he had a feeling they did not speak much, as they were conditioned to by their masters.
“This isn’t enough for me,” Steve countered, holding up his bar. “My metabolism is burning it up within the hour. I won’t be able to go on much longer…”
He willed Venom to wave at Eddie and a few tendrils rose from his shoulder and waved at the other intern.
“Your parents made your uncle and I swear to keep it a secret,” his aunt hissed, her voice was tight and she sounded on the verge of tears.
Wade flinched back, pulling Peter protectively into the conclave of his chest. Wanda, however, threw up her hands and put up a pink shield between their half of the hall and the Hulk. It turned red upon Hulk’s impact and Wanda fell to one knee from the strong hit.
There was so much he and Tony could have shared…
He only let the bright and moving billboards distract him for a second. He then spun around, looking for a hint of Stark Tower. He knew it was in Manhattan but he and Tony never really discussed exact coordinates. They never had a reason to.
Steve snorted, picking up the other two bears and thanking the confused teen.
Clint nodded but his breathing remained somewhat shallow.
He was already imagining picket fences, the happy smile of his soulmate and the laughter of their children.
“It’s me, Petey,” Steve replied in a hushed voice.
This must’ve what his father felt like when he first saw the Mark 15.
Tony stalked up to him then grabbed the front of his shirt and demanded, “
Did he just say –?!
Peter could collectively feel the studio audience and the half a dozen camera’s focus on him and he felt a slight pull of apprehension deep in his gut. He’d done several interviews already, but he didn’t think he’d ever grow used to this endless interest in him…
They both were on edge and did not like not being able to do anything. Time seemed to move slowly as the Sinister Six were defeated and rounded up.
Tony smiled warmly at him then lifted the toys up for a second. He said, “I need to take these to the lab. I will be back in a minute.”
He continued like Tony hadn’t said anything (another Pepper quirk that made Tony grin) and Steve said, “I don’t want to come out if I don’t have someone seriously by my side so we need to keep this out of the media.”
But Fury said “was.”
To his teachers, Peter was not the biological son of Steve Rogers, he was just a boy who happened to share the same blue eyes as the infamous superhero like countless others. To the other students, Peter was a shy boy who did not like to play physical sports. They all thought he was sickly but, in fact, Peter had inherited all of Steve super soldier abilities including his strength and healing. Peter was at the pinnacle of health and did not play because he could break the other kids’ bones as easily as snapping a dried out twig.
Because he was starting to disappear just like his dad had.
They followed Hill in with Coulson surrounded on all sides by his Avengers compatriots. Steve couldn’t stop looking at him and he was so happy he felt near to tears.
It pissed Tony right the hell off. After everything this version of the team had been through together, all they had managed to survive and defeat that had damn near destroyed Tony’s universe, and some loser who couldn’t even use the word photographic correctly had brought them to this?
“Yeah, I wonder why? You always did give up so easy!”

“Steve.”
This Stark’s life is in full alignment with the events of the MCU up until the superhero Civil War. He and Pepper Potts never reunited as more than friends following their ‘break.’ As such, Stark's recovery from those events was more incomplete, because he had very little in the way of support.
“Yeah. That’s where we’re heading.”
Somewhere during the middle of this catalogue of  complaints, Tony joined them as well. He kissed Steve, then cast a thoughtful look toward the floor. Steve’s heart began to pound a little faster. Would Tony really choose to be at their feet here, in public? It was the type of thing none of them would have pushed for, but it had been a long week, and the thought of his submissive kneeling for them in front of everyone without shame or fear was a soothing prospect.
Still half-focused on Tony, the other man finally stepped backward several paces, allowing Pepper to make her way into the penthouse proper.
“Question for a question, Tony? Is our data trading system still active outside the labs?” Bruce, Tony would later reflect, might be the most dangerous one here. One expected subterfuge and sneak-attacks from the likes of Nat or Clint or Phil. But this version of Bruce, who had all the piercing brilliance of the Banner in Tony’s own universe combined with what seemed like either heightened emotional intelligence or just the confidence to use it…he could lead you right into a trap and have you smiling the whole way there.
“Good fucking boy, Tony. Such a good boy.” It seemed to cost even Phil something this time, to step backward and straighten the lines of his suit. But he did, because Tony’s mornings were apparently doomed to remain sexless and full of cruelty. (Also because then Phil was collecting Tony’s wrist braces and his blanket from Thor, settling both on him with so much care that he might as well have been defusing a bomb.) “You can dictate today, if you like. I’ll write out whatever you say, precisely as you say it, without editing or commentary—do not take advantage of that offer or it’s not one I will make again,” Phil added, apparently sensing Tony’s deep and entirely mature desire to make him write out one of the sets of lines Bart had scrawled on the chalkboard in his favourite episode of
“Of who, the Board? We’re convening at 10:00 anyway, and honestly I don’t want to see them before that.”
“Well since one of the best ways to encourage team cohesion and ensure we stay competitive is to practice, I would suggest we get started.” During the early and more hopeful stages of his crush on Liz, Peter had watched her devour numerous books on leadership and team-building. He couldn’t help but smile now at hearing her deploy that knowledge to simultaneously shade Flash and move the meeting along.
The problem was that it was a lot easier to take in information about this universe than offer any about his own, even the seemingly innocuous stuff. Nat and Clint had been generally willing to accept that without a lot of pushing; Tony could barely remember what all he'd babbled to Rhodey his first night here, but the team did seem to have a general idea that his version of the Avengers had not been able to pull off the happy-family shtick they did here.
All night Steve had planned exactly how he would bring up the Tony-AI to Peter. He would be kind but firm. He would demand the kid tell him what on Earth he’d been thinking? How could he keep something like that from them?! (From Steve! Who would have given anything just to hear Tony’s voice.)
somewhere else, and that’s easy for us to forget or minimize sometimes because it sounded like it was pretty unhappy in a lot of ways, but it was still a life. I think—I think you don’t know how to face being here, and especially being permanently changed by your presence in this universe, because you weren’t given a choice, and you’re mourning that on top of everything else.”
“He uh…he started refusing to charge. After. So I brought him upstairs to Stevie, told ‘em they had to take care of each other. Turned out their stubbornness was about equal to each other’s, which I didn’t think was possible on either side. Think they mighta saved each other’s lives, to be honest.” Barnes bowed his head, gripping the edge of the workbench for support. “Sorry. This isn’t. It was not an easy time.”
“You need to see him. I’m not trying to hurt you, goddammit Steve, but I know you. If you don’t see his body you’ll convince yourself in a few weeks, a few months on the outside, that he’s somehow still alive. That this has all been some kind of terrible mistake. And the fact that it’s Tony and he’s been declared dead before, not to mention how generally insane our lives are with shit like this…that’ll feed the denial. You’ll be waiting for him around every corner, sure you're about to hear him laugh, see him smile.”
This is it, folks! I decided against an epilogue for this particular story, so this will be the last chapter. (There is, however, a little 'post-credits' scene after the end, so make sure to scroll down for that.) In terms of warnings I don't think there's anything in this one. But as always, please feel free to let me know if you have questions or concerns before or after reading.
If Tony had been told a few hours or days ago that Clint’s entire idea for a scene revolved primarily around talking, he would have been both outraged and horribly disappointed. Now Tony wasn’t sure if he’d even survive. He dug his fingers into his thighs and tried to decide whether closing his eyes to picture the scene or watching Clint’s intense expressions as he spoke would be better. He settled for a kind of hooded stare.
Other Notes: The chapter features (altered) references to some of the storylines in Spiderman: Far From Home. It also references some moments that are more fully fleshed-out in Chapter 11 of the Ask Strange replies.
“You’re almost there, Sugar Cookie.”
“I guess it could be worse. You could be forcing me to bring the kleptomaniac llama.”
“For sure. It made sense to a lot of people; hell, it made sense to me until fairly recently. One of my agents is a submissive; she really struggles with her orientation, and more than once she’s lost work because she avoided headspace for long enough to put her into sub-dep. Then the two of us went to Wakanda. Things are different there. Orientational dynamics shape a lot of workplaces, particularly governmental and national security sectors. Folks in the higher positions—royalty, and high ranking generals, for instance, use Dominance as part of their daily work.  And my agent just…flourished. She was happier and more settled than I’ve ever seen her, not at war with herself for the first time in her life. So I started thinking about why everything had to be all or nothing; why can’t some people bring orientation into work while others can leave it at home if that’s what works for them?”
. He stormed from the room without a word to anyone. En route to the elevator, he heard Tony demand to see Rhodes and then fall silent.
“Too right, Boss.”
This, at least, had brought Peter several minutes of something close to joy as he imagined MJ, clad in some kind of Black Widow-esque getup, coming in through the air shafts or blasting her way through one of the walls. The two of them had been carefully not addressing the status of their relationship ever since he’d left school, but it felt good to know she’d still do something as absurd as infiltrate the Avengers Compound even if he was never more than a friend again.
“Because I trust him to know what I need. What he’s trying to correct here, it’s not just the action but the mentality behind it. He could beat my ass black and blue and never come close to changing that. Sometimes you can only take in so much of those kinds of lessons through the skin, you know?” Tony made a non-committal gesture, and Clint smiled that knowing smile again. “No, you probably have no idea. Not yet, anyway.”
“You seriously hate Stark that much? I know he tried to kill you, but he also gave up a lot to bring you and everybody else back.”
“Thanks, baby girl. JARVIS, you have got to be kidding me. This is the sixth time! The
be sexual, but for subs it’s more than that. It activates a deep and profound desire to please others which, when achieved, brings about satisfaction that most subs describe as deeper and more meaningful than orgasm. There’s also a secondary stimulation of the amygdala, which is why submissives in or near subspace tend to be emotionally raw.”
“What do you need, honey?”
Peter grunted something intended to be an agreement, but which sounded more to his own ears like a cat bringing up a hairball. He watched the person—girl, Tony had said—soar through the air. Her webs were definitely similar to his own, though the compound had some slight differences. Hers appeared to be heavier. She’d probably been going for safety, trying to ensure it stuck harder so she didn’t risk falling, but it sometimes created a drag that cost her valuable seconds, especially when she turned corners or changed direction suddenly. The latter was the case now, as she narrowly dodged a sudden sea of arrows launched by a girl in purple.
“Steeeeeeeeeeeeeve—”Sam hopped up onto the island and took a long swig of beer as he smirked. After a while of the team harassing Steve to try to pick up Thor’s hammer, Sam added,
“Steve was wailing on the thing and it managed to either spit or drool enough that he ingested some of it. He kept hearing all of our voices in his head and assumed he was going insane, so he didn't say anything right away. But finally on the flight home he just yells out, apropos of nothing as far as the rest of us know, ‘what the hell is a Pokemon and why do we have to catch them all? Are they some kind of threat?’ Turned out Clint had been on a major Pokemon Go kick at the time and had been thinking about it all the way home.” Tony laughed too, couldn’t not. It was exactly the kind of ridiculous bonding moment that his own version of the team had just started to have before everything had gone to hell. He was quickly brought back to the present, however, when Bruce took advantage of his distraction to lift his shirt up and poke at the still-healing wound on his abdomen. A couple days of solid rest had done the thing wonders, but a couple of the more jagged edges were still slightly inflamed. “You know, if you tell me what did this I might be able to treat it more efficiently.”
Peter is in hell. There is absolutely no other word for it. Rhodey has everyone gathered in the living room, and is holding each of their left shoes. It’s an old trick, he says, from dealing with Tony. (“He wouldn’t normally get pissed enough to leave with only one shoe on, and when he did I at least had the satisfaction of knowing he looked like a complete fool.”)
“I’ll show you mine if you show me yours?” he offered. Natasha cocked a brow, catching the slightly flirtatious note in Tony’s voice for what it was (so sue him, he’d flirted with Natasha for almost the entirety of their relationship), but then she shrugged and sat down in the armchair across from him.

“On a mission gone very, very wrong. He had only subbed for me once at that poont, and I was so sure I was going to die out there and break every promise I’d ever made him. I wanted him to have something…” She trailed off, and Steve didn’t make her finish. They were all very much aware of the kind of thoughts that the dying or near-death brain tended to dwell on.
“She was…things were different, in my universe. Wanda was an Avenger. She fought alongside us.” Tony hadn’t thought much of the admission, and neither had most of the team. But he’d forgotten his drunken, rambling confession to Cap. Rogers had been mostly quiet through the conversation so far, but at this he sat up straighter in his chair and pinned Tony with a stare.
“In that case we should probably try for something simple to start,” Steve recommended. “A double column tie, anchored to the bar over there?”
“Nope. I’ve gotten entirely too used to my super-soldier pillow thank you very much. And that’s not actually going to solve the problem anyway, just hide it better. Jay, ask the others to meet us in the gym in fifteen minutes.”
However annoyed she might be, Dr. Domen did apparently trust Steve’s word. She asked no further questions about the circumstances that had ended up so dramatically altering their timeline. And though she did have some choice words for him about ‘using the cell phone number she’d given him, with strict instructions to call if and when she was needed, preferably
Anger, at least the all-consuming brand that had dominated Tony since he’d learned of Ultron, also needed to be fed. It had chewed up everything Tony had offered over the past several days it with relish—the years worth of hurt and rage and frustration from his own world that there hadn’t been time to process with Thanos’s arrival always on the horizon; the incontrovertible proof that had they acted on his fears instead of dismissing them, there would never have been a Snap to undo; even what some part of him knew was an unfair obsession with how easy Mark II had seemed to have things was enough to keep it going. Everything Tony so much as looked at seemed to nourish the rage-monster that had taken up residence in his psyche. Even innocents like Rhodey hadn’t been safe from its desire to isolate and destroy.
“I’ve been a fan of the Black Widow for many years. It’s not every day I get passed a note from her.”
“Course, Bruciekins.”
This time it wasn’t Pepper that met Tony at the doors to SI: it was Natasha. She wore a green dress that paired perfectly with her vivid hair and creamy skin. The style, a sleeveless midi, was relatively simple, which highlighted the cut-outs that stretched up Natasha’s right side, revealing glimpses of her muscular back and abdomen. She had paired it with 3/4 length black lace Bolero, which served as her only other protection against the cold of evening. When her eyes fell on Tony her lips quirked upwards just slightly, a perfect, deadly mix of strength and beauty that had him grinning back even through his exhaustion. He barely even registered the flashes of cameras, especially when Natasha strode forward, reaching out to grip Tony around the back of the neck with cool fingers. As a greeting, it somehow felt more intimate than a kiss; he didn’t even have to make himself tilt his own head downward, though after all his training and practicing over the weekend he knew it was expected.
Traditional orientation science argued that before the spike in hormonal levels at 14, there was no way of accurately predicting a person’s classification. And it is true that there is a lot of dubious pseudo-scientific discourse around orientation predictions (somewhat comparable to some of the ‘theories’ that pregnant people refer to when trying to predict the sex of their fetuses.)
“Get out.”
Phil didn’t voice his findings, he never did. He simply guided them over to the couch, reaching up to exert a light pressure on Steve’s shoulders when Steve didn’t automatically sit, but just stood in front of the furniture, numb.
“That definitely means you’re doing it right. I am highly suspicious of anyone who says that being responsible for a kid in any way involves less than constant anxiety. Tell me everything. Spare no detail.”
As his system continues to level off, the majority of his time on vacation is likely to be fairly intensive in its focus on submission. However, part of what Coulson is trying to assess with the writing prompt asked Stark to begin thinking about in Chapter 49 is the extent and ways in which he’s currently imagining submission playing a role in his daily life.
“Jesus. He’s…” Tony was pretty interested to know exactly what Bucky thought he was, but it was also a bit of a relief to know he wasn’t alone in being robbed of the ability to finish sentences. He opened his eyes to find that Bucky had abandoned his chair in favour of kneeling next to the bench, watching Tony with wide, unblinking eyes. When his gaze connected with Tony’s, he smiled. “You’re gorgeous like this, sugar.”
Tony felt himself flush a deep, splotchy shade of scarlet, and let his head hang. He still loved handfeeding just as much as he had that very first time, but god was it embarrassing, especially since it always put him into at least a low level of subspace. And the food thing in general, it was just plain shameful to need to be monitored like this. Now Bruce or another member of the team was going to be forced to abandon urgent and important work just to fucking feed him twice a day?
Sam smiled, with far too much knowing and gentleness to fit her admittedly unflattering and largely un-nuanced view of what superheroes other than Peter were capable of being.
Sometimes being a Dominant was far more about sacrifice than people realized, and this was definitely one of those times. Steve was fairly certain he nearly pulled a muscle trying not to laugh at the realization of just how wrong he’d been. Tony wasn’t upset because Phil had harmed him, or because their scene had gone horribly, catastrophically wrong. He was mortified because Coulson had been so incredibly successful at Domming him
“Sir, s’not, it’s, I can’t—”
“Sit. Down.” Pepper wasn’t a Dom, but Steve, who had been rising to his feet, sat back down on his chair so quickly and hard that she might as well have been. She glared at Tony as if daring him, too, to try to moving, but he knew way better than to bother messing with Pepper when she got in this particular mood. He’d seen her make grown businessmen cry. “Steve, I know you’re angry. But no one is leaving this room in a huff; no one is leaving this room period until we get this sorted out, and believe me when I say you don’t want to test me on this. So get comfortable, boys. We have a lot of ground to cover. Now Steve, explain slowly and calmly, using I statements, what your issues are with the plan Tony has put forward.”
“Whatever magic the Soul Stone used to get you here was powerful but not remotely delicate; it tore a slight hole in the fabric between the universes that could easily be worsened by frequent travel. Even their Strange and myself have limited our communications for this reason. Furthermore, the potential complications to your health given the distinctions between them are significant. If you choose that universe you would not be able to safely return to this one. The same is true of the reverse.”
“You can still have that,” Steve said, voice tight and ravaged with desperation and regret. “You never have to step foot in the armour again. We can protect you, we can—” Tony pressed a kiss just behind Steve’s right ear, and then another on the opposite side.
Thank you all so much, as always, for your kudos and your wonderful, thought-provoking comments and #AskStrange questions. Please keep 'em coming! (And if you haven't seen the latest #AskStrange response, make sure to check that out as well!)
“Are you okay to talk a bit about last night?” Steve asked as he drew Tony’s foot into his lap for a combination wash and massage that had his head wanting to tip back again. The thought of having to actually formulate words made Tony vaguely pouty, but JARVIS had told him that debriefing a scene helped some Dominants through their drop. (Steve needed him. He could do this for Steve.) “Can you tell me something you liked?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Now every set of eyes in the room was on Steve, who groaned. Loudly.
“When we first became…this,” he gestured around the table, “we weren’t all on an even footing. Phil and Nat and Clint knew each other real well, I’d grown up with Stevie, Stevie and Tony had some history, but some of us barely knew each other past the surface stuff. So we dated. Once a week we went out in different combinations and just worked on getting to know each other.”
With a heavy sigh, Natasha drew another piece of wood towards herself, this one finished and one Steve recognized immediately; it was the box that held the spheres Phil handed to his Dominant(s) at the beginning of every scene. He gaped.
This, though, this was getting absurd. They’d been playing hot-potato with Tony’s damn mission report for days now, with Coulson sending constant requests for corrections and clarifications, and Tony trying and apparently failing to fulfill said requests. The whole thing was making Tony long for the days when he’d just refused to fill this kind of stuff out. He stared down at the boomerang arrow for several long second (was it vibrating? had he put some kind of mini repulsor in the shaft, or had that been a fevered dream?), then set it down (cautiously!) on the table in front of him with a sigh.
“Nah. Bucky and Sam are supposed to be up later, and I’ve long since learned that letting them be hungry around one another only makes their tendency to act like toddlers worse.” Peter tried and failed for several seconds to imagine quiet, serious Bucky Barnes or the funny but rigid Sam Wilson acting like a toddler. He was almost relieved when Steve added, “Any, uh, any reason you didn’t get much sleep?”
“Tea?” Natasha offered, dangling a bag between the tips of her middle and ring fingers. “The kettle isn’t off limits, and black tea has less caffeine than coffee. Not technically breaking the rules.”
Peter was laughing before he could inform his brain what a terrible idea that was. It definitely made his head feel like it was splitting open, but it was almost worth it to realize that he could still find momentary amusement in anything, even just the mental image of Captain America making an ass out of himself.
Best Tony could figure, they were even now, he and Cap. Rogers had talked him through his drunken, self-pitying rampage, and Tony had hopefully stumbled through managing Dom-dep without causing any permanent damage. They were square. (So why the hell couldn’t he sleep?)
“It’s just so good to see you! You know? Like, superheroes are great and all, but you’re lucky to be around the ones who are actually a normal age instead of having been frozen and stuff. And I don’t understand what any of them expect from me right now! But you—you’re just—”
Thanks for being patient with me this week, all. Having to miss post last week was unfortunate, but there was just a lot going on. Thankfully, I should be able to keep up with the regular schedule going forward.
As always, take care of yourselves when reading, and feel free to let me know if you have questions or concerns.
“Beyond the paddling you asked Nat for, and the milking with Bruce which was just as much pleasure as it was anything else, we haven’t really had much cause to punish you since this all started. So before we talk about what would be an appropriate way to handle what happened, I think maybe we should discuss punishment a little more generally. How did it work between you and James?” Tony squirmed in his seat, looking everywhere but at Steve until Bruce nudged him in the ribs and whispered something that brought that pretty flush back to Tony’s cheeks.
“For a long time classification was determined entirely based on bloodwork. Certain hormones and neurochemicals spike at 14. Cortisol is by far the most important.” The stress hormone? But that’s that unique to this universe at all, Tony mused, unwilling to interrupt Bruce but feeling entirely skeptical of the ‘science’ of all of this. Bruce appeared to read some of this on his face, though, and smiled. “No, you don’t understand. Part of the reason that it’s mandatory for kids to be intensively immersed in their headspace at that point is that most of them are legally not of sound mind for months. Until they start to get a handle on what works for them, cortisol levels average around 50 micrograms per decilitre.”
The rest of the team assumed Tony had some kind of emotional hangover after the conversation with Peter. He let them believe it, mainly because the fact that Bucky had told them he had a headache that prevented him from joining in on that morning’s conversation made him fairly certain that the other Tony had never acknowledged the significance of this particular date with them. Several of them had to have known—Steve’s memory was a steel fucking trap, and Natasha and Phil always seemed to just know stuff—but like a lot of his deepest hurts, this appeared to have been something Mark II had preferred to cope with in private.
He considered this proposal for all of two seconds after Everhart made a quiet exit. Rhodey and Pepper both knew—Rhodey because of Tony’s disastrous college years, and Pepper because Rhodey had pretty much forced Tony to confide in her once she’d been hired on as his assistant. (He was still pissed about that, but sometimes Tony really needed to kneel or be told he was good, and Pepper always seemed to know. It didn’t feel anything at all like when a Dom would do it, but it staved off the worst of the dep when it got really bad.) The team…if he went to them now, if he took Everhart’s advice and broke it to them personally, he could already predict what would happen. Steve would be quietly concerned, asking questions about Tony’s wellbeing and pretending his True Dom ass didn’t have a vested interest in the answers. Bruce, someone actually informed on the science, would back Steve up, making more pointed inquiries about his hormone levels and other indicators of dep that would be far harder to ignore. Natasha and Thor, though for different reasons, would both be silent in their support. Clint would make a perfectly inappropriate joke, and Coulson would promise any supports Tony needed through SHIELD or outside of it. They’d be kind and understanding and sympathetic and by the end of it Tony would feel so fucking small and worthless that he’d probably leave the damn country and never return.
“Show me how you tap out if you want or need to.” He patted three times at the inner side of her left knee, and she nodded. “Good boy. I have you, Tony. There’s nothing you need to say, now, nothing you need to do, nowhere you need to be.”
Eventually a coffee grinder whirred to life, and pots and pans started being banged together in the kitchen. He gave it a few minutes just in case Steve was trying to make himself something quick and head out before Peter was up and about. Just the opposite proved to be true. By the time Peter made his way into the kitchen, there were stacks upon stacks of thick, golden-brown pancakes and still more on the griddle, a sizzling pan full of bacon, and a heaving bowl full of fruit salad on the breakfast bar. Steve was wearing an apron patterned with what Peter belatedly recognized to be the Starship Enterprise. He must have caught Peter staring at the apron, because he looked down at himself and chuckled.
