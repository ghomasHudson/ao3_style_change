, of course, but just because he’d probably get into even more trouble when he laughed at their suggestion.
The room he’d walked into was bigger than the rest by at least twice the size, and was arranged in a circular formation, all of the equipment and counters centred around a large machine in the middle of the room. Steve eyed it with a cocked head and a small frown, trying to work out what it could be. Although he had to admit, this was probably more Tony or Bruce’s forte than his. To him, it really just looked like a big hunk of metal. There were wires, however, that were attached up at the top of the machine and then fed into various tubes at the sides of the room. Steve squinted and wandered closer. “Widow?” He asked quietly, fingers tapping his comm, “did the source tell you whether it was human experimentation they were working on?”
“After your lesson, if you want,” Steve said, unable to hold back his foolish smile as Tony’s eyes widened in excitement.
They were happy. Steve could hardly fathom it, some days, but he really, truly was.
He’d never thought of it like that. Never even considered, for a second, that Steve’s grumpiness was anything other than surface-level irritation that could be changed with some well-placed chocolates and pumpkin-themed socks.
Steve made a face. “You’re two months older than me, Barton.”
He looked down at Tony with a raised eyebrow, before leaning forward and popping a delicate kiss against his hairline. “No,” he said simply, “I don’t.”
Natasha was right. This wasn’t something Tony could afford to get wrong. He clenched his jaw and then gave the mental command, letting the Iron Man suit materialise around him in answer. She nodded. “Check in and keep me updated,” she commanded, knowing that even in T’challa’s jet, she’d be at least half an hour behind Tony. He put his arms down by his sides and made to launch, but she grabbed his arm before he could and looked at him seriously. “Be careful and stay alert, Tony. You know what HYDRA are like. Don’t let them get inside your head.”
He felt a pressure settle down against his shoulder, a soothing voice. “Steve?” It said, “Steve, come on, breathe with me baby, get your head out of the pillow so you can take in some air, it’s okay, I’m here, I’m sorry.”
with fury as he hurdled the couch like it wasn’t even there. Tony yelled and took off after him, but he knew it would be no use- Steve was faster and stronger than him anyway.
Steve shook his head. “They’d flip their shit if they knew what I was doing.”
He spat more blood. He’d been stripped down to an undershirt and what remained of his trousers, cut and ripped from scuffles and knives. Maybe it had been more than three days, now he thought about it. He was so hungry. And tired. But they wouldn’t… they wouldn’t let him sleep. Or eat, or even sit properly. He was chained to the ceiling, and if he dropped any lower than his knees he’d be choked to death. It left him looking like he was begging at whoever came into the room- which, he figured, was the whole point.
Tony had been busying himself with picking at a thread on the bedsheet, but when Steve finished, he paused and looked up. Swallowed. “Steve,” he said gently, “you’re… I don’t think you’re gonna be able to just walk out of those doors, you know.”
“So that’s Thor,” he declared with a grin, “he’s one of my favourites. You’d love him. I know I say that about all my friends, but you would. Thor is like- like sunshine or something.” He crossed his arms and felt his teeth start to chatter. God, it really was freezing. “I don’t think I’m gonna stay much longer. But it’s December, so I just wanted to stop by, say hey. I miss your stupid cookies.”
Later that night, when Steve broke the news that he was actually Officially dating Tony to his two friends, they’d gone and had another celebratory night in the bar, but this time, they’d taken Tony with them. The newest member of their group.
For now, he just leaned his forehead into Tony’s shoulder and tried not to hate himself too much for it.
Steve shrugged, letting his thumb brush up against Tony’s bottom lip for a moment, before he ducked down and pressed a soft kiss there.
Tony had to hand it to them, they didn’t even blink. Bruce just sighed and Natasha told them to have fun.
Across the road, the man was still shouting things, and Steve didn’t hear a word of it. He took off running, barging past people, slipping in the slush under his feet as he narrowed the distance down and down and down and down. The body on the floor wore the same coat as Tony, buttoned up to the throat, ending at the top of his thighs. A gloved hand rested, relaxed, upon the icy concrete.
“Did the footage reveal anything else of interest?” Thor asked with a deep frown, folding his arms into his chest and pulling his jaw tight. “anything we could use to find them?”
“Thought you didn’t even like him?” He asked Sam, his eyebrow raised. In front of him, Sam just shrugged, looking a little sheepish.
With that, he ended the call before any of the people on the other line could respond. He didn’t know how they’d managed to get his number, and he didn’t much care either. A second later he’d blocked it anyway, so it stopped being his problem.
managing pretty well.”
“Tony,” Steve asked, raising an eyebrow and grabbing his shoulders between two hands, “what’s wrong?”
The bag. The money. His phone.
“You know I’m trying to look out for you, right?” Bucky asked anxiously, “I know I’m an asshole and I know I acted like an idiot last night, but I promise, I didn’t mean to- to control you or anything, I just…” he looked down, and then turned to face Steve with a sad smile. “You’re pretty much all I got, pal.”
Anthony Stark is not Good With Emotion.
Of course, he failed.
Thor made an apologetic face, until the moment his eyes caught on the box in Steve’s hand and all pretences of sorrow were immediately replaced with lustful desire. “You went to Dunkin Donuts,” he exclaimed.
When Steve eventually came back out of the bathroom, Tony heard him stop at the foot of the bed. “I know you’re awake, sweetheart,” he said, his voice tired. Soft.
He watched Steve as the man applauded Peter’s excellent work, bouncing him up and down in his arms excitedly and looking over at Bruce and Tony every two seconds to make sure they were still watching in case Peter said anything else. The last time Tony had seen the guy this happy was probably when he’d been introduced to Meryl Streep that one time back in 2013, which was saying something, because Steve
He looked up at Steve as the man towered over him, and even then, he loved him.
Pulling out his phone again, he checked the teacher wasn’t looking his way before pulling up Tony’s contact again.
Steve, who was behind Tony, quickly shoved his ass and sent him stumbling forward. “MOVE!”
On the floor, Ty rose shakily onto his hands, catching Steve’s eye as he was dragged backward along the corridor. A fresh wave of hatred burned through him, and he almost dislodged himself from the set of hands entirely as he struggled. “HOW COULD YOU!” He screamed to the bastard, “HOW COULD YOU DO THAT TO HIM!”
Oh God, he was soaking. Head and shoulders, drenched in water, and it was clean water, he
“He shot me, Steve,” Tony’s voice was hoarse, as if he’d been talking all day as opposed to his uncharacteristic silence, “that man, Redford,
“What are you looking for?” Natasha asked as she watched Tony tug the bot’s collar down a little and pull up his hair.
Steve didn’t turn down his gaze. He’d never been the first one to back down, ever- probably the cause of 80% of all fights he’d been in, if he was honest.
Tony nodded and strode forward, taking in all the décor with a lip curled in distaste. Seemed HYDRA were still digging the ‘1970’s Soviet Russia’ look, which was ultimately unsurprising. They probably looked wistfully back on those times. He unlocked another door and slipped through, checking the corridor for threats. But there were none. It was silent—eerily so.
Tony said, exasperated, “I already told you. I am a grown-ass man, I do not need-”
“Coming home with me, Tony,” Steve tried not to think about the other way those words could be interpreted, because otherwise he’d probably end up doing something questionable like start whining, and no one wanted that. “I’m not waiting for a cab out on some empty street. House is only two minutes away anyway- come on.”
you it wasn’t because of that. I would
“Not me either,” Tony said, folding his arms and looking around the kitchen.
“I’m not fucking you for the first time in my
Tony looked at him, unimpressed. “That’s not fair. Don’t pull that face.”
start some sort of war.”
Natasha looked at him in amusement for a moment. “You really don’t know what that was, do you?”
So he smiled and then shrugged, wrapping his arm around Steve’s neck as he shuffled onto the other man’s lap. “Can’t say no when you ask that nice,” he responded- and when Steve laughed, his face broke out into the most beautiful smile that it made it all worth it.
He called again, sprinting forward, toward the wreckage of what had once been HYDRA’s aircraft.
Tony shrugged, his cheeks just going the slightest shade of pink. “I… uh, I thought you might all be asleep? I didn’t want to wake your whole family by ringing the doorbell at midnight.”
“That was a little undeserved,” Steve said with a pout, “I didn’t even do anything.”
day and Thor ate all the pasta in the cupboards.”
Unfortunately, as the month of October began, he quickly realised that his boyfriend, one Steve Rogers, did not exactly share that sentiment.
Then the door swung shut, and Tony was gone.
Two minutes after he’d seen Peter and his classmates pass by, he watched a few other familiar faces as they wandered down the corridor. Not the good kind of familiar, either. The ‘why the fuck are you taking up my line of sight you fuck’ sort of familiar.
Steve was quietly grateful of Tony’s leather jacket. Riding around New York in a T-shirt would not have been fun.
It had to be
Tony turned around, walking backwards and grinning at Steve. “Where’s the fun in riding safely?” He pouted, but when Steve shot him an unimpressed glare, he just sighed dramatically. “Ugh, fine. Two helmets it is, then. Wait-“ he turned once more, looking Steve up and down, “do you have a jacket?”
But there would be no other reason for Tony to say those things. To have that look in his eyes; a mixture of desperate, terrified and determined all at the same time. He was biting his lip again, making a red mark where his teeth buried themselves, but he didn’t look away from Steve.
So he buried himself up to the waist in Iron Man guts. It was about time he did a rehaul. The wiring sucked. Wiring could always be improved. It was simple. If there was a fault, it could be fixed. If something was slow, it could be sped up. He lost himself to the logic of it, finding comfort with the numbers in the same way he had his whole life. This was what he understood, and it wasn’t going to change, and it wasn’t going to leave. It was just numbers.
“Call Steve,” he muttered, sliding the coffee over to Thor and then backing away, “he’ll probably be getting up for his run about now-ish anyway. He might help calm Peter down.”
One shake of the head. Tony shrugged. “Don’t worry- just hold on and enjoy the ride, sweetheart. I won’t crash, scout's honor.”
Jesus Christ, they’d accidentally started a family. And when this was all over, how were they… how were they going to cope when Peter was taken away?
“He woke up about 48 hours ago. It’s been three days,” she told him, reading his face. Her gaze was sympathetic. “We kept you sedated while we figured out… stuff. Steve- do you know what’s been happening these last few months?”
“Hello, soldier,” Tony responded, his voice croaky from sleep. Steve glanced up at him with a grin, watching Tony rub his eyes and then blink blearily back down at him. “You having fun down there?”
Steve had let him fall.
“Avengers,” Steve said, back straightening, his smile gone and replaced with hard leadership, “looks like the next training routine’s gonna have to wait, we got the real thing up ahead. Thor, take Clint and Nat.” The God nodded and sidled up to the two spies as they all ran for the lockers where their real weapons were stored. “I’ll arrive front and centre with Iron Man, you take the back and meet them in the middle. Someone call Bruce—” He paused, suddenly wary as he looked at Tony for a second. “Who’s gonna look after Peter?”
There were muffled sounds on the other end of the line, and then whispering voices. Steve just made a face and then rolled his eyes, until another voice came up on the line a few moments later. Steve recognised this one.
He scrolled down, coming to a picture of the Iron Man suit, and then winced in pain as the image sent something throbbing at the back of his head.
Later that night, Steve woke.
Bucky’s hands flexed by his side, and he clenched his jaw. “Loud and fucking clear, pal.”
He takes a breath, and wills himself to say the words. Steve wouldn’t even be conscious to hear them, it would be fine, he could do it.
“I’ve never been the best at risk assessment,” he’d said with a shrug, licking off a stray fleck of cream from Steve’s lip, “but I appreciate the apology muffins anyway. Taste better on your mouth than they do in mine.”
It was proof that this was real. This was where he was. A broken mess of a man sobbing on the floor as the love of his life held him through it all. This was real. It was embarrassing and humiliating, but it wasn’t…
“Tony—”
Steve laughed, nodding along with her despite the fact that it wasn’t quite the truth. He wasn’t exactly sure how to word what he wanted to say- but she remained silent and waited patiently for him, and for that he was grateful.
Tony was shaking violently, and Steve, feeling like the most useless person on Earth at that moment, just made some stupid noise in the back of his throat and then pulled Tony into his arms, wrapping around the boy like he could just push all the broken pieces together if he pressed in hard enough. “Hey,” he said softly, fingers finding Tony’s hair and then beginning to curl through the soft strands gently, like his own mom had used to do to him whenever he’d cried, “hey, it’s okay. I’m here. I understand. Tell me a little bit about her, huh?” He asked gently, feeling Tony’s fingers flex against his sides, “tell me what she was like.”
“If I had,” he muttered, picking his screwdriver back up, “if I’d gone to you, and there hadn’t been any aliens or hypnosis or—or whatever… would you have believed me?”
And then he cut the call, throwing the phone on the bed roughly. Steve watched it, completely confused, before batting Tony’s hand away when it tried to go back to its place over Steve’s forehead. “What the hell was that about?” He asked sharply, “they’re my friends- they’re going to be worried about me, Tony, there was no need to be so rude about it.”
Tony just rolled his eyes. “Guess it’ll do. Usually this would be the time when I make you apologise to Pepper for dragging me out of all her meetings, but seeing as she can induce cardiac arrest upon healthy people, I would rather not expose you to her.” He pulled his phone from his back pocket and then wearily shucked his contacts up onto the screen, finding Pepper almost immediately and lifting it apprehensively to his ear.
And if Tony was right—if what he said about HYDRA, Rumlow, everything—was true, then it meant that Steve had handed him right into the mouths of the hungry lions, and then walked away. Whatever happened now, he knew Tony would never forgive him. He didn’t deserve it. Not after everything he’d done. All the lies-that-weren’t-lies he’d told to get where he needed to be.
He hears himself mumble as he fades to sleep.
Till this day, Tony still makes fun of the circumstances of his proposal. Steve doesn’t deny it was a rushed decision, but one he knows he will never regret.
“No, I am coming home to get dinner with you.” He would have stayed if Tony were here. Now he is the one getting mad about the board meeting. “Make a dinner reservation at that Italian restaurant you like. I’ll get on your private jet as soon as I am done over here.”
Whether Tony chooses to forgive him or not, doesn’t matter anymore. The fear of being rejected by Tony shouldn’t stop him from delivering his apology, because whether Tony forgives him or not, Steve Rogers is already the luckiest bastard in the world to be able to have this moment in his life.
“Thanks, Happy.” Tony grins. After being friends with Happy for so long, he can’t imagine not having him by his side.
Steve nuzzles against Tony’s neck, content and grateful for Tony's words. He always has a way of making him feel this way. “It felt good……seeing you show off that painting I made for you.” He confesses. Tony’s gaze darts to the painting on the wall, his expression full of tenderness.
“It’s okay, Mr. Stark.” Peter says genuinely, “I don’t mind listening. Take all the time you need.”
“Steve.” She attempted to reason with him. “We had no idea if he was alive. When we found out that this was a possibility, we immediately pursued it. All of us wanted to get him back.” She patted his shoulder. “You worked harder than anyone to make sure we would find him.”
“It wasn’t your fault, kid.” Tony tells him. He won’t put this blame on Peter, ever. The kid already has enough to deal with. He doesn’t need this kind of guilt on his conscious. “He did it to save everyone, not just you. You had no control over any of this.”
……infinity stones?
“It fits great. And yes, I do enjoy the color.”
Tony takes a deep breath, feeling lightheaded and tired. He leans back against the headboard, his gaze settling on the hand over his chest. Steve follows his eyes and pulls away like he just touched a hot stove. “Sorry—Sorry. I shouldn’t have touched you without asking.”
“Wouldn’t have been able to do it without you. Thank you for coming to my rescue.” Tony’s little segment puts everyone in a good mood and the overall atmosphere was a lot more relaxed. It also calmed Steve’s nerves down a lot. He was able to answer all the questions confidently and nailed his first public conference. “Did your meeting go alright? You cut down on your little study session to come help me.”
There isn’t a day that goes by without him thinking about what he should have done differently. How he shouldn’t have left things like that with Tony. How he should have tried harder to communicate with him.
His relationship with his suit is complex to say the least, they are one and it has stood by him during some of the most difficult times in his life. Depending on what happens tomorrow, maybe this is the final time he will wear the suit. Maybe this will be the last thing he feels before he dies.
—He is going to die.
The audience gasps at the sight of the painting, which only makes Steve’s face turn even redder. “Now, I would say that is impressive. Cap made me that, he did, so I would say we have never been better before. And no, this is not for sell.” The billionaire walks towards the camera with a proud grin. “I am afraid this is all we have time for today, duty calls. Captain, it’s all yours.”
Tony wants to scream, lips trembling.
By the time paparazzi makes it to the tower, it’s been long since they departed on Tony’s private jet to private island number 1.
This can’t be the first time Steve has heard of Tony’s injuries, but his body still freezes, expression fixed on horrified.
Steve loves it. He wants to see Tony looking like this for the rest of his life. Carrying his partner to the bed in his strong arms with minimal effort, the blond finds Tony’s plump lips and begins kissing him passionately. Tony lets out a soft moan as Steve drops him gently onto their mattress. “Baby—”
Rhodey.
“But I can’t just sit here—” He protests. When he is met with nothing but disapproving frowns, he sighs and curls his fingers into a fist. “I……I lost the kid.” He stares into the floor, voice trembling slightly before it returns back to steady. “I need to do something. I have to.”
“Just letting you know, I won’t be good company tonight.” Tony shrugs. “If you want to abandon your nice king sized bed for this, by all means go for it.”
They won, but it doesn’t feel like a victory to Tony.
“It was all working so well, but after Thanos broke loose, I knew it was over. We couldn’t keep up. He stabbed me with my own blade, I thought that was going to be the end of me.”
“I don’t know. We got distracted. Anyway, the point is—” Steve was so glad his muscles didn’t give up on him while he got on one knee right in front of Tony. It would had been so embarrassing if he fell face first on the dirt. “I’ll get you a ring, I promise. I don’t want to wait anymore. Tony Stark, I love you, will you marry me?” He knew this was unplanned, and ridiculous, but his brain was chanting
“Tony! Tony! Are you okay?” He crawled towards Tony, his heart rate racing out of control. This was like an reenactment of the Battle of New York, only this time their relationship had grown so much stronger, so much more intimate, and Steve really couldn’t handle it if he were to lose Tony. “Tony? Please!” He grabbed Iron Man’s face plate, revealing Tony looking at him blearily, eyes slightly unfocused.
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony has another nightmare. He cries out and reaches into the air again. Only this time, he isn’t grasping nothing. Steve holds his hand and cradles him against his chest. “I am here, Tony, you are okay, you are okay. You are not alone. I am here.”
They are the Avengers. These titles will always be integral to their identities. But if they can both make it back on Earth after tomorrow, he would like to spend more time in their relationship simply as Tony Stark and Steve Rogers. They will stand as equals, partners, not only as Iron Man and Captain America, but also as two men who loves each other.
“Glad I have the appeal. You are the one that is good at this kind of stuff, Tony. I don’t like dealing with the press.”
In an hour, Steve will be escorted to his first press conference following the events of the past few months. After successfully defeating Thanos and restoring the universe’s population, the original six Avengers are finally ready to move on to the next chapter of their lives. Banner wants to do more research on his own, perhaps aiming towards his eighth PhD. Thor is returning to his people and leading the future of the new Asgard. Clint is going home to his children and wife, and Natasha is taking a vacation for herself. She is most likely still going to hang around shield and will be taking a mission or two here or there, but even the Black Widow needs a break after fighting against someone with six infinity stones.
The tapping. The slowed reflexes. The short temper and the weary look and the seemingly constant presence of Steve down in the living room when everyone else slept soundly in their beds.
“When I said ‘you can’t make me’ it was not an invitation for you to try,” Tony grumbled as he nestled his head into Steve’s neck and frowned.
“Oh God,” Tony’s mouth dropped open in horror, head jerking up. “JARVIS! Where’s the defib?”
Tony paused, and then his face twisted up until he was looking at Steve as if he was insane. “What else would I do with you?” He asked, sounding genuinely confused.
That had been the first warning. From then on, it had seemed things just got progressively worse.
Steve’s soulmate was a genius, and no loss of limb could ever hold that man back.
He stood there, side by side with Bucky and Natasha, and thought of everything he wished he’d just fucking said. They’d gotten years together, but it still hadn’t felt like nearly enough time. He wanted to see Tony just once more. He wanted to say how sorry he was. How he knew it wouldn’t be enough, but he wanted to try anyway. He wanted to say that he loved him—always had, always would. That Tony had given him a reason to want to live in this new world, and without him, Steve wasn’t sure what the hell he would have done.
Steve processed the information. All of it. He acknowledged the obstacles, he noted the machine that Reed had now identified to him as the one he would need to use, and he assessed the risk. “So if I were to die there,” he said slowly, watching Reed’s face fall, his mouth open as if to begin his rebuttal, but Steve just spoke over him. “If I were to die there, like the Tescillians were intending on doing after getting rid of us… things would be okay?”
just for a second. She said he’d grow out of it in a while.
“Yeah,” Tony said, subdued, “yeah, that’s it. I’ll… I actually need to- there’s a thing I just remembered I have to do, and I should-“
He shuddered violently, feeling the clammy coldness of his own skin. It was over now. Done. Finished. Peter was here, and he was safe, and that was what mattered.
Later that night, long after Peter had drifted off to sleep and the rest of the team had parted ways to their own quarters, Steve and Tony lay together in bed, curled into one another and talking idly as they waited for the lethargy to take hold. This was secretly the favourite part of Tony’s day. That bit, right at the end, when it was just them. When they whispered overly truthful things to one another in the almost-asleep haze of night, fingers running feather-soft over the familiar divots and muscles. When Steve’s voice started to croak with over-use, and all that Tony could see of him was the fuzzy silhouette, the occasional glisten as the last few particles of light hit those blue eyes of his. It was like nothing else in the world, in the universe, even existed in those moments. This was just him and Steve, his whole existence narrowed down to the face two inches away from his.
he had to save him, this
“It’s Dad’s!”
He couldn’t quite hold in his laughter as Bucky shut the door moodily and turned to him, finger raised. He looked at the jacket for a second, grinding his teeth, but then just sighed. “I probably deserved that one,” he muttered in the end, before pushing Steve’s forehead away with two fingers and marching off, “but he’s still an asshole.”
“They were right where I left them last night, and yet when I come down this morning, when only
“You okay man?” Sam asked over breakfast a few hours later, looking up at him in concern as he moved his cereal around the bowl and made no effort to actually put any in his mouth, “you seem kinda… spaced out.”
“I have to go help,” Steve said, suddenly remembering the situation at hand. First and foremost, he was a SHIELD agent assigned with a duty to protect the people. And apparently, the people were in danger. “What is the fastest mode of transport from here to Santa Barbara?”
“For the last time, Rogers, I did
. Every action had been made of his own volition. Tony had been worried about him and Steve had punched him, and he’d thought it was what Tony deserved. Tony had been acting the way he always acted on that talk-show; chatty and flirty and confident, and Steve had hit him and called him a whore and vehemently believed it was the right thing to do.
Miss Hill stared down at him, holding out a hand. "You know phones aren't allowed in class. Hand it over."
(See the end of the chapter for
, he supposed- he was saved the embarrassment of an incorrect assumption by the resigned sigh that Michael released, and then a shrug of indifference a second later. “I really hoped we could just do this the easy way,” he admitted, “but if this is how you would like to do things… John- get the kid. I’ll deal with these guys.”
since this trip-
“Shut up, idiot,” Steve poked him with his foot, “still mad, remember.”
It was still raining, even when they arrived at his mom’s grave nearly an hour later. Wintry darkness was already starting to fall, and Steve didn’t have long before they’d have to go back home, if only to stop from freezing. He hoped that Thor wasn’t going to be bored by this. He could imagine it would be fairly dull, for someone who had never known who Sarah Rogers even was.
Tony?”
The gunshot rang out in his ears. A single, blinding strike. Elliot Redford had a good aim. It was one bullet, one man, and he had single-handedly murdered Iron Man and destroyed Captain America. All in three seconds.
me. How did you manage to take a good thing he did and make it looked awful? Why did you have to hurt him because of your own stupid fucking hangups about not being able to look after me? “
“I’m sorry- for earlier, I mean,” he said, swallowing a little and waving a hand, “I know it was… I’m sorry. Let me make it up to you-“
Thor just looked at him for a moment, before grinning bashfully and then taking the joint out of his mouth. “Uh,” he began, “I took a very long toilet break. About fifteen minutes ago. That ended up taking me over to my car. And you know, I was already there, so I thought I might as well just stay until the end of class, y’know?”
Steve watched him for a few seconds, gauging how ready his mouth was to talk. His head ached. Every bone in his body seemed to hurt, in fact. Like he’d been put through a meat grinder.
“That is enough Tony Stark,” Pepper warned one more time as she let go of Tony’s head. “I’m done trying to deal with your self pity. You can either accept that you make mistakes, forgive yourself, and move on, or I will just go back to New York.” Tony’s eyes widened and he bit his lip as he looked down at his lap.
It honestly looked like a standard hotel room. Two double beds with a nightstand and lamp in the middle and a black couch on the side. One teenage girl slept on one of the beds with a baby girl next to her. The other bed was taken up by a toddler boy who was lazily sprawled out over the bed, making it hard for someone else to easily sleep on it. And then on the couch another teenage girl slept, slumped over the left side of the couch while a little boy slept on the other end, his head resting in her lap.
“Don’t worry. This old body can’t do much anymore,” Steve replied
In the end, Steve didn’t even stay the night at Peggy’s. He gave her a hug, a quick kiss, and was gone. From there he returned the soul stone, and then the power stone. As he walked past the still unconscious form of Peter Quill, a thought crossed his mind. He should just stay in space, check it out. It had obviously not worked out the way he thought it would with Peggy, and there was no reason to go home, not yet. And with the time traveling thing, he could take all the time he needed. So Steve decided to be selfish another time. He snuck onto Peter Quill’s ship. He hid from the man and a pink skinned woman in a back closet, and when they landed on another planet, Steve got off.
“It’s not okay, we have guests coming over. We can’t not give them food. You know how Bucky is. I know where to get a ham though. So don’t worry.” Peter huffed as he closed the door to his room and rummaged through his coat pocket before he found the card. After that he stumbled over to his desk and poured himself a shot of NyQuil before downing the red liquid.
It had been one year since Tony and Steve had tied the knot, and everything had been perfect. Of course the two had gotten their fair share of people that had told them it would not work out. Two people with such strong personalities, coexisting together? The idea was far fetched to some, but Tony and Steve knew it would work out. The fact that they had made it to a full year was a testament to that belief.
“Hey hey hey hey,” there were suddenly hands on his shoulders, pushing him back, and Steve was about to lash out before realising it was only Sam. “Let’s just calm it. Call it a night, huh? We can get the bus home- Rhodey gave you some money, didn’t he? I think we all just need to cool off. You can speak to Bucky in the morning.”
What was he even thinking? Why did that infuriating, stupid boy manage to turn his brain to mush so effectively?
She smiled softly, crossing her legs and then observing him for a second. “You know, I'm really pleased for you, Steve,” She declared, her eyes twinkling, “you’re usually very good at depriving yourself of things that make you happy because you think you don’t deserve them. But there’s always going to be a point when you start to let that go- when you begin to let happiness in, in whatever form it comes from, and that’s when you know change is around the corner. It won’t be an easy path, we both know that. But this is the first step. And I’m glad we’re reaching that point now. Because it starts slowly- that’s why we work on trying to get you back into your old routines, your passions, your hobbies. You have to work your way back up. Seeing that you’re socialising a bit more, you’re practising a hobby you enjoy doing- it means you’re taking action. Even if they’re just little things, and even if you have to stop for whatever reason, or you end up falling back a few paces- this is just proof that you’re capable of getting at least one foot on the ladder. Remember that, Steve. ”
, and knew what he was thinking. “I love you and the thought of you… hurting yourself is enough to drive me insane. I didn’t know how to show you until now. But this,” he tapped the book that Tony was still staring at, “is sacred to me. This helps me know how you tick, it helps me work out when you’re having bad days and need someone to be there for you. It lets me know who it is you need; me or Rhodey or Bruce or whatever. Because I love you so much
Just like that.
“And I mean, I work,” Sam said with a shrug, “but I don’t really need the money right now, so he could just—”
Steve just looked at him, jaw tightening as he ran a hand through his hair and sighed. He turned his gaze down at Peter, cocking his head analytically. When Peter looked straight back at him, Steve’s gaze softened a little. His hand twitched, like he wanted to reach out again. But he didn’t. “Something feels off here,” he admitted quietly, eyes going back to Tony, “don’t you feel it too? These sorts of kids are rare. And X-genes usually don’t show until puberty. I’ve never heard of one this young- not unless it’s scientifically induced.
Wrong thing to say. Tony knew as soon as he’d said it, because Steve laughed harshly and then marched forward. “Can’t make you?” He asked, voice laced with fury,
Tony totally ignored him, instead choosing to lean up and capture Steve’s mouth in an altogether messier, hotter kiss than before. He slid his thigh between Steve’s and then rolled them both until he was on top, pushing his hips against Steve’s slowly and with purpose. Steve swallowed down the little noise that threatened to spill over his mouth at the sudden blunt contact. “That helped at all?” Tony asked as he broke away, voice slightly more out-of-breath than before.
The man paled. “I…I was just doing my—”
Steve shut his eyes for a second and curled a hand tighter around his bag. He’d been mugged three times before- they were never particularly pleasant experiences. Left him with more than a few battle scars to prove it. But he’d survived- although that had been when he’d known the area, and how to get back somewhere safe. This was foreign ground to him, now. Just to add an extra level of danger, you know? Because this wasn’t fucking unfortunate enough, obviously.
Suddenly and without warning, reality clicked into place with a startling clarity. This whole thing was a far bigger problem than what he’d previously realised. He couldn’t believe that he hadn’t clocked onto it sooner.
Steve was silent for a moment, wincing as Tony cleaned up the blood over his cheek. “Heard of APA?” He asked, and when Tony didn’t answer and instead just cocked his head, Steve continued. “They’re a pacifist organisation, known for attempting to break & enter or vandalise Army bases.”
Steve looked between Peter and Tony for a few seconds, before awkwardly shuffling around and then dipping his hand into the warm water. Peter watched him somewhat curiously- to the little boy, Steve was still probably a relative stranger. But he didn’t get scared or start to cry, merely remained quiet and watchful as Steve carefully let the water trickle from his palms and onto Peter’s head. “Just give it a little rub,” Tony informed him, “clean out any dirt that’s sticking around.”
Not any more. Fuck, fuck, not any more.
It had been the only thing on his mind ever since he’d heard about it. The audio of what had happened to Tony that night- how the events had transpired, how it’d all fallen apart. JARVIS was brilliant, and the recording would be invaluable in court, but for now Steve needed it for a different purpose.
His mind raced in terror, the immediate answer of affirmation almost spilling straight out of his mouth. He wanted it to stop. Those dreams… those dreams felt so real, he could feel the coolness of the metal as it was crushed between his fist, Tony’s heart in his hand. The thought of living through something like that again made him want to vomit. Or just die.
Steve broke away, brushing their noses together. “I can guarantee that everything you’re thinking is wrong,” he said with a small smile, “because you are remarkably good at coming to the worst conclusions, and I'm excellent at giving the wrong impressions.”
Tony shrugged. “Wasn’t a big deal.”
Peter stilled in his arms, looking up at Tony with his huge blue eyes, interested by this unusual change in behavior. Tony made sure to smile reassuringly at him before leaning down and pressing a little kiss against Peter’s temple. He could feel his hands shaking, but he made sure not to squeeze too tight. He wouldn’t hurt him.
- “for being you!” He called out behind him with a cackle, “it probably helped, I dunno! I’ve gotta go take my baby for a spin, I’ll see you in a few hours!”
“Yeah,” Steve smiled and pulled out a bag of rice from the top shelf, “it was wonderful, thank you. Were things alright over here while we were gone?”
Ty just observed him for another second, before turning away again with an indifferent shrug. “Haven’t heard of you before,” he said, eyes going back to Tony, “but Tony has, apparently. That’s nice. Branching out a bit, are we Tones? Getting bored of the rest of us?”
Steve nodded. He’d dealt with a lot of dislocated shoulders in his time. That shouldn’t be too hard. “Do you have any butterfly stitches?” He asked Thor, turning back to Tony. “I’d say he needs proper ones, but if he won’t go to hospital…”
He was nearly there, he could feel the energy leaving Loki as Steve choked it out of him, and the whole goddamn day had been a nightmare filled with aliens and Demi-Gods thinking they were fit to rule the Earth, so honestly, Steve was taking quite a lot of pleasure out of this.
Steve too, probably. He was just good enough not to say anything. Yeah, maybe they flirted. A lot. Maybe even enough to make Tony hope, to push a little- even when he knew that ultimately, Steve wouldn’t want anything to do with him.
“I have to work,” Tony said, even as his hands slid around Steve’s neck and pulled him in closer, “seriously, important and life-changing things are happening down in my lab.”
He took the bus back and spent the rest of the night with Sam and Clint, watching movies and trying to cram in all the homework they had due. He was despairing over the math, dubious about the history and downright angered by the ridiculousness of the science, but… still happy, overall. It felt kinda weird- usually when things went wrong, that was just the beginning of his next spiral, and yet now he was looking at
His bed wasn’t big enough for that. And he didn’t get morning sunlight- his windows faced the wrong way. Plus, y’know, he was currently sprawled out like an octopus on sheets that felt way too soft to be his own, and he hadn’t fallen out of it yet, which meant he was on a double or larger.
He had Steve, and he loved Steve, and he was never going to stop that, and everything else could be worked out.
Steve hadn’t touched him. Not once, since he’d come back. Tony had held out his hand, asked Steve to come lie on the bed with him when he was going to sleep like they always did, but Steve hadn’t once said yes. He’d made a flimsy excuse, given Tony a weak smile and just remained exactly where he was, hands shoved into his pockets or stuffed under his legs. He was pale and washed out, disturbingly fragile. When they’d first found out what was actually going on,  Tony had realised that it was the stupid transmission that had been making Steve look so unwell. It messed with his brain chemistry, and that was bound to affect him in a detrimental way. Another thing that Tony had been remiss about. Steve had been slowly goddamn wasting away, and all Tony had been thinking about was himself.
He made to move, but suddenly Bucky’s hands were there again, sharper, firmer this time, holding him on the bed. “Gently, Steve,” he warned quietly.
“You are the most awesome, kind… hot… kind guy I know,” the man continued solemnly, taking Tony’s hands and squeezing, “you make me pancakes for breakfast sometimes and I love you. And you’re really hot, did I- did I mention that? Like, Jesus fuckin’ Mary and Joseph, that
Something was coming.
dating!” Darcy shrieked excitedly, but Steve just shook his head and batted her flailing hands away in irritation.
“Please,” Steve said, balling his hands into fists as he felt them begin to shake, “please, I have to… I’ll hear it one way or another, if and when this goes to court. I’d rather get it out now.”
Steve saw Tony in the hospital with Sam when he woke up after all of it, gently bobbing his head to Marvin Gaye as it played tinnily through Sam’s phone, and he knew he had to tell him. But then Tony kissed him, frantic and gentle, his fingers combing through Steve’s hair and his eyes observing every cut and bruise as he asked Steve how he was doing, whether he needed anything, and it was clear he was immensely distressed. Steve didn’t want to add to that. It wasn’t the right time, Sam was there… he couldn’t.
Tony had the good sense to duck away from the first right hook sent flying his way, but he missed the knee that rose up to meet him, and it clipped his ribs painfully. He tossed himself to the side and gasped. “50,000, J!” He yelled.
“Oh God no, I’m joking Tony, it’s fine, seriously,” Steve laughed again, “you’re here now, that’s all that matters. Don’t give a shit what you look like. Did you say your bike broke down, though? Is that why you were late?”
It was sort of funny, really. From an objective viewpoint, he knew it was stupid. The truth that was hurting him now wouldn’t change in a week, it hadn’t been different a few days ago- but today it was all-encompassing. Today it was impossible to ignore. He was weak, pathetic, cowardly for giving into it. For blanking his friends and not even letting them know why. For letting it affect his schoolwork, his attendance. He knew all that, and the worst thing was, he just didn’t care.
"I just said, he's Z-"
“Few of the stragglers, yeah- but they weren’t a problem. They were dealt with accordingly.”
It was a mess. Everything was just… a mess.
“Don’t worry, that greeting is exclusive to Natasha,” the boy grinned, “she likes to lay down the law from the get-go. Me? I’m more happy to let you push until we descend into a brawl in the middle of th[e school cafeteria-”
“You know, we aren’t actually in a Hollywood movie,” Tony muttered as he lifted himself into the empty bin, “this sort of stuff doesn’t work in real life.” He shuffled down lower and then pulled a face as Steve shut the lid over his head, his muffled voice drifting through the covering. “It smells like shit in here.”
Steve laughed at Tony’s offense, but watched a few slightly curious looks get exchanged around the rest of the group. “Wait, you and Tony know eachother?” Clint asked through a mouthful of crisps.
“but you didn’t,” Tony said, hands cupping the back of Steve’s head, holding him, grounding him, “I’m fine. Thor had my back. It’s all good, baby, I’m okay.”
“Trouble just tends to search me out,” Steve finished with a sigh, watching Tony Stark wander around the corner and out of sight.
“I can’t.”
The thought of going up to their room made his hands shake worse, however, so after another few seconds to steel himself, he wrapped his hand around the leg of the desk and hauled himself into standing, biting back a groan. Steve really did pack a punch- and that wasn’t even one-tenth of his entire force, really. Tony had calculated it. Tony calculated everything about Steve, these days. Where he stood in the room. How many strides it would take for him to reach Tony. Power and distance per second, impact radius. Stuff like that.
Steve shook his head, watching as Tony acknowledged it and then turned to a nearby cupboard, leaning up in order to pull what looked like a first-aid kit from within. “Good. You still look like shit though. We’ll need to clean you up.”
Steve is asleep, and Tony is still drunk, and there is really no point in him continuing.
“Tony, what in the fuck-” Steve started, beginning to pull him up gently, but Tony wasn’t giving up this time- not now he knew, not now he’d connected every dot and cross and line and saw with his own stupid eyes what Steve had been trying to tell him for
Steve was silent for a moment, shutting his eyes and leaning his forehead against the metal of the gate, hands curling around the bars. “Someone’s trying to kill me,” he whispered.
"It's evening."
“It doesn’t seem so,” JARVIS told him, “vitals suggest consciousness, but he’s staying still. Perhaps he is detained.”
Tony paused his work, turning to look at Steve with a dead expression on his face. “Never say those words to me again.”
Tony smiled. “I always knew you’d come and get me.” He kissed Steve quickly. “And I love you too. Obviously.”
“Oh, darling, you don’t even know the half of it,” Tony grinned and turned a little, and Steve kissed him softly for a moment before his attention was caught by an explosion on screen and he turned his head back.
He looked up at Tony and debated the question. “Like I just lost a fight,” he admitted in the end, a frown forming, “been a while since that happened.”
In all honesty, Tony was pretty certain he was. Granted, it’d probably taken him longer than average to reach that conclusion what with all the neuroses he carried with him, but even
Steve huffed, forehead falling back into Tony’s chest. “Obviously,” he muttered, “the bedhead look is in right now.”
think about Steve near-constantly.
Tony froze, eyes widening. Steve felt like every muscle in his body coiled up at once and his mouth dropped in horror.
His heart twisted and it hurt in his chest. A billion thoughts shot through his head, each one of them carefully analysed. Something got stuck in his throat, and he swallowed it down as he looked away. “I don’t think he’d want me to,” he mumbled. Why the fuck would he? Steve had nearly killed him. He’d nearly… fuck, fuck, thinking about it made him want to throw up, to scream, to tear his own fucking hair out and lock himself away.
. There’s no bouncing back from a stopped heart.”
“Oh, fuck off,” Tony began, before pausing and then grabbing Bruce’s hand in order to add an extra inch to the distance, “
Five minutes and one floor later, Tony was glaring at him with more anger in his face than there had been when he’d found out Steve had sold him out. “I’d rather die,” he declared, “Steve, you cannot be serious.”
That boy was unequivocally
Tony just shook his head again. “You don’t know,” he said softly, “you have no idea.”
“You should know,” was all Tony said in the end, head shaking a little, “you deserve that much. Need to know what you’re getting yourself into, after all- it’s only fair.”
“This is so weird, isn’t it?” Tony blurted, sniggering to himself as they arrived at the garage and then began walking over to his matte-black audi, made inconspicuous for Steve’s sake. “We’ve become the helicopter parents of a child we don’t even know.”
Steve just looked up, mouth pursed into a painfully thin line. He wanted to hit something, but the thought just horrified him now. It wasn’t a release that would give him any pleasure at all. He felt like if he punched anything ever again, he would think of this. Of Tony, in his hospital bed, black and blue and branded by Steve’s hands.
But that was okay.
Stepping tentatively around the car as Bucky grinned through the window at him, he wrapped his hand around the handle and tugged. Then tugged harder when the metal refused to move. Finally, it let him in with a worrying groan, and he frowned deeply as he lowered himself in.
“You really are,” Natasha told him gently, her hand finding his and squeezing under the table, “and I really think you should stop being a little pissbaby and just go tell him you want to make out with him on the principal’s desk-“
Steve turned his head away from Tony and over to the area he was pointing to, and he felt his mouth falling open at the sight he was met with.
Of course, the whole ‘casual’ thing hadn’t actually lasted long. Surprisingly, it was Tony who stumbled through the conversation about wanting to be exclusive, cheeks red and lips chapped from where he’d bitten them in nervousness. “I know what we agreed on the first night,” he’d begun hurriedly, “but I’ve been thinking and I… well, I mean, you know I’m—I’m me, right, so I’m emotionally stunted on a good fucking day and I thought that I wasn’t ready for a serious relationship or anything, but then I… then I thought of you being.” He waved a hand briskly through the air, jaw tightening. “You know. Being with someone else. And it made me physically sick, Steve. I—I don’t want that. I don’t want you to be with anyone else. And I don’t want to be with anyone else. You’re… it’s just you, Steve.”
It was inevitable, really- six people, two of them meeting everyone for the first time- it was bound to cause studying problems. And also the fact that Clint brought a crate of beer to ‘help with their concentration’.
, and yet the world hadn’t fallen apart around him. It was still going on. Time was passing and people were existing, and reporters were describing every detail of how Tony Stark had been murdered on the streets of New York, and Steve was just
“Steve?”
“Want is a universal thing,” Steve said quietly, filling up the heavy silence with his beautiful voice, “but resistance isn’t. The fact you’ve done the latter is something I’m
Steve laughed tiredly and leaned back against his pillows. “Feels like I’ve been hit with a train. Twice.”
God, who was he kidding? He was always dangerous. Always. And people- fuck, people actually looked up to him for it. They admired him for it when they should be terrified.
Of course, he healed. Time, and therapy as demanded by Bucky, both helped a lot. He started being able to sleep without medication or alcohol, and say her name in casual conversation. Peggy Carter. Best friend. Died a hero. Her impact never left him though, and he woke up every day to the peeling paint of his Brooklyn apartment missing a warmth that he knew was no longer here on Earth. Missing that lipsticked mouth of crimson or purple. And it wasn’t just her he missed, either. He started to come back to the world, and as he did so, he truly realised the gravity of what he’d done. But he knew it was too late to go back on the damage caused by the way he’d acted. Tony had gone. And Steve had no choice but to live on. See the next day through. Go through the motions as best he could. SHIELD had snapped him up only a few months after he’d split with Tony, and they’d wiped him from the records after that, so Tony couldn’t have gotten in touch with him if he’d tried. He filled out mission reports as he watched the 6 o'clock TV and ate a microwave meal, let his apartment get steadily messier and messier, and tried not to think about everything it was that he’d thrown away in his shitty fucking life. Kasey, his therapist, liked to tell him that he has to live each day in the present, not the past. He had to move on. And it wasn’t particularly a life he enjoyed, it wasn’t a world he was happy to be in, but it was better than where he had been when Peggy had first died.
The reflection shuddered, just a little, and he frowned and attempted to steady it, thinking that Thor had just gotten overexcited again. But the shuddering got more extreme, and Steve realised the whole room was beginning to shake. His next thought was that it might be an Earthquake—but then something else popped into his head, and his eyes widened, heart suddenly going completely still in his chest as a billion different emotions roar up to meet him.
Tony nodded, turning back to their wardrobe. He still hadn’t picked out a belt. “Busy day,” he said lightly, “people to meet, products to launch, casual homophobia to deflect, you know that drill. Do we have Avengers Training today?” He turned back to look at Steve, now sat up on the bed fully, his feet planted on the wooden floorboards. He was looking at Tony with a small frown.
Day 21, and Steve finally decided to shave. It was boredom, mostly. Plus, the beard itched, and the shaggy hair had been okay when he was hiding and trying to cover his face as much as possible, but now it was just annoying. He’d not gotten around to it earlier because… well. Safe to say there had been some slightly more pressing matters on his mind.
He let his hands tap distractedly around the skin of the apple, hearing the
Steve snarled, lashing his head forward and actually managing to brain one of them. “Fuck off- Tony Stark is an asshole,” he told them- the same thing he told everyone, because it was true-
“Are you ever
When Tony smiled back at him, though, it made Steve feel nothing short of perfect. “Good,” he said, before leaning back and digging a hand back into his jacket pocket, “then I can get started on the cigarette I so woefully had to postpone earlier.”
did he hate himself for that.
“When was the last time you got more than three hours of sleep, Steve?” Tony asked slowly.
“You don’t know that.”
“Hey,” he said, leaning his head against the window of the bus and closing his eyes, “how was your lecture?”
“Did you know you talk like a historical period actor when you get drunk?” Steve blurted, whilst wondering who these ‘other two’ were exactly. Siblings? Did Tony have brothers and sisters- really, Steve should’ve found that out by now-
about it, and it wasn’t fair, and I’m just…” he shook his head softly and leaned onto his knees, eyes on the floor. “I’m just sorry, Tony. You never deserved that.”
you so much,” he mumbled, and Steve couldn’t see, but he’d bet their joint fortune that Tony was pouting at that moment.
Tony rolled his eyes. “He’ll come down when he’s good and ready. Just give him a distraction or something, I dunno.” Peter’s head turned to look at Tony, and Tony couldn’t resist pulling a face at the kid, watching with a grin as the boy cackled in a way that only babies ever did- loud and carefree and without a single weight upon his tiny little shoulders.
“Famous last words,” Steve muttered, and Tony winked at him again, careless and free as he spun into the corridor and skipped over the floorboards. He was in a remarkably good mood- had been pretty much all day, actually- it was nice. Steve loved seeing him happy. His whole demeanor changed; he seemed so much lighter.
Steve was right. Screw him, but he was right. He dropped clumsily onto the chair and then leaned forward onto his desk, looking straight ahead and trying not to hit something. This complicated things. The plan that he’d started developing in his head since last night had suddenly been shattered, and now he was having to re-evaluate everything.
“It wasn’t- he doesn’t-“ Steve spluttered, but Sam jumped in this time, pulling a face as he patted Steve on the back again.
“I’m-” Steve began again, before remembering Tony had told him to stop and letting the beginning of the word sit on his throat. He shuddered violently and buried his face deep into Tony’s neck, clutching tight to the other man’s body. “I- I couldn’t… nightmare, I- I- I don’t… I just can’t lose you Tony, I can’t, I can’t do it,
She was saying it because she might not get another chance to, and Steve… Steve wasn’t even sure how to process it. He didn’t even have time, anyway—a few seconds later, and the barrier was opening, beasts starting to swarm into Wakanda with feral screams and razorblade teeth. Steve took in a breath and shoved it all down, the same way he always fucking did—No time, no time, there was
Tony’s face fell a little and he looked away. Steve just frowned and kissed him again. “Yeah, I know,” he agreed with a small nod, “I do the same thing. Kinda.” There was a short pause before Tony’s face turned into one of intrigue, and Steve took that as the cue to continue. “Sometimes, when I’ve had a nightmare, the only thing that keeps me from falling apart is the sound of your heart. If I hold my breath and stay still, I can hear it. And it—it helps me go back to sleep again. Nothing calms me down faster than hearing the sound of you… just being alive, next to me,
‘normal’ people to accept me for one day of the year. I want to be accepted
. About anyone except your precious little pet project-“ Ty pointed a vicious finger at Steve, who rolled his eyes and then stepped forward, going in to shove him again. But Tony got there first, smacking his hand out of the air and then propelling him back violently so his back hit the lockers.
He was happy- God,
“Be good!” he yelled behind him with a wave of his hand.
Clint was the one who apologized, in the end. He wouldn’t hear Steve try and get in first- which was both satisfying and frustrating.
But time had passed, afternoon turning to evening and then night, and nothing had come. Now it was just Steve, alone on the snow-thick mountain, only able to see anything at all thanks to his enhanced senses. The blackness of night was almost stifling. It made everything so much more lonely, and Steve couldn’t help but think of the ice, of the plane and the arctic and the all-encompassing isolation that had followed. Of course, it did nothing to actually stop him in his tracks. He wasn’t leaving this God-forsaken mountain unless Tony was with him. He could take a bit of chill in the meantime.
, and then turned away again, beginning to make his way to the elevator, undoubtedly heading for the gym.
“I’ll only be gone a week,” Tony mumbled into his mouth like he’d read Steve’s mind, breaking off and looking up at Steve with a soft smile. “It’ll fly by, I promise.”
And assemble they did.
And that was when the cynical voice of Natasha kicked in in Tony’s brain, and the good mood soured just a fraction. He looked away, glancing down at his lap as the engine started, and although he wasn’t looking over at Steve, he knew the man had realised his blunder too. They were doing that more and more frequently, these days. Slipping up. Acting as if Peter was a permanent feature in their lives. Tony knew they had to get a grip on themselves— a tower full of Avengers was a totally unsuitable place for any child to stay, no matter how intense the baby-fever was hitting.
you think I was dating Bucky, anyway?”
It was nice to be away from it all for a while. No one noticed them in the village, or at least if they did, they didn’t bother them. The change of scenery was nice, and although Steve was a city boy through and through, it was certainly pleasant to experience the countryside and see a patch of grass that wasn’t hemmed in by concrete and brickwork. He didn’t even mind that he got sunburned almost every day from the hot weather and constant outdoor activity. Pale skin didn’t react all that great to sun, but he healed quickly enough. Tony, of course, only ended up tanning beautifully, skin going a deeper olive each passing day spent out having lunch on the grass or fixing up the tractor for the owners while they were gone.
But still. It was nice to pretend.
“No it’s not!” Steve hissed, and Tony’s mouth snapped shut again. Steve swallowed, stepped further back. “It’s not,” he whispered, his voice tiny, “it will never, ever be like any other fight. Because this was me, and you trusted me, and I-“
It wasn’t real. But Bucky’s safety was, and Steve needed to protect that.
He looked at Peter analytically. “Do you have secret lazer eyes or something?” He asked, to which Peter responded with a blank stare. “Breathe fire? Could you potentially destroy the world?”
And then he was pushing through the crowds, leaving Steve and his friends behind- the last thing they all saw before he was lost to the masses was his bouncy little ponytail. Steve watched him leave the way Tony and Tiberius had; crowds parting instinctively to let him through.
Tony hissed, “I’m
“Steve,” and then Tony was there, hands on his shoulders, gentle but serious all the same, “I mean it. Don’t… please, I’ll pay you if you want-“
“Tony, love, please, we have to make sure—”
“Well, lucky for you, the matter has already been dealt with,” Tony told them firmly, giving his own smile as he lifted his hands placatingly, “we did temporarily have a child in our custody, but the mother came back for him the next day. Seemed to have had a change of heart, I don’t know, and honestly, I don’t really care. Kids aren’t exactly any of our forte’s, if you haven’t noticed.”
“I’m just giving something back,” Tony told him lightly, shrugging, “catching up and stuff. Shouldn’t you be over on the quad- thought you enjoyed watching Loki and Sunset argue?”
Helen made a brief call, undoubtedly to one of the team, because all she said was, “He’s awake. Yeah. Yeah, okay.” And then hung up again. After ordering him not to mess with the healing process and ruin her excellent work, she walked out of the room and left him to his own devices, presumably to go and do something else revolutionary and way cooler than what he was going to be stuck doing over the next few days. He really hoped to pick her brain one day. He probably needed to work on making her like him first, but after that, they’d have some amazing conversations, he just knew it.
He put all the power he could into the thrusters and arced high into the sky
Tony kissed him.
“Hi,” Tony said, a little out of breath as he leaned against the frame of the door. He didn’t look too great himself, which made Steve feel a little better. There were black smudges across his white shirt, and his hair was even wilder than usual. “So, I’m gonna start with the fact that I’m really sorry.”
“We didn’t make you come,” Peggy pointed out, tossing a marshmallow into the air and catching it between her teeth.
“I’m bruised.”
He smiled and shook his head, leaning back on the chair and tapping his fingers against the armrest. “Nah. It’s actually been… it’s been good. Since I last saw you, anyway. I’ve… yeah.”
There was a short silence, and then a huff. “Whatever. Fine. But I want the money.” Shoes tapped along the wooden floors quickly, and Thor suddenly scrambled for the entrance, a small frown on his face.
Someone—maybe Bruce, maybe Clint—called his name, but Steve didn’t hear it. He was already running down the corridor, throwing his bag down on the floor carelessly somewhere to his left as he surged forward, shoving his way past people. They cursed at him as he passed, but he didn’t even notice it.
“You’ve been under the influence of a foreign mind control,” she explained, leaning forward and pursing her lips, “Bruce worked it out yesterday and told us as soon as he could. There was a… a device, used by the race of aliens who’d tried to launch an attack on Earth a few weeks ago, you remember? We’re not sure of the specifics yet, but you were the one who initially pulled it out of the ship’s hull after Tony told us it would break the psychic link between the armies. We think… we think that something must have happened to link you and the device before it was shut off.” She bit her lip and looked him in the eye sombrely. “How much do you remember, Steve?”
- were to wrong him.”
…what did he do.
Steve looked at him, then visibly composed himself. “Are there any more targets?” He said, voice clipped as he knelt down beside Tony and then settled a hand against the pulse on his neck. It was thready and week, and his skin gray, clammy. He was not in a good state.
grab my ass in front of the kid, Stark.”
Although, of course, they hadn’t gotten away scot-free. A frag bomb had gone off a little too near Tony and the debris had sliced right through his leg. In fact, if it wasn’t for the snow-storm that’d whipped up during the ambush, he was pretty sure he’d be dead. That was the only reason that Nat, Bruce and Rhodey had had enough cover to pick him up and carry him away to safety. None of them had known that there was a miraculous little cabin fairly nearby, and so stumbling on it had been nothing short of a one-in-a-million chance. Tony would make sure to be grateful for that later.
Tony froze.
Pops looked over to him curiously, and Pops and Dad seemed to share a silent conversation between them that Peter couldn’t catch, before Dad finally sighed fondly and stepped forward, dropping down next to both of them. He put an arm around Peter’s shoulders and pulled him in, giving him a quick kiss on the temple before releasing and then turning to his Pops.
Steve didn’t say anything, and Tony mentally fucking cursed himself. He always overshared- every fucking time. Peter was still preoccupied with slathering bubbles against the side of the tub, and Tony watched him intently, even as he felt Steve slowly move to his side and then sit on the floor next to him so that their shoulders brushed. “Tony?” He asked, his hand settling against Tony’s and squeezing gently, “look at me, sweetheart?”
“There’s not much we can do about it now,” he said gruffly, “this is probably just a badly hashed-out plan to get one of the gizmos down here. Storm the building, hire out a few professional Enhanced to lead the march, then let them do their own thing while everyone else gets the hell outta dodge.” He shrugged and raised a repulsor toward the door. “Let’s just go in, see what they’re about, and then take them down.”
. No fancy dates or constant need for conversation. No worrying over how to keep things interesting. Steve could let himself be boring around Tony- he could pick up a book and put his head in Tony’s lap and they wouldn’t speak for two hours, but they’d be
Steve cut him off with a kiss, looping his arms tight around Tony’s neck and standing up to his tiptoes to press his full body up against the other boy. He tried to make sure everything he felt was conveyed in the kiss, but he knew it wouldn’t be enough. Nothing would ever really be enough to try and get Tony to see,
He grinned, rolling his eyes and fiddling with the napkin in his fingers. As he watched Tony, he couldn’t help but notice all the ways the boy moved- fluid hands and shaking heads in order to flip stray hairs out of his shining eyes. He was yelling at Natasha, but there was a huge smile on his face, showing a perfect row of teeth and soft, full lips.
When Steve remained confusedly silent, Tony made a face and wiggled his fingers. “I just… need to do something. A
He loved Peter. This was going to ruin him when it was over. He couldn’t step back, because Peter needed him, and whether Tony was family or not, he still owed it to Peter to be there for him. God only knows no one else ever had been before he’d been dropped off at the tower. And maybe they were all volatile, maybe they were too loud and too childish and too emotionally stunted to be around a kid. But even with all that baggage, they were still the only people on the planet that that little boy felt safe around.
“Oh, no one said you were volunteering. This isn’t an option.”
He was suddenly surrounded by friends yelling and whooping, and he rolled his eyes fondly but was unable to stop the happy little grin that took over his face as he received various pats and hugs. Bucky lifted him up and spun him with a whoop, and Thor just ruffled his hair and then offered him a bottle of mead, which he took gratefully.
Steve shook his head, a watery smile forming on his face as he stared at Tony. Wonderful, beautiful, genius Tony. “Not at all,” he said, voice scratchy and rasping. He figured he probably looked a sight right then; puffy red eyes, tear stained & blotchy face, hair sticking up on all ends.
“Thanks, Thor,” he said afterward, when they were on the bus home again, “you… it was good of you. To do this for me.”
“You can just tell us, Steve,” she murmured gently, “if you tell us, we promise we won’t lay a finger on Tony. We just want you to comply. That’s all. We just need you to tell us where the Winter Solider is, and Tony won’t get hurt.
“You think?”
Tony ground his teeth at Rhodey’s purposeful obtuseness and resisted the urge to say something along the lines of
A hand came to settle in his hair as Steve moved forward, and Tony subtly switched the tablet off and placed it on his lap. “I was saying that you told me you’d never climbed a tree before, right?” Steve said. “Well, I think that today’s the day you should tick it off your bucketlist. There’s a lovely oak tree just at the perimeter of the field, and if you poke your head out of the top of canopy you can see the whole valley as the sun sets around it.”
Tony sighed in dismay. “You’re gonna catch a cold, Steve, dammit-“
thing you can find! While I supervise, obviously,” Tony added, when steve looked horrified.
Steve shrugged, not meeting his eyes. “Last night, with you.”
And Steve had
The intercom switched off, and Steve stared ahead at the mansion in front of him, all obstacles cleared from his way with a single conversation. Tony hadn’t even hesitated.
“Tell me what happened,” Bucky didn’t bother with trivialities, turning to look at him with a serious glare, “Steve, please-“
Natasha laughed. “Should’ve seen yourself five minutes ago. All curled up into Steve’s side, and Peter had his hand resting on yours like a scene from some wholesome family film. We have pictures.”
“Hey,” he began softly, turning to face those soft hazel eyes, wanting to capture it, save it, burn it on to his mind so it was the last thing he saw, “I just wanted to say I’m sor-”
Thor paused, apparently thrown off by Steve’s words. “But you’re sad.”
It was ridiculous! Especially when Tony could choose from anyone- he already apparently had an on-off thing with that Ty guy… Steve wasn’t…
He frowned. "Uh- Tony's out. At least, I'm pretty sure he is."
“Shhhh, it’s okay, we’ll go in together, it’s all fine,” she said soothingly, and then they turned a corner and disappeared from sight, the last thing they saw being Clint’s pleadingly extended arm, reaching out to them in a cry for help.
“Steve, tell him what happened,” Bucky whispered, handing him the phone again.
Sam looked at him, a little bit despairing, but then just nodded and gave Steve a pat on the back. “You’re on chores this evening, dick,” he called out behind him.
That wasn’t happening again. Not on Steve’s goddamn watch.
Thor sighed, and even his breath just seemed heavy. “I love him,” he said quietly, “he is my brother and I love him, and I know with every day that he’s fading further and further away and
Steve was silent. And then he jerked. “I’m not wearing your jacket, Tony.”
Steve looked at him a second more, before nodding once and then moving back to his place against Tony’s shoulder, both hands now curled around eachother. Tony didn’t speak again for a while, eyes moving noncommittedly along with the images that flashed up on the TV in front of them for a few extra moments until he cleared his throat again.
Like Tony agreeing was ever going to be a battle.
“And you thought that you could just randomly start pulling away from a
Tony just nodded once, and Steve watched curiously as he swallowed and began tapping his fingers against the wheel nervously. He didn’t say anything, though.
Tony was breathing heavily, and his entire body was being slammed against the sharp edges of what had been left of the ship. Every gust of wind made him cry out in pain. “Steve, I can’t- I can’t hold-”
for him. That was all.
It was enrapturing. His whole demeanour was just… enrapturing
By the time he’d spent a week in hospital, Tony was done.
Tony blinked at him groggily, before giving him a weak smile. “At least have a nap. You look like shit.” He paused, before adding, “but in, like, a sexy way. Obviously.”
He and Steve had met totally by chance.
“Jesus Christ, what is it about my hair that’s so-“
robot-stuff, it might be different-“
Tony froze on the spot, unwilling to step further. Unable to. He didn’t want to know. He couldn’t know. His heart already felt ruined, but now that he was looking at one of his closest friends as they lay unmoving on the floor, he didn't think it was even in his chest anymore. It was somewhere in his shoes, leaking out of the soles. Vile and coagulating.
“Steve Rogers,” Tony declared, kissing his forehead and looking at him with outright adoration, plain to see in his eyes, “please never ever change.”
Of course, he only got about five seconds into the hall before he heard angry shouting start up in the room he’d just left- not even the friendly kind of angry, the
“How are you gonna do it?” Steve asked quietly, although he knew. He just… he needed to be sure. “You can’t just walk into a Military base and demand your weapons back.”
It didn’t take much to know it was Tony. He’d memorised the walk, the breathing, the pressure Tony asserted against his shoulder from the first week of knowing him.
He pressed a little kiss against Steve’s cheek and turned back to the TV, letting him get on with it.
“Hmm,” he breathed, lips brushing Steve’s messily for another second before he stood straight again, removing his mouth from where Steve could reach, “I should keep you down here with me all the time if this is what happens.”
Tony laughed, and the sound felt so damn relieving in his ears that Steve couldn’t help but laugh too, rocking Tony sideways and kissing up his neck, savoring the sensation of the pulse beneath his lips. Tony moved his head until he could kiss Steve properly, and they stayed like that for a while, just allowing themselves the reprieve of one another. Steve refused to think of any more what-if’s. That way would lead only to madness.
“Tony!” A happy, familiar voice called out to him across the room as soon as he walked through the door, “Tony, you’re here! Guys, look! He’s here!”
The rational part of Tony’s brain was absolutely aware that there was nothing he needed to be safe from- apart from perhaps himself- but the irrational, scared corner of Tony’s brain just sighed with relief, and he felt himself reach a shuddering hand out blindly, finding Steve’s body close to him and sensing the warmth there. Captain America.
Steve took the phone apprehensively, looking through Bucky’s contacts until finding James Rhodes and hitting dial. It only took a few seconds for the response, the boy’s low voice filling Steve’s ear. “Hello?”
God, don’t think about that. Push it down. It was fine. “Yeah, whatever Bruce,” he muttered, pulling his hands off the table so that the other man wouldn’t see them start to shake. They did that so much these days, and he hated it. Hated every last part of himself, really. The way he jumped when doors opened and how sometimes when Steve came into the room looking unhappy, Tony sped through a quick checklist of things he’d done wrong and threw an apology straight up to his lips just in case.
“See, he doesn’t mind, Tony!”
“You can stay a little longer if you want,” Steve offered, and Tony softened again when he looked back to him. His gaze fluttered over to Bucky on the couch, and he huffed, turning away.
He lurched up from his desk, blinking rapidly and trying to pull back a little composure he hadn’t even been aware that he’d lost. There was more data that he needed to encrypt, a location that he needed to track and such. But he wasn’t really thinking about that just then- there was only one relevant thought chuntering around in his groggy, cotton-filled brain, and it was that he needed to find Peter. Now.
Steve glanced Tony’s way, and Tony just shook his head minutely. “And now what?” He asked sharply. “You just go home, get a letter of recommendation from AIM, eat Chinese?”
“And I suppose that’s why I’m here.” The resignation sat deep in his gut. This was just another thing sent to hurt him. Another betrayal, another terrible let-down. One thing was for sure though: this guy- the one that was responsible for domestic terrorism charges and violent assaults and the wiping-out of
“I’d just kiss you in other places,” Steve said simply, before opening the door and then pushing Tony inside, “go sit down. I’ll make you some food, okay?”
“She’s not wrong,” Sam said, looking at him fondly even when Steve just rolled his eyes at him. He tried to think of an appropriate way of responding to that, but found himself lacking.
Steve smiled reassuringly, opening up his good hand and then finding Tony’s own, squeezing tight. “Sorry,” he whispered, “but I wasn’t gonna let it hit you, Tony. Anyway-
And of course, sat in the middle of all it- his legs crossed and head bowed down to some strange looking device perched in the middle of the floor, was Tony.
It was fine.
“This isn’t healthy, buddy,” Natasha told him, voice quiet as she opened the door to the roof. Steve’s hands were curled around the railings, neck craned up to the sky. He knew it was stupid, that he probably looked a fool. But it was just… comforting. To know that somewhere out there, Tony was coming back. “It’s been four days, no sign. If he wasn’t killed in the fight on that ship, there’s a fifty-percent chance he was taken in the—”
“Go talk to him,” Steve said, but Thor shook his head.
He caught the tail-end of something that sounded suspiciously like ‘oh for fuck’s sake Steve-‘ but he’d slammed the window closed before he could catch the rest of it and then jumped back down onto the floor, turning back to the door where Sam was stood. “There we go- problem sorted,” he told the boy with an air of finality.
But Loki remained standing in his position, not leaving, nor sitting back down to stay. Steve didn’t have the energy to comment any further on the matter, so he just turned back to Tony, his finger running repetitively up and down his collarbone while he slept.
“Not like that,” Tony said softly, waving a hand in dismissal. His smile was light as he said “Steve Rogers, hate to break it to you, but you are simply far too genuine for a dump like this. These places are reserved for assholes only. Hence,” he waved at himself, and then around the now empty room.
“-Human,” Tony finished off for him. “And humans have a lot of problems to deal with. It
He is silent for a few moment. “Steve made me promise him. That I wouldn’t take my life.” Tony’s voice starts to crack, tears falling into his mouth as he gasps for air. “That bastard. So now I can’t even fucking do that. Because I promised.” And what was he supposed to do? That was the last thing Steve asked of him. He didn't have a choice.
“I am right here, cupcake.” Tony smiles affectionately at the man above him. Steve usually gets a little needy whenever he is away for any period of time. “Not going anywhere.”
“Trial……”
“It doesn’t bother me.” Steve approaches him, steady and unwavering, but gentle.
“I am sorry, I am sorry, it should have been me, should have been me……”
As they make their journey return, Steve paid no heed to the stars they passed by. The existence of Tony Stark glowed brighter than a billion stars in the galaxy combined.
“Trial 38, fail.”
It would be easier to say no, to dismiss Steve and lie more and tell him he is fine. But he doesn’t. Maybe the constant stress and general exhaustion have weakened his defenses, because he opens his mouth and can’t seem to stop himself from rambling.
“He almost died.” He said.
Tony can’t stop admiring it. He did it. Strongest element in the world. The shield is indestructible, impenetrable. Nothing will be able to break this shield. Nothing will be able to get through to Cap. It won’t be like last time, not even with six infinity stones……
“We won.” A brilliant smile appeared on Tony’s face, and both of them started laughing even though they were sore as hell from the battle. In the distance, Steve could see the other Avengers also getting up and walking towards them, all of them grinning wide.
Even the Earth’s strongest element can’t compare with six infinity stones at once.
“You are right. It is.”
Tony Stark never gets used to sleeping alone, but he finally learns to cope with it.
“Hey everyone, sorry for not being able to make it today.”
Tony couldn’t remember. Carol must have gotten him on the ship too. Tony could only remember looking at the floor of the ship.
“Yes. I mean the engagement.” Tony smiles up at him, fluttering his eyelashes. “Our retirement alone is going to bombard the news for days. Can you imagine what it is going to happen if we announce that we are getting married? Iron Man and Captain America?”
“Where……am I.” He slurs. God he feels awful, physically and mentally. He feels like he might be sick. His instinct is to get away from here as fast as possible but he is stopped by a strong arm pushing him back on the bed.
he had said. Even when he was plagued by insomnia and panic attacks after going through a wormhole, having Steve by his side made everything worth it. The Battle of New York was the first time Steve warmed up to him, and it was the start of something significant to Tony. So he embraced the pain that followed him around. The presence of Steve made him feel grounded. Tony was never shy about showing Steve just how much he was worth to him, and all Steve did was trample all over his dreams and leaving his heart empty. He saw the plea in Tony’s eyes at the airport back in Germany. Walking away from all this was one of the hardest thing he had ever done. Away from Tony, away from their joined future together. He loves him so much.
“It was my fault. I should have came up with a better plan.” He grimaces, eyes glazed over, trapped in his own nightmare again. “It should have been me, why couldn’t it have been me?”
“We could have lost him!” He ran his hand through his hair, suddenly angry. “Why did it take us so long? What were we doing? Why didn’t we look harder?”
Once he is given the green light, he throws himself back to work. It almost feels like the old times, except they are all a little more broken. And it hurts a lot more, because everyday he is reminded of how it all started out with the six of them, how their future seemed limitless at the time.
The moment he set eyes on Tony, eyes shut tightly closed with an oxygen mask over his face, Steve felt like crying again. He lost so much weight, dark circles under his eyes prominent. He had seen Tony going through rough spots before, but this was worse than anything that happened before. If it wasn’t for the rise and fall of his chest indicating he was still breathing, his appearance would almost seen like he was gone. Steve had seen enough dead bodies in his lifetime to know. Tony was strong, always strong, and he always got back up. This looked like something that could have been permanent. It scared Steve.
He was left in his room. He didn’t even leave once. Nat. Nat came to feed him food and water. Nat rubbing his back and telling him to sleep. Tony couldn’t talk. All Tony did was staring at the wall. They must have held a funeral for Steve. Tony couldn’t even attend. Tony was paralyzed by shock.
Pepper’s sobbing comes to a halt. “Tony?”
“Of course. I……I am here for you, Tony.” Steve says ever so reluctantly, probably sensing the irony with his own words. Tony remains silent, doesn’t want to purposefully give him a hard time.
“Romantic getaway it is.” Steve agrees.
It does get lonely, but at least he still has FRIDAY to chat with. Pepper, Rhodey, and Peter visits sometimes.
Earth’s best defender.
“No. You are totally not doing that.” Rhodey narrows his eyes and pushes him back on the bed with as little pressure as he can. “You need to rest. Tony. The doctor said so.”
If not even Vibranium is strong enough to protect Steve, then Tony has no choice. He will create an even stronger element. He fixed the problem of Palladium poisoning by himself last time, he can do it again.
Carol found him. She looked terribly pained but she was kind to Tony.
His teammates don’t know what to do with him, because all he does now is make sarcastic comments and rain on their parade. He knows he is being a selfish asshole, but he can’t help it. He wishes he is dead. It would make everyone less miserable that way. Natasha and Clint tries to talk to him, or get him to talk to someone, at least, but he won't let them. Thor comes by and Tony won't budge even when he threatens to chop down his house with his axe if he doesn't open the door. Bruce leaves him so many voicemails but he doesn't listen to any of them. He does't even look at his phone anymore.
The crowd is larger than Steve expected, and he can feel himself stiffening up again. He has never liked performatory acts in front of the public; it reminds him too much of the days when he was paraded around selling war bonds. That was his least favorite part of being Captain America.
Then he screwed everything up and left Tony hurt and injured in Siberia and didn’t contact him for years.
“Will you be taking on a more active role in Stark Industries now that you are no longer part of the Avengers?”
“I was going to wear a blue one to match your color theme. We will do that next time.” Tony hums, evidently in a good mood after seeing Steve in that suit. “Are you coming back to New York after this? You are free to enjoy the five star hotel they booked for you, you know. Pamper yourself for a few days. I heard that they have an amazing spa.”
“You don’t have to be prepared, Tony.” Steve is laughing some and then crying a little. “To be honest, I am scared about tomorrow. I can’t lose you, it would destroy me completely. I know it because I thought you were dead when we found you and the first thing I thought about was how I wished I had died by your side.” Steve wraps his large hand around Tony’s waist. He won’t allow that to happen. To him, Tony’s survival and happiness is pretty much tantamount to the avengers’ goal of restoring the universe.
“Tony.” Steve opens his arms and lets Tony jump into his embrace. His heart feel so warm and full as his brain registers Tony’s scent.
It’s been 67 hours since he last slept.
The moment his fingers touched Tony’s face, a wave of emotions slammed into him with the intensity of the burning sun. It was hot and painful and somewhat a shock to his system. Two years. It had been two years since he had contact of any sort with Tony Stark, the man he fell in love for and continued to love despite his absence. The sensation was astronomical, and Steve felt tears rushing to his eyes again. “Can I hold him? Please? He is cold. I would like to hold him.” He whispered, on the verge of begging. Tony shouldn’t feel this cold. Steve knew he was warm and maybe he could make Tony feel a little better. He’d do anything for him.
“I love you, Steve.” He tells him every night.
“He is going to be fine, I promise.” Rhodey gave him a little shove. “Seriously, Cap. Tony isn’t going down like this. Not until he gives a big ‘fuck you’ to Thanos.”
He cries for for a whole hour in the little corner of the room.
Having a tangible goal seems to bring a sense of purpose back to the avengers. He sees Clint looking at pictures of his family in silence. Nat spends all her time at the gym training. Banner locks himself inside of his lab for days on end to broaden his knowledge on the infinity stones. Thor stares at the horizon with a grave look on his face, undoubtedly thinking of his people of Asgard and the brother he lost.
It’s nice to……have him back.
The voice inside his head says.
“That was kind of the point. If I die because of this, they would report it as an accident, wouldn’t they?”
“Tony. Tony.” Steve presses his body closer to him. “Miss you. Need you.” After all that had happened, neither of them particularly enjoys being separated from each other. Every time he has to be away from Tony, he pretty much instantly start thinking about him.
Steve had said to the team earlier today.
“Very much so.” It is a strange sense of desire, to let the world know just how much he loves Tony, that Tony is taken and they are very happy together. To make sure people know Tony is
He……He would……
“No. I blame my stupid, self-sacrificing fiance.” Tony lights up a cigarette and breathes in, exhaling the smoke.  His lips curves into a humorless smile.
He doesn’t remember much about their trip up to space. He is sure the galaxy must had been beautiful, even after the catastrophic event of Thanos’ snap. He always wanted to see what space is like, even since he was a child. Yet he couldn’t spare himself even a second to appreciate the view when he finally had the chance, because he was too preoccupied with the quest of saving Tony.  Knowing that Tony was possibly alive made his heart swell with excitement, and the thought of Tony possibly dead in space filled his mind with indescribable agony. He was restless till the moment they found the spaceship with Tony and Nebula.
He doesn’t forcefully insert himself in Tony’s time with other, behaving beyond respectful of Tony’s space. He just wants to show Tony that he still cares, and he is doing it so very earnestly. It reminds Tony of the letter he got in the mail from Steve.
Steve. Tony finally calls him Steve. It feels like a dream. Lingering shock wraps itself around his organs, settling in his heart. He missed hearing his name from Tony’s lips. Not Cap, not Rogers, just Steve. He can’t help but to hold Tony closer to him endearingly.
Tony doesn’t talk about the nightmares, how he hardly sleeps. To be fair, he doesn’t think anyone is getting much sleep these days, and he is sure he is not the only one with nightmares.
“I think he lost it for a moment there. He thought you were dead.” Natasha shakes her head. “He thought he was too late.”
Peter looks up at him in surprise before lowering his head morosely again.
“Good night, Tony.” Steve replies wistfully, like he is missing something and waiting for it to return. “And Tony? I am really sorry about what happened to the kid.” He sounds incredibly genuine, bringing a sense of comfort to his heart.
A broken sob is heard. Tony almost wants to reach out and tell the person it’s alright, if his body isn’t hurting like his bones might shatter. Don’t cry for him, because he surely doesn’t deserve it.
He knows. He is the worst. But why does it matter? The person that used to be the most proud of him is now gone. So he can let himself be a disappointment if he wants to.
A new sense of purpose ripens in his chest. Nat tells him he is smiling more now.
“There was no logic to it, Tony. It all happened at random.” Steve coaxes him so gently, placing a hand lightly over his chest. “Breathe, Tony, breathe. Don’t think about it. Focus on what is real.”
So much for being a supersoldier.
Exhaustion claims him. The concept of time completely evades him.  He wonders if his glucose starved brain is capable of giving him one final dream before he dies. That’s not too much to ask for, is it? He tried his best, he really did. He made many mistakes, caused the loss of innocent lives, pushed away people he should have listened more to, waited too long to make amends. If he could go back in time, he would do it all over again differently, even if it meant enduring all the pain that came with it for the second time round.
After his involvement in Project Rebrith, Steve got used to being the subject of awe and admiration. As soon as he introduces himself as Captain America, most people immediately recognize his leadership and assume they have to follow his words. This excludes Tony. From the first time they’ve met, Tony has constantly challenged him and his worldview, pushing him outside his sphere of thinking. While it can be frustrating at times, he is truly grateful for it. He is self aware enough to know that he doesn’t always know the answer for every dilemma, and Tony brings him new perspectives to consider. Steve didn’t know how much he missed it until he didn’t have Tony with him anymore.
He can see the sadness flooding from Pepper’s eyes and Happy’s shoulders going stiff. Despite Happy’s initial annoyance with having to deal with the teenager, Tony knows he has grown to be quite fond of the boy. Everyone who has met Peter does. He was such a bright soul, so innocent, radiating with life. He doesn’t deserve this. He should be the one living right now. Not Tony.
A whisper reaches his ear, and the cloudiness in Tony’s mind suddenly clears. He wants to open his mouth and yell, he wants to hold up his arms to grasp him before he slips away again.
He loathes the sound of his own voice when he wakes up screaming. It’s too loud, and he doesn’t want the others to find out. But he would see the same scene over and over in front of him, the moment everyone but him and Nebula faded away. His heartbeat won’t calm down, and he can’t stop reaching, into the air, for nothing, just like that day when he tried to save Peter, and he turned into dust in his hands.
He can’t watch TV anymore, because the news just cannot stop reporting on the avengers’ fight for one second. He can’t sit here and listen to some random news reporter talk about Captain America like they had known him all his life. They know nothing about him.
They didn’t even know Steve Rogers was engaged.
Gripping the blanket in his hand, Steve presses his face gently to the soft fabric. How Tony still has room in his heart to tolerate Steve is entirely beyond him. After what had happened between them, he’d expect Tony to order him to get out last night. Tony isn’t a cruel person, he knows that, but he wouldn’t have blamed him if he were cruel to Steve. After all, Tony was right, about the threat from above. Steve couldn’t see it at the time, and he left Tony to deal with it on his own. He wished he was there to fight side by side with Tony when the Children of Thanos came to retrieve the Time Stone. Perhaps it would have made a difference. He will never know now.
Maybe he still is angry, but he didn’t wanted to see that look in Steve’s eyes. He never did.
Then he remembers all of it, memories rushing out from the floodgate of his brain. Steve held up the shield to protect himself from the energy blast, but it wasn’t enough. The shield shattered before his eyes and Steve Rogers was hit by the beam from six infinity stones. His heart was stopped instantly. Tony had screamed, crawling to Steve’s side trying to desperately revive him. Steve’s pupils were wild blown, blood dripping down the corner of his lips. His body was warm, still. Thanos held out his fist. He was going to kill him on the spot too but at the end he decided to spare him, knowing he had already broke Tony Stark to the point beyond repair, he might as well be dead.
Tony knows it’s his fault. He should have thought of that. How stupid of him, how can he have not considered that? The shield is Cap’s most prized possession. It was careless of him to not be prepared since he is in charge of everyone’s equipment.
The next time he wakes, he is on Earth, hooked up to a bunch of machines and monitors and tubes running fluids into his veins.
He doesn’t remember how long it had been, but eventually Nat had to leave. “
Her blood was dripping through her suit. She was injured too. She helped Tony back to the ship.
“Oh, Tony……” Pepper and Rhodey both gives him such a pained look before coming over to hug him. Tony cries hard in their embrace.
At 12:00 am eastern time, a photo of a well known billionaire posing with his engagement ring begins going viral on Twitter, as well as these messages tweeted by both parties involved.
Right. That’s what broke the shield last time.
“It’s my fault. It was a bad plan. Terrible plan. My fault. My fault my fault my fault—”
Tony stands up from where he is seated and takes the camera in his hand. He is walking to another part of his room. “Alright, so who knew Captain America draws in his free time? Well, it’s probably in the history book somewhere. But come on, you have got to see this.” The moment the camera focuses on the object of Tony’s interest, Steve can feel heat blooming on his face instantly.
“I was seventeen, nearly eighteen,” Tony informed him, body sagging as he rested his chin against the back of his palms and looked at Steve through the curl of his eyelashes. He shrugged again. “They were… God, I dunno, in their twenties, I think? Maybe 26-ish. I really don’t remember them that well.” At the look on Steve’s face, he just rolled his eyes and grinned resignedly. “Don’t freak out, Captain. I was more than willing, I pinkie promise.”
cold water. And suddenly it was all over his clothes, his face, his
The movie was about fifteen minutes deep when Steve’s eyes found themselves wandering. He looked over the cityscape for a long moment before he watched a small flickering light launch itself from the river and high into the sky. He knew exactly what it was, but he couldn’t help but jolt as the light exploded into the sky. The explosion sent brightly colored lights in every direction and a defining rumble ripped through his eardrum. Fireworks.
“Actually,” Steve muttered, biting his lip. “I was wondering if i could come with,” He said and there was a long, pregnant pause. ‘I-I mean if that’s okay,” he stammered. “I just wanted to make sure everyone got to their families and everything,” he explained. Tony was taken back by Steve’s request and it took him a moment to respond, but even the inventor as surprised by his own words.
?” Peter asked, motioning towards the TV as he noticed the movie was starting again. It must be TNT’s “continuous Christmas Story programming” that they had every year.  “I love that movie,” Peter then admitted.
That one decision to stay for just the night turned out to last for forty nine years. Forty nine  years of laughter and smiles. Fighting and tears. Apologizing and working together to make things work. Forty nine years of love.
“But why?” the little boy asked, his eyes growing wider. “I’m not important.”
Thank you all so much for your support!!!!! I really appreciate it, you have no idea!
“No, that would be fine,” he said with a nod. “The compound is on private property, no one will come snooping around for you there. And my team is trusted plus they’re under contract so if they say anything well…” he paused. “Yeah, that will work,” Tony said with a nod. “Plus, Vision will be happy to see you. I think he’s tired of only seeing me around the place.”
“Well, thank you for coming out Dr. Lucas. Do you have a status report for us?” Tony asked.
“Then that settles it. Steve will watch Peter till we are finished,” Pepper said as she stood up and grabbed Tony’s arm, hauling him out of his seat. “Let’s get you looking presentable. They will be here soon,” she said and began to tow the man out of the room.  “We’ll be back later Peter, just be good for Mr. Rogers and do what he tells you to do.” Pepper said with a small wave.
“I like Mr. America better,” Peter said as he took the plushie from Steve. “But I like it. Thank you.”  And with that he tucked the stuffed version of Steve under his arm securely.
“Of course we’re not,” Steve said as he shook his head, a small smile playing on his lips.
“I was just more stubborn back then,” Steve supplied, an amused look on his face.
“Uh...it’s...his name-
Tony was quick to lead Pepper over to the bed where Peter was quietly sleeping. His eyes were closed and his long lashes tickled his cheeks that were pushed up from the way he was sleeping against the pillow. Peter’s face was not peaceful. In fact it was very obvious that he had been crying, and a drying wet spot from the tears was evident on Peter’s shirt, but Tony tried to ignore that.  And to top it all off, the Captain America plush was held tight against Peter’s chest as he slept.
As Steve was leaving the tower, through one of the side doors, the man stilled, hearing a voice from down the hall. It was Tony’s voice. And even though he knew it would be problematic if he was caught, Steve still followed the voice. Just so he could see Tony again, if only for a moment. See him talking and breathing. Seeing him alive.
While waiting for the woman ahead of him, Peter’s eyes started to wonder, and he found himself staring at a strawberry-banana smoothie drink in the cooler ahead of him. Peter figured he should have something slightly healthy in his system to help fight off this could, so he plucked it out of the cooler and onto the counter.
“Okay. So that one went over your head. Guess we can’t win them all,” Tony muttered under his breath as he tousled Peter’s messy hair.
“I dunno...maybe ten minutes?’ Peter said carefully. “I didn’t want to wake you up...but then you woke up all by yourself,” the little boy explained.
Tony never woke up.
“I love you too Peter,” Tony said as he felt something whell up in his chest. “I love you to the moon and back.”
“You don’t know that Pepper,” Tony said dryly as he just blinked at the woman. “He’s so smart and he’s scared and-”
I know this chapter is super short, but I just wanted to get started on this....so think of this as a short prologue or something... hehe.
In the end, Peter ended up only buying the smoothie and was back on the subway. He drank the entire smoothie, but could hardly taste it. Peter wasn’t sure if it was because he was sick, or because he was so upset at himself that everything lasted awful.
“No. No way,” Steve said with wide eyes as Sam nodded slowly.
“I’m calm. I’m calm,” Tony said as he took a few deep breaths. “Pepper, I’m sorry to ask you this, but would you please come over. I know you’re busy with the new deal but-”
And then Steve saw it. There in the mix of everyone else, was Tony. His suit jacket was off and his tie was lazily undone, resting around his neck as the man moved around the room. A light sheen of sweat shimmered as Tony moved under a light, and Steve could see that Tony’s shirt was slightly damp as well. But the thing that really drove the Captain crazy was the movement of Tony’s hips.
The tears were falling before Steve could even notice.
“Oh,” Tony hummed as he raised his brows in surprise. “Since when did Captain America speak Spanish?” Tony asked with a chuckle as he leaned in closer, his breath hot on Steve’s skin.
“Sam,” Steve preseed. “I have to do this,” Steve said as his voice began to shake. Just the thought of talking to Tony again put him on edge. After all, the last time he talked to him, or even seen him, was in Serbia, and now he would be calling to tell him this kind of news? This situation was definitely getting him worked up.
“Yeah. Okay,” Peter nodded before standing up. “I better get his ham home before Pops starts to worry,” Peter laughed sourly as it turned into a coughing fit.
“ Subject 009 - “Peter”. Born August 27, 2013. Mother: Mary Fitzpatrick-Parker. Father: Tony Stark.”
“I found everyone’s file,” he said as he set the five folders on the coffee table before sitting down across from Steve. The blonde leaned forward and leafed through each vaguely. As he came to the last one Sam cleared his throat and leaned forward before tapping the top of the file. “You really need to look at this one.”
Pepper just happened to be at the New York location when Tony made his call. Normally Tony was the one to cancel meetings at a moment’s notice and take care of situations, but now it was her turn. Pepper was quick to clear the rest of her day, and she was soon heading towards the compound. Within two and a half hours, she had arrived.
Hi everyone! Sorry for the long wait for an update. Life has been a bit busy, but I'm still plugging away! I hope you guys enjoy!
“Yeah,” Steve stammered, nodding. “Hank Pym made me quite a few before I left. I shouldn't have a problem.”
? Hm?” Tony asked.
“My, my, my. You look a little worse for wear,” the trickster said as he looked Steve up and down. “Having a rough time?” The only thing Steve could think to do was let out a strangled laugh as he took another swig of his drink, almost choking on it.
The compound was fairly empty as Steve made his way inside. From what he remembered, it used to be bustling with people. This was, however, after his squabble in Siberia. Half of the Avengers were on the run, and Steve was sure the other half had been pushed out by Tony. He was always one to brood.
“I mean, when you put it that way, it sounds pretty lame,” Steve said with a heavy sigh.
“You’re doing great,” Steve hummed. “Now tell me four things that you can feel.”
“Nah,” Clint said, shaking his head. “He left the base as soon as Steve said he was calling you. He wanted me to come with him...but I can’t just leave this place unprotected. Especially with the kids here,” He said, crossing his arms over his chest. “I figured I would hang around till you got here,” he explained.
“I appreciate it Clint. Seriously,” Tony said as he did his best to look at Clint in the eyes. “You can leave though,” I have a team coming soon. F.R.I.D.A.Y. can watch the place with my suit till they get here,’ Tony explained.
“I uh-” Steve stammered, trying to get his muddled brain to work. “Counting the tesseract, three,” Steve said, blinking a few times.
“Why not Pete?” Steve asked, his brow knitting together.
“Don’t say that,” Tony suddenly said, his face still buried in Steve’s shoulder. “You’ve always been my Steve. Ever since we had that conversation on the bench, you’ve been my Steve,” Tony hiccuped.
Steve had been conflicted all day. It started with one thing, and then it began to snowball from there. He felt guilty when Peter had tried on the glasses. He insisted that Peter wait, but when Peter said he wanted to surprise Tony, well, he couldn’t say no. The boy seemed so eager, he didn’t want to dampen his spirits.
“Did you say my bed is hard?” Tony asked as his browns pulled together in confusion. “I’ll have you know that I have a very nice and comfortable bed.
“The other children have a few other issues, but that’s all Peter has. Physically at least.” Dr. Lucas said with a small smile. Tony opened his mouth to say something but the doctor raised a hand to quiet the man down. “I looked over the blood sample that was left for me, as well as the file that they had on Peter.”
“Car. I see a car. And-” The man paused, taking in a strangled breath. “A n-no parking sign. And-” Suddenly Tony’s head was tilting up to look at the source of the voice. “I see you, Steve.”
?” Tony asked as he pulled his forehead away from the other man and cocked his head to the side. “
“Is it okay if I just sit here with you for a little bit?” Peter asked, sniffing back some snot as he looked at Tony.
So a few things here:
“Both you and Tony are so concerned about my sleep schedule,” Steve said with a tired laugh as he shook his head.
The soldier loved the small curl to Tony’s lips when he smirked; he loved those big brown eyes that were shaded by long, heavy, lashes. Steve loved Tony’s loud laugh and confidence in almost every situation. And the man loved Tony’s true self when he was away from the public eye. He didn’t care what the news tabloids said about Stark. He didn’t care what the man had done in the past.
Secondly, have anything you want to share with me about this fic? Or want to find some stuff/extras for this fic? You can find it under the hashtag: "YAMS Fic" on Tumblr.  I've decided to do a little bit more on Tumblr with this fic so that's what is behind that....(and Honestly, I just started the hashtag today, so don't expect anything for a little bit.)
“Tony, you need to calm down. Please,” Pepper cooed. It was clear that the Inventor was on the edge of a panic attack.
“The thing I don’t understand Steve, is why you’re here,” Peggy said, sipping some tea she had prepared. It was now long past daytime as the two sat in the woman’s living room, the lamp light illuminating their faces.
Dancing was not Steve’s thing, though. That much he knew for sure. He always stepped on people’s feet or didn’t get into the groove of the music. The last thing he wanted to do was embarrass himself in such a public place. And even though Tony pleaded with him to dance, the blonde still refused. Tony didn’t need to know that his super-solider-boy-friend was a klutz, especially when their relationship was in its infancy.
“Aunt Pepper!” Peter giggled as egg spewed from his mouth and onto the table and plate underneath him.
“I didn’t recognize you with you beard,” Peter said, his eyes trained to the table a few inches in front of him.
“Steve,” Tony muttered as he approached the blonde. “Get some rest. Everyone is safe, you’ve done enough for now.” With that Tony walked out of the med wing and made his way to his private suite.
“And that’s where you’re wrong kiddo,” Tony said as he lifted a shaky hand and rested it on Peter’s shoulder. “We...We are...We’re connected in a lot more ways than you think.” Tony was having a lot of emotions coming up and he wasn’t sure if he should bring the subject up now, but before he could fully think, words were coming out of his mouth.
By the time Steve had realized that he was staring, Tony had noticed the gaze of his boyfriend and was dancing towards the solider. Not only had Tony noticed where Steve’s eyes were directed, but he also noticed how aroused Steve seemed to be. It wasn’t hard to notice the bulge in the Captain's pants.
“Sorry Pep, Peter seems to like a firm mattress,” Tony said, turning his head to look at the woman a little closer. “So what brings you here this early in the morning?” he asked.
“You died,” Steve suddenly said, his voice hollow as he spoke. “You died trying to-”
? Peter felt empty, he was sure Pops and Dad felt empty. Wasn’t this a feeling that newly divorced family’s felt? This wasn’t new for Peter. So why did he feel so terrible? Was it because when he was younger his parents felt they had to make things up to him by making Christmas feel special? Didn’t they know that even though Peter was older, he still desperately wanted to feel like a kid again? Or was he just getting older? Was this what Christmas was like for all adults? If it was, Peter never wanted to get older.
“Okay Bailey, we’re going to get you out of here. You hear me?” Steve said as he began to shuffle down the hall with the girl in his grasp. “Just follow me and we’ll get you home.” As soon as they passed another door, though, the girl stopped.
------
“Sam. Clint. West Wing. I need you here now,” Steve called over his com as he began to make his way back towards the small child he had left at the front of the wing. But as he walked, something made him stop.
“Next Stop, Eighth Street,” The voice over the subway system called out, dragging Peter from his thoughts.
“I’m sorry Steve. I’m so sorry,” Tony cried. “I ruined our night. It was supposed to be perfect and I ruined it!”
“Listen Rhody, I-“ He began as he turned around, only to be cut short as his eyes landed on Peter. “P-Peter!” He said, his entire face lighting up as a large smile grew on his face. “Hey squirt!! What are you doing here!?” He said as he stood up and fell over the couch before he was standing next to Peter, pulling him into a hug. It seemed like a desperate hug, like Tony never wanted to let go, but Peter was giving him a bigger hug back.
“Who…” Pepper began as she looked at the picture before turning her head to look down at Tony. She paused for a moment, the wheels turning in her head before she spoke again. “Were they in the place? The Lab?”
“We’re in New York, Tony,” The voice said as the fingers of the hand began to run through Tony’s hair. “We’re in Brooklyn, on a side street.It’s June 21st and it’s nine thirty. You’re here with me, you’re husband, and you’re safe,” the voice tried, but Tony just let out another strangled gasp.
“Good morning Peter,” Pepper hummed as she leaned on one arm and reached out with the other to snag an apple off of Tony’s plate. “Did you sleep okay in your new bed?” she asked, pulling off a few seeds before popping it into her mouth.
Peter suddenly stopped squirming and turned his head to look up at Steve with his big doe-eyes. His breath hitched in his throat for a moment and Steve was afraid he might have another attack, but the boy just stared at him.
After about five minutes Tony cleared his throat and turned around to see Steve who was just standing in the doorway. With a motion of his hands, Tony directed Steve into the hallway with him before closing the door.
“Oh Tony,” Pepper sighed as she hugged her jacket close to her body and proceeded towards the stairs that seperated the business part of the compound with the living quarters. As she rounded the corner, though, she nearly ran headfirst into a large man who was headed in the opposite direction.
“Only if you want me to,” Pepper said with a kind smile. -- And that was how the two ended up walking towards the medical wing.
Tony took the man’s hand and gave a firm handshake before he walked into the room so that he could see the two adults better, as well as Bailey and the other occupants. Pepper simply stood in the doorway and watched.
“It’s good to see a familiar face. Even if it’s yours,” Steve said, and he meant it.
“Oh my god,” She cried, her body shaking as she held on to Steve tightly. “I-I’m being saved by Fucking Captain America,” She said before burying her head into Steve’s shoulder. Steve was obviously very taken back by what was happening, but was quick to snap out of it as he rested a hand on the girl’s shoulder.
“Beat him up Mr. America! Beat him up,” He cried as tears fell down his cheeks.
“Oh my God!” a loud voice sounded from the kitchen down the hall. Peter’s heavy eyelids slowly slid open as he listened for the voice to sound again. It sounded like Pops, but in Peter’s groggy state, he wasn’t quite sure.
“My savior has arrived,” Tony proclaimed as he tried to pull Peter back to his earlier position. “Mind holding the kiddie?” he asked as he turned to face Steve. The blonde strode into the room, closing the door behind him and in a moment he was in front of Tony with open arms.
“I do,” the man said as he motioned for Tony and Pepper to follow him towards his desk. Doctor Lucas sat down in his chair and began to type things into the computer as he spoke. “All three children have a few things in common. Malnutrition, a little bit of dehydration...and worms.” The doctor said, causing Tony to raise a single eyebrow. “Actually everyone who was held captive has worms. After talking with the older girls, it is my understanding that their food was delivered to them on a dirt floor that was never cleaned. Honestly it’s not surprising. But all of them are are being treated for that now.” Dr. Lucas said, trying to put Tony’s look of panic at ease.
“Hey Spangles,” Tony huskily muttered as he came within a few feet of Steve, still dancing. “C’mere.” With that he lifted one hand and did a come hither, motion with his index finger. And as if by magic Steve abruptly stood up and made his way over to the dancing man.
“Jesus Fucking Christ!” Tony screamed as his heart leaped up into his throat. The man knew that it was Peter, he absolutely knew. Even a split second before he reacted Tony knew it was likely that it was his child, but his body was on autopilot. As Tony screamed his bolted upright and practically dove over onto the other side of the bed. It was silent as Tony just sat there blinking back at the two eyes that returned his gaze.  “Peter?” he finally stammered.
