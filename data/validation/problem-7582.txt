“It’s come up a few times,” Steve says, pressing a kiss where skin meets the reactor before he shifts, watching with pleasure at the way Tony’s face reacts to their cocks brushing together.”
“We could go to France.”
The compound is quiet as Steve pads through the hallways to the kitchen, and he almost asks FRIDAY if Tony’s asleep but doesn’t want to risk the temptation of seeking him out if he’s not asleep. Steve doesn’t even know what he would say.
“Do you—I mean we could tell the rest of the team,” Tony says. “They could be on standby, if—”
Steve kisses him again before he lines his cock up and slowly pushes inside Tony, trying to take his time, even though part of him wants to just bend Tony in half and fuck him hard. The gold belt of the bikini is bunched up around Tony’s waist, the bra twisted around and half covering the reactor, and Steve’s so fucking overwhelmed that Tony would do this for him.
“What?” Steve looks back up, his brow furrowed. “No, Tony, it’s not about you. Not like that. You just—you’ve been through a lot, and I’m intruding on your life by being here—”
It’s grounding, having Steve’s mouth on him, and Tony gets lost in the kiss, wanting to hold onto that feeling. Tony’s ass is on fucking fire, and he nips at Steve’s bottom lip when Steve pulls away.
Steve swallows and pulls Tony even closer to him. “You too,” he says. “I—you too.” Steve can’t quite say the words back yet, even though he feels it every second he’s with Tony. The words get stuck in his throat whenever he tries, and part of him feels terribly guilty for that, but when he finally says it, he wants to mean it with every fibre of his being. “I can’t—” Steve buries his face against Tony’s hair. “Sorry.”
There’s silence from Steve and then—.
“Hi,” Tony says as Steve steps under the spray, the water flattening his hair against his head. “You staying here tonight?”
Steve’s mind is still stuck on the perfect match comment when Tony hands him the hot chocolate piled high with mini marshmallows and he almost stumbles over his own feet as they walk away. The market is fairly busy, but they go unnoticed, browsing the stalls as they make their way through the crowds.
“JARVIS? Have you alerted the others?” Steve asks as he leaves Tony’s bedroom and heads to his own floor.
“That I was a fuck up. That I wasn’t worth your time. That I didn’t deserve you.” Tony looks down, avoiding Steve’s gaze. “That I don’t deserve you.”
“Ma’am? Do you know where Mr Stark went?”
“Tony—”
“I assume you want me to pay,” Tony says, smiling when Steve rolls his eyes. “But if you don’t want me to leave, well, I’ve got no plans.”
“I’m not saying that for sympathy,” Tony says, picking up his mug. “I just want you to know, that’s something I’m making peace with.”
“Hawkeye? How’s Widow?” Steve asks, ducking out of the way as Bucky throws a punch.
“Steve?”
The garage has a car service on call for their use, and Steve settles into the back seat of one of the cars. He doesn’t know what to expect from SHIELD now. If Tony’s suspicions are right, then he’s going to have to be on guard constantly, and that—.
But not this time.
“How’s it looking?” he asks, digging his toes into the sand, his glass resting against his thighs.
“Yes,” Tony says. “She knows. It depends on how she is, whether she remembers, but she was told. She gets told whenever she forgets. I make sure she does.”
“I still can’t believe you did this,” Steve says when Tony breaks the kiss, brushing their noses together.
“Is that a yes?”
“Nope,” Tony says as he lifts his head. “Oh, coffee.”
Steve thinks he looks gorgeous.
“Why did you move here?” Tony asks, his curiosity piqued.
“Back at you,” Tony says softly. “No one else I'd be wearing lingerie for in my fifties.”
When Tony walks into the back room he immediately spots the sunset painting Steve sent him a photo of, and he pauses in the middle of taking his jacket off, taking in all the details Steve somehow managed to get from the photo Tony sent him.
“Tony?” Steve’s voice comes through the door. “Are you okay?”
Steve stops by a hot dog cart and buys some street meat, wolfing it down as he continues walking, taking in the ways that Manhattan has changed, and the ways that it hasn’t. Sometimes when he walks he heads down to the LES and crosses over the bridge to Brooklyn, but not today. He’s all too aware of how easy it is for him to get lost in his head when he’s in Brooklyn, the memories hitting him a little harder some days, and he doesn’t want to be distracted when he meets Tony for dinner later.
Fuck, Steve can’t wait to be inside him.
“Yes, boss?”
Pushing himself off the bed, Tony grabs a robe and wraps it around himself, loosely fastening it as he shifts from foot to foot, trying to see how steady he is. Judging himself to be okay, he yawns. “I’m going to shower,” he says. “And to clean the dead rat out of my mouth.”
Natasha shoots him looks whenever he turns down a mission from Fury, and Steve wonders if she suspects that he’s keeping something from her. It’s not that he doesn’t trust her, or Clint, but nothing’s confirmed and the more people who know about it, the more they risk it getting out and Steve doesn’t want to know how Hydra would react to that.
Tony lets out a soft chuckle as he slowly follows Steve back to sleep.
Steve’s chest rumbles as he laughs, and Tony smiles, kissing Steve’s laugh lines, knowing he’s going to be clinging to Steve for as long as he can. And if he’s honest about it, Tony kind of hopes that means forever.
“Now, if you want to eat the pineapple, I’ve heard that—” Tony grins against the kiss that cuts him off and wraps his free hand around Steve’s waist, pressing his fingers against his skin. Tony can feel the sun through the window hitting his skin, and the knowledge that they have another day ahead of them with nothing to do fills him with what feels like happiness.
“Just sleep?”
“I can hear you thinking,” Tony mutters, his breath hitting Steve’s chest and making Steve’s nipples perk up. “Stop that.”
“Just trying to lighten the mood,” Tony says. “Look, there’s a lot of ways this could go, and I don’t know where all the pieces are going to fall, but I do know that I’m by your side in this. That however you want to play it, I’m backing you. I don’t want you to think I’m not.”
“Then you’ve managed to work out what Clint never did,” she says, padding over to the fridge and taking out two Gatorades. “Here,” she says, handing one over to Steve. “Rehydrate before lunch. Shower, meet me in the lobby in thirty minutes.”
“Oh, those words coming out of your mouth sound so wrong.”
Steve laughs. “Okay,” he says. “We won’t play that.”
“Also gone away, I don’t know where.”
There’s a rap at the shutters next to the wide open door Tony has at the back of the beach house and he frowns, glancing at the time. It’s not late, but he’s not expecting anyone given that no one actually knows he’s here.
“Because I think you’d look incredible,” Steve says. “God, Tony, seeing those photos of you—all I could think is how good you’d look in that outfit now. How amazing your ass would look covered in lace, your legs in those stockings, and that I’d be the only one getting to see you look that perfect.”
When the elevator reaches Tony’s floor, Steve pushes what he’s seen to the back of his mind and walks straight to Tony’s bedroom, knowing Tony’s following him. Shrugging his coat off, Steve drops it on the couch and turns to look at Tony only to find him staring at him with wide eyes. Steve pulls at the edge of his t-shirt and tugs it over his head, holding it in his hand for a moment before it follows the coat onto the couch.
“It’s—Steve, please—”
“Tony, can we—”
Steve hadn’t even noticed the sweater Tony’s wearing, and he takes a step back to fully take it in. Tony’s sweater is bright red with a snowman that has a knitted nose sticking out, and, like Steve’s, there’s lights draped all over the snowman, but Tony’s sweater has the addition of what looks like glitter sewn into the snowman’s fluff.
“I’m sorry.”
“I shouldn’t really be showing you this without an NDA, but Natasha trusts you all here, so—” Tony shrugs his jacket off and lays it on the chair before he grips the bottom of his t-shirt. “Long story short, when I was kidnapped, I—it wasn’t pretty, and I had to do something to stay alive. I understand if you don’t want to tattoo me after seeing it, but—”
“You’re such a stubborn—” Tony pauses as some kids run by them. “Butt.”
“Fuck,” Tony breathes out, looking up at Steve, running his hands along Steve’s arms. “I—fuck. I didn’t think—”
“What?” Steve asks, when Tony pauses.
“We can handle these kids,” she says, raising an eyebrow. “You can go find him.”
And the thing is, Tony’s right. They could’ve done this sooner, and maybe it would’ve worked out then, Steve doesn’t know, but they’re here now, and Steve—he couldn’t ask for anything more. Leaning over the mess of wrapping paper between them, he kisses Tony softly, letting their mouths play together in a quiet reassurance of what he feels.
“You turned out okay,” Steve says, nudging Tony’s thigh with his foot. “I’m pretty fond of you.”
Letting Tony guide him through the hallways, Steve tries not to think too much about what he’s about to face, how wrong it could go, and before he knows it, they’re outside Peggy’s room. Steve pauses, watching Tony fiddling with the flowers he brought from New York. “You go in,” Steve says. “See how she is. If she’s good, then—then I’ll come in. If not, we can—I’d cause more pain if she’s not cognisant.”
Tony ducks his head, Steve’s comment warming something in his chest. “Thanks,” he says quietly. “I tried to go back to the tower, but—”
“That’s Mr Rogers-Stark, thank you very much,” Steve says, winking at Tony before he starts the machine and gets to work.
“Forgive me for being stuck on the fact that I’m having to wake
“Last night you said you wanted me in a bed,” Tony says, raising an eyebrow when Steve looks up at him. “Looks like we’re in a bed.”
“If you’re looking for gratitude you’ll be in for a long wait,” Steve says when they reach the elevator.
“Stay?”
“I love you,” Tony interrupts. “And you—this is as much for me as it is for you, trust me,” he says. “Fuck, I wish I could touch you.”
“Come here,” Tony says, holding out his arms. “Jesus, Steve, just—”
It’s like a never ending pleasure cycle, and Tony sinks into it more with every kiss Steve gives him, with every scrape of Steve’s nails down his back, with every shift of their bodies against each other and Tony—Tony just
“You could move your hand up a bi—
“No,” Steve says. “But—”
“Really?”
“Okay,” Tony says, more to himself than JARVIS. “Old favourites it is.”
Meeting Tony’s eyes, Steve hesitates. “You think I should tell them,” he says.
“You want to give up the shield?”
“Cut off the head and two more take its place,” Steve says. “That’s Hydra. Fuck, Tony, even if we take down this branch, there’s more out there.”
“Yeah,” Steve says, the shame of admitting it making his cheeks heat up.
“And I told you to fuck off,” Tony whispers, remembering the sterile hospital room and Steve by his bed, looking exhausted. “I never wanted you to see me like that. I—I was embarrassed, and I knew what you were thinking.”
“Wait, Sam?”
“There it is.”
“And you’re not giving yourself enough,” Steve says, setting his jaw stubbornly. “No one else even asked me what I wanted when I woke up, you—you let me live.”
“Then we try again,” Tony says. “Steve, you can’t put this much pressure on yourself. All you have to do is convince Pierce that you’re Hydra, and no one knows Hydra better than you.”
“Part of being a team, right?” Natasha says, the corner of her mouth turning up in a hesitant smile. “If we are all a team?”
“You—
about this?”
“That’s not what I was going to say,” Steve says, watching Tony drain his coffee before he tries to steal Steve’s mug. “You can’t have my coffee.”
“Ah yes,” Peggy says, her hands smoothing the quilt over her lap. “I heard about that, wondered if I was losing my mind, given everything.”
“I know.”
“Jesus,” Tony says, swallowing. “Who taught you how to talk like that?”
“Yeah,” Steve says with a small shrug. “Figured I could at least try and organise them since you probably threw everything in boxes with no rhyme or reason.”
“I don’t see the need,” Tony says with a shrug. “I do what I can, and sure, accolades are nice, but—”
Steve’s chest rumbles with a laugh, and he takes his hand away, ignoring Tony’s frustrated whine. “Now you know how I felt when I saw those photos,” he says, seeking out Tony’s mouth and kissing him. Tony’s arms wrap around him, pulling him down, and Steve goes with it until they’re sprawled out on the couch trading lazy kisses. His hands slip underneath Tony’s sweater as the polaroids fall to the floor, and Steve can’t bring himself to care. Not when he’s got the real Tony underneath him making all kinds of sounds.
“There it is.”
“Quick question,” Tony says. “What do you think the possibility of Hydra having a super soldier of their own is?”
The smile fades from Tony’s face at the reminder, and he nods. “I can’t come with you, and they’ll scan you,” he says. “They’ll take your phone.”
and didn't know the man was alive until everything with the Mandarin and Killian had been cleared up. But Tony was with Pepper and was happy, so as much as Steve had pined, he would never get in the way of something Tony had been searching for for all his life. Then everything had happened with Bucky, so Steve felt like he didn't have a right to be included in Tony's happiness.
"No," he says quietly as Tony reaches the door to leave. He knows Tony heard it, sees the way the man stops with his hand on the door handle. Tony doesn't look back, doesn't acknowledge what he said. He opens the door and Steve watches his back until the door swings shut behind him.
Thanos had told Tony,

The world whitened out.
Tony's smirking face invaded Steve's vision, clearly knowing what he was thinking about. The man leaned down and captured Steve's lips with his own, the kiss starting chaste but turning dirty soon after. Steve tried to stop himself, tried to tell himself that Tony was with
Like the one Steve had slammed his shield into.
he thought, the world around him pulsing yellow, making him squint his eyes.
Steve took a moment to think, looking around the room. He knew it wasn't because he was still in love with Peggy. He still loved her -- he thinks he always will -- but it had faded when he had gotten used to the future. Peggy would always be a big part of his life, his first love, but she had also moved on. He needed to respect that. She was happy here, with Daniel. Probably way more than she could ever be with him.
"I think this, Steve, it's okay. You can lay down now. The world is going to be okay without. There's no more fight. There's no more war. You get to finally rest."
Steve wretched himself out of Tony's hold and scrambled out of bed, clinging to his chest as he suddenly couldn't breathe. He gagged, felt the guilt wash over him in waves so deep he felt like he was drowning again. He had left Tony in Siberia all by himself, injured and his suit broken, all because he hadn't been brave enough to tell him about what the Winter Soldier had done to his parents. He hadn't thought about the fact that Tony could have

name in the two years after Siberia. During all the visits where his Bucky was half there, poking fun and straining to make it seem normal between them. It was odd that Bucky seemed to always know who Steve was smitten on. And even with the ideals that they had grown up with (and the fact that it had been illegal), Bucky seemed to not care that Steve was attracted to men.
"I'm sorry, Tony," Steve croaked, realizing that he couldn't feel anything anymore. His body wasn't reproducing his cells, the ice cold pain that had flooded his veins and froze his nerve endings completed his task. He could feel his eyes drooping shut, tried to keep them open. He was breathing hard, couldn't fill his lungs. It was like he was stuck in bed with a fever so bad he could barely move, breathe, do
, he just needed to get Bucky out and away and safe.
Sarah leaned down to the Steve cowering under the table and coaxed him out. Steve watched his younger self throw his arms around his mom and burrow his tear stained face into her shoulder. Sarah soothed her son by running a hand through his hair until he was able to talk, to which he then pulled away and asked between sobs still wracking his tiny body, "Wh-why didn't you j-just stay down, mama?"
he put his fists up in defense, going for another swing before the man he had told to shut up socked him right in the jaw.
She was with her family.
"That's not what Bucky said," Sam joked, giving Steve a smile. Steve found himself scoffing and shaking his head.
"Was it worth it?" Tony asks, cutting through the silence that had fell between them again. Steve doesn't answer, but knows it anyway. Can feel the way it digs into his chest, a punch to his heart. Knows the way it grabs onto his spine and holds it. It burns his throat, makes him feel like he's having an asthma attack again, even if he knows he can't have those anymore. And when Tony scoffs, shakes his head, and stands to leave, Steve can't force it down anymore.
It's a good thing this was only a vision brought on by the stone. Steve didn't deserve Tony. He never would.
"What?" Steve followed dumbly, though once he was in the bar, the lights glared blue, so bright that Steve had to close his eyes. His right arm was starting to ache, and Steve thought that maybe he was feeling what Bucky had when they had given him the metal one, but when he opened his eyes again, all he could see for a second was ash and dirt. When his vision become less bleary, he was met with Bucky, Sam, Thor, and Tony kneeling around his body. He was propped against something, whether it was rubble from the blown up Compound or something from the ship Carol had destroyed, Steve wasn't quite sure. All he knew is that his body was too numb to move. The only thing he could really feel right now was the pain pulsing from his right arm and the serum trying its hardest to fix him.
▫ ▫ ▫
When he was half-way up the steps, he understood why he felt so on edge. On the back of the SHIELD agent in front of him, a small red laser blinked on and moved around, lining up the shot. Steve turned his head, saw the shine of the scope in the window of the building across the street and found himself swearing under his breath. With a growl, he shoved himself into the back of them in front of him, the man falling with a yell just as the gunshot sounded and the bullet planted itself in his flesh, somewhere near his neck.
"Bucky has always been full of shit."
Steve let his eyes slip shut again.
"I'm the one who did the worst of it. I'll take the blame, you guys'll get a slap on the wrist. Everything will be fine," Steve told her, still looking at her through the mirror. Her green eyes stayed on him, an inquisitive glint sparking. Natasha was always observing her surroundings, piecing together any information she could. So, she knew that that wasn't the whole truth. Her perfectly coiffed eyebrow raised higher and Steve sighed, turned, and leaned back against the sink. He ran a hand through his newly blond hair again and crossed his arms over his chest, mimicking Nat's posture. "And that way, Tony doesn't have to be alone."
He glanced over, couldn't help but smile as he noticed Sam jogging beside him. It wasn't like that day in Washington, when he had been running for a warm up to the mission he was about to go on. This was simply two friends jogging together, pacing the other, keeping the other company.
Steve had managed to get a flight back to New York, get on without being detected, even without the beard. Sure, the baseball cap and glasses he had once sported while on the run with Natasha way back when had helped make it easier, but he was still able to board with minimal problems. Clint, Scott, Sam, Wanda, and Natasha had all said their goodbyes in the apartment they had rented that week, not wanting to risk being arrested in case this didn't go well for Steve.
Sarah cupped his face, the blood still on her's, and wiped his tears away with her thumbs, "Because, and you listen close, Steven..." Steve watched himself sniffle, a minuscule nod barely seen before Sarah continued, "... you always stand up."
"Safe," Steve tells him. He can't tell him how T'Challa is keeping him in Wakanda. It's a violation to the Accords that the King had signed and Steve has caused enough problems due to that stupid thing. He still doesn't believe in it. But, if part of the bargain to lessen the sentence for the people who fought with him is to sign it, he'll sign it.
▫ ▫ ▫
"Funny, that's what he said about you."
Peggy and Daniel exchanged a look, before Peggy was dragging Steve to the living room, leaving him in the middle of the furniture to turn the music back on. The phonograph was off to the side, record already in, ready to play. Peggy just had to put the needle down and return to Steve. With an aching feeling in his chest, Steve missed how easy it was to ask J.A.R.V.I.S to play the old classics he used to listen to back in the day. He used to be able to get lost in the music as he drew pictures of New York's (and then DC's) skyline or just people that came to mind.
She ran a soothing hand through his hair, the green in her eyes matching that of the landscape. It's where he got those speckles in his eyes, the ones Zemo was so excited to point out before everything with Tony and Bucky had happened.
Steve knew it was Nat. He was grateful she didn't try to approach him. He had a feeling that if she did, this whole thing would be over for him.
Steve turned to the T.V, staring at the screen. "I'm just ready to watch the movie." And if he spent the movie staring at Tony, that was nobody's business but his.
▫ ▫ ▫
It was peaceful. Even with the sky already pulsing a muted yellow, Natasha not in sight, it was nice. Steve gave Sam a look, picking up his pace to pass the man, before he was saying over his shoulder, "Race ya!"
he had that type of repertoire with Nat. Plus, Nat and I have Budapest to prove our bond."
The street was not as busy as it would have been today, the architecture different, and it took a moment for Steve to realize that he was back in the 1940s. But, he himself wasn't back to the body he had been used to in that time, the small sickly one. Instead, he was post-Project: Rebirth, though he was wearing a plaid and a pair of slacks, feeling the hole in the side of his shoe as he turned. The world was tinged blue, something that Steve only started to notice when he truly look, had to get himself to focus, but it was hard. It hurt his head more than it should have.
every time Katniss and Peeta did something cute, Bruce winced when the genetically modified mutts were on screen, Nat criticized every single person's fighting form (except Katniss'), Tony looked like he was barely watching, distracted by some equation in his head that would probably be some fantastic invention. And Steve stared. Because that's all he really could do.
When he breaks off the kiss, he staggers back and looks at Steve and then at Pepper with undisguised joy, both their faces warm in the firelight, contentment curling around them all like smoke. “Dinner time,” he says, rubbing his hands together. “Man, I wish I’d made something fancy now like coq au vin, but it’s just meatballs and spaghetti.”
Tony thinks of the photo of Peter he was looking at even as he was pouring champagne back there in the kitchen. “I don’t forget.” He knocks back half his glass. “But yeah, I thought it would be good to get away from the city, build a little pocket of paradise for ourselves where we can. Take a page out of Barton’s book, as I said.”
“Can I kiss Steve?” he asks.
And Steve does, and it's the best night Tony’s ever had, even laced with heartache.
“Yeah. And Sam. And Wanda. So many others.”
what trumps everything else. You can’t let go of that because it’s who you are. And you know what Iron Man can’t let go of? Captain America. Because Captain America was meant to be his friend, his partner, somebody who could be by his side through every chaotic situation the world threw at them, and instead Captain America left him bleeding and broken on a Siberian hillside.”
Tony picks up the chair and turns away to slot it onto the top of a stack. Teamwork, sure, that’s all this is about. Not something buried much, much deeper and closer to the heart, like shrapnel. “Here I thought
brooding,” he says indignantly. But maybe he is a bit. It’s just every time he looks at the shield it still echoes through him, the clang it makes against his suit of armour. Its impact still reverberating, a thrum that goes so deep it’s impossible to separate from his own pulse.
“Um.” Steve takes it out and shows it to Tony in his open palm.
“That is
as a baby?” Pepper whispers in his ear, and he flinches and turns his head to glare at her.
“I wanna hold her now,” he says, selfishly, just so that in the process of taking Morgan from Steve, his skin can brush against Steve’s, casually, their hands overlapping.
“What’s the point?” He leans back and presses an ear against the swell of her belly to hear a different thud, the sounds of their baby kicking. So much fight in them, though they’re coming into a world that’s already lost. “He doesn’t need it anymore.”
Tony gets out of there before he does anything stupid, and he drives away. Halfway there, he gets a call from Pepper, and when he answers, she screams down the phone and he nearly crashes the car, though thankfully his car’s much smarter than him. He babbles, “I’m on my way, shit, Pep, I’m on my way,” and oh god, they’re really going to have a—
“Oh, and you’re a man of your word now, are you?” Tony tries to give Steve a flippant smile, but he suspects it looks a tad watery; even his facial muscles aren’t quite up to par. He thinks of lying in the cold, looking out at snow more endless than outer space. “But I guess it’s true you’ve already been there, done that. Twice would be overkill. Where’s your pal Bucky by the way? Didn’t make it?”
, and they’re both still alive, and there’s—there could still be a future for the two of them, if not for half the universe.
Tony shakes his head. “I don’t need it. I told you, I’m done. You can keep it, throw it in the trash, I don’t care
“What dream?”
Not just for her.
Steve has been strangely silent the whole time, but now he says, “You have to try. Tony. I don’t want to risk what we have either, but I know I’ll never be able to forgive myself if we don’t try, and I can’t live like that.” He’s sitting on the sofa, gripping a cushion so hard feathers might fly any second.
he were dust. If he could’ve been so goddamn lucky.
“I want to make amends,” he says, quietly, looking at the white floor. “The fact that he isn’t a pile of dust on the ground somewhere is luck that I shouldn’t
“You said don’t be a stranger,” Steve says. “Can I come in?”
Tony goes into the kitchen to refill his glass of champagne and Pepper’s, and on the way out he bumps into Steve. Leather jacket, slicked-back hair. Exhaustion that never fades from his face. Tony wonders if Steve, given the chance, would choose to go back into the ice and sleep for another seventy years.
He pulls a face at her. “Is this why we got married? So we could just volley the same question back and forth at each other all night long?” He gets up, dances away from her towards the door. “Can I get you something to eat? What’re you craving this fine 3am?”
“Can we pick up on that dream I had?” he asks.
But Steve’s pushing him against the car and kissing him, and Tony thinks—yeah, all of this was worth it, is worth it, and will always be worth it, no matter what comes.
The anger comes, like an energy surge, and he’s talking and talking, lashing out with words like Vanko’s electric whips, but none of them are actually the things he’s wanted to say to Steve for the past two years, or maybe they all are—he’s played out their reunion in his head more times than he can count.
Outside, Pepper sits with Morgan in her arms. The sun slanting in at just the right angle catches her hair, a swathe of it flame-bright. She looks up at Tony approaching her with Steve. Steve, who seems utterly astonished by the sight of this baby, like he’s never seen anything so small. Steve, whose hair is the same shade as the champagne in the glasses Tony’s holding, and whose presence here on this porch with Tony and Pepper and the baby makes Tony’s whole world fizz with something like possibility, big bubbles of irrepressible delight.

“You’re working on that again?” Pepper says, a hand falling gently on his shoulder. “It still looks like the same exact shield to me.”

Time was Tony might have made a scene. But he’s matured, mellowed in imminent fatherhood. He’s just here to see Steve, that’s all. He grabs a chair and sits down. People in the group go round in a circle and talk, and Steve listens and offers them reassuring remarks and comforting comments. It’s that
“Always?” Steve asks, rapt.
Tony has to marvel again at the wonder of it, that Morgan’s never known her father with the arc reactor. Never known Iron Man. Though she’s dipped in and out of the garage and seen all the gear lying around, she is wholly, blissfully unaware of him as somebody who’s saved the world. She only knows him as the person who’s popping another strawberry into her mouth.
“Um,” Steve says, which Tony takes to mean that he hasn’t really been watching anything but just staring blankly and thinking.
Captain Magnificent fucking Miracle brings the

. I’m going to roll it into the lake myself.” He gets up to do so but Steve grabs his ankle and Tony’s an ordinary human who can’t contend with that super strength, so he rolls his eyes instead and sits back down.
“I didn’t know,” Steve says, his free hand coming up to run through Tony’s hair, fingers tracing behind Tony’s ear. “I didn’t know. All I knew was every time I thought of you after we fought, it was like barbed wire in my chest. And I wanted you to call, Tony. I wanted you to call, not to ask me for help, but just to talk to me. I just wanted to hear your

Tony loves him for saying that, but he knows—they both know—what the right thing to do is, now that Tony
To Morgan, Tony turns and says, “It’s embarrassing because it’s like Daddy wanted to give Papa his heart to wave around in public.”
“Then you can come talk to me any time you want, outside of this group.” Steve’s face is lined with weariness. Even his hair’s flat. Tony just stares at him obscurely through the dark lenses until he gives up. “Stay if you must, but try not to draw attention to yourself.”
“Yeah, I told you I wasn’t going to smash it to pieces,” Steve says, and now he’s wearing the dopiest smile. Cheesy bastard.
my involvement.” Every conversation winds up in a dead end these days.
Space is beautiful, yeah, but he’s tired of it now. He wants to go home. He misses Pepper so much he feels like he might die of that first, before dehydration or starvation or asphyxiation kills him. Or maybe that’s wishful thinking; he doesn’t
“Steve, have you seen my ‘Proof that Tony Stark has a heart’ memento?” Pepper says, conspiratorially, and takes a sip of her white wine.
His mind’s already racing for solutions. Time travel. It’s a challenge he can’t back away from, a problem he has to solve, now that it’s been dangled in front of him as a possibility. He wants to be the person to make it work, and he still wants to save the world. But especially Peter Parker. Dumb kid who never knew when to stay well away from trouble. Dumb kid who also wanted to save the world.
“Can’t anyone come?” Tony says jovially, peering at Steve over the frames of his sunglasses. “This is a support group, isn’t it? What if I need your support?”
Pepper chuckles, leaning her head on his shoulder. “You would, wouldn’t you.”
The lake house is playing host to probably the biggest crowd it’ll ever see, which is to say just short of a dozen people. Music and champagne flowing through the rooms, a kind of composure that never graced the parties of Tony’s youth. Pepper picked the music because her music tastes run a lot calmer than his, definitely more suited to this brunch party than his favourite tunes would be. Tony crunches a crudité between his teeth and it’s the most normal he’s felt since the Decimation, even though he’s a
“Yeah. That was the idea. But I must have been drunk when I came up with it.” Tony covers his face with one hand. “I don’t want to look at that. Can someone take it away please? It’s atrocious design. It’s so ugly. What was I thinking, how could I let
“I—” Steve begins, but Tony doesn’t give him time to answer.
He puts down the glasses of champagne on the table and goes over to Pepper’s side and kisses her cheek.
Steve looks miserable, which is frankly stupid because he was the one who turned up unannounced to broach this subject. “I guess it’s something I’ve thought about, on my part. But you and Pepper are happy together and I don’t want to disrupt that in any way. I just want to be present. To see you more often, to be around to watch your daughter grow up. That’s all I’m asking for.”
“What?” Steve says, sounding flustered. “I… Tony, you’re married.”
She smiles at him, looking a little misty-eyed herself, before batting his shoulder. “Now go make me a grilled cheese sandwich. With Kraft Singles. Many Singles. Kraft Multiples.”
He reaches down for Steve’s hand, and he holds it. Steve doesn’t resist. They lace their fingers together, looking into each other’s eyes, and Tony feels weak like he’s been drifting in space for a month, hungry,
now, which is extremely not normal, but somehow it feels natural, right, and he hasn’t been freaking out over it as much as he thought he might.
.” An ill-advised decision to drive in the Monaco Grand Prix, for example. Palladium poisoning, ouch. All ancient history, but Natasha had witnessed it all. “Without her, I wouldn’t be a part of the Avengers. Oh wait, that’s no thanks to her, since she was the one who recommended that I be
of our past selves, I just don’t think it was worth it.”
“These tomatoes are gorgeous,” Tony says, eating another slice all by itself. “You really have some green fingers.”
Morgan is a jewel. His and Pepper’s child, with her little face and little hands and little feet, glowing and gurgling.
Ant-Man. Scott Lang. Who they’d all assumed had been one of the victims of the Decimation.
Steve tilts his head, looking at Tony, but Tony isn’t thinking about the vision he had of death and destruction spilling from space. He’s thinking about all the times he’s dreamt of Steve here in this house, and then about all the times he’s dreamt of Steve, warm in his bed. Yeah, if he could make
Tony—Tony’s had four good years with Steve.
“And… more?” Tony asks, with trepidation and hope in equal measure.
for you, it’s for the recycling, or it should be. It was a bad idea I had one time.”
He spends a few days working on it.
Tony’s going to cry. God, is she the one who’s pregnant or is he? No, no, it’s definitely her; he can’t take credit for all of the stuff she’s going through. He can only look at her adoringly and with misty eyes.
“But you’re saying you
A week later, Steve shows up again at nightfall.
, Pep.”
“Kraft Singles?” Pepper repeats, with some disgust and incredulity.
. But you never called. And I never did, either. And then my phone rang, and it was that number on the cell I’d given you, and I thought it’d be you when I picked up, but it was Bruce, telling me the world was ending. I really thought it would be you. But he said you’d gone into space. And you didn’t come back, and we thought you might really be gone, one of the unlucky half, or worse. It was hell. It was hell that you were gone and we hadn’t even spoken in two years and the last time we saw each other I’d nearly killed you.” Steve’s face crumples as he says this, and Tony kisses his forehead, heart bursting.
to die of anything ending in -tion. If anything is going to bring him to his end, let it be the thought of Pepper, the memory of her voice.
Pepper reaches out to put her hand over Tony’s, and he brings it up to his lips and kisses her knuckles. Her ring. God, they’re
baby.”
with you, it doesn’t matter where we go or what we eat.” He thinks about shawarma with Cap and Natasha and Bruce and Thor and Barton all those years ago, when they were just the sketchy outlines of a team that had yet to reach its full potential, not the charred and torn-up fragments of a team that never will. He can’t remember what that shawarma had tasted like; he can’t remember the satisfaction of winning, either. But once again he’s narrowly escaped death in space, so he’s at least fully aware of what
Steve doesn’t look surprised, but he doesn’t look ready to give up yet either. He takes out the arc reactor from his pocket and offers it to Tony. “Here. You might want this back.”
“Wow, Ms Potts, you sure do have a lot of feelings on this subject,” Tony says, a little shocked and a little in awe, running his fingers through Pepper’s sunset-gold hair.
walk into the battlefield with that thing?”
“Not as many as you do, Mr Stark, I’m sure.”
“There you are,” Tony says. Steve had driven here with Natasha but made himself scarce since arrival—Tony hadn’t been able to pin him down till this moment. “Welcome to probably the humblest abode I’ve had my entire life.”
Tony takes both of Pepper’s hands in his and stares into her eyes. “Honey, you can’t be picky about your food here at the end of the world.”
It’s only when he falls to the floor, all the energy going out of him and his vision dimming, that it hits him what he’s done, a more melodramatic gesture than anything he’s dreamt of before, and it’s all him, he’s the only one inhabiting his own skin, and he just
Steve’s eyes are glimmering with surprise. “You two are beautiful together,” he says, his breath in his throat, his voice the shakiest Tony’s ever heard it.
“I’m not craving anything except a straightforward answer to my question.” Pepper stalks—well, waddles—towards him. “That’s why we got married, so you could tell me things. And maybe I’d also like a grilled cheese sandwich.”
“We’ve arrived on Earth,” Nebula announces, touching his shoulder.
to an impeccable landing, so gentle that after weeks suspended in nothingness, Tony barely even gets to savour the sensation of their spaceship coming to a stop on solid ground.
, please—
and losing air, and in Steve’s wide blue eyes the whole universe lives—not half but all of it, the way it should be, teeming and vital and wondrous.
“Daddy doesn’t like it because it’s embarrassing,” Tony says. “You should never try to design anything when drunk. Got it?”

in her long green dress, tips her champagne flute towards Rhodey—her first glass of alcohol in nine months. “To Rhodey,” she says, “Morgan’s oddfather!” And Tony follows suit.
, oh god. He’s laughing just remembering this, though he’s not really laughing, just—exhaling heavily and then regretting it. And oh, look, Steve’s here. Intruding. This isn’t a dream though, he’s not quite asleep yet, he’s just reminiscing. The past, not the future. Or maybe it’s a dream after all, because Steve’s saying,
“No, Morgan, don’t,” Steve says, holding her hand. “Okay, it’s pretty bad. But if you made it for me, I should get to decide what to do with it.”
Even though he’s wearing sunglasses and a sloppy outfit in order to blend in, Steve spots him instantly, eyes widening. He walks over, stands too close to Tony and asks, under his breath, “What are you doing here?”
“Tony,” Pepper says, in her impatient voice, “remember when I came back to you after we had our break and you would take out that silly little flip phone all the time and ponder it like you were staring down a deep well of misery? Yes, I noticed, it’s probably the most low-tech thing you’ve ever owned. And you were—oh my god you were so destroyed over what happened with Steve. But you were destroyed over our break too, I could see it. And I couldn’t let you go either. Not despite of everything you are, but
“Morguna! You hid in the garage?”
It’s Tony’s arc reactor, the one that houses the nanoparticles for Mark L. Tony splutters. “You kept it?”
But Steve just says, “Would’ve been far worse without it.” And yes, that was always his stance, wasn’t it?
Pepper gives Tony a swat on the shoulder and Morgan says, very seriously, “Got it.” She puts a fist under her chin pensively. “Why is it embarrassing?”

“Not sure. It seems to have all gone pretty wrong even
She laughs, shaking her head a little. “I know you love me, Tony, but I also know that it’s never trumped everything else. You’re Iron Man.
“Maybe,” Tony concedes. “Now, please, Morgan’s dying to meet you.” He waves his hand towards the door that leads to the porch.
“Yeah.”
“That’s just it, Tony. I
“That’s because you have no taste,” Tony snipes. “Oh my god, why is it still here? Throw it in the lake! Morguna!” He claps his hands.
Steve smirks. “What would Earth have done without you?”
Rhodey says, “I can’t believe I witnessed you two’s first kiss and now I’m holding your
It’s wild how a baby can seem more luminous to his eyes than an arc reactor.
“Why don’t you tell me what it’s about?”
There was that time he was trying to tell Steve that he and Pepper were on a break, and Steve thought that they were, they were
“Tony.” Pepper ruffles his hair. “Are you ever going to give that to him?”
He gives her a pained look. “You should know I’ve made many enhancements to it but I’ve taken great care to preserve its
to me, Steve.” He rises from the sofa, takes the few steps towards Steve in the corner of the room. “Hey Pep!” he shouts, and he’s close enough to see Steve jump. “Dinner’s ready! And there’s a Captain America in our living room!”
He sits up straight. “What do you think it’s about?”
child, and Tony can’t fuck this up, he really really can’t.
“I’ve already made more of those things.”
“No, and I don’t
Tony is quiet, and Steve adds, “We’re going to be okay. I promise. I won’t let anything change what we have.”
“Tony,” Steve says, in that infuriatingly measured voice that he has. Tony went two years without hearing it and he doesn’t know why he missed it. “We found Thanos. He’s destroyed the stones. Thor killed him. We’re not sure how to move forward from here, but we’ll figure it out.”
Pepper stands up and smiles at Steve. Morgan passes from her hands to his.
And Tony thinks about the Winter Soldier with his vibranium arm and the wreckage of his parents’ car, and Siberia again, Siberia. Steve choosing his parents’ killer over him. But he shouldn’t worry about that. If they try this, they probably won’t succeed and they probably won’t live. Bucky Barnes shouldn’t be a concern at all.
And all too soon everyone’s leaving. He waves goodbye to Steve and Natasha who are getting in their car, and as they speed off, vanishing down the path through the trees, Tony’s already trying to think of excuses to get Steve to come visit again. He can’t bear the thought of having to wait a year, or even a month, or even—
A terrible sadness ripples across Steve’s face, quickly suppressed. He turns and nods at Pepper, who’s sitting by the bed, and he leaves.
Steve nods. “The simple life.”
“What, Cap, you got no platitudes for me?” Tony smiles; it’s a brittle effort.
Tony’s heart disappears to another dimension for a bit. He goes to get Steve, and they have an insane discussion about time travel, and Tony doesn’t want this, he doesn’t. He has everything he wants right here.
“That’s not a no.” Tony’s heart is pounding in his ears. “Steve… We’re already friends again. You held my daughter last week. You didn’t come all the way here just to ask me for friendship. You’re telling me you want this life, with me.”
Steve opens the trunk and sifts through towels and stuffed animals with a puzzled expression on his face, until he finds the shield buried underneath all that. The Captain America shield, with the iconic star-spangled look that you just can’t beat. “Tony,” Steve says, in a strangled voice. “How long’s this been in here?”
“Fighting?” Tony raises an eyebrow. “I think that’s the complicated life you’re looking for, Cap.”
He clears his throat. “Well, this was fun, glad we did this. But I gotta go. Come visit us some time, will you? The baby’s gonna be here soon.”
“And you’re okay with this?”
Steve his goddamn—
“Coming here last week… Well, when we saw Barton’s home all those years ago, it didn’t call to me. Not the way it called to you, and made you want all this.” Steve looks around as he did last week and takes in the room, the fireplace, the bookshelves, the candles. “That life, it held no enticement for me, or so I thought at the time. But I’ve come to recognise that it doesn’t really matter to me whether it’s the simple life or the complicated life, as long as I’m fighting alongside people I care about.”
Natasha appears on the porch in a dark red dress, her movements uncharacteristically hesitant. “She’s beautiful,” she murmurs. “Can I hold her?”
“Me? Now?” Steve rubs a hand over his eyes. “I don’t know, Tony. I thought I had a home, with the Avengers. But it turns out that home’s always going to be a fragile concept. And part of that is—my fault.” His gaze slides briefly down to meet Tony’s before skittering away again. “I still believe in what I believe in; that hasn’t changed. But I just wish I’d given more care to harmony. And now most of the people I’ve held dear are gone. I don’t know how I could ever get home from here. I don’t know what I want anymore.”
Steve is stacking up chairs, because of course he told everyone there was no need to put away the chairs; he would take care of all that. “I don’t think of it like that. It helps me. To do what I can to help others. I have to keep looking for ways to do my part.” He glances at Tony. “You didn’t seem like you needed any support.”
“Tony,” Steve says, with profound surprise.
to me when we still had the chance.” He’s seething again and has to actively calm himself down.
When he wakes up, there’s Steve again.
“That’s fine, but why were you just carrying it around with you?”
“Yeah, I know, she’s everything to me,” Tony says, feeling the sincerity of every word he’s saying just as he can feel his own frantic heartbeat in his ribcage right now. “But so are you. It’s funny how those two statements can both be true. Do you believe me?”
There’s just so much of it. Space. Space space space space space. The seeming endlessness of it is making everything else lose meaning. This cold uncaring darkness where even the lights of so many stars do not warm him in the slightest. What’s his life in the face of all this? Another time he might have said dust, but now he only
“It wasn’t worth it,” Steve agrees, softly, and Tony’s heart billows. “If we’d stayed together as a team, we could’ve…”
“Yeah. I’m just making dinner.” He stands back to allow Steve to come through the door. In the living room, Steve takes the chair in the corner, so Tony can sprawl over the sofa. “So what’s on your mind?”
But Steve is holding his baby, and Tony’s not in space or Siberia, he’s here in his house by the lake, and he trusts Steve, he does, with all his heart.
“Wow man. I’m honoured. I’d love to be her oddfather.” Rhodey looks down at Morgan in her sweet blue onesie, her darling pink face, and she slowly blinks up at him. “I’m gonna be honest, I already love her more than I love you guys.”
“The world hasn’t ended,” Pepper murmurs, her eyes earnest and bright, her voice the softest thing he’s known in weeks, so soft he could lie his head upon it and sleep like a baby for a whole month. “Not for us. We don’t have to resort to Kraft Singles yet.”
He goes to Steve’s room, where Steve is watching a film on his tablet. This room has belonged to Steve since their first kiss—or in Tony’s mind, since he first had this house built. Steve always sleeps in this room, and Pepper always sleeps in the master bedroom. When Steve’s here, Tony usually sleeps in this room with him, and it’s become as full of memories as any other room in this house. Tony takes a moment to appreciate the warmth he feels just looking at Steve sitting up on the bed in this cosy room which in the beginning had lain cold and empty and impersonal, a guest bedroom never used, inhabited only by Tony’s longing and hope. Now the walls are covered in sketches, the strokes of Steve’s pencil confident and sure, and there’s the odd collaboration with Morgan too, in bright, messy crayon.
Steve and the baby have been cooing back and forth to each other, which is just
When he rips the arc reactor off his chest and grabs Steve’s hand to put it there, he isn’t even really thinking about it. He feels like an empty suit of armor being piloted remotely by a Tony Stark who’s somewhere far away.
“Aw, that’s sweet.” Tony puts his hands on Rhodey’s shoulders. “I hereby appoint you Morgan’s oddfather.”
No, he’s still intact, still skin and muscle and bone, still holding on.
Tony knows how close he came to death five years ago. He knows how close he might come to death again. But he doesn’t give voice to that fear. He just asks, with all the tenderness that he feels, “Come to bed with me and Pepper tonight? I don’t want to be without either of you.”
, and everything in him judders into motion, and he won’t rest, not until he—
“Of course,” Pepper says, and Rhodey carefully hands over Morgan to Natasha. Natasha seems to slip immediately into a different world as she cradles Morgan, a world where she is gentle and nobody expects her to be otherwise. Tony thinks about how great she was with Barton’s children, and how they’re all gone now, Barton himself missing too. Natasha has so few people left in the world.
Tony turns back. The room’s cleared now, just a stretch of empty floor between him and Steve. Tony is tired of keeping that something at bay, trying to stop it from ever piercing his heart. Or maybe it did a long time ago and he’s just been living with it this whole time, and he’ll live with it forever.
A picnic by the lake. Life can really be just this simple. A blanket with a spread of food laid out, bread and cheese—not Kraft Singles but real cheese—and ham and strawberries—because even though Pepper’s allergic, Morgan loves them. But Morgan’s off playing hide and seek with Steve, and it’s just him and Pepper here, lying on the grass.
Hang on, that’s not Steve, that’s a—
But he’s back on Earth, the planet he wanted to put a suit of armour around, the planet his weapons once devastated. The planet he was prepared to give his life to protect.

“Tony,” Steve says, sharply, the word raw like a wound. “Don’t say that.”
powered them all the way here in such a breathtakingly short amount of time. He really thought he was going to die in space, drifting in an indifferent vacuum.
, he remembers saying, but that memory’s a blur. He’d been near death, feral with fear, having come face to face with all his nightmares at once and left savaged but alive to deal with the aftermath, to think on the loss, and in that bleak wilderness of pain and guilt, that black void of space punctured by cold and distant lights, he was

And he hopes she never has to know otherwise.
“You know what dream.”
People are drifting in. It’s a pretty big group, although Tony has nothing by which to gauge whether its size is unusual for a support group, having never been to one of any kind.
Tony coughs, looking out at the lake and pretending he didn’t hear that, and Pepper’s whispering something in Morgan’s ear that makes her snort with laughter, and Steve’s still got his hand around Tony’s ankle for no reason at all. The sun glitters on the lake, and Tony tries his best not to ask himself how he can make this last forever.
, holding him up.
Tony thinks,
“Yes, it is,” Tony replies, while Pepper is laughing with her hands over her face, no doubt reliving the memory of their first kiss. “And we’d like you to be Morgan’s oddfather. We hear that’s what people are calling non-religious godparents. Oddparents.”
a reality, that’d be something.
“Tony,” Steve says, heavily.
Drawings of the forest, the lake. Portraits of Pepper—and of Tony.

figured out time travel. He sits down on the bed next to Steve, and he puts his head on Steve’s shoulder. “You’ll get Barnes back,” he says.
? Please. I bet you were brooding over it all the time when I wasn’t looking.”
Alone with Steve again, Tony gives him another kiss, bringing one leg up and bending it to slot alongside Steve’s thigh so that he’s half-kneeling on the chair, but something in Steve’s pocket digs into him. “What on earth have you got in there?” he asks, patting Steve’s pocket.
“Oddmother,” Tony corrects him.
And then it’s done.
Not for long, though. He draws in another shallow breath, thinks about Pepper’s hair between his fingers. He’ll dream of her again, he told her so. It’s always her. Always.
Steve’s jaw drops just like Pepper’s did. “You figured it out? Tony, you’re amazing.” He reaches out with both his hands and Tony steps forward to hold them. “I… You know, this is horrible to admit, but maybe there was a part of me that was hoping you wouldn’t.”
Tony doesn’t feel like he’s been passed out long enough for them to have found Thanos already, but who knows. The news doesn’t evoke any emotion in him. He doesn’t really give a damn anymore. “
. I got it. But it would be more symbolic if you kept it.” Tony slowly nudges each of Steve’s fingers to close them over the arc reactor again. “It’s yours. It’s always been yours.”
like. “We could even just get like some Kraft Singles and bread and just sit on a bench somewhere and eat those, how ’bout that. Just anywhere that’s not the Avengers fucking Compound.”
“If that’s the case, why are you still playing with it every night? I don’t think that shield is only about what Steve needs.”
want me. That if Pepper were out of the picture you’d be kissing me right now.”
“Yes,” Steve replies smoothly. “The shield does look a lot like it.”
. Incredible how that word’s definition has just now expanded to encompass something so huge, an entire planet and not just a house, a person; he could be anywhere on Earth right now and he’d still be home. Nebula wraps an arm around him and helps him up and she’s a blue alien who has no connection to Earth whatsoever, but they’re here, together. She a visitor to an unfamiliar planet and he a supposed
His blues eyes were glazed over and Steve looked distant. He certainly wasn't going to be with it for the interview but then he supposed that was the point.
"Rhodey!!" shrieked Tony with delight, lunging at his best friend.  "I haven't seen you in--"
"Jesus. I'm gonna kill that man," Aria sighed as Tony left the kitchen, rubbing her temples. "I didn't hear all that. Just the end of it. Sorry. I didn't realise you'd gotten here." It was hard to know if it really was an 'accident' with Aria. She liked being in control of things; it wouldn't be unusual for her to eavesdrop. "I was Googling it though," she continued before Pepper could be annoyed about being overheard. "And apparently post-heat Alphas can go a little coo-coo. Not that that's an excuse but, you know.  Hopefully he won’t pull any more shit like that.”
"For practice."
The doctor was sitting by his bed, one hand on his forearm.  Her face was soft but tired.  Steve was reminded of his mother.
"Oh? No, not at all. We're just here to piss off Gideon Malick," Steve said. "He sent us the tickets as a joke." DeSoto couldn't help but listen and was clearly interested in what he was hearing. "He bought us a very nice suite. Must have cost him a fortune. Did you know he bought his omega because he
"What?!  What?!" asked Tony in alarm.
shouldn't be having with him. Tony-"
Tony listened to Steve talk, still hurting, and felt his eyes tear up.  He blinked rapidly.  He would not let them fall.
Happy didn't say anything as they got into the car but he offered a warm smile, some cheery radio station on in the background. The atmosphere was almost awkward; if Donner was aware of that he didn't show it.  He stared out of the tinted windows of the SUV with a blank expression.  Rhodey was just relieved to be out of the hotel suite.
Steve's brows rose at the last one. Aria just snorted when she saw it and patted his arm. "Kinda lame that's the worst they could come up with," she said and he just hummed in agreement.
"...you er, okay there, boss?"
is the latest suit.  I'm trying to get it to so that the suits are all self-aggregating.  I'm tired of having robot hands molest me.  ...sorry, 7UMM-E," he added over his shoulder.  One of the bots whirred at him in recognition of its name.  "Oh, and I was going through some of Dad's old stuff.  Wanna see something really cool?"
"Oh shit," said Tony out loud, his mouth watering.
"...Dad loved Jarvis and Ana," said Tony defensively.
Within a few seconds, Bucky's grip on Fury had loosened and his body had begun to go limp.
.  Do you think he's safe?  I can totally imagine that asshole kicking him around and pretending it's you."  He winced a little as a drop of mustard from his sandwich fell on the fleece squirrel costume; he wiped it off with his finger and then licked his finger.  "And DeSoto... creepy, right? ...I guess I would behave, too, if someone threatened to shoot me." Tony paused and cocked his head thoughtfully.  "...or I would build, y'know, a deadly mechanized suit out of rocket parts. But I understand that option is not available to everyone."
Even though it was a completely inappropriate thought, Tony couldn't help just admire Steve's body.  The beads of water on his broad shoulders glistened and the muscles rippled under the surface of his skin like a tiger's.  Holy hell, Steve was gorgeous. Like an Adonis, a carved marble statue. And here in the pool, in only his boxers... Tony was reminded, again, uncomfortably, of the omegas that worked at the country club in his childhood, who wore only shorts or sarongs and collars, who were always tan and smiling and attractive.
He laid down over him, kissing the salt off his cheeks, wriggling his hips, thrusting into Steve with grunts of effort, Steve's body clenching and drawing him in with every rhythmic push.
Captain America
Tony gestured for Steve to come to him.  "Steve," he said softly.  "C'mere.  Let me hold you.  You're so good, you're such a good omega... you're a good
"I'm not interested in SHIELD. I'm not talking about SHIELD. We both know who you're
Steve had been in jeans way too long and practically sighed in relief when he stripped them off. He toed off his shoes and fell into bed, still in boxers, tee and socks. He'd missed their bed. It still smelt of them.
Steve obediently led Tony across the base, pulling his SHIELD ID from his wallet as they approached the lab.  Recognizable or not, getting into the lab required several security checkpoints, and Steve had to reassure more than one sergeant that Tony was being escorted by him personally and would not be let out of his sight.
Tony wasn't sure how to respond to Steve's talk about the tesseract being "toxic."  It was just an object.  Objects couldn't be cursed, or evil, not in Tony's mind.  But he didn't dare disagree with Steve while Steve was curled into him, shaking and vulnerable.
"Mescaline?  LSD?  C'mon... give me a hint."  Tony's eyes were already heavy.  They slid over to a monitor; the screen was currently blank.  He glanced back over to the window.  On his side, it was mirror.  He stared at himself.  Consciousness was starting to bleed a little bit around the corners.    Tony struggled to focus on things that were good, safe, comforting.  He didn't think about
"We can leave them in the bathroom for now," Steve said. He could smell it too. The smoke didn't bother him but the tangy stench of blood would never be something he got used to.
The only way Steve wasn't going to punch a hole in the wall was if he got this poor kid out of the ward and away from Melinda.

"I care about
It felt good, though. When Tony said he respected him... Steve was almost surprised by how good it felt to just hear it. He didn't think he'd heard it from anyone but Phil since waking up, and Phil was obsessed with the legacy. Not really him. "And it's Friday," Steve added with a slight frown on his features. "Are you gonna be alright without a PA?" His tone was teasing but the concern was genuine.
"Oh my God, oh my God!" Banksy continued to shriek.  Even Donner was smiling shyly; Banksy's enthusiasm was infectious.  "Oh my God I can't even believe it... I'm going to be the third omega ever to host my own show... are-- are they leaving us in the prime time slot?"
But Steve?
"Tony's not going to hurt me Bucky," Steve said plainly. He looked tired as he sat down, his heart in his throat. His jaw trembled. "I'm
Steve sat up and thought about it for a moment, looking between a pouting Tony and an expectant Pepper. "I mean, the revolving place sounds pretty cool," he said.
"There's been a lot of studies proving otherwise," Eric whispered from Piper's left. Studies, Steve thought,
"Do you have many troubles at work because of status, Captain?"
"Oh my gosh, you're right!  I remember now!" exclaimed Abby.
When the story broke, Tony hadn't raged.  There had been no yelling or swearing. Simply Tony's perfect look of blank neutrality, the one that went up when he wasn't sure what to do immediately.  When emotions hit Tony hard,
He sat up, rubbing his chest.  They were in another hotel; Wanda was noisily crunching ice from a bucket and lying on her stomach, flipping through the television channels.
DeSoto was shrinking a little, staring at the floor.  He shrugged.
The girl behind him gripped his arm, her wide, pale eyes getting even wider.
"Yeah...yeah. I'll catch you later, okay? Thank you for calling, honestly. And tell Nat thanks, too. It means a lot. I'm sorry I've kind of been a dick recently," Steve sighed. "It's been...a confusing few weeks," he murmured and then hung up, finishing the conversation. Steve set his phone down on the side and saw Tony slip away into his bathroom.
Stark was lying with his back against a crate, head in his hands.  Or at least, the suit was. Inside it was Stark, and this was a problem, because they couldn't kill him while he was locked in the armor.
"Wanda, p-please, he's-- he doesn't smell right, there's something wrong with him--"
Pepper scoffed.  "JARVIS, tell James that Tony's back."
Clint moved back to Steve's side, wiping at his neck gently.  It was bleeding intermittently. Natasha and Sam were looking away with some degree of modesty.  The back of an omega's neck was something of a private matter.
Steve found it hard to follow Tony's obvious need for improvement. He saw the suit as a powerful force to be reckoned with, something effective and strong. Tony had saved his life in it- flown god knows how far and had beaten Vanko into submission. Steve couldn't see the weaknesses and the faults like Tony did. Although, he did see the appeal of having it self-assemble. It was clunky and slow sometimes, Steve guessed, but that never stopped it being powerful.
He hit the thrusters in the boots and shot himself left, realized he was going west, not east, over the Pacific, and cut the thrusters.  The suit dropped, tumbled through the air for a moment, a dead weight; Tony hit the retro-thrust and aimed east.
kill someone by accident.  Aria had previously told him he had a bit of an anger problem and couldn't punch all of his problems away.  She was probably right, though Steve would never admit it.
"That's right, you better run!" yelled Pitbull as Tony made toward the house, still dripping.
"Oh my God, you called me to
"...happiness?" ventured Wanda.
Steve sighed quietly as Tony's hands dipped down his back, and then lower. He reminded himself that he was supposed to be mad at Tony but as soon as the man's hands dipped down to his ass and beyond Steve couldn't really find himself to be mad at Tony right now. "Tony..." Steve sighed, tilting his head back onto Tony's shoulder.  "You know," he said, not managing to sound annoyed at all. "You really shouldn't be taking coke."
Bucky shook his head.  "...no," he admitted quietly.  He didn't like delicious Greek yogurt.  He looked over at her. "...this is why it's better to take orders instead of making decisions.  Sometimes you make the wrong choice."
Tony looked incensed.  Mackenzie stifled a laugh.
Or maybe they'd finally cough up about New Mexico. Whatever
Tony nipped Steve's lip at the sound of his name, but the words that followed were anything but sexy.
Tony's vision swam.  "W... what? No... no, I didn't feel..."  He took a step back, then dropped to his knees.  It was impossible. No one could kill Steve; he was a super-soldier and, besides, wouldn't Tony have sensed it?  Wouldn't he have known?
..." Steve's eyes rolled back and slipped shut and he squeezed Tony's shoulders lightly as he sank down again. It was such a perfect feeling. He wanted to stay like this forever.
Tony's goatee twitched with a smile.
"Naw.  They're a bunch of beach bums.  No one will care.  ...did you have a nice vacation, солдат?"  He laughed a little.  "...oh, my God, you smell that?  They gave him weed.  He's baked out of his mind."
The desire to fight gave way to shame and embarrassment again.  Tony huffed and rolled over, turning his back on Steve, facing the back of the couch.  It wasn't that he was rejecting Steve to hurt him.  It was just that he felt so entirely powerless.  He
"Karpov," said Tony into the coffee can, eyes narrowing.  "I know him. I mean, not personally. But I... I know the name."
"I mean, if the guy doesn't want kids..."
to--"
"You aren't taking my patient anywhere," Melinda snapped. "I don't know what you think you're doing--"
"You sure can sing, Captain," she told him and sipped at the straw of her drink, her lips the same red as dress.
"Excuse me, gentlemen, can I get you a table?" A waiter appeared before them, menus at the ready. Tony said something and they were being lead to an intimate table for the two of them. The menu looked nice but Steve knew he was already getting lasagna. And garlic bread.  And more lasagna. "This is nice," Steve murmured and nudged a foot against Tony's under the table. "Really. This is... perfect, actually."
.  He couldn't deal with that.  Why the fuck would HYDRA want to kidnap Steve?  How could Fury (who Tony suspected was a robot in the first place) be nearly dead?  And how could Steve miscarry if he'd had a vasectomy back in '89?  Okay, fine, it was a few thousand pesos in a very shady Tijuana clinic but...
With that, he wrenched open the door of the car and dove inside, yanking Steve after him.  The media went insane, shouting questions at them, swarming the car.  Natasha turned in her seat to glare at him; Tony stared back, straight-faced.
He looked down at the Alpha at his feet.  Broken leg, not a threat. Tony didn't have the where-with-all to appreciate the irony.  He would have gladly broken the guy's other leg if he thought he was a competitor.
He was really quite a violent person when he thought about it.
He turned around in a circle once. The darkness was pressing and consuming, suffocating even. Steve was beginning to feel dizzy. Was he still spinning or was he standing still?
He licked at Steve's collarbone, then dipped a little lower to run his tongue over one of Steve's nipples, his fingers tracing the outline of Steve's stomach.
Tony reached up to rub the back of his neck.  He threw his half-smoked cigar after Jasper's cigarette and went back into the party.  Time to drown his sorrows and re-establish his ownership of Steve, who was wailing away on stage with gusto.
Intimacy was something Tony abhorred, generally.  But with Steve things were... different.  Tony began working his length, slowly, sensuously; Steve was already melting into him.
Pietro smiled.  "Good decision."
She'd stopped just outside of his apartment-- which was his, his own space, even though it had been paid for by SHIELD.  In the heart of Westwood, a small, posh neighborhood in Los Angeles, it was the same apartment he'd used to be undercover in Stark Industries. But it was still the closest he'd come to having his own home in this century.
"We can probably get you back to Malibu by sunrise," said Happy.  "Just take it easy, okay?"
A zero for a Captain.  Ha-ha.  Boy, were the forties wild.
"Well, I'm not coming with you!" Steve snapped, sounding determined. "You could be anyone. And I can't even goddamn see. I'm not coming with you."
"Your vital signs are stable, sir."
He tried pushing, gritting his teeth. With a creak the floorboard above him thumped away, landing heavily on its side. Steve pulled himself up and squinted at the bright lights. It looked like he was in a laboratory, or a hospital, maybe.  There was no one around. He didn't know where he was but it didn't matter.  Only one thing did.
Steve shrugged Tony off of him and rolled over, shrugging off his gown.  Tony lay back down on him, front to back. Steve's neck looked well-healed.  If Tony forced himself to look at it objectively, like it was just some omega and not
"You're not gonna cure him over night," Aria added from her place on the couch, a laptop in her lap. She'd been typing away all evening.
She squealed with excitement and helped pull his shirt off, whistling and shaking her head at his torso.  "I can't believe you're a 'mega," she said.
Tony shivered with delight at the noises Steve was making, squirming against him and burying himself as deeply as he could.  He felt his balls brush against Steve's skin.  "That's it... good Steve... you're doing so good..." purred Tony.  He was reluctant to pull away from Steve, enjoying as much skin-on-skin contact as possible, but he needed more; he put his hands on Steve's hips and sat back, tugging Steve's hips up with him, giving him a couple of quick, sharp thrusts, looking down at him lovingly.  He didn't want to get too carried away and hurt him, but it was hard to hold back.  Looking down at Steve, though, there was no question as to his pleasure; Steve was writhing under him like he was in heat all over again, his erection standing at attention across his stomach.  His skin was glistening with sweat, gleaming in the glow of Tony's arc reactor, and his blond hair was matted against his forehead.  Tony moaned, arching, reaching down to brush Steve's damp hair away from his face.  "You're beautiful, Steve, you have no idea... I can't believe I'm mating you... you feel so good..."
"We need cocktails," Tracy said, watching them try to stop the bleeding with limited success.
The soldier shifted a little, getting some of his weight off of the omega but still pinning his wrists down.
They fell silent as the sound of the jets drowned out their conversation; a moment later there was a loud, metallic clang as the suit landed on the concrete outside the hangar.  Iron Man strode confidently into the open hangar, pausing behind the collected group.
Something chilled him to bone. Traces of Bucky still remained on him even after all this time. It was almost sinister. Steve had no idea- he'd felt free all this time. He'd felt alone, but had he really been? He swallowed.
. And Steve was happy with that. And he felt very happy now.
"Scram."
"I'm not fine, I'm freaking out!" exclaimed Tony.  "I... I don't feel good, I want to throw up, I keep smelling sex, I don't remember my birthday--"
"A cousin four times removed," said Pepper, smiling at the baby.
By the time they were to bed on Monday, with the anniversary and the flight to New York the next day, both of them were looking a bit worse for the wear.  Tony's lack of sleep was starting to mess with Steve's. Sure enough, that night, Tony woke up at 4:30 in the morning drenched in a cold sweat, yelling.
Doctor Kate McCloud really hadn't been having a good day. Being an ER doctor was stressful enough as it was. It didn't help that her ex was trying to get full custody in their divorce settlement, that his new girlfriend was now pregnant and that that morning, Kate's boiler had broken down and she'd had to take a cold shower. That night she'd already amputated a man's mangled leg from a car crash and had a 80-year-old die on her after a second heart attack. So, Kate wasn't in a particularly good mood as it was. She was obviously too busy to have been paying attention to the news and hadn't really been keeping up with the whole Captain America drama anyway. She was an omega who'd married another omega- she'd done the whole "defying stereotypes" shit in her twenties. Now, she was focused on saving lives.
?  I'm one of the editors!  And publishers! Those photo shoots he did, they were fantastic!  That one of him reading the magazine about him liking sex? HA! That was great!  Fantastic! Here's my card!" shouted John, handing Tony a card.
"Apologies don't count if you're forced to make them. They have to come from the heart," Steve said, recalling something his mother had once said. His hands eased by his sides. "And you have to be sorry to make them sincere."
"They're not my family," said Steve.  "But yes, we're trying to find some other missing omegas that were mentioned at the conference. The whole thing was... very disturbing. Have you ever been to one?"
to be."
"We could grab something to eat on the way over. You said we have to arrive a bit later than everyone else, right?" Steve said, clearly not wanting to leave Tony behind.
"It's pretty weird," admitted Eric.  "...doesn't that rub your hackles the wrong way?  Me, I don't care. I sell collars so it's good business for me.  I
He shifted his weight in Steve's lap and leaned up to kiss his throat before dropped back down and closing his eyes again.  The day wasn't yet over but he felt exhausted from it- exhausted from sobbing and from all the emotions.
"Not one toe out of line, Captain!" called Malick.
Sam smirked a little at Steve.  The casualness with which Tony periodically explained things was charming in its own way, an indication of a relationship that was operating smoothly.
"I'm fine. Don't worry about me," Steve brushed her off, though he did pull at his collar. He felt a little hot. Maybe it was the whole situation; it had him flustered. He ran a hand over his face and downed another glass of water as a waiter passed them by. It didn't help him feel any less overheated though.
," said Jorge.
"How are you Nick?"
"Override!"
fight you if I have to."
"HOLD ON!" barked a familiar voice.  Tony barreled in, dragging the woman in the pink dress behind him, giggling.  "Are you guys mixing drinks without me? Oh, hell no, no no, move aside, move aside, let me show you a thing or two-- oh, hi, Steve!  This is Ji-Yoo, an ex of mine."
Tony disagreed; he felt deeply, deeply responsible and guilty.  But he didn't argue because he was feeling so cold and sick to his stomach that he was worried he'd vomit if he opened his mouth.  So instead he nodded and tried to look like he actually believed what Nadine was saying.
Tony was kind of scary like this. Sure, he'd talked about killing during their heat but that had been a heat. This was real. And Steve was shaking. He needed to get Bucky out of the general public and away, somewhere where he couldn't hurt anyone, or be hurt. Steve needed to know he was okay.
The yoga class was taking place at a local gym. Aria had been a few times before, she told Steve. Apparently the woman who ran the class was a middle-aged beta. Aria didn't seem to think she would be weird about having Captain America in her class. Hopefully no one would say anything.  Steve just really wanted to be left alone today. He didn't want attention from fans or the media.  Tony's guilt was unsettling and he wasn't up to having his picture taken at the moment.
but it no longer burned in the same way it had before. He reached up tentatively to feel the skin around the bandage; it was no longer hot like it had been before.
"Open bar," said Tony, pointing to the map printed in the program.
"Like the reindeer?"
Tony didn't need telling twice.  He let Happy escort him to the car and crawled into the backseat to lie down.  He'd long since lost his sunglasses; he looked over at Steve's slightly blurry figure.  "...hey. Congrats, Cap."
Tony reached out and took both of Steve's hands in his.  "Steve. Look at me for a sec." Tony had to duck his head a little to catch Steve's eye; Steve was looking down.  "It's not your fault this happened. And even if it was, it doesn't matter to me now. Whatever happens, I already made my decision.  You don't get to consciously chose which mark your body accepts, and I know I'm not very dominant and... and he is. And that's okay. Because me and you chose each other,
to my head!  What was I supposed to do?"
Trembling and sweating slightly, Tony took Steve's hand and let him haul him to his feet.  After all this time, he was still in awe at how remarkably strong Steve was, at how easily to pulled Tony up, like a parent swinging a child.
DeSoto pressed harder into Tony.  Tony shot Steve a warning look. but reached out with a hand to place on Steve's leg.  Steve's muscles flexed under his skin, like he was ready to get up and start punching something.  Tony hoped his touch was grounding; ending human trafficking wasn't something you could punch away, unfortunately.
He settled down into their bed, using Steve's pillow instead of his own.  He'd taken three benadryl and two clonazepams and sleep was coming on hard, but his thoughts were still turning.
A picture of Steve with his shirt undone, looking serious.
a voice was saying.
"Upstairs.  Shower."
Tony held up his own collar to Steve.  "You want to do the honors? ...my hackles feel a lot better.  I think as long as we don't leave it on more than twelve hours I can handle it.  ...anything you want me to do while you're off in omegaland?"
“...what do we do?” she asked softly.
"TONY!" barked Happy back.
"Tell her, Captain America!  Lying's bad and she lied!"
Steve stared at the tubes and syringes in disgust and then he looked up and glared at the man in the suit. He was standing, but only just, his ankle off. He was obviously leaning on his good leg. He wasn't really in a position to fight Bucky. But he was also scared of getting Bucky in trouble.
"Greeting, intruders," said JARVIS cheerily.
Nonetheless, he was attentive, listening raptly to every word that Steve spoke.
It was the first time he had ever called her by her name.  For some reason, Bucky's programming had made it difficult for him to identify people as individuals.  Aside from Karpov, Bucky tended to refer to people by their traits. "The girl," "the omega," "the blond," "the tall one," "the man with the blue eyes..."  Bucky rarely referred to anyone by name. Lately, he'd been calling Pietro and Steve by theirs, but Wanda had always just been "the girl."
Tony looked up at Steve; the room wobbled and swayed, and Tony was aware that he was very, very drunk.  He accepted the glass from Steve and drank deeply, then handed it back, grinning broadly.  "Gross. What was that, water?  I thought it was vodka," he joked.  "Okay, take me back downstairs... I feel fine, Rogers, come on. I'm missing my own party..."  He put his arms out.  "Come on, carry me!  ...Stan, I'm serious, I feel fine now.  I wanna keep partying; it's my birthday.  My fortieth one, Stan, that's a big one."  He rubbed his chest, breathing out deeply.  It was still burning but the alcohol helped.  Tony could feel the music pulsing up from the floor below them.  "You said yourself, Stan, it's better to regret doing something than not, right?"
Maria managed to convince Tony to come to the kitchen, but she couldn't get him settled.  He paced around aggressively, hackles up, hands flexing at his sides.
"...I didn't show anyone," she added.  She knew, well enough, that Steve was self-conscious about how he'd looked before the serum.  There existed, to Pepper's knowledge, only three photos of Steve pre-serum, all of them on display in a museum and printed in history books.  This photo of him and Sergeant Barnes was invaluable... but also private. The photos of Steve, pre-serum, were all individual shots. In this one, it was immediately and obviously clear that he was an omega and that the man he was with was either a mate or a courting Alpha.
“In a week or less,” confirmed Dr. Gleason.
Banksy was the kind of omega Steve could have been pre-serum if he'd grown up in this century. He was small and cute, but full of energy. He got his Alpha to wear a hat (which frankly looked adorable in Steve's opinion.) He held presence in a room. Steve almost felt mournful as he let Banksy pull him away with a half awkward chuckle. But he also felt happy. Happy that an omega could be like this... his own person, without having to be six foot and have biceps the size of someone's head. Steve wasn't necessary anymore. And that thought was oddly freeing.Steve and Tony were being dragged apart by Boswell and Banksy; they shared identical dopey, excited grins.  The energy in the air was palpable, and contagious.
Aria frowned a little and hooked her arm through Steve's.  "...Status Alliance isn't one of Tony's biggest fans," she said, unnecessarily.  "If it weren't for Ty and Banksy, I think they'd be out for blood... listen. Steve.  You and Tony might want to consider doing something a piece for a more... Alpha-oriented 'zine.  Nothing like
"Mockingbird is not an omega!" he said triumphantly.
"Hi there, Captain Rogers," said the psychiatrist with a smile.  She was an Alpha, though not a particularly dominant one. She had long, straight, dark hair and a few freckles on her nose that Tony no doubt would have been drooling over if he was awake.  "I'm Doctor Brennan from the National Institute of Mental Health. I'm going to be accessing you over the next week, if that's alright. How are you feeling?"
"Cut!" yelled Pepper.  "Tony, so help me God, I will tape your penis to your leg."
"Great!  This is great!  ...and now I gotta join the team, right?  Obviously.  Since we're, you know, the greatest pair-bond ever... we'll show you how it's done, according to this article... Hey, look, look, Steve; look at this one!"  A picture of Steve and Tony stepping out of the car when they first entered the Expo, Tony waving, Steve ducking shyly behind him.  "
Every bone in Steve's body wanted to tear downstairs and scream in Mike's face, or go up to DeSoto's Alpha and clock him in the jaw. These Alphas had no love for their partners, not if they resigned them to this kind of fate. Steve felt like he was going to be sick, maybe, and DeSoto being all sweet and submissive for Tony beside him was not helping.
Steve frowned again, looking so genuinely sad it almost hurt to look at. He didn't like those. Why were they making him take those? "But my whelps," he said.
There was another Alpha.
--" Steve panted, his breath hot against the other's left cheek. He could still feel the other's knot nudging against him and struggled to comprehend how he once used to take all of it. "Tony. Please, I need-"
Steve didn't know why he headed outside. It was automatic. He'd seen Bucky out here in the front yard once. His therapist put his hallucinations down to PTSD, but even Steve couldn't deny what Banksy had said. The bond was strong, whether anyone liked it or not. Steve had a connection with Bucky that was unheard of for most bondmates.
!" someone yelled out from the crowd. Steve didn't correct them otherwise.
Tony's face split into a grin.  "...yeah.  I do," he said softly.  He gently moved Steve off him and stood.
"...tell him he's lucky we're not in bed already," said Tony.  "What's he want?" He tried not to sound resentment and failed completely.  Considering they were no longer employed by SHIELD, SHIELD still had an annoying degree of presence in their life.  Case in point: they were spending their anniversary freezing their asses off in England when they could've been fucking on a beach in the balmy Bahamas.
Steve was fuming, so angry he was visibly shaking. His blue eyes bright were fiery with his fury.
When they pulled up to the house, Tony walked wearily up to the door, waving his keycard to unlock it.
Natasha shook her head.  She was starting to think Stark wasn't exactly battle-tested.  Not by a long shot.
Tony spent most of the meeting just listening, soaking up all the information.  Everyone at the meeting was surprisingly normal and down-to-earth. No one was ogling at him, which he appreciated.
"JARVIS?  Can you look up any info on Bucky, too?" called Tony.  He hated the idea of learning about Steve's other mate, but he also believed in keeping his enemies close.
"I can always make time for Clint," Phil said. "But yes. Have a think, and I'll... have a think too.  Let's not do anything too rash."
A smudge of concealer and foundation on top got rid of the mark. They didn't worry about dressing him up; they simply took photos of him as he was, in the clothes he'd arrived in, some more close up ones of his face and others of his full body. They did playful, warm poses. Nothing too dominating or serious; Steve didn't want to still look like he was trapped in a forties mindset. They even took a few shots of him with the shirt undone- Steve knew that would just piss Fury off
"...and he fights for you, too," said Justin very, very softly, rising unsteadily to his feet, brushing himself off, wincing.
"S-so are you telling me that every time I have a heat, Bucky is going to wake up?"  Wake up disoriented, alone, and scared.
The back of Steve's neck didn't resemble his bonding mark, nor any bonding mark Tony had ever seen.  It was currently just a giant red swollen mess. Tony had already prepared himself for the worst and he couldn't say he blamed Steve at all for what had happened.  It almost seemed inevitable, with the way Tony was.
. Every fiber of his forties sensibilities was screaming inside.
!" said Tony.
"Knotting in heat? Whoever would have thought of such a thing?" Steve murmured conspiratorially, tucking the program into his back pocket.
.  He
Steve was sitting with his back against the bath tub.  He'd peed on the weird stick thing (and a little bit on his hand. Ew.) and was waiting impatiently for the thing to give him an answer. But it took ten whole minutes for a result to be displayed. His mind was racing at a hundred miles per hour with fifty different possibilities rushing through his head.
Tony's hackles relaxed marginally at the nickname.
to match my omega's?
"Yeah..." said Tony, clearly still distracted by the idea of Happy and Pepper leaving together.  "...yeah..."
"...Marcus?  This is going to be... tasteful, right?" he double-checked.
"...I told you you were uppity!" shouted Tony.  He felt angry and frustrated and confused.  He wanted it, but he didn't want it.  And he knew Steve wanted it, but now Steve was saying he didn't want it.
Steve shuddered a little as Tony's teeth continued to graze against the soft skin of his neck. He was surprised they'd honestly gone this long without doing yet already. It had been over twelve hours. "Okay. Bed," he hummed and took Tony's hand, letting his alpha tug them quite impatiently to the bedroom.
exist anywhere else, that he's the only one and here we are in Monaco watching--"
"Sorry.  I-- like I said, it would have been my fault, I should have questioned the orders and I didn't.  You're right.  I take full responsibility.  If anything had happened it would've been on me."
"Sir?" prompted JARVIS again.
Tony didn't want to talk to anyone and preferred to be along with his whiskey and his thoughts. He spent the night wondering what the hell he was supposed to do or say when Steve returned.  Steve had lost it over an old and well-known crush... and after all his fucking talk of monogamy, was Tony just supposed to be cool with the whole Bucky thing?
Tony pressed his face into Steve's back, breathing him in.
Pietro stared in surprise.  He'd certainly been called a spade before, but that didn't make it any more shocking.  "Fuck you, man!" he managed.
"But what about the serum?" Sam asked.
He dressed to go running and made toast for breakfast, half of it set by Tony's bedside and smothered in Nutella, before he went out. There was a few other joggers by the beach but that was it and they paid him no heed. The sun was up and the breeze was nice and cool. Steve relished it.
Poor Steve.
"Oh, don't worry, they're not even three months old yet.  They can't crawl or even roll over," said Jeff.
"Are they statused?" asked Tiberius suddenly.
nose worse!" growled Tony.
"Hi James.  It's me. Pietro," said Pietro, who found that Bucky's memory didn't always allow him to remember names well, especially when he'd only just woken up.
omegas.  The government wasn't stepping in and Steve felt they should . Someone or something had to help protect omegas. In situations like divorce they were already starting off on the wrong foot - biologically, they could not sever bonds themselves, and legally, they had less rights to property than their Alpha counterparts.  In the last year in the US alone Alpha's usually took
"...what is it?" asked Tony, nodding toward the bag without moving.  He felt wary but also tired. Too tired to really be angry or anything.  Not for the first time, he wished he had been in that car with his parents.  Tony had never told anyone, but he'd thought about it often. Tony loved himself for practical reasons: he was hot, smart, funny, rich, innovative... he was awesome.  But he also hated himself. Because ever since Afghanistan he'd had to come to terms with the fact that he was a mass murderer. And ever since bonding with Steve, he'd had to come to terms all over again with the fact that he was a weak Alpha.
Karpov was eyeing him, studying his face.  "...why did you lie to us?"
"Hey guys," said Tiberius, striding over.  He set a firm hand on Steve's shoulder. "How are you feeling, Captain?  Just wanted you to know that we've got a really solid screening process and so the crowd out there is all media... shouldn't be too hostile.  No sign-holders or anything." He patted Steve. "You're going to do great."
Trey was sniggering a little; Tracy mouthed
"I want you to get a cab to our house. JARVIS will let you in. We're coming back tonight," Steve murmured, staring down at Tony's form. He'd have to ask if Trickshot could transfer hospital. "Pepper and Aria should be there, and if Gideon sends any men around, they'll deal with them. And remember, so long as you're somewhere of your own free will, they have no right to take you anywhere. Got it?"
The two of them went to the suite in the back of the plane and all but collapsed into bed.  They slept like the dead until landing; the stress of the reporters and the short trip from the hospital to the plane had worn both of them out.
Tony squeezed his hand.  "Don't worry, I'll set you up with an account.  For our hashtag, I was thinking,
"Tony, we're in one of the lower levels and we found where Steve
Then he pulled away, gently, and undid the lock on the collar.
"Are you all at the end of your cycles?" asked one of the other medics.
He flopped back down and rolled onto his side, curling up.  He knew Steve had done this a hundred times, but that didn't make him feel better, because he wasn't thinking about just Steve anymore, but all the other assholes who bravely signed up and felt good about themselves and then got blown up a few weeks later before they even had time to regret their decision.  Your average soldier didn't get to wear a suit of armor bristling with state-of-the-art weapons; your average soldier was fighting with Hammer Industry SIRs that jammed up when they were most needed. It made Tony sick and he found himself caught in a new cycle of self-loathing. Maybe this was Steve's wheelhouse, but it sure as hell wasn't his.  He'd volunteered for SHIELD because of Steve and for his own sense of reckless adventure, but for him, as an individual, the stakes were low. But that didn't mean he had to like what they were doing.
Steve woke up around eight with Tony beside him. For Tony, it was early, but for Steve, eight AM was a lie-in.
"I think today is the last day. Of our honeymoon, it's like...I feel achy. Like the end of a heat, or something."
"What are you
He was walking closer. He looked unarmed. He was wearing a red sweatshirt with the hood pulled up; that, combined with his ragged hair, meant Steve couldn't see his face. A part of Steve wanted to run, but he didn't. He just... stood there, his hand pressed to the glass. And in a blink the Winter Soldier was right in front of him, on the other side of the glass window, staring in at him.
Steve got them into their tent and set Tony down on the mattress. "Why did you have to get drunk Tony?" he sighed, frowning. His brow knotted together. "Come on. I get that you punched that guy, and that was awesome-- but there's kids around. And you know I hate it. And I don't want other people to see you like this."  He let out a withered sigh. "And it's my birthday," Steve whispered.
A pause.  Tony felt like someone else was taking through his mouth.
One of his hands slid down Steve's thigh gently as he nuzzled Steve's stomach.
"So, I'll see you in an hour then?"
All at once, there was a flash of red light-- an alarm system, tripped and then instantly shut off-- and then it was dark again and there was a loud, electronic click as the door in front of them unlocked.
"Everything's always got to be complicated with you, doesn't it?" said Pepper fondly.  "...what are you going to do with him once he's out?"
Marcus chewed on a slide of garlic mushroom thoughtfully. He was one of the youngest, having only passed the bar a year ago. But he'd known Angela and had worked in her firm before so had come along for the ride. Almost everyone had a partner or a strong support network. They weren't getting paid for this so it wouldn't help them pay rent. Steve knew that Marcus's father owned his own law firm so he could afford to take half a year out.
Boswell came up suddenly, looking tired.  He looked down at Tony, who was trying not to bleed in the pool, and shook his head a little.  "To be young again," he said with a small eye roll. "Tommy, sweetheart, I'm going to bed. You be good now, okay?"
"I urge you to reconsider.  It's quite a lot of fun." Tony cast a pleading look at Steve.  Maggie reached out, took Tony's face in her hand, and reoriented it to look at her.  "...don't ask his permission . He's the omega.
Tony paused to lick a few beads of precum off of Steve's head and then ducked to lap at his slit.  Above him he heard Steve give a weak whine of pleasure, which was almost enough for Tony not to mind Steve's balls pressed against his face.
Tony had made a beeline for the bar the moment Steve was inside the omega-only area.  He got a whiskey and then fiddled with his collar, realizing, unhappily, that Steve was in possession of the keys.
Tony stared at Pepper, not sure what to say to this.
The waiter's eyes glinted.
"I wouldn't dream of it, sir."
Fred shrugged. "Andy always plays. But he only bets money. He pulls out if things get too messy."
it's insane. But when you pulled Tony out of the simulation first you left me in there alone, in his subconscious," he whispered. "Except I wasn't alone. He was
"He's next door," said the woman, staring.
"Oh, yes.  Still very tragic.  But sixty percent of male omegas experience a miscarriage, so you're not alone," he reassured Steve.
"As you know, all your missions have been off the record, and your involvement in SHIELD is, at this time, not endorsed by the United States government.  However, you have some unique skills and knowledge that has proven very useful." Fury tented his fingers. "You've interacted with the Tesseract before, Lately there have been some... anomalies.  We're curious if you've seen anything like that before."
Phil poked his nose out from his nest.  "Well, Banksy is a member, and you know he was force-bonded."
"Please,
He paused again.  If this were the usual blonde beta bimbo, Tony would leave now without looking back.  But he was rooted to the ground.  Because Steve had asked him not to leave and he could feel Steve's emotions as clearly as his own, and leaving would hurt Steve and therefore hurt Tony.  He couldn't do it.
was too geared toward omegas;
Steve paused. He hadn't been expecting that.
"One extraction and delivery," said Rumlow.  "Why?"
This was familiar.  This smell.
Steve took Peggy for walks each day. He knew it couldn't last. Repetitive behaviour was dangerous and he didn't want SHIELD to find him. But Steve savoured every moment. Her willowy frame would lean on his as they traversed around the home's fancy gardens and Gertrude did watch on curiously, pretending to water her plants, drowning the flowers as she stared. On his last day, Peggy seemed sad when he told her he had to go, but she didn't seem surprised either.
...Steve!
to be here.  I worked my ass off to get here… and speaking of my ass, I’d really appreciate it if you kept your hands to yourself.”
Sure enough, Steve had no sooner left the hospital and gotten into an unmarked SUV than he discovered he'd bled through the crotch of the pants Kate had given him.  He was in the same undershirt he'd arrived at the hospital in and it was more blood than clean cloth.  His.  Fury's.  Bucky's.
As for speaking to an omega psychologist... where would he even start?
"Come on," Steve whispered and took Tony's hand. He threatens their fingers together and gently tugged him along towards the upstairs bedroom. He squeezed his hand gently, running his fingers over the bumps of Tony's knuckles. He helped him walk up the stairs but didn't carry him. He didn't think Tony could take that right now.
huh?" demanded Tony, scanning the jungle below him, the augmented reality picking up running bodies using their infared signals.
"It's not about if you love me Tony," he said softly. "It's about if you love me more than you hate what he did." His neck was mostly healed now, the scar pink with newly healed skin. Two distinct shapes had emerged, overlapping, one much clearer than the other.  Once it was completely better, it wouldn't even be obvious there was two bites at a distance; it would only become clear to those who peered hard enough. But they
Steve felt all funny inside when she pulled back and met her smile with one of his own. "Night Pepper. Take it easy."
"Tony's PA let me in," Doctor Brennan said in explanation and Steve felt mildly relieved. "How's it going, Steve?"
"Got it," Steve said softly and perhaps lingered in the doorway a moment longer than he needed to. He swallowed and then tried for a smile that didn't quite meet his eyes. "It's no problem, Tony."
, so she can't
"Hey.  All done.  Thanks for giving us some space," said Tony.
"I consider it irresponsible not to take a week off.  I wouldn't want to burn myself out.  Saving the world, it's, you know, kind of a high-stress job," said Tony, shouldering through the crowd.  He threw up a hand to wave to Pepper; she was climbing out of an SUV about ten meters away.  The two of them gravitated toward each other and made their way toward the clubhouse; they exchanged a kiss on the cheek and the reporters went absolutely crazy.
"My sweet, proud little spade," he growled softly.
"Well, there they are," he said, gesturing.
He went up to the cabin and took the steps two at a time before he opened the door and shut it behind him. He slumped against the door heavily, exhausted both physically and emotionally.
He went back to the truck and watched the twins rifle through the bag of food from the gas station, picking apart a muffin together, peeling an orange.  They tried to talk to him but he ignored them, and they eventually stopped trying, eating their breakfast in silence while he watched.
"-I was being poisoned by the palladium but now I replaced it and I'm going to be fine!" said Tony.
Pepper rose and walked over to them, took the pizza box, tilted Tony's head up, and looked at his eyes.
Steve had not realized how close he and Banksy had become.  Banksy, social butterfly, had so many friends he probably couldn't even name all of them.  But now, he'd only asked for thee people: Danielle, Donner, and Steve.
"Thank you.  At times, my genius surprises even me."
"You can't help what you get turned on by Tony," Steve assured him, voice totally calm. He didn't look annoyed like Tony might have expected; he just looked understanding. "And I know you don't mean it in a degrading way. You can't help how you
Tony stared at Rhodey, still processing what he was seeing.
"So, yeah. No concerns really. I don't think it's all that controversial," Steve breathed with a small smile. Banksy smiled in turn. Danielle nodded.
It was going to take some rather creative editing to make Steve seem lucid.
"...yeah.  I miss it too.  But it won't be the same, you know.  It'll feel different for both of us. And... and I'm worried it's going to burn you," said Tony.  "I don't want to hurt you and... and what if you have a flashback or something?" Supposedly, being force-bonded was extremely traumatic.  Although Steve hadn't seemed too fucked up from it. Maybe because he didn't even remember. Or maybe because it was Bucky.
The asset watched in fascination as the magnificent omega he was so interested in melted before him.
Tony was still largely confused about what was going on with this charity thing and why everyone was in such a good mood.  Pepper must have sensed his confusion because she shoved her tablet into his hands. On the front page of her news feed, headlines read:
When Frond touched behind his ear Steve froze. It was an oddly intimate area and and it felt so wrong for her to being touching him there. And then she whispered in his ear and Steve felt a tremor run up his spine involuntarily. Hang on-- had that felt
He pushed his way through the crowd toward the DJ and politely asked for the mic.  "Hi everyone--" he began.  He didn't get any further.  Tony appeared at his side in a full suit of armor and cheerfully took the microphone without a hint of discomfort.
"Shit!  My phone!" said Pitbull.
He needed to pee again. Goddammit. Was this his constant state now?  He was too proud to ask Tony for help in getting to the bathroom.  He'd wait for Sam.
But then one of them mentioned Pride and Steve knew he wasn't imaging it. "My friend's taking me to a parade for that, or something?  It's in August. He's an Alpha who...an 'acer', that right?" said Steve, glad he finally had something to contribute.
"...you two work it out?"
"Oh my God!" cried Sam.
He caught Steve's eye and seemed to remember they had been having a moment before he began rambling.  "...I'm glad I'm your first," he said softly.  "I'm out of practice... I haven't been romantic with anyone in, ah... shit... I don't know,
. Sure, you have baggage, but you're also like the epitome of human perfection. If he doesn't want you then he's goddamn insane.  Listen, me and Natasha will beat some sense into him for you, okay?"
the serum?  Maybe the bond was severed in some other way.  Maybe, whatever Zola did to him..."
There was a crack and The Winter Soldier suddenly went limp.  He dropped to the ground with a muffled thump.  Behind him, Fury was holding Steve's iron skillet.
"...you're supposed to fill it up with your own information," explained Wanda gently.  "Your own thoughts and ideas."
"From the WSC, Councilwoman Hawley and Councilman Malick.  From SHIELD, Director Fury, Agent Hill, Agent Carter, and Agent McKenzie.  And two members of the Department of Defense."
The thing is... the costume did not leave much to the imagination.  It had been designed that way, to show off his muscles, to highlight how perfect he was.  The perfect soldier. The perfect Alpha... if not for the fact, of course, that Steve wasn't an Alpha at all.  The paradox was erotic in its own way, Steve's body being so well-muscled, but also lithe, the movements of his hips enticing, contradicting the flex of his muscles and the girth of his dick.
Aria was obviously more concerned with Steve than the interview; she'd sat down on the other side of the couch.  Tony snarled at her. She ignored him.
"Have to be honest with you, I'd never expect
Tony was already berating himself silently.  He should've been there.  He should've known.
Tony felt relieved when the conversation turned again.  He knew that people expected kids to follow bonding, just like how people expected kids to follow marriage.  But being confronted with it made him uneasy.
"So, did you guys have a good honeymoon?" Sam asked, trying to steer the conversation away from SHIELD as he sipped at his soda.
"It was a sharp pain at first," Steve said quietly. "And now it just kind of... aches, if that makes sense?"
tell me to instead?" Pietro asked, tilting his head at Steve quizzically. Steve threw him a look over his shoulder.
"Sometimes I just can't help myself.  ...did
Natasha's eyes narrowed. "Well? Don't leave us in suspense, Phil."
Tiberius's eyes were steely, almost murderous.  "She's a beta. She can't tell. Go on. Tell her."  He tightened his grip a little; Pietro gasped in pain.
"No-- Aunt Peggy-- please," protested Tony weakly, but Steve had already opened the album to a picture of Tony and his father, Tony no more than five years old, holding a Captain America action figure.
Steve smiled back and something tingled in his chest. Phil was the first face he was when he woke up and now they'd suffered through a heat sort of together it felt like they were closer. It felt like they were good friends.
Steve found himself memorising the details. The stubble on his neck line, the neat facial hair, the way his hair stuck up.  It reminded him of a dossier he'd read on a mutant who went by the name of Wolverine. The dark hazel of his eyes. Steve swallowed. He wanted to remember, in case...in case...He'd drawn Tony quite a bit, of course he had. He'd drawn Pepper a few times too. It was often on long plane or car journeys. Steve would doodle, it was in his nature, in his blood. He was always the artist before the soldier and he guessed he liked to capture things that mattered to him. He used to draw Bucky hanging out of the window on a muggy summer's day in Brooklyn, smoking with his shirt undone.
He rolled for momentum, sprang to his feet, and moved, crouching low and taking a zigzag pattern.  A man who knew how to avoid enemy fire.  A challenge.
They swung down Wilshire, skyscrapers rising on either side of them.  Steve was at the Wilshire, one of the older buildings, with wrought-iron railings on the balconies and copper adornments that had long since turned green with age.
"We can't carry him, too," Sam said and nodded to the Winter Solider. Bucky had been hit twice so he was pretty much out. His metal fingers twitched, but that was all.
Bucky stared at him in horror.
Steve stepped back out cleaner than before and moved to pull on his clothes. Tony was still in bed. He sighed fondly and moved over to kiss his forehead. "Come on. Up." He poked Tony's bicep. "I'll make you some coffee but you better be dressed when I come back in here..."
"Actually," replied Pepper in a cool, measured voice, "he's gotten worse since Afghanistan."
'Kind of out of it' had become Steve's polite way of saying that Tony was going through a bad drinking phase. It meant he could talk about it with Natasha and Clint in public or around other people and not have to worry about dropping Tony in it. Laura seemed to also know what it meant though, or at least...she knew it wasn't good. "But with my neck he's great, actually," Steve added softly. "Better than me, even."
The couple groaned.
"...did you say
an omega.  He didn't deserve to be loved or to be happy.  If he had, wouldn't his father have loved him?  If he had been a good person, if he hadn't been loathsome, then would Stane, his business partner for decades, the man closer to him than his own father had ever been... would Stane have betrayed him, tried to kill him?
"You just saved like twenty kids. Yes Steve, it's a positive response."
Steve looks at him with serious weight in his eyes. “I’m not going to smash it to pieces, Tony.”
, he loves her. But there’s some part of him, now that he’s seen Steve, talked to Steve for the first time in two years, that is buzzing and whirring, like the machinery in his workshop when he’s obsessed with a new idea, a new project, something he can’t let go of even in the middle of the night, even when Pepper is calling him to bed.
“I figured out time travel. And Morgan loves me three thousand.” Two things it kills him to say, even the second time round. Both things equally momentous and gut-wrenching.
“I’m not giving it back to you for a practical purpose.”
“Right. You’re giving it back to me because it’s
“Yeah, and Papa found me,” she says cheerfully. They hadn’t made Steve one of Morgan’s oddfathers, in the end; he’d just become one of her fathers, playing nearly as big a role as Tony. He only spends every other week at the lake house; the rest of the time he’s at the Compound, with Natasha, directing what remains of the Avengers team in their efforts to stabilise the universe, and he’s still running his little support group, which gets smaller every year.

“What
And Pepper asks him whether he would be able to rest if he stops.
He’s up late again, tinkering in the garage, and Pepper comes in. He’s used to being the one who stays awake through the night, but lately she’s been having trouble sleeping too. She’s extremely pregnant now, and it’s a wonderful sight, but also deeply terrifying, far more so than the dizzying void of space. A child,

failures?”
“No, I… I needed him, and he wasn’t there, and I thought that was that, but it turns out—I still need him. Even when the fight’s over. Even when all that’s left is just living our lives as best as we can in this wreck of a world. Even when I have you, my incredible amazing extraordinary wife, and this gorgeous house by the lake, and our sure-to-be adorable baby on the way. I still need him.”
“I don’t like it because it’s not colourful,” Morgan contributes, which is valid criticism, because it’s an exceedingly dull shield, mostly grey with only a thin circle of blue and the muted gold around the edges, and Tony’s usually a lot bolder than that with his colour usage. “But why doesn’t Daddy like it?”
When it’s his turn, he passes. Steve’s eyes linger on him for just a second.
“I like meatballs and spaghetti,” Steve says, in a slightly dazed tone of voice, which just enriches Tony’s glee.
He knows better.
Tony twirls the stem of his champagne flute between his fingers, holding the other steady. “She’s seen me go through
Morgan wrinkles her nose. “Daddy’s heart looks like
Steve smiles wryly. “No. I mean. It doesn’t have to be fighting. But that’s the kind of thinking I’ve been stuck in. The fight just doesn’t seem to end, for me. Always something in the world I have to stand up for, to defend. But after I came here, and saw this, saw you… This life started to call to me. And it’s because of you. Because this is
Tony gives her a rueful smile, and she drapes herself over his back, hugging him from behind. Steve looks embarrassed, wiping his face with his sleeve, but he’s perfect, and Tony thinks—yeah. This is it. This is, at long last, it. Where all his nightmares and all his dreams have finally led him, to the place where this moment is the only moment. Not the next moment or the moment before; not grief over the past or anxiety about the future, but this moment, complete in itself, absolute and all-encompassing.
“You’re not the only one.”
“Yeah, I have her.” Steve smiles, small but fond. “She just told me you’ve made her Morgan’s godmother. That’s wonderful.”
A support group. Right. Of course Cap is running one.
“I am
Two years, and these are the circumstances finally bringing them together again, and Tony is so
everything you are. So here we are.” Pepper takes Tony’s hand and kisses the centre of his palm. “I love you, Iron Man.”
“Oh good,” Tony says, and Steve kisses him softly.
She squeezes his shoulder. “All right. Are you sure you’re actually doing anything useful and not just brooding over it?”
Natasha looks even more shocked, and Tony considers that an achievement. Her mouth goes slack, her eyes round. Then she looks—
“I didn’t make it for you, it was an
. Her lips curving slowly upward, a soft light in her eyes, a fullness in her cheeks. “Yeah, I’d like that.” She ducks her head. “Lovely to meet you, Morgan.”
After that, Nebula wanders over. Tony can tell that Pepper’s nervous about handing over her baby to the Blue Meanie—the only interaction Pepper’s had with Nebula before this was when she thanked Nebula for looking after Tony in space—but Tony’s confident that Nebula can hold a baby just fine; she’s attentive and cautious and has a strong protective streak. And she does indeed do a stellar job of holding Morgan, even if she looks a little stiff and awkward the whole time. “A daughter,” she mutters, her face inscrutable as always as she stares down at the baby.
“You want to be friends again.”
Pepper sits up too. “I haven’t seen that. That’s very different. What happened to the ‘iconic look’?”
to think about that, thank you Pep,” he whispers back. “I much prefer him here, holding
They’d been talking about all the things that Pepper’s been trying to do lately with Stark Industries to help keep the world running with half the population gone, but Tony’s drowsy in the sun now and glad for an lighter topic of conversation.
“Oddfather,” Tony corrects him again, before he has to force himself to consider the full weight of what Steve’s asking him. “Yeah. Of course there was a time. And there might be again. Now come on, Morgan doesn’t like to be kept waiting.”
Tony doesn’t notice that Pepper’s in the room until she says, sounding startled by the scene before her, “I left you guys for two minutes and you’re sobbing all over each other?”
“What’re you watching?” Tony asks, leaning against the door jamb.
“It looks kind of like the arc reactor,” Pepper observes, helpfully. “Your original ones, before you got all into nanoparticles or whatever.”
“I should’ve seen this coming,” Tony says, feeding Morgan a strawberry.
, Pepper, and that trumps everything else.”
“We should get chickens,” he says, without really being that invested in whether they shoud actually get chickens, but Pepper starts seriously considering it and listing the pros and cons of getting chickens, and that’s nice, too.
“You should be embarrassed,” Pepper says, gently jabbing him in the ribs with her elbow. “You made that ‘bad idea’ and then you kept it even after we moved house
