Eventually, he walked by Tony’s room, seeing the red light from the dim bulbs inside seep out into the corridors. Steve couldn’t help but peer into the door that was slightly ajar and noticed Tony sitting on the edge of his bed. His back was facing the door, he was shirtless and sat there with his face in his hands. It was that moment Steve’s eyes widened, he noticed these large black drooping shadows that extended from his shoulder blades to the bed. But there was something more about these shadows. They seemed to fall strangely, as though they were resting on the bed. Steve stepped closer and then touched the door with a mesmerised expression plastered over his face.
Tony stared at him with wide blue eyes, not believing what he was hearing; were heroes actually getting killed by people?
She had a level of strength that some may call superhuman, a true asset to the police force when she had joined, and was certainly an ability that no one wanted to mess with. As she charged in, she pummelled her fist into the now exposed circuitry and the leg began to spark, the circuitry fried by the powerful strike. The bot howled and continued its chant, though slightly distorted as it collapsed on its one good leg, kneeling there and trying to retaliate. Its mouth opened and of course, there had to be missiles.
Tony nodded understandably and eventually they reached the now gated off Central Park. Large jagged iron bars decorated outside, all that were once black now covered with a green moss that crept from the base to the spikes. It looked haunting, dark, with very few streetlights around – only a couple of flickering lights from the broken lamps nearby.
Steve grinned and stood back to back with Tony after whipping out his shield and holding it up to defend them both. The second possessed scientist crawled and leaped toward Steve but was blocked by the cracked Vibranium circle. Just like the behemoths that Tony had faced before, he should’ve known that one punch wasn’t enough to keep them down. He wasn’t there to witness how Carol and Jessica had finally taken them down, if indeed they had managed; he only saw the aftermath.
Tony’s hand scrubbed through his hair, breathing heavily. It felt as though all of the air was being sapped from his lungs, his head pounding, his chest strained and feeling as though a weight rest upon it. It was only then that his eyes shot open with dread and he sprinted around the room to safe, opening it to reveal that there was nothing there.
Tony let Steve get ready in a couple of modern looking clothes, modern being a rather lightly put term considering the combinations that Steve had decided upon; beige trousers, white t-shirt that had come out of his box of things with the crest of his camp on it and over that a dark blue jumper. Not too bad, but not great either.
Steve was the only man who could touch Tony like that, the only man who Tony would allow to do that, especially after what Howard had done to him as a child, he was almost afraid of men of authority after that.
; the lab that he had spent the majority of his time within that all for the better word was more of a home to him than any other location within the building. His scanners began scouring the area on his command. Cyan screens appeared before his eyes, detailing and profiling every device until he spotted a mirror that was docked on a circular platform. It stood apart, almost as though it was a trophy on a stand…of course, unlike some sort of sports trophy, the mirror was protected by soft humming red lasers. Tony wanted to roll his eyes at this seemingly pathetic attempt at security as though it were some sort of pre-emptive measure once Reed had discovered Tony’s interest in the device, but instead just waved his hand and smirked. His mind went into the system, reading binary as though it were simple text in a book and re-writing it to his fancies. The encryption was easy to bypass given that he had hacked into much more sophisticated systems before. His eyes changed colour momentarily to a hue of red whilst his mind focused on keying in a number of codes to access the systems that powered the red beams. It had taken precisely three minutes forty five seconds (as he had predicted whilst formulating the initial plan on his way to the building initially) until the lights flickered and the red laser lines faded entirely. The red hue of his eyes that the lights on his armour matched in tone faded and he continued, running his fingertips idly through his windswept hair that poked over the crown of his remaining helmet.
His cyan shimmering eyes took in the mirror. He’d anticipated his reflection, but saw something very different; A swirl of colour similar to that of colliding galaxies with vibrant colours and dazzling lights in the distance, as though he were staring into space from the very spot he stood. This was an invention that Reed had talked about briefly, but had deemed far too dangerous in the past and had deemed it far too unstable to be used. These days, Tony saw the words ‘dangerous’ and ‘unstable’ as nothing but a challenge, particularly with his current mind-set. After all, he was a veritable deity in his current state. No god should have to face barriers, but then life would be boring, and Tony did enjoy challenges now and again. Gods needed minions; they needed companions to rule with them and under them. Matt Murdock’s refusal to offer his help, the open defiance displayed when he had slapped Tony’s hand away, was ever on his mind. After all, Tony
“Marco…?” he proceeded to say after a few more steps inward. The dust shifted under his heavy boots, with each thump on the wooden floor there was a small puff upward.
His hand hovered for a moment just above Steve before tentatively moving in to touch the corner of his strong jaw. He felt a sigh of relief escape his lips the moment he managed to, and then slowly trailed his hand along the square of the man’s jaw, all to receive no reaction from Steve at all. Again he chewed at the corner of his lips, index finger skimming along the Captain’s neck, coursing past his Adams apple and then back up to the other side of his jaw. There was no such structure as perfect as he, the angel that lay lifeless on the desk.
“Angels aren’t real… Asides from the X-man.” Tony explained, looking into the deep azure eyes of the man before him.
The Green Goblin stepped out, tugging down his dark purple glove to reveal his monstrosity of a hand with a switch drooping in his palm. “I’m sure you know what this is, Tony Stark!”
Steve was shaking and Tony could feel it, especially when he reached his belt buckle. His hands went for Steve’s, gliding his agile fingers down them. “I can help…” He whispered.
Steve’s fluid pencil movement halted mid-line, turning his head to try and get Tony in his vision. “Why?” He asked cautiously, a low hum about his voice amplified with suspicion.
Tony moved up and down, swaying his head back and then burying it once again into the crook of the man’s neck, panting loudly. He could see even in the dim light of their reactors that Steve had flushed cheeks. To calm him he pressed a kiss to any flesh that his lips could seek, his own hands dipping along each crease of the beautifully sculpted abdomen and trailing up to his shoulders, finding himself grappling on for support as Steve picked up the pace of each thrust.
“How can I rest assured when that’s on the streets? Good day, sir!” She stomped away, even though it was hard for Steve to take her dramatic switch in gratitude so seriously when she had bits of white foam over her clothes.
“I think that’s my cue to get inside.” Steve spoke through a laugh, reaching for his uniform cap and carrying it under his arm. “You’re sure she’ll take you home safe and sound? We all know you hate driving after what you’d told me…”
Whilst lying face down, he knew he had one last hope. Shutting his eyes and rolling to face Steve. “It’s okay Steve. Remember no matter what, it’ll be okay. You can do this.” He smiled the bright light in the middle of his chest lighting up further and further.
“Enough with this speculation!” Carol shouted. “We all know Detective Stark. We know that he’s a great guy with a heart of gold, when it comes down to it. We need to go and send as many men as we can to stop this bot, first of all. I’m sure Tony can’t be behind this…”
The haunting cackle was the last thing he heard before his hearing became fuzzy; a mass of panic began to overwhelm him, none like any other. He pulled back a little from the control pad to grab his head, attempting to stop the vivid ringing. It was the very same ringing that he’d head back when the air raid happened back in London, and to this day it haunted him.  He could remember the shattering of glass, the screams of the people outside and then moments later after that explosion he saw them, their corpses laying still, the life drained out of them. Those haunting memories were attacking him even there, in the midst of battle and crippling him into a state where his entire body fell numb just from the thought.
Eventually he reached Tony’s room, taking a gander at the bottom of the door and noticing the lights were out. So Tony was probably down in his lab, which meant Steve would be able to investigate and check the systems to see if the mechanic had chosen to change the rota for whatever reason.
“I’m not an animal either, I…” Steve paused, hearing his stomach growl again and pulling back from the glass. “I’m a… I’m still me.” He repeated, mainly as a mantra to himself.
Sifting through the rubble was a different story entirely. He began moving the rocks around to free his armoured legs, finally kicking a few of Hammer’s now-dead drones away from him. It was disgusting that the man saw his creations as disposable. Tony had a completely different outlook on everything that he built, which was why he was so sentimental toward his creations. It was almost upsetting to see fallen robotics that were used so carelessly.
What hurt even more was that he was doing this to his friend, that his friend had suffered that much to have to endure this pain. Carol meant a lot to him; after all, they had suffered from the same demon in the past haunting them over and over- alcohol. He hacked at the wire and then changed where it was connected to, but that didn’t stop Carol from flinching in agony.
The dust filled their lungs and made Peter hack; Tony too, once he tasted what seemed to be moss with a hint of copper in his mouth. Nonetheless, after that small distraction he brushed back Peter’s brown tufts of hair that covered the back of his skull. Tony narrowed his eyes and saw the stiches, right then he knew he’d have to cut it open. “This might hurt.”
It was beginning to get frustrating with the amount that Tony had to dig through to no avail. The spits of rain kept getting in his face, but he kept trudging on regardless, pushing away the stones, throwing the rubble from side to side to desperately reach his partner.
No pearly gates or bright light, just an abyss of darkness and the disgusting taste of metal. As he looked up he could see Steve standing at that door trying to get out, but not just Steve, he could see this beautiful pristine man standing there dressed all in white, with beams of light shining behind him as though he really were an angel, an angel trapped in that room.
Tony snapped his teeth at the rude comments the tourists made, reaching out to try and scratch them.
Steve enjoyed it really, seeing Tony so possessive over him, just reminded him of how he treated him when the man had first seen him without the super soldier serum, so protective, so adoring.
Steve glanced down momentarily at the tiny chip he was given, nodding and tucking it securely into his own armour.
“It’s us, yes.” Steve bit at the corner of his lower lip nervously, keeping his head turned away for a moment so that Tony wouldn’t catch that moment of weakness. His drawings were his heart on paper; they were everything to him, and having someone dislike his work (especially someone he held so dear) would have hurt broken him.
He wasn’t supposed to be watching. At this point Tony was supposed to turn the shutters and turn the glass into a blind, but instead he dialled it to a one way mirror so that he could see through. Reed, Hank and T’Challa weren’t in the lab at that time in the morning; they were catching up on their own rest as well as running samples in their own lab. Tony was the only one there and he was barely awake. Staying up for as long as he did was having a number of ill effects on him, especially his mental state. He felt like a wreck and strangely emotional, as well as exhausted, frustrated and upset, his body was trembling oh so slightly and his teeth chattered – the freezing cold atmosphere of the labs was actually getting to him. He covered himself up with a black turtleneck, and yet he still shivered, but he didn’t want to tear his eyes away from Steve for a second.
To be quite honest, Steve didn’t know what he was in for. He knew he’d be partnered up with a detective but he had just assumed it was one of the regulars for a case. Detective-cop partnerships were often short term anyway, just for a single case and once that was over that was the end of it.
“Sir Rogers…” Tony tried to mumble between the feathery brushes of Tony’s apple tasting lips, pulling him closer.
“He’s waking up…” Tony whispered. “He’s waking up! Doctors, get here right now, he’s waking up!” He had never felt so excited in his entire life. The last time he had been this elated was when he had built his ballistic missile.
Tony gasped for breath, spitting out the battery fluid tasting blood from his mouth in what little space he had. He was trying to seek solace within his memories, trying to plead for mercy and one more chance to save Steve. His pleas were answered when there was a bright light, the shelf was lifted by Steve who threw the shelf back against the wall aggressively, but upon impact it broke.
“I wasn’t but hey,” he said with a shrug. “Fine, you, me and Janet, we’ll get this taken care of. T’challa, can you keep an eye out and tell me if you can see if you’ve got anything else on the system. I’ll have Rhodey clear the air for us so we can make sure that no civilians get injured if this thing does go off then at least the surrounding area is safe.”
It was easier to tilt his head upward since he didn’t have his helmet. As he did, he was reminded of the injuries that he’d incurred earlier, that sharp pain shooting down from the base of his neck down his spine. With a quick cringe, he shook off the pain, catching sight of Captain America handing the boy over, and the jet flying away. He needed to catch that jet up, and now the decisions were starting to weigh up; go and help Carol, follow Steve or save Peter.
Steve couldn’t hold on any longer, and the bomb was flashing red – and that’s when it dawned on him. “Bucky! Let go! It might be booby trapped! You can’t deactivate the bomb without me! Drop off!” He yelled.
He climbed up, heaving his body to the roof, turning his head when Steve ended up driving side by side. He’d done it; he’d managed to push the car to its very limits while Tony was preoccupying the driver. Luckily all that pervious swerving had given Steve some time to close the gap between them and Steve grabbed hold of the radio.
That was an awkward shift in conversation as he pulled Steve by the arm toward the looted store, being careful as he stepped inside. He grabbed a black long sleeve t-shirt, simple, chic, perfect – asides from the arm he had to tear off to fit his bionic arm through, but he considered himself a fashionista of sorts so this was just him making a regular outfit fabulous. Jeans and a pair of sneakers were next – it was far more comfortable than wearing his soaked to the bone workshop clothing, in fact being in dry clothes again warmed him up instantly, he could feel himself burying his face into the fabric at times with pure and utter gratitude. Without a doubt he had shifted into his new gear with Steve standing right there. He wasn’t bashful around the Captain, after all, he had seen a
But if there was one thing neither of them could stand, it was silence, even in desolate times Peter needed to hear words around him, even if they weren’t necessarily words of comfort. He had to fill in the silence.
Tony curled up on the floor, bursting into tears the moment his father left, and it was that very moment that the small grey wings faded and turned black.
Tony laughed a little, “Puh-lease. Grey’s Anatomy is far more interesting.” His eyes returned to the screen where there was a huge map, eyes darting from highlighted point to point to see all of the places where the weapons were. He clicked on the point on the Empire State Building – only to see the schematics of the bomb that they were trying to dismantle.
As he reached the heap, he dashed to move to the next which was only a couple of yards away, but felt his movement slow, his leg was starting to drag. With a groan he used his arm to lift it and heave it forward so that his strides were long, but slow.
Another sharp movement. Tony’s systems were displaying the flow of the virus in the corner of his screen, and it seemed fine, the movement looked identical to what it was before.
He had to shut his eyes, but he kept telling himself that he wouldn’t cry that this wasn’t something to be sad over. They had encountered too many evils in their lives for him to break down now. But his pillar was crumbling right before him, weakened and broken. His chest felt heavy, his breaths were short and he tensed his muscles to stop his body from shaking any further. He couldn’t imagine what Steve was feeling, but as usual the soldier kept a face of stone, taking it all on the chin as he would say.
“Surely you control the weather,” Clint said, sharp blue eyes focused outside as he stood by the window, being the only Avenger standing asides from Tony. He couldn’t help it. The outdoors just looked like a scene from an upcoming apocalyptic movie, something straight out of one of the Avengers movie nights that Jan insisted on having as team bonding.
“I need to know specifics, Fury. I can’t just go on what you’re saying.” Fury’s words were like daggers, stabbing his temple each time he provided a dosage of information which resulted in an even more severe headache.
Tony couldn’t see Steve any more, it’s like in that very moment with his father’s words, he had fallen from grace, fallen from his father’s eyes. He’d become a fallen angel, and even prior to that his wings had become dark in colour, probably due to previous and similar situations to the one he had witnessed.
He nodded without a second thought, “You’re so… Smooth.” Steve’s metal fingers rubbed up and down his sides, the cold metal against him making him shudder and purr. With each touch he was becoming dizzier with lust, tilting his head back and enjoying the attention he was receiving. No one cared for him like that, not a single person he had been with had displayed the tenderness that Steve was doing at that moment in time.
With a great frustration and increasing anxiety, Steve nodded in understanding and began to resume his pace toward the quarantine doors. “I want to be out of this as soon as possible.”
Being a director wasn’t all perks that was for sure, and became particularly relevant as soon as he had to go through the expenditure and give a sign off on certain things to the accountants and so on – masses of bureaucracy went into running a huge industry like that, and finance was the most meticulous process.  As he was sifting through the papers he’d noticed something – an expense that was being diverted to a subsidiary off the coast of England. Tony’s hand ran along his well-trimmed beard, pinching his chin a little as he ran through the spending which was for equipment, utilities, payrolls – all to a place off the coast of England that he had never once been made aware of. In fairness, he hadn’t ever fine lined the finances this thoroughly, but it still concerned him. He got to his feet and started going through the old files that were still in paper form, sifting through the large folders and trying to find what on earth was in that location.
“What are you talking about? You realise all of my facilities are powered by arc reactor technology, right? This thing here can’t be the only one left.” He tapped his chest, mainly in gratitude that he’d once again been saved by the electromagnet next to his heart.
There it was, that little tightness he felt in his chest began to swell when Tony had said those last words. Sure, he had been confused and a little scared of Tony at first given his enigmatic reputation and then the robotics that startled him, but when he explained there was nothing really dislikeable about him. “They yell at you a lot, huh?”
“No drinks or couch?” Tony shrugged as he looked around the dead end that he’d been cornered into, usually where the huge dumpsters would be but they were clearly moved for more space. He stared analytically at them through the gaps in the face plate.
A thick mist of cigar smoke flooded the room and obstructed the bright light, but Steve just nodded gratefully and sat down, though again truth be told he felt like he was wasting time here; at least he could get to work once he was fully briefed.
Tony could feel the life draining from his body, the slow seep. He struggled to breathe, every small movement of his chest ached. His reactor still fizzled, after all, the reactor was just a few fractions away from his heart. If it were a straight hit, he knew he would be dead by now, bled straight to death. But he was kept alive, the reactor however was in terrible condition. Being shattered meant that it was running on limited power, and with that, Tony could barely move at all.
Now he was ready to go. But to try and look discrete or to be noticed was the new question on his mind. Who was he kidding? He was Tony Stark; of course he’d be noticed. That was pretty much out of the question.
He frowned, rubbing his jaw, then Peter swung by and landed on his own two feet beside Tony, eyes fixed on Carol.
The first mission was the Boomerang. It happened around lunch, when Steve followed the sound of crashing near one of New York’s biggest banks, which was a hotspot for criminals. He was suited, ready for action in his repaired costume that Tony and Janet Van Dyne had a personal hand in remaking and remodelling, though still bared a strong resemblance to his old costume. Now he had Kevlar scales along the blue of his uniform, it was light weight, streamlined materials that made every action that much easier. His repaired shield sat on his back and people stared as the flash of red white and blue streaked past them, leaping over cars to get to his destination far quicker.
But in truth, Tony quite liked just having Steve around. It was like living with a good friend – and Rhodey certainly approved once he met Steve. Tony stood back and let the two talk about their military business – Steve being in the Army and Rhodey being in the Air Force meant that the banter was present, Rhodey trying to be polite and holding off just a bit. Tony would pout in the distance knowing that Rhodey could go all guns blazing, and usually would when he was concerned, but he could see too that there was a degree of respect exchanged between the two. It was great to see his idol and best friend get along with one another. Tony couldn’t wait for Steve to meet Carol, now
A mass of rubble had managed to pile on top of Steve during the fall, probably when the strength of the explosion was so powerful that Tony was knocked away from Steve – but clearly he had helped protect him somehow – if Tony hadn’t thrown himself and his weight on him Steve wouldn’t have been on the ground. The shifts and falls of rubble must have been an after effect when Tony was unconscious – pushing them slightly away from each other only after the explosion from after-shocks from the building. That’s why there was rubble between Steve and Tony.
The sweaty calamity of bodies made the bed springs creak loudly as Steve insistently rock. Tony’s knuckles turned white from how hard he was clutching the sheets, letting out deep throated moans even with Steve occupying his mouth hungrily. He could feel soft strands of golden brush against his cheek and he couldn’t help but let one hand lose to smooth along Steve’s back, feeling along his sharp shoulder blade before clutching to his skin. The clutch turned into him digging his nails into him, but Steve enjoyed it, letting out satisfied ‘mmm’ against Tony’s lips when he felt it.
“I can’t just magically make myself believe you, I’ve got beliefs too and angels aren’t one of them.” He said stubbornly, though internally he was heartbroken to say such a thing and watch Steve’s ‘wings’ malt because of him. Steve shouldn’t have expected any less of him. His wings shuddered again and another feather fell, this time Tony saw it appear and then disappear again. He squinted further and he could see the wings that were wrapped around him.
Tony cringed and then rushed up to Steve as quickly as he could, wiping the mess away with his smooth metal fingers. “Cap? Steve?”
Eventually they fell down the stairs, collapsing in a huge heap with Steve muttering something and Tony luckily landing on top of him. What a calamity. His cheek was firmly planted on a cushion, or at least he’d thought it was a cushion. When he drew his face back he realized it was Steve’s behind and he quickly shot up, standing on his feet, firm on the ground with his rollerblades away.
The next morning Steve was in the kitchen of the mansion, with the others happily going about their day and exploring the new place, as well as settling in. It was nice for once to hear the busy chatter.
Reed took a deep breath, scared and worried. He hoped with all of his being that Tony would be back soon and that the robots would come to life and help him, but for now they were all down. A floating, squished looking head moved around the room trying to dig through the papers, and keeping the EMP at work, which kept all of the robots down. Hesitantly he met the blues staring back at him, his voice strained and hoarse. “How will this help you?! Victor, we could have been a great team together, we could have helped you if you had the right ethics behind your work. But you want nothing but power, and that’s the reason that you’re struggling now.”
“That’s got nothing to do with it. You just… Please, believe me. I can’t tell anyone but you, you’re the angel, you’re like me. I don’t know what happens when angels tell humans that they’re angels…”
He just had to carry on by putting on his uniform, taking his place as the Captain of the Avengers, pretending it was nothing but a dream.
He stepped through the first set of doors to the sterilising chamber and allowed his suit pieces to slide off to get treated before he himself was doused with water and mist, it was extremely thorough and ensured that nothing was brought back into the lab with him. He eventually stepped out into a clean robe and fuzzy slippers, scrubbing at his hair with a soft personalised towel while he walked into the cleaned medical bay again with the others frantically arguing amongst themselves over whatever it was on that screen.
His sight went straight to Steve the second he cracked open the door. The man sat, wearing his black turtleneck and jeans. He’d wrapped up warm and snug whilst sitting at his desk, sketching while he took a bite out of a piece of chicken. There was a pile of chicken bones on a plate off to the side, away from Steve’s artwork.
Steve breathed heavily and continued to pull at the chains. Zola’s words were becoming hazy as more chemicals were pumped through his system. His head began to hang before he snapped out of it, and he tried to look up, only to sink once more. For a moment, he could’ve sworn he noticed a flash of gold, though that could’ve just been wishful thinking on his part. The amount of times Tony had saved him and he had saved Tony, it had only become natural to develop an unintentional co-dependency on his partner to an extent where he would hope with all of his heart that he would be the one breaking through the doors at that very moment.
He was using the tip of the piece to cut the tiny chip as though it were a scalpel, scratching at a particular piece to see a spark fly and then pulling back a bit. “The wounds open… Give me some of your webbing fluid, the deoxygenised type, fresh from the can.”
“Tony... I’ll never leave you, I promise. Whenever you feel dark, whenever you feel low, just promise me you’ll just... Be strong, just remember us, remember what we had.”
Tony took a deep breath, mustering up as much courage as he could. Already, he hated the fact that he had to drag Steve back down into the medical bay for a re-test, knowing for well the apprehension and wall of stubbornness that he was about to face.
“Mmmph!” he struggled, his hands reaching up and trying to grip the ones that held him, attempting to tear them away with the little strength he had remaining.
Tony’s teeth began to grind together and he pressed his ear against the star shaped light, hearing the soft buzz that now replaced a heartbeat. His hands reached up and laced with Steve’s, feeling a need to be close to him, needing to hear him, to just be by his warmth. It was comforting just having him there, no matter what state he was in. Steve was his rudder, he always would be.
She knew what she was doing, she was a Captain – no, a colonel, she’d commanded men before, so with hesitation, Tony listened to her words. Now they had to find a way to escape, but again, Tony’s movements were sluggish because of that clunk of steel that was now his leg. On second thought, he wasn’t just going to let them stay here like that. A good soldier never leaves a man behind, that’s what
Mustering up as much strength as he could, he began to sidle over. He wriggles like a caterpillar, swinging his lower body first and then urging his upper body to follow. Slowly the warmth of the sheets below him become a distant memory as he finally reaches the other side of the bed. Although, the front of his body remained covered under the thick double quilted sheets which allowed him to regain some sort of comfort. Winter days were always the worst, even more so when the windows were iced up. Tony could still spot that even with distorted vision.
He drew back, to kiss the crook of Tony’s neck, to his pleasure Tony moved accordingly and tilted his head to the other side, his hands scrambling down Steve’s spine, then to his collar again, gripping at his tie to lure him closer, to maintain that distance so he could feel the warm cascade of Steve’s breath along his skin.
Tony nodded and tucked the comic book into his back pocket, stepping away from the gates but locking them. At least everything in the front yard would be safe for now, he hoped.
Reeds hand stretched over, and he placed one hand on Tony’s shoulder to reassure him. He grasped lightly at the fabric of the work-top that he’d yet to change out of.
T’Challa had done a great job evacuating the city, as he said he’d do. It was clear from the get go that there was something big lurking on the horizon, so T’Challa’s call to evacuate the city was certainly a good idea, but it left them in this barren city that they were both so used to being the centre of attention, the hustle and bustle being nothing but a quiet whisper of the wind now. Hammer’s explosives not only impacted the factory – there was a trigger of explosives spanning the entirety of the city that looked as though they had all detonated at the same time. The smoke was turning white, the rain having extinguished most of the embers by now. If there were stragglers left after T’Challa’s evacuation, then they had most certainly looted the stores. Broken glass was scattered everywhere, store windows were clearly broken into, displays were taken, and clothes and some items littered the streets.
Tony’s arm twitched. It was as though he could feel the sadness from Steve again; he could feel how the scraping on the concrete was a constant reminder of what he had lost. His hand reacted by placing itself on Steve’s shoulder, as though it had a mind of its own for a moment. His expression, clearly surprised as he withdrew, staring at his new appendage while he flexed its fingers out, “Sorry about that… Anyway, I was thinking that we could maybe…” His head tilted toward an open store window.
“You and your logic are indescribably monotonous, and your mythology is un-renewed! You believe destroying things is the best way forward?”
“I won’t back down Tony.” He squeezed his shoulder lightly and they locked glances. “You’re one of the nicest guys I’ve met, and you’re smart too. You’ve taught me a trick or two and I think that we make a great team.”
Slowly he reaches for Tony’s hand, even though it’s difficult to pry his arm away from around his shoulder, and slips the ring on. Tony had never before been so eager to kiss those heart shaped lips that were dusted with the aftertaste of sweet chocolate. Steve returns the passionate kiss until they have to part their lips to take in a breath of air. Then the claps of the others followed.
Hammer’s armour collapsed and fell apart, but that came as no surprise to the duo that stood side-by-side, staring down at the mess of a machine.
“I’m glad they weren’t interested, having Sunset around running an entire industry would be…” He cut himself off and just shuddered instead to demonstrate his point.
Steve shook his head but maintained eye contact, “No Tony, they’re real, you know I’m not particularly religious, I do remember my ma’s teachings but no… You’re an angel Tony, I can see your wings.”
“This is impossible, a new mutation, a new disease…” Hank pondered over a few samples with Reed close-by, T’challa reading off the screen readings too.
“W-what did you do to Tony?!” Steve yelled, wincing under the excruciating pressure. The push to his side was forcing the bones to crack, he could
Slowly he eased himself down, feeling the tip of Steve’s stiffness against him, feeling the warmth which made a change from the fingers, a pleasant change. He pushed down against it, his body shaking but Steve positioning his arms around Tony’s frame to give him all of the support he needed. Tony cried out, his shoulders easing back.
The reason that they were so calm and collected, and the reason that Bucky was so convincing and so willing to shift subject, was that they were manufactured – this was all a manufactured world, stemming from Steve’s memories and changed, thrown into code and re-coded by the scientists in order to simulate what they want, when they want, how they want. Steve’s mind was theirs to control, unbeknownst to the Super Soldier.
“You make it sound like you’re dying.” Tony chuckled sadly. “When actually you’re coming back to life from being dead, surely that shouldn’t count as a last wish then? On a technicality?”
He looked around him as white glowing wings formed from his back, feeling alleviated, as though his soul were being lifted. Slowly he tilted his head back and shut his eyes, letting the feeling overwhelm him, letting the light take him in. The glowing wings began to raise, lifting him off the floor, through the darkness.
Tony shut his eyes and rocked his hips ever so gently against the hand, encouraging each motion that was being made, keen to show how much he was enjoying it. It had seemed like forever since they had been together, and this was their first time in such an intimate circumstance, even though it felt as though they had been there before Tony knew that was only probably from the copious amounts of dreams he had of the other man doing these things to him, but he could never fathom this sort of scenario.
“He’s our best sniper. Self-trained. SWAT like to borrow him from time to time but he’s the best gunman we have on the team.”
“No, find the specifics, get back to us and then we’ll take him down. Our priority is to get the satellite back up. That’s what I’ll be doing.”
“I don’t know how you can either, come on Steve, you know I’m a man of science. I wasn’t raised like you…”
When he’d returned on from his first day on duty he was surrounded by the four that had greeted him in the staff room; all demanding details, but Steve wasn’t one to talk behind a person’s back so he just nodded and shrugged most of the time, regaling them with stories about wacky cat owners.
The other man bluntly ignored him and began brutally punching the woman in front of him, something that everyone knew the Star Spangled Man would never do, not in a thousand years. For a moment they both stood there in shock as he pulverised their friend, that’s when Peter jumped in and webbed Steve’s arm, yanking it away. Tony took the time to fetch Carol, pulling her into his arms and seeing her broken and beaten, brushing away the bloodied up shrapnel from her face, cobweb cracks over the eye plates. Using his propulsion system in his boots, Tony managed to take to the air, leaping over the giant iron bars of the park and placing Carol down in it before zooming back toward Peter who was being attacked by the other man in the armour.
out, yet alone him. This did a number on the Juggernaut a long time ago, and now it’s been refined.” Hank implored Tony to consider, gesturing over to the vial that was just perched on top of a Bunsen burner; the gentle blue flame danced beneath it to cause small bubbles to rise from the top. “Once that’s settled in, it may delay the decay that’s occurring in the Captain’s brain. At minimum, it should freeze the physical destruction that that the lesions on his skin are inflicting to the surrounding tissue.”
“Night, Cap.” Tony whispered before heading into his room, Steve doing the same, both of them returning to their beds.
Steve’s arm flailed and a bullet shot out, shattering the glass ceiling. Norman’s attention was brought to it right away, the heavy rain entering the building whilst the thunder rumbled above.
Tony broke the kiss and panted near to Steve’s bright red ear, “I’m going to…” He warned, clutching tighter onto his muscular shoulders, just above where the arms began.
“It hit me, Tony. You think that’s a good sign? It’s not good. I don’t hate technology, as you think I do, I just… I can tell when it’s doing more harm than good, it doesn’t take a genius or a technical practitioner to figure that out.”
Steve had his head turned to one side as the symbiote trailed over a small cut made by the glass. “It’s nothing, I assure you.”
“I know, I just don’t want the other police to catch up with us. Boy that feels strange to say… I’ve never really been the other side of the fence…” He scratched the back of his head, eyes on the small robotic dog working its magic until the door next to them unlocked with a loud beep, the small switch on it with the light flicking from red to green.
Tony’s sudden smirk of confidence began to fade as there were more blips on the radar, more red dots. “The Destroyer, Major Talbot, Black Swan, Whirlwind, Absorbing man, a hoard of Doombots… Why are all of these people coming together? Why now? This seems so… co-ordinated…”
“You’re not laying a finger on us!” Carol snapped, whilst Jessica fell quieter than she usually would be, her expression dropping at the previous reference of her Skrull queen counterpart.
Steve exhaled a sigh, his hand going for Tony’s shoulder and rubbing it in gratitude. Tony couldn’t help but lean into the touch, like a kitten being rubbed under the chin, he smiled even more broadly and handed the remote back to JARVIS. “You keep this safe, disable it completely, wires and all.” That was when he turned to MODOK. “Where are they?”
Tony blinked momentarily, his mind was clouded as it is and he didn’t need Steve speaking in enigmas to confuse him even more, “One of us? Avengers? Old man, are you losing your memory?” He asked, “Come on Capsicle… It’s way too late at night to go through this.” He said, his hand instantly moving toward his own forehead and rubbing it.
“I was discriminated against Steve,” Tony was hesitant to admit. He hated being the victim like that, but it was true and had been very evident in the park during their first mission. “But you… You stand up for me every time.”
“Good. Now then…let’s be off, Steve.” He began to lead the way. It took a moment for Steve’s legs to move, he was surprised, pleasantly so by the authority that Tony had in this dimension. “The world awaits our work…”
He saw his moments with the soldier; every time he had smiled, every time they had hugged or just brushed by. Steve was his life. He’d known that for a very long time. Even before he got a second chance at one.
Now it seemed like the small raindrops felt like waves, crashing over him and drowning him in the past and blood that would stain him forever. This was not how he was supposed to move on; he tried to keep his head held high in the very few public appearances he did make but the weight on his soul resonated throughout his eyes, even has he would smile there would be a glisten of sadness echoing throughout his presence alone.
Steve felt the body in his arms fall, Tony’s head lightly rest against his shoulder. The man rest in the warmth of Steve’s arms, gentle trickles of rain glistening through his hair. The Captain held him close, feeling the warmth disperse.
“What do I have to do to prove myself to you guys? Honestly now,” Things were starting to get more desperate on Tony’s end, mainly because he knew time was of the essence. “As for the labs and chemicals, the Peter I knew used to get whatever he needed however he could. Why haven’t you raided one of Oscorps labs yet? I’m sure they have a dozen; logic dictates that’s what all these building are, right? They hardly look like housing potential unless you’re into sterile environments.”
Cap narrowed his eyes, doing the same to the yellow and red wires that were on his side too – since there seemed to be double sets of wires which possibly meant two explosions rather than the earlier anticipated one.
The genius took that consent to analyse Steve’s arm and suit and see how the power regulation system was there, squinting at particular notches and wires but of course, he was a quick study. Crouching down over what he could, he compared it to his own system and with a lot of work had finally managed to get his reactor technology fully compatible with the new augmentations. Steve pushed himself up and watched Tony carefully, though it pained him that he had a giant gap in his memory. Whilst Tony was working on the suit he looked at his own hands, then at his legs. A pang rang through his heart, a dull ache in his chest as he felt it slump. What had he become? What had he turned into? The night before he didn’t have much time to linger within the thoughts that ran through his mind, with Tony quick to comfort him and ease his pain, but now he couldn’t help but dwell on the fact that he was missing large parts of his body. Not only that but he was now missing a huge chunk of his memory. He didn’t have time to dwell, not when he needed to know what was going on.
Tony’s heart was racing. He knew for well once they entered the streets they would be out in the open, but that was better than being cornered in the alleyway. They knew what they were doing, they knew how to survive in this world and he was just a newcomer, so he had no choice but to follow their lead. Carol dropped him, but allowed him to get to his feet before continuing with the others. He staggered at first, trying to put one foot in front of the other then pick up speed, which was proving difficult with that new leg of his that he had to keep adjusting to.
The sounds stopped, leaving Steve and Tony in the middle of the woodland area, surrounded by treats and chirping birds. Dazed and confused they both looked around them, trying to sniff to catch that scent again.
Tony yelled out, trying to call the other bots to his aid but also trying to deal with the pain of having had his bottom lip ripped off. He backed to a corner as Steve crawled closer, grabbing Tony and pinning him down with powerful strength before biting hard into his exposed neck.
Tony’s systems locked on to the large circle of metal that it detected and he pointed his boosters downward, holding out his hands to land perfectly on the dimming lights under his feet until they completely faded. This caused the sand beneath him to partially subside with the flusters of air that projected from the landing style. The winds also helped reveal something that was otherwise hidden by the sand, and eventually it all became crystal clear – there it was, a giant silver disk that was his door to finding his friend.
“Yes sir.” The voice replied over the radio. “According to this, he’s been taken to a SHIELD tech lab. No information on it so far.”
Steve continued to hold onto him, regardless. There was something comforting about it, not only for Steve but for Tony too, as they both cautiously stepped closer and closer to the doorway at the end of the hallway; it was clear where they were heading, the only door that had a light behind it. There were many doors but all of them seemed so stoic, so devoid of life, so there only seemed to be one option.  They had to run down the hallway, then down the stairs at the end of it, with Tony scooping Jarvis into his arms to carry him down while they made their way down. Tony hated walking down stairs, particularly if there were that many of them, so he grabbed Steve too, yanking him as he shouted;
Doom was becoming angrier and angrier by the second, and with that came more frantic blasts of lightening from his fingertips, Tony and Steve ducking from side to side, pulling one another to help evade the powerful beams coming right at them. As much as Tony wanted to shoot back, he needed to power up his repulsors before they could fire, and that power-up time couldn’t be achieved when he was dashing from place to place.
Tony yelped loudly. The sound echoed loudly through the hollow room, and Steve chased the noise through the hallways, crashing through the window, shield first. Only, it wasn’t a shield, it was a holo-shield, something that Tony had been working on in extreme secrecy (and by extreme secrecy it meant with the allowance of telling Pepper and Rhodey and showing off his handiwork).  Steve used it to pummel the living armour away with one swift motion. The shield was certainly strong, extremely so, which was exactly what he needed.
“You’re enjoying this..?” Steve asked, peering up through his long eyelashes, sharp features highlighted by the reactor glow.
He could see his armoured fingers touch the steel, finally getting a grip of it and using the planes speed to steady himself. Once he heaved himself onto the wing he ran, staggering from the movements of the vehicle to try and reach for the door, spring boarding off the wing toward the door. Either that, or he’d have to blast a hole into the plane to bring it down, but he’d rather not risk the lives of the crew on board. Even if they were some sort of cyber Nazi-police force. That reminded him to find out more about these people later – all he knew is that once heroes were caught they were never seen again, and that simply wasn’t good enough in terms of information. Tony was all about the details.
Then there was movement. He could see something under his eyes move before those surreal blue eyes stared back at him.
Steve stared at him for a moment before returning back to his position, trying to sleep as best as he could.
It was the first official day that all of them had moved in and their floors were furnished, and they had all managed to find time off to celebrate their new home.
When they’d reached the foot of the huge tower with Stark written on it, it all fell into place. Here Steve had thought that it was simply just a common name, given that he didn’t do much research into it. He wasn’t too into doing research about big businesses and companies when he was too focused on crime-busting. He actually cursed himself for not putting it together.
With a smooth movement, he set off, zooming ahead with subtle tilts to cut the wind resistance as Cap held onto him tightly. Steve’s head-wings were slicked back due to how fast they were going. Tony cut through the air with ease, finally reaching the tower with Janet following behind them.  She’d struggled to keep up by the reactor powered jet boots and thus resorted to clutching onto Tony’s toe when she managed to reach him.
Steve shrugged off the initial thought that arose in his mind that said ‘guy in a sock’ could’ve been Zemo. This was years later, and hopefully he was long gone. Then he was taken up to his room which at present was bare and white. Tony hadn’t exactly had time to prepare or decorate, considering that he didn’t even realise that Captain America was real yet alive until what was just a day ago.
The sheen of metal was what Steve got a glimpse of, before leaning closer to it, his second leg rising and arching just like the first. Aghast, his pupils constricted.
Tony quickly blushed bashfully (not that it could be seen in the dark dark room) and held up his other hand instead, “Oops! That’s breath spray, my bad.”  He pointed the correct finger toward the distance and cleared his throat, “Go go Stark laser spray!” This time when Tony sprayed it down the dark narrow hallway a number of bright red lasers became visible.
Tony couldn’t stand and watch Steve hold himself like that, he had to go, pulling back and taking huge quickly paced strides to his lab to get his suit off as quickly as possible. He was suffocating; he couldn’t breathe, not after
“Please Steve…” Tony pleaded. “Please, and I promise I’ll bring some extra food this time. Yesterday you went through what we brought you in two seconds flat, I’ll bring burgers, doughnuts, the works. Come on Cap, I know your sweet tooth… How about that apple pie huh?”
Every Avenger had their own floor built for them, their own living space for them to come back to after a long, exhausting mission.
It wasn’t too long until he finally approached the tall building that he had been searching for; the NYPD headquarters. It was as majestic as he had dreamed it would be. Huge steps lay before him up toward the massive mahogany doors that were clearly years old, two huge round lamps either side of the entrance with concrete sculptures holding them up. He had to stop for a moment just to stare and take it all in, his smile widening from ear to ear as he watched his new co-workers walk in and out through the doors that hardly had a chance to close properly before someone moved between them.
As much as he tried to adapt, there was a flaw with the powering system which was why he was using these chips. In the morning he’d try and find something to use to make some solar technology. A lot of hospitals were powered by solar technology when he had been caught in the initial explosion, so there was a thought in his mind that maybe, just maybe, there were scraps of some lying around which would make his job much easier. In truth, he was tired of using makeshift items; although it tested his ingenuity it also became tiresome and reminded him of the countless times where he’d had to act using what he had. It was nice to be tested now and then but this test seemed endless.  If something or somebody out there could cut him a little slack at least, it’d be appreciated.
Tony zoomed as quickly as he could to reach the man that appeared to be leaping down the street, jumping from streetlight to light, and swinging himself around to gain momentum then throwing himself to the next like some sort of circus performer. He was astoundingly acrobatic in his purple and yellow leotard.  It was up to Tony to weave through the lampposts and chase down the leaping Frenchman that was singing
Steve picked Tony up by the neck, squeezing the crimson armour tightly, staring down at him with a stare of stone. “All threats will be destroyed.”
“I don’t know Steve, that’s my honest answer.” Tony finally answered with a whine. “I don’t know, and we’re sitting here trying to figure it all out and none of us can come up with answers so far. So we’re bringing in Hank from Xavier’s school to help us on this, he has an expertise in mutations and would probably be able to tell us what’s going on in your system.”
“Tony how…” He stared at the arm that had previously been holding him. “…Did you… How did you make that? Your arm, it was completely gone when we were fighting.”
Then he could feel it again. As though he couldn’t fall further into the pit of despair, he could feel the world crumble beneath him, falling further and further into sadness and sorrow, regret and remorse.
“Yeah, and you know, we never did figure out who kept setting them off. It was a huge terrorist attack on a global scale.”
Tony glared up at the bot, feeling an intense sense of déjà vu, considering how it had acted toward Rumiko in the past. He wouldn’t and couldn’t let it happen again. “Stop!”
His eyes darted around the circuits as though reading a book, “They all have trackers. Well, at least yours does. And Carol’s augmentation did too.”
“Cap, look! Catch!” he said, throwing it at him to try and at least slow him down, though not throwing it hard enough to hurt him. Steve was smacked in the back before he had the time to turn around and he jolted in the air, spinning around and grabbing the shield, with a growl, placing it on his back.
In all honestly, they had no idea how they were standing. It was as though they were linked in mind, and soul, and now body. Their willpower had been shared between them, mounting a strong impenetrable defence, even from the Purple Man’s enhanced ability.
“You’ll be okay Steve, we’ll make it through this together.” Tony murmured, pressing his faceplate against Steve’s forehead to calm him down. He noticed Steve’s mouth opening as though he were taking breaths, but it was clear from earlier that he wasn’t really breathing so perhaps it was a reflex he was still conditioned with. He had to tell himself to stop over-analysing it all and just be grateful Steve was there with him.
Steve groaned a little in response. Tony realised then that he needed to cut the man down from his plank. Using his pinpoint lasers, he quickly seared through the chains and caught Steve in his arms, making sure his feet were free from the shackles too. He lifted Steve into his arms.
“Well, yeah, that’s what I did. That’s how I fixed myself up. Trust me, as soon as we get to my lab I’ll fix us up with better augmentations, I hate having part of Hammer compose me.”
Biology wasn’t his forte, but he would do anything to help his friends in need, particularly if that very friend was the man who he wanted to spend most of his time with. Most was an understatement, he wanted to spend the majority of his life with him.
Hammer chuckled in the background. “You know what we’re going to do to you, Tony? My buddy, my pal?”
. In that position he resembled a turtle placed on its back, struggling to get itself up again, grunting and flailing to no avail. JARVIS had managed to shut down all power to the chair, and had absorbed it – flashing a full battery logo in his optical display.  But JARVIS wasn’t quite done yet, he’d taken the green switch he and Steve had spotted earlier, a compartment in his back opening up and revealing the switch which he’d earlier swiped for securities sake.
“Basically, I’d do it myself but it’s harder to work on myself alone.” Tony elaborated, cutting Reed off before he went on a long winded rant. “Reed’s one of my best friends from my college days, we both did some doctorates together so there’s no one I’d trust more to work on me.”
“Blood transfusion, I made this handy dandy syringe to help speed up the process; you put this in your arm and just wait for a while and… It’s just injecting more of your own blood in your system to fight off whatever’s inside you. Your immune system boosted with a couple of vitamins should be able to fight it off.” He reached for Steve’s arm carefully but Steve found himself smacking Tony’s hand away.
Steve hadn’t slept either, much to Tony’s surprise, and yet his body showed no signs of fatigue. It was alarming to say the least but then again Steve’s serum granted him with increased stamina, so that would mean in theory it would’ve taken a lot to get him tired, and keeping in mind that they didn’t have a mission the day that Tony had taken in Steve again for the second scan, perhaps it was just the lack of strain that day that allowed Steve’s body to maintain its strength without needing rest.
Jessica and Carol stood side by side, hands on their hips in that typical power stance. Both of them looked as though they wanted to kill him—which wasn’t a new feeling to be quite frank.
There was a unified chuckle between the two, rubbing shoulders as they walked – their proximity being much closer than before. It was peaceful, despite the smoke around them, knowing for well they’d clean this city up like they’d done countless times before, just as soon as they found the rest of their team to help out. Together, they walked in tandem, turning around one of the many corners the city had with Steve until he spotted it—
Steve darted toward the needle and began to climb it, reaching the bomb and opening the panel right away so that Janet could fly into it. His azure eyes scanned the wires then he began to draw from his past knowledge to try and tug at the right one.
“You know, there was something I’ve always wanted to tell you. Since I’ve worked with the police you’re the only guy that’s been nice to me, you’re the only one that’s listened to me. I know I’m not the best detective in the world. After all, I’m the prototype, but you’ve seen past that. Other cops, well, they’ve been put off by not only me but the reaction that I’ve gotten too. As you can tell, cyborgs like me aren’t taken kindly to. People are afraid of what they don’t know and it takes a long time for people to accept change and evolution. Now I’m not saying that all detectives should be replaced by me but I’m a step forward. You strike me as a traditional guy…”
“Pep talks. They’re always useful, as long winded as they are.” Though Tony realised it was hardly a pep talk, it was that reassuring lock of eyes, that deep stare that echoed that Steve had the utmost faith in him.
“Yes, Captain. We have a unique system, and I’ve worked with him on his suits a number of times. You got what I said was in the vault?”
They both needed each other, they both had parts missing, they were both in dire need of being complete again and this affection was what Tony had been searching for. Steve needed it too, after waking up, trying to process everything himself.  It was as though their history together had led up to this moment, all of the battles, all of the arguments, and there they both were – in a rickety old hospital, trying to get back into full health.
Steve was excited to be working with a new partner, especially one that seemed eager to do some good. The first time he’d caught a glance of his new partner it was from outside, just as he was flying in he caught a glimpse of those pearly whites and perfectly ironed shirt and bright azures that may or may not have distracted him. It looked as though he were working with a human ‘Ken’ doll. Nonetheless, Tony just followed Steve’s instructions for the time being, observing, eager to correct the newbie when he spotted a hiccup, after all that would
He questioned how he ever called them friends when they’d treated him as they had. His future allies, his new friends, would have to be of a certain calibre if they were to stand at his side. Firstly, he needed someone that would be his confidant, who would take their place proudly and would be strong enough to crush anyone that opposed him. Of course, he’d wanted Pepper to stand by him, but she appeared to have other plans… she
It was unusual, and Steve had noticed that right off the bat when they had first started fighting in and amongst the streets of his home town, that Taskmaster seemed quiet. Even when Steve had offered him a better pay off, which under usual circumstances would be an easy way to fend Taskmaster off. He had known the mercenary for years, he had even had to work alongside him, but this fight seemed entirely different. Taskmaster’s moves were strangely predictable, his banter was completely absent and he seemed to throw himself toward Steve as though he were a drone.
Tony stared, wide eyed with awe. It was amazing that under that uniform such a powerful man was hiding away. He could clearly see Steve was strong but that smack in the face confirmed it; one of Batroc’s teeth had flown right out of his mouth.
“We just have tests to run, Captain. You know that Tony does not want this to last any longer than it should do, and is keen on getting us to assess the issues as soon as possible. It seems that you have been infected when you were captured. Quarantine shall be short, and as you know, it is to ensure that none of the others are at risk of getting this infection. You do understand, do you not Captain?”
Steve grabbed it and heaved himself up with Tony’s help, once they were by the range of pulleys, out in the open Tony looped his arm around Steve’s waist.
There wasn’t enough time. The eyelets of his helmet shattered into a spider web crack and alarms in his suit began to ring, the suit was compromised.  Just as he was about to speak, he was surrounded by flames, shrapnel, wires, a toxic orange coloured gas escaped and filled his lungs.
But he wondered if there was something more to this… The Purple Man wouldn’t exactly go for a repeat, he wasn’t that stupid. There must have been something more, especially since Taskmaster was under his control. He tried to touch on his communication device whilst he ducked back, trying to use another nearby machine for cover from Tony.
The way he moved was something that Tony couldn’t get out of his head, the way he stared with eyes that looked so dark set. Whenever Steve snapped and chattered his teeth, making deep guttural groans from the back of his throat, Tony would back away from the screen. For a man who couldn’t get his eyes off Steve at the start, now it hurt even more to turn his head and take that passing glance at the shadow of the man.
“I can’t do this!” He yelled. The emotions had suddenly become overwhelming and suffocating; there was no way, no matter how hard he tried that he could live up to those expectations. Steve was the man his father would always prattle on about, this was the very man that he had comics, posters and action figures of.
“Come on, Cap! This isn’t an ideal level to be on.” Tony gestured to what was surrounding him. What had once been a neat office was destroyed and covered in a thick black char with a huge crater in the centre of the room. Tony was on his way out when he was blasted to the side, slamming into a broken wall by the villain that they had thought was taken care of. Whirlwind stood, barely, in his battle-worn green armour.
“Oh god…!” Tony blurted out, placing his hands over the reactor and then falling on top of him, mourning the super soldier’s dependency on technology. Steve stood for the old fashioned American way, but now it was all stripped away from him, because of a single incident. Tony could feel Steve breathe in deeply, realising that after snapping out of it, that this must’ve been the first time that he too had seen what had happened to him. He’d lost his arms and legs, and the left side of his chest down to his abdomen was covered in a plate embedded into the remaining skin and of course, the reactor. He clenched his jaw tightly as Steve met his eyes again, giving him a brush along the nape of his neck with those cold, thin metal fingers.
“I was working on the circuits and I guess I triggered a knee jerk reaction out of it, it’s my fault.”
Walking out and shooting a glare at the crowd, he took heavy steps into the busy city. Though just like when he had first walked outside he saw that people were walking in packs rather than by themselves. They seemed to move in groups in a synchronised fashion and again crowded in front of televisions that were playing another presidential announcement. This time the screen was showing footage from the battle the night before; with Carol going berserk with the message ‘Superheroes go rogue, beware’ on a scrollbar underneath the video footage.
“Great, because I’m thirsty for a good pint and superhero tears.”  Boomerang snarled back, throwing his weapons to parry the shield away, throwing more toward the men.
The most he could hear was the scuttling of rats, pointing his lights in their direction to confirm his suspicion, and thankfully seeing the tips of their tails as they raced by, some escaping through the newly opened door.
“Don’t mention it, Shellhead.” Steve shot Tony a thumbs-up. “Everyone, keep moving forward! How’s Carol doing up there?” Steve held his hand to his ear piece; the short distance communication device that Tony had fashioned their old radios into given the electrical systems were disrupted by the storm that loomed above them.
“Don’t get too used to it.” Steve cautioned “Just this once. You know I have one or two exceptions, I’m not heartless.”
The command of Captain America could be heard anywhere and instantly managed to get all of the Avengers to their feet.
He made stiff steps toward Steve who looked like a regular sleeping beauty. His eyes were shut, his lips slightly parted, skin pale with messy golden hair over it. Tony’s hand trailed down to the armoured segment, which started around his abdomen area and extended down his legs and across his arms, then again at his neck, but that part where the chin piece was being held. Tony removed the upper segment first, so Steve was free to breathe easily and then moved toward the boots. If he could remove them then he could use some of his old Iron Patriot circuitry, if it was still intact, with his current suit to give it a small upgrade, reminding himself that Steve didn’t really need the armour. He was a super soldier; he’d be able to survive without armour weighing him down. That was always Steve’s excuse anyway whenever Tony suggested designing a suit for him.
Steve let out a low chuckle, gently pumping his hand along Tony’s length whilst Tony placed the palms of his hands on Steve’s chest, one on the metallic half, the other on his actual skin.
He couldn’t get it out of his mind that easily, especially when there was a sudden tense silence and Tony was pacing the place like a lion in a cage. As soon as they reached the work in progress that was the mansion.
Steve gently rubbed his cheek against Tony’s affectionately before pulling back to look into his eyes, hovering inches away from his face, “Please Tony… Just let me heal you…”
Steve knew that he was the only person that could silence Tony Stark, and he did so by pressing his lips against the mans, tugging him down for a deep, raw kiss as his tongue swept over the other man’s lips.
His hips lifted off the bed and ensured that he made full contact with Steve, sure by the reaction and reciprocation that the super soldier loved the feeling. And he did. Very much.
He took a sharp breath before sitting up and groaning loudly, feeling particularly old especially after he heard the crack in his spine when it straightened inside his suit, rummaged around the hospital room and pulled out some medical supplies. Luckily enough he found some aspirin, at least which would deal with the pain for now. Swallowing the chalky tablets and then coughing soon afterward, he pulled the box of medical supplies toward Steve and placed them on the floor.
Tony shuddered again and lay down on the bed, reaching for the machine that was next to him and lightly dusting it off. “Don’t remind me that someone’s under my bed.” He said, pulling it closer and turning it around to open the back panel that was on most machines at the time. There was an immediate sense of alleviation that befell him the moment that he’d spotted the Stark Industries brand hiding on the back panel, at least there was some remnant that his company had existed, even if it was in ruins.
“When I was a kid, my old man used to criticize everything I did, but one thing he would allow me to do that was somewhat childish was to collect these Cap comics. It was my first ever comic book, actually. I used to watch the cartoon too, I mean, come on… Who
The black, fluffy-coated feline nuzzled into the warmth of Steve’s arms, purring loudly with satisfaction when it nestled against his chest. Steve stared, wide-eyed, at the fluff-ball while it vibrated whilst purring, the older woman stepping up to Steve with her lace gloved hands covering her cherry red lipstick coated lips.
Sitting down there was like waiting in a bomb shelter, hearing the thunderous footsteps above them shift and move. Peter kept his eyes on the man hole cover, inching closer, though as Tony noticed him doing that he called the boy down. “Show me what you’ve had done…”
Peter!” Both of them screamed as their words were slowly drowned out by manic roars. Tony used the power in his boots, hovering up and grabbing Peter, then flying a little above him to cover the manhole. The boy squirmed in his grip.
Distinguishing between dreams and reality was always a struggle for superheroes of their calibre. Going from dimension to dimension in some cases often distorted the perception of reality and what was in their universe and what was in another. It was only the drops of rain that lodged Tony back into the realworld.
Steve looked down at the man, his head aching and the back of his neck sore, sending surges of pain through his entire body through his spine.
Each tube began to open, members of their team falling, some awakening upon the glass tubes opening. Peter, Bucky, Rhodey, Pepper, Strange, T’Challa all stepped out, regaining their footing and breathing in the thick air. Norman backed up against the wall, eyes widened in horror as each and every one of the team loomed up to him.
“Yeah, good idea.” Tony waved a little too eagerly, running to the car and almost tripping again over that last step, but Steve ducked down instinctively and caught Tony.
The journey was awkward, and Tony kept taking glances at Steve, opening his mouth as though he wanted to say something before stopping, doubting himself, internally reeling over the how Captain America sitting there was enough to shut him up.
Arc reactor technology was powerful; it was a generator on its own powered and created as an adaptation upon the theory of cold fusion but without the nuclear aspect. Although he had attempted to rewire it to his new augmentations the integration wasn’t entirely successful. He had to keep in mind that this was different technology, this was a new generation that he was mostly unfamiliar with since it was well… The future.
The gunshot echoed, making the birds flutter around with alarm. Tony growled and pawed at Steve, as though telling him to get up. He let out a shrill screech and turned, powering up the unibeam in his chest again, distraught. The sound began to get louder while he charged up, trying to figure out how he had managed to shoot it in the first place, the memory escaping him entirely. He was like a child with a toy that he didn’t know how to use, an angry child that just wanted his toy to work.
. It was one of the words that people used too often whenever there was anything that they needed to poke and prod. He scowled at it, rolling his jaw – mimicking Steve’s action of frustration. “Sedation until we find a cure entirely, it may help with his outbursts of rage. He doesn’t sleep, so perhaps easing the irritation of unrest…” Hank proposed.
Steve smiles at Tony’s eagerness. The man was always more keen to give out gifts than to receive them when it came down to it.
“Interference shall not be tolerated,” he replied, this time readying his repulsor toward Tony. Even when he was behaving like this, it didn’t stop Tony from having some sort of faith that Steve was really there and not just in a physical form.
He knew these machines inside out, after all; he had a larger input with the design than he would ever admit to. Everyone called him a weapons monger but they all forgot his advancement in medical technology that was down to him.
There was fire in his eyes; a deep passion to protect that gave him the strength to push harder. It was as though he could see every small movement and twitch of Doom’s eyes, he could hear him snarling under the mask, all whilst Tony dismantled the bot for its power source and began to drain it, as quickly as he could, unravelling wires from the inside of his jacket and plugging them into the battery.
Steve craned his head back a little to catch a glimpse of Tony, holding him so securely with that stare of determination facing forward, it was truly a sight. But he didn’t have much time to admire it, not when he got to his feet.
“We’re going to meet the others in Central Park, well, those who have radio contact,” he explained before Tony shoved the bar of food in front of him. Without so much as glancing up at Tony to question it, he bit down on the half chewed bar, needing the food more than he thought he did.
“You mean you’re screwing with his mind.” That much was clear. Wires around the brain, screens, neuro-schematics flashing up on the charts. “You missed the news; Fury’s not running this joint anymore.” He took a moment, putting on that face that he had dropped, fierce, sturdy, his iron mask. “You’re dismissed.”
When Tony’s reactor began to stabilise instead of flicker, Steve pulled the wire out and took a deep inhalation of breath, carding his own gauntlet covered hand over his hair and pulling out the chin piece so he could move his mouth properly.
“He’s not saying a word and we’ve run tests in his lab. Marc was kind enough to provide us with some samples, but nothing has given us any clues as to what we’re facing. Zola is extremely unpredictable, his usual creations aren’t viral like this, nor do they contain possible contagions. Hanks taken the samples that we’ve gotten back to his lab too, and right now nothing has come back, no results at all, we simply don’t know what we’re facing here.”
Steve’s honesty was a trait Tony admired but one that made him purr, especially when it echoed with such confidence. Needless to say, it was Steve’s confidence that Tony not only admired, it also was a turn on.
“Psionic blasts, according to the particle traces left around the lab. It’s a temporary effect, they’ll be just fine. They can all repair themselves…”
Before Carol had time to speak, Jessica dashed by and grabbed her, knocking her to the ground and out of the way of the missile that shot into the space that Carol once stood in, Danny and Luke both running back as far as they could.
Hank then took a moment to reply, his nails tugging at a tuft of blue fur from his chin. “Now we find a cure, perform a couple of MRI’s and so on, so forth.”
Osborn’s eyes shot open, taking a few steps back and trying to activate his emergency systems, trying to call upon his other weapons, but it was too late. Steve leaned his shoulders back, pushed his chest forward and shot a unibeam with all of his might, letting out a mighty bellow, a scream of pure pain, sending Norman thudding back into the wall behind him, charred and burned. The smell of burning hair and singed clothes enveloped the room, but all that ran through Steve’s mind, was that beautiful scent of watermelon and cherries; Tony’s scent.
“Uh… Well, that tablet has a pull out stylus which acts like a pen.” He demonstrated, pulling from the tiny tab at the corner of the tab and pulling out the long stylus. “And the tablet acts like paper so… Knock yourself out.” He smiled reassuringly. “Robes and all are in the bathroom already and we’ll get you fitted up for clothes tomorrow too… Have a good rest, Steve; I’ll see you in the morning.”
“We’ve induced him into more than just the regular sedation, it should last a couple of days, if not a week.”
As he managed to push past the smoke and remaining flames he saw Tony standing there in a room full of now broken and destroyed Captain America memorabilia, quickly Tony grabbed something which he crumpled and shoved into his pocket before dashing out and grabbing Steve’s shoulders. “Cap, you need to… You need to get to the lab, I have something to do here- go, quickly, you know my password!”
“Yes?” Tony asked, tilting his head up slightly to look at Steve, arching his eyebrow. Of course he’d catch Steve out on his initial answer.
It was clear even from Steve’s point of view that JARVIS was having difficulty, so he did what he did best. Steve was famed for his strength, something he hadn’t really displayed since he had started working with the police in New York City, so he ran up to MODOK – since it wasn’t a projectile it wasn’t stopped by the barrier, so he ran through and grabbed MODOK’s chair as best he good; giving JARVIS the perfect opportunity to plug his wire right in.
Steve decides to have the apple pie flavoured hot chocolate, as expected. Tony on the other hand picks the black forest cake hot chocolate rather than coffee, which is a drastic change considering that caffeine at this point ran through his veins. Nonetheless, he was keen to try something new. Contently they sat down, and Steve decided to change the topic of focus onto what he had bought for everyone.
She frowned in return then stepped up to him, throwing her arms around him in a tight embrace, her eyes shut with such relief that this was the man that she had trusted so long ago. Tony smiled with relief too, patting her back, careful not to stain her costume with more blood.
“Now you mention it, it did seem violent, but I figured that was just because Masters used to work for Bain… And they had a history, didn’t they?”
He screamed out, kicking himself back and falling back, clutching his face. His lips were bleeding and torn and Steve had blood stains all over his mouth, slowly rolling off the table to all fours before crawling over to Tony, reaching out for him.
An incredulous yell escaped Steve’s mouth as the man tried to kick Tony away and maintain flight, though luckily enough Tony was clinging onto him like a sloth, so he didn’t have to do the same. Apologising profusely internally, he managed to dig into the super soldiers skin and try and feel around for the same chip. Surprise surprise, there was a panel he could feel. His eyes widened with triumph.
Steve reached for the dark haired man, gently tugging him into his arms and raising him up. There was that brightness again, the wings of the Captain spread around him. Tony’s eyes drifted to his own foot that rest on the bed, only to see that it had completely healed. There wasn’t a drop of a blood, not a single trace that there had ever been a wound in the first place.
Steve shook his head, pulling out his shield. It had been a long time, a very long time, and it felt good to hold her again. He had to stop his hand from smoothing over the slicked star spangled surface.  “Drop the accent pal, I can see right through it.”
When they walked into the huge building Tony guided Steve over to the elevator and he took off his hat, threading his fingers through his hair and smiling proudly at Steve.
want to hear about any further developments in terms of Steve’s status. Yes, he’d keep an eye on him…but now the changes were too obvious. The Steve in confinement was clearly becoming a different Steve…a different sort of Steve than the one Tony’s heard yearned to have back.  The day after the attack, Tony had watched when Reed allowed food to enter the room. Steve had lunged at it and tore it apart with his teeth, as though it were a living animal. The hunter’s instincts were taking hold; Reed was fascinated by the way that Steve acted and how much it contrasted with his regular behaviour.
Deeper they went, and both of them could feel each other drowning in ecstasy. Mid moan Tony was cut off by a passionate kiss, although Steve loved to hear him cry out his name, he also loved to know that he knew exactly how to shut him up.
“That doesn’t look fishy at all,” Clint remarked as they stood at the foot of the ominously tall building.
place, his mind was telling him that he needed to eat. Now, Tony was so beaten down and mentally exhausted that he found himself unable to power on with the words of hope and optimism to keep fighting. In fact, that had strangely increased his respect for Steve, his being able to deliver words of hope in the darkest situations. As much as Tony had taken those for granted, now he realised how difficult it was to fill Steve’s shoes. Despite the horror that Steve’s waking moments had become…Tony still loved him.
“Go ahead.” Tony said, stretching his body over Steve’s, feeling his muscles through the torn garb, his fingertips curling around the base of the fabric and looking up to get that stare of consent. With that he lifted the shirt over the man’s arms, being careful not to catch them on the metal hinges that were now in place of his knuckle.
There was the gentle hum of Christmas music in the background, the crackle of fire, the sizzle of the turkey. As opposed to Tony’s rather sleek way of setting things out, this seemed cosy and warm… It felt like a home.
Those were words Tony had been dying to hear for years, and he would certainly cherish them for years to come.
Filled with a burning conviction he stared at Steve, deep in the eyes, narrowing his own. He could hear the ringing of his heartbeat, together with the rain creating a melody. He didn’t want to fight Steve, not at all. He wanted to save him and he would make damn well sure that he did.
For that second, Tony’s heart stopped and the bottle seemed to drift further from his lips that were puckered, ready to soak up the nectar that would soothe his woes.
He made his way out, with Tony waving at some of the other cops on the way, only to get either half waves or no response at all. It was sad, to be honest, especially from Steve’s perspective. Whoever this detective was, he had a heck of a reputation. Only Carol, Jessica, and the guy who’d chucked them the keys actually made an effort to acknowledge him.
Tony swivelled around, expecting to see yet another hoard of berserkers but seeing something quite different, something that made his heart stop for that very second.
, Stark, is that this toxic gas that couldn’t be contained and it was attacking the nervous system. It’s stopping the body from functioning, taking down organs one by one. It starts with muscles and then it spreads to organs. You’re lucky; that arc reactor alongside the Extremis serum of yours seems to have stopped it when it tried to attack your heart, by the signs of it. The two work in tandem, which is strange. You now need both to be alive…in a way doesn’t that negate the effect of Extremis. Though, that’s not important right now. All we know is after your coma you got it back into you.
“Lucky charm of Tony Stark,” he said, squatting down on the floor and pulling his mask back over his face.
The screens were showing how the virus was attacking and changing the blood cells, draining them of all the oxygen and then forcing out the unnecessary toxins which explained why Steve vomited up the strange liquid.
“You’re telling me,” Tony said, “There’s bound to be somewhere. These look like houses, what used to be apartments.” He said, pointing to a row of fallen buildings.
The Supreme Leader wasn’t about to be taken down that easily, he spun Tony around and gave him a just as equal beating. He swiped his slickly dressed forearm over his mouth, drying the miniscule blood spill from his split lip.
He waved his hand, his mouth preoccupied by guzzling down the black liquid. Steve could do nothing at that point but raise his eyebrow questioningly.
“I can show you the world~” Tony chimed. Steve just stared, confused as to why the man had suddenly seemed to burst out into song. The director tried to shrug it off and laugh, imagining what Steve’s reaction to the wonderful world of Disney would be. He made a mental note to take him to Disney world.
The dark haired man trailed his fingers along Steve’s back, past the scratches he’d made, leaning over to give him a kiss along it. He was absolutely exhausted, but gave Steve’s neck a rough suck just for a second to give him a marking of his own; after all, he was sure that his entire body would be covered with bruises of passion the next morning, brushing the strands of sweat drenched hair that were matted to Steve’s temple away, being rather tender himself.
going through these check-up procedures after every mission. “—He seemed completely fine, and has been for the last couple days.”
When they stepped out of the last gallery for the night Steve pushed his hair back, embracing the wonderfully peaceful night. “Thank you Tony, this has probably been one of the best days of my life, actually. Knowing that the city is safe and well… Spending time with you.”
Danny shrugged, positioning his legs in a stance ready to dash and evade whatever the bot was about to throw at them, “Well, it keeps shouting about doom and gloom, and it’s a robot… Maybe we should call it… A Doombot?”
The engineer kept glancing at the alleys to see if there were any more potential allies hiding in there as he carried Steve, staggering a couple of times and then quickly trying to regain his balance as the man’s feet dragged on the floor. The scrape of metal against concrete made a sound that made Tony cringe, but he carried on nonetheless.
Steve tried to be a little lighter, but when he felt Tony flinch again he looked up at him with a stern leer.
The blasts shot by, one skimmed his cheek and another braised his uniform. Steve wasn’t running away from Tony as it appeared, he was running toward the puppeteers and trying to lure Tony there with him. Steve used the same skill he had done earlier; grabbing one of the nearby bars and using it to raise his body and climb over one of the functioning machines. The vibrations under his feet were constant, especially with the production line churning out what he could only guess were robot shells. Tony was relentless and not far behind; it took a matter of moments for him to power up the thrusters in his boots and leap up to reach for Steve’s leg with his one good arm, but the Captain was a slippery man to catch. He jumped up toward a hanging bar from one of the machines on the second floor and used it to pull himself up, but Tony managed to grab Steve’s leg and dragged him back down.
“Please, Reed, for once listen to me. I know you and the others have had your ideas and I’ve been going with it, but I can’t sit here and watch him suffer. We’re keeping him here and giving him food shouldn’t be harmful, it looks like it’s helping him. You must have heard that phrase- feed a cold starve a fever? Maybe he’s got a cold, let’s just go with that.”
Another night without sleep, as promised, this was the second day without sleep and his vision was getting a little hazier but thanks to constantly topping himself up with caffeine he was a little more alert than he would’ve been without it. He overlooked the blood formulating meticulously with his eyes returning to Steve every so often, not wanting to tear them away from the man who seemed so saddened by being placed in that room and made to sit there alone. From time to time he would try and speak to him via intercom, but Steve would reply with shortened answers which only made Tony more determined to get him out of there; he couldn’t sit there and watch the beacon of hope fizzle into a broken man.
“Steve, stay back!” Tony yelled, his boots lighting up on command and soaring toward Victor as quickly as he could, dodging the continuous blasts that were being sent his way.
Tony raised his hips, rubbing his rear against Steve’s hips in a soft grinding motion. He was going with it, he’d never done this but he needed to feel him, he needed to
Then it was a trip home, with Tony being eager to show Steve more this time, and take his turn being the beacon of knowledge. He knew he could, especially when it came to progress and evolution. He was keen to do so, and when they had reached the metropolis better known as New York City, hidden amongst the concrete jungle was the American museum of National History which was absolutely perfect to show Steve. Once more he paid to get inside, and it was considerably late in the evening but that wouldn’t matter. He was still a little jetlagged from his journey overseas, and Steve wasn’t showing any signs of fatigue. So in they went, running rampant through the museum as though they were two teenagers that had just managed to sneak past the guard. Steve felt his defence lower the more he spent with the man, and it was a good feeling, as though he were talking to an actual friend that he had known for years.
The super soldier ran at full speed, barging him with immense amounts of Herculean strength “Get your hands off him!”
The room was clear, empty, just with that beeping from the machinery echoing, and the faint buzzing from the screens. Tony’s vision sauntered toward them to see the images of what he could only deem to be Steve’s memories. The olden setting, the peaceful atmosphere, it just seemed like a regular day in New York in the 1950’s – not the 40’s. He could get lost in it, it was like watching a TV show where everything was happy go lucky, and was half expecting canned laugher to drum out from the speakers. Snapping himself out of it, he looked around for the medical files, picking one up and skimming through the papers.
There was a sudden loud THUD from outside and both Fury and Steve turned simultaneously to stare at the back of what looked to be a man in a trench coat smacking against the window, turning and waving with an embarrassed grin across his features before tapping at the window with his red gauntlet covered hand – come to think of it, at first glance Steve could have easily mistaken those gauntlets for red and gold gloves if he hadn’t noticed the light in the centre of them and the loud tap that they’d made when he touched the glass.
“Implanting these chips in our heads and making us slaves; a price for you saving us…” Rhodey added with fury in his voice.
Steve returned to brushing himself off, his hands sticky from the strange fluid as the bubbles started to disappear. “You okay there, detective?”
Nerves overwhelmed him as he stood before the final door, but with Steve by his side he felt invincible.
“Post-traumatic stress. I’m sure it was.” Tony placed his hand on Steve’s shoulder. “It’ll be okay big guy; we’ll get you into therapy. If anything happens, you can call on me and I’ll be there in a blink of an eye. Well, I’d be there quicker if we’d managed to perfect teleportation. We have a good basis for it, but it’s not perfect.”
He kept his arms around Steve, but his shoes folded over, the cloaking device fading as they phased into his regular red and gold boots and he whispered; “go go Stark jet boots…”
Tony realised he’d had to explain it all from scratch, and he wasn’t half as good at explaining this sort as Reed was. “There’s… Your body… And well…” He was already fumbling over his own words, so he took a moment to try and compose himself; reaching for his yellow mug once more and taking a huge sip from it. Steve could see the flash of yellow even with the glare from the light above him that obscured his vision of the other side a little, realising that it was Tony’s favourite mug – one that he had gotten him when they had visited Paris together; a yellow mug with a black cat sitting in an red square, a tribute to the ‘chat noir’. His eyes were drawn toward it and Tony could see that. Even when he drew his lips away from the mugs rim he found himself staring at it with nostalgia. Tony had to clear his throat to snap himself away from the wonderful memory of spending such a wonderful time with Steve in Paris.
“Y-yeah! Fine, Rogers! Nab him up, will ya!” Tony could hear the sirens from afar approaching, remembering that it must have been the actual team that was dispatched to deal with the leaper finally arriving.
“Go go Stark fire extinguisher!”  The outer side of Tony’s calf seemed to fold back, the soft trouser material suddenly appearing hard and rigid like metal before it pushed out a bright, small compact tube which he stooped down to pick up, trying to hold it over his shoulder and attempted to spray the foam behind him.
Iron Man did as instructed, pulling Steve into his into his one good arm in a surprisingly firm grip, feeling him squirm and wriggle around trying to free himself but the tight shards of metal jutting into him constricted his every move. At least this would save him time; Steve was definitely not down and out for the count.
Then he noticed something fly past him, dodging the boomerang and then punching the guy square in the jaw.  He continued to hold the man, reaching to tie up his hands in one of the cuffs that was latched on his belt when-
Tony made his way toward the lab where the device that Reed had acquired and enhanced, the device Tony was eager to get his hands on, which wasn’t a particularly difficult task. As he stepped past, each camera flickered and shut itself down. A whimsical smile crossed his face.
“I need to feel you.” He said, raising his tone an octave, biting down hard onto Tony’s skin but not breaking it, very close to. “Tony.”
“Let me look after you this time, Tony, you’ve done enough for me. You brought me here, you kept me safe… I vaguely remember something with Crossbones…”
Before he knew it, Steve was busy trying to straighten out the metal wire, and did so with ease. He was surprisingly nimble, for someone of his muscular stature. Tony stared at him with surprise, his mouth hanging slightly open while Steve helped him, feeling how Steve comfortably placed it back on his head.
“I’m sorry.” Steve muttered before he lifted Tony up and pulled him into his arms into a tight embrace.  “You idiot, Tony...! Don’t you dare do that ever again!”
Peter paused and shrugged. “Maybe. Either way, because of it we’re all dependent on these chips in our brain to breathe.”
“Not a clone. Not a Skrull. Not any sort of alien race that’s been discovered since my ‘death.” Just me.” Tony arched his back, trying to brush a spinal mechanism segment against the wall for the liquid nitrogen release he had stored for another attack. It wasn’t flashy, and it was something he’d applied to his classic suits too – but never particularly used.
“Cap… Steve…” He walked up to him. “Fury said you were suffering from shellshock, that’s what you called it right? Nowadays, we call it something else… We call it Post Traumatic Stress… Now there are different ways to deal with it but we can get through this. Therapy is a big one and… Most people go through it, and it helps.” He’d even created a system for himself to vent his frustrations and act as a therapist of sorts, since he was never one to actually confess his problems to people. AI couldn’t judge him. “We’ll get you started right away.”
Tony darted toward the computers with Steve covering him, performing a visual sweep of the room as he stood close behind the other man, keeping a hand reassuringly on his armoured shoulder to let him know he was still there.
Tony quickly staggered back and away from the screen while Steve looked up at him, sorrowfully, eyes full of pain and guilt for even so much as admitting such a thing. “I don’t want to listen to it, I’m trying not to, I’m fighting it, for you.”
“We’ll give the kid a peaceful death, one that’ll let Steve recover properly. From what my father told me, Barnes was K.I.A on a rocket, a premature death, after invading a HYDRA base. We can at least give Rogers some solace if there’s a better way.” Even the fiercest of soldiers had sympathy for their brethren, and Fury was no different.
“Do what you can, Tony.” Steve replied as he stepped up to him and placed a firm hand on his shoulder, meeting his eyes with that confidence restoring stare.
“Tony.” There it was, that stern voice that would make Tony clear his throat and straighten his posture in a snap, but instead of straightening himself up he just leaned closer to Steve and pouted.
He knew Norman was the brains behind the systems, but whether he was truly in charge was another thing he needed confirming. Tony prayed internally that the government had just changed hands. He could deal with politicians, but not mad scientists.
It was as though Fury sought some sort of escape from the situation, glancing over toward Steve who shrugged and pointed back to Tony. “He saved the city, Chief.”
Tony wanted to think that throughout the ordeal his courage would never waver, and that he would remain strong and sturdy as a force of dependability. As the condition of his beloved worsened, so did his courageous heart… Sometimes Tony contemplated things; dark things. Sometimes he thought of holding a repulsor to his head and firing it and wishing that this would all be over – every day he endured of this agony was pushing him further and further to the edge.
Tony could see stars flying above his head, eyes rolling around, dazed from the fall. In fact, Tony was so dazed that even Steve could see those stars. At first he wondered if he was seeing things but then realised that there were little lights on the rim of the fedora that were projecting stars flying above him, just like a cartoon. Again, Steve had to stare for a second before brushing them away and grabbing Tony’s gloved hand and picking him up with a heave.
“So Reed and I were lab partners, working on a project as we’d volunteered to do so for the NYPD, while at the same time I was working on getting qualifications to become a trained detective, which were pretty easily obtained. You see, back in high school we had an acquaintance, a fellow scientist by the name of Victor Von Doom. Turns out the guy was sort of a big deal who ended up becoming the ruler of Latveria, that place in the middle of nowhere. Anyway, back in school he was that creepy guy that thought he knew everything and sort of hated us. Years go by and he’s some rich prince sort of fellow also aiming to pioneer in robotics. Thing is, he didn’t want to share his work with us and of course, we didn’t want to share with him. He and Reed go way back, but again that’s none of my business. Victor always had this darker side to his work anyway, he never wanted peace, it seemed to us like all he wanted was to create robots to destroy things rather than protect things. So we had to keep our work as far away from him as possible, even if he and Reed shared a working relationship beforehand.
“There’s no use fighting, Stark.” Norman said once more. “I could’ve had you alive, but you choose death.”
She looked like she wanted to say more, but the look Carol was giving her seemed to deter her, “Don’t scare him.” Carol simply put, her hand resting on her hip to give her that pose typical of those with power.
It didn’t take long for Tony Stark to breach the Baxter Building's security systems. There was only one device in this world that could give him what he wanted and it was located hidden in the dark depths and confinement of Reeds lab, right in the heart of the city just waiting for his genius to trigger it’s true potential. He and Reed had been on the same side, particularly in recent days, and with the close alliance that they had shared during the course of the incursions, some might have argued that Reed Richards was one of his closest ‘friends’ through that ordeal. Support systems were considered rather important; hence the Illuminati had one another to depend on.
Anyway, after his visit and return home, he was a little tired – not exhausted, but ready to fall into bed. His mattresses were rather hard, used to the rigid feeling of his own bunks, modern mattresses provided little to no lumbar support for the larger framed super soldier.
The bot laughed once more before Tony stepped in wearing one of his spare suits, it was one of his originals, golden stretched material along his arms and legs with a clunky thick looking chest plate and gloves, it certainly didn’t look like any of the other models Steve had seen him wearing or working on, he could even see his bright blue orbs under the eye slits.
“Hey! I’m offended! I do go down there from time to time… To supervise. I’m fussy; I need my underwear to be super soft. I have sensitive skin!”
Gazing above him and catching the dark hollow eyes, Steve stepped forward, closer to Tony and picked him up, raising his hand and punching through the already dented armour until he could feel the weak crack in Tony’s body. Tony wretched in pain, screaming out with a voice hoarse and strained, trying his hardest to keep his eyes open to meet Steve’s, his tear ducts brimming with crystal tears.
“At the time I had to upload my consciousness into the programming, after a very long story which I may save for another rainy day, but it’s become extremely smart because of that. It went sentient for a while…” Tony shuddered at the memory “Made some mistakes,” An understatement “But I managed to recover it. I had a battle with it, buried it on an island but it returned with a new AI, and like hell I’d have something else roaming around in one of my suits. I managed to get the AI (Dimitrios) removed and now I’m working on reprogramming it since its body has been largely restored. But as you can see it’s all chained up right now, still working on the internal programming.”
Panic stricken Tony had no choice, he had to grab his arms and yank him away, trying to throw him back but not with the extreme force he would usually use. He pushed and winced, trying to get Steve off before giving him that very shove and darting toward the door.
Tony powered up his repulsors, knowing that he had limited use since he needed to regulate power into his augmentations to keep them running. He took a quick dive to the right, keeping his palms held upward as he spotted the glider swerve, facing the moving figure even though it was hard to see, especially with his eyes tearing up.
Peter stood in front of Carol, trying to pick her up again as the woman writhed and punched through the webbing, punching past the boy and up into the sky, her eyes glowing a bright red.
Jan sighed deeply once she took in the concentrated look on Tony’s face, knowing that it was never a good sign of what was to come. Tony was a man who would laugh and joke, so the moment that he was serious, she knew that there was a real threat to deal with. “It looks like a storm’s brewing outside, either that or Galactus is on his way again…”
At first Steve was baffled, but he saw the humor in it, after all, no one was getting severely hurt or injured and all the gumballs did was prove as another distraction for the police, yet that didn’t stop them. There appeared to be two more cars following them, catching up quickly.
An old man peered out of a window of the old, beaten down set of apartments they were parked outside. Steve lived in the heart of Brooklyn which wasn’t exactly the nicest of areas. Tony wasn’t used to it, that was for sure. He shook his fist at the honking car and yelled.
“I’ll let you go first when you stop using words like ‘Stinky-town’ as descriptions,” Tony said with a smile as he slowly climbed each inclined rung, eventually reaching the metal plate and pushing it open.
“Yeah, soft, you’ll have to show me the secret to that when we get back. For now, let’s focus on finding the others, shall we?”
“Shut up…!” Tony cried out, but with an upward flick of the corner of his lips, staring down at Steve who decided to slither back up Tony’s body and kiss him lovingly, sustaining the movements, hearing Tony’s moans in his mouth even as he kissed him.
“Where’s the fun in that, Cap?” A cheeky grin followed, but Steve couldn’t really see it, not when he was so focused on trying to get the bomb defused.
Tony eased lower, his body cringing but then relaxing to accommodate Steve, once he was fully rested inside him he dared to open his eyes, looking down at the man who he loved so much, so dearly for so many years.
Tony pressed his boot to the door, kicking it down with Steve just behind him holding his fists up, JARVIS poking his head in and barking protectively.
After a while of simply being next to each other, with Steve kissing the back of Tony’s hand, taking in his scent and the warmth of his body they drifted into a well-earned rest; Tony hoping that his own serum, Extremis, would heal some of his injuries over night, but at that time his injuries weren’t his worries. He was in the arms of his hero and that was all that mattered.
Upon thinking about it, Steve decided that it was worse looking than a potato, much worse, actually. It looked like a prune with its crinkled skin and oval-like body, its eyes were small and beady yet its mouth was huge and filled with crooked, jagged teeth that shot every-which-way. His voice sounded like a cat when it was being brushed the wrong way; a wrangled screech of a tone.
Reed sighed, his elongated fingers tapping at his temple as a force of habit, the other hand spread and held up by his shoulder with disbelief at what he was hearing. “Tony, is your mind going too? It’s a
“You know why I care for him?!” He panted a little, his two back teeth grinding together as they clenched. “Because he makes me feel human!”
Zemo was stood proud and tall in the observation deck, laughing as he leaned forward to press on the comm.
“Tony, just… Just look at me please, I’m serious here.” He said, placing his hand under Tony’s chin to turn it. They were used to this sort of contact and were beyond chummy when it came to their gestures of ‘friendship’, constantly hugging, patting each other on the back, even holding onto each other and carrying one another.
Steve couldn’t talk anyway, not when he was too busy trying to run from Tony, who came zooming in from around the corner relentlessly firing his repulsors. He had no choice but to fight him, his eyes performing an ever so quick sweep of the room first before dashing to one side and ensuring that his shield was in front of him, covering him as a powerful cyan beam was shot his way. Steve was playing a game of duck and dodge since he knew for a fact Tony would snap out of it inevitably.
“Now you…” Tony said once he was free to stretch his legs, brushing one foot against the other to skilfully kick off his socks.
“Sir, Mr Stark, with all due respect, he won’t survive in this world! We’ve put him under rigorous testing, every scenario results in him having a mental breakdown and his inability to adapt-“
Norman turned sharply, stepping on Tony’s hand until there was a loud crunching sound, feeling the finger callipers snap. He screamed out again, gargling the blood that rested in the back of his throat, having to spit it out before he choked on it.
Steve’s handwriting was always much neater than he’d ever imagined. Each letter had an italic slant and cursive lettering, which shocked him at first, but now he just sat back and enjoyed it. The Captain was a natural artist and he managed to reflect that in every way.
Everything was neatly in a bundle as he took his first steps into the barren land that was once his city. It was a sight for sore eyes, that was for sure. The more he walked, the more his heart sank. It seemed empty, but then came the crowd of people over where Central Park used to be. All staring in unison at a huge screen with Norman Osborn talking about the upgrades to the chip, or new possible augmentations that people could buy. The guy was selling augmentations like it was Botox. As though it was the next best thing to have a limb hacked off and replaced with a cybernetic arm or leg.
Reed struggled, his entire body feeling fatigued from the zap, making out those eyes that were behind that daunting metal mask that leered down at him with such hatred.
To avoid the spotlights, Tony ducked into an alleyway and pressed his back against the cold brick wall. Sure he knew that he needed to advance and he’d had enough rest, it was just a case of analysing the search patterns of the lights and coordinating his movements accordingly. It was like playing that school yard game where the person would turn around and you’d try and get as close as you could before they turned around again. Not that he’d played in any school yard, being alternately homeschooled and sent to boarding school before college, but it was a game he’d read about. Now it was his turn to try.
His eyes went to Steve, then away, then back to him. “Fine! Yes, it’s filled with your things. But not your things, per say… They were collectables. My father started this, okay? It wasn’t like a huge room though. It was smaller, a little collection of things that he treasured and there were tonnes of Cap memorabilia, so I decided to carry that on and… It sort of went out of control.” Tony’s free hand scrubbed through the back of his hair, flicking his head to get the two strands of hair that would always fall in front of his eyes away.  “I still… Collect some things… Maybe.”
“Steve!” Tony yelled. “Steve, snap out of it, what’s wrong?” He asked with a slur of fatigue. He used extremis to command his bots to start repairing the screen while he was there, knowing for well that he couldn’t risk spreading the contagion that was infecting Steve in such a dramatic way.
Now with all of this information gathered, he was sure that the tower he was going toward was the centre of all of the activity and that would be exactly where he was headed.
“That was a close one!” Steve shouted over the flames, pulling Tony out from the exit he had made. Tony followed, hand grasping Steve’s tightly as they took to leaving the mansion.
“I’ll get them for you, I’ll be right back…” Tony darted out of the room but mainly to get fresh air for himself. Once he was outside he took a deep breath and found his back hitting against the wall of the hallway, placing his face in his hands and scrubbing them down his face. His breath hitched and he actually felt sick, but he had to reassure himself that once Hank was here that it would be better, that it would get better.
“Day one. You wouldn’t believe what I found today… Get ready for it. Captain America. The actual, Captain America…!”
Tony just laid there, eyes shut, even though his reactor was glowing. The Captain’s eyes were still filled with worry and he lifted the chest plate off him, pressing on his chest to get nothing in return. His heart was racing so quickly he was sure he could hear the rhythm in his ears.
Tony looked at him sharply to hide how much that truly pained him. He wanted to reply with every bone in his body, but deep inside he knew that this was just a venomous retort fuelled by the death of a friend. This is how Peter grieved; he grieved with pain and darkness. He turned with Jessica’s limp body in his arms, trying to find somewhere for it. There was no point answering Peter, it’d only heat the situation up further.
His fingertips were close to touching his eyes, but instead delicately brushed past his beautifully fanned out eyelashes. Then his eyes caught those lips, those perfectly shaped lips that he had yearned to feel against his own for years since their first encounter. The taste of them still remained in his dreams after having to give him CPR back during the Red Zone fiasco. They looked just as dry that moment as they did back then, small cracks in the skin, beautiful imperfections. That was the thing about Tony – he had fallen in love with Steve not for his perfections, but all of his imperfections. That was the moment that he
“Protect me? From what?” Tony asked as his eyes remained widened, slowly raising his arms and awkwardly patting Steve on the back. What else was he supposed to do? Steve seemed so distraught for some unknown reason so the least he could do was try and comfort him a little.
The rage boiled in both Steve and Tony’s chests, for all they had done and for all the pain they had put them through, for their friends and for the home they had lost. They walked,
When the dark haired man in the armour stared down at the two he noticed it, a gentle smile on Tony’s face as he held his fallen partners hand, fingers interlaced, laying side by side facing one another.
Tony stopped, raising his hand to his face, covering his mouth as he turned his head to stare at Steve with disbelief, “How did you know that?”
“Rhodey gets one of those limited edition model planes that he wanted and Pepper gets the exquisite Rolex – as she deserves.”
“Superhumans are not humans. They are threats. Did you not view what happened with your previous comrade?”
“Tony… Please, listen to me… Fight this… You need to fight this.” He breathed heavily, pushing himself up with his pure core strength to reach up toward the man towering over him. He wished he could move, he wished he could stand up to reach for him and grab his face and look into his eyes – but he couldn’t. He couldn’t even move his legs and that made his chest ache with worry.
“Wait, no… I didn’t mean.” He held out his hand. “Can I—Steve, what can I do for you, what can I do to show you that I know what I am?”
One thing he did notice was how the civilians seemed a little scared of Tony, and truth be told he had been at first too, so he didn’t blame them. It was all a case of trying to reassure them that Tony wasn’t harmful and meant well, which the man himself constantly tried to prove. His efforts didn’t fall on deaf ears, especially when Steve was right there with him keenly observing everything he had to offer. He seemed so determined to do well, despite the (small) hiccups that he made, and Steve appreciated his company. It seemed that they were both enthusiastic individuals that had one common goal; to make the city a safer place.
’ built with cybernetic capabilities that eclipsed any on this planet whilst invoking Steve’s communal memories, but it was before that, way before that. He was fresh blood; most importantly, he was a blank slate. He was still human and had yet to be rebuilt into the machine and slave to Ultron that he was foreordained to become. This Steve was a blank slate that Tony could take and make into something of his own, shape and mould him into the dream Captain America that he wanted to serve by his side instead of fight against.
Tony felt the warmth touch his face and he shut his eyes in bliss, “How are you doing that..?” He asked in a relaxed tone.
Once more, Tony set his jets off and hovered up toward Cap, staying behind him and trying to direct.
“I just… Well, I’m not going to lie to you, your wings… I touched them and they’ve shown me why they’re like that.” Steve muttered, shutting his eyes as he braced himself for the possible consequences of him blurting out the truth like that.
Peter loomed, edging closer with caution, ready to strike but for now just staring. Jessica did the same with Carol by her side.
Peter reached into one of his pockets and held out the tiny can in the palm of his torn gloved hand, it had to be compact  if he were to carry it around without any bag, any weight would slow him down, and living a nomadic lifestyle meant that possessions were limited, but his webbing was compulsory. The older man took it from him and quickly punctured a hole in the side of the can with the makeshift knife, then placed the can quickly to Peter’s scalp letting the liquidised webbing drip onto the wound. He then used the flat of the knife to spread it out, making sure the wound was covered as he handed the can back to Peter, wondering if he could somehow use what was left.
Tony stared with concern before forcing himself to act. He didn’t want to breach the little trust he had earned, but to hell with that. He ran toward her and pulled out the shard, huddling her close and trying to open the metal screws that held it in place. To his surprise the woman in red didn’t leap to her rescue. But by this time she had realised her hand was fine, that Tony was in fact the real Tony Stark. Details could be straightened out later; now they were being pursued, and they had to deal with Captain Marvel.
Hammer practically skipped toward the ladder, latching onto it with the Purple Man grabbing the rung just under him. “Ciao heroes! For good this time!”
Reed spoke while keeping his head down, scribbling notes on a pad, completely un-phased. “Like that.”
Luckily, Peter was the one to kneel down to the manhole; it was certain that Tony would have difficult with the chunky armour that he was in.  Tony slipped in first, since he knew his armour would take the longest, and he could use it to light up the way. He slid down the railing of the ladder and landed with a loud thump, hearing the screech of rats as they moved away. His arc reactor gleamed brightly as he stood at the bottom, holding out his arms. “We’re all clear, no waters, there’s a small path probably for workmen down here.”
“Not that you ever cared for History, be honest Peter. You were more into science and the arts, if you count photography as an art. That’s up for debate. I’m more of a pop art collector, I don’t particularly count it as an art,” Tony jested back. “And kid, this belongs to me. My suit, with custom additions that you’ve probably never seen before.”
Steve’s eyes darted from Tony to Howard, quickly standing in front of Tony in defence, “Now listen mister-”
Carefully he knelt down, pulling Tony into his arms whilst Norman was preoccupied. Scooping him up gently he leaned as close as he could, placing a hand over his heart, trying to cover the cavity desperately.
Steve grunted at him and Tony met his eyes. With a considerable amount of care, Steve pushed Tony to one side and then grabbed the edge of the door and tugged the thick steel once, then again. Tony heard the cracks in Steve’s shoulders when he used force, spotting his elbow bones poke out of the skin whenever he bent his arms, but finally with a mighty heave the door finally opened. A beam of light escaped the crack that Steve had managed to pry open from the hallway, penetrating the darkness of the depowered lab.
As they ran toward the building, there was a loud smash and Whirlwind, one of the villains that they had tackled before, came crashing out of one of the higher windows, thudding on the pavement beside them, still steaming from a blast that had come his way. Following the fallen villain was the sound of buzzing, and before they knew it, Jan appeared in front of them – returning to her normal size and standing in front of the two with her eyes red with tears.
“You look after me, you do this… For me…” He blabbered incoherently, his vocabulary becoming somewhat limited. His fingers pushed deeper, moving inward and then out, slowly at first but as Steve got the hang of it, he moved faster.
“Tony…” Steve finally spoke, drawing his eyes away from the hologram of the man on the operating table. “Waking up to find out your girlfriend… I mean, I’ve been in the same situation. If we’re exchanging stories…” It was Steve’s turn. “I lost my partner while we were on patrol once, fighting a huge neo-Nazi gang. We’d managed to take them down but… It was on Brooklyn Bridge. We took them out but they’d cut our brakes and we flew off. My partner, Bucky Barnes, probably the snarkiest fella that I’ve ever had the pleasure of working alongside, I’d do anythin’ for the guy – we were practically brothers – anyway he managed to unlock my side of the door and unclicked my belt, left me to float out free whilst he was… Dragged down with the car. Strangely enough, they never found his body… I know it’s not the same as yours, but we both lost people we care about on duty.”
He had become well aware that his technology was being bought in bulk by a mysterious security agency, which he was later hired by under the impression was a rather small-fry company. Turns out after he was ‘hired’ to freelance for them, much more was revealed. They were a superhero organisation, and had formed a team of heroes of which he was invited to join. Tony wasn’t particularly much of a team player when it came to working in his suit of Iron, his superhero alias, Iron Man, and particularly disliked when they had found out that Tony Stark and Iron Man were one in the same after he had spent so long trying to fool them. Making robotic suits and improving his AI to become more lifelike, but it was no match for SHIELD. Instantly upon making the discovery, Tony was taken on board (with much protest from the billionaire, but that was overcome once he was given full security access, including the president’s private number – needless to say, Tony and the president soon became well acquainted.) and had his skills utilized, but the billionaire was never one to remain in a static position. He began to climb the corporate ladder riddled with bureaucracy and then the time came, his time, the era of Stark.
They made their way toward the doors, and cracked them open. With the power gone, the bars were lifted, and both of them had to shield their eyes when they stepped out into the light. The clouds above had faded, and the sun cracked through those that remained, beaming rays of sunlight into the huge building littered with fallen drones.
Tony hopped out of the car, feeling the urge to skip out, actually. He couldn’t have had a better night, and the fact that Steve had agreed to going out with him some time really made him buzz with joy, not to mention a touch of anxiety, worrying over what he was going to wear already. Of course he’d wear his signature hat and coat, but what suit? The choices were endless. It would have to be something designer and top notch, even though he knew by now that Steve didn’t care about designer brands. Still, Tony would give Steve nothing but the best.
Right now it felt as though Steve’s heart was on cloud nine. It beat quickly, his cheeks already flushed as it was – thankfully the cold air cooled them a little, and the dim light of the street gave him some shade to hide beneath. Even if this was just a friendly gesture Steve appreciated it from the bottom of his heart. He was scared to get close to partners after losing his own, but this one was something really special, and he was very perceptive – noticing his love for the star design. It was more symbolic than anything; Tony had given him a star, which was probably why Tony was a detective in the first place, because he was sharp and smart. But he could see by the way that the other man shifted, the way his hands buried in his pockets and his head tilting, that he was nervous.
“Seems we’ve rescued all the cats in the city,” Tony concurred, resting his head on the back of the chair, his hat just balancing on the top of his head, about to tip off at any small movement.
“Oh my sweetheart, she’s so scared!” the woman continued on, her white curls bouncing with every overly dramatic head movement she made.
!” Hammer waved his hand and the sound of blades cutting the air was heard nearby. In a matter of moments, one of his drone-helicopters, a steel chunkier helicopter with spotlights beaming from its base cut through the dark clouds above and extended a ladder to the two.
“Beep- beep- We’ve got a call for help! Not too far from here—a damsel in distress! Down by the park..!” he replied. “Beep beep- send help--!”
“It’s done something to everyone, and it wasn’t just in New York – it was global. It started with the one on the top of the Empire State, and heroes worldwide tried to do exactly what you did. You know, they even managed to penetrate Latveria. Needless to say, Doom wasn’t happy when he returned from the UN conference to see his people suffering from a major brain disease that was brought on due to the gas.”
“With the serum…?” Reed asked. “We can try with samples we’ve gotten before, but that virus is doing strange things to him. We need to keep him under strict quarantine until we can contain it. One thing’s definite, Tony; he’s been injected with something that is destroying him, and we’ll need to ensure that it’s contained so that there’s no risk of it being passed on. If it originated in his circulatory system, then there is a risk that there is a possible contagion in terms of blood. We
“What’s that?” Tony spotted as he pulled away from the embrace and picked up a glowing golden feather that slowly turned white before vanishing in his hand, “No… No way…” He said, turning his hand from front to back, seeing nothing. Shortly after he returned to Steve’s arms, placing his own around Steve. It’s not that he believed him, it’s just that the man was spouting out these things that no one else could have possibly known, not only that but that… Feather, that strange feather that seemed to just disappear right in front of him, now that was strange. He placed his head gently against Steve’s chest, enjoying the comfort and hence why he returned to it as quickly as he could. “Is this some sort of dream? With the wings and the feather and everything?”
“And you expect me to just go out like this, out there?” he emphasized his words by pointing outside.
“You think erasing his memories is all I can do with this?” He asked, stepping toward the main computers and typing a couple of commands whilst the two were temporarily distracted, with Steve disorientated and Tony trying to figure out what was wrong with him. Steve’s eyes flickered again and Tony quickly made steps backward.
“Yes sir!” He said far too over enthusiastically, biting on the inside of his lips to supress the cursewords he wanted to let out.
Angels need to be loved and cared for in order for their wings to grow and flourish, but if they are mistreated, their wings will turn black, droop and fall, even break and trail behind them which cause them to lose their wings. Their wings cannot be seen by other humans on the earth so they appear as regular human beings. Only angels can see other angel’s wings.
He looked around, turning from side to side and then getting to his feet quietly, as to not disturb the sleeping boy. As carefully as he could he tip toed toward the door and craned his neck out, only to be greeted by a red gloved hand that wrapped around his neck and threw him back into the wall of the corridor with a heavy smack. He wretched in pain, coughing.
“You are, you’re still Steve.” Tony repeated, watching Reed carefully as he began to dispense the food the same way as last time; through the chute and on the tray, ensuring that everything that entered was thoroughly sterilised.
“Don’t run away from me, Tony. Why are you pushing people away!?” He asked, grabbing him by the white straps that rest over shoulder and pulling him closer, that was, until he had just spotted the red ring around his neck that most definitely looked as though he had been strangled.  “What… When did that..?”
His hand clasped Tony’s shoulder and he looked at him straight in the eye, as emotional as they both were at that point. “I know how you feel Tony,” Steve replied with a heartfelt stare of empathy.
Tony was screaming in his mind, he was yelling and kicking, pleading to be let go, but instead he was forced to yell through gritted teeth – pinned down by industrial sized rusted chains, watching as the saw descended deeper into his arm and met the bone. Then there was a judder, the saw worked harder to break the heavy joint. The cutting had a higher pitch to it as it managed, slowly pushing down until there was an extremely loud snap, and the rest was like it was cutting through paper. Tony’s arm was cut clean off, gushing blood.
There was no getting through to Osborn. He had become drunk on power and driven insane by his lust for it, he was standing there, foaming at the mouth just talking about it. “Steve… Look at me.”
“If I’m honest, yes. Not afraid to say it, Cap. I’m not afraid of that intimidating stare that can make Stark melt as soon as you shoot it at him. This is between them; we need to keep out of it unless it gets too heated. Even so, they’re both grown men, they’re best friends, they’ve gone through more than you can imagine so it’s best to leave it be.”
Hours passed…Steve tried to sleep, but his insomnia prevented him from doing so. He decided to head down to the empty kitchen for a snack, only to spot Peter Parker swooping in for a midnight snack which consisted of fruit loops, as usual. Steve decided to follow his lead and made himself a midnight snack of the biggest bologna sandwich he could make, devouring it in around five minutes before returning to bed, hearing the faint echo of “You should be a professional eater,” from Peter in the distance, to which he snorted and returned to his bedroom.
“Tony…” Steve trailed off yet again. “You do have a heart, even if it’s assisted by that metal glowing thing under your chest, you still have a heart and it still beats. You’re the most caring person that I’ve met. Look at how many kittens we’ve saved, pal, that’s all because of you.” He smiled reassuringly, noticing how Tony’s eyes seemed to light up again.
“I’ve got that one!” Steve called back, kicking down a drone mid-flight that was ready to strike Tony, and sending it right into the marble floor they were standing on.
She removed her cap once she was indoors and kept it under her arm, waving to a couple of the other cops and leading Steve throughout the maze of their precinct until they reached the main staff lounge and gestured for Steve to take a seat while one of the other men handed her a cup of coffee straight from the pot. It was then that Steve realised that she was clearly someone important, and respected, which only made him sit up straighter, his back not touching the back of the dark grey stained seat. By the looks of it someone had spilled their coffee on the chair he was sat on in the past, numerous times.  Not that there was anything wrong with stains; at least it was a little more homely, to a degree.
“They used to, yeah. More people live actually in the city, it’s easier to ‘recharge’. Like I said, most people have augmentations now so they need to charge up at night. That curfew in place, well, it’s set by the government to ensure that everyone ‘functions’ well.”
It was obvious to Tony that Steve was going to keep poking at this until he was given answers. Instead of telling him right away, Tony sighed deeply and shrugged, trying to play innocent. “I have no idea what you’re talking about.”
The punch had made the super soldier falter too, he staggered in the air and nearly fell, quickly kicking into action again the moment he felt the surge of pain run down his spine. There was a warm spark he felt for a while, luckily it was that same jolt that brought him back to consciousness before he’d fallen completely, glad that his own thrusters were keeping him a lift.
“My eye… It’s buzzing… It hurts!” She screamed with unbearable pain as the sensation of needles piercing her covered eye was the closest description to the sensation that she was experiencing.
With a flick of his wrist he began to recall his shield, though by this time Tony was reaching around to the back of Steve’s head, slipping his fingers past his blond locks until he’d reached the short shaven part just by the nape of his neck. His fingers fumbled, internally apologising as he began to dig the sharp metal fingers of his augmented appendage into the back of them. If he was anything like the others he’d have a chip in him, hoping that it was like Peter’s if any. There was a lot of luck involved in his thought process, and unfortunately Tony Stark wasn’t the luckiest of men.
His voice lowered, his grip loosened and he eventually let go. “You’re not a machine, Tony. You’re a human, you’re a man. I trust you…”
“Tony, while you were sleeping I’d managed to get some food for him, I got him just as T’Challa and Hank had asked; the balanced diet but it’s still not enough.”
He watched it flicker until an image finally cleared, eye narrowing on the vision that was before him of Steve walking about the city. This was all what was going on in the mind of the super soldier, and was being manufactured by the simulator.
Having the mansion in the centre of New York City meant that they could have anything they wanted in the past. Now, the city was a buffet for them. Steve’s fingers wrapped around the golden bars of the gate, pulling it and bending it, again his shoulder popped and Tony made a groan of concern when he heard the noise. Nonetheless, Steve carried on pulling and rattling the stubborn gate. Tony had enforced the gate with titanium and had done so after the mansion had come under attack repeatedly. Steve leaned forward and started to gnaw at the metal poles only to be struck by the echo of the chomp and the vibration of the bar as it surged up his head, making him dizzy and sending him back.
Steve turned around to see one of the boomerangs that were thrown making a swift return to its owner, quickly Tony repulsored it to make it fly to the ground, swooping up to Steve and grabbing Boomerang who was already dazed from the solid smack that Cap had delivered.
