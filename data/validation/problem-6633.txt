They had clearly decided that he didn't need to be even a tangential part of their conversation anymore. No, they were ignoring him and continuing with their own talk. It was probably for the best since it would maybe help him get himself under control.
Thor seemed to think he needed cheering up though, because the god wrapped an arm around his shoulders and pulled him close. There was an awful lot of cuddling going on. It was nice even if he didn't have his top choice of fella to be cuddling with. Better than nice, actually - he'd spent so long feeling alone that being close to people he trusted was still both wonderful and novel. So maybe he was a little green over how damn lucky Rhodes was, but it was hard to be really upset. He was surrounded by friends that were almost family, Tony had touched his arm, and even with Rhodes there the genius was still looking and smiling at Steve.
He wanted to protest, wanted to demand that Tony stop and stay so they could talk this out... but he also knew his fella. Tony needed time to process,
him more than probably anyone. Seemed to think his best friend had hung the moon and all the stars really, and he talked the guy up endlessly. That same man wanted to be
"There ya go. That's better already. I'll meet ya at home soon, okay? Gotta be here ta back Rhodey a bit longer'n then I'll come runnin'. Take care-a your pops now."
taking a real vacation after he hit twenty five or so. Even most of the shenanigans he had described happened as part of work trips. "Fuck. Okay. So. Vacation."
The process of creating Ultron was interrupted by the Mind Stone, Mr. Poppleton, as I'm sure you were made aware while being briefed for this- this farce.
"Has Brucie been forcing you to experiment with tea too? Because just as a warning he tried to kill me last Saturday."
"It isn't your world either," Lokes cut in smoothly. "Yet here you are, worrying over its fate and fighting for it."
“Both choices have their merits! And on any other night I would delight in either food, for Midgardian pizza is a marvel I wish could be recreated in Asgard, and we all know I relish Asian delicacies. But there is a chill in the air, is there not Tony? None can argue that--”
been the first major battle the boys had taken part in. His sour patch was pretty resolute that one day Harley and Peter would be leaders in the Avengers Initiative. He'd want to start training them in the minutiae that Tony and Steve never had to bother with anymore.
He blinked and found himself in the most obnoxiously tacky room he'd ever seen in his life. It was all ridiculously ostentatious to the point of being absurd, and he immediately felt at home. The life-sized golden statue of Iron Man with a tiny Captain America done in bronze perched on shoulder - coincidentally the same shoulder Twinkles had landed on before they left - was probably what really sealed the deal. Before he could laugh as much as that touch deserved and well before he could start exploring the room, Steve and the boys grabbed his arms and dragged him away.
"You keep your mouth shut about anything you may or may not have seen. You tell no one. Not even Nat, Clint."
him! And that mean old witch in charge just laughed when I told her 'cause she says squirrels aren't any better than mice, and I maybe don't know a lot about mice since I can't talk to them the way I can Tappy, but I think they're just fine! Maybe she's the new... nusa... maybe she's the one that's awful! She's supposed to take care of me now that my parents... but she isn't! She's just being mean about Tappy and saying she's going to take him away and she can't because he's my best friend and... and... and he's been with me even when they... And anyway I'm not going back and you can't make me even if Mr. Doctor Strange thinks you can. And even if you do I'll just run away again! So there!"
"Really?" The smile pressed against his neck only fueled him to continue and hide a smile of his own in tousled brown hair.
"Well... since I already did that and we both want forever, I'm thinking we might as well fuck that ten year plan up even more. Though really it sounds like it was more two different but related five year plans."
"Hey Harls? You wanna maybe shelve the workshop design and come help me make a new superhero identity for Steve instead?"
"I've been working on something," Harley broke in, grinning with his eyes lit up. He looked so excited, so eager... he hoped this had been the right choice. Rhodey and Danvers would have ideas and limits that would keep his kids safe, he knew it. They would hash out a plan to make sure any Junior Avengers were trained and protected as they developed into full grown superheroes. Peter was going to be Spider-Man no matter what, and he had a feeling that Harley might go down that same road. The two of them couldn't be the only ones, so it only made sense to get a workable program in place.
"Why not? Also, butt out Winghead. Anyway. I'm thinking that instead of giving it to lame-o here who can't even get a dick punch right... I think I'll give it to you." With a flourish, Shellhead began to pull something out of that small pouch; whatever it was it got bigger the farther he pulled it out. When it was finally all the way out, Steve realized that he was looking at the back of his shield and felt his breath catch in his throat. Tony didn't recognize it as quickly, but once Shellhead turned it around his lover went pale and recoiled back in his seat.
, but you only get the one. If you vanish again without good cause the Defenders won't need to descend en masse. You'll be far too dead for them to bother."
"Harls. Are you... are you saying what I think you're saying? I mean, you've got to know that you don't have to--"
As much as he wanted to talk to the Defenders about Bucky, Steve knew that talking to Tony took precedence. He was grateful, relieved and excited that his friend had been liberated; he wasn't about to take a nuke to his relationship over it. The visit from the rogue Avengers hadn't helped anything, and he'd been reluctant to end the cuddle piles and bonding time that happened directly after. Since the only one who'd so much as made a face about staying for a few days was Loki, he jumped on the opportunity and asked Pepper to get them settled in rooms to do just that.
"You got a hanky or something I could wear close to my heart? A knight's gotta have the favor of his fella before going inta battle." A hint of color dusted Tony's cheeks, but Steve didn't flatter himself to think it meant anything. Probably the genius just didn't think Steve would take the game so far. Or maybe he was just surprised that Steve knew about that kind of stuff - Sarah Rogers had loved all the old tales about King Arthur and Camelot and things. It was amazing how much of it had stuck.
He wanted to explain that they wouldn't do that - Loki wouldn't just snatch him away again like that, not after everything - but he wasn't sure it would work. Not when Tony was ready to fight them, not when Peter and Harley were on either side of them prepared to do the same, taking their cue from their more dramatic father figure. Dum-E and U were crowding against his back while STAR was on his shoulder - she at least seemed amused by the whole thing.
He paused and gave that question the thought it deserved. Part of him wanted nothing more than to put on his Iron Man suit and wade into things. He'd love to pound Rogers into the pavement, wanted to rip apart Falcon's wings and remind the Widow why she never should have crossed him. It would feel so fucking good to tear into them, show them just how much he'd been holding back in Siberia out of that nagging, relentless, misplaced sense of loyalty and friendship... but the world was going to need them.
Harley's arms adjusted around him in a tight but comforting hold. They'd flown together like this only once before, but he knew the kid had him. If all else failed, his girl FRIDAY would take care of them both. Just before Harley took off, Rogers finally seemed to notice them.
Fingers squeezed his arm a little too tightly at first before easing into something more gentle. "No. Don't suppose it will. How..." Steve swallowed audibly and for the first time since Tony had woken up, the man sounded uncertain. Maybe even a little afraid. "How bad is it? I dreamed... it was bad in my dream, sweetheart. Real bad. How much did he hurt you?"
"I'm Winter," was the casual answer, sass thankfully absent. Winter's focus was entirely on Bucky, who was staring back at him with wide eyes as the color slowly drained from his cheeks. "Captain Marvel asked me to stop by. What are you wearing?" He added with a frown at his counterpart. "Steve told me you were done running. You look like a hobo."
!" The squirrel sounded just as scandalized as she did, and Steve fought back the laugh that wanted to escape. They certainly were a pair. "He's my best friend and his name is name is Tappy and I won't leave him behind ever!" Suddenly she was fierce as anything, and she bared her teeth at him in a display that was surprisingly intimidating. "And I won't go back either! They tried to
It was probably too much to hope that Tony wouldn't call the woman a 'mean old witch' to her face though.
"Not for long," Clint said while slinging an arm over Tony's shoulder. He couldn't help but lean into the touch - Rhodey and Pepper had both accused him of being touch-starved, which was patently untrue. He was just tactile. Dammit. "We're going to a bar so I can listen to ‘Tony's Tales of Debauchery'."
"You're the pinnacle of perfection and don't you ever let anyone tell you otherwise." Bruce rolled his eyes and even blushed a little, but he had that little smirk tugging at his lips again, so Tony was pretty sure he was pleased. "Hey, what are you doing later? I've been playing with energy solutions lately and I think some of it might be right up your alley. I could use another set of eyes, if you don't mind. Then we could blow shit up for a while or work on the Hulk Pants problem if you'd rather be productive."
"Yes, that will be all Mr. Stark." After pressing a kiss to his cheek, she cleared her throat and looked away, eyes still suspiciously wet. "Now. As much as I'd love to see your new suit, Steve, I think I'd better go. I have this feeling that you're going to end up jumping him even more enthusiastically than I did." Steve's face immediately went bright red which would never stop being adorable. He also didn’t stammer an immediate ‘no way’. That was interesting and extremely promising. They hadn't had workshop sex yet.
"Don't you 'aww Tony' me, Captain America. J, we're gonna enter lockdown mode, buddy. Nobody in or out of this workshop until I say so."
“Tony, anything I could come up with ain’t half as bad as the things that drop out of your mouth on the regular.”
“We’ve already had pizza three nights this week. I’m getting sick of all the grease and cheese. I bet Tony is too, aren’t you Tony?”
“So do you know what you’re gonna order yet?” Steve’s voice was close enough to his ear to make him shiver.
"For fuck's sake." His fella sounded more amused than anything now, thank God. "Stop breaking him Harls. I only just got him back."
some of them. I thought Natasha was my friend." The bitterness she felt over that was clearly evident, enough that he felt the urge to wrap her up in a hug. Steve got there first, standing and tugging her into his arms. The look on his face was achingly similar to the one she was wearing, and Tony felt…
Affection from his boys was more easily earned. Their love for him was as uncomplicated and easy as his love was for them. Even while he scolded and threatened, it was second nature for him to run fingers over their struts and claws, or for them to drape themselves carefully over his shoulders. J showed affection through dry wit, sarcasm and the way he was constantly just there. Sure Tony had initially programmed some of that, but he knew that now most of it was by choice. They were a little tightly knit family that Tony had never, ever thought would get any bigger.
Finding out that Shellhead was terrified of exactly the same thing had been a revelation. Once they started actually talking to one another they bonded almost instantly. That little twinge of jealously flickered out to nothing, and he was going to miss his other self a hell of a lot. The guy had even built a fist-sized heart out of gears and scrap metal that was stunning; it rested in place of honor on the memorial Steve and the boys had made for JARVIS. Tony might have cried a little when it had been presented.
"Young lady," Strange snapped, his cloak rearing behind him like an angry cat. "If you do not rein yourself in and come with me, I will be forced to
He snorted, imagining the chaos that would cause. "No. Absolutely not. Shellhead'd find a palace or somethin'. I want somethin' more cozy."
When I asked about rumors of the Rogue's return, Steve sighed heavily. "We voted on it, all of us new Avengers. I know Rhodey - uh, Colonel Rhodes - put out a press release and all that. So that's the official position - they'll be allowed to work their way back onto the team once the legal mess gets sorted. It's one I stand behind, 'cause that's what the vote was." I got the feeling that he wasn't necessarily pleased with that decision, but he refused to even come close to actually saying that. His continued comment was 'The New Avengers voted on it'.
, and he hadn't had to bleed for the privilege. An impossible thing had just happened and he couldn't help but believe it, even if it was well after breakfast. Maybe another impossible thing was on the horizon, one that was even better and meant that he had a shot at an impossibly amazing future.
“Iron Mom? Pops?” Steve looked between the two of them, then around the room like he would find answers there. “Is there some kinda mind control villain hiding in here or somethin’? I don’t--” Dum-E finally left his sulk to zoom over to Steve’s side, bumping into him gently before tucking his claw against the blond’s neck. “Hey there buddy. What’s wrong? Your… ma hurtin’
"I'm not at liberty to say, Captain. But I believe that if you go down dressed as you are now it would become something you kicked yourself over later. I would like to prevent that eventuality if possible."
Everyone was having fun and that was more important than any bruised pride Steve would be incurring if he gave a shit about being good at the game. As it was, he found it as funny as the rest of them and he couldn't wait for Pepper and Alicia to get so fed up with it all that they combined forces to do a routine that brought the house down and shattered all previous records. They were as good as Steve was terrible and it was always fun to watch.
"I'm only losing because I'm trying to compensate for repulsers my guy doesn't actually have," Tony retorted, playfully cross.
This chapter might be a little under-edited, but I wanted to get it up and I'm working a lot this next week.
There was also something shameful in it though, something that made him feel small all over again. None of it meant anything, after all. Nobody who mattered ever really touched him. Well, Buck was the obvious exception because he always was, and Peggy had brushed her fingers against his a few times. Otherwise, it was all just skin on skin, and it was all meant for Captain America, not little Stevie Rogers who was still going to die alone.
Maybe she was sure, but he wasn't. He hadn't been face to face with Bucky Barnes in decades, and now the fella wouldn't even use that name. Peggy had told him firmly to use 'Winter' as a term of address because anything else was likely to end with a punch to his face. He hated that name, that identity; he hated what his friend had been twisted into. But if that's what 'Winter' wanted to be called, well.
With a sigh born of fond exasperation because Harley still tended to do the same thing, he reached for his wallet and pulled out a few bills. "Here. Go nuts, alright? Belly's prob'ly always yellin' at ya, huh? Let's try'n get it ta shut up for a bit."
But now? Now he was almost dizzy with all the extra oxygen he was getting. He couldn't believe how much of a difference it made, or that most people felt this way most of the time. He was never going to take it for granted again, that was for damn sure. Steve had laughed when he brought it up, a little bit of pain in his his eyes. 'One of the first things I said ta Buck after I got the serum', he'd admitted quietly, hesitantly. That had hurt for a few seconds, because any talk of Bucky Barnes was always bound to. Once he'd pushed past that he'd given his
When it came to his team during WWII, he was far more willing to give me more information. "My best buddy Arnie was on the team, of course. I met Bucky Barnes-" here he stopped and had to take a second. I imagine that Bucky Barnes from that world didn't fare much better than our own. I didn't press. "Met him when I went to basic, and he got the serum right along with me. We teamed up pretty much right away, then brought in Arnie and the others later. So besides those two mooks, we had Edwin Jarvis, James Howlett, and Matthew Carter. He was Peggy Carter's grandad," he added with a grin. "So I guess I can admit that Pegs is one of the Defenders too."
"Don't you roll your eyes at me. Now. We should have something to present your mom with, complete with safety features and the assurance that Fri will be able to take over and re-route you back here in case of emergencies. First we need to design--"
Steve didn't let go until his opponent was starting to sag down against him, no longer fighting quite so hard to get away. Through some sort of fancy hand-to-hand magic, a quick flex of muscle sent Rogers rolling away. Maybe the universe didn't hate him quite as much as it had always felt like, because his lover's shirt had rucked up during the struggle and he got to watch a downright sinful display of rolling abs when Steve got to his feet without using his damn hands like the sexy show-off that he was. Little demon then looked over and
There was a little bouquet of flowers laying on one of the workbenches. Only a couple months ago he would have assumed they were for Pepper, or maybe for Nat as a 'thanks' for working with him on his hand to hand. But once he and Tony had settled on a name Steve had spent days looking at those specific flowers, spent hours drawing and shading different bunches of the things so he could make the perfect design for Tony to have etched on Primrose's leather collar.
and he knew he was going to fuck it up... but he had two amazing kids who wanted him to try anyway. Three if you counted the tiny terror that was Laney, who would probably be demanding a suit of her own any day now. Seemed to be the trend.
You said there were two reasons Earth hasn't faced more hostile invasions. We've only talked about one, so what was the other?
All of the men in hearing distance shuddered in concert. Harley even managed to shift enough to put a protective hand over his crotch. It had been a low, dirty blow but Frank had definitely started it. And after that he'd been a lot more willing to listen to her directions. He'd even stopped trying to kill the bad guys... at least when he was on missions with them. Every once in a while word would reach Carol of a 'mysterious' death that had hallmarks of the Punisher. Carol would then glare at Frank and Frank would glare back and eventually they'd both mutter and turn away. For a while after that, the Punisher would be back on his leash.
"Stop laughing or I'll have to spank you. Look." The playful tease gave way to a far more serious tone of voice, one that made Steve stand a little taller and listen close. "I want forever with you and for some crazy reason you want the same with me. Maybe we can't get apples right away and maybe everyone else will think we're jumping the gun, but... Steve. Cookie crumble. Babe. I... I love you, okay? I can't imagine ever not loving you. We've known each other for years, been friends almost as long and now... it doesn't feel too soon to me."
. There in the bed, in the tower. In his life. If they guy went off to take revenge on his behalf it would be sort of sweet but it would also mean he was gone. Again.
Emotion lodged in his throat, a confusing mix of relief, shame and love that would be almost impossible to untangle. He believed the man – Tiny Adorable Steve had never lied to him. He didn’t lie and he did everything he could to keep every promise he made. So his lover was there to stay and he wouldn’t leave Tony behind like so much broken baggage. He wasn’t like—
Everything in Steve turned cold at those words, as cold as the ice that had claimed him for so long. Tony had come so close to... Christ, watching him fall had been torture, and then there'd been that horrible moment of not knowing before JARVIS confirmed that his creator was alive. Barely, the AI had said, sounding so lost and scared that Steve had almost fucking panicked. He had almost lost Tony, might have lost Tony if Thor hadn't swooped in to carry him to medical. He could have lost Tony without the man ever knowing how he felt, and... and…
would tell him it wasn't a big deal that he'd changed his mind. His Tiny Adorable Steve would quietly accept it and decide to remain home himself, at least for the day. The blond would be forced to choose,
"All I have down here for food is coffee and my yummy chlorophyll smoothies. You won’t like any of it and you’re going to get hungry enough to bargain eventually."
'Home' now meant the tower for them both, and he was holding out hope that soon the common floor would be filled with warmth and laughter the way he knew Tony had always wanted it to be. Once both Avengers were a little more healed he fully intended on enforcing family time. They all needed it. He could see that from the ghosts in Rhodey's eyes and the way Pepper had almost broken down weeping when she realized he was back.
Really? FRIDAY, please bring up the live transcript, if you will. [pause] If you read this back I think you'll understand why I don't believe you. I think you're here to try and dig up dirt on Mr. Stark. However, as you are an official liaison from the Committee, I suppose I'll give you the benefit of the doubt. What questions do you have?
Rhodey and Viz would be moving to the site soon, and they would be the ones to welcome the new members to their new homes. Tony mostly planned for them to commute, though he and Steve knew they would have to stay there for stretches at a time to make sure they integrated well enough to fight. All in all, the New Avengers Initiative was shaping up nicely and should be ready to get off the ground in a month or so.
It had been... a really long time. Almost longer than he could remember, actually, since just breathing had been so easy. Even after he'd finally removed the arc reactor, a lot of the damage had remained. Sure it had been easier to catch his breath after that and maybe he had managed to convince himself that it was just like it had been before the shrapnel. He'd had a literal weight off his chest after all, and it had felt good. Scary, but good.
. He could jump and flail to metal or hard rock with the best of them, but popular music got his hips interested like nobody's business.
Steve and Pepper weren't laying waste because he had asked them not to. He was almost one hundred percent sure that Rhodey would come himself without informing the UN because Tony wanted them
Doctor Strange was standing alone, cloak flared behind him despite the lack of wind. The rigidness was born from the cloak's displeasure, he knew. Neither the Sorcerer Supreme nor his sentient clothing had been amused to learn about Wanda and her various antics. Strange planned to whisk her off right away, to a room where he could test her control and power safely.
instead of anything resembling legs or arms, malice in its glowing red eyes. The thing wasn't as agile as he was, but it still turned quickly enough in the air and was after him again.
"You said ten year plan earlier. So I had five years to fall for your sneaky charms... what happens in the next five years?"
." Harley still spat out the names of all the Rogues like they were curses, despite the way that most of them had been embraced back into the fold. Tony kind of admired the loyalty and pettiness of that, which probably made him a really bad person. "So if he realizes you live here before ya talk to him about, he's gonna flip."
If the thought put a little wiggle in his hips as he grooved to his music... well. No one would know but his boys. J was the only one who would be able to tell on him, and the AI had seen way,
"Of course Steve. Did you have something in particular you wanted to talk about or are are we shooting the shit again?" He didn't even fight the way his lips quirked up at the phrase. She was certainly something, their girl FRIDAY.
"He does not like me. I don't blame him for that, and he... he does not have to let me live here, but he does. He pays for my food and for my doctors, and when he sees me in the hallway he only averts his eyes instead of cursing or lashing out at me. I do not want to push him further."
He should tell Winter that the Defenders could go home, that they were fine. But he kind of liked the thought of it, being able to see his fella and his friends when he got up in the morning. And that tiny part of him that wanted to be hyper-alert, that was warning that Thanos could be so much closer than Gamora thought, that battle could find them again at any moment... that part of him was able to stand down. The Defenders were there, so he and Tony were safe.
"Yes ma'am." His Tiny Adorable Steve sounded... strange. Echoey somehow? But also closer than anyone else, and something... something was happening...
"I don't need your kind of help. Not anymore. So just... stop. Stop helping me, alright? All I want from you, from
"Oh give it a rest. Ya shoot Rogers and I'm gonna have ta arrest ya. So mebbe don't, okay? Try usin' your words."
He was pulled out of that morbid thought by the press of Steve's lips against his own. Long, elegant fingers gently famed his face as his
“The diner sounds good to me.” Clint threw up his hands while Nat muttered something in Russian. Thor looked resigned but still happy enough, one hand reaching out to clap Bruce on the shoulder.
“Uh, yes you do. And come on! Vietnamese sounds so good right now. I can’t believe you’re fucking campaigning for pizza - you barely like pizza! You never want it when I want it--”
." Tony shifted so they could look at each other, then dragged Steve's legs into his lap. A massage was probably on the way, which he wouldn't object to at all. His genius had very clever fingers, after all. "It's not like we'd be unreachable either, if something huge happened or they needed us to consult. We could even come pop back in after a week or so and then go back. Fuck, I haven't had a real vacation in...." The prolonged silence caused his lips to twitch as Tony visibly tried to remember
"Oh Tony," Steve's ghost whispered against his temple. "What have they done ta ya, sweetheart?" Fingers began to stroke through his hair, and it was great and horrifying how real his hallucinations had become. More frightening was the way he leaned into the touch even if he knew it couldn't be real. The high whine he could hear was actually coming from his throat, and fuck that would be embarrassing if anyone was there to hear it. "Shhh. I got ya now. It's gonna be okay Tony, and I ain't gonna leave ever again."
"Maybe a little. Hey Butterfingers, Dum-E. You see what your ma got me?" All three 'bots gave cheerful whistles and beeps before Dum-E pressed right up against his side. Butterfingers began to gesture emphatically - it would have taken him a second to catch on, but Tony always knew what the boys were trying to say immediately.
"Bucky Barnes died in the snow over seventy years ago." Winter's voice was even, but his shoulders had begun to tense. His eyes had gone that pale, almost luminescent gray that signaled 'danger', and Steve was pretty sure his right hand was drifting towards the gun he'd brought. Winter really,
“Hey there beautiful.” He scoffed at the endearment even if the naked affection in Steve’s voice lifted his entire spirit. There were all kinds of wires hooked up to him, he hadn’t had his new version of a ‘bath’ in almost two days and he knew there were still some cuts and bruises littering his face. He was just about the farthest from ‘beautiful’ he could get.
Soul was passionate rage, judgement and mercy and vengeance and so many other things without name. Together they advanced, three Entities who had chosen freedom against two that half-heartedly obeyed Thanos. Mind kept out of it - Soul had known it would, after the last experience it had had with Thanos. It would not aid them, but it would not try to stop them either. They did not need it to complete their task, and so they did not ask it to choose a side.
At first Tony thought that J had opened up the elevator for them so they could get in as soon as they reached the bank. Instead Captain America - perfect, manly, unfairly attractive Captain America - stepped out onto the common floor. His face lit up just a little when he saw them, which Tony was pretty sure was all because of Clint. Clint got along with everyone, and no, Tony wasn't bitter about that
The arguing Avengers ignored the complaint, three of them glaring at each other while Bruce held his ground with a little less intensity. Nat and Clint had been playing tug-of-war with his arms while making their points until Steve had intervened and gently pulled him out of the fray. Now his arm was slung over Tony’s shoulders while he watched the others, curiously without an opinion.
The two Starks grinned at each other, and despite himself he started to smile too. During their little exchange both of them had relaxed, their body language now open and engaged. Tony's hands were flying a mile a minute while he talked, while Shellhead was slower but more expansive in his movements. It was sort of... surreal to see them both at the same time, sitting across from each other and wearing nearly the same smirk.
"Let's not go that far. And anyway, you're still my kid, so watch your language. Only me and Steve are allowed to swear like that."
"I don't know how you keep doing this," he murmured in Steve's ear, hugging the man close to his body. The two of them and the kids had all gathered to say goodbye to the visiting Defenders. Pepper had said hers the night before, and he kind of wished he'd been able to do the same. This was a lot more emotionally charged, especially since he was watching everyone else do it first.
He hated the parties even more than Tony did. They turned him back into the stiff, awkward man who had first come out of the ice. People were always crowding too close or asking questions that were way too personal. Tony always tried to make sure there were a few World War Two vets floating around in the crowd. Steve would latch on to them in between fetching Tony his drinks and food, and it would keep some of the more offensive party goers off his back.
. STAR was holding onto his ear so hard it hurt, and soon that tiny pinprick of pain was the only thing he could feel apart from his pounding heart.
"That was... that was really sweet. You're both gross though and should remove yourselves from my person." Thank fuck they both knew him well enough not to obey the order. As he watched Rogers swagger forward, offering his hand to Rhodey to shake, he was torn between fear and fury. The mixture was causing panic instead, which was
I'm well aware - I can see her typing. You should be aware that we are currently being recorded for my records. FRIDAY is learning how to transcribe and would like the practice. I'll send you a copy of our official version of events to make sure they line up. Now. How can I help you?
"Did you... did you move yourself and your family into my tower?" Tony looked like he was completely torn between pride and outrage, and it hit Steve's funny bone just the right way. He started to laugh, and at first he could hide the quiet chuckles in his fella's hair. The longer he thought about it though, about how it was just the sort of thing the man himself would do, the louder he got. Soon he had to pull away so he didn't jostle Tony too much. It was the kind of laugh that started deep inside and just sort of rolled outward until he was clutching his stomach and fighting to breathe.
"What the hell is going on?!" That was Rogers, and he sounded just as bewildered and furious as Steve had thought he would. Why Winter had decided to go through with this he didn't know. He was also kind of ticked at everyone who'd talked the guy into it. Later on he'd have to make that annoyance known. "Who are you?"
He figured that maybe in five years he'd be on solid ground to start the ten year plan that would include marriage. The ten year plan was the one that involved sweet-talking Thor into stealing a few apples.
His lips twitched in relief and amusement as he stalked towards spear chick. Captain Marvel had the shoulder that hadn't been burned to a crisp in one hand, other fist hammering at the chick repeatedly. Glaive guy was almost free, and fuck he hoped this gamble had worked... especially after seeing Black Panther, Okoye and the rest of the Dora Milaje in a tight ring around a downed Rescue. Pep wasn't hurt too badly or he would have been told, but he still wanted to kill anything that tried to take advantage of her moment of weakness.
He reached out for Steve who sounded furious and lost, voice shaking with emotion. Just before their hands touched he hesitated. He didn't know if the gesture would be welcome or if he would be shoved away. Hell, he didn't even know if Steve was still with him - he was staring straight ahead, something haunted in the lines around his eyes.
And if, in the process, Tony got one step closer to retiring and coming to live in his world? That was just a bonus he would be quietly thankful for.
He'd seen in the movies how sometimes the main character would just prop their chin in one hand and sigh longingly while staring at their love interest; it took everything he had not to do just that. He still felt like maybe Tony would see little cartoon hearts dancing around his head. Nat assured him that he was very obvious about his pining and was just as sure that the genius had no idea. She called him pathetic in Russian every time he brought up the hopelessness of the situation, but she would also pet his hair and make him a medovik cake whenever he was feeling especially upset by it.
"Oh yeah. He never had pets as a kid, you know? Howard wouldn't let him, and whenever Tones tried to make a metal version-- uh, not important." Fuck, Steve wished he could go back in time and beat the hell out of the man who had apparently made himself out to be his best friend way-back-when. "So he gets to college - a skinny-ass fifteen year old with more sass than anything else - and finds out about the lab rats in the bio department. Apparently he stewed on that for almost two years because one day I wake up and one of the things is on my chest, staring at me with it's beady little eyes." He was pretty sure Rhodes' full body shiver wasn't fake - the guy looked pretty creeped out.
"I know. And I... I haven't been tryin' ta enable ya or nothin'. I just... I know ya been hurt a lot. Ya deserve ta be able ta come ta this in your own time, ya know? And if ya don't ever get there that's fine. The Defenders don't mind comin' here, and it was kinda mean-a them ta decide this whole thing had ta happen in that world."
"We really need to depart, Anthony," The note of adoration in his voice would be sweet if he wasn't a space god who had wreaked havoc on Earth - twice if you counted that whole Destroyer in Arizona or wherever. "Your... GPS," here Loki sounded deeply annoyed while Shellhead smirked unabashedly. "Might work, but there are limits. You're at risk of missing an important appointment."
." There was enough venom in his voice to make the idiot flinch back, but only for a second before he took an aggressive step forward. "And sure, there's maybe a passing resemblance--"
It was his teammates who really made all the difference in the world. There was always a pair of discarded ballet shoes and a few knives littered around the place that belonged to Nat. One wall was usually covered in the results of Clint's latest 'fun' arrows, and the archer also tended to shed his practice bracers, shoes, shirts and sometimes his pants across the floor as he walked to the showers. The only sign of Bruce's presence was the yoga mat tucked in one corner, but he couldn't exactly train with them anyway. Thor left scorch marks on the floors and walls, and after the eighth time he'd cracked and blackened a mirror Tony had refused to replace it. It stood as a testament to the god's presence.
Steve was reluctant to answer the knock to his door - he had been on the edge of falling asleep in his own bed for the first time in a week. Even at SHIELD medical he had only slept for a handful of minutes at a time, too worried about Tony to find any kind of peace. Now that he was safe and (hopefully) sleeping up in the penthouse, Steve had finally been ready to fall into the sweet embrace of unconsciousness.
. I just don't know where we could go where somebody wouldn't find us. As much as I love Rhodey and Pep and the other Avengers... it would be nice to not have them 'dropping by' and 'checking in' every few hours. And I wish Carol would stop asking if we want to help out. I know she's trying to help and get us back in the saddle, but--"
Well, he could sip a few drinks. Steve was great about keeping a scotch in his hand, though the mother hen also forced him to drink water and eat any available finger foods. He didn’t have the heart to point out that he and his liver had been doing this dance since he was fifteen. When it came to drinking he could take care of his own damn self, but… managing that gave Steve something to focus on.
"I do not need the Black Widow out for my blood, so I'll let it go. And I promise I won't say anything to Tones either. Just... I don't think you should worry about spooking him. He's not always the best at picking up on social cues either, so I hope your plan--"
"Not the time," he bit out as he fought for control of the suit. Before he managed, somebody else caught him - Shellhead, back from the evac. "If it's not life threatening, I don't want to hear it, okay baby girl? You keep your focus on your jobs."
Before the Avengers, dinner had always been pretty damn predictable. Fancy restaurants when he needed to dazzle, cold leftovers when he didn’t, shakes and protein bars in the workshop, takeout whenever Rhodey or Pep were there to eat with him. There was never any big debate - Pep and Rhodey had established their favorites long ago, and there was only half-hearted banter between them before they settled on something if they were both there the same night. J had long since memorized orders and phone numbers, and if he were being honest with himself Tony could admit that those lists hadn’t changed much since he turned thirty.
, and he did it loud enough that Tony began to 'helpfully' pound on his back. The added bit of contact didn't actually help at all. Neither did the way he could hear the peanut gallery snickering at him. It turned into a real cough quickly, until his eyes felt teary and his lungs were burning nearly as bad as his face. Tony was
"That's enough, I'm thinkin'." Steve interrupted again, giving his elbow another squeeze before his fingers slid down to tangle with his own. No matter how pissed he was at the invasion of his tower and the assholes doing the invading, he couldn't help but look down at his
“Eh-heh. Riiiiight. Creepy - I like it. And I’m not lying! So just tell me how long Iron Mom has been doing his… science… stuff.”
He got what he wanted in the form of a nod and a mouthed 'you big sap'. Beaming, he mouthed back a 'thank you' before turning the whole of his attention back to Doreen.
"Sure! I mean... yeah. Probably. Just let me check with Pep to make sure she doesn't need anything, okay? I'll come back in... ten minutes maybe? I'll bring food."
Steve knew who belonged to the arm that draped suddenly over his shoulders without needing to look. Winter had gotten better about allowing his combat boots to make a soft 'thud' to accompany his murder strut. Lately he'd been experimenting with beard oils and pomades - because of that he was always surrounded by smells that honestly had Steve wanting to try a few of them out himself. So he didn't crane his neck to look up at his friend, didn't startle or pull away. He leaned into the touch and sighed, face still tipped up towards the stars.
"No. But I didn't want to spook you and I didn't... I love being your friend. I didn't want to lose that by asking for more. So I figured..."
Instead he was answering the damn door in his Iron Man pajamas that he really hadn't wanted anyone but Thor to know he owned. The God of Thunder had been the one to buy them for him as a present, which was the only reason he had been allowed to live with the knowledge.
"Ah ah ah! No. Until we've all had one of those delicacies, you need to remember that we're all mortal. I know that maybe Steve here confuses you, what with all the muscles, but you still can't smack him in the head with MewMew."
"Should you attempt to hurt either of my parents, I will engage lethal countermeasures. I believe I could, as my sister would say, 'take you' Mr. Liesmith."
"Boy, have they done a number on you. Did they tell you that? Did they tell you that you couldn't be Bucky? I know that Hydra used you to do terrible things," Rogers was almost impressively earnest as he stepped towards Winter, and Steve almost felt bad for him. If he hadn't been ignoring every red flag Winter was throwing up, he would have really been feeling for the guy. "But it wasn't
"Uhm..." Damn it, he was blushing - he'd sort of hoped to avoid the whole thing during his eventual confession. But where he'd jumped the gun and cut off Tony's planned speech, Tony had jumped the gun by
"... yeah. Okay." Harley stepped on his hat on the way over to the bed but didn't even notice it. All his attention was on the injured, and it was very hard to believe the kid wasn't Tony's. Their features weren't a perfect match maybe, but there was a similar spark in their eyes and Harley carried himself almost exactly like his fella. He was pretty sure he could read the teen because he was so good a reading Tony, and he briefly wondered if maybe there were secrets that his lover had never told him. "We're supposed to have a connection."
"We're gonna strip the paint off this," Shellhead said carefully, eyes fixed on Tony's. "Because the shield itself is a goddamn work of art even if my dick of a dad forged it. Winghead's a thing of beauty when he uses it, and I hate that you never got to see him with it. I hate that what Rogers did tainted it for both of you. I fucking
Even if that wasn't strictly true anymore it still made the kid light up and give a playful salute. It was both sweet and a little concerning how damn open the kid was. He was going to get his heart broken that way... but it was also sort of refreshing to meet a hero with that kind of innocence. Maybe if he played this right he and Tony could be there to protect it.
"So why do ya look like ya been suckin' on lemons? And don't ya shrug at me like that, sweetheart. I wanna know what's goin' on in that busy brain-a yours. Whatever it is, it won't ever be so bad that ya can't tell me."
." She watched him a moment to make sure her point had made - it definitely had. Having all the Defenders and his other friends descend on them at once would be absolute chaos. Loki would probably love it, but no one else would have much fun. Once she decided he knew she meant business, she gave a brisk nod and then pressed a kiss to his cheek. "There's a luv. You're looking well."
Between his amazing tunage and the brilliant work of an underling about to receive a huge 'your brain is beautiful' bonus, Tony lost himself to the flow of the workshop. He would absolutely deny it, but whenever a pop song entered the rotation... well. Work went by the wayside so he could shake what his mama gave him. They weren't sparse because he didn't enjoy them, oh no. More than one or two an hour just tended to tank his productivity rate. It was just that the damn things were so catchy and
. Why the fuck he'd given that all up and come back Tony didn't know, and he was just lucky it hadn't all ended sooner.
He looked over, expecting to see a smile or at least a look of exasperation on Steve's face. Instead he was even paler than usual, lips tight and fists clenched in his lap.
Captain America paused halfway to the fridge, and Tony could read hesitation in his expression. He knew that look intimately.
During a period of downtime at Training Facility 3, an interview with Steve Brian Rogers (Maverick) happened to be playing on the TV in the common area. Instead of changing the channel or leaving the room, Rogers watched the interview and became more and more agitated. Rogers persists in the belief that Maverick is a clone or other 'trick' employed by Loki Laufeyson to 'control' Tony Stark. He cannot explain his reasoning or provide evidence beyond an insistence that 'Tony needs him'. Sharon Carter, a witness to the incident, called in Captain Danvers when Rogers began to formulate a 'rescue plan' that centered on the idea of abducting Tony Stark and forcing him to see the 'truth' of the matter. At the time of Captain Danvers' arrival, Rogers had laid out a possible course of action (a copy of which will be kept with this file, with the original sent to the Committee as they discuss further consequences) and had contacted several members of the team formerly under his leadership. Two of these, Wanda Maximoff and Clint Barton, Rogers had been expressly forbidden from contacting. Along with Sam Wilson, both will receive a Notice of Disciplinary Action in their files for their part in the incident.
, but I understand and I won't fight ya over it. If what he needs is for me ta stay away, then that's what I'll do." He'd seen the aftermath of what happened when Rogers' priorities had narrowed down to a field of one person. From what he could see, his other self hadn't even much cared what the other Bucky wanted. Rogers had just chased after his friend, determined to reclaim the past no matter the cost.
"On it da." Without being asked, Kamala let them go and stepped away, bouncing over toward Jess. That was a pairing he'd never understand, but the hard-ass detective gave the girl a fond smile before going back to completely ignoring Natasha. Meanwhile, Harley's armor was emerging and wrapping around the teen; Tony knew he could call forth his own, but he'd rather let his kid take care of him. "Come on. I'll get you home and we'll let Aunt Pep say 'I told you so' and then we'll go down to the workshop and blow some stuff up. Or we could watch a movie with Dum and U. But first you gotta stop breathing crazy so I can take you up into the air without you passing out."
"She's here when you're ready. I'll have my people call your people, set something up. Will that be all, Ms. Potts?"
, at least in the ways that matter. Honestly, if you and Winghead weren't so disgustingly happy I'd be suggesting you track the Loki here down and see if there's something there." Apparently his expression said all that needed to be said, because Shellhead started to laugh. "I know, I know. I just don't... I don't like the idea of him being unhappy, and from what Fri has told me he's got to be pretty fucking miserable."
Since Tiny Adorable Steve would be jumping in right along with him, maybe the Iron Man armor should be the second thing he worked on. His
None of that had been about affection. It had been lust and the joy of feeling someone skin-to-skin. Later it had been a habit and now a set of memories that sometimes made him cringe.
Video game turns were serious business at Avengers Tower, and there Tony was offering to hand his over. That prompted more blushing until it felt like his whole face and the back of his neck were on fire. "That's okay," he said quietly, knowing that his smile was too shy to be normal.
So I finally got rid of all that crap and started fresh again and am mostly happy with it now. Yaaaay. Now I'm gonna go do the same with the next two chapters and get them up before Friday - scout's honor!!
"Sweetheart." Tony started to blush under his knowing stare, which tickled him pink. "Ya built yourself a tower with your name on it'n he lives in Stark mansion. Neither of ya think small when it comes ta property or homes. He wouldn't be able ta help himself. Pegs'll find somethin' good that we'll both like. I trust her ta give us some options, then we could decide. So, do ya want somethin' on a beach?"
"No. I threw the remote at the TV. Antosha yelled." Winter's heavy frown showed how much that upset him. Maybe Shellhead still mostly ignored him, but he and Tony had formed a bond that nobody had expected. The two of them seemed constantly surprised by it, and he'd talked his lover through more than one existential crisis because of it. "If he doesn't want his things to break he shouldn't show people such trash."
"Hourly? Ya think I got nothin' better ta do than sit around'n write ta ya all the time? I'll run outta things ta say before a day's gone by!"
Who was tying himself to an old man about to be pinned and stitched together with printed tissue. It was a patch job that wouldn't last, and they were going to have to say goodbye before too much longer.
"You forced my hand, old man. My mom had to take time off of work to come check on you, only the diner wouldn't give her any. So she had to quit her job instead, and she's ready to take you up on your offer of helping her find something new. I figured that since you were the one who made us all worry, you should put us up until then. Fri took them and our stuff up to our new floor--"
"If I was just some... scheme-a Loki's, no way in hell you'd ever know until it was too damn late. Dunno about the Loki from this world, but Lokes is a clever sonuvabitch that could run circles 'round just about anyone he wanted. It's a good thing he's one-a the good guys now or we'd all be pretty damn worried."
He and Tony were going to be fine, and the soft kiss the man pressed to his lips before heading for the elevator only proved it. They'd had their first really hard conversation about the fallout from the ‘Civil War’ and they were still okay.
"I'm not sure that's a great idea. We don' want you to roll over and wake up to a Tappy pancake." Tony grinned when Doreen giggled, hands stuffed in his pockets as he attempted to look unconcerned about where this was headed. "But if he doesn't mind sleeping inside, maybe we could design him his own bed so he could sleep in your room."
“It wasn’t fine. You were uncomfortable - it was easy to see that you didn’t want them in your space like that. They shouldn’t have just assumed… I don’t care how many stories there are about your… uh... “ For just a second Steve seemed unsure, the hard edge of his voice softening to something more tentative. “Past? Anyway, it don’t give them the right to go touching you like that without asking. It’s just plain rude.”
He was pouring a generous amount of scotch into his glass when a hesitant touch to his shoulder forced him to acknowledge that there were other people in the room. It was his
"Yeah, well," feeling just a little hot and bothered he squirmed a little, then sighed and dropped a kiss to the top of Tony's head. "When I get ta touch ya like that again sweetheart, I'm gonna take hours. Right now ya can barely manage ta stay awake for half an hour at a time. Think it might be a while before ya can 'sex me up'."
"Nah." It cost him to sound so nonchalant, but he saw some of the tension drain from Winter's shoulders. "That was... it was a lifetime ago. For me too. Neither of us is who we were then. Sure would like the chance ta get ta know ya again though. Pegs seems ta think you're pretty swell, after all, and she's a dame after my own heart."
It was more frustrating to watch SHIELD provide his team with shitty weapons and poorly designed armor. He hated how bland and boring SHIELD's HQ was, hated that the team members who lived there probably didn't have much to do in their downtime. How the hell was Captain America supposed to adjust to the future when all he had around him was a series of white walls, stoic faces and people who treated him like he was made out of glass?
"FRIDAY received a suspicious package addressed to Mister Stark," Pepper interrupted in full-on Ice Queen of the Boardroom mode. "As there had been a recent attempt on his life, the package was destroyed as a matter of security."
Tony loved the twinkle of mischief in those blue eyes while he was fucking with people and they were too caught up in the legends about him to notice.
Their girl hadn't wanted to go with her metal brothers to the other world. She'd gone only after a lot of pleading and guilt-tripping; Steve thought fuzzily that it would probably take a while for her to really forgive them for it.
"No. Laney and my mom won't either. I told 'em they couldn't see you 'til later, so they're settling in--"
taking chunks out of the teams defending them. Well, except for the team taking on the guy who could move shit with his mind, the one who'd tried to tell them to 'rejoice' or whatever the fuck. Strange and Loki had enclosed themselves, Thor and the Hulk in a force field with what seemed like the strongest threat. It looked like a spectacular fight, one half-hidden in glowing gold and green, and it was the only space free of demon-dogs. Everywhere else? Close to a bloodbath.
"Nope! You don't get to absolve me of that sin, young grasshopper. It's one I have to live with and learn from. Fuck, being so zen is hard. We need to find you another mentor STAT."
, and Thor would have somewhere to stay when Jane kicked him out for disturbing her experiments. He could give them all that - he could give them a home.
Bruce had been doing so much better since he moved into the tower. Some of the tension had drained from his shoulders and he didn't look quite so hunted anymore. Tony had even heard him laughing a few times, and he knew his Brucie-bear enjoyed having a lab of his own again. They were becoming friends, which gave him a warm fuzzy feeling he refused to acknowledge (
"STAR? My brain's never concocted her before. I think it might be time to worry. Soon as you vanish I'll have to call Pep. Or, well, Vision'll probably be here soon. He usually visits early in the day before he goes to help Rhodey with whatever the fuck is going on with what's left of the Avengers."
"I only wanted to help you Tony," Rogers called in that sincere, plaintive voice of his. He had been giving into that voice, into the idea that Rogers was
little display, Loki looked up at the ceiling and smiled. "As I said - souls. I hope we never have to find out if you are right, young lady. I should hate to engage in battle with someone so helpful and delightful as you."
He wasn't sure. It was a strange blend of both positive and negative emotions, his thoughts tumbling over themselves as he searched for some kind of equilibrium. On the one hand, having people so firmly on his side was
Most everything else is plotted out a lot better, so I should be able to get on a regular(ish) for me schedule moving forward.
become one of the go-to placements for 'super-kids' that needed a home instead of Xavier's school or the Defenders training ground that was Stark mansion. Tony never stopped developing AI's either, which meant that at any given time they had a parcel of human and metal children calling them 'pops' and 'da'. Peter never moved to the universe that was their home; Harley never moved away from it. Despite that they all made it work, and their first two human sons were an important part of their ever expanding family.
Her hair still smelled like that cheap apple blossom shampoo she'd always loved. It was so familiar and comforting that it made his chest ache for a moment, remembering all the times he'd kept her safe from nightmares when they were little kids. Harley wondered if she knew that protecting her sleep had kept his own bad dreams at bay, wondered if he should tell her.
Because he was amazing and perfect, Steve didn't even hesitate to scoot away when Rhodey arrived on the scene. His platypus had a face like a thundercloud, tension coiling every muscle he had tight. Steve's concession meant that Tony could drag the man down between them and snuggle up to his side the way they had in college. Rhodey always breathed a little easier when he had Tony's head tucked under his chin, and he could feel that tension slowly start to bleed away. There'd be talking later, maybe even yelling... but for now it was enough that his brother was beginning to calm down.
"... fuck it. Fri-baby? Give the kid the same kind of access Harley has, okay? Just... just warn me when he gets here the first time so I can prepare myself to face him. I don't want him to think I hate him, and you're right Steve. I should be man enough to clean up my own messes."
"I know." He ran his fingers through Tony's hair as he thought, turning an idea over in his head. "Ya know... Shellhead'n them aren't bein' quite as smotherin'. And nobody in the media over there'd know ta interview us about what happened. I bet if we stayed at the mansion for a day or two ta give Lokes'n Shellhead a chance ta mother us, they'd prob'ly let us take a vacation after without any fuss."
