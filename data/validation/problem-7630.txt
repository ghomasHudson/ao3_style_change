He doesn’t understand how this is possible. He tries to summon the under suit, he tries to reach out for help through Extremis. He should be able to connect effortlessly to communication lines. To SHIELD, to the authorities, to Steve, to anyone—
“Whoever said laughter’s the best medicine has never had one of Jarvis’s famous Bloody Marys,” Tony says. No, that’s not right. He blinks. “Dirty martini. Whoever said laughter’s the best, you get it.”

Joe goes to the corner of the room where they keep the records of Tony’s vitals. He starts tearing pages from the binders. He throws them into the waste bin and drops a lit match into the basket. The paper catches flame with a hiss and a crackle, and the room starts to fill with grey smoke. Tony coughs.
Tony’s eyes widen. “I’m right, aren’t I? It’s true.”
Steve’s civilian shoes squeak on the white linoleum as he comes back to sit by the bed. Intuitively, he seems to realize how embarrassing it had been for Tony to ask, so he doesn’t look at him, or try to talk.
Fear played tricks on his nervous system. Shadows slid together, dancing inches peripheral vision. He kept his eyes fixed straight ahead; the light in the window of the jailhouse was his beacon. Any second Sheriff Rogers would burst outside and fire off a warning shot.
“Wait.” Frozen in place, Steve looks over his shoulder at Tony. “You can stay. If you like.”
The false Tony Stark steps closer, and in the moment— terrified and hurt, bleeding— Tony looks up at himself and thinks,
“Tony?” Steve says. He looks down.
He opens his eyes and tilts his head back, leaning against a rock beside the blacked skeleton of the pilot.

Tony wasn’t one to discriminate, these days. Company was company, and the drink certainly lowered his moral standards (as well as his standard for good conversation.) On Christmas Eve night, Tony would take what he could get not to be alone with his own whiskey-sour thoughts.
His dad is sitting beside him in the dark. He’s hallucinating, but at least he knows it, kind of. He feels a little paranoid. (It seems sort of real.) In the vision, his dad is old. Older than he ever got the chance to become in real life. Tony doesn’t feel like he looks much like him at all.
A week later, the curfew is pushed up again. 9 PM. CNN runs a piece about people being harassed by agents in the streets; the footage is horrifying.
The air sucks right out of Steve’s lungs.
Tony’s wondering the same thing on the inside; all the questions overwhelm him and he can’t get his heart to stop racing. The anxiety is suffocating— whether or not the
"You'd think," Steve says, "That you'd have the same taste. Same tastebuds, and all." It feels strange to speak about so cavalierly. The double. His time living here, in Tony's home, wearing Tony's skin. Steve thinks this might be the first time Tony has directly mentioned it in any form.
“Why, hello there, Captain.”
“You found me. So it worked,” Tony pointed out.
“What’s that supposed to mean?”
A wind blows through the burning lot, gently fanning the fires. It’s quiet, save for the crackle of flames and the low, distant groan of a structure melting in the building heat.
As he loses consciousness, he sinks into a dark fog, some endless night, where a dozen green hands reach down his throat and pull him apart from the inside out.
Steve replays that meeting in his head a thousand times, wondering if maybe he had made a mistake by ignoring a cry for help. He will admit that he has become obsessive; he has no defense to offer. He can't stop playing it out. He can't get Tony's voice out of his ear. He compulsively watches TV and the internet for any sign of Tony, to glean anything from his appearance. However, alarmingly, he spends the next few days conspicuously out of the public eye. Steve spirals; he wonders what Tony could do to himself, if he had enough fear, and few enough friends. On some level, Steve

Tony lies on his back, his burns arm aching but in a distant way, the broken leg numb and heavy. He takes casual inventory of the sensations mentally. Jarvis stands just behind Steve, just out of the spot of sunlight, holding a silver tray of martinis. Tony licks his lips, bone dry.
He is stupid.
He let his eyes fall shut. He tried to conjure up some image of God. All he can see is Tony.
He chooses his words carefully. Breathless, with a curious grin, he says, “Because I’m right. And I’m not the first to catch on. You’re not as—” he watches Steve’s expression, “
“Hope you learned yer lesson,” Tony echoed, wheezing out a satisfied laugh.
armor.
Tony spits in Steve’s eye. “Why don’t you say it again to my face?” He’s trying to hit him, swinging his arms madly, even against the screaming pain, but one just hangs limp from his shoulder like a dead ham, and the other is too weak to generate much force. “Fucking say it to my face, coward, what’re you waiting for?”
He crosses the floor and there’s a jarring echo as he pulls a metal stool up to the table. His body reacts with the revulsion and dread, as if he in the presence of a real corpse, and not just the lobster shell of a missing man. The rational part of his mind knows how foolish it is to feel so horrified by a piece of empty metal. The rational part of his mind, however, also knows that this
Steve surges in close, and kisses Tony.
He keeps repeating it, because it’s all he has to offer. There’s a sort of desperation, an urgent helplessness, that you feel when you find someone you love in such terrible condition. It’s a visceral reaction, something wired into the deepest, oldest part of the human brain. Steve would give Tony the arm off his body if Tony needed it to live, right now.
When Tony blinks, the sky is starless again. He realizes it was another trick of the eye, but then Steve says, “Yeah. Beautiful.”
“Well,” Tony said, grinning, “They might not get too far. I think they’ll have to turn back when they realize they left something behind.”
“Can I get you a drink?” Tony offers. “Bourbon? Vodka? Beer?”
But he can stop that son of a bitch who has been wearing Steve’s
The whites of his eyes gleam inky black, black all the way around like the devil’s eyes. He grins with too many teeth and then there’s the sound of a lock clicking shut; eyes darting down, Tony sees, now, that Steve had not been undoing Tony’s pants, but securing his ankle with the ground with a metal cuff and chain.
The golden stage lights look almost green in Tony’s blue eyes. He strolls up to the press podium and smiles at the cameras. He dazzles in the spotlight, perfect confidence.
“I need you to know I was always thinking of you. Even in the end, when— it was always you. Through all of this, the thing I was most scared of losing, was you. I knew we might never be friends again. Never partners. Never—”
“You’re good at that.”
He started to lose his balance and his body reacted, reaching out jerkily to grab onto something. The nearest something turned out to be Steve’s arm. Steve took it in stride.
Steve still cries, and he can’t stop himself. The feeling overwhelms him, it just comes rushing in and he drowns in it all at once.
He does not know how to cope with the realization that someone he loves is not the person he had believed them to be. Is the sin his own, in the tender eye of the beholder, seeing what he needs to see? Can Tony be blamed for not being who Steve always thought he was?
Goliath’s grave is vandalized and Tony does a broadcast about the importance of taking the high road. Moral integrity. Resilience of spirit.
his best friend, and not some parasitic replacement. It’s Tony’s eyes, looking up at him in stunned terror. Tony’s high-bridged nose, mashed to a pulp. Tony’s broken teeth, and viscous blood in Tony’s beard.
“Please,” Tony slurs through numb lips. “Kill me. Don’ leave me.”
He chastises himself for being too hopeful. He must not neglect due diligence. He remembers Tony teaching him how to trace messages. That feels like a long time ago, now. He sits there without breathing for a long time. It feels like if he moves, the mirage might break and the message will vanish.
Needle prick.
Tony recovers fast, then all bets are off. Everything goes unhinged. Everyone starts fighting, and Tony beats the living daylights out of Steve. He guesses he probably asked for it. The new armor is faster and stronger, and Steve hasn’t been on the receiving end of its power before.
Tony shivers. He doesn’t say anything. His eyes are impossibly wide, made even larger ringed with filth and soot and dark shadow. His pupils are blown out from even the tiny bit of light.
“Has the ever happened to you before?”
“You wouldn’t,” Tony says through grit teeth, staying as still as possible, riding out the pulsing wave of agony. It doesn’t go away, but the searing brightness dulls after a moment of slow breathing.
or stupid or limited to get why he’s right. Making mountains from nothing to avoid the problem that is right in front of them.

“Usually I make a fella buy me dinner first,” Tony joked.
long— Steve has no idea when the switch was made, what has been Tony and what has been done fraudulently in his name.
They talked for hours.
“You know me well,” he says, voice tight. “They have me by the short ’n curlies. I haven’t had an inch to breathe. I’m a figure head, and I’m ready to do whatever needs to be done to end this. I want to have each others' backs again, Steve.” He lowers his glasses to look at Steve, and there’s something heavy and unreadable about his expression. Steve's gone, of course. Tony's always known exactly what to say. Steve feels like Tony has gently pushed his fingers through the flesh of Steve's chest, between his ribs, wrapped around his heart. Squeezing. Warm. He can hardly breathe.
“We’re going to need water. I’m going to the crash to look for something to save it it.”
Drunk as he was, and already beat to hell, he hardly felt it as they kicked him in the spine, the ribs, the kneecaps. A well-placed boot to the gut caused Tony to spasm and gag involuntarily. He rolled onto his side in time to prevent choking on his own upchuck, but just barely. The hot and sour stink of it clung to his mustache.
Steve is there, in star spangled swim trunks. No, he wouldn’t be so flashy. Something plain. Tony puts him in a Speedo, too, then— because it’s his daydream, and admittedly, he enjoys the idea of Steve squirming to preserve his modesty. And he doesn’t start a crusade against himself, thinking about Steve like that. It doesn’t mean much; Steve’s a fit, strong, obnoxious person. Anyone would want to make him squirm.
“That’s okay,” Tony says, “I love you anyways.”
“’M sorry,” Tony says. “Sorry.” Steve’s face screws up in heartbreak. This isn’t about him, right now. He tries to put himself on the back burner. Whatever distress he’s feeling, seeing Tony like this, can’t compare to whatever Tony has been through. Still, it’s impossible to control his reaction when Tony’s blubbering apologies with vomit on his chin.
"Why are you here, Steve?" Tony says.
His skin is loose and paper-like. His ears ring, and it’s a welcome annoyance compared to the dreaded monotony of the silence. If he had the strength, he might try and beat his head against the ground to speed things along. He can’t find it in himself to sit up, though. And his head hurts so bad already.
“I think I’m going to try to climb out,” Steve says.
“Looks like you’re shit out of luck,” one of the outlaws said, striding up the steps of the porch of the jailhouse. His fat wallet jingled with every step, the smug asshole.
“Tony,” Steve breathes, frozen to the spot.
The world feels like it’s falling away. His ears ring and he nearly drops his binoculars. Everything changes suddenly, like a switch flipped. This is bigger than he ever considered. He’s gutted by the guilty
“I don’t understand,” Tony says. His lips move, anyways. His throat is far too dry for speech.
Steve smiles darkly.
productive, though. His mind feels like a wrung out, dried and crusty sponge. He’s scattered, unhinged. Terrified. Delusional. Is it mental illness, or intuition?
He knows that there had been trouble at home— in his old life— but it feels so trivial and far away now. Back when he was human, back when he had the pride and agency to get into trouble, he didn’t appreciate human contact. Now, he would do anything to go home. Whatever seemed insurmountable then feels like a road bump, now. He laments the waste of his life, and he feels quite sure he will never have the chance to go back and change things. It doesn’t matter how desperately he prays, chapped lips moving silently in the dark. He will never go home. He will never rest in a bed again. He will never see Steve again.
Who can he trust?
“Just a little,” Tony lied.
“Doesn’t make me a—”
“Seeing thing,” he bites out.
Goliath is dead, and Steve’s whole body is broken. He looks like Frankenstein's monster. His hair has been ripped out in patches. Sam had flown him out of the fight in time to get Steve medical attention. Even with the healing factor, he’s laid up for a while. He feels his shattered bones knitting themselves together, continental plates scraping ragged edges beneath the Earth’s surface. He’s missing teeth. He runs his fingers over black, spider-leg stitches.
Handle it.
What Steve knows, and what Tony does not say to the American people, is the truth. At that very moment, their friends,
“What is it?”
Steve stared at the money, and then stared at Tony. The three outlaws certainly would come back; it was a lot of money, and you couldn’t get far in the west without coin.
Steve sits on Tony’s chest as he gasps his last breaths and goes still, eyes open wide in empty horror. His face destroyed, blood everywhere. And he never turns into a skrull. He stays Tony, as if there had never been an imposter. As if Steve had murdered him in cold blood. He guesses that’s because he’s so scared that he’s just hunting down a ghost.
* * *
“I learned my lesson alright—” Tony grunted. A boot behind the knees toppled him. He landed in the dirt on his chest, wind knocked out of him.
A shiver runs up Steve's spine.
“I’m sorry,” Steve says, and he means it. Steve doesn’t think. He can’t allow himself. He brings the shield down one final time, with a wet crunch.
"Alright."
He says, “I took a big risk, coming here.”
In this lifeless terrain, Tony doesn’t expect they’ll be able to find enough material to start another signal fire, but he doesn’t say anything. He’s too busy moaning in wanton pleasure, mouth open, drinking rain as it lands on his hot, dry tongue.
, for him to lose all that careful control, or to make Steve, in all his stubborn fury,
“It’s an encrypted comm line, directly to me,” he says. He
“They’ll be back, Sheriff. Don’t you worry about that,” Tony said, sounding cryptic and pleased with himself. Steve didn’t look too sure. He put his hat back on, tipped forward, and looked out the window at the quiet night outside.
“Sure is a beautiful morning,” Steve said, sheathing his knife in his belt and straightening his hat. His sheriff’s star glinted as gold as his hair. “Was gettin’ yerself upright part of your plan, or can I offer you a hand?”
Spoilery, more extensive content warnings:
, he reckons. He swallows a mouthful of his own blood and the last thing he sees before the world slides away to dark, is a pile of rubble and a glint of red and gold.
He was pulled back to the present by Steve’s hand coming to rest on Tony’s arm.
He dreams about gold in his bones. Green hands cracking them open and sucking the light out, like the sweet flesh from a lobster claw.
Their conversation runs through his head on replay. He’d practically
There’s that feeling again, in his stomach.

“Oh. That’s not good.”
Then Hank gets tied up in the lab—fine— but the last straw, really, is Janet cancelling for ‘totally unrelated reasons’ just half an hour later.
In Tony’s opinion, card counting was not
“Prob’y not,” Tony said. Steve sighed.
“—Fuck, ow, yes, I can feel it.”
Tony closes his eyes, letting his head sink into the pillow. He’s ashamed, for a second, of how much better he feels with Steve sitting beside him in companionable silence. It’s better than he deserves, but he’s selfish enough to take it. He has a lot to think about tomorrow but for now, he pushes the thoughts down. Letting the drugs slide over him, he goes to sleep.
God, his head hurts.
not going anywhere, Stark,” Joe says grimly. He tests the needle, squirting tiny droplets of the substance into the air to make sure there is no air in the vial. The syringe is filled all the way. Tony realizes that he doesn’t think he’s ever been given such a large dose, that he can remember. It’s at least double his normal amount. Joe jabs it without ceremony into Tony’s neck and depresses the plunger.
If he was going to get murdered for cheating those bastards out of their money, and he really hadn’t cheated in the first place, he figured fair was fair. Their coin purses were heavy in his boot, and he weakly jostled his leg.
The sun rises, and the peach colored light floats in sideways through the east facing windows. In daylight, the wallpaper has a faded rose petal pattern. There are water stains on the rug. Steve sets up his laptop at the broken coffee table and plugs the communicator in.
Impact.
When Tony comes back down to Earth, he’s ashamed of himself. They don’t talk about it.
* * *
* * *
Tony said nothing.
When Tony sends an encrypted message through a private communication line asking Steve to meet him to talk about how things will go forward, Steve debates telling Tony to go to hell. Then Tony sends a second message, promising he’ll be alone and unarmed. Insisting that he just needs to talk.
Tony Stark appears on television a week later looking like a different man. His face is the same, and his voice. But his back is straighter, shoulders more confident. His hair looks freshly cut and slicked back. He does not shake. Steve knows Tony is good at masking, but it still strikes Steve as surprising. The Tony he had met just days ago had been held together with staples and bandaids, stuffing spilling out at the seams. That Tony had a long shadow and ghosts in his eyes.
"You'll get sick of it. You'll get mad again."
friends fight valiantly, and they follow the plan: cover Steve at any expense so Steve can get to Tony. They’ve suffered enough injustice to be on board with murder, even without knowing this Tony is an imposter. The thought is sour in the back of Steve’s throat. This murder-suicide mission has two purposes. Stop SHRA, yes. And to clear Tony’s name.
He thinks it doesn’t bother him, but when he opens his mouth to speak, he chokes.
Months pass.
“Get him fixed up,” said the bandit whose eyes Tony had spit in. He was beginning to regret that a tiny bit. Tony had a feeling that by ‘fixed up’, they didn’t mean lovingly tending to his wounds.
and Tony wants to cry.
“I was hanging mistletoe,” Steve said, and remembering what Tony had carved into the front door, “‘
He really sounds sorry. Steve just holds that card in his loose fist.
Steve climbs out.
He reaches for the door handle.
Steve realizes Tony hasn't touched a drop; he's just looking. His shoulders sag in quiet relief.
“Oh, God, look at you. You didn’t have to do that,” Tony says, grateful. He comes closer with a towel in his hand. “You can just set it on the ground, don’t worry. I’ll get it washed tomorrow. Here.”
“Apparently. Withdrawals, I’ll admit it. But it’s passed, now,” Tony says. The truth is, he’s scared shitless. Just because he has a rough idea of what’s happening to him doesn’t make him comfortable with it, and he’s never had to white knuckle it like this before. There has always been a silver tray of cocktails just the ring of a bell away, for Tony.
This, of course, is messy.
Tony tripped up the front steps and landed on the stoop, panting. His lungs burned with exertion; maybe Tony wasn’t in the best cardiovascular shape of his life. Didn’t take too much running to bang out a few metal works here and there, and drink himself into a stupor every day.
“It’s not too late,” Steve says.
"I just, always avoided it on principal," he says. He closes the liquor cabinet. "I guess some things are genetic. Funny, huh?"
Steve calmly follows Tony down the hall, into the large, modern bedroom. Something about the way Tony loosely grips the bottle neck between two long fingers makes Steve anxious. Tony quickly darkens the windows, and seats himself on the edge of his enormous bed. There’s a stack of papers on the bedside table. Tony sets his drink beside the papers, on a coaster. Steve glances around, and he feels like he’s seeing something not meant for his eyes. It’s incredibly intimate. What does Tony keep beside his bed? How many pillows does he use? How much dirty laundry is accumulated in the basket? What novel does he pick at when he can't get to sleep at night?
He pushes Steve off of him, forcing their mouths apart, gasping. “What’s this?” he asks. He wants to make Steve bend.
He’s dying anyways. What’s now, versus six months from now? A year or two from now?
It’s Tony. It has always been Tony. This matters so much to Steve and he had expected Tony to see that. And concede.
best friend’s face like a mask. He can kill the imposter of Tony Stark.
Their Judas comes in shining armor and his army, but Steve notices distinctly fewer of his actual friends on the devil's side. Carol is gone. Jen is gone. Reed. All of them. It’s mostly just Tony and SHIELD agents. That makes Steve feel marginally better. He tightens the strap of his shield, securing it to his arm. He’s ready to go down fighting, and he can hold on to the fact that in the end: it’s not heroes against heroes. It’s heroes against SHIELD and an imposter. God knows how many imposters. If they’ve replaced Tony, Steve has to assume any number of SHIELD and government higher-ups could be imposters as well.
“Of course, Sir, whatever you like. However, if I’d have known that you liked company of
—But a hand reached out swiftly and caught him at the shoulder. Tony swayed, regaining his balance.
When Steve looks for the broadcast online later, he can’t find it anywhere. It’s been taken down from every video sharing site. Like it never happened.
“You know I will, darling. You ought to put your winnings on it,” he says with a perfectly false grin.
* * *
“We ain’t done with you just yet.”
“We both did things we regret,” Steve says in a quiet voice. “Please, don’t tire yourself out talking about it. Not now, Tony. It doesn’t matter now. Later. You need to save your energy.”
“I don’ know how you can forgive me. I don’ know how to go back, I can’t face it. Don’ know what to
* * *
It is both harder and easier to keep up with what’s left of the resistance from afar. Steve can tune-in to their channels and spy through back door networks, but most of their communication hubs are dead these days. There is a little chatter, and Steve doesn’t know if that’s because they’re too careful to say anything of import over any distance after their encounter with SHIELD, or if they’re disbanding without him.
“All done! Easy peasy,” the nurse— Nurse Jenny— says with a smile. Steve murmurs something to her and she nods, and everything kind of goes out of focus for a minute, and Tony thinks he must be getting the good stuff through that IV.
Tony has been a thing for a long time.
In his nightmares, he brings his shield down over Iron Man’s face and crushes his skull and waits for the flesh to turn green, and the true form to be revealed. He can’t breathe while he waits for that green to come, nor can he look away. And in his nightmares, it never comes.
learned a lesson or two when they were kicking the ever-loving shit out of him.
But he waits. He doesn’t reach out through the encrypted comm line, even though he looks at the little number card every day. The paper has become creased and soft from being carried around in his pocket every day, and handled with such frequency. Steve has always had a thing about handwriting. Call him old-fashioned, or maybe a hippy-dippy artist at heart, but he thinks there's a lot of personality hidden in someone's penmanship. He doesn't buy into the bologna about being able to scientifically analyze someone based on their writing alone, but he thinks, there's something there. He stares at the string of numbers and the few letters and swallows every ink blot and flourish. The tiny smear where the ink hadn't yet been dry before Tony's hand passed over his own writing. Is the Tony he once knew
“I’m going to hurt you,” Tony screeches, “I
out of words. He’s tired. Supporting Tony in his recovery has been exhausting; Steve would do it again in a heartbeat, and doesn’t plan on going anywhere, but the burden they’re carrying together is enormous, and Steve’s shoulders are only so big. Tony was fundamentally broken, in some way he still can’t verbalize to Steve, or any therapist. Steve feels constantly helpless, and the joy of having Tony back and seeing things in the world improve is eclipsed by the feeling of being stuck in a new kind of hole.
“I’ll keep back the choppers, and that should give you cover for a minute. You won't have long. I don't know how long I can... Just. Get to somewhere safe. They’ll be looking for you.”
With so little information, and with no one to depend upon but himself, it gives Steve the perfect, all-consuming mission to lose himself in. Somewhere along the way, he stops feeling entirely human.
“I’ll keep the pilot company,” Tony says, once Steve is too far away to hear him, having gone around to the other side of the crash sight.
Steve isn't sure if it's funny.
“—I wouldn’t have come here if I didn’t need you. All of us need you. I have some pull, Steve, but not much. Enough. To get you in, and then you can do so much more than I could hope to. You’d be so much better. You don’t trust accountability my way? Fine. I’m not— I’m not sure I do, either. God, I don’t know what I’m doing,” Tony continues. He pulls at his hair.
"If you say so."
There was one small satisfaction. He’d be gone soon, but ever since he took up drinking the way he did, he had become wonderfully ambivalent about his own mortality.
The last night Tony spends in his own life is spent torturing himself. This is appropriate.
Tony wonders if Joe had been tasked to put him down; it seems like he’s taken it upon himself to make sure Tony suffers as much as possible on the way out the door, and there is no recourse. No one will spare a second glance into his cell and notice his heart still beating as they abandon ship. And he knows already no one will rescue him. (No one ever does.)
He doesn’t sleep often, but when he does, he’s become prone to slipping into deep, nightmare-filled comas. The nature of the work exhausts him to the bone, and when he lets himself close his eyes, his body succumbs quickly.
“Trust me,” Tony sighs, fishing his American Express out of his wallet, and trying to ignore the pulsing in his temples, “I’m paying for it already.”
Tony wanted to say,
“I got one word for you,” the scarred man snorted.
What happened to not wanting people to know?”
“I know. It’s okay. He’s dead. I know it wasn’t you,” Steve reassures. “Don’t worry about that now, okay? We don’t have to talk about it now. Let’s get you warm.”
Steve will wish he asked about those forces at play; it was as though Tony had some premonition of his own fate.
Tony considers lying. Steve might even believe him. Tony says, “It could be worse.” Not untrue.
— what’s happening?” He coughs midway through, the smoke burning his eyes and nose. This isn't good. His captors panicking has Tony panicking; he relies on them entirely to be kept alive, and he knows he ranks very low in the hierarchy of priorities, if there is some kind of emergency. He is a thing, expendable. He can be thrown away. His stomach clenches.
“Seems awfully convenient,” the man— bushy mustache, missing front tooth— grumbled. “Never seen someone have quite so much good luck right in a row.”
Except now there’s a hole opened up inside of him where ehe wants for something more than that. A deep, dark cave that has always been there, that he’s been too careful to fall into. There’s no clawing your way out, he thinks, when you fall in. When you catch a glimpse of what it might be like to be loved the way you never let yourself hope for.
Almost.
For a moment, he hates Steve.
Steve frowns. “Give it time. We’re going to be okay.”
Something about the way the smile doesn’t reach her eyes, almost undetectable behind the tinted lenses of her glasses. Icy green, stunningly beautiful, always somewhat cold— it doesn’t mean she doesn’t feel just because she’s got a certain kind of look about her. Yet.
He gets up and quickly disappears into the door on the far wall, presumably the master bathroom. Steve stands, uncomfortable and damp. Sticky. The spot on the sheets spreads, and Steve think of Tony’s giant, expensive mattress. He starts stripping the sheet from the bed before the moisture soaks through too deeply. He wrestles with the giant linen, but as he goes to untuck the bottom corner, he makes a startling discovery.
“Well. Alright, then. I’ll carry you,” Steve said, as if it was no trouble as all.
“Shuddup.”
“I can’t believe this.”
“Drink the damn water,” Steve orders, slipping into his Captain voice.
The room is dark and cold.
He kneels at Tony’s side, but with a breath between them. Tony looks terrified and disoriented, and painfully breakable. He’s has lost a lot of weight, and and every bit of it shows because he’s been left totally nude. It isn’t pretty; his skin is grey and mottled purple, covered in sores and cuts and infections. Purple, scabbing track marks litter his neck, over what look to be healed needle marks. The room stinks, and Tony is covered in soot and his own filth. His hair is so oily that it looks wet. And no matter how hard Steve looks, something about Tony is translucent. Spectral.
None of it makes sense to Steve. He wonders how much pressure Tony must be under from SHIELD to endorse such dystopian measures, and he finds himself thinking about him near constantly. Fluctuating between anger, confusion, and concern. More than anything, he just wants to meet again. He’s had a lot of time to think since their last meeting, and he regrets not asking Tony what he had meant about not trusting anyone. Whatever is going on, Steve won’t find out unless they can talk one on one again. And the more extreme measured pushed by SHIELD using Tony as their figurehead, the more questions Steve has.
"What can I do?" Steve asks. He feels useless at  times like this. When Tony is obviously suffering some loose thread of an alternate, more terrifying reality. But Steve can't help, if Tony doesn't let him. At times, it's irrationally infuriating. He has no right to be angry at Tony for with holding his own private horrors, and yet, it makes Steve feel so fucking inadequate and useless. As ineffectual as one of Tony's shadow.
Tony processes what was said.
Tobacco smoke curled toward the ceiling of the saloon in hazy ribbons. On this Christmas eve, most of the residents of Timely had better places to be than flopping like a fish at the bottom of a bottle, or clutching a handful of battered old cards. All but Tony, the sad sack of shit, and some gnarly out-of-towners. Wasn’t hard to tell outlaws from businessmen, and not many of the latter passed through Timely in the middle of the night. These three men were no good alright, but Tony was no good himself.
Where was the good Sheriff now, he wondered.
Steve’s jaw flexes. He says nothing, and the lack of denial is as good as a confession.
They’re still trying to do the work. Answering emergency calls for civilians, yes, but now they’re spending a lot of time responding to distress calls from other heroes. They’ve become an underground network, a last hope.
Steve blinks up him with a severe expression. “Why would I want that.”
“Better if I try now, while there’s light and the rock is still sort of dry, before—” But Steve is cu off by another crash of thunder, and a fat raindrop lands on his cheek. It’s too late. Dumbly, Steve touches the wet spot on his face and looks at his fingertip. He reaches his hand out to feel for droplets, and it starts coming down harder. Lightning cracks across the sky, illuminating Steve in white light for a split second, throwing flashing shadows around the cave. Tony remains tucked away in darkness, beneath an overhang where rock shields him from the rain.
“Seems so,” Steve said. He thanked the barkeep quietly and paid the man for their drinks— something Tony found bizarrely endearing. Of course Steve would have to pay upfront; the Sheriff didn’t have a tab. He didn’t drink often enough.
That isn’t to say that Steve ever unplugs from the news. He is obsessive, following any and every broadcast about the limbo-like status of the SHRA, now that its figurehead and the figurehead of its opposition have both vanished. Steve and Tony’s absences have shaken the world. Without leadership, it seems both sides have taken a pause as they regroup and figure out their next steps. Steve watches C-SPAN on stolen iPhones, and it appears that approval for SHRA has come to a confused halt in the wake of the news breaking that Tony might not have actually been involved with every step that the government
“Cat got your tongue? You don’t have to be shy, Steve. We’ll pretend it never happened. No one will know. Just because we’re fighting doesn’t mean we can’t make up just for a night,” Tony says. He speaks almost as if they’ve done this before, and that is
“Oh, I’m doing great.” He tries to sit up, forgetting his injuries until he puts weight on them; pain shoots through his body and he feels the color drain from his face as he bites back a strangle sound. “Actually, I’m feeling a little green.”
“Guess not,” he said. Steve looked apologetic.
“Don’t be sorry, Tony. It’s okay. It’s alright, we’re okay. You’re going to be fine. We’re going to get you home.”
“That’s what they all say, sport.”
It turns easily in his palm; whoever left here must have been in enough of a hurry to leave it unlocked.
He spends his days searching for Tony’s body. He spends his nights praying not to dream.
They brought him out into the middle of the desert. When the the horse finally came to a stop, Tony was just barely holding back seasick vomit. Rough hands on his body. Jostling. He was dumped unceremoniously on the ground. Electric hot pain shot through his chest, emanating from what felt for sure like a broken rib. He grunted.
“Just— until I fall asleep.”
The truth hovers, half said between them, electrically charged.
too tight and Tony hissed against Steve’s lips. Immediately, Steve let go and stumbled backward like he’d touched hot iron. Panic flashed across his features.
It feels a little personal. That’s always his problem.
* * *
“I don’t think help is coming,” Tony says.
“Please,” he says, and Steve wants to think he means it, “I know you’re angry. I know it’s an enormous change from the way we’ve always worked, but we aren’t living in nineteen forty-five anymore.”
for Tony.
go home.
"Is it real?" Tony asks.
“Had it all planned out, huh?” Steve said, voice softer.
“You’re in the hospital, sunshine,” Jan says, stepping into Tony’s line of vision. “Alive and well. Thank God.”
“Easy, easy, there, Christ—” Tony said.
"What're you seeing?"  Steve says, straightening his back. He tries to look where Tony's looking. All he sees is empty air.
,” Tony interrupts, miserably. “I don’t know what to do.
A slow, wheezing breath comes from Tony.
It all starts flooding back, then. Not everything, but enough. His strongest memories are of Steve, anyways. And Steve is all he needs. This he knows on a primal level, and the rest of the missing pieces don’t matter. It’s reflex, falling back on him.
Something better than blood flows through him. Something golden. Something
“Don’t say that—”
Time slides on without him. He senses missing large chunks of time, but that's as precise as he can guess. The track marks on his neck accumulate and itch but he can’t move his arm high enough in his bondage to scratch at it.
Tony has deteriorated rapidly.
“Another second and you might be dead.”
Looking up, Steve sets his jaw and tests a handhold just above his eye level. Putting his weight on one foot, he hoists himself up, balancing a foot off the ground on a narrow outcrop. Tony holds his breath. For a second, it seems like he could really do it, easy as that. He seems to defy gravity, like a spider on the wall.
Tony isn’t faring well; they both took damage in the crash, but it’s superficial on Steve. He’s walking like one side is sore, and there’s an ugly, bleeding gash already knitting itself together above his brow, but he managed to escape the fire unscathed.
Teeth bumping, open mouthed, it’s clumsy and uncareful— needy, Tony realizes with growing delight— desperation. Tony hasn’t allowed himself to give this scenario more than a guilty, passing thought until now, but it feels right. Steve’s lips are warm.
“She hates to lose a bet,” Janet says, and then, “Oh.”
He remains very quiet, leaning against the dugout in the ball field where they agreed to meet. Little League. He watches Tony walk up the field from the street, alone. He had promised himself he would make Tony speak first.
A lone tumble weed bounced across the horizon. He was alone. Where as Sheriff tights when you needed him?
“Why, though?”
Nobody answers. He imagines the sound of a vulture’s cry.
“Of course it’s a trap,” says the smooth, metallic voice of the Extremis armor, “How else were we going to get you all in one place?”
“Ah, God. Don’t go gettin’ used to it. Consider it yer Christmas present.”
Steve’s lip curls in frustration. “God, you don’t turn off.”
The heavy dose is paralyzing. He feels mummified. He hears carnival music riding in his ears, distorted and haunting and not real. Gravity pulls him down, down, down.
what exactly Tony could do to himself.
Tony sets a trap, and Steve falls for it. An emergency distress call, a chemical plant fire by the Hudson. Four hundred trapped inside. Tony knows Steve well and takes advantage of his nature. What kind of world does Tony create in which heroes ignore any cry for help? It shouldn’t matter what else is going on. Especially in the aftermath of Stamford, it feels like a slap in the face. He could implode with misplaced rage. So frustrated he can feel the red boiling up inside him, burning more hot and toxic than a chemical fire. Oil-slick rainbow in the flames; poison in his clenched heart. Accountability isn’t about registration, it’s about being there, responding to every call, and seeing things through to the end. Being there when the people need them, for the people who need them--  servants of the people, and not government puppets.
of these guys in his current condition: drunk, dizzy, disoriented. And he hadn’t touched a gun in a long time, so that was out, too. Even if he

Steve slinks home with wounded pride, still reeling from the turn of events. He can’t seem to cool down the burning heat in his ears and cheeks, and it’s more from the shame than from the fear of being caught out.
“I have that effect on people,” Tony said with a pained grin, leaning heavily on his crutch. A rush of warmth flooded through him as he watched Steve stare at him, touch his own lips like he still couldn’t believe what had happened, and then stare in disbelief at his fingertips.
The third man was huge and mute, and he glared at Tony with one eye twitching. He put out his smoke on the floor of the saloon.
The other details creep into focus. White walls and the a paper sheet crinkling under his squirming. There’s a sharp pinch as the IV needle rips out of the back of his hand.
He closes his eyes again.
Accessing the internal communications through Extremis is like riding a bike; Tony closes his eyes, and opens the private communication link between he and Steve. There are hundreds of short, one line messages waiting for him, flooding his mind as they all suddenly load at once.
Steve does that thing with his jaw again, thinking. Then he gently disentangles himself from Tony, and slides down. Tony watches him without breathing as Steve settles to his knees; he doesn’t seem to be shy.
Tony and Steve were the last ones there.
“Fi’ more minutes,” Tony mumbled. He wasn’t sure he really spoke at all.
too much a shift from the stuttering, paranoid mess he had been when they saw each other, that night in the ball field. The night Tony had given Steve that white card, which Steve still carries around like some kind of charm. Then there had been the off-color comment about the drink as if Steve would find it funny, and the sudden
“You’re fighting like you’ve got something to prove, Steve,” This Tony says, barely dodging the shield when Steve aims for behind his knees. He counters and fires up his repulsors. Steve rolls to the side and takes a blast to the shoulder. It had been intended for his chest. He hisses and barrels toward the armor, shield first. This Tony knocks him backward with an unyielding, metal fist to the jaw.
That, and the fact that deep down, Tony loves roleplaying as a hero right there next to the living legends of their time. Tony doesn’t admit that part.
The bathroom door opens and Steve flinches, fumbling to ball the sheet up in his arms so the blood stain isn’t visible. The impulse to hide this discovery surprises him, but he doesn't ignore a gut feeling.
Tony smiles, sad. “Give it time.”
The scent of Natasha’s perfume has dissipated, but it’s like she’s there hovering between them.
"The empty feeling emboldens him. Steve’s fingertips tingle. He swallows a lump in his throat and reaches over, gently taking the empty helmet and faceplate in his hands, the skull. He handles it delicately, like a faberge egg.
Tony does a broadcast about a humane new program called Resistance Re-Education Training, which he’s planning to implement in the prisons. Steve doesn't want to think too hard about what this means.
“You’re so dumb,” Howard says. Tony nods. “You just has to wait for the sedative to wear off, and Extremis will come back on. And you can call for help.”
“See you in hell, stupid motherfucker,” the mustached man said, and Tony couldn’t turn his neck to watch, but he heard the sound of the men mounting their horses.
There must not be one person on Earth Steve would less wish to be stuck with, not one member f the Ultimates more useless and abhorrent to him that Tony Stark— and Tony, sitting here looking like a Halloween decoration, is just grateful to have some cheerful company as he circles the drain.
Tony calls for help.
SHIELD’s investigation into the skrull invasion is so secret that the number of people working on it can be counted on one hand. Tony can’t say much about his experience without compromising the investigation, and while it’s obviously painful for him not to be able to distance himself from the atrocities committed by his double, there’s some level of relief, too, that he’s excused from explaining himself.
It has been at least a full twenty-four hours since Tony’s measly pre-flight drink, and he isn’t feeling well. He’s irritable. He’s anxious, jumpy. At least, with nothing in his stomach, the heaving has mostly stopped.
He catches an early morning bus across town because it’s less conspicuous than walking. He transfers buses downtown and gives five dollars to a homeless man who can’t seem to stop staring at his face at the bus station. He takes another bus, burying his face in the sports section of a newspaper for the half hour ride. He needs another transfer but he’s out of bus fare, so he walks the last leg of the journey. No one pays him a second glance.
The rain grows colder and he sees his own breath. It gets dark. Tony slips into some kind of shock, maybe. He feels real nauseous. He feels really sick. He’s shaking hard, and it’s in part caused by the cold. What he needs is a drink. God, to die sober. What a cruel thing.
“Think you’ve been out here long enough. You’re goddamn ice cold, and you sound like shit,” Sheriff Rogers said. The jostling started again. The ropes pinched and bit at him, even through his clothes, and his broken rib severely objected.
He tries to swing the shard of glass like a knife, but his arm goes offline and drops limply to the side. His balance shifts and the next thing he knows, the world rolls and rushes by. He feels the wind knocked out of him as he falls off the side of the bed and hits the floor.
The struggling tapers off. Steve releases his wrist, horrified with himself that it looks bruised. He hadn't meant to hold him so hard.
Tony throws a plate. It bounces off the wall unbroken and lands on the floor, wobbling. Steve doesn't know if Tony is here or there, but he's mad and there are tears streaming down his cheeks, but it does nothing to make him look less feral. Teeth bared behind stretched lips, moving like an animal. Terrified and infuriated.
Nothing else is familiar. He spends most of his time heavily sedated, fed only through a tube, without Extremis keeping him strong; his body has become a foreign thing. His ribs and sternum jut out beneath his skin, like rungs of a ladder. His shriveled stomach dips in under his ribs, and bits of his hair fall out from his head, his brows, his chest and stomach and pubic mound. Boxy sharp hips and gnarled, knoblike knees. He gets sores and bruises where his bones make contact with the ground.
* * *
That was about the point when he got dragged out the door and tossed out into the street. He landed in the mud with a wet
The cave fills with water like an unattended bathtub. Up to their ankles, up to their knees. The water is hot, and red, and thick. Up to his stomach, up to his neck— he tries to swim but he can’t move, anchored in place, screaming out his last breath as it overtakes him and his lungs fill with blood.
you little fucking piece of— he spit in my eye!”
Tony pulls back first. “Is this okay?” he asks, nervous. Steve can’t help it; he grins. The courage Tony’s shown, surviving everything he has survived, getting back on the horse, making the world better. Healing. Confessing his feelings. Being the first to kiss Steve. And yet, he still sounds like he’s ready for someone to tell him he’s bad at any moment.
“Can you sit up? Can you move?”
“Now, I know you don’t think of me as the most honest man. And god knows I’ve got a filthy conscience. But in my book, I really did win those poker games fair and square,” Tony explained, tongue in cheek, “So arrest me if I’m wrong, but you can
Tony goes still beneath him. Silent. The fighting around them has died down, too. The air is still and quiet, dark in an all encompassing haze of smoke. There is only death, here. Nothing lives.
“I’m glad you’re alive,” Steve murmured. Tony dared to look up into Steve’s eyes, and saw his pupils wide and dark in the low light of the street. And he saw something else, too. His eyes shifted focus and right above Steve’s head was—
Eventually, he thinks, they stop moving him. Time is hard to measure— it moves like a snake between doses of tranquilizer— but he’s woken up many times in a row in the same concrete room, and he starts to expect the familiar scenery.
He thinks about all the times he gave Tony grief for losing himself down a bottle; he thinks maybe now he understands better how desperation could drive a man to act irrationally. Irresponsibly. Steve feels like he's burning evidence as he closes out of the tracking window, and clears any trace of the search (to the best of his abilities) from the computer. He boots it down. The screen winks, black. It is like he was never here.
His head throbs, mouth a desert. “Steve?”
But it’s as futile as flexing a phantom limb. Nothing happens and Tony gasps for breath like a fish as his thoughts become hazy.
"Tony’s eyebrows pinch together, and he looks so baffled that he almost looks mad. It’s cute, the way he pinches his face up when he’s really thinking. That serious, furrowed brow. But then he swiftly throws his arms— getting stronger every day— around Steve’s neck, and he kisses him."
Steve looked over at Tony in the dim light with something unreadable twinkling in his eyes.
* * *
“It’s real,” Steve says quietly. “They’ll be happy to see you pulled through.”
Steve clamps his mouth shut, a vein popping out in his neck. He knows Tony’s right, and he has just enough respect not to snap back at the dying guy. Lightening his tone, Tony pats the ground beside him and says, “This might be the best thing to ever happen to you, Cap. You work too hard. Enjoy yourself. Relax. We’ll order mai tais and a message.”
“I found some of the fake stuff in the back,” Steve says.
Sam takes Steve by the hand and struggles with his weight, pulling him to his feet. Steve staggers. His strength is totally gone.
think this plan will split us down the middle.”
“You know I have to ask,” Steve says.
Tony pounded on the door, chests till heaving. Maybe Rogers was asleep at his desk.
And then, one day, it changes.
“Tony?” Steve says. His voice sounds so far away. Everything sounds off. Tony can’t tell if it’s still raining or his ears playing tricks on him again.
“Would you just stay a minute, until I fall asleep?” It’s a pathetic thing to ask. Irrational.
“Say it once more, this time like you actually believe it,” Tony says.
“—That’s two words,” Tony said. Oops.
,” Tony says, panic and anguish in his face. Steve pulls him closer. Tony tenses in his arms, and then relaxes.
“I do not enjoy bringing more grief to the family by making this matter public, but the resistance has forced my hand. The public have a right to the truth. And the truth is that the resistance have killed one of their own and in an attempt to frame SHIELD, in a publicity stunt to try and sway public opinion against the Registration Act.”
that Steve almost regrets the EMP.
“Let’s not pretend not to both know why you’re here,” Tony says in a low voice.
Tony Stark is a skrull.
“Of course, of course. You girls have fun. Get yourself something pretty, on me,” he says.
“Please, Steve. Just, trust me. I just want to take you to my place. I have some things to show you. I think you’ll want to see. I’ll turn off the surveillance cameras in my place. They wave me right through the checkpoints, perks of the job. And the windows are tinted. No one can see into this car. We can take the stairs, skip the elevator.”
“I’m fine here.” Oh.
It ends with Steve counting his broken bones again. It ends with one of his arms numb and blood filling his lungs and his uniform shredded down to flesh, bodies littering the ground. Steve can’t stop to take their names. When he gets an opening, he takes it.
Steve kisses him on the mouth, and then pecks his forehead. He never wants to let go, but he thinks, there’s going to be time. There’s forever in front of them. He’s not going anywhere.
He forces his eyes open after a long while, and doubts if he even managed to open them: the room is total blackness, just as though his lids were still shut.
the outlaw exclaimed, stumbling back. He wiped his eyes with his sleeve in disgust.
helmet down with a sudden sense of revulsion with
Steve cleans Tony's bed sores and bandages them every night. Runs his fingers over jutting ribs, frowning. He hounds Tony about following the nutrition plan, and Tony acts annoyed but admits to constantly forgetting. Steve remembers things that Tony forgets, and Steve doesn’t mean to think too much of himself, but he gets the distinct impression that his constant presence makes it a little easier for Tony to maintain his sobriety through the troubling months, too.
“What’re you looking at?” Tony says, staring into the empty eye sockets of the skull. It stares back at him, jaw hanging at a sickening angle. “This is your fault, you know.”
He tries not to dwell on it, but he tries to check with Tony more about small things.
It goes without saying, Tony thinks, that it’ll be a body recovery mission. Then again, Steve is just charmingly naive enough that perhaps he really believes there’s some long shot that he’ll find help and get them back here in time.
Here’s what Tony inexplicably knows, and wishes he could forget: if it had been Natasha with him in that cave, she probably wouldn’t have been stupid enough to come back for him. The odds were against him, and Natasha is a pragmatist before a sentimentalist.
Tony ordered another drink to Steve’s disapproval, pounded it, and then the story unfolded.
It matters.
“I come to you all today with tragic news. The anti-registration rogue, known as Goliath, has died,” Tony says, somehow lacking the dignified solemnity and self possession he had displayed in his last TV appearance, with that mother.
Reeling, Tony touched his lip; it was bleeding something awful. The three men circled closer, towering over him, their faces in shadow.
“Sounds like we’re going to get more weather,” Tony says with a grin. He’s starting to lose the thread, a little. He tastes blood on his teeth and he knows he must look ghastly, smiling like that in the dark. There’s just something intangibly humorous about the situation. You have to laugh, sometimes.
Tony has fallen asleep with his head against Steve’s chest. Steve thinks,
Not soon enough.
That, and his own nightmares and neuroses haven’t gone anywhere just because Tony’s going through something worse. It’s a delicate balance that he finds himself perpetually misjudging. Overextending himself, and then feeling the worry too hard when he feels in the dark. It would be easier, he thinks, if they could just enjoy a little peace together.
“Now you’re getting it,” he says. Tony pauses.
You’re leaving?” Tony says. He realizes a moment too late just how pathetic he sounds, and he wonders how full of drugs he must be to lose his edge. He’s briefly acutely aware of how he must look from the outsider’s perspective: the eccentric wealthy playboy with a losing personality and just enough medical issues to catch himself a hot wife, with a mile long pre-nup and will agreement. It isn’t like that, with Natasha, of course. He knows it’s not about the money with her, but he could see why people might think it. Sometimes, it seems like she doesn’t actually like him that much.
He tries not to let it show. “Doesn’t make any difference. Bad news wither way. What do I know, I’m no a doctor,” he says, “Luckily I’ve got the lovely nurse Rogers to care for me. Too bad you don’t have a little outfit to suit the part. Or a sweeter bedside manner.”
“Mistletoe,” Tony breathed.
It turns out to be okay.
Tony doesn’t know how to respond, and for some reason all he can think of is Natasha, perfectly made up. Dry eyed. Detached. It’s irrational, the feeling that she had somehow been disappointed to see him. She had been here, after all. It’s nonsense to think she hadn’t wanted him to survive.
“Not yet,” Tony says. There’s no moon tonight. “It’s a lovely night for a walk.” Tony’s more half limping, half being dragged than walking, but Steve’s mysterious ankle injury seems to have healed enough to put some strength back in his step.
A faint rattling sound startles him. It sounds as though it comes from directly beneath his feet.
He slips back into his room to get dressed. By reflex, he reaches for the blue cowl. He deliberates. Something compels him to loosen his grip and let it fall softly back into the drawer. This isn’t a mission for Captain America; it’s one for Steve. He leaves the safe house, paranoid but undetected, wearing a worn leather jacket and a ball cap. This seems to be becoming his regular attire for midnight trysts with Tony. A shiver runs up his spine as a cold breeze reaches beneath his jacket.
“Charming, obviously. Large and in charge, you know the type, you almost pull it off,” he says. Soon, his own voice will be all he has left to keep himself company; Steve’s going to leave him here. “Serial womanizer, who can blame him. Alien chicks are kinky. More legs, more fun.”
. His hand had tremored, and Steve’s expression in the dark had been impenetrable, and disgusted. It had been an embarrassment. Pathetic.
“That I’ll keep my mouth shut, you mean?” Tony asks. It comes out much sharper than he intends. “I’ll be you were kind of hoping, just a little bit, that I’d stay brain dead in here, huh? Just to be safe? What happens in the cave stays in the cave, and all that? I bet you’re pretty disappointed. Heaven knows I would be, if I were you.”
It’s a hell of a way to get the world on your side. The deaths are all still so fresh in public memory, and Tony and his team capitalize on that. Steve thinks it can’t possibly get any more debased and amoral.
Steve’s eyes feel hot. His vision blurs. He blinks it away and breathes slowly, willing himself not to lose it. Even if Tony is dead, or gone, and the armor is just metal, it feels important that Steve say all he has to say. He must get this out.
Here are the facts as Tony knows them: it’s his fault that they’re in a hole. It’s his fault that Steve is uncomfortable around him. It’s his fault that—even without his injuries— he would be totally useless, in the throes of alcohol withdrawals. The icing on the cake is the shame that comes with it, hands shaking, nauseous, every jumbled train of thought running through his head seems to come back to the image of an ice cold martini, a sickening thirst burning inside of him that cannot be sated with what little water they have.
“I had a drink this morning, I’m not going into withdrawals,” Tony says. It’s not that he’s proud— Steve should be able to smell the tequila in the sick puddle.
the real Tony.
“Don’t push yer luck.”
Too little. Too late. And now he’s here, begging forgiveness in a crypt.
* * *
“I’m leaving,” Steve says, gruffly. Too late to save face.
and behind bars, Captain. I’ve had enough of your shit. Enough of your meddling. You think you’re so righteous? You’re arrogant, and pathetic,” he says, and he throws Steve through a brick wall. Something else breaks. Steve’s breathing is severely labored. He lies in wait; he does not rise.
With Extremis, and the power of modern medicine, Tony recovers physically in a few weeks, enough to be released from hospitalization. He’s still real thin when Steve sees him make his first re-appearance on TV, and he still walks like every step exhausts him. That far away look in his eyes appears when he’s not talking, and Steve wonders what Tony thinks about when he drifts away like that. In a sick way, it’s almost comforting to see him like this, in contrast with the memories Steve has of the skrull Tony strutting around with that sickening bravado. Tony doesn’t say much on the news, and he only answers carefully vetted, pre-planned questions, and Steve knows why.
kind, I might have mixed up something a little more… fruity,” Jarvis says, lip curled judgmentally at Steve.
“You—” Tony wheezed, “—think I’m smart? Well—
“Fine.”
At long last, Tony was left alone. His killers left him to die, and all that remained was the lingering scent of tobacco and the fading drum of horse hooves against the earth.
There’s a streaked, dried, bloody hand print along the bottom corner of the bedsheet. Dark, rust red, unmistakably blood. It wouldn’t be visible unless one was on the floor, practically. How could that have gotten there? And Tony keeps his home so meticulous. It doesn’t seem like him to ignore such a stain, if he knows of its presence.
* * *
Steve clears his throat, visibly uncomfortable. Unlike the girls, Steve looks like he hasn’t had a full night of sleep in a week. Tony notices a few things at once: his shirt’s on inside out, the tag sticking out just under his chin, and there are dark circles under his eyes. Despite having obviously showered, he hasn’t taken the time to shave— light blonde stubble has grown out all over his jaw. It’s funny looking.
“I’m fine.”
“You’ll find out for yourself soon enough,” Steve says.
It gets easier when he lets himself acknowledge that he needs Tony's company just as much as Tony needs his, and that they're both vulnerable right now. But he isn't any more likely to fix Tony than Tony is to fix Steve.
it’s a body retrieval mission, but some part of him has held out a modicum of hope that there’s a chance Tony is still alive, somehow. It’s stupid, and childish. Maybe intentionally self-delusional. Maybe Steve doesn’t know how to do anything without making it out to himself that it’s a for good cause.
“Okay,” Tony says. “Good.”
possible death. His allies see him as little as his enemies. At this point, he can’t be sure who are who, anyways. Every night, green eyes haunt his short, restless fits of sleep, curled up in abandoned buildings, safe houses, sewers.
Tony always looks off in his broadcasts, too. Strangely rigid in some ways, yet simultaneously too comfortable in his own body, too pleased with himself, too smug. He puts his name on every horrible act, his new brand of philanthropy. He’s got his fingers so far down SHIELD’s throat that Steve can’t tell if it’s SHIELD pushing Tony around, or Tony pushing SHIELD around, anymore. It’s too hard to get a read on any of it from such a distance, and the feeling is only made worse when Steve recalls the last time he saw Tony in person.
“Don’t strain yourself.”
“I can’t stop it. It isn’t that simple. You have no idea what forces are at play,” Tony says.
“The only way this is ending is with you
He scrubs his hand over his unshaven, hollow face; it’s nonsense. It’s the drugs. It’s the tumor. The withdrawals. Hell, call it a trauma response, baby duckling imprinting on the man who sucked his dick and dragged him out of hell alive. But he couldn’t love Steve.
Tony thought,
months earlier
the real Tony at all. Perfect confidence. Shining facade. Tony’s real armor has always been his TV-smile.
“Are you okay?” Tony asks.
He sits there sobbing over Tony’s
Tony tilted his head, a slow smile spreading across his face.
And he thinks it long enough that his dehydrated, sensory deprived mind conjures the sensation of his flesh crawling away. Despite the total absence of light, he watches maggots crawl across his arms, and he feels mushrooms sprout from his mouth.
Not making problems to further political gains.
“Aye, aye, Captain.”
The truth is, he’ll never know.
“Waste of time,” Tony says, then he chuckles, “Beam me up, that’d be faster. Beam me up, Scotty.”
“I don’t know, either,” Steve admits. They had made a mess of things. There is nothing but a mess to go back to. “But, I know we’ll figure it out together this time. I can’t lose you again.”
It isn't okay.
“I thought we were out of butter.”
Steve breaks in through a low window in the back. He gingerly pushes in the shards of glass clinging inside the frame. He swings himself over the sill and his boots land on the shattered pane, glass crunching beneath his soles. Dust motes swirls, micro galaxies, in a sunbeam around his head.
He had spent his morning on the bathroom floor smelling his own vomit, and he isn’t exactly proud of how fast his mood had plummeted into a dark and lonely place. A man in his position should be better adjusted to the crippling despair of perpetual loneliness, chronic illness and the expiration date stamped in red on life. Sobbing in the fetal position in his underwear, and spitting up bile, the only thing that had motivated him to scrape himself up off the floor was the fact that the Ultimates
“On second though,” Tony said slowly, “Why don’t you walk me home, after all, Sheriff? And maybe… see me safely up to bed.”
“How bad is it really?”
And a happy New Year.
A white pain bloomed in Tony’s chest.
Steve sighed and bit his lip. “I tell you, what I really would like for Christmas would be a chance to get at the bastards who did this to you—” he said, “—Even if you
“Are you alive?”
“Is that supposed to be a joke?” Steve asks. Tony’s brow twitches, and then he plays it off with a laugh.
Steve hangs up on Tony before he can argue, and for a moment, Tony wonders if he should have taken the chance to get off the hook for the day. Call Natasha and talk her into a quickie at the hotel airport, maybe a little roleplaying of another kind that would surely be more fun than a tense transatlantic flight with Captain Red-White-And-Blue.
Another set of hands held his ankles as he was wrapped round and round in rope. He tried to beckon back the sweet oblivion of unconsciousness, but the pain was too intense to escape from. He felt his own sluggish pulse in every bruise, and the rails pressed into his back and shoulders in all the wrong places. Cold, black iron.
people, non-hero people. There’s blood. Broken teeth. Weeping.
“You always are,” Tony says, his smile the color of ash, “Until one day, you aren’t.”
Tony looked over his shoulder one more time; a horrified chill ran down his spine. He couldn’t see their silhouettes anymore, but he knew that they surely hadn’t given up their vengeance. The knowledge of an unseen threat flipped a switch inside of him, starting his adrenaline pulsing. He was still intoxicated, but the world had taken on a sharper quality. The chilling clarity that came with danger. Tony broke into a run toward the jailhouse.
personal— are larger than any politics. (Smaller than anything public.) Steve feels like he and Tony are the only people on Earth, and he feels like Tony is trying to hurt him on purpose.
Steve recoils. Tony has hurt his feelings. He should feel sorry, but he’s too vulnerable; the only way to regain control here is to lash out. To avoid being hurt, he hurts Steve first. That’s how real men do things. That’s how Tony and Natasha do things. That’s how Tony has always handled relationships. It’s about control.
No reply. He crosses the floor, and peers into the empty living room. He finds an abandoned office. A rotten sitting room. A walk in closet that even the mice have abandoned. The only sign of life is a recently deceased spider on a dusty windowsill. His hopes begin to sink. It’s too quiet for anything to be alive here. It doesn’t make sense.
“Yeah. Not funny? Maybe it's too soon. I do have root beer, though, and coke.”
And then the sound of the rain drumming against stone starts to sound almost like a musical instrument. Tony’s an intelligent man, but he isn’t the expert on cave acoustics. It isn’t foolish to think there could be an unusual sound effect produced by rainfall just in the right position causing a sort of twinkling sound. Tony cocks his head, straining with a curious expression to listen.
“Shuddup,” Tony groaned. “I got a broken rib. Cut me some slack.”
He lands, wobbling, on the rubble. It crunches under his feet as he steps closer to loom over Steve. “You’re like a roach, aren't you? Hard to make you stay down, little insect. Maybe I should put you down for good.”
He arrives to the street he traced the message to. The neighborhood is mostly abandoned. The windows of many of the houses have been covered up with graffiti’d plywood, and the inhabited ones have curtains drawn tight, and chain link fences between the street and the front door.

crazy, or that people will think so. He feels unstable enough that he might not know the difference. Right now, a lot rides on his being competent and capable, or at
that they can come out the other end. If they can just talk, privately, then Steve knows he can talk sense into Tony. Tony is smart. Tony is loyal-- at least, he has been. There must be some misunderstanding. Some gap in their understanding of the situation. It is the only way Steve can rationalize Tony taking the wrong side. They have had their struggles in their past, but Steve implicitly trusts the bond between them, forged by years of breaking and healing. They’ve shared more battles against common enemies than against each other. He tells himself, Tony has simply lost the path. He has a good heart. He can be corrected.
It lands in the rubble several feet away.
* * *
“Okay. Thank you,” Steve says. That’s all he can say. There are no words that could approach the debt Steve owes to Sam. Sam claps him on the shoulder, and gives him a squeeze. Steve watches his friend’s wings unfold as he prepares to take flight again. The silhouette of a helicopter crawls by through the orange glow of flames shining against the haze.
Steve’s startled, but then he shuts his eyes and leans into his, his hands going to Tony’s waist. He doesn’t feel like a skeleton anymore. He feels like a man, a substantial person, real. Warm. Whole. Steve’s not afraid to break him. Tony’s mouth is warm, and the tickle of his mustache makes Steve’s nose wrinkle involuntarily.
It’s just a joke, and Tony isn’t even thinking, so he’s caught off guard when Steve reacts.
“—It’s time we make a stand,” Steve says. He looks down. “We have to kill Tony Stark.”
“I appreciate you coming. I know I chose the place but— now I’m not—Can we go somewhere more private to talk?” he asks. Disjointed, distracted. Steve wonders if Tony has been drinking. It’s a cruel thought, but not nonsense, given the way he’s acting.
The suddenness of the movement snapped him out of his half-awake state. The ringing began to fade and reality came into clearer focus. Tony’s eyes were still shut, but he could make out the sound of unamused, breathy laughter, somewhere just above him.
His heart leaps into his throat.
Ha. Take that, brain tumor.
“Then let’s fix this," Steve breathes. "I told you. It’s not too late for you to stop this. You have to help me put a stop to this." Tony nods, slow, thoughtful. Then, he moves. He goes to the black car parked a few feet away, his expensive shoes squeaking on the wet dock. He opens the passenger side door, and gestures with his hand for Steve to get in, like a gentleman.
“I just mean, Steve, it means a lot to me. I’m sorry. I don’t know how to act around you. I was nervous to see you tonight. And I'm just surprised, after everything I've put you through-- that you'd still. Well.”
“Shoot. I’m sorry. Guess I forgot,” Steve said.
“I’m sorry,”
Tony's lips part, and then close.
“Easy, Christ. Buy me dinner first.”
“Don’t be stupid.”
When exactly had the change been made? At what moment had Tony stopped being Tony? What could Steve rightfully hold him culpable for, and what sins were committed by his double? The uncertainty makes him feel like he’s losing touch. He’s distant, and distracted. His team notices. Steve doesn’t know what to tell them. He doesn’t know who to trust.
At some point, they seemed to realize this. Steve looked around the wreckage, assessing the aftermath of his hard work. Streamers littered the floor, empty glasses on every table, peanut shells and cigar stumps and orange peels. Tony wondered how much Steve had to pay and plan in advance to get a crate of oranges for the night. Tony suddenly felt an ache that had nothing
a strange enough way that Steve could tell the difference between it and any forgery.
Bruised, next-day knuckles and clenched jaws and radio silences, checking compulsively for some change that doesn’t ever come on its own, friendships grown apart, funeral bells, grave soil. Even the hottest fires burn out eventually, self cannibalizing. All that remains is ash. Nothing left to rekindle.
Steve thinks about harming himself in some Catholic style repentance, there is a dubious, one-sided kiss between Skrull Tony and Steve, Tony experiences body horror/torture which is depicted rather graphically on screen, Tony experiences psychosis and loss of touch with reality and has distressing hallucinations, including of implied off-screen child abuse, and a hallucination in which he is decaying, depictions/discussions of weight loss and later weight gain, Steve has graphic nightmares of committing violent acts which include gore, Tony has suicidal thoughts during his time in captivity, mentions of alcohol/alcoholism. This should cover it.
They walk for a long time, in hopes of seeing something that could be used for shelter, or signs of life. The rain stops, but the ground remains wet and the air cold.
Call him crazy; he’s sure someone has been watching him.
Instead, Steve gets mad. He thinks about how Tony always does this. When people don’t agree with
Steve is so mad he sees red in the moment. It’s strategically brilliant, of course; there is no integrity in it at all.
He panted, short, labored breaths forming silver clouds in the freezing air. Desert winter nights weren’t balmy; the mud shimmered with ice crystals in the moonlight. Chest tight, he dared a glance over his shoulder.
Steve shrugs, but there’s a pleased smile pulling at the corner of his mouth.
The rain smothers what’s left smoldering of the jet fire.
It is, perhaps, a new low for Tony. Having survived the crash, he crawls back into the burning wreckage, looking for something. His phone? Something to build a signal with? The radio? No. In that moment, nerves fried, adrenaline blunting logic, Tony is looking for the flask he had seen clipped to the pilot’s belt.
And his palms bleed.
“That’s what you get, huh?” Joe says, glancing over his shoulder as though someone might come in at any moment and tell him off. “We don’t need you anymore. You’re disposable now. And we only have time to take what we need.”
Timely was a ghost town, on Christmas Eve. Those who had families were inside their homes with their loved ones. Those without families were resting up for the festivities tomorrow— Sheriff Rogers had spent damn near the entire month of December planning some kind of Christmas day dance.
Save for a few tipped over filing cabinets, and abandoned electrical extension plugs, the house is empty. His footsteps creak, the only interruption to the eery silence. It feels like someone might pop out from around a corner and yell
The curfew goes into effect.
The armor says nothing.
Tony steps first, and despite the rain having subsided hours ago, the ground is slick. He pitches over the side in near free-fall. If the ground had been dry, maybe Steve would have been able to keep them both over the edge, gripping Tony tighter reflexively. Maybe if Steve had let go of Tony, let him fall, Steve wouldn’t have fallen himself.
* * *
“Not at all,” Steve says. “I’ll take it as a compliment. And I’ll enjoy the quiet.”
“I’ll pay,” he said to the barkeep. Then, to Tony, stern, “Just this once, Stark, it’s on me. And don’t get used to it.”
Just when he thinks the agenda is settled for the day, it rapidly goes to hell. It’s not even a real mission; the Ultimates had been scheduled ahead of time to do a short tour of some speck-on-the-map European country, shake some hands, and make nice with a certain foreign dignitary. Incidentally, the very same foreign dignitary happens to be the last on Nick Fury’s wish-list of politicians in not-yet his pocket. Regardless, it isn’t meant to be such a struggle.
Here is all the art meant to accompany this story!
He hopes Steve at least got to eat an orange.
(In hindsight, Steve will find it funny that Maria came to
Then his phone rings, and the choice is taken from him.
The crawling, creeping feeling eats him away to nothing. He struggle to focus his mental energy in any other direction. Put himself into the work, put himself into charity, put himself into constantly fiddling with Extremis. Making notes, dreaming up improvements. He's never been
It’s dark and Tony’s lagging; he hadn’t noticed just how much he’s slowing them down until he stumbles and Steve doesn’t even break pace, just keeps dragging him along.
Tears rolls down his cheeks, his eyes sting and he grinds his teeth. The sob builds inside of him like volcanic activity. The pressure becomes unbearable. The grief is more than his Pandora’s box can contain.
the life back into you, that it would be a lawsuit waiting to happen. A lawsuit. That’s what they were worried about.”
He packs his things, and forces himself to move methodically. Think rationally. He washes in the rusted bathtub with water from his jug, and shaves in the dusty mirror over the sink. It isn’t for vanity’s sake; if Steve intends to waltz into a residential area, and if he intends to get there quickly, he’s going to be seen. He can’t wait for nightfall to move in the over of shadows, slinking from alley to sewer to riverbank. He has to blend in.
The clouds have begun darkening again, and ominously, as though to emphasize Tony’s point, thunder rumbles in the distance. When the wind starts, it skims the mouth of the cave and creates an empty howl— like the sound produced by blowing across the rim of a bottle. It makes Tony feel sick again.
“Just doing my job. Surprised to see you on your feet so soon, to be honest. I would expect you to be resting. Does the doctor know you’re out of bed?” Steve said. Tony leaned his crutch against the bar and grimaced as he carefully slid into his seat, keeping himself as straight-backed as possible.
Tony panics, but he can’t breathe well enough to hyperventilate. The lack of oxygen sings in his chest, counting him down to unconsciousness. His mind spins and slides like a broken gyroscope. He slumps onto the bed, muscles giving out on him, one by one. His body is failing him and the white, screaming panic of being trapped in a broken body is all too familiar. A doomed passenger.
to burn out the sense memory of beating Tony Stark’s face to a bleeding pulp in the streets, the rasp of his last breath taken under the weight of Steve’s body pressing down on his lungs.
But it might mean something.
The thought that he keeps coming back to is that Tony isn’t who Steve thought he was, maybe. The Tony Stark that Steve

Tony snorted, “I don’t think he remembered you existed, when he ran off with the missus.”
he feels; it’s a genie wish come true. Steve had wanted nothing more than for this Tony not to be
Steve’s beard grows in and his hair gets too long. His suit becomes filthy. His face grows weathered and thin from working tirelessly for a lost cause. His tongue probes the hole where one of his missing teeth should be.
He squats in filthy, damp places at night. He doesn’t wash his clothes. He’s so deep underground that he doesn’t even show his face in corner stores or bodegas when he can avoid it. It’s like Steve Rogers had never existed, and that’s just fine by him.
Steve jerks.
A week passes. Then they push it up another hour. The streets swarm with police and SHIELD, all hours of the day. Check points pop up in the streets. It cripples them. It becomes close to impossible to make any coordinated movement. They have a close call nearly every day. Their communications are nearly hacked, until they change to a new system. There's a sense of discomfort staying in one place so long. They want to move safe houses, but Steve’s not even sure that they can do that without being caught by SHIELD between locations.
"I've had enough. Some nerve he has, showing his face after Goliath."
It’s stupid, but Steve sends a message when he wakes. He does it the next day as well, and he compulsively glances at the communicator for any indication of a reply periodically. He doesn't expect anything, but he checks. He gets into the habit of checking the line first thing every morning at dawn. Chilly early sunlight, compulsively refreshing. He sends a variation of the same thing, every morning. (Like a prayer.)
He doesn't sound intoxicated. Steve sets the bagels on the counter. He kneels at Tony's side. Tony doesn't look at him.
“I know. You’re right. Of course,” Tony says. “I’m sorry. I just—” His voice cracks, and he trails off. His hands clench and unclench and clench into fists. A concentrated ball of nervous energy. It’s contagious. Steve begins to feel unsettled.
The upholstery smells like leather, and Tony's cologne. They don't talk as they drive. They don't talk as Tony pulls into a private parking garage and Steve can't stop looking for some sign they've been caught.
He was fucking precious. Steve might be the only beacon of light in a dark, dark place. There was something about him— the obnoxious, constant idealism, the stubbornness, the unabashed commitment to making things better, (a lost cause in Tony’s opinion.)
Christ.”
“It’s not a problem, Tony,” Steve said. “Why don’t you take yer time. Do you need help?”
When he wakes up, his mouth is a desert and a white hot pain radiates from the back of his head all the way around to his eye sockets. The pain pulses in time with his sluggish heartbeat. He’s disoriented and too stiff too move.
“No,” she says, and she tilts her chin up, as if she’s looking down at him, “I’m asking you to obey the will of the American people,
“I’ve seen a man burn to death,” Steve says. “You don’t want that.”
Joe ignores him. He tears out pages from another notebook and drops them on the fire, muttering under his breath, “
“That was frighteningly close to a compliment, Stark,” he said. Tony waved him off.
“Yer words, not mine,” Steve said, lacing an arm behind Tony’s neck and under his knees, and he grunted, “But if the shoe fits… ”
“Alright, I’ll bring them in,” the nurse says before disappearing. Tony’s head spins.
But then, he parts his cracked, dry lips and tilts his chin toward the sky. Water runs down his jaw, leaving trails in the dust and blood and soot caked to his skin. He swallows, mouth overflowing with rain; for a moment, Tony forgets his own pain, distracted by Steve’s whisper quiet sigh of pleasure.
contained somewhere between ink and paper? A genie in a bottle?
Tony has to laugh, but it’s humorless and depressing. “Well, if I had to recall events, I would remind you that you had no interest in coming within ten feet of me until I reminded you that I would be too

gentle hiss of hydraulics. Something Steve never told Tony, or anyone else, for fear of seeming strange: to Steve's enhanced senses, the unique molecular structure of the metal of the armor has a smell. Something subtle, faint. Distinctly Tony's, despite belonging to his second skin, and not his blood-and-bone body.
Then they kicked him some more.
He had met with Steve last night. (It hadn't gone well.)
Steve’s looking at him like he’s lost his fucking mind, and Tony briefly considers playing it off as a joke. Thankfully, Steve looks away, chewing his life, and says, “They’ll be looking for us. They’ll track the plane and figure out where it went down, and help will be here, soon.”
When Steve has nightmares about green flesh and crunching bone and so much
“You don’t get stars like this in the city,” Tony says. He isn’t crying. He’s just sad. “Light pollution, I never took it seriously until now. It’s fantastic. Look at that sky.”
Steve was quiet for a moment, obviously choosing his words carefully. He swirled his glass in his hand, wearing those leather gloves he never seemed to take off.
Tony leaned on his crutch, but the stairs tripped him up anyways.
“Sore loser?” Tony says. Natasha taps her candy red nail on the side of the bed frame.
“Thanks. Okay. Thank you.”
Tony hesitates. Behind the gleaming gold, Steve can only see his eyes. It’s enough to reveal how conflicted Tony feels— or at least how conflicted he pretends to feel. Steve can see the guilt and fear that Tony masks so well when he’s on stage, playing politician. In the Iron Man armor, though, Tony is more himself. Emotionally vulnerable. Transparent. He can't hide shit from Steve like this.
Needle prick. Drugs. He drops into another haze.
Then Natasha is there, too. Her auburn hair has been blown out into perfect waves and she looks particularly well-rested for a woman whose fiancé has been in the hospital. “Alive, sure. But well is pushing it.” She smiles, cat-like and beautiful.
“Just let me help. It isn’t like I have anywhere better to be,” Steve says. He plays it off like Tony would be doing him a favor, and it’s true.
. How the
* * *
Tony can’t feel his extremities. He’s so cold. “I’m Kirk. In case case you were wondering. Captain Kirk,” he continues. Steve has no idea what Tony’s rambling on about, but it’s more for his own benefit. Without the company of another person down here with him, it feels darker. Less of a cave, more of a crypt. He misses his bed. He misses lights and drinks and Natasha and hot showers.
“The skrull,” Tony says, pinched, troubled expression, as if suddenly remembering. “There’s a skrull, Steve. It isn’t really me. There was a double.”
Tony knows this, of course. He ducks his head and rubs the back of his neck, compulsively looking over his shoulder. Steve wonders if he even notices himself doing it.
Tony enters his penthouse late that night, presumably kept out late on some despicable SHRA business. He arrives in armor. Surrounded by snow, Steve suddenly draws a likeness in his mind between the armor and a Christmas ornament. Tony spends approximately two minutes between the elevator and entering his suite. He spends approximately four minutes out of sight entirely. Steve measures his breath and waits. He half wonders if Tony came in and went straight to sleep.
“Shit, I’m sorry,” Tony says, “I have towels in the bathroom, hang on. I’m so sorry. Shit.”
He first senses his visitor when he sees a reflection in the glass. Dark, sliding like an eel in a murky riverbed. Tony jolts and looks up, pulse quickening— but by the time he knows what’s happening, he’s too late to stop it.
“Don’t make me watch you break your neck.”
Steve keeps his own head angled down, away from the light. “Are we alone?” Steve says.
“You should be sure you’re right before you say something like that. You should be careful.”
Would it have come to blows, if it had been Tony all along? He wants to think he would have been more reasonable, even if Tony was wrong. Even if Tony was stubborn and insolent and causing catastrophe. He wants to believe that if it had been Tony all along, that eventually he would have stood down, and seen his error, or hell, maybe he would have made Steve see whatever the hell it was that Tony saw so clearly. He wants to believe that if it had been Tony, that no one would have had to die for them to realize that war is not the way.
He wakes up and waits for the needle prick. Ghosts from dreams already slipping from his memory dance in his peripheral. In the blackness of his cell, his mind invents lights and shapes and figures where there are none. Tony’s learned to ignore them. Mostly. But they don’t give him his shot.
He tried to wrench the door handle open, but to his sinking horror, it was locked.
no cathartic, explosive relief? What about when nothing gives, when the dam cracks, but holds? When you think that singing tension will eventually give way to a satisfying
, whatever that meant, but it was a song that Tony had heard somewhere else. It brought Tony back to a previous life that he had all but erased from memory with the years of drink.
“I don’t know if I can live with what’s happened,” Steve says, and he means it. He doesn’t know how to go forward, except with the small purpose of finding a body. One day at a time, and when that is done, he honestly doesn’t know what he’ll do next. How he’ll find a way to wake up every day. “And for all the back and forth— and all the things we’ve said, and done to each other… For all the cruel things I’ve said. For everything I never let you say—”
“Well, you’ll have to brush them again later. I made grilled cheese,” Steve says.
He has nothing to complain about; he’s lucky that in the little time he has left, anyone is willing to spend it by his side. Well. Figuratively by his side. Natasha wraps a red scarf around her throat and slide on a pair of designer shades.
I’m not a woman. I’m not, whatever the hell you are.”
“Well. I’m sure not the medical expert. As long as you’re okay. I’m glad you came. Means a lot to me. God knows everyone told me this party was a stupid idea, so it’s nice that you came,” Steve said. Tony stared at him for a minute, and then smiled crookedly.
“Yeah, well. The good doctor said it was nothin’ serious. Just a few fractures and some bruising. And I figured if I was gonna live to see another day, y’know. Might as well come see what all the fuss is about.” Tony was downplaying it a little; Dr. Banner had given him explicit instructions to limit his movement and rest until his ribs got better, and he was going to be watching Tony for any sign of internal bleeding in the abdominal area. The missing teeth were a problem that had no easy answer. Tony was just grateful they didn’t show when he spoke or smiled.

Almost.
Tony brings him into his penthouse and darkens all the windows. He locks the door. “There. You can relax. It’s secure. No one will know you’ve been here,” he assures Steve.
Steve guides them through the uneven terrain strewn with jet parts. “I’m going to try and figure something out to carry water with,” Steve says, stepping over a rock and stumbling.
do, and rushing headlong back into all of this takes an obvious toll on Tony’s mental health and recovery.
(He makes a decision he will later come to regret, but will never admit to it.)
He doesn’t look as he finishes it.
“Can you even reach to change the bandages on your back?” Steve asks, knowing the answer is no.
He’s wealthy and sloppy and needy, and she’s cold and unbothered and beautiful. It should be enough to get what you deserve.
“Alright. You get your way,” Steve says, over the sound of gravel crunching, a few pebbles tumbling over the ledge as Steve adjusts his position to lie on his stomach by the mouth of the cave. “I’m here. Just get some sleep.”
“Sh,” Steve says without moving a muscle. He feels like Tony is speaking to him directly now. He can feel his pulse in his ears.
Steve paused, brows furrowed. His curiosity won him out, and he leaned down, head nearly touching Tony’s knee, sticking a tentative hand into Tony’s boot. It tickled.
“We’re going to teach you a lesson. You drunk piece of shit,” the scarred man said. Tony tried to back up, but bumped right into the huge form of the third man, huge and silent. He grabbed Tony hard. Tony, still stunned from the throat punch and gasping for breath, did not have time to dodge the next blow. His jaw cracked and his whole body spun, pivoting at the neck as his head was knocked sharply to one side. He dropped like a sack of bricks, and brought the whole table down with him.
Broken rib for sure. Shouldn’t be hurting. Felt like he was being shaken. Maybe a train
It ends like this:
* * *
He dreams about freckled shoulders and Irish red ears and a garden snake with blue scales that sleeps on a warm rock, and white lilies and honeysuckle and pollen drifting through a blue sky, like summer snow.
Steve drinks in his beauty guiltily, like a man dying of thirst. He feels like he needs to visit a confessional, still so captured by Tony after all the betrayals. It feels like a crime. It feels like a sin. Stockholm syndrome,

He tries to think of what he would say if Tony could hear him now. The realization strikes him, how this is a fool’s errand. There is no closure here. No satisfaction, no catharsis, no absolution. He has never felt so acutely

she gestures in vague distaste to the hospital bed containing Tony, “I’m afraid I actually have somewhere I have to be tonight.”
In that moment, Steve makes his choice. He isn’t proud of himself. But the anger, and the hurt— it feels suddenly
“This doesn’t look good. Can you feel—”
“I love you,” Tony says. Less certain of himself, like he’s lost his courage, but it’s too late to quit now. “I’m in love with you.”
* * *
“Go to sleep, Stark.”
The flames looks like silk. He can almost pretend not to hear Steve screaming at him over the ringing in his ears. It’s claustrophobic— like crawling into an oven— shimmying on his stomach into what’s left of the cockpit. A wall of fire, reeking of black smoke and jetful, separates Tony from the mangled corpse of the pilot. The flask gleams flickering silver, warped by the heat. Tony makes a choice: he reaches into the fire—
Okay, maybe it’s not politically correct, but Tony laughs. And laughs. And laughs. Because, come on. It’s not nice, but it’s sort of true. “He doesn’t mean it, Steve, don’t you worry. Always had a way with words. He tends not to like my overnight guests,” Tony explains, “God, yo’ve seen how he grumbles whenever Natasha’s in the room.”
“You have so little faith in me,” Tony replies, and he sighs.
“Please,” He says, “Will you please just— Christ. This is pathetic. I’m fucking, I’m so fucking. Christ.” He paces, kicks dirt, wrings his hands. And then the manic energy vanishes, like a wrung out sponge. It's alarming to watch, in a perverse way. Steve is witnessing some kind of psychiatric episode, some imbalance tipping the scales in Tony right before his eyes.
The tiny amount of light falls into the dark room, and there he is. Steve blinks as though to clear the specter from his eyes, but it's him: the ghost Steve has been chasing. Hunched over, bony arms curled around naked legs, Tony is sitting there in chains, staring at Steve with vacant shock.
But Steve’s done joking.
, and he wants to beg not to be left alone.
There’s nobody there. It happening, again.
“Tony, stop. Stop.” Steve grabs him, tries to hold him still. Tony dislocates his own boulder and twists his head around violently, sinking his teeth into Steve’s shoulder, right into the muscle. Disappointingly, Steve hardly even flinches and his grip on Tony holds.
“Are you hurt?”
“I’m at the
The stars are out tonight, for the first time since the crash. Behind the dim outline of Steve’s silhouette, they twinkle like a field of diamond. All the points of light blur together.
“There’s one thing that I’ll never be able to tell anyone now. The one thing… the thing I should have told you—”
“Trying to cut you loose. Aren’t you supposed to be bright?” Steve retorted.
“You mean a surrender,” Steve says, clenching his jaw. Tony’s eyes shift, looking down. “Thanks,
“Here.” Steve brings the metal container to Tony’s lips so he can gingerly sip rain water.
He may have been mistaken when he used to think he was a person; he suspects that maybe, he has just been a confused piece of floor all along. He lays there a long time, weak, dizzy, head throbbing; he can’t quite remember how to make his muscles move. Twitching his fingertips seems an impossible task.
. He had been fighting with Steve. Something important. But how important could it really have been?
He had seemed wrong then, too.
“Ah.”
He’s not so used to what comes next.
“What’d I tell you?”
The house is a two story with boarded over windows and dandelions growing between the cracks in the drive way. Steve worries he must have the wrong place. It doesn’t look like anyone has been here for a long, long time. He stands there for a moment staring, the sun warming his shoulders, and it feels like the house stares back. The dark windows and the sagging porch roof frown, an empty-eyed skull.
Steve doesn’t react, using the force of his body to pin Tony against the ground, forcing him to be still.
The saloon had been transformed. After Steve had delivered Tony safely to the doctor’s doorstep and lingered long enough to be sure Tony would live, he left in a hurry. Tony had found it odd at the time— what could be so urgent? But in the course of just a few hours, his hard work had really paid off.
“Mm.”
to spread rumors about your fragile masculinity. And I recall you suddenly jumping on the chance to get your mouth on me, with that safeguard in place— How did we put it? Dead mean don’t tell tales? I’m trying to job my memory, you’ll have to forgive me. I’ve got some brain problems.”
“Are you dying?”
“We didn’t come here to arrest you, Cap,” Tony says, humbling himself. His false bravado has deflated. The Extremis suit is sleeker and more advanced; his voice sounds more like his true voice and less like a robot, in a way that sounds painfully intimate. “I talked SHIELD into offering you one, final amnesty.”
Howard says, “You stupid idiot,” and Tony nods.
“I’ll be okay,” Tony said, but he didn’t release his grip on Steve. Steve’s hand came to rest on the small of Tony’s back. Something shifted in the air, an electric charge between them that Tony hadn’t felt in so long he couldn’t remember its name.
They both laughed until there were tears rolling down their cheeks and the barkeep had to chase them out for being disorderly. Stepping outside, the nighttime air was a cool kiss on Tony’s flushed brow.
“— So please, for your own safety, we ask citizens to remain in their homes after midnight until six AM, unless you have documentation to prove why you must be out otherwise. Our agents will work tirelessly to protect you from the dangerous rogues. And remember—”
to it, though; some dark, insecure thing inside of him wants to hear Tony say it. Some darker thing wants Tony to beg Steve's forgiveness, so Steve's ego can survive forgiving Tony. He's going to forgive him, either way, he already knows. He just wants to be right. It isn't what he's here for.
He’s been awake too long without anyone coming in. It’s a break from the invariable routine upon which he’s come to rely. At first, he’s excited by the change— any kind of change— to break the monotony. Perhaps today they will kill him. His heart races with dark excitement. Maybe at least they’ll move him. Maybe he could jump out of a moving vehicle, if they leave him awake for transport.
Tony’s laughter sounds distorted and inhuman through the modulator-- then Steve remembers how true to life the new Extremis voice box is. This imposter Tony is laughing like a maniac; he doesn’t understand, yet, what Steve is here to do. What Steve knows. What Steve is willing to lose to get what he came for.
“I didn’t feel none too lucky when I came a-knocking for the Sheriff and he just happened to be
Steve could throw up. He doesn’t understand how he feels.
Erratic and angry and
fat raindrops falling at a slant with the wind. They have been without water for a long while. Tony hasn’t attempted to count the hours (his watch hadn’t survived the fire, and his phone was long gone), but the dryness in the back of his throat and the changing light tells enough.
“Just because I let you—
The relief is short-lived, and Steve is plagued by more questions than he has answers for soon after his discovery. His reality now a fallacy, he finds himself second guessing every thought he’s had, every decision he’s made. Repeating and analyzing throw-away interactions, trying to read meaning into every blink, sniff, and sigh.
He slinks back to his room glancing over his shoulder, as if he's about to be caught sneaking out. Not that anyone would be awake or in this part of the safe house at this hour, but he can’t stand the humiliation of being seen— even if he keeps the secret of why he is awake to himself. What would they think of their fearless leader now? It can't be much lower than he thinks of himself.
The girls leave, Steve holding the door for them. Instead of following them out, though, he lets the sound of their chatter and high heeled footsteps fade away. Then, he looks at Tony.
That’s when Steve stops misstep, and glances over his shoulder at Tony with an inscrutable expression.
“—But now,” Steve whispers, gently wiping his own tear off of the faceplate and setting it back on the table, “I can’t.”
“We’ll die either way. I’ll be fine.”
“Both of us do,” Jan says, throwing a wink in Steve’s direction. Tony doesn’t even try to puzzle that one out, right now. He’s still stuck on the fact that he’s being left alone again.
He wakes up again, and this time he’s more aware. It’s a blessing and a curse. He doesn’t hallucinate maggots, or wonder if he’s a piece of the floor. However, he has the presence of his mental faculties, enough to know how dire his situation is, and he thinks he’s dying. He doesn’t know how long he’s been here like this, but when you get close to that edge, you feel the the depth of the plunge. You hear the drafty, sucking void below. And you teeter.
“Yeah?”
Tony comes into the kitchen, where Steve is preparing grilled cheese. The counter is littered with plastic Kraft singles wrappers, and a knife sticks out of a tub of spreadable butter. The TV is playing in the background, but they keep it off the news stations when they can avoid it. Today, there’s a baseball game that Steve’s been keeping half an ear on.
. With tentative fingers, he pushes the hair out of Tony’s face, and his own heart beats faster. He doesn’t think he’s ever felt such a strong need to protect somebody.
“Fucking bastard,” Hawkeye says, throwing a crushed soda can in the direction of the TV. He's the furthest from the TV, leg propped up on a table, removing a set of stitches by himself. The soda can bounces off of exactly the spot where Tony's face had been. “That son of a bitch.”
* * *
this fact to the pissed-off idiot who had been gambling everything he had on the prayer of a statistically improbable straight.
that I know what you think of me, and you get some kind of kicks out of making me uncomfortable.”
“So soon?” Tony says sarcastically. “You better take the back again for your little walk of shame.”
“Now, just hang on a minute,” Tony said. He propped himself up on his elbow, his other arm positioned defensively above his face. “Why don’t we work this out with our words—”
. What an asshole; he’s
Tony has half a mind to leave Hank a strongly worded text message about trying to control his wife, because the issue is so transparently the idea of Jan being alone with Cap and Tony for the day. Sure, Steve will be grinding his teeth to dust trying and failing to play diplomat, a bull in a china shop, and Tony will be hugging a trash can, puking his brains out between photo-ops, but somehow they’ll find time to spirit her away and seduce her out of her marriage vows. Sure, Hank.
He’s been living like an animal for a long time. He shucks off his filthy uniform and changes into a lifted set of ill-fitting street clothes. He hardly recognizes himself, even though he looks more like Steve Rogers now than he has in months. By the time the morning light evaporates the dew on the overgrown front lawn, Steve is gone.
“Do you need to rest?”
He doesn’t realize he’s hallucinating the first time it happens, because it’s so minor.
, c’mon now. No one likes a sore loser,” Tony said with a sorry -not-sorry grin, sweeping the pot into his pile. “Let’s go again, you want to play again? I could use another whiskey. It’s my deal, if I do recall.”
“You don’t strike me as the breakfast type,” Steve said.
“Please, what’s going on? Jus’ tell me wha’s happening. Are we leaving? Are we going?” Tony asks. He sounds pathetic, but he’s terrified. The thick air is suffocating, and his chest feels too tight already. Joe preps the needle. Tony’s stomach drops when he sees that Joe’s hands are trembling.
Instead, it’s heavily insinuated that Tony has been on some vague
“Is it hurting you bad? I’m hardly moving you,” Steve said, voice tinged with concern.
He says, “I think you’re going to have us at war with one another.” (He is right in more ways than he yet knows.) It’s Cassandra’s curse: blessed with foresight, doomed never to be able to stop the future from coming to pass. Then again, maybe that’s more Tony’s thing. Maybe Steve is better at hindsight. Maybe Steve doesn’t even need to see ahead. All he has to do is look to the past.
Steve shrugs. “Not my area of expertise.” But his jaw flexes, tense, eyeing Tony’s burnt arm; he’s worried and not hiding it well. As much as Tony would like to flatter himself that Steve cares about him on some personal level, it seems far more likely that the concern is the result of the severity of Tony’s injuries rather than his status of endearment to the good old Captain.
It still doesn’t feel quite right. Given all the aggressive measures lately, it seems odd for Tony to fold now. Steve won’t look a gift horse in the mouth. He believes in giving the benefit of the doubt, and maybe he’ll finally understand why Tony’s been acting so strange. He’s just relieved that soon, they’ll be putting this all behind them. God, soon this may be over.
“I love you, too,” Steve says.
The shock of being wrong. It’s like the floor dropping out from beneath him. That gut-clenching panic, a moment suspended in time, reaching with your foot through the darkness for a last stair that isn’t where it should be. The forever-second long descent, and terror, and blindness, and confusion.
“I love you,” Tony says.
getting stronger every day— around Steve’s neck, and he kisses him.
* * *
“When more of our friends die, it’ll be on you. And nothing I could say will compare to how you’ll feel living with that, for the rest of your—”
, but he quickly becomes a believer. Steve counts his own bones breaking as Tony lands blow after blow. Steve likes to count. It’s like some strange form of mediation. Then the LMDs descend, but in the moment, Steve has tunnel vision. He hardly process the flashes of angry white light streaking through the smoke and flames. He
directly Tony is capable of receiving a message, these days. As if Steve needs the reminder of Extremis.
“Well, Stark. I hope you learned yer lesson,” the mustached outlaw said, grinning a wicked grin. His teeth were stained tobacco-brown, and he wasn’t gentle as he wrenched Tony’s shoulder out of its socket. Tony yelped in pain before it was replaced by a shooting numbness.
“Ladies and gentleman, I’m sure I don’t have to introduce you to Mrs. Miriam Sharpe,” Tony says. The whole world watches. He pauses, appropriately solemn and remorseful. “Mrs. Sharpe, you may recall, lost her son in that Stamford incident and kick-started my passion for the federal employment of all heroes.”
"Take a breath," Steve says, from the doorway.
“You never did say what the hell happened to you out there. What you got yourself tangled up in. And when I scraped yer ass off the rails, it didn’t seem like a good time to ask, seeing how you were still half drunk and stupid,” Steve said.
It doesn't matter. The choppers descend. They'll be out for his blood. He only has one choice. He only ever has one choice.
Sam mutters, resting a hand on Steve’s shoulder.
“Don’t see why they would. Seems like they got what they wanted, and they’ll be miles away by now. No tellin’ where they ran off too.”
Steve hooks his foot behind Tony’s ankle and ignores the screaming pain in all parts of his body as he brings Tony to the ground; the suit can’t predict a motion that Steve doesn’t indicate. The momentum topples the imposter, not accustomed to the weight of the armor, before his reflexes kick in. There isn’t a second to spare. Tony loses balance for a split second and Steve defies gravity. He throws himself onto Tony’s chest, pinning him to the ground with his thighs.
“Don’t be sour, Tony,” she says, leaning in close and kissing his temple. Enveloped in the fragrance of her perfume, feminine and cloying and spiced, Tony almost forgets what there is to frown about. It feels like it’s been eternity since he’s smelled anything other than smoke and burning and man sweat. “The odds were against you. It wasn’t personal.”
He hears banging
The three outlaws had come down the steps of the saloon stoop into the street. Fuck. They were following him from afar. Slow and unhurried, like they were just waiting for Tony to tire himself out and then they would strike at their own leisure. Like they were just waiting for him to step into a poorly lit alley.
"You should come with me."
“I didn’t know what was important, when it mattered. I’m
Tony is quiet. He rests his head on Steve’s chest. Tony isn’t a small man, he’s tall and broad, so his skeleton-like body feels clumsy and strange in Steve’s arms.
“How the hell—?” Steve was perplexed. He opened one purse and spilled a few gold coins onto the counter, as if he was expecting this to be a joke. Wallets full of rocks.
“I’m thinking,” Steve says.
The hunted feeling comes.
It takes him all day and Tony can’t stand to watch him, every time he starts to lose his grip. Even super soldiers weaken with a lack of food and water. The sun starts to go down. Steve leans toward the ledge to peer down at Tony from the top.
They climb up the back stair case, and he’s not even a Trojan horse, he’s just here because he's trusting Tony. He carefully modulates the joy inside himself; he keeps it small and holds it in his chest, like a bird’s fluttering wing. He will not celebrate until they’re both on the same side for sure and this nightmare is over, but his heart can’t be told so easily. There’s something irreparably irrational about how Tony makes Steve feel. Everyone has a weakness.
The sun sinks toward an unseeable horizon behind the clouds. Steve’s restless, but for Tony’s sake, he doesn’t try and force him to move.
“Stop moving, you’re making it worse,” Steve says, helpfully.
“God,” he chokes. “My God. I’m sorry.
* * *
“Your paymasters going soft, Tony?” Steve spits out, overwhelmed with outrage. He can’t even stand to look at Tony’s face, even with the faceplate covering most of his features.
Tony doesn’t take his side. Steve takes it personally.
“It isn’t something that I want people to know,” Steve says, slow.
He slides through the depths, pulled by a strong current. Sometimes he floats through perverse, nightmare versions of familiar places. Familiar voices sing his name, and he feels a burning in his throat, and an ache in his skull. They’re not real dreams; they’re fragments, viscous and warped by the sedative molasses flowing through his veins. A few times he nearly surfaces— but something heavy pulls him back down, and he slides a while longer.
* * *
The next few weeks pass by in a blur.
“Someone should be around to keep an eye on your health,” Steve says, and Tony puts up a bit of protest to that.
he reminds himself.
respect? What about Steve’s respect? What about their friends? What about basic integrity?
. Tony has this premonition that he’s going to die. Checking the locks sends it back into the shadows of his mind, but only fleetingly. It always comes back, the black dog of death. The sound of an extra set of footsteps when he should be alone. Delusional paranoia, or a well-informed hunch? When you’re right so often about how every worst case scenario will play out, it becomes difficult to attune when you’re being paranoid. Tony's paranoia has saved him enough times in the past.
, (they all but encourage people to speculate), and that someone has been signing documents in his name from the inside, as a cover up. SHIELD pretends to launch a department-wide investigation, there's talk of imaginary whistle blowers. The world demands accountability; they’re angry that they’ve been fooled, and SHIELD pretends to be ashamed.
“Cheers,” Tony said, raising his glass. Steve raised his and nodded.
Things get easier when Steve stops every thought that starts with a sense of obligation, or Tony being incompetent. He can't help but want to take care of him, but it doesn't actually work that way. He had said that he's here
Slowly, Steve turned back to look at Tony. A puzzled glint in his eye.
The next time he opens his eyes, everything bleeds together in the sunlight. Too bright. Too blurry.
Tony’s first day of being an object is spent drugged out of his mind and bound tight enough to cut into skin. Mouth hanging open, tongue lolling. He barely remembers a minute of it, and it’s probably better that way.
Tony discovers his fully stocked bar cabinet. Steve had forgotten, with everything else going on, until he walks into Tony's kitchen with a bag of bagels and finds Tony kneeling on the cold tile floor, turning a half-finished bottle of bourbon over in his palms. Steve's heart leaps into his throat. He automatically assumes the worst.
Of course not. And that’s an easier pill to swallow. If there’s one thing he knows, it’s how to be rejected. The second they slap a bracelet on his wrist and let him check out, Tony will wheel himself into the first bad he finds that has a ramp entrance.
“Let’s take ‘im out back,” the man with a scar said. Tony gagged and stumbled, his feet trying to keep up with their pace to save himself hanging by his own collar and dragging in the mud.
He hasn’t spoken that name in a long time.
Steve feels sick. He sits numbly in his seat in the main hub of the safehouse; he’s alone. These days, the others keep to their own quarters when they’re not out running rescue missions. Everyone nursing their wounds in private, or maybe avoiding Steve and his gloomy mood.
“Ah, there it is. Tell me how you really feel,” Tony says. He’s poking at a bee’s nest. One thing has become clear over the past few rocky hours: Steve doesn’t take well to being trapped and helpless.
of his closest allies could be green imposters. He has to rely only on himself, and if he lets on that he knows about the skrulls, he could be putting himself— all of them— in danger. He has to play his cards close, and he has to finish what has been started. Maybe he can’t stop SHRA. Maybe he can’t stop the skull invasion, because it’s too big for him to see. Not alone, anyways. One man against legions.
“I heard you tell Natasha what we did. That I’m a—”
“What?”
* * *
Tony’s heart started pounding. It was all fun and games— causing a ruckus and getting his ass kicked to distract himself from the desolate loneliness of another holiday alone— until Tony was suddenly in very real danger of dying ugly.
“No. It’s the truth. And we both know it.”
And he isn’t Tony at all.
"For you," he answers honestly.
Around them, the party slowly transformed from a full-blown hoopla to something sedate, and serene. A lot of patrons trickled out over time, to sleep off their holiday meals and the booze, or to be with their families. The candles burned lower and eventually. Eventually, the fox-haired Mrs. Barnes dragged her husband away from the piano by the collar of his shirt and they disappeared together.
“Act like a bitch, get treated like a bitch,” the scar-faced man said from the sidelines as Tony was laid across the tracks. He shut his eyes, willing the nausea to pass.
Tony’s hands hang awkwardly at his sides, and he’s working his jaw anxiously. When Steve looks at him, he sees Tony forcing himself to look straight ahead, none of that anxiously looking at his feet that he used to do all the time that made him seem like such a victim.
Tony fractured a rib falling, but the really concerning thing is that he can’t feel or move on of his legs. He plays it down to Steve, but Tony wonders if it’s a spine injury. Either way, there’s no way he’s going anywhere, and the cliffs enclosing them are so steep that he doesn’t expect Steve to be able to get far, either.
* * *
The rain starts in slow drips.
“You’re not the first, Stark,” he says; the way his voice drops low sends a chill up Tony’s spine, “And you won’t be the last.”
Tony’s skin looks blistered from the heat, which must be nearly overwhelming inside all that metal. He looks so tired.
His vision slid. For a moment, he wasn’t in a dusty, sweat-stinking western saloon; he was dressed to the nines in an expensive suit with a woman he used to love hanging off his arm, in a Boston ballroom that smelled like perfume and seawater, red velvet drapes at least twelve feet long, and the music was played by a symphony orchestra, and Tony always carried a firearm bearing his name to show off—
But it doesn’t go like that; they fall together, Steve dragged down with Tony. It’s a blind fall in the moonless night. Tony is too shocked to scream as his body bounces and slides down the cliff, flesh tearing open against rock, bones breaking, something inside of him bleeding.
He can’t be corrected.
He jerks awake, scowling, heart racing. There’s that disoriented moment between awake and asleep when he can’t quite connect the sound to a source, and he thinks someone has tracked him down. He calms when he realizes he’s still alone, and he notices the screen of his communicator alight.
“Ne’er to play poker with a bunch of sore losers from outta town, I’d have to say,” Tony said, and then punctuated his sentence by hocking up a glob of spit, right into the bandit’s face.
“Gee. Done already. Sure flew by,” Steve said. “I hope everyone had a good time. Seems I got so wrapped up I forgot to make my rounds. Didn’t even say goodnight to Deputy Barnes.”
“Ah. My mistake,” Steve says.
“Documents. From Congress, and SHIELD. You’ll want to get ahead of this. Big things are coming,” Tony says, sounding genuinely grim. Steve stands there, torn. And then, something gives and he’s getting in the car without really coming to the decision consciously.
It doesn’t do the job and he tries not to think about it.
It’s easier to shut down his emotions after his visit to the morgue.
“You son of a bitch,” Steve laughed. He started laughing real hard, cheeks flushed with liquor and laughter and warmth. “You
“It’s real simple, Tony. It’s right from wrong. Maybe that’s too complicated for you to understand,” Steve says, icy. He can taste his own heartbeat, fueled by anger and abandonment and misery. All his skeletons come jumping out of the closet.
At some point, communications in the resistance channels die entirely. Radio silence. Steve hopes, foolishly perhaps, that he has just moved too far out of range.
“Oh.” A beat. “Just keep looking up.”
“Thank you kindly for the escort.”
“Are you
As if something has finally occurred to him, Tony goes blank in the face, and self consciously straightens his posture. False confident shoulders. Head held high. No amount of posturing can erase that miserable look in his eye, but Steve would recognize this anywhere: Tony, putting on his true armor.
“Least there’s no train,” Steve said. “Else I’d be in a bigger hurry to rescue you.” He started in again with the blade, sawing back and forth, hacking through layers of rope frightfully close to Tony’s own flesh.
Had it been the funeral for the Stamford children? Steve hadn’t been in attendance.
“Now, that’s just too bad,” Steve said.
“Well, that’s all changed now, I guess. Now that you’re in town.”
He learns where Tony keeps his prescriptions and he brings him a pill and a glass of water.
you didn’t git yerself killed must be an act of God. I ain’t never seen nothing like it.”
, bug,” Natasha says.
He turns it over in his hands, barely allowing himself to breathe. The metal is ice against his skin.
“Watch your mouth,” Steve said. He cradled Tony’s head in his hands like he was something precious— even crusted with dried mud and the stench of sweat and vomit and liquor. “It’s Jesus’ fuckin’ birthday.”
“Yeah, it’s okay,” Steve says. “It’s good. Very good.”
On the bright side: he will certainly die before Steve does, which means he will not die alone. He’s selfish: he would condemn Steve to that lonely fate if it meant sparing himself. It’s not an insignificant silver lining. Tony has spent a lot of time, in recent months, mentally preparing himself for death, and when he imagines it, he’s always alone. He’s always in pain. At least he seems to have defied one half of that particular prophecy.
“Well, a ‘thank you’ would be fine,” Steve says.. “We don’t have to talk about what happened, down there. If you don’t want, I mean. I just needed you to know that I’m glad you made it. That’s all I care about. I’m not worried about my, secret.”
I don’t know what I’m doing. I didn’t ask for this. I didn’t mean for any of this. I was just trying to do what’s right. I thought this was
face will live forever in Steve’s mind. He has never looked so relieved. Like a burning building sagging under the weight of its own melting frame, finally succumbing and collapsing in a cathartic sigh. Tony crosses the gap and takes Steve’s hand so
“Well I’ll be damned. Make mine a whiskey.”
He's seated in a wheelchair with a blanket in his lap by his desk. He doesn't use the wheelchair outside of his private quarters, and never in front of anyone but Steve (after all, Steve saw him in much worse condition.) But sometimes he gets so tired that walking is a chore for him, and after the first time he had stood up too fast only to collapse, Steve had pleaded with him to work something out.
“What?”
* * *
, but Tony needs him, and Steve has this little scrap of good faith, and it’s enough for plausible deniability. He’s thinking ahead of himself, planning excuses and denials for any possible outcome, like an addict. The only person to whom he owes any explanation is himself, and that's the only person he can't fool.
“Heh,” he wheezed. The stars and the red earth laughed along with him. The eastern horizon glowed pale with the first vespers of Christmas dawn. The sun would rise in a few hours, he reckoned. He shut his eyes.
“Oh, Tony,” the skrull says. Tony’s eyelids start to pull shut, heavy. Internally, everything is going down. System after system crashing, and his biological systems fare no better. His lungs forget how to expand and contract. His fingers and toes tingle, freezing pins and needles. He’s going down. “Don’t you worry about a thing. I’ll take it from here.”
Tony leans across Steve's body, his cologne filling Steve's nose. His warmth tangible, despite the inches still between their flesh. Steve grips the bedsheet, as Tony reaches past him for the papers. Steve makes himself a statue. Suddenly, Tony's sleeve knocks his drink onto the bedsheets and all over Steve’s lap. Cold and wet and startling, snapping Steve to reality.
“Fuck off.”
“I’m making lunch,” Steve says as Tony appears on the other side of the kitchen island, carrying an iPad and a cup of cold coffee. “It’s grilled cheese.”
(Tony didn’t enjoy what happened next. He spit three teeth and a mouthful of blood out onto the mud.)
“It’ll heal,” Steve says, even though that hadn’t been the question. Tony’s always been quick to numb his pains, to drown his sorrows, to make light. He’s a hedonist, loud and proud, and he has always thought of Steve as something of a puritan. Watching Steve keep a stiff upper lip, limping away on what seems like a serious ankle injury, Tony suddenly wonders how much of that puritan charm is not just denying himself pleasure, but hurting in silence.
A hand grabs him by the shoulder. Steve flinches, jostling several broken bones. It's only Sam behind him, though. He stares down in masked horror at the green carnage under Steve.
“You with me?” Steve said.
Earn back
Tony gave an experimental tug at his bonds; it was useless. They really tied him down tight. The most hilarious thing of it was that Tony was more likely to die of exposure, or have his face eaten off by a coyote, before any train rolled over him. The train only
“Ain’t someone just the luckiest bastard in the West,” the mustached man’s friend— skinny with a facial scar— said suspiciously.
Tony didn’t even look up from counting his coins.
And there was nowhere to hide.
“This is exactly why I— forget it,” Steve says, his exasperation loud and clear even through the phone, “I’m leaving you here, I’ll handle the meeting alone.”
* * *
“Bet you’re regettin’ that smart mouth of yers now, huh?”
"Nothing."
Tony sips when Steve puts the water to his lips but it only upsets his stomach. Steve looks satisfied, anyways, feeling like he’s doing something to help.
“What’s happening?” he says. His voice sounds like a stranger to him. The words feel clumsy in his unpracticed mouth.
as you pretend to be.”
* * *
“You don’t strike me as an outdoorsman, particularly.”
Tony shuts his eyes.
Of all missions to die on. He’s quietly relieved that Natasha, and the rest of the Ultimates, couldn’t come. It suddenly seems more like fate than inconvenience. He wonders how she will take the news of Tony’s death. It isn’t a pleasant thought, but not for the reasons you might expect.
Joe runs pasts Tony, but then seems to pause, just for long enough for uncertainty to flicker across his green, wrinkled face.
* * *
Tony tells him he should give up now, that his armor can predict Steve’s every move before he even makes it. Steve thinks,
blessed memory replays the sense memory; warm, calloused hands, the smell of espresso and aftershave and engine oil. Hands touch. Replay. Their hands had touched. Over and over, like a skipping record.
"Please. Anything. Let me help."
“Are you okay?”
“Considering I thought you were already dead, I’m likely to give you plenty of slack,” Steve said. “Imagine the look on my face when I got back to the jailhouse and saw yer little message on my door.”
Steve’s mouth was warm and soft and yielding. He kissed like a gentleman, for sure, no tongue, but hands roaming up Tony’s sides like there was gold to find. Tony thought he could live forever in this moment. They both tasted of whiskey and the sweet flavor of midnight air—
When he tries to speak, he chokes on hot liquid in his throat. Turning his head to the side, he spits out what turns out to be a mouthful of blood— and what he thinks might be the tiniest chunk of his own tongue— onto the gravel.
Steve stares.
His eyes go wide, and it feels like his heart stops. “You can’t leave me here,” Tony says, and the drug begins to saturate his system. His words sound like a funhouse echo, and his vision starts to skip and slide and swirl. He’s sinking into a house of horrors, the terror becoming a hallucinogenic parody of itself until Tony can’t breathe. “You can’t d’that, please don’ leave me here.”
“Don’t worry,” Joe says, “You’ll die. Eventually. Fuck you, Stark. And fuck your hero buddies, too. You can have Steve Rogers to thank for this. He killed one of ours ugly? Well, we know how you feel about him. We’ve been in your head. Consider it payback.”
He must not have the heart to tell him.
But when Steve turns his head, cold revulsion blooms in Tony’s stomach because his face is all
“Is it SHIELD making you do all of this? The curfew? The checkpoints? The lies?” Steve asks carefully. He steels himself for an answer he doesn’t want to hear. He wants to hear Tony
“I’m fucked,” he announced to himself.
When he came around again, he moaned. A rhythmic, bouncing motion was jostling every broken bone in his busted body. There was congealing blood dripping down the back of his throat, making it sticky and thick when he tried to swallow.
He hears footsteps outside his room, running past the door. And more. Back and forth, muffled voices, an energy of unrest. Then, Tony hears a key hurriedly jammed into the lock. The door flies open. He looks up in hazy confusion as Joe runs into his cell, not even bothering to shut the door behind himself. Tony catches his first glimpse of what the hall outside his room looks like; it’s also concrete, and it looks like a residential basement. Dark, plain, and unimpressive He has built this place up in his mind to be some kind of impenetrable, isolated fortress. He had assumed he was in a bunker of some kind. Maybe out in the mountains somewhere. Tony feels disoriented.
“What’s that?”
“I’m right here, babe.” Her heels click against the linoleum floor as she crosses the room to be at his side. Awkwardly, Steve relinquishes his chair and sort of backs himself into a corner, as though he’s somehow imposing.
When he’s awake, reality is as thin and fragile as spun sugar. He sees things that aren’t there. He hears voices. He forgets himself; one moment he’s being forced to swallow a feeding tube roughly by someone with a blurry face and green hands, and the next moment, he’s begging Jarvis to not to leave his room, he hadn't
He pushed himself up out of the muck and stumbled a few steps in the direction of his smithy, where he lived in the second story. Drunk asshole. He zig-zagged like a scorpion, the mud making a sucking sound every time he wrenched his boot up from its grip. He could see his own front door, but with those guys watching him, he didn’t know if he
He traces the message to a house only three towns away, a rundown residential neighborhood. The whole while, Steve’s heart never really relaxes, he doesn’t feel like he dares to take a full breath. So used to disappointment, he looks for any possible disappointing answer to explain this. A trap of some kind. A glitch. An old message, only somehow picked up now, months too late. He can think of a lot of reasons to be pessimistic, and yet, the knot in his stomach is what hope feels like.
The mustached man leapt to his feet with a snarl and lunged at Tony, jostling the table and sending the coins scattering. Tony yelped and dodged, clumsily. His chair toppled over and he started to trip over it. A fist came flying toward his face and he flinched just in time— but he caught it in the throat, instead—
“You’re not even trying,” Steve says, jaw tight. For the hundredth time since the sun rose, Steve looks up at the tiny window of sky visible through the mouth of the cave, at least twenty feet above their heads. If Tony could draw— and if he had a steadier hand— he would like to draw Steve from this angle. There’s something artistic about the view of his lantern jaw from below, stubbled but hardly, Adam’s apple bobbing as he anxiously swallows. His neck is too thick to fit both hands around, Tony bets. All muscle and tendons and vein.
, they want the same things, even if they have different methods.
Steve lets him pull his short cropped hair as he drowns out all the pain with pleasure. The only coherent thought Tony manages to string together in the moment is that this is definitely not the first time Steve’s done this— he had seemed all too eager, even.
It’s his personal apocalypse. He can't remember ever being so scared in the war. Back then, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, it felt like he would live forever. Now he knows that he can-- but it's a long and lonely life, when those around you just keep dying. He can’t lose anyone else. Even his physiologically enhanced brain is only capable of processing so much grief.
It’s easy and slow, falling back in love. It's the least complicated thing.
“That does it,” the man said, pushing his sleeves up. Tony noticed just how tall these guys were.
“Don’ you find this just a little bit cliche?” Tony said, with a great struggle. The only response he received was a very pointed tightening of the ropes which bound his arms to his chest. Shooting pain bloomed in his ribcage. Message received.
“I’ve got a killer legal team,” Tony says.
Steve’s stomach clenches when he remembers how he had reacted; he hadn’t believed a word out of Tony’s mouth. He’d suspected him of drinking, of having a nervous breakdown. He’d told him to get help. Tony had asked him for help.
Steve helped Tony onto the back of his horse, and then mounted. They rode back to town, two to a saddle, Tony’s arms wrapped around Steve’s waist, early rays of sunlight warming their backs.
it all it. I’ll show you. C’mere.” He pats the bed.
“How’s the weather up there?” he asks, pausing to cough. The little bit of heat has vanished with the sun, and Tony’s freezing. For a while, he’s been shivering, but then that stopped.
There is no trail to follow, so Steve makes up an exhaustive, systematic approach. He uses the laptop and some of the skills Tony had taught him to use a very rudimentary algorithm to compile empty buildings and lots. Needless to say, it’s no small number. He starts close to home and radiates outward. It's not easy going, especially in the beginning. SHIELD slows him down, but by himself, he’s slippery, and elusive. There are risks he can take as one man, and there are cracks he can slip between.
that long, but it has certainly been longer than his body is used to.
Steve pauses. Struggling through the syllables, he hazards an incorrect guess, “Ka…. Sta…Zha—”
A silhouette emerged from the alley, just a few yards away. Another appeared on the other side of the street. If Tony broke into a dead run now, he might be able to go ten, fifteen seconds before his old ticker gave out on him. They’d easily overtake him, anyways. Two against one, and the third still leveraging the advantage of being unseen.
three
Steve removes his ball cap and sets it on the counter. Tony loosens his tie and goes to the bar.
“A little tight, darling,” Tony breathes.
He moves in with Tony gradually, and under false pretenses.
"Oh, you're ending it, are you?"
“I won’t be suckered into that again,” Natasha mutters on her way out, to which Janet titters in innocent amusement. Tony knows it’s a joke but—
“Cut it off. We should cut it off.”
Tony isn’t too naive to consider the possibilities logically, but they’re not married yet. She wouldn’t be entitled to any of his money, as far as she would know. (He has, of course, edited his will to heavily include her, but that’s neither here nor there, since she doesn’t know about it.)
Grief, at least, brings with it pain, making it
Steve goes all the way underground. He's smoke in the wind. He doesn't say goodbye to anyone. The news speculates about his
He speaks fast and barely above a whisper, fevered and wild eyed. The way he jumps from point to point makes Steve’s head spin, like Tony doesn’t think he can make Steve understand whatever he’s trying to sat. He’s only half making sense, and Steve suddenly wonders when Tony has last slept. The dark shadows under his eyes don’t tell a good story.
as he suddenly does, a sinking, slippery darkness that swallows him like bog mud.
"My dad liked Woodford Reserve," Tony says.
After a beat, without looking Tony in the eye, Steve says, “I climbed back down. You looked dead, when I got back with the rescue team. They didn’t think there was any point, I could tell, they were just, going through the motions. Setting up the hitch, this rope and pulley system to get down the rock face, it was taking too long. I couldn’t wait. So, I went down. Climbed, the same way I climbed out. I just wanted to check your pulse. I didn’t know if you were alive. Maybe they were right. Maybe there was no point, that’s what everyone seemed to believe. Hell even your own— well. Obviously, you weren’t dead. You were breathing. I think, though, that another ten minutes, it would have been over.”
“Bet you’d like that. Fuckin’ cheater.”
“Is it from the pain, do you think? Or shock?” Steve asks. “Or maybe the alcoholism.”

He thinks that this might have been just what the skrulls wanted when they planted one of their own as Tony. The heroes torn apart and bitter, dead and disbanded, leaving a hollow world. A weakened world. How many of his friends had been skrull plants? How many SHIELD officials? It keeps him up at night. Better off alone.

He opened his eyes and saw a field of stars above. He was on the back of a horse, his wrists bound excessively tight in front of his body. The frayed rope chafed and bit into his skin.
Tony says that he’s never gone this long without a drink, and Steve is quiet for a long time as they start the trudge across the barren, unforgiving landscape.
The moment it takes to trace the messages lasts eternity between breaths. The screen lights up. Steve clicks to open a map view, pinpointing the location of origin of the message. The truth is there: Tony is at the coordinates he said he is at. It’s no trap.
The world spins. Steve struggles to process this, but it’s like the past few months have been violently turned on their head. Like the skyline is folding in on him. He has been a skrull for
and Tony doesn’t know how to feel about that.
bar,” Tony corrects him, “Why don’t you meet me for a drink before lift off, might help loosen up that stick up your ass.”
It’s dark. They’re both dressed in their own idea of incognito. Tony would still stick out like a diamond in a box of rocks if he spent too long in a crowded place.
, Hill. Heroes need to stay above that stuff, or Washington starts telling us who the villains are,” Steve says. He attempts to keep himself collected, but he catches himself posturing. He can’t believe he’s having this conversation. Registration or imprisonment— he’s heard that rhetoric somewhere before and he feels impossibly weary. It isn’t often he truly feels his age, but in moments like this, he wants to throttle this new generation for their short memory.
“I’m sorry,” Steve says again, out loud. The dark eye slits stare back at him."
“Turn this off, Steve,”
“I’m going to find you, Tony.”

Tony feels childish for being so bothered; this had always been the only outcome, and yet that doesn’t take sting out of the abandonment. He plays it off like he doesn’t care at all.
* * *
Things are the same for an eternity.
—then Steve was holding Tony just a
And it is okay.
“Remind me, Cap, where are we headed, again?” Tony says.
“So,” Tony says, the door clicking softly shut, “Did you put money on me, too? Good odds, I hear. Easy money. Actually, you know what. I don’t want to know.”
When they first take him, they move him several times. Tony would not know this except that sometimes he opens his eyes, and if he's feeling really sharp, he notices the walls are a different color. Whatever they use to sedate him obliterates Extremis, and pushes him down into a kaleidoscopic stupor.
Steve goes back to ignoring him, and it’s probably for the best. Tony leans his head back against the rock and Steve goes back to pacing.
Steve is like a caged animal, all feral desperation, single-minded. “I think I could do it.”
The mother of a dead Stamford child accompanies him on stage, a sick prop in their political play. She smiles, but the weight of her loss shows in the lines around her eyes. Steve's seen that face at soldiers' funerals. There is something distinct about the grief of a mother.
There’s rationally nothing to worry about; all the security in his penthouse is coded to respond only to his biometrics, so unless someone borrowed his eyeball, his finger print, and his passcode, there’s absolutely no way an intruder could make it through. That isn’t even accounting for the security cameras, all equipped with smart technology and facial recognition. He would
“I don’t know who that is,” Steve says, “I think you’re seeing anythings again.”
“It’s not him, Steve,” Sam says, glancing at the green flesh poking out of the armor on the ground. A distant helicopter drones in the sky close by as it closes in on them. By the sound of it, SHIELD is close, but they’re afforded the benefit of being cloaked in the dense smoke and haze. “You have to go, Steve. You need to go. Come on. It’s going to be okay. We’ll be okay.”
“So close. I think you better let me tag along.” The bartender slides two fresh drinks in front of Tony, the glass sweating with condensation.
“I think quitting’s all you know,” Steve says. “Except where it might count.”
It isn’t what Maria wants to hear. Steve’s body senses the ambush coming before he realizes it. His skin prickles. His muscles quiver. Cornered animal. Too many agents. Not enough escape routes. Hands hovering above holsters, itchy, twitchy trigger fingers.
He calls a meeting, and the tone is grim as the others trickle, in a few at a time. The toll that this war has taken on them all shows in the flesh. Arms in slings and butterfly stitches, violet bruised cheeks, and grey hairs, and glassy eyes. Too many empty chairs. So much lost.
“I’m glad you’re here,” Tony says. “I’m glad you found me.”
“I know, I know. Hey, for all I know, you’re not even here now.”
have it comin’ to you.”
He finds that weathered notecard, still in his pocket. In smudged, blurred ink, the number for Tony’s private comm line; it doesn't matter that it has become difficult to read, because Steve has committed the sequence of numbers to memory by heart, anyways.
A trick of the light. A dark mass, motion, in the corner of his vision. A trick of the light.
It feels unnatural to keep beating someone who is down.
One problem at a time.
“I don’t gamble,” Steve says stiffly. Standing straight as a ramrod, he holds his arms behind his back, as though for a military inspection.
Well, that was always one last option for the desperate. The Sheriff’s office and the jailhouse were just down the road, and maybe Tony could make it.
But here he is.
Tony watched Steve’s eyes go wide as he found what Tony had in there. In Steve’s hand were the wallets taken off all of the bandits who had beaten up Tony— heavy with money.
"Nothing," Tony says.
“One and only,” Steve grunted. Tony opened his eyes. “You with me?”
“Very good, Sir,” Jarvis says.
trying to break his own hand.
“Don’t be a sore loser,” Jan chirps.
He hasn’t dared say it out loud to anyone but Steve. His fear is that he
Steve spends another night camped out on the rooftop of a building across from Tony’s penthouse, equipped with surveillance technology lifted from SHIELD. High powered scopes and binoculars, and a sonar gun that’s useless through Tony’s reinforced glass windows. His line of sight is extremely limited; he only has a view of one third of one of Tony’s rooms, and Tony keeps his windows darkened more often than not.
“I’ll call you.”
“Card counting piece of shit, you chose the wrong men to fuck with,” the mustached man said.
“I was more than
Tony’s chest tightened.
He placed his other hand on the small of Tony’s back, just hardly touching. Hovering, ready to catch him again as needed.
Steve wipes his hands on the dish towel hanging from the stove. “What?” He says.
She tells him that heroes are having a secret meeting at the Baxter building, and she asks him if he can handle the ones who will rebel.
He coughs. It turns into another round of dry heaving. He’s used to that.
He started by asking Steve if he thought counting cards was really, technically cheating. (Wasn’t hard to predict Steve’s answer. A difference of moral perspectives.)
It feels senseless. Gratuitous. His pulse pounds in time with his fists, and every part of him bleeds. Tony cries out, garbled and broken though the dented faceplate. Steve ignores it. It’s now or never and he can’t lose his nerve. He came here with a purpose, and an untold toll has already been reaped to achieve that end. He’s going to kill him. The story  has been written and the ending always had to go this way.
After a precious short moment of peace, the saloon doors opened again. They followed him outside.
“Why don’t you have some water.”
When he’s finally able to come out of the shadows, Steve doesn’t know what to spend his freedom on outside of being with Tony. He’s grown accustomed to hiding. He doesn’t want to be seen, for a while. The public wants him to speak, but Steve finds himself
“Thanks. Sorry,” Tony said.
And the more pressing concern comes to him in a haunted echo of a trembling voice. Tony, scared and unshowered and paranoid, like a deranged drunk in the streets. Looking over his shoulder. Buzzing like a firecracker.
When he wakes, his head still hurts. But there’s something else. Tony blinks. And then— feebly, shaking— he manages to sit up. It takes all his strength. The rattle of his chains startles him, the first non-imagined sound he’s heard in a long time.
Steve lingers close to the bedroom door, just a few steps inside, arms crossed over his chest. He points to the stack of papers and folders. “Is that it?”
cheating. And being good at math was certainly no sin, either. It really wasn't fair to accuse him of unsavory business just because, even slobbering drunk, he had a knack for numbers.
"No... " Tony says
Wouldn’t do much staring down the barrel of a pistol, but Tony had think think fast. He came up with one good use for it.
“Oh my God,” Steve whispers. He turns the corner and finds the basement door, left ajar. Faintly, the smell of stale smoke wafts up the stairs. And the smell of stale sick. He pushes the creaky door open, and descends into near total darkness. He wishes he would have thought to bring a flashlight. He feels around in the dark. His fingertips are his eyes. The only light comes from the open door at the top of the stairs. It takes a minute for his eyes to adjust.
He plucks the straw out of his glass and tips the salted rim to his lips, downing the last swallow of slush. This leaves Tony and Steve, going alone, and he hasn’t actually broken the news yet; he briefly considers telling Steve that Jan cancelled just as the plane takes off, but Steve might just jump out of the plane.
The guilt is like fluid in the lungs. He feels like he’s drowning in it. Tony had known something. Had Tony known? What sort of fear had he lived in, in the time leading up to his being replaced? Had he convinced himself he was delusional? That he was unravelling? Steve had believed it.
A kick to the chest— ribs cracking— sharp pain that made it impossible to take a full breath.
” He says, and there is the heavy
The bitter truth is that Steve doesn’t matter as much to Tony as
Instead, he laughed, too. It was contagious.
In truth, the Tony before him was the antithesis of the Tony whom Steve had seen on TV screens, meeting with congress and the press and the president. The man before him seemed shrunken in his suit and reduced to nervous tremors. Steve noticed his clothes, expensive but rumpled. A fleck of coffee at his shirt collar. The shadow of unshaven beard blooming across angular cheeks. Unkempt, but trying hard to hold it together. Like he hadn’t hit rock bottom, but maybe he could see it coming at him.
“I think you’re hearing things.”
. Steve sees it in the line of Tony’s shoulders and the downcast look about his face.
Steve just stares.
“Do you hear that?” He says. Steve doesn’t stop pacing or even look at Tony.
And he remembers Steve’s name.
* * *
He finds himself suddenly overcome by a morbid desire to touch the armor, for some kind of sense confirmation that any of this is real.
Steve shivers.
There is another loud noise.
“Oh my god,” Sam says, turning up the volume. All eyes fall to Tony’s image on the screen, as he opens his mouth, and lies without hesitation.
The relief doesn’t last, but the pain of his injuries dull anyways. It isn’t a good sign. It’s his headache that wakes him, a familiar pain that is almost a comfort— the tumor is a constant. Not that it matters much to Tony what’s causing the throbbing when he opens his eyes to icy white sunlight. An indeterminate amount of time has passed; worse, he has absolutely no ideas where he is, for a minute.
Steve is surprised with himself, too.
“Steve?"
Steve barks out a laugh, dry and openly pissed in a way that Tony isn’t used to, from Steve— yet, it’s clearly just a glimpse into some deeper dwelling anger that lives under the skin, magma bubbling beneath volcanic crust. “You think I’m stupid, don’t you? Oblivious, so naive that— I bet you think half the things you say go right over my head— Or maybe you
He transfers it from his glove to Tony’s hand, and Tony notices a second too late. Panic flickers across his expression. “What the hell?”
to do with his injuries.
He opens his eyes a second later and he’s flat on his back staring up into Steve’s terrified face.
The stars above, swimming pinpricks of light, just watched. The other two outlaws watched, too, looking pleased with themselves.
Tony says nothing.
“You wish,” Tony said, but he didn’t object as Steve walked with him to his seat, helping to part the crowds and keep Tony balanced. Tony wouldn’t admit it outright, but Steve was the only reason he had dragged his sorry ass out of bed this evening and hobbled down the street. He felt secretly pleased to run into him and catch his attention right away. There was something gratifying in getting what one came for.
Tony grinned, all bloody teeth.
Tony prayed that maybe his attackers were just checking to make sure Tony wasn’t planning on coming back inside for his money. Tony had no such plans. He just wanted to get to bed.
Tony doesn’t want to ask again, and he’s too tired to argue. “Please.” There’s a pause.
Pain again. He was definitely being shaken.
when a man has died for a false cause. He feels like there’s a hole inside of him, and he wants to whip himself until he bleeds. He deserves to bleed, and so does Tony. There is no blameless man now that their war has a death toll.
Steve glances down at his hand and releases his grip. Tony can’t tell what he’s thinking: is it ruined, that sublime tension soured by pity for Tony and his tumor, Tony and his seizure, Tony, resigned to his fate, a corpse still half animated?
“I’m really glad you came,” he says again. “This way, I’ve got everything in my room.”
“Not this guy again,” Sam says behind Steve, “I’m starting to think he likes the sound of his own voice.”
Steve sets down the spatula.
He’s lucky that even Sam hadn’t been present in the moment of the reveal, that night on the rooftop, because Sam might be a skull. Steve realizes with a slow, crawling feeling that

it took me too long to realize what mattered.”
“What about this?”
Needle prick.
Then he starts beating him.
You’re asking my to arrest people who risk their lives for this country, every day of the week,” Steve says, barely able to contain his disdain. Pinched brow. Narrow eyes. Adrenaline making everything sharp and still. He takes inventory of her agents in his peripheral vision. Too many. Rabid dogs. Maria looks so relaxed.
“She’s not here.”
“Suit yourself.”
“You need to get help,” Steve says. He doesn’t know what else to say, and in the moment he can’t sort out concern and pity and anger. He feels helpless and wants to get out of this interaction. A twinge of guilt pulls at his heart, but it's clouded by anger and disappointment; Tony was supposed to see Steve's side, tonight.
are being hunted and shackled like animals.
He locks his doors and triple checks them every night. He lies in bed, trying to sleep some nights, but the feeling of being Watched comes over him like a tangible shadow, and it becomes unbearable. When this happens, he turns on all the lights. He checks all security feeds. And then double checks. (And then he checks the locks again.)
All of that which he represses during the day comes off the leash in his dreams, though.
Steve shrugs. His cheeks turn warm but he doesn’t look embarrassed. It’s the only spot of color, the blood in Tony’s mouth, the blood flushed to Steve’s cheeks. “It doesn’t matter. You won’t tell anybody. You’re won’t— You’re going to—”
Natasha straightens up and smooths out the creases in her expensive jacket, her diamond engagement ring catching the light and twinkling. “That’s nice, Cap, but there’s no need I’m afraid. As much as I’m loving,
This morning, head hanging in the toilet, Tony had received a very angry message, which turned into a series of unpleasant phone calls on his bathroom floor, in his underwear. They discover that Natasha is not actually welcome in the country they’re scheduled to land in, and Bruce Banner isn’t welcome anywhere.
SHIELD agents in helicopters tranq several members of the resistance group, but they leave Steve standing— intentionally, he realizes. For a moment, Steve has the opportunity to see, first hand, how many of his once trusted friends had agreed to betray him tonight. Standing in the field of burning rubble, his allies unconscious at his feet, he picks out familiar faces on the enemy side— Carol, Hank, Jen, Reed— and he bitterly waits for someone to strike himself down too.
“I’m over here.”
“Oh, it stopped.” Tony frowns.
fears death, the
“I never would have pegged you for a cocksucker, but life is full of surprises.”
“I’m sorry,” Steve says again, out loud. The dark eye slits stare back at him. He’s not used to seeing the helmet without Tony’s blue eyes behind those slits. He doesn’t know if he’s ever looked at the armor so carefully, up close, without Tony in it before. He’s never thought of it as an object, but as an extension of Tony. How wrong it feels to treat it now like some inanimate thing.
