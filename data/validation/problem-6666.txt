Tony nodded slowly, biting his lip. “Yeah. His men broke into my house and took my flashdrive. He saw some of the designs I made and wants me to build them for him. Or else."
“You’re more than welcome to make your own breakfast,” Steve hummed, grinning and not bothering to even glance up from his paper.
“What?” Bucky said incredulously, giving her a look. “I’m the car. Pick something else. The thimble, or the top hat.”
The blonde in question quirked his lips up into a polite smile, hesitant, as if testing the waters with Toni. As if she’d forget that he was the same as every other person who tried to use her. Normally, Toni fumed for a few moments and moved on, like she had last night. But this man? This man still got what he wanted. “Good morning, Ms. Stark. I hope you enjoyed your birthday yesterday. Your father really has been a gracious host.”
Bruce looked back, as if shocked that Tony was still in the lab. “That’s impossible, I…” Bruce trailed off as he glanced back, groaning and quickly fixing his mistake. “You’re absolutely right.” He turned, raising an eyebrow. “How did you know that?”
Steve felt that feeling in his gut again and before he could stop himself, he was moving over, taking Tony’s arm. “If you don’t mind, Bruce, I’ll train with him. Promise I’ll go easy,” he said and Bruce nodded, stepping over to watch Bucky and Clint.
Bucky huffed, finishing off his last bite before leaning back on his palms. “And you don’t care that you’re screwing people over?”
Bucky smirked to Steve and nudged the boss. “What do you say? Movie night? Even Tony’s on board,” he insisted.
Toni reached back for the cigarette, sliding it between her lips. She took one long inhale, steadying herself before she met Ty’s gaze. “I was thinking,” she began, smoke rolling off her lips with each word, “I would like to have lunch with you and Obie.”
Tony turned to give Steve a look, as if to size him up. "Yeah, I heard about you. The man who fights for the little guys. Big fucking deal," Tony snapped. "It still doesn't explain why
Clint opened his mouth to reply but Bucky cut him off. “What the Hell?" he gasped, pointing past them towards the house, where smoke was rising into the dark sky.
Justin Hammer let out a sharp yelp as he was pressed against a table, bent over so he got a clear view of the map spread across it. His hands were help tightly behind his back, not that they’d be any help with his broken fingers and all. Steve was pacing along the edge of the far side of the table, muscular arms crossed tightly. His eyes swept over the map of the city before meeting Justin’s, a cruel fire burning in them. “Tell me what I want to know.”
The phone on the corner of the desk chirped twice, and Steve had all of five seconds to pinch the bridge of his nose before the intercom crackled to life. “Your four o’clock is in the library, Steve.”
Frowning, Tony slipped out of the bed, sliding his feet into his shoes and grabbing his hoodie, throwing it own as he opened his bedroom door and moved down the stairs. What the Hell was Clint doing? Tony slipped out the front door, glancing down the street just in time to see Clint turn the corner.
"No lies," Clint growled, fingers brushing against the gun on his hip as if he wouldn’t hesitate to kill Loki.
“I know,” Ty grinned smugly, pressing his lips to the side of Toni’s jaw before tugging away in favor of the couch again. “But I like to piss him off.”
Steve nodded, looking over his group of his most trusted men. “Make sure everyone is ready to go by seven-thirty tomorrow night. We will make this as clean and as quiet of a fight as we can. Am I understood?”
“Tony, Im sorry,” Steve insisted, and Tony heard the soft thud of Steve pressing his forehead against the door. “I know I messed up, but I didn’t mean to forget, honest!”
Natasha hummed. “A match made in heaven,” she agreed, grinning as Toni made a face. “As much as he refuses to admit it, he needs someone in his life to knock him down a notch or two.” The redhead crossed her arms. “I want to thank you, for finding Barnes. Steve won’t admit it, but he was self-imploding without Bucky here and he was about to make some irreversible decisions.”
“Overreacting? Buck, my entire business is at risk,” Steve declared. Taking up a glass from the bar, he fixed himself up with whiskey, refilling Bucky’s own empty glass when the brunet raised it towards him. “I’m going to lose my imports, which means I’m going to lose my clients.”
Downstairs, Clint was consumed in fear, not for himself, but for his little brother. Steve drove Clint home, only for them to find the front door kicked open and a man snooping through the downstairs. It had only taken a second upon seeing him for Clint to put a bullet between his eyes. Clint didn’t care to question the man; his main focus was finding Tony.
“That will be interesting. How long?” he asked, using his only free hand to pry a slice free from the pizza.
Howard hummed his agreement and Steve’s shoulders visibly relaxed. “You usually have such a keen eye for these deals. I have a feeling that Mr. Rogers and I will do great things together for this city, with your help. Once I have the contracts drawn up and Steve solidifies his plans, we’ll be in business.” Howard finished his coffee before closing the file and standing. “Steve, I’m glad we were able to meet. A friend of my daughter’s is always welcome here, as well as my business partners. You now have the good fortune of being both,” Howard proclaimed, shaking the blonde’s hand before resting a hand on Toni’s shoulder as he passed. “I have a meeting at ten, but I’ll make sure the appropriate paperwork is sent to you by noon. We’ll be in touch.”
Steve nodded his agreement, and with one sharp jerk, he rammed the butt of his shotgun into the doorknob and broke it off. Much quieter than breaking the glass. Steve led the way in, shotgun raised as he studied what must have been the waiting room. The blue, leather-bound chairs were toppled, but there was no signs of panic or struggle that was common among the medical buildings they crossed. Most of them Steve and Bucky had ever crossed were ransacked, if not filled with the dead thanks to infected people flooding the emergency rooms and clinics with the hopes of curing their viruses and saving their loved ones.  But this one was in relatively good condition, which meant it must have been closed during the outbreak or the locals hadn’t bothered. Steve checked behind the reception desk, before leading them down the hallway with five closed doors.
Bucky frowned, leaning forward to meet her eyes but she decisively would not look at him. “And what’s north?”
Howard nodded, taking her chin in hand and forcing her to meet his eyes. “We will crush the traitors eventually. But for now, be strong, Antonia. What are we made of?”
Bruce gave the blonde a soft yet awkward smile, the kind the man always gave when he received praise. “Of course. Your business supplies my hospital with the supplies we need to treat a variety of patients with a variety of illnesses. We couldn’t do the work we do without you.”
"Oh come on, I’m sure no one will mind if you take a little…break," Donovan grinned, licking his lips.
Rhodes and Dugan gave respective nods from where they sat, eyes still memorizing the map. Thor placed is hand on Steve’s shoulder, giving it a squeeze. “We will not be of any disappointment.”
“No,” Rhodey started, “You were comfortable with him and you felt safe, and he took that away from you. You trusted him because you knew him and he was predictable, and he wasn’t supposed to change your world in any meaningful way. I know you, Toni, you value safety and feeling in control and he took that from you.”
The sound of early afternoon traffic drifted through the apartment’s open windows, accented by the occasional breeze that filtered in. Toni moved from the bedroom at a quick pace, hurried hands twisting her dark curls up into a bun while her eyes scanned the living room for her phone. Two bobby pins were clamped between her lips, before they were freed only to help pin her hair in place. Ty was settled on the couch before the television, feet propped on the coffee table and a bored expression on his face as he examined the laptop perched on his lap. There was an emptied glass on the table beside his feet that had Toni rolling her eyes. “It’s noon. A bit early for a drink, don’t you think?” she asked, making a sound of victory when she located her phone on the corner of the bookshelf.
“Treasonous,” Howard muttered, glancing towards his guards in the hallway before reaching to close the door between them. He lowered his voice now, hands folded behind his back. “It was unexpected, but it will not go unpunished. I’d be foolish to think that Obadiah would make a move without making sure he has sufficient backup. An army of his own. As of this moment, I am at war with him. But there is still an issue.”
The first few buildings were private residences, something they could loot on their second or third day in this town. Then can the general store and a lawyer’s office, a small government building and- “There,” Bucky murmured, stopping before a brick building tucked between two restaurants. The glass was grimy and covered in dust, and one twist of the golden doorknob found the business locked. “Doesn’t look like it was touched in a while, if at all.”
Howard nodded, straightening his tie and turning towards Steve. “Thank you, for getting my daughter to safety, I-“
Toni stood at the top of the stairs leading to the front entrance of the museum, watching as valets and drivers alike scrambled to get each guest into their respective cars. Her father stood four steps below her, saying his goodbyes to a couple that were adamantly expressing their gratitude for some investment Howard promised. A fat drop of rain pelted against Toni’s cheek, jarring her from her trance. A quick tapping sound drew Toni’s attention towards her fiancé, who was leaning against the railing shaking out a pack of cigarettes. “Maybe we should just head out,” Ty muttered, slipping a cigarette between his lips and fishing a hand into his jacket for a lighter. “They’re gonna have our car here any second and I’d rather not get rained on in this suit.”
It was like someone hit him over the head with a rock. That was the first thought Tony registered as he woke slowly in a bed on black silk sheets. He grunted softly as he sat up, rubbing his aching head as he glanced around the room. Where the Hell was he? The room was much bigger than his bedroom at the Estate, and smelt distinctly like roses. And a little blood. The smell was almost sickening. He slowly slip to the edge of the large bed and stood, wobbling slightly and gripping at the bedpost for a moment to steady himself.
The blonde glanced up his body, finding the rope wrapping around his ankle disappearing into the ceiling. He’d have to reach up and cut himself down if he wanted to free himself. The man reached to his belt, where a pocket knife was clipped against his hip. It would take some work, but if he could just reach up and-
“Ontario. Some government facility, I think. To work with a few other scientists on a possible cure.”
Toni didn’t respond, already leading Rhodey up the stairs. Steve watched them go until he heard the guestroom door close, before sighing and turning back for the kitchen. Toni’s silence was much more disturbing than any argument she could have given, and perhaps Rhodey’s presence really was needed.
“We’ll take her as far as we can until her arm is healed. Then we’ll see if she wants us to go with her the rest of the way, “Steve agreed.
“Tony,” Tony introduced himself, sticking out a hand to Bruce, lopsided smile in place. “Clint’s little brother.”
money. I’ve spent years dragging my father’s business out of the massive hole of debt he left it in. I didn’t do all this work just to lose everything,” Steve insisted, knocking back the entire glass of whiskey.
He was settled on the ground, a rough cement floor grating against the bottom of his bare feet. A warehouse? A basement? His arms were stretched up over his head, and Bucky gave them an experimental tug despite the pull in his wounds. A cold, metal chain dug into the skin of his wrists, resisting the moment. A metal pipe groaned in protest. So definitely a warehouse or basement. His pounding head remembered things only in pieces: drinks with a blonde, dancing with a brunette, a giant fucking whale? Right, he was at the museum for a party. He remembered slipping into the bathroom, washing his hands, and then….then nothing. Must have been jumped. God, Steve was going to kill him.
Clint shook his head. “Bruce, you gotta make sure he goes to bed before you leave him alone. Or else he’ll just stay up and work.”
Steve turned and punched the wall, making everyone go silent. “That was why those men were at the club. It was all a fucking distraction so Loki could be alone with Tony," he growled, turning to Thor. “First thing we’re going to do is find your bastard of a brother. Then, he’s going to help us find Tony."
Steve scoffed, though his eyes did wander downward. He admired the sharp lines of Bucky’s abdomen, the skin well-tanned from the long summer months. The scarring was still visible on his left shoulder, though not as bad as it had once been almost three years ago, and Steve ached to kiss it. He settled for Bucky’s lips instead, one hand cupping the brunet’s cheek and tugging him closer. Bucky, always willing, melted into him easily, one hand anchored on his hip, fingers digging in.
Tony shut off the shower and moved back into his bedroom, heart set on flopping in the bed and sleeping his life away, but a white envelope sliding under the floor caught his eye. Tony lifted up, finding his name written neatly across the front. Steve’s handwriting.Tony stared at it for a long time, before curiosity got the best of him and he opened it.
The blonde jerked, eyes tearing away from the whale to land on his best friend seated beside him. “What did you say?”
Bucky’s head snapped up when the lab door opened and Tony was shoved in, the soaking wet boy landing on the cool lab floor with a grunt of pain. “Tony!” Bucky cried, rushing to the genius and kneeling by his side.
Steve reluctantly broke the kiss when Bucky’s teeth scraped against his lower lip to give a teasing tug. Bucky made a disappointed sound, refusing to give Steve even an inch more of space. “I’m not making out with you with a girl sleeping three feet away, Buck.”
“Precisely. Which is why I must ask a favor of you, Steven,” Howard murmured lowly. “If you would allow my daughter to stay here with you-“
Tony jumped as the computer screen went black and a low voice filled the room. “Now I really am disappointed with you, Anthony. I expected better."
He passed the cigarette forward to Toni, who hesitated a brief moment before she accepted it for a drag herself. “A lot on my mind.”
“I’ve recently been informed that you chose to skip your meeting with my father this morning,” Toni began carefully, because this situation was appearing more and more delicate the more she examined him. She shut the door behind her, closing off Sharon from overhearing the discussion. “I don’t think I need to explain to you why that was not your best decision.”
“That’s where you’re wrong.” Bucky grinned toothily, and Steve couldn’t help the fond eye roll the expression elicited from him. “Because a buddy of mine let me in on a little secret: there’s one person that is able to sway Howard’s decisions. He actually takes their judgement more seriously than even his best advisors. You get to them, you can get to Howard.”
Steve took in a deep breath, closing his eyes and huffing. "You know this wont be the first time this happens if you stay here. People will always be hunting you, genius or not."
has amazing photos of the hall for anyone who would like a reference! A picture of Toni's dress at the event can be found
Steve frowned, not pleased with her final statement and he eagerly took a long sip of his drink. “Not if I have anything to say about it.”
“No, I completely forgot to check my computer. Thanks for your help, Captain Obvious!” Tony snapped sarcastically and he shut his laptop.
How could he have done this? How could he have let his designs fall into the wrong hands? Now, Stane would use his weapon to take down Steve and Clint and the rest of the people who had treated him like family. Tony growled, the repulsor’s glow growing more radiant as he clenched his fist tighter. Tony’s weaponized hand shot out, aiming for his reflection as the repulsor gave a small whine. A beam of charged particles shot out and in the next moment, the glass was shattering and splaying across the floor.
Toni rubbed her good hand over her eyes, before she summoned the strength to heft herself up from the hay and into a sitting position. The movement sparked a sharp pain throughout her entire right side, something between a gasp and a pained squeak escaping her lips. It caught the couple’s attention, and the blonde was immediately moving towards her. “Easy, now. You’re going to make yourself pass out again if you push yourself too hard,” he warned, one large hand smoothing over her back to ground her.
Bruce smiled and patted Clint’s shoulder, stepping back. “You’re welcome," he murmured softly. Clint opened his mouth to say more when a small ding sound went off nearby. Bruce frowned,tilting his head. “That’s Tony’s computer," he mumbled, walking over to the laptop to find a program opened. There, on the white screen was a single sentence waiting for a reply.
“Of course. I may not like killing, but I’ll be damned if I grow up in my family and this business without knowing how to defend myself,” Toni muttered, sliding the magazine from the pistol to make sure there were still bullets loaded.
The arm was almost a complete size match to Bucky's live one, if not a little bigger. He laid it down beside Bucky and slowly attached it, making sure it was on and completely attached before stepping back. "Wow," he mumbled, slowly taking a seat.
“Hurts like a bitch,” Toni mumbled, glaring down at the offending limb before laying her head back in the straw tiredly. “Thank you. For resetting it.”
By early morning, the storm clouds began to disperse and the rain tapered off to a stop. Warm yellow sunlight filtered through the New York City skyline as the sun tipped over the horizon, blinding Steve where he sat staring out the window of the passenger seat. Beside him, Natasha drove quietly, dark eyes locked on the quiet streets. They had just finished their fifth shakedown of the night, but nobody in the city seemed to have any concrete clues as to where Bucky was or why he was taken. The most useful tip came from one of the event staff at the museum, who was all too willing to help after Steve slipped him a fifty dollar bill. The young waiter had apparently seen an unmarked, black SUV parked near the catering trucks the day before, one that had conveniently disappeared during the benefit before it could be towed. He had Clint working the lead, tracking the car’s whereabouts through a friend of his at the police department. But until the blonde called with his report, Steve was at a loss.
That made the blonde flare angrily, and Toni enjoyed seeing the way his hands balled into fists against the wood of the table. “And I’d be more concerned about you as an enemy if you had anything to back up your threat. But your sole backup is your father, who loves me. So your bark has no bite, Stark.” The blonde took up his suit jacket, tugging it on and making his way for the exit. “Have a wonderful day, Ms. Stark. And do try not miss any business opportunities in the future.”
Bucky waved his hand at her, shaking his head and pushing himself up. “She’s a lost cause, Stevie. Don’t waste your breath,” he muttered, offering his hand to the blonde. “Let’s get some sleep.”
Finally, she just gave Steve a small nod, stepping back and disappearing down the hallway before the blonde could catch her off guard again.
“Yeah, I’d hate for this to be a burden on your conscience,” he muttered sarcastically. “But I do want you to know my name so what you’ve done here, possible sentencing a man to death by taking all of his supplies, will stay with you. It’s-“
Tony frowned slightly, looking up to the boss. “How did you get those?" he asked, grip tightening on his fork.
Natasha was already ahead of them, dashing down the hallway and disabling anyone who passed them while Bucky picked off the stragglers that poked their heads out behind them. Tony followed along easily, just as happy to get the hell out of this place as Bucky was. "Did you miss me?" Tony grinned to Clint as he ducked behind a corner.
"The next day, there was an explosion in Tony’s chemistry class when his lab partner tried to mix chemicals." Clint mumbled, twiddling his thumbs and keeping his eyes on the ceiling. Bruce frowned, stepping closer slowly; he had remembered reading about that in the papers. Clint gave bitter chuckle, looking away. “I was out with a few friends when I got the call. I remember going to the hospital and seeing mom and dad in the waiting room." Clint paused, reaching up to quickly swipe at his eyes. “All I could think was that it was my fault. I told him I never wanted to see him and the next day, he nearly dies."
“I couldn’t sleep,” she finally worked out, watching the blonde approach her slowly. “Sorry if I woke you.”
The dining room was large, decorated with the finest art and furniture New York had to offer. In the center of the white marble floor sat a large, mahogany dining table where the boss was currently dining. The room was filled with silence, just how the boss liked it, until Justin Hammer strode into the room, a file in hand. He set the file beside the dining man, clearing his throat. “And what is this?” The boss asked, sitting back into his chair and regarding the file with a look as if it were offending him.
He was willing to admit that he shouldn’t have belittled the woman earlier. She was more than just a child trying to please her father, though Steve certainly knew that was a part of it. In truth, the reason why Howard Stark is able to command so much business and power in New York is because his daughter does such a seamless job covering his tracks both to the public and to the government. She oversaw a billion-dollar company that is a forefront in innovation. The Stark charities, originally coordinated by her late mother, were recognized by the public for their local and global outreach. Antonia was more than just a daddy’s girl, and she’s proven it.
Tony scoffed, anger crossing his face. "You fucking asshole! You're blaming me for all of this? I wake up to hear my brother sneaking out of the house at two in the morning. Of course I followed you, I was curious!" Tony snapped. "Now will someone tell me what is going on? Why the Hell were you fucking beating up that man?"
Tony felt weak in the knees, hands grabbing at the lab table to keep himself from falling over as Bucky tensed. Obadiah simple tutted, releasing his grip on Tony. “From now on, you two will be watched around the clock." He ordered as he moved for the door. “I see I’ve been going too easy on you. Well, I can fix that."
He brought the bottle to her lips, lifting her head enough for her to drink. She drained half of the bottle before she tipped her head away and cleared her throat. “Where are we?”
Steve turned to Clint and slowly nodded his head. “Pack your things. You’re coming to stay at the Estate with me and the others.”
Tony shrugged and leaned further against the counter, crossing his arms. “Well, yeah, I guess. I mean we both have similar interests in science and stuff. Nothing special.”
“She needed something, Stevie. Anything. It’s just one tablet; we’ll find her a box of Tylenol or ibuprofen or something to switch to when we loot. For now, she just had to get over this hump of pain,” Bucky insisted, laying the girl back down and smoothing a hand over his face. “For now, this is the best we can do.”
If the meeting had been rescheduled, why the hell had Ty come home so late that night? Why did he leave at all? Why did he meet with Obadiah? That ugly feeling she experienced leaving Roger’s house returned. Her fiancé was up to no good, and what if that meant Obadiah was involved? What could they be doing that required secrecy? Did her father know about this? Toni’s mind drifted to Rogers, to Bucky, and the ugly feeling only twisted her stomach further. Could it… would they…? Toni dropped the planner as if burned, staring down at the offending page. Suspicions were forming in the back of her head, half-formed and existent, even if Toni couldn’t put words to her thoughts. Right now, that all they were: suspicions. She had no right to go pointing fingers or getting her father involved unless she was absolutely sure Ty and Obadiah were up to something. Maybe-
"Couldn't you have just drugged him like me?" Tony hissed, hand resting gently on Bucky's chest and slightly comforted by the rise and fall of his breathing.
“I’m the one that fucking taught you how to shoot. I can lead one stupid little patrol,” Bucky snarled, pointing a finger right back at the blonde. “I’m not going to just sit here and take a little vacation while those bastards are out there.”
“Fine then, walk. I have the box so I get to see the pawns and I can-“ Bucky paused, sorting through the box in his lap and collecting the pieces in his hand. “Where the fuck is the car?”
“Fifteen minutes,” Sharon commented, briefly glancing over her shoulder towards the office door. “I suggest you intervene before they start throwing things.”
Toni watched as he sifted through the paperwork, making sure everything was in order. How quickly he could go from angry to calm, from ready to harm a man to glancing over paperwork. And, because she had a nasty habit for not letting things be, Toni decided to push. “You know, you had that man absolutely quaking when you hit the desk. Even I was moved by your show,” Toni commented idly, trailing manicured fingers along the leather- clad armrest lazily. “The Steve Rogers I met three years ago was a lot less…” Toni raked her eyes over the blonde quickly before smiling politely. “Brute. I mean, I knew you always had a temper, but I just assumed you got that from your father.”
Donovan hummed, eyes roaming over Tony’s face. “My boss want’s to know why you’re under The Captain’s protection. What exactly are doing for him?”
"Thank you," Tony murmured, giving Bucky a grateful look as the larger man only smiled and patted his shoulder.
“I’ll take care of it. I’ll distract her, maybe take her on a trip upstate for a few days to keep her busy.”
She did. Howard was five years into his illegal ventures and was thriving beautifully. The Starks had always come from old money, but Howard took his inheritance to a new level with his criminal maneuvering and it was taking notice. Toni’s sixth birthday party, which was celebrated with as much glitz and fanfare as her twenty-first, had ended in panic when the six-year-old guest of honor disappeared. It was two days before Howard’s men located her at a dingy motel just outside of the city. She had been watching cartoons, taking no notice to the word “ransom” that kept floating around, when the door caved in and Howard’s guards took out her captives. It was the first time she had seen someone die. It certainly wouldn’t be the last.
“We aren’t children, Mr. Rogers,” Toni returned petulantly, crossing her arms now and keeping her eyes trained on an undistinguishable member of the crowd on the far side of the room. “I think we can handle an argument. But if it would make you feel better, I suppose we can discuss a mutual apology. To spare your feelings and all.”
"One more word and I will have Bruce patch you up without anesthetics." Steve snapped, slowly moving towards the awaiting car that Rhodey and Dugan were immediately packing up in.
“About a mile out from the next town,” Bucky explained, capping the water and tucking it back into his bag. “We’re hoping to stock up on supplies and find you some pain meds. How’s the arm?”
Clint shook his head as he sat down at the table, digging into his waffles. “You’re gonna get your ass kicked, kid.”
Tony was now on hour twenty of no sleep and it was starting to show. He rubbed at his red eyes, downing a cup of coffee as he slowly began programming. He only had three more hours until lunchtime and Bucky still hadn't woken. Tony's first and only thought to help Bucky was to give him back an arm. Tony already had schematics for a glove like weapon on his flashdrive. All he had to do was change around some of the measurements. And add a few sensory patches to act like nerves.
Learning that her father wasn’t involved in this was liberating, and Toni felt the pressure of turning against her father and ruining his plans recede back into nothing. But there was still the matter that her godfather and her fiancé had acted without his knowledge, had made a big political move right under his nose and none of them had even suspected a thing. What had they hoped to accomplish with a war between Rogers and her father? The fact that Toni had discovered Barnes was sheer luck, so they had planned on keeping her just as in the dark as everyone else. The bigger question, Toni supposed she should be asking, was how deep did this hidden faction go? Just how many of her father’s men are involved?
"We're nearly there. The next grate is should be directly over the lab," Natasha hissed to Clint as she slowly maneuvered along the tight metal passageway.
Bucky rolled his eyes, following along two steps behind. “Yeah, I know you. Your moral compass is annoying as fuck, but it’s one of the reasons I love you, idiot.”
“Oh, really? Because, thanks to your lie, he thinks I dropped the ball on bringing forward a potential partner,” Toni snarled, pointing a finger at the blonde and leaning in. “The fact that he actually likes you is the only thing keeping me from taking you down, you hear me? Trying to use me was strike one, lying to my father about me was strike two, and strike three was going over my head and making me look bad to my father. I’d say you made an enemy out of me, but I don’t concern myself with lowlife troublemakers who need handouts to build their business.”
The mugger stood quietly before his boss, eyes down on the marble floor. The room was filled with a quiet hum, a calm yet chilling voice speaking up.
“Ty.” Toni’s voice cut through the room, sharp and commanding. “Remember what my father said about keeping a level head?” she asked calmly, collecting her jacket from the couch and shrugging it on. “Thank you, Mr. Rogers, for this… subpar meeting. I’m happy you finally stopped avoiding our scheduler, and do tell Mr. Barnes that I’m grateful he forced you to do this.”
. You cannot feel sorry for someone who just tried to rob you,” Bucky pointed his finger at the blonde, stalking towards him. “We certainly can leave her and we will.”
“Come on, Steve, give him a chance,” Bucky called from where he was currently trapped in a headlock.
"Of course, sir. Thank you," Tony whispered, watching as Obadiah left the lab, leaving Tony alone with Bucky. One day to help Bucky? Looks like another sleepless night.
Was Clint fucking serious? Tony opened his mouth to yell out to Clint when he heard footsteps shuffling down the stairs and the front door shut.
that Stane had been planning this kidnapping as the great catalyst of his coup. That still didn’t make Steve feel better. Steve pushed off the dressed and walked to the foot of the bed, arms crossed and jaw set. “I’m still going to do better from now on. Perhaps review our security measures and our check-in routines among the patrols and staff.”
Tony's stomach flipped at the sight of Steve as the blonde stepped out and lifted Tony into the back seat, allowing Clint to have the passenger seat while Bucky and Natasha squeezed amongst the guns in the back. "Steve," Tony huffed, barely audible as the blonde squeezed into the seat beside him.
. Your apartment is not safe. And I cannot bring you home where a lot of my men have access to our house, when I don’t know which of them have betrayed the family. But I am going to weed them out, reorganize my entire outfit. And until I have gotten things in order, I need you somewhere safe. They wouldn’t dare come near Steve’s house just yet.” Howard turned his gaze back on Steve. “Can I count on you to protect her?”
,” she muttered with all the exasperation of a moody teenager. “Do you two have a destination in mind?”
Loki grunted, watching as Clint and Bruce slowly trailed into the room to see what Steve’s plan would be. “H-how did you…find out?" He managed out around a cough, eyes narrowing on Steve.
“Good, she needs the rest.” Bucky lifted the bag, setting it onto the counter. “Supermarket is clear. Had two walkers roaming the aisles, but I made short work of them. Just grabbed some things for tonight; figured we could head back in the morning to go through everything else.”
The man huffed at her bluntness, reaching towards her but the brunette took one step back and just out of his reach with a shit-eating grin. “There’s hardly anything for you to take. I’m low on supplies.”
Clint glared after Bucky before looking to Bruce. “Go keep an eye on him,” Clint said and Bruce chuckled, standing and moving out.
Clint laughed, ushering Tony on until they were out the front door, running for the main gate as Bucky paused to pick off the posted guards from afar. As soon as the four burst from the estate ground and onto the main road, an armored car pulled along side them and the back door opened. "Need a ride?"
“Steve informed me that you two were acquaintances,” Howard waved his hand dismissively at first. Toni’s eyes snapped up to meet Steve’s, and she spotted a flicker of worry flash in his eyes. So the man had lied? Now
Howard continued on, and Toni was grateful he either didn’t hear the comment or chose to ignore it. “Steve needs to learn to handle these types of messes himself. The more power he accumulates, the more people are going to try and get to him. You remember what happened during your sixth birthday?”
Natasha made a small sound in the back of her throat from where she was perched carefully at the top of the wall, watching as a patrol of guards and snarling dogs moved past. “We’re good. Get up here and take out the guards in the corner posts.”
Tony bit his lip and looked down to his ravioli, taking a slow bite, so concentrated on his thoughts of Steve that he didn’t even notice Bucky tapping on his arm. “Hey, kid? Kid!” He huffed, snapping his fingers in front of Tony’s line of sight. “What do you think? Should Steve give us the night off for a movie night?”
Bucky patted his shoulder, giving it a reassuring squeeze. “We’ll figure out something, alright? Just keep doing what your doing and wait for the idea to hit us."
Loki doubled over as far as he could as Bucky’s fist collided into his stomach. He sent a dark glare to Bucky, huffing. “I never liked you." He mumbled.
“It isn’t that easy, Bucky. I dont want him knowing about all the shit I do,” Clint huffed and crossed his arms. “The kid is a magnet for trouble. He doesn’t need
Tony winced at the loud voice, cradling his head in a hand as he slowly and cautiously moved to the man sitting at the end of the table. The boss was finely dressed, with a smile that showed all teeth, both welcoming and terrifying at the same time. “Careful, Tony. You’ll still be experiencing some side effects from the drug." Tony’s eyes followed the voice to see Loki, walking over to the man.
“I’ve known him a long time; I know what to expect from him. He’ll never cheat, he’s just a flirt,” Toni commented, with a simple shrug of her shoulders. “So am I. A match made in heaven.”
Tony shrugged slowly and twiddled his thumbs, looking away. “I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to make him weapons but…if I don’t…" Tony trailed off, nodding towards the screen.
“Do not touch me. I asked you to leave me alone.” Tony muttered, sitting up, but not getting off the bed. Good. At least he was running from Steve like last night.
Bucky was confused now. Who was this woman they were worried about? Who wanted a brawl between Steve and Stark?
The living room was dimly lit by the screen of Tony’s laptop, shadows splayed across the walls as the silence was filled by the clicks of Tony’s fingers flying across the keyboard. He sat on the couch amongst a bundle of blankets, an empty coffee cup on the end table beside him. His fingers paused for a moment as he leaned back to look over his work, a proud smirk stretching across his tired face. He was about to continue typing when a hand reached over his shoulder and closed the laptop. “Time for bed, kid,” Clint’s voice came with a soft chuckle.
Tony woke to a large weight moving on top of him, straddling his waist as the cold barrel of a gun pressed against his forehead. He opened his eyes, finding a large blonde smirking down at him. “We’ve been looking for you, Tony.”
That comment seemed to catch Bucky’s attention and his dark gaze found Steve’s immediately. “Are you doubting my ability, Rogers? After all the jobs and patrols I’ve run for you, you think I’m some inexperienced criminal who’s gonna let myself get snatched again?”
Steve flinched again, softly bringing his hand away from Tony’s chin. “Listen, Im sorry and I know I hurt you-“
The office door slid open, and Toni’s head snapped up as Ty shuffled tiredly into the room. He was rubbing his eyes, though he had been awake enough to pull on his boxers when he left the bedroom. “Toni, it’s four in the fucking morning.”
Clint shook his head. "Had a bad day. He usually isn't this cold once he get's to know you, which he wont. You're staying away from them and keeping to your usual schedule. You aren't getting into all of this."
“My father ran our business into the ground. Took me a few years to turn our yearly profits positive again and weed out the responsible company. Now it’s me and a few of my best and most trusted friends,” Steve explained, turning fully to face Howard, gaining more confidence as he spoke and it showed in the way he straightened his shoulders and stepped closer. “I want to do more. I want to expand my operations, reach a larger base and develop a territory of my own. No longer the middle man, but
“Rogers. Steve Rogers,” the blonde supplied his hand, meeting Howard’s with a firm shake. “I move medication around the city.”
Bruce glanced up, offering that same awkward smile as before and motioning to his hands as they cleaned the wound. “I would shake your hand, Ms. Stark, but…”
“Obviously,” Toni agreed, finally tipping the bottle and filling his glass. “You probably don’t want to hear this right now, but Steve made the right call. You’re still recovering.”
Tony snorted, glaring darkly at Steve. "Are we really gonna have this talk? I get the gist: keep my mouth shut or I'll be swimming with the fishes, right?" Tony hissed sarcastically but Steve's expression didn't falter.
Toni glowered, slumping back against the couch and taking a breath. Fine. The wanted to make an enemy out of her, she’d show them. She waited, listening to the sounds of their soft voices in the bedroom as they settled down for sleep.  Even after they grew silent, Toni waited until she was sure they had to be asleep. Using the light of the candle, she sprang into action. Untying the shoelaces of her converses, Toni carefully threaded one lace through the loop of the zip tie using her fingers and teeth. Once through, Toni tugged the lace back down towards her shoes and tied it in a knot using the lace of her other shoe. Leaning onto her back, Toni rotated her feet in the air as if pedaling a bicycle, allowing the tied laces to thread back and forth through the zip tie. The friction of the flossing motion weakened the cable, and with a sharp tug, Toni snapped her bindings. Oh, those fuckers were screwed now.
Steve laughed, a low, humorless rumble that had Toni raising a brow as she leaned against the doorframe. “The boxes came loose, huh?”
“Scotch.” Toni lifted the bottle, though she paused before filling his glass. “Should you be drinking on medication?”
Toni stopped before her, gingerly taking the stack. “Thank you. I really appreciate it,” she returned sincerely, placing the clothes on the dresser.
Steve snarled at the thought, slamming the emptied glass down onto his desk. “It’s not that easy, Bucky. You think you can come up with another importer on such short notice?”
“I brought you some of my old clothes,” Natasha commented, raising the neatly folded stack in her hands. “It’s been a long time since I’ve stayed here for anything longer than a few nights, but I was able to dig these up from the back of the closet in my old room.”
"We need to get going. Steve's going to be here any minute to pick us up and we still have a mansion to fight our way out of," she said briskly.
Tony woke late the next morning, groaning softly as he sat up in the large, comfortable bed. Where the Hell was he? He glanced around the room, spotting his two backpacks in the corner and huffing. That’s right, Clint forced him to live in Steve’s Estate. As if he didn’t already run into the annoying mob boss enough.
"Now, now," The boss said, looking to Tony before patting the seat to the right of him. “Don’t be rude, Anthony. If it wasn’t for Loki, you and I wouldn’t have met," he said, as if Tony should be grateful for the fact. “Now have a seat, you must be starving."
But despite her amazing business record, Steve wouldn’t pretend that he didn’t find her personality volatile. She was quick to anger underneath that calm and collected mask of hers, constantly preparing for a fight that would never come if she didn’t instigate it. Maybe it was more than seeking drama, however; Toni’s anger seemed to originate from an inability to trust. It would certainly explain why she fixated on Steve’s plan to use her to get to her father. And three years after than encounter, Steve was willing to admit that he screwed up. When he first met the girl, she had him charmed him- so much so that, in another life, Steve probably would have been sweet on her; he always did have a thing for witty brunettes. But not this life. He had seen too much of her anger, had allowed her to worm her way under his skin until he was no better than her. Toni had brought up his father today with the intention of striking a nerve and Steve was all too willing to return the favor.
“You know, “Steve murmured, tapping a finger on the table. “Your chances of survival are much higher if you’re with a group. But there’s no chance of anyone traveling with you if they’re worried you’ll screw them over.”
"Are you okay?" Clint asked, hands on Bruce’s hips to keep him steady as the doctor nodded. “It was small. Only enough to damage a quarter of the lab." Bruce mumbled, brushing himself slowly. Looking around, he felt better knowing that all of the computers, including Tony’s, were still operational.
At the entrance to the sitting room, Toni’s breathing grew shallow, her hand fisted in Bucky’s dress shirt only gripping tighter. After a moment of steeling herself, she looked around the corner. Ty was standing at the bar, finishing off one glass before moving to take up the second one he had presumably poured for Toni. His back wasn’t completely facing them, enough so that one look to his left would expose their escape. But his eyes were on his phone, so maybe this could just work. Toni looked to Bucky and gave a nod, stepping them forward quietly. Her breath was caught in her throat, the silence blaring in her ears as she tried to pull Bucky closer towards the front door. He was holding his bullet wound with his free hand, blood staining his fingers the more he jostled the bullet with every step. But his eyes remained locked forward and his face was neutral, if not slightly determined. His resilience after being so terribly injured and tortured was almost frightening. While Toni had only ever seen Bucky’s sarcastic, flirty charm, she could see why he was deemed one of the most brutal killers in the business. Why Steve had him as a top enforcer.
Toni scoffed, raising an eyebrow when the blonde twisted her around his hip to dip her towards the wood-paneled floor. “Please tell me you didn’t ask me to dance just to debate our personal philosophies. I don’t care much for the humanities.”
Bucky rolled his eyes, adjusting his arm the slightest bit under Bruce’s instruction as the doctor worked. “I don’t need your protection. I shouldn’t have been naïve enough to let someone get the jump on me. And even then, these guys had been planning this whole scheme for a long time. We can’t blame ourselves just because the enemy had a good plan.”
“It’s not fine. It’s broken,” Bucky snapped back, but with more frustration at the situation than anger at her.
His voice was raw and raspy, throat sore from extensive sobs that had burned his throat. His eyes were red and puffy from the salty tears that have streamed down his cheeks. Sniffling, he slowly sat up, stiff joints popping as he slip to the end of the bed. He had to get up. Sure, he was upset and angry, but he had to show everyone that it that more than a heartbreak to hold Tony Stark down. But it was Steve who broke his heart.
“It’s great to see you. If I had known you were stopping by, I would’ve pushed back my plans,” Toni admitted, opening the door wider to the man in invitation. “But I was just about to go meet with Rhodey. Is there anything I can do for you?”
“I was a sick kid once too,” Steve reminded the doctor, before leaning against the dresser on the wall opposite of Bucky, staring his best friend down. “You think the worst of it is over?”
Toni smiled, something small and genuine and Steve actually felt himself falter a moment at the sight of it. “Well, it’ll make my dad worry a little less, so I guess that is a plus for both him and me.”
“Wait,” Steve blinked, trying to catch the brunette’s hand as she pulled away from him. “That’s not what I-“
The boss sat back in his chair, resting his chin on his palm. “There’s computer programs, all self-written and coded perfectly. There’s blueprints and designs for buildings, cars and…weapons,” the boss’s eyes glinted as he stood. “Almost to intricate for anyone to understand but him. This must be why Rogers has him protected.” He shut the laptop, grabbing the flashdrive and tucking it safely into his pocket.
Bucky slowly pushed himself up, eyes wide with awe as he studied the replacement. Although it was nothing compared to his own arm, which Bucky was still pissed about for losing, he had to admit this arm was amazing. They way it synced with his nerves and did everything he wanted it to do. “But who…" Bucky glanced around the lab he was laying in, eyes widening as they landed on a sleeping brunette hunched over a nearby lab table. “Tony?" Bucky asked, rubbing his face.
I'm alive! I'm so sorry, I definitely did not intend for a month and a half to go by before updating! August was such a long month between birthdays and moving back to college. I'm really going to try and be better now that everything has settled, so without further ado, here's the next chapter!
But the walker that had spooked her only moments before was now of no concern to Toni. The only thing the brunette could truly process was the sharp pain in her right arm, wedged between her stomach and the rock ground. Left hand shakily pressing into the stone, Toni tried to force herself up but to no avail; her elbow buckled and she landed back down hard on her injured arm. A pained sound escaped her lips, fresh tears trailing down her cheeks as she slammed her left hand into the ground in a vain attempt to compose herself and block out the excruciating discomfort. So this was how she’d die, huh? No blaze of glory, no fiery end, just lying at the bottom of a cliff with a dead hunter who couldn’t even eat her.
Steve snorted, finishing his last punch before turning to Tony and walking over, towering over the boy. “That’s because you’re out of shape,” Steve said, nudging Tony’s stomach with his foot before moving over to his water bottle.
“Told you,” Steve said softly, rubbing his thumb in slow circles to uncoil the muscle. “Better?” he asked, moving his free hand to Tony’s opposite shoulder, rubbing it slowly.
Clint huffed and moved over, pinching Bucky’s ear and pulling him to the far side of the mat. “You’re with me today, Barnes,” Clint huffed.
That seemed to settle Toni’s nerves marginally. Rogers was a dick and Bucky was his cheeky accomplice; she shouldn’t care what happened to either of them. In fact, having them self-imploding would make her life much easier. It would finally be pay back for Steve treating her the way he did when they met. And despite the satisfaction that would bring her, Toni refused to justify a man being taken and harmed just to give someone a favorable edge in a deal or territory. Business could be done without being built on the blood of others.
Steve smirked, shaking his head and moving past Tony. “Anything to help out a damsel,” Steve teased and Tony growled.
Tony’s heart clenched as he spotted Bruce and a man sitting in the lab while a girl was sleeping on the couch. They look so relaxed, not even realizing how close they were to being blown to pieces. He swallowed, looking up to Obadiah. “I’ll do my best," he murmured.
Seated on one of the stools was Stark, her back to Bucky though the tense line of her shoulders told him she was aware of an intrusion. She was still in her blouse and jeans, though her once neat ponytail had lost a few small strands by her ears. She looked bored, elbow on the bar counter and cheek propped up in her palm, one manicured nail tracing the rim of her glass. Bucky guessed he wasn’t the only one stuck in this house. “Why is it I always find you around either food or booze?”
“Tony, that isn’t fair!” Steve argued, standing up. “Do not use that against me. I know I never dated her but I still cared about her!”
Tony glanced up to Bruce, smiling widely. “Brucie, I think this is the start of a beautiful friendship.”
By the end of the day, Tony was beat and sore, resting on the sparring mat with his face pressed into the cushioned ground. Bruce had long since moved on to his lab while Clint and Bucky went off to start dinner, leaving Tony alone with Steve, who was still going at it with the punching bag. “I don't know how you can keep that up,” Tony mumbled, rolling onto his back to look to Steve. “I'm exhausted.”
Bucky raised a hand, holding between his thumb and index finger a thin piece of plastic cable. Only then did Steve grasp the situation. The girl was gone, and with her, their possessions. Steve’s shotgun, his knife, Bucky’s backpack, all of the supplies from Steve’s bag, gone. Steve glanced towards the entrance and although the door was still closed, the chair they had barricaded it with the night before was moved to the side. “I told you she would fuck us over. And we didn’t even hear her do it! That tiny kid snuck around us, got our weapons while we were sleeping, and took off with everything.”
"What’s your plan then?" Steve asked, watching as Clint tugged at the locked door and in two seconds flat, Clint had the window shattered and the alarm blaring.
It wasn’t until Steve’s cellphone rang that the table immediately went silent, as if it were an unspoken roll that when business called, you were to sit still and shut up. “Hello…What?…How did this happen?…Alright, Nat, we’ll be there.” Steve hung up and tucked his phone away, standing immediately. “Natasha and Phil are under heavy fire at the club on South Street.” He explained and the others were immediately standing. “Bruce, you’re coming too. Phil got hit in the arm.”
“I suggest we get moving to the next town then,” Steve murmured, laying Toni back down and passing his backpack to his husband to carry. “If we’re lucky, there will be a doctor’s office or a pharmacy we can raid. She’s at least going to need some painkillers.”
Toni nodded slowly. She didn’t say anything more, but Bucky could see it in her eyes. For someone who prided herself on her mask, she had such
Toni went still, jaw clenching as she eyed her father. He was serious, he really wanted to take on this liar as a partner. Toni could expose the man for what he did, but what good would it do? Howard liked his proposal, whatever it has been, and wanted him on board. And Toni was now out of favor for not catching the man sooner for her father like she had done many times before. The worry had disappeared from Steve’s eyes, as if he realized her predicament the moment she did. Toni had no choice. “You’re right. It was an oversight on my part to not bring him in sooner. I just wanted to make sure he was the right fit before wasting your valuable time,” Toni finally muttered, stabbing her fork into a strawberry with a cold glare locked on Steve. “But it looks like everything worked out, didn’t it?”
Neither party seemed willing to give an answer, and Bucky glared Steve down until the man finally huffed in exasperation. “Ms. Stark was dropping off contracts for her father,” he muttered, slowly sinking back into his chair.
Steve straightened out, giving Tony a soft look. “Listen, I know you’re just a little bit freaked out by what happened, but-“
“It’s fine. The bigger worry is what will be done with Obadiah and Tiberius. What they have done is-“
“And I told you that you are no help to Bucky sleep deprived and starving,” she calmly shot back, finally turning to face the blonde with her hands planted on her hips. “So I gave you something to help.”
This made Obadiah from as he took the tablet, studying the surveillance video the agent had pulled. He watched as a man and women slipped into the door, moving down the hallway before the man gave the red-headed woman a boost into one of the vents overhead before he followed. “Well, it looks like the Captain has finally sent some agents from us to play with,” Obadiah grinned.
Bucky nodded. “I know, we all are. Look, just go get some dinner and rest. I’ll handle the patrol tonight, okay?"
The town- if it could even be called that; more like a small group of buildings that converged on the intersection of two small roads- was empty. The roads were decorated with thousands of brightly colored leaves, splotches of orange and red and yellow littered across the decaying asphalt. The windows of each little shop were shattered, empty boxes and used supplies spilling out onto the sidewalk. A blonde man stepped over the debris, blue eyes locked on a small pharmacy on the corner. His jeans were smeared with dirt, the fabric torn in places where they had obviously gotten snagged. His white t-shirt was in a similar state of distress, though less visible under his well-worn leather jacket. A backpack was perched on his back, sagging in a tell-tale way that revealed he had little supplies inside. His only other accessory was a 12 gauge, bolt action shotgun that he had propped against his shoulder.
Tony glanced down, sighing in frustration as his fingers fumbled with the wires for the third time. "Great," he huffed angrily, setting down the circuit board again and rubbing his tired face. He hadn't gotten to much sleep the night before and now, he was running on nothing but coffee and sugar.
Steve moved after him, stepping out into the back parking lot. “Please don’t tell me we’re doing what I think we are. I leave you in charge of making a plan
“Doing what?” Bucky asked, stepping over the unconscious girl and taking his own knife from the sheath strapped to his thigh. “Hanging out?”
Looking up, Bucky spied Tony hunched over the lab table, face in his hands as his shoulders quivering lightly in the cold lab. Moving over, Bucky placed his hands on Tony’s shoulders, turning the man around so that they faced each other. In the darkened lights of the lab, Tony’s eyes gleamed. With tears, Bucky didn’t know. Tony’s shadowed face did little to hide the frown setting in as Tony turned his head to look away. “Tony? Talk to me, buddy.”
Steve rolled his eyes, placing his hands to the floor to slow his fall as Bucky pulled up a chair and stepped up to cut him loose from the trap. “Very funny,” he muttered, his feet hitting the ground before he pushed himself up. “Took you long enough to find me.”
It was the thunder that woke Toni, not that she had been sleeping very well to begin with. The glass rattled in the windows, followed moments later by another flash of lightning that briefly illuminated the dark bedroom. An arm was slung around her bare waist, Ty’s soft breaths rhythmically washing over the back of her neck. Toni lifted her head to glance over her shoulder, finding her fiancé’s expression oddly serene. He was out cold, then. Deciding that it was pretty clear she wouldn’t be able to fall back asleep anytime soon, Toni carefully shifted free from Ty’s hold and stood from the bed. She grabbed her robe from the closet door as she passed, shrugging it on over her bare form as she padded her way out of the bedroom and down the hallway to the living room.
Tony groaned, setting the computer aside and standing with a huff, turning to give Clint a look. “I was almost done,” he complained, rubbing his face. “And Im twenty years old, stop calling me ‘kid’.”
Tony sat down at the nearest lab bench, opening his computer and his latest program, fingers flying as he typed. After a moment, Tony spoke, not even glancing up. “You mistake is in the top left-hand corner. The variable of the equation should be cubed, not squared. That’s why it wont work.”
Steve gave him a soft look, but finally obliged and moved to one of the corners to lay out the blanket. “Fine. But at least eat something. Don’t think I didn’t notice you giving me more of the soup earlier.” The blonde approached, leaning in and pressing his lips to Bucky’s for a brief moment. “Goodnight. Wake me in a few hours for my turn.”
Amusement flickered across Howard’s expression as he accepted his drinks, sliding one martini towards Steve. Not the blonde’s first choice, but when Howard Stark offers you a drink? Take it. “My daughter? I assume you know her, seeing as you’re at her birthday party. That, and you even managed to steal a dance with her,” Howard commented, peering over the rim of his glass as he took a sip, gaze relaxed but Steve knew better; the businessman was sizing him up.
They had been walking for nearly seven hours, only taking a break once to split a bottle of water and a can of expired soup between the two of them. The forest had given away to overgrown cornfields, but the sun was setting rapidly and they were still at least a mile out from the next town. As much as Bucky wanted to push forward to their destination, the lack of light did not create an optimal situation for passing dense fields and a new, possibly overrun town. They needed shelter for the night.
“Way to go,” Bucky said, tossing Clint back. “You got a hit against the Captain.” he grinned, ignoring the pointed glare from Steve.
Bucky sighed softly and moved to him, tilting Tony’s head to meet his eyes. “Here’s what we’re going to do. You’re going to make these weapons and we’ll try to get a message or clue out to Steve so that he can find us. Stane is one of his rivals."
Toni’s head cocked to the side, and although they were currently stopped at a red light, she resolutely kept her eyes glued to the road. “What about my apartment…right,” She stopped herself. “My apartment, which Ty has keys to and will probably never be safe for me to return to again. So…Steve’s house.”
Antonia Stark’s twenty-first birthday came with a flash of gold, New York’s wealthiest gathering beneath the glittering chandeliers of Stark Mansion to celebrate the young woman. Expensive jewelry caught the light beautifully, in the same way as the cigar smoke curling towards the high ceilings. Haughty laughter and clinking glasses overshadowed the band’s soft classical, the party’s clashing melody echoing up to the top of the staircase where the young Stark stood.
eyes. Bucky could tell she appreciated what he was doing now, making her feel less vulnerable after opening herself up. He was going to make a shitty joke about Toni’s presences bringing their group up to a total of four functioning arms, but Steve’s voice beat him to it.
“You know that’s not the Stark I was talking about,” Bucky shot back. “You two are going to kill each other one of these days. I know you both are incredibly stubborn, but if one of you managed to pull your head out of your ass and apologize, you’d save so many people so much grief.”
“Slept in the lab,” Tony mumbled as he stood, sipping from the bottle and shrugging with a wince. “Not the best to sleep bent over a lab table,” he said.
When Steve woke, it was to the sound of chirping birds. He was in his bedroom, sprawled out across his made bed, still in his suit from the day before. When had he gone to bed? He planted his hands flat to the mattress, pushing up to his knees and groaning at the popping in his stiff joints. He loosened his tie and tugged it off just as the bedroom door opened, Natasha stalking into the room and straight for the windows. With a sharp tug she opened the curtains, allowing sunlight to filter in. Steve winced at the bright intrusion, rubbing the heel of his hands against his eyes. “What time is it?”
"No." Tony shook his head and looked down. “I’ve been acting so tired lately that Obadiah thought I needed an assistant."
"Come on, Hammer’s boys should be coming soon," Clint hissed, grabbing Steve’s arm and ducking them to hide behind their own armored vehicle. “I have Natasha positioned on the roof with a rifle. She’ll take out the guards and we’ll grab Hammer."
Toni looked back to the road, quiet for a long moment as she digested his words. Finally, she gave a jerky nod. “You’re right. I was sure dad wasn’t involved, I was just afraid…” Toni cleared her throat and straightened out. Sure that he had sufficiently calmed some of her nerves, Bucky leaned back into his seat with a groan. “We should really be taking you to a hospital.”
Steve nodded, parting the group as he moved over to the map to stand beside Clint. “That sounds good. Clint, I’ll have you lead one team and I’ll lead the other.”
Toni hummed, swallowing thickly and staring down at the food rather than meet Bucky’s inquisitive gaze. “Shockingly, I’m actually looking and feeling a lot better than I did earlier today. A friend of mine helped me see just how inconsequential Ty and Obadiah are. They’re beneath me; they aren’t worth my time and I certainly won’t spend any more of it mourning their loss.”
Bruce nodded and touched Clint’s shoulder. “We’ll find him, Clint. We will." He whispered quietly. “Come on, why don’t you and I set the table. Bucky and Steve can finish up."
"Didn’t even see the bastards," Phil spat through gritted teeth as Bruce pulled on a pair of gloves and began working the bullet out.
“I couldn’t even save him myself. I couldn’t even put myself between him and death. I can’t lose him again.”
"Hey, hold on a second!" Tony snapped, noting the second Steve’s eyes darkened and wedged himself between the two. "First of all, Im a big boy, Clint. I can take care of myself. I don’t need you fighting my battles for me." Tony said. "Second of all, I like Steve, a lot. I’m sorry we didn’t run it by you first but it’s my life. Okay?"
Steve tries one last attempt to get Tony's forgiveness, but can a note say everything he needs it to say?
Ty looked over her, and Toni had the strange feeling he was accessing her. Finally, he nodded his head, as if deeming her to be telling the truth. “Right, sorry. Go ahead.”
“Are you kidding? I actually wanted to talk to you about it at the fundraiser, but you were running off to hide you and that big brain of yours in the corner,” Toni teased gently, gaze flicking towards Bucky’s shoulder. Steve watched her blue eyes travel over the wound, not breaking contact until Bruce was wrapping over his shoulder and upper torso with gauze. “How are you feeling, Barnes?”
Bruce sighed and nodded slowly, meeting Clint’s eyes and stepping slightly closer. “How are you handling this?" He asked gently and brushed a hand against Clint’s arm.
Tony huffed, slowly moving up the stairs. “Good night!” He called, grumbling softly under his breath as he moved straight to his bed, flopping down onto the covers and groaning softly. As much as he loved Clint, the man was way to motherly for a brother. He pressed his face into his pillow, yawning and slowly drifting off.
Bucky hooked his arm around her shoulders, leaning heavily on the smaller brunette as they took to the stairs one at a time, Toni doing her best to urge them along without straining Bucky. “Our car is parked out front, keys still in it.” She was whispering now as they approached the cellar door. “We were expecting to just pick up Obadiah and go but he’s running late. We just have to make it past the sitting room without getting Ty’s attention and we’re golden.”
So this wasn’t Stark’s doing, not that that was a thought that crossed his mind. But someone wanted Steve to turn on Stark. Why? For what gain? It would be better to pretend to be unconscious, to get as much information as possible, but if this fucker nudged him one more time-
Bucky huffed, tensing as his fists clenched. "They know you're here. That asshole of a guard came in here and took him. Said Obadiah was taking him on a little trip and hit me with his gun before I could stop him."
Bucky’s gruff tone caught Steve’s attention, and he turned to find his husband studying the girl in his arms with a furrowed brow. Her eyes were closed in a pained wince, but Steve was sure she was sleeping. How she could sleep with the rain and- no, he got it. Sleeping was better than feeling the pain. “Doctor’s office,” Steve agreed, touching Bucky’s arm and leading him forward.
“But,” Howard finally sighed, rubbing a hand over his face tiredly. “If it makes you feel better, Steve had I have our monthly meeting scheduled for tomorrow. I can check on his progress with his hunt then.”
Steve and his team move to bring down the factory while Clint and Natasha head to Stane's manor to rescue Tony and Bucky.
The car pulled to a stop beside a large apartment building, and Ty straightened out with a tired sigh. “Thank you for the ride home,” he declared, clapping Howard on the shoulder before Happy opened the back door. Ty stepped out underneath Happy’s umbrella, turning to offer Toni his hand. “Come on, babe. I need a drink after that dreadful benefit.”
. She knew the face beneath. Time felt as if it had slowed down, and no matter how quick she moved, it didn’t feel fast enough. She closed the cellar door silently behind her and descended the steps, breath caught in her throat as her pace slowed to a stop before the restrained figure. Anticipation buzzed in Toni’s limbs, a sick kind of dread settling in her stomach. That same twist in the gut that came with expecting bad news or watching someone get injured badly. She reached one hand forward delicately, fingers wavering as they bunched in the dark cloth and tugged the sack from the captive’s head in one quick jerk. Blue eyes met brown and, for a moment, they could only stare at each other. It was Bucky who broke the silence.
“Absolutely not. Two weeks rest, at the very minimum,” Steve insisted, stepping around Toni to get a better look at his friend. “I mean we just got you back and you want to go throwing yourself to the wolves all over again!”
Will Tony ever be able to settle into the Estate? Will this flashdrive bring him into a whole new world of trouble?
“Im heading out for the night, kid.” Clint said as he padded into the living room, finding Tony sitting on the couch, studying his computer screen. He let out a sigh, nudging Tony. “Come on,Tone, say something. You cant sit around here and ignore me forever. You’ll forgive me eventually.”
Unaware of how much time had passed, Toni nearly jolted when a hand brushed her shoulder and Justin was blocked from dragging her further across the dance floor. Toni tilted her head up, meeting the crystal blue eyes of a blonde man. His tuxedo was sharp and fitted, hinting at broad shoulders and strong arms beneath the fabric. He wore a boyish grin that could have anyone weak in the knees, though Toni could tell by his darting gaze that he was analyzing every aspect of what was before him. “May I cut in?”
"Great. Than we have no more use for you." Clint growled, grinning as he stepped forward, gun ready.
Steve nodded slowly and clapped Bucky’s shoulder before moving to the door. “Thanks, Buck." He murmured as Bucky followed after him, shutting off the light and leaving Loki in the dark.
"I don’t care, Loki. You will talk." Steve snarled, fists clenching as he stood straighter. “This interrogation is far from over. Even if it takes every single day, I will make sure you suffer slowly until you confess." Steve snarled lowly, his own fist connecting to Loki’s face.
, but… she had to admit, things seemed to be going a little easier for them now that she had stopped actively fighting their help. Having them around to pick up her slack while her arm was wrapped up was proving to be useful and Toni was quickly beginning to realize that she’d need their help for quite a while moving forward. At least, if she had any hope of making any headway towards Ontario.
“It’s Ty’s humbleness that won me over,” Toni muttered, finishing off the wine and patting her fiancé’s knee reassuringly when he made an indignant sound.
Steve nodded, gripping the back of his chair and drumming his fingers against the wooden support. “I feel we should talk about…what happened earlier today. Some things were said that I think we both didn’t mean.”
Rhodey readily caught her as she dove forward into his arms, standing up and lifting her with him. He turned to take a seat on the end of the bed, Toni settled in his lap with her face pressed into his shoulder. After a moment, a sob racked through her small body and Rhodey tightened his grip around her. “It’s okay to feel, baby girl. You know it is. Holding all this in isn’t going to help you. Nothing better for a clean reset than getting it all out,” he whispered encouragingly against her ear.
. But that was another matter entirely. At the sound of the toaster going off, Clint turned to Thor. Tony barely knew the blonde, would he really go for him? Besides, last time Clint had check, Thor was babbling about a woman he met at the club…Jane, right?
isn’t necessary. I’m doing just fine alone," Tony insisted, sitting straighter in his seat. He was doing just fine sitting in the lab alone. He was sure there were cameras on him but he felt better knowing he was in solitary.
The girl was sprawled across the padded exam table, but her eyes were half-lidded as she watched Bucky root through the cabinets. “I can’t see a damn thing- here, give me that,” Bucky took the flashlight, pulling out the various boxes of tongue depressors, gauze, gloves and other supplies. “We should have found a pharmacy first, this doctor has shit for pain meds. I mean I know they write prescriptions, but you’d think they’d have the hard stuff locked up somewhere around here for emergencies.”
Tony staggered back, finding himself looking straight down the barrel of a gun his own brother drew on him. Tony’s voice came out quiet, strangled with a mixture of horror and anger. “Clint?”
. Toni took a breath and followed her fiancé inside, offhandedly thanking Raza on her way. It could be a coincidence, like Ty just happened to guess which way to go, driven by his hunt for alcohol. But Toni was losing faith; there were just too many coincidences happening. Her decision was made: Toni would ask Ty and Obie at lunch what they’ve been working on together. She could ask about their business together and push hard until she receives a satisfactory answer. Obadiah might stay strong, but Ty would slip up. He already has twice, she just needs a concrete answer.
So lost in his thoughts, Tony barely noticed Steve slipping out of the room until he caught the sound of a door closing at the top of the stairs. With one last glance around the room, Tony moved up the stairs, padding down the hallway to Steve's door before sliding into his bedroom.
Toni shrugged her shoulders. “Because I’m smart, and it’s much easier to steal supplies from people. They do all the looting for me so I don’t have to.”
“Im sorry, boss,” Lou whispered, looking down. “But I’ll do better, next time. In and out and Rogers wont even know.”
. Even with Rhodey of all people. The man shuffled forward, pausing to crouch before Toni and touch her chin. “Baby girl?” The nickname was an unfair move on his part and Toni felt her fists clench.
Maybe it would be a quick death, like a bullet in the head. But Bucky wasn’t an optimist; most in this line of work, especially the ones into kidnappings, were sick fucks with violent streaks a mile wide. His captors made it clear they would kill him soon, but that didn’t mean it wasn’t going to be a slow death. And even if he didn’t die, it would be just as much torture to see Steve blame himself for Bucky’s disappearance as he was prone to doing. Steve’s guilt would weigh just as heavily on Bucky. All in all, it didn’t look like Bucky would win either way.
was one of his limits. But Rogers made her so… angry. Angry enough that she wanted to lash out, to hurt him in the same way she was sure he felt. It was toxic. And to think her father though she’d like that, the challenge Steve posed for her. So much so that Toni still remembered her blunt laughter when her father suggested Steve as a potential date for her, all those years ago.
"You needed an assistant, so I got one you'd be comfortable with." Obadiah grinned, walking over and wrapping an arm around Tony's shoulders. "Took him down last night while he was doing on of Rogers' pathetic patrols."
"Yeah, well this hot little thing isn’t for your amusement." Tony hissed angrily and tried to shrug Donovan away. “Now get off. I have work to do."
Steve gave him a look, snorting. “Tell me what I want to know and I might consider letting you live,” he said, voice eerily calm and it made Justin swallow.
The office was silent, save for the ticking of the clock on the mantle. Steve sat quietly at his desk, forearms resting on the mahogany surface with his hands clasped tight together. His blue eyes were locked on the cellphone in the center of his desk. A bookshelf stretched along the wall opposite of the small bar, and at the foot of its shelving was a sprinkling of shattered glass and whiskey. He must have thrown his drink moments before, which made his eerie calm now all the more unsettling. When he finally spoke, his voice was hollow, gaze still locked on the phone. “What can I do for you, Ms. Stark?”
“Huh?” Toni blinked, before her eyes focused again on Bucky’s pained expression and she nodded jerkily to clear her head. “Two. Ty and Obadiah's guard.”
Justin huffed, but any retort died on his tongue when Clint gave one of his broken fingers a sharp tug. “I wont.”
Bucky glanced to Clint where the man sat in the passenger seat, glaring out of the window. “We’re going to find him, Clint." Bucky murmured, touching Clint’s shoulder.
It was certainly no greeting, and Steve appreciated it. He wasn’t in the mood for pleasantries. “I’m not hungry. I have too much work to do and too little of an appetite,” he refused.
Tony huffed, rubbing the back of his head and standing up. “I’ll be more than glad to stop talking to you,” Tony snapped, holding out a hand. “Now give me the bag so I can get the Hell away from you.”
Steve’s jaw clenched for a moment before he closed the front door behind Rhodey and nodded his chin towards the staircase. “Go on. Just… let me know before you go bringing any more people here. Just for safety precautions?”
“I just… someone with your family’s wealth and connection…” Bucky was struggling for a way to phrase what he wanted to say. “I guess I would expect you guys to be somewhere safe. A remote estate or some shit.” Unless her parents were dead, which would explain why she’s out wandering on her own. “The family you said was up north…?”
Bruce looked over the codes, shaking his head slowly. “Absolutely brilliant. I hope Steve and Clint keep you around. I could use another man of science in the group.”
The sky was marred with deep gray clouds now, thunder rumbling in the far distance. Bucky cursed their luck. They had been walking for almost an hour now, the little town proving to be farther than originally thought from their little barn. Or perhaps they were just slower than usual. Bucky’s eyes flicked to the side, where Toni was struggling to keep pace beside Steve. She was still sickly pale, a sheen of sweat on her skin despite the crisp fall air. Her good arm was wrapped gingerly around her broken one, as if to shield it from the harsh tugs of the storm’s breeze. She wasn’t going to make it much longer if they didn’t get her some form of medication soon; all this strain on her small body would make her much more susceptible to infection.
“Only for those who really need it. I was a sick boy growing up, and I wanted to help some of the low-income families around the city get what they need to survive,” Steve assured. “But, of course, I can’t make a steady living off of that. I have a few partnerships here and there with some of the lower gangs and organizations around, to make sure they get what they need to do what they need to do. I only work with those with the best intentions.”
Toni rolled her eyes, leaning forward to carefully apply the mascara to her lashes. “It’s a shame you’re not as charming as you were back then.”
“You will, if you keep him caged longer than necessary. I’ll tell you what I told Bucky: you not at fault for being forced to feel a certain way in a game that was designed against you. Obadiah had this planned for a long time. He wanted to see you angry and out of control and unable to save Bucky, and you shouldn’t feel guilty for playing into his plan a little bit. That was the very point of his plan. All you can do now is prepare for the future; build up your defenses to prevent this from happening again and coming up with a hell of a lot better response if it does. You’ll need Bucky’s help to do that, and it’ll definitely prevent him from going stir crazy while he’s actually in real recovery.”
"Clint," Steve barked, pushing him back. “I hate traitors just as much as you, but he still is Thor’s brother."
"Ah, yes, my weapon. It better be finished by tonight." Obadiah snarled, giving Tony’s hair another tug and pulling the boy to a large metal tub filled to the brink with water. "But that’s not why you’re here."
“Do you two know each other?” Ty asked, looking over his shoulder at the woman, a coy smile playing on his lips. “You’re usually not this rude until after your third drink.”
“Or, I may just meet some pretty amazing people who could turn out to be worth the trouble,” Steve murmured softly, before grinning. “Besides, I don’t steal from others and look, I haven’t broken my arm yet.”
“I invited him to stay for breakfast. We had spent most of the night in the study talking through some plans. It was so late I offered Steve here one of our guestrooms,” Howard offered, eyes not breaking from the paper in his hand.
Obadiah smiled and clapped Tony's shoulder, humming. "I took the liberty of bring you your lunch and your new assistant. I think you'll be quite pleased to see who it is." Obadiah snapped his fingers and suddenly, Justin came in, carrying a limp and unconscious Bucky in his arms.
“No, no, Steve. It felt fucking great to have the love of my life ditch me on my birthday for a woman he never even dated!” Tony snapped harshly, turning and slipping out of bed, standing.
Sunlight filtered through the large windows of his bedroom, lazily tinting his face with yellow warmth. Tony groaned loudly, pulling his pillow over his head to bury his face in the silk pillow case.”JARVIS, shades.”
Tony narrowed his eyes for a moment, studying Steve before a grin slowly spread across his face. “No way. You’re jealous, aren’t you?” Tony hissed, leaning forward.
No, of course the great Steve Rogers was too proud to thank her. Toni didn’t need gratitude for saving Bucky, but she also knew how unwilling Steve must be to give it. “I’m fine,” Toni looked down over her sundress, the blue fabric stained with dark splotches of red here and there. “That’s not my blood. It was from helping Bucky carry his weight.”
Tony gasped for air, lungs burning and throat soar as he tried to twist from Obadiah’s grip. “I-I told them you wanted my weapons!”
Toni shook her head, slipping into a pair of flats just as a knock came at the apartment door. Brow furrowed, Toni glanced to Ty but his attention was already split between the computer and the television. The brunette moved to the door and tugged it open. There stood Obadiah Stane, dressed in a pinstripe suit and golden tie, leaning against the door frame. His grey beard was neatly trimmed, framing his bright smile at the sight of the woman. Obadiah has served as her father second in command from the conception of both of his businesses, both legal and illegal. He showed her father new contacts, new products, and was there to help a fledgling business take the city by storm. But beyond business, Obadiah was a member of the family. He had helped them through the passing of Maria Stark, and even took the title as Toni’s godfather at Howard’s insistence. He was ruthless in business, exactly what Howard needed from his second, but he had always supported Toni’s wishes to be removed from the violent side of Stark Industries. Had encouraged it, really, and that was what Toni need from her godfather. “Obie!”
Tony shrugged lightly. “Everyone is. He watches over that side of the city." Tony said quietly, although his mind was flashing to the kiss they shared just the other night.
“I heard about your engagement,” Steve commented, taking a seat in the armchair across from them and crossing one leg over the other. “I believe congratulations are in order. When’s the wedding?”
“Yes it is. You care about her more than me,” Tony stood. “I just wished I had noticed sooner to spare myself the pain,” Tony padded over, flopping into his bed, not bothering to get under the covers as he burrowed his head into his pillow.
“Not too shabby. I think we’ll make the night,” Bucky joked, stopping before the pile of hay outside one of the stalls. “Here we go,” he declared, laying Toni down gently into the straw before he grabbed the tin bucket beneath the workbench. “Anything of use around here that we can take?”
Toni rolled her eyes, and shook her head. “The only person I need to count on is myself. Having a group would only slow me down.”
man. No more operating on the whims of lower organizations and whatever change they can spare for me.”
, the man who he had stood up the day before, the man he was about to accuse. He had been so sure the day before, so ready to tear into Stark at the prospect that the man might have taken his best friend. But Toni’s warning still echoed in his mind, and Natasha’s own reservations only served to hammer the doubt further into him. Should he wait? Wait until there was absolute, undoubtable proof that Howard was guilty?
“As if you aren’t going to have a few mimosas at lunch,” Ty shot back, pushing his laptop aside to stand and move for the kitchen. “But I can switch to beer if that makes you feel better.”
Natasha turned the car down the perpendicular street, and Steve realized only belatedly that she was taking him back towards his home. “We’ll find out what happened; we have people working around the clock to assure that. But
"Come on, big guy, lets go," Steve said, helping Thor standing but the moment Thor but weight on his wounded leg he fell to his knees again, hissing.
“Can you blame her? Not only did she have to call things off with her fiancé, but it was because he was spying on her under the instruction of her godfather. And torturing people on the side,” Natasha huffed. “But, whatever her friend is doing must be helping because she didn’t look pained to me. Exhausted, sure, but she was also calm, smiling a little.”
Toni’s jaw clenched at the harsh words, but she knew it was true. She as used as a pawn in this scheme; Ty’s presence was either to keep an eye on her, or keep her out of the way. “That doesn’t mean I shouldn’t come home with you and-“
Tony hummed in acknowledgement, biting his lip. “Well my A.I. isn’t finished yet, I still have to create a speech function and other little things. But right now, if I work it write, I can open the program on my laptop in the lab and get in contact with whoever is notices it."
Bucky sighed and lifted himself up to sit on a lab table, looking down and running his fingers over his cool, metallic hand; a habit that Tony had noticed him doing a lot lately. “Tony, you have to stay calm. I’m in tough and dangerous situations all the time and freaking over it will not help."
Steve sighed and rubbed his face, looking to Bucky. “Get Loki down into the basement." He ordered, looking around. Clint was still fussing over Bruce while Phil laid back on a examination table, rubbing his arm. What the hell was happening around them? Tony being kidnapped and bombs? “Everyone just get some rest. We’ll regroup tomorrow, alright? Phil, I want you to take some time off and just rest at home. Clint, make sure Bruce get’s to bed. If Thor comes home, you keep him as far away from the basement as you can."
Steve glanced up to the roof, spotting a glint of red hair in the moonlight. Not as good with a rifle as Bucky, but it’ll do. “From now on, I want to know your plans before we start them," Steve growled, voice leaving no room for argument as Clint nodded.
He was moving down the sidewalk towards his house with four bags of groceries when he was shoved into an alley by a large man. He stumbled and fell to the ground, groceries spilling out as the man pulled out a small handgun, aiming down at Tony. Honestly, what was it with people drawing guns on him this week? Did he have a sign on his back that said ‘Shoot me’?
“She saved Bucky,” Steve shrugged, avoiding Natasha’s eyes and pointedly taking a bite of his pizza.
They were met with silence that made Steve frown. “Where are they?" He asked as Bruce moved to the lab and peeked his head inside. “Not in here."
Tony grinned proudly. “I like to think so," he mumbled. He suddenly smacked the table. “Ha! Just swapped signals! All I have to do is launch the program on my computer," He smirked. He slowly tapped the enter key, grinning. “And we are live."
The woman turned to look at Bucky over her shoulder, offering a tired smile before she turned her attention back to the contents of the fridge. “Barnes. Want some cold pizza?”
Steve looked like he wanted to argue, but he also looked relieved to be able to stretch his arms out. “We can see if there are any residences around here.”
“My apologies, Anthony,” Thor said, letting Tony slid down his chest to the floor before stepping out of the way. “This is my brother, Loki.”
Steve sighed and nodded slowly, relaxing and rubbing his face. “I just got little sleep last night. Been worrying about that bomb and Tony…"
Ty moved his hand from her torso to tuck the tag of her t-shirt back beneath the collar. “Send Rhodes my regards, then.”
“I guess I do,” Toni huffed, trailing her fingers along the rim of the plate the cup was balanced on. “If it’s any consolation, he drives me just as insane.”
“Keep talking like that and you can be dog, since you’ll be in the doghouse,” Steve argued in return, though there was no heat to his voice.
Tony laughed, minimizing the codes and pulling up his designs. “That’s nothing, these are all my designs from buildings to computers to even things like weapons.”
If Steve was surprised that he was there, he didn't show it because the man simply tugged of his bullet proof vest and worked at untying his shoes. Tony moved over slowly,  arms crossed as he met Steve's eyes. "You'll have to talk sooner or later," Tony hummed, taking a seat on the edge of the bed beside Steve.
Hello everyone! Let me beginning by saying I sincerely did not think it would take me almost a year for this update. I mean honestly, what is wrong with me? Writer's block has been a little killer for my mob story, These Kingdoms We've Built, but I promise I'm trying. I just want to plan out my plot moving forward before I write the next chapter for it, because let's be real, it has a bit more involved and detailed plot than this story. That being said, I figured out a good portion of the plot for this story! So buckle up, because I have some THINGS in store!
Tony was finally packed, fitting his clothes and other possessions into two backpacks, carrying them down the stairs. He set them down at the door and moved into the living room, packing up his laptop quickly while Clint and Steve loaded there things into the car. Wrapping up the power cord, Tony looked around, confused. “Clint, where’s my flashdrive?” he called.
She had no incentive to save Bucky upon discovering him tied up in that wine cellar, and yet she risked taking on a trained guard and her own fiancé to free him. The spoiled brat that had been a pain in his side since their first encounter was not as black and white as Steve first thought. Perhaps he didn’t want to see any deeper character in her as much as she didn’t want to see one in Steve. Humanizing an enemy makes them harder to hit, of course. But the young woman, who he had been so convinced was nothing more than a selfish, antagonizing child, was brave. She was willing to make a sacrifice for someone she hardly knew, despite all the shit Steve had piled on her over the course of Bucky’s disappearance.
“Alright,” Toni agreed, and when she saw he clearly wasn’t leaving the office anytime soon, she added in a “goodnight” before closing the door behind her. The elated smile that adorned her face melted away as quickly as her press smile does, and she was left with nothing but half-baked thoughts like puzzle pieces unable to fit together. Something was going on here and she was going to find out what, whether she liked it or not. But Ty was right about one thing: she needed sleep. Hopefully, her plan and ideas will be better formulated after a few hours of rest.
Steve hummed, sipping his mug of coffee as his eyes scanned over the paper. “There’s a plate of pancakes. Help yourself,” he hummed nonchalantly.
A smug grin passed over Steve’s lips as Bucky sputtered, only grinning wider when he earned himself a sharp kick from Tony under the table. “You two are unbelievable,” Tony muttered, but gladly accepted an apologetic peck on the lips from Steve. “Luckily, I can live with that.”
Steve rounded the corner and stepped into the library, smoothing out his jacket as he examined the couple before him. Ty stood before the bookcase, skimming over the titles of Steve’s private collection. “Honestly, does he only read art books and war biographies? How boring,” Ty sniffed, glancing over his shoulder at where a slender brunette was settled on the couch.
Toni shifted, drifting around the blonde and nodding once towards the door. “Come on, Banner, I’ll walk you out. I would love to ask you a few questions about your work along the way.”
Bucky nodded slowly, finally tearing his eyes off of her to look at the jam jar in his hand. By the soft sigh she released, he assumed that she appreciated the move. So she had a chance to stay with her family, but shitty circumstances ruined it. She still wanted to head north, which must mean some part of her believes her father is alive and well. So if it wasn’t her experience on the airfield that made her so cold and defensive towards others… what else had happened to her since the outbreak?
Steve stiffened, turning around and, sure enough, Howard Stark was making his way towards their table with his daughter and future son-in-law in tow. She work a simple cocktail dress, navy blue and off the shoulders. The sleeves wrapped tight around her arm until just below the elbow, where they tapered out into a bell shape that ended at her wrists. The dress’ hem stopped just below her knee, with a long slit traveling up the length of one thigh. Her shoes were black, the heel as sharp as the point her toes were forced into. Her dark curls were forced back into a sleek ponytail, tight to her scalp but spilling down her back in wild waves. She blended with the dim atmosphere, taking the dark motif and running wild with it. Her blue eyes found Steve just as easily and, because Toni was a stubborn thing, didn’t look away despite the tension in the air.
Toni’s demeanor changed the slightest bit; Steve himself would have missed it if it wasn’t for the way her grip tightened on his shoulder. The warmth had disappeared from her expression, her blue gaze hardening as she met Steve’s eyes. Her smile was driven by insincere politeness, pearly white teeth bared as if she was threatening to tear the blonde apart. She stepped forward, now flush against Steve as she cocked her head up to press her ruby lips to his ear. “If there is one thing I hate, Mr. Rogers, it’s when people think I’m dumb enough to be manipulated.”
The structure was large, tucked in what must be the back corner of the old cornfield. Its exterior had been badly weathered, the once bright blue paint that had decorated its walls now chipped and stained. Steve stepped before the door, carefully unlatching it. After a moment of struggle, Steve was able to push the door open with a squeal of rusted hinges. The blonde gave Bucky a brief look, before raising his shotgun and stepping into the building. Sunlight streamed through the holes in the eroding tin roof, giving enough light to illuminate their path. There was four horse stalls, two on each side face each other. A workbench occupied one corner to their left, while a hose and other various equipment took the space to their right. Steve moved ahead and peaked into each stall, before he finally lowered his shotgun and placed it on the workbench. “It’s empty. Nothing in here,” he assured, moving back to close and bolt the door.
Tony narrowed his eyes and flipped Steve off, ignoring Steve’s snicker as the blonde shut the door. He turned to his bags, tossing them into the corner before flopping into the soft sheets and curling up. This was all happening way too fast.
A door opened and there was an audible click. Suddenly, muffled light filtered through the fibers of the bag on his head. A floorboard creaked as multiple feet descended the stairs (Bucky was leaning more towards basement than warehouse, now). The conversation was growing less and less inaudible, and Bucky was able to make out two distinct voices despite the three sets of footsteps milling around the room. Two stopped directly in front of him, and Bucky was aware of eyes running over him even with his lack of vision.
“Tony, I swear it isn’t like that!” Steve’s cries were heard, but Tony ignored them as he curled into a ball, tears falling thicker as he closed his eyes.
“Because I heard them talking while I was tied up. They seemed pretty hopeful that my disappearance would cause a war between Steve and Howard. If your father had anything to do with this, I doubt he’d want some fight with Steve as the outcome. He wouldn’t hurt his business and he wouldn’t hurt the man he spent so long trying to groom,” Bucky assured softly.
“It’s been two years since the outbreak. Does she really…” Steve paused. “She just… doesn’t seem like the hopeful type.”
Steve nodded, stepping away from the windows and over to lean against the counter beside his husband. Water bottles, three cans of chili, a bottle of ibuprofen- “You really hit the jackpot there,” Steve commented, tugging gently on the hem of Bucky’s shirt. “You should take that off and let it dry. Temperature’s going to be dropping soon and the last thing we need is one of us getting sick.”
"Good. Now where is his base?" Steve hummed, slowly circling around Hammer and waiting for an answer, but the second in command was already passing out from the pain.
Clint stood against the stone wall that surrounded Stane’s estate, checking over himself to make sure he was ready. One knife strapped to each calf, while two pistols remained concealed at his hips. A grenade was settled into the front pocket of his bulletproof vest while his bow remained carefully strapped to his shoulder, four arrows awaiting use.
Bucky nodded once, jaw set in determination. Toni opened the cellar door slowly, pushing Bucky up the last two steps before she joined him in the hallway. Turning, she made sure Raza was still unconscious on the floor before she closed the door and locked it. There was the sounds of movement coming from the sitting room, footsteps and the clinking of a drinking glass as it was set down on the bar. Toni’s arm wrapped around Bucky’s waist, putting herself between him and Ty’s inevitable line of sight from the door opening. Bucky’s hand curled around her shoulder, and Toni was sure it was more of a sign of support rather than the need of assistance. They took it one step at a time, careful to keep their feet on the plush rug that lined the hallway to keep silent. The closer they approached Ty’s whereabouts, the harder Toni’s heart thudded in her chest. White hot anger coursed through her at the thought of what he’s done, but now wasn’t the time to confront him. Bucky was the priority, Bucky who looked like he was trying very hard to hide his labored breathing.
“Because I know nothing is going to come from me running out into the thick of it, guns blazing with no plan,” Toni hissed, tone taking on a conspiring note. “We’re talking about two men who have spent years executing their plans. Do you think they would let us retaliate so easy, or at the very least not have a backup plan to deal with us?”
Phone call, then. Toni bent over the sink to spit out the minty toothpaste, rinsing out her mouth with a glass of water before she opened the bathroom door and entered the bedroom. “Who was that?”
“And if Howard doesn’t like hearing you doubt him? Didn’t his daughter warn you against that?” Natasha asked, raising a brow as Steve moved past her. “We agreed to wait until it’s been forty-eight hours. Is this our best choice?”
"Okay, maybe it’s exactly what it looks like, sir, but it wont happen again," Tony whispered, shifting under the cool gaze.
Tony took a slow step forward before diving into his arms, closing his eyes and burying his face in Steve’s shoulder as the soldier wrapped his arms securely around Tony. “You’re still not forgiven,” Tony mumbled softly, curling his fingers in Steve’s shirt. “You’re on probation.”
Bucky helped Toni sit up gingerly, bringing the tablet to her lips and grabbing the water bottle, tipping it up so that Toni could wash down the medication. Steve frowned, taking the bottle back and shoving it in their bag. “I don’t know, Buck. Morphine?”
“The Captain said to tell you that if he finds one more of your men on his turf, he’s ending all trades and coming for you.” The mugger said quietly.
An hour later, a car was parking across the street from the house. Inside sat two men, one with short, buzzed blonde hair and the other with his long black hair pulled back into a ponytail. They both glanced to each other, nodding as they slid out of the car and check their ammo before moving up the steps of the house and kicking open the front door.
Steve sighed, glancing up to the ceiling in exasperation before looking over at Tony. "This is what happens when you get involved with the mob," He mumbled. "I want you to move out with Clint tomorrow. Start a fresh life somewhere far away from us."
Tony sighed in exasperation, fingers flying over the computer with lightning speed as he began to open programs and examine hundreds of letters and numbers that Bucky classified as gibberish. “I’ve been working on an artificial intelligence unit for the past few months," Tony mumbled, speaking quickly. “If I can just hack through Obadiah’s internet monitors, swap unto a different signal, I can activate the unit."
Apart from Barnes, Toni didn’t remember ever meeting any other of Steve’s crew. She supposed that was purposeful. “Toni Stark,” she finally supplied, taking the cup into her hands carefully.
A short introductory chapter to get us started. Tell me what you guys think! The current plan is that I will update every Thursday, though I'm sure that will change depending on my summer schedule. But I'll be sure to give a heads up!
Steve nodded once, before his eyes leveled on Toni. There was something strange about his expression, and Toni realized it was missing its usual notes of exasperation and contempt. Dare she even suspect some form of gratitude was coming? But Steve merely nodded towards the tea, stepping further into the room and taking a seat in the armchair across from her. “Were you injured?”
Steve’s fingers tightened on the doorknob before he huffed and closed the lab door, following slowly. Yeah, he was really hating that feeling in his gut.
“You say that, but you don’t mean it. Nobody does something to be nice, they do it so that they can get something in return,” Toni argued, voice thin and wispy as she shook her head. “It’s a nice thought, though, people helping others for the hell of it. So my question, Steve, is what do you want from me?”
Howard nodded his approval. “They you’ll need to expand your skill set. I do a lot in this city, and diversifying my investments and planning my moves has made a world of change. Some of my best projects took years to achieve, between buying up land and manipulating the housing market. Importing and pushing products is only part of the game, and it’s a part that any lackey can play. What you want requires the strategy of a calculated businessman.”
She didn’t respond, and Bucky looked over to find her nodding her head in agreement. She looked tired and pained, looked so young. Bucky remembered what it was like living on the streets in Brooklyn, doing whatever it took to care for him and Steve. At least he had Steve, this girl had been so fucked up she believed being alone was better than having anyone around. Bucky groaned, reaching over into his backpack and fishing out a water bottle. “Alright, kid, look at me,” he directed, cupping her chin and forcing her to look at him.
Tony rolled his eyes with a laugh, standing and bringing his plate to the sink. Clint gave Bucky a huff before turning to Tony. “Im serious, you should go meet Bruce. I think you two would really hit it off. Show him some of your computer programs.”
Ty stepped out of the closet, and Toni looked over her shoulder expecting to meet his gaze, but he was examining himself in the full-body mirror on the back of the closet door. “My father. You know how he’s been with the retirement. I was letting him know we were going to be out for the night. How was your afternoon meeting?”
Steve’s expression was grim, but he nodded. “Schmidt.” No words were needed to describe Steve’s discomfort at the mention. “And we’re…we’re going to help her, right?”
"Are you ever going to tell me who these sources are?" Steve huffed, sparing a look to Clint before continuing to survey the crowd.
“Steve, taking that cloth on her head and gag her,” Bucky instructed, meeting Steve’s eyes. “She’ll either scream or bite her tongue off and I’d rather not deal with the consequences of either. Gag her.”
Clint sighed, stepping into the room. “Forget about it. You probably just misplaced it. I told you, we aren’t leaving forever. You can go a few weeks without it, now come on.”
Tony huffed and turned his head away, standing and moving up the stairs to his room. He found Steve there, studying the shattered glass and the broken window. “Get out of my room,” Tony huffed, grabbing his backpack and beginning the shove clothes into it.
“You’re not talking and that worries me. You’re normally halfway through a conversation before I even properly say hello,” Rhodey started as he closed the bedroom door, setting the bag beside the dresser. “Tones?”
“Yes,” Bruce huffed, smiling politely before turning back to Bucky’s wound. “We’ve… well, we’ve actually met before. The Maria Stark Foundation hosted a fundraiser for a children’s cancer research project I began. It was brief, just a handshake and-“
It wasn’t until one guard dropped to the ground, blood splattered across the pavement, that Justin tensed, glancing around. Steve silently thanked that Natasha had the sense to use a suppressor on the rifle. He’d hate to alert the whole community of their activities. In the blink of an eye, the second guard stumbling back as a bullet pierced between his eyes.
"Five thousand dollars." Steve huffed as he finished counting, eyes flashing to Loki as he pulled out a box of matches, lighting one and setting fire to the money. “He’s worth millions," Steve snarled, face illuminated in the fire’s glow as he tossed the burning money into the trashcan.
“What?” Toni seethed, turning on her father and clenching her fists. “I should be helping you. I should be home helping you regain order. Not…not
By the time Toni glanced back at the blonde, he had already regained some of his composure. “You don’t have an appointment, Ms. Stark,” Steve hissed through gritted teeth.
Her voice lacked any real emotion other than calm indifference, and Bucky wondered how a young woman with a good head on her shoulders fell into a lackluster relationship like the one she’s in. “You should give Steve a chance. I know he got off on the wrong foot with you- and I’m partially to blame for that. I was the one who put the idea in his head to use you,” Bucky began and Toni flared defensively, but he continued before she could get too upset. “And I’m sorry about that. You’re a hell of a lot smarter than just a pawn, and Steve knows that. He’s an idiot, but he’s a great businessman and an even greater friend. You two actually have a lot in common, as scary as that is.” The song came to an end and Bucky stepped back, winking at the woman. “Give it a thought, Ms. Stark. Now, if you don’t mind, I have a few things to attend to behind the scenes here. If Steve asks, tell him I’m catching up with a few of our investors.”
She was deliberately avoiding giving a last name, but Bucky didn’t need her to. He didn’t live under a rock; he had seen enough billboards and magazine covers to know who the big name in the weapons industry was. And if that wasn’t enough, Bucky would never forget the name that adorned all of the weaponry they were provided with during his deployment. The name on the side of his own favorited rifle.
need to focus on running your business. You have to let investors and partners know that this hasn’t slowed you down and that you’re still in the game. Bucky’s captors need to see you carrying on. Your own men need to know that you’re going to be alright.”
A clearing throat broke Toni out of her reveries, and she realized she had been staring at a display rack of sunglasses for the past five minutes. She looked over her shoulder, where the blonde one was settled on the floor before the only entrance to the store. His back was against the counter, fingers toying with the coil binding of his sketchbook- a fresh one he had happily found in the back of the general store. His boot was pressed against the unpowered ice cream machine they had pushed in front the door, as if he needed the peace of mind that the barricade was there. His blue eyes were trained on her, brow raised in amusement as he nodded to the glasses she held delicately in her hand. “I don’t think those are your style,” he teased, smile light and carefree.
Something like relief crashed into Steve, the air forcibly escaping the blonde’s lungs as he stood from his chair. “Buck? Is that really you?”
expect was to see the dark purple mark peeking out from the hemline of his little brother’s collar. Tony sat to the right of Bruce, back to Clint as he ate his bowl of cereal and chatted animatedly with Bucky about the idea of upgrading his arm. Now who the hell gave his brother a hickey?
Bucky snorted. “I haven’t taken anything since Bruce first patched me up two nights ago. He left me a few meds to help manage the pain, but I haven’t taken them today. I only really wanted them for if I went on patrol tonight, but that obviously isn’t happening.”
“He’s right,” Steve said firmly, nodding his head and holding a hand out to Toni. “Come on, I’ll carry you. You’re still in no condition to walk.”
He wasn’t looking at her, but Toni hoped he felt her glare. “I rejected the senseless killing that you and my father and everyone else seem to endorse. I didn’t want to lead a business that built itself on the blood of others. But that doesn’t mean I don’t try to help with the less cruel aspects of the job.”
His soft snoring followed her into the kitchen, and Toni envied his ability to sleep so deeply. Craved it.
Bruce frowned, taking a slow breath. “Now that he set them all off, what will he use to motivate Tony?"
Steve nodded, folding his hands in his lap. “We do. And we should all start preparing for the backlash of foiling their plans.” He was quiet for a moment, before his eyes truly met Toni’s for the first time. “Ms. Stark, I-“
"Hey Stark," Donovan called as he sauntered into the room, leer almost involuntary as he moved towards the lab table Tony was working at. Bucky was beside Tony almost immediately, playing bodyguard as he crossed his arms threateningly. "The boss wants to see you," Donovan supplied, throwing a harsh glance in Bucky’s direction. "
Bruce cleared his throat, packing up his things and keeping his eyes on his bag as he spoke. “Unfortunately, it would be better if you rested for longer than a day. You could risk pulling your stitches at the very minimum, Bucky. Two weeks, if anything, would be best.”
Loki snorted, licking over his lower lip and glaring up to Clint. “He is not my boss. He is simply a client who needed my expertise."
Toni glanced up, meeting the eyes of a redheaded woman. The woman was lithe, dressed only in black, which made her short red curls burn even brighter. Her expression was calm, even a little soothing, but her eyes were locked on the anxious bobbing of Toni’s right leg. Toni, suddenly aware of herself, ceased the movement. “Thank you,” she finally accepted, watching the woman place a tray on the coffee table before Toni and pour a fresh cup. “I don’t believe we’ve met.”
But Bucky was still missing, and every minute he stayed missing was another minute he could be dead. Howard may be his sole suspect, but he may also be his only support outside of his own crew. If Steve wanted any form of lead on Bucky’s whereabouts or captors, he would need to appeal to both. He would have to press Howard enough that, if he was guilty, he would either own up to his wrongdoing or slip in his cover-up. But Steve would also need to leave the conversation light enough that, if innocent, Howard would understand that Steve was just lost without his best friend and offer to help. It was a fine line to walk, but Steve couldn’t spend any more time fearing it. Bucky’s life was on the line and the longer Steve spent debating Stark’s involvement, the longer Bucky was in danger. It was time to start acting, and Howard was his first and only lead.
"Now I think there’s more to it than that, Anthony," The boss hit a button on the keyboard and now Tony was shown a picture of different rooms in the Estate, including the kitchen, gym, lab and living room. “Two days ago, while you all where enjoying your movie night, Loki planted bombs in each of these rooms." Tony stiffened immediately and the boss grinned. “I believe you just admitted to having a connection with Rogers. Now I think you know what I’m suggesting here, Anthony."
Steve’s gaze was fierce as he squeezed her hand again and brought it to his chest. “Just want you to survive. Just want you to let me and Bucky care for you. We don’t leave anyone behind, not like this.”
“No, he’s not,” Clint pipped up from where he was cooking over the stove, smirking and reaching back briefly to ruffle Tony’s hair.
Her tired eyes slowly found Steve’s, but she offered no snarky comment or insult. Somehow, that was more concerning. Instead, she just shook her head slowly and turned her gaze up towards the ceiling. Steve squeezed her hand, before turning to Bucky. “There are two rooms across the hall. Try them and see if they have a supply closet or something. Just stay out of the room beside us.”
Still, he had to admire her strength- or, more accurately, her stubbornness. Each step she took with those worn boots was a deliberate stomp, like she had to summon the mental encouragement with each swing of her foot. She made it much farther than he thought she would, and each time Steve extended a gentle hand to help her over or around something, she jerked away and stubbornly did it herself. Headstrong girl.
Steve wanted to protest, say he would go to save his best friend and…whatever Tony was to him, but he knew in the end that he couldn’t be selfish. He had to do what was necessary in rescuing Tony
The arm looked perfect, although it was cheap in comparison to the one Bucky lost, but Tony felt a bit better knowing that Bucky could at least have two arms again. He'd get Bucky to test it out when he woke; which, to be honest, a nap didn't sound so bad. Resting his head on the table, Tony slowly drifted off, humming softly.
Clint crossed his arms in frustration and leaned back against the counter, eying the room. Who could have given Tony a hickey? His face went blank as Steve entered the room, smiling brightly to his team as he moved towards the coffeepot. Clint didn’t miss the way Steve’s hand subtly brushed Tony’s collar up over the dark mark. And Clint definitely didn’t miss the way Tony’s cheeks accented with the faintest colors of red.
Toni digested the story for a moment, before she hummed and finished off her drink. “He thought he lost
Howard raised a hand to stop her, eyes hard. “Antonia, you will be a target in this. You’re my sole family and Obadiah will not hesitate to use you. He already has; do you think Tiberius being a part of this conspiracy was coincidence? He was planted in your life to keep an eye on you. That is how we must treat it.”
Obadiah grinned, nodding as he clasped his hands behind his back. “Spectacular, isn’t it?" Obadiah smirked, slowly passing a second card to Tony. “That is your key to the lab. I expect you to be constantly working, Mr. Stark. Now, I’m a gracious enough host that I will allow you to join me at meals and sleep when you need it. However, if I feel that you’re progress is being stunted or you’re holding back on me, well, we can fix that," Obadiah grinned, nodding towards a large flat screen hanging on the far wall that showed a video feed from all four common rooms in the Estate.
