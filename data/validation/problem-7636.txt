'Mr... Stark...' He started, but whatever else he was trying to say was lost in the panting. Steve sat him upright again, reaching with his other hand to open the valves on the oxygen tank. There was the nasal tubes Peter had to insert to keep him breathing through the night, or there was a mask for crisis. Steve took the mask, and although Peter swatted irritatedly at him, held it over his face.
Only Peter wasn't helpless. He was really smart, and, thanks to Mr Stark, now he had awesome powers. Okay, so he hadn't really had time to try them out yet, but he could definitely climb walls and move really fast. That had to be helpful, right?
That first appointment was very brief, and very unlike the mental examinations he had had to do in preparation for the serum. He was not made to lie down on a couch and stare at a wallpapered ceiling. Nobody asked him who the president was (which was a good thing as he had no idea). There were no intelligence tests, no ink blots, no intrusive questions about what he thought about his mother, his father, sex; none of the things, in short, that had made Steve so reluctant to go in the first place. In fact, that first appointment lasted less than two minutes and consisted only of three questions:
'Hey, I can tutor you,' Clint grinned. 'Even my Ds are better than your Fs.'
'Right,' Tony said. 'Right.'
Steve ignored him. 'The orange represents the world,' he said. 'The red ribbon round the middle represents the blood of Christ, spilt for everyone.'
'I'm pretty sure they got it all, J- ow!' One of the robots that usually cleaned the place had crept up beside him and pricked his arm with a needle, in a way that Tony felt was unnecessarily hard.
This was crazy. They'd just met, they knew nothing about each other, Steve was
But it
Peter nodded again. Steve shifted awkwardly. This part never got any easier.
'So you found it,' Howard said, throwing the book back into his safe, the gold embossed
'Go see where he is,' Howard eventually snapped at Ms Potts, who had been waiting unobtrusively by the door. She nodded and went out into the hall, and Steve heard her climbing the stairs. If Steve was asked to guess, they had probably collected a hungover Barnaby earlier, and he had collapsed back into bed on reaching the mansion. Steve was trying to keep an open mind about that – everyone he knew got drunk sometimes – but something about Tony drinking alone in the dark of his apartment, about his dad saying there was a family history of alcoholism... Steve wasn't so blinded by love that he didn't see there might be a problem. It hurt him, to see Tony in so much pain. But they would work on it, they would handle it together. He was sure they could.
Peter turned the phone over and over in his hands, reluctant.
Tony laughed. ‘I know, I know. Take it down a notch, beautiful, or I might start suspecting you really were doing something
'No,' she said, but then smirked at him. 'I suppose I'm just a romantic.'
Tony nodded, and they went back to the lounge. Once he was sitting back on the couch – and
'It'll work,' he'd said, 'You just have to trust me.' For once, he hadn't even sounded convinced himself.
'Are you two ever going to stop being gross?' Bucky demanded, finally catching up and clapping a congratulatory hand on Steve's back.
Steve groaned.
(‘But, you know what they say – love finds a way. In this case, a courier with his arms full of flowers.’)
'Is it?'
'No,' Steve said, matter-of-factly. 'You won't do it again. I'll persuade you not to.' And he actually, seriously, honestly,
The thing that he was lying on was the hospital floor, and the thing that had crashed into him like a freight train to put him there was Steve, just a little too late. Apparently Tony had wildly underestimated either how much sedative was needed, or how much difference Steve's instincts to protect Peter would make. Either way, he was now being dragged to his feet and lifted, slammed into the wall, pinned by the neck. Dots swam on the edges of his vision.
'Over my dead body,' he had said. Steve had been lying on the table by then and a few pints shy of bleeding to death, but he remembered feeling strangely focused by the pain. It was like all his life up until then he had been looking at Tony's reflection in a dented mirror, and now he was finally seeing him face to face. He'd been unable to tear his eyes away, wondering if this would be the last time he would see him.
'Of course I do.'
,’ He said, before the door had even shut behind him. ‘Lilies are
'It would've been a lot to cancel. You got albino peacocks to wander the grounds.'
, or introduce some safety measures. His lab floor was now covered in sprayed yellow lines marking a safe distance away from anything electrical, hot, sparky or explosive, and he'd invested in some child-size googles and protective clothing.
Tony kept right on staring, then set the bowl carefully back down again. He covered his face. For a moment, Steve thought he was crying. Then he realised Tony was laughing. Maybe a bit of both.
Neither Stark nor the Captain looked reassured. In fact they looked almost alarmed.
'No, idiot,' Tony said, giving him a good natured shove before heading down towards the carriage. 'We're having a ride. Well, I am, you're learning to drive.'
'Barnes men don't fire blanks.'
'What? No, Pete, no, that's not, it's, it isn't, what-'
Tony snorted. It had been 'one last time' for at least the last fifteen minutes. Steve shot him a look. Tony waved him off in a
'Hey there,' he smirked, strolling over. Steve gripped the handles of the pushchair tighter, and turned Peter to face away from them.
. That explains a lot.'
'So,' Steve said. 'Are you always like this when you come out of the lab?'
'Well, the forties sucked,' Tony said. 'Maybe he really was just trying to protect you. But it was still a crappy thing to do.' He wondered if it would be appropriate to put his arms round Steve, to give him what seemed like it would be a much needed hug. But then, given what he needed to say next, it probably wouldn't be. '...Steve, is that what you've lived your life by ever since? Because you know being bi is fine now. You aren't going to get arrested for fooling around in a closet.'
Steve looked at him, suspicious. He was looking distinctly scruffy, and it had tipped past the point of being sexily dishevelled and into the point of just being, well, scruffy. His hair was tousled and unwashed, and his clothes had pretty much gone past the point of no return in terms of creases. He was pale, with dark circles under his eyes. He looked like he needed some taking care of.
Yinsen told him never to look inside the closet.
'Well, the Wish Foundation told him it couldn't be done, and so did I, but... he was so upset. He said he wasn't, but he was. He's never asked me for anything, seriously, never asked me for so much as a candy bar, and, well, I just had to try myself. We wouldn't take much of your time, or, or tell anyone where you were, I just know it would make him so happy if you could-'
Howard snorted. 'Of course not,' he said, as though it was the most obvious thing in the world. 'I'm not paying out twenty-five grand because someone raised a whore instead of a son.'
'It's just pea royale, sweetheart. Just peas and vegetables and a truffle. You can eat it.'
'Except you thought it was for a woman.'
When Steve woke up on Peter's fourth birthday, he lay in bed and wondered if this had been a good idea. He wondered whether Stark would even show up. Then he wondered if he wanted him to or not. On the one hand, Stark was definitely a very bad influence. On the other, frankly, Peter's life expectancy wasn't really long enough for bad influences to be a problem.
'Rude. I was just saying hello.'
and then got down on one knee to propose. I knew it couldn't be you, not the day after a fight with the Skrulls. You're way too stubborn to change opinion that fast.'
Sometimes someone came in to check on him, to bring him water he didn't drink or food he didn't eat. Rhodes came in and they talked, and Rhodey said he should let himself cry but no, there was no need to cry yet, not yet, not when it wasn't real yet. So he promised Rhodey he would get up soon, didn't mean it, and eventually Rhodey had to leave.
'Well,' Bucky said eventually. 'At least you're fully vaccinated with good teeth?'
'Ssh, now, Stark, ssh.' Thor's voice came more urgently. 'I know, but not here. Come away, come now.'
The judge paused for breath. Tony gripped the wooden rail of the dock, suddenly completely unsure what to expect.
Steve knew that voice. He knew that
, Tony thought bitterly. If he'd had the man's number, he could have got him to bring it down instead of having to cancel his order – his heart breaking – and leave the beautifully cool interior of the shop for the baking heat of the world outside.
'It's nothing to do with you, Ty!' Barnaby was shouting. 'Let him go!'
'And what do you think my dad is going to do to me?!' Tony demanded. 'They're expelling me! Caltech won't take me! You have to tell them!'
'Okay, I have an idea to help Mr Stark,' Peter said. 'Can you play some music?'
. Like mine.'
Right. Right, Steve wouldn't cheat. Although, if he did, he would be the sort who would respect Tony enough to do it in the spare, not in their bed. He'd also be the kind to hide his fling's possessions away so that he could find a way to return them. Assuming it was a fling and not a relationship. Goodness knew Tony was away enough. But Steve wouldn't, he wouldn't. Tony just wished he could convince his rolling guts of that.
'Well?' Bucky demanded. 'Is he an asshole? A serial killer?'
Tony sipped his wine. Ha. He had known a smile that perfect couldn't be natural. He still loved it though.
'Stark! Where to?'
‘Captain. Steve. We know you had dinner with him.’
Tony considered. 'Maybe, when they need the kidnapee to understand why their mostly-illegal experiments actually worked.'
By the end of the day, nestled in amongst the tasteful colours and leaves of the garlands were six garish oranges; Natasha's and Bruce's minimalist but balanced, Steve's somehow nostalgic, Thor's and Clint's weighed down with as many sweets as humanly possible, and Tony's, looking like he had gotten distracted half way through and finished it in a hurry, which was exactly what had happened as he'd argued and laughed with the others. The kitchen table was sticky with juice, and the bots were just starting to clear up the dropped candy and cocktail sticks that littered the floor. The whole thing was a mess, and tacky, and totally ruined his theme and yet – and yet. Tony had to admit, there was something in the way they looked when the candles were lit, all of them there together, the reflection of the flames glittering in the dark glass of the window and matching the delighted look in Steve's eyes.
Steve jumped, realising with a start that the two horses had indeed become very interested in the hand that held the bag. He shot a questioning look at the driver, who nodded.
Steve laughed to at that, just slightly. Steve wasn't the laugh out loud type, he usually just smiled and got bashful and ducked his head when he was amused. His laughter was all in his eyes, or so she had thought. She could feel it now, moving his chest, even though nothing came from his lips.
'Girl asked me to dance,' he said, putting the promised Appletiser down in front of Steve. 'You don't mind, do you?'
(Possibly
Steve nodded again. It was not the first time they'd had a conversation like this, and he always had the same question.
Tony blinked at it, then rounded furiously on Spiderman, who had hopped down to ground level to join them. 'I thought you said it was a
He'd decided, recently, that it was maybe okay to call Steve his dad after all as long as it was only in his head. He knew Steve didn't like it when people called him that, so Peter never said it out loud, and he had even tried not to think it, but then Mr Stark always called Steve his dad, and he wouldn't do that if it wasn't at least a bit okay.
'I'm sorry,' Steve said, but the apology only seemed to upset Tony more.
Possibly they were trying to scare him into obedience, but if that was the goal it had the exact opposite effect. For months, ever since they had taken him, Tony had been numb; any emotions he felt walled away somewhere inside where they couldn't overwhelm him. But now they had breached the dam and rage like a flood was crashing over him.
In the end, the charge was seventy-two counts of causing grievous injury and eleven counts manslaughter; because while the court accepted that the murders had been greatly influenced by the symbiote Venom, there was insufficient scientific proof to completely absolve Tony of any responsibility. It was pretty much what Tony had expected, but when they met in the briefing room to wait for the sentence to be decided, Steve couldn't hold still.
Of course, Steve wasn't stupid. He knew people were complex, often contradictory, and people as clever as Stark probably even more so. But still, there was something. He kept thinking of the brief flicker he had seen in Stark's eyes in the bar, and the way his flight suit had rippled and clawed up his neck and over his hands like tentacles. It had almost seemed alive.
‘Here,’ Tony said, selecting a few flowers. ‘How many do you need? Three? Four?’
'Unacceptable,' Tony grumbled, resting his head against Steve's chest. Steve put his arms around him, dropping a kiss into his hair before releasing him and heading back to his own chair. 'I'm going to invent a fully automated mechanical body. We're going to live forever.'
(Bucky had noticed too, recently, and never mentioned it anymore.)
'Maybe not,' Steve said, tearing his eyes away from where Peter was now bending and swaying on the bed. 'Stark. Thanks for this.'
Tony nodded. 'Completely.'
'Yeah, well, he won't be a billionaire by the time I'm done with him.' Steve hauled himself to his feet. His leg protested, but he decided to let it. If he let a little pain stop him, he'd never do anything.
'Oh.' Howard Stark appraised him again, the edge of a smile tugging at his lips in a way that seemed oddly familiar. 'Well, aren't you a stubborn son of a bitch? That's good. You'll need that if you're going to handle Tony. You want to marry my son, Steve?'
'I found a programme for the gala in my dad's stuff and the song was listed,' he explained. 'Then I've had the poor little interns up all night checking all his records and recordings for any fragments. They finally found it half taped over on the b-side of a Feynman lecture.'
'You know why he's never seen with men, Steve? Let me tell you about the absurd levels of petty-mindedness Tony Stark can achieve. He did have a boyfriend once, as a teenager, and his dad found out, and was
And that was a bridge too far. Steve punched him, hard as he could, right in the nose. The surprise made Ty let go of him, but as usual Steve's punch had done more damage to his hand than to Ty's face, and Ty shoved him away with both hands. Steve's knees gave way as he fell and he twisted awkwardly, winding himself on landing, just in time for Ty's foot to stamp down on his face. There went his nose. Steve held up his hands, trying to shield himself from a second blow; but of course Bucky had appeared by then and was hauling Ty away, quickly followed by two of the bouncers and The Diva herself. Steve sat up.
'And what's going on here?' Meredith had entered the room. Osborn dropped the papers back down on the desk.
'A real one,' Steve added. 'It has to be a real tree and a real wreath, otherwise it doesn't count.'
'Thank you, James. And thank your mother.'
'Enough quips, ape. Though it does not yet function as we desire, this machine does already have a very useful function. It can inflict a most unusual and unpleasant torture. But perhaps I shouldn't spoil it for you.'
Steve rounded on him, eyes full of horror. 'Where did you get that?'
Peggy replied right away, Steve was sure of it, but he couldn't see it. Every time he tried, he found himself blinking, vision blurring, going black. His stomach was screwing itself up into a ball again. He tried to ignore it, tried to go back to the screen, but the effort of it made his whole body lurch like he was walking the deck of a sinking ship. He didn't even make it to the bin in the corner of his room before he threw up.
She wanted to ask why Steve hadn't come himself, but couldn't. Except Rhodes, who knew her so well, told her anyway. Steve had been worried about her. Steve had noticed she was embarrassed yesterday. Steve had thought, if he was there, she might be too worried to get the help she needed. Steve knew they were close, and thought maybe she would be more comfortable with him.
They were sitting in a corridor at the hospital, waiting, looking at the children's art work that had been put up to try and make the place seem jollier and more friendly. Maybe on a different day it would have worked, but not just then. Tony was pretty sure his companion hadn't even noticed it. The Captain was staring at the floor, looking distant. Peter had been whisked away behind closed doors as soon as they had arrived, the doctors saying they would 'see what they could do'. Nobody had told them anything.
'Yeah, well, let's not find out okay? Now, where are we going?'
'Peter! Peter, it's too dangerous, hold still!'
He thought this morning might be almost as bad.
Not the red head then. Tony frowned, trying to think of any other girls in the group, let alone any other brunettes. Peggy was the only brunette in that group. Was she – could she be - ? He turned to her with eyes full of panic, but before he could say anything she gently added, 'His name is Bucky.'
'Well, have a good day at the office, beloved,' he said. 'Remember, stay safe. And, um, keep an open mind.'
At the same time, he was burying his face in the pillow, trying to block out the flickering light as his wife clicked the switch on and off, on and off, gleefully crowing about how she was up first for once. In a moment, Steve was going to reach out and drag her back to bed, making her laugh and squeal.
Bucky was making his way back over to check on him again, having danced a few dances with a girl with beautiful dark skin and even darker hair. Steve waved frantically at him, shaking his head. It was childish, but he'd learnt the hard way that heads rarely turned his way if Bucky was nearby. He pointed towards the bar, where Barnaby was just getting served. Bucky followed his point, realised what was happening, gave Steve a huge thumbs up and a grin and disappeared back out into the dancing. Crisis averted.
. Tony knew it. He'd known it from the start. But he could fix this, he would fix this -
The last words were spoken barely above a whisper. 'What?' Tony asked.
The word suddenly struck him.
Something in the back of his mind associated the words with Tony Stark, who, now that Steve thought about it, had seemed pale and exhausted during their brief conversation that morning. The thought made him ask, 'Did something happen with Stark recently?'
Peter was still crying the bedroom, his wheezing getting worse. Steve went back to him, feeling like he wanted to cry himself, and wrapped him up in a hug.
Steve took the glass from him, took a tentative sniff, and sipped.
‘I only learnt for the job,’ Steve admitted. ‘Still, you can choose a favourite now.’
And I was like
'You are intruding,' Jarvis said, and everything lit up.
'I just had a better idea,' he said, getting to his feet.
Steve's jaw set stubbornly, and Tony knew then that Steve wasn't going to answer the question, and everything that silence would mean.
‘Nothing.’
The blank page stared back at Steve, utterly remorseless. He supposed he ought to be grateful that his English and History teachers had agreed he could use this for part of his make-up grade in both classes, but he
'The glass will now be electrified,' Jarvis announced, and Peter yelped in fright, but there was no accompanying shock. All that happened was that the glass around him heated up slightly.
And then, there was the sound of explosions out in the yard.
'So do you,' Steve said, quietly.
Oh, hell, was the Captain going to start crying in his car? Tony had a strict no-tears policy within a radius of several feet around him. He had no interest whatsoever in dealing with anyone else's drama. Anyone who cried was immediately put out on the kerb. Thankfully, Steve's eyes remained dry.
'No,' Steve said. 'The trail's dead anyway. You go home, get some sleep, get a shower, and we'll come tomorrow.'
'Then show me,' she said, not sure how to respond to the second half of his sentence. He obliged, lifting her onto the counter and proceeding to demonstrate his love in a
Lily guy laughed and shrugged. He was still wearing the black suit, although now that Steve looked again, he noticed the jacket had some kind of insignia on the front pocket. After a second, he placed it. It was on the uniforms for the fancy private school a few blocks away. Maybe they finished later for summer. Either way, it probably wasn’t what you’d wear to a funeral. Oops.
'What's this about?' Steve asked again.
'You know you're ridiculous, right? And possibly insane,' he said.
'Okay, if you're sure,' Ron smiled, and went back to mopping. Tony hurried as fast as his aching limbs would allow over to the door. Hanging nearby was an oversized black hoodie, which he pulled on over his T-shirt, zipping it up to his chin and pulling the hood up as far forward as it would go. For once, Tony wasn't in the mood for selfies with his adoring fans, so he was planning to travel incognito. He found his dark glasses in the pocket and slipped them on too, hoping he would be more anonymous than he felt.
Steve nodded and sat back up, scanning the crowd. 'Got him,' he said. 'It's okay, he's going to dance. I don't think he noticed you.'
More pressingly, however, was the pulsing black mass in front of him. It looked hollow, like the mouth of a tunnel, but it was shifting in a way that seemed almost organic. Every so often it would flicker with a crackle of blue electricity, a flash of green light, close up like it was going to disappear before erupting open again. Steve had a feeling he was about to be pushed into it, and that he wouldn't much care for it when he was.
'Bar... are you meant to be at a marriage meeting right now?'
'So, you aren't actually getting married,' Bruce said. 'When are you planning to tell Thor?'
Bucky glared at him but dropped into a chair. While Steve had been at his meeting with Howard, Sarah was out meeting with Tony Stark at some coffee shop. She was supposed to have been back by now. Bucky had come to see how it had gone, and when he saw she wasn't there had become even more jittery than Steve.
Tony thought, gazing at that strong jaw line.
,' Tony replied, picking up the hammer and pretending to wipe dust off it.
'This is a new look for you, Stark,' he said. 'Looks biological to me. I knew you weren't out of the weapons game just because your company is gone. Human enhancement. Imagine the beautiful destruction you could cause. A kingdom of ash to be
Steve took a deep breath. Tried to ignore the rattle.
'If you want to use the lab, Osborn, I'm happy to supervise you. Just don't touch anything without asking.' Tony knew from Osborn's face that he'd touched a nerve, and slid off his stool to his feet, just in case.
'That's like saying the Earth is the
'Vita-rays?
(‘And the next time Tony showed up,’ Bucky would say, as the laughter died down. ‘This stupid punk looks into those big brown doe eyes of his and can’t bear to let him down and so
'Fine,' Tony pouted and opened the door. 'Well then, Sheriff, shall we?'
you,' Tony said, angrily, slamming the bowl down onto the side table. 'I told you if you were hurt – if you died -' He took a deep, shuddering breath, eyes filling with tears. He looked terrible, pale and exhausted. The blue ribbon on his jacket was brand new.
Stark was the bigger problem right now. Not only did he apparently not care about his precious armour, which he had left discarded behind him, he had seemed practically gleeful about killing the guard. Steve was reminded, again, just what sort of person he was working with.
him like he wanted-
'No, no, Steve, listen. Angela has a
'I thought you were an art student.'
‘I know, Pete, I know, but…’ Steve wasn’t sure where to begin. Even if he tried to explain that Iron Man wasn’t a good guy, Peter wouldn’t understand. And he was Peter’s hero, no matter what happened , Steve couldn’t take that from him. Not now. Not even if he had to be the bad guy himself. ‘You aren’t well enough.’ He finished.
a dad. A dad who loved him and meant the world to me. The first friend I had here. I don't want to just act like he was never here.'
'Which song would you like?' Jarvis asked.
'I didn't have you down as a giggly drunk,' he said. 'I thought you'd be a morose one. Bucky always got really fatalistic whenever he'd had a few too many. We'd be debating the point of existence while I hauled him home.'
'How are you doing, Cap? You okay?'
Later, he would blame his preoccupation with the fight for what happened next. There were only ten Skrulls, a single rebellious landing party that wanted revenge on the Avengers for something or other (Steve wasn't the leader any more, he didn't have to listen), and usually it would have been a relatively simple matter to mop them up. Problem was, that meant Steve had time to think, and the more time he had to think, the more irritated he became.
'Don't you dare laugh at him!' He roared. 'Of course he doesn't have a future as an artist! He doesn't have
'What? No I'm not. How?'
'Yeah, but, shit, Steve, your mom's insurance-'
'I... I thought...'
'Bio-Electrokinesis,' Stark grunted, and the flight suit was retreating now, withdrawing back into his shirt. 'Not important. Get an ambulance, he isn't out of the woods yet.'
‘Another day, maybe, Steve said. ‘Now just sit still for a bit until you feel better.’
'But-'
It was where Barnaby had touched him, on the kerb outside the bar.
'Are you alright?'
Steve was between them in an instant. 'Leave him alone, Stark.'
He started crying, even though he knew he should be brave and strong, because he couldn't help it, because his dad was Captain America, and he'd saved Peter, and a monster had eaten Mr Stark, and Peter didn't really get what was happening, but it had all started because he was sick and Mr Stark had helped him and now it had all gone crazy and he
, and eventually the doctor had given him something else that made him really sleepy and not notice the hurting so much.
Stark would keep texting Peter, of that Steve was certain. Well, he wasn’t going to let that happen. Hands still trembling with rage, he prised open the back of the phone and removed the SIM card, crumpling it before tossing it in the trash. Peter would still be able to play his games and get on the wifi, but, crucially, he would no longer have a phone number.
'This is Chateau Mouton Rothschild,' Tony told him, finishing topping up the glasses. '1918 vintage. I ordered it just for you. Try some.'
Tony swallowed. Steve being bi wasn't news, but if Steve could compliment a woman and not him, his actual boyfriend, what did that mean? And if Steve
'Sure,' Steve had said, swallowing hard, unable to say what he had really wanted to. He felt sick at the idea that Stark thought that's what their arrangement was, that Steve would do something like that. But beneath that, he had felt the beginning nips of a sadness that had been steadily growing ever since, gnawing away at his guts. Because if Tony thought this was just
'Oh. Well, tonight it's just you and me. You can forget it for a while.'
His mom laughed, and Bucky left. Steve lay in bed, feeling the gut wrenching feeling of shame and guilt wash over him, way more painful than whatever was wrong with him this time. He was the man of the house, he ought to be the one taking care of his mom, and yet time after time they ended up relying on Bucky. It was bad enough that his mom insisted on him going to art school, so his only income came from the jobs he could fit around class while she worked every hour under the sun; it was worse that he was so damn sickly that he'd wind up stuck in bed a few weeks every winter, not doing anything.
, and something Steve had done, a mistake he had made, and now all was lost. Perhaps it was shell shock, Peggy thought, a hysterical, nervous attack over something that had happened years ago, a comrade lost in the war. She didn't dare let go of him long enough to get him a brandy, and doubted the alcohol would have any effect anyway. The other thing was, she supposed, to slap him; try and shock him back to reality, but he was crying so brokenly in her arms that she couldn't bear to give him any more pain. So, wondering if she really was acting in his best interest, she let him cry, holding him tightly, stroking his back and his hair, trying to ground him.
Strangely, probably due to some symptom of trauma, Tony could not really remember the events of that night. He could only remember how he recounted them just after five the next morning, when the firefighters had deemed it safe for them to go back into the building, and he had been marched straight to the principle's office.
'I can't believe we're in the middle of the city.'
‘No, no, you were right. Pink roses for beauty. Red is for love, obviously, and white is for, um... purity?'
(He’d been warned not to, but Steve hadn’t been sure he would listen.)
'But I only have an hour before the next class comes in!'
Maybe the Christingles weren't so bad after all.
And he stabbed him, one of the tentacles boring like a drill right through him, then coming back out with a sickening squelch. Blood and viscera fell to the floor. Osborn fell with it.
He could see Stark's face, pale, his eyes closed. The wriggling dark mass seemed to be trying to turn back into a flight suit again. Steve paused, not sure what else he could do without injuring Stark.
– that's it for me. You understand? That's it.'
'I have conditions.'
'Fine, Jupiter, but the sun is still ten times the size.'
'What?'
'I might have had a little chat with him.'
'Not that,' Steve interrupted. 'Why is that your first question?'
Natasha took a deep breath. This team really needed more gender representation. But Clint was married, right? He was probably used to buying tampons. He probably did it all the time. 'Clint?'
'No, look,' Steve said, taking the orange back. 'It's a symbol.'
all of that, but my actual condition is this. If I show up at this kid's birthday party on Friday,
, like they'd had back in that ancient society; that in Roman times Plato would have defined it as
'Prayers?'
'Yeah,' Tony replied. 'It was one of the bigger stories that year. Destroyed the last few hold-outs who still wore briefs.'
'Yeah, it'll really make a difference when I'm trying to make small talk at the graduation ceremony for your seventh PhD,' Steve started to roll his eyes, but Tony kissed him feather-light between them, before planting one firmly on his mouth, pulling him close.
When he'd woken at last, Tony's eyes had been bloodshot enough to be almost completely red, and Steve had been unsure whether it had been tears or booze that had made them that way.
Steve said nothing, just smiled at him innocently. Tony flushed pink.
'You realise that your photo is in literally every history book, right?' Tony asked, because it sounded considerably less stalker-y than 'I ran a full background check and hacked Shield', and he didn't think the Captain would be into that.
For the first time, Bucky paused. 'Exactly how much debt are you in?' He asked.
Natasha rubbed her face. It was wet.
'Uh, not as sickening as you and
'Jarvis, where's Steve?'
‘No…’
But not now, not yet. The spectre of his engagement, of the Starks, was tomorrow's problem. Tonight there was just this. Just them.
'I know.'
'Well,' Tony said. 'Today's just going great so far, isn't it?'
want that!’
Steve checked his watch; Natasha was distressed and waiting for him. Nearly twenty minutes had elapsed since he had left her. He hurried to the till.
Bucky shook his head and rolled his eyes, then turned back to the fire. Tony made his way to the kitchen, where he found Steve standing by the sink staring into space. He hadn't yet turned on the tap.
‘What’s happened?’ He asked, immediately trying to think who he could get to watch Peter if Shield needed him. No-one came to mind.
With a herculean effort of will, Steve managed to half open his eyes. His vision was blurred, mostly eye lash, and nothing more to see than an empty room.
. When he pressed them, they all agreed that he had been acting oddly during those months, not quite himself, but it was only in retrospect that they'd realised it was a sign he'd already been growing sick. His doctors told him not to worry about it, not to try and push himself into remembering, but they didn't know how frustrating it was to constantly feel as if the memories were just out of sight, round the corner or behind a wall, and not be able to reach them. If he had been bound, he wouldn't even have the glimpses; just a white fog of nothing. And now his teachers wanted him to pretend to be someone who volunteered for that? It was insensitive at best. He threw the assignment aside.
. Steve hadn't failed to notice the sheer amount of
Steve was a second behind him, but one of the tentacles already had Osborn pinned to the wall by his throat. Peter was strapped to a table in the centre of the room. The adult-sized restraints had obviously been too big, so he was bound with straps, wound into the restraints built into the table. From one of his arms, a slow drip of blood flowed down a tube, collecting in a flask at the bottom.
ago, Tony, when Timely was a hell of a lot worse off than it is now. I've been just
Tony buried himself in Steve's arms, and his world straightened out. Everything was right again. Of course, Steve was never leaving his sight ever again, but that was an argument for another day. For now he was content to ignore Steve's questions and apologies, and simply stay there, cuddled together with his son and his husband, enclosed in their own little perfect world.
'So what?' Steve asked. 'Even if you don't believe it, they're still fun to make.'
‘Six,’ Steve said. ‘If you want to get on her good side.’
'It's a Charity Marriage. That's
He was trying not to think. Hard work for a man with one of the highest intellects in the world, but he was trying. When Peter napped, he worked on equipment for the team. If Natasha had been in that building as well then-
'Don't. I'm okay. I have a lot of therapy.' Then he frowned. 'Wait, do I still get therapy when I'm in proper jail? I don't know how jail works. Do I have to join a prison gang? I mean, that's assuming I can find one that will take me, goodness knows I will probably be the only rich white guy in there. This country is seriously broken, I mean have you seen-'
No. No, not that, not again. Close your eyes, close all your eyes, take a deep breath. Remember.
The next day, Rhodes showed up, pushed her into a car, and took her to the doctor to get a new prescription of the pill. He told her, quite firmly, that she was getting therapy. Now. Natasha agreed.
Steve huffed a laugh. ‘They’re weeds.’
'Tony?'
The goal was pretty obvious, to get out of here and beat the bad guy.
(It had probably traumatised him.)
'Nothing. Just wanted to check what Stark was up to.'
'Yes,' Steve agreed. 'It's a new lease of life. I really can't thank you enough.'
'There you are. What are you doing in here?' Steve asked, bending to kiss him on the cheek and spiking him with evergreen leaves in the process. 'I got a wreath,' he said, proudly, holding it up.
'Dad?'
Tony laughed. 'You say the same thing to every horse you meet. And I think they've figured you out.'
'I want you to come. Well, maybe not to this one. But soon.'
But he couldn't help it. Every time he made a bigger and better weapon, he would try to focus on the technological miracles he was working, that America could sleep safer, that he was richer, that the jobs of his employees were safer. But always, always, in the back of his mind he would note that Oscorp had been pushed a little further out of the market.
Stark must have done something reckless, because it was the Captain's voice that came over the comms first, saying exasperatedly, '
‘Has he been talking to you when I’m not around?’
anything?
, and I was like
Steve jumped and stared at him, only just catching hold of the railing again. 'That's the Stark Industries building,' he said. 'We're on top of Stark Industries.'
The surgeon had wanted to amputate, and Steve hadn't been surprised, but Tony had hissed like a rattlesnake and pushed his way between them.
Steve needed to open his eyes
The first recorded Charity Marriage was in 1634 between Edward Monkton and Hannah Smith, though from Monkton's diary historians believe the practice already existed. Monkton states that, 'having come upon the age of marriage in the New World' (1) he and other wealthy European settlers found the pool of acceptable candidates within their own
'Ron Stephenson, Mr Stark.' When the name drew no recognition, the man elaborated. 'I come in three times a week. I'm your housekeeper.'
Interesting.
There was a beat of silence as Stark and the Captain gazed questioningly into each other's eyes. It was terribly romantic.
kind. And why hadn't he just bought one of the larger bottles instead of several small ones? Tony discovered the answer to this when Steve pulled the empty bubble tea cup out of his hands and replaced it with one of the bottles. It was wonderfully cold.
'I'll try,' Tony said.
'Fine,' he said.
'Not that one. Tell me why you don't let Peter call you dad.' When Steve didn't reply, Stark kept prompting. 'I mean, you've raised him since he was a baby. You're all he remembers. And you love him like a real father would. More than some real fathers would.' There was a note of bitterness in his voice. 'So why don't you let him call you dad?'
, ever since he had woken up, but neither the doctors nor his dad would let him get out of bed, let alone leave the hospital.
'Come on,' he said, irritably, getting to his feet. 'Let's go make sure your kid isn't stuck to the ceiling or something.'
They laughed again, Richard promised to see what he could do, they shook hands and Steve left. That was it.
‘H-hi,’ Peter said, and Steve tried to look at him through a strangers’ eyes, saw his tousled hair, his oversized Iron Man t-shirt and
'Come on,' Stark said, and he was smiling. 'I'm good. Who needs armour anyway, right?'
'A plane has just crashed into the street a few miles away.'
'Oh, go stick your head in a pig, Osborn.'

It wasn't like he'd never lost anyone before. Grief ran through each of his lives like the spreading stain of black ink. Gail.
remit, Stark. If our dads found out you were violating the agreement-'
He hadn't yet tried out any of the old tales on Peter, though. He would probably cry.
With water, his limit was much lower. He had managed five days before he started to feel headachey and dehydrated. Again, he did not know how long he could survive without it.
'But my husband finally has a degree,' Tony sniffed theatrically. 'I no longer have to be ashamed of being married to a bimbo.'
, why did you call us all the way back here just to-'
, and then glanced at his phone in apparent confusion.
Steve eyed the fallen pillow. Tony had spent more on them than Steve cared to remember, and he couldn't help but feel they ought to be treated with a little more care.
. If she could just get back on the pill this whole thing would feel so much more manageable. She wished, for the first time, that she could talk about it. That she could tell Steve about the way it felt like there was a wall in front of her that she couldn't pull down, like she could see what she wanted but couldn't get there. But she couldn't stop remembering the cell, and the smell, and it was vile, it was so vile, and how could she ever confess to Steve about how disgusting she had been?
Tony stiffened, but Steve's gentle hands didn't even break their rhythm. Tony looked up at him. Steve had that expression again, that enraptured expression full of love, but this time he was looking at Tony.
They were sprawled out over the bench, Steve's back pressed up against one end, with one of his arms securely wrapped around Tony's waist and the other stroking his face. Tony was propped up on Steve's shoulders, kissing him. He sighed into Steve's neck at the interruption. Steve reached into Tony's jacket pocket and fished the phone out.
At last, Peter handed the phone over. Steve opened up the message screen, his blood running cold, his mind racing. The messages went back to their meeting, least one every day since the hospital visit. Mostly they seemed to focus on science and the suit, some of which Steve understood and some of which he was amazed Peter did. It was, he realised, entirely possible that Peter actually was a genius. His replies were rare, just now and then sending a greeting and what seemed like every emoji installed on the phone, but Stark clearly wasn't put off. Steve found the link to the YouTube video about counting near the top, and realised from the time stamp that it had been sent right under his nose, in the middle of dinner. Probably when he had been talking about Peter wanting to be able to work out multiplication on his fingers.
There were no lights on as he crossed the marble floor of what must have been the lobby, back when the place was still used as Stark Industries headquarters with just a few residential floors on the top. As Steve passed through, peering through the glass partitions at the abandoned offices, he realised there was no dust. The whole place looked completely sterile, as if nobody had ever been there. The only sign of life in the whole place was the soft glow of light from the elevator shaft, showing that that, at least, was operational. The penthouse, then. Steve went and pressed the call button.
'Everything good, kid?' Tony asked.
Steve knocked on the top of the table. 'This table's ride or die. As long as you're under my table, I hate who you hate.'
'Sheriff,' the rancher said, with a suspicious look in his eyes.
'So... this tall, dark and handsome. Is he...?'
Trying to hide his reluctance to go back out in the cold, Steve obediently bundled himself up in coat, hat, scarf and gloves as beside him Tony did the same. Soon afterwards they were out on the street, walking to a destination unknown.
'Thank you for looking after me.'
'That isn't really any of your business, blue-eyes,' Stark replied, and he reached forward to pat Steve's knee under the table. Steve moved his leg. Stark moved his hand. The pat was definitely becoming more of a rub, but just as Steve went to say something, there was a sudden flash of light.
The thing was, Tony Stark traditionally did not respond well to change, and he did not like the stand in drivers or heads-of-security who popped up when Happy took vacation time, and Pepper and Happy did not like listening to Tony whine about the replacements. And so they had come to an arrangement where Happy would chose wherever in the world he wanted to go, Pepper would arrange it all, and Tony paid for the flights and hotels on the condition that Happy took his time off at a moment's notice, when Tony was busy with something and wouldn't need him for a few days. Later, Tony would text Pepper to say it was over and she would recall Happy while Tony slept it off. The arrangement suited them all so well that Tony hadn't realised that was how it was happening for the best part of a year.
(‘And the rest,’ Bucky would say, ‘We all know.’ And he would raise his glass to toast the happy couple.)
'More important things to do, J.' Tony waved the implied admonishment aside. 'How long do I have before he's back? Are they wrapping up?'
'That was an order, Spiderman,' Steve said, in his most blessedly Captain-America-esque voice. 'We need to investigate without civilians getting into danger. We'll come back to you once we've taken a look.'
'Approximately one-third of the way through his usual run, sir.'
(The embarrassment had traumatised Steve.)
. Somewhere he could still hear the animal noises of pain the him strapped to the table on the Skrull ship was making.
But this was
If he had been a little slower, the bullet would have gone right through his heart. He'd turned away just in time, curling up instinctively, and the bullet had gone straight through his right shoulder and into his wrist.
Untangling himself from Steve, Peter nodded.
, and even his dad finally started to realise his potential, but then his parents died too and he was alone, in charge of a company that employed thousands, with no clue what he was doing because, guess what, he had never learnt how. All of that was Osborn's fault too.
Steve laughed at that, and, Tony was sure, manoeuvred deliberately so he could get away from Tony's hand on his back and take it instead.
Peter nodded. His face was turned to the side, nestled against Steve's chest, so he saw Stark first, and smiled.

and that Steve had just
'But?'
Maybe this guy was a weirdo after all. Or he was just as nervous as Steve was. Either way, Barnaby quickly moved the conversation on.
'You know I have other friends,' Tony pointed out. He was definitely popular, anyone in school would be glad to hang out with him. Okay, so, he had maybe four actual friend-friends, but still. Well, two, if you didn't count Ana and Jarvis. But definitely not none, which was the point here. 'Anyway, you aren't leaving until December. The
'Liar,' he said, and pushed her gently down on the couch. She picked up the hot water bottle and pressed it into her stomach. The painkillers had more or less taken care of the cramps, but the warmth felt comforting, reassuring. She felt almost normal. No more period today. But she was definitely going to eat the chocolate just as soon as Steve left so she could shove it all in at once like the Hulk.
another part of him protested.
'That, Captain,' Fury replied, 'Is the Avengers Initiative.' He turned to Tony, and actually cracked a smile. 'Welcome to Shield.'
'Ga,' Peter agreed. He wasn't paying much attention to the adults, more interested in the light of the arc reactor, running his hands over it with clumsy fingers. Peter loved the arc reactor, which meant that Tony loved it too.
'Hey, buddy,' he said, quietly, ashamed. 'How you feeling?'
Tony agreed, because he recognised those 'stings' for what they were; blasts of electrokinetic energy that would be perfect to power the suit, lying in pieces on the other side of what now seemed to be a very flimsy wooden door. Venom had only needed a host to break out, and Tony, it turned out, had only needed Venom.
Some countries were starting to allow binding again for the purposes of therapy and in the treatment of trauma, and before he got sick Steve might have agreed, but now... it was like part of him was missing. The months before his illness were all but gone; just hazy, half-remembered things that glinted in the corners of his mind but vanished when he turned to look at them. His friends had told him about things he had done, shown him the pictures, and they were familiar, but not
‘Peter. When did Mr Stark tell you about that?’
,' Pepper clarified, waving a finger between them.
now. Was that possible? Was it going to burst? She was not going to die because of her own urine soaking into her blood stream. She stood up, trying to ignore her stomach screwing up in pain as she did so. 'I have to pee,' she said, for no real reason, shoving past Cap's legs and making a beeline for the bathroom.
'You can't tell me your mom has agreed to this?'
, but didn't try to stop Tony from falling into step alongside him. They continued along the street.
tell them-
'I have to go patrol,' he said.
Except Steve wasn't leaving. He'd sat back down, but still looked awkward, leaning forward on his elbows and staring at his feet.
They headed to the door together. For a moment, it looked like Agent Romanov was going to say something else, but then she simply smiled, nodded, and left. Steve went back to Peter.
'Hey beautiful,' he called mockingly, 'Let's take this back to my place.'
. Jim.
Steve looked concerned. 'Are you okay?'
'I'll climb out the window.' Maybe he would anyway. Though, as much as he cared about Bucky, there was someone else he'd want to see first.
But she was beautiful. It made his heart ache again, to see her looking so much like his Tony and yet not. She had a weak chin, and he suddenly understood why his Tony always kept a beard and loved it all the more. When he got back, if he got back, he would rub that beard all over his face.
in Taiwan.
'Oh,' Tony said, looking at the ring.
The truth was, she needed to pee. Natasha Stark had a bladder of steel; it wasn't often that she needed to go, but there was no use denying it. Right then, she needed to go bad.
. It was very basic maths, but, in Steve's eyes at least, it showed the innate understanding of concept that Peter had been displaying since he was 18 months old, far before he'd had any formal teaching. Not that he'd had any now; nursery was not practically possible. But Peter had an inquisitive mind, begged to learn, and was well on his way to being able to read for himself. He could also count (Steve was not sure how high, he had once let Peter get all the way to 500 before he stopped him) and add and subtract numbers up to ten; basically anything he could use his fingers for. He definitely understood the idea of multiplication and division, too, but hadn't yet found a way to do this on his hands. Steve was almost relieved. Talent was one thing, something he could be proud of, but
,' Bucky amended, emphasising the S. 'When about five fellas turned out to beat Steve up, they realised she'd been messing them all around. It turned into an all out brawl and eventually me and Steve managed to escape in the confusion.'
'I know, Bar, I know. It's going to be okay.'
The day after that, Steve got out of hospital and missed Tony even more. He kept checking his contacts as if the name and number could magically appear there, or as if he could have somehow have forgotten Tony giving it to him.
'Okay, maybe that's enough wine,' they all chorused together, laughing. Steve was particularly tickled by the story, and every time he looked at him Tony could almost see the mental image forming in his mind before he would burst out laughing again. Steve's laugh, Tony thought, might be the best sound in the world.
'She gets a good wage, better than the industry standard,' Stark said. 'But not as much as I'm going to be paying for you, my marvel of modern medicine.'
Hands shaking with anger, he called the number Stark had been texting from. He picked up after the third ring.
'The evidence would suggest otherwise,' Steve replied, calmly. 'Widow reckoned you had a voice kink; guess now we know for sure.' He sipped unconcernedly at his juice.
He could quit. Send the ring back and refuse to go any further. But then they would be bankrupt, his mom would be on the street because he was too expensive to live. He couldn't do that to her, not for a boy he had, after all, only known for a few hours. He owed her too much. He had to do it for her, even at the expense of his own happiness.
more than touching over the years.)
'Alright. I'll be right back.'
In the end, there had been no choice at all, really. If this really was it for Peter, Steve wanted to have as much time with him as possible. At this point, he knew, it was about quality, not quantity. But he hated it. Every so often it would hit him again, and every time it was like the first time all over again. He couldn’t take it, so he shut it out, tried not to let himself think about it, tried not to notice how everyday it took Peter longer to wake up, how much less energy he had. At least he was happy. Steve had to hold onto that. He hadn’t made a mistake, he hadn’t.
‘No, how many?’
'Ask Peter to stay in his room, please, Jarvis,' Steve said, and Tony sort of loved that Steve was comfortable enough in his house to do that, and because he was thinking that, he didn't have any time to mentally prepare for Fury sweeping his way into the room.
Steve thought, but just about managed to hold back from saying. They were desperate for money, yet his mother had repeatedly hesitated over this arrangement. Stark didn't care a bit what happened to his son, provided it made them look good. What an asshole. If he really did marry Tony, and Howard came to visit, Steve had a vast selection of laxatives and not-quite-toxic coffee-coloured paints that might accidentally find their way into his father-in-law's drinks.
Peter looked at the door. This must have been the program Mr Stark had told him about. 'Are you Jarvis?'
'Yes, well, I just compromised my identity, so you should be grateful.'
Rhodes also came once or twice, even though Tony hadn't apologised to him in his speech, and spent the whole hour of his visit telling Tony what an idiot he was. Tony knew he was forgiven.
Steve had just finished shaving, with horsehair brush and cut throat razor, and he turned from the washstand to see Stark sitting on the bed, watching him. Steve frowned and said 'What are you doing?'.
'We aren't letting you and Venom within two hundred feet of each other,' He said. 'And we're not asking for weapons. My psychologists were annoyingly insistent on that; they think you're 'unstable' and could 'kill us all' if I leave you in a room full of sabotage-able weapons. Open your file.'
'Da!' an overjoyed little voice said, and Tony rocketed upright to see Clint standing there with Peter in his arms, the child reaching out towards him.
‘Then you know there was nothing wrong with them. I was just giving the kid a bit of science and tech talk, a bit of mental stimulation, which, let’s be honest, he wasn’t getting from you.’
'You're late.'
'I know, I know, you're about to try and pass the name off as a big coincidence and tell me how much crap you got for it in the army, blah blah blah, and then I'm going to say bullshit, because it is, and we'll argue back and forth a bit but eventually you'll admit it because a, I'm right, and b, sorry, gorgeous, but I am way smarter than you and there is no way you could outwit me.'
‘When assholes like me come in demanding certain colours,’ Tony finished. ‘Oops, sorry. I don’t suppose there’s a
Steve nodded, still wide-eyed. 'Hearing him say that... that he was wrong...' He shook his head in disbelief, but a smile began to tug at his lips. 'It's thrown me for a loop. But... it's also a big relief. To know the person your closest to won't judge you.'
‘You stay away from Peter,’ Steve said again, his voice quiet. ‘I mean it, Stark. You ever contact him again and I’ll tell Shield everything. I’ll put on the Captain America uniform that you’re so damn obsessed with, stand up in court, and a national symbol will swear to the world that you’re Iron Man.’
He could reach down and run his fingers through Tony's hair, feel it curl around them, Steve thought. He'd done it before, one night back in the winter when Tony had stayed out too long and come back cold, and he'd made a noise like old Abraham's cat when it got the fish. Tony adamantly denied he'd done any such thing, but Steve knew he liked it.
For a moment Steve was confused, then he saw the downright
And Steve was here, getting ready for the funeral, for giving a eulogy where he would talk about his
'Huh?' Steve asked. 'Tony, I just got home. I don't intend on leaving the tower until New Year.'
'Defended you,' Steve said, before realising that Barnaby had meant if he had been faced with his own evil ex. To be honest, if she turned up, he didn't know what he would have done. Asked her if what they had done counted as sex, maybe.
Natasha wanted to hit him. 'No! Lady problems!'
'What have you done?!' Steve demanded. 'What the hell have you done to him?!'
'Me? Yeah, fine, he didn't touch me.'
‘I’m calling 911,’ Tony said. ‘Hang tight, beautiful.’
'I'm calling 911,' Steve said, hauling himself up on the wall, because that was definitely enough to cause alcohol poisoning; but he was stopped by Barnaby grabbing his trousers.
'Mine was probably Christmas 1935, the Blue Diamond, Melanie Jackson,' Steve said thoughtfully, making Bucky roll his eyes and nod in agreement. At Tony's questioning look, Steve smiled and explained, 'I was seventeen, and I asked the prettiest girl in school to dance with me at the Blue Diamond's Christmas party. Her boyfriend wasn't very happy.'
Except, of course, he didn't. Steve had been staying in Tony's house the best part of a year now, and he still had managed to not cross that line. Just about. If he did, and they were caught, Tony would be strung up for sodomy and maybe, if the preacher was to be believed, sent to eternal damnation. Steve privately thought that the God he knew had mercy on temptation, that it was hard to see the sin and darkness in a feeling that made him feel like he was being flooded with light from the inside out; but what did he know? He couldn't risk it. Besides, he knew the law of men right enough, and he knew how easy it would be to get caught. So no, he did not kiss Tony's hair that day, just like he didn't kiss it any other time. He was careful that there was never anything improper between them, besides the feelings he kept locked in his breast. Tony said their relationship was
'It's me,' he said. 'Just me.'
Then there were the little gifts, the small luxuries Steve would enjoy but wouldn't buy for himself; fluffy socks and bubble bath, the truffles he could eat by the truckload. Those weren't particularly secret. But Steve's main present, his
Gradually, it worked. His colour selections changed. His shapes changed from angry splodges to controlled strokes. He thought about Barnaby, about laughing with him in the diner, about his eyes, about how he had looked hunched under the table, about dancing with him. More and more of the anger got painted over, got blended into everything else, until it was just a baseline in the music Steve was painting. Soon, he lost himself completely, pouring everything he felt onto the canvas.
Tony was in no mood for a Captain Sensible lecture. He knew six days was a long time, even for him. His need for bubble tea was greater than ever. 'Great, then you can thank me by getting me a bubble tea. Strawberry. Peach pearls. Chop chop.'
'Good morning, Sheriff.' He said, cheerily, shaking Steve's hand with a grip firmer than any Steve had ever felt. 'I think you're expecting me. Shall we go in?'
'Stark, wait, we need a plan-'
'So we're the exception? Everyone
'Stark!'
'Oh, be quiet,' Thor said, tiredly, and slammed the cell door shut, locking it tight before turning to Steve. 'He was making some very unseemly remarks to Miss Maximoff, and putting his hands where they clearly weren't wanted. I thought perhaps he needed to be reminded of the law around here.'
'I didn't expect you to be so eager,' his mom said to him, when he was ready to go twenty minutes early. 'Is there something you're not telling me?'
He missed Steve.
'Yeah,' Barnaby said. 'But be careful. Don't want you getting up close and personal with the pavement.' He rested a steadying hand on Steve's back, and somehow that felt more intimate than every other touch they had shared that evening. Steve turned to look at him. They were more or less eye to eye now, leaning in closer and closer.
'I just wanted to check you're okay. I mean, I don't know how long... uh, how long these things take, but it's been a while and I heard crying-'
They had been so excited for Peter's first birthday. They'd planned a party, invited the other families they knew from the hospital, booked a magician – and then, a week before, Peter picked up a cold, which quickly became a chest infection, which wound up as another hospital stay. They hung round at the hospital all day on his birthday, but he only woke up briefly, and was so grumpy he had no interest at all in his gifts.
