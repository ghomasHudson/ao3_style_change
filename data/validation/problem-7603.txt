fighting; the only time he’d ever get into fights was when he was stepping in to save me when I was getting my ass kicked. He never wanted to fight in a war. I don’t give a damn if his death was heroic, I just wanted my best friend to live.”
Steve was pulling Tony closer. It was subtle, and Tony wasn’t even sure if the other Avengers noticed. Thor, Logan, and Clint were yelling about some football game that Tony wouldn’t even begin to try to understand, while Bruce and Natasha were off in their own world reading different books and sneaking looks at one another.
whimper out loud because suddenly, the stranger is staring down at him, looking incredibly worried and also drop dead gorgeous.
Tony scoffs, waving off Coulson’s concerns. “You really think I want those overprotective alphas knowing about this? They’d never let me leave the tower again. Speaking of… I’m sure you know of Steve’s rule. I’m not supposed to leave the tower without some kind of supervision."
Clint’s eyes are narrowed as he stalks towards Tony playfully, “Why you little…”
“It’s not like you said anything but the truth, Tony.” Steve says in that soft, sad voice that Tony absolutely adores and hates at the same time.
2… the gun being cocked…
I’m also very open to suggestions. Im kind of in a mid writers block so any help is appreciated :3
“Was that just you breathing?”
Clint squawks, offended, “You only figured that out after feeling his muscles! I have biceps too, you know!”
Clint laughs from where he’s sitting at the breakfast bar. “Cap, 12 hours isn’t even that long for Tony. You’d probably have an aneurism if you knew how long his worst inventing-binge was.”
“Lockdown the lab and don’t let anyone in until Shield gets there.” Steve says, much more calm than Tony feels.
Tony lets out a self-deprecating laugh and looks at the ground, “I think freaked out is one word for what I was feeling.” He replies nervously, not really wanting to meet Steve’s eyes quite yet. “I’d honestly appreciate it if you just… you know, forgot everything I said in the elevator.” Tony tries, wincing only slightly as he meets Steve’s eyes, which look way too charmed for the current situation.
He looked at Logan and Natasha, the only two teammates in sight. Thor had been gone on his first “post-battle Hulk duty” with an excited smile, but Steve was sure that he wouldn’t be so bubbly when he got back.
“He has a sister.” She says, face pale as she faces the window. The boy is frozen, looking more terrified than he had before.
Tony groaned into the communicator while he watched Logan get thrown into the Statue of Liberty. Ouch.
There was muffled laughter in the background. “No! I don’t want it, Petey!” He heard a voice that may have been Tony’s.
when you’re not listening to me. And no one even knows what it is, they just think it’s boring engineer stuff—which is kind of
“Ha ha. You’re hilarious. You’re 2 months older than me, remember?”
“He can’t. He’s not old enough to get in.” Steve responds, scrubbing his face with his hands.
He’s hated Howard for making him afraid to stand up for himself, making him afraid that any alpha he ever trusts will one day betray him, making him afraid to bond with
*****
There was a rustling and a whine of “I don’t wanna! I don’t like them!” from Tony, Logan guessed. Eventually an upset voice answered glumly, “Yes?”
They had gone extinct. Captain America had single-handedly destroyed them and their destruction was the key to ending World War II.
Anyway, 2 Sundays ago was my birthday and I’m finally 15 (woot woot) so this is my reverse really late birthday presant to y’all.
There’s no question. “Of course, Tony.” He almost sounds reproachful, “I didn’t know him but there’s no doubt in my mind. You two loved each other. Of course he would want nothing more than for you to be happy.”
“He’s just a fucking kid.” The hairy one says.
Tony didn’t respond this time, he just nuzzled his head into the junction between Steve’s neck and shoulder. Steve sighed quietly and nodded to Bruce as he picked Tony up, Tony’s legs going around his waist subconsciously.
Steve opens his mouth, clearly about to contradict her words before the suspicious smell of old spice and leather fill the room. Fury blazes into the room, gesturing to a group of soldiers that immediately vacate the vicinity. “The girl is right, Rogers.” He all but mutters his first words and the remaining team members all but gape at him.
Clint Barton has learned a lot about Tony Stark in the one week that he has stayed in the tower. Tony Stark likes coffee, likes working in his workshop until ungodly hours of the night, likes his robots, and Tony Stark really likes Captain America.
Tony dropped the scissors he had just used to cut the bandage, barely missing his foot. “What!?” He yelled. “Where? I am not ready, Phil!”
at the same time. Tony wants to reach out, press their foreheads together or do something
Clint is still murmuring to Tony, this time much quieter to the point that Steve can’t hear much. It takes a moment before the two step away from each other. “Alright.” Clint sighs, squeezing Tony one more time before looking to Steve. “Cap, what’s our plan?”
Both are similar to the first, each filmed on a crappy phone, all by the same man. Each time Tony’s a little older, and each time he’s a little more injured.
Translations
Steve thinks that Clint knows, ‘cause ever since Steve asked Clint what a twink was, Clint hasn’t stopped giving Steve these false seductive looks whenever Tony’s around.
“Well, I wasn’t expecting someone as pretty as you to walk through those doors, so I guess you can say we’re both pleasantly surprised.” He said, keeping up his over confident demeanor. She laughed, a perfected fake one, Tony could tell.
Tony made sure that he was 10 blocks out the back entrance before having JARVIS alert the Avengers that his home-meeting was over. He didn’t feel like having to dead bolt his door or put panels over the air vents in his room, so he decided on taking a walk while he cooled off. Unfortunately, Tony was still to wound up after Justin Hammer being his normal, dick self and the Avengers being abnormally annoying. Or maybe they were always annoying and Peter just made him realize it today.
Tony wants to know more. What information could they possibly have on Tony? He had spent the years following his parents death throwing himself into the company and distancing himself from just about every other human being aside from Clint and occasionally Natasha. There’s no way HYDRA could have information on him unless one of the people closest to him were double agents. Or unless Howard truly gave them anything they wanted… maybe he wasn’t above sharing his own son’s secrets.
“Umm, hey dude? You alright?”
Steve’s starting to wonder if it was better when Tony was ignoring him because ever since Steve had made his move on him, Tony had become a complete tease. Tony actually started coming downstairs to see the team, only wearing Steve’s ratty old sweatpants loosely on his hips and nothing else. He would bite his lip and accidentally brush his hand against Steve’s shoulder or arm constantly. Steve wasn’t sure how long Tony was going to torture him.
“I’m so sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry. I didn’t
“I knew them when they were young. Ванда and Pietro. They were twins, just children…” Natasha shuts her eyes and clenches her jaw. From her side, Clint lays a hand on her shoulder.
The second that Steve heard Hulk, he knew that Loki wouldn’t be winning this battle. He watched as the Hulk smashed into the evil frost-giant, sickly satisfied at the pained and terrified noises coming from the man.
Loki said cockily, “I’m simply letting him re-live some childhood memories, little spy.”
“Can you not go through one day without getting drunk off your ass?” Tony retorted, his fourteen-year-old sass getting the better of him. His eyes widen and he shakes his head violently as soon as he says it. “I’m sorr-“
The automated voice was cut off by Steve’s shield.
be threatening you.”
“Who?” Clint asked immediately, but Bruce held up his hand. He gave Tony an inquisitive look, “Did he do anything? I was starting to assume you just feinted.”
Tony’s already halfway in love.
“We have been watching over Hammer ever since you and he had that “dispute” a year ago.” Coulson started.
Guilty, Tony bangs his head against the metal table, shaking away the unfair thoughts.

on the door with all its might. People are yelling. His name?
Pretty lady looked unhappy like Birdman.
The two don’t even glance at each other before scrambling after her.
He has plans. Plans that are all spread out across his workshop desk. Plans of miniature arc reactors that can create concentrated, controlled explosions. Stabilizers that can create feasible human flight. Ever since he perfected the arc reactor with Bruce’s inadvertent help, he had known there was a greater meaning for them, even beyond the implementation of clean energy. This had to be it.
“Yeah, you know, like the Broadway musical? “We built this city”? “Twisted Sister”?” Tony sighed in exasperation, “whatever, it’s just a nickname… Loki.”
Clint laughs again, probably due to the horrified look on Steve’s face.
“That’s sick, Shannon.” Callie said, sounding disgusted.
Tony smiles, bitter and mean, as he sits up. “Everyone always says that. ‘So sorry for your loss,’” The omega scoffs, a disgusted look on his face. “They don’t even know what to be sorry about.”
Tony then burst into tears and everyone left again except Steve.
It didn’t take long for Peter to get to the tower. Tony felt like he had rested for a solid 2 minutes when Peter came bursting through the doors. “Tell me everything!” Peter demanded.
more than anything else.
“He would be really helpful to Tony and Clint right now, buddy.” Steve nodded.
“Kid…” The bartender pauses for a moment. “Lemme see your ID.” He says slowly.
“Any chance you want to give me the current position of Captain America, Jay?” Tony asks as he begins his ascent.
take down HYDRA once and for all.
“Oh my god, what the fu-”
” Clint says, shock evident on his face and even Natasha, who had been busy inching closer towards Wanda, stops in her tracks.
“You’re actually serious?” He asks, just to make sure.
Clint’s amused and cocky expression faltered, shifting into a slightly guilty smile. “But, it’s just… Natasha and Bruce were so sure that Tony was going to make the first move after all that cute wrestling and then the dragging off to the bedroom, but Logan and I just knew that Steve had some dirty, pervy-old man in him!” Clint took a deep breath, “We had to find out somehow!”
Tony clenched his jaw, not wanting to gossip about Logan, but also not wanting to lie to the Captain. Tony figured that Cap would’ve figured out eventually anyway by reading Logan’s “team-mate” file. “You know what happened to you right? The serum, needles, pain, stuff like that?” Tony asked hesitantly. Steve nodded. “Well, that’s what happened to Logan. But they didn’t ask him first. And he wasn’t meant for anything other than an experiment that could potentially become their own personal weapon.” Tony gritted out.
Tony hardly notices the arms tightening from where they caught him around the waist because he’s busy drowning in the bluest eyes he’s ever seen. Blue eyes, dirty blonde hair, and a beard that frames a chiseled jaw line perfectly, Tony-
Peter knows that Tony wants to be alone so he gets up from his place in the stool and slowly makes his way to the glass doors. “You know, I think I should head out now, you know? I’ll text you.” Tony spares Peter one last look, giving a tired wave, and Peter suddenly sees the bags under his eyes. He sees the slight, uneven stubble on his friend’s cheeks and the slouched stature. He always knew that Tony wasn’t a great sleeper but he had never seen an 18 year old look so bone-tired. “Try and get a nap, Ant. Don’t drink too much coffee either. And eat your veggies.” Peter says good-naturedly.
Tony quickened his pace and lowered his head, underhandedly causing him to run into a tall man.
*****
Natasha quirks an eyebrow, “We’ve met before?”
The room was awkwardly silent for a moment. “Yes, Tony, you can go.” Nick sighed, waving his hand towards the door.
Tony sniffs, tossing the gun into a drawer in his desk before flipping down his goggles once more and lighting up the blow torch he had been working with. No need for handguns, Tony’s got his own weapons to test out.
“Neither have I.” The boy says shortly. He’s scared, it’s clear through the way he’s speaking and how he holds himself. It’s a huge contrast to how he was acting before Natasha walked in the room.
*****
“I really hope you’re not talking about yourself.” Tony mutters in disgust, nervously tapping his fingers against his jeans. He has made it clear countless times just how repulsive he finds Rumlow. “You should know by now I would rather bond with a cactus than with you, Rumlow.” He says hotly, pressing his hands against the alpha’s shoulders uselessly.
Natasha yelled, “Boys!” The two fuming men turned to look at her, glares still marring their faces. She narrowed her eyes right back at them as she helped a newly clothed Bruce to his feet. “While watching you two fight would be a joy on any other day, right now is not the time.”
Steve sighed, knowing he couldn’t possibly defy the laws of the puppy-dog eyes. “Yeah, okay Tony.” Steve went to sit on the floor, but Tony sleepily pulled him onto the couch next to him. “T-tony, I-“ Steve stuttered, glad that the darkness of the room concealed his blush.
And she left without a word. Suddenly, Tony is really glad that these people chose to be on his side: these great, amazing, scary and terrifying people.
isn’t his fault that he is furious right now. It’s taking all of Steve’s self-control to not let instinct out and growl as Tony collapses in his arms. He can feel the presence of the other alphas behind him and it sets him on edge.
The agent tries his best to hide his disheartened sigh, "This is for you. Please, only use it in case of an emergency.” Coulson says, placing an immaculate looking handgun in Tony’s palm before marching out of the room without a backwards glance.
upset when Steve hadn’t believed him and the apology did kind of make him feel better. “Well, I’m sorry too.” Tony says. He ignores Steve’s confused look as he flops down onto Steve’s mattress. “I know that you and Howard were close, it must suck to find out exactly what he was capable of.”
There was no response.
.” He’s crying again, but this time it’s different.
Steve just shakes his head. “HYRDA is long gone. I got rid of the last of them when I sunk the plane. And even
(This wasn’t the first time he had to resist this urge)
Tony’s imagining this, right? He didn’t fall into some alternate dimension while on an inventing binge,
and it was
Steve Rogers watched as the boy in front of him fell apart. He had seen it all the time in the army. He had felt this in the army. Steve said nothing, moving the teens hands to behind Steve’s neck, while Steve grabbed Tony from the middle and just hugged him.
“Uh.. um, Yeah, of course.” Tony stutters, not sure what the best response would be at this point. “We were just ah…  messing around.” He finishes, feeling only a little disgusting for agreeing with Rumlow, but also not wanting to step on anyone’s toes. He didn’t come in today to start any trouble.
Steve grimaced, listening to his teammates bicker. “Everyone listen up!” He said loudly. “There is no way that this-“ The Captain pointed at the lone, small drone that had relayed a somewhat terrifying message, “-was an accident.”
“Can everyone just calm down and tell me why Tony Stark is cuddling with Steve Rogers?”
Steve doesn’t say anything but Tony can feel the ghost of the words that the alpha wants to say.
Steve looks destroyed. Tony has to look away, unable to watch his own father disappoint Captain America the same way he had disappointed Tony years and years ago. With little else to do with himself, he looks back to Wanda.
Weight: 151.32
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony was cuddling with Captain America?
Tony screamed.
“No!” Tony yelled, causing Peter to jerk upwards quickly. “I wanna be hot and manly like you and like Steve! It’s not fair!” He whined.
Weapons, then.
When his eyes finally come into focus he just about drops to the ground in terror.
People love to talk about how terribly stocks dropped that day that he announced the shutdown of the weapons manufacturing branch of SI, but they rarely ever mentioned how now two years later, stocks have increased tenfold.
Tony patters over to Peter and says quietly, “You should go. For now.” He adds.
“Why is this taking so long, did it take this long the last time they attacked?” Tony asked, rocking back and forth on the couch.
It doesn’t help that Tony’s “shove” didn’t even come close to budging Steve. Not even close. “You’re a troll, you know that?”
Tony had tentatively hugged Rhodey, and with a nervous glance to Steve, he slowly let his hand fall out of Steve’s own. Then, the two friends went out towards the penthouse’s lobby.
Steve’s never exactly been good at relationships. Sure, Steve was nice to strangers and was a good friend, but when it comes to feelings and romance, Steve falls short. Everyone knows the story of Captain America’s lost love, Peggy Carter. No one knows the story of Steve Rogers’ non-existent love life. Frankly, Steve would rather keep it that way; Especially the whole part where he’s only interested in men.
Tony wants to tell them to fuck off.
Tony studied the helmet in his hands carefully. “What the heck?” He asked, mainly to himself. Tony guessed that somehow his subconscious wanted him to understand whatever this helmet was, but Tony didn’t even have a clue. Why would he need a helmet? It’s not like he could fight or do anything to anything except maybe a fly. (Maybe not even then, cause flies are really really fast)
“I’ve heard that one before.” The boy says, voice deeper and more accented than Steve had expected. He can’t decipher exactly what origin the accent comes from.
Tony wracks his mind, trying to remember why the name HammerTech sounds so familiar. He doesn’t have to wonder for long, though, because he’s stopped in his tracks the moment he opens the door to the main conference room.
“Now, now, Anthony, that’s not how we speak to our elders.” The voice is
There’s a laugh from behind him, “You really think that would stop him? He’s a teenager with a shit ton of money, nowadays it’s easy as hell to get a fake ID.” Logan scoffed.
and he’s
Howard is not here.
“Um-“ Tony stutters a bit. “Mr. Hammer,” He decides formally, “If this is all you came to discuss with me than I suggest you stop wasting my time and leave.”
Howard backhanded him with his class rings on and kicked him in the ribs a few times.
He clenches his jaw and lightly bangs his hand against his knee. “It was all bullshit.”
JARVIS once again relays the message and once again returns with a message from Steve, “What? Tony. What’s wrong with you?”
Tony shrugs as well as he can, seeing as he’s still hunched over the table.
Then came the pounding headache along with the rise in his throat. His eyes widened almost comically, throwing the arms that were around him off and in a flash he was slamming his body against the cold linoleum of the bathroom floor, puking his guts out into the toilet. There had been a startled yelp from the bed when he was racing over but he didn’t exactly have the time or care to think about that now. He hazily felt a hand rubbing from the back of his neck to the bottom of his spine. He also may or may not have heard words such as, “you’re fine.” “I’m so sorry.” And “It’ll get better, I promise.”
Tony shakes off his surprise in an effort to keep some kind of professionalism as he remembers this is a business meeting. “I’m doing great, Obie, and business has never been better. Thanks for coming by.”
Steve’s never been more comfortable in his time out of the ice.
After Logan gave Tony his little pep talk, Tony didn’t want to do much other than sleep. He was aiming for the guestroom downstairs, but Logan just shoved him down his hall. Tony really did not want to deal with Steve at that moment. He inhaled deeply and remembered Logan’s words, ‘be a kid your age.’
“I appreciate the concern, Steve, but right now is not food time. Bye.”
Tony’s eyes shifted to hers for a millisecond before returning to the wall behind Steve’s head. She sighed softly before going to sit by Bruce, who gave her a soft smile. Steve raised his eyebrow at Bruce, who just rolled his eyes at the look Steve gave him. Thor munched on one of the seven pop tart packages he had in front of him, completely oblivious to the outside world.
Clint doesn’t wait for any of the others to have a reaction; he just jumps right into the next video. And then the next.
To say the least, the video was not as helpful as they had thought. There are very little visuals. Tony had told them that his vision had gone dark but it seemed as though the entire workshop was experiencing the same issue. There’s a tinge of red smoke and a few visible shadows, but nothing concrete. Tony cringes as he turns on the audio and Steve’s heart
Tony backs away from the door slowly, trying his best to calm himself down. He flinches as a pounding fist hits the door and doesn’t release his breath until the shadow under the door disappears. Sliding down the wall opposing the doorway, Tony sits, ready to stay in this lab for days if that’s what it means to stay away from Steve’s righteous anger.
“All of your things have been transported to the tower.” Phil added.
“Howard was HYDRA.” Tony says quickly, words just above a whisper. He had already instructed JARVIS to warn them of anyone else’s arrival, but with this sensitive of information, he wanted to be careful.
Clint frowns slightly, “Jay, remind me?”
Captain.
Lies! All lies!” Tony yelled. Steve laughed again and pulled Tony against him, hugging him a little bit too hard, “Hey over-excessive! Steve! Bullying! Bruce! Bullying!!” Tony cried playfully, nipping at Steve’s ear.
Board meetings
“You’re insane. And so is Obadiah.” Pepper growls at him.
Peter has already brushed himself off and picked himself up by the time Steve comes back to reality.
Tony furrows his eyebrows, “Look, Steve, I totally forgot about our whole little pow-wow, okay? I’ve had a rough couple of days and JARVIS reminded me I had a meeting this morning. Plus, I didn’t even leave the tower, Cap, just a few floors down.” He tries his best to make his tone light-hearted. He can feel Steve’s worry from across the room.
. “Tony, listen to me. Everything is going to be just fine. Shield is probably already in the building. You’re going to completely safe. Trust me.”
Wanda meets his eyes with a dark, incredulous gaze. “HYDRA’s influence knows no bounds.”
Tony’s eyes stay narrowed but eventually he gives it up, huffing and taking Steve’s hand, “Don’t get used to getting your way, Rogers.”
Tony stares for a moment before a disgusted look comes over his face. “I’m not that short, I’m barely shorter than you! There are centimeters, Clint! Centimeters between us!” Tony shrieks, narrowing his eyes.
Like right now, it was Steve’s time to “babysit” Tony, so after deciding to show Steve some great movies that he missed, they were sitting on the couch watching Disney’s The Princess and the Frog. Tony was on the ground, leaning against Steve’s jean-clad leg and nuzzling his nose against it every so often, subconsciously, while also playing with a Rubik’s cube that he had solved at least 90 times within the 30 minutes the movie had been going on. Steve, on the other hand was completely engrossed in the movie.
“What about that psycho who was in here?” Steve asked, crossing his arms.
Tony looked taken aback for a second before recovering, “Yeah, um right that’s chill- or um cool? With me…” He said, backing his chair away. “Let me just go… get that done.” He said, already dialing numbers and walking out the door.”
Steve sputters. “How have
“Cap, we get it, none of us like leaving Tony behind, especially when there’s danger around, but you have to think about it logically. No one even knows about Tony’s involvement with the Avengers yet.” Natasha gave him a sympathetic glance.
Howard didn’t like stupid people.
Tony went for his mother first. At least she talked to him when she was drunk.
Tony’s eyes flickered tiredly as he grabbed at Steve’s shoulder. “Stev-“
Alright, well, that’s not what Tony expected. “Um.” He says, stunned for a moment before chasing after her. And by chasing, he means “quickly exchanging hellos with people while following her closely. He watched as she practically flew from to the side exit and he was about to completely run after her when a hard hand clamped on his shoulder, almost painfully. Tony nearly whimpered at the force, turning quickly to the smiling face of the one person he was supposed to stay away from.
Steve can’t hold back his pleased smile at that, cautiously making his way to sit on the coffee table near Tony’s head. A part of him doesn’t want to linger. Steve was the one who had suggested to Clint to give Tony space tonight. Now, however, seeing the state Tony’s in, Steve is glad he came. “You shouldn’t be drinking, Tony.” He reprimands lightly. Tony rolls his eyes.
Good?
“Wait. You’re telling me that those over protective fools are actually leaving you- an eighteen year old kid- alone in a giant tower for a few days?”
Avengers win.
Tony smiles back appreciatively, but his nerves are still high. Bruce wasn’t really the one he was worried about either.
Clint tells Tony that Steve is an amazing leader, that he trusts the captain with his life, and that he thinks the alpha is incredibly lonely.
“Fucking hell-“ Logan cursed loudly.
Tony glares fiercely up at the ceiling. “I warned you, Jay. You’re off to Goodwill next thing tomorrow morning.”
Their “three days” were up quickly.
Steve exhales loudly, “Yes. I’m sorry, Tony, but- you just act like you’ve never heard of a morning wood before!” He says, still holding back laughter.
He was tall, Steve always says. In the pictures he can see that Steve is clearly taller, but Tony’s pretty sure Steve still sees Bucky the way he saw him while growing up when he was just over 5 foot. Brown hair, blue eyes, always popular with the ladies. Tony can see why. His heart aches as he looks at the picture. He likes to think Steve is happy here, but has he ever seen Steve with that carefree look before? He hates the look Steve gets when he talks about Bucky. Sometimes it’s wistful, longing, or some kind of fond. Most of the time it’s just sad.
Logan laughs again, “And technically every since blondie two-point-oh came into the picture I’m not an Avenger.” He rolls his eyes in a Tony-like manner. “Good thing, too. Cause’ it seems to me that those Avengers fall asleep on the job.” Logan shakes his head disappointedly. “You’ve got to get your team into shape.”
Then he busted out laughing.
Okay, so yes, he knows it’s “okay to be gay” nowadays, but Steve was still skeptical. And for a while, Steve was okay with being alone in the closet. It was peaceful of sorts, and while it’s bitterly lonely in there, it’s also safe.
*******
The opposing alpha—Rumlow had called him Steve—looks unconvinced, but drops it. “Right, ah-“ He awkwardly lets his arms drop from where they were holding Tony, taking a step away from the omega, “Sorry, I just, you smelled really distressed and I-“ He cuts himself off, looking pained.
Steve knew that none of the members meant to hurt anyone, especially Tony. And damn right he wanted to know what happened to Tony- but… “It feels so wrong…” Steve muttered.
Steve gives him a soft look, wanting to reach out and grab his hand—do something that would take that look off of the teens face. “What do you mean?” He asks instead.
“I don’t know about this Steve, this isn’t right. Last time they collapsed because Hulk threw the missile into the vortex, remember?” Natasha said, sighing heavily. She held her hand to her ear, activating the communicator, “Clint, hey, you just saw all of that, right?” Natasha was silent for a moment before talking again, “Clint?”
Tony gasps and slowly slides down the wall, pressing his wristband so that the metal detaches from his hand and goes back to where is came from (hopefully).
Also, did y’all know that the fastest Rubik’s cube solver did it in 5 seconds?? Tony’s best time is around 10 (according to me) I did math for this chapter… praise me.
HAMMER INCORPERATIONS invites you to the congratulatory dinner in honor of the new joint branch: STANE INDUSTRIES
“Oh come on, you didn’t say anything that bad.” Steve says, unsuccessfully trying to cover his amusement.
“No, no, no. We all know how you succumb to the puppy eyes, Steve.” Natasha laughed, “I’ll go. I want to see my kis cica anyway.”
. As if Tony’s words had wounded him. Tony clenches his jaw. He’s hurting too, after all.
The entirety of the Avengers team was notably frustrated. They all had slept somewhat uncomfortably, each having fallen asleep waiting for Tony to return in their designated spots. Not only were they frustrated because of their sore bodies but they also had to deal with the fact that Tony was still upset with them. Tony’s emotions towards the Avengers had been on and off for a while, and they understood that it was their faults that it continued to be that way. Ever since the “Howard Incident” had happened things had been strained.
They all saw Rhodey’s glance of pure anger before he ran after Tony. Steve thought he was going to murder the entire team right then and there.
Sighing Tony waves that screen away, instead choosing to focus on what the person had said.
“Look kid, the way I see it, these people need you. You’re like their-“
Two strong arms grasped Tony at the waist, dragging him back into the darkness.
Predictably, Coulson texted back within the minute, “I’m glad you’re with a friend, but I’ll still be checking in on you later.”
Tony sighed and pushed on Steve’s chest, allowing himself to hop onto the counter. Satisfied, Steve just stepped closer, into the space between Tony’s legs. Now that they were just about eye-to-eye, Steve once again put his forehead against Tony’s, judging his reaction closely. Tony indulged himself for a moment, closing his eyes and reveling in the comfort of Steve’s warmth.
“Tony, my boy!” Obadiah calls, hitting Tony “playfully” on the shoulder once more. “How’re you enjoying this wonderful party?”
They all nod but Bruce lays a hand on Steve's shoulder, stopping him from getting up immediately. "Just give him a moment, if he
“Tony-“ Steve sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose.
“Unwanted.”
Coulson hadn’t arrived as far as Tony knew, so he sent him a quick text, “I’ve got a new babysitter, Phil, no need to come over.”

Tony groaned, “Please, can we lower the volume? Its been a day, Petey.”
“They had no right!” Tony yells.
“Do you want to tell me why the hell you thought it would be okay to go against direct orders this morning?” Steve posits, ears red and looking much more pissed than Tony had expected.
But once he registers the words, alongside the the dark, throaty growl the alpha had shot into Rumlow’s now pale face, Tony realizes.
Then he hears it. Somehow, over the constant thrum of his overactive heartbeat, over the high pitched screeching and the voice snarling in his head he can hear something
*****
Peter gave him a grin, “Planning on fighting crime with your buddies upstairs, eh Ant?” Peter started laughing uncontrollably. “Imagine that. You. Fighting!”
“You boys coming, or what?”
He finally looks to Steve, clearly the one who's opinion he's been dreading. Steve was friends with Howard, he has to have similar feelings about omegas, doesn't he? Tony's fears aren't sated by the contemplative look in Steve's eyes. Tony braces himself, truly not ready to hear his childhood hero reject him. Even worse, he can feel Clint tensing up next to him in the way that alphas do when they feel challenged and he
“Is it so wrong for me to want to reconnect with old friends?” He asks in mock confusion. Tony stays silent. Both of the men know that this isn’t a friendly meeting. Justin laughs awkwardly. “Well, um, I’m actually here to talk about a few things.”
“You didn’t want to believe that someone you trusted could have ever stooped that low. It makes sense, Steve. You don’t need to apologize.” Tony interrupts, having already gone through this conversation in his head many times.
Tony shoots him a disapproving look as he pulls on a large long sleeved shirt Steve’s never seen before. As Steve began brushing his teeth in the master bathroom attached to Tony’s room he asked in a muffled voice, “What’s black Sabbath?”

When they called the station, it had barely been three hours.
Logan just smiled fondly, “I’m gun’ go count some sheep, bud. Fifth door on the right?”
(Somewhere, Steve knew his feelings towards Tony were wrong…)
*****
don’t take any of it back.” Tony surprises himself by saying. His eyes his the floor, not wanting to see Steve’s reaction now that they aren’t in a heated shouting match.
he can’t help but return the hug, letting out a noise that can only be compared to a purr as Clint ruffles his hair affectionately. “Finally! We’ve been waiting on you Tones.” Clint says playfully. “Well, both of you, actually.” He amends, nodding towards Steve—towards Captain freaking America.
Tony weaved through the sea of people infiltrating his house. He was only slightly tipsy, but he was afraid of what would happen when Coulson came by to check on him. He was searching desperately for Peter, or any familiar face for that matter. Sure, Tony was fine with the mindless conversations he was used to having at expos and business dinners, but he certainly was not okay with the amount of people in his tower. His breath was shortening, and Tony knew he was on the brink of a full out panic attack. He was calling out hopelessly for Peter, only to be pulled back by a hand on an arm.

Tony suppresses a yelp, turning quickly and holding the torch up in his hand like a weapon as he looks around. The workshop darkens as he turns, the shadows in the room creeping inward slowly as if they had a life of their own, tendrils lashing out and covering the space he often thinks of as his safe place in complete darkness. The only light he can make out is bloody, red and blurry. His head pounds and he can feel his pulse rising, almost against his own will and his vision narrows into a red haze. “Wh-what the hell?” Tony whimpers, stumbling slightly and bracing himself against the desk as the haze begins to form into a human shape. It’s terrifying; smoky, not quite transparent but opaque enough to make out a body creeping towards him. He can’t make much out, the blood rushing in his ears sounds like a waterfall and he feels impossibly distracted.
I used to take Latin, so I just used what I knew as a sort of sorcery-language for Loki. He says some stuff here so I’ll translate as best as I can (because Google translate doesn’t do Latin very accurately.)
“Not Particularly. It’s not why he’s unconscious, that’s for sure.”

“Morning, everybody” A very pleased looking Steve waltzed into the room.
Oh no its not. You guys have keyboards for a reason! To comment! Y’all also have little mice and or scrolly pad things for a reason! To kudos and give me love <3 <3 (im lonely. Help)
Steve pulls back before any of that can happen. “So trust me, Tony, I am
Steve guffawed, “Say it Tony, I’m what?” Steve quieted comically, “What were you saying?”
“Tony, its so nice to see you.” Justin says, his million dollar fake smile present on his face.
“Steve, you cannot honestly say that you aren’t dying to know. It’s not like we’re using this for bad. We just feel that we need to know so we can better understand and love Tony, Steve. You know that.” Natasha said convincingly.
. He thrived in a dog-eat-dog world.
“Nick. You’re saying…?” Natasha steps forward and Fury nods.
“People who threaten agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.? Who? Hammer?”  Tony gaped, flabbergasted. “Why didn’t you tell me?!”
Peter had a point. Tony couldn’t keep a secret for the life of him. And Tony would want Peter to know of his plans to go save the world behind the Avengers’ back rather than the Avenger’s themselves.
Steve releases a long breath, trying to distract himself from the sting of tears at his eyes. He gives Tony a soft smile, shoving his shoulder against the younger’s lightly, “Punk.”
She narrowed her eyes at Steve when he looked her way after perching himself on the stool next to Tony, who kept his eyes in his coffee mug. Steve just smiled, giving off the annoying aura of “I know something you don’t”, and Natasha wanted to punch him in the face.
“What’s your name?” Tony finally settles on. He’s not an interrogator, he’s barely got any way of properly defending himself. He just wants to stay alive until help arrives.
The entire room looks to her and she moves to stand. Ignoring the multiple noises of weapons being drawn in her direction, she speaks to Tony directly. “Now that Pietro and I have failed, they will send
(Kind of like how Tony had needed Clint)
She made eye contact with Steve. “Clint, Tony, are you there?”
“I’m glad you’ll be our consultant then, Mr. Stark.” He says gently, and Tony tries his best to ignore Nat’s soft chuckle as his cheeks start to burn.
Well, that’s what the idiot gets for sneaking up on Tony like that. Clint is holding his nose and muttering explicatives while Tony is seething.
Tony takes a deep breath, ignoring the protectiveness that flares in Steve’s scent for a moment, “First, I want to apologize about… everything today.” Steve looks seconds away from interrupting but Tony lifts a hand. “I genuinely did forget about our conversation about me not leaving. It was a genuine mistake and it probably will happen again because I’m me. I’m mostly apologizing about what I said. It wasn’t…” Tony can’t find the words.
He couldn’t come up with anything.
“Alright, let’s tone it down, Tony. No “awesome spy stuff here”. Absolutely no guns, and you can’t handle wearing sunglasses at night yet.”
his fault that Tony is the single most attractive person he’s ever seen. Whiskey eyes framed by dark eyelashes and messy hair that curls at the ends—it’s like one of Steve’s dreams came to life. He’s
“I getcha completely, partner. Ever since I moved to this dreadful place all I see is nosy people with their fucked up nosy little noses in others people’s busy-ness. It’s annoyin’ as fuck.” Peter says lazily, not sure what he was even saying.
Around eight that night, Steve knocked on Tony’s door. “Tony?”
Peter laughs for a second before pulling Tony into a hug, “Of course I still want to be your friend, you twink.”
“But?” The voice yelled.
Clint also tells Tony a lot about Captain America. Clint didn’t really like the guy at first, which doesn’t really surprise Tony. Cap strikes Tony as the kind of guy who takes his day job very seriously, which is just about the opposite to how Clint treats it.
He’s cut off by a warning growl from Steve, “I expect you to take an order, Hawkeye.”
doesn’t want to see the man he sees as an older brother get beat up by Captain America.
And don’t get Tony wrong, it’s a
Clint nods anyway. “He never lets me talk to him about it anyway. Nothing I can really do but wait for him to come to me.” He says, shrugging.
He holds the covers tight to his face, trying to seem as cuddled up as possible, all the while hiding his injury under the covers. He quickly shucks off his tee, leaving him in just boxer briefs and socks, and he knows that Steve wouldn’t dare let anyone wake him up.
One of the board members speaks up as Tony sits, “Mr. Stark, as you know, we’ve been looking into a partnership with Mr. Stane’s organization. Ever since we moved away from weapons construction the defense market has been left with much to be desired.”
“Nice to meet you, Tony. I’m Peter Parker,” The beta responds with a laugh, shaking Tony’s hand enthusiastically.
One day. Tony thought whimsically as he watched Steve bash another lizard’s head in with his shield.
Just hours ago Wanda had agreed to return to Shield to reunite with her brother and continue answering questions. She had left the tower with another furtive glance in Tony’s direction, and the omega had immediately retreated to his room.
The beta shrugs “My first job was with this guy, Dr. Curt Connors? You might’ve heard of him. Anyway, he was really into this kind of stuff. Turns out, the guy was kinda psycho and tried to destroy Queens.” He rambles, reminding Tony an awful lot of himself. “But I really got into the whole prosthetic thing so… here I am.”
Tony balked, “What? I’ve seen the pictures Steve- give me some credit.”
Tony huffed out a small laugh, “Hi to you too, Peter. Also I’m fine, thanks for asking.”
But this time his mother’s door was locked. So Tony sighed and walked away from the door slowly. He knew not to knock.
*****
*****
Phil gestured to the door, “We have some friends here who has some information.”
The Avengers felt stupid. Coulson had warned them specifically about this exact situation and they completely undermined his words.  Bruce hadn’t been seen since he ran out earlier that day. Natasha shook her head. “It’s my fault-“ She starts before Clint interjects.
“It seems like you and I will be team-mates until that demi-god comes back into town.”
As he was walking he heard Bruce say lowly, “For the record, he’s under aged and if you ever see him here around again I suggest you tell me first thing unless you want me to get angry. You don’t want me angry”
The door that they’re standing in front of swings open abruptly, Clint Barton hurdling out of it and grabbing Tony into an embrace, nuzzling his neck like only packmates do. No matter how embarrassed Tony feels right now, no matter how much he feels like
Tony walked off, Steve hand still in his own, and if any of the Avengers found anything weird with the wrestling or them leaving together, they didn’t say anything.
The omega’s eyes finally focus in on Steve, blue locking into amber intently. The others may be talking too but there's only one voice he's hearing now.
“If this is some sort of plan to make me forgive you then- then- just don’t, okay?” Tony said, opening his eyes and pulling away from him.
Justin gives him a nod and continues, “First off, your new brand of body guards. I mean, dude- that’s what you kids say now right?” he asks, cutting himself off. Tony resists the urge to roll his eyes. He gives Hammer a passive nod and Justin continues, “-I mean, dude, you’re on a whole ‘nother level! Like that replica of that 40’s comic book character! And don’t even get me started on that green monster thing!”
to. They made me.
Tony must look just about as confused as he feels because the alpha above him looks down, concerned, “Did he hurt you? Are you alright?” He asks, voice more gentle than Tony’s ever heard from an alpha before.

showed up at the Howard Stark memorial. Nobody, not one single person aside from Clint, Nat, and Rhodey knew what they were saying sorry for. I lost my
After about an hour, Bruce was picked up from a couple cities over.
“It’s okay.” Tony says, almost as a reflex, also because he doesn’t know what else to say. “W-who is they?” He asks, voice giving away just how petrified he truly is. Steve said he’d be back soon- he said Shield was probably already in the building. His eyes shift towards the large glass doors.
“I mean… no?”
“It’s just— we dated all through high school, right? And it was
There’s nothing to gloat over. He had hoped that his father, despite the obviously horrific relationship he had with the old man, wouldn’t have stooped that low. He had wanted to believe that although Howard hated his guts, maybe there was still a semblance of a good man in his lineage. Tony presses his palms to his face, covering his burning eyes.
There was a scoff, “Well, you mister… rude… guy- I’m Peter.”
Wolf-man always mad.
“Sir, if I may, you do have a meeting scheduled in 20 minutes on the 57th floor with your board of trustees.” JARVIS intones softly, making Tony jolt out of his thoughts.
Natasha “At least put him on speaker!” Logan rolled his eyes but complied.
Steve flinches, face contorting into something a little more firm. “Howard fought against HYDRA in the war. He helped create
Tony was nervous. He bounced on his toes skittishly and twiddled his thumbs. Agent Phil Coulson, the official handler for the Avengers Initiative, gave him a judgmental glance before sending him a sympathetic nod. That wasn’t helping Tony’s nervousness.
Neither Steve nor Natasha’s glare lessens at his amusement, but apparently, Tony finds it funny.
Phil’s voice rang through the tower floor, somewhat urgently, “I think I should warn you, Tony, the Avengers are landing in New York in about 34 seconds.”
I'm currently working on something kind of similar to this so keep an eye out.
******
Many called it cowardly, some called it disappointing, but most everybody called it one of the many downfalls of having an omega in charge.
Tony sent Agent Coulson another look, pleading. When Phil didn’t respond, Tony finally broke, “How are you not freaking out, man?! We’re about to meet The Bruce Banner, the Black Widow, the Hawkeye, and holy moley, Phil, we’re going to meet THE Captain America!” Tony was basically screaming by then, finally succumbing to his excitement and nerves that had been eating away at him all day.
Hours after Peter left, Tony was alone in the kitchen, redressing his wound when JARVIS notified him, “Sir, there’s an incoming call from Phil Coulson.”
“Why are you acting like this? I literally just went to a board meeting. You should be happy! If I don’t go to those, then I could get pushed out as CEO and you
“…The police are coming?” Tony asked, his eyes narrowing in panic and confusion.
He’s not here.
His day has been long, anyway. Even after completely embarrassing himself in front of his childhood hero, Tony spent most of the rest of the day learning more about the avenger’s initiative and their day-to-day life. AKA he learned a lot about the improvements he was going to need to make to the gym area. Apparently the world’s mightiest heroes take their training very seriously. He also learns that one member of the team is currently off-world. It’s a bummer, because Tony had been really looking forward to meeting an alien, but Clint assures him that Thor will be back as soon as he takes care of Loki’s trial in Asgard.
There was a sigh of frustration, “I don’t know, Steve. I have a good pulse, but his BP is unnaturally low.”
“Um… am I supposed to know what this is about?” Tony asks dumbly.
Tony smiles, small, almost embarrassed. “Kind of tired of embarrassing myself in front of you, to be honest.” He laughs self-deprecatingly.
The Avengers raised their eyebrows, Steve and Bruce were both gaping, and Natasha and Clint were both surprised Tony was being so rude.
Tony looked like he was going to pass out. Hell, Tony felt like he was going to pass out. Did Captain America just tell him that he could call him Steve? Is that what happened? Is Tony still alive? Tony was about to pinch himself to make sure he wasn’t dreaming when another face entered the large conference room.
He vaguely noticed the shouting coming from outside.
Tony giggled. He liked their bromance.
Reviews make the sun shine (unless youre like me and love rain, in which case it makes it rain harder) and kudos, favorites, bookmarks , etc they just make me want to werk it all over (and I cant twerk so its // funny)
“Perfect. Let’s go to the top, baby boy.” Tony says, leaning back against the cold wall of the elevator, suddenly feeling exhausted.
“Nope!” Tony yelled immaturely. “Talk to me when you realize I’m right!” Tony said, trying to get past Steve’s large frame.
Obadiah Stane hadn’t changed one bit since the last time Tony saw him at his father’s funeral. He’s still
“You failed!” The deep, worn voice growled. “The boy lives and each of the Avengers are still up and fighting!”
Tony doesn’t like being underwater.
Conversations are had and realizations are made.
Tony opens his mouth, looking ready to deny everything but JARVIS beats him to the punch. “There are indeed doctors on call on the 40th floor, Captain Rogers.”
“I told you about the Halloween costumes!” Tony argues, covering his face with his hands as he feels himself getting flustered.
The Avengers all shared looks of disbelief. Maria Stark did what?
The anonymous man laughs heartily. “In a way. I knew you when you were just a little one. Your father and I were good friends. We briefly met at the funeral.”
Tony heard the voices speaking around him, but he just chose to ignore them. At least until the warmth that was surrounding him suddenly left. He let out an unhappy moan and clutched the couch tighter, missing the warmth.
“Just-fucking hell man, let him go.” His old apprentice, the archer says.
, Steve!” Tony shouts, shoving his hands against Steve’s huge frame and Steve allows it, taking several steps back. Both of their chests are heaving and for a second, Tony feels like he may have gone too far. He opens his mouth, ready to apologize immediately.
He said- he said I have a choice to make and that he was warning me. Oh my god. He’s going to come back what if he comes back?” Tony asks, now opting to dig his nails into his own arms, grounding himself as best he can. He can’t even tell if he’s in a dream or not anymore. Steve is gripping his arms, trying to keep Tony from hurting himself but Tony is scared in a way he hasn't been in a
Tony all but flees out the door, wanting nothing more than to go back to his tower and bury himself in work for the next 36 hours and
There’s no way he’d be able to comfort Tony right now. The younger still can’t even get over the fact that he really just went and rambled on and on about how nervous he was to meet his idol to his actual freakin’ idol. Not only that but Captain America was
“I have no doubt in that, Tony.” Coulson soothed. “But once the Avengers catch wind that I gave you a mission and it resulted in your injury, my life could very easily end.”
“Maybe. That’s why it’s very important that we get Bruce back.” Natasha said soothingly.
“Tony?” Steve called quietly through the door of Tony’s bedroom. Not awaiting the response he knew wouldn’t come, he quickly said, “The team has some, ah- business in Chicago. So, we don’t know when we’ll be back, but um…” Steve sighed, leaning his entire body against the doorframe. “I’ll miss you- we all will.” He moved his ear to the door and he could swear that he could hear Tony’s shallow breaths on the other side. “Coulson will be along shortly to bab- just to be here, make sure you’re alright, okay?”
Tony and Steve agreed solemnly.
“Clint.” Tony hisses as he shoves his supposed friend harshly. “There was no cardboard cutout.” He offers lamely, still not brave enough to meet Captain freaking America’s stupid, beautiful blue eyes.
Tony reared back at that. “Interesting? Like the good kind? Or the bad? Is this you throwing shade right now? Because honestly, people say that to me al-” Tony was cut off by the sounds of the doors in the tower slamming open and shouts echoing through the halls. He winced.
To Steve’s (and everyone else’s) surprise, the hand belonged to Bruce.
Wanda give the alpha a dark look, “I cannot make you believe me, but you would be fools not to. HYDRA wants to control Stark in the same way they controlled the last merchant of death. They will do whatever is necessary to have their weapons back.”
He had seethed, “None of you will be hacking into anything that has to do with Tony Stark. It’s none of your business. If your lucky, maybe one day he’ll feel comfortable enough to tell you about his past on his own. If you do this and he figures out you invaded his privacy so blatantly… he’ll never forgive you. And I know none of you want that.”
Tony doesn’t respond for a long time, seeming thoughtful from his place resting Steve, chin hooked over Steve’s shoulder. It’s not the most convenient position for either of them, Tony’s legs are half tucked under him, half wrapped around Steve and Steve’s arm is slowly falling asleep from where he’s currently holding himself up against the couch.
“Who the fuck are those people, Tony?”
, let alone another alpha.
“Is Clint still your only pack bond?” Steve asks, ignoring his own thoughts and going back to his original question. It’s a lot more common these days, for people to have very small packs. Back in the 40s, he and Bucky were the only pack of 2 in their whole neighborhood.
Crumpled.
“Mister Anthony? The man named Jarvis called out.
That had people on their feet in mere milliseconds. There were muffled whispers of, “shit, where’s my left shoe?” and “well at least we got to meet Tony Stark, talk about jailbait!” and other giggles and groans from drunks passing by on their way out.
Steve feels like killing Howard Stark.
Well, that could only be one person.
Tony had no idea how much weight he had been pressing against the doors because as soon as they open he’s all but diving into the confined space. Honestly, he probably would have ended up with a concussion if it weren’t for the frankly massive arms that caught him before he hit the floor. The elevator smells good, nothing like the sweaty, testosterone-driven Rumlow  and the sudden change in atmosphere nearly makes Tony whimper with relief.
******
as he hears Tony’s terrified voice once more. Steve and Clint glance at each other as the distinctly female voice crackles over the speakers. The voice is completely unrecognizable. There’s a heavy accent, but Steve can understand how Tony was confused seeing as the voice sounded layered, as though several people were speaking at once.
“Which, by the way, I’m a little bitter I didn’t get to see you two meeting. What did your face look like Tony? Did he say anything embarrassing? I bet he did. Did he tell you about the cardboard cutout?”
“What’s that look for?” Tony asks, blushing again. He curses himself. Why can’t he keep his cool around this man? Oh maybe because he’s literally perfect in every single way and you’ve been in love with him ever sense you were five even though Howard told you-
Steve groans silently. He’s never acted like this in a relationship. Not that he and Tony are in a relationship… because they’re not. Steve doesn’t even want that. At least, he shouldn’t.
“No it’s my fault, too, Nat-“
look bad on you, Steve.” He sighs, flopping back dramatically.
He nods when it’s polite and tries his best not to fall asleep as people bring out their PowerPoints about budget cuts or marketing plans or whatever this particular meeting is about.
“Okay, but it’s kind of a long story.” Tony said in a low voice.
Like he said, for the most part.
The room fell back into a somewhat comfortable silence, Bruce casually brushing his hand against Natasha, Clint glowering off in the corner, and Tony inhaling the coffee like it was oxygen.
"A shield agent will escort you there and back. We'll get an agent that the team knows and trusts so they will be more at ease. Tell them you're going for business purposes only. You're dreading the event because you
He takes a deep breath and raises his hand to knock when the door opens.
“Consider the operation a failure, Tony.” A new voice interjects, nearly scaring Tony to death.
After getting a ton of comments of people saying that they would like a re-write I decided that I'd actually go through with it! There are already several universe changes that I've made with the story but for the most part, the plot is going to be VERY similar and the character development will stay the same. I hope you all enjoy and thank you so much for the encouragement to get back into writing
There weren’t any objections.
Logan’s face scrunched up, “see your what?”
“Ladies, please. There are much more pressing matters at hand.” A male voice spoke for the first time. There was a crisp tone to it, and it reminded Steve of the voice that Tony was working on for his new system.
Tony tilts his head and stares up at Steve.
But Tony had already slammed the door in his face.
Steve sighed, standing from his crouch on the ground shakily, “Logan’s right. All that’s important now is that we find Tony.”
This time Tony complains, “That’s definitely not necessary, Cap. Look at me, I’m fine.” He stands straight and raises his arms, rotating around as if to show him he’s not injured.
“Family name.” Tony deadpans. “You can call me Tony.” He says, watching as the sun started setting outside the bar.
Reviews are my crack, so please, please feed my addiction (the more reviews, the faster I write!)
Beside Tony, Clint shifts uncomfortably, his eyes hard and challenging as he looks to Fury, “That’s a lot to ask.”
. “You’ll… you’ll protect me?” He asks, voice small and disbelieving. In the back of his head he can already
Tony didn’t respond for another long pause. There was a rustle on the phone and Peter’s voice came back, not nearly as tipsy as it sounded when he had called. “We’re at the bar on ninth, right next to Tompkins Square.”
Peter nods solemnly, “Yeah.” He says shortly.
He pressed the button and almost immediately the doors slid open, allowing Peter to enter and quickly press the button labeled “Workshop”, and quickly pressing his thumb onto the glowing blue pad that appeared with it. Tony had made that possible the first time Peter went into the workshop. For a kid with trust issues, Ant began trusting Peter pretty early on.
“Do you think that’s how Jarvis feels about me?” Tony’s voice is small, and for not the first time in this conversation Steve is reminded just how
Steve’s breath left him in an instant. He opened his mouth to say something- anything- that would justify what they did.
“Steve! Cut it out!” Tony huffed, still trying to pull out of Steve’s grip. After a few moments, Steve had calmed down and he let out a breath, smile still high on his face. “You done?” Tony questioned skeptically, eyebrow raised.
Tony sits up from his bed. It’s too cold and too big. He doesn’t allow himself to think as he pads down the hallway and turns a couple of corners.
Also look we can shave the beard if we really don’t like it but bearded steve is criminally underrated in fanfiction we need more of him.
Logan sighed, his stance loosening and his eyes flickering to the ground. “I’m sorry, Tony, I didn’t mean to-“ Tony cut Logan off with wide eyes.
“Little kitten.” Clint translated, picking a hair off of one of his arrows.
Tony scowls deeply, trying his best to ignore his AI’s suggestive tone.
SO LISTEN TO BE BECAUSE THIS IS IMPORTANT: THERE WAS SOME CONFUSION ABOUT WHEN THIS TAKES PLACE. THIS IS AFTER THE AVENGERS (movie) THE DIFFERENCE IS, TONY AND THOR WEREN’T THERE YET (that’s why all of the other avengers knew each other from the beginning) LOKI ESCAPED ATTACKED, YADAYADA. LOKI’S CREEPY AND ALL THAT JAZZ. OH, AND HE’S STILL PISSED AT EVERYONE BECAUSE DAMN IT HE JUST WANTED TO RULE THE WORLD.
“Clint, we don’t even know who did this.”
WITH THAT BEING SAID there is going to be a little bit of out of character behavior from everyone because its fanfiction and that's how it be sometimes. I hope that the people who read Please Dont Believe me are happy to see it back, even if it's in a different form. If you don't like the changes I made, please just keep it to yourself and feel free to not read this version! The old story is still up and though it's unfinished, it will always be up. Like i said before, there are different elements in this story but for the most part the plot is going to be EXTREMELY similar.

made a fool of yourself?”
And each time he’s blaming himself.
Steve opened his eyes and they immediately rolled at the stupidity of his entire team. Yes, he realized that his position with Tony was… not normal, but they all knew about Tony’s sleeping problems, and if that’s what it took to make the kid sleep, then so be it.
Cica- Kitten
“More like shattered.” Tony replied grimly, kicking a cup over so he could rest his feet on the coffee table. “Everyone can see it, and believe me, no one likes it.”
“Correction, sir. I said that every Avenger was asleep.” JARVIS’ crisp voice interjects.
“…CAN I JUST SAY THAT I FUCKING CALLED THIS ONE?”
how much this means to me.” Tony can feel his voice raising but he can’t believe Steve is freaking out over such a small thing.
“Jay, you’re sure you let Steve know that I’m going to a meeting right?” Tony repeats later the next morning, mind in fifty different places as he tries to remember what this meeting is about. “Wouldn’t want a repeat of last time’s freak out.”

Tony replied hesitantly. “Yeah? I guess?”
to push, and he definitely doesn’t want to make Tony upset. But it just doesn’t make sense to Steve. It’s almost unheard of, parents not having pack bonds with their children?
The alpha goes to lay Tony down, gently putting him down on the couch. Steve startles, only slightly, as a whimper leaves Tony’s mouth and a hand grips his t-shirt tightly as he tries to pull away.
Tony pushes away from his desk, dropping his head and groaning. He has to tell someone, and it seems like his mind is already made up on who he wants to tell. He just doesn’t know how.
—almost as tall as Steve, with a neat beard and perfectly tailored suit.
Height: 5 feet, 9 inches
Peter laughed and leaned towards Tony and quietly saying, “Na, Ant, but it got people to haul ass, huh?”
Tony jumped into his bed smiled as he listened to Steve groan in frustration from outside.
“He was there too. In the car.” Tony murmurs, voice watery and shaking. “He was driving and
Tony’s breathing picked up along with his heart rate. “No, Steve, I can’t! I’m an Insomniac! And I have PTSD and I can’t fall asleep and even when I can I just have nightmares and they freaking hurt i mean how can nightmares be so freaking real?! I don’t get it, St-“
-And he see’s Steve’s eyes and everything just goes boom.
Steve snarled, “Why would I be jealous when he’s already mine?” He smirked at the confused look on Peter’s face. “I don’t need to explain anything to you, cowboy.” Steve drops the boy to the floor abruptly, quickly barking, “Just believe me when I say that the second you hurt Tony is the second you die.” before clicking the “HALT” button off and exiting the elevator.
Meeting Doctor Banner had reminded him of something he had learned a long time ago back when he was at MIT. If the polarity between isotopes wouldn’t create the amount of energy he needed for the energy that the reactor would require, then maybe
proud. I don't want to be the CEO of his war-loving company.” Tony spits the words like venom, sitting straight and tense, no longer crying, just empty. He deflates slightly, “I just want Jarvis back.”
Tony dwindles in Peter’s lab for a few hours before heading back up to the penthouse. It’s clear the guy really has a knack for what he’s doing, and Tony’s glad to have people working in his company who actually care about what they’re working on. They don’t talk much more about personal stuff, but Peter puts his number into Tony’s phone before the omega leaves.
“It’s okay, I know you didn’t. It’s okay.” Tony sputtered.
The room is deathly silent now, everyone looking at Tony and Steve with different emotions flickering in their eyes.
“Stark, now is really not the time.” Fury says, sounding incredibly tired so Tony decides not to push his luck. He also tries not to look Steve in the eyes because if he does, he might drown in his embarrassment. Either that, or drown in Steve’s eyes. Neither of which were ideal options give the current situation.
Peter picked up on the second ring with a, “Holy shit, dude, I just saw the news! What the hell was that??”
The next day was difficult on everyone. Tony slept almost the entire day, sedated for half of it. Steve never left his side, sometimes sleeping, sometimes reading, but never leaving Tony other than to do the necessities. And yes, every time he left the 5-foot range around Tony, Tony would make terrible noises until he returned.
The handshake goes on for a bit too long, Steve staring at Tony inquisitively. Tony really doesn’t mind. The more that Steve stares at
Peter’s breath hitches at Tony’s heartbreaking words. “No, Tony, you misunderstood me. That’s so badass. Tony you kicked bad guy ass and saved, not only yourself, but that pretentious, rude woman as well. I mean really, if she had just listened to her superior and trusted you, you’d have that flash drive by now. I just don’t under why-“
You could still only see the feet of other people, but the two different female voices were distinct.
“Ha! As if. No one is
“Tony,” Steve starts, hands shoved into his pajama pant's pockets and
The next day, Tony was in his room studying when he heard several screams ring throughout his house. He was getting up to investigate when his bedroom door was swung open so fast it made a large hole the wall that it slammed into.
Clint has also learned other things. Tony Stark doesn’t like loud noises, he doesn’t like being left behind, he doesn’t like being vulnerable or called short, and he really doesn’t like Howard Stark.
Tony woke up from a dreamless sleep peacefully, the sun flittering through the semi-closed curtains gracefully. Tony took a moment to appreciate the warmth that was completely surrounding him. It was almost peaceful.
Steve didn’t say anything, he just held onto the sleeping boy tighter and walked away.
“Peter…” Tony trailed off uncomfortably.
“Is he alright?”
“That’s good thing, right?” Peter asks, confused.
how embarrassed he’s going to feel later on. But right now he's running on pure instinct, his true nature completely taking over. He’s a terrified, distressed omega, seeking any kind of comfort from an alpha he doesn’t know well, but one that has already protected him once before and one that his packmates trust with their lives.
Tony fell out of the bed abruptly. “Um-“ He stuttered looking wide-eyed at a confused Steve.
Tony almost feels like he owes Obie. This is how he can thank him for looking out for him.
Something in his voice must’ve concerned Peter because the next thing Tony knows, Peter is literally picking him up (surprisingly gently) and laying down with Tony on the couch. Now with Tony’s head now against Peters shoulder, he began to feel more comfortable and a lot less lonely then before. “If I tell you the truth, I’ll have to kill you.”
“Absolutely.” She said, looping her arm underneath his.
The tension in the room slipped, Clint guffawing on the ground, Natasha, Steve, and eventually Bruce fell into laughter while Tony pouted.
Tony glares at him. “I’m not a kitten.” He knocks James’ hand off his head and tries to take a step forward.
So intently, that he just missed Justin’s eyes flickering to an alarming shade of blue before returning almost immediately back to the normal color.
Not sure if this is my best work :P i hope it isn't too confusing. Keep in mind that it's 3:42 right now and i wrote 80% of this chapter within the past 3 hours :) bleh okay love you guys please comment its like drugs to me <3 luh ya cuties
“Let me speak to Tony.” Logan demanded.
Tony didn’t think she meant it.
Tony looks rebellious for a moment, clearly not happy with the situation. One look at Steve, though, and he’s done, nodding his head unhappily. “Understood.”
A bitter laugh sounded from Cadet Rhodes, “Right, well, I can go ahead and tell you that when Tony doesn’t want to be found, he won’t be found. As you know now he sort of has experience in trying to hide from jerks.
Natasha blinked at the doctor’s quick departure. It looked like her curiosity would continue.
Well, Steve did make it clear that he wanted Tony. And no, Tony should not forgive his friends so easily about betraying him, but Steve was just so- Steve.
“What do we do now?” Tony asked timidly, moving so that his head was just brushing against Steve’s shoulder.
Then another body fell onto the bed with them.
Tony almost missed the look the bartender (S.H.I.E.L.D agent) threw the waiter (another S.H.I.E.L.D. agent?). Tony watched in his peripheral vision, walking away slowly from the spot Obadiah saw him as the waiter “accidentally” spilled a drink on Obadiah, taking the business man’s attention away from Tony. Tony mingled his way to the farthest place away from Obadiah, in yet another group of drunk men who knew Tony (though Tony had no clue of their names), just hoping the informant would be able to find him.
also why do i keep making myself miss bucky so much its rlly not good for my story telling heart
“Blood Pressure, Clint.”
Nat and Bruce leave the workshop first, and Clint follows soon after another crushing hug.
“You didn’t mean to what, Logan?” Natasha inquired, leaning towards him.
Ванда - Wanda
Tony’s eyes were set on Steve’s mouth and his head was pushing against Steve’s forehead lightly. Steve smiled genuinely to himself as he brushed their noses together lightly in a slight Eskimo kiss before pressing his lips against Tony’s own. Tony sighed happily as he let Steve take control of the kiss. Steve went straight to business pulling Tony fully on top of him, forcing Tony into a straddle position as Steve continued to domineer his tongue into the younger mans mouth. Tony whimpered as Steve grabbed his ass roughly.
Tony liked Steve
Once, finally, it did get better, Tony’s cheek was pressed against the cold seat of the toilet bowl. He was still moaning unhappily at the shakiness of his body, but he was pretty sure he had gotten all of the grossness out of his system. “God.” He whimpers sadly.
“What?!” He asked, a little too eagerly.
Tony wants to bat it away.
Obie looks pleased, sitting back down at the table and gesturing for Tony to do the same.
Clint laughs, clapping Tony on the shoulder a bit too hard, “Sure thing, Cap. Tones, meet at the lobby, kay? We can head to the tower together.” He calls over his shoulder, not even giving Steve a second look. It goes to show just how much he must trust Steve, because Tony can’t remember the last time Clint left Tony on his own with
Anthony Edward Stark
Peter lets a giggle escape, “Making love. Right. So you guys aren’t dating?” He asks, already knowing the answer.
Obadiah Stane did indeed walk in, an older, but very pretty red head on his arm. Her own eyes were sharp and focused on the bar area, searching the entire area until her eyes landed on Tony. Tony put on his cocky billionaire façade and tipped his head slightly at her, as if he was beckoning her over.
The black haired man looked at Tony slowly. “Tony Stark, I presume?” He asked, his voice not sounding nearly as sinister as he looked.
Steve stalks away at that and Tony’s stunned into silence.
The good captain had decided to join him. Steve narrowed his eyes at Peter, not taking his eyes off of the man as he pressed the red “HALT” button next to the closed doors. Within milliseconds Peter was shoved up against the back of the elevator.
“Hulk, we need Bruce back.” Clint tried for the third time.
Steve looks between the omega still hovering in his arms and the mutant across the room. “Howard actually was a part of this?”
Peter shrugged his shoulders to himself as he strode towards the elevator.
Tony liked hugs.
Tony gave Peter a kicked puppy look and Peter just about melted. “Geez Ant, I didn’t mean it like that I just didn’t expect it.” He said, his southern accent thickening.
JARVIS’ responds immediately, “The Captain is currently in the kitchen, Sir.”
The woman on the other side of the room doesn’t look angry or scary the way she did the last time Tony saw her. She looks
“He’s done now, Maria.” Clint says darkly.
Tony didn’t say anything, letting Peter have his laugh. Peter noticed his silence quickly and straightened his facial expression. “I’m sorry, Tony.” He said softly after a moment.
“Your life?” Natasha asked, raising her eyebrow.
“Wanda confirmed my belief that she is—was? Working with HYDRA.” He says as plainly as possible. He didn’t have any other information to give, anyway.
To his surprise, and complete delight, Steve laughs heartily at that. Most agents tense up whenever Tony makes fun of Fury, so it’s nice that someone finally understands just how ridiculous it is that they’re all living in a real life spy movie. “That sounds like something he’d do.” Steve agrees.
Peter had an inkling of who it could be.
ALSO, *plot thickens*
the super-soldier who he had just inadvertently admitted his love to in an elevator of all places.
The room has filled with a high pitched ringing, as if a bomb had just gone off and his ears don’t work properly anymore. He wants to search the room again, look for any kind of light, for Dum-E’s familiar presence or even check to see if he can bolt to the door but he can’t because he’s paralyzed in fear staring at the form in front of him that’s gradually becoming more clear.
“Then just what are you doing, Steve?” Tony asked, his voice just above a whisper.
“Never send a demigod to do a man’s work.” He muttered, as the scepter started glowing again and he disappeared from the prison without a trace.
Ten minutes after that, Tony’s starting to actually fall asleep when he hears the tower door swing open. He winces at the smash it makes, but quickly controls his facial features, and acts as asleep as he possibly can. He vaguely hears JARVIS inform the Avengers that he is in bed asleep. He then hears the Avengers, each and every one, clump down the hall somewhat dejectedly.
Steve is silent for a moment and Tony looks over to see what seems to be a smug smile on his face. “What?” Tony asks, confused, just before the elevator beeps loudly.
“This is the only way, Steve. You know that.”
Steve bit back a whimper of his own, and rubbed his cheek against Tony’s hair, “It’s over now, and I swear that it will never happen again.”
again, like Tony’s a complete enigma to him. He has that small smile on his face that makes Tony want to do whatever it is that he’s doing right now forever. Because if he can make Steve smile like that, he must be doing something right. Tony feels hot under all of the attention. It isn’t like how other alphas look at him; like he’s just a body made for their use. Steve looks at him like he’d like nothing more than to understand him. Like he wants to know
There was a rustling sound behind the door, but other than that the room seemed completely silent.
Steve, despite his claim a few nights ago that he usually has trouble sleeping, is out like a light.
Thanks for all of the amazing support!
and moves to sit next to Tony, who’s already pulling the video up.
Nick responded immediately, “Yes, you wait until you need to save the world. And until then, you train. Here. At Stark’s house, which is where the Avengers Initiative base will be held.”
When Tony finally connects the dots he tells Jarvis to blackout the workshop, a protocol he had installed just hours before.
“Look, Bruce I appreciate the effort, but I’m fine, okay? Loosing a little sleep won’t kill me.” Tony said, obviously annoyed. His usually bright and happy aura was hanging by a thread, so Bruce backed off.
Oh god oh god.
Yeah, Tony was positive this was a dream now.
“Geez, you give a kid all of the love and affection in the world and this is how he repays me? Slandering my suit and assaulting me. The youth these days.” Clint mutters, rubbing his side as if Tony had stabbed him.
“What do you want?” Tony spat out and Logan reared back at his coldness.
Tony: This is my friend Wanda she tried to kill me a few days ago but she is Actually Really Cool :)
*****
loved Bucky. But the things they would say to me…” Steve shakes his head, lip curling slightly,
Well, actually, it seems like Tony actually
Coulson gave him an amused grin, “Do you even have to ask that, Tony? We keep tabs on any and everyone, especially people who threaten agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.”
“I… I don’t like being underwater.” Tony said tiredly, before the 19 year old collapsed entirely into Captain America’s arms.
In fact, the only thing that really comes up is a bunch of anti-cigarette advertisements which, while very important, are not helping Tony’s dilemma.
In Steve’s arms, an audible inhale escaped Tony, but his eyes didn’t even flutter. His breathing started to even out and finally, his body relaxed in Steve’s arms.
“Peter.” Tony moans sadly. “I want them out. Too many! Too many!” He says hyperventilating.
But Tony was on a roll and during the meeting he had somewhat of a breakthrough.
He’s jolted out of his work by a phone call from Steve. Tony furrows his eyebrows, because it’s only been an hour or so since the Avengers left.
Tony stares at the picture next to Steve’s bed. It’s old, clearly taken from before Steve went into the ice. The picture had Steve, smiling as big as Tony had ever seen him, stuck in the headlock of another man who was smiling just as wide. Of course Tony knew who it was. Even if he hadn’t grown up with pictures of the Howling Commandoes covering the walls of his house, Steve had described Bucky Barnes many times.
Wanda spends another moment eyeing Natasha before turning towards the team. “
“Well, yeah, Rock of Ages, we all have family issues.” Tony replied, trying to diffuse the situation as quickly as possible.
Phil’s mouth shut closed and he gave the doctor a curt nod. “Fine.”
Steve could see Tony’s hands shaking. Steve didn’t feel bad for questioning Logan, but at least now he understood were the mutant was coming from. Steve grabbed Tony’s quaking hands and gave him a smile. “You should really get some sleep, Tony.” Steve offered, trying to calm him down.
“You know what, no. I’m actually not feeling well at all. I think I’m-“ fake cough “- coming down with something.” Tony gave him a pitiful look. “I better go. Congrats on the Industry!” he called back, walking to the exit quickly, trying to ignore the stare that he knew was following him.
Steve leers at Tony playfully, “Doesn’t sound all that bad to me,” grinning in success as a flush spreads up Tony’s neck.
“Careful there, soldier, I might just take you up on it.” Tony throws back and Steve chuckles, unwillingly leaning forward as if he’s being sucked into the omega’s gravitational pull. He’s surprised, because he thought Erkinstein said he wasn’t ever going to be able to get drunk. Right now, looking at Tony’s sleepy, smiling face, he definitely feels tipsy.
“No, no, no, you don’t understand. He didn’t have his voice but it was
.” A snide, rough voice calls from behind Tony.
“I take pride in those Centimeters, small stuff.” Clint smirks.
Also I just want to make it explicit that I have absolutely 0 experience kissing and sexual activities and such. Everything I have here is based off of the tons of slash smut I read daily so… I hope its not too awfully awkward… ha…ha…
Bruce put a hand on Steve’s shoulder, “Neither do we. Albany’s three hours away-“
Rhodey glared at Steve, “Don’t call him stupid. You guys are the reason he’s run away in the first place.” Then Rhodey sighs, “He does have a fake ID, but he’s never used it as far as I know.”
“They’re supposed to be.” Clint responded.
“Um no, it’s totally fine, thank you.” Tony says, shifting awkwardly. “I’m Tony, by the way.”
Clint and Natasha instantly voice their support, but they weren’t really the ones he was worried about. He’s been making their tech since he was seventeen.
Tony wakes up the next day with only one black eye, a bruised jaw and 2 bruised ribs.
“No one would dare to threaten you, if you were mine, because I would
“I should go tell him that we’re lea-“ Steve got up to go say goodbye to Tony.
The man barely said six words and Rumlow is literally shaking in his boots, backing off instantly and shaking his head. “We were just messing around, Steve. No big deal. You know how omegas are.” Rumlow laughs shakily and all but runs off as the doors begin to close. “See you in training!”
Tony’s eyes shifted, trying to find a way out. After pushing against Steve’s arms, as if to test their strength. “About what?” He asked quietly. “The party?”
A pang went through Steve’s heart. “Tony please just listen to us!”
*****
“Is he waking up?”
America.
Tony turns towards Peter quickly, “They should already be over it- whatever IT is! You didn’t even do anything wrong! They’re just jealous, overprotective FREAKS who don’t understand that I can have other friends! GOODNESS GRACIOUS.” He yells, clutching his hair in his hands tightly.
*****
“Tony… you were attacked. Or something. Jarvis went down in the workshop levels and hasn’t been able to retrieve any footage yet. We didn’t see anything but you were… pretty shaken when we finally got to you.” Steve explains as lightly as he can.
Then they had the distinct pleasure of being woken up by the familiar sound of the “Avengers Assemble” alarm.
Tony startles at the young voice that casually called out. His head swivels quickly to meet the eyes of one of SI’s engineers. He looks younger than most of the workers at the company, probably still a little older than Tony, but still young.
“Alright… so, what? We just sit around until the world needs us? What do we do till then?” Clint asked, obviously skeptical.
The GOOD NEWS is that you guys can let me know what parts of the old story you’d like to see come back and/or give me ideas on how to make this story better than the last. I love hearing your ideas and comments really help me work faster ;)
He thanked Happy and got into the elevator, which quickly made its assent up to the main floor. He dully responded to Jarvis as he was greeted upon walking in the door. He took minimal notice to the heaps of bags near the rooms specifically made for each Avenger and made his way down to his workshop.
Steve immediately feels guilty. If he costs Tony one of his only friends, he’ll never forgive him.
Steve resisted the urge to grab him and not let him go until all the dangers of the world disappeared.
“We aren’t the ones that you need to worry about.” The girl says softly and the room quiets even further.
in jealousy over all of the betas in his class.
Steve’s amused, somewhat pleased expression falls at that. “You don’t remember?” He asks, concerned.
The room was silent once more.
Clint mimics the head ruffle, a lot less gently, before kissing him on the head obnoxiously and skipping into the cockpit. Steve goes last, Shield holstered on his back and cowl abandoned. Steve’s hand runs down Tony’s arm before gripping him at the waist and pulling him in for a hug.
Tony looks up, annoyed at how far he has to tilt his head to meet Steve’s eyes. Steve looks concerned, confused and
That leaves Steve looking at Tony with a small grin on his face, tilting his head.
Tony rears back. “What?”
Tony had absolutely no idea who these people were, but he might as well act like he did. “I’m legal and rich, boys, that’s all that matters.” He said, grinning as they agreed with laughs. Laying low shouldn’t be too hard when you’re surrounded by tons of groups of loud, drunken men surrounding the bars while the more sophisticated of the members danced with their dates.
Tony mentally groaned.
Once Bruce was back and dressed, he kneeled over Tony steadily. “I’m not much of a doctor, Steve. I think you should take him to a real bed and we get a real doctor from S.H.I.E.L.D to check him out.”
Later that same day, Phil Coulson came to check up on the team.
“Okay. Good. I miss you.” Tony says into the blue tooth quietly. “Just come down to the workshop and avoid the team…. You know how they get.”
Steve shakes his head once more, this time a stubborn look on his face. “Look, Tony, I know you and Howard didn’t get along, but to accuse him of
“Can you not go to one function- just one- without embarrassing me to death?” Howard screamed in Tony’s face, gripping his throat in an alarming manner.
Natasha sighed more heavily this time. “You’re right.” She groaned again, “But that Peter guy hasn’t been that great of a person to Tony lately either. He’s the one who pressured him into that party!”
For a second, Tony's confused. Wondering what ulterior motives this question could have. For a second he nearly takes offense, wondering if Steve is questioning his abilities but then he meets Steve's eyes. And of course.
Just as the doors began to close, a muscled arm stopped them from closing.
*******
Tony makes a face, unsure if he’s allowed to talk about exactly what his meeting is about. “Honestly, I’m scared to tell you because there’s a good chance if I accidentally tell you something confidential, Fury will have this elevator plummeting to the bottom floor in seconds. Then he’ll probably explode the whole building, just to make sure there were no survivors.” Tony says, completely serious.
Birdman looked unhappy.
Processing…
Kicsi- Little one
Once they were in the car Coulson turned to look at Tony and Pepper, “The second we step into medical at base, you are telling me what the fucking hell all that was.”
Tony was leaning against the counter, his hair ruffled by a rough night’s sleep. Thinking about it, just about every night he slept was a rough night. Either he couldn’t fall asleep, or nightmares riddled his dreams.
not his fault.
******
Steve felt the resistance and tension in Tony’s body fade away, and finally, Tony grabbed back and dug his nails into Steve’s shoulder blades (which really would’ve hurt if Steve didn’t have the serum). They stood like that for a while. “Tony, are you alright now?” He asked timidly.
“You got it, dude.” Tony grinned.
“You were hiding in the air vents?” Tony asked, still in the protective hold Steve had barricaded him into when the “intruder” fell into Tony’s room, between his legs. Steve’s arms tightened around Tony’s middle, “That’s freaking… Clint, that’s not okay.”
excited to visit the advanced prosthetic lab. Everyone thinks it’s boring.”
Steve resisted the urge to hug him. “No, about the other day.”
Clint’s mouth hangs open with shock, “What? You can’t expect me to see absolute tru-“
“Wow.” Peter exhales. “You’ve really been holding a lot in, Ant.” He says, sitting down in the chair next to Tony and putting his hand on his back reassuringly.
an omega, so…” Tony trails off, making a point to look up at Steve, pointing out their very poignant height difference. He expects Steve to laugh or to ruffle his hair. He expects something like what Clint would do, maybe make a joke about how short Tony is or call him adorable.
Right?
dread these kind of events. Remember, Tony. Act. Natural."
Coulson shoots him a look, “Right, you usually go for the tall, blonde alphas wearing red, white and blue.”
JARVIS answers, “Sir has been in his lab for approximately 12 hours.”
“Logan!”
“Holy cow!” Tony screeches, noticing his position exactly, and falling backwards, hitting the carpet with a soft thump, blushing furiously.
Tony’s nodding before he can even finish his sentence.
“So? Are you going to tell me what that look was all about back there?”
“Tony!-“ Clint begins complaining but Tony stops him.
“I don’t know if I’d say friends…” Logan said, and Steve was about to snap at him for being rude, but Tony replied.
Cue Steve falling into another fit of laughter.
Steve.
IMPORTANT: Natasha uses a few Hungarian words in the chapter so I’ll just go ahead and translate in case I forget to down below.
Steve doesn’t hear much from Tony for the rest of the day. When Steve asks after him, JARVIS assures him that the doctors cleared Tony after a quick checkup and that he’s been trying to get the footage from the workshop for the past few hours.
Tony has no idea what Fury is thinking letting a nineteen year old omega meet
Clint steps forward, eyes worried, “What do you remember, Tony?”
Steve’s hand gently held onto the fabric of Tony’s white t-shirt, pulling it closer to Steve’s lap. Tony yawned and moved farther from Steve, Tony giving him a playful look as he deposited himself on the side opposite of Steve. Steve bared his teeth childishly, growling friskily. Tony rolled his eyes, mouthing the words, “I’m so scared” with a sarcastic look adorning his face.
They were sitting at the breakfast bar when it started raining chitauri.
. Steve observes. His voice is still shaking but so are his clenched fists.
The one large guy left lets out an angry huff, “Look what you’ve done now, Pots, now you’ve killed an innocent civilian as well. Maybe if you tell us where the information is, we won’t kill him.”
“BP?”
Steve’s eyes tighten, “How long?”
The sound that haunts his nightmares starts reverberating through the workshop.
Justin’s smile slips off his face, a confused and angry one replacing it. “Come on, Tony! It’s just a bit of fun! I thought teenagers were supposed to be fun and exciting!”
“What? Come on Phil, I did my part flawlessl-“ Tony said, childishly arguing.
Tony rolled his eyes at something that must’ve been going on in his head. He grabbed his coffee and hopped off the bar stool quietly stating, “I’ma go call Petey.”
Steve took a hesitant step forward, not knowing how else to fix what he had deliberately broken.
“Um, I’m sorry to ah- interrupt. But can I talk to you-- Tony?” Captain America steps right in front of Tony, making the younger skid to a halt, still laughing lightly but scared as hell at the idea of yet another private conversation with Captain America.
Disclaimer: I own the Avengers (sue me) ((wait no please don’t)) (((I don’t own the avengers)))
That thought was quickly pushed away, soon the only thing Steve was thinking was “Tony, Tony, Tony, Tony, Tony” Maybe the occasional Clint, but Tony was top priority in his mind. Clint could handle himself easily. Clint had survived through torture and beatings and spy training. From what Steve had gathered, Tony had barely even survived his childhood.
. He’s dead but he was
Of course, we all had our suspicions about what happened to Tony Stark.
JARVIS is silent for a moment, faithfully doing as he’s told. His voice returns seconds later. “The captain responded, “This isn’t a question, Tony. You haven’t eaten all day and it’s time for you to eat. And soon, hopefully, sleep.” Would you like me to respond?” JARVIS plays Steve’s voice like a recording as Tony rolls his eyes.
(It’s progress, Steve thinks)
Well, Steve didn’t trust Clint with Tony anymore. Clint tried to explain to Steve and Tony why he walked out, but Steve didn’t want to hear it. Somewhere, Steve knew that Clint meant no harm to Tony, but his protective instincts had been at an all-time high ever since a front-giant psychopath endangered his Tony’s life.
“So, things aren’t exactly… normal between us anymore.” Tony says hesitantly as he pulls on some skinny black jeans that Steve has no idea how he fits into.
Logan growled, “Who the fuck is this?”
JARVIS intones quickly, "There are several doctors in the tower's medical bay on the 40th floor." Impossibly, the AI sounds worried.
Tony didn’t answer.
“Um, okay. Number one, we don’t even know if that thing was talking about me. Number two, this kind of stuff happens all the time!!”
Basically sleepwalking towards his bedroom, Tony let out a yelp s he almost came into contact with a body, sleeping against his door. Steve. He dully noted that JARVIS never specified exactly where each of the Avengers were sleeping.
There’s a sigh coming from the person next to him and Tony decides to sneak a look, even though he’s already pretty sure he knows who it is.
Steve sighed, “The first day we met, Coulson said that you have a way of finding the good in the worst of people, and I’m beginning to think he’s absolutely right.”
he is.
Tony gasped, “Wolverine! On your six-“
He does not expect Steve to stare back, eyes hooded as he tilts his head to the side. Tony hadn’t noticed how close they were before. His voice is low, deeper than it had been before as he agrees, “Yes, you are.”
“Tony. You’re everything to me.”
And Steve hates the way Tony calls him Cap; how he uses it as a way to put distance between them. It doesn’t sound right, not for Tony. It’s too formal, too impersonal and strained.
“Tony?” Natasha called softly. Tony’s shoulders tensed and he shakily turned around. Instead of being met with the reserved and teary 18 year old they had become used to, they were surprised to see angry eyes and shaking fists.
“Expendable.”
“Tony!” He yelled, and jumped out of bed and ran towards the kitchen; where he heard the scream. Steve heard the footsteps behind him, but he didn’t acknowledge them just yet, knowing it was probably one of his teammates.
Tony stands quickly, thanking everyone for their time and all but runs out of the room.
“You must have been very young when we met, молодой.” She says softly, and Steve can see the tactic she’s going with, but the boy flinches back.
I really hope you are all staying healthy out there.
Anyway, most of y’all aren’t even reading this so let’s just get on to the story!
“Shoot,” Tony mutters, blowing a half-hearted kiss to the woman behind the desk, “Thanks, Amy, be sure to send yourself some flowers from me, okay?”
“Dick.” Peter huffed, getting off the ground and brushing himself off as the elevator started moving to its original destination.
He has no idea how to process the information.
“Yes, like the fact that Maria Stark killed herself.” One of the women remarked. “Now Callie can have him all to herself.”
. Tony nods, “If my schedule is clear then I’ll be there.”
Steve was smiling widely at Tony’s adorable antics, “Yeah. I’d like that, Tony.” He said, following the younger boy into his room.
Tony turns to look and see, and yeah, Pepper’s giving him that ‘I’m so sorry I did this to you’ look, just like in all the action movies he’s seen.
"I might have heard something about that. Remind me, was it nine halloween costumes or ten?"
Tony gives a lone glance to the metal gauntlet that he’s been working on. There’s a miniaturized arc reactor pulsing in the palm of the glove, the rest reinforced by durable titanium in a grip that fits his hand perfectly. Tony sighs, unsure where this project is even going to go before sliding his arm out of the glove and shoving it under the desk. Tony goes to the workshop door and opens it.
“Stane. Obadiah Stane.”
*****
*****
“She…
They did.
Steve glances down at Tony in a way that could only be described as fond. “You’re meeting Captain America today, right? You’re Howard Stark’s son?”
No one may enter the workshop. No messages are to come through. Nothing.
“I got the feeling you had something else to talk to me about.” Steve says after a few more seconds, moving away.
As for this, comment, follow, favorite, send me copious amounts of food, petition against ever waking up before 9:30, and drink more coca-cola.
“Tell that to literally every person I’ve ever met. Trust me, the second I say I work in prosthetic manufacturing, people’s eyes go all blank like, dude, I can
Disclaimer: I don’t own the Avengers, yeah it sucks, and yeah I’m depressed.
Bruce took in the adorable sight in front of him. Tony, in nothing but Captain America pajama pants, was staring off into space, looking rumbled. Bruce smiled at the sight, but then groaned upon seeing the time. “Um, Tony?”
, rough hand grips his chin in another familiar move. The hold is strong, too tight on his jaw and Howard’s angry face stares back. “This is a warning, Stark. You must choose sides very wisely, as your father did,
“Wait. What’re you call’n me?” Tony asks, his eyes suddenly bleary. Natasha laughed and Tony suddenly realized, “You’re real gorgeous, Nat, like woah. S’no wonder why Bruce like s’you, huh?”
“If you’re asking me then I guess I can assume this is a dire situation. You wouldn’t ask me unless you really needed me to.” Tony says, mostly to himself.
“Right. Of course.” Tony said, leading Phil towards the elevator.
“I am

“Are you sure you want to do that, Captain Rogers?” Loki smirked, twirling his staff carelessly, “Remember the power I have right now.” He said, hovering the sharpened scepter way too close to Tony’s throat.
Freaking.
Steve bit his lip for a second, contemplating his next move. “I’m… just-“ And Steve just leans in that little bit more and finally collides his mouth with Tony’s.
.” She repeats, “The Winter Soldier is HYDRA’s greatest weapon. He’s stronger than fifty soldiers with the stealth and aim of an assassin. He has never failed a mission.”
“Jay?” Tony calls, standing slowly and reaching for the welding torch on his desk hesitantly. Jarvis didn’t just ‘malfunction.’
Tony can’t fall asleep.
“No, Tony.” Steve interrupts, and Tony looks away from his work at the snapped tone. “There is
Tony didn’t like compliments.
It wasn’t even hard to find. He hadn’t had to hack into any mainframes or blackmail higher ups for information like he had thought he would have to. All of the evidence was right there, in Stark Industries’ database this entire time. Tony had only had to type in his password and click on a couple of files from the archive.
. She’s been nothing but kind and professional towards Steve, and he can see the obvious affection she has for Clint and Tony. She still sets him on edge. He can tell he gives Natasha similar feelings. They’re nothing but polite to each other, Steve would probably even call them friends, but there is a definite tension between the two.
His eyes snap open, looking up at Steve. “You’re definitely not Clint.”
Clint dodges the pillow, but curses as the hot coffee spills over onto his hands. “It’s literally almost 7, what are you talking about?”
“So you’re saying that you don’t want me around?” Peter said through the phone.
Age: 18.1 years
“This.”
Tony raises his head and glares at the man. He pulls his wallet out and shoves his fake ID at the man, who gives it a hard look before nodding slowly. “Antonius Clark?” He reads off Tony’s fake name, raising an eyebrow wearily while handing back Tony’s “ID”.
Captain America.
“You’re not going to apologize for your father’s actions, right?” Steve asks slowly as he sits next to Tony.
Tony wasn’t lying when he said he wasn’t going to forgive Steve.
But the information is right in front of him. There’s no way he’s making this up. There’s too many connections, the words are literally on the page.
Steve frowns, pins Tony with a look that says
“Wha-“ Steve began to ask.
Steve gaped at the team.
And then he starts rambling on about his love for Captain America, not even realizing who he’s speaking to and Steve knows he’s a goner.
(Steve wasn’t planning on leaving him again any time soon)
“Pack bonds are unbecoming in business. It gives people more incentive for kidnappings, since the bond would hurt so much after enough distance and torture. Howard would never have a pack bond with his omega son. It’s just too risky. Plus, you know, Howard was never the affectionate type.” Tony says the words slowly, like Steve is missing something obvious. The omega hates talking about his dad, that much Steve can tell. The alpha doesn’t
*****
“Phil-“ Clint starts.
Tony had changed.
“I’m not freaking out.” Tony says quickly, pushing his hands into his pockets subconsciously.
“Punch me?” Tony banters.
Tony wasn’t sleeping. It was hard enough being stuck in your bedroom all day when you’re tired, let alone when you’re too terrified to sleep. Every time he was about to fall asleep he would jerk awake to maniacal laughter; either Loki’s or Howards.
“Er… Tony?
Coulson’s eyebrows furrowed slightly, “Actually, no. I’m here to remind you of Mr. Hammer’s party tomorrow. The HAMMER-STANE industry party.”
Tony groans, “So basically make like every other gala, except avoid the man the party’s about, all the while trying to get a hold of another spy. This sounds boring.”
Barton was shamelessly bragging to Tony (and Natasha was rolling her eyes), but even she had to admit that the kid was kind of adorable in the way that he was hanging off of Clint’s every word like he was the greatest person in the world.
Steve sighs, stamps down his feelings, and gets up to meet the others in the kitchen.
“Logan, stop! We need him to fix this.” Steve commanded, authority in his voice even though he was scared out of his mind for Tony.
“That’s awful, Shannon. Howard would never-“
Tony Stark was sitting on the couch in his workshop and his new security guard, Clint stood next to him, quiver tied to his back and bow in hand. The large T.V. in front of them was on Tony’s personal cameras he had placed throughout the city, along with three extra ones along the top that were cameras embedded in Logan, Thor, and Steve’s suits. Logan’s was already busted, the top right screen showing nothing but a fuzzy blur. He had been pushed off a roof onto a car two floors below, but he had assured them through his communicator that he was fine, but his camera had gotten smashed during the twenty-five foot fall.
Yeah, then Steve met Tony Stark.
SO wow new chapter. And new character! I’m not sure how much this character will be in the fanfic but I guess we’ll see. I really changed up the new character haha I could probably just make him into a OC but I liked the idea of him so :\ Sorry this took so long to update I was really swamped with essays and tests this past week. Anyways I’m sorry if there are any typos or mistakes in here, I’ve done most of this writing at obscene hours of the night/morning. I’ll look through and edit in the morning, but right now I’ve got to get some sleep :\ :\ thanks for barring with me, guys <3
He was actually cuddling with Captain America. Like, bridal style-neck nuzzle-snuggle. Tony stared at the people around him with wide eyes, trying to avoid the Captains concerned gaze. “Um- what… what the heck happened??” Tony asked hesitantly.
Oh god.
“If you’re all done with your pleasantries, we did actually call this meeting for a reason.” Fury says blandly and Clint rolls his eyes at Tony furtively. “You all know why you’re here today. After the Battle of New York it’s become clear to the world that the Avengers Initiative is an absolute necessity. Most of you have been briefed on what’s expected of you up until the world needs you again. Stark, you’re here today because we need you on board. Your tech is unparalleled and, more importantly, your father was well involved in the creation of the initiative. We want you on as a consultant.” Fury’s words are quick and decisive. It’s clear he’s already made up his mind. “Stark Industries creates weapons and transport for Shield. I’m asking you specifically to take care of those things for the avengers.”
Bruce and Nat enter the workshop, the scientist moving towards Steve and Tony with a worried look. Bruce's scent is dull, like most betas smell to alphas and omegas, and Steve appreciates it. Bruce wastes no time in checking over the omega's heart rate similar to what Nat did while also looking for any signs of broken bones or any other physical injury. "This isn't really my area of expertise," Bruce admits, "He seems fine, but we should really get him to a doctor."
*******
He finally finished the one glove-gauntlet thing. He hadn’t yet to test it, or showed anyone his new “toy” for that matter. But with the battery charged, Tony imagined it could do some serious damage. He actually had it with him, deconstructed in the case he had- somewhat suspiciously-left behind a pillar at the front of the building… just in case. If his plans went correctly, then the bracelet metal sensor bracelet on his wrist should, when pushed, connect the glove from the case, to around Tony’s hand; fully functional and energized. But that’s only if it worked, which Tony wasn’t positive it would.
******************************************************
“Obie,” Tony blurts in an awed whisper.
Tony slowly backed away from Steve, who was thankfully still asleep. He whispered lowly for JARVIS to show him where each Avenger was. He sighed as he saw the translucent map of the tower pop up with little icons to show each Avenger. Bruce was in Tony’s workshop, Thor was in the kitchen, Clint was in the air vents above Tony’s room and Natasha was in the workout room, each asleep at their obviously assigned station. Tony rolled his eyes for what seemed like the millionth time that day, and started making his way to a guest room on a floor away from the Avengers and let out a tiny scream as he ran into yet another big man.
“By the way, how come neither of you told me Captain America has a beard?” Tony asks dumbly, because
Coulson’s unconvinced look wasn’t helping Tony’s confidence.
To his surprise, there were no angry Avengers there to apprehend him at the elevator. JARVIS quietly told Tony that the Avengers were all sound asleep, and though Tony was slightly hurt at their lack of concern, he reminded himself that this is what he wanted. He was a big boy now and they needed to give him space when he needed it.
Tony sighs and hits his head against the counter as some woman named Agent Hill asks him more questions.
When Fury cleared his throat, the entire room snapped to attention, even Tony, which surprised the group of superheroes, seeing as Tony seemed like a hyper child with no off-button.
After Thor had left with Loki, Hulk asked Steve tentatively, “Little one better now?”
Also, the name of Thor’s hammer is Mjölnir. I used that in here so I just wanted to be sure y’all knew that.
Tony’s head snaps to look in Clint’s direction, an alarmed look in his eyes, “Do you think it’s a coincidence? The timing?”
“I think he’s going into shock.” He can hear Steve murmur to the others, even as his strong hands sooth down Tony’s back comfortingly, shushing him quietly.
“That’s what I thought too!” The guy agrees enthusiastically before slumping, “But now, I’m not so sure. It really sucks without her.”
When Tony enters the kitchen, Natasha is yelling at Clint, “You fell asleep!? Now we’ll never know who mad-“ She’s cut off by Bruce clearing his throat loudly. She turns around quickly before smiling warmly at Tony, who’s face remains blank. “Oh, hello cica.”
Tony chuckles at the blatant honesty. “I think I would like that. Tony Stark, though I guess you knew that,” Tony introduces.
“Jay… did that really just happen?” He asks softly, fingers coming up to touch his nose where Steve was so close…
Anthony Edward Stark
“Quick fight?” Tony asks teasingly, putting the phone on speaker as he begins welding two pieces of titanium together.
He agonizes over it in the silence of his workshop. JARVIS suggests telling Clint. But telling Clint is the same as telling Natasha and both of them—
“What about a club or a bar or something?” Clint asked, leaning heavily against the park bench they were crowded around. The night air was chilling but none of them noticed.
Tony wants to punch him in the face. Instead he faked a smile back. “You too, Justin. It’s been a long time.” Not long enough. “Now, why did you want to meet with me?”
“What are you, kidding, Callie? Did you see his face when we saw her body? He looked like he was going to murder someone. I just hope that someone wasn’t the little one.”
Tony nods, his breathing finally evening out as Steve’s hands continue their soothing ministrations down his arms. He looks back up at Steve and hesitates before he speaks, “I think I’m going to pass out now.”
. How could he have possibly switched sides like that? You’re distressed, Tony, you don’t know what you’re saying.”
Phil coughed awkwardly and nodded his head behind Tony. Tony blanched. No. No way, there is no way that the cliché “they’re-right-behind-you-and-oh-that’s-embarrassing” thing is happening when he meets his idols. He slowly turns and comes face to face- well, face to chest because goddamn it, Tony’s short- with Captain America.
too alike. If it were up to you two, I’d probably never leave the tower.”
“I know you’re thinking you’ve won here, by hurting a helpless little kid, but I swear to the LORD almighty, the second he’s out of danger, I’m going to murder you in the slowest way possible.” There’s the great Captain.
“Do we even know that it’s about Tony?” Bruce questioned, not moving from his crouch next to the drone.
Natasha poured coffee into her mug, “He’s a bad influence.” She grumbled.
“Steve! Please, stop! Logan! C’mon guys cut it out!” Tony was pleading. Steve looked over to where Clint was psychically holding Tony back. “Steve let him go he’s my friend!”
“Wait, what?” Steve asks, but Logan’s already gone. Steve gives Tony a questioning look, but Tony just shakes his head and shrugs.
“It’s okay, Petey.” Tony laughed, shrugging it off.
It was well into the wee hours of the morning when Tony decided to stop wandering around New York. He made his way back to the tower tiredly and slowly, thinking about various things ranging from the newly acquainted Obadiah Stane to what he was going to do about the Avengers. He had a feeling that his phone would be blowing up right now, if he had brought it with him. Tony could only imagine the worry that the over-protective Avengers were feeling right now, and he wondered if they were out searching for him.
, I guess-- minus the whole boring part.” The boy looks genuinely annoyed. Tony huffs out a laugh.
Hulk began to walk towards Natasha, who was now tending to Clint’s injured head when he turned, “Need Bruce?”
Peter muttered, “Chicken.” Before smirking. “When was your first time and who was it with?” Tony blanched, eyes widening. Peter laughed, “What? Was it that bad?”
“So then she was all like, ‘the only thing you take seriously is your job,’ and I was like, ‘um yeah, cause it’s important?’ and then she dumped me.” The boy, who’s suddenly sat next to him, on the floor (still unclear on when he got there) sighs, looking put out.
Tony vaguely noted his departure. He finally straightened himself out after finishing the coffee in his hands. When he moved to pour more in the mug, he ran straight into someone’s chest.
She doesn’t look as though she has much more to say, the little energy she had before was completely depleted. “They tried to keep us uninformed. My mission was to get Stark to submit. The handlers suggested using his father because he was a weakness that I could exploit.” Her eyes are apologetic and pitying. Tony looks to the side, embarrassed. She knew more about his relationship with Howard than she was letting on.
“Yes.” Coulson confirms. “We need you to infiltrate an event, receive a package, and deliver it back to Shield undetected.”
smh howard would he rlly stoop that low??
(See the end of the chapter for
Because there in front of him is Howard Stark.
It was like being in a dark room, and suddenly the lights go on, and you’re blinded for a minute before- wow, it’s all bright and alive and beautiful.
With that, his father disappears. The hand holding his jaw dissipates as if it was never there in the first place and Tony stares, wide-eyed at the well-lit room from his place curled in on himself against the wall. The doors to the workshop open in an instant and it’s all Tony can do to throw the forgotten welding torch as hard as he possibly can in that direction, scrambling up.
“Oh, um, yeah. Hi. That’s me. And you are…?” Tony inquired, backing up slowly, trying to find the panic button that was next to the light switch in every room.
“No time for a lecture right now, Cap, I got the footage from yesterday.”
“Too late” Tony said, sitting down slowly.
Steve can’t stop the growl that leaves his mouth. “If Fury thinks for one second that we aren’t going straight back to Tony-“
He can’t tell anyone. Who can be trusted at this point?
Honestly, it’s a little painful at first and Steve has to pull back a little, opening his eyes just enough to see Tony’s wide eyes and raised hands. For a terrifying moment Steve thinks that Tony’s surprised hands mean that he’s going to push Steve away and Steve doesn’t think he could even begin to handle that without absolutely dying. But then Steve practically feels Tony melt and his hands land onto Steve’s shoulders and Steve hums happily, pulling back for a quick breath, resting his head against Tony’s again.
Steve stepped forward, “Do you have a problem with me, Wolverine?”
Steve didn’t read anymore. He had read this article before, as well as the following. Both of the articles were about Tony’s parent’s deaths. Both newspapers expressed them as tragic accidents, and went on to express their condolences half-heartedly.
Luckily, Steve has the foresight not to ask any of those questions. Tony’s grateful for the silence and it isn’t long before the two settle into the bed more comfortably. Before they turn the lights out, Steve turns to face the younger boy in his bed. Tony wonders for a moment if this is weird, but he brushes it off quickly. He figures he and Steve will initiate a pack bond sometime soon anyway- similar to how he and Clint did. Sleeping as a pack was a lot more normal 50 years ago, but a lot of people still did it for comfort.
Howard and Obie had been long time friends and business partners for most of Tony’s childhood. Tony hadn’t heard much from the older man since his parents died, he had been too busy finishing his degree and preparing to take over SI at the time to notice that Stane had been building up his own company.
“-Which means that Tony’s safer here.” Natasha finished for Bruce, glaring at Logan.
Tony made his way to the dance floor surely, confident that the mission was going as plan.
“If that’s your choice, then you need to sign this.” Coulson pushes the packet of papers towards Tony. “With our agents this is done in the preliminary stages of hiring but, since you're not on our payroll we need to do this now. It simply states that if you are devastatingly injured or killed, Shield has every governmental right to cover up your injury or subsequent death and make other arrangements.”
His heart stuttered and his breathing quickened, coming out shallow. Somewhere in Steve’s mind, he wondered if this was what hulking out felt like.

“ Steve interrupts. “we would never be having this fight because you would not be in danger.” He continues, “If you were mine, there wouldn’t be a need for you to feel unsafe or for me to go out of my
Loki grimaced. “What is possessing you that makes you think that I will fix the little one?” He tried to smirk. “There’s nothing I can gain from you?”
Peter grinned, “Is that even a question?”
Which he totally is, by the way. This isn’t like the last time when he impersonated a janitor just so he could get information on Captain America’s apparent rescue and revival. Or like the time before

deal with whoever put you through this.” Steve’s voice is dark as he says this and Tony watches in interest as his blue eyes harden into something much more sinister and terrifying. Tony believes Steve, every word he says. “You’re going to be just fine, I promise.”
Steve huffs, feeling tears come to his eyes at the thought, “
Captain America. Seriously, there’s no way Tony is going to get out of this meeting with his pride intact. Tony just knows something terrible is going to happen; he’s either going to cry the second he sees the man in uniform or he’s going to faint.
There’s a silence. “Thanks for letting me get all that out, man, I haven’t really made any new friends since the breakup. It’s nice having someone else to talk to about it. I feel like all of our old friends have so many opinions about it.”
Steve nearly blacked out when Tony’s tiny face came onto the screen. Each of the Avengers seemed to take a step back.
Tony made his way quickly over to where the red head was, standing in front of her and grinning cockily (though Tony was pretty intimidated cause he was pretty sure she was a little taller than him).
“We try and get the footage from the workshop. It will be a lot easier to find whatever this is if we know what we’re looking for. We tell Shield everything we know and do an in-depth search into any and everybody who may have a vendetta against Tony or us. Then we find this bastard and remove the threat. Until then, Tony, you don’t go
“Are we talking about Peter?” Clint asked, falling somewhat gracefully from the air vent above.
“You.”
*********
Tony did not know that. He simply raises his eyebrows, not willing to show Obie just how much this meeting caught him off guard. “And what sort of partnership do you propose?”
A hand caught his wrist. “Look, Steve, I know that it feels wrong, but I think we deserve to know.”
A familiar blonde giant stepped into the room, “Maybe they cannot, but I can, brother.”
they had somehow survived, Howard would
“NO!” Tony all but roars, “I’m so tired of you all thinking you can just- Do this!” For the second time today he fists his hair in his hands tightly. “It’s my life and I need my privacy! You don’t know how hard it is to live with people who think you constantly need them! You’re not my parents! They’re dead! You’re supposed to be my friends, which means you leave me alone when I want you to! Just fuck off!” Tony yells, shoving himself off his chair so hard it clatters to the floor. He leaves Clint dumbstruck in the workshop as he barges out. Not surprisingly, Steve is waiting outside the workshop, but he definitely wasn’t expecting the storm Tony was bringing with him. He reached out an arm to stop Tony’s escape but Tony avoided it. “If you touch me right now I swear to fucking god I’ll break your nose.”
