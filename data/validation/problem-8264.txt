Howard stayed silent, his scowl deepens as his gaze turned to Tony once more, seeing his son's eyes becoming duller and duller as minutes passed and his mate become unresponsive to his plea. "I never claimed I was a good man, Jarvis, and you know that, everyone knows that; probably why you all left in the end." Howard said in a monotone voice, his eyes widen for a fraction when he saw Maria walking as fast as she can to the room that housed Tony and his mate. at the sight of his mother, Tony starts crying once more, pain and hurt and agony clear in every sob he let out, causing Maria to choke and rush toward her son.
"Come on, sweetie, it's bedtime," Tony whispered as he climbed the stairs, ignoring the tiredness that tugged him and demanded that he is to sleep… not yet, not when he still has unfinished business to do. "Here we go, come on baby, it's late." Tony tried to put Morgan in her crib, letting out a tired sigh when Morgan started crying; ever since Pepper and Rhodey left, his baby refuses to sleep peacefully anymore. Not that Tony blame her, especially when there was a ghost in the house. That was the main reason why Tony started sleeping in his daughter's room, just to make sure that nothing happened.
The first night Tony spent in the house, he spent it crashed in the bedroom on the first floor, not having enough strength to get up the stairs and go to the room he planned on being his. Despite the mild weather considering that autumn started, the house is freezing, and Tony burrowed into the sheets and bed, shivering at the coldness while wondering about the weather considering that it was warm this morning, but Tony shook it off, thinking that it was just moving jitters.
"Is that so?" Her father asked, resting his jaw on his fist, ordering her silently to continue; Nebula knew if she didn't give him a sliver of good news, her life will end here and now, no question to be asked. Nebula though wasn't an idiot; she was never an idiot who will come and talk to her father without a backup plan, she will live, she will make sure of that.
"It's OK." Steve said as he leaned to kiss the man on the cheek. "I understand, now go and help, the Avengers are waiting." These words made a smile take over Tony's face as he kissed his Omega once more and rushed to the front door, waving goodbye to Peter as the boy skipped inside the house with May in tow the two of them looking at Tony with wide eyes when the Iron Man suit flow toward him and surrounded him not a few seconds later, and then the man was flying up in the sky…The amazed eyes of his son were worth the flashy leave…
And they live happily ever after…
"Tony, please, run…" Steve plead, standing on his shaky legs as he tried to pull Tony away; Tony was not ready to fight Thanos, no matter how strong Tony think he was he would never reach the level of strength the Mad Titan possess, especially with him owning three Infinity Stones in his possession. Tony seemed unfazed by Steve's plea, unmoved; it was Tony who attacked first, blasting Thanos with missiles, trying to distract Thanos; before Steve managed to pull Tony away, Tony attacking Thanos relentlessly while kicking Thanos with his enhanced boosters before he could recover.
"I am sorry,
Tony walked through the hospital halls, going to a certain room in mind when he reached the room; he opened the door and pale as he saw his father there, pale like the sheets around him. He got a call from the hospital that tells him that his father was in a car accident, a teen who was driving too fast, hitting his father and crossing red lights, endangering lots of people but unfortunately for his father, he was the one who got hit.
The next time Tony woke up, Steve told the rest to wait outside until he finishes his talk with the teen. It made everyone heartbroken at the idea of Tony hating them, but he told them that it was nothing like that, that he thinks Stane did something, that nearly made Howard go into a fit once again, but thankfully Jarvis was able to calm him. Steve sit on the chair beside Tony's bed, he looked around in the bag that Natasha brought for him, the bag contains only a few thinks, a fancy necklace, blond hair that was drenched with old and crust blood, a snip of a newspaper that was talking about the explosions at SI, the rest of the newspaper was ripped and made into different shapes but mostly stars. Steve sighed at that and leans on the chair waiting for the Omega to wake up.
In all of this madness though, Tony can't help but hope there is a way to come out as the winners in this game of madness; a hope that they will save Steve and defeat Thanos at the same time. The past month was so hectic and insane that Tony can only hope of being able to power through the months that were coming.
"Steve, please call me Steve, Mr. Stark, anyone who can control this little brat is a friend." Mr.… Steve said jokingly as he ruffled his son's hair which made the pup puff his cheeks and whine which made Tony let out a soft laugh at that.
The sky was still thundering, and it wasn't even Thor who was causing the sky to turn dark in color that it was all black, it was actually Steve, and it was scary how all of New York was swiped away with the storm that Steve created because of his anger. Bucky, the foolish (And Thor's target) mortal, spent the whole day trying to calm Steve down, but it wasn't even working because Steve did nothing but ignore the Captain and go scratch the doors to Tony's lab as he begged the man to get out… which he didn't.
It took Peter a few more minutes of sniffing and whining before he looked at Tony with red-rimmed eyes. "Mr. Steve is gonna get hurt because of the bad man won't he?" Peter asked, his voice cracking causing Tony to still in his place at the words his son used. "I heard you talk with uncle Peggy and Bucky when you told Thor to return back home…" Peter mumbled, causing Tony to let out a harsh breath, biting the inside of his cheek to stop himself from cursing out loud; how did Tony not notice that someone was eavesdropping on them? It could have been worse though, it could have been Steve! Tony knew that it would have caused them good grieve if it was Steve and his self-sacrificing butt.
"It's OK, no harm done." Tony smiled gently, causing the teens to give mischievous smiles, and run away once more, leaving Sam twitching and groaning in pain. "They seem like good kids." Tony offered with an amused smile on his lips, causing Sam to let out a sigh and nod his head.
"That's when you are the wrong Commander; you see the assist is a few minutes from fierce heat, and when it arrives, the assist has every right to restrain you and do anything he wishes, think of it as a… reward, for serving us faithfully for seventy years." Steven pauses at those words his fury increasing every moment that passes, and he realizes that any time now, he will certainly lose it, and when he does no one will escape this place alive. "If you think that you have it in you to force him away, think again, we will make certain his discipline will be worse than yours, isn't that right, Sargent Barnes?" Zola questioned with a nasty grin, his sharply stare, making Bucky raise his unsteady hands to draw his mask off, letting it clang on the ground.
"Thor!" His mother's melodically voice caused Thor's heart to beat in his chest like a hummingbird, and as fast as Thor can, he ran toward his mother who was walking down the grand stairs. Reaching his mother, Thor could only hold into her tightly, trying to stop himself from shaking and breaking down; not now, not when everyone was counting on him, not when his mother was crying and holding him tightly just to reassure herself that he was here.
"I did nothing but giving him a chance to fight." Howard drawls his words, scowling at Bucky and slapping his hand away when it tried to reach for him. Tony did nothing but swallowed thickly; his hands were shaking as he tried to make his grip firm and not let go of Steve's hand, even with his mad thrashing.
"Mr. Stark, as much as I wished to help you, I can't unseal the records, maybe you should find another way a more professional way like hiring a private investigator or…" Sam was cut by the desperate look that was thrown his way.
Fury blinks his eye at Tony's complaint and narrows it, coming to stand in front of Tony and slam both of his hands on the table, which by the way was not necessary at all. "Break up with Rogers and while you are doing that make sure you host a conference stating that you have never been with Rogers and that it was nothing but a misunderstanding." Fury said in a serious voice, causing Tony to give a dumb '
The next three days were the most torturous three days in Steve's long, long life. It was like he went to sleep in the ice once more only to wake up to the world being flipped upside down, it was Peggy who tried to explain what happened to him, she tried to do her best to explain things that were simple to her but goes over Steve's head every time he heard them, werewolves… Men who can get pregnant every three months because of something called 'heat'… having animal instincts… shifting to wolves… having such long lives that humans were able to live for five hundred years or more… it made Steve wonders if he lost his mind if he tripped and fell through the rabbit hole straight into wonderland.
Nope, not at all, you don't know how many video after video I watched that featured Steve's strengths and weakness, let's not forget the theories I read about Infinity War and Endgame, and Steve controlling the Infinity Stones is one of the theories of why the stones lashed on Thanos when he wanted to use them in the first place, as for the side effect of the time travel, I wanted to go more in-depth to what will happen years from traveling and changing the timeline, you will see if you keep reading the story that the side effect Steven fears… he fears for a reason… for further understanding what I'm saying, watch the video, 'Ten reasons Steve Rogers is stronger than you thought'…
So after an hour the three of them were in one of Steve's cars, a simple one that wouldn't get everyone's attention on them, it took them half an hour of convincing Peter that the person who wore the mask was Steve and not some stranger, and finally the three of them were exploring the city. Tony felt strange with the mask on his face, he can feel the cold texture on his face, and how the mask moved to fit him every time he moved a muscle to smile or do anything else. He looked different than Steve, while Steve looked like he was a very fit thirty-seven years old, Tony looked like he was in his forties, a short man with his peppered black hair, and blue eyes, his face was smooth of any facial hair, with the wrinkle lines around his mouth and eyes indicating that he spent a lot of time smiling.
"Your phone…" Steve whispered when Tony was about to dive in for another kiss, which made the man groan and hide his face in the Omega's neck, letting out a whine, when Steve pulled his ear gently taking the phone from Tony's back pocket and a slap it in the Alpha's hand, making the Alpha glared at the piece of technology with hate for ruining the amazing time he was having with his mate.
"Steve… just call me Steve, Tony." The Alpha said making the Omega give a shaky nod at that. "I know Tony… I know everything and it's OK, I am honored that you decided to choose me to be the pup's father." Steve said making the Omega let out an 'Oh' at that tears start gathering in his eyes, he looked at the pup that was nuzzling Steve's neck, purring happily and gave a smile sniffing a little. "Hey, little one, you still hasn't told me your name, my name is Steve." The Alpha said running his hand through the pup's soft hair, that made the Pup blink and grins a toothy grin.
"Unfortunately, can't, he is… holy fuck! Is that Rogers?" Tony asked when he saw Rogers appear out of thin air beside Hammer in the full Winter Soldier getup, looking like a demon out of hell which caused Hammer to turn to his side and scream loudly (And God, did Hammer scream like a girl) "How… why… oh God we have to stop him!" Tony stood up when he saw Steve pull out his scary ritual knife that had dried blood on it.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Nah, it's nothing important." Steve offered with a smile returning his attention to Bucky, who just nodded his head alone and didn't point out his lie. "So you said you used to draw in high school, tell me about your adventures, are you a good artist?" Steve challenged cheekily, stealing a fry from Bucky's plate, causing the Alpha to pout but the competitive light returned to his eyes as he told Steve all about the painting he used to draw in school.
Tony watched the little pup, biting his lower lip as he tried to find a way to cheer the pup; it was scaring him how a lovely and energetic pup turned into this emotionless statue just because he saw Clint, and what does the other Omega meant when he said that Peter was afraid of Omegas? That makes no sense! For one Tony was an Omega, so if Peter fears Omegas then he should fear him too, but the pup didn't even act like he was afraid of Tony at all, for another Steve wouldn't leave his child alone with a person his pup fear or hate, even if he was desperate… it left Tony confused, he hated that feeling.
Tony’s head whirled to them and Steve took it as his sign to run to his Alpha, trying to stop himself from becoming overwhelmed and stat sobbing, the shock was still in his system, it didn’t leave him fully no, Steve had so many things to be concern about and one of them his baby, who was sleeping in May’s house. “S-Steve…” That was all the warning Steve got before he was pulled into a tight embrace.
They reached an examination room, and Steve had to sigh sadly when Peter's sparkling eyes dulled, which caused the Omega to bring the pup in his embrace whispering encouraging words, promising that he will take the pup for an ice-cream after they were done, which made the pup hum a little but hide his face in Steve's neck taking comfort from the Omega. "Tony, what are you doing here? I have patients coming soon." The voice coming from behind Steve made the Omega turn his head to see a doctor with blond hair entering the room, looking at Tony with an unimpressed look, and that alone made a smile come over his face.
… A traitorous part of Tony whispered, making the man stiff in his chair as he held into his child.
was clear in his expression that Tony couldn't help but shake his head as he gave his father the envelope back. "May woke up two weeks ago… and she told us her story or what she remembered of it. We just connected the dots from there." Tony explained, causing the tension in Howard's shoulders to leave and for the man to smile happily, giving Tony a joyful but sad smile.
It made Tony a little afraid; afraid that if he pointed to Steve that he was glowing, the star will spiral into a dark place because then he will be forced to remember the person he fell in love with, the one he lost his glow for. Because of that, Tony stayed quiet, content with holding his son and seeing Steve glow happily as the Avengers continued their movie marathon.
So what do you think?
At first, the other shareholders didn't agree with Steve, they even threatened to lock him out of the company. Things became rough after Obadiah Stane decided to 'return' back to SI and try to 'save' the company of his 'late' friend from Steve's delusional visions. Steve was grateful for Pepper Potts, the PA that Peggy and Howard hire for him to help him in his quest, and Steve knows that without the strawberry hair Beta, he would have been doomed…
So because he knew that it was going to be a lost cause, Tony grumbled to himself and decided to prepare a room for Rogers, in a far, far, far away corner of the mansion, away from Tony's room, or his labs, or kitchen, or library, or anything that generally matters to him, because if one thing was known, Pepper will skin him alive if she knew he was housing an Addams, and not even the winter collection of high heels would save his hide this time.
. It was then that heavyweight slams up against the floor, and the boards creak, straining against the pressure. The thing punches up again, targeting a loosened board, and in the weak moonlight, Tony can see the strip of pine slowly being lifted.
Tony looked at his phone biting his lips as he gazed at the number on the screen, it had been a few hours since Peter and Steve left to their apartment, leaving Tony to overthink everything that happened today, and he couldn't stop his mind from wondering at the 'What if's that refused to leave him alone. Tony sigh his gaze returning to his phone swallowing a little as he gathered his courage, and sent the text he wanted.
Without realizing it, Tony ran crossing the street, making the cars hit breaks and honk at him, while the owners screamed, but Tony didn't care, he just ran in hope of reaching the pup, which thanks God noticed him and seemed to recognize him as he starts pulling his hand from the Beta that was dragging him away. Tony heard the sound of someone snarling, and it was much later that he realized it was him, but it didn't matter as he reached the Beta and punched him hard in the face making him let the pup go, and crash into the window shop behind him, that scene caused chaos as people start screaming and some even tried to pull Tony away from the man that was twisting and trying to escape from the punches that Tony was dishing.
He dispensed the beers to his own bandmates and drank up. The first thing he noticed, which sadly wasn’t Tony, was the fact that their lead singer was, in fact, sporting a plastic Viking helmet much to the amusement of pretty much everyone in the room with them. He was also stunned to hear the guy address the audience in a fashion that did not sync up with the lingo of today. If there was anyone Steve could ever bond with over feeling out of place, it was this guy, but he seemed to enjoy audience reactions to it.
Obadiah simply hmmed.
Steve’s hand was covering his face and he was laughing silently. “God, Tony. Do you have any actual shame at all?”
Tony kissed him once more before standing up, abandoning his drink as well as Steve’s lap. Instead he grabbed the soldier’s hand and tugged on it until he was out of his seat as well.
Fury stayed where he was standing, and Steve was unable to tell if the man was upset or if he was trying to avoid giving Tony a pitiful look. “They went on a trip together, and they will be gone for awhile.”
“I’d say stick with me and I’ll help you out, but somehow I think that’d only be worse.”
*****

"Tony, where did you pick him up?"
“That’s because you have a bizarre skill that no one else has and you make it less fun for everyone else.”
“Bye again, Mister Steve.”
“Why not? I won, didn’t I?”
“Yeah. My music appreciation professor recommended it. Piano prodigy is what he said. I haven’t really done any further research on him.”
Steve had paused, a ‘no’ on the tip of his tongue but unable to make its way past his lips. What would he be losing really if he said yes instead? He was the picture perfect definition of a starving artist, working a job he hated that only paid him minimum wage on a good day, debt piled a mile high from his late mother's hospital and funeral costs, and a best friend overseas with a return date booked sometime in the distant future if he didn’t find himself blown sky high first.
Tony scoffed, eyes directed firmly at the ground.
“Okay okay!” He slipped the sweater on over his shirt. “There! Tis the season for tacky sweaters! But I am not going out in public like this!”
The genie heaved an annoyed sigh and suddenly appeared in front of Tony again. “I shouldn’t have hit you.”
Steve shook his head. “No, Tony. He’s not, but you should be Tony because you’re good at being Tony.”
“I cannot say that I would know for certain, sir, but according to these files it appears that he would have been working closely for your father during this time. Your father was involved in a project known as Project: Rebirth, and Steve was their test subject. There are pictures if you are interested for the sake of comparison.”
Tony tried to ignore him but he was mysteriously blocked from his exit by baby agents.
Needless to say, the problem was eventually taken care of and the turkeys were returned to their normal sizes and injuries were minimal. The idiot civilians were back in their homes and midtown was back to business as usual not long after.
“To be fair, I do have a lot of other work that I have to do outside the Avengers.”
“Stark Tower? Did my dad make a tower too?”
Dear Tony,
A moment later J.A.R.V.I.S. replied. “He is currently speaking with Captain Rogers. He says he will visit with you afterwards.”
Tony laughed. “Noted.” He looked at the house with wary eyes. “So, not a romantic getaway. Are you bringing me here to kill me? Because I swear I only drank your orange juice from the jug like three times. Clint does it every day!”
Tony stepped right into Steve’s space and scrutinized him for a moment. Steve watched him closely. Tony’s proximity usually had a strange effect on him, and it was something he’d never told him. He wanted to lean forward and kiss him, make him believe that everything he was saying was true. No one wanted to see Tony being happy quite like Steve did, and even if Tony did not return his feelings, at least he had to know that Steve wasn’t joking. Steve thought the world of him.
“We’ll be dancing out there, pressed so close to each other while the plug pounds against your prostate. No one will even know that you’re being fucked while we’re surrounded. No one will pay attention to the way you’re going to hump my leg until you’re coming in your pants and gasping desperately. They won’t know that you’re going to end up coming more than once and that you’re going to be such a good boy the entire time. Does that sound good to you?”
Steve shook his head, the smile on his face bright.
The blond just huffed because he didn’t know what to say to that. “I wish.” He watched Tony leave with Natasha when his phone began to ring. “I’m on my way, Bucky. Calm down.” He didn’t give his friend a chance to reply before he hung up and headed toward the front with the rest of his group.
Steve laughed again, this time a little longer.
Steve gave a silent chuckle and nodded. “S-sure. Th-this is making me think of wh-when I crashed. How cold it was.” He exhaled hard and tried to seek out as much warmth from Tony as he could possibly find. “Lot less wet though.” He laughed again, quietly, but there was definitely a note of hysteria in there that made Tony frown.
He wondered about Steve then. He knew Steve could play considering he was part of a band. He knew Steve could draw because he’d seen his art. He knew Steve worked hard to help pay for school and he budgeted his time, created his own personal schedule like a normal person should. Tony had never had to do that. He was fairly certain he wouldn’t have the slightest idea of what to do if a time ever arose where he didn’t have someone like Pepper to micromanage his entire life. So while Tony was a well-known piano prodigy and also a genius, he couldn’t help but feel like he came up short when he compared himself to others. Steve was brilliant, funny, he took care of himself. So did all his bandmates. They made it through life just fine without having to wonder where they were scheduled to go next and how far away it would be this time. Today he was in Germany. Tomorrow he’d be stateside again. He’d only arrived yesterday. None of this would have happened if he’d been left to his own devices. He simply wasn’t capable of budgeting his time on his own. He was frivolous. He was impulsive. He made other people wait for him and he didn’t care what he spent his money on. If there was something he wanted he reached out and got it.
“Hey!” Tony exclaimed, mock affronted. “ I am not tiny. I’m—I’m compact. And certain parts of me are anything but tiny I’ll have you know.”
Tony will forever be adamant about the fact that he did not squeal when Steve groped him. “That was rude but also kind of hot.”
Tony pressed his lips together and nodded, scratching the back of his head as he looked down. “Uh, yeah. That’d be me. Surprise.”
Tony pouted a little. “When you put it that way…”
Tony did another circuit around Steve. “Would you go back now? Say everything was taken care of here for good, that everything was in working order and it was possible to live some normal apple pie lifestyle, would you go to her?”
“Good to see you, Captain.” Rhodey shook his hand.
“What’s your opinion, Rogers?”
Tony wanted to yell at him, to tell him he was fine but that he wasn’t okay at the same time. That his world was collapsing and he felt like it was his fault. He wanted to tell him he was scared and he had no idea what he was going to do.
Tony squeezed his eyes shut. “I don’t...I can’t. It’s Obie. He’s…”
“Haven’t seen him since he came looking for you,” Clint said.
“Yeah. I mean, if that’s what you want to do.”
“Tony, shut up.” He quickly kissed him. “Of course I still want to see you. No more secrets though. Do you understand? But this isn’t something I’d stop seeing you over.”
Steve’s face was suddenly much closer than it had been just a moment ago. When did that happen? Surely this wasn’t some part of his fantasy mind going wild. It had to be though because the only logical thing to happen next in this position would be a kiss.
Tony snorted. “That person was an idiot. That person wasn’t about to have sex with you.”
Tony, for his part, could do nothing more than stand there in shocked silence. This was the opposite of what he’d wanted today. He’d planned on having a relaxing afternoon with Steve. He’d wanted to watch a movie and have some popcorn and just do a normal thing for once in his life. That was apparently too much to ask for though. Instead he ran off one of the best things that had ever happened to him because he’d rather fight than admit he was wrong or that there was any sort of error in anything he said. He was far too proud for that.
Tony sat back up and bumped his shoulder against Steve’s. “We can stick around until it goes down. Then we can head back to the tower. I’ll order pizza. We can watch a movie. Or we can play video games.”
“Can we just do this when I get back?”
Steve chuckled quietly. “I hope you two are able to return next Sunday.”
Peter had gotten into another conversation with Steve while Tony was on the phone and it was harder pulling him away this time. “Earth to Peter.”
Steve shook his head, embarrassed but Tony just gave the archer a lazy smile and a shrug. “At least we didn’t freeze to death.”
“I like to think I’ve matured since we met, Cap.”
“You’re so concerned about sticking it to your father! My father used to beat the shit out of me and my mom! I’m glad I was able to get away from him but I’ve been having to struggle to pay the bills and make my way through life! This little fling thing is something that I love. It’s something that makes me feel like I belong! You seem to just look down at it and consider it silly and it’s what I do. It’s what I enjoy. It takes my mind off the shit that I don’t want to think about all the time!”
They were standing in front of the diner and Steve couldn’t remember, for the life of him, when they’d even begun walking. He was wondering if now would be a good time to chicken out and run away, but he’d never run away before so why start at this point? So, as Natasha suggested, he walked into the diner with his head held high and a smile on his face.
“Where the hell did you even find this tree?” Clint mused.
“Oh come on, Steve. Stop being a baby. Put on your big boy pants and take on the situation head first.”
“Can I take you out on a date?”
Steve answered by thrusting his hips against Tony’s, eliciting a moan from the genius, causing Steve to smile triumphantly.
In retrospect, Steve probably should have kept a closer eye on Tony after their outing together. Instead of calming the genius like Steve had intended, the trip did nothing but make him more restless than ever. Tony threw himself into working with gusto, up at all hours of the night and day, living on loud music and caffeine alone.
“That is probably the most jaded thing I’ve ever heard you say,” Steve declared.
Dum Dum lifted his beer stein. “Here here!”
Steve frowned when the piano music became a little quieter. Was he about to stop?
Tony looked away, his eyes landing on Bruce, almost pleading. “I can’t kill him.”
Finally Steve got the match lit and dropped it into the fireplace, looking somewhat hopeful that he wouldn’t have to light another one anytime soon. Eventually the sound of fire crackling against wood took over and they both moved closer, reaching out their hands to warm up. Tony rubbed his hands together harshly and then wiggled his fingers to get the blood circulating again.
The look on his face made Tony smile a little sadly. “I thought about you a lot.”
“You haven’t known me very long.” Tony tipped his head to the side, mouth held in a thin line. “When I was with HYDRA, I wanted to sell you and anyone else they asked for out so many times, tell them anything they wanted to hear just so they would leave me alone.”
Steve felt his shoulders slump a little. “That’s not going away anytime soon, is it?” he muttered in defeat before walking out.
Another teacher, Clint Barton, nodded at the television. “They’re still looking but they haven’t found a body, so I think he’s still alive.”
“For two hours?”
Tony rolled his eyes. “Worst. Nickname. Ever.”
Tony’s brow furrowed. “Is it just me or is there something off about him? I mean I obviously don’t know him very well at all, but he’s struggling with something.”
“Are you okay?”
Slimeball laughed at this. "What are you going to do to us, little gi--."
Tony grinned. “See? Even Captain America can be beat, so my dad is wrong. Right? Then I can be like you.”
And with that they were off, shooting ideas off each other, back and forth until they ended up on the subject of the practicality of an actual portal ray and the applications as well as the safety hazards that might come along with such an invention.
Steve could not, for the life of him, figure out how to stick the key in the lock so he could get inside his apartment. This apparently required a bit more focus than he was capable of, so he dropped to his knees and found himself face to face with the doorknob.
It didn’t take long for Natasha’s voice to filter through the com. “Clear. It’s now or never, boys.”
“Uh...bon apetite?”
“And the whole time it made you believe that was me.”
Tony wrapped his arm tighter around Steve, trailing a kiss down the blond’s neck. “I’m going to ignore your rudeness for right now. We’re going to have words later, Rogers.”
“I thought I’d never get to see you again. Losing everyone is hard. Losing someone you love on Christmas...that has to be harder.”
“Get to Bruce, Nat.”
Six months later…
He spoke in hushed tones when he got to Obie’s involvement, eyes hard as he stared at the wall in front of him, fists balled up in front of him, only relaxing once he spoke about going to find Steve and his team and the way they’d helped him out.
Tony, being the genius he was, had compromised. He already made himself a vest when fashioning one for the others, because, well, who knew who was trying to shoot at him these days? His other gadgets though, those had mostly been projects he’d taken on as a hobby in between the more serious work. He felt very James Bond-ish in some ways, but with better toys and better looks.
"Well too late now. I'll be over soon." And with that she ended the call.
Tony smirked, obviously overhearing. “Kinky. Though, it might make things a little harder when you need me to answer your questions.”
Steve just shook his head. “Do you just prefer for people to think that you don’t care? Tony, I accused you of not caring!”
She turned smoothly on her heel and walked away.
Bucky winked. “I think we’re headed towards the next great romcom.”
“I--...”
The soldier gave him a smile. “I promise I will try not to get killed.”
Schmidt crashed into Steve from behind just as he made eyes with his gun, slamming him forward until his face met metal, slamming into the machines over and over until he managed to smash his elbow back and into the other man’s side, hard enough to crack a rib if the crunch he felt was any indication.
“You say the sweetest things, Bucky.”
Tony pressed his lips together and looked away for a moment as if unsure of what to say. Steve almost thought he might look a little scared but it was only for a few seconds before it was covered up with a neat little smirk. “I haven’t seen you in weeks you know, since that charity dinner where you turned down my offer to dance. I thought I’d stop in and see how you were, catch a look at your pretty face and maybe convince you to cut a rug with me, you know, for funsies.”
This… this was enough for Tony, the love of these two people should be enough, they were his family, they gave Tony their all, so it was in their right that Tony gave them his all too. It was in their right that Tony gave them the same attention and love he gave to that wretched devil who killed Tony over and over again until there was nothing left of him even to the vultures.
"Howard won't bother us anymore… I am sorry I took a long time to open my eyes, I am sorry sweetheart, I will change I promise, please come home, I am sorry." Tony whispered, kissing Steve's forehead as he held him tightly, causing the Omega to sniffle and hide his face in Tony's chest. "I left SI…" Tony whispered in Steve's ear, causing the Omega to gasp in shock and raise his head to gaze at Tony, not believing what the Alpha just told him; Tony had worked for years just to become SI's CEO, he sacrificed so many years for that position so why would he leave the company? "I was the wrong one, I admit, it took me a long time to see that. I left SI and Howard;
the words were clear as crystal, and were only changed in the last second because Maria was probably instructed by Natasha no doubt to keep the secrets the town's hold from Tony.
Pepper had said tiredly, making Steve held his breath at that…
While Peter was busy sorting the cupcakes, Steve came and pulled Tony aside to talk; Tony couldn't be more thankful to escape to the living room, he is sure as hell doesn't want Peter to listen to his and Steve's conversation, especially when it considered Harley. Tony couldn't help but wonder what if it wasn't him who found the boy? What if someone else had found him today? Just imagining that caused a shiver to run down his spine.
And finally Tony said yes to the date!
"I missed you so much…" Steve whispered between silent sobs and groans, his nails scraping Tony's back. It's easy for Tony to feel his pain because he feels the same, his chest aching from longing even though Tony is right there with him.
After saying goodbye to Pepper and Rhodey and giving each of them a hug, Tony waited on his front porch waving goodbye to his friends until they were out of his sight, which caused Tony to drop his hand and for the smile on his face to vanish, he was already missing his friends, which won't do, he has to be strong especially when the danger of Howard and Obadiah finding him wasn't over.
"Peggy… I lost my husband not three months ago… how can I even entertain the idea of going out with someone while still grieving for the man I was married to for decades… I can't right now, I am sorry but I can't… Tony may be my husband's counterpart, but he is not him… he is never going to be him just as he is never going to be a rebound for me… I can't be in a relationship with Tony right now, it's just like how you refuse for Rogers to be in a relationship with Tony… it's a little bit hypocrite of you to say that Peg, when me and Rogers may be sharing the same pain." Steven chided the woman gently, hoping that she will realize what she was meaning by her words, Steven can't even think about starting a relationship when his husband's death was still fresh on his mind.
"Why thank you, young gentleman!" Tony said as he leaned down and kissed Peter on the cheek with a loud smack of his lips, causing the pup to squeak a little and for a blush to conquer his whole face making Tony laugh at that followed by Steve who chuckled at his son's reaction. "Come in, please." Tony said as he opened the door allowing both the pup and the father to pass through.
"It was Tony's favorite food, wasn't it?" Steve asked after he finishes the cleaning. Jarvis raises his head at that and smiled tiredly.
"Stop in your advance Omega." Howard snapped, using his voice, which made everyone freeze and looks at the Alpha with dropped jaws, it was true that using Alpha voice wasn't prohibited by law, but it was frowned upon, people were even sure that the law will prohibit its use by the end of the year, and Howard just used his carelessly.
The choked sound coming from Happy made everyone turn their gaze to the man who was gazing at Tony with wide eyes. “Tony… is that… is that an engagement ring?!” Happy finally squeaked, pointing to Tony’s hand that was on his chest, which made everyone in the room turn toward Tony so fast, that the Omega feared they are going to suffer whiplash.
So what do you think?
The Omega sat on the bed after letting go of his babe, sleep refusing to came to him, making the Omega let out a shaky breath, covering his baby in furs before he stood up, walking on silent feet, not making any noise as he took a step after step, planning to go to the fire pit that warm the house and prepare a herbal drink to soothe his frayed nerves.
"I advise you to show yourself; you would not like what I am to do if you continued this game of cat and mouse," Steve called out after he reached a small clearing in the forest, turning his head to the direction he last hear the shadow from. A dark look was painting his face as he waited for the person who would dare to show their face, wondering if it was one of Tyber's minions sent after him.
Tony choked on his breath, taking in the scent of his mate, shivering and shaking as he let his tears go and hide his face in the Omega's neck breathing his scent and shuddering as the scent, of honey, roses, and charcoal, and a faint scent that made Tony's breath hitch and hide his face in Steve's neck, holding him tightly.
Happy October!
Oh how cute! Steve and Tony are finally working through things!
"Don't know why… hey kid, where are your parents? Kids shouldn't be alone with strangers." Tony said, not even caring about what he was saying anymore, he just wants to go home and curl in his bed, and maybe cry some more.
Tony knew that it was unreasonable of him, to push everyone and refuse them to get closer, even after a year passed since the truth was known; the thing was though, the betrayal still course down his veins, still, weight him down. The lies still whisper in his ears, and the dark warning Stane gave him to freeze his heart in fear; Tony wants his child to live, he wanted his child to be free and happy and live her life without the fear of death if she did something wrong.
Just thinking about what his father would do made him sick again, ever since his mother died when he was ten, his father was too overprotective, too controlling when he wants, he would flip and he will tell
"It was Tony… it was… I didn't notice that my child was suffering until I found her ready to kill him; I was the reason that he feared Omegas, I was the reason he was hurt and scared and in pain… it was all on me." Steve's voice cracked and Tony tried to shush the Alpha as he held him tightly, kissing his forehead hoping to calm him down. That day Tony realized…
Steve looked at Tony's face with pursed lips, seeing the emotions passed on the Alpha's face, he wondered what the Alpha was going to say, but it seems that the Alpha won't open his mouth and say it, the fast gasps of breath made Steve look at the Alpha to see that he was choking on his breath, gripping the roses in his hands tightly, and he wondered to himself if Tony was going to have a panic attack while standing on his house's front yard. years later and it seems that the Alpha was still having unhealthy levels of anxiety, he looked around the place, stiffening a little when he saw people pointed at the two of them, guess they noticed Tony Stark, which made Steve bite his lower lip then let out a sigh, turning away from the Alpha and opened the door he closed when the Alpha pulled his hand, he can hear Tony's choked whisper of his name, which made the Omega let out a harsh breath through his nose, cursing himself for being softhearted with the bastard, Steve entered his house, dragging the Alpha by his tie, slamming the door behind him while grumbling about noisy peoples and noisy exes. "This won't change anything Stark, now try to get yourself together, Peter is napping." Steve said as he went to the kitchen to prepare herbal tea, hoping that it will calm the Alpha before he passes out.
"How did you do that Tony?" Peggy breathed out, eyes wide and sparkling with so much pride and happiness, causing Tony to shift in his place, his face becoming red from embarrassment. Every person in the room gazed at him with pride, and big grins painting their faces, making Tony wonder what he did to deserve this, but happiness took hold of him, the elation of kicking Stane and putting him where he belonged was still thrumming in Tony, making it impossible for the Omega to sit still.
And a fluffy piece of fluff even with the sadness in the middle, oh, I'm bored…
"Why this place Tony?" Steve finally asked as he looked at the Alpha with a tired look, wondering why in the seven hells that Tony will bring him to this place, out of all the places in New York, it had to be the place that started all of the pinning and heartbreak, which was something that Steve doesn't appreciate at all.
"Probably in six months or so." May said through happy laughter which made Steve grin happily and pulls her in for another hug, cooing softly to the woman as she sniffed a little and hide her face in Steve's neck. The Omega knew how much May and her husband wanted children, how they tried for more than ten years without success, and it broke Steve a little that he had to ask May to babysit Peter a lot of times, knowing that every time the woman looked at his pup her heart will be a little pained for not being able to have kids, but hearing this, hearing that May was finally with a child, it made Steve happy, his heart fluttering in his chest.
Slowly, so slowly in fear of this beautiful mirage was going to disappear if he moved fast. Steve sat up and took the sight of his friends and loved ones in daze, a small smile on his lips, he missed his friends so much, when was the last time he saw his friends this young, this healthy, and have that little glow of happiness that surrounding them, instead of the regret and pain and hurt that coat, everyone, since Ultron.
James hissed, causing Tony to surpass his snarl and rein his inner Alpha before he attacked his younger brother.
So what do you think?
Tony's breath hitched and his eyes widen when they fell on the scattered articles from the 7th of May 1968, it couldn't be; did Tony really found what he was looking for? "Tony?" The faint call of his name caused the hair on the back of Tony's neck to stand on its end, looking around wildly, Tony didn't see anyone in the archive with him which meant that Tony still have a few minutes to make a run for it before he was caught… but running away meant that Tony would lose his only chance in knowing what happened to the Rogers family and the house he was living in, Tony's heart drop as he gazed at the articles…
"I see baby, it looks amazing doesn't it?" Tony said after he sat up, his pup giggled at that and returned to his exploring, leaving Steve and Tony alone. "Steve…" Tony said nodding his head a little getting a small smile from the man himself.
Now, I think everyone needs some explanation for what took a place in this chapter, let's go!
Tony took the box from his father with shaky hands, not knowing if he should open the box or not; looking up Tony saw the hope and pride in his father's face, which made Tony soldier on and open the box, his eyes widen as he saw the beautiful diamond necklace. Tony remembered this necklace; it was his mother's, the one she inherited from her mother on her wedding day, who also inherited from her grandmother on her wedding. "H-how…?" Tony was left speechless, tears clouded his eyes and Tony tried desperately not to cry, he didn't want to ruin the hard work that went into making him presentable to his own wedding.
Steve didn't care; he was so, so tired of always having to stand up and fight all alone, he was so tired of having hope and for that hope to dash at any giving chance there was, why can't Tony understand? If he wanted to protect them like he always claimed, then why didn't he invent a cure? Wasn't he a genius? A sob left Steve and he hated himself for showing weakness, but Steve can't anymore; he stayed standing with his head held high bearing the weight of the world on his back for so long that it ended up crushing him.
"S-Steve? You are awake!" Peggy's breath hitches, and when Steve looked closely, he saw how tired her face was, how she looked like she was going to pass out any second now. But even with that, Steve still hugged Peggy tightly when the woman runs to him… he never mentioned the damp feeling on his shoulder…
"See you later!" Steve waved to his friend which got him a wave and a thumb up from his friend; Steve hum to himself as he went to his car; already thinking about the new paintings he will start drawing once he returns home. Getting inside his car, Steve let out a sigh, wondering what he will do to gain Tony's attention this time; maybe he should chain Tony to bed so he will listen, that thought caused Steve to let out a soft laugh and he turns to put the messenger bag on the seat beside him, only…
"Peter! Go tidy your room!" Tony called out from the kitchen, causing Peter who was watching the TV to huff a
And as much as Steve wanted to stay with his husband or take him to Shield with him, he couldn't last Tony hurt himself or slip into one of his headspaces there and panic. So, in the end, he found that Cassie Lang (Who was the new Wasp) was still in the Avengers HQ, he asked the girl to keep an eye for Tony, with the promise that he and Tony will be happy to accept the dinner invitation Steve had been putting off for so long until now.
"Please, don't scream you will wake the baby if you do," Steven said as he raised his head from his sketchbook, giving Tony what he hoped to be a comforting smile… something that would have worked if the person sitting in front of him wasn't a ghost who died thirty years ago (A friendly ghost at that, but still a ghost) Tony bit his lower lip as he took in the ghost beside him; the ghost looking more firm than he was yesterday if that was even possible. "Hi, my name is Steve Rogers, what's yours?" The teen in front of him asked and Tony swallowed as he blinked his eyes, not knowing what to do.
"They have no right to decide; it is my decision to mate whoever I want, I refuse to mate anyone from the Stone family." Anton hissed, nearly letting out a snarl at the thought of him being forced to mate with someone he doesn't even care about, let alone have children with them; worse of all, he will be forced to join houses with the Stone family, something that he was desperate not to do, even if it means fighting to stay in his position, things that Anton had told Jamti every year when he was wasted from drinking too much ale.
/Warning/: this chapter contains, cursing, a little bit of sadness, fluffiest fluff, Steve is finally opening up to everyone, and Peter and Tony are the cutest little fellas out there! And who knows what! All reviews are appreciated.
"Finally! You are late!" The metal creature snapped when the ship finally landed and strange people got out of it, making Steven frown harshly because for one, they don't look like elves, nor they have the aura of Asgardian... they almost looked like… Steven pales at that line of thought as he took them in… they are Midgardian! So that meant he was in Midgard! Hate, pain, and sadness start warring inside of Steven, which made the star bit the inside of his cheek hard… just no! "Any longer with Mr. Star and strips over here and I would have become a loon too." The metal creature… should Steven really call it a creature when it was Midgardian? Said which made Steven glare at her or was she a 'him'?
for the baby, that Tony start crying uncontrollably.
"Well, well, look who is still alive and kicking!" Angie came to their booth, smiling brightly up at Tony, causing him to grunt and whine, hating how Angie always greeting him like that, but secretly loving the gentle and motherly smile she sends his way, Tony can feel how awkward Rhodey and Pepper most be feeling, as they send the woman an awkward little wave when she smiled their way. "You are eating? You got to eat; you're getting way too skinny!" Angie suddenly asked with narrow eyes, giving Tony a once over making him shift in his seat; no matter how many times Tony swore that he eats, Angie doesn't believe that he can take care of himself, which is harsh… Tony got better, he stopped skipping meals!
Thor's heart nearly dropped to the floor when he saw the Ancient one faint, so he rushed as fast as he can to catch him before his head hit the floor, his heart pounding loudly as he finally caught the man, letting out a shuddered breath as he held him a bridal style, turning his head to glare at Tony. "What? I didn't do a thing, he passed out when he said that name, not the first time he did it!" Tony justified, which gained him nothing but a harsher glare from Thor who growls at him as he lowered the blond man on the sofa.
How? Was the only thing Steve could think of; how was this real? How did Bucky found someone who resembles him so much that Steve won't even doubt the two of them were siblings? How was this even possible? Bucky was Tony's younger brother, the distant brother who spent years in the military avoiding his family, and even then, Bucky never resembled Tony or even one of the Starks… but this woman… this woman and the baby in her arms; Steve would never mistake them as anything but relatives.
Steve raised his head when the door opened, smiling gently when he saw that it was Tony who opened the door, as he was about to go search for him and Peter, having brought them a few gifts from the places he was to when Peggy sent him on his mission; the frown on Tony's face though made Steve concern, thinking that something had happened when he was away when he was about to question Tony he got the shock of his life when Tony blurred out. "Spent my heat with me!" Steve could only stare as the Omega flushed and red face.
"I… I don't know… I don't wanna bother you or anything…" Tony's smile slipped for a second, only to return as he kneeled near Harley, making the boy shuffle before forcing himself to look at the Omega, gulping when he noticed how close they were, which made Tony try and force himself to contain his heartbreak.
"Mama, what's going on?" Peter asked shakily, following Tony when the Omega finally opened the bedroom's window and stick his head out to look around before nodding his head when he saw the street empty and start walking around the room, collecting the bed's sheets before trying them into strong knots creating a long rope.
Reaching the hospital, everything was a blur after that; he remembers Bucky taking Peter from his embrace and running to the door together, he remembers Dr. Anna as she rushed to him, he remembers them wheeling his boy away, and he remembered waiting for any sliver of good news that will cool his already burning heart.
"Whatever you tell yourself at night Howard." Maria ends up saying as she looked at her hand giving a mocking smile to the Alpha. "You know, I always asked myself why? What did I do wrong for you to hate me and Tony, and I was an idiot… I blamed myself so much that I ignored our son when he needed me the most, I was obvious to his suffering, drinking, partying, sleeping around, I thought he was just getting tired and this was his own way to rebel against you, I should have known, you are Howard Stark and nothing, nothing is perfect to you even your own family…" Maria stood up looking at Howard with a sad smile causing the Alpha to shift in his seat and stand up looking at Maria. "Here we are again, me trying to fix your mistakes once more… but the thing is, I can't do this anymore Howard… I am sorry." Maria said as she took off her band from her ring finger and sits it on the table before turning around and walked away ignoring Howard's calls.
"You know I can't tell you." Loki said in a husky tone from the lack of use, which made Steven lean back in his seat with a small frown looking at the people behind him. "He is watching." Loki's warning made the hair on the back of Steven's neck stand on its ends, letting out a harsh breath through his nose.
Tony could only press his lips tightly and hum, leaning back down on Steve's chest, thinking about his husband's words. It was true; finally, the adopting process has come to an end after a year. It was a long time in Tony's books, a really long time, Tony wanted to finish the adopting process faster, maybe in three months or six instead of the standard twelve to eighteen months. Unfortunately, it seemed that this was something that can't be done, even with Tony being a Stark and all of that jazz; at that time, Tony was furious, he wanted Harley with him, Steve, and Peter as fast as he can't.
Tony couldn't help but let out a keen, shaking as he was getting closer and closer to finishing than his husband. Tony couldn't help the noises that were leaving him and they seemed too beautiful to Steve for his Alpha had to hold his growl every time he saw Tony getting more lost in euphoria. Tony's quivering thighs couldn't help but tighten up around Steve's waist, not letting the Alpha have any room to pull away from him, which did nothing but caused Steve to groan and thrust deeply, pulling a keening gasp from Tony as his mate hit his prostate. "R… R-right there, Alpha!" Tony moaned, holding tightly to Steve, shivering when his Alpha let out a dark growl and speed up. "Please! Knot me, knot me…" Tony whimpered softly to his mate before hiding his face in Steve's neck; Tony was slicker and slicker with each thrust and his husband had to pull and push more to have his body accept him. "Alpha…" Tony whimpered, already feeling closer and closer to finishing with each second that passes.
"That's Daddy…" Steve said as he showed Peter the picture, the pictured showed Tony and Steve, the both of them were holding each other with big smiles on their faces, the sun was setting in the background. Steve still remembers the waves as they leaped on the shore that day and the screams of happy children and the laughter of their parents… Steve as it seems, couldn't leave the picture behind when he was leaving, because this memory… this was the happiest Steve was, his mother was the one who took the picture, she had insisted on coming with him and Tony on their vacation because she wanted to see how the Alpha was going to treat her son, it was the last her last days, and Anthony seemed to knew that by accepting her request, in the end, she wasn't disappointed, the three of them had a lot of fun that day, and Tony even told him that they should do this family vacation again, that this was the first time for the Alpha to go on a family vacation as he told him that his parents are not the kind of people who believe in this kind of distraction.
"Thanks, Buck, talk to you later!" Steve called out, sending Bucky a grateful smile as he made his way toward his husband's office, wondering what Tony was going to do when he will see him. Running his hand through the envelope in his pocket, Steve smiled a flush taking over his face when he reached his husband's office.
"Looking for Steve…" Tony whispered, already feeling uncomfortable at the million eyes that were gazing at him like he was an animal in a zoo. He swallowed his whimpers, his need to find Steve increased drastically. He needed to find the Alpha, and he needed to do it now, and even if the Alpha was still angry or mad at him, the Omega would take it, it was better than being put on the spot like this.
Tony laughed at that and he stood up, with the small pup in his arms, making the boy gasp and clutch the Alpha's shirt in his arms, grumbling a little when the Alpha nuzzled the boy's cheek with his nose, but secretly Peter was enjoying it because it made Peter all warm and fuzzy on the inside. "Why don't we brush our teeth? I will tell you everything you wanted to know while eating breakfast, I'm sure your Mom will have my head if we are late." Tony said with a cheeky grin, causing the pup to give a small laugh at that and lay his head on the Alpha's shoulder, refusing to let go in fear of him waking up and seeing that this was only a dream.
Hung over everyone's mind, it made them furrow their brows in confusion and wonder; they didn't know if they should worry or let it be.
A soft voice shushed him, and a cold finger wiped his tears, Tony could only close his eyes when he heard the gentleness in the gruff voice that ordered him to '
"P-Papa you are embarrassing me!" Peter whine with teary eyes and puffed cheeks which made Tony coo at that and kneel until he was leveled with the pup, which caused the pup to blush and hide his face in his father's legs.
"Can't sleep?" A voice asked causing Tony to blink his eyes open, trying to look for the source of the sound, which only succeeded in making Tony shriek loudly when he saw the source. The source was Serpentine, who was floating over Tony's bed and was looking at Tony with equal boredom and dark evil in her eyes that promised death. "Oh, poor baby! Are you OK?" The woman asked in a worried tone, not that Tony was going to believe every word coming out of her mouth, not when she was grinning like a cat who got the canary and was planning on toying with it until it either dies or gets eaten.
He went home a month later, he went home remembering the way he looked at his father, remembering the last words he said to him, spite at him in fact…
Peter (A name chosen to honor Grandpa Addams, who was famous for installing horror in every normal human and none-human in the nineteenth century) was grown up and leaving the nest to start his horror path so soon, Tony wasn't ready for his baby leaving him! "Call me if anything happens, you understand Pete? If someone tries to touch you I want you to rip their throats off… and… and I am going to miss you…" Tony choked, causing Steve to coo and kiss his temple, which ended with Peter hugging his legs tightly and nod his head.
"I just wanted to talk." Steven said his smile slipping a little when Tony's face fell and became darker at the word 'talk' like he already expected Steven to try and sway him into Peggy's side, and maybe that's what Steven was after, but he was far more subtle then what Peggy or anyone thinks he was capable of. "Do you want to escort me for a walk?" Steven asks phrasing his words in a way that gave Tony no choice to decide, which the Omega seemed to catch on, as he bites his lower lip and nodded his head after a while following Steven when the man nodded to.
"Can you come here please? I want to tell you something very important." Steven's eyes were soft as he gazed at the small boy, that was trying to make himself look smaller than he already was; it was a few seconds of the boy fidgeting before he walked slowly toward Steven's bed, standing near the Omega. "I want to say thank you, Petrus, for helping me when no one did." Steven said to the boy, causing him to flush even more and lower his head, not knowing what to say.
/Warning/: this chapter contains, cursing, a little bit of sadness, fluff, violence, Steve being protective AF, and Wanda being a bitch! And who knows what! All reviews are appreciated.
Kisses turned into touches, turned into exploring each other, which turned into gasps and moans as they found each other's pleasurable spots. Reaching the penthouse, Steve and Tony made sure to stay as quiet as they can when walking to Tony's room. Even when Peter was sleeping on Bruce's floor tonight (The man was never a fan of any gala so he didn't come with them) it didn't mean that Peter didn't sneak here later.
"Hey Stevie, there you are!" Steve sighed when he heard Bucky's cheerful voice, he narrows his eyes and looked around to see that yes, he was still covered with shadow so he was invisible, and yes, Bucky was still able to see him with no problem, and no, Steve will never be able to hide from the former sniper no matter how he wished he could do it. Steve turned toward Bucky and paused a little with a thoughtful look, taking in the blue button-down shirt and the black slacks, contrast to Steve's tactic gears he always loved wearing, it's just something about the leather, metal, and black that always attracts him, but right now seeing Bucky in normal clothes made Steve a little self-conscious.
"Steve!" Tony's voice cracked when he tried to call out Steve's name; Tony could only run toward Steve, his eyes tearing up when his Stevie let out an ear-piercing scream of pain as he clutched his heart. Tony wanted to cry, he wants to break down and cry and curse and whine like a little child who lost his parents, but he can't, he can't, he can't! He has to stay strong, if not for himself, then for Steve and Peter.
"So you don't mind me loving him too, right?" Steve pressed on a little, which only got him blink from the boy and a little pause before Peter shook his head and whispered 'It's good', which made Steve wonder if Peter knows what he is going to ask. "So, I am hoping that you wouldn't mind if I married Tony, if I do that then he will be your Mama, but only if you want…" Steve explained gently, becoming concerned when Peter did nothing but frown and look away like he was in deep thoughts. "You don't want me to marry Tony, is that it, Pete?" Steve asked, wondering why Peter will become quiet and still at the idea of Tony being his other parent when Peter himself love Tony to the moon and back.
"That was harsh don't you think?" Loki said as a smile played on his face, causing Steven to roll his eyes and turn to the dark-haired man with a shrug." He made you angry didn't he?" Loki asked as he leaned on his chair looking at Steven's eyes, amusement flicker on his face, causing the blond man to give a mocking smile.
It was an absurd, so absurd, and cult-like horror movie. This was the finish of nearly every horror movie and book Tony read and hated (Especially how dumb the characters were), Tony was just waiting for everyone in the town to drop their mask and attack him. Did everyone think that Tony would believe them after they spent months lying to him? Did they really believe that he would take their words as truth? A town that was a safe haven for the abused and those who wanted a second chance being protected by a monster… that was the plot of nearly every horror movie dealt with towns that were ruled by a cult…
"No… no, it's not that, I just… well, my Ma still hounds me about asking you out and shit, and I am just thinking if I should run away and leave you with my Ma or something…" Bucky said with an embarrassment which made Tony blink a little at that and shook his head.
"Can I really?" Peter asked as he looked between the two adults, which made them look at each other, before turning to Peter with smiles, nodding their head, causing the boy to gasp in delight. "Oh, oh, oh! Can we go to the labs this time? I really wanted to meet Mr. J that Mr. Stark always talks about, and I wanna see Dummy too! Can we go to the R&D department too? Please! And I wanna, I wanna!" Peter starts jumping around which caused the adults to shake their heads, though Tony was too hyped up to care about acting like an adult, he was just engaging Peter about all the things they were going to do today, which caused the boy to look at his mother like he wanted to go and run away with Tony right here, right now, causing the Omega's lips to twitch at that.
Steve's breathe hitched, fear taking hold of him when he heard those words; Steve nearly snatches his phone from Tony and starts screaming and cursing at the other person who dared to say these words to Steve and his husband. This was crazy, is this who Steve thought they were?
Nearly fainting, Tony took a deep breath as he thrust himself far away from the ghost, his scream trapped in his throat at the thought of him managing to catch the attention of another Addams; Steve's ghost mother this time. "Oh my God!" Tony shrieked, his eyes widening even more as he gazed at the ghost who was solidifying in front of him, her transparent appearance turned into that of a woman with black hair and white skin, wearing a black dress; looking at the woman now, Tony can tell from where Steve got his look from (Probably his father), for the woman looks nothing like Steve.
Steve hummed as he looked at the peephole blinking his eyes when he saw a familiar woman, though he was sure that he has never seen that woman before now, Steve bite his lower lip and let out a sigh opening the door to take a good look at the woman. "Hello Ma'am can I help you?" Steve asked when he opened the door and he can see the woman's eyes widening and for her jaw to drop a little.
OK, so Tony couldn't help but feel bad about what happened to S.H.I.E.L.D. because of Steve and his mother, after all, those two crazy Addams were responsible for the downfall of the most secretive and strong organization of all time. Hell, even when Hydra was on the loose S.H.I.E.L.D. managed to survive; it even managed to survive the Winter Soldier fiasco. Tony never thought he would witness the day that the thorn in his side would be destroyed, by his husband-to-be and his mother-in-law no less.
"But this is grandma's home Mr. Stark, am not running away!" The pup said which made Tony blink at that and turn to look at Sarah who was hugging the huge Alpha, that made Tony blink and shook his head turning to the pup with a smile.
"Babe, what's not to like, you are adorable!" Tony said with a grin, causing the blond to roll his eyes at that, but Tony considers it as a win when he saw the smile on his Omega's face. "Say, babe, why don't we return to bed, we still have a few hours left to rest… I will make it worth your while…" The man said while wiggling his brows causing Steve to chuckle at that and bite his lower lip trying to stop his smile from widening.
"The Queen is here…"
"Angela just loves to annoy me something about her being my sister if I married her brother, which is something that is never to happen, beside whatever name you want to call me with I will answer." That made a soft smile appear on his lips, only for it to vanish at the woman's next words. "You hate being called by that name, my queen, considering that it is not your real name." Taking a deep breath, he hummed a little start washing his chest and abdomen, it was true, that name… the name the Hydra king forced on him was not his… only a hope of a foolish king that if he gave the blond a Christian name, it meant that the blond Omega was one of his people that followed his church and worshipped his God, ignoring the fact that the blond was once from the people he loved to call barbaric who worshipped more than one God, it has been years since he was called by his real name, a decade since he was forced into this unwelcomed life, but as Margaret said, a name is a name, and he will answer to any if it meant his people will be saved.
Anton's thoughts were broken by the sound of familiar laughter coming from the tree line, making Anton tilt his head and follow the sound thinking that it was Petrus and James playing around; a grin took over Anton's face, wondering what he can do to mess with the kids once more, it was fun messing up with the kids, especially when they make it easier.
"Why?" Steve ended up asking, part of him was shocked that Steve managed to ask the question, another part was grateful for the burst of courage that took over him. "Why did you decide to come with me? I know you don't want to step a foot outside of the house, but why risk it and come with me?" Steve asked, wanting to know the answer so much.
' such a stupid question, such a stupid question that Tony wanted to answer but couldn't because they didn't have time; they didn't have time and Steven Rogers was being killed downstairs while Tony hid in this room like a coward who couldn't move a muscle if he wanted. What will his baby think of him when she knew the truth?
"The two of us went on a date last night!" Steve stated in a cheerful voice that made dread consume Tony as he looked back at Steve planning to give him a few hits for signing his death on a golden plate; what Tony saw when he gazed at Steve made him flinch and back away from Steve. "Why? Do you have a problem?" The tone Steve used may have been cheerful, but the look in Steve's eyes promised death and pain to all those who oppose him, and for the second time that day, Tony realized why Steve was the scariest assassin of all.
It was thanks to Loki who came in to receive his new dagger that Anton was saved; finally being able to throw that wench of an Omega out of his workshop and running away to the forest, hoping to gain a few peaceful hours before being forced back to the complicated situation the elders of this village throw him into. Something that the elders didn't leave unscathed, especially with how much Anton snarled and threatened them with death and pain if Fury found something unsavory about the Stone clan.
"Oh." Howard blinked his eyes, raising his head from the newspaper that Tony desperately tried to ignore; his father didn't even pay any attention to him! "Well, we decided that you are old enough to live on your own, you didn't seem like you need us with the Iron Man gage you have and the company which seems to be doing great; good for you," Howard stated after he flipped the page of his newspaper ignoring the full-bodied twitch that Tony did after hearing Howard's stupid reasoning.
It was a week from hell, everything was blurry and he couldn't concentrate on anything other than the need, he needed something, he knows he does! But what?! In the distant, he swore he heard his father enrage voice as he huffed and puffed, it was followed by his mother, aunt Peggy, and Jarvis… and Tony was scared. He remembered how he made his body crawl into his closet, and close the door behind him, he didn't know how much he stayed there, but he knows it was enough to cause panic with his 'family'. Tony knew it was childish, but he couldn't stop wishing that Captain America would come and save him…
Steve looked at the shackles and let out a chuckle which made the woman frown and look at the man who sends her a small smile. "The first time I see you in more than thirty years and the first thing you do is shackling me to the bed… you still haven't changed, Peggy." Steve whispered not raising his voice, his throat was as dry as the desert and he didn't want to aggravate it as it is.
"New York mansion, if we go now we might reach them on time." Natasha said as she starts running toward the car with the rest of the team behind her, everyone was a little shaken by the way Tony acted, what did that letter contain for the Alpha to turn feral?
J.A.R.V.I.S.'s words made Tony give a confused noise, scrunching his nose at the information and went to the lift as fast as he can; why would Peter go to the roof? Peter knows that he wasn't allowed there unless there was an adult with him; usually, Peter was with Bruce, because his science buddy loved tending to the garden that Bucky started up there when Peggy brought him back to the tower.
A choked whine left Tony when he felt a soft squeeze on one of his hands, causing Tony to raise his head, his teary eyes taking in Steve whose tired eyes were staring at Tony unfocus in their stare. "Steve, sorry, Steve…" Tony gasped, repeating his words over and over again, gaining nothing but a shuddered breath from Steve and his hand being squeezed weakly.
So what do you think?
"Then why did you come here?" Tony asked, wanting to know what made Angie come to this town if she had everything she wanted, she was married, she had a home, she had a job; so what brought her to this town in the first place? What brought her here and let her abandoned everything, her home, her husband, and her job?
Steven Grant Rogers. That was the name of the Rogers's son, Steven Grant Rogers; a kid of 18 years old, a kid that's younger than Tony by only a year. A kid that was beaten in his house so brutally that the officers who arrived at the scene didn't believe what they saw; a kid who was dragged to be drowned in the lake. All because some bullies in his class had grudge against him. Bullies who turned out that one of them was Alexander Peirce's son. Alexander Peirce; a teacher who assaults a female student and threatens her to do his bedding causing her to choose the way of suicide to escape from his claws. A scumbag who was exposed by Steven Grant Rogers and went to jail.
Howard… Howard looked like a corpse that was living on fumes, always talking to himself, always searching, searching, and searching! For what? Steve didn't know, the rear times he was able to see Howard, the older man would just look at Steve for a long time, he then would give a sad and tired smile, a smile that says that he only now remembered something funny… that wasn't funny anymore… Howard will always return to his search after that, leaving Steve with the feeling of missing something… Steve felt like he wasn't the only person who was losing his mind…
That made Steven turns to him and pauses a little, was it because of the stones? He paused a little trying to remember more… no, it wasn't. "No…" Steven said as he looked at the nightstand, touching Edith gently before taking her and looking at the glasses. "It was only a part of it… this world has no surviving chances against Thanos it seems… but it was not it… your universe, its future was wrong, was already fractured…" Steven said slowly tasting every word before he said it but knowing that deep down it was right.
(See the end of the chapter for
Thanks to everyone who left comments on the fic.
“It’s OK, Ben.” Steve said as he went to his friend, hating how rough his voice was, and how it was almost gone, but Steve needed to stop Ben before he shoots Howard, and then all hell will be on them. “He helped us; he shot the one who did this.” Steve explained, causing his friend to gaze at him with concern, biting his lower lip, Ben nodded his head and lower the gun down, giving Howard a nod before he herded Steve toward May who was holding Peter tightly in her embrace, ready to take them in his house, thankfully it was then that the police followed by the ambulance arrived.
Tony though, let out an enraged scream as he took after Howard, planning on killing him in this place; he was going to kill them and get rid of the headache that dominated him for the past two hours… to think that Tony hoped his parents would accept him back, who was he kidding? Those two deserve to die! Steve should have killed them when he had the chance, but he didn't, but that's OK, it just meant that Tony had to finish the mission his stupid husband-to-be couldn't seventeen years ago.
"But… it's yellow?" Peter asked as he looked at Steve with confused which made the Alpha smile at the small pup and ruffle his hair which made the boy giggle and shriek, trying to pat Steve's hand away, Steve was proud to say that the small pup's vocabulary got better in only two weeks, it was obliviously that the small pup was a genius just like his mother, or his speech wouldn't be as perfect as it was now.
Steve hissed softly to himself as he felt his body throb, he grumbled a little to himself as he tried to find a good position that wouldn't aggravate his injured body more and to think that being dead meant not feeling pain.
Looking around, Tony nearly let out a triumph shout when he arrives at the sixties section. As fast as he can, Tony dropped the baby bag and rushed to the box labeled as 1965, shushing his baby when Morgan let out a whine. Just the murder cases, Tony just needed to search the murder cases. Tony's breath hitched as he rushed through the boxes that labeled 1965, 1966, and 1967 without finding anything useful; reaching the box labeled 1968 Tony was sweating like someone just drenched him with water, his heart rate increased and his paranoia went through the roof; how long since Maria and him splits ways? Did she come to search for him?
The scene seemed to have attracted the attention of everyone, and everyone shifted away with such discomfort, some Omegas gazed between Steven and the group of men before they ran away, leaving Steven alone, but the Omega only scowled and turned around continuing his path not in the mood for the pointless fight that will take place if he stayed. "What? Running away already? We just wanted to talk to you about what your mate did!" Screaming and snarling could be heard as they called after Steven, which the blond man ignored, and that got him a growl from the men behind him who seemed to have followed him.
I know, I know, a short and a late chapter?
Tony let out a tired sigh, pouting as his eyes fell on the clock, which informed him he has at least two hours to prepare, but knowing Steve, he would probably show up any minute now. Steeling himself, Tony huffed and snatched his funeral suit, grumbling all the way, about scary Addams and idiot assassins.
"Come on, dear, I know a good diner just around the corner, and I am sure a good night's sleep will bring back the blush to your cheeks." The woman said which made Tony blink and flush a little, grumbling to himself as he followed the woman to the car. "You can sign the papers tomorrow, don't worry about the mess, it will be all cleaned before we get back here tomorrow, by then you could tell my husband what kind of remodeling you want, also if you want I have a room in my house that can serve as a temporary guest room, we don't have motels here, as you can see we don't usually have people who drive in through the forest to reach our town." Mrs. Carter said, talking about this and that which made Tony hum to himself as he nodded his head walking beside the woman toward her car.
It was a harsh blow to Tony, thinking that Harley was forcing himself to interact with him, forcing himself not to flinch every time Tony touched him or smiled at him; as much as Steve reassured him that Harley genuinely enjoyed his time with Tony, it was hard to believe it. For some reason, it really broke his heart and made him feel useless; Tony never realized how different Peter's situation was from Harley until then.
"He is right, Steve, please calm down." Peggy said glaring at Steve, hoping that he will see reason and not rush off like an idiot and uncovered what Steven told them not five minutes ago, Peggy and Steve continues to glare at one another until the blond Alpha let go of Peggy and returned to the team standing beside Tony who tried not to back away from the Alpha, Peggy looked at her nephew only to see the pain and heartbreak hiding deep in his eyes, and she had to sigh at that, she had begged the Omega to not fall in love with the blond Alpha, but it seems that her pleas were unheard. "What are we going to do then, shut down Project Insight," Peggy asked after she turned to Steven causing the man who was glaring at his counterpart to turn to her.
Entering the kitchen, Tony held in his sigh when he saw that Natasha had been waiting for him with a dark glare on her face; a glare that promised death and pain, causing Tony to shift in his place with a grimace. Now, Tony could have walked away without a care, he just has to turn around and leave the kitchen, that's it. But no! He was Tony Stark, and Tony Stark doesn't run away from a fight, even if the said fight was going to be with one of his teammates.
So what do you think?
"I'm sure, been thinking about it for a long time, Peter needs to know about the two of us before everyone else, he deserves it." Tony let out a pleasant sigh as he said those words, getting a soft smile from Steve who nodded his head, agreeing wholeheartedly with Tony. "I'm going to make dinner, his favorite; it will be easier to break the news to him with a full stomach." Tony said, giving Steve a kiss on the cheek before standing up, heading to the kitchen already planning on making dinner, probably timing it, so that when Peter returns home the dinner will be ready.
A minute passed, maybe hours? Tony didn't know or care about that, he was in his own little world, trying desperately to convince himself that this was just a nightmare, a nightmare that he will wake up from… hopefully. Tony sighs and looks down at his tummy, only to see his hand caressing it, which made him snatch his hand, fast, like it was burned. He glares at his stomach and when the door opened he looked at the Beta that walked toward him with a sunny smile on her face, Tony grimace at that.
When the two reached the door Tony spotted the female with the strange red hair and throw her a glare only to get a smirk in return which made the Omega hold his growl and power walk out of the door, after saying goodbyes to Mr. Rogers, he still has his manners, after all, it was until he returned home that he realized…
"Thank you…" Steve said tiredly as he put two cups of herbal tea on the table, Tony hummed and took a sip of his cup, having only now got down from putting Peter to sleep in his bed, Steve glancing at Tony's wrest he saw that the watch was still not there which meant that it was still with Peter, something he has to talk to the boy about later, Tony just looked at him with a tired look, mastering a little smile, which made the Omega nod his head and return to his tea, he wondered if the Alpha was going to survive the rest of the journey if he looked like this on the first day, that made Steve pause and gazes at Tony with a thoughtful look…
"Why aren't you full of surprises?" Tony cooed, which caused the baby to blink and suck on Tony's finger, causing a dark grin to take over Tony's face when he notice the kid suckling the blood from the wound on his finger; a wound that Tony got from the little tyke's fangs. "Oh, Steve's gonna love you!" Tony giggled, putting his free hand under the baby before raising him from the box, laughing when the kid squeaked and held Tony's finger tightly. "You would fit in perfectly, won't you? Yes, you will!" Tony snuggled with the baby, deciding that just this once allowance can be made, especially for a kid who didn't seem that scared or even annoyed with the mad giggles Tony was letting out.
"Is that so?" Tony asked with a surprised tone, getting a nod from Steve who starts touching the slick pieces of metal, the look of amazement on his face. "You seemed to know a lot about technology considering this is the first time you touched or gazed at it. There are at least two hundred years since the first train was made and now, I like to think we have come a long way since then." Tony gave Steve a playful grin, feeling his heart flutter when Steve let out a chuckle.
"A strange organization appeared a few years ago, calling themselves the 'League of Evil Inhumans' you will find everything you need to know about the members in the file, one of our spies told us that they invented a time-traveling machine, planning to go to the past and help Thanos in his quest, they somehow were able to steal the original blueprint of the time travel machine from the Time Heist. Your mission is to destroy the machine and take the blueprint, do not engage with them unless necessary." Fury said making Steve nod his head taking the file and turn around to head out. "Be careful, Steve, don't do anything stupid." Fury said softly making the soldier paused and turn to Fury giving him a tired smile.
Steve paused a little and then let out a sigh shaking his head at that. "I get it, Maria was here." Steve said as he closed the door and wheeled the chair until it was near the window, then he walked taking the seat near Tony's bed, getting hissed at all the while. "Tony… just because you are going to go to the therapy doesn't mean you are crazy." Steve said which made Tony clench his fists.
When they finally reached the hospital, Steve was separated from the pup; he walked around the place until he saw a sobbing Peggy sitting in the waiting room, Howard was with her his shaking hand on her shoulder, Maria was screaming at the doctors pleading with them to let her see her son, Angie was there rocking herself back and forth in her seat, tears streaming down her face, and Jarvis… Jarvis was taking all of this with a shocked slack face, trying to be stronger, going from Maria to Peggy, pleading with them to calm down or they will hurt themselves or worse someone.
At least that's what Steve thought before he went to the living room, finding Bucky there glaring at the Betas who were working to change the broken windows. "Bucky, have you seen Tony anywhere?" Steve asked hopefully, hoping that Tony was nearby so that they could have a calm evening together.
Though when Steve lay down fully on top of Tony the engineer tensed, holding his breath and closing his eyes; that made Steve pull away. Tony noticed and start pulling at his arms to pull him closer again but Steve did not let himself be budged. He looked at the man under him, at his flushed face and clear arousal but there was something else in his eyes, fear, and just seeing that look there was enough to vanish all aroused thoughts from Steve, but he soldiered when Tony let out a distressed whine when he pulled away. With a smooth motion, Steve reversed their position so Tony lay on top of him, knees on either side of his waist. Tony on the other hand was looking down at him with bewilderment. It was an endearing vision. "This might be better." Steve said softly, voice lilting slightly at the end in question and Tony's eyes darkened and his body relaxed slightly, giving a nod at the unasked question.
On the first day before Christmas, my evil did recall! One short chapter being posted late!
Tony sat on the comfy sofa waiting for the owner of the house to return. Two weeks after his appointment with Dr. Cho, Tony did lots and lots of thinking (If that was even possible) and he comes with the conclusion that no matter what he planned in the first place, he couldn't go with the original plan, he couldn't kill the par-
Tony gazed at the rose stems that had the actually roses cut off, leaving only the stalk that was full of sharp thorns and dead leaves. Tony could do nothing but gaze at the stems then at Rogers who was looking at him like he hung the moon in the sky, which was making Tony uncomfortable, especially when he realized that his teammates would kill him if they heard about this. Tony laughed nervously at that and pushed Rogers' hand away from him which made the man's face become crestfallen at that… "I am really sorry… but I… uh… I'm too busy for a relationship… I don't even know you that well… besides, I am sure everyone is going to be mad about this… so sorry…?" Tony was sure he opened his mouth and inserted his foot in it, as he got out of Rogers' arms walking backward, away from Rogers, expecting the man to go into a fit, which he may have been right.
They start looking at him with so much caution and concern that it made Tony shake on the inside, afraid that they discovered his secret, the disgusting secret that kept him awake at night, sweating in fear. After that, Tony stopped; he stopped talking about Ty, he stopped sleeping in Peggy's house, because the woman sure as hell doesn't need him disturbing her calm life with her husband. Tony forced himself to stop flinching and start smiling; he forced himself to leave what happened a month ago in the past, even when he has the ultimate evidence on his body that backed his words.
There was a man near the window and if Steve had to guess he was the one who dared to enter his house and hurt him and his baby, the man talking on his phone with someone, which Steve took as his chance to try and wiggle his hands out of their bound to test their strength. Slowly Steve's hands inched to his back pocket when he always kept a small fold it knife that was shaped like a key, something that Bucky always nagged at Steve to have with him all the times, and now of all times, the Omega was grateful for Bucky being a mother hen, because when Steve's hands touched the key, he nearly let out a shout of elation.
Today, his mother forced him to attend one of her charity work, for sick kids with leukemia or some other type of cancer his mother work with these days, it ends with Tony walking around the ball he was in with a tight smile on his lips that only soften when he sees the children with their parents waving at Tony, the Alpha took pictures with the children and talked with their parents.
And the angst is still here.
"Your father is a smart man, Pete." Tony said as he turns to prepare their lunch. "So tell me little bambino, why aren't you in school today, skipping your classes already?" Tony asked as he cut the chicken to small cubes, holding his smirk in when the pup squeaked at that like he was offended by Tony's words.
… Tony's mind whispered as it tried to urge himself to save his baby, to replace the evil in front of him with the lesser one… the one that is named Steven Rogers.
Tony blink as he saw the lights changed and he waited until the cars stopped before crossing the bath, his eyes zeroing on the big building in front of him. A lot of things changed in the past year, Tony get to know more about Sarah Rogers who always talks about her ex-soldier/famous artist son and her grandson, he always wonders why the son never visited his mother, but Winnie ends up telling him that the Alpha (Sarah's son) lives in London. It was a year since Winnie came into his house with George, both of them crying their eyes out, telling him about their son losing his arm overseas and that he was being shipped home next month, that day Tony create his first prosthetic limb; he worked on that arm to perfection and with the help of Bruce, the limb was a perfect replacement for the arm James (Winnie's son) lost, Winnie even told them that her son could fell things with his arm, like temperature, texture, and other things, the prosthetic was success when SI launched it a month later into the markets. A year pass with Clint taking it upon himself to help Tony with finding his son; Phil working with the government had its perks, but finding where Tony's pup was not one of them, though the two helped him whenever they can, even if it meant that Clint will force Tony to babysat his little devils when he had a date night with his mate. A year pass since Carol dropped from the air force because she fell pregnant, now she and Rhodey were on their leave, enjoying their three months of bonding with their one-month-old baby James the second or Jimmy for short, needless to say, Tony laughed his ass off when Rhodey told him about the name. a year pass with him and Pepper becoming close to a sister and brother more and more, the Beta always worried about him every time he left her sight, old habits die hard, especially when Happy became his personal driver to keep Pepper updated on his whereabouts, it was kinda insulting, but he could understand from where they were coming.
"A few weeks ago, I was able to detect the space stone signature on Midgard." Nebula stated, thanking every God in Asgard that her voice didn't crack from how afraid she felt; Thanos paused, which made her give a shaky and a silent sigh, maybe he didn't know about this, maybe she can survive. "I went to investigate the reading I was getting; it seems not only the Golden Bride's Astral Form was on Midgard since his disappearance, but it seems that the space stone was able to give the Golden Bride a physical body, a human one at that, You can know the Golden bride by him wearing the space stone as a necklace around his neck." Nebula held her breath when Thanos stood up from his throne; she tried her hardest not to shake when she saw the mad light in the titan's eyes.
So after a long two hours flight in the suit in fast nearly sonic speed (But not that fast yet, Tony was still thinking for a way to do that) and doing a lot of thinking (Way too much thinking for a genius like him) Tony came to the final conclusion, and it was… Nope! No, no, no, and hell to the no! He can't (Won't) forgive his parents for abandoning him for seventeen years! If they left him a year or two before contacting him, Tony would have understood, hell, he would have even accepted marrying Steve as a part of the deal, mainly to thank him for saving his parents. But what did his parents do? They disappeared for seventeen years, Tony gained a phobia from cemeteries because he saw the zombies/dummies that Steve replaced his parents with rising from their graves and to top it all, it was Steve, who told him about the deal with his parents, a deal until two hours ago Tony didn't know anything about!
"Thanks, Buck, but I think I am done." Grumbled Steve as he stood up, frowning a little when Peggy and Bucky's living room became a little darker, did a lamp broke and he didn't hear? Looking around Steve grumbled as he shuffled on his legs planning on going to his room and hide for the rest of the day; no, Steve will hide in his room until the ball is over and done, he will not show his face even after everything is said and done!
Everything was quiet, no sound was heard other than Morgan's squeals and giggles and blabbers as she tried to wiggle free and run to the creature's arms, an action that caused Tony's heart to pound in his chest, as fear took hold of him. It was only when Rogers managed to get on his legs and stand up that Tony managed to unfreeze himself, stumbling back as he tried to put as much distance between Rogers and Morgan.
"Did you know Mr. Stark years ago, Mommy?" Peter asked with excitement, his words making both adults pauses before they smiled at the boy, Tony with nervousness and Steve with mischief, as he leaned toward his son like he was going to share a secret, ignoring Tony who was looking at him with pleading eyes as he tried to pull him from his sleeve like five years old child.
So what do you think?
"What do you want me to think then?!" Tony stuttered backing away from the angry ghost until his back hit a wall behind him, shivering when his way out of here became blocked by an angry ghost. "It's not like anyone married an Addams in fifty years, maybe seventy! No one knows anything about your clan, other than you terrorizing Normal people and probably killing them for fun! Of course, no one will dare to marry an Addams knowing that!" Tony tried to defend himself, hoping that the ghost in front of him won't get angrier than she already was. "And with my rotten luck of course I will land in an abusive relationship again! As if my last relationship and the one before it didn't prove that already!" Tony huffed, only to raise an eyebrow as the dolls gasped with Serpentine, letting their knives drop once more… OK, what's wrong with those rats?
"Peter!" Tony cried out as he rushed toward his son and Steve, this time Peggy and Bucky let go of him; not that Tony would have cared, he would have rushed toward his son no matter what. Reaching the two, Tony pulled both Steve and Peter into his embrace, something that he will think about later. "You are alive, you are alive, oh, God, oh, God." Tony sobbed as he pulled the two of them tightly into his embrace, ignoring the embarrassment that wanted to make itself known, and just take in his baby, who looked a little ruffled but overall fine.
Steve stiffens a sob as he clenched his hands into fists, trying to think of a way to right what happened not a few hours ago. If what his stalker said was true… if it even held a speckle of truth in it; it all means that Tony was finally leaving Steve, his husband was going to leave him alone and follow Howard's orders, leaving Steve caring for their daughter until she gets old enough to ask him why her father was not with them, which by then his daughter would know that this was Steve's fault.
"You are late." Everyone flinched and glanced around when they heard the voice reverberating through the walls, when they raised their heads they saw that Steven was already watching them, resting with his back to the wall with Bucky sleeping soundly his head in Steven's lap, who was gazing at them with crimson eyes, binding them in place, and for a second they all feared what will take a place. After Steven was done with the last Hydra agent, Edith finally cleared the lockdown, permitting the Avengers to run after Steven, and by that point, no one actually preferred to go in dread of what the man will do to them, but in the end, they accept it and get ready to head to Hydra's HQ, and hopefully, by then Steven will be back like how he was before.

At least I hope…
Steve gasped, his eyes flying open as he looked around the room in panic, it took Steve a few seconds before his eyes finally focused on the shadow that was on top of him, revealing that the person who was standing over him was Tony… Tony whose hand was hovering above Steve's shoulder, hesitating to touch him; it must have been a terrifying nightmare if the concerned and panic looks Tony was sending him was anything to go by.
Steven scuffed and turned his head away, no matter how much he defended himself against those who always used the name-calling as their weapon, no one ever cared or listen to him other than Sara, nothing was going to change no matter how he tried, so why waste his breath trying to reason with nothing but scraps of metal that there was truth to his words? It didn't stop the words from hurting though… "Yeah, that's what they always say, don't worry, it's not you, it's always the handsome ones that have something wrong in the head… even my ex… sure, he was cute at the start, but he turned psycho when I got pregnant, granted that I turned out to be intersex in the end, but still, he was crazy." The metal creature said which made Steven blink his eyes and turned to eye the creature… pregnant? So it was a female… but how can she become pregnant when she was made of metal? Steven's eyes widen at the realization, she was wearing protection armor!
"It's Daddy! Daddy, going to eat you if you said his name wrong again~" Tony laughed, nuzzling his baby's chubby cheeks, ignoring the squeaks and squeals Morgan let out as she laughed and tried to free herself; his baby was a fast learner, making Tony proud that the girl in his arms could already walk and talk, though what Tony doesn't appreciate is being called 'Mama' when Tony never ever once spoke that word in front of his daughter, making him concern about the whereabouts of her picking that word.
"…'s t-that… w-why y…ou arr… p-poisoning me?" Steve asked, humor shining in his eyes, even when the pain was holding to him and squeezing his heart with its claws that created nothing but death; the annoying look Howard sends his way, made Steve feel amuse more than scared when the needle pierced his skin. In the back of his mind, Steve wondered if Howard would have been different, warmer, more loving, and more supportive if the Omega he loved didn't leave him for money.
"So you are leaving…" A voice spoke from behind causing Steve to flinch and turn around, only relaxing when he saw Bucky standing behind him, a frown on his face as his arms were crossed over his chest, making Steve shift in his place, feeling guilty like he has done something naughty he shouldn't do, which was irrational considering that Steve was an adult and he can do whatever he wants.
Margaret said in a shaky voice as she leans away a little to show Steven Angela and young Philips as they were huddling next to their family members tightly.
that refuse to fade no matter how much Steven will it, it was still there, scowling at him and being annoying like a bug that was tough to kill no matter how much Steven try to end it. He wonders when his life shifted into a joke. Centuries ago, Steven would have dived at the chance to be with Anton like this, to take a lifetime with him, being together in any way, shape, form; but lifetimes of grief and heartbreak tamed that desire until there was nothing but bitterness and pain.
"Maybe another time, sweetheart; I promised Margaret to help her today, do you not remember?" Steven tried to persuade his son, which gained him a giant pout as the boy gazed at the crowd surrounding the bear before he let out a sigh and nod his head reluctantly, probably sensing that Steven doesn't want to stay here any longer. "Thank you, sweetheart…" Steven whispered before he leaned down to kiss his babe's forehead; standing Steven turned to Nicolaus who was talking in a hushed voice with Nattalegg. "Nicolaus, I apologies for my hast, but I need to leave to check on my people," Steven said, trying not to roll his eyes at the way Nattalegg's eyes widen in shock when Steven used the man's given name. "Oh, and before I forget, my name now is Steven, so please use it," Steven whispered to Nicolaus, causing the man to frown as he opened his mouth to protest, but in the end, the man just closed his mouth and nod in acceptance, he would probably question Steven about that later but until then the Omega has time.
"Steve please, calm down, Tony couldn't come because the city was under attack, please." Bucky said after he closed the door looking at Steve who was glaring daggers at him angry at Bucky for daring to interrupt him, something that Bucky knew he will receive the cold shoulder for, for the next three weeks.
And from a scale of 1 to 10 which Addams do you think is the creepiest in this fic?
"It went great, Ma!" Steve stated with an equally wide grin, and Tony tried hard not to grimace as the memory of the cemetery and Stane flashed through his mind. Tony really wanted to hit Steve for that big fat lie, but Tony paused for a second; every date ending in a murder is a success in the Addams family view… he thinks… "Tony agreed to a second date!" Tony took a step back when Steve sighed like a schoolgirl and gazed at Tony with heart in his eyes… OK, it's getting a little bit freaky, especially when Serpentine squealed in delight.
"I am an idiot…" Steve murmured to himself ignoring how Peggy and Bucky looked at each other in concern before turning to Steve. "I should probably apologize to Tony and tell him I am not coming, this is stupid, I can't even step my right foot in front of my left without tripping." Steve bite the inside of his cheek, wondering how stupid was he, asking Tony out for a dance when he couldn't help but trip every time he tried to take the step needed for the dance, not to forget about the twirling, it was a nightmare on its own.
"You are right… I hate it when you are right…" Tony grumbled which gained him a knowing smirk from his husband, causing his pout to increase and only to stop when Steve leaned down to kiss him. "You know… I really need a distraction right now… why don't we find the next poor soul and bury him into our cemetery…" Tony whispered seductively, which caused Steve to grin and let a dark laugh at the thought of torturing the first person they saw.
Was the whispered sob Steve managed to hear when he regain consciousness, which ended up with even more confusion as to when did Steve managed to go to sleep, he was sure he was in the gardens not a few seconds ago enjoying the peace, then how was he here? Slowly, Steve opened his eyes, turning to the side to see what the fuss was all about; near the door, Steve spotted Bucky standing near a familiar woman and a baby, 'Becky and Stephen' Steve's mind supplied, causing the Omega to narrow his eyes and before closing them, deciding to act asleep until he made sense of the jumbled mess that was his mind.
"Good." Tony said after he finished chowing and swallowing the food, feeling more relaxed than he did last night, which was kinda strange considering that he doesn't remember how he slept on the floor when he was sure he went to sleep on his bed. "It was calm; though my back hurts a lot, probably need to change the mattress." Tony justified his sleeping on the floor, is that the bed was bad enough that the brunette decided the floor is nicer than spending a second too long on it. "It was cold too…" Tony grumbled which made Natasha paused and shook her head.
Ever since Steve has suddenly disappeared from his workshop Tony was worried, I mean the Winter Soldier himself told him that he was interested in him, even called him 'My Dear' in Italian (How did the man even know he was half an Italian?) of course Tony was weary, he was talking about a man who has a strange fascination with death, who coos at the thought of humans body parts, and who probably got turned on by torture! He had seen enough footage on the Addams family to be sure of that, eating knives for breakfast was just the beginning.
That's what Steve was planning when he went to the workshop to drag Tony out. Steve planned on asking Tony to be his partner for the ball before another person did. Steve knew that what he was doing was wrong, that it meant he was relapsing once more and was bond to have his heart broken again in the end. Steve knew he was reverting to the years he couldn't help but watch Anton as he lived and died, again and again, getting his heart broken over and over again; but this time, the heart break will be more crushing and painful, especially when Steve finally tasted what it was like to live with Anton and his family, a family that accepted him for who he was.
He opened the door and his breath hitches as he saw Steve, he was lying on the sofa, singing like he doesn't have a care in the world, his voice was so beautiful; when Steve turned to him he smiled gently making Clint's heart pound in his chest, as he enters the room and closes the door after himself…
"Hey, kid!" Tony called out as he walked toward the boy, hoping that the kid wouldn't run and make his day more difficult than it was a few minutes ago. When the boy turned toward him, Tony blink in surprise and horror when he saw that the kid was no one but Harley Keener, Peter's friend… Tony couldn't help but look around hoping that he had missed Harley's caretaker by chance, hoping that what he was thinking wasn't true; when Tony found no one besides Harley or someone looking for him, he swallowed biting the inside of his cheek.
It ends up with Tony finally accepting his friends' help. It ends up with Winnie coming to his home with Clint one day, to help cleaning his house, it ends up with them entering the house only to see Tony cleaning the house from top to bottom, emptying the alcohol bottles in the sink, it ends up with Clint hugging him tightly and Winnie crying in happiness.
"Hey, Steve…" Tony started, clearing his throat when Steve tilts his head toward him with a questioning look. "Tomorrow, Peter and I are going to the park; if you want you can come with us…" Tony shifted as he said these words, trying to stop his face from turning red.
"Why didn't you contact me to tell me that you two are alive?" Was the first thing out of Tony's mouth, because one thing was known for sure, and that was Tony's patient was running thinner and thinner as time passed. Because seriously! How did his parents' hearts handle leaving him alone like that, letting him get tricked by Stane, ignoring his countless near-death situations that left Tony shaking, and wishing he was young once more living with his parents.
"I did… will Loki did… he is still raging about the news you brought and tried with everything he can to help; he wanted to take the queen and his people back to Asgard, but he could not for the queen refused his offer for the third time." Magna sighed, and Anton could only press his lips together. If only the queen will agree to go to Asgard, he will have a fresh start and try to forget about all this madness, but no one knew why he stay here in Mantta when he was clear on his hate for Anton.
"A-and what about Tony?" Jarvis said after wiping his tears making Steve sigh at that, leaning on the counter looking at the coffee machine.
Howard gave an annoying look directed at Bucky; Howard looked bored like he could be out doing a hundred different things worth his time than being here. "He is hurting without the serum, he is hurting with the serum; it's the same thing, only now he has a chance of survival." Howard narrowed his eyes as he stated these words making Bucky swallow hard, his hands curling around into fists. "If he died now, he died knowing that he fought against the poison that he has a chance against it; he won't die lying on his bed, knowing that whatever you will try to cook in a short time wouldn't work no matter how much you try." These words made Tony take a stuttering deep breath, trying to stop the shaking that took over his body from making him fall to the floor.
"OK… apology accepted." Tony said, running his hand through his hair, wondering how this was his life now, at first he was hit by a star, then the star turned out to be a human who hated him, then the star ended up giving him a chance after Peter gave him his puppy eyes? He seemed to have underestimated his baby's luck.
"It seems that you knew my counterpart well, son of Sarah." She said with a smile then that smile fell as she looked at Steven. "You must know that son of Sarah, the fates have strange ways of arranging things and one of them you being here. But what I don't understand is why? Why did you choose to stay in this world and let your body die in your universe? What did the fates show you?" she asked which made Steven pause at that.
"He is an Addams on his mother's side." Barnes waved them off as he let out another dreamy sigh when the video continued to play that scene of Rogers laughing like a villain in horror movies, and the cries in the background increased.
(See the end of the chapter for
Wait for the next chapter for more of the angsty stuff!
It was ten years since the last time he gave the sweet Omega anything but a fleeting thought; it has been so long since he got a reminder about the heartbreak he faced when the love of his life didn't show up on the day he promised him he would. He didn't show up on the day after it, or the month after it, or the years after that day; it only confirmed his theory, that the Omega he fell in love with has moved on, that he found someone who was stronger than Anton, smarter than Anton, someone who will give him whatever his heart desire, someone who will worship the ground that the sweet Omega walked on.
"Stop!" A dominating voice ordered him, causing Steven's body to freeze in terror, his Omega that was silent ever since he lost the babe in his belly shiver in terror; it had been years since Steven was affected by an Alpha growl, no Alpha was strong enough to control him. this voice though, this dominating voice that made terror crawl through Steven's spin made the Omega whine in Steven's mind, his breath stopping as he waited for the Alpha's next move. "Breath, calm down, breath…" The voice ordered more gently now than it was before, causing Steven to stutter as he took in his next breath.
The hand running through his hair though made him scrunch his nose because something was weird; for one, Tony was sure that no one was in the same room as him, it was just Tony and Steve, everyone else left them alone, the Avengers on a mission to catch Hydra, and his mother and the Jarvis family to watch over his son. For another, Howard informed them all that Steve may be in a coma, and it's unknown when he will wake up.
"I'm sorry Buck, I just… I couldn't drag you all and force your hand… so I ran away." Steve said letting go of Bucky giving him a sad smile, as much as it pains Steve to confess of this secret, he couldn't keep it inside anymore, not when Bucky was standing here in front of him, after thinking of him as dead for the past three years.
angry…" Tony's voice cracked as he spoke, feeling the truth in his statement, like an ultimate truth, and he knows, he knows that something bad was going to happen.
"What year did you die?" That was Natasha who took a step toward Steve? It was kind of getting confusing to call that man by the name Steve when their Steve was coming any minute now.
Steve sighed at that and dry washed his face looking at the counter before swallowing. "His mother was an Omega and she... she…" Steve ended up saying couldn't continue his words, which made Tony inhale sharply, working in the Omegas clinic and group therapy, Tony heard a lot of stories, and it broke his heart to say he heard a lot of sad stories, one of them the reason why some pups fear specific dynamics, he never thought Peter was one of them.
"You forget? You fucking forget?!" Tony shrieked as he rushed after Howard, ignoring how his mother was ordering him to stand down and leave his father alone. "Do you even realize what happened since you two decided to disappear from my life completely? It was hell! And you have the audience to act like everything is alright when you sold me to Stane and everyone else in a cold blood!" Snarls, hisses, and screams could be heard as Tony threw everything in his sight at Howard, ignoring how the man tried to run out of the living room.
"Do you wanna go home,
… Tony rolled his eyes; from the corner of his eye he can see Angie trying to stiff her laughter, Aunt Peggy was shaking her head at that waving to Jarvis to pour her more wine.
The Alpha winces at his mother's strong jab and he turned to the Omega with a small smile on his lips. "Hello, my name is James Barnes, but everyone calls me Bucky, nice to meet you." The Alpha said as he offered his hand to Tony, which made the Omega blink, and took his hand to shake it.
"Thor, please don't push me around, I don't think you will like it if the other guy came out and start smashing." Banner warned, which made Thor wince, and then his face paled when his eyes fell on Steven, making the blond close his eyes tightly, wishing that this was all a nightmare he will wake up soon from. "Hmm, he is going to be OK, it was just a sprained ankle, so don't worry it will heal in one to three weeks." Banner explained after he took Steven's exposed and injured foot and start inspecting it, it was only a few minutes later that the man finished wrapping it.
/Warning/: This chapter contains cursing, sadness, violence (?), feeling, near mentally breakdowns, mention of past abuse, maybe fluff? And Steve finally gets his shit together… And who knows what! All reviews are appreciated
Peter was still hiding behind him, making the Omega turn shakily to the boy and his heart… it shattered at the fat tears that were rolling down his baby's face. The Omega swallowed harshly before kneeling down, pulling the small pup in his arms as he soothed him by rocking him back and forth, which only made the small boy choke on his breath and thrust his face into Tony's neck. "Why… why are you crying baby?" Tony's voice cracked as he asked that question because for once, he already knew the answer.
So after kissing his son and telling him that he will be back soon, he left the young boy with his aunt (Thank God for Pepper or he would have run around the house screaming like a headless chicken) Tony was off to go with his team to fight Hydra, grimacing to himself when he saw Wanda in the mix, he got used to the woman planning their doom, always accusing them of killing her brother, when in fact her brother decided to join them and protect innocent lives sacrificing himself for that honorable cause.
Bucky glared at the man's back as he turned to Steve who was looking after Tony with a sad look on his face, making the man glare harder at Tony's back hoping that he will burn with the power of his glare alone. What did that man have and Bucky didn't? I mean, he knew Steve since the two of them were five and Steve taught him how to scare someone to death! (Literally speaking that is) "Forget about him Stevie, that man is nothing but trouble and heartbreak, you will live nothing but a miserable life if you went after him." Bucky said, only to realize his mistake when Steve let out a choked sound of happiness.
Steve was able to open his eyes by this point, and he frowns a little as he looked around the place, he looked like he was in a hospital room? No, it was impossible, hospitals' rooms weren't comfortable nor did they have this pleasant creamy color on the walls, hospitals were just white, and barren, and made Steve heartbreak over and over.
"Thank you…" Tony end up saying which made Bucky nod his head and head to the door. "J, make sure to use my bank account to pay all of Steve's debts, especially the hospital ones, and get me an appointment with Anna, she is the best Oncologist in America, also call Jarvis and tell him we are booking a private wing in his hospital…" Bucky only pause a little to hear some of Tony's orders, but hearing them made the Alpha let out a sigh of relief, there was hope for Steve and his pup, maybe it was wrong of him to go behind Steve's back to talk with Tony, maybe he shouldn't even have told the Alpha and just helped Steve on his own after all the Omega wanted to stay as far away from his Alpha, maybe him meddling will end up breaking everyone hearts, but maybe…
But it wasn't loud enough to cover the roar that made the hair on Steven's body stand on its end, even while being frozen in place, the Omega wondered if he was breathing at that moment because his chest was hurting, it was hurting so much the same as his midsection, a pain that seemed to go on and on.
The calm that greeted him, made Steve take a step back, his tears rushing down his face, as fear took hold of his heart, suffocating him until Steve was left breathless. "You are not, Bucky…" Steve whispered, already knowing that he was caught and hiding it would result in nothing but anger from the man on the other side. A part of Steve couldn't help but wonder how the man managed to replicas Bucky's voice; another part of him wondered if the man on the other side played a recorded tab in hope of confusing him.
"You cannot change everything though, for sooner or later you will have to face the consequences of your choice." Loki said as he picked up his book from where he left it on the table. "Was it worth it though? Being forced to be frozen in time, unchangeable, while everyone else ages and dies off, was it worth it seeing your husband die, in a few short decades when you could have had centuries here with him?" Loki asked curiously as he opened his book once more, looking at Steven.
"When will be the next time? Three months later? After the baby is born? After you ask for a divorce because you couldn't handle living with me and our child?" Steve asked, taking a sick pleasure in the shocked look that crossed over Tony's face. "I am tired of feeling like a whore whose only job is being a stress relieve, do you even know what it makes me feel when the only thing you want with me these days is sex?" Steve whispered, pulling his hands away from Tony making the Alpha stumble. "I didn't ask something impossible when I told you I want you with me today, this wasn't the first or the second appointment you miss, I'm sure if you asked around, everyone will tell you I am either a widow or a single parent because no one ever saw the husband I claim to be married to." Steve sniffed a little, wiping the moisture away from his eyes, hoping that he won't start crying any minute now.
The genius was grinning. He grabbed whatever he would need and made his way upstairs. It didn’t take long for everyone to crowd around and there were a lot more people that had shown up than Tony recognized.
“Because it’s a commitment that can interfere with your prior and far more important commitments. Do I need to remind you just how much your hands are insured for? Something as frivolous as playing in a band can end up doing serious damage. What would you even do with your life if you could no longer play the piano and do these performances?”
“I think you should take a break from your work, Tony.”
He would always be that little kid from Brooklyn who couldn’t walk away from a fight. Too bad he didn’t have that same kind of bravery when dealing with the opposite sex.
“Harder for who? For you?”
Tony picked it up and took a sniff. “Steve, what the hell?” He sniffed again. “This is...this is my favorite.” He sipped at it to make sure his nose wasn’t playing tricks on him. “That’s fucking delicious. But still, what the hell?”
“You should come and eat now.”
Steve made the last few steps so that he was close enough to place a hand on Tony’s shoulder. “But you didn’t. You were stronger than them, better than them. You escaped and you made your way here all on your own, Stark. That’s something only a small few can accomplish.” Steve squeezed once and let his hand fall. “You have more friends in your corner than you think-- Pepper, Rhodey, us – all we want is to keep you safe. That’s what we’re in this for now, not what you can make us, but for you.”
“I’ve heard different versions of the same compliment my entire life.”
The blond just stared at the ceiling and frowned. Maybe he forgot to hit send on his text but he distinctly remembered a marriage proposal. Once he found the courage to move, he reached for his phone, and since it was connected to a charger, he could only assume Bucky had thoughtfully done that for him as well.
“Blasphemy,” the blond quipped.
“It’s not wanting to do its job.”
“I’m starting to think I’ve made a mistake,” Tony said, not at all serious.
Dinner passed by with a lot less heckling from Tony than Steve expected, but that probably had more to do with the fact that he told Tony he’d be withholding part of his birthday present until a later date. That had caused the brunet to pout a bit and Steve enjoyed that a little too much.
Tony didn’t look like he could have kept a smile off his face even if he tried. “So…I’m alive.”
Steve turned his attention away from the road, trusting Clint to do whatever it took to get there, and instead began laying out a game plan for when they arrived.
“Steve, I shouldn’t have gotten so upset because…” he trailed off.
Tony’s eyebrows shifted upwards slightly and he pulled Steve to sit next to him in the small booth. He leaned against the soldier as he idly sipped his drink. He could feel the heat radiating off of Steve and the way his muscles would flex from time to time.
“Need help?” Clint offered.
“Well you should be! I know you, Tony! I should have known you were doing something to help but I was so focused on being frustrated that you didn’t seem to want to make time for us!”
“Kiddo, we need to leave soon. We have to go meet Pepper with Happy because they want to talk about wedding stuff again.”
Steve took a breath, tried to calm himself. “Do you think Natasha was pretending to be angry, to feel upset when she had to share the information they found with you? Do you think she’d still let it bother her if she didn’t care even a little bit about what happens to you? Do you expect me to believe that that the friendship you’ve developed with Bucky isn’t real? That he only trusts you so completely with his well being that he took a nap the last time you were working on his arm because you made him a new gun? What about all the nights I’ve caught you, Sam, Clint and Thor piled together playing Mario cart on the couch? Was that all a product of the thing’s you’ve made for them?” Steve took another halting step forward. “If I or anyone else didn’t want you here, you wouldn’t be here, in my office and in my home, no matter what it is or was that you offered me.”
“You’re not going to ask?”
Steve rested his arm against his legs and leaned forward so he was closer to Tony’s eye level. “I’d love that. I bet you make amazing things.”
Steve rolled his eyes heavenward and sighed. “He’s not exactly wrong.”
Steve rubbed his hand over his face tiredly. He and Tony had stopped speaking to each other over a week ago, but he couldn’t even understand why he had been angry before. He certainly wasn’t angry with Tony now. Sure, what he said had hurt a little...okay a lot, but it was possible that he’d taken it completely out of context. It didn’t help that Tony had become angry with him just as quickly.
“I’m here to steal your thunder.”
“No, but…”
He followed the directions given to him by the AI and stared out the windows in wonder.
“You kinda are.”
Bucky smirked and nudged Steve with his elbow. “That was a very nerdy fact. Be honest, how many times did Tony have to explain that to you?”
That was new.
Never let it be said that Tony Stark could not find yet another reason to hate himself considering his list was already pretty long to begin with.
“Don’t make it sound like such a hassle. You know I’m impatient.”
“Oh! A Christmas Story is on television right now!” Clint all but dragged Natasha and Bruce from the room, the miracle being that neither of them protested or even harmed him.
The blond gave him a tiny smile. “Yeah. I missed you too.”
Steve gave his team orders to split up into the crowd and help where they could and to take out anyone they suspected of being HYDRA. Steve himself made his way toward the entrance of SI, weaving through the line of police with not much effort expended when they were mostly distracted with firing back at those firing at them. Steve ducked and weaved until he was at the door, slipped quickly passed a fireman carrying an unconscious man over his shoulder and made his way into the lobby. His eye caught on strawberry blonde hair flashing around the corner followed closely by a balding man in a suit.
The genius smiled, seemingly despite himself, and nudged Steve with his elbow. “Look, I just think that given the chance, you should go after whatever it is that makes you happy instead of worrying about everyone else around you. You’re a good guy, Ca—Steve. Even when taking into account all the times you’ve been an ass.”
Tony opened and closed his mouth a few times before speaking, “Obie ordered a hit on my parents. It wasn’t an accident. It was HYDRA.” Tony’s chair fell back with a bang as he stood up. “Fuck!” he yelled, kicking the table as hard as he could, causing some of the pages to float down to the floor. “They were friends! He killed my parents and they were friends! He made it look like a goddamn accident all because he thought I needed a fucking push, old blood out new blood in. At least I would be easier to control than dad.”
Steve shook his head. “Nuh uh. You first.”
In retrospect, maybe he shouldn’t have had so much to drink earlier.
“Stay here!” Steve shouted back, jogging down the halls and out the door to meet up with his team.
With a sigh he looked down at the piano and smiled as the song he decided to go with came to him suddenly. He started off playing as slow as possible, taking his time on the first few notes. When he felt a presence nearby was when he started playing it in normal time and was certain his face was going to crack with the force of the smile he was trying to hold back. The one thing he knew for certain was to never play all your cards at once. Keep them close to your chest and reveal them gradually over time to maintain a sense of mystery. Part of it was also knowing that the one person you placed all your trust in, loved with all your heart, was completely capable of destroying you with the knowledge they gain from knowing you should that relationship ever go sour. So Tony told himself to hold on tightly to those cards for as long as possible.
“Are they sad?”
Tony gave him a blank stare. “Oh...kay? I mean are we talking ab--but you do realize that--” Wow he was struggling.
“You seemed a little intimidated by the thought.”
“Keep him safe.”
“I thought we covered this part already.”
Rhodey clapped Tony on the shoulder and shook him gently. “You’re alive, Tony. And here with us. If you think we’re just going to let you run off on your own and get involved with who knows what, then you don’t know us as well as I thought you did. You’re in this, so now we’re in this.”
“Where the Wild Things Are!”
“We will vanquish any foe of ours, Captain!” Thor all but roared through the comm.
Natasha cleared her throat. “We could go to a movie.”
“I hope not.”
Rhodey mock shuddered. “I wish I could say MIT was one giant blur but…” he trailed off, shaking his head forlornly.
Bucky slapped his hand to his chest, right over his heart. “That hurt, bro. I thought we had something special.”
Sam interrupted him, catching on quickly to Tony’s sudden mood. “I think most of them were near death anyway. Not that that’ll make you feel much better, but they were in pretty bad shape beforehand. The videos…” Sam trailed off, holding up a small thumb drive, “they’re all here. We think they were used as motivation to get outside parties to comply to HYDRA’s wishes.” Sam stared down at the drive, shooting a quick glance between Thor and Bucky who both had their eyes firmly down towards the table. “You’re on here, Tony.”
Tony dug his hands into Steve’s arm. “Trying to walk into my room without being attacked was my original goal but now I’d settle for just making it to my bed sometime soon, join me if you have to but I’m not really into breath play—“
Pepper just smirked.
And really, Steve couldn’t say no to that. There was time for serious talks later.
“Me too,” Tony responded softly. “I haven’t had this much fun in awhile.”
The look on Steve’s face was amused exasperation, but something clicked just as Tony was climbing into the car.
The genius continued to place warm kisses along the column of Steve’s throat, his reply quiet. “Bet your sexy ass we are. So. Much. Talking.”
Bucky smirked. “Ready to be heroes?”
Steve was currently mandhandling him into the bedroom though, and that was one action he was more than okay with.
“So do you have a name or are all genies just referred to as Genie?”
-----
Tony shrugged, “I guess that’s up to you. What do you want?”
“The plot thickens. Is this your friend?”
Steve let Bruce do his thing for a good minute before speaking. “Okay, Stark. Talk.”
“This...Steve, this is amazing. Stop blushing. Wait. Forget I said that. The stop blushing part. It’s still amazing. You drew this from memory.”
“Never mind. We can keep pining after each other in secret if you want, but I’d sort of like to kiss you now.”
Steve and Bucky broke off next, jogging until they reached the warehouse’s entrance. They paused at the threshold. “I’ll take the right you take the left, we’ll meet up in the middle. Keep your guns ready and—“
That didn’t seem to make Steve feel any better and Tony frowned.
That might have taken Tony by surprise. Just a little. “Really?”
Someone had suggested all of them sit down together for a Thanksgiving dinner. Tony, who had been tinkering with a new communication device, suddenly found himself the focus of five sets of eyes and he had to pause for a moment to remember why. Oh, right. Thanksgiving.
Tony was silent for a moment. “Yeah. Yeah I do,” he said thoughtfully.
No one owned up. Jerks.
Skull dropped to the ground like a brick, body limp, laying in a pool of blood that didn’t seem to be slowing down in growth.
Tony smiled. “Uh...surprise.”
Which is exactly what happened because Tony was apparently having one of those days. It wasn’t a heated kiss. It wasn’t hard. It wasn’t desperate. If was soft and almost chaste, but it lingered and Tony wanted to make it into something so much more.
Steve’s eyebrows drew in. “Wait, what? No.” Steve began walking toward the door. “Follow me. And don’t think for a second that we aren’t going to be talking about what you just said the second we get back home. You and Clint both.”
“What is it?”
“It isn’t like that.”
Steve pressed in just a little bit harder and growled. “What the hell do you think you’re doing?”
With lightning quick reflexes only reserved for those who believe they’ve located their own personal holy grail, Tony picked it up and looked closely. After a moment he shook it and discovered there was no liquid. Just a rock or something. Figures.
So he avoided saying anything at all.
They were just about to doze off again when a noise from up above grabbed Steve’s attention, the soldier sitting up quickly. He had just enough time to pull the blanket up to his chest when the frigid air caused him to shiver as the door was kicked in.
“Do you really think shutting it down is going to make things better though?”
“What?”
Bucky snorted from Steve’s side. “Please tell me his score was higher than Clint’s.”
“What are you waiting for?”
Steve shrugged, giving Tony a strange look. “Christmas tradition and all of that.”
“You won’t be getting rid of me so easily, Rogers,” the genius mumbled as he tried to tame the shivering a little bit.
He jumped when there was a loud set of raps on the door. Reflex had him grabbing his gun and aiming it at the door, hands steady and eyes narrowed. Nobody should have been able to get far enough to knock on his front door, he had guards for christ sakes. Or he'd had guards, he’d have to check on that.
“And who’s going to get up and do that?”
Steve pocketed the taser with a huff. “Just the once.” He surveyed the room one last time before gesturing for Bucky to follow him down another hallway. “We should do another sweep of the place, Tony has to b—“
“Peter, we need to go. Pepper’s texting me like crazy because we aren’t there yet.”
Steve pulled Tony to his lap and kissed him roughly again just to get him to shut up. Tony knew Steve wasn’t opposed to dirty talk. Rather, he was more concerned that the dirty talk alone was going to cause him to come, and as much as Tony knew he wanted to, he also knew that Steve got off on Tony teasing him for hours at a time.
“I’ve always been interested in learning the traditions of Midgardians. I, too, shall volunteer as sweater tribute.”
“Yeah.” Silence. “But we’ll be close to each other. We can see each other almost any time we want really. And I sort of might want to find a roommate because I don’t like being alone.” He was giving Steve a hopeful look.
“You don’t actually have to wait here with me you know, especially if you’re just going to judge me.”
Steve’s face was blank. “Could have fooled me.”
“All right,” Steve started, “introduction time. Everyone knows Tony Stark. Stark, this is my team. Well some of my team. They are first response if you need them.”
Bruce tweaked his glasses and frowned down at the pages. “This, this is a failed exploration into gamma radiation and more specifically the effects of reversing contamination of living subjects whose health effects have accumulated at an accelerated rate. I still haven’t figured out how these specific subjects experienced accelerated cell production causing the radiation poisoning to spread as fast as it has, but I thought I was getting closer until I hit right around-“ he pointed at the table where a little bit of writing had spilled off the page, “here.”
“Tony. Not exactly the person I pictured you falling for, but more power to you, my friend.”
Steve watched him go. He hadn’t meant for Tony to leave and he was sort of hoping to fill the brunet in on their plans, but the kid looked tired and Steve knew he was probably having trouble sleeping. After a moment he sat at the table and took the tea Bruce offered him.
“This is embarrassing and if you keep it up you’re going to humiliate this entire family. We’re talking about this later.”
The genius gave a shrug. “Might as well put my talents to use.”
Steve just decided to play along.
Steve gave Tony just long enough to finish the last bit of instrumental ending before he walked briskly toward the bench. He took hold of Tony’s arm and pulled him up, his smile brighter than it had been in awhile and he knew he was blushing but he didn’t care. Instead he cupped the side of Tony’s face with one hand while the other made its way to the back of his head and he pulled the brunet into chaste but intense kiss. Tony’s arms eventually folded around his neck and Steve broke the kiss and rested his own forehead against Tony’s.
Tony reached up to meet Steve’s lips again before pulling away slowly with a wicked smirk. “I expect you to blow my mind away again.”
Natasha offered a small wave. Tony gave her a look. “Do not make any bets with my child tonight, Natasha. Do you understand?”
“And Steve? There are so many reasons why I’m thankful for you.”
“I’ll be back in a week if you still want to see me when I come home.”
“Don’t tell her that. You’ll end up becoming best friends and plotting against me.”
Steve eyed Tony and grinned just a little. “You don’t say.”
"Stark, you should stay out of it unless you finally want that beating you deserve."
As the minutes ticked past their scheduled appointment with still no word from either Nat or Clint, Tony’s pacing picked up speed. He began muttering under his breath as he walked, something about titanium alloy being the key component to full body armor. Tony paused his steps and stared down at the floor before shaking his head, continuing to mutter, this time disputing his earlier claim due to how bulky said full body armor would be unless you wanted to look like some sort of superhero.
Natasha snickered silently and Clint patted Steve on the shoulder. “It’s okay, Cap.”
He was getting ahead of himself though. He had to form some sense of a relationship with Steve before he reached that point. Meaning that he needed to become his friend first. He turned his head slowly toward the door with a smile as he began singing.
Steve would have to give up on him at some point right?
Tony planted his feet on the floor and stood up from the bed. Bruce had been nice enough to loan him a pair of pajama pants, bright purple, and a t-shirt, that Bruce assured him wasn’t his, that said Hammer Industries on it. Tony had scowled down at the shirt before letting Bruce know that he wasn’t above accidentally setting it on fire or possibly pouring bleach on it. Or both at the same time. Bruce hadn’t seemed too worried about the threat.
“Sir, Ms. Potts is on the line. She says it’s urgent.”
Steve spread his hands slightly. “With all due respect, ma’am, what I’m getting out of this is of no concern at the moment. If Tony wishes to divulge that information at a later date, then the choice is his. I find it better to focus on what we have in common, that being that we are all determined to keep Tony safe, no matter how it is we as individuals have come to that consensus.”
That one snuck up on him.
I wasn’t who you were looking for when we met, and I felt like I was reliving my childhood all over again. I was never the brave and upstanding human being you were and I’m not the...whatever the hell Howard was before he became my father. Sometimes I wonder if his change was my fault. He wanted a legacy, he just didn’t want to do the part where he had to raise it himself.
Tony held it up for all others to see, smirking at Clint.
“Steve! This lovely woman here is Natasha. The drummer for The Avengers. Natasha, this is Steve Rogers, my best friend and bass player for The Howling Commandos.”
“Did I do something wrong?” Tony asked quietly.
“What about The Avengers? Your schedule is so booked that it’s a wonder you have any time to do it now.”
“Tony,” Steve whispered. He was placing small kisses against Tony’s temple and rocking back and forth. “Tony, you didn’t know. Don’t ever tell me again that you’re not good enough. I’m disgusted with what it did to you, but not with you.”
“When are you leaving for Massachusetts?” Steve questioned.
Natasha pulled out a thumb drive from her pocket and handed it to Tony. “I’m not sure how much of that you’ll want to see, Stark.” When Tony just stared between her and the drive, she continued. “JARVIS says hi by the way and that he’s rather pleased to learn that you are, in fact, okay.” Nat turned away when Tony visibly swallowed. “He wanted us to inform you that the bots are doing fine and he’s been keeping things updated and ready for your return.”
Steve quickly put the jacket on and shoved the flyer into his pocket. “Are you sure you don’t need me tonight?”
Natasha cursed a string of words that would make a pimp blush.
Tony acted first, shoving Steve down onto the bed before climbing over him. Steve pulled Tony down into the filthiest kiss he’d ever gotten from the soldier and moaned before helping Steve out of all of his clothes as well.
“You too, Tony. Good luck with the whole band thing and all that.”
Rhodey opened his mouth but Pepper was the first to speak. “How--- Tony, how did that happen?”
Tony laughed out loud at that. “All I ever think about is me.”
“I wasn’t able to get to you before you were hit. Some jackass had stolen a woman’s purse and shoved you out of the way to get past us. I ended up grabbing him and...it kept me from getting to you. I shouldn’t have…” he sighed. “I should have gone for you first.”
Steve gave Bucky a concerned look, wondering what he’d told this girl, but Bucky just shrugged his shoulders and gave the slightest shake of his head. He turned his attention back to Sharon.
“Okay so there’s that. Whatever. You’re clearly upset so I’m going to avoid arguing with you right now.”
“Yeah. I think I do.”
Steve looked over Tony’s shoulder and glanced at the coffee maker. “I like this one. Don’t break it. Maybe you should be nicer to it and it’ll give you what you want. Threatening it is only going to make it angry.”
Steve just shook his head. “Someone I accidentally texted last night. Now he won’t leave me alone.”
A small noise escaped Steve's throat, completely lost for words.
He owed a lot of people new cars.
Rhodey and Pepper shared a look over Tony’s head.
Tony risked the brisk air to reach out for Steve’s utility belt and jerked it over before opening one of the pockets and pulling out a small bottle of lube.
Tony had to hold in the laugh that was threatening to come out. He nodded and gave Obie a look of defeat. He didn’t know about Steve. He didn’t know that Steve was a genie. “It looks like you got me good this time, Stane.”
Steve kicked the next guard he saw square in the jaw and kept moving until he reached a large open space full of HYDRA goons standing about as if they had nothing better to do with their time.
"Thanks. I guess."
Tony didn’t say anything for minutes that stretched on for what felt like forever and Steve started to worry that he’d said the wrong thing again. When Tony spoke it was almost a relief. “You’re annoying sometimes, Cap.”
Tony just continued to talk. Apparently this was something he has always enjoyed doing. “He said that you have a special serum that made you strong and that it can’t be made again, but I think he is mean and he doesn’t listen to me anyway. I told him I could be like you anyway and he said that would never happen.”
“It’s okay that you miss him. You can whine about it if you want to.”
Tony was grinning. He looked excited for the first time since Steve had met him and he was proud to know he’d managed to put that look on Tony’s face in the first place. He held out his hand for the sketchbook and waited for Tony to hand it to him.
Steve checked the time again and barely had time to agree before Bucky was gone. Again. And now he had no idea what to do for fifteen minutes. People were filtering out of the place at the moment and he didn’t want to risk losing sight of Bucky for too long. He wasn’t entirely sure if he was allowed to pass through the door that led to the backstage area, but he did. It might be a little quieter at least and less people to stand near.
He looked up at Steve, heart now pounding against his ribcage. “This is...”
Tony held his palm up like he was waiting to be handed something. “Show me.”
“I have to plan ahead and prepare for all the surprises you like to throw at me.”
Rhodey and Pepper shared a heavy look before they both turned to meet Steve’s gaze, the beginnings of approval shining through their mistrust.
“Thanks for uh...today. I don’t think this is typical for most genies.”
As the footsteps got louder, Steve’s finger got closer to the trigger, prepared to pull it until he made out a familiar glint of metal. He sighed quietly; it was just Bucky. He lowered his weapon and spoke lowly once Bucky was in range. “What have you got?”
“You make suffering look less like suffering and more like whining.”
“So you’re a genie?”
“So you don’t like it?”
“Good. Then you won’t have a problem filling me in after I tell you all about Natasha.”
“Do you realize how ridiculous you sound right now?”
“Most of them are still unfinished. So there are a lot of lines in there that don’t belong, so they probably look pretty odd right now, but they’ll look better when I’m finished.”
