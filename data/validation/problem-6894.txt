Sighing, he nods. "Of course I did. I guess it's just lucky she was the one around instead of Clint, that would've
"Yeah, I love 'em. Drives my personal trainer crazy," he laughs gently and follows Steve to the kitchen. As the other man gets the machine going, he comes up behind him and gently but firmly takes him by the hips. "Did you ever dance, Steve? Back in the forties?"
Steve jogs a bit to catch up, meeting Bucky's speed once he's at his side. "Hey, hey, come on. Talk to me, please."
Grinning this time, Bucky slams his metal hand next to Tony's face, the grin turning into a smirk when he flinches instinctively. "Don't test me, Stark. I might just decide to shut you up again."
Instead of giving a verbal answer, Steve just tries the next one and moans again, eyes glazed over with joy. "Thank you, Tony."
Against his better judgement--that is to say, his pride--Tony gets up and heads out of the building.
"... And I've been the only thing standing in the way since your reunion. Fuck, that's some mixed emotions right there..."
Tony doesn't break the kiss as he gets to his feet, pushes Steve all the way back on his chair, and straddles his lap. He drapes his arms over Steve's shoulders and pours himself into the kiss equally.
Steve can't help but chuckle at Tony's inability to shut up. Bucky does the same but for some reason it's a much more unnerving sound, coming from him.
Bucky is quite surprised as well but he smiles and just focuses on taking Tony apart some more. Reaching for some machine oil they had used earlier for his arm, he slicks up the way for his fingers to lessen the burn while Steve runs one hand through Tony's hair. "This... this is something I could never give you this good," he says quietly, almost in awe at what's happening. "But you have no idea how much I wanna see it."
Smoothly, "Oh? Why's that? You think you've mastered it for yourself, or something?" He holds the door open for Bucky.
Steve's face twists into an ugly snarl and he finally sinks low enough to do something he's never done before. Playing dirty. Leaning in close enough Tony can feel his hot breath on his neck, Steve whispers. "Oh, I think you misunderstood something along the way. If anything, Bucky is going to
"You wanna take what you can get, huh?" With a crooked smirk, Buck strokes over the side of Steve's face. "Kiss me and tell me when you fell for me."
"Every right to break your heart? I'm not stupid Steve, I'm also not blind. You guys love each other."
"You'll probably find you have a bit more strength and finer control over just how much of it you use, plus a small upgrade in fine motor skills. Guess you'll be even
"Then I'd say see if you can bring me down like that and you can do whatever you want. The winner takes it all." He kisses over Tony's pulse, knowing all too well that Steve could come back any time but actually somewhat wanting him to see this. "If I win, however..."
Bucky snarls angrily and Steve can't help but flinch a little, knowing exactly what's going to happen.
Tony glances towards the balcony for a second, then looks back at Steve. "This whole... what you walked in on, it started with Barnes wanting
"You want Steve to break you?" Buck absently licks his lips. "I'm pretty sure I could teach him how to. And from what I know about him... he secretly loves dirty talk. All those filthy words he never uses himself. Maybe take it from there."
Tony lets that question sit with him for a minute. If he's honest with himself, he absolutely wants to have sex with Steve as soon as humanly possible. He'd do it right this second if that were an option. It takes a moment for him to pull himself into reasonable wants and expectations. "I'm looking to spend a nice night together, and show my... my physical interest in whatever way feels good for you."
"The fact that you're my friend is the reason I answered. I trust you to respect my privacy. Most of the time." Steve smirks a little, thinking about all the cameras he found in his apartment and how he threw them in Tony's face. "But if you're offering, are you fine with all of it?"
Tony rolls his eyes, but it's an affectionate sort of thing coming from him. A silent admittance that he can't actually argue with that. "I... a lot of reasons. But I feel like you're dodging my questions."
Steve is just slipping his boots on when there's a knock at the door that makes his heart skip a beat. He opens up promptly, smile wide and warm. Things between him and Tony have been going really well, and he
It's a struggle, his whole being has craved attention like this his whole life. But that's not who he is, he's not that kind of guy. "Yes. Stop." Suddenly, he's back to his firm, commanding voice, even if it's still rough with arousal.
Now Bucky isn't the only one getting hard. When he's not doing it as self-destructive self-punishment, being on the receiving end of Bucky's wrath is actually pretty hot "Really?" Tony says, unimpressed. "That's all you've got? Some half-assed, what is that, threat? To fuck me, bragging about stamina we both know your balls are too small to actually be capable of."
There's a long, stunned silence between them. Bucky blinks a few times, trying to make sense of what he's hearing. Feeling even. When he finally finds his voice again, it's rough. "And what about Stark? He's your boyfriend."
"While I watch?" Tony asks with an arched eyebrow and a bit of a grumble. "What, you wanna rub in even more how much I'll never be what you are to him or something? Jesus."
God, it's sweet of Bucky to say that about him and he's blushing but trying not to dwell on it. "Without question. Hate to break it to you though, Barnes, but I got off on
But while Steve has always been a truly good man and Bucky a lot more of a bad boy, he can't help but be the voice of reason for his brother. "Steve, that's incredibly sweet but what if he realizes he can't?"
He's still not sure what that's about but Steve smiles. "Of course you'll get that. I really like kissing you. And talking to you in general, even through text messages."
"I'd make you forget everything else. Choke you until you almost pass out before I bring you back by crushing your balls. Use your face until you're nothing but a fucked out mess and are addicted to my cock."
And just like that, the anger wells up again. "What the fuck is your problem, Stark? Did your ego really take that much of a hit because of the difference in our sex lives?"
He gives a thoughtful little hum of a noise and leans back against the counter, propping his elbows on it. "Huh." He shrugs, "Yeah, I know that feeling."
"I'm glad you like them." But, of course, he sounds like he knew Steve would. "Would you like me to come in, put them in water before we leave?"
Bucky just watches him move. "I don't even know what Steve said to hurt your ego this badly. But if you want an explanation, think about the last time you made him feel safe. Like he could let go."
"Ugh, of course he does," he rolls his eyes, salty about Bucky being a good person in any respect. "I still don't like him. Is that gonna be a deal breaker?"
"Of course not." Steve chuckles softly. "I didn't expect you to take it well, with everything that's happened, you know? But if you're into him... I mean, it, then please. Please lemme watch sometimes?"
"He called me his boyfriend when we fought. I wasn't even aware... that he loved me like that. He had never said anything."
"We didn't even officially break up until I confronted him last week. He just stopped talking to me," Steve explains. "And yes, the fact that Bucky is back seems to have started all of this."
That's probably as much honesty as he's ever going to get from Tony fucking Stark and it tightens Bucky's throat to hear it like that. "He needs you. He needs you for all the things I can't give him." Absently, he adjusts Tony's t-shirt and collar.
He scoffs and looks away for a second, trying to clear away pain so he can keep talking about this. "Yeah, see, that's the thing. He doesn't actually need anything from me. He only needs you. I... I need him, and I don't need him to need me, I've made my peace with that. But you, you just, you get in the way of everything. You've taken all the best things in my life from me and... God, I know none of it is your fault, you didn't choose to be the Winter Soldier, you didn't choose to kill my parents, you didn't mean to be the catalyst for the Avengers falling apart and me leaving my entire life behind. You didn't choose to be the guy Steve keeps referring to as his soul mate. But it still always comes down to you and I hate you for it." But his voice is only a fraction anger, it's mostly just hurt and defeat.
He chuckles darkly and finally his lips find Tony's skin. "I don't give a shit about the world, Stark. I don't give a fuck about the people I've hurt outside of the world I live in now. Steve, you, maybe the other Avengers and that's it. If
His legs are shaky, his brain is still elsewhere--nowhere, really--and before they even get out of the work room, Steve picks his smaller boyfriend up to take him to his room. Tony has the nicest room in the building, naturally, so they end up in there. When Tony is set down he relaxes into the mattress and simply looks up at the other men, thoughts not totally forming again yet.
He moans softly and tilts his head. "I... mmm, Buck." Steve runs his hands over Bucky's shoulders, trying to recall despite the distraction. "We were so young I don't even remember it happening. It's like being in love with you has just always been part of my life."
Tony blinks away tears and gives a half laugh. "I even hate you for being as good of a person as you are. How fucked is that?‚Äù
Chuckling, Steve shakes his head. "I'm just getting started." His face turns serious and Captain America beds a knee in front of Tony. "I'm sorry."
"Fine. I'll give you space." He sighs and shakes his head. "Just... just promise me to take care of yourself, okay?"
"I don't want to be in the way, and I won't be, if I can help it. Steve deserves everything we can both give him. So... come back inside with me and help me get over myself?"
"I'm not exactly relationship material, to be honest. But yeah, it's true. You're the only one I've always wanted. You're the only memory they couldn't ruin. They buried it, but they never managed to break it. You're my anchor, Steve. My everything." Bucky brushes a strand of hair from Steve's forehead.
"I've wanted to kiss you the first time you jumped a guy who was so much bigger than you. Carl Gunterman, remember him?" He chuckles and bites Steve's collar bone through his shirt. "I still don't know why you wanted to fight him but I still have that scar on my eyebrow from getting you out of it."
Bucky just shrugs and takes a sip from his coffee. "Figured you had better things to think about than my feelings."
with him that you don't is the only thing that keeps me together with all of the things only you two have. But I know that if I try, and I'm okay, it'll be a lot better for everyone."
"You sounded like you also wanted to play with me on the receiving end and I won't do that with Steve around. I'm not going to give him another person he has to take care of." But fuck, yeah, Tony is right, he does have some imagination.
Buck arches an eyebrow and looks back over his shoulder. "What happened to wanting me dead because I killed your parents and ruined everything?"
Grinning darkly and knowing that Steve can hear them, Bucky chuckles. "Well, if I run out of cum to breed you with, I can always fist you. Don't think I haven't seen the way you look at my arm, Iron Bitch."
"What? No, that's not what I meant. I meant because I got his genes." He didn‚Äôt, but he likes the joke. "I don't resent that anymore, I hope you know that."
"Banner's got enough of his own shit to sort though," Tony laughs dryly and pauses to think on the question. "No, I don't think you can. You're where you're supposed to be and I need to... I don't know. Deal with that. Get over it."
Steve steps closer and places his hand on Bucky's shoulder. "Let him go. This is not the way to solve this."
"Yeah. And I didn't go out with Peggy because she's female but because she was herself. Just as I'm not going out with you because you're male. "
Tony looks away, refusing to acknowledge the question, which is really answer enough. "Steve," it's a small whine, half-protest, but zero objection.
Tony soaks it up like water to a sponge so dry it's about to crack. He's not entirely sure he's ever been kissed so innocently, without clear sexual undertones. He moves his arms to wrap them loosely around Steve's neck and pushes the kiss deep again, using lips and tongue and a bit of teeth, but it's all for the kiss, for the way they feel just like this and not for anything it might or won't lead to.
Tony arches an eyebrow and gives a crooked grin. "Well, I'd be happy to give you a hell of a lot more that you never thought you'd get from anyone."
"Yes." Steve smiles crookedly. "Tony, I'm a virgin. I never had a proper relationship my whole life. I don't have a clue how this is going to go, I just know that I like you and that you're worth giving it a shot."
Tony is in equally good spirits. He feels secure with Steve, certain enough now that what they have works, and it's real, and it's here to stay. It's taken some time and a lot of effort to learn to be okay with Steve's, em,
Tony smiles back, definitely flattered, and leads Steve out. He waits for the other man to lock his door, because he'd insisted on having mechanical locks installed for some reason, and then escorts him downstairs. He opens the passenger side door of his car and closes it once Steve is safely inside, then goes around to get in the driver's seat.
The amount of times he's thought about Bucky in the quiet dark of his own room with a start just like this, pinned, that look of irritation... it's absolutely not helping him focus any. "I don't think people can do that. I just have to stop letting it control me. I can do that."
"Did you see how hard he was?" Steve asks excitedly. "I've never seen that much precome before. It was incredible."
"If you're bigger than Steve, I don't think that'd take long, using my face until I can't take it anymore," he comments with a teasing smile. "I'm pretty new to the whole cock sucking thing, truth be told."
"I love you, Steve." Bucky takes his chin with his human hand and turns his head so they look at each other again.
Steve lets out another sigh but this time it's a happy one. "I love you, too, Tony. Now come here so I can kiss you some more."
"I know that's not a problem. But I can't..." He cuts off. This is a completely useless conversation. He can't date two people even if he were to risk it.
"Barnes," Tony returns in identical flatness. He stands there a minute, awkwardness starting to seep in, and then forces himself to move on. He slips into his default conversation topics -- technology improvements and the stuff he owns. "So, how do you like the house? Those guys ever come and change out the glass in the skylight in your bedroom? Or, um, I guess I assume you ended up in the second bedroom. Rather than Steve's." Well fuck, he's now just made things more awkward for himself.
With a grin, Tony soon ventures further down, kissing his way to Steve's collar bone, over his chest, finally coming to a stop when he laps over one of Steve's nipples and sucks it into his mouth. He looks up as he makes first contact, wanting to savor his boyfriend's pleasure.
"Here." After putting the mug down in front of Tony he grabs one for himself--black--and then sits down at the kitchen island.
Tony nods, but before he goes anywhere he pulls Steve into a kiss, long and deep, the length of their bodies pushed together and heat flowing off of Tony.
Tony steps inside when prompted and the two of them kiss. He intends it to be just a sweet little thing, an intimate greeting, but Steve wraps his large arms around the shorter man and pulls him in, deepening the kiss and holding him there as he channels some of the excitement and adoration that's been building up in anticipation of today. When the kiss breaks, Steve is still wearing that winning smile that makes people trip over their feet for him, and Tony is slightly flushed and grinning.
He grins and wiggles a little. "Of course I remember him. And why I fought him. Love this scar." Steve brushes his fingers over it adoringly. "I've wanted to kiss you since... um, well, since I started wondering what kissing would be like, I guess."
Bucky stays true to his word, he doesn't take a lot of time preparing Tony. All he does is make sure he won't make him bleed. Once that's taken care of, he lines up his cock with Tony's backside and looks at Steve for permission. Or is it approval?
"Well... I could take you out. For practice, I mean. Help you get some experience in how to flirt, for example." He's playing it nonchalant pretty damn well.
"Everything?" That's hard to believe. "So when I told you to hold him down while he was struggling to breathe around my cock..."
"Jesus..." Steve shakes his head. "I'm... I'm sorry you got dragged into this like that, I..." He stares at his book for a second and then looks back at Nat before he closes it and gets up. "You're right. Where is he?"
"You have to know how much I wanna believe that, how bad I want you to just be the villain I build you up to be in my head so I can feel justified in blaming everything on you. You have to know how much I wanna validate my own mostly-irrational hatred. And though it pains me to even think it, let alone say it, you are a good person, Barnes. You're a better person than I am in some ways and it drives me nuts."
"Did you seriously just talk like that about Steve? Did you really..." Bucky glares, turns around and gets closer. "He's worth a thousand men like you, he loves you and you're standing here, throwing a bitter pity party for what? Your dick?"
Steve retreats into the woods he came out of just enough to make sure their reunion doesn't get interrupted by anyone who recognises him. When he sees Tony, his heart skips a beat.
"Please." Tony leans down now, their bare chests pushed together, his lips grazing over Steve's neck in little kisses before licks and bites down softly. He's already getting hard, just from being this close and intimate with Steve again.
Tony's jaw goes tight. He already regrets saying it, but his pride isn't about to let him apologize or back down. "I'm just saying, your enhancements are apparently what he likes about getting fucked by you so much, so now you'll be even better."
"It's none of my business who people love, Tony. It's nobody's business what other people do. Of course I'm okay with it, what kind of despicable hypocrite would I be if I was fighting for freedom but unable to respect other people's?" Steve explains softly but firmly. "What irritates me pretty much constantly is the fact that you seem to think any sort of personal information is your business."
? You... Steve, you've known you belong with this guy for what, seventy years? I hate him, but even I'm not about to stand in the way of that. We both know where you belong and it's not with me."
Steve is currently playing chess with Bucky, one of their favorite pass-time activities. When Tony enters the room, they both look up and while Steve's face lights up, Bucky's eyes darken.
"I'm proud of you for changing that." The guilt over loving Bucky more starts eating Steve's heart again.
an answer to until he accidentally came up with it, and not knowing if Steve shares his bed with another man is starting to get under his skin to a level that surprises him. He follows into the kitchen. "Sure, yeah, coffee would be great. But, um, seriously though. How's your room? Have everything you need?"
A shudder runs up his spine at the word faggot and he tenses a little. "You know you're really not supposed to use that word anymore, right?"
"I... I'm just trying not to hurt him any more than I already have. I didn't even think about... I'm sorry."
Steve gets off his chair and instead comes to wrap around Bucky from behind, nestling into his neck. "Someday you're going to have to stop talking that way about the man I love."
"What if you're wrong? What if he's straight. Or only loves me like a brother?" He shakes his head. "Me wanting something is not worth risking what I already have with him."
"If... If that's what you want, but, um, no, that's not what I was asking, exactly." God, why is this hard? He used to be the ultimate playboy, for God's sake.
"You've got no clue, do you?" Tony meets Bucky's gaze, unflinching. He already knows talking like that was uncalled for but he‚Äôs not about to pass up the chance to work out some aggression. "No, of course you don't. You think it's really that simple because you're the golden boy."
Tony glances at Steve and then away as he asks, almost bashfully, "Will you spend the night tonight?"
That's actually easier to admit than the whole fucked up kinky stuff. He just shrugs and nods. "Yeah."
"Stark." He nods, weirdly glad that his new arm and all of the other upgrades he's gotten are supposedly even better than Tony's technology.
Steve doesn't step back but he doesn't reach out to touch Tony either. "So you don't wanna try my amazing carbonara sauce?" he teases softly.
Steve frowns and tilts Tony's head up with his knuckles. "I'm not mad if it's just physical either. I love you both, I like the idea of you two getting along.
"Yeah, no, you're right. Things, um, well, I tend to move a lot faster than, um," he clears his throat. "I'll rein it in."
"I mean about... not about Bucky, obviously. I mean about... whatever it is you want with me, or, or, whatever. Just," tears again, and a sigh. "I'm just trying to leave the door open, okay?"
"Move on? Re-light that candle? Nat, Bucky is my soulmate. Even if it's unrequited, I'm happy just having him by my side as a brother for the rest of my days," Steve explains with a crooked smile. "And it's not fair to be with Tony when there's someone I need and love more. Doesn't matter if I get him or not."
"You said for practice." Steve steps closer, hoping Tony will look at him properly. "What were you asking?"
"Don't worry, Stark. I'll only do what's necessary so you won't get ripped apart. Anything else isn't my concern."
a little nervous about today, about the first time the three of them will be spending time together, but that doesn't dampen how good it feels to see his boyfriend.
Tony laughs and shakes his head. "No, no, I mean sometimes you would just... we wouldn't be flirting or on a date or anything, you'd just see me and kiss me and it would make my day every time."
"Sit down, get comfortable and tell me what you want to drink. You can entertain me with some delightful conversation while I cook and later we can order dessert," Steve decides and gently pushes Tony towards the kitchen.
God, he's too cute. "It was innuendo, Steve. Coming up for coffee after a date is basically code for coming up to screw. Which, for the record, I am not expecting."
It's like a fucking wet dream. Different guy, but right now that really doesn't matter, he just needs this. He grunts as he's shoved down, and the shock of the pain translates directly into satisfaction. "That's it, Barnes. Take what you want from me, it's the only fucking way you're gonna get it."
"I trust you. Just handle it however you want to," Steve says with a smile. "We can kiss like that some more later."
"Pepper. That break up wasn't my idea," he says plainly. He's already solidly shut out the heartbreak of that one, so the statement comes easily.
Laughing, Buck lays down next to him. "Rogers, you have a boyfriend who might not be happy if we do more than that."
"Tony..." Steve wraps his arm around him. "What is it that you wanna hear? Why is this... Loving him doesn't make my love for you less valid."
Tony slips a hand onto Steve's hip again, and with the other he takes his chin between thumb and forefinger. Leaning up, he kisses the other man softly, and then again a little deeper, taking Steve's bottom lip between his own.
Steve is unable to look at her but he shakes his head. "Bucky is... I mean, we're not but... I can't..." He can't bring himself to say it.
The soft little noise he makes at Bucky's continued attention is entirely involuntary, and the way his eyes follow Steve's hand is also mostly reflex. "How... you... you like this?" He can't quite wrap his head around it, especially with so much of his processing power devoting itself to his dick.
"Do you want company?" Steve asks, looking a bit confused and concerned. He wasn't oblivious to the way Bucky felt about it, but so far he'd tolerated it fine.
"Long story short, I told him I was interested," he says with a nervous laugh. "He's got some pretty‚Ä¶ unconventional interests." Tony treads lightly, even less sure if Bucky would be upset with Tony just spilling everything. "Hearing about them is what got me all... Well, like what you walked in on."
Tony just about growls. "Yeah, real winner you've got there," he can't help the bitterness seeping out. He tries to swallow it down as he fully enters the room and takes the seat Bucky was just occupying, and mentally critiques Bucky's skill in half a second. Guy may be strong, but he's not even close to a super-genius like Tony.
The moan he gives is nearly imperceptible as he gets Bucky's flesh in his hand, but it's certainly there. Tony gives into the kiss, opening up and letting Bucky claim him as he reorients his hand and strokes over the massive length. A moment later, though, he forces the kiss to break. "Wait, wait, stop. This isn't right. We're both with Steve but that doesn't... we can't... this is cheating."
"Christ, Tony, stop talking like that. Please." Bucky is completely unable to look at the other man. "So Steve got into your head with some bullshit. Lemme tell you something, too: I will never look as gorgeous on his cock as you do, I will never be able to break apart underneath his hands like you do. And no, I haven't seen you guys fuck but I just know what it must be like. And I envy you. Both of you."
Tony stares like he's trying to make sure he actually heard what he thought he heard and finally answers, "Yeah. Yeah, it is." But still he won't let himself believe that's where Steve is going with this.
. Crookedly, he smiles at Steve and mouths 'take care' before he leaves. And really, he means take care of both of them.
He opens his mouth to argue with that but decides against it and just does as he's told. "Am I... May I touch you?"
The beauty, love and affection in those words take Steve's breath away for a moment but he manages to focus again. "How can you feel that way about me but somehow doubt you'd be just as capable of giving and receiving love?"
Bucky arches an eyebrow, almost surprised at Tony giving it to him. But yeah, he sounds nothing like Steve and he files begging away as something that doesn't work with everyone.
"You mean like you do with your cameras and sensors everywhere?" Steve scoffs but he doesn't lose his smile. "I guess I'm grateful you're doing it the old fashioned way for once."
," he says as he storms out. And sure, it's not the most clever or cutting thing to say, but it's all he's got right now.
." Tony pulls up and strips Steve entirely of the rest of his clothing, and the hungry look in his eyes is unmissable.
His smile comes back, though it's small. "Do I still get what I used to have? The kisses for no reason at all, the texts about insignificant things that always really just tell me you're thinking of me?"
"We could go dancing sometime. I'm pretty good at swing." He strokes his hips softly and adds, "Is this alright?"
His breath is heavy but he doesn't seem relieved by the release. "He said exactly what I told you. I'm pathetic without my suit. That you fuck him like I never could. Which is all fucking true, and talking about it isn't going to change that."
"Yes, that would be great, thank you!" He takes the bouquet with an excited light in his eyes and leads Tony into his apartment.
"Even if I'm also with Bucky?" It's not like everybody doesn't know that's been happening but he has to make sure.
"Damn right I am." He pushes in to kiss Steve again, surrendering himself to it entirely as all those walls come crumbling down.
Steve whines, wrapping his arms around Tony and clinging to him. He's starting to feel too overwhelmed but in all the right ways.
It takes a little bit longer to climax for Bucky but after slamming into Tony two dozen more times, he grunts and roars out his orgasm as well.
"Fuck me, come on, Buck, please. I need you to hurt me, get me out of my head, make me feel it for days.
"With him? No. I just found him again, I'm just glad he's part of my life. I'm not going to bother him with my intimate wishes." Plus, there's no way that would work, right?
Steve, on the other hand, feels dizzy from how aroused he is but the moment he notices Tony needing someone for aftercare, that's forgotten. Instead, all he focuses on is taking care of his two boyfriends. First of all: getting them into a large, comfy bed.
Tony groans softly and brings his other hand to curl in Steve's shirt, surrendering control easily but not becoming passive as their lips tangle.
Gasping softly, Bucky is only surprised for a second and then he returns the kiss, deeply and needy, losing himself in Steve.
Steve's enthusiasm is certainly changing his own predictions for the night. He smiles broader and very genuinely as he follows the other man inside.
Nodding, Steve swallows once more and clears his throat. "You're... incredibly sexy. Both of you. And together..."
"I know." Bucky looks him in the eyes, just as serious. "I'm all yours. There's no one else I want and there's no one else I need but you. But that doesn't make me better or worse than you, it just makes me different."
That makes him all the more sure of his inferiority, makes him doubt he's ever been what Steve needs, even briefly, and emotional pain strikes his features. His hand loosens, almost giving permission to what Bucky is doing to him.
"I don't wanna make promises I can't keep," he offers quietly, watching what's going on in Bucky's expression. "And I know how destructive my ego can be. I just... I really need to take it step at a time. No strings means no promises it'll become anything, but also... But also no promises that it won't turn into something, if everyone ends up wanting that. Are you sure you can be okay with what I'm asking for?"
Steve's smile turns a little wicked and he looks away for a second, almost shy and definitely embarrassed of his debauched thoughts. "Yes, God yes Tony, so so much. Want him to wreck you, to take you apart, wanna hear you pant his name and mine together. You're so beautiful when you... when you break."
"You're two seconds away from fucking the guy who killed my parents, how the hell would we still be boyfriends?" Tony snaps.
Steve swallows. "Don't apologize, Tony. This is..." He blushes even more and absently brushes one hand over the crotch area of his jeans that is tented by his raging hard-on. "God, you two look so good together."
At the same time, Steve steps closer, blushing like crazy and very, very speechless but surprisingly okay with what he sees. "Wh-what... Jesus, guys..."
"A few times, yeah. Never with a date, though. Rhody loves the place, and I think Thor just about bankrupted them," he laughs.
, but he sure as hell isn't gonna do anything to keep it that way. He moves his hand down, fingertips ghosting and nails scraping the flesh of his ribs and stomach until finally reaching his goal and taking Steve's length strongly in hand.
pure but I can definitely try harder." His hands find Tony's hip and neck with a gentle touch, pulling their bodies together before kissing him. Surprisingly hard. He just can't help himself, there's too much pent up want and need inside of him.
"I did..." Steve breathes against the skin of Tony's neck. "So much." He bites his lip at feeling more and more exposed but he manages to get up the courage to move his hands down to Tony's backside, groping slightly.
"Steve," he whispers between kisses, grip becoming tighter. His hips push against the other man's without thought as Tony falls deeper into the intimacy.
"Why would it bother me?" Steve asks in return, smiling softly. "I mean, I'm sorry to disappoint people who ask me out but if I'm not interested I won't lie."
How could he not, given all those sweet words? Hearing Steve dirty talk always does it for Bucky and at the order from his captain, he does exactly what both men ask of him. Slamming in deep, he forces Tony open again and again, speeding up with every thrust.
"Well, I'm not." Trying to shake the blush from his cheeks, Steve quickly moves his head and focuses back on cooking.
His breath catches in his throat at the feeling, and fuck, he wonders if anyone who isn't a super soldier can take that. He's still not getting what he really wants, though, so he just scoffs. "Are you really so insecure you just keep a cucumber stuffed in there at all times? Jesus, Bucky, I think you need therapy as bad as I do."
Tony seethes. "Great. As if you weren't in the middle of our goddamn relationship enough, now you're our fucking couple's counselor
"I'm not saying this is all this is to you, I'm saying that the whole outing thing will end up overpowering the fact that you wanted to go out with me," Steve tries to explain. "The first date with a guy who isn't even sure he's bi is not the right time to out yourself, Tony. Take me back home. I'll cook, you can maybe get us a bottle of wine and help me do the dishes once we're done. We're doing this my way."
not gone well." He knows talking about this is just deflecting, keeping them from getting into the real issue, but he can't bring himself to breach it.
"Well Tony liked it just as much as you did, so if that's what makes someone broken, then he must be, right?" Steve is definitely leading to proving a point.
It's like there's a direct connection between Steve's nipples and his cock. Because the moan that spills from his lips is an entirely new sound.
The silence definitely makes Steve nervous but he keeps telling himself that being honest is always the right way to handle things.
Steve is actually relieved enough that Tony isn't kicking him out that he actually chuckles at that. "No, no, he's not. He's the one who suggested it."
Bucky sighs. "So he did it to hurt you because you were having a fight, not because he actually means it." That's definitely a relief. Bucky is still standing quite close to Tony but he keeps himself from touching.
"Doesn't make me wonder at all," Tony says coolly. "Steve picked you because he'll always go after the one who's more broken, who needs more saving. He is a hero, after all. Only thing it says about me is that he thinks I'm capable of handling myself. That he trusts me to be okay without him."
But even if he fools himself, it doesn't take long for Steve to find him. Because yes, Bucky is back, things have changed and are still changing but his relationship with Tony is way too special to just... dissolve into nothing.
Now that's kinda surprising. Bucky keeps his face in check, still not quite sure how he wants to handle all of this. "Yeah well, we'll see about that," he says cryptically and just stares into his mug.
"I, um, I was just on my way out. We had an accident this morning, broke every egg in the house. It's... a long story and not worth telling. I'll be back soon, though, okay? Just make yourself at home." Steve can't help himself, he kisses Tony again, just a peck this time, and then he's out the door.
"It matters that I feel loved by someone that I love, too. So, yeah, it definitely matters," he says, smiling softly and gazing into his eyes.
Bucky smiles crookedly. "Have you seen yourself? All I wanna do since I've met you is make you shut up by fucking your brains out." He shrugs. "As I said, I'm not a good man."
Steve swallows at the exchange and offers Bucky's seat to Tony. "Make yourself at home. Do you want something to drink? A glass of water maybe?"
Seconds later a metal hand rips Tony's clothes to shreds and then Bucky manhandles him, slamming him face first onto the workbench close to the wall and bending him over.
"Nah, but I don't mind getting my hands dirty and pushing them inside of your bubble butt," Buck retorts with a smirk as he steps inside.
to beg for it, he does that all on his own every time anyway, but the confirmation that Bucky gets off on it is a good feeling.
That catches him off guard and he stares for a long moment, cranks turning in his head as he processes that. His voice is lower, leading, more sure when he speaks again. "No. What do you mean, I look good when I break?"
," he says with a snarl. He looks to Steve, not pointing any anger at him but still quite irritated. "I am
Nat smiles softly at that. "Your relationship, your partner?" She slips off the table and places a hand on his shoulder briefly. "Sounds like you still got some feelings there, Cap." And she slips off towards her room.
"A little, yeah. He knows how fucked up I've been all my life. But it's not exactly a topic that comes up often." Bucky shrugs, crossing his arms in front of his chest.
Without a hint of hesitation but definitely also with enough care not to use his full strength, Bucky slaps Tony. "One more word..."
"... You're serious? That would drive me insane, Buck, I can't understand how you could be fine with that."
It still feels good to get under Tony's skin and he bites back a grin. Somewhat. "About you not going anywhere."
Sergeant," Bucky reassures them both. "I'll follow you to the end of the line for the rest of our lives."
"Clearly you're not too familiar with the Maria Stark foundation," he smiles a little smugly. "I do a lot of things like that. For example, last month the entire student body of MIT had all of their projects fully funded."
"I just want space!" His voice is definitely raised now, emotion flooding back into his features. "It fucking hurts, okay? It hurts to be near you and not touch you. It hurts to see you walk down the hall in your pajamas and not stop by to kiss me goodnight. It hurts every time I wake up and remember you haven't texted me updates on the 20 million things you got done before I even got out of bed. I- I can't do it right now. I've lost everything, and I've lost you, and it's gonna take me a while."
It still takes Steve a few more days until he feels like he knows what he wants and what he's doing. Bucky and him had talked a lot more about the whole double relationship situation, laid down some ground rules. Question is now, if Tony is willing to go along with that or not.
‚ÄòNot exactly,‚Äô Daredevil replies. ‚ÄòIt seems Deadpool is just being his usual irritating self. Me on the other hand, I asked him to let me know when you were moving against HYDRA. I wanted to make sure none got away, I don‚Äôt need them establishing even more of a foothold in this city. That was the agreement we made when I said I‚Äôd help him try and find out where Tony Stark was being kept.‚Äô
‚ÄòLook, I‚Äôll be honest,‚Äô Tony starts pacing, ‚ÄòPepper, that‚Äôs my assistant,‚Äô he says to Steve, ‚Äòwho is basically my mom at this point, doesn‚Äôt think I should be telling you this but I think you deserve to know considering how much this has affected you. So I‚Äôm hoping you‚Äôll keep it quiet until I‚Äôve got everything sorted out.‚Äô
Steve fumbles with the tie at his neck, his fingers shaking with thoughts on what he‚Äôs about to do. ‚ÄòDammit!‚Äô he curses as the material once again slips through his fingers.
‚ÄòYou willing to take advice from the master of throwing epic temper tantrums? Treat it like a band aid and get it over with.‚Äô
‚ÄòMiss Maximoff?‚Äô Wanda looks over at the little girl that is standing a few feet away, nervously twiddling her hair over a finger.
‚ÄòTony,‚Äô Steve sighs out a laugh and presses a kiss to his cheek, ‚Äòyou‚Äôre a genius. It sounds perfect.‚Äô
‚ÄòI‚Äôve already got one thanks,‚Äô he says, pulling his phone out of his pocket. ‚ÄòAnd I‚Äôm running late.‚Äô He grabs MJ‚Äôs arm and steers her and Ned around Hammer.
By the time he‚Äôs climbing the stairs up to the common area, Peter is regretting agreeing to the cheeseburger as its currently doing flips in his stomach. When he finally walks through the door most of the team is gathered there.
Steve leans against the trunk of a tree round the back of the venue, he‚Äôs decided to avoid the main door seeing as he hasn‚Äôt come with the rest of the squad and therefore doesn‚Äôt have a physical invitation to show them. He isn‚Äôt exactly dressed for the party either, having not changed out of the dark jeans and hoodie he‚Äôd been wearing earlier. Now he just has to find the best way to get in, and find a way to talk to someone who may be able to help him.
‚ÄòFRIDAY can you let me know if he doesn‚Äôt make it to bed in the next five minutes?‚Äô Rhodes asks the AI.
The pattern repeats as the chatter continues in the background. Her eyes widen a little, then go back to look at Tony‚Äôs face. She sits back down in the chair she‚Äôd vacated, carefully picks up her pencil and, cautiously, copies the pattern onto the paper without looking down. She sees a tiny smile in Tony‚Äôs eyes.
‚ÄòI did‚Ä¶the things I did, Sam‚Ä¶they aren‚Äôt the kind of things you do and get a happy ending,‚Äô is the quiet response he gets.
‚ÄòYeah,‚Äô Steve admits, ‚Äòbut Tony would always change it anyway.‚Äô His voice catches a little on the inventor‚Äôs name.
When Tony‚Äôs managed to have a drink and stop coughing, he looks over at the young man, who is currently bouncing on his seat and looking like he wants to launch himself at him. Tony can‚Äôt help it, he reaches out a hand to the teenager. ‚ÄòThank god you‚Äôre alright,‚Äô he manages to get past his cracked lips.
Peter‚Äôs looking down at a framed picture of himself with his Uncle Ben, it was taken a couple of years ago, not long before he‚Äôd died. He can‚Äôt help the tears that are streaming down his cheeks.
Before he can stop himself he reaches forwards and pulls Steve‚Äôs mouth to his. The soldier makes a sound of surprise before relaxing into the kiss, the hand on the side of his face creeps to cradle the back of his head. When the inventor pulls back there‚Äôs a blush on the blond‚Äôs cheeks.
‚ÄòCaptain Rogers how do you feel about having to let the justice system handle someone who hurt a member of your team?‚Äô
‚ÄòI don‚Äôt think I want to know about the last one,‚Äô she says, changing lanes and heading out of the city. ‚ÄòJust answer me this, Pete: if he went rogue could you take him out?‚Äô
A/N: Hi everyone. Well that's the end of the first part of this series! Thank you so much to everyone who has supported this series and for all the lovely comments that you've been leaving.
‚ÄòWe can‚Äôt have all the stones in one place,‚Äô Quill argues again. ‚ÄòOtherwise it‚Äôs just lighting Earth up like a beacon to say: ‚Äúhey assholes we‚Äôve got all the power come get us‚Äù.‚Äô
‚ÄòWhat‚Äôs also not much fun,‚Äô Loki warns her, ‚Äòis the amount of studying you have to do in order to be able to use it. It will mean hard work if you want to become a magic user.‚Äô
May smiles at her nephew. ‚ÄòYeah, they said either today or after the holiday. Looks like it‚Äôs going to be a few more days of waiting.‚Äô
‚ÄòGet your boyfriend to protect your popcorn, he‚Äôs generally good at not letting stuff near you,‚Äô Tony ignores Bucky‚Äôs grumbling.
‚ÄòI know it‚Äôs hard to accept,‚Äô Tony cuts him off. ‚ÄòEspecially when everyone says that heroes are the selfless. But look at it this way: you throw your life away for someone who ends up being killed anyway because you‚Äôre not able to take out the bad guy, you aren‚Äôt there the next week to get the bus of school children empty when it‚Äôs hanging off the bridge.
‚ÄòWanda?‚Äô Another voice adds, this one so much softer, as though it‚Äôs coming from miles away. Little more than a whisper.
‚ÄòYou‚Äôre not having that either,‚Äô Tony tells him. Then, like the truly well-oiled machine they are, the three of them start running towards their enemy.
‚ÄòWait for him to come to you,‚Äô Steve shakes his head. ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt know why he‚Äôs so focussed on Pete being the one to do this.‚Äô
‚ÄòIt‚Äôs the first time we‚Äôve been alone for any amount of time since you got back,‚Äô Tony says, he‚Äôs not sure how his voice is staying so calm, ‚Äòso I suppose I shouldn‚Äôt really be surprised we ended up having another argument should I?‚Äô
‚ÄòIs that a challenge, Deadpool?‚Äô Peter crosses his arms, knowing he‚Äôs being played but not actually caring.
Tony just grins and pulls him in for a kiss. ‚ÄòThat‚Äôs a ‚Äúwhat took you so long?‚Äù but if you want it be ‚Äúyes‚Äù instead then it can be a yes.‚Äô
‚ÄòNot to my knowledge,‚Äô Strange has a wry smile on his face, ‚Äòbut I can try mine first if you‚Äôd like to be safe.‚Äô
‚ÄòYeah,‚Äô he muses, leaning back against the railing and watching his boyfriend helping carry the larger tree. ‚ÄòBut then I don‚Äôt get to sit back and stare at Steve using his muscles.‚Äô
‚ÄòAnyone who wants to keep track of what‚Äôs happening in the world,‚Äô Rhodes points out. ‚ÄòPlus it‚Äôs a good thing to leave on in the background when people are coming in and out.‚Äô
‚ÄòI‚Äôm with Steve,‚Äô Tony says. ‚ÄòOtherwise we‚Äôll end up having both super soldiers on the same team and no one wants that.‚Äô
‚ÄòShall we head towards Peter‚Äôs school? It probably wouldn‚Äôt hurt to be a little early,‚Äô Steve suggests.
‚ÄòYou could relate to that with Vision,‚Äô he finishes for her as she chokes off. ‚ÄòDespite being surrounded by people you consider family, there‚Äôs still a hole where that person once was that nothing can fill at the moment.‚Äô
‚ÄòWhen exactly did Wanda see Wade scars?‚Äô Tony‚Äôs voice is dangerous as he cuts off Wade's response and Peter tenses, eyes going wide as he looks to the girl for help.
‚ÄòThis is why we‚Äôre friends,‚Äô Ned laughs, then turns his attention back to the teacher before they get told off again.
Bruce is not ashamed to admit that, after hearing the stories of what happened last team Christmas, he‚Äôs more than slightly scared as he walks into the common area on the first of December. He‚Äôs more than a little relieved to find no Christmas music playing and no sign of Peter, Wanda or Wade anywhere.
‚ÄòGood. I shall see you tomorrow then, Peter. And I promise to fulfil my end of the bargain by showing you some of those artefacts.‚Äô
Thank you so much for all the love and support you've been sending throughout this series. I hope you enjoy this chapter, as always please let me know what you think. We've been following Infinity War quite closely and this is where we now start to break away again. Anyone want to make any guesses as to where Strange sent Lorena? Or who Okoye might be referring to?
‚ÄòWe need to find out what they want,‚Äô Steve reminds her. ‚ÄòWhy did they wait until now? Why not when they had Bucky and Wanda?‚Äô
to make, but they aren‚Äôt necessarily needed. Not right now at least. ‚ÄòI need to make one more, then I‚Äôll take a break.‚Äô
‚ÄòCouple of days,‚Äô Tony responds, ‚Äòhence why Pete was staying with Ned last night. Meant he didn‚Äôt have to do the longer journey in to school today, apparently they also had a project due in and it meant he could go on patrol after school and still have time to get it done.‚Äô He claps his hands and rubs them together. ‚ÄòAlright you three what do we need to do to celebrate Yule?‚Äô
,‚Äô Bucky‚Äôs voice is close to shouting levels, and Wanda and Vision take a step back, looking between the two of them. It‚Äôs the first time they‚Äôve come close to an argument the whole time the soldier‚Äôs been back. ‚ÄòTell me how long we have left.‚Äô
about? Seeing as you apparently know all about Weapon-X I‚Äôm starting to wonder just how good an actor you actually are.‚Äô
‚ÄòSteve, I-‚Äô the words he wants to say catch in his throat, so instead he just smiles and says, ‚Äòthank you.‚Äô
‚ÄòWell,‚Äô she says when they all head out to let him finish his call in peace, ‚Äòthat was certainly unexpected.‚Äô
‚ÄòIt was Justin Hammer‚Äôs cell, Iron Man,‚Äô comes the reply. ‚ÄòWe think they were trying to get him out and ended up killing everyone in a three cell radius.‚Äô
‚ÄòHe doesn‚Äôt need your encouragement,‚Äô the soldier sighs, coming over and ruffling the teenager‚Äôs hair. ‚ÄòPromise me you‚Äôll go to Nat if you need help Pete.‚Äô
, T‚ÄôChalla,‚Äô she says, taking his hands in her strong grip. ‚ÄòStark gave me an upgrade to my cell before he left,‚Äô she says with a mischievous smile, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm sure the elders would not approve, but you must take the number for it so you can call on us if you ever need our aid again.‚Äô
‚ÄòYou do realise this is just going to create more arguments right?‚Äô Sam points out. ‚ÄòEveryone‚Äôs going to want to be the one to train the kid.‚Äô
‚ÄòWait,‚Äô Peter says quietly as he hops onto a stool next to Tony and the others all head to the seats while Wanda gets out everyone‚Äôs drink of choice and then joins them, Wade and Rhodey at the bar, ‚Äòyou mean you‚Äôre letting me drink?‚Äô
‚ÄòYou got any ideas Pepper?‚Äô Natasha asks her, shoving Bucky away as Peter takes the opportunity to duck down next to her on the sofa, sticking his tongue out at the soldier.
Natasha nods. ‚ÄòEvery evening there‚Äôs a supply truck that enters the facility around eight, all they have to do is flash a card pass and they‚Äôre let in. We need to stop the truck, get rid of its guards and have me and Wade hide in the back while Bucky takes over the driving.‚Äô
Bucky has always known that Wade has a talent for chaos. Hell he‚Äôd faced the guy himself as the Winter Soldier and had paid for letting him mess up the mission on more than one occasion. Seeing it when he was on the same side as the merc, though, gave him a new appreciation for it.
The boy looks up at him, tears streaming down his face. Tony reaches up with his hand and wipes away some of the tears with him thumb. ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt care what you say to me, Peter Parker, I‚Äôd take your place in a situation like that any day. You understand me?‚Äô
‚ÄòThere‚Äôs a reason no one trusted you to speak to him, babe,‚Äô Tony grins at his boyfriend, ‚Äòwe do need him still able to talk.‚Äô Steve just blushes and takes his seat, directly opposite the open door it gives him the opportunity to turn the full force of his Captain America stare onto Hammer before Tony enters and the door closes behind him.
‚ÄòWe‚Äôll be there soon Jedi Master!‚Äô Wade calls back, getting up off the bed and running to the bathroom. ‚ÄòI call shot gun on shower!‚Äô
Tony has fought off Steve and got Peter to himself down in the workshop; they‚Äôre working on the old Mark II suit that he‚Äôd given the teenager for his birthday. Peter‚Äôs body is currently half hidden by the suit as he has a look at the de-icing system that is situated in the back of the torso.
A/N: Hi everyone. I'm so sorry I'm late posting this week. I'm doing a course on top of the job and got carried away with studying and forgot I hadn't posted! I hope it was worth the extra bit of waiting time.
‚ÄòYou make me sound like such a kill joy,‚Äô Steve grumbles as he starts the car and they pull away. Peter relaxes in the backseat, the banter is familiar and he thinks he‚Äôs gotten away with the incident with Flash.
‚ÄòCome on Petey give me my ham and pineapple!‚Äô he hears the mercenary‚Äôs voice floating along the corridor.
‚ÄòSure go ahead,‚Äô he says from underneath the car he‚Äôs working on. He rolls out as the door opens and he hears Steve enter. ‚ÄòWhat can I do for you, Cap?‚Äô
‚ÄòAww, no ‚ÄúAvengers Assemble‚Äù this time?‚Äô Natasha teases as they all start to make their way outside.
Bucky tries to look innocent, but the snigger ruins the image. ‚ÄòJust thinking that this song basically sums up your love life, Stevie.‚Äô
A/N: Hey everyone. Thank you for all my comments and kudos on this story so far. Do let me know what you think of these two chapters, especially about Peter's thoughts on Ultron and the stories with the Commandos here.
Tony opens his mouth to respond when his pocket vibrates with an incoming message. He growls in frustration as he reaches for his phone, suddenly realising how close they‚Äôd gotten. They‚Äôre barely two inches apart, chests nearly meeting every time they take a deep breath.
‚ÄòAww poor birdy doesn‚Äôt like pulling his weight,‚Äô Bucky laughs. Thor looks behind at the sound of a grunt and two bodies hitting the floor as Sam drops his web rope and tackles Bucky to the floor.
‚ÄòNice to finally see you‚Äôre not a figment of Peter‚Äôs imagination,‚Äô the girl smiles at him, putting chalk on her cue. ‚ÄòYou breaking or am I?‚Äô
‚ÄòYeah, but it was just that he couldn‚Äôt feel pain. Really fucking useless in the grand scheme of things.‚Äô
‚ÄòGroot I‚Äôm really sorry buddy I‚Äôm trying to understand you but it‚Äôs taking some time, think you can give me some more actions to explain?‚Äô Peter looks down at the tree.
Francis just laughs. ‚ÄòOh please. Don‚Äôt you realise we‚Äôre¬† moving away from here? I mean sure we‚Äôve still got the last few bits to move out, and I thought: why not keep it running with volunteers just so I can lay a trap for whoever it was that‚Äôs been fucking around with my other labs?‚Äô
‚ÄòPete we‚Äôre going to get out of this right?‚Äô Ned mutters next to him, trying not to be overheard by their captors.
‚ÄòNo,‚Äô he shakes his head, ‚Äòno I don‚Äôt expect anything from you, Natasha. I came to ask for a chance.‚Äô
,‚Äô Tony puts an arm around his shoulder and all but marches him out of the room. Peter sighs and doesn‚Äôt argue as he gets led down to the medical wing, but he knows he isn‚Äôt helping his case by leaning more heavily against the inventor as they walk. They don‚Äôt talk much until the elevator doors open on the medical wing.
‚ÄòLook,‚Äô Quill cuts Rocket off, ‚Äòyou want the truth, Rocket? I don‚Äôt remember a proper Christmas alright? My mom died when I was young and I got taken by Yondu and his Ravagers and I‚Äôve never celebrated a Christmas since. You know the only things I do remember? Eating so much I couldn‚Äôt move, decorating a tree with my mom and her making sure it was the best time of the year.
‚ÄòI suggested Tony be the third,‚Äô Nick says, ‚Äòbut he was adamant the team voted and suggested T‚ÄôChalla as an alternative.‚Äô
A/N: Hello everyone. Sorry I'm a little late this weekend - I genuinely lost track of what day it was! We're starting to gain more momentum with this story now, and things will really start heating up next chapter (as you'll see in the sneak peek).
left. Patrols have been quiet, and even spending time with Deadpool at the end of the majority of them has done nothing to get rid of some of his excess energy. He can‚Äôt get any relief from any of the sports at school, due to having to hold back. What he really wants to do is have a sparring session with one of the Avengers, but he‚Äôs not sure he‚Äôs allowed to do team training yet; he hasn‚Äôt been invited yet anyway and he‚Äôs a little scared to ask. Maybe Natasha would give him a training session on hand-to-hand if he asked, he‚Äôs sure Tony wouldn‚Äôt mind.
Peter rolls his eyes, surprising himself by needing to hold back a smile. ‚ÄòSee you around, Deadpool,‚Äô
‚ÄòBack on topics,‚Äô Wanda rolls her eyes. ‚ÄòWe need one for each of the Guardians, so: Rocket, Groot, Drax-‚Äô
Bucky bursts out laughing, spraying the aforementioned soldier with his drink he‚Äôd been halfway through at Tony‚Äôs comment, and promptly started chocking on what was left, needing Sam to come to his rescue with a couple of back slaps.
‚ÄòAnd they used to say you could charm the clothes off of anyone you wanted. Obviously they were all people who‚Äôd never met you!‚Äô comes the retort.
‚ÄòFirst with planning Bucky‚Äôs escape should we not break the brainwashing,‚Äô Wanda adds, ‚Äòall the way through to this. You‚Äôre forming bad habits, Tony.‚Äô
Wanda and Vision are the first two to return, reassuring Thor that his people are settling into their rooms and will soon be eating. Tony‚Äôs made sure they can‚Äôt access any more of the facility other than the east wing guest quarters until he knows more of what‚Äôs going on. Eventually Peter and Bruce enter, the scientist looking especially tired as he rubs his eyes.
‚ÄòSure thing, Weasel. Come on, kid, let‚Äôs get you on your way home,‚Äô the man reaches out and takes hold of Peter‚Äôs arm.
‚ÄòI wouldn‚Äôt count on it,‚Äô a voice behind them says. The two of them spin around, Peter with his web shooters ready to fire and Deadpool with his katana in hand.
Tony just nods and they head out together, way lit by the reactor in his chest. Now Tony isn‚Äôt known for being able to stay quiet for long, especially in awkward silences, so he‚Äôs actually quite proud of himself for lasting as long as he does. ‚ÄòSo. Long lost brother huh?‚Äô
‚ÄòTony don‚Äôt do anything rash,‚Äô Natasha says, she sounds out of breath and Tony wonders how long he has until one of the others gets there.
‚ÄòNot yet, not until they‚Äôve talked more with Strange,‚Äô he replies as they fall into step. ‚ÄòBesides we have other things for them to focus on before we start worrying about inter-dimensional travel being added to that list. How are preparations for the Wakandan Accords going?‚Äô
Loki is about to respond to thank the man for housing them when the sound of sparks interrupts him and a portal opens in the room. ‚ÄòOh good, my favourite person is arriving.‚Äô
He hasn‚Äôt heard much from the team in the two weeks since the gala; Tony had let him know that there‚Äôd been an increase in attacks from alien enhanced technology so the team had been asked to investigate. Wanda had been his biggest source of information, messaging every other day or so; he says it‚Äôs because she misses him, she says it‚Äôs because she‚Äôs making sure he‚Äôs not been an idiot and got himself killed.
Steve joins them and nods. "Please don't go, Tony. Please. I get it, I really do. You two looked so beautiful together and I'm the last person who will judge you for... falling for Bucky."
"Wh-what is an appropriate level of affection?" Steve asks, not sure if he should be expecting a trap with Tony's sense of humor or not.
"I'm pretty sure he would have stopped us a while ago if he minded," Bucky mutters with a grin and kisses down Tony's neck.
With a sigh, "Okay, what part of, 'I love Steve and Steve loves you, so I have to at least try to kind of care about you' are you not getting here?"
But Steve just steps away. "No. No, I don't. It's not worth it anymore, you made yourself very clear."
God. No one has ever touched or kissed him that way. He's thought about Bucky doing it a million times but Steve has never actually experienced anything like this. He gasps. "No, it's not... I just... I don't know..." It makes him feel stupid how his cock is already reacting.
Tony strips down to nothing but his boxers, his eyes fixed on Steve the entire time, and then climbs over the other man, straddling his hips and running rough hands over his chest.
Bucky chuckles. "Mhm, you keep telling yourself that, that I was on the top of my game when you smacked me down." His thumbs stroke over Tony's hip bones. "But let's entertain the thought, shall we? That maybe, just maybe, I win. Do you want to know what I would do, Stark?"
"No, no, I know. I know we haven't. But you're a good guy. I like you a lot, even without this context, and you're not... you're never." He rubs his face and sighs. "You're someone I can be proud to be seen with. I'm not great at picking those, historically speaking."
Now Tony scoffs. "For being with me like we were. Or anything that's like that that I can have now that your soulmate's in the picture." For once, there are no air quotes or mocking tone with that word.
"Yeah, sure." Last time Steve was in this room, it was empty, but it's now furnished with a few chairs, a table, and it looks like a half-finished desk over by the work bench. Tony takes a seat and gestures for Steve to as well.
"I sure as hell don't know how to bring it up. 'Hey, so you know, I've been in love with you all my life, you're my soulmate and also can we bang your boyfriend together and do a ton of fucked up stuff to him?" Bucky deadpans.
"No," Steve shakes his head. "This is my life, my relationships, my partner, my problem. I'm taking care of him."
"Just now? Because you can't talk to someone who won't listen, Buck. And with Tony I've seen it a hundred times. Sometimes you gotta just let him cool off, or burn himself out, and then try again. Or don't."
With the way his face closes off, it seems like that hurt him pretty deep. "So you can just drop it that easily, huh? Just go back to how everything was a week later, like it never even happened. That's... that's good to know, Steve. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm burning daylight here and I should get back to it."
Kissing Steve's temple, Bucky lets him go. "I just want you to be sure. Because for all I care, you don't have to."
"No. No, don't... don't apologize. 'Cause if you don't have to apologize for thinking about it then... I don't either, right?"
"Is it weird for you, sometimes? That you're close with the son of the guy who gave you your strength, who is now older than his father was at that point?"
asshole over and over again. Making you bounce on my dick until all you remember is my name and how to beg for my cum."
His grin keeps widening and he gets up, walking past Tony and leaning to whisper in his ear. "See, and that's why if I did hate you and wanted to get rid of you, I could and you know it."
"Yeah. Anything you want from anywhere you want. And maybe we could move to the couch while we wait?"
His smile broadens just the slightest and he goes to take a seat at the kitchen island. "Coffee, please. And since we're alone, I'll let you in on a secret - it's disgusting unadulterated and I only drink it like that to keep my image. Milk and plenty of sugar, please."
Just like that, he's melting again, melancholy giving way to a loving smile. "Then tomorrow we can pick out someplace for me to buy for you two where you're not risking catching someone's attention."
"When? When did he say that?" Bucky can't believe that he's starting to feel sorry for fucking Tony Stark.
Moaning into the kiss, Steve copies Tony's actions, gently taking over and exploring how it feels to do the very same things in return.
"It is over. I'm with you, 100%, I promise." He closes the distance between them, slips his hand onto Bucky's shoulder. "I'm yours, Buck. I won't cover it up anymore."
Tony adds his tongue, kissing more deeply but careful enough that he wouldn‚Äôt leave a mark even if Steve weren't a super soldier. His hips push against Steve's.
It's not the first or the second or even the fifth time Steve pulls away because Tony enters the room. And while Bucky understands where he's coming from, every time it happens it hurts. So this time, when Steve lets go of his hand, he doesn't just accept it. Instead, he gets up. "I'm going to go for a run," Bucky declares roughly.
Swallowing, he finally does look back at Steve. "Well, as practice for a romantic date, not a, um," he sighs heavily at himself. "I'm sorry. I'm an idiot. I‚Äôm not normally this awkward.‚Äù Even asking Pepper out with the only food she's allergic to felt more smooth than this. He rubs his forehead and tries again. "Not to totally hone in on Turner's territory," he jokes, "but could I take you to dinner sometime soon? As something more than friends but with no pressure for a follow up?"
They had reached the pass where the figure had risen up in front of them ‚Äì recognition had burst into hatred, one of the bright souls flickering madly ‚Äì but then they knew, whether they had known before or not. That they would not leave to find another way speaks to the broken illusions of each man. Or maybe, simply, that they are tired.
‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù She murmured, ‚Äúokay.‚Äù She pressed a kiss to his palm and then stepped back to compose herself and smile. ‚ÄúDo not leave the Tower, you‚Äôll have a press conference in three hours, be
‚ÄúI‚Äôm very visibly not human, Steve ‚Äì and yet, you‚Äôre just‚Ä¶‚Äù Tony trailed off, and Steve looked a little like a rabbit caught in headlights.
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt deserve it.‚Äù Steve mutters, staring at his feet. ‚ÄúAnd it‚Äôs a shitty answer, I know, but I did some really shitty things.‚Äù Tony bites back an automatic
, and I was too immature to see it.‚Äù She took a long, measured breath, but held up a hand when Tony went to interrupt her. ‚ÄúI made mistakes.‚Äù She repeats, ‚Äúand I thought wrong, even after what I made you
‚ÄúAye, you should rest, Steven. I am sure the Lady Tasha or I will be more than pleased to bring you up a plate.‚Äù He offered, and Natasha offered her agreement. She glanced at Tony, who smiled at her, and her softness became a smirk.
‚ÄúTogether.‚Äù Steve swallows, and it‚Äôs not the question Tony had thought it would be. He‚Äôs taking what Tony‚Äôs offering, without hesitation.
mama‚Äôs, from which she‚Äôd taught Tony all there was to know about dragon lore. She‚Äôs taught him about every magical species known to man, and even a few that were not.
Now, Steve‚Äôs sat up and flicking through the morning news on his tablet with his thumb, and Tony‚Äôs just leaning in to him, savouring the quiet moment of Steve‚Äôs arm hooked around his shoulders, reading the odd word here and there, but not really caring. It‚Äôs a moment that‚Äôs purely them ‚Äì Steve‚Äôs flicking too fast to be reading a thing, his fingers tracing absent patterns on Tony‚Äôs shoulder, and Tony‚Äôs hypothesis is confirmed when the tablet lies flat against Steve‚Äôs legs as Steve presses a kiss into Tony‚Äôs hair.
‚ÄúAh.‚Äù Tony came to a halt, standing in front of her as the Avengers filed out around them to crash on various surfaces and raid the fridge. ‚ÄúPepper, darling, light of my life-‚Äú he began.
‚ÄúTony?‚Äù Natasha called out, and Tony slightly raised a blanket to look at her. Since Tony‚Äôs coming out, her eyes remained pink, and Tony‚Äôs often remained in their natural form because of it. ‚ÄúOh Antoshka‚Ä¶‚Äù she murmured, coming forward slowly and folding herself down onto the cushions beside his head. She ran a hand through his hair, and Tony couldn‚Äôt help but lean up into the touch. She smiled lightly for a moment, threading her fingers through and neatening his unwashed curls around his horns.
It‚Äôs the advances in science made by so many brilliant minds under one roof when Thor brings Darcy and Jane into the fold. It‚Äôs movie nights that even Dum-E loves, because he gets to use the vacuum when they cover the floor in popcorn.
‚ÄúThe forest‚Äôs life is his hoard... he protects those who enter and often blesses or curses those who leave dependant on their respect. Never gives his true name, rarely shows himself... a good dragon. Prideful.‚Äù Tony told him, and Steve‚Äôs face split into a grin, whatever sadness that had been lingering dispelled.
‚ÄúIndeed. Let Mama Dragon care for his hoard.‚Äù She said, and Tony used Steve‚Äôs shock to shove him into the elevator. Jarvis took them up to Tony‚Äôs floor without a word, and Tony determinedly did not look Steve in the face as he carefully began to check him over and see if each scratch Tony could remember had healed. The elevator doors opened behind him, and it was then Steve began to protest.
, Tony wanted to say. ‚ÄúMost likely,‚Äù He lied. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm- I‚Äôm a soul hoarder. I hoard people. So, either I will never have a jewel to hold pride of place, or I have a soulmate. Each is as unlikely as the other.‚Äù
Steve‚Äôs gaze flicked to him at the question, but he went back to staring out across the stage Tony had just vacated. ‚ÄúNothing.‚Äù He replied.
In this modern-day society, hoards have changed. Tony has met dragons that hoard pencils, and dragons that hoard plants. The owner of the Met is a dragon, and woe betide anyone not return items on loan from his hoard. Some dragons hoard money, jewellery, but those old dragons are becoming fewer and fewer... some hoard cats, or dogs, there‚Äôs one in the amazon who hoards birds, and Tony‚Äôs favourite dragon in the world won‚Äôt ever give his true name, but he hoards Yosemite and haunts its boundaries to protect those who enter and bless those who leave.
He then shows Clint, and it‚Äôs worth the clip around the back of the head he gets from his not-really-assistant for the way Clint pretty much screeches
the futurist, Tony, what- Tony, I‚Äôm not going to- to- no. No. I can‚Äôt, Tony, no matter what you think of me now.‚Äù
‚ÄúNot exactly.‚Äù Tony told him, and then sighed when he realised this was going to turn into a guessing game.
at being reminded of the sheer magnitude of what Steve kept from him, he can appreciate what‚Äôs being said, he knows;
Steve slips the ring onto the right finger of his left hand with gentle fingers, and the weight of it there feels
Thor nods understandably when Tony goes to him in a panic ‚Äì Rhodey had hung up on him, and Thor was the only one who knew, who even if he hadn‚Äôt worked it out, the only one of the Avengers that he knew wouldn‚Äôt care. ‚ÄúI had suspected for some time... you and the good Captain have become close,
, rather than says it, before he‚Äôs grinning around the sadness ingrained in his face. ‚ÄúYou came.‚Äù It‚Äôs barely more than a whisper, but it‚Äôs heartfelt in a way Tony had forgotten Clint could be ‚Äì and never to him. They‚Äôd been friends ‚Äì good friends ‚Äì but they‚Äôd never had true heart-to-heart moments.
‚ÄúYou have a magic about you,‚Äù she said, her eyes slipping from their human grey to the signature pale pink of the faye. ‚ÄúBut there‚Äôs no evidence of a hoard, which I‚Äôll admit threw us off.‚Äù She reached out to squeeze his hand then. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad to know.‚Äù Tony grinned at her, relief growing with each passing moment.
The guest list is short, mostly superhero types and their families (if they‚Äôve been brave enough to have them), with the odd reporter, and a lot of people who have been on the receiving end of Tony‚Äôs kindness over the years. The Avengers are divided, for the most part, into two sets of Groomspeople ‚Äì and it says something for how far they‚Äôve come when it takes
The weather is warm in the grounds where they hold it, and fireflies light the night alongside the lanterns. Tony and Steve get to dance under the stars, not hidden away on the rooftop of the tower but in front of all the people they love.
‚ÄúIn a heartbeat.‚Äù Tony answered honestly, ‚Äúbut I don‚Äôt think it would‚Äôve been the right choice.‚Äù And with that, he shuts the door on Steve, unable to take a second more of thinking on that rather large
They go to Tony‚Äôs room, just to sleep. Curled up in one another, safe in a way Tony hasn‚Äôt felt since Ultron, almost, and it‚Äôs
‚ÄúIs there any stroganoff left for me?‚Äù A voice asked, and Tony fumbled his landing, almost straight into Thor‚Äôs Thor-sized mug, in his haste to turn.
Tony actually has a room in the Wakandan Palace, and most days he can‚Äôt get his head around that fact. It‚Äôs between Clint‚Äôs and an empty one, now, opposite Natasha‚Äôs. On his extended stays, it‚Äôs his, and T‚ÄôChalla will loan him interesting books for the shelves on Tony‚Äôs rare down moments. Sam, Clint, Wanda‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre all working towards coming back home. So‚Äôs Ant Man, who Tony‚Äôs not spoken to much and doesn‚Äôt really care to, but Tony‚Äôs not seen Steve. Not once. He‚Äôs been in Wakanda with some frequency for ‚Äì fucking hell has it really been over a year? - and it‚Äôs like he‚Äôs not here.
‚ÄúI keep people close. I don‚Äôt have a large hoard, and I steel myself to get my heart broken. Only a jewel will live as long as I do. Everyone else, I‚Äôll lose.‚Äù He swallowed. ‚ÄúNo one knows. I can‚Äôt- people aren‚Äôt property, and often the significance of dragon hoards are lost on other species. I don‚Äôt want‚Ä¶‚Äù
‚ÄúIf you would talk to him, Anthony, you will not have to.‚Äù And with that, Thor claps him on the shoulder and returns to his reading.
.‚Äù Tony growls out when Steve continues to stare at his feet. Tony wishes he got some sort of vindictive pleasure of how the tears burning in his own eyes are easily visible in Steve‚Äôs, but all it does is hurt.
Pepper and Happy and Rhodey are hoard, Jarvis and the bots are hoard, Jan Van Dyne who he gets coffee with once and month and has for the last ten years is hoard ‚Äì these all make sense to Tony.
He doesn‚Äôt ask why he wasn‚Äôt told. He doesn‚Äôt ask about Howard or Maria. He asks about flying, and Tony‚Äôs tendency to curl up while he sleeps. He teases and assures in equal measure, and Tony feels a little lighter knowing that someone knows.
A year of the Avengers becoming a family again ‚Äì Pepper and Natasha growing stronger as Natasha works through her past, Coulson returning from nowhere to Clint‚Äôs open arms, and Sam following an insult to Bucky with a blown kiss. It‚Äôs Vision learning to cook but still messing up because it means Wanda steps closer, it‚Äôs Peter asking any of them for help with his homework, and Bruce coming in from the cold.
He‚Äôd meant what he‚Äôd told Steve when he‚Äôd said it. It wouldn‚Äôt have been the right choice, not if they were going into the Accords with all those secrets between them... but given time. Oh, the past cannot be changed, but the future is still theirs for the taking. Maybe it can
‚ÄúReally? How does that work?‚Äù he asked ‚Äì and Tony watched his fingers twitch, like he was itching to draw what the forest guardian might look like.
It‚Äôs a dangerous, risky, heart-breaking thing to hoard, but contrary to popular belief, a dragon doesn‚Äôt choose their hoard.
‚ÄúI can promise lab space, a shooting range, state of the art gym, weapons upgrades, no bills, no rent, and hey, team building, right? I‚Äôve got to renovate anyway after the damage. Let‚Äôs customise and build a clubhouse.‚Äù Tony implored, and though Natasha looked no less suspicious, and Steve no less confused, the Avengers come to stay in the tower.
There had been one emotional evening in which Tony had admitted to carrying it around and wearing it, and tried to give it back. Steve had smiled through his sadness and guilt, and told Tony that it was his, his ring and his choice, as it had always been since Steve had bought it years ago, just after Sokovia. It‚Äôs sat in Tony‚Äôs drawer since, and for all intents and purposes, at the back of his mind.
Steve turns towards the door then ‚Äì he hadn‚Äôt realised that Bruce, Rhodey and Natasha had slipped in to join Bucky and Sam at some point, but he can hear- no he can‚Äôt, it‚Äôs impossible, surely it is-
‚ÄúI meant mine too,‚Äù Steve promises him, even as Tony‚Äôs pulling back. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not ready t-to part.‚Äù Steve‚Äôs voice cracks, he‚Äôs crying in earnest and Tony is desperately trying not to, because they
, bordering on desperate. It‚Äôs insistent and the second Tony‚Äôs brain catches up and kisses Steve back, it‚Äôs all tongue and teeth and
‚ÄúWell of course, everyone knows that the two of you were-‚Äú Steve began, and Tony cut him off with a kiss, just a soft, chaste one, lasting barely more than a second.
He forces himself to sit up, resists the urge to throw up when the world spins, and finds himself staring at that little box again. He drinks it in, and wonders ‚Äì like the damn thing hasn‚Äôt been plaguing his thoughts for weeks ‚Äì when Steve got it? Before Ultron? Before Washington? Because honestly, doesn‚Äôt that make all the difference‚Ä¶ the circumstances changed so much. He hasn‚Äôt thrown it away, sold it back or lost it ‚Äì it should count for something, but Tony is the King of second guessing, and Steve‚Äôs a precious fuck about his money like Tony couldn‚Äôt buy him the world if he asked for it.
, and that‚Äôs worth the universe to me. I- I‚Äôm not half as good at anything as when I‚Äôm doing it next to you. And that‚Äôs the truth. So this is my promise ‚Äì that I will always strive to be next to you, and to be the man you deserve.‚Äù
‚Äù Clint‚Äôs voice breaks over her name when she leads the way into the meeting room T‚ÄôChalla has graciously loaned them. Tony follows, swallowing, but Clint crashes into Natasha before he sees Tony. He buries his face in the junction of her neck, hugging her tightly, and Natasha seems as shocked as Tony at the display of affection, but she hugs him back, kisses the top of his head. Clint pulls away after a long moment ‚Äì and the dark bags under his eyes are immediately obvious, his hair clearly in need of a wash, and there‚Äôs blood starting to stain through the bandages on his knuckles. Clint mouths
‚ÄúWhy would you argue with me on this Steve? You can bring back Barnes, and Sam, give our son back his best friends, Thor his brother back, his
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have a good reason, in retrospect.‚Äù He admitted. ‚ÄúI never told anyone, and then it was what was best for the company, and then it was best to protect-‚Äú he cut himself off, and smiled at her. ‚ÄúRhodey‚Äôs only known since Afghanistan, and Thor worked it out. No one else knew up until today.‚Äù Pepper sniffed.
‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to.‚Äù Tony promises him. ‚ÄúTalk to me, trust me, let me return the favour and I promise you on every deity we‚Äôve met and the scary amount I never want to meet-‚Äú Steve laughs at that, making air ghost over Tony‚Äôs lips in a puff, ‚Äú- and I promise you. Together.‚Äù
‚ÄúHe‚Äôll wake up.‚Äù Bucky grumbles. ‚ÄúOr I‚Äôm gonna hav‚Äô words.‚Äù He won‚Äôt even be looking at Steve, so Steve doesn‚Äôt look back. He hums, but it‚Äôs a hollow noise. He realises that Sam and Bucky are playing cards when Sam lets out a little ‚Äúha!‚Äù
I have some small notes and plans for this universe should I get to them - would y'all want them adding to this, or to a series? :)
Villain of the Week ‚Äì with a particle gun. That leaves them all stood weaponless, with no way to stop him. Mjolnir will reform, but not yet, and one more blast with that gun, and the Avengers will be dust.
Next time they get back to Wakanda ‚Äì and the gap is only a month, thank goodness ‚Äì it‚Äôs not for business, despite what Tony‚Äôs calendar says. T‚ÄôChalla, Natasha, Clint, Tony, Sam, Vision and Wanda sit down for dinner.
to find a way to return to it, the sickness doesn‚Äôt set in ‚Äì but when a dragon loses hope‚Ä¶ clocks tick in disjointed patterns, caused by the universe in no science Tony can understand.
Steve there is here, Tony hadn‚Äôt considered the possibility that Steve might be someone he could run into. Tony opens his door, and there he is, dressed neatly like it‚Äôs early morning and not 2am when everyone should be asleep. Steve seems tired and drawn in a way that shouldn‚Äôt be possible with the serum, and he stares at Tony with wide blue eyes like a dear caught in headlights ‚Äì ¬†Tony imagines he looks much the same.
.‚Äù Steve doesn‚Äôt know whose voice cracks worse, and they‚Äôre both dragging each other into the room then, to sit at the edge of his bed and in the god-forsaken plastic chair. ‚ÄúNot yet, you‚Äôre fucking not, what the hell were you
Something that holds pride of place within, the last piece that the dragon will defend and protect more than any other piece. Maria‚Äôs had been a journal of
‚ÄúVigorously.‚Äù It‚Äôs paired with a ridiculous little eyebrow wiggle, but it works, and Rhodey‚Äôs face softens. His glare comes back as he turns to Steve ‚Äì but there‚Äôs no spoken threat. One isn‚Äôt needed, after the dressing down Rhodey gave him when they first reformed, and that‚Äôs almost worse.
Peter‚Äôs still unconscious in the hospital bed. Steve can‚Äôt let go of his hand, won‚Äôt let go. Peter can‚Äôt wake up here alone. Steve even made them move the bed ‚Äì he sits between Peter and the door, the only defence left that he can provide, keeping Peter‚Äôs right hand safe in his. His left is bandaged up, apparently healing fine, and Steve hopes the doctors are right.
It‚Äôs a moment so similar to the last time Steve had almost asked him, that Tony thinks it‚Äôs perfect. He leans back up to kiss Steve, slow and soft and languid ‚Äì he could kiss Steve for
‚ÄúOf course, O‚Äô Mighty Crimson One.‚Äù The agent carrying it replied, hands shaking but voice firm, and Tony huffed his approval of the address, and the agent scurried away.
Clint exclaimed from somewhere behind him, standing out amongst the shock that was yelled behind him. Tony grumbled a laugh, advancing in two steps to tower over the gun-wielding villain, wings stretched wide and high. The Villain (Particle Man?) had gone extremely pale.
‚ÄúDragon Jewel‚Äôs are impervious to decay, but that... I‚Äôve never heard of a soul hoarder. Dragons don‚Äôt believe in star fates for a reason. I cannot bare to lose a jewel Thor.‚Äù
ashamed of his heritage, but he‚Äôd learnt early on that older generations didn‚Äôt care to do business with dragons. Thus, his eyes were merely golder than they should be, and Tony hoarded in his heart but never in a way that could be deemed more than eccentric, a way that could be deemed
Tony breaks himself away from the hug, kissing Steve soundly, before- whacking him over the head. ‚ÄúWhat the
Steve‚Äôs in his dress uniform, and Tony in a deep blue suit ‚Äì Pepper had suggested blue and bronze for colours, and Natasha (who‚Äôd called dibs on Wedding Planner and then dared them with a perfectly raised eyebrow to tell her no) had leapt at it. It was rustic and simple, and it was
He slumps down against the wall when he gets there, knees pulled up, and flips open the damn thing. The screen blinks brightly at him in the dim room.
He drops down next to Steve on the sofa, carefully picking a moment where Steve‚Äôs pencil is nowhere near the paper so he won‚Äôt mess anything up. Tony had had a witty comment on the tip of his tongue when he‚Äôd decided on this plan, but now, in the face of Steve‚Äôs shock and cautious little smile, all he can do is smile back and get comfy.
Were it not for the gaping hole in Tony‚Äôs chest and the rainforest outside the window, Tony could almost be home.
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not what you were going to say.‚Äù Tony snaps, and Steve sighs, but it‚Äôs defeated, not exasperated like-
It‚Äôs been a long time now. Maybe no time at all ‚Äì a week returned in the face of almost two years gone, well, it‚Äôs nothing at all, is it? He still hasn‚Äôt celebrated. How can he? Bucky and Sam are back by his side ‚Äì hell, they won‚Äôt fucking
, Tony!‚Äù He yells it, and immediately feels the shame burn on his face, but he won‚Äôt take it back. ‚ÄúI- It doesn‚Äôt mean enough to me, Tony, not at the cost of‚Ä¶ No.‚Äù
Steve can‚Äôt get the words out of his head. He still doesn‚Äôt know if Peter meant them. He doesn‚Äôt know what they‚Äôll do if he did ‚Äì not that he knows any more about what they‚Äôll do if he didn‚Äôt, but that still seems like less of a shit show.
, and Tony spent so much of the day before grinning that his face hurt even before Rhodey was escorting him up the aisle. That‚Äôd been Tony‚Äôs choice, and he hadn‚Äôt thought about how big it really was until a slightly tipsy Rhodey was crying on his shoulder about honour and brotherhood and sounding eerily like Thor that Tony had had trouble not laughing at him.
back that he hadn‚Äôt been expecting, but he grins and shows Natasha the message who smiles and retrieves her own phone from her pocket.
The new Accords go through with little protest. Each of the Avengers, both new and former, are invited to sign it, and a newly awoken, raw but safe James Barnes comes along too.
Tony treasured that book as much as a dragon can treasure something that is not part of the hoard, and sometimes thought of it as his jewel too, in place of his Mama. How can a soul hoarder dragon have a jewel, after all? That would be the equivalent of having a soulmate, and those are extremely rare, if they even exist at all.
The wedding isn‚Äôt big, despite what everyone ‚Äì Steve included ‚Äì had thought Tony would want. While the Avengers now recognise Tony‚Äôs so much less of a socialite than the media portrays him, when it‚Äôs his choice, they all still think of him as a show-off; and marrying Captain America is a pretty big fucking achievement to flaunt.
The talks go well. Tony‚Äôs playing Devil‚Äôs Advocate for the accords, travelling more than is strictly necessary, but Pepper has his back. It‚Äôs the only good thing in this entire shit storm that she‚Äôs so firmly in his corner, managing Stark Industries with such grace and dignity that Tony still loves her. Never quite like he loves Steve; with her it‚Äôs soft, and quiet, and easy. It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ pure, an admiration and a large measure of care that he loves her with. She returns in, the quirk of her eyebrow and the brush of her fingers, but it‚Äôs not the same as being
He was curled up on his floor, partially shifted ‚Äì he‚Äôd once been able to choose the size of his shift, from two feet to thirty, but now he found it more difficult ‚Äì but now where the blankets weren‚Äôt enough to hide him, his wings did the trick.
‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt hoard, like, something completely intangible like music, do you?‚Äù Bruce joked, and Tony shook his head.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre okay,‚Äù Peter mumbles into Tony‚Äôs shoulder. Tony leans back and flicks his forehead, before immediately hugging him close again.
‚ÄúWell, that settles it. My boys. My best boys. God,‚Äù Tony smiles, glancing between them. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to miss you.
public apology three days ago when they‚Äôd all landed back on American soil for the first time, but Tony had watched it on the TV, alone, fiddling with the ring on his finger. ¬†Tony‚Äôs eyes hadn‚Äôt left him then, but now Tony barely spares him a glance.
‚ÄúDoes he make you happy?‚Äù Rhodey asks, and Tony hopes his sincerity shows in his eyes because he can‚Äôt help but reply;
It‚Äôs two months beyond Day Zero ‚Äì as Rhodey‚Äôs taken to calling it, and honestly, the ridiculousness of it is one of the few things that makes Tony smile ‚Äì when he finally has to visit T‚ÄôChalla.
‚ÄúNo more masks,‚Äù she tells him, ‚Äúno more lies.‚Äù Tony only nods his agreement, not trusting his voice. ‚ÄúI missed you.‚Äù She tells him, and Tony relaxes slightly, bumps his shoulder against hers.
‚ÄúTony‚Ä¶‚Äù Steve is pleading, and Tony pulls him down to kiss him ‚Äì a first and a last all at once. Tony kisses him as he always did, like he‚Äôs got all the time in the universe to savour this moment, and Steve tries, but he knows the end is coming, know it acutely in a way he never has before. The train, the plane, Washington, Sokovia, Siberia‚Ä¶ none of it had the finality of this soft goodbye kiss.
Tony fingers the ring in his pocket, and dropping it into the pocket of his sleep pants, decides that he‚Äôs going to go for a walk ‚Äì he has free reign of this wing of the palace, after all, and sleep eludes him as it often does now-a-days.
‚ÄúTony.‚Äù He corrects her absent-mindedly, startling them both with it. ‚ÄúCall me Tony.‚Äù He says. It‚Äôs not quite an
‚ÄúImpervious scales would be useful right now,‚Äù Thor agreed, giving Tony a pointed glance. Tony sighed, and steeled himself for a moment.
It completely took Tony by surprise one evening, upon waking to Steve‚Äôs gentle hands pulling a blanket over him on the common room couch, to realise that Steve was his jewel.
Steve‚Äôs grin was almost blinding, and then he leant forward to kiss Tony, hard, bringing his hands up to cradle Tony‚Äôs face. Tony let out a little noise of shock, and then let his hand twine into Steve‚Äôs hair. It was‚Ä¶ thrilling, to kiss someone like this; not partially shifted, no, but with the
.‚Äù Tony smiled as best a dragon could, and Clint gave him a half salute, before sending another piece flying. Tony had to flap to catch that one ‚Äì but he was easily getting the hang of it again, and with the fourth piece, he did a graceful spin mid-air to catch it. Thor applauded, and just like that the team were laughing again.
‚ÄúYeah man, but what‚Äôs your hoard? I bet you were gryphon because of your lack of one!‚Äù Natasha shot him a glare, but Tony merely sighed.
These two argue not for their lives, but for their deaths. Neither of them wants to save a world without the other in it. A third figure, as yet unnoticed but with a significant role in the events of the past and the events of yet to come, is on the precipice of realisation.
‚ÄúJust the same,‚Äù Natasha told him softly, ‚Äústable, and will wake when he does.‚Äù Tony whined without his own permission, and buried himself a little further into his blankets. Natasha just watched, and then moved to curl up against his chest ‚Äì his wings curled round them both automatically when she shoved him to roll onto his back. ‚ÄúIs this okay?‚Äù she asked, and Tony nodded.
, he‚Äôd remembered to apologise. Tony had found it easier than he ever thought he might‚Äôve to fall into conversation with Sam, about Rhodey but also Pepper, about the Accords but also Stark Industries, and then about BARF and veterans and Clint on Tony‚Äôs other side had dragged them into a video game debate.
Tony still doesn‚Äôt tell him about the ring, though, and not about how it lives in his pocket, slipped on slipped off, slipped on slipped off‚Ä¶
‚ÄúOkay, Tony.‚Äù Steve laughed, allowing himself to be pulled into the elevator. Tony was bouncing on the balls of his feet ‚Äì he‚Äôd wanted to share this with Steve since he‚Äôd realised the man was his jewel, but up until now he hadn‚Äôt known
The ring nestles in deep red material, a thick golden band with a blue star inlaid. It‚Äôs simplistic, yet it‚Äôs
The phone isn‚Äôt broken, and there‚Äôs texts waiting, but Tony won‚Äôt look at them now. He doesn‚Äôt owe Steve that. He sits down in the desk chair, and rests his head on the desk ‚Äì it‚Äôs cool, but it won‚Äôt soothe him. Rhodey‚Äôs got a long road to any semblance of recovery, and Vision is just drifting, more robotic now that even Jarvis ever was, and Tony aches. He aches with everything he‚Äôs lost, and he can‚Äôt pinpoint why or how, just that it‚Äôs his fault.
Tony enjoys regaling him with tales, and he ends up laid on the couch in the lab with his head on Rhodey‚Äôs lap and the bots gathered around him.
‚ÄúCan I ask you a question?‚Äù Steve asked. He was laid on the couch in Tony‚Äôs workshop, carefully reading through the journal. Tony spun on his stool to face him ‚Äì completely human today, it was more comfortable to be wholly one or the other, and certainly more stable, dragons that chose to remain partially Shifted had more control that he did, though he would gain control with age.
‚ÄúIf‚Ä¶ that morning. If I had asked,‚Äù Steve looks for all the world like he‚Äôd rather be anywhere but here, ‚Äúwould you have said yes?‚Äù he asked softly, and Tony knew what he was referring to. The ring, that Steve had no idea was anywhere but that desk, burned in his pocket.
Tony will not let Steve give his life for the universe, not now, not ever again. Tony had known since Nebula had explained to him what always awaits on Vormir, the crime to be committed, the sacrifice to be made‚Ä¶ he‚Äôd known that he would never wield the gauntlet. He thinks Nebula knows that too. ‚ÄúOf course.‚Äù Tony says, and he can‚Äôt look at Steve‚Äôs face. He‚Äôd known who would have to come with him too, as much as he‚Äôd tried to avoid it ‚Äì but who else could he ask this of? ‚ÄúOf course, you would be.‚Äù
‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt realise though! Sure, Nat‚Äôs part faye and we‚Äôre comfortable around each other because of that magical thrum- not that she knows what I am yet- and Clint‚Äôs definitely got some gryphon ancestry somewhere, and Bruce has the weirdest lycanthropy you‚Äôve ever seen, but Steve‚Äôs
‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt even sign out, did you?‚Äù he asked, shaking his head and standing to fetch Steve a plate.
Steve‚Äôs grinning before he‚Äôs even quite realised he‚Äôs doing it, and Tony‚Äôs shoving past the nurse trying to box him downstairs to admit him, breaking into a run to make it down the corridor before someone can stop him. Steve‚Äôs sweeps him up into a hug in the doorway, unable to help himself, but Tony accepts it gladly, and god, Tony‚Äôs alive, Tony‚Äôs alive alive alive, lungs breathing heart pounding-
IS MY HUSBAND? I NEED TO KICK HIS ASS!‚Äù Steve chokes on a laugh, even as Rhodey and Natasha crowd him out of the doorway, pushing past into the corridor to stare ‚Äì the shouter has just rounded the corner. ‚ÄúNO I AM
‚ÄúI was‚Ä¶ angry.‚Äù She had tried to explain. ‚ÄúI thought you were treating me like a child, or, or a weapon to be locked away, and then when-‚Äú she doesn‚Äôt say his name, but Tony hears it loud and clear and only just suppresses a flinch with it, ‚Äú
, Steve.‚Äù Tony had started, wiping his eyes amid laughter. ‚ÄúI- I‚Äôm an inventor. I am the Futurist, but despite all my endeavours and all I can imagine, I cannot imagine a future without you in it. Quite frankly, I don‚Äôt want to. You‚Äôre‚Ä¶‚Äù he‚Äôd had to swallow around the lump in his throat then, and gestured up at the darkening sky above them, ‚Äúin all of this, and everything we see as Avengers, in each insane battle and what-the-fuck moment we ever had, it‚Äôs all only worth something to me if I get to tell you at the end of the day. I have seen the stars, my love, and you‚Äôre the brightest of all them.‚Äù
first kiss had been nothing like Tony ‚Äì like either of them ‚Äì had thought it would be. It had been absent-minded, automatic, in a way that loving each other always was. As simple and easy and obvious as one‚Äôs need to breathe. A simple kiss to the corner of Steve‚Äôs mouth as Tony was leaving for SI ‚Äì running off too little sleep, no one else in the kitchen except for Steve, who‚Äôd just made them both breakfast to make sure Tony ate ‚Äì and it was forgotten until later that evening.
‚ÄúSo am I.‚Äù Tony muttered after a long moment of silence. Steve looked heartbroken for him for a moment, but then the moment was shattered by Jarvis informing them both that Clint was ordering pizza for dinner.
‚ÄúNot always though... did you know there‚Äôs a dragon who hoards Yosemite?‚Äù Tony told him, and delighted in the way Steve‚Äôs eyes went wide with wonder.
Steve stood in the doorway to the common floor, pale, still clearly not fully healed, and chest heaving. Tony narrowed his eyes. ‚ÄúS
It‚Äôd fit him perfectly. He‚Äôs so certain it would, and he longs to try it on but it‚Äôs‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not something he gets now. He‚Äôs not even sure when he
Honestly, Tony should do a Peter and cite too much homework as a reason not to go. With the World Council still breathing down his neck, he‚Äôs‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs not sure. Does he not want to go because he won‚Äôt want to come back? Or because it‚Äôs not safe? And it‚Äôs not, for him or for T‚ÄôChalla, or Them
It throws Tony off guard, because Natasha doesn‚Äôt show anything akin to weakness unless that in itself is an attack. She smiles when Tony falls into step beside her, though, small but genuine.
‚ÄúWere you going to tell us?‚Äù Bruce asked eventually, and Tony nodded, hastily swallowing his mouthful.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine now, honestly.‚Äù He insisted, ‚ÄúI just wanted to see you.‚Äù He admitted, watching Tony as he leapt off the table to slink up to him. He circled him once, and then huffed. Thor held out the cloak from the back of his chair without prompting, and Tony nestled himself under it to shift without losing his modesty. He managed to shift so that he was stood up with the cloak wrapped around him, and he glared at Steve despite how his heart leapt to see him.
Steve gets up, ignoring how even his body aches at how long he‚Äôs been still, and sticks his head out of the room door ‚Äì and surely they can all hear it now.
on Steve‚Äôs face is beautiful. He looks like Tony‚Äôs just handed him the universe, with each and every little thing perfectly how he wants it.
He doesn‚Äôt know, but now they‚Äôre eating shawarma and talking about what they‚Äôre going to do now, and the dragon half of Tony that usually lays dormant is urging for them to be close, for Tony to keep them close. It‚Äôs probably why the words,
, finally, throws the phone. He doesn‚Äôt pause as he forces himself out of Steve‚Äôs old space to see if it shattered against the wall, the box dropped back into the drawer.
‚ÄúHey Tones, catch!‚Äù Clint called out, and Tony turned just in time to bite the thrown bit of food out of the air before it smacked him in the snout. Clint whooped.
Anthony Stark-Rogers flinches at question Steven Rogers-Stark poses to him and wishes there was a way to avoid it.
They‚Äôre on the jet to Wakanda, yet again. This time, now the attention is lifted, Tony‚Äôs been asked if he‚Äôll talk to Clint. He‚Äôs actually dreading that conversation, because if Clint‚Äôs just going to be a total dick like he was on the Raft, Tony might actually kill him ‚Äì but he‚Äôs hopeful, just a little bit, because T‚ÄôChalla‚Äôs been making pledges for alterations he never would‚Äôve six months ago. Someone ‚Äì more than one someone ‚Äì is helping him with this, and god does Tony
but suddenly the compound is full of life ‚Äì Peter brings the few friends in on the secret with him when he visits, and there‚Äôs more super-powered individuals coming to light that train here some days. James ‚Äì Tony still can‚Äôt quite call him Bucky, but it feels like a when and not an if ‚Äì is getting better between psychologists, BARF, and the horrific yet entertaining friendship that is Bucky, Sam and Clint put together. They even drag Rhodey into their prank wars, and Tony has hours of footage saved by Friday for when he needs to laugh.
‚Äì and grins brightly. ‚ÄúNo fuckin‚Äô way.‚Äù He mutters, getting up even though it dislodges the table and the gameplay, ignoring the other‚Äôs yells. ‚ÄúYeah, you can hear him Stevie, what the
‚ÄúI had wondered what you were.‚Äù Bruce replied with a smile, and Natasha took a seat to his other side to agree.
Steve wonders, idly, if they‚Äôre the only people in the world dealing with a loss right now, or if there‚Äôs still chaos on the streets outside. A part of him wonders if the sky is still as blue as it was, but the rest of him knows it won‚Äôt be, not when Iron Man will never- will never-
