“Don’t do that. Don’t think of what’s been. The powerful magic he’s used isn’t something any of us mortals could have fought again,” Tony says and sits beside Steve.
Steve finds his way back to a bend in the maze and then presses the cuff of his shield. It activates. Inhaling once to summons the courage, he exhales and then slams his technological wonder of a shield into the rock wall. Sparks fly, sizzling but he’s not harmed. On the other hand, the wall bares the scorch marks of the impact. A trail, like Hazel and Gretel.  Hopefully there’s no creatures in the maze that might consume burns in stones.
“Why wouldn’t it?” Tony asked. “We regularly share dreams in your 1940s tenement apartment. Why not share the moment of my mother’s death?” The tension wasn’t there this time, the words were angry but hopeless, and that terrified Steve.
“That’s what I’m trying to do, you freak,” Steve replies.
Yinsen shrugs his shoulders. “Have you not heard of the lion with the thorn in its paw? Those who help it, are rewarded.”
"I need to ask you or rather, tell you," Pym says and glances at the dissembling of the meeting. His gaze drifts over to Stane, his expression twisting. He steps away when Obie peers over at them. He gives a short wave and says. "Good luck, son."
He admits, “Yeah, I get it, darling. I do.”
Tony quirked an eyebrow. He hadn’t considered those facts, but the truth was Steve was rumored to be an excellent tactician and a strategist. Examining their resources and projecting how to utilize them would help the pack. He studied Steve and then said, “We’re a team but more than that we are a pack.”
Steve only manages a gurgle and then blood bubbles out of his mouth.
“I am not that person- not that Hydra Steve person!” Steve retorts.
Before Steve settles back into the chair, Tony catches his wrist. "Don't do that, don't stand on ceremony. You look wonderful."
Tony resists the urge to stick his tongue out at Steve as he’s invited into the other apartment which is bigger and better furnished than Steve’s little hovel. Granted, the furnishings are anything but new, but there’s a couch and a cushioned chair positioned in front of an old tube television. A galley kitchen with an actual stove and oven (not just the hotplate Steve has) and a real sized refrigerator is tucked into one corner. The sink is small but still functional. There’s heavy drapes on the double window which are closed shielding the sun or something else. From Tony’s vantage point he counts four doors in the hallway. One has to be the bathroom, the others might be bedrooms. It’s much nicer than Steve’s studio though far from luxurious.
“I get that, but I do – I trust you, Steve.”
In the next day, Clint announced that they would be traveling to his farm in the mid-west. He didn’t take questions so the team prepared to go. Tony showed up on Steve’s floor as he packed a duffle bag and shouldered his shield. It had only been yesterday that they’d found each other, and Tony longed to be closer to Steve, as close as he could manage. It felt as if a magnet drew him to Steve. He wondered if it was some kind of puppy love or if it was the soul bond strengthening.
Frank smirks and gazes back into the apartment for a long moment and something comes over his eyes and Tony can only call it hunger and rage at the same time. "Did what I paid to do."
“Must have been a shock to you. Having to eat so much.”
“Nope, no glasses.” Tony shakes his head.
According to Doctor Erskine the serum simply amplifies the character of the person. It’s not about getting the serum to stop Ultron – it’s about Steve stopping Ultron. The serum has nothing to do with it at all.
Pepper percolates with happiness as she reports the different headlines to him. It’s a rare day that he’s visiting his office at Stark Industries. Over the course of the last week, the different tabloids and entertainment sites praised the new power couple. Darker theories popped up – the US government planted Captain Rogers to draw Tony under their wing. Happier news continued to counter those stories with theories ranging from stories based on An Officer and a Gentleman with manipulated images for Tony in Steve’s arms to stories of a lonely soldier who met Tony when he escaped from Afghanistan. The latter one came precariously closes to the truth.
As he tries to release him, Tony makes a horribly wrecked noise and shivers. Steve hushes him and then waits until he can leave without Tony getting too upset. As Steve stands, he says to Pietro, “Often people who’ve had seizures need to sleep for several hours. Let him. I’ll be back soon.”
“Pierce is a piss-ant.”
“And then you closed up shop.”
Blu only huffs and watches with those intensely blue eyes. It’s disconcerting that the lion eases Tony’s troubled soul. Only hours ago, Blu terrified him, but now the lion sits like an expectant pet waiting for dinner.
Steve entered the true safe house that looked more like a loft apartment without the vast windows. Areas were sectioned off with partial walls. None of it looked like a prison which was something that had concerned Steve. The partial walls were at least 10 feet tall but the room itself was probably 15 feet in height at least. He caught the sounds of someone in a kitchen and other sounds of people speaking lowly. Clint ushered him through the gray painted vestibule area around a half wall to a kitchen. It looked utilitarian at best. The appliances were dingy white and the counter tops were probably Formica. Not the latest rage that was for sure.
“Like I said, California, the wild West, more my style. The East Coast is ruled by convention, and I and my little crew are not,” Tony says.
Tony’s going to have to look up this Natasha person at some point. He leans back, bracing himself on his elbows on the bed. “Aren’t you a little uncomfortable with the idea of possibly being watched?”
“Wakey, wakey.”
That jolted Tony back to the present and out of the weavings of the soul bond. “What?” Tony asked as Clint and Sam along with Bruce headed toward the elevators with their luggage as well.
Tony only places a finger on his lips and indicates with a quiet shake of his head for Steve to remain silent. He does. Tony trails kisses up and down Steve’s chest, his modeled abdomen, and then to the fine tuff of hair next to his already rigid cock again.
His words uttered only days ago ricochet in his head like bullets.
“Let us sit,” Wong said as they all entered the room. Both Natasha and Steve pulled a folding chair from the stack in the corner of the room, but Wong settled cross legged on the floor. Steve stopped mid-chair set up and silently questioned Natasha. She lifted a shoulder and then put the chair back on the stack. Without hesitation, she sat across from Wong. Steve looked at the chair in his grasp and then at Wong. He really had no choice, but he hated giving over all of his fate to anyone. The only person he’d ever really done that with was Doctor Erskine.
“Steve, damn it, Steve,” Tony says and rushes to his side. He can’t bend down all the way, the armor doesn’t allow it. But Steve’s perched on a load of ammunition, blood streaked down his face, his chest a massive wound, bleeding freely. “No, no, no, we were supposed to go together. Together. I can get you out. I can get you.”
Pepper steps up to the desk and lays a pen down next to the paper. “You’ll be signing it here as well as.” She places a tablet on the desk. “Here.”
Steve mustered the courage and said, “Tell me.”
Tony opens his arms that had been crossed over his chest. “You speak like an artist.”
“Because you threatened his children, you bastard,” Steve jeered. “What kind of man uses innocent children as a tool to get what he wants?”
Before Tony can say anything else, Steve falls off into a fitful sleep. Tony moves off and sits as the workbench, trying to rectify what he saw. But it doesn’t collide together right, it only smashes up all his ideas of reality. At one point, when he glances over at Steve he hears him talking.
“You’re just tired,” Pepper says. She’s sweet to say so; she always trying to keep a positive attitude. “You said it yourself somedays when you push too much the interface goes wonky.”
Tony thinks of himself as a futurist, but he knows his history. While he agrees with the abolitionists that omegas should have more rights and be freer to express themselves, he understands the order of nature. There’s a force to nature and their biology that for centuries was disregarded as hocus-pocus, but the truth of alphas’ dominance, betas’ neutrality, and omegas’ supplication cannot be ignored.
Steve remains perfectly still in the anteroom of the prince’s workshop. In this room, Steve cleaned the instruments of his trade, now he hides from Stane instead of being of service to Tony during his time of need. Circumstances force Steve to sit on the sidelines while Obie and Tony discuss the current state of affairs. If Steve had been five minutes faster, then he would be safely tucked under Tony’s desk, cock in mouth, being useful and satiated at the same time. Part of Steve wants to escape through the other door and slip silently to his quarters or to the prince’s, but then curiosity rouses him to stay put and listen to two of the most powerful men in the Conclave talk of war, factions, and the possibilities of a coup.
Tony denies it. “He’s a meat eater. I’m meat, just glad he’s not here. Hoping he eats them.” He shakes away the concern that bubbles underneath the calm. Today he changes everything. He isn’t planning on dying, he isn’t planning on spending the last days of his life in his hell hole. First, he has to do something about the damned battery connected to his chest, then he’s going to blow this fucking place wide open – literally.
“That’s not what I’m saying, or not saying,” Bruce replied. He sat forward but hunched his shoulders, closing in on himself. “I don’t think I have a right to share something that was deeply personal for him. I don’t think that’s the way this should work.”
“What do you mean?”
Natasha waited as Bruce exited to confer with JARVIS. She touched Steve’s shoulder and said, “Steve, you’re not alone.”
“You’re burning up,” Tony says. “I thought most of the infection had passed. I don’t know what to do.”
“Hey,” Tony said. He thumbed over his shoulder. “Just got a message. I thought you might want to know, Natasha is on her way back.” Tony lightly stroked Steve’s arm. “You don’t have to deal with it.” He changed his tune. “
“A hit?”
“You are causing quite a stir.”
A warm flush of heat warms Steve’s face. “You can definitely see me again, Sam.”
Tony agreed silently and slipped past Bruce to enter the hospital room. Seeing Steve still and silent in the critical care unit ripped a hole in Tony’s chest. There were simple monitors around Steve – surrounding him with their useless readouts. With all of the best medical knowledge at their fingertips no one could answer Tony’s question. Why wouldn’t Steve wake up? What was wrong that he laid in the bed as if cursed to sleep forever. It chilled Tony to the bones to think about it. The seventy year nap Steve had felt like a dark shadow haunting them. Tony sat by Steve’s bedside as the medical staff came and went with no explanations of why this was happening or what could be done to stop it. In the deep corners of Tony’s soul Steve fell farther away as if the soul bond constricted and dried. Tony shuddered at the feeling, knowing something inside of him was dying. It terrified him.
Steve lifted a shoulder in a shrug. “Yeah, why not? I have with Bruce on a rare occasion. Why wouldn’t I want to do it with you? I would love to find out how you design the Iron Man armor. What ticks in your head.”
Steve rotated his shoulders, stretched out his arms and then sat back on the couch. “Okay, ready.”
“Sir, you need to step out of the SUV,” one of the guards directs Tony – who is still sitting by Steve’s side. Where Natasha went, Steve doesn’t know.
“Maybe,” Tony said and then after a pause added, “You know this soul pack thing isn’t going to go anywhere if we don’t figure it out. Strange is right about that.”
“Like the moon and the Earth,” Steve says, and he cannot stop being mesmerized by the touch, their skin to skin contact. “I think I know how to do this.”
“Because, Natasha, never in my mind have you ever been the perfect fit for the head mistress of a brothel,” Steve says. When she doesn’t flinch, he chances a reveal.  “Plus General Fury talks in his sleep.”
At that, Coulson’s look darkened. Even his sallow skin seemed to warm and color. “Not even you.”
Her smile lit up the room. “No, no god or ghost. Maybe we are monsters, I don’t know. We call ourselves Divini.”
Fury nearly growled at Tony. They’d come to an agreement after all, that if Tony took Steve on as his Submissive and the bond sealed it, then the price to pay was his silence. The world would never know that Steve Rogers aka Captain America knelt at Tony’s feet, that he most gratefully licked Tony’s shoes or even groveled with his forehead to the floor – the standard and accepted form of greeting to a Dominant from a Submissive.
“Bucky, don’t.”
Tony is coming back – but in a very different role, as a very different person than Steve had known and grown to love. In the end, a person suffering from amnesia who only had figments of life and memories isn’t the same as the person he loved. Half the time, he felt as if he was mourning Tony’s death while Tony was in his arms.
“Well, maybe it shouldn’t be the one thing we always talk about concerning me. How about we talk about something completely off topic.” Tony drinks the rest of his hot chocolate. “Give it a try.”
“It’s not how long he’ll live I’m worried about.” Natasha finished setting up the intravenous line. Steve had already fallen into a deep slumber. “All humans, no matter how loving they are, will come to resent you. It’s just what happens, Tony. Either they resent you because you haven’t aged and they have or they resent having to act like your caretaker all the time. Or in his case, maybe he resents you because you stole the life he should have had – maybe gotten married, had a family. None of which you can do with him in the current political climate. Holding onto him like you are – it just means that he suffers and resents you in the end.”
“Tony, what are you doing out here?”  He startles and looks up to find Pep walking down the path toward him. “Where is Steven? The meeting starts in five minutes.”
“Oh, yeah. That’s mine.” Steve grimaces and reaches for it, but Tony snatches it back.
“Falcon?” Thor being one of the new residents of the town doesn’t know much of Steve’s history or his connections.
Tony checks the list of attendees for the meeting as Steven speaks. He studies the screen, trying hard not to notice that his omega interrupted him. Also trying hard not to be happy about the fact Steven almost called him Tony. It’s progress. The man must be feeling more comfortable around him. If they are to be successful together as alpha and omega then they must have a working relationship and some kind of companionship. It’s important to set limits, but he also wants the elusive friendship – though he cannot attest to why. “Yes, you were, weren’t you?”
Later Steve learned about vampires and their special powers. About how Thor summoned the thunder and lightning. It seemed too magical to be real, but it was. He’d witnessed it more than once. Natasha had other powers, where she could literally fade into the shadows. She called it realm hopping. He wasn’t sure what that even meant. Yet, he’d witnessed her disappear. He figured she must be older than she looked, much older. Some said from the early last century, others pinned her as the lost daughter of the Russian Czar. Who knew?
Steven halts for only a moment as he moans and sobs out. It’s pretty as he does. Steven’s needy whimpers course over him and the knot overtakes Tony so swiftly, so fast he falls into a haze. He takes his own hand and slides it under Steven’s chin, pausing to grasp the ring of the collar for only a second. He can feel Steven’s tongue work against his knot, feel the weight of it, feel the thickness. He groans as Steven swallows and sucks – his mouth obscenely wide open as he gags on Tony’s cock. Tony reaches further and tugs at his own sac. It causes his knot to harden, to expand even further, and then he squeezes once, twice, the heat rolling off of him. And he’s coming – a flood of semen down a willing throat. It coils and tightens until he comes again.
“Not all of them. Some of them are designed by Justin Hammer. They stink big time.
“I might,” Tony admitted. He peered over his shoulder at Bruce. “But I need to talk to someone-.” He hated this part because now the music in his head swelled and he cringed against it. “I need to talk to Nat or Sam. I’m sorry Bruce, it’s just-.”
CHAPTER 1
The irritation in Tony’s tone softens. “I’m fine.”
“Tony? We need to start the procedure. Now,” Cho insists and then places a hand on Steve’s arm. “Please put him in the cradle.”
Even as he played with these
“Not sure it would make much difference.”
“You don’t, you don’t want to do this,” Tony had said as he crept ever closer to the wide open door. Bucky clutched onto his wrist and dragged him over to the window. With his metal hand, he shattered the window and then pushed Tony out of the pane. He held onto Tony’s shirt, letting him hang out of the window as the shards of glass stabbed and pierced his torso and shoulders. Hanging there, nearly insane with fear, Tony only wanted to explain, to tell Bucky he cared for Steve. He never wanted to hurt him.
Steve cannot refuse, he needs to find Clint but he worries about Bucky. He needs to get on that ranch and find Loki as well- the faster the better. Bucky has been deteriorating at an alarming rate. He barely reaches coherency and lays in a delirium that the doctor cannot alleviate or explain. Natasha, Bruce, and Steve take turns sitting with him, though sometimes Steve has to call in Thor to help out simply because even in his ill state Bucky can be a formidable foe. Luckily, on the third day after Steve sends the telegram to Falcon, Sam Wilson shows up and Steve feels as if a cloud has lifted from his shoulders, and the way ahead clears of fog.
As his mind wanders through the information he collected, Steve nearly misses the turn and Clint grabs his arm and turns him toward the Elite private docks. “This way.”
“You did?”
Steve holds his hand. “Not much. Not as much as you think, I should say. Nothing important. I thought it would be hard being a human again. But the hardest thing is the loneliness, but I’ve been lonely for so long.” His voice drifts away, fading to the edge of the memories  surfacing.
Steve presses his lips together as memories of the evening flood through his brain. Embarrassingly, he’s hot and sweating as he thinks about Tony pressed up against him. He feels the pool drain further down into his groin and he clears his throat. He needs to focus. He’d like to think that the doctor is telling the truth, but the fact remains that Tony and Steve barely know one another. “He doesn’t really know me, does he?”
“Not much, boss,” Penny says. “The records are mixed up. Some of the records say he was with Dany Carbonelli since he was seventeen, other records say that he became his omega when the omega Xi died defending him in the Purge revolt of ’35.”
“I’ll be fine.”
“Well forever is a long time, Maker mine, and you don’t have that. So I decided on something a little more descriptive.”
“Here, let me show you someone.” Tony enters the large master bedroom with its sitting room, sleeping area. He opens the drawer in the nightstand and pulls out his old stuffed toy. “Here, I want you to see this.” He waves Steve gently into the room.
“Does that mean if one person dies the others will as well?” Tony asked because hell he didn’t want that.
“He didn’t,” Steve says.
“Controlling interest in what? My family? My clan? I’m a prime alpha – a dom at that, he can’t even think about it.” The very idea that Estane would even think to fight for Tony’s own family rights appalls him. “Does he even have an Omega warrior?”
“Inside.”
The wickedness assails him. He feels Tony hover closer as if the horror before them, the feelings of hatred, loathing, and the need to inflict pure unadulterated pain – on his maker. The only way to do that according to the AI – destroy everything that Tony loves, that Tony cares for, that Tony wants to keep safe and sacred.
Steve clears his throat and rubs his hands on his khakis. “Steve Rogers. Captain in the US Army. Four tours abroad -.”
Steve grunts into the mattress but manages to nod his head. Tony drags Steve’s arm up and over his shoulders as he bends down.
“The doctors say he’s just sleeping now.”
“Yeah. How did you know?”  Tony sits on the edge of the bed, his shoulders slump.
JARVIS reported, “Captain, Agent Romanoff’s reading states that in reality she is fine but in the game she is gravely injured.”
The doors slide open. Tony shifts his gaze to Rhodey. “I know your intentions are in the right place. I get that Cupcake. But right now, you don’t know what you’re talking about. He’s coming home with me.”
“I’m so fucking hot.” He yanks down his hood. Puffs of fog gather around him as he speaks.
Steve stood there as Tony walked away, hand to his hair and messing it as he left. He turned to T’Challa to voice his appreciation for the safe harbor, but T’Challa quieted him with a look and ushered him to a private room. T’Challa closed the door behind him. The small but cozy room was filled with relics and art of the country’s history. Steve had always been a history buff and imagined immersing himself in the art, finding out about its lineage, where it came from, who made it, how it was made. The colors alone fascinated him. He needed to get back to Tony so he turned his attention to the king.
As he left the observation deck, he caught Bruce say, “Maybe it did.”
“You need to go back to the city,” Banner says.
Tony rolls his eyes. “Of course, it would.”
“I am not leaving you like this, shit. No,” Tony says. “And I can give you anything you need, what do you need? Tell me what you need?” He tugs out his phone and punches in the code.
“Best that you do. Though we depend on our mates as our daylight caretakers, we must also care for them and ensure they stay healthy and willing to pair with us.”
“I know you want it to make sense, but I know that there were forces beyond comprehension at play. The tesseract must be tied to some other forces, forces that change reality, that shift time and space. I don’t know. I can’t tell-.”
“And why shouldn’t I?” Red Skull hisses. “I have been trapped, doomed to be the Soul Keeper, the Guardian of the Soul Stone and the Realm. As I watched you little humans play your games with the soul stone, I remained, always trapped and never freed. The Soul Realm is mine to do with as I please. You are all mine to with as I please. No one moves on beyond this realm without paying their dues to me.”
Steven only whispers, “As you wish, my lord.”
Blu snarls at Tony, but it’s not predatory.
Steve grimaces. “Yeah. A little. How can Ultron decide how I heal? Shouldn’t that be my perception?”
While Tony still hadn’t allowed Steve into the sanctum of his workshop, they ended up spending a lot of time together – especially in the living room area with a lap top between them and Tony explaining bits and pieces of life. In many ways they both cut out the puzzles pieces and linked them together. Steve was a ravenous student, always looking for more, hunting like a predator for things that didn’t fit, for gaps in his knowledge. When he figured it out, the glorious smile he gave Tony always had him running – slipping away to his workshop to get away from Steve – and his ever growing feelings.
Each of the other members of the Avengers studied the mark on Steve’s skin. It wove around his wrist, hot to the touch still, red and purple along the  bones and flesh of his arm.  Tony and Bruce seemed the most interested while Natasha only gave it a passing glance and dismissed it. That was a curious reaction that caused Steve to focus on her rather than the two people leaning over the table, arguing what the brand on his arm might mean.
“You two good friends?” Steve asked and Wong only sneered. “Okay then.”
Steve shrugs. He twists it like it’s some kind of security blanket. “It’s okay.”
“Strange would like to have you overnight. Just for observation-.”
“Not courting, Rogers, you’re not courting anyone,” Steve says and straps on the holster. He grabs for his duster and realizes it's a mess. It's not like he's able to clean it regularly, doing his laundry isn't something he enjoys, takes the whole damned day. He supposes he can deal with the chill and tosses the coat back, but then picks it up anyway. He shrugs it on and goes down the staircase.
“Really, Jarvis, this is a little overboard, don’t you think?”
“Well, yes. But they decided on Prime because of Jane. Well, she’s leaving the station and Loki refuses to go. Says something about owing someone something and the brothel is the best hiding place. Blah, blah, blah.” She waves her hands in the air. “He’s in trouble, that much is clear and Natasha’s considering tossing him out on his ear.”
“We have trouble.”
Hesitantly at first, Steve started, “The Core is the Soul. The Core is in me. I am the Soul.” He heard Natasha’s low tones join his voice.
“We pay you a ransom sum,” Tony states and rolls over onto Steve’s lap, his bare ass revealed by the drape of the sheet.
Another voice chimes in. “Apparently, the serum actually uses that bundle to regulate itself. Without it, the serum is useless. We didn’t know before now. No one knew.”
Steve nods knowing that with their current connection Scott won’t be able to see him. That’s fine with him, the glossy tears that run down his face are no one’s business but his own. “Thanks, Scott.”
“If you want it to be,” Tony whispers, his heart racking a beat in his chest. Steve beams again but with a lazy almost loopy look in his eyes. “I swear Steve if this is low blood sugar, if this is your Kryptonite-.”
Tony has to admit that he does like how Steve treats him. Steve’s curious and intuitive. He asks questions and tries not to insult Tony when inquiring about how to do something for someone who’s blind. He’s actually spent hours studying for the position and Tony’s caught him watching YouTube videos on how to interact and assist the visually impaired. He’s dedicated and loyal. But that just makes him sound like Tony’s seeing eye dog, and he’s so much more than that to Tony.
“Don’t say it, Captain,” Tony says and he drops his hand from Steve’s face and a coldness sweeps over him. Tony tugs open the ties of his shirt to reveal a scarred chest and a small metal device over his heart. “We live on borrowed time, Captain, all of us. Why do you insist on cheating yourself out of happiness?”
“Then we stay?” Steve asks. His hands have stilled on the potatoes.
Well, that confirmed Steve’s hopes that Fury might still be in play and may still be on his side, though he had no idea about the rest of the coven or their humans. How many were in cells like these? How many of the coven were chained to crosses on the rooftop baking in the sunlight? Just the thought of those crosses, of Tony nailed to one of them. sent Steve into a rage and he bucked against the manacles only to have them turn from chains to solid mass again, keeping him in place. He screamed and cried out.
“Dismiss me for what? For Tony having a seizure. Not even Doctor Strange could have prevented that!” Steve says.
“I have seen him since,” she confesses and that does draw his attention. He looks up at her. “I contacted him, after – well, after. I wanted to know, to find out if he was okay. He’s a Prime Alpha. He was your alpha but he was our Prime. You know that right?”
“Don’t do that. You always did that!” He places a hand over his heart.
“Don’t bother. I told Steve the same thing, but he ignored me and still tried.”
Natasha sips her drink once, considers him, nods, and then downs the rest of it. “I’ll see what I can do. But no promises.”
“Why?” Steve sighed, his shoulders drooped, and the figures outside stirred as the winds picked up and the gray clouds beyond the windows funneled and threatened. “Because that’s what I do. I’m Captain America.” He wasn’t looking at any of them, just the sky, the storms on the horizon. “That’s what I was made to do.”
“Yeah,” Bruce said with a nod. “Yeah.” He shook his head then and muttered, “I’m really not that kind of doctor. I’m not a healer.”
“Son of a -.” Steve said as he climbed up the hill toward the meadow only to be confronted by another six Legion robots. One raised its palm to shoot but Steve rammed it with the shield and then pitched himself to roll back down the hill. “Iron Man, I need your help.”
“And you didn’t chose my side, Nat.” He’s not blaming her or accusing her and she understands that – he sees it in those eyes that hold worlds.
Steve jerks a few more times and then collapses on top of Tony as he finishes. They both lie there, spent, overcome, and panting. Steve doesn’t forget Tony. He leans down and kisses him, again spending time to fill him with devotion and caring. As he slips out of Tony, they neck again. It’s sweet.
“Audio off,” Tony says and then commands, “Jarwin, tell Jamison to assist him.” He pulls the glasses off and shakes his head. “He’ll never have true fealty to me. He loves the Carbonelli alpha. Been dead for decades but he is so obviously in love.”
“See,” Tony says to no one. “That’s why sledding sucks. You spend most of your time climbing up the hill to get three seconds of thrill time. Give me the armor any day of the week.”
That is the height of vulgarity. Everyone knows the Soul Companion isn't named, can't be named until the moment of pairing. Pairing can happen at any time with anyone.  But he knows the possibility of pairing is slim to none for his Soul. It's broken, unhealthy, and unwanted. He accepted that years ago.
Tony crawled to the footwell behind the passenger side while Steve pulled the front seat up as close to the dashboard as possible, but then laid the back to the seat down to shade Tony. It would be a tight fit for Tony but he would be safe.
“Yeah,” Steve says and rummages until he finds the can of chicken stew. “Ma used to tell me of the Fae, or Faeries. They would come to the human world and snatch children, leave a changeling in their place. If a mother caught one of the Fae stealing their child, she’d have to yell -
Tony bent down and said softly, “You can keep your eyes closed. You don’t have to do any of the crap he says anymore or any of them. You don’t have to do this.”
“Not romantic, you fool,” Sam mutters and hits the button. “Nat, thank God, get to Steve’s suite. He’s done something. There’s blood everywhere. We need a med team right away.”
Steve breaks some of the small sticks for kindling and piles them in the hearth. “Well I’m glad you liked them.” He clears his throat as he lays the logs. “I think I have to talk to you Tony.”
“What’s going on?”
Tony reaches out and smoothes a hand over the white feathers, letting his fingers drag along their shafts. It sends electric sparks up Steve’s spine and he feels the bond between them grow, twist, and mature.
“o4, you either come out or I come in to get you.”
Tony checks him out, and then tells him he can stand again. “That means I will have to install a permanent collar around your neck. You do realize that, right?”
“I think you need to come here and make love to me,” Steve said and opened his arms. He lifted his chin to indicate the water. “I dry swallowed them. Come on, I need you.”
In a whisper, he says, “It’s a beautiful shuttle.”
“Yes, Stark. What is it?” Richards appears through the holographic projectors in the room. He looks annoyed but not overly so.
Steve looked at Tony. “I just can’t believe it. That this is what we are. That I’m -.” He stopped and then swallowed. “That I’m finally home.”
“In the other room. I don’t care to wear high heels longer than I have to. Where did you say your glasses were?” She clatters around on the nightstand and then she slips into the bathroom. He hears her huff. “Here they are.” Her voice has a different pitch in the marble tiled room, and he smiles.
“What are you thinking,” Natasha says. Her eyes narrow in concern.
Tony squeezes his hand. “You are if I have something to do with it.”
The Red Knight screams and cries out in horror. “No! No! Steve! Why, you fucking idiot?” The Red Knight holds him in his arms as the blood pours out of the gash. “You fucking idiot. Natasha is going to kill me.”
Steve focused on Tony. “Yes. Believe it or not, I’ve thought about it more than once. The shield – it’s a duty but it doesn’t define me.”
“You’re only seven,” Steve replies and begins to tickle the boy, who adds more peals of laughter.
“I look forward to it, little one.” The caresses Steve’s lower lip again and then moves off.
“Fuck! I’m his omega! How the hell did you know, and I didn’t?” Tony cries out. The tears prickle at his eyes again.
Before dressing, Steve lifts each arm and digs a little at his armpit skin to reveal the medical patch. Each underarm has one. It’s the least intrusive place since most of his clients aren’t into any type of armpit play. He grimaces and then shrugs. Kinks are kinks as long as they don’t hurt anyone. Peeling the old patches away, he cleans the area, puts a slight dab of medical cleansing formula on each and then replaces the patches with fresh ones. He’s thankful for Natasha – she’s the one that funds the patches. Before he had to down medicines that got him physically ill sometimes and he wondered if the cure was worse than the sickness. Steve finishes and then fishes out his clothes again.
They fill their plates and then Tony asks, “There must have been something pleasantly memorable at the settlement. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t see how you could come out of such a place and still care about humanity otherwise.”
“More boredom,” Bucky says. “Come on, you know that you want to.”
Stark nods to Banner and the doctor squeezes his shoulder once and then releases him. “You know, Sheriff, I think I will stay. Not because you so sweetly invited me, but because I don’t back down from a challenge.” Stark spins on his heel, surveying all, the tiny jail with its rusted bars on the windows and single lantern in the wall sconce. “Yep, I think I’ll be staying here and change things up a bit. I think this town’s rip for the pickin’s.”
Steve shrinks back, the fight dissipates out of him. He’s fought it for too long and he doesn’t think, right now, he can. “Doctor, I don’t think we should talk about this anymore.”
“Don’t move.” He scrambles and races over to scoop up his gauntlet. It’s on in an instant. “Don’t come any closer.”
He shivers and worries that it might be shock, probably is shock. He’s going to die because he decided to save a wild animal that reminded him of a stuffed toy. How fucked is he? Something in his side crunches – rib probably. His legs feel okay, but his head – not so much. He stays there with his face in the dirt and the sun beating on the back of his head. Blood drips down his temples into his eyes. He closes them. Luck would have at least killed him on the descent. Now, he’s going to suffer and die of heat and injuries.
Steve nods and then gratefully touches the ring. “So it’s official now?” His expression is so hopeful it takes Tony’s breath away.
“Steve Rogers?”
Steve eyed Thor sitting in the living room with both of Clint’s children on his lap. “No ill will for Thor?”
Fighting enemies is one thing, fighting friends – impossible. The image of Clint going down, his head rolling free of his body replays in Steve’s head. He shoves the pain away, accepts the guilt, and yells to Tony, “Let me go.”
“The Avengers can eat my shit. Do you think we’re going to be a team and avenging all the time? Do you think this is a cartoon land where evil reptiles and robots will attack New York City all the time? No,” Tony said and tried to quell his rising anger. “No, this is just life. It’s done. I’m done. Let’s go back to Malibu.”
“It means that Captain Rogers considers the marriage important to him. That you are important to him.”
“No. Only assistants to the Prince may change his schedule.”
The guy stops and twists his mouth as if he’s considering a smart remark to answer. The pause must help him reassess the situation, and he walks the few steps to the chairs in front of Tony’s desk. He sits down. “I have my resume, sir.” He lifts the beaten portfolio for Tony to see.
“How will we be able to get from one layer to the next?” Steve had asked. It had only been a few days since he’d confessed his sin to Tony. They were barely on speaking terms.
“What?”
Bruce frowns but lets it pass. “Steve, before you go-.” He stops and his expression tightens. “Just be careful. We’re not used to playing with the big dogs. Not the likes of us. Just be careful. I-I got involved with a General’s daughter once and the results weren’t good. At all. I’m still paying for it.”
“What was what about?”
“Not like it’s much better across the pond.”
On the bed, Steve has a small duffle bag open (where the hell did he get it?). He has a number of articles spread out as if he’s been sorting the clothes and books.
“We’ll manage, Steve. Don’t worry about it. Just-.” She stops and he knows she wants him to stay in his lane.
Until he has no other choice but to break that promise and snap his fingers.
“You can’t hurt me, you won’t hurt me. What are you waiting for?” Tony asks.
Steve looks up at him. “Have you ever tried cock warming?”
The man isn’t looking at Steve, isn’t paying attention to him at all. He’s staring down at the book. “Quantum Entanglement: The Case for Human Entanglement?”
Coulson nods and says, "You do realize that is your real name."
“Miss out?” Tony asks and the world around them falls away.
“Pizza?”
“Can’t you just shift us all through to where ever you came from?” Tony asked as he slipped his arms under Steve. His muscles still ached from the recent transformation, but he found strength in being close to his mate.
“He fucking tried to rape you?” Rage mars Tony’s beautiful features. “That fucking piece of shit. I’m going to fucking get him thrown out an airlock.”
Something riles in Tony, something painful and deep. He wants this omega. He wants Steven to like him. They could be friends. It doesn’t have to be so distant and cold. The man challenges him and Tony never in his wildest dreams imagined that he would want an omega like this, never imagined an omega would be this complex. He wants to know him. Even if they cannot be lovers. He wants the man to respond to him on some level other than just biological. He feels a little sick about it as if he’s asking for something that’s wrong. “No, no it isn’t all. I will wash you. I will fucking wash you. Do you understand?”
Steve frowns and says, “It will be my honor to serve the prince.”
Steve hesitates as the microwave dings. “Do you want me to come with you?”
“It’s not him,” Natasha whispered and grasped Tony’s shoulder. “It’s Steve, isn’t it?”
“Home,” Steve says and nods all the while trying to keep his gown from opening.
Steve glances back and Vision holds up the bag. “Packed.”
“No. You shouldn’t be.” Bruce still has his one arm in a sling. “His blood healed you.” He indicates the slumbering super soldier.
Finally he gets one of the wires twisted onto the node and then start to work the other one as well as the wind blasts him in the face. He glances at Tony, sees the droplets of water in his hair turning to ice. “Damn it.”
“You need to set my shoulder,” Steve says. “But first, secure your horse, and then we’ll do this.”
Sam furrowed his brows and said, “Isn’t he the one who rammed that nuke up the Chitauri’s ass?”
Tony doesn’t know why but the whole exchange pisses him off. He leaves the kitchen with coffee mug in hand and forgets entirely about the artwork hanging on the wall in the kitchen.
“It’s okay. I’m sorry I have to push you so much to remember. It’s just that we don’t have a lot of time anymore. We need you to help us. You and me – you see – you and me are the only ones who’ve been touched by all of the stones. Most of the others only ever really interacted with one, possibly two.”
But it does.
“Display all active corporations, their holdings, representatives, and their governors,” Steve says and the console lights up in soft hues of blue. Every time he uses it, his thoughts drift back to Tony. He recalls lying with Tony in the guest quarters on his ship the Howling Commando and watching the stars projected above their heads. It had been sappily romantic and he still loves to daydream about those days.
“In the dream?” Tony said. Half of him asked as a man fully aware that the state he was in was just a fantasy. The other half was a man that wished he could speak so clearly and frankly to Steve.
Unbuckling the holster for his gun, he dumps it on the bureau, leaving his hat on the stand and his duster flung over the chair. He pulls off his boots and sets them at the foot of the bed. When he drops onto the cot to sit, he deflates as if he’s been holding out, not breathing for days. He strips off his shirt and folds it to set it aside. Lying back down on the cot he tries to chase sleep, but it’s a harsh and horrible foe these days. After Andersonville – everything became a test of wills. His life is segmented, split, before and after Andersonville.
“I am a doctor, but I am also a sane person, Mister Stark. I will not interfere in the affairs of the immortals, the Legions. That is not for me to change, if there’s a Collapsing Event, that means they will come for him. He’s not safe and neither is anyone around him. I have a family, Mister Stark,” she says and walks around him even as he tries to prevent her from leaving.
“I don’t think so.”
“Doctor Strange wants to make sure that Mister Stark is stable and can endure the flight,” the medic says.
“No. We’ll call. Don’t worry.” Hawkeye pointed to Sam. “Take care of them.”
“And you solved it?” Clint tsked. “I cannot believe it.”
“No, you can’t. But you could be sensible some time, Rogers,” Natasha snapped. “Come.”
“If he’s violent-.”
Scowling, Pep waves for Steven to follow her and they go to the ladder, descending it quickly. Tony joins Jamison near the command center and mutters, “What do you think of him?”
The red and gold of the fire flared and sparked. He wanted to question it, but the shadows lurked in the recesses where the fire couldn’t stand, where life and death mixed to form something immutable. The fire shielded him from these places, these areas of power and potency, where life turned to death and then again to something superior, supreme and absolute. The fire protected him from treading upon that darkness. It kept him in the light, bathed him in warmth and never burned or scorched his flesh. He didn’t fight it, nor did he care to. The fire offered him something better than the night. It offered him life. He sank into it, letting the licks of flame consume him.
“It’s probably only because it is -.” And he can’t think of a single reason.
Natasha nods. “I get it. Steve, be careful. In more ways than one, okay?”
Or having a romantic dinner, Tony thinks. “Hmm?”
“Captain, it’s nice of you to come by. I thought we’d requested you as my bodyguard and that meant you had to stick around. I didn’t think things would be so lax around here.” He runs the towel through his hair and smiles, devilish and inviting to Steve. It reminds him of their time, of his Courtesan lure dragging Steve in to his nest.
Steve had shifted, fallen to his knees in front of Tony. He groaned, and it sent shivered through Tony, like electrical kisses to his nerve endings. It grew in intensity and he attempted to halt it, to stop the greedy need. Tony surrendered to the bond, to the pulsating of hunger within it, and he gripped their cocks, as smears of pre-come dripped down his hand. His body and soul combined into one famished insistent energy and he lost control of it. Together they worked. Tony noted the pulse of life between them, the soul bond seemed to glow and shine around them. Tony followed it, enhancing the thrill of the moment but also tightening and strengthening the bond between them. Tony gasped at the reality of the bond, as it wove around and through them. The markings along Steve’s chest and Tony’s reflected one another, images that mirrored one another and these markings burned brightly. They become less the physical beings and more the ethereal as Tony threaded the bonds together. Steve stretched out with his free hand and brought Tony to him, holding him to his shoulder as they pumped their cock together. He wept as Tony wrapped one hand around him, felt the heat of the moment as well as their souls’ etching on their chests burst with warmth and connection. It only expanded as Steve came in a great flood over their hands. He yelled out and Tony swore to heaven and back again that he felt the shock wave, that his own soul vibrated with the ecstasy and the joy, and the yearning all at once. The room around him with its bright blue stars and darker shadows of reality whited out and Tony threw his head back as he yelled out his completion. He shuddered and then Steve collapsed into him.
“Yes.”
“It’s a lifelong thing, right?” Sam asked.
“Come, open your mouth, my sweet omega,” the man says and his voice deepens. Steve follows the direction as the alpha slips a hand into his loose trousers to pull out his thick and long erection. Steve nearly doesn’t hold the pose. His arms quake, but he keeps up as the man slides his dick onto Steve’s tongue. “Should I knot your mouth? I think I will.” He pushes into Steve’s mouth. He’s long and wide and Steve’s lips stretch over him, the hood of his cock thick against Steve’s tongue.
With one hand on Tony’s shoulder, Steve obeys and meets Tony’s gaze. It is unflinching, open and without fear. There’s no self-consciousness. He’s intent on what Steve is doing, he’s hot and salivating as Steve jerks into his fist.
“Buck,” Steve said again, and he found himself crossing the few steps that separated them and he encompassed Bucky in his arms. “I missed you so damned much.”
“And this is my work around. I am not giving this up, Strange. So, can it.”
Tony snickers and smiles up at Steve, who isn’t having any of his charm today. “You should be thankful for Clint. He’s a godsent.”
“No,” Tony replied as he drew a finger up Steve’s bicep. “I don’t even want it.”
“Good, that sounds perfect. I want you to use me all night long.” He kisses Steve. “I want you to use me, my Captain.”
“Don’t worry. Just hang on. I will get out of this and I will save you.”
“But they’re vivid?” Tony said as Steve worked on the coffee. It had been decades since he sat at a campfire and made coffee from ground beans.
“It might be the universe, but it has to be dependent on you. It’s not random, not how I understand it.”
“Well not to the whole of the US, that’s for sure.” Steve doesn’t open the dishwasher but fills the sink with detergent and water and washes the dishes by hand.
“Caught me,” Tony says and rips the paper covering off the ridiculously phallic shaped popsicle.
All of it shattered him until he glued himself back together again using denial, arrogance, and stoicism. He marched to the beat of a long distant drum, one of war and pride. Ultron wasn’t wrong when he accused Steve of being ‘God's righteous man. Pretending you could live without a war.’ Ultron shocked him out of his stupor and Steve faced reality
“JARVIS, order more cherries. Have them delivered,” Tony directs and then they are both in bed, snuggled under the covers.
Steve reached out, slowly, hesitantly. He clasped his hand around Tony’s.
Tony places the glass on the counter and then turns back to Steven, as he leans back against the stone counter of the bar. “What? You’ll feign that you’re comfortable around me. That you don’t despise me. That you aren’t sickened by our biology that forces us to be together.”
“You wanna tell me what that was all about?”
On the other hand, Steve seems oblivious to the anxiety threatening to eat its way through Tony’s head and spit out his brains. He offers Tony his arm and they leave the lobby, like any happy couple.
“Yeah?” Tony said and couldn’t stop the smile on his face. Being in his forties he shouldn’t feel like a teenager anymore, but damned if his heart didn’t ram a thrilling beat in his chest. “A lot more?” Tony had to quell his reactions a little. He sensed the timid, almost frightened after image of Steve’s astral energies. He couldn’t jump in like he was partying in Monaco. Right here, right now, before him Steve invited and the risk of scaring him away loomed.
“Doesn’t work.” Tony considers the idea formulating between them. “If the UN would buy into it, we could deploy Avengers throughout the world.”
“It’s very disconcerting.”
He gets a room for Sam at the Parlor Inn, and no one complains. This is why he loves this little town on the brink of nowhere USA. When he leaves Sam to take his rest, his old friend brings him away from the commotion of the rowdy crowd.
Rogers shifted toward Rumlow as if he knew he had to, as if some invisible chain linked him to the guard. “No,” Tony said, and Rogers startled. He hunched his shoulders like he expected to be hit. “Captain Rogers, you don’t have to-.”
“We have powers beyond what vampires have…what would you think people like Ross and Pierce would do if they knew?” Natasha waited as the reality slotted into place for him.
It doesn’t matter. Tony runs to the front door, opens it, and is outside on the lawn, staring up into the sky. “I haven’t seen the sky in so long, not the night sky,” he’s saying by the time Steve catches up to him. “All the years, I never used the glasses to see the pure night sky away from the city. I never had the opportunity. Wearing the glasses for the limited time I could, I always ended up having to take them off by the time it was night. This is marvelous.” He reaches out and grasps Steve’s hand. “Let’s get further away from the house. I want to see the sky without the interference with the house’s lights.”
“What?”
CHAPTER 7 COUNCIL OF WORLDS
“You should try the electrolyte drink or the energy drink.”
Their relationship blossomed, but that frail bloom would easily wilt if they didn’t feed it. If every bond existed as an equation, then Tony could solve them all. The equations predicted the outcomes of the bonds, he only needed to study them and comprehend their inner meanings. In the end it wasn’t just about solutions but the theory behind the equations.
“Hey!” Tony protested.
The omega only eyes him with keen eyes that are a startling blue under long lashes. Without the thready beard and chopped hair, he looks better. Even his wounds seem more faded and less pronounced across his face and torso.
“A schism only declares your intent to diverge from the Conclave’s current path. We could be supplying the -.”
Next week's chapter may be a little late. My beta reader is going out of town for the holiday and I have a few things on my plate that might complicate matters.
Turning on his side to lock eyes with Steve, Tony touches his face as well. His thumb drags along Steve’s lower lip. Pain and hope mix in Tony’s features so often it scars him with a haunted look. Steve reaches up and gently pushes back the curls of his hair that fall into his face. As he moves to kiss Tony, a low ping resonates in the room.
There’s a cushioned bench behind him, so he settles down and lets Steven do the work. He leans back, his hands gripping the back of the bench, his legs wide. “Work it.” It is a command and it is followed. Having an omega at his beck and call sets him on fire. It’s so much better than buying the time of a drone from a mating block. Once every urgency cycle is nothing compared to this – to have all the time. He throws his head back as Steve licks and sucks, paying particular attention to the head of his cock and then further along where it swells to knot. He’s coaxing the knot, bringing it on. Tony mutters incoherent sounds and shoves his cock into Steven’s mouth.
“What do you mean?”
Tony mumbles something and then opens his eyes. Steve’s heart beats in a rush like the waves crashing against the shore. There’s din there, he can hardly hear. He lifts Tony’s hand to his lips and kisses his fingers. “Tony?”
Shrugging, Steve says, “The people. There was my Ma. She was a nurse. The whole reason she ended up on Brooklyn was because she followed my Da out there. He signed up as a colony guardsman. But it’s a colony in the Beyond Regions so they used the firepits as the main defense against incursions.”
As he washed his eyes caught sight of the markings on his arm. His wrist had the original tattooed bracelet of his leadership of the soul pack. Up his arm he had Bruce’s circle and then along the side of it, almost touching Bruce’s was Natasha’s. The green and slight red of it reminded him of Christmas. It mocked him that way. Along the back of his arm nearer the wrist band was Peggy’s tattoo. He was glad it appeared there. He wanted some connection to her. He was glad she’d gotten on with her life, married, had children, was independent, and ended up founding SHIELD with Howard of all people. Her life had been good, and now he had her as a guide. He touched it. A slight sigh released from him.
“Fuck, I’m not overstating it. They stopped us at Rho Ophiuchi – that’s closing in on the Inners. While we squabble away at our little nonsensical issues, we’re losing ground.” Obie pounds or kicks something because there’s a clatter and he curses.
“No.” Tony wills it to be true. “No, it happened but then you jumped back in time. It split realities. That’s how this works. You can’t change your past, not the memories.  Those events happened to you. But somehow or another when they trapped the Ornari in the singularity, you split? We’re not sure. You’re both in the singularity and not. It’s your past and not. I’m sorry I can’t make it any clearer than that.”
Happy nods for Steve to approach the prince and Steve quietly pads over to the piano. Tony acknowledges him with short bow of his head and then closes his eyes as he travels the chords of the music. It’s beautiful and ancient. His mother used to listen to the masters and Steve recognizes Chopin as Tony sways with the music. There’s no sheet music on the piano, no tablet, or projected notes. It’s all from Tony’s memory. It might be augmentation to implant the music in his head, but somehow Steve doubts that Tony would ever allow anyone to mess with his brain.
"Please."  Tony had only managed the sweet begging gasp before Steve dropped to his knees and pulled away the zipped pants and boxers to wrap those magnificent lips around his half hard cock. His knees nearly gave out, his mouth went dry, and he threw his head back as Steve braced him to suck him off. It was too much and not enough. He wanted to know about this god at his feet, kneeling and supplicating before him. But he had let the emotions of the moment take over him and he pounded like a fiend into that perfect mouth, not thinking he'd be able to get off but his orgasm surprised him, overtaking him in seconds and he flooded Steve’s mouth for the second time in as many hours.
“Scott has his doubts.”
“Come on, do the toe thing.”
“Gotta put food on the table somehow,” Clint replied with a shrug.
The toy doesn’t answer.
“I might,” Steve says. “Did you have time to shoe my horse?”
As Steve made his way back down the aisle and to their pew, Sam stood up and grasped his hand, bringing him to sit between Tony and Sam. Steve sat and his expression collapsed. Sam kept a hold on Steve’s hand and Tony clasped the other one. He’d never really tried to do anything major with the bond, but Tony closed his eyes and sank deep into thrumming that felt like it existed far away. Yet as he allowed it to consume him it grew in intensity and depth. He felt the different waves as if a variety of instruments played their own melodies around him. It shouldn’t be difficult. Music was the expression of mathematics in a way. Souls must be the same thing. He reached inside as if he stood in the middle of his laboratory with JARVIS’ holographic displays around him. He saw and listened to each song, and then identified them as he assessed the music. The deep sonorous sounds came from Bruce, and mirroring that the song of Natasha not unlike that of a cello. He touched them and they stopped, almost surprised but then welcomed his invitation and accepted it. He wove them together as he tilted toward the next sounds – those of Sam whose song reminded him of flight of Beethoven’s 3rd symphony. He used Sam as the anchor and then moved to find Clint’s that pulsed with a beat to keep the rhythm. Finally, he sought his own and what he found there surprised him. Not the beat, not the melody, but something that began to tie them together. And when he connected with Steve’s core, the harmony of their energies synchronized and, sitting next to him, Steve gasped a low intake of air.
*oOo*
“What?” Steve jumps off the bed and crosses the room in one breath. Unlocking the door, he peers out. “Clint didn’t make it?”
Hill clears her throat.
“Isn’t that just you?” Steve says as they continue to move up the side of the incline. He hears the slow groan of the Hulk behind them. They don’t have a lot of time.
“Hey, yeah, I remember you. Tell me Tony’s hasn’t done something half-assed and gotten himself in trouble or worse is in the hospital?” Rhodes asks.
“I don’t – my Farsi isn’t great, okay? He wants you to build the -.”
Bucky manages to growl in a half muffled mutter and shakes his head.
“Stop, stop, stop,” Tony said and scrubbed at his hair with his nails. Nothing. All morning and he still got nothing from the web. But that was probably because soul packs were so rare, and that most soul packs were not scientifically, rigorously studied. He needed to talk to Bruce about investigating this whole fucked up thing.
“This can’t keep happening. It’s going to damage their hearts,” Cho says. Her features tell she’s deeply troubled by the report outs from the monitors scattered about the room. “It looks like their running on pure adrenaline.”
“Tony?” Bruce called. “Did you figure something out? What’s going on?”
“So, there was kissing?” Bruce raised an eyebrow.
“Yes, well, not all of them turned out well,” Hill said and hit the screen again. “When SHIELD walked in and promised the country aid if they could set up a base, the corrupt government went for it.”
“What going on in there?” Tony calls.
There’s nothing more terrifying than the moments before it all happens. The anticipation of love, the excitement of sex, the arousal all play into it, but the terror of that first time plays strongly in his head, in the darkness around him.
“Hmm?” He’s not really listening.
His smile is strong and alluring when he turns to Tony. "Nice you could make it, darling. You look beat. How about a nice massage?" He sidles right up to Tony, his breath hot against Tony’s neck. “Let’s go inside. See what I can do for you, take away all the stress.”
Raza turns to his crew and directs one of his soldiers to the wounded man on the floor. The soldier aims and shoots again, blasting the man’s head. He then drags what’s left of him out of the cave. After, Raza turns to Steve and they start again, this time it sounds like they are bartering, going back and forth on a final price.
“A beer would be nice.”
“Captain Rogers entered the Tower less than five minutes ago. As I said, he has requested permission to see Doctor Banner. I was about to rely his request.”
Steve awakes to reality and sees Tony hunched over him, a series of probes and wiring hang from his head and chest. They snake around him and disappear under Steve’s neck and head. He blinks a few times, trying to discern if this is reality, if the world will smear around him like it did in the virtual one. It doesn’t. The image stays steady and Tony smiles at him.
He pretended to be Captain America as a child, even went as his idol for several Halloweens. The pride he took in making his own shield for trick or treating energized him the entire night as his mother doting on him.  Yet, as far as his father was concerned,  it was all for naught. His father would grumble and scowl at him; nothing Tony ever did seemed to please the man. So Tony tore down all the posters, got rid of the Captain America sheets, burned his comic books, and laughed at his father when the idiot went looking for Rogers again – decades after the man had put a plane in the cold ocean waters.
When the darkness of loneliness hits he denies it, because that's what Tony does the best, he finds ways to hide, to burrow down into his brain until there's no way out but up. Only then he will find relief, only then he will be free from the shadows of loneliness. He leaves alcohol behind this time, because it dims the brain, and he needs his brain. He needs to set it ablaze, a conflagration of flames, of ideas, of knowing more.
Steve blinks a few times and then inhales. That’s a mistake. The smell of bleach burns his nostrils and his bronchi constrict. He tries to exhale but his throat locks up, spasming. Immediately, he recognizes the claws ripping at his bronchi and lungs as chemical induced asthma attack. His gloved fingers come up to the helmet and fumble with the latches. He wheezes.
Clearing his throat, Tony said, “Anyway. This is the lay-out of the surrounding areas.”
“What’s a load of shit?” Tony hears Steve footsteps across the laboratory floor. He stops in front of Tony. “Do you want me to take off the VR stuff and put on your glasses?”
“No, I do not,” Tony says.
“Depends on what you call paradise, doesn’t it?” Tony answered and generally gave off an air of disgust and annoyance.
CHAPTER 4
Tony recognizes that even when Obie acts like a dick, he still has Tony's best interests at heart more so than his father ever did. He owes a lot to Obie and he needs to heed his warnings. The Board of Directors want this new weapons system to fly like a bird and sing the Generals and Admirals on the Joint Chiefs of Staff to sleep. It isn't even a difficult problem to solve and Tony can't put his finger on why it all bothers him.
“Well, that’s a pleasant thought,” Steve replies. They trudge forward.
“Where?” she says.
Tony grabbed him, halting his motion to open the door. “What the hell, Steve? You’re practically falling down on your feet. They can shoot me and nothing’s going to happen.”
Placing his hand on Steve’s shoulder, he pushes him away. “You stink.”
Tony stepped closer and the red around them swirled. “No. I won’t let you do this. You’re – we’re together now.” He reached out into the red darkness. It froze his hands – he would have guessed it was warm, but it wasn’t. Not at all. “You said you wouldn’t let me sacrifice, but what you’re doing now – what you’re attempting to force. It’s worse, so much worse. Steve, I’m you’re Beloved, but you’re mine as well.” Now he found tears obscuring his view of Steve. Everything smeared with crimson. “You’re taking away the most important person, the most significant thing that’s ever happened to me. How can you do this? How heartless can you be?” Tony knew the words speared through Steve’s heart. If he hadn’t seen it on his face, he surely shared the emotion with him as it rippled out, painful and searing.
Tony placed a finger on Steve’s lips. “All you have to do is be truthful to yourself.”
Tony shakes his head. “Insecurities. Let’s just call it that.”
He shook his head and nuzzled at Tony’s neck. “It’s just a dream.” He kissed and licked and Tony’s knees went weak. The thrumming in his head vibrated with yearning, with longing – that final reach to grab and get something long sought. He couldn’t parse how it was Steve. They always fought with one another, always butted heads, but their souls aligned. That was the difference. Their souls comprehended when their minds did not.
“I have the whole alcohol thing under control. This isn’t that.” God, he’s so wrong and so horrible. He needs another drink now. He’s shaking and splitting apart all at once. “Fuck, I fucked up. I really fucked up.”
Luke snickers. “Seems to me that there’s a little jousting going on here. Now, who is going to win?” Luke crosses his arms and watches the two of them.
“If you mean we gotta do something, I agree. What are we supposed to do with him in bed in this place, though?” Bucky said and then as he gestured to the 1930s hospital ward the world around them transitioned to another room that Tony didn’t recognize.
Ignoring the tears prickling his eyes, Steve brushed Tony’s hair back from his face, kissed his temple and then his mouth. “You’re okay. You’re okay.”
“You are a dangerous man,” Tony said and reached over the side table. He hit a switch as he spoke. “JARVIS, please send up a double order of steak rare, spinach salad, and two bottles of juice. Also a bottle of water and power drink.”
When he wakes in the morning, Tony stiff and exhaustion hangs over him. Blu looks the same as he feels. He thumbs it over his shoulder. “Let’s get some water and clean up a bit. I have to find a way to get all this stuff over to the meeting up place.” The pieces and parts of the armor are strew all over their wild home. “Come on.”
“JARVIS, JARVIS!” Tony grabs for Steve at the same time, he tries to free himself from the seatbelt. It’s impossible, and he beats back the air bag to get at Steve. Something’s in his eyes and he shakes as he pounds on the last of the cushion from the airbag. “Damn it, get the ambulance.”
“No, just these dreams I keep having about-.” He swallowed down his pride, his fear, his anxiety, his revulsion, and yes, his excitement. “About Tony. The dreams – the real ones all involve Tony.”
She smiled, a weak and painful cut of her lips. “I think I understand a little about uncontrolled power.” She lifted her hands and brought them to Bruce’s temples. “Relax.”
With one hand at his throat, Tony uses the other to scrape nails against Steve’s nipples. In response, Steve hisses and moans. He grabs at Tony’s arm, the one against his throat and he presses down. He wants the weight of it, the heaviness against him. He’s always been needy when it comes to wanting someone larger, heavier, and more powerful to take him. Tony reads him, understands and drags him closer, his feet hitting the keys of the piano. The prince lays over him, notes ringing out. Tony inhales his scent and then drifts lower, tongue and teeth teasing along the way. Steve fumbles for the condom in his robe pocket and stops Tony before he goes any further, trying to push the condom into his hand.
A rough breath leaves him. He needs to ground himself. The idea of losing Steve shouldn’t fuck him up so much. The first stage of a relationship is infatuation after all. Tony walks back to Steve’s room, enter,s and spots a nurse checking the read out on the computer. She goes to touch Steve and Tony snaps, “What are you doing?”
“Island-.”
Cupping Tony’s cheek, Steve leans in and kisses him. “There’s nothing to be sorry about.” He offers another kiss. “Is there anything I can do to help you get ready?”
“I wasn’t here anymore. They pulled me out,” Tony says and tugs Steve’s backpack away from him. He digs out the thermoses.
“No.” Steven stays like a wall, not moving, not crumbling.
“What’s wrong about wanting to be with someone?” Tony asked. “We’re two adults. What’s wrong with it?”
“And he took it out on you,” Tony says.
“I didn’t check in with Happy, or Pepper, or even Rhodey!” Tony yanked Steve to look at him. “I got lucky. They got out. But did Natasha get lucky with Clint? No! Clint had been made ages ago and forced to work for them because of his family. Thank whomever you believe in that they’re safe now.” He rubbed Steve’s shoulder. “No! You don’t get to take this burden on your shoulders as well. None of us do. They did this to our friends. Those bastards. Not us. Them!”
“Well, you’d win that bet. Even with only one arm, Bucky’s quite the shot. He can balance a rifle on that stump as good as any man with two arms. He’s just about as good as Clint with his accuracy though he can’t pick out the range like Clint can.”
the other time, the other reality. Tony wonders if that means the other him, the other Tony is waking up, becoming aware, recovering from whatever they did to him. But then again, he doesn’t have to think
Heavy dark woods adorn the foyer, carved and embellished. A massive curving staircase dominates the back wall of the circular foyer. Strange points to the staircase and it surprises Steve, but there are a few other stragglers headed to the upper floors. They find their way to the third floor where the ballroom is.
“In the kitchen. I am currently instructing him on how to use the microwave.”
“Tony? Tony?” When Tony opens his eyes they are wide and terrified, his look haunted. At least he’s still alive. “Okay, Tony, let’s get out of here.”
“Gah!” Tony cries out and tries to roll over. Steve grabs his arm and helps him. He vomits into the snow. It’s not blood, just bile. Tony pants and groans as he heaves again. Steve keeps a hand on his neck to steady him.
“Weren’t we on a train?”
Steve smiles, and Tony swears he sees the hint of a blush on his cheeks. “Yes, Tony. Thank you. You’re always a fixer that’s for sure.” He bobs his head in a kind of thank you and then puts his little easel on the table. “This should be great.” He situates the table at an angle to the windows. “So, I can see better.”
Steve jerks a bit then realizes the man read his nametag. “Yep, that’s me.”
They would keep him alive, Steve concluded. Alive and in the dark room hanging from unbreakable chains. They’d keep him injured and in pain. Muted and violated. Ross continued to talk, babbling on about his plans, how this was God’s work. The words smeared together and fell into the blood stains on the floor. The smell of the room wafted around him, the blood, the semen. Piss. He must have urinated at some point. He couldn’t remember. The heat of embarrassment burned on his face. He shuddered against his bonds. Finding a way out, searching for a way to save Tony. He couldn’t even bargain, not with the gag on.
And then he hears it, above all else, the steady beat of Tony’s breathing besides him. Steve finds himself putting the mug down and reaching over, touching Tony’s empty hand, holding it in a loose grasp as if he might lead him, but not. Tony allows it, permits it and deep down Steve thrills at the contact.  He swallows down the collapsing fear in his throat, the kind of terror that closes up his windpipe and neutralizes his ability to move forward with any request, any words.
Pepper flips the pages to the contract and points out pertinent sections, especially the salary. Steve gasps a few times along the way and Tony only smiles. He’s generous, very generous. Steve signs both the hard copy and the digital documents. When he glances up at Tony, his face is flush, and Tony reads his biometrics to see that his heart is pounding a mile a minute.
Glancing over his shoulder, Steve frowns but before he can ask any questions Happy closes the doors. Steve hears a muffled voice and knows it’s coming from the double doors across from the entry. In the center of the round vestibule is a console table with a map of the Stark Systems glittering above it. He’d heard tales of the Stark Systems – how advanced the systems are, how all the planets are energy efficient, well conserved as far as ecology is concerned, how people pursue their dreams and don’t suffer in poverty. He’s sure some of the tales are overblown, but they can’t all be just myths. Sighing, Steve tells himself – this isn’t a fairy tale. His prince is not through those doors, he’s not going to win over anyone. He needs to realize who he is and what his place is. With a pragmatic view of the situation, he decides to do the best job he can and get the best tip possible. Think of it as an opportunity.
He disregards Steven as he passes him and marches out of the main floor vestibule to the entrance of his mansion. . He could use the tunnel to the Main Conference Building, but he decides a swift walk across the gardens might do him good. He might not punch his omega in the face. He’s boiling inside. When he hears the pad of Steven’s boots behind him, he stops and confronts him again.
“Get me some food and lots of it. Also a stunner, just in case.” Tony taps the frame of his glasses and slips them off. “Food is coming. Plus I’m going to shock you if you even attempt to assault me. I’m going to put it on the highest setting. It could kill you.”
Steve adjusts his shoulders, standing straighter. He enters the vestibule that looks like something out of a palace instead of a spaceship.  Happy doesn’t follow, just folds his hands in front of him and says, “Go on through to the main room. He’ll be waiting and don’t mind the mess.”
Waiting, he watched as emergency crews started the chore of clean up. Some injured were removed and hustled away in ambulances. God, what was he doing out here. Why wasn’t he back with Steve – with his pack? Even out here, the ring of the pack resonated in his head.
Steve turns away. It’s time to get back to the maze. This was a distraction – a trap set by Ultron to stall him. He starts away.
Tony nods and follows Steve’s lead. It thrills him a little to see the prince, who is so strong, so powerful be so willing and submissive to Steve’s hand. As Tony lies down and bends his knees with his feet planted firmly on the mattress, Steve kneels over to him and rubs his legs to ease his nerves.
“Tell me, what’s the verdict?”
“And it’s the terrorists that killed your fiancé fault. But we can say that until we’re blue in the face and it’s not going to convince either one of us, is it?”
Tony turned over and lazily licked the wound he’d given Steve. His salivary glands filled his mouth and he spread the anticoagulant into the puncture wounds. The warmth of Steve’s body heat never ceased to amaze Tony. He couldn’t remember ever being so warm and comfortable in his own skin when he was alive. He brushed a hand over Steve’s chest and down to his flank. His uniform pants where down at his knees. Tony had only pulled away his own pants and boxers.
“Do you want a soul bond with me?” Tony asked and his eyes were light and expectant, again.
“According to Doctor Stephen Strange, the existence of soul packs started sometime after his encounter with Dormammu, an ancient god like universal being. He used an infinity stone that caused temporal manipulations to create branches in time, causing time to loop. But the final bargain ended up with changes to the continuum in which the whole of the universe exists. This is published on the dark web, sir. It is not openly available, though some conspiracy sites do reference it.”
Over the hysteria roaring in his ears, Tony heard Rumlow directing his agents, “Get his ankles anchored to the roof.” He kicked at something on the ground. “The damned shackles are right there. Get him locked in.”
“I say so.”
“Tired.” Steve breathes out a sigh of relief. He’s talking. Thank God.
“Well, we’re not your average soul pack,” Tony said. That had to be his lamest comeback ever. “Listen, I need help to work this out. I came here to get some words to help Steve. He’s shut down and feeling more and more alienated every day.”
She walks a feet meters away from him and then turns around. “You have to understand, Ultron was essentially downloaded into Tony’s brain. The information –well, from what I can glean – some of the information stayed with Tony, especially parts of it that he could link to, understand, have some context for.”
Steve smiles. “I did put a few things on my application about politics and the Inner Regions. So maybe-.”
“Hmm,” Tony says and decides to drop it. He doesn’t need Steven to think he’s going soft. It’s safer to go with what he knows, then to chance the possibilities. Lord, even Penny thinks he might be going soft with the bonding. “Today we meet the competition for the chair. This is not a formality. This is a true negotiation. We need to win over as many as possible to my coalition.”
Steve gathers up his supplies and climbs the stairs. He must like the view from his balcony. Tony sits at the island, staring at the cold fries. No one likes cold fries and it’s really not possible to warm them up and get the same satisfaction. He peers over his shoulder at the stairs and then back at the fries. Sighing, he collects the dishes, scraping the plates and tossing the trash. He puts the dishes in the sink and debates on putting them in the dishwasher. Steve doesn’t use the dishwasher so it means they will stay there not cleaned. He should just wash them.
Steve lies back down on the bed and pulls Tony toward him. “It means they’re still out there.”
Tony waved him off. “Don’t think about it. You’ll hurt yourself.” He closed the distance between them and held onto Steve – the energy between them was like a live wire. “Let’s get this over with so we can come back here.”
Tony throws the bone he’s gnawed on into the fire. “JARVIS makes sure my private jet is ready as well.”
“You know, I think I liked you with enough debt to choke a whole planet,” Fury says. “And your team went to the Rims to try and settle that dispute all by your lonesome without any push from me-.”
“No, what’s your name? Your real name?”
“Hold on, Captain.” Pierce paced in front of him. “Keep that in and we might even let Agent Barton leave the building. Unharmed.”
“Our lion?” Tony says and his mouth is dry. “Maybe, I don’t know. He was my companion. I looked on him like a guardian.”
Son of a bitch. Tony knows Steve’s going to figure it out; he’s a master strategist after all. It’s in his nature. Everything special about him came out of a bottle is a lot of bullshit. This is purely skinny Rogers taking on the billionaire playboy with every fiber of his being thrown behind the task.
“Go home. Get to know him better.” She knocks him with her elbow.
“Yeah, you could say that.”
“Feel what?”
“I know that omegas bond before the alpha bites,” Tony whispers into the omega’s ear. “I know that this act of knotting you, this is what does it. Plus my scent. My scent, the pheromones react with your gland.” Tony closes his eyes and lets the coil growing in his groin to overtake his rational mind. “You’re mine now. You know it.”
“I think,” Steve said. He picked up his bag and nodded.. Tony looked him up and down.
“Can I say I don’t care if it works or not. I just want you to be okay? I want you back. I miss you already.”
“Nat spent some time talking to someone in New York named Wong,” Sam said. His arms were crossed over his chest. “He told us.”
“Just making sure.” He smiled. “Got in a fresh shipment of blood too.” He raised his hands to Tony’s concerns. “No issues. We did the back-door deal and it’s not traceable.”
Tony grumbles and then says, “Stop it, Pepper. She’s winking at you, isn’t she?”
“Some sense?” he echoes and feels stupid as if he’s scrambling for purchase.
When Fury finally gave a curt nod, Strange offered a bow with a flourish and then excused himself, leaving Wong without a farewell.
"Helicarrier?" Things are so different now.
Shaking himself out of his shock, Steve replies, “No. No, sir. I can see if Tony is interested in speaking with you.”
When Steve catches his glance, Tony puts down the tablet on the glass and iron table by the side of the bed and smiles. “Took you long enough.”
“Let’s move out,” Natasha said. She nodded to Clint and he went to the door, slipping outside into the corridor before moving back in and then gesturing to the gurney.
“Hey Steve,” Darcy says, and she raises a brow at him. She’s been in the teasing group of his friends. “How’s it going?” Her voice sing songs the words.
Tony turned around as JARVIS told him that Captain Rogers awaited entrance. For a second, it looked like Tony might throw something at Steve, but instead he gestured and the door unlocked. Steve pulled it opened. As he stepped in, Steve said, “Thank you for agreeing to see me.”
Steve admits to himself he’s a little disappointed at that suggestion, but his job here is to ensure the prince’s happiness. He waits for the prince to sit before he takes the chair across from him.
“Don’t see how,” Steve says as he carefully positions the cup at Bucky’s mouth while holding his head in place. Bucky sips the liquid and cringes.
“You knew?” Tony asks.
A gust hits them and Steve squints at the frigid air. Tony activates the helmet again without allowing him to assess the cuts and abrasions. Considering the freezing air, Steve can’t blame him.
“Wanda, I didn’t know you were going to be here. I’m so glad to see you. It’s only been a few days, but I already miss everyone.”
“I’d really like that.” Tony hisses. “Not calling you Dummy, but for you to help me.”
“But not really, like it’s a mess.”
“The ship, why is it called the Avengers. I mean I think I could understand the Avenger, but why the plural?” They’ve made it to the busier section of the ringed station. A turn to the right and through the adjacent arm, Steve would enter the brothel district and go home. It’s strange that he thinks of a brothel as home, but that’s what it is – he tells himself. The Avengers – well that’s not his home.
“No, I’m not done here,” Tony says. He pulls his arm away from her and turns his attention back to the man drooping down to the floor of the cell. Pep starts to protest but he glowers at her and she stops, swallowing down any objections. “Now, tell me why your clan’s dead but you’re alive.”
It’s not until later that evening when Steve escorts Tony back to his bedroom suite, that he’s alone with his boss again. As he opens the door and guides Tony into the room, Steve summons the courage to broach the subject. It feels a little like the first time he led a mission and he had to order his unit to sneak through enemy lines. “Tony, I wanted to apologize. What happened on that video was inexcusable. I shouldn’t have spoken to the reporter and I know I shouldn’t have said what I said. I hope you’ll forgive me.”
“Tell me what you want me to do for you?” Tony says. His eyes widen, imploring and seeking – what Steve doesn’t know. A small part of him thinks it might be absolution.
“For a taste,” the vampire said and smiled.
“Shit!” Steve reached for Tony as he shifted away on the bed. “I’m sorry. That was insensitive of me. God, Tony. I didn’t mean anything by it.” The idea that he would joke about the torture that Tony had gone through repulsed him.
“Right now,” Pepper said and stopped at the dresser as she pulled out her intimate wear. The pretty panties, the beautiful silks and satins. “Right now. After you jerked off in the shower screaming Steve’s name?”
Tony grins. “It was kind of silly. And sappy. But I still watched it as a kid.”
“Please, Steve. Please. I need you. I want you-.” He stops and squeezes his eyes closed as Steve peers up at him.
Pepper takes the quilt and steps into the vestibule, gesturing for Steve to follow her. He hesitates only a moment, but then steps up and enters the house. He can hear the squeals of laughter from what Steve can only call the hospital room on the first floor of the house. Pepper ushers Steve to the entrance as Jarvis exits. He has a tray of mashed up, discarded food.
Steve put his hands up in surrender. “You don’t have to do this, Sam. It won’t change the way we work with you or think about you. Well, it makes it easier to work an op together. We always know where we are and the hazards instinctively.”
“You make me happy too.”
“SHIELD recovery tent,” Natasha supplied.
“Ah! I have something for that!” Tony rifles around in his bag and brings out a small clip that has a round disc that can be no larger than Steve’s fist. “Put that on your wrist.”
“You needed the money?” Tony says. “I can fucking give you a god damned fortune-.”
Tony pulled away and arched a brow at Steve. “You’ve been hanging out with Nat again?”
“Maybe we get out and get something to eat. I mean we did both miss lunch,” Tony says and gathers Steve against him. Steve caresses a hand down his cheek and against the pulse point of his life. Tony gazes at him, not breaking eye contact. “I want you to only be with me this week.”
He seizes Tony’s hand and the pulse of energy tingles, and it borders on hurting. Tony accelerates up the hill. Steve only realizes after a few horrified minutes that he’s using the repulsor of his other hands to warm the snow and ice. The melted slush makes it easier to get through the snow but also leaves a slippery path for them.
After a moment’s reflection, Steve said, “Sir, if you will. I need an alpha and I don’t think going to the blocks if there are any these days is the best idea.”
"Please don't what?"
The idea of removing his gland wasn’t a bad one, Steve thinks. Neutering himself and removing people from danger as well as stopping the disaster of his heats – it’s a sacrifice he’s still willing to make. Maybe doing it himself wasn’t the wisest thing to do, but a professional might help him. Maybe Ross would be willing to consider it.
“Come on,” Tony says and begins to dab at the largest of the welts.
Steve sets down the shield and gestures like it’s the crown jewels – and to him it probably is. “I’ll hold her, and you climb on.”
“Oh Blu? That’s what they called him. He was seen all over Europe for so many years.” She tucked the blankets around him. It was a chilly May day. “Many people said he had an intelligence in his eyes. That he would try his best to interact with people, but it never worked. People always saw him as the beast he was. So, he disappeared into the forests. When he was seen again, Blu acted more and more like an animal. He scared people away from him. Some said he even attacked people, but no one had any evidence. They only knew the stories of him helping people.”
Reaching for the water, Steve thanks her and sips it as she places the tray on the mobile table. She tries to offer him the crackers again but he refuses.
She continued weaving her way through the hallways of the Triskelion and raised an eyebrow as she cast a glance at him. “Like I said, this just made my job much easier.”
He reaches out for Tony as he touches the beach. Tony accepts his hand and they walk to the house.
Jarvis glowers at him. “I will bring the tea momentarily. Dinner will be served in the dining room within the hour.” He nods once to Steve and then disappears back into the mudroom and through to the kitchen.
The construct staggers to its feet, one knee bleeding copiously. Clint limps toward Steve, his face contorted in pain. The bizarre haircut is gone. The sword replaced with arrows. Steve grabs for the bag, but Clint falls and the agony of his wail echoes in the air.
Natasha turned around and eyed him when he walked into the living space. She was having a pajama day as she liked to call it. Wearing thick fleece pajama bottoms with Star Wars characters patterned all over them and an oversized sweat shirt, she had a bowl of strawberries on her lap and she smiled at him as he plopped down on the opposite side of the couch.
“If you can’t trust Fury, trust me.” It was never more apparent than at that moment, that Steve Rogers was a stranger to this world. The Howling Commandoes were his team, his partners, his equals, but they also trusted Steve’s word, his intuition, his decisions. With this new life he started from square one and most of the time he didn’t even know where square one was. “You don’t have to worry. Just because I come from the early 20th century, and I seem like the ultimate optimist, I grew up during the Great Depression and cut my teeth during the worst war in history, I do have a tendency to be less than a follower. I will keep you protected. You won’t be forced to be part of SHIELD. You’ll have your freedom, I promise you that.” With that Steve knew it was time to leave. The urge to get out of the Tower, out of the laboratory and back home to that quiet little apartment in Brooklyn overcame him like a compulsion. He rubbed his hands on his pants. “I think it might be time for me to leave. I want to thank you, Bruce, for being patient and realizing this is all new to me.”
And for the first time he realized the feelings, the sense of displacement mixed with marvel, weren’t his own emotions at all. He placed a hand on his chest. “Steve?” Christ, if he was stunned, lost, when he confronted a simple thing like a luxurious hotel room, the entire world must be hell. Tony crossed the room and went to open the door only to stop when he discovered Steve standing on the other side with his hand raised to knock.
Steven smiles at Tony for the first time. It’s genuine and tender as if there’s some attachment between them. Tony’s heart sings. Steven turns back to Jamison and says, “Sir, it is my understanding you will be in charge of my training for the Stark family.”
“I can’t play, any-.” The words cramp in his throat as it closes on him. He shakes his head. The word fizzles a little.
“Come on Bruce. You’re Bruce. Don’t let Ultron tell you any different,” Steve says – his breath coming out in raspy puffs. Logically he knows it isn’t Bruce, but Ultron must have added something of Bruce, otherwise the monster before him truly is a beast. Hulk throws another punch, but Steve easily matches it with the shield. He finds his footing in the deep snow and slashes low against Hulk’s bare legs. The shield slices cleanly, and blood cascades down Hulk’s thighs and calves. If he has any hope at all, Steve needs to hobble Hulk.
He waves at her and wanders to the line of cells that are empty. Three of the cells are dark and the computer readout states that the cells do not contain omegas. The fourth one is dark as well but it states it contains an omega.
“Didn’t know if it would work,” Steve said. He focused on their hands together. This was okay. This was how it should be. “The bonds, you know, don’t bleed out. I mean, if I reach out to only you I’m pretty sure it’s not like a party line and everyone gets the signal. Just you get the signal, if I’m focused.”
The lighting effect fades to a muted blue green but the bed still looks enticing and comforting. Further into the room he finds an attached bathroom that’s beyond his wildest dreams. A soaking tub and a jetted tub, a walk in shower that’s bigger than Steve’s room at the brothel with so many shower heads he can’t fathom how the ship has a large enough store for the water.
“Not him! Why did they do this to him?” Steve said. He jerked against their embrace. “He’s innocent. All he did was help me.”
“No pleasantries anymore, Captain?” Coulson frowns. “What happened to all those manner you learned back in the day?”
“You must be more than appreciative. You must commit.” Jarvis is a tall man. He’s doesn’t have the bulk of muscles that Steve has, but he possesses the height and a certain protective mode that can only be likened to an animal protecting its cub. “It has been years since sir has opened up and revealed his state to anyone. He lives a very secure life. He might look like the partier. He may flash smiles at the paparazzi. But that is all superficial. Master Tony is not made of iron, Captain Rogers.”
So Tony laid it on the line. “Brother? He’s part of the pack? What the hell?” It pieced together now; the constant undercurrent of dissonance. One song amongst all the rest continued to be off chord, a mix of straining broken harmonies. “He’s the one in the background, right? The one that’s constantly throwing headaches my way?”
The stately bathroom is something out of a mansion, a palace on one of the Council Worlds. Having something like this in a ship is a luxury that few could afford. Steven doesn’t even notice the ancient marble, the sculpted fixtures that look like water fowl, the large walk in shower, or the bath that is more like a miniature swimming pool with a walk in side that slowly immerses the bather.
“Only time will tell,” Steve says and sets about kissing and touching Tony with his new freedom.
“Hmm,” Steve says as he crosses the room and studies the prince. “I’m not so sure about genius. Who here didn’t even know about popsicles.”
Steve’s question brought Tony out of his reverie. He turned from the mirror and smiled, it felt crooked as if it bent under so much pressure. “Aren’t you?” He pulled the tie from his neck. “I still think it’s too soon. We can’t do this. There aren’t enough of us.”
Tiberius laughs again, too loud and too awkward but Tony joins in and knocks Steve on the arm. Steve smiles and it cracks his face. He pushes past the uncomfortable stretch of time. “Sir, please relax while I get your assignment for transport.”
Both of them sip freshly brewed coffee, leaning against the counter in the kitchen area. Tony knows a little bit of heaven as he drinks the coffee and Steve’s satisfied look. He could come to love that look, crave it, want to settle it on Steve’s face all the time. But then again, Tony tends to want things he cannot have. For a billionaire he really is a pauper in some aspects of life.
Steve stumbles out of the chair. “I thought you didn’t know. I thought you would hate me. All this time, I thought. There were days I couldn’t even look at you. It was eating a hole in me. When I watched The Empire Strikes Back, that’s all I could think of – how I betrayed you. How everything was a lie.”
Pepper finds him in the gym and trailing behind her is a woman with startling red hair and full lips and eyes like the nebula. He nearly stops breathing when he sees her.
After he suited up as much as he could without a uniform, Steve went to the window and hit the manual switch to untint it. “Damn.”
Steve remembers the man, the alpha who touched him, who brought him through his most recent heat. He recalls the need warring with his mind – how he didn’t want it and how he desired it at the same time. Shame warms him and he cannot look at Tony. “You don’t know.” It’s all he can manage because the light narrows and he hears the beeping monitor screaming. The pain is a clear thing now, a thing with substance and girth. It’s taking him away and he surrenders to it. Tony’s on his feet over the bed, holding but Steve cannot focus. Everything funnels down until he can only see Tony’s face, his eyes.
“Sir?”
Tony bends close to Steve’s mouth; their foreheads touch. “That’s what I said, isn’t it? All this time, Steve. We wasted too much time.”
The patterns on his chest burned and he cringed against it, but then in his arms, Tony jerked and gasped a breath. Steve opened his eyes to see Tony startling awake. “Wha? What?”
“It’s standard practice with the principalities and with the guild. So no issues. You came out squeaky clean, if you’re worried. And thus, the reason I should have listened before going ballistic.” She sighs, the burden of protection of someone she cares for very obviously heavy on her shoulders. “With the assassination attempts we can’t be too sure.” She squeezes his hand. “But thank you for thinking about him and for taking care of him. This schedule looks refined and perfect. He’ll actually get some rest as well as eat well for the first time in ages.”
He starts to eat, because he wants to understand why Stark is here more than anything, and what an unconventional life means.
Immediately, Thor stepped up to the task. “I will help you with our Brother.”
Steve rolls his eyes. “Just stop.” Okay he jumped to conclusions. “You can stop now.” He follows Thor out of the bathroom as his friend tosses himself around the room in faked anguish. “Just stop.”
He blinks in the bed, half sitting up. He's cold, very cold and they don't tell him why. They offer him warm blankets, soup, and hot tea. He asks for Peggy, but they tell him he doesn't know a Peggy. He asks for Dugan, or Gabe, and they tell him he's mixing reality with his fantasy life from the movies. When he asks for his family, because surely he has family, the nurse only pats his hand and shares his frown. He's alone, he was a foster child growing up and he has no one. He spills the hot tea down his chest and hisses as it burns. She helps to clean him up and he shivers but not from the cold. Something is wrong.
Steve steadies himself by filling his lungs and releasing it. “Yes, Sir Stark, everything should be ready.” He looks between them and says, “Be ready to launch in thirty minutes. I’ll wait outside the door to escort you.”
Steve grasps the keys and nods. Remembering himself, he replies. “Yeah we are.”
“Wow!” he says with a full mouth.
“Amazing.” Steve bobs his head in agreement. He keeps silent on his views of gays so Tony deosn’t press it. The last few days must be hard enough. Tony’s not going to get into a debate about whether he agrees with him.
“That’s probably true.”
“We can talk about that later, come on,” Tony says and clasps Steve around the bicep to help him up. He wobbles a bit, and Tony thinks he shouldn’t be this weak. The physical bruises and injuries are minor. “Are you okay?”
That doesn’t compute and Tony knows it. Just three weeks ago, Steve appeared at Tony’s door with a query, a simple question. To give him a chance. The sun had been bright that day, so golden in its aspect that it set highlights in Steve’s hair, it blushed his cheeks in the light. Tony uttered words, what he said he can’t remember. All he can recall is the warmth that ran through him like a drug. He wanted this – a fantasy come to life.
“Ye-yeah,” Steve replied but couldn’t stop the quaking from the cold.
EPILOGUE
Going to the stone fireplace, Tony finds the control panel on the wall and taps out the commands. It’s a real wood burning fireplace, but it does have some automation. All he needs to do is ensure the wood is stacked.  “Query: Wood?”
“Are you going to be grouchy all the way there, Sheriff. We could take a break, I could get on my knees and do something about your mood,” Tony says and smiles.
“Steve!” Tony dropped Bucky’s hand and reached out to his Beloved. His hand came away wet with blood.
“I need to sterilize some equipment. Is there something on board I could use?”
“It won’t be easy. I don’t think any of you believe that. The best way to do this is to pool resources. And to know our enemies,” Steven says. “In the short time I’ve been able to review and evaluate the different sides, I can tell you that Estane will solicit the Bey’Hammyre. Hammyre has the firepower – he’s one of your up and coming industrialists. He doesn’t have a clan to work with so he’ll be eager to join up with one that could fight for power. I take it you don’t want him in your coalition?” Steven’s eyes are fierce with intelligence and it takes Tony’s breath away.
Steve rattles the manacle attached to his wrist and then lifts his hand to his mouth or would if the chain allowed him. It comes up short. He can't reach his mouth with either of his hands. He's been dependent on the Red Skull to find the mercy to feed him over the past year and a half.
“Yeah, you do. Thor’s here to talk to you,” Sam said and promptly left the room. Steve spun around on his heel to question him, but the door closed as he opened his mouth to speak. Instead he settled for a muttered curse.
“Done.”
Tony orchestrated it, but then each of the members of the pack brought together something stronger, something more beautiful, something united. Steve was their leader, their guardian, and his soul vibrated with their energies. Tony had often heard about religious people calling for lifting up someone in distress, but this – this was what happened. Throughout the service, each of them comforted Steve, each of them lent him their energy to hold onto the day and see it through to the end. Each of them offered and gave. As the service wound down, Tony lightly untangled the threads of their united soul to the individual ones and he watched as each of his pack members sighed a long exhale and then blinked as if coming awake.
“Yeah. That’s it.” He pinches the bridge of his nose. The idea of fake dating Tony even for one night raises – not only all kinds of ethical issues in his current position – but an emotional tsunami of feelings. He’s been carrying this loaded attachment, of developing feelings for Tony, for the last few weeks. Most of the time, Steve has successfully ignored it and outright pretended it just wasn’t there. He’s focused solely on the work. Now, it’s at the forefront and he doesn’t know if he can handle the idea of just fake dating Tony. Not to mention the guilt he feels for leaving Peggy’s memory behind.
“Yes, sir.”
“I’ll call. Don’t worry.” He gestures for her to get along with her work. “Oh, and remember you have that trip to the West Coast.”
Steve pauses, a rolled t-shirt in his hands. “You respected me as Blu. You loved me as Blu. All you see me as now is another person using you.” He twists the shirt. “I’ve never been the type of person to live on the dole. I didn’t do it when I was hungry during the Depression, I didn’t beg as a lion, and I’m sure as hell not going to do it now. Especially not with you.” He throws the t-shirt into the duffle. “You can say it was a sham marriage – like it is. Like you said. We’re just pretending. Don’t be shy about it, Tony. You’ve never been shy before,” Steve says. “I saw the stuff online. I know how it is.”
“The lion is ours and he will do our bidding. Not the bidding of a western fool.”
“Decades.”
“Well, it’s not planned so it’s just like a lottery, only we rigged it.” Tony winks at him and Rhodes wanders over. He stands to the side as if adding a solid wall of protection for Tony. Steve doesn’t know where Happy and Pepper disappeared.
The scientists only shook their heads.
“Fuck,” Tony says and clasps his hands over his eyes. “I shouldn’t have come-.”
“Don’t throw up on me, Cap. It’ll hurt more than you messing up my clothes.”
Bucky decides to pop in at that point. “Yeah, and thank God almighty that he came along since you were near death’s door-.”
The dark hallway greets him. The silence deepens unnaturally. He hears every breath, the pump of his heart in his ears, the swallow of his throat. His footfalls thunder in the quietude. It’s not like a silence in the real world; the real world hums. The din of humans clatters in the background. It took Steve ages to get used to sleeping in the forest when he fought in WWII because the distant ring of humanity had been absent.
Sam had a point, Steve had to admit. When he gave that speech at the Triskelion, there were good people there, people not part of his pack – Sharon amongst them – who stood up and took a stand. The soul pack and the universe didn’t determine everything. “So you think our souls aligned. Before it was chance, but this – this was our doing.”
He keeps whistling, even in the fierce wind, trying to call out for Shield. He hopes the horse hasn’t broken her leg, or slipped a shoe. Out here, he’d have to shoot the horse if the leg is broken or even sprained. There’ll be no two ways about it.
Something rooted in his soul and Steve couldn’t deny it. “Is that what you’re doing?”
Steve cleared his throat and Tony held his breath. “I have to admit, I feel a little wrong. Guilty. Don’t, don’t say anything. It’s not that easy to get over indoctrination, you know. I grew up thinking one thing.” He rubbed a hand up and down Tony’s arm. “It felt wonderful though. This, it felt good.”
She steps closer to the bed and shakes her head. “Don’t, Steve. This last year, it’s been hard. Harder on you than most people want to even consider.”
Tony grumbles next to him as if he heard Steve’s thoughts. He pats Steve’s hand and rolls onto his back. Yawning, he says, “You think too loud.”
“Decade,” Pepper said, and her expression turned concerned and troubled. Tony tried not to think about what he’d been doing ten years ago. The memories were murky and filled with alcohol, drugs, and sex. All along this place existed for decades, for longer than Tony had been alive and something in there was the creation of his father’s madness and willingness to work with the devil. Tony shook himself out of the panic that squeezed his heart.
“Do me a favor?” Tony says.
Steve only nods, knowing it is too late to save his soul. Somehow, Tony gets Steve’s pants off, and then pulls off his own shirt and pants. Tony’s gorgeous. In the small alcove of the room where the bed’s nicely tucked, Tony straddles over Steve and picks up a bottle from the side table.
Steve shakes his head. “Nope. I think they call it some kind of amnesia, I don’t know. Traumatic? I don’t recall.” He gives a little laugh. “But you know, no reason not to like the snow.”
“Was your alpha, Dany, was he kind to you?” Tony asks as he takes up the soap and starts to clean Steven.
The shades of memory materialized not like echoes but vibrant and real.
“Now repeat it as you concentrate on the bonds between.”
“So, Pepper is strawberries. What’s Happy?” Steve asks. He hasn’t moved his leg, even as Tony gently follows the contours of it with his hand.
“Steve.” Tony hates to say it, but they need to stop the charade – at least in the mansion. “You don’t have to pretend, you know. You’re free to do whatever you want to do. You don’t have to stay cooped up here all the time.”
“Don’t be so exasperated, Rhodey. This is me. I can do this,” Tony says and starts to get out of bed, but a firm, lanky hand pushes him back.
“I don’t mean for our relationship to cause you undo pain,” Tony says. “It was my understanding you were a sub-omega.”
She moved her food around in her plate for a few minutes in the silence of the dining room. Picking up her wine glass, she drank it down and then stood up. “Go and search for your boyfriend, Howard, but if you do you’re not to come to my bed again.” She threw her cloth napkin down onto the plate and stormed out.
“Yep,” Clint says but his answers halting. He looks away and then back at them. “Are you here to get away from the big bad?”
“It will work, right?” Tony asks. “He’ll have a functional gland and the serum will be fixed.”
“Your own comic book? Your own creation?” Tony smiles and Steve sits up properly as if his acceptance means the world to Steve.
To keep his mind busy, Steve asks, “Ultron, he has to follow his own rules. Right?”
“Scott’s a chemical engineer 2 years out of prison. Let’s not base whether or not I’m going to get my sight back on his concerns,” Tony says. “Now come here and drink in my morning breath.”
“Yes, sir.”
“I’m not sure what you mean? Are you talking about God? You know how I feel-.” Tony twists to look at Steve.
Steve moves into Tony’s hand. “I never thought I could have this. It just seemed like I was making it up.”
“Not far - only a klick to the east.”
“He likes a big thick juicy steak. I’m afraid he’s an all American meat and potatoes kind of guy.” It’s Tony. Of course. Walking in and cracking jokes like nothing has happened between them.
“It’s fantastic. It’s so much better than the outside. Outside is so ugl-.” He gulps back the rest of the word.
The lion nods again in affirmation. He would do anything for Tony, too.
Tony wanted to take the pain away so he stood up and walked the length of the table. Though it was for just the two of them it could have easily sat eight people. Tony joined Steven at the end of the table, offered his hand, and they both stood to go to the lounge. “Bring the wine and the glasses.”
Tony wants to say
The glittering lights around them enhanced the want and desire in Steve’s eyes. “Please do.”
“Negative that,” Bucky says as he grips Steve by the arm and forcibly gets him to his damaged feet. “Steve won’t be able to climb a ladder.”
Tony screws up his face. “You’re being soft. We could get there earlier.”
Tony squeezes Steve’s hand and never wants to let go. He never wants to leave this moment because it feels like he’s saying goodbye. He knows it’s ridiculous to think that way. It isn’t goodbye. They’ve only just started, but now there’s a whole lifetime between them.
A clatter across the workshop room jolts him to his senses and he looks. Through the hazy entwined holographs he spots a star sitting on a broad chest.
This is no dream come true. This is reality, a reality marred by pain and angst, a reality supplemented with joy and bliss. He’s seen more of his own agony over the years, but little of the happiness so many others have been able to capture. The idea that this might be only momentary has been wiped away by Steve’s assurances. Something perfect and heartfelt supports him for the first time in his life. He can be himself and not worry about rebuke, rejection, or reprimand. It’s been a constant in his life. He’s come to live with it as a yoke around his neck, like an albatross he carries with little hope of freedom.  Yet, now in Steve’s hands he becomes something more, something peaceful, something hopeful. He becomes someone.
“You’re going to be sorry that you’re doing this. It won’t be tolerated at the highest level,” Rumlow warned.
“Steve!”
“I don’t know, it seems pretty close to me,” Steve says but then again, he’s found something he never could capture in life. He shrugs. “Maybe I’m wrong. But I’m glad I ended up here, with you.”
“Then let’s be selfish, together.”
“How could you trust the Post Office?”
“Yeah, well things change. Apparently, they want to ally with the Conclave because of the Supreme Intelligence has been infiltrating their ranks, causing all kinds of problems. Don’t you keep up with the news, Steve? I’m disappointed that you don’t know.” Wanda frowns at him. “To be a good escort you need to update yourself at all times.”
Lurching out of the bed, Bucky leaps on him using his knees to pin Steve to the floor. He releases Steve only for a second but then something inside, some horrible nightmare whispers to him and he punches Steve, clocking him right in the chin with enough force to snap his head back. The hysterical look in his friend’s eyes tells Steve that whatever Bucky is seeing isn’t here, isn’t today.
Steve cracks open his eyes and the room swirls around him. He gags and squeezes his eyes closed again. A weight lands on his shoulder and he realizes it is a hand, slight pressure that isn’t threatening though he jerks under its touch.
“No,” Steve said and stepped away from Tony. The thought of touch repulsed him then. He separated himself. He didn’t want touch. Not now. Maybe not ever.
Again, Tony’s hands are on his face, gently stroking him. “No, Captain, don’t do that. Allow it to spread over you.” He wonders if Tony has some kind of ability to read his mind.
“What?” It was all Tony could come up with to ask.
“Well what do you know,” Tony says and finishes up. He steps out of the shower and towels dry. “So Xi died. How long did Carbonelli go without an omega?”
“No, I hadn’t checked out the second floor yet.” He looks up at the expansive arching ceiling with its exposed beams and log work.
“Glitch in what?” He almost asked about the pig’s blood but then his stone brain focused on Steve. “The synthetic blood. There’s something wrong with it. I knew it. I knew that was the reason-.”
Steve studies the bowl and then turns back to Tony. “Isn’t the Hayashi track the star lifecycle thing you just mentioned?”
Unguarded, Steve showed exposed gratitude to Tony, but more than that it spread out to the bond between them and only them. It fastened them together and began to stitch something different, something unexpected between them.
“Restless, but he hasn’t woken up fully,” Pietro whispers. “I’m going back to bed. Wanda and Vision are at Vision’s cottage if you need them.” He indicates the notepad on the table near the couch. “Phone number’s there.”
He won’t knot for a long time. Instead, he eases out of Steven’s mouth, watching the dribble of come on his lips. Tony wipes a hand down Steven’s face. He’s distraught with desire, the need to come. He’s beautiful in his misery. Tony is not a cruel man, but he understands the need to control power. Yet, the thought of causing this man pain hurts him for unknown reasons. Tony’s a master of weapon design; his life is about selling death. A little pain to a man who is to be his protection and his servant for the rest of his days shouldn’t bother Tony. But it does.
“You do it when your loopy from hunger, don’t you?” Tony narrows his eyes at him. He knows he’s right.
“You called.”
They start off.
“I’d heard that, I just never understood the significance.”
Steve bows his head, considering, and then blinks too quickly because the prickle of tears born from guilt and shame come unbidden to his eyes. He allows himself a moment to settle before he says, “You know what he is.”
She snickers. “You still don’t get it, do you?” She shakes her head. “Sometimes the lies that I tell, even I fall for, Rogers. Sometimes, I even believe them.” Her gaze drifts over to Bucky’s and she smiles, softly, sweetly, lightly.
But Steve forgot the eggs and everything else, the only thing his brain focused in on was the report out – something had happened. He cursed inwardly but remained stoic to his friend. “What is it you want to say, Thor?” That sounded more like a challenge than a friendly question. He attempted to calm his nerves, but he conceded it was a lost cause. “Sorry, tell me.”
Steve slices the tomatoes. “No, probably not. Never stopped any of my teammates.”
“You’re bright,” Tony says and knows it’s nonsensical. “How do you do that? It’s very attractive.”
She pauses before she agrees. “Okay.”
“Done. Sir, due to the electrical damage you will not be able to sustain flight for more than a hundred miles.”
“Better not be Spanish,” Tony mocks and takes his place next to Steve. “I’ll help him walk.” The guards look to Ross for guidance, but he only waves them off. Tony is allowed to place his hand on Steve’s bicep again and usher him into the underground complex.  Tony leans in and whispers, “Pentagon.”
She only rolls her eyes at him. “You are a lost cause.”
“He would be the Lead in need of training,” Doctor Strange answered while Fury rounded his desk. Strange ignored Fury and instead focused on Steve. “Captain Rogers, you will be pleased to know that we will be lending out Wong’s services in order to train you in the ways of the -.”
Steve jerks a bit but Tony holds him. “Just for sleep. You don’t have to do that anymore.”
“There’s no then, Steve,” Tony whispers into the fabric of his shirt.
“Wow,” Tony said as he placed the pieces of metal and computer boards to the side. “That was fast and decisive. Like you don’t even have to think about it.”
“We gonna do this every fucking day,” the man – who Tony assumes is Rumlow – says. “You hear me, Rogers? I want you out here every day and I’m gonna.” He stops and groans as he pounds into Steve. “I’m gonna have my men in here, they’re gonna use you like the dog you are.”
“Soul packs are all different. Some soul packs function with the ability to communicate without spoken words. The secrecy of how soul packs work has led to myths and fairy tales about them. This has led to some nations conscripting these packs into service of the country’s needs. Other soul packs are more intimately involved with understanding emotions and supporting one another.” That would be nice, but then again, Steve wasn’t sure he liked the idea of anyone in his head. At least not these days. His head mixed emotions so fast he felt like he was on the rollercoaster at Coney Island again. “The rarest soul pack shares all communication and emotion. The more soul packs are in contact with one another, the stronger the bonds.”
Steve shook his head. “Not exactly? But I got a certain feeling, a tugging here.” He placed a hand on his chest. “Felt like you were falling into a chasm.”
Tony smiles, leaning against the door frame to their daughter’s bedroom. Steve is cuddled up in bed with Morgan, the book spread open on her lap as she sits on him. Tony loves the book, the illustrations especially.
Steve bowed his head and then looked up at Sam. “I can respect that. I’m sorry for your loss, Sam. I really am.”
“Ma liked the twilight. When the day was done, she told me that time was when all things were possible in the middle of night and day.” Steve had one arm resting on Tony’s back. The other he raised in the air and wove a tapestry – a story of his mother and his childhood. Tony imagined the words of Sarah Rogers telling her young, sick son about the magic of twilight. “She’d tell me there was nothing to be afraid of in the dark. The dark is just heaven close to Earth, she’d say.”
“Snow pants?” Tony gulps. “Why does that sound like I’m a toddler.”
“He’s more than important to me,” Steve said as he turned to Tony. He looked up at Tony.
This room is nothing like the prince’s quarters. The laboratory gleams bright and clean all the way up to the rafters. Steve drifts into the room, staring upward at the gantry and the support struts. It’s a marvel and Steve has to remember to close his mouth at the sight. Holographs illuminate the room with interfaces and schematics of things that befuddle him. It mesmerizes and captivates.
“He was not responsible, it was I.”  A different voice, a female voice. Wanda – the chef. The interruption takes him aback and he flails mentally trying to catch up as she continues to speak. “Pietro is my brother and I should have asked for permissions. But I did not. Vision was kind enough to allow my brother to learn from him and to teach him. Pietro will not disclosure your secrets. He will sign the same forms I have.”
“It’s really no problem. I find it relaxing. Just drink your coffee. I know you’re not human until you get a gallon in you.”
“Have you ever thought about building something instead of breaking the other factions. I mean, why not build those alliances and then -.” Steve shrugs. He’s not a politician. “Then maybe have an election or something for chair or secretary general of the Conclave.”
“I’m not sure you have a say in it,” Tony says and then knocks Steve in the arm. “No, Capsicle, don’t worry I’m running some studies on the definition of consciousness. Trying to figure out our man here.” Tony points to Vision.
“Okay. I’ll see you in about ten days. You’re coming home a little early right?” She all back to business now.
“We’ll talk tonight.” Stane squeezes Tony’s upper arm, then winks at Steve over the prince’s shoulder. He mouths ‘later’ at Steve and then excuses himself.
“Tony’s important to me,” Steve added. “I love him.”
Nodding, he thanks her again and then asks, “When can I expect the alpha?”
When they arrived at the royal compound, Natasha’s quinjet had just landed and sirens blared across the grounds. One of the Dora Milaje met them on the steps of the palace and escorted them through the bustling hallways. Guards and Dora Milaje swarmed through the palace. The guards had an emblem of the sun on their chests and walked paired with the Dora Milaje. Steve wondered if they were mates of some of the vampires with the Dora Milaje’s ranks. As they approached the medical wing, Steve caught sight of several floating gurneys being guided through the corridors to the main triage area. Shuri directed the chaotic scene, but as Steve approached he realized that it was more orderly and efficient than it first appeared. Shuri reviewed each of the patients with a doctor or nurse at her side. She assessed and then gave the information to her medical staff. They quickly ushered the gurnies to the required area of the medical bay and began their work to save the patient.
“So, are you here too or did I fall asleep again?”
After quiet moments, Tony says, “I’d like you to accompany me to a luncheon tomorrow of the Conclave dignitaries. It will be a small affair. Nothing formal.”
Bruce scrunches up his face trying to follow Tony’s reasoning. “What are you saying Tony? You’re not making sense?”
“What do you mean, Steve?” Natasha whispered. The kindness touched her voice now with a stillness that meant tranquility and acceptance.
“Perhaps you could call Ms. Potts or Colonel Rhodes. They’ve been of great comfort to you in the past.”
“I thought having a Personal Assistant meant that you got to take the Personal Assistant wherever you wanted,” Steve says. He does not want to fake date Tony. It’s a recipe for disaster. Natasha – who doesn’t even really know Steve – even said he is a terrible liar. It isn’t even that he can’t pull off pretending to date Tony for a night, but the idea of keeping his feelings tucked away – that’s the problem. He sighs. This is even the first time he’s even admitted that his subconscious thoughts are invading his conscious feelings.
“I won’t, and you need to eat.”
“It’s in here. I’ve been working on a nanotechnology armor. I have all the math worked out for it; all I have to do is manufacture it in the real world. That means-.”
A kind doctor – one that it never saw again – promising hope from the sickness.
“Hmm, sir, I just wanted to tell you I’ve turned down your bed and laid out your clothes as Vision taught me.”
Would he have wanted to?
“Thanks.” They come upon a small brook. It’s not even a foot wide but Steve stops and eyes it. “We have a small stream. You’ll need to step over it. To miss completely about a foot and a half. I’ll for first.” Like a pro, Tony manages the stream without a problem. Steve beams but doesn’t compliment Tony because he might take offense to it.
“Yeah. I do.” Steve glares at Tony. He’s not sure why but something heated burns in his chest, a challenge, a test. “You want me to recite it, right now?”
“I never had anyone.” Steve looked away like he had earlier in the day, but then he had looked into the sun. Now it was the moon and the night calling back. “Peggy was just a dream. We never had a date. There was never anyone.”
anytime soon. So no, you can all kiss my ass. Fury didn’t want me to be part of his boy band and I have to agree.” Tony climbed to his feet. “You can let yourselves out of my conference room.”
“Other than it would throw Ultron off, give us some time.”
But how could he without damaging everything? He’d chosen not to in order to let the past stay where it was – in the past. Everyone had told him to let the past be – that he needed to grow into the future. The present. No one warned him that the past would hunt him like an animal for the rest of his days. His split mind about his past, about everything that happened in his past, in Bucky’s past, froze him into paralysis. He couldn’t fathom how to deal with it, so the easiest thing had been to ignore it, pretend it didn’t exist. Or let it lie.
“Tony?” Pepper’s hand shifted to his shoulder, bracing him, holding him, supporting him. But he didn’t want her support and that’s what damned him. He should embrace her, accept her, but he couldn’t. He had to face facts: he wanted this thing he had been denied.
He nods to Pepper and Happy, and gives Rhodes a quick salute that is more honorary than required since Rhodes left the Patrol in the first year of the interim government. He offers a salute back and shifts his stance to indicate the man of the hour is disembarking. There’s a warning in Rhodes expression; as if he’s disapproving of something, or someone. For a moment, Steve thinks it is him. Rhodes always challenged him to be better to Tony.
“Doctor?” Steve tests the words on his tongue but the air is still thick with sickness and the smell gags him. He retches but doesn’t vomit.
He rolls his eyes and says, “That’s all the way in the Aft section.” Exactly where he didn’t want to house an omega until he was assured of his loyalty. But it works and might win the omega a little more to his side.
“He won’t die,” Bruce muttered to himself as if he checked something internally, and then spoke to Tony. “His astral projection bonded to you. To you. There’s no breaking it.”
“No, you didn’t,” Tony says. “But luckily you told the whole world you were bonded to me at that press conference we had a few months back. You remember. You did it without my consent-.”
“Yes, okay. I’ll have Jarvis set Steve up in the suite next to yours. I also placed the phone, tablet, and computer for him in the room as well.”
Happy eyes them all with an untrusting gaze and Steve stays mum. It’s nice to be guarded but also, he’s never lived his life in fear. In fact, growing up, he took far too many risks. Both his mother and Bucky would agree. It makes Steve jittery to see how alert and concerned Happy acts. He marches by people, pushing what little crowds there are aside with a booming voice and instructions. It ends up drawing more attention than necessary. Steve only rolls his eyes and stays close to Happy.
Steve is not going to feel empathy for a mad robot. “I don’t think you can understand. You don’t get the depth of human feeling or circumstances. You don’t understand empathy or hope or desire or love.” He doesn’t mean to list it all, but there’s no stopping him now. “You don’t get to stand here and pretend you’re a living being. That you know what it is to long and yearn for someone that you’ll never have. You don’t get to pretend. You might think your Pinocchio, but you’re not a toy, or anyone’s puppet. You’ve always been a warped machine gone wrong.”
In the spacious shower -with so many jets of water it must be criminal-, they kiss again. Languid but not lazy. They kiss with their mouths but also with their hands. Hands rove bodies, caressing and touching. Each time Steve brushes over Tony’s chest he shudders in delight, each time Tony sucks at Steve’s neck he moans with desire. This isn’t a fuck and Steve knows it; his heart hammers in his chest but his mind soars. He wants to call this something else, something dangerous, but he forces his eyes open, he forces himself to think about his motions and not this spreading feeling through him that needs Tony in ways that are not permitted.
“Yes,” Tony says and folds a hand over Steven’s. “What do you think about Estane and the idea of Stalls?”
“If being like Bruce means I’m concerned for your welfare, then yes, I would think so,” Steve says and realizes as he states it that he’s more than concerned, he’s worried, a slow churning anxiety has seeded itself inside Steve. It’s like anything these days. He’s afraid of losing what he has ever since his experiences in the war.
“The Blood Den,” he said. He started away, with no intention of going in with them. He walked a few paces with his head down and then turned. “Don’t go in. It’s nothing you need to see, and everything you desire. Don’t go in.”
Steve sipped the tea and tried to pretend it didn’t feel like waiting in the examination room in the draft building at the world’s fair. Those minutes ticked by as if warped by molasses in January. He waited and hated the tea but drank it anyhow because his mother taught him manners. Eventually Bruce came back with a handful of papers.
“Nat should be back soon,” Bruce replied. “I got a call earlier today.”
Shaking his head, he replies, “No. The doctor said that it’s not repairing-.” He stops before he says uteri. “It’s not working. The damage is just getting worse.” His damaged angel is dying. “They need to-.” He sobs and puts his head in his hands. “How could I not -.” How could he not know? How could he be such an awful mate. “He’s dying, Nat. I didn’t even ask to see him before they brought him to surgery.”
“I wa-.”
He smiles but it feels like someone's plastered it on his face. "That's nice, I wish I could believe you, sir. Have the doctors told you why I am here?" He doesn't want to get anyone's hopes up that he'll recover from his injuries. None of the new memories - or the real memories the doctors have told him about - have actually come back. Only the fake ones - they've become more real.
“I need to know if you’ll agree to support my claim,” Tony says. “We’ve talked about it. Walked around it, but we haven’t actually gotten to the meat of it.” He glances at Steven who keeps his sights on each one of the members at the table. His eyes are keen and his concentration doesn’t waver – it is a wonder to behold considering he spent the morning being punished. “I have the best fleet, the best fire power. I own most of the factories and planets that produce the fire power.”
Steve crosses the room and folds Tony’s hands in his own. “I would never ask you to do a nude without your express permission Tony. Your t-shirt and jeans are good, but I would love you to have bare feet. I’m working on drawing feet, so that might help me.” He presents the chaise lounge again. “There’s a fire in the fireplace here so you won’t be cold.”
Tony agrees and places his cup near the coffee maker. He heads to the laundry room behind the kitchen. He thought he saw another door in the small room that may lead to the basement. He hits the jackpot and flicks on the light switch before attempting the stairs. They’re in a state of disrepair which surprises him since the rest of the house is pristine. When he finds the fuse box, he’s less than impressed; the wiring to the generator looks like a kid jerry-rigged it and the generator probably won’t go on automatically. He spends some time figuring out the wiring plan and then makes a mental note of tools he needs. For the rest of the morning, he rummages through old boxes, crates, and cabinets for tools.
“Yeah, I guess. He was delirious.” Tony looked amongst them. It hit him then like a wrecking ball to his gut and he clasped an arm over his abdomen and groaned. “Shit, shit, shit.”
Over the course of the week, their support network shows up. Natasha appears with Pepper. Rhodey takes turns sitting with Steve. Sam and Bucky stay the week in a hotel close to the clinic and often take Steve out to a diner just to get away. Jarvis and Happy are there in intervals. Bruce and Hank go over the data and are pleasantly optimistic. Even Thor shows up to support Steve. It’s nice. It’s perfect. But it’s terribly painful at the same time.
That can’t be right. No. Pepper never figured out Tony’s secret obsession. His father always called it dirty and disgusting. Tony’s been holding that secret in his heart for decades. “No. I haven’t been mooning and I don’t appreciate all you did to make sure I’m stuck here with Mister Shive Up His Ass for the long weekend.”
Steve closed down and that’s when Tony placed his hand over Steve’s and said, “Contact Sam. Find out what he knows. We’ll travel to DC or wherever the funeral takes place.” London. He thought Steve had said something about Peggy being moved to London by her children. “All of us together. Bruce, could you work with JARVIS and get the jet ready to go?”
“Here we are,” Tony says and turns, beaming at Steve.
Sam stared at him a moment longer, not moving and then it hit him. A smile spread across his face and he reached over to slap Steve on the knee. “Well, hot damn, you got it good.”
The dizziness returns and he sinks against the pillows, forgetting the worries and concerns as his ill health takes him again. He tries to call out, to find his way through the Boundaries, but what he receives is garbled and echoed – so much that he cannot make sense of it. He ventures further into the seams between the worlds, and there’s a darkness, a cloud heavy and thick surrounding him. It isn’t like fog, but more like acid against him. He screams out and it jolts him enough to free him from the Boundaries.
Steve blinks once, then twice. He doesn’t think this is part of the tour. He thinks maybe his ride might have derailed and he’s spiraling out of control about to crash to the ground. The way Jarvis glares at him is anything but kind. “Yes?”
“Please, Steve, please.”
The sounds of the street below died away, and in this silent space, Tony understood that breaking its sanctity with a clever quip would tear away any hope for something more. The fabric of space and time that held their astral projections together would fray and disintegrate. So he slowly reached out his hand to touch the insubstantial. When Tony grasped his lax fingers, Steve turned to face him with a look of longing and fear mixed together.
“No,” Bruce said and pinched the bridge of his nose. “But we got him back and repaired it. That’s all that matters.”
Steve leads the way up the floating deck toward the estate. Tony grasps his upper arm, knowing the steps and where he’s going makes it a little easier. After they disembark from the deck to the stone steps, Steve instructs Tony as they climb to the house. “There’s ten flat stone steps up the hill.”
The medical staff went back to work, monitoring and checking Sam’s vitals. He looked spent to Steve and soon as the nurses and doctors busied themselves, Sam drifted off to sleep. Steve and Tony stayed to the side out of the way until it was confirmed that Sam was out of the woods and in perfect health but in need of rest.
“Okay, so I built it with you as the core. It made sense that way. Resolving each equation to you as the solution. It actually ends up making sense because character traits cancel out or become additive to create the center or you.” Tony smiled and popped on the balls of his feet and then back down. “I’m the shell around you. It worked out that way. I didn’t manipulate the data if you think that. Each cluster around us-.”
“Like that worked the first time,” Tony said and Steve swallowed down the urge to spit back a reply. He just wanted the man out of his home.
He nearly swallows his tongue when she smiles at him and raises quirks an eyebrow at him.
“I left it-.”
“Sure did,” Howard said, and Tony detected a swell of pride in his father’s voice that deflated as he added, “Now it doesn’t matter because we don’t have the formula for the serum.”
The answer hurts more than it should. Why? Tony doesn’t know. Was he hoping that Steven possessed some kind of supernatural powers and could hear Tony weeping in the shower?
“A what?” Wanda whispered to Vision.
“I know what you mean,” Tony says. “My eyes are actually fine. I have damage to the optical nerve. “During the crash I had a traumatic brain injury. It caused an aneurysm in my brain near the optic chasm. I was able to survive, but unfortunately, the optic nerve was permanently damaged.”
Somehow Tony finagles the duvet over Steve and lies down next to him. “I’m right here. Just sleep. I’m not going anywhere.”
Clint pauses. The air chills in response. Steve glances over his shoulder to the entrance portal area and that’s completely disappeared. Even if they wanted to, they couldn’t escape that way since it’s now been replaced with a field of corn. When Steve looks back all the constructs are paused. Laura has her hand on a pitcher of lemonade. Lila has her bow pulled back (she has good form – is that something that Ultron is hypothesizing or does Tony know about her abilities). Both the Barton boys are frozen in the field with a ball in the air between them. The sound of the birds twists into a high pitched buzzing noise like a thousand locusts descending.
Steve only side eyed Sam. “I’m not certain I like the idea of having people change their lives for me. Look at what’s happened so far. ” He could go into all that had gone wrong, but the rawness left him empty.
Steve sticks on the word ‘over’ in his head. Before he knows what he’s doing, he runs off at the mouth, “If this works is my job over? Like am I out of a job?” He can make it on what Tony’s paid him for probably nearly a year if he’s prudent. He can get more work, maybe sell the Iron Man comic to Thor and Jane. It’s possible.
“Earth to Steve?”
The door sweeps open and Steve steps into the workshop. His gaze seeks Tony, looking first toward the Iron Man armor hanging near the interface cubby and when he doesn’t find Tony there, he searches the wide laboratory. When he finally sees Tony and Bruce, Steve smiles – broadly.
“And?” She waits.
“Little longer, little longer,” Tony said and urged Steve deeper into his need by lapping at nipple, by nipping him along his chest.
“It was kind of mutual?” Steve says. “She was homesick and couldn’t stand the injustice in a place that had been built on the idea of equality. I think she’d make a good one of those women protesters in New York. She’d like it out here where women get to vote.”
Steve’s had a lot of practice over the months he’s been a whore holding back his orgasm until his assignment finds fulfillment. He can do this all day. But this time, he doesn’t have to – not at all. He can come, and fill Tony up. “I’m gonna fill you up, baby. You hear that sweet one, you’re gonna drip with me for days and days.”
Steve shuffles around and pushes against the soft mattress. His wings, his tortured wings flop against his back and he winces, curling up as if he’s smacked hard onto the pavement from a great height.
That’s patronizing and a little comforting at the same time. Steve swallows down his snippy reply and sinks back into the shadows of the archway. “You have any ideas about what’s next?”
The ship banks and he grabs onto the strap to stay standing. He glances to the side, his battle buddy meets his gaze with a determined fierceness. Sam knows how important this mission is, but not how very important and personal it is for Bucky. Jedi may not form attachments, love might be forbidden but it's not impossible and it's not as if a Jedi can switch off emotions. Steve has been his star, his guide, his one hope when all other hopes have dissipated. While Bucky plays the big game always acting like everything rolls off his back, Steve saw through all that. He doesn't know if it's the Force or just how Steve always looked at him. He just knows his heart and force sensitive soul seeks Steve for a reason.
“I’m a man who likes what I see, who always gets what I see, but for some reason – so inexplicable reason, I want you to see me. Really see me.”
Steve looks away, grappling to catch hold of the bag before it follows Clint. The backpack slides again, but Steve hooks it with the tip of his fingers and yanks it toward him. That motion only causes him to skid further down the gravel slope.
Steve waits, and nods. He only wants what’s best for Bucky. “What is it?”
“Well, if we’re going to be together we might as well lay it all on the line. The good, the bad, the beautiful (that’s me), and the ugly.” He munches a bit on the sandwich.
“Like quantum entanglement,” Steve murmured as he fell back to the bed.
Tony saw the tear stains on Steve’s cheeks as he fought his own gag response. But he was a fast learner and he relaxed his throat until Tony pushed further and then Steve swallowed. The undulations sent shockwaves through Tony and the coil deep in his groin released like a spring and he came with a hard jerk until he was paralyzed by it. He couldn’t stop as Steve welcomed him, pulled him deeper. Air. Oxygen. It vacated his lungs as he came and came in a spill down Steve’s willing and open throat until finally he was spent. The air burned as he writhed through his first breath in forever. He opened his eyes and there was only silence.
Steve volunteered to clean up and the rest of the team slowly exited to sit by the fire pit to relax in the haze of the late summer twilight. Tony lingered at the edge of the kitchen watching as Steve quietly washed the dishes, foregoing even cracking about the dishwasher open.
“You guess?” Tony scoffed. “Come on, you have the most valuable bachelor Tony Stark, standing in the middle of a corn field professing he wants to dream a future with you. You have to be impressed with that.”
“Geez, Clint, no,” Steve says. “No, I know how this might look, but it’s not that. Remember when Stark first came on the Commando? You remember how elusive he was.”
It seems peculiar that he’s nose blind to the smells of the food. Picking up the sandwich he bites into it as Tony watches, his eyes trained on Steve’s mouth. The first bite activates Steve’s salivary glands – but he tastes nothing. Nothing at all. His throat closes up again and his chest explodes with pain. He drops the sandwich, and it falls apart.
Her expression changed, shifting to worry. “I’m not his attending doctor, but I do know that he’s very confused and difficult to understand right now. He hadn’t been responsive until this morning, and now he’s agitated and difficult. Are you sure-.”
Clint whines in pain and then another figure appears at the top of the hill. It’s not who Steve wants or wishes. It’s Laura.
Steve gently removes Tony’s arm from his face. “Hey, hey. That’s not you. You already told him that’s not you. You have the choice here, Tony.”
“Captain.” The word strikes a chord and he startles. “We all know your identity here. We thought it would be best to offer you someone who is paid to be discreet, knows what he’s doing, and will treat you well.”
Now Tony was before him, like a feast for a starving man. Tony bent over him, a smile etched across his face. Steve could no more deny the truth. He encompassed Tony in his arms, his strong arms that were made for war but could be gentle for loving as well. In the next moments, he learned, and he taught. He understood another body and he learned more about his own body. Tony touched him and kissed him. When Steve returned the favor the heightened breaths, the shiver against him thrilled Steve. It encouraged a touch to the flank, that slide down to cup Tony’s cheek and teased against his ass. Tony continued Steve’s education in both a physical and metaphysical way. As Steve nuzzled against him, testing his teeth on Tony’s nipples, Tony panted and gasped but also knitted their souls into more intricate patterns, connected and networked together in tight harmony. When Tony showed Steve the lube and slipped some of it on his own fingers to prepare himself, Steve hitched a breath and wondered if he might go into an asthma attack. Watching Tony enter himself with fingers sizzled Steve’s neurons and sang through the soul bond. He didn’t realize it could be like this, that he could enjoy and lose the inhibitions of his day. When Tony guided Steve inside, Steve perched over him holding his breath. He hated the idea of hurting anyone, especially Tony. With encouragement, Steve pushed inside, and the sensation stole his conscious thought, ate the air from his lungs, throbbed his blood in his ears until he thought he might go deaf from it.
“No, no,” Tony says. “Why don’t I do that for us? Sit.” Tony escorts Steven to the sitting lounge of his large bedroom. It’s an alcove to the side of the room that has a curved balcony outside wide sliding glass doors. “Sit. I’ll get the wine. How about some snacks? Are you hungry?”
By the time Steve climbs the gantry and gets to the ship, it’s the middle of the night. He must have spent more time in the Brothel than he intended. He’s hungry and tired and all he wants to do is go home and to bed. It frightens him that the thought of home brings Tony’s face to mind. He needs to apologize to Tony first. Running out on him without an explanation was wrong and he has to face the music. No one stops him from entering the ship, so Steve takes this as a good sign. The prince still welcomes him.
Steven looks away and says, “I loved my alpha. He loved me.” His voice quakes as he speaks. “I would have done anything for him. Anything. I did what I had to do to try and save him.” He looks back then and meets Tony’s gaze. “But he’s lost to me now.”
Tony stays her hand. “No, I don’t want my neurologist to interfere with my day to day life. If I need Strange for a medical issue, sure, but not my life. I can’t have him in my life all the time I can always tap Banner if I need to.”
Steve places his tablet to the side. “Okay, Nat, what aren’t you telling me?”
Instead of going back to the bed, he selects the couch. There’s a throw over the back that he uses as he lies lengthwise on it. He’ll entertain himself with his phone. He finds a text from Pepper.
Biology. The theories and ideas have been ingrained in him since he was a child. He understands the differences of the alpha caste, the beta caste, and the omega caste. He also comprehends the subsets. Being a Prime Alpha, like Tony is, happens to be rare and very much sought after, so much so that during the last century the Alpha Wars broke out and nearly decimated most of the human worlds. At the time genetics had been used to ensure alpha lineages and beta lineages as well as warrior omega and drone omega lineages. It is said that the drone omega had been created at that time. The warping the genetics of the caste system led to affects that couldn’t be predicted. So many of the alphas turned to insanity. Too many of the omegas ended up in berserker rages. When the dust settled only truly untouched Alphas were allowed, no genetic manipulation. Omegas had been divided into classes, while Betas were fine. Warriors took their place alongside alphas while drones went to the blocks.
When he came back to himself, Tony leaned against the side of the shower as the water still rained down, the words still on his lips. “Steve, Steve.” He murmured the name over and again. How could he be so screwed up? He didn’t even know the guy. They’d been apart for years. His soul didn’t bond with Tony. They didn’t resonate together. Steve found no place in his pack for Tony. Nothing.
“Ketchup.”
“It is not the best choice to remain separate as pack members. But since you are still forming, it may not be avoided at this time. Does your other pack member know how to control the bond?” The intelligence and wisdom in his eyes eased some of Steve’s trepidation.
“You’re lying.”
“I do?” Tony sat up from his lounging position. “I do.”
Bruce ran his hands through his hair and then grumbled, “You gotta give me something. Nat will kill me.”
“Oh, great, thanks,” Clint says and takes the whole load from Tony. There’s a pause before Clint asks, “Is he okay?”
“Do you want to leave?”
The kiss grows and while Steve has never told him kissing was off limits, he’d never welcomed it until now. Steve cups Tony’s head and they tumble over to the bed. But it isn’t Steve who takes command in the bed as he has in the past. Usually, he asks what Tony wants and gives what Tony needs. This time, it is Tony exploring and tasting and causing the shivering gasps. This time it is hot and sweet and lovely as Tony sucks Steve off as he feels the rise and shudder of Steve beneath him. This time Tony follows his heart’s desires.
“That’s good of her, of them,” Steve said. He should be out there, fighting the good fight. But what fight did he have left in him? He glanced down at his wrists. The memory of the shackles still haunted him. It had only been a day. How could a day take everything away? He shouldn’t ask that question. Steve was, after all, only human, regardless of what Shuri said. “I should have been there with them.”
“Heaven forbid, I do not.” He smiles and that’s the best part of the day. Tony always smiles at Steve in the morning. Always. Even if they’ve fought the night before – he smiles at Steve. Once a while ago, Steve had asked why and Tony simply said that as a scientist he understood what the north magnetic pole was, but when he hears Steve’s voice in the morning, he knows what true north really is. “You’re still thinking too loud.”
Staring at his phone, Tony considers his words. Usually he's just writes a date and time. Now he has to ask to change the time. Later. It should be easier; it's not that big of a deal. He grumbles and writes a quick note. He ends it with a sweet epithet and then pushes the phone back in his pocket. Heading up the stone steps to the DC brownstone, he tries not to wait for the chime that tells him Steve received, acknowledged, and agrees to his text.
The words disintegrate around him like embers from a fire – embers that spark and flicker until transforming into a conflagration, a full out war of pain and suffering. Yet, instead the embers – red and hot – blacken and die out. Tony shudders. “Is that what you have to tell me?”
Tony entered Steve’s room. It felt too small, tight, constricted. Maybe all the people gathered around his bed as if it was a death bed waiting for the end caused Tony to think about it that way. He shrugged his shoulders and wove his way to the bed, everyone parted for him. Bucky followed. Natasha shadowed him. Between the two, Tony perceived something frail, a broken thing they tried to mend yet may never be able. Bruce eased away from Natasha. She’d offered him strength when he needed it, but then had shifted over to Bucky.
He expects a large entourage, but once again he’s surprised by Tony. Rhodes and Potts with Happy trailing behind them walk down the ramp and search the bay. Only Steve’s identified Honor guards have been cleared to attend the ship. The guards will take care of all the duties, including maintenance or any other administrative issues.
“It’s not even a day and you look like you’re making yourself comfortable here,” Steve said and crossed the room to shake Bruce’s hand.
Sitting up, he shifts away from the man. “It’s okay. I’m okay.” He searches around – he’s in a cave lying on a cot. The blankets are torn and filthy, the cave looks like a cross between a mechanic’s garage and a prison. “Where?”
“Well, it did.”
Blu stands up, stretches, and then joins Tony near the fire. He’s cleaned up any of the blood from his face and paws. His head is not a foot from Tony. Being the impulsive person that he is, Tony reaches out his hand and lays it on Blu’s mane. The lion does nothing. A scratch near his ear and Blu rolls into the touch like he’s starved for it. He paws the air when Tony stops as if asking for more. Tony obliges trying not to think about just hours ago he was sure the beast before him wanted to eat him.
“What can I say, I sweat a lot. I didn’t want to ruin the tux. It isn’t mine.”
Steve laid his head back on the pile of pillows. Why hadn’t anyone told him about that? Why hadn’t he even considered it himself? It was exactly what happened when Tony attempted to force the bond – of course, Steve had thought it was due to the fact Tony and Steve were always adversaries. They were on the same side but always beating at each other. Their bond was not a given. But apparently it was.
