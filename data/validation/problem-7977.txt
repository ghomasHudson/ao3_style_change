He looked around eyes catching Steve's. They widened to dinner plates. "How long have you been here?" He asked.
"What caused all this hostility?" Bucky asked. Steve glanced up. His tunic hung low and he was having trouble with his vest. Steve started to stand to help but Bucky sent him a sharp look and he sat down.
“Things are sketch,” Clint said as delightfully blunt as usual.
Bucky was frozen. "They didn't touch you-"
Clint stood his stance wide and face bare. "I heard somethings that you would not have because my presence was not considered a threat. The Hammer and Stane pack had such low views of what an omega is that it would take a miracle for that man to have so many alphas in his pack that from what I suspect was blessed by the gods."
“Please. We need Bruce. You can be helpful again soon but we need Bruce.”
Tony laughed. “I haven’t seen someone with a normal watch in so long.”
“Of course, I participated, the little one with the glasses is absolutely brutal.” T’Challa continued pulling on his shirt for bed.
Mate now. Baby needs it.
"I am both sexually and intellectually interested in the man." Steve said. "I don't know why this is such a big deal."
Just like that Bruce fell crashing into his body again shivering and naked and covered in blood and gore.
Mr. Stark leaned in. "I could never play dumb, I'm much too intelligent, fair angel."
“Tony,” Steve gasped. Tony smiled and walked up to him. He kissed Steve his belly between them.
“A pack can be two omega’s Tony.”
Thor shrugged. “I always did love an after-battle partner.”
Natasha raised an eyebrow.
“I'm not pregnant and you don't want a baby,” Bruce said aloud.
Tony snapped his fingers. "Knew it."
“I shouldn’t have let him touch you.”
"They are always active. Do not worry yourself." Clint said waving away his concern. There was a familiar whine behind him.
In one breath and the next he was on all fours and running towards the scent of Tony. He had gotten far which wasn't a surprise. They were almost matched in speed and Steve drowned the omega in pure strength. Small bodies move faster.
"It was war. One that had passed but the scars remained."
“Clint you fucking idiot,” Bucky said and punched Stane in his shaved skull.
“We’ll get through this. What’s the worst that could happen?”
"On this I'm going to disagree with you," Thor said.
Tony leaned into Steve’s chest. “Warm angel.”
“Does it matter?”
Sam came to them first and Tony nearly ran head first into him unable to stop the tug in his chest and the direction in his soul. Sam stopped him with a hand on his shoulder and Natasha ran up shifting mid-step to stand next to her partner.
"The lovely Doctor Banner has rejected me." Thor said heavily. "I have sought to seek why and he has locked me out at every turn almost terrified. Of me? Or of something else," Thor flung the hammer far out into the woods holding out his hand as it rounded back to him. "I do not know."
Steve stiffened. “You left him after his heat?”
The three headed back to the warmth of the house and looked at and held babies. Tony for the first time in over a month finally slept in a bed.
Hands, grabbing him from behind, hostile by the grip. Tony yanked and turned, kneeing the dude in the gut, before stepping back. “Yeah, you take a minute…” Tony said as the guy clutched at his stomach before turning around and seeing Rhodey fending off against two others. Tony went to go help, but was grabbed once again, this time from his right. He went to go swing his left, intending to punch his attacker straight in the jaw, but it was snatched back before he could. He yanked and pulled, twisted and turned, but it was no use… these men were a lot stronger than Tony. They started dragging him away, towards the door Rhodey knocked off its hinges not even two minutes earlier.
Tony pouted. “Give him back.” He reached his arms out, looking like a kid waiting to be picked up.
His dad just walked away though, heading into the next room. Tony stared after him until he could no longer see him, then he took action; he ripped his bag off from the floor and ran out the front door, tugging on Flake’s collar to follow.
“What?” Clint asked.
“Tony!” Steve laughed as Tony inhaled his cup of coffee. “I was drinking that yanno.”
“It’s my day off, punk. What do you want?” Rhodey asked, closing the door.
Clint left the tent, leaving Steve and the prisoner alone for the time being. Steve took a seat on the cot and just watched, afraid that if he stopped looking, that wheezing chest would stop rising. It reminded him of when he was younger, always so sick. Reminded him of the countless attacks where his breath would disappear from his lungs and refuse to come back.
“You ready?” That was Rhodey. He placed a gentle hand against Tony’s back, not pressing, just there as a reminder that Tony wasn’t alone.
“You’re to watch him,” Clint said. Steve looked towards him and found him looking at their captive with sad eyes.
Tony sighed and said, “I know… I know, but I want to.” He looked back at the door. A whole life of seventeen years being told he couldn’t go outside because the temperature dropped below 40 degrees. A whole life of training inside while his knights continued to fight through the harsh conditions. When Tony was younger, he could remember his mom sneaking him to an open window, letting him taste the crisp cold air. She died when he was four, right after a pretty horrible miscarriage… some say she died of a broken heart, others speculate she drank herself to death. Tony? Tony just missed his mom.
“Shh!” Rhodey placed his hand over his mouth, ear straining against the wood of the door. Despite the fact that Tony had indeed shut up like Rhodey asked so politely, he kept his hand over Tony’s mouth. Tony was tempted to lick it, if only to get the knight to move his hand so he could fucking breathe properly again. He did just sprint after all, in the freezing cold no less, thank you very much, and he could feel his heart doing double time in his chest from the exertion. Before Tony could though, Rhodey pulled his hand back and then used his body to break down the door. Inside was eerily quiet and hey wasn’t there a woman in here screaming before–
A dog… of all things Steve wanted the a fucking dog. It couldn’t have been a hamster or even a friggin cat, but a dog… a long tongued, panting beast with muddy paws and sharp teeth and just... even thinking about it made Tony shudder. Truth is, Steve’s birthday was coming up and even though he never outright asked, it was obvious to know exactly what the super soldier wanted if the way he gushed,
“Yeah… I know.”
“It’s your birthday, Steve. You are officially off duty all day. Besides… I think I heard a little red head leave to go get your surprise.”
“How do we even know for sure that he wants a dog? Maybe he’s actually looking at them with malicious intent and we are misreading it.” Nat just gave him an arch eyebrow and kept walking. “Maybe…,” Tony went on, “maybe, maybe he uh... maybe he just feels bad for dogs! Yeah and he wants them to be free from owners. Who’s to say not all dogs want to be on their own in the first place. We never asked-”
When he reached the source of the sound, he pushed back snow covered branches of a small bush and underneath it laid a small puppy. The child gasped, picking up the shivering animal, its thick brown fur littered with specks of white. “Don’t worry… I’ll take care of you,” he assured, running his hand along the pup’s spine. The small thing wasn’t too skinny, and seemed to be alright, if not for the cold, which means he couldn’t have been out there for too long.
“Like what the prince might look like by chance?”
“W-what?” Clint stopped cleaning the arrow.
They took the northeast corridor, down a long winded hallway that led to a stone stairwell. One by one, they took each step down, until they came to a wooden door. Five more steps and Tony would be outside. He yearned for this moment, wanting to prove to himself that he could do it… be in the snow and not die like everyone just assumed he would, but as he stood in front of that door, he hesitated… His hands shook a little bit and in that moment Tony realized he was scared. If anything, that just made him more determined and, as he felt Rhodey’s hands touch his shoulder, he took a deep breath in. “I’m fine…”
For weeks, Tony was able to make it work. Flake was getting bigger as the days passed, but no one knew he was even hiding out in Tony’s room. There was a little area of cardboard and newspaper for flake to use as a bathroom and he knew not to bark. Jarvis had discovered the dog, but after some coercing from Tony, promised not to tell anyone. The Butler even bought the dog food and treats sometimes when Tony was unable to.
Tony didn’t resurface until the next day and only because it was Steve’s birthday and he very well couldn’t avoid the man all day. He took the elevator up to the communal floor, where he was sure everybody had just to begun to settle in for breakfast. As soon as the doors open, he could hear chatter and pots and pans being moved. Bruce must have just started making food.
“You’re right… I’m sorry.” Nat’s whole face soften and she smiled. He forced a smile back and turned away, resuming their journey.
Jarvis blinked. “I see,” he said. “Well lunch is ready and the table is all prepared. I made your favorite.”
His thoughts were interrupted when a hand reached for Tony’s, intertwining their fingers. “How about a name?” Steve asked, obviously trying to take the pressure off of Tony’s mind.
Tony frowned. “Of course I do… It’s just-”
So it was up to Rhodey. They’d have to wait until after sundown; too many people walked the castle halls during the day. It wouldn’t be the first time Tony has snuck out, so it shouldn’t be that difficult.
“Tones…” Rhodey shook his head. “Look at me.” When Tony didn’t listen, Rhodey pulled his shoulder back and turned him towards himself. He found nothing but blankness in Tony’s gaze. “We don’t have to do this yanno…”
“He’s not a knight Clint,” Steve interrupted before placing his palm against the man’s chest.
“Yeah, pressing as in he wants to press a knife through your back,” Tony muttered under his breath, twirling the blade absentmindedly, silver scraping against wood.
“I’ll do that, Bruce… you cooked.” Steve interjected, but Bruce just shook his head.
Tony spent the rest of the meeting staring at those large windows… maybe he could just sneak outside for just a minute, just long enough to be able to touch it. Rhodey could help him, if the honeybear just stopped worrying about him for two seconds. Pepper, on the other hand, would never agree. The servant could take Tony apart with two words, despite the fact that he was the Prince and technically in charge of her. He wouldn’t have it any other way though. No one could mess with Pepper.
“H-hurts,” he said.
Tony was right about one thing… he might as well be the only person Rhodey knows that has never got to touch snow with his boots, nevermind his hands. Sighing, and partly knowing he would probably regret this, Rhodey said, “Alright…”
“Tony, stop. You’re rambling.” She grabbed his shoulders and turned him around to face her. She tilted her head, studying his face, searching for god knows what. Tony swallowed, uncomfortable with the scrutiny.
Two weeks later, Howard walked into Tony’s room and dropped Flake’s collar onto his bed. “They didn’t want to burn the collar with his body. Figured you could keep it as a reminder for your transgression.” And then he just walked out, leaving Tony to stare at the leather band until the world turned blurry.
Until this moment, Flake had stayed silent, but as soon as he heard that noise leave Tony’s mouth, he growled, shifting Howard’s attention from his son to the dog. “And who is this? How long have you hidden this beast in my house?” He gripped tighter.
Steve stopped and lowered his arms. “Tony, what’s wrong?” Tony looked up, and just like that, he straighten his composure, lowered his arms and stopped the tears from flowing.
“He’s gonna love this you know,” she said.
“Okay,” Steve replied. It wasn’t anything new. Steve was usually tasked with watching the prisoners. He was good at getting people to cooperate and be complacent and since he couldn’t be trusted in the field, he was often tasked with guard watch.
“Clearly.” He pointed towards the bag next to Tony’s feet before getting up and moving closer. When he was right in front of him, he grabbed Tony’s arm and pulled him close to his face and said “Were you trying to run away from me, Tony?” His breath reeked of alcohol. Tony whimpered at the pain in his arm from his father’s harsh grip.
“Every person has eaten snow before and I refuse to be the only one in this universe unable to taste that white matter!” Tony flopped the rest of his body down onto Rhodey’s bed and crossed his arms. Rhodey smirked at the little pout adorning his friend’s face.
“I-I didn’t… I’m sorry. I know he yours-”
Tony had always liked the snow, but maybe it was because he was never allowed outside the castle when it was this cold; he had a heart condition since birth and the cold was just too hard for him to breathe in and harder to breathe meant more work for his pathetically weak heart which was a big no-no... and yet he couldn't help but wish to be outside in those white flakes. As he watched them fall, he wondered if they would stick or if the substance would be gone by morning, no evidence that it even visited the ground in the first place.
Without looking up Steve asked, “Do you want to hold him?”
Tony entered, going straight for the coffee pot to pour himself a sweet delicious cup, but when he picked it up it was empty. He turned around, glaring at the room at large that all got quiet the moment Tony grabbed the pot. They all had one… a cup of Tony’s coffee. And they left him nothing. That just wouldn’t do.
Steve backed away, hands raised. “I’m not here to hurt you,” Steve said. The prisoner kept pulling his body back, wincing when his wrists refused to give and scratched against his bindings. Steve was ready to step back and give the man some room when suddenly, the man grabbed his chest and pitched forward as far as the cuffs would allow him.
“F-Flake! Flake, stop it!” Tony screamed and ran forward, pulling him the mutt off of his dad. Rubbing a hand along his spine, Tony was able to calm down his best friend, but the damage had already been done.
“You won’t though,” Rhodey countered, smiling as Tony melded together a perfect sphere between his hands. Of course he would build the perfect snowball on his first try. “Why don’t we continue this somewhere the guards won’t catch us?” He called out.
“We didn’t! Tony technically did,” Clint piped in.
“A name? You don’t have one picked out already?” Tony asked in disbelief.
“As you can see we have a large collection, all just waiting for a new home. Many of our pets range in age, but of course, if you are looking for a puppy, they are just all the way in the back…”
“I would rather continue my education here,” Tony said.
“Tony, Tony… this isn’t just any boarding school. It’s one of the most prestigious schools in the world. Now what kind of a father would I be if I let you pass that up?” This was a test, one of Howard’s beautiful ways of making it seem like Tony could choose, but then taking away the choice at the same time. Tony knew this. Even at seven years old, he was aware that his dad liked to manipulate situations to his benefit and yet… all Tony ever wanted to do was make him proud.
“What?” He snapped. Her eyes widened at his harsh tone.
When Steve set the plate down in front of him, Tony just blinked at it. “Thanks…,” he mumbled, before scooping up some eggs and placing them into his mouth. He moaned at the burst of flavor. “You never fail, Brucie Bear.”
“No, it's okay.” He looked down, continuing to stroke the golden retriever before continuing. “I know you’re wondering.”
“Watch that mouth of yours or you’ll be in the stocks and out of this meeting.”
Steve and Clint’s clan liked to leave messages in the places they have hit, a love letter of sorts. It wasn’t too long ago they utilized the very tactic in a bid to start a war between kingdoms. Other times, the clan liked the kingdom to know they were coming. Steve always found it needlessly risky.
“W-what?”
Steve frowned. “That’s no excuse,” he said. “Tony, you were his son, but he treated you like a machine.”
---------
--------
“What were you doing in there?” Jarvis inquired.
“Shut up. Not another word, Anthony. You are going to that school, end of discussion.”
“Yeah, well… if I only I could get you to eat breakfast more often,” Bruce replied. He began stacking the dishes in the sink, preparing to wash them.
Tony nodded. “Yeah, probably a good idea.”
“I…” Tony didn’t know what to say. He looked down at the little creature in his lap, the small pup content just cuddled up on top of his legs. He never thought he would experience this again, always believe that if he let himself fall in love, surely it would be taken from him, like everything in his life.
He was running for two hours before they found him. Animal control took Flake away, ripped him from Tony’s arms as the child screamed. Later, they called the cops to escort Tony home. His dad never said a word.
Flake followed readily enough. They made it all the way to the front door before the lights turned on. “Anthony…”
Clint squinted. “You know the answer to that Steve.” The two continued to look at each other before Steve nodded.
When they walked into the clinic, all Tony could smell was dog, and it took everything he had not to run back out into the open air in that moment. A trainer took them back into a different room, one full of cages and many, many dogs.
“No,” the man gasped. “It’s my fucking heart.”
“What’d he do?” Steve asked.
Clint started dragging the young man towards the cuffs when Steve stopped, causing the archer to stumble forward a bit.
He was instructed to stay behind on this mission. For most of the night he waited in his tent for word of their return. Many groups of bandits had their own language of sorts for under the radar communication. It could be as simple as a specific bird call or as intricate as leaving a certain trail in the woods. So when he heard the whistle of a blue bird echoing through the air in the early morning, he exited the tent just in time to see the group enter the camp with a person slung over their backs.
Afterwards, Steve went into the kitchen to make them some sandwiches. He walked back to see Tony laying face up with the puppy on his stomach. It made Steve smile. Now he stood outside the room, just observing.
“Tony, I’m so sorry. I can’t believe he did that, any of it. Maybe if I was there, maybe-”
Later that night, the young boy was hastily shoving clothing in a bag while Flake whined in the corner, worried. “We’re getting out of here, Flake. Dad can’t send me to boarding school if he doesn’t have a son anymore.” He didn’t know where they would go but he would die before he was taken away from Flake. “Maybe we can go to Aunt Peggy’s. She never really got along with dad anyway.”
“Well I do, but it’s uh… well... “ Tony raised his eyebrow, waiting. “Sergeant. I was thinking about Sergeant,” he mumbled.
--------
“N-nothing.” Tony gulped before carrying on. “I was just putting my snow suit in there so it could be dried as soon as possible.” To really sell it, he pouted and mumbled, “I wanna go back outside later yanno… before Dad gets home.”
“Anything for the great war hero Captain America. Sir!” Clint mock saluted. Steve laughed and shook his head, but then took pity and did a mock salute back. Clint grinned, and then remembered, “Oh hey! I got something else for you too…” he ran off to retrieve the purple collar he bought and the team all doted on the new puppy while Tony hid in his lab, trying hard to keep past memories at bay.
“T-Tony?”
“I need you to leave, Steve.” Before the super soldier could respond, a resounding whimper could be heard and he followed the sound to see his dog crying out and pawing at Tony’s leg, obviously knowing something was wrong.
Steve actually walked into that sight now. There sat Tony at his desk, inspecting a hologram in front of him, hands underneath his chin, tongue peeking out. Steve smiled, and carefully sat on the ground, placing his new friend in his lap, content to just watch for awhile. Watching Tony work was like seeing a magician perform real magic: completely and utterly fascinating. The man tended to mutter under his breath and work in a flurry of motion. It was impossible to keep up with and yet, to be honest, there was nothing else Steve rather be spending his time doing.
Tony wasn’t able to return to Flake until later that night, after he was already put to bed. “Stupid Dad with his stupid tests,” he muttered as he walked in. Howard had returned from his trip early, and upon arriving, brought Tony down to the lab for some tasks. Flake was sound asleep, a puddle of pee next to his bed. Tony sighed before rushing to clean it. It wasn’t anything he wasn’t use to, to be honest. Dad had him clean his work messes all the time.
They proceeded outside the town, avoiding patrols as they went, and into a clearing right before the woods. For the next several minutes, they threw snowballs at each other, and Tony could feel his skin numbing from the liquid penetrating the thick fabric of his gloves. But besides that, Tony felt… he felt good. His head didn’t feel like it was about to explode or his heart about to rip open his chest. It was a little hard to breathe, don’t get him wrong, but he was alive and he felt fine. He could totally do this ‘outside-in-the-cold’ thing more often.
“Tony!” He yelled before his head was literally slammed against the floor.
“Tony?” Steve looked at him, waiting for a response.
“Other one?” Steve asked, confused.
Everything was fine until it wasn’t. Right after Tony turned seven, Howard got into an argument with Maria about sending their son off to boarding school. The fight had been massive, and in the end, Howard decided to ask their son what he thought.
--------
The pup just cocked his side to the side in response. “Flake it is.” At that moment, Jarvis called Tony from the kitchen once again. “Okay, you stay here Flake, I’ll be back soon.” Tony got up and went to go leave, but Flake just started following him. “Nooooo Flake,” He started as he picked up the dog. “You have to stay here.”
“Then why not do this? For him? He really wants one Tony, you know he does.” She had a point. Steve really did want a dog. It was like a little kid wanting his first pet, and in a lot of ways, Tony guessed it was. Who knows if Steve was allowed any pets growing up, with the way he was always sick. Why was he being like this? Was he really that self-centered that he wouldn’t let Steve get a dog?
“Tony!” Natasha yelled, flicking her fingers in front of his face.
Tony whipped around. “J-Jarvis!”
But over the last few months, Tony had really opened up to them. Steve loved every moment he learned something new about the man they called the Da Vinci of their time. Like the way Tony acted like there was no other existing coffee in the world besides black, but secretly loved flavored lattes. Or the way he would work for days on end and then seemingly fall asleep in the weirdest places at the most random times. Or the way he stuck out his tongue when he was deep in thought.
“Master Anthony! Lunch is finished!” A voice called from the porch.
“A year… you lied to me for a whole year?! ” Howard barked out, spit flying in Tony’s face.
“Alright? Really?” Tony sat up and tackled Rhodey in a hug. “Oh thank you Rhodey pal, you won’t regret it.”
“Dad! You’re hurting me.” Tears prickled in Tony’s eyes but Howard didn’t let go.
--------
--------
“Anthony… Anthony! Please pay attention to Sir Eustice. He has pressing matters he wishes to discuss,” the king, Howard Stark, said to his son who was currently fiddling with his knife.
It wasn’t until the fourth hour that the man finally twitched, moaning as his eyes slowly fluttered open. Steve moved forward to steady him.
Tony mumbled out what might have been a ‘mine’ in between his gulps. He cradled the cup to his chest and moved to sit at the counter next to Clint. They sat in reasonable silence for awhile, listening to the sound of eggs frying and pancakes sizzling. When it was time to eat, Steve made Tony’s plate, knowing the genius would try to pass of coffee as his breakfast like he always did. He made sure to fill the plate completely, aware Tony probably hadn’t eaten in awhile.
“S-stop it,” Tony forced out between giggles as the puppy licked his face. He pushed him off before picking him up and grabbing a clean blanket from the laundry basket. “We gotta be quiet or we’ll get caught. Dad doesn’t like animals... Says they’re too messy.” He traveled over to corner, right next to the door.
“A captain and his Sergeant.” Tony smiled. “I like it.”
“Dad, please,” Tony whispered, too terrified to even more. His dad always drank, but it wasn’t often he got this angry, this so out of control. His words didn’t defuse Howard at all though, just seemed to make him more pissed off and the next moment Tony knew, Howard’s hand was heading for the side of his face.
“If only…” Tony whispered. He placed his hands on the table and rested his chin against them. They were in the throne room, the heart of the castle. On the right side of room, portraits adorned the wall of every King to ever rule, the last being of course, Tony’s father Howard. On the left side though, featured a row of windows, high enough to let the light from the sun filter in and shine upon those portraits. Right now there was no sun though and Tony watched as the first trickle of snowflakes descended towards the ground.
When they entered the house, Tony quickly kicked off his boots and tiptoed to the laundry room, sneaking past the entrance to the kitchen which contained Jarvis, who was humming as he prepared the table.
“What happened?” Natasha asked. “You’re following us.”
Tony set down the piece of scrap metal he as going to use to fill in the holes in Dummy’s base. “They will understand. We could use your help, old friend.”
Tony wrinkled his nose and looked over Tommy’s shoulder to see if he could see any of his cohorts. Tommy’s hand snaked surprisingly around his throat and forced him to make eye contact.
“We got fucked and left in the dust,” Sam said straightforward.
“So, you have told me.” Bucky said.
"Where would the others fall in should we," Steve pursed his lips. "Merge."
"What's gotten you all worked up, my friend?" Tony said setting aside his glasses and screwdriver.
“It’s disgusting.” She said. “The information please?”
“How,” Clint kicked and Cross grunted, “was. I. Supposed. To. Know.” Clint finished each word with a boot.
Steve’s eyes scanned the area and found two bodies strewn across the ground.
Steve had called T’Challa who was already turning on the lights for him. He tried to keep track of the chaos, but someone had punched him awkwardly in the side. Steve caught the next fist and threw it away. It was moments. Maybe. Maybe longer. But the lights flickered on and Steve found himself in the middle of an all-out brawl. He hopped over students pushing his way through. He couldn’t see Tony. What the fuck happened? He reached the stage and met with Sam and Thor. Bucky was held close to Clint with a bloody nose. No sign of Tony. Shit. The image of Tony holding a hand covered in blood to his face and looking mildly disappointed by the whole in his abdomen.
Bruce hummed and the two fell silent. The tinkling of the water over stones and the hush of the steamer being filled.
"Are you a scientist?" He asked stuffing cheese in his mouth.
"The penny bag is where you left it. It should be not a problem, sir."
“Lee.”
"I thought..." Bruce started looking helpless.
Sam pulled out his phone. “Haven’t heard of that one. I’ll add it to my list. Have you read
Clint continued walking flicking on his jacket over his unbuttoned shirt. Bucky grabbed his arm.
“Is it all gone?” Clint asked. They had painted and set up a nursery it was all…
Steve scratched his head. “We were headed to the coast anyway. This is just a new direction.”
“What name did you give him?” Steve asked.
“You—” Clint hissed.
Bucky's mouth twisted, and he seemed to think long and hard before what he said next. "Are you well?" He didn't move from his spot in the corner.
Thor picked him up gently. “Let’s clean your wounds first, fierce warrior.”
“I want to vomit. Sam, the information?”
Steve and the two other prefects sat on one end of the room and Tony’s two best friends and the one who has been written out of his will sat on his bed.
“To my pack, Obie.” Tony said. Bruce sat back on his heels and Tony stood up. “To my pack.”
“What?” Sam answered.
Clint pulled Bucky in by his neck and kissed him. “I’m very good at my job.”
“What about your potential offspring?”
"I would too, if he'd stop trying to kill me." Bucky said around the finger he stuffed in his mouth.
Bucky came to stand behind him leaning to whisper in his ear. “I’ll do your chores for the next week.”
“It’s going to rain soon,” Bruce said, “Odd for him to leave in such a rush.”
Steve pinched his nose. “You would say that.”
Bruce awoke a scream clutched in his chest. He sat up in bed and wiped off the blood. So much. They touched when he said no. More blood, a small coyote covered in blood and viscera and… it won’t come off. It won’t come off, her head, where did it go? He can’t remember. She wouldn’t stop screaming. Men. Disgusting alphas. It will not go away. Bruce scratched and scratched struggling until two large hands held him down. He gritted his teeth eyes closed until Thor’s familiar musky scent filled his senses and he felt that itch from before died down. His body went limp and Thor let go gently wiping tears off his face.
Tony took a step back. Something struck him. He touched his abdomen. It was slick.
Mr. Stark let out a derogatory chuckle. "I have been mated before, and because of my status you could mate me again against my wishes. Try again, stubborn angel.”
Steve growled. “Fine, Corporal Romanov, we leave at dawn.” Steve stomped off the porch ripping off clothes until he was free. The ground gave beneath him and he ran. He continued to run until he was out of breath then he ran back. He was focused on the movement of his body and what he could control.
"Will we inform, Captain Rodgers?" Sam asked Natasha. She looked to Tony for the answer.
“Sam’s near,” he said not opening his eyes.
"Here, here!"
Bruce awoke to babies squalling. He groaned flipping his pillow over his head. He'd been extra exhausted recently and Clint's children weren't helping his failing sleep cycle or constant nausea. He'd almost vomited for the first time in his career as a doctor when he found a solid cloth outside their room. He was known for his strength in stomach but this was just too much. Everything felt like too much. He was also getting migraines and the monster was more talkative and, and, Thor would not give him space. Even now while Bruce tried to smother himself in a pillow the man was wrapped completely around him. Bruce was too hot. He began to cry. That was the lost straw he got out of bed and Thor whimpered then rolled over in Bruces vacated spot. Bruce wasn't concerned he would wake up. The man slept like the dead. Bruce padded out to the living room and found a cloak that was Sam’s and stuffed his feet into boots then braved the great outside for the workshop where Tony had returned to. He switched where he was sleeping but he still spent most of his time with Dummy and the kiln.
"So, your leader," The Captain started. Clint felt his defenses rise. Tony was good to them and Clint actually liked their crazy little crew entirely endeared by their need for pack.
"You're staring at him," Tony said smacking away his hand. He turned to Clint ignoring the other pack. "Where's my automatons?"
“Yeah, he wants to be a detective.” Clint said. “He thinks the puppies are cute.”
"So, you were looking for me?" Clint said resuming scrubbing.
Something chipped away at Mr. Starks smug demeanor and he blushed slightly.
Tony snickered. “Ah, yes the Wilsons will be our strong alphas in these trying times. Who's going to fuck who first?”
“I want them back.” His words rasped against the air.
Stane’s expression didn’t change facsimile smirk crinkling his eyes. “I guess your right. I should leave you one more night to say goodbye to your friends.”
"My pack are good people, Bucks." Clint sighed.
"How are you Doctor Banner?"
“Not exactly. A prefect raid that Tony get’s lost in the middle of,” Bruce said.
Clint smiled and tangled their fingers together over his knees. “Thanks.”
Bruce stood and checked the soup stirring it. “Clint is right, they are possibly false pangs. Where are they coming from?”
“There’s something wrong.”
Clint bit his lip excited. “Oh?”
He grabbed a broken pocket watch from the side of the table and pulled out his little pack of tools with it. He walked into the main house through the door in the kitchen. It was best to face the music now rather than later.
Tony smiled patting Jarvis' leg. "Thank you."
Bucky pushed closer, so he could whisper in his ear. “It would be at the bottom of your pack, pidurok.”
Tony leaned back falling to his elbows. “I only kiss men who I’m on a first name basis with.”
One problem at a time. He ran in the direction of bent trees and heavy tracks and claw marks. Steve’s voice calling out after him.
Steve awoke alone and cold on a mildew covered field. He was tired and felt his bones shift uncomfortably meaning he was man once again, his companion long gone. Of course.
“I plan to destroy you.” Clint said picking up his quiver and bow.
Tony laughed. “Right.”
“Shit,” Bruce hissed.
"What?" He whispered.
The air was dank and heavy around the basement. The smell of sweat and the harsh iron tang of blood covered every inch of every body in the place. Tony wove through the crowd knowing that the fight currently happening center court was a done deal. Bruce was an unstoppable god when given the chance. He was picking up cash for bets, cash for who wanted to fight next. It was part of the deal. There was a lot of pent up toxic rage that the School of Superior Boys created and here was where Tony let them get it out. It was also where he got the change for paying for his fighter’s scholarships and future college funds. Most were scholarship students without much brains but they didn’t want to leave. Home was worst than this hell hole given the chance. The fighting ring started as an accident. A boy decided that Natasha was just faking it to get some D and she challenged him. Tony gathered a crowd and now he had his own basement. The staff occasionally joined. Mostly collegiate TA’s and groundskeeper’s sons.
Clint snapped his fingers and pointed at him. “Exactly.”
The pack ran together shifted, rarely ever changing back unless to stop Tony's guileless trail. They had run for three days and were exhausted but Tony seemed unable to stop until he collapsed. Steve often had to hold him just to get food in his mouth. His eyes never lost their glossy shimmer. The one that came over when they hunted for Natasha and Sam was not nearly as strong as this one. Steve could not believe that Tony had even connected to his pack well enough to follow them. He believed it might have had something to do with gods. Thor carried Bruce on his back the shorter man very solemn in their quest. Otherwise they moved as a unit preparing for battle. Natasha and Sam nightly kept their shifted weapons up to par and Thor never lost the faint smell of rain ready to unleash his lightning when ready. Steve was ready also. He had no weapons but that was par for the course. Tony was the only outlier. Eyes glossed and unseeing, he was gone. A ghost of a man.
“I do too.” She said returning her gaze neutrally to the book.
"No, he wouldn't do that. He was trying to be nice."
“They’re here.”
Bucky sat up and looked away from Clint. “Is that why you asked me out here?”
“Sit down, kids. I guess were going to have to have a conversation.”
Tony shrugged. "Let's head to town, wash the blood from our bodies and talk about, your other half."
Good bye, Sir.
"Well," Tony said handing the water jug to Jarvis. The metal man took it and ticked and tocked his was back around the cart. "We hardly know each other. It's been less than 24 hours. Let's not rush into hasty conclusions alright?"
"Courtship."
"Huh." Clint said processing.
"Love," Bucky said as soon as he stopped moving, "as much as I know you like playing with my cock, if we don't get this going proper I'll have to take control and you would not like that."
"Yes, Mr. Stark." Clint said walking back the way Tony came. The other pack followed him the white wolf edging in close. The shifted alpha stayed.
“We are all doing this for you the least you can do is pay attention.” Steve snapped.
"Just like that?"
“I’ll give you a hint if you drop the topic.”
“911.” Steve said shrugging off his jacket and putting over Tony’s bullet wound.
Tony kicked Steve to get his eyes on him.
“Sorry, Bruce. I’m stealing Thor.” Tony said loudly startling the entire room. Clint’s eyebrows shot to his head and he turned just in time to catch Bucky walking in on the other side of Bruce. Thor had been ruining their perfectly good grass by bringing lightning from the sky then Tony asked him to stop wrote something in charcoal on his skin and went insane.
"Along with the nuts, eggs, bacon and pears?" Bucky asked tone dry and expression soft.
Steve pulled Mr. Stark in close by his hand so there was not even a breath of space between them. "Then I'll have to woo you into giving such a thing up, won’t I."
"Because I am indebted to you for offering me use of your pack." Tony said slyly. "Warm thighs and tight comfort are in your future."
“Yeah, but…”
“It was a gut reaction.”
“Fancy meeting you here.”
“Would you like to take this somewhere else?” Steve asked already walking to the stair case.
Tony shrugged it off. "Irrelevant at the moment. What matters now is that I've have started my own pack of scientists and we can leave this dreadful place."
"You speak truth," Thor grumbled getting up. "Please, do impregnate Lord Stark. I would hate to see my time with Doctor Banner cut short if this does not go well."
“Whatever for?” Bucky asked continuing to rub Clint’s feet. Clint put down the book he’d been reading on his chest curious.
"I sleep where there is a bed," Thor rumbled throwing a leg over Bruce and pulling him in like one large pillow.
“You’re toy is very possessive.” Stane said.
Tonys eyes closed and he nodded weakly. “Let's go find a tree for his coffin.”
Steve rolled his eyes at his second. “That too but do you want me and Natasha and Sam in jail, James Buchanan Barne?”
Thor was looking at him but Bruce for the life of him could not meet his eyes.
“Silly devil, that’s what my pack is here for. We, together, under your command will fix it.” Steve reassured.
Bucky stared at the arrow standing straight in the perfect center of the circle. He scratched his chin standing back to look at Clint. The other man just continued to stretch his shoulders and arms and back and legs and now he was bent near in half showing off how round and plump his ass was now. Bucky swallowed walking up. He didn’t know how he still had energy now. They’d been at it for nearly two hours and yet Clint looked ready to go another three despite his heavy globe of a stomach.
Sam nodded. “Thank you, Tony.”
Steve gave him a small wave then closed the door behind him. Tony fell back onto the bed and flung an arm over his eyes.
“Oo,” Tony hummed. “I am titillated”
“If I had a taste, I fear I may go mad if I never had a sip again. But, perhaps, you are projecting your own needs upon me.”
"How are you?" Steve asked compelled to solve a problem with his unit to make them work more efficiently. It was that thought that struck him like a cord that he was missing nearly half his his pack. It had been days and he missed them. Steve closed his eyes and swallowed down the feelings. Soldiers were lost everyday he could wait a few days for his pack to get back.
“You’re kidnapping me!” Tony giggled.
“You didn’t come over until money was involved, Clint didn’t even know my name until I told him he could beat the shit out of Conner and make money off of it, and me and Natasha have been roommates for four years and she didn’t actually interact with me until after that first fight.” Tony hid his face behind his legs. “I didn’t want my friends to leave.”
“I’ll see what has made those hideous sounds.”
"Are you planning to leave us, Mr. Barton?"
“What. The. Fuck.”
Steve smiled at his work. “He hasn’t hit me.”
Jarvis served them the broth and the night was spent in laughter and warmth.
Steve shifted standing naked with Tonys two children. “Hi.”
.” Tony groaned. They were going to have to talk to some prefects.
"Jarvis!" He called looking about wildly.
Steve looked up thinking. “I left for war when I was fifteen and learned very quickly not to be fooled. Men are dead, and you’re left in their wake when that happens. So, as it stands the last time someone fooled me Lieutenant Barnes lost his arm.” Tony exhaled sharply at that and Steve’s eyes met his with a small smile. “Then you come in and within a day you’ve retained my pack’s respect and you fooled me with childish malice. You’re smart and lively and you lead your pack with affection and compassion, something I haven’t seen a long time. You impress me.”
Steve waved it off. “Doesn’t matter. How close is he?”
“Hey,” he said sliding in across from her.
“Yes.”
"That is unwise, sir." Jarvis replies his metal head turning towards Tony. His voice echoes for a fraction of a second making his already odd form even more unearthly. Tony stared at the small slits in the metal, then threw a piece of his toast at the other man. Jarvis let out a sigh and went back to kicking his legs. Tony had once implied that Jarvis liked the sound of his knees clacking with movement and Jarvis had scoffed at the idea of ever being so childish.
Bucky grinned leaning over him. “That it did. That I did. You my little idiot did not read the note.”
“Why don’t we try one more time?” Thor said pressing kisses along his jaw.
“You have us,” Natasha said.
Thor looked pink about the ears and opened his mouth to possibly counter when Bruce’s fist slapped the table. Thor and Steve scooted back defensively.
“You’re made from his blood.” Steve said letting Dummy drag him.
Steve’s hands paused.
Now Tony felt guilty. Great. He put his head on Clint's shoulder and patted Clint more throughly. “Poor baby.”
"If you'll excuse me I have to take a leak before I ruin these pants." Clint said taking off in the opposite direction. He heard Bucky follow him and just undid his pants his back towards the tavern and sweet release opposite.
“Then that means…” Clint said. “Not him, Tony. He’s…”
“I know!”
“So, Captain.” Tony said drawing out the words. “Why have you decided that I was the omega to capture your affections? From my understanding you hate me.”
"Perform it again and I might remember it."
“Are you alright, Bruce?”
AO3 ate all my bold and italic prints I didn't notice until a chapter ago....I'm very sorry to all of those who are reading this editing nightmare.
“I know.” Tony said. “I wanted to.”
Clint hid low in the brush. Shadows covered the forest floor but not quite covering his prey. Clint’s muscles bunched. Bucky loved rabbit. Clint sat abruptly his rump hitting the grass loud enough to startle the rabbit away. Clint barked at it the best he could even when it was long gone. Fuck. Clint rubbed his nose with a paw. Tree branches cracking, and grass rustling. Clint’s ears perked and tracked the noise. His head turned northwards, and he caught sight of bright white fur stumbling through the forest. Clint scooted back quickly and watched Bucky clumsily shift back to two legs and roll through the spot he just was and into a tree. He let out a string filth that was so impressive Clint would be charmed if he wasn’t so mad.
"A very sonorous itch," Tony added. "Will the itch come back?"
A familiar set of red riding shoes walked between Dummy’s sock and his rock. “That may have been the ugliest I’ve ever seen you get, Clint.” Natasha said her voice droll.
"I suppose it does."
Tony clicked his tongue and was surprised when Steve pulled out a chair for him. "Oh, there's fun, just the small amount that you haven't stolen from me," Tony said sitting down. Steve pushes the chair in for him bending forward in the movement so that his lips brushed Tony's jaw.
“Gained your respect, then?”
“Margaret Anne and Natalia Grace, if they’re girls,” Clint said rubbing his belly thoughtfully, “Thomas Anthony and Steven Jamison, if they’re boys.”
"That he did. God bless his soul."
Tony”s shoulders slumped and the earth quake stopped. The pack did not stop their distressed howling. Steve stood and gathered the strength to pull Tony around to face him and away from the fire. His body was flushed a deep red and another scream was clearly building in his throat. His eyes saw nothing. Steve clasped his face shaking him slightly so he would look at him. He did. The horror drained and his face crumpled like a dam overflowing with weather the bricks and mortar cracking and crumbling until there was nothing but the flood. Steve pulled him in so tightly he might have feared hurting him if Tony had not pulled him closer.
“No? I’m not allowed to be here with you for the rest of your quickening?”
Sam was grinning toothily. “Of course.” He handed his phone over.
“The Father to me.” Bruce said.
Thor’s uproarious laugh broke the tension and dinner continued as frivolously as usual.
Clint shrugged. “I was going to say yes either way. I’ve been on my own for only a month and I’m going right mad about it.”
Steve stretched out his joints. He hadn't shifted in nearly a week and he needed to warm into the change.
Tony snorted. “We agree on one thing then.”
The room turned to him.
Thor wrapped around Bruce surprising him. There was barely any room for them in the stable and a significantly less space while Thor was shifted. Bruce was itchy and gross. He wanted Tony’s baths, but they were probably gone. Thor nuzzled him. The pack had fallen into an uneasy sleep. Steve was awake eyes unnecessarily vigilant. What? Had his other half not killed enough of the other pack?
“Or,” Tony said leaning in close, lips pink and eyes mischievous, “you want a taste before it’s gone.”
Steve sighed and stood with Tony who pulled him far enough away from the fire that they could shift into their animal skin comfortably. Tony laid down first and Steve circled him before curling around him so that he may rest his head across Tony’s neck. Jarvis and Dummy were still held tightly in the bag Tony never set down and happened to be seated between the two of them. Steve hadn’t planned to actually sleep but the sounds of Jarvis’ ticks and the faint whir of Dummy’s claw lulled him into a kind of security he had not felt in quite some time.
Steve led him outside and towards the river. “It’s part of you.”
"That too."
“I need paints.” Steve put down his charcoal drawing of Tony sleeping. “I’m getting frustrated.” Not being able to light his hair or get the orange hues of the smelting pit or the light blue that seems to glow from Jarvis on occasion.
“Stopping Fight Club won’t stop them.” Clint said. “They already have what they need.”
The taverns common area was crowded, noisy, and restless. It took near a century to wave down a bar maiden and get his orders to the kitchen. It was in the millennium of waiting for his food to get to the table that he felt a hand slide up his thigh. Tony saw red and flicked his wristlet unbuckling it so it could transform into a gun. He pointed it at the other man’s crotch. "I would advise you to remove your hand, sir." Tony said pressing the barrel into the man’s groin. The man moved his hand quickly but did not get up. Tony eyed him then jerked back in surprise.
“I’m not that young.”
“Thor has a hammer when I get in one of my moods. You have an impossible task when you have one of yours.” Tony took another bite of food trying to hide his smile.
Bruce pushed his plate away. "I am."
Tony saw his tavern from the edge of the woods and heaved a great big sigh. He set off at a light jog before stopping. The alpha pack was there. In his place. He couldn’t… He sat down heavily on the ground releasing Jarvis and Dummy from his death grip hold. Dummy clung to him petulantly pinching the skin of his calf and Jarvis tested his joints.
“But—”
“Metaphors go right over his pretty little head.” Tony said. He placed Bruce’s food on the night stand. Bruce listed sleepily side to side.
“Nothing.” Tony petulantly ran a hand through his mess of a hair and reached across the bed for his shirt.
Bucky opened his mouth his one hand waggling a pointer finger. “Only Clint could be so heavily fertile and leave the bed without a sound.”
Tony spread his arms out. “Where? Running constantly? What kind of life is that?”
“Hammer may be dead but it is your legal name until you produce an heir to the Stark enterprises.” Stane said his pen stopping its journey across the paper only to fall in an inkwell. Tony dropped to his knees at that moment and started to pull the nails out of Dummy with trembling fingers. He had to swallow down bile. They tore off his wheels. There was the scrape of wood against dirt as Stane stood up. He stepped around his desk watching as Tony, pulled the first nail out his fingernails bleeding.
"I do regret that, Clint."
“You are both a brilliant scientist and a hellish warrior, that’s a win from where I’m from. We’ll raise ferocious children.”
“Approximately thirty, before they left for you.” Natasha said.
"Fantastic!" Clint complimented holding on to an edge to get a better look. Bruce paled.
“I see,” Thor said quietly.
“Tony said we needed enough for both university and dorms and food and rent if we didn’t live in dorms,” Clint explained pointing to fingers. “Also cars because for some reason he thinks we’re staying in California.”
Bucky undid the top looked in and pulled out a thick folded piece of paper. He handed it to Clint.
He needed to be a spy right now but the sun was warm and being away from home and teachers was so right. He must have stiffened up somewhat because Bucky pushed up onto his elbows. “What's wrong?”
Go back!
“What?” Bucky said finally catching onto what Clint’s plan was. “Hey!” Clint leaned back. “No!” Clint threw the stick.
Tony smiled ducking his head bashfully. “I do love him quite dearly but,” he looked up under his lashes. “If it’ll get me the house.”
“He wasn’t drafted.”
“Why—”
Steve sat on the front porch his knees pulled up to his chest staring at the road. No one had passed in the hours since he decided to sit there. A familiar figure pulled up next to him and laid down staring at the covering for the porch. They sat in silence.
Clint sat atop Bucky whose cock sat heavily inside him. He wiggled and clenched and raised himself up a couple of times to thrust himself back down. His lovers’ cock was possibly the very best. He does not think he'd ever want another's. He stopped his ministrations. Clint wasn't going to be with anyone else and why should he. Bucky was a reticent asshole and would prostrate himself if it meant Clint would speak to him. That right there is true companionship.
Tony shrugged. "He was a bit of a bastard." Then he gestured for Bruce to open up.
“You can’t stand up with out staring at the floor for four minutes to stop yourself from vomiting.” Natasha intoned. She leaned back against her bed post.
“Sorry.”
The sanctuary was very flowery and moved once a week to another town trying to sell off omega’s to the highest bidder. Tony was previously mated and used material wasn’t sold so he was relatively safe stealing from their ‘charity.’ Three weeks of being with the despicable humans did Tony finally leave and find himself a boarding house that accepted lone omega’s. It was there that he finally found himself with the prospect of creating a pack.
“Your welcome,” Tony said and continued with his food. “Now then, got any good spoils of war Captain and your Highness?”
She got up. “I’m gonna go get dinner, want anything?”
Clint woke up. His lungs hurt and his back hurt and his head hurt but he woke up prying his eyes open. He was wet. And cold. The patter of rain clouded his vision.
Steve pinched his nose. "I guess not. Then not only will we be mated, and I have bedded you, you will be with my child by the time Clint gives birth."
Bruce’s hands were in his hair and he was pulling hard. “What?!”
"Bruce P--," he stumbled. "Banner.” The packless rarely carry a second name.
Bruce paled.
Natasha set down her book and tucked a strand of hair behind her ear. “Yeah. I prefer how haunting
Thor pulled him out of the river and gently led him to the back door of the singed and blackened house.
“Do you have anymore medicine?” Bruce asked right next to his ear in a whisper. Tony blinked and shook his head.
"Except Captain's," Clint said pulling away.
The wolf growled but sat. The second largest of the bunch shifted and Tony refused to step back as an angel approached him. May the Father have mercy. Shifters have died to reach that level of perfection.
Bucky noses his neck just so. "All I'll ever need." He answered.
Bucky’s shoulders shook in his silent laughter. “Of course, I’ll be your boyfriend.”
“Well, yeah but it’s getting better.”
“That doesn’t mean we still don’t have six more months of this hell to go.”
"They make movements in hopes of a reaction and not as a reaction. They plan out what they are going to do and seem to be as human as you and I."
Steve crouched down onto the grass and placed his head in his hands and found tears. There were four but now there’s two.
“I’m not,” Bruce gritted out. There was that smile against his skin again.
“Are you in need of help?”
Steve pulled away the cloth that Bruce had wrapped around Tony’s neck and wetted it. “I have tried to do so and watched my friends and comrades die behind me. I could never ask you to do the same.”
Thor looked around before gently asking Bruce, “Do you have any mead?”
Tony whistled. “You’re telling me.”
Tony wiggled a bit and fell out of the window and hit the ground. “It seems I have made it.” Tony called.
"A doctor." Bruce finished.
Bruce followed him when he pulled away leaning his head on his shoulder and feeling his eyes close relaxing into the soothing timber of Thor’s voice.
Steve punched him. It was automatic. He was moving before he could think, like when he saw Stane’s teeth finally release Tony. He could go. Fight.
"That is a kind offer, sweet devil, but I am in the process of courting you properly." Steve picked him up and sat him on the bed.
Tony threw up his hands. “I am doing my best. I cannot stop you. Clint is the happiest I’ve seen him in a long time and also the saddest. I don’t know what to do with this but it’s better to give you my approval no matter how it pains me.”
“I’d fix the bets by placing my monthly allowances on the opponents.” Tony said. “It blew up way to fast and we had reached our goal right around the time…” Tony couldn’t finish it. None of these people would talk to him again. He liked them. They only stayed with him because he was paying them. That’s the reason anyone’s stayed.
Natasha was walking the pathway to the cafeteria when Sam Wilson waved to her from a table outside. She looked up and nodded but didn’t stop. Sam instead stood up and walked with her inside.
“Sea turtle?”
"Either way, my dear, please get in. Jarvis will drive, and I'll lead." Tony said gesturing into the cart.
Sam pulled Steve into a hug. “Of course, Captain.”
Steve placed his hands on his hips. "You will be my mate, feral devil."
Steve squeezed him. “Beautiful.”
“Amen.” Tony said taking a bite of the pie.
Bucky fell off the counter and onto his feet gracefully. “Let us come to my room.” He offered holding out a hand. Clint rounded the corner and took it.
The other man nodded. “Is that all, Mr. Stark.”
“Come on, just look at me.”
“Ive missed you, frightful devil.” Steve said stepping further in slowly.
“Cross,” Clint said.
“With you? Yes.”
Bruce’s palms stung and he was seeing red. Something smacked against the side of his head. His fists went to the first flash of person he could see, and he punched and punched until something hit his back.
Bucky took it and let Clint pull him onto the branch. Once he was settled it appeared that Bucky was going to talk something he hadn’t been very inclined to do before.
“I win.”
There was a smile in Bruce's voice. "That we are."
Bruce scooped out some of the stew into two bowls and placed them on a tray. He gently placed two peaches next to them. He placed the tray on the table careful of spilling. Then he slammed his hand down shaking the table and startling the good captain.
Natasha clenched her fist then brought it down between her crossed knees. “But if let’s say a famous technology billionaires son is hear to be at school run raids following an under ground fighting ring, is hospitalized then taken by choose-your-minority-terrorists said billionaire is going to pay not only to get his son back but to save his public image because that son is now tied to terrorists militia groups.”
Steve scratched his head. “I prefer democracy in it’s purer form.”
Bucky kissed his head. “Take as long as you need.”
Clint pointed at Tony. “That man is the best weapon master on this continent. He takes your blood makes you a weapon made for you, that works only for you, and you work better for it. Give him a vile of your blood and you’ll have a weapon that will work a lifetime and never need a readjustment.”
“You're welcome, selfish angel.”
“Really? We mated this morn.”
"I feel as though my clockwork is running out."
"Shh... none of that. Alphas, betas, muddle things up. Let us be this pack. I watch your back and you watch mine."
“Me too, buddy,” Clint said.
The angel leaned down and shadows obscured his face. “I have read that devils tend to work below and are usually naked.”
Steve picked up the pace and heard rustling in the trees and the sound of Bucky yelling.  Steve stopped and listened. There was a thwack followed by several curses. Steve ran in that direction and found a kid holding his head.
"I am a doctor, no scientist I ensure you. But you’re right about the automaton. It's very..." The omega stared at Jarvis who watched back his slotted eyes showing nothing. "Life like."
“I’m here. What else could you possibly want?”
“I do too.” Steve said. He meant it. He missed their presence the entire world echoed wrongly with out the sounds of metal on metal.
“Is she…” Steve swallowed. His throat closed up and he was unable to finish the question.
“I’m selling myself.” Clint leaned in to kiss Bucky.
"It was--"
The angel looked away. “It is in bad taste to do so.”
Tony almost dropped his book on robotics. “You were looking for me?”
Bucky shrugged. “I know. I only know they happen on Sunday’s. Today we got a text saying there would be some kind of bidding war on the first.”
"Just two, thank the heavens. If there were any more I fear what the lack of mobility would do to me," Clint huffed. It was just a short walk, they were maybe a mile away at this point, but Clint was already out of breath.
“Library. I’m bored.”
Bucky glared at him. “I accept then.”
“Hey,” he said nosing Clint’s neck.
Bruce waved him off. “It was nothing compared to…”
“I beg your pardon?”
Tony tapped his fingers against the table. "This alpha wouldn't happen to be the same alpha that Miss Romanov was involved with would it?"
“What’s wrong?”
“Kidnapping?” Steve asked.
“Wait for them to make their move.” Steve answered. Bruce looked green once again. Steve thought it was nausea. He patted his shoulder.
Tony nodded and laid down sideways on the bed eyes still open and blood still staining his shirt. He closed his eyes.
"Good." Tony sighed and grabbed his clothes. "We'll talk later on how we'll go about this. He's yours Doctor Banner while I take a shower and finish the room we were working on."
“Good to see you,” Bruce said a few moments later then headed to the kitchen calling over his shoulder, “I made those cinnamon bread rolls you like, let me get you some.”
Clint rolled his neck opening it up. "Yes. You're it. Me, you, and the babes in my belly. That's all we need."
“Where’d you get the omega?”
"Of course, Mr. Stark." Bruce replied suspiciously.
Tony closed his eyes and let the pain overtake him.
Clint shrugged. “We don’t need to be trustfund kids, Tony.”
“Nausea?”
“It’s a quick read.” Natasha agreed walking back to the dorms. Sam kept pace with her. She was surprised by his patience. She wasn’t as reticent over text.
"I murdered my alpha and that is why I left. It is also why a Mister Bruce Banner my 'alpha' owns this property. If Tony Stark did my alphas’ pack might find me." Tony said.
“Are you okay?”
The pack looked up and Clint snored clearly exhausted from the birthing.
Bruce froze and debated his options. “Uh…”
The pain was too much but the source clear as day. Tony. Steve struggled to the door when it suddenly stopped. The silence was almost as unbearable as the scream. The tidal wave of grief. He began to run. He was afraid what would happen if Tony unintentionally brought the house down upon their heads. Did he not know his runes and blood and magic seeped into the very foundation? Steve made it into the foyer when Tony screamed again.
"My quiver?"
Steve snorted. “Believe it or not, little devil, they are your pack and they do know how to read you.”
“That’s what happened?” Steve asked.
Steve nodded and gestured for them to follow. Tony got up last and was stopped by Clint.
"Yes, sir. Would you like anything else?"
Steve was ready to be home. He had money, their pack would be safe to become fat and happy and he missed Tony. He missed the smell of iron and the heat of the kiln. He missed the whir of Dummy's wheels and the sharp pinch of his claws. He missed Natashas quiet sarcasm and Sams wry expressions. He missed the rich scent of Bruces cooking and overwhelming sound of the twins screams. He missed Clint's body sprawled on every available surface sleeping, mouth open usually a baby or two on his breast. He missed, he missed. Tony. The smiles, the conversations the jokes, and quiet company. He was legally Tonys mate but that meant nothing without the man beside him.
"He's there."
"That he is but I feel my virility will appeal to him." Thor answered.
She hummed and stood reaching out for one of the twins so that Clint could also haul himself up.
"I'll ask the peanuts if they want to get you some next time they are in town."
"Too omega."
“And his children’s blood.”
“Why am I not surprised,” Steve said dryly.
Steve stood up and held out a hand. “Or you over stepped your boundaries.”
“Interesting.”
“You’re enjoying it.”
“It's so cute.” She said her voice monotone.
"Lord Stark, mustn't know I am unwell, or it will break his heart and he's already lost two before, I fear what another shall do." Jarvis said.
"They are promising a rise production by the end of the year," Sam informed.
“Angel,” Tony grumbled. “You are tarnishing your holy reputation.”
“I know a good man when I see one.”
Dummy's wheels rocked back and forth, and he wiggled his little clawed arm in a small victory dance. Steve gently patted him. He turned to Jarvis to say something when the automatons eyes flickered out again.
"I made breakfast. Not as well as Doctor Banner but still, good enough. I'll be taking Tony his meal--" he opened.
Steve ran up to meet them. “Who is that?” he asked just as they dumped the mysterious man on the ground. His hair was a light brown, sticking up in different directions, and he had soft features with distinct cheekbones.
“Okay Jarvis, coming!” The child yelled back. He pushed his hands against the ground, gloves sinking slightly before standing up straight. He was about to turn to head back inside when he heard a whimper. The six year old stepped further into the garden, following the cry.
A puppy… they were going to get Steve a puppy probably. Tony didn’t hear the rest. His feet seemed to follow Nat whenever she went, but his mind wasn’t paying attention. He was too focused taking in all the occupants in the kennel. The older dogs would probably never find a home and die in here… you could see it in their eyes… they knew. They gave up hope on finding a new home a long time ago.
Steve smirked. “Last I checked, Mr. Stark, this puppy belonged to me.” He was going for a joke, a small jab, but Tony’s face looked crestfallen.
“Surprise? You guys didn’t have to get me anything,” he frowned.
Tony fiddled with his sleeve, suddenly nervous as he stood in front of his mirror. He wasn’t even sure why he was doing this in the first place. Yes, he did want to eat the snow and feel it against his skin, but was it worth it? No… it was more than that. It was time to prove to himself that he was stronger than people thought he was. He could handle a little cold no problem. What was a prince that couldn't even handle harsh weather? Worthless, that’s what. Princes were suppose to fight for their people and yet, here was Tony hiding in the castle during the winter months.
“Tony, stop. I didn’t mean it like that. He’s probably going to be as much as anyone’s as he is mine. This is our dog,” Steve said earnestly and looking into his eyes, Tony wanted to believe him. He placed the puppy back in Tony’s arms. Was that why Tony didn’t want anything to do with the animal at first? Did he really think Steve would take him away and never let Tony see him?
And Tony, just for this moment, believed him.
Clint started moving forward again and Steve followed. Clint took the left cuff and secured it to the man’s left wrist. Steve gently secured the right and lowered it to the man’s lap. He stepped back.
Steve smiled back, tracing patterns into Tony’s skin. He rested his other hand on Sergeant’s back, petting the pup before looking back up into Tony’s eyes with conviction. “And I promise, Tony. I won’t let anything happen to him.”
“I didn’t know much about Howard, despite what anyone might say, but I do know you deserved to be loved Tony. And this,” he stopped and pushed his dog into Tony’s lap before continuing. “This little guy is both of ours.”
When the meeting ended, Tony went straight to the knight’s quarters and knocked. He could hear Rhodey shuffling around inside as he waited. When Rhodey did open the door, he met Tony with a glare and a bed head.
“Oh, wow… it’s so soft.” He manipulated it in his hand, rubbing it along his palm and fingers. Already Tony could feel the cold affecting his breathing slightly, but not nearly enough for cause of concern. He dropped the snow and pulled the glove back over his now frozen hand. He was still in the process of standing up when he felt something collide with the back of his head. Slowly, he reached behind and felt moisture on his hood. Frowning, he turned around, and saw Rhodey with a snowball in his hand, smirking.
“Grilled cheese and tomato soup? Yessss!” He ran off with his arms outstretched in the air. It wasn’t often Jarvis got to indulge the boy, but with Howard being off on a business trip, he figured this called for a special meal. He followed after his charge at a more sedate pace, feeling no need to rush.
“Aw Tony, don’t worry. He won’t bite, I promise. Here,” he held out the puppy and pushed him towards Tony’s chest and goddammit Tony could actually hear that damn tail wagging. He made the mistake of looking at it. It was panting like crazy and wiggling, obviously excited to see a new person even though he had technically already met Tony.
“Now you stay here,” Tony said as he arranged a nest out of the blanket for his new friend. “The maids already did the laundry today so you’ll be fine while I eat lunch. No one else really comes in here.” He pulled down the last corner of the fabric. “It's done. A bed made just for you.”
“We’ll take him.”
“You’re okay, Tony…,” he said. “It’s gonna be okay.”
“Why?” Steve repeated. “Tony I don’t-”
--------
When Tony made no move to take him, Steve reach out and rearranged Tony’s arm to hold him before cautiously handing him over. In an instant, the puppy was all over Tony’s face, licking anywhere he could reach and Tony… Tony started crying.
“What happened to him?” Steve asked.
Steve stared at the cuffs, suddenly reluctant. The man in their arms seemed so fragile, so small. It didn’t seem right to cuff him, not when Steve could easily subdue him if he needed to.
“I asked you a question, boy,” Howard sneered.
“What was that?!” Howard yelled.
This time, Tony started backing away slowly, hands outstretched in front of him. Flake stayed, not chasing after the boy. “Good, Flake. Stay.” When Tony reached the door, he turned and close it as fast as he could.
“You got me a puppy?” Steve looked up, eyes glistening and didn’t that just make Tony melt. Steve Rogers, Captain America, was crying over a dog. “He’s perfect,” he whispered, lifting the retriever to his eye level. “Brown eyes huh? They kind of match yours Tony… Tony?” But Tony wasn’t there anymore… he left.
“I was going to ask you what you thought about this one.” She stepped aside, revealing a small golden retriever in the arms of the young girl who walked them in here. He was perfect really… blonde fur that matched Steve’s hair. HIs little tail wagged a mile a minute, obviously ecstatic to be picked up. Tony knew Steve would just fall in love… and so could Tony. It was hard to look into those brown eyes and see anything but a pure puppy looking for love.
The sun fell and with it, shadows descended over the castle. Outside was still as white as ever, the ground seemingly glowing underneath the dark sky. Inside the castle, Tony was getting ready, pulling on a gray cloak that had a hood to cover his face. Underneath he was wearing a simple, thick long sleeve tunic, pants with brown boots, and gloves.
Steve just smiled. “I knew he was never going to be just mine. I didn’t want a dog for only me, Tony. I wanted one for us.”
“I can’t believe he’s only been here for two weeks and they let him on important missions like that. You’ve been here your whole life practically but the dude with the superiority complex is more trustworthy?” Clint said, shaking his head. Steve continued to look at the young man at their feet. He kneeled down, listening to his breathing which was erratic.
But Steve sounded so genuine, looked so genuine. Could he really do this? Could he really let himself love another dog?
Tony avoided his gaze and shrugged. “Just not a big dog person is all…”
Instead of leaving though, Steve stepped closer again. When Tony made no move to avoid him, he pulled the genius into him. Tony made a muffled sound that may have been a whimper against his shoulder. Steve just held him tighter, both arms wrapped firmly around Tony’s back.
“I doubt even he knows that.”
“W-what?” The man lurched forward and the cuffs grew taut. Steve watched as his eyes furrowed in confusion. His head slowly turned towards his hands, noticing the cuffs. His breathing began to pick up again. Steve was quick to try to pacify him.
“Might as well cut you off from all education with how dumb you are.”
On the way back, Tony stayed ahead of Natasha and the new puppy. He didn’t want to have to look at them, but it wasn’t long before Nat caught up and offered him the leash. Tony almost took it, almost let himself fall for this dog, but resisted, hastily picking up his pace so he could get back to the tower sooner.
Not this time though. Tony couldn’t go to boarding school; who would take care of Flake? He couldn’t just leave him. There was Jarvis, who would undoubtedly look after the dog while Tony was gone, but Flake would go crazy without Tony there. The poor boy was anxious if Tony didn’t stop by after lunch half the time.
“Eat it?”
“You must be freezing out here. Mama says the best remedy for the cold is hot cocoa. Can dogs drink hot cocoa?” The boy contemplated as he walked, but the dog just burrowed further into coat, seeking warmth anywhere he could find it.
“I told myself I would never fall in love with another animal… with another dog, ever again.” Steve didn’t know what to say. To think he use to admire Howard and his way of life. He changed… all Howard ever wanted was a brighter future, but had he been that so far up his own ass that he hadn’t noticed he was diminishing his son’s?
“Steve, no. There’s nothing you could have done. The Howard you knew drowned under the influence of alcohol. There was no saving him.”
“Another knight. They came running into the house together. They left him tied up outside the castle doors with a note taped to his chest. Just a threat yanno.”
“I think that’s all he knew,” Tony replied back. Steve didn’t like it, but for now, he let it be. Instead, he gingerly picked up his own forgotten puppy in the midst of conversation and sat next to Tony on the bed.
---------
“Then how…?” It was true that no one knew what Prince Anthony Stark looked like. He never made any appearances outside the castle, kept locked up inside for some reason. It was part of the reason Steve hated this idea. How were they supposed to capture a man they couldn’t recognize?
Steve observed the way the man’s chest heaved with every breath.
Clint shrugged. “That was always the plan apparently. One trip to scout the place and note it’s weaknesses. And of course now they have the kid here to leak anything they don’t know.”
The next year, he left home to attend that prestigious boarding school.
‘Your chest? Is it muscle?” Steve asked.
Clint withdrew an arrow from his sheath and a handkerchief from his pocket and began cleaning the tip. “Oh yeah the kid… some knight or somewhat from the kingdom. Boss thinks we could send out a ransom for him. Not sure the king’s going to care about one lonely knight but-”
“No one you need to worry about,” the man said. Steve frowned, looking up at the man’s face. His name was Bryan… or Brook or something. He was the newest recruit, and for some reason he did not like Steve. Many people didn’t like Steve though.
“Tony…” Rhodey sighed, rubbing his hand down his face. “We’ve talked about this. You can’t go in the snow.”
Tony looked up then, tears leaking out of his eyes. “Why?” he asked.
“Don’t know,” Clint replied. “Boss says he has his ways. God knows at this point.”
“I know, I know! But just hear me out. I’m merely suggesting a few minutes out in the cold, just enough to touch and eat it if I please,” Tony replied.
He swallowed and nodded his agreement. “T-this one-I mean he… he’s perfect.” Natasha smiled.
“I mean I guess that’s true, but Tony still helped pick it out and everything! You’re gonna love it,” Clint exclaimed. Not a moment later Natasha reentered the room with Steve’s new puppy.
Tony didn’t notice him until a half hour later, right when the genius hit his head against his own lamp after picking up the wrench he dropped. “Are you alright?” Steve had asked after the string of curses finally ceased out of tony’s mouth.
“Tony!” Rhodey couldn’t help the laugh that bubbled up inside his chest at the action. “Maybe try to keep the gloves on?”
She held it up and smiled. “Happy Birthday, Steve,” she said as she passed it over.
Again, no excuses. Won't even begin to try to apologize or explain why this took four years. I am already working on the next chapter however. All I can hope is you remain patient with me.
