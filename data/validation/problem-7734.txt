"Okay, I will meet some of his friends...But...can I meet them later, I am not...completely ok with it right now." He said, almost afraid of getting a denial. He wanted desperately to be the person they were looking for, but he did not want to get his hopes up. Jane looked hesitant for a moment before speaking in a soft tone.
Steve continued to move at a nearly brutal pace, his pleasure soaking into Tony's bones. Soon they were spirally faster and faster toward climax. The only thing that kept them going for this long was Steve's stamina that came from the Super Solider Serum. It made it easier for them to not just blow up after a couple of touches like other Perfect Matches. There was a spike of pleasure, Tony's inner walls tightening a bit around Steve's cock. That set them both off. The tightness combined with the heat creating a precipitate that set off their simultaneous climax. Steve gave one more strong thrust, pushing his hips tightly to Tony's in order to climax deep inside his mate, as if wanting to mark him from the inside. Tony's climax coated their stomach, creating a sticky mess. Neither of them cared. They collapsed into the bed, Steve on top of Tony for a moment before he rolled off to one side. The Solider gathered his mate into his arms, burying his nose in that sweaty brown hair. He took a deep breath, evening out his breathing.
Time passed slowly it seemed. It was like he was making no progress at all. The desert around him was making his anxiety spike to abnormal degrees. He did not know why. He figured it was his mind recalling something yet not letting him in on what it was. As he walked, he started to notice a light up ahead. He knew he had not walked the entire distance to the town yet, so he continued more cautiously. As he came upon the source of the light he found that it was a broken down car. The hood was propped open and the sounds of cursing came from beneath the hood.
"Oh god, you are him. Oh god. I thought I lost you again. It's always~"
"Tony….tell me why you are scared?" Tony looked startled and struggled to get out of Steve's arms. But Steve held fast, not wanting Tony to run from this. Whatever this was.
Dripping water on his lips. Pain.
MSG:He is fine. I just need to know if Natasha put those goggles in the places I asked her too. We need to find Cap a match
He grunted as his eyes water. It was humiliating to be hit like that. He struggled to get Zac off him. He let out a short cry of pain when Zac used the hair he had in his grip to yank him over onto his stomach. Fear gripped him tighter. He felt Zac tear the jumper off his shoulders and off his hips. He felt sick to his stomach. No, this was not happening. A rough calloused hand pawed at his ass. He struggled harder but then the hand on his hair let out only to reach between the bed and himself. Cold dread gathered deep in his heart as that hand grabbed at the edge of the machine. He let out a snarl as his struggles renewed. He didn't care if he broke his arm, which was now pinned against his back. His survival instincts kicking in. He knew there were tears in his eyes as he fought harder as that hand gripped the machine and tugged it a bit.
"Can we….take it slow though? I have rushed relationships before and they….ended badly. I just-" Steve leaned forward and silenced Tony with soft kiss.
Too soon Steve tore his mouth from Tony's cock, working it with his hand to gather the saliva and cum that was there before stroking his own cock, coating it to make it easier. Not that it matter much form what Tony could tell. Steve braced his hands on either side of Tony's head, leaning down to capture Tony's lip in a deep passionate kiss, nipping at Tony's bottom lip every now and again. Tony let out a gasp as he felt the head of Steve's cock push breach him. His head was spinning. He could feel everything Steve felt. It was strange because it was like he was being fucked and doing the fucking. He gripped Steve's shoulders tightly, relaxing and going pliant under the stronger man. Steve took this as a sign that he was ready to take this on the level that they would have been if there wasn't a mutual concern for each other's pleasure.
"How are you today Captain Rogers?" She asked in a cool tone. Steve felt his senses lessen even more, indicating that Pepper Potts was a Guide. He gave her a shy smile.
Pain ripped him from the delicious dream. He grunted and shot up only to have his mouth covered and a heavy body press him into the mattress. He struggled for a bit before he realized that it was Zac on top of him. His eyes narrowed for a moment, wondering what Zac was doing. The man looked...enraged. The man on his mouth clamped tighter. The man's blue eyes were a blaze.
"We do, sir." JARVIS said. Steve jumped, not realizing he had been speaking aloud. He looked up at the screen before him, uncertain.
"I'll let you two decide." Coulson put his arm down and stepped to one side, offering Jet the chance to make his choice. Jet stood there for a moment, swallowing thickly. He wasn't really sure if he want or could do this. But after he took the first step forward, his feet seemed to follow an age old pace towards the diner. As he walked to the door, he noticed Thor and Jane sitting at a table with two blonds. He couldn't see their faces because they were facing away from him, but he could tell one was a woman and the other was a man. He opened the door and gave Vanessa a hesitant smile as he walked towards Thor and Jane, figuring that logically that the people in the booth were more of Thor's friends and likely the two people who would be deciding his fate. Fear seemed to retch higher and higher the closer he got. Thor looked up and gave him a big smile.
"Found you" Was all Steve said against his neck. Tony chuckled a bit.
"We can't keep doing this Zac. You keep wanting more than I can give you. We both knew this was never serious but you keep pushing for it to be." Jet said sadly. He did not like the idea of losing one of the only people he came to know while he lived in this town. He wasn't even sure he wanted to leave it. But he wanted to know. He needed to know who he was. That was what he wanted the most. Living in this town allowed him to just exist and be whoever he wanted to be, but it did not ease the ache of longing in his chest. Nor did it ease the sense of lose that came with it. He felt he could be doing more, had been doing more for the world then just fixing cars. Now, here was his chance to find out who he was. And on top of all that, Steve was here, making him long to be in the man's arms once again. He just hoped they had not had a serious break up. That would not be a good thing. But Steve had not acted like a man with a broken heart. Steve acted like a man who had a chance to reclaim a lost love.
Steve was beyond grateful to Tony for installing JARVIS into his phone. While the other Avengers were jealous, given that Tony was very possessive over who had access to JARVIS, Steve felt special being one of the only people who had JARVIS installed on his cellphone. It also gave him a greater sense of relief. If he did not understand something someone said, reference or some bit of technology, he would tap the screen of his phone, saving the reference for later that night. Each night he would ask JARVIS to help him understand the things on his list. It was a miracle. However, he only did this for common people and never anything Tony or Bruce talked about. Or at least nothing that sounded to complex. Each day he found himself getting better and better at acclimating to the world around him.
"Well, the diner is just across the street. That is where I normally get my food. Want to go over and grab a bit before you go looking around the town?" Zac asked with a charming smile. The smile was a little off as well, but Jet just nodded, making sure he had the food voucher that Marco gave him for lunch. It seemed that the diner and the shop had a system. People got their cars worked on over here and went over for lunch. It was a great system. It got more people into the diner and it also gave Marco time to figure out what was wrong with the cars.
"Mr. Snow!" A female voice called to him as he continued to walk towards the edge of town. He wanted to get free. He slowed his pace, looking over his shoulder only to see Dr. Foster walking towards him. He stopped to allow her to catch up. She gave him a once over be speaking.
"Tony! Snap out of it!" Steve said, shaking him. Bullets flew over the edge of the bike. Tony shook his head before shoving Steve away.
"You wouldn't be happy" Natasha said in a soft tone, her face still completely blank. The only thing that gave her away was her eyes. There was a softness to them. A vulnerability that, if he wasn't stuck in 'anger' mode, he would have noticed. But he was snapping and snarling at everyone for no reason.
"Please tell me I can have some of that coffee"
"I figure I should stick around here till I figure out what is going on. I mean I am smart enough to know I wouldn't be ATV-ing alone. Hopefully someone will file a missing person report and I will be out of here in no time." He said before he looked up at Lisa who placed a plate in front of Harold and himself. The food smelt delicious. It was then that he realized how ravenous he was. Not that he would show it. He was coming to realize he was a very Sentineled man. He did not like showing vulnerability to anyone.
"I am. I want to protect it, because out of everyone in the world, I am too old fashioned to allow anyone to break it or you, including myself." Steve said, making it clear to Tony that he understood the implications of Tony was asking. Tony looked unsure, confused almost. Steve decided that Tony needed some kind of proof that he understood what Tony was actually asking of him. He kept his hand on Tony's arc reactor as he leaned down and brushed his lips over Tony. Tony's lips fell open as he sucked in a sharp breath before letting it out in a shutter. Steve pulled back to look at Tony. The man look alike he was god smacked. Steve gave him a shy smile, hoping that he read what Tony wanted right.
"My powers are amped some reason today. Come in holding hands please." With that he hung up, knowing very well that Pepper would do as he asked. It was not like this had anything to do with a company problem or the like. He reached under the table and pulled out a glass and a bottle of scotch. He poured himself a generous amount as Pepper's and Natasha's emotional signatures came his way. They suddenly dulled and thankfully went silent. He pulled the goggles on and turned to look at the door.
Steve hissed darkly as he moved into Stark's space. No, this was his space, Tony was the outsider here. "I'm so sick of
"Yes. I have noticed that he is a rather tactile person. What does that have to do with anything?" Steve asked, obviously confused as to the point of all this. Tony didn’t even like him. Hell he even smacked the man's hand off of him, which seemed to piss the other man off. He remembered that was when they went after each other the first time.
Tony felt something smack him in the forehead. He shot Clint a dark look, who was trying to look innocent. For some reason he knew that it was the Archer.
"I...did not see...I mean, I just thought-"
He just had to finish working on the program and user interfacing system to make it easier for Pepper to handle. The Society had said that they were willing to help Pepper with her work, if she agreed to do it, by doing more mixers to gather more data. Then they would move it internationally. Tony focused everything he had on getting the programming just right. It was when he was working on something that he could, for that moment, disconnect from the world around him and just focus on something else. He was nearly finished with his work when he was suddenly assaulted amusement and mental snickering. He jerked up right to find Pepper and Natasha standing in his lab, smiling like mischievous children. Tony scowled at them
"Are you planning on staying in New York, Captain?" She asked as she followed after Steve as he marched to his bike. He needed to escape. Needed to be free from the constraints of the title 'Captain'.
"This will take a moment. I have to ask, do you have a preference of gender?" She asked, preparing to find him a nearly perfect match if the program could not find a perfect match for Steve.
"That was true during the time where Palladium was poisoning his system and he thought he was going to die. Captain have you ever noticed how much Tony…touches people?" Steve took a moment to think about this. He found that Tony was a very tactile person. He smacked Thor on the arm when the God moved by him. He messed with Bruce and patted him on the back often. Hell, even when they were at odds, Tony never stopped himself from patting Steve on the arm before leaving. Then there was the whole couch scene he walked in on last night. So he could see how much of a tactile person Tony was.
"Are...there pictures of..." Jet asked, letting his legs fall off the chair. He wanted to see if he was who they thought he was. Steve nodded and set his pencil down before closing the book and opening it to the right set of pages and held it out to Jet. Jet hesitated before taking it. There was a picture of a man bending over a rather sophisticated looking machine. He flipped the page and there was the same man, with a rather intricate looking goatee, grinning with grease on his face. He continued to flip through the pages before he came to one that man his heart stop. It was the most intimate of all of them.
"Hey man. Look, I am sorry about this morning. I am not a big morning person. Without my coffee, I am very nasty. I didn't mean to take it out on you." Zac said in a sheepish tone. He looked honestly sorry for the way he acted and part of Jet wanted to trust the man. Jet patted Zac on the shoulder.
Heat scrapped over his skin as he continued to run, struggling to remain standing as the golden red sand slowed him down. The explosions continued. One after another. The entire place was consumed by flames. It was a good thing that whatever building he just left was in the a desert. If it hadn't been, the explosion would have caused huge damage to the surrounding area. Yet it was a horrible thing because there he was, running through a desert with no idea where he was, what had happened. Worse yet, he had no idea who he was. All he knew was that he was not going to die in this desert. He was going to survive.
"Well, that would explain why most people didn't recognize me." Tony said in a humorless tone. He was kinda put out by the whole thing. He could have been home earlier, in the safety of tower and away from people like Zac. Tony wrapped his arm around his waist and used it to prop up his other arms so that he could tap his fingers over the arc reactor.
"I bet it would be great to just lie out here and take in the stars." Jet said as they stood up on the roof. Zac grabbed his shoulder and gave it a squeeze. Jet felt thrill course through his veins at the open touching. He gave Zac a shy smile which was returned.
"You are in a recovery room in New York City." She said easily, as if his confusion was normal. He remained silent for a moment before he looked at the radio then looked over at the window. The sounds did not correlate with what she was telling him. He gave her a serious stared before he spoke again.
Steve was temporarily blinded by the flash of blue before he felt exhausted. He knew he was going to black out from this. He struggled to remain conscious, if only to make sure when he blacked out he didn't smother his Match. He fell beside the unconscious Tony, pulling the man into his arms with their hands still clasped.
"They did something to me, ok? I am the successful project. Some how, I can communicate to anything that holds data. The internet, any computer or cell phone. I have access to it with my mind." Tony said, glaring hotly at Steve, not at all amused by the being held down thing. Steve stared at him silently before he reached into his pocket and pulled out his phone.
"Relax, Bruce. He doesn't understand." Natasha said in a cool tone even as she reached for her gun, just in case. Bruce looked like he was considering how to get away with murder before he jerked his arm from Natasha's hand. For a moment it looked like Bruce was going to hit him, instead the Doctor just walked passed him, shouting over his shoulder as he went.
He let out a short cry as large hands yanked him backwards. He struggled and barely prevented himself from begging to be free. He was pulled between two legs and his back pressed against a broad chest. Those large arms wrapped around him. He put his hands over his face, to hide his tears as an all too familiar scent washed over him. He felt the gentlest of kisses being placed on his neck. He felt stupid for this, but it was all too much at once. It started with his fear for the Avengers and it spiraled into something more. It turned into a living nightmare. He felt shame at being so weak.
"Yes…Yes, please Steve. I want that." Tony said, his hands clenching Steve's shoulders tightly. He knew he was hard, leaking on the inside of his loose pants. Those finger moved up under his shirt before sliding back down, under his bottoms. Tony's grip of Steve's shoulders tightened as those fingers ghosted over his cleft of his ass. Tony wiggled in place, finding the pants now restricting. Not that it was true, but it certainly felt like it. Steve's hands pushed the pants down to his knees, effectively trapping Tony in his lap and exposing him to the cooler air of the room. Steve's hands instantly found their place on his ass. Those hands squeezed and worked his ass, making Tony pant with pleasure. It was almost too much. The strange duality of familiar and foreign was making the situation even more electric.
"C-can we leave now?" He asked in a hesitant tone. He wasn't sure how Steve arrived into town. Steve suddenly rolled to his feet, bringing Tony with him. He pulled out his cellphone and pressed a button.
"Ok, let me look at it." He looked at the motor of the car, eyeing the lovely motor. There was nothing like a classic well kept engine. At least not in his mind. He started to check over all the normal thing that could make a rattling sound when in motion. He reached into the area to feel underneath the motor for anything that felt loose. He looked to his left when he felt someone lean against the car. It was the woman.
Nothing.
Steve crossed the room like a man possessed. That larger hand grasped Tony's more nimble one. The feeling of completion and perfection filled them before they both felt something snap into place. A bright blue light filled the room, the compound and lit up the sky. The strength of the bond snapping into place was enough to knock the Bond Pair out. They collapsed on the bed, knocked into a deep sleep. Their hands remained tightly clasped, neither willing to let go even in their sleep.
"Are you guys ever going to tell me?" Jet asked in a soft pleading tone. He wanted to know. Steve looked at him confused for a moment before he tapped his fingers on the top of the table.
"It's ok, Tony. You can tell me"
Steve fell silent as he took it all in. Tony helping Thor understand technology under the assumption that he didn't want to keep buying the God new cellphones. Tony opening his doors to the Avengers, especially to Clint and Natasha who had no place to call home. Tony making light of things that Pepper was stressing about, making the tall blond smile and relax a bit. Tony making an ass out of himself at a conference in order to cover up the fact someone recognized Bruce. He let out a groan, understanding now that he had made a mistake with all of Tony's past actions. He had been so disgusted in Tony's actions that he had not taken the entire picture in.
"Tell you…what? You can ask me anything you want…but sometimes I will want you to trust me that somethings are better left unknown for a while." Steve said in an equally soft tone. Jet relaxed a bit, understanding that the man was trying to protect him from something. He licked his bottom lip for a moment, contemplating if Steve would answer the question he wanted.
"Very well, Ma'am. Yourself?" He asked, hoping he wasn't making her day difficult by coming here. He would hate to be a burden to an already busy woman.
Uncertainty. Fogginess. Throbbing
Tony's mind short circuited when Steve's mouth came down to mouth over his covered erection. He felt his hot breath ghost through the material to caress over him. He let out a short curse, not believing how good it felt. Suddenly, his wrists were released and his hips were pull up. Steve jerked his pants off him in one swift motion, leaving Tony naked beneath him. Tony watched as those eyes roamed over his body, taking everything in with a desperate hunger. Tony never felt more desired or loved then in that moment. He sat up on his elbows and watched as Steve shucked off his own jeans, revealing himself to Tony. His breath hitched as he saw how….well endowed his mate was. He grinned a bit and held his out to Steve.
"Uh...No, my boyfriend wouldn't like me ruining his car and her girlfriend tends to worry over her a lot." The man returned with an even more happy tone. Jet blushed a bit, feeling bad that he just made an assumption like that. He nodded and walked to the hood of the car, unlatching it.
Bruce was reading over the information on the screen as it came up. Tony sat there, reading the information backwards since the screen seemed to be transparent. There was a tiny particle that was zoomed in. Tony set the cup down.
"I'll be fine. I just…it was just a very…strange dream" Tony said in a shaky voice. Steve seemed to take that as a bad thing, shifting closer to Tony. Those strong arms wrapping about him.
Tony was dizzy and sick. He wanted it all to stop. Stop. Stop. He felt someone grab his arm and yank him backwards. He struggled, not liking the inky slick feeling that rolled over his skin. It was all becoming too muhc. He didn't want to do this anymore. He struggled a bit more till the hand let go. There was a blooming of pain that was tearing through him before someone else grabbed him. Things dimmed a bit. The feeling of concern and lightness moved over him. The sense of ordinary falsified creeped over him before he was ushered into a car. He knew it was Coulson. Only that man could seem so ordinary yet not be. He was still struggling as Coulson spoke into his phone. It turned out the car was actually one of Stark Industries latest inventions. Like Steve's motorcycle, the car could hit speeds that no other car could.
Chapter 3:
"Thanks Jet. I wouldn't have ever thought of that." With that Zac walked off to start on another ATV. Jet felt his heart beat faster. There was no way he was reading the signs wrong. Zac was definitely interested. Which made Jet feel like he had won the lottery. The man reminded him so much of someone…maybe the man in his dreams. Jet didn't really care at this point. He went back to work, losing himself in the engines. He worked through all his breaks. It wasn't until Marco told him that they were closing shop, that he realized that he even skipped lunch. He laughed a bit to himself, waving at Marco as he walked out of the shop.
Tony's head jerked in the direction of the voice, finding Steve staring at him with an unreadable expression. Tony had to look away. How could he ever think he was worthy of such a man after all the things he had done? How did he manage to pull the wool over Steve's eyes? Couldn't the man see that he was the worst kind of person?
Tired of
"Oh come on, you know it's you. Tony knows what it is like to be on the edge of insanity. He is the most powerful Guide ever recorded. He is basically courting sanity everyday. It didn't help that Pepper turned out to be a Perfect Match to Natasha. I think that is why Tony made her the Head of this project, because she has a Perfect Match. That and she is scary good at organization." Clint said with a wave of his hand. Steve swallowed, not believing how generous Tony was being. Even after their fighting on the Helicarrier during the Invasion Tony never stopped being generous with him. It seemed the man had a strange way of being a kind person. He was a huge ass most times. Hardly ever serious, always hiding behind a mask and seemed to be out for himself. Yet Steve saw beneath all of that to see a very generous, sensitive and scared man. He would never let anyone else know this. Part of him wanted to protect Tony but knew he couldn't. The only person who could truly protect Tony from all that caused him harm would be Tony's perfect match. Tony and Steve had been in the same room and nothing had ever happened.
MSG: In about a day. I will meet you at 3 tomorrow. Both of you ok?
"I am so sorry Pep. I didn't mean to do this to you again." He whispered against her hair. She stiffened and held him tighter before pulling away and looking at him in a strange manner.
"Tony, you are acting irrational. Please relax."
Men with guns walked into the room. He stepped back, on edge. He grabbed the men and then threw them to the wall, only to have them go through it. He looked around, now scared. He jumped over the called wall only to be in another room. He looked around, confused. He ran through a door. All he heard was Captain Roger and something about All Agents Code Thirteen, the sounds followed him as he ran. He ran into another room only to be slammed by more sounds, more smells, more feelings and more confusion. Guys in suits suddenly turned on him. He ran out the glass door, suddenly consumed by sounds of cars and people. He looked around, so very confused at the world that now surrounded him. There was still the same smells as before, only now he could tell he was being over powered. His mind struggled to keep up with what was going on around him. He ran and ran until he came upon a clearing. Building upon building were all around him. Lights, moving images like movies only in color. Cars like he had never seen. Everything was almost too much for him. It wasn't the world he had left behind. It was nothing like he had ever experienced before. He looked around in a circle, trying to comprehend everything.
"Nothing is wrong Pep. But I need you and your lovely killer down here to help me"
The Blue light signaled the coming together of a Perfect Pair. A rare occurrence even with all the Mixers the Society for Enhancements put on. Not that any of those events helped Tony at all. The only thing that helped Tony feel any better about reading thoughts and feelings was alcohol and meaningless sex. Sure people now called him a drunk playboy, but at least he wasn't going insane. Guides. He knew how quickly he could go that route. Too many emotions and mental voices could easily drive him insane. It was the reason why he avoided board meetings, he only did press interviews when he had to and went to parties occasionally. He was tired of hearing people think of him as nothing more than a guy who got lucky. More often than not, people always thought Tony was a horrible person. Except for Pepper, Natalie, Happy and Rhody, the rest of the world thought he was the worst. He could feel their hate, their animosity beating down on his from all sides whenever he left his house. Their thoughts destroyed his already fragile sense of self. His parents had ensured he never had much of one to begin with.
"Dude, you got the wrong guy. This is Jet Snow. Not whoever you think." Zac said, obviously upset about something. Jet felt bad because he lied to Zac about his name. Everyone thought that he remembered his name and nothing else. Jet looked up at the man and took a step back in fear. The Blond, Thor?, looked at Zac like he was going to kill him. The blond walked up to Zac, looking from Jet and then back again. Jet wanted to hide from that look. He crossed his arms, trying to ease the discomfort her felt. Yet...he felt something a kin to joy and humor at Thor's actions. He was confused by this. He was confused by the entire situation.
Steve was still laying in that bed three days after Stark left. It took his mind longer to fix all the damage done to it, but according to the doctors his recovery was quick. He laid in that bed, trying to not be overwhelmed by everything. Clint came in often to try and ease the beat of all the things going on. It helped, if only a little bit. But every bit helped him remain in a normal state of mind. He never got close to the Oblivion state, which was good. The Oblivion state was what happened when a Sentinel lost themselves to everything. The mind was consumed by everything and the Sentinel goes mad. They turn into monsters. They know no reason, no morality, and no limit. They kill and destroy anything that causes sensation. Which is everything and with their superior strength, they are deadly. Which is why it is so critical for powerful Sentinel to find a bond mate. It was the reason why Clint was around so much. Even though the man was bonded to Agent Coulson, he was still a powerful enough Guide to keep Steve's senses restrained some what.
Tony hummed a bit, looking around. There was nothing he wanted expect the jumpsuit he had one when he left that facility. He knew eventually he would have to tell Steve how he woke up and where, but for now he wanted to just ignore that. It seemed they forgot about him in the first place since he hadn't had any incidents with them for three months. He wasn't foolish enough to believe that they would just let him go free.
"Spit it out Stark, I don't have time for your annoying attitude right now." He snapped sharply. Something about Tony just always rubbed him the wrong way. Tony looked taken back before he smiled cockily at Steve. The blonde’s brows furrowed together in a scowl.
"Thanks Tony. Best work out to date." And he left it at that. He didn't look back, but that was a turning point for him. He knew for a fact, Thor did not go to town on the punching bags as much as he did. Thor would rather fight Steve than a 'lifeless sand of bag'. Tony had lied again and had done something for one of the team members. Took time away from his company, his missions and other projects to build them things they needed to stay on top of things. He did something completely selfless. Tony did not use any of the things he made, except for the Iron Man suit.
"Yeah, I am good with fixing things. Anything I get my hands on, I can fix." He said with a shrug. That was not so much a lie. He knew instinctively that it was true. Even if he did not know how to do it, he had that thing in his mind that would allow him to figure things out rather quickly. He took a sip of the lemonade.
"Yeah, we heard something rattling around. We have a distance to go still and we figured that we get it checked out now." The guy said with a grin. The man's attitude was almost infectious. If he wasn't on edge from what happened yesterday he would have returned the smile. As it was, the woman was staring at him in a way that made him want to run for cover. He waved between them.
"You have a Perfect Match" She whispered, covering her mouth for a moment. She let out a soft laugh that sounded like a sob as well. Steve was even more on edge now. Why would Pepper be crying about him having a Perfect Match. Was the person dead? He swallowed and shifted, feeling uncertain now.
"I can't get my phone to work, you and everyone else can do it effortlessly. I ended up dating a stalker, which you warned me about. The press seems out to get me, yet you handle it with ease. I don't fit in... anywhere." He muttered against Tony's shoulder. He did not want to let go for some reason. Tony patted his lower back before moving back a little bit and stared up at Steve.
"So, what do you say Steve. Do you want to be the first person we match?" Pepper was looking back down at the tablet, making it do strange things. Or at least strange to Steve. He felt his heart beat quickly in his chest. Could he do this? There was no question on whether or not he could do it. It was more a question if he was ready for the answers that came from this. He swallowed the thumb in his throat.
The strangest thing he figured out about himself was that he could gain information about a lot of things. He some how was able to do it by thinking of something really specific. Then his mind would come online, like a computer and the information would fly across his eyes. He then would return to normal after the request was fulfilled. He had no idea what it was or how he could do it. But it was so helpful, especially when a person had to survive in the desert. His brain told him he was located in New Mexico and five miles to his left was a road that would take him to the nearest town, which was 30 miles away.
"Why is that? Why can't he just be himself. Act like a regular person?"
"Huh…So that is why you laughed. Like me wearing you symbol, Cap?" Tony said with a devilish grin. Steve just walked to Tony as clasped his shoulder before leaning down and whispering in his ear.
To: Pep   From: Tony
. Yet you mock me, mock my choices, make fun all because you think you're right. You're not. All you are in a replaceable pilot in a fancy suit. Anyone could replace you.
'Just wait for him to stumble outside and I will have my goal.' The man started to walk towards Tony. Tony pushed up, knowing very well the stupid person wasn't well versed on how strong of a Guide Tony was, or else he would have tried to mask his thoughts. Not that it would have stopped Tony from knowing them, but at least he wouldn't be outright broadcasting them to the rest of the room. The only thing that worked in the man's favor was the fact no other Guides were at a level to hear thoughts.
"Nervous nelly is he?" Tony quipped without much though before he followed after Clint, who was already heading inside. Natasha walked in step with him, as if she needed to be close to him for some reason. Reasons he has yet to remember.
Zac didn't say anything for the entire time Jet stood there thinking about his chance to get his old life back. Instead the other man just walked out the door, not saying anything. That was the scariest thing of all. Zac always had to have the last word. For him to just walk out the door without saying anything set Jet on edge. It really did. He knew this wasn't over with. He knew that this was just the beginning. Jet sat on the bed and winced a bit at the pain that radiated down from his arm.
"Good talk Cap, now I got some work to do on this phone of yours. I will see you later." Tony said, making a very obvious retreat. Steve stood there for a moment, realizing what just happened. He found he kinda of….liked having Tony in his arms. It was like the one place he knew he could keep the man safe. He stuffed his hands into his pockets and went off to grab a sketch book. He figured that if he sketched what was on his mind in this moment, he could figure out what he was feeling in those moments of holding Tony.
"Of course Sir." Then like that sound returned. Only this time it was the regular sounds. The people next door moving around, some car sounds, but not everything. He felt a grin bloom on his face. Oh yes, he could deal with this. He walked back into the living room after removing his jacket. He sat back down on the couch and looked at the screen.
Those muscles moved and contoured in such delicious ways as Steve tossed the shirt off to one side. Tony arched up, tugging at Steve's hand,watching to be free to touch. Yet Steve seemed content to hold him down. Tony didn't mind. He always had to be in control of his sex-capades. But with Steve, he instinctively knew that he could just give himself over to Steve's capable hands.
"Ignore Natasha, she is trying to figure out how long you have been here as well as who you have been around. May I ask, how long have you been in this town?" Phil asked, looking at his boyfriend for a moment before looking back at Jet. Jet pushed his hand through his hair, unsure all of a sudden
"T-thor...THOR!" She turned on her heels and pushed herself against the office door, screaming out the name. Jet nearly jumped out of his skin at the woman's yelling. He did not understand what he did. But he did not have time to even contemplate what was going, for a huge blond came running in, holding a huge hammer.
"Well Cap, you have proven that even you are stupid enough to not see the warning signs that your life is in danger." The man said in a snarky tone. Clint simply rolled his eyes as Tony walked to one seat and sat in it. The brunette leaned back into his chair, staring intently at the blond before he pulled out his tablet. He began to work, focusing on the electronic device. Steve closed his eyes, feeling his mind working on repairing itself already. He had been able to avoid entiering the Oblivion State during the World War without the cuffs because he had a reason to use his hieghtened senses as a means to dominate the battle field. His eye sight allowed him to memorize a map that he barley glanced at. His hearing allowed him to dodge flying bullets and his sense of smell allowed him to smell a bomb trap yards a head of him. He had a reason to take advantage of his senses. But in civiliar life it was too much. He had no reason for it. He just wanted to be Steve Rogers, scrawny and unhealthy guy with amazing art skills. That is what he wanted to be when he was civilian. But he couldn't be that any more. He was the man He knew his mind was fixing itself because of the massive headache he had building between his eyes. He just wanted to be normal for a little bit longer, but it seemed the more he tried to be normal, the more damage he did to himself. He either had to resigned to a life of courting insanity or an endless cycle of hurting himself. But for now, he took advantage of Stark's strong Guide presences and fell into a light slumber.
for heaven's sake - by Fury. Apparently, all the Avengers lived together. In Stark Tower.
"Mostly, you would get them out. You were bad at eating and sleeping because of it. You would work for days on end. It was aggravating." Steve said in a playfully exasperated tone. Jet laughed a bit, finding it amusing that even now Steve was exasperated with his habits. He did tend to skip meals but the not sleeping thing changed. He liked to sleep now. Because he got to dream about Steve, got to dream about all the things they did together.
He walked out of the elevator and finding the floor to be dark save for the T.V screen. Something with dwarves and elves was flashing across the screen. But that is not what caught his attention. What caught his attention was the fact Tony was laying on the couch, his head pillowed on Bruce's lap and with his legs thrown over Natasha's lap. He watched as Bruce ran his fingers through Tony's hair as Natasha tapped her thumb on the Genius' legs. His heart ached as the intimate scene, yet it also made him uncomfortable. Was this what relationship were like now? Three people at once? He sneered in disgust at the idea. He figured it must have been Tony’s idea. He stepped forwards, intent on making a comment about how much of a playboy Tony was, when a hand came to clasp his shoulder tightly. He looked to find Clint staring at him with a smirk.
Steve moved instantly into action, yanking Tony to him and forcing them behind the bike. Tony was tense and stiff not sure what was going on. Another series of shots rang out. Steve looked over the bike, spying a black car parked across the street. In the dark, it was hard to discern how many people there were.
"MAN OF IRON!" Jet winced at the booming voice and let out a gasp of pain as he was suddenly wrapped up in steel arms. What the hell?! "I AM MOST GLAD YOU ARE WELL! THIS IS JOYOUS OCCASION!" Jet let out a grunt as the blond dropped him back onto his feet only to grip his shoulders.
"Yeah? What do you mean? Find out why." Steve said in a serious voice, closing the phone.
"I have been alive long, mortal, and I know the man who stands before me is the Man of Iron. Yet, he does not greet me like my shield brother. If you have anything to do with this, you shall pay." Thor stepped back and looked at Jet. He walked to the man and clasped his shoulder.
"Fuck, Rogers relax!" Barton's voice pierced his desperate haze. The Archer Guide looked like he was struggling to contain something. Steve looked confused before he realized that Clint was trying to keep too many sensation from bombarding Steve. That was the power of the Guides on the Sentinel. The Guides could, for unexplainable reasons, control the senses of the Sentinel. Some people reasoned it was because the Guide could feel when the Sentinel' senses were bearing down on their sanity and could counter their minds away from their sense. Clint looked like he was in pain. Steve tried to relax, but it wasn't working. He had been using the cuffs for about a month, so this intense bout of sensation were driving him into madness. He could barely hear Clint's cursing over all the other sounds, But he did hear what Clint said into his phone loud and clear.
It wasn't enough. Some of the bond pairs were separating. Soon fear and uncertainty was all around him. Multiple set thoughts about a stranger moving quickly towards the compound, a threat and a feral state were beating down around him. He let out a cry of pain before there was….nothing. Nothing but a strong pulse of electricity running down him. He let out a gasp as his eyes snapped open. He felt a pull deep in his stomach. But his body was to weak to answer it. The spiral had taken his strength from him. But he wanted that pull. The silence that descended upon him was unlike anything he had ever felt before. There was no thoughts or feelings save his own. There was nothing but a powerful sense of peace. There was something else, but it was being blocked from him.
"Jarvis, could you please turn off the noise remover? I want to see if these work"
Jet was elbow deep in a truck, working on it's shotty motor. Seriously, people needed to learn how to take care of their cars. It didn't help that his upper arms hurt and his back. But that was his fault. He had been mean in his words and it made sense that Zac would snap like that. Zac was right, he was stupid sometimes. He couldn't do anything right. But he couldn't let the man touch the thing in his chest without fighting tooth and nail to get Zac off him. It had led to a vicious fight and many...many bruises. In the end they decided not to talk about it. Their relationship was too young to get into the emotional crap. Jet knew they were using each other. Jet was using Zac's looks to make himself feel...something. He felt more when he was with Zac than he did alone. At least it was a semi-happy feeling. Not the crazed and scared feeling he got when he was alone. He did not feel safe, except when Zac was there. He felt a little safer with the blond. He could not explain it, but he did.
"Let me guess, your girl here isn't happy about having to stop." He said with a shrug. That made the girl smile a bit, not that it eased the dangerous aura she was giving off.
After losing Steve to the war effort and once the war was done, Howard Stark continued on with his life. He married a nice woman named Jamie, an intelligence agent and a Sentinel. The first time they tried to have a child, Maria miscarried. Nearly destroyed by this, Howard threw himself even further into his work, until one day he stumbled across something that would change the world forever. He had been in a bar for Guides and Sentinel to mingle when he noticed something that was completely out of the norm. Across the room, a Sentinel stood up sharply and whirled around on his heels. He stared across the room at Howard, or rather to the left of Howard. The genius' guide abilities to read people's emotions exploded. Every Guide in the room was clutching their heads and every Sentinel was tense. The man next to Howard, however, was none of these things. He was entranced. The Sentinel crossed the room in definite steps and grabbed the Guide. Their bodies glowed bright blue before it vanished. Howard looked startled, the intense possessive emotions vanished and a strong sense of contentment fell across the room. Howard was perplexed by not only what happened but the blue glow as well. Hesitantly he asked what had happened and the Sentinel replied that he had found his Soul Mate, his perfect match. Howard stared at the man, assuming he was speaking of the legend. That wasn't possible….but he had seen it happen. So what did he do? He researched and tried to figure out a way to make it so that every Sentinel and Guide, even himself, could find their perfect match. But alas the technology of the day did not allow him to create the means to do so. So he wrote it down for the next generation.
Tony was settled on the back of Steve's bike, grasping on tightly to Steve's waist. They were bolting down the road at nearly break neck speeds. Yet Tony wasn't scared. Instead he was exhilarated. It felt like flying. He felt something flash across his mind. Like he had once flown by himself before. He struggled to hold onto the memory, but found it alluding him. He wasn't sure what it was about but he wanted it back. Just as much as he wanted Steve back. He nuzzled into the strong span of back before him. He inhaled that scent that wafted off of Steve. It was covered by leather, but it was just enough to lull him. He felt so safe. Steve had told him that he was taking him home, to Manhattan, New York. Supposedly he lived at the top of a building. That was all he could know for now.
"For you….I will" Tony said in a soft whisper. Steve's hand squeezed over his for a moment. Jet/Tony looked up and gave Steve a wide grin. There was still something between them. This wasn't like what he felt with Pepper. This was something deeper and stronger. Something still alive, though stilted by his disappearance. He couldn't wait till it wasn't stilted any longer. He wanted to be safe again. He wanted that relationship again. He wanted Steve to hold him again. He would do anything for that.
"I don't know. I don't remember much anything. But, uh…if you want I can fix your car." He said cautiously. The other man raised a brow.
"Sir?" There was a twinge of uncertainty and fear in the tone.
What he saw when they walked in was astounding. There was a glow of a deep purple wave the seemed to completely encompass them. He stared at them, jotting down notes as he did. He paused and took a large drink off his scotch before waving his hand at them.
"Yes." Was all Steve said before walking into the jet, leaving Tony standing there slack jawed. Tony shook his head before following Steve into the jet. There was no way he wasn't going with the man after figuring that out. He was so focused on following after Steve that he never saw another blond leaning against the wall of the rest stop.
"Pepper, please. I just finished a mission and…. No I remember the dinner date. Pepper I had a mission…. Pepper….seriously….No, I am sorry. Pepper. Please….Just…..PEP!" Steve paused outside the door, hearing Stark curse every now and again. He wasn't sure what he just over heard. It sounded like the end of a relationship. He felt bad for Stark, but at the same time the man was an arrogant ass who thought of only himself. Not something that was conducive for a healthy relationship. Stark walked briskly out of the room nearby, pausing when he saw Steve. The other man looked him up and down before snorting.
"Uh….Excuse me?" He said softly, edging around the car, making sure to keep a safe distance just in case it was one of his captors. The darker man cursed colorfully before jumping back, holding his wretch like a weapon. The man stared at him for a while before he let the wretch fall a bit.
"Come on, just pick something out. I want you to be warm for the rest of the trip." Steve said, shifting in the store with his hands in his pockets. Tony sighed and crunched up his face. While it appeared as though he was upset about all this, he couldn't help but feel all warm inside at the idea of Steve taking care of him. He stuck out his tongue at the large man before walking around. He found all sorts of sweaters, pausing when he noticed the exact one he wanted. It was red, white and blue with a white star. He found it in his size before he walked to Steve, holding it up triumphantly
"Look lady, I don't give a damn who you are. Back off. Or I won't fix your car." He hissed, obviously on edge already. He did not like random people asking about him not taking his shirt off. He was already on edge from yesterday and this woman was just pushing all the wrong buttons. She held up her hands, the universal sign for surrender. He watched her back out of the garage before meeting up with her friend. He watched them both carefully before he went back to working on the car. Turns out, there was a lose wire that was rattling back and forth in its place. He tightened it and turned the car on, checking it for anything else.
"SELF DESTRUCT SEQUENCE INITIALIZED." He laughed, shocked and scared at what he seemed to have done. His mind was slowly pulling itself from the fog as well. Because number were flying across his mind, calculations for how long it would take to get to the nearest escape route and how fast he had to go. He did not understand how he could do it but he ran as hard as he could, ducking under the soldiers that were coming at him. His speed and his reflexes surprised him greatly. But he did not have time to dwell upon it. He slammed a Sentinel into the door that led to escape. Just in time because the entire ground shook violently. There was an interior explosion first. It consumed much of the underground area and the top floor.
Steve was a bit taken back by this. This was too much. Already Tony had provided him with JARVIS, the TV and the Shielding Cuffs, now he was providing him with a motorcycle? He did not understand why the man who treated him with nothing but disdain would do all these things for him. Keeping in mind a majority of those things happened before Tony Stark knew him as a still, they could not get a long. He did not even bother to thank the man for the cuffs, which he wore all the time now. He never took them off for any reason. He was glad to be able to live his life as a regular person. Even before the serum, he had had issues with his senses. They would fluctuate in and out. No doctor had been able to explain it. But that did not matter now. Now he had the chance to be a regular person. He was going to take advantage of it.
"Yeah, sorry was in the shower. Come on in. I just need to put the jumper then we can head out." He said in a calm voice, not wanting to get Zac riled up this early in the morning. The man obviously was lacking a coffee maker. He paused in zipping up his jumper, realizing he could make one if he found spare parts. It wouldn't be too hard. He finished up by yanking on his plain sneakers before walking out. He paused when he saw how casually Zac was leaning against the wall. Something struck Jet for a moment. The man seemed so familiar. Jet felt his temperature rise when he noticed that Zac's eyes were slowly moving over his body.
"I hate it when you two do that. Really, Pep? I expected better from you. You~" He waved his hand at Natasha "Not so much. But nice going getting her to loosen up. What time is it? Oh yes, it is three. Good" He clapped his hands together before he tapped the screen of the tablet once more. The system reset itself in order to reboot with the newer program installed. He looked at them before he grabbed a tumbler of bourbon and took a large swallow off the amber liquid.
"Ta da! I did that once, what I was fixing…well whatever I was fixing. I accidentally pushed the rag into the oil can without thinking." He said with a shrug. Zac was giving him the strangest of looks. He walked up to Jet and clasped his arm a bit, rubbing his thumb over Jet's arm.
Chapter 15:
"..Vu...affirmative. Mr. Rogers, S.H.E.I.L.D agents in route...hold on...hold..." His vision tunneled and he felt his head hit the door as he collapsed. Blackness over took his vision and all he could think was that he was going to die without thanking Tony for all he had done in spite of his poor attitude towards him.
"I….am not going anywhere Tony. You and the other Avengers have become like my family. I just…don't know how to handle things of this world like everyone else. It gets to me sometimes." Steve said, feeling Tony's arms flex around his waist. He chuckled a bit, a bitter sound. "Plus I won't get any peace if I leave, especially once that article hits the stands."
"Tony, I am busy running your company. I can't just come over right now."
Jet jerked upright, awakening with a hard on. He was breathing like he had just ran a marathon. He looked around wildly before he realized that he was still in the apartment that he was renting. It had been four days since he ended up in this town. Since he had awoken in an underground building with people after him and no identity. He was slowly growing used to the name Jet Snow, even if it did not fit. It didn't even feel right on his tongue. But for now it was all he had. He closed his eyes but found that sleep alluded him.
"Yeah… now I definitely feel like an ass." Steve said, looking up at them. Pepper had a soft expression on her face, seemingly glad that Steve now understood at least partly what was going on. He did not have a full understanding, but he knew now what to look for. Now he understood how much he had misjudged Tony in the past. He would have to try harder to understand Tony. He owed the man that much.
"But he died. Yinsen died." Tony whispered against Steve's shoulders, some how knowing that Steve knew who he was talking about. Steve's arms flexed around him.
Jet was not looking forward to today. He figured by now Thor's friends would be in town. He really was not looking forward to meeting them. He did not want to get his hopes up. He did not want to let them down as well. He figured their friend must be really important if they were going to be driving down to see if he was actually the person Thor thought he was. The strangest thing about all this was the fact that the man called him 'Man of Iron', but never by the name of his friend. It was strange, but even stranger was that he had no desire to look up anything about the man. He did not want learn anything before today. The man was strange enough, with his peculiar way of speaking and mannerism. And what was with the hammer?
"The guy we are looking for was the same way. He would positively turn blue." The man added stress on the color, causing Jet's jaw tighten. "should someone even touch it. Outside of two very specific people." Phil noticed the light of hope in his eyes before Jet looked behind him as Zac stormed off. Jet winced, knowing that it was not going to be a good night. On top of lying to him, Zac now had people questioning him. Phil and Clint seemed to notice and for a moment they shared a dark look.
"Yes. However, you wouldn't have to go through that if you were willing to take your jumper off for a moment." He said as he was commenting about the weather. Jet stiffened before his eyes narrowed.
"I can't figure out what it wrong with it. I looked it over twice. Nothing seems to be wrong with it." Those words were laced with so much anger it was hard to imagine what the true issue was. Jet looked intrigued. He liked things that were complicated. He gave Zac a look and the man just waved him over to the car. Jet flashed him a boyish grin before walking over to car. Jet could practically feel Zac at his back. He ignored it in favor of getting into the car. He, too found nothing wrong with the car.
"Whats my last name?"
"Ah! Jet of the Snow. Come, join us. I wish for you to meet two people." Thor said in a booming voice. Jet paused, looking around the diner. Jet eyed him wearily before walking to Jane. He kept his eyes on her, not wanting to see the looks of disappointment that could come from the two blonds. He stopped in front of the table.
The scene they came upon was not what they had been expecting to see. Sure everything was burnt, and there were pieces of metal and circuitry all over the place. But there were no body parts. There was no body. Nothing. Steve walked up the face plate. He picked it up and brushed the dirt and the bits of rock. He turned it over, finding some blood on it, but not at all the amount he had expected. He stood there, looking as the Avengers and SHEILD agents moved around to pick up the pieces. He held the face plate like it was a life line. Tony's body was missing. No one could find any evidence of his body ever being present. They found only car tracks leaving the area. SHEILD was sending agents to follow the tracks.
Natasha patted him on his arm, rubbing her thumb over his bicep before walking off. Steve was still standing off to one side, out of Tony's line of vision. The other man walked up to him, reaching out to place a hand on Tony's shoulder.
"Sir, he is flatlining"
"I will do my best to protect it Tony." His voice was strong and solid. Tony squeezed his hand for a moment before he looked up into Steve's eyes. Blue met brown. There was something in Tony's eyes. Something he had only seen once before in his life. Tony shifted and licked his lips for a moment.
"What are you doing here, Stark?" He asked in a serious tone. Tony was doing something with his phone before he looked up and took another sip off his coffee. He moved his arm in a sweeping motion about the room.
Tony felt his stomach roll in protest as all the wrong type of thoughts pressed in around his mind. He tossed back the drink, ignoring the feeling of triumph that rolled over his skin. He could hear everyone's thoughts pressing in around him still. This wasn't good. Not good at all. He stood up and cursed as he swayed. He had drank enough to drown it all out. Yet it seemed his abilities had officially surpassed the point where alcohol could numb them. He had been expecting it for some time, but certainly not now. Not when he needed a sense of clarity and stillness. He couldn't do it. He couldn't stop it. He felt the inky darkness the man across the room was exuding from his body. It out weighed all the other thoughts and feelings that were in the room.
It was obvious to anyone that watched that Tony was Banner's best friend. They spoke about things that no other man could understand. They both seemed to enjoy how much they just understood one another. Tony understood Bruce needed someone who wasn't afraid to poke fun at him, taunt him and just be a friend to him. Bruce understood how much Tony needed affection and someone to just be around. It was one of the reasons why Tony asked Bruce to stay in Stark tower with him after the renovations were done. While Tony used the fact they had a huge lab that Bruce could use, a huge plus, Bruce used being in a companionable atmosphere as a reason to move in. Tony never made Bruce feel like he was an outsider.
"So, Stark. Why am I needed for this?" Natasha asked, finally speaking up. Tony grinned at her.
"They want me back, their project ." Tony said, moving towards the other end of the bike, preparing to put his hands up and surrender. Steve getting hurt was not something he wanted to be responsible for. Yet, Steve had other ideas. The blond reach out and yanked Tony roughly back to him, keeping him hidden behind the bike.
"Pleasure." The voice is wrong, his mind hissed for a moment before growing silent again "And yeah, we still need another mechanic. We are swapped right now as it is. Any extra hands would be great." Zac said with a charming smile. Jet felt his lips quirk about at. Harold smacked Zac and Jet on the shoulders, laughing.
"Come now, Capsicle. Surely you don't think I or even Natasha would allow anyone but you to reveal your secret identity, do you? After quite a bit of money and some….words with Natasha the story seemed to have vanished." He said with a grin. Tony pulled back, this time Steve let him, and patted him on his arms again.
"Okay, out with it. What is so exciting?" Steve asked, genuinely curious but he did not want to give the other man the satisfaction of knowing.
"Wet them" Steve said, his tone getting huskier each passing moment. Tony complied happily. He wrapped his lips around those fingers, running his tongue over the pads of those fingers, tasting the leather of the bike and Steve there. He sucked and worked them, treating them the way he would Steve's cock if he had the chance. Steve watched with blown out pupils before removing them from Tony's mouth and returning them to their original position.
"Tony." He whispered to himself.
"What?" Tony asked with a frown. He was starting to feel angry for some reason. He couldn't place it but he was just feeling so…angry. His brows knitted together as he struggled to place his anger, but it was slowly consuming him. It was weird. It was unnatural and it was growing.
Tony worked through the night and well into the next day. He was working on a making it so that his tablet's camera could see the waves as well. That way he had a set of goggles on his at all times without it actually being goggles. He finished right at noon the next day. Steve was still out of it. It was normal. Tony knew people who were out for weeks after spending that many days with the bands on. Tony was getting ready to leave when he felt…something. It was a strange tugging sensation. He looked at Steve, startled. The man was still asleep. It had been a glorious feeling. Because for a moment, the outside noise was gone. No one's thoughts and emotions. Nothing. For a split second he had peace. But now they flooded back in. Tony staggered, shaking his head to re-acclimate himself to the normal level of noise that came from the Helicarrier.
"Uh..Thanks? Wait, who is this?"
"I am Ironman" He whispered, causing Hawkeye and Widow to pause in their actions. They sent Steve quick look. Steve stared at Tony with a serious look. Tony lifted his chin, daring the man to deny it. Steve just looked to Hawk and Window, nodding at them. They loaded the men into the car, leaving SHEILD to clean up the area. Steve stood in front of the ramp leading into the jet. He stared at Tony.
In the shower he found his body was riddled with scars and fading bruises. There were old wounds all over his body. But that wasn't what shocked him. It was the thing in his chest that shocked the hell out of him. It emitted a bright blue light. He had touched it tentatively, wondering what it was. He tried to removed it, but fear gripped him. His mind screamed out at him. He let go, allowing the machine to click back into place. It keeps me alive, his mind whispered. He did not understand why that was. Or what it was, but he did not touch it again. He made no plans to show it to anyone either. No, if it was that important, it had to be hidden.
Jet froze as he processed all that he over heard. It was radio communications between the people in the diner. What if...What if it was a trap to get him because of his abilities? His heart hurt so bad at the idea the nameless man was out to get him. No...no that man meant safety to him. He...he couldn't be the one who hurt him. He just couldn't. Or else it would break Jet. He sat on the bed, holding his head in his hands as he just rested there, trying to gather himself. That man...it was him. It was him. It was the man from his dream in real life. His heart was racing like never before. He craved being near him. Oh god he ran like a little girl away from them. But if he was honest with himself, it had been overwhelming in that moment.
He struggled to get up, struggled to sit up on the bed. Tony wanted to get to the source of that feeling. He wanted for his own. It was his. He needed it to survive. He was upright when he heard commotion outside the door. Suddenly the door slam open. He looked up startled. There, in the door way was Steve Rogers. Those blue eyes flashed with desire, needed, want, fear, and there was a deep feral look to them. Tony stared before he just reached out his hand, subconsciously knowing that Steve was his source of peace. His means of sanity and his Perfect Match.
"If you wouldn't mind parting with them, I would be grateful."
"I am aware. He was deemed as a narcissist, an alcoholic and was not fit to be in a team setting." He said, reciting off the things that he had read from the file. Or rather the profile section of the file.
"You've been a sleep Cap'. For almost seventy years." Steve felt like he had been punched in the gut. He looked around, feeling even more ill at this. He knew, deep in his heart that everyone he knew was likely dead. He was…alone. He felt something break inside him.
"Look, I am sorry about the show back there. We thought it best to break it to you slowly
Contentment. Joy. Happiness. Love. Compassion. Loyalty. Honor. Sadness. Longing. Confusion. DESIRE
"Liar, I can see you sweating." She shot back easily, her brow raised now. Jet looked back at her before pulling his arm back and placing his hand on the edge of the hood. He gave her a narrow glare.
"Jet? You awake yet?" Zac's voice called through the door, a twinge of irritation in the tone.. Jet let out a soft sigh, heading to the door. He paused only to yank on a thick cotton shirt over his head. He had found it in one of the drawers. He figured it was left over from Harold. He opened the door, disregarding the fact his lower half was wrapped in a towel.
"But what if it wasn't a memory? What if it was something else?" Tony asked in a soft tone, not wanting to ruin the moment. He liked being in Steve's arms. Steve pulled back and looked down at him, sincere concern still there. Tony felt a little but bad about not telling him.
"With what? A substance? Those never worked on me. I can't even get drunk."
Bruce said in a some what happy tone. As if it was a joke. Steve looked confused.
Tony sat up slowly, moving so that Steve could keep his hand on the blue light. He leaned over and paused right before their lips could meet. Tony's brown eyes searched Steve's eyes for any hesitation or uncertainty. Then their lips touched again, hesitantly at first. Soon they were kissing slowly, taking their time to learn the taste and feel of each other's mouths. It surprised Steve that Tony did nothing more than kiss him, moving slowly and just taking it all in. Steve pulled back and used his other hand to stroke over the side of Tony's face.
"You’re nothing but a bully Stark. And on top of that you’re a disappointment to everything your father was" Steve said in turn. Something fluttered across Stark's face before that cocky smirk appeared on his lips. He watched as Stark just saunter off and mentally cursed. He couldn't believe that once again he was getting into it with Stark. It was like the first time they met all over again. He pushed his hand through his hair and turned around only to stop in his tracks. There stood Natasha and Bruce. Banner's eyes and skin had a light green color to them. Steve stood a little straighter, unsure as to what was bothering the Doctor. Natasha reached out and grabbed Bruce's arm, squeezing it.
Tony smiled, glad that he did not get too much of a fight from either of them on this. They wanted Steve to be ok as much as SHEILD did. That meant finding him a match, someone to curb the input that Steve was constantly getting from the outside world. He glanced once more at the Super Solider before he just went back to working. He knew that Steve would be in and out as his mind worked to repair the damage. Tony felt…nothing being in the same room as Steve. He hadn't before either. He figured that was because the man had been wearing the bands even then. But now? Now he was band less, yet Tony's waves didn't react to Steve's. That meant that even though the Super Solider had strong waves, Tony still surpassed him. Tony let out a sigh, knowing that if Captain America's waves couldn't match his in strength, then who's could?
"That still doesn't help me with the phone and the constant confusion." Steve muttered against Tony's hair. He did not know why he kept holding onto Tony. He figured it was because he needed to hold onto someone and Tony was there. Plus, if the man was affection starved it seemed like it would be no problem for Tony if he just gave into his desire to hold someone. Plus who else could he do this to? No one. No one but Tony.
To: Pep   From: Tony
"Not much. Just that it is a way to help Sentinels find the right Guide for them"
"It's fine. I mean I bet I wasn't the nicest person either without my coffee." He said, trying to ease the man's anxiety. He did not know why it mattered so much, but he wanted this man to like him. It hurt to think he did not like Jet. It hurt really bad, but at times his mind kept telling him over and over again the voice and eyes were wrong. All wrong. WRONG! But Jet ignored it. He was alone and he desperately wanted someone that triggered the sense of joy that Zac did. He knew that was a bad thing, but he couldn't help it at all.
"Because he isn't a regular person"
"Yeah, I am ready." He said in an uneasy tone. He wasn't really sure if he was, but he wanted it. He wanted to have what the cuffs had once gave him. He wanted someone to call his own. Wanted someone to care of and protect. That is what he always wanted, what he always dreamed of. Pepper gave him a fond smile before she raised the tablet up and took a snap shot of Steve's aura. She set the tablet back down on her lap. She mad eit go through all the waves she had gathered in the last three days.
"It is not safe to tell you that yet. But I promise you that you are him and when we know it is safe, we will tell you." Steve said, his eyes never leaving Zac. There was something tense about Steve, as if he did not like Zac. Which did not make much sense to him. Maybe there was something he was missing, though that was doubtful since he had a plethora of knowledge as well as instant access to any database he could think about. Steve took a sip off his coffee before he stood and gave Zac a nod and Jet a smile. There was a strange thud for a moment which Steve seemed to over look.
"Very Well Sir." The screen lit up and images were filling the page. JARVIS began at the beginning and Steve listened to how the world had become the way it was today.
"Stop. Whatever you are thinking about. Whatever you are worried about, we can fix it. We will fix it and it will be okay. I promise you, We will help you with anything." He said in a serious tone. Jet felt like this was not the first time Steve talked to him like this. It was almost a sense of deja vu going on. Jet wanted nothing more than to lean over and kiss that serious mouth. But he held himself back. He did not want to find out that they had been broken up for a while and came to be friends. With all the dreams he had been having before their arrival, he deeply wished that to be not true. Instead he just smiled a bit.
They lapsed into silence. There was nothing either of them wanted to say it seemed. They got to the shop and just set into working on all of the ATVs that had come in this morning. It seemed that things were looking up. Zac came over and leaned against the car that came in, abandoning the problematic mini van that he had been working on. Jet looked up and froze when he noticed the man staring at him. Zac reached over and ran his finger down the side of Jet's neck. A shiver of pleasure ran down his spine. It felt so good, that he didn't noticed that Zac's finger was rubbing over the burn the seatbelt had inflicted. Zac leaned in, making Jet lean in a bit as well. It felt good. That simple touch and he wanted more. He found himself drawn to the affection the man was giving him.
'Hessuchandasswhothefuckisthi sOHMYGODITSTONYSTARKthatdeat hdealingasshole.'
Coulson was ushering Tony into the building. Tony was still very drunk and still in a spiral, though considerably slower spiral now. Tony let out a soft groan as his mind was immediately blankets by a series of shields and emptiness. It seemed that this wasn't going to be so bad. Tony stumbled and fell into a bed that Coulson seemed to have produced. Or was it he was finally to the room? It didn't matter much to him any more. His mind was struggling to process everything. There was echoes in his mind. Residual feelings and thoughts bouncing around in his mind from earlier. If he wasn't a genius and if he wasn't a strong guide, he would have already succumb to the Spiral. But because of those things, he was able to push it off some. He was able to process the information faster, but no fast enough to stop it. His eyes tightened as pain crept down his head to his spine. He gripped the sheets and whimpered.
"Jane"

"Anything, Tony. We will take you home. We can leave whenever you want." Steve whispered against the back of his neck. Tony took those words and held onto them tightly. He was going to hold Steve to that. He knew without having to ask that Steve would make sure he got home. He pulled away reluctantly. He looked around the room, only to find the door laying half hazardly on the floor. He raised a brow and looked at Steve. He expected Steve to look sheepish about destroying the door. Instead the man looked as if it didn't matter, as if he didn't care that he just kicked a door off it's hinges. Tony felt a little warm at that, though he knew he shouldn't. He licked his bottom lip before speaking.
Tony looked at the serious look. Okay, maybe it would get a little worse before it got better.
"It is not really strange when you think about it. The bracelets suppress the Sentinels senses. It could easily also suppress the natural wave. Ever since the bracelet's creation, we knew that long term wear would trigger the Oblivion state. It wouldn't be hard to draw the conclusion that the bracelet's suppression of the natural wave causes that wave to act in strange ways. The body would want to correct this altered wave in order to return to normal, which could very well be the Oblivion state." Bruce said in a even tone. That man was painfully shy, for good reasons, but it was nice to know that Bruce was willing to tell them about this. It was a known fact that the Guide was very close friends with Tony, or closer then Clint.
"I don't know what you mean." She said cautiously.
He looked over to the door where Tony had retreated. He swallowed as the feeling of bile coating his throat overcame him. Had he made Tony feel like he had to run and hide in his own home? He stuffed his hands into his pockets and walked to the elevator, feeling like the world's biggest ass. On his floor, he threw himself down on his bed and scrubbed a hand over his face. He did not understand what was going on. He did not understand why it was always Tony that caused him to be such a mean person. He was never like that with anyone else. Just Tony.
He stopped just outside the door, people shouting around him. Window ordering people to stand down, Coulson doing the same but none of that matter. Steve yanked the door open and stood there, stunned. There in the bed was Tony, who looked ruffled and out of sorts, but very much alive. He had been so focused on getting to Tony, that he didn't even notice that he felt things in moderation. None of that matter, because Tony was there…reaching out to him. He strode across the man, desperate to grab a hold of that hand. He knew he no longer had to long for that hand, the hand of his Perfect Match. It was there. He grasped it, mindful of his strength. It felt like everything fell into place. The last puzzle piece was in place and now he could finally see the entire picture. A future for himself that wasn't riddled with loneliness, pain and imperfect bonds.
"I can't tell you that. For now, just be satisfied with your first name, You are a genius, I know. It wouldn't take you very long to figure the rest out. But please…just be satisfied with that. Its for your protection" Steve reached over and laid his hand over's Tony's. That sense of peace came over him full force. That touch was positively sinful. It had a way of just…settling him. Making things okay.
"Bruce…I…I got a…no never mind. The alcohol isn't working. I'm on the edge of a spiral" That was all he had to say. Bruce muttered a curse before shifting his phone to shoot off a text to Coulson. Not that he needed to since Clint was now staring off at a wall, clearly communicating with Phil. It was strange to know that was possible with Perfect Matches. Pepper seemed to have recovered in record time, already on her phone making the proper arrangements for the safe house. Natasha vanished after telling Steve she was going to the jet ready to head out.
"If you think you could fix it, sure. Uh, I am Harold by the way." The man said, putting the wretch in his left hand to offer his right. He hesitated, thinking quickly of a name before grasping the other man's hand.
"Cum for me." Steve said in a dark purr. Tony felt his entire body tighten as if it was struck by lightening. He came into tight rope onto the bed as his inner walls tightened around Steve's fingers. Steve groaned a bit, climaxing himself from the feel of Tony clenching around him. He wasn't ashamed of it either. There was something addicting about seeing Tony come undone because of him. Tony laid pliant on the bed. Steve removed his fingers, wiping them on the edge of the bed before gathering Tony into his arms. The smaller man hummed before snuggling deeper into Steve. Steve couldn't help but place a kiss on the man's forehead. It felt right to have Tony back in his arms once again. And if he had his way he would keep the man there for the rest of their days.
"Really? How?"
Steve's hand shot out and smacked the coffee out of Tony's hand. For a moment it felt good to destroy something. There was a twist in his heart at hearing that his lease was up - yeah right, Fury pulled string on that one. The control over his life was being taken from him. He was being stripped of his autonomy to move freely, to build a life for himself. And Tony, of all people, Tony being the one to deliver the news was too much. The man was loud, talked too much, moved too fast, it was all too much. Tony Stark, maker of the 21st century, standing in the one place Steve tried to carve out as his own, telling him that Steve had to move into the tower. This was the last straw. He had been at the end of his rope before this, with the Nightmares, the constant influx of new information and strange scenery. He was constantly reminded how alone and out of place he was. Tony was only mad it worst. He stood to his full height towering over the man, all while a piece of him screamed that he was lashing out. That this was wrong, but Tony was convenient, Tony was an intruder, Tony
In the 21st century, Steve was an outsider. He knew that well. No Friends, No Family, and No Allies. While he had the Avengers, it became clear rather quickly that he wasn't welcomed there either.  Bruce and Stark were Science-Bro, a term coined by Barton, that could talk for hours in a language that sometimes didn't sound like English. Clint and Natasha were attached to each other's hips. When Thor wasn't in Asgard, he was with Jane. So who did he have? No one, that’s who. In order to avoid the blaring reality he was forced to face, he jumped on his motorcycle the moment Loki was off the planet and just drove off towards nowhere.
"So, you are really good with cars it seems." Harold said with a grin on his lips. Jet's eyes narrowed a fraction, going unnoticed by anyone in the room. He was already trying to figure out what Harold wanted from him.
"Stark."
"J.A.R.V.I.S Code: Sierra Tango Echo Victor Echo 1-9-4-0."
"Affirmative. Is it...?" A voice called from the sleeve. There was a small hesitation there. Jet felt something clench in him at that voice. Like he heard it before. He looked at the diner like it was going to kill him to go inside. He noticed that Vanessa was there. He took a deep breath, waiting. Phil looked at him, giving him a once over before speaking into the microphone again.
22APR2019 - Full Chapter Edit
"Relax, stupid. I am not going to say anything." The man said, his arms like steel bands around Jet. He struggled for a moment, trying not to give in as the man's hand rubbed up and down his back. He wanted to melt into those touches, but the man had discovered his secret. Or at least one of them. He was still tense in Zac's arms, but eventually he caved to the affection. He melted into Zac's arms, letting out a soft sigh as Zac led him to sit on the bed. Zac sat beside him and began to run his fingers through his hair. Jet just melted even more. It felt soo good to have this kind of touch. Simple and easy. Nothing more then that.
"I do not like hearing about those closest to me having problems that I can fix. To hear you say you don't fit in, is unnerving because it makes me wonder if you will leave one day." Tony said in a muffled tone. Steve pat Tony's shoulders, figuring this came from the fact that Howard had been less than a perfect father and the abandonment issues Tony had. He finally got around to reading Tony's file. It was as enlightening as the conversation with the other Avengers.
"Yeah…Like this." Tony said in a breathless voice. So maybe their relationship was not dead after all. His pulse raced as he wondered if Steve was going to reenact the dream. He licked his lips, feeling his cock jump at the idea of doing just that. Oh he hoped so.
"...Who? You?" Steve asked, trying not to get his hopes up. Clint just rolled his eyes at this.
Steve could only stare at Fury in disbelief and hurt when the man suggested they all return to the tower. All but him, Steve thought darkly as he schooled his features into blankness. The look Fury sent him just before leaving the room told Steve that he hadn't fooled the One-eyed man. Steve waited for everyone to leave the room before he followed after them. Only to find Mary Hill standing just outside the room, apparently waiting for him.
"You ok? You were calling out my name. Did you remember something?" Steve asked, concern laced in that tone. Tony let out a jerky laugh, his body still shaking with unsatiated lust. He shook his head, curling his legs up to his chest. He…he couldn't dare tell Steve about the erotic dreams he was having about him. What if they were broken up? What if they were just friends and the dreams were just erotic fantasies?
"You look tired." Zac's voice whispered for a moment. Jet gave him a lazy smile for a second before he finished up the problem he was working on before he pulled back and smiled at Zac.
"Project? Tony, what are you talking about?" Steve asked, his phone making noise in his pocket. Tony struggled to get free, just imagining Steve shot was freaking him out.
"Tony Stark is your Perfect Match" Natasha said in a cool tone. Steve stared at her before he jerked off the bed and snatched up the tablet. He had to see this for himself. He couldn't believe it.
"All you have to do is say the word. All you have to do is say it and it will all be over." The whispered words sent pleasure coursing through his veins. It also sent chills down his spine. There was a darkness and a hatred there. He licked his lips uneasily. That tone, he couldn't believe he was hearing it from those lips. Yet, Jet wanted nothing more then to kiss that mouth. The mouth that haunted his dream. But before he could complete that thought, Steve pulled back. It completely escaped his mind that the Steve never answered the question. The man stepped out of his space and gave a fleeting smile for a moment, as if he hadn't just implied murder.
"So I understand that Tony is affection starved and vulnerable. But he doesn't leave me alone, even when I tell him to. Why is that? Huh? Why won't he leave me alone?" He asked, knowing he was getting defensive and trying to make it seem like this was all Tony's fault.
"I don't tell you everything. Figured you don't to want to be around me when I am being pathetic." Jet snapped before he stormed out of the garage. He told Marco he was taking the rest of the day off. The man did not seem to care since there were no more jobs to be done. He continued to walk quickly, ignoring the sound of shoes following him.
"I...don't know what to say to that. What do you think my chances are?" Steve asked, wondering how much data could have been culminated since the beginning of the project.
"Go ahead. I already had a cup. I figured you would need two this morning." Steve said with a boyish grin...that did not quit reach his eyes. Jet noticed that Steve's eyes flickered from his face to the bruises on his body. He said nothing. If he tried to hide them then that would draw even more attention to them. So he left it alone in favor of the coffee.
"How…lonely it must get. But he does not seem to care about those he calls friends." Steve hedged, not asking but knowing that they would correct his assumption. Bruce and Pepper shared a smile before laughing. Even Natasha smiled a bit. Which was scary to see.
He came to understand that, when one night Tony reached up and grabbed his hand and placed it over the arch reactor. Steve looked away from the TV to look down at Tony. He noticed how Tony had a light tremble to his body. His hand seemed content to just press Steve's large hand against the arch reactor. Steve's thumb shifted and rubbed the edge of the device carefully, noticing how shaken Tony looked. It was like he was struggling to over come something. He continued to stroke his thumb over the edge of the reactor, waiting for Tony to speak and explain. Eventually the mild tremors vanished.
"Most people forget I am an engineer with dexterous fingers and the ability to slip screws out of tight spots easily. Taking this out of the hands of a super solider gone mad, child's play. Well almost. So whats up Cap? What's got you so….riled up?" Tony asked in a casual tone as he spun the phone around and effortlessly ended the sound that was coming from the phone. Steve stared at the phone, another reminder of how much Tony belonged in this world while he did not. He balled this hands into fists.
Tony skipped the last couple of stairs to his workshop. He wanted to get this project set up before handing it off to the one person he knew was capable of handling it. Over the years Pepper had not gotten enough credit for all the things she did. So this time he was going to give her control over a world changing project. He already got the Council for the Society of Enhanced Humans to back up the project. He also used some of his own personal money to ensure the project went off without a hitch. He already had two pairs of the goggles in circulation. One on the East coast and the other on the west coast. For the last couple of hours, Sentinels and the Guides from all over were gathering together in mixers and having their aura scanned. The data was being sent, instantaneously to JARVIS.
"Take care of him, please. I-I have to return to work today. I have a meeting in order to clear all this up. Once again, I am cleaning up your mess" She said to him in a playful tone before she walked out, Natasha following after her. Jet sat there for a moment before looking at Steve once more.
"Your name is Tony." Steve finally said. Jet felt a sense of exhilaration. Tony. Tony. It felt so right. It made him feel….so right.
"Y~yes! Steve!" Tony said, whimpering as those fingers began to work him so well. It was obvious that Steve knew how to please him, because he was dripping with pleasure. Tony was pushing back, fucking himself on those fingers, moving with Steve. Pleasure course through his veins like molten steel. Each push of Steve's fingers hit his prostate, sending more pleasure through him.
Steve comes to a conclusion
"You must have a death wish to even consider saying, let alone thinking that, in the same room as Natasha." The archer said in a whisper. Steve was taken back, unsure as to how the spy knew what he was about to say. A wave of guilt washed over him when he realized that he had been about to make another mistake with his team. He felt grateful to Clint for preventing him for furthering the distance between him and his team. He cleared his throat, deciding that was a better way to break into the scene. A safer way at least.
"Sir, Mr. Stark left you an advanced pair of cuffs for you. They are on the night stand beside the bed." JARVIS said. Steve paused before laughing softly. He had not even thought of asking if JARVIS could locate a store to get them. It seemed that he owed a lot to Howard's son. The man had given him not only a way to learn how the rest of the world way fairing, but also a way to live in the world without going insane. He walked into the room and found a pair of thin looking cuffs. He put them on and hissed as he felt something crawl over his skin. It moved along all parts of his body. With in a matter of moments it was over. While the feeling of being cold was still there, everything else was gone.
"Clint is right, it is a good thing you don't know who we are looking for. Natasha said that you are very...particular about your chest." Phil said, stepping into Jet space. Jet was tense and in turn Clint was, but Phil seemed completely at ease.
"He's not going to make it!" A monotonous male voice said, piercing through his screaming that was echoing off the walls.
"Coulson, get Stark. Rogers is spiraling out of control." The tone was biting and hard. Steve couldn't focus on it long because everything was just becoming greater and greater. His mind struggled to overcome it all. They were on the Helicarrier, so everything made more noise and everything smelt like ozone, gasoline, grease, sweat, life, death and on and on and on. His mind struggle to categorize the sudden in flux of information. He felt like his mind was going to fracturing and splintering off into pieces as it struggled to process everything. He was about to succumb to the madness when he felt something dim the rough edges of everything. It wasn't enough though. There was the sound of cursing someone muttering about being too far away. Quickly the dulling of his senses spread from the edges closer and closer to the core of himself. His mind was still struggling to catch up on everything, but how much was lessen each passing moment. Soon there was nothing. Well not nothing, but all the sensations that came from outside the room vanished. All he could hear was footsteps walking in a quick pace towards the room. Clint let out a sigh, clearly glad to feel the madness abate from Steve's mind. Steve was confused but the answer came from when Tony entered the room. His deep brown eyes were focused on Steve and he couldn't help but blush a bit under the man's intense stare. Everything felt more settled. His mind was no longer going into madness but it was still struggling to rewire all the damage he had caused himself.
It was suppose to be a routine mission. Dr. Doom and his doom bots were causing all sort of Chaos on Manhattan island. The Avengers were called. Yet, the mission turned out to be anything but ordinary. The doom bots had been upgraded to be able specialized for each of the Avengers. While Tony was able to, spur of the moment, rework the Iron man suit to function under the electromagnetic waves that were being thrown his way. The other Avengers were not so lucky. They had been fighting for hours. The doom bots seemed relentless and Dr. Doom was doing something that Tony knew would alter the world forever. That is when Tony decided to take everything in. Take in the entire situation and pray for a plan of action.
After the talk with Natasha, Pepper and Bruce it had took a couple of days for his brain to acclimate to the new version of Tony. But eventually he caught on to what they had been saying. It started with Clint returning from a mission, limping and clearly in pain, muttering about how he broke his bow. Two days later, Tony came barreling up the stairs with a new bow in his hand. He tossed it at the couch, where Clint caught it one handed. The reason Tony made it? Because Coulson had complained about how Clint was getting rusty. Which was an outright lie. Coulson would never say that about Clint, because it wasn't true. Tony had lied to cover up the fact he spent the last two days, without eating or sleeping, making a bow for the archer. A specialized bow that had all the bells and whistles. Then there was Natasha's knives and guns, Thor's...Thor proof phone and Bruce's decked out lab equipment.
Sure, whenever there was a world crisis that needed the Avengers, he would do his duty and help. But after the mission was done, debriefs and reports handed in, everyone would split off - Stark with Bruce, Clint with Natasha, and Thor off to see Jane. He would be left to get back on his bike and head back on the road - no direction, no destination, just himself and the freedom of the open road with loneliness riding bitch. Every time, he couldn't help but wonder - What was the point? Sure they were a team, but beyond that one Shawarma meal, they were just a team of convenience. At least that is what he thought.
Again this is unedited and in it's original format from FF.net
"Then I guess I will have to gaurd it for you then. I will make sure that no one takes this from you again. I will protect it." Steve said with conviction. He would protect Tony, because slowly but surely the man became important in Steve's life. He would hate to think about where he would be if he did not have Tony in his life. Tony looked up at him, hope clear in those eyes, but they were still gaurded.
"Mr. Snow. I am sure you are wondering why we are here this early in the morning." Natasha said in a cool tone. Jet looked at her before pointing a finger at her.
Jamie killed herself after the next miscarriage. At the ripe age of 46, Howard went out to find another woman to marry. He found Maria Cerrera, who was 26 years his junior. Not that it matter to her. She was after his money and name, to increase her own career as a scientist, he was after a heir. But there was a catch. Maria was not a Sentinel, so she could not keep Howard from spiraling down into a deep depression which he used alcohol as a means to cover. That is the life Anthony Stark was born to. He was born to an alcoholic Guide and a mother who was emotionally vacant. Tony struggled to try and gain some kind of affection and love from his parents, but he got none. This would have destroyed a regular child, but Anthony Stark was no ordinary child. He was basically an amplified version of his father. His intelligence and his abilities as a Guide were far greater than his father's.
"Rogers, I am sure you are aware that before entering this team, Tony Stark was not accepted as a possible candidate to the program." She paused, giving him time to agree. She was making sure his knowledge covered certain areas.
Jet shook his head and left his apartment. He stopped in place and let out a frustrated sigh when he noticed that Zac's car was no where to be seen. Obviously the man was still man at him for lying to him. He rubbed the back of his neck, figuring that he could always hitch a ride with the waitress, Vanessa, from the diner. He pulled out his phone and rang her. She was more then happy to help him it seemed, which was a huge relief. He walked down to the ground level, pausing when he noticed two vehicles that he had never seen before. One motorcycle that looked absolutely amazing and one black town car. Both were out of place in ATV world, so it meant that new people were around. While he wanted to conclude that that meant they were Thor's friends, he couldn't assume that. If only because a motorcycle and a town car were not likely to make a drive from outside the state to their town that quickly.
He laid there till he finally decided to get out of the bed. He got ready for work, glad that he had something physical to keep himself busy. He knew that he wouldn't be able to do nothing but think for hours on end. No, he needed something to do. Plus working on cars made him feel like he was at home in a way. It wasn't exactly the same, but for the most part he felt like it was enough. That is what his life was going to be for a while. Making things into more then they should be in order to feel some form of contentment.
"Are any of these Tony's favorite kind of chips? They all look like the others' favorite flavors." He asked, trying to smoothly ask for the information he need. There was a long pause. He looked over his shoulder, finding Bruce giving him a calculated look before a small smile adorned the weathered doctor's face. Bruce pointed to a bag of kettle cooked chips with cracked pepper. He felt a blush creep over his neck as he pulled the chips down and poured some on top of the plate. He heard the fridge close behind him. Bruce set down two large water bottles before him
"I…I can't keep doing this. I am tried of being an outsider. I am tired of this fast pace world I have to live in." He said in a snarl. Tony looked taken back for a moment before he set the phone down on the side table. He walked up to the distressed Captain. He grabbed the man's forearms, staring at him.
He knew he knew this place, even if his mind could not bring up the memories of this place. He felt so at peace here; welcomed. He was so lost in the feeling of the place that he didn't see the looks on the other people's faces. Natasha looked relieved and happy, though if anyone asked her about it she would simply shrug it off as a trick of light caused by the setting sun. Clint was grinning like a mad man, as if he had just pulled off the greatest shot ever. Steve looked very similar to Natasha only….there was something else there… A bit of longing and fear. But Tony missed all this as he just stood there, looking off at the setting sun before he clapped his hands together.
"I am JARVIS. Agent Lucas informed you of my abilities. However, Mr. Stark had added…extra features to this Television set in order to make your stay more comfortable."
"It is mostly Tony's fault, he is very good at hiding away from everyone. It even took me several years to figure out what was actually going on." Pepper said in a soft tone, though there was a hint of regret. He never figured out what caused them to break up. Natasha turned to Pepper and touched the other woman's hand. It was done in such a familiar way that it made Steve tense up. Could Natasha...
Tony's felt a spear of exhilaration push through him. Wave after wave of positive emotions washed over Tony as Steve's lips mapped out his. Tony returned the soft kiss, tasting his Match. Suddenly, it was like a switch had been flipped because the kiss went from soft and savoring, to passionate and aggressive. The desire to possess and mark hit Tony from both sides. His own desires and Steve's.
That is how he ended up sitting at some strange person's table with a cup of lemonade in his hand.
"It would seem that you have a tiny nano bits inside you. I don't have access to their codes, since JARVIS is being blocked form your end. The bots have, some how, reconstructed your body. You look younger and physically you are. Your muscles are stronger. Overall they have made you a younger, fitter and stronger version of you." Bruce said, giving Tony a shy smile as he flipped the scans over so Tony no longer had to read them backwards. Tony let out a small huh of intrigue.
"TONY!" Tony jerked upright. He let out a gasp, looking around wild-eyed. Steve was sitting on the edge of the bed, looking concerned. Tony gulped down air. He was shaking a bit. His skin was overly sensitive still. He could feel the heat wafting off of Steve's body. That rich scent that accompanied the heat was not helping.
"Mornin' Cap." The genius said, a saluting with his cup. Steve stared at the other man. It had been a month and a half since their last interaction. They hadn’t even worked together since then. Most times Iron Man, Widow and Hawkeye went out on missions together while Thor, Hulk and himself went out on others. This was the first time he had seen the man in person, not in passing, in a while. Steve had spent a lot of time thinking upon what he had said to Tony and the reactions he got from the other members of his team. Steve walked cautiously into the living area before walking to his door. He found the lock was not broken, but rather skillfully picked. He was not surprised the genius could do such a thing. He crossed his arms and leaned against the door frame of the front door, staring Tony down.
Jet jerked awake only to feel a hand settle on top of the machine in his chest. He reactor before he could think. He jerked away only to be shoved to the floor roughly by those hands.
MSG: No, she is not busy. What do you want Tony? Is Steve ok?
"How about you tell me what it is you are doing and how long you think it will take you to finish, for my sandwich and the water bottle?"
"Stop trying to fight me you pathetic fool. You can stand for that man touching it but you won't allow me to do the same. You can't even remember him but you know me. What the hell Jet?" Zac asked before he ripped away from Jet and walked to the kitchen. Jet got up on all fours, coughing a bit before standing up carefully. Zac was not a person he liked to fight with because the man was stronger by far and he wasn't used to the intensity of the blows that Zac dished out. While the pain was not as strong as it could be, it still hurt like a bitch. It even hurt more whenever he turned over and caught a quick glimpse at Zac. Sometime, for a moment, he looked like Steve and the pain was even worse. Then it vanished when he realize just how wrong everything was. He stood before Zac before walking to him, wincing.
He made sure he was all clean and ready to go, wearing his recently washed jumper. He wanted to be sure that Zac was not late for his job. Zac seems not to be a morning person at all. He was brash, snarly and cruel. He always made snide smart ass remarks whenever Jet asked a question that seemed obvious to the other man. Jet learned by the end of the ride to the shop, to not to question Zac. Jet was glad that Marco seemed nice and glad to have help. Marco ran through a series of issues that could happen to a car and tested Jet on what he would do to fix it. Jet seemed to pass, because he was given another jump suit with the company logo on it and told to get to work.
Letting out a frustrated sigh he decided to use his…mind power to figure somethings out. He focused on that part of his mind that connected him to the endless stream of information. He started with searching for Amnesia and the time it would take to recover. A sudden stream of information came in. He found that there was a chance he would never fully regain his memories. The probability was that his amnesia came from trauma, a deduction that was relatively easy to come to. His search drew up an article that talked about Dream recollection. It stated that memories could sometimes be recalled when a person entered the REM cycle. The mind would use it as a means to reinstate old memories. The only issue with this form of recollection was that the memories came back without a true sense of time. They were just floating memories that had no time attached to them.
"At Ease Solider." A solid voice called. There were Guides in the men with the guns. He could feel each of them trying to ease the sensation coming at him from all around. He was grateful that they were blocking out all the inputs that were coming at him. Though it reminded him that he required that many people to block out some of the things that were coming at him. The man walked to him, with the strange grace of a tiger. He knew the man was a Sentinel, with experience but not at the same level as himself.
"Just make it look like it is yours and you have a question, he will 'steal' your food for the answer." Bruce said, clearly seeing through Steve's plan. He scratched the back of his neck, not believing he had been that transparent. Then again the man was a Genius. He nodded and picked up the water bottles, heading to Tony's workshop. He walked down the workshop, the door automatically opened and the blaring music cut off.

That was the time when a scrawny Sentinel entered the Super Solider program. Steve Rogers was small and inconsequential, yet his score as a Sentinel was strange enough to make him a great candidate. When he under went the serum, everything exploded. Literally and figuratively. The entire world around him seemed to explode into colors, sensations and auditory inputs. The serum had made him perfect in all ways. He was the perfect Sentinel. The most powerful ever known. A blessing and a curse. For he knew in his heart that there would never be a Guide that would be able to handle his powers. Even Howard Stark, a genius and one of the highest Guides, could not handle all the input that he was giving off. He supposed it was for the best though. He had a mission to do. Even Peggy Carter, the Guide second only to Howard, could not handle him. Together though, the two helped him through the war and through losing his best friend Bucky. So he figured it was a good thing that he did a suicide mission. For his life would always be a half life, on a razors edge of insanity and violence at all times. The shock of the ice would have been a shock for anyone. But it was more intense for Steve, intense enough to slam his mind into a coma and thus into a state stasis with the help of the freezing properties of the ice.
"Like a majority of the Enhanced Humans, I don't care for gender, but If I had to chose I would chose male." Steve said. He noted the look of shock on Clint's face. He knew that everyone knew about Peggy but it was for hat reason he preferred male. Any female would be compared to Peggy. He could not do the same with a male. Before he could explain this Pepper's tablet let out a strange sound. Pepper even jumped at the noise. She looked down at it. She stared at it and her mouth fell open. She was so still it was scaring Steve. Clint tensed a bit, likely feeling what Pepper was going through. With in moments Natasha was in the room, quickly followed by Coulson. Natasha was at Pepper's side in a heart beat. The red head looked down at the tablet and did the scariest thing he ever saw. She smiled. Pepper looked up at Natasha then Steve. She was staring at him in pure shock...and joy. There suddenly tears in her eyes.
Steve lavished him with his tongue. He was so focused on that surprisingly talented tongue that he did not noticed Steve's fingers gather the sticky fluid that was copiously leaking from his member. He was so lost in the pleasure of Steve's hot mouth swallowing him whole that it wasn't until the first finger was brushing against his prostate that he realized what else was going on. He gripped the bed as that cum slick finger pushed in and out of him. It was soon joined by one more then another. He was being working open quickly. Each thrust of fingers was rough and strong, hitting his prostate every time. He was coming apart and Steve seemed absolutely smug about it. The blond hummed around his cock, causing him to fall even more into pieces. He was panting, moaning and gripping the bed for dear life. It was almost too much. He was feeling not only his pleasure, but Steve's as well. This connection between them was strong enough for him to feel both of their pleasure.
