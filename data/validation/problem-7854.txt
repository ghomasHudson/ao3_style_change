It was a casual swat that nevertheless sent Steve's head ringing. Stark's voice came distorted as he said something like, "Just keep watching, Thor. Take in the experience," and the others laughed, and Steve had no choice but to take in the experience too, held in place by the cock that impaled him.
Stark seemed to read his mind. "Nuh-uh, I'm not going to touch you. Gonna make you come from my cock alone. You don't think you can, right? You think only a whore would come from being degraded like this, fucked like this, used like this? Well guess what? That's what you are. That's what you were made for."
He put both hands on Steve's face, and guided him down onto the waiting cock. Steve squirmed helplessly as it filled his mouth, hating that he was held open like this, like he was just a receptacle for dick. Stark didn't thrust into him, just moved his head up and down manually, forcing him to fuck his own throat against it, gagging himself with each bob.
Stark didn't acknowledge him, except to tap an invisible button in the air. Music started playing, some sort of fanfare that was strangely familiar. "Got you some entertainment, since it looks like you'll be here for a while."
“Sergeant.” Friday’s voice sounded quiet but urgent in the large, empty room. “Boss is becoming restless in his sleep.”
“Are you saying you don’t trust me?” Steve’s eyebrows shot up at that and his voice was incredulous.
“Come on, Tony. You’ve done so well, baby, come for me now, come now, Sweetheart.”
He couldn't surrender to a machine. He had just come, so many times, he could hold out just this once.
"Give me your hand," he said, holding out his palm for it, gauntlet hovering at the ready. "The right one."
Younger, though. His son?
Whose? Multiple people?
The commercial break came to an end, but Stark only waved a hand, and the television muted itself.
"Utter nonsense. That's your body tricking you. It's just an illusion." The voice settled in around his head, curling around it like an animal. "Cold doesn't
Inside that needle was unconsciousness. It was days or weeks more of rape, with no hope of escape, because he wouldn't even be awake for it. No matter what, he couldn't let her put that back in him.
There was still a little slack in his body—at least until Stark grabbed around the middle, hands none too gentle against his naked belly, and reeled him in, bending him like a bow.
Steve's gaze followed helplessly, and saw that Stark lying in the bed wasn't asleep, as he'd thought, but frozen in place, eyes staring wide and horrified at the ceiling.
"After all that," said Stark slowly, rubbing his erection over Steve's face, smearing the come everywhere. "Running on empty. And just being used was enough to get you off. You really can't tell me you weren't made for this now."
But if he tried to escape again, and Stark caught him—
"C'mere," Clint said, "on my lap," which would have been a whole lot easier if he'd just left Steve's arms free.
"Have you met the genius who designed these defenses? No one's getting in. Or out."
A pair of calloused hands on his ass, spreading his cheeks, was all the warning he got, before Clint sank his dick into his entrance, plunging in smooth and sure.
In the days that followed, there was no more being strapped to strange machines, or being threatened with the shock collar, or even being bound while he was fucked.

"Just a robot fucking you in the ass. No normal person would come from that. Fifteen minutes, easy peasy."
It was his old Captain America propaganda videos. Why was Stark playing
It felt like Stark's hand, constantly wrapped around his throat.
But then Stark pulled back.
The ceiling opened up above him, to reveal a massive television screen behind it. For a moment, he stared into his own image, reflected back at him darkly. He really needed a shave.
"Even worse?" The hand again, and Peggy turned back into the stranger, with his high cheekbones and that strange glint in his eye. "It seems you're stuck with me after all."
Compared to his normal state, he was practically free.
In his aroused state, the thought of it was unbearably hot. Knowing that he was just a vessel for Stark to fuck, that Stark would take whatever he wanted from him, even if it choked him, even if it hurt him.
He was trapped, again, he couldn't feel his body, he was going to freeze again, and this time it would be with Stark sitting there not a half a foot away, looking on with interest.
"How much you terrify me."
In his most furtive fantasies, he had thought his first time might be with her, something innocent and loving and romantic. Instead, here he was, losing his virginity to a piece of plastic, in a room full of witnesses—ladies, strangers, and Howard Stark's son, whose first name he didn't even know, playing his ass like a fiddle.
"Captive?" said Jarvis, from the ceiling. He had a foreign accent. British or the like. "That couldn't be further from the case. You have 15 seconds."
"Master Stark says he still owes you a punishment for taking out your plug without permission," Jarvis piped up. "However, if you prepare yourself for him today, you'll be, in his words, "square"."
The word "brand" seemed to sear into Steve's brain.
She would know better than he did, how many times he'd been taken. How, and by whom.
But the longer nothing happened, the more he trembled, and he abruptly realized it wasn't fear, but fury.
"Stark," he said urgently. "Stark, don't do this. I'm sorry. Don't let this thing... Just don't. Please."
"Well," said Stark, junior, accepting a pair of latex gloves from another nurse. "Let's see what the damage is."
Cover blown, Steve just went for it. He slammed the door into Stark with a satisfying thump, hoping he'd gotten Stark's good arm with that, or his skull. Without a pause, he pivoted around the door, found Stark doubling over, and yanked him into a headlock, elbow over his throat, opposite hand pinning one of his and grasping for the other.
Somewhere deep down, his last spark of modesty still cringed at the idea of being seen like this—naked, lips distended around a cock—by a lady.
And suddenly, Steve found himself listening with interest—not at the idea that these rapists were the good guys, but at the word "scepter", which for some reason caught his attention like a fish on a hook, when he'd managed to tune the conversation out most of the evening, focused on just surviving the treatment.
Steve pulled himself up onto weak limbs, and crawled the few feet over, head down, ass still dripping with Thor's come, an unpleasant trickle down each leg. On the other side of the couch, Nat was waiting. When he got close, she pulled up her skirt with a smile.
Steve grunted. There wasn't a single good thing he could say to that, not while chained to this cage.
When he opened his eyes, there was a nurse staring at him, a pair of gloves in hand, a blush high on her cheeks.
But that she had a cock of her own, even a plastic one—his modesty didn't know what to make of that.
"I feel obliged to inform you," Jarvis remarked, after a while, from the ceiling. "I am still watching."
Eventually, to his surprise, the machine stopped.
A hand fell on his shoulder, and he waited to be corrected with a blow, if this wasn't what Loki had wanted.
A heavy weight bearing down on his legs, and a searing pain between them, as he was coarsely and thoroughly penetrated.
No response.
Only a single wood panel of door separated the two of them.
"I don't think all these people could be colluding to make this up," said someone else. The hand-jobs man.
He didn't even need to finish the sentence, and Steve was already begging, "Please, finish me, please, I need it."
Day 29: I think I need a doctor
(See the end of the chapter for
Very little sexual content in this chapter. Because that's a thing I warn for now, apparently.
Might be a stretch for day 15. Is a fucking machine science?
Steve shook himself, and began to work the window, looking for a latch. The room was quite a ways up. Even he didn't know if he could survive that kind of jump, but he'd worry about escaping first, getting down after that.
He tried to look anywhere but at his own dark reflection, laid out on the bed, helplessly fucked, but he couldn't avoid seeing it when he checked the timer. He tried to remember boring things, sad things, but his focus was interrupted by the machine's relentless motions, the rasping friction of a damn robot having its way with him. Equally intrusive images—Stark fucking him, on the cage, in the infirmary, Stark filling him just like the machine was doing now—kept sketching themselves in his mind's eye.
He didn't know the floor well enough to have a conscious direction in mind, but he made it back into the lounge with the television. It was brighter than the hallway, lights from nearby buildings streaming faintly in through the window, so if it was an outage, it didn't affect the whole block. He could just dimly make out the left-behind mess of the couches and table, and stumbled towards them.
When Steve was finally released from the infirmary, he went, without being told, on his hands and knees.
Steve lifted his head with a choking gasp, tears still streaming down his face. His legs were putty, and the robot in his ass was just about the only thing holding him up—but it also held him firmly in place, firmly impaled upon it, unable to move forward or back.
"Hell, he can shock you just because he thinks it's funny," Stark was still rambling. "But don't worry, I never gave him a sense of humor."
The click behind his head felt ominously final. When he swallowed, he felt the cold metal against his Adam's apple: not choking him, but impossible to ignore.
"N-no more," his mouth begged, without any conscious input from his brain. "Please, I'll go. Please."
And just now, him being fucked by this machine, whimpering, begging, crying out. He hadn't even known he'd been making those noises, he'd been so out of his mind.
A second lash fell across him, and he choked out a new scream, not even done with the first.
"Stark, wait," Steve said, panicked, still muffled around the fingers. "I didn't do anything—"
But fighting back was equally unthinkable. Whatever he thought he'd suffered so far, he was now convinced that Stark could always come up with worse. Genius ran in the family, it seemed, but in different directions.
It was too much. From the first touch, Steve was spilling into his own fist. Remembering the command at the last moment, he parted his lips, meaning to shout Loki's name, but instead what came out was, "Master," and he knew that it was too late for him, he'd never be free again.
A. E. S.
Steve tried to lift his head to look, but his neck was too weak to support it, and he only sagged back down on the hospital bed.
He was expecting Steve to hook it to the headboard, hanging himself up like a garment.
"That's so you'll always be able to see it," Stark said, circling around behind him, grabbing a palmful of his butt cheek. "This one's for me. So I can see it."
It hurt, but Steve couldn't help but tense up. Was it going to be the whip again? Or the fucking?
Steve cringed away from the vision. He'd thought he'd left Stark behind at last, but if even being stabbed through the chest didn't do it—
Sweat dripping down his scalp and spine, plastering his hair to his head.
The figure swung the scepter up with a flourish, like a magician waving his wand.
"Is he going to just leave me to rot in here?" Steve asked once, of no one in particular.
"I lost sight of you for a while. You must have been somewhere warm."
Because...
"I won't—" he barely managed to grit out, before the collar shocked him again. It was another longer one this time, that left him gasping and sobbing, flopping on the ground like a beached fish. He couldn't remember anything ever hurting like this, even before he had the serum, and the aftershocks left him his every muscle clenching and twitching.
Appreciate the positive feedback! It's intimidating to post this stuff, so it helps to see people are enjoying it.
Across the top of the screen flashed the glowing timer from the first day, the same font, the same sickly green color. That didn't bode well. Steve had had several nightmares about that thing already, and didn't look forward to more.
(See the end of the chapter for
But Stark didn't care to use his mouth, only pushed all the way down, and all Steve had to do was focus on not gagging as Stark began to roughly fuck his throat.
Day 20: Lost
"Why don't you shock me?" said Steve nastily, giving up on that particular window, and moving back out to the bedroom.
Prompts used:
When he peeled open his wet eyes. He was still staring into the cage, and this time he could see something dark dripping into it, puddling the floor. Blood. His own blood.
"Please," Steve said. "Please... put your mark on me."
Some totally unknown person.
Eventually he'd be so fucked out that he wouldn't be able to come anymore, he thought, in one of his rare moments of clarity, after another orgasm had been wrenched from him. His ass was getting incredibly sore, and the thing inside him hurt so badly, he couldn't even imagine being aroused by it. There was nothing left in him to ejaculate. He was sure he'd make this time, he just had to put up with the pain.
Trained.
Jarvis was probably off shift—small mercies.
Yes, his arms and legs were tied, but the fact that Stark had even bothered did little to soothe his ego.
When Stark whistled, Steve crawled after him, face burning with humiliation, too cowed not to.
Steve didn't say anything, which earned him a harder pat than needed, to adhere the bandage. "I get it," he choked out.
Or was the future full of superhumans?
Day 13: Breathe in breathe out
Day 26: Concussion
"I've learned my lesson," Steve said instantly. It was already so cold, unbearably cold, and there was no reprieve, no matter how he twisted and squirmed. He felt like his very sanity was slipping from him as he writhed, breath coming from his mouth in short, sharp pants. "I've learned my lesson, please, please."
Stifling a cry, terrified that the cage might shut again at any moment, he began to shuffle his way back out. At first he was so tightly wedged in that he was afraid he wouldn't be able to move, even with the door wide open behind him, but then he got both knees unbent, and managed to worm his way to freedom.
"Sorry, Mr. Stark," said the nurse, "It's not safe to keep them gagged too long—"
He wouldn't be breaking out of this once he got in.
The last time he'd let the ice soothe him, he'd woken up to this. What kind of nightmarish reality would he find if he succumbed again?
When Loki walked off, Steve daringly got onto his own feet as well. He'd been ordered to kneel, forced when it hadn't been quickly enough, but he'd never been told to stay knelt. He half expected to be knocked back down to his hands and knees, but Loki just shot him a sardonic smirk over his shoulder, and continued to lead the way, lighting up the halls with the cool, blue glow of his scepter, until the two of them came back to Stark's room, and stood in its doorway.
What if it was only more of the same?
He sobbed in pain, begging incoherent even if it weren't muffled by the mattress. He couldn't go through another session with this thing, not after being raped all evening. But the door slammed behind him, and he knew Stark hadn't even bothered to stay to watch the punishment, just deposited him here like a misbehaving child and left him to the care of his robot.
It wasn't until Stark mounted him, shoving into him with all the intimate force of a gut punch, that Steve cried out, and began to struggle again weakly.
at me."
Stark just took what he wanted, and Steve found no fight left in him, no strength to deny a single command, and risk the consequences.
Clint had resumed fucking his ass, and he had never felt so stuffed full at both ends, like he could just burst, but he had to endure it. He couldn't fight. He couldn't resist, that would only bring pain and suffering.
He opened his eyes, and saw that the timer had reappeared, and was still ticking down.
He was naked all over.
"Like... this," Steve repeated. Like... cold?
A beautiful woman came into view, shoulders back to display a perfect, shapely set of naked breasts, her hips similarly angled to show off a prominent strap-on penis, in bright purple, still shiny with lube. Steve's ass clenched at the realization of what had been inside of him.
Please note a few new tags added.
Instead of getting his bearings, instead of searching for an escape, the first thing Steve found himself doing, given the opportunity, was to mindlessly grab it, and began jacking himself off. Eagerly parting his thighs, he spilled himself onto his ass—and gasped, as the floor pressed the plug deeper into him.
Day 2: Collars
And, underneath it all, something else.
Exhaustion quickly took him, dragged him back down. He faded, even as the rocking, ravaging sensation went on.
Peeling off his bandages in the mirror, to show faint welts of fresh, pink skin streaking his back, Steve tried to take comfort in his body's resiliency. If his body could come back from this, so could the rest of him. As ridiculous as he'd always found the persona, he was Captain America. He had agreed to take the serum, to become the hero that the country needed at the time.
"Jarvis, why?" he said, getting back mindlessly on his hands and knees. His right hand was still wet with his spend, but he didn't have time to do anything about it. The timer was still running, he was going to be shocked
All to the inappropriately cheerful theme song the war commission had invented for him.
"Electro-whip. It's a little Star Wars, but useful. Discipline your slave without impairing their functionality. That could be a marketing thing. Jarvis, write that down."
Met Steve's eyes over it.
Confident that he'd be obeyed, padded off to the bathroom, swiping his palm tiredly over his face as went.
The light was coming from a glowing blue orb on its end, and seemed to pulse to some unheard beat, bathing the room and occupants in its alien tint.
He felt like he had just escaped death, but Clint behind him showed no signs of caring, even picked up the pace.
He tried to sit up, and couldn't, with his arms bound behind him. He tried to shuffle his legs, and couldn't.
"Not 'Silly'," said Stark, and Steve abruptly realized that this wasn't a recording, Stark was actually responding to him. Probably watching him too, the pervert. "CILL-E. I know you've been, what's the word, bored, under-stimulated, whatever, so I sent him to play a game with you. Jarvis, put the timer back up."
Day 27: Power Outage
A part of Steve had been hoping that he was being held captive by a deranged criminal, that if he escaped, there might be a chance of rescue, and Stark would be brought to justice.
"No," Stark said. "Not that. Beg me to use you."
He finished with a grunt, and relaxed there, still holding Steve down, nose pressed into his pubes. After a few minutes, he pulled Steve off and cast him off to the side, leaving there to choke on the taste of sweat and come.
Loki tugged the sheet the rest of the way off his shoulders, letting it pool on the ground where Steve knelt. Raked his eyes over newly exposed flesh, taking in all the marks of use, handprints impressed into his flesh, come dried on his skin.
It hurt on the way out.
Defend the underdog, as he'd done his entire life.
"You're sick," Steve said, but he doubted that this was news to anyone watching: himself, Jarvis, or Stark himself, for that matter. Stark stepped back and let Steve wear himself out, thrashing against his cuffs. The cage that had held him inside for an eternity now held him equally firmly from beneath.
After one of these missing gaps, he abruptly noticed that the pitch black of the hallway had eased into an eerie blue glow, and it seemed to becoming from the doorway in front of him.
When it was done, Steve sank down into the carpet, covered his right hand with his left, and tried to hold himself from falling to pieces.
“Hail Hydra,” the criminals all said in unison before the lever was pulled and they lurched to their deaths.
Tony went and placed a flower on each coffin. He stopped for a little longer at one of the too-small graves. He knelt in the dirt by it and tried not to cry. Just whispered a little prayer for the small soul. The parents watched him, looking absolutely devastated but grateful for Tony’s words.
“Yes. Maria told me just yesterday. I meant to tell you, but I wanted to wait for a good moment. She saw it, in a prophecy. Vision visited me later that today to relay the same information. I asked them both to wait to tell you, I wanted to make it special. A little boy with your hair and eyes,” he told Tony softly. He put his own hand over Tony’s, gentle. “See? The gods will protect us. They sent them the message to tell us so. Us and ours will make it through.”
As a few months passed, Bucky made very good steps in his recovery. The team was supportive, including him during movie nights and making time to try and get to know him individually. He was particularly close with Natasha. Tony never even tried to interrupt their quiet talks in Russian, huddled together on the rug or the couch in the common room. He was just glad to see Barnes making progress.
Then, the man looked up, catching Tony’s eye and the Alpha stilled, something flickering in his eyes that Tony couldn’t quite place. Underneath that striking blue gaze, Tony almost wavered again.
He remembered a report of dissension down in engineering, and then the alarms started blaring. Something or someone had hit the core and in that moment, all systems were failing, including life support.
Whew! Chapter 5! The plot is rolling now! I appreciate everyone who reads, leaves kudos, and comments!!
“Yeah, well. I don’t care how long it takes. I’ll convince you that you deserve it all, Tony. I’ll make you see how wonderful you are. So fiercely intelligent, caring…beautiful,” Steve said softly as he leaned in closer. Tony’s eyes were a little wide, fixed on his as they got mere inches apart. Steve leaned down, eyes slipping shut as he closed the space between them. Tony sighed into the kiss, content, eyes fluttering closed as well as he kissed back easily. The moment felt like it was too short, but at the same time, Tony thought that maybe they’d been like this for hours when Steve pulled away.
The morning came with shouting and people in an uproar outside of their dwelling. Tony and Steve shot out of bed, dressing as quickly as they could. They both made sure to grab a sword as well, and Steve grabbed his shield that he was known to wield.
“Goodnight, Steve,” Tony bided before slipping into his tent. Pepper was waiting for him. He heard Steve and Rhodes talk in quiet voices, eventually getting too far away for Tony to distinguish anything. Pepper looked at him, an eyebrow raised in curiosity.
This was so perfect; it almost felt like a dream. The sunlight filtered in through the slightly raised curtains as Bucky took both Steve and Tony’s hands in his and led them to the bed. They fell onto the soft sheets together, three sets of lips and hands all on each other. Later, Steve would wake up all tangled in limbs, two different patterns of soft breathing on either side of him, and think how lucky he was to end up there against all odds. Despite everything it had taken to get them there, they’d gotten a second chance.
“Bucky here had a little arm malfunction. We’ve fixed it up, haven’t we buttercup?” Tony said easily, trying to keep the air in the room a little less stifling. Bucky just nodded, still staring at Steve, icy eyes looking unsure. Tony went back to his holographic screens, making a few notes. “Why don’t we get you a place to stay, huh, Barnes?” Tony asked the damaged soldier, looking over to him.
Many people reached up to Tony, bowing and looking reverent at their new Lord. He smiled at them and reached down to clasp hands in greeting as he passed on his horse. It was obvious they were a kind people, and loyal to Steve and whoever he’d chosen as a mate.
“It’s done. They could not overcome our numbers, with all the loss they had suffered. I…I killed Obadiah by my own hand,” Tony admitted softly. It had to be done; he knew that. And he was glad he’d been the last thing that snake had seen, but it wasn’t exactly easy on the psyche.
“Good. They’ll answer for their crimes in the north. The people will like to see someone punished. It will give them closure,” Steve answered.
Howard would no doubt punish him, but who knows? Maybe it would buy Tony another couple of blissful, unmated years. He nodded again, content with that plan. “All right, let’s go,” he told Pepper and he was proud that his voice didn’t waver.
At least, that’s what his father thought of him. Apparently, a lot of people thought that way, though Tony had never understood why. He supposed that Omegas’ ‘natures’ were to be demure. To be in the houses, care for the pups. They weren’t leaders. At least, that’s what was said about them.
He found that the thought didn’t terrify him as much as it might have before. Having Steve’s children actually seemed…nice. He’d never wanted a family, or at least, he hadn’t wanted a family with any Alpha here. Here, it would have meant the end of his inventing. His duty would be to his Alpha and to that Alpha’s pups. With Steve, it was different. He’d be able to study, invent, even if he was pregnant or carrying around an infant on his hip.
Tony huffed and took Bucky’s flesh hand in both of his. “James Buchanan Barnes. Even before tonight, you had to have known I didn’t blame you. You’re a hero, a veteran who was victimized, and a prisoner of war. You’re the bravest man I know,” Tony said softly and that got Bucky to look back into Tony’s eyes.
Steve gave him a weary stare, not going to easily trust whoever this was. “Who are you?” He had to ask, and the confusion of just having woken up wasn’t allowing him to ask anything else quite yet.
Howard had a look of shock on his face, and Tony wasn’t sure he’d ever seen his father turn that shade of red before. His father opened his mouth, no doubt to berate his Omega son, but before he could say anything, Steve’s laugh filled the air.
“Come on. Bucky’s probably going crazy waiting for us up there,” Steve said as he led Tony off of the balcony back into the building. They made their way easily to the elevator and found themselves kissing again, against the smooth chrome of the elevator wall. Tony wasn’t sure he’d ever get tired of feeling Steve’s lips on his.
“Tell me. Who else?” Tony demanded harshly, but Rumlow had fallen silent. Tony waited another moment before scoffing and moving away from him. “Take this filth to the prison hold. We’ll make his trial and execution public tomorrow,” Tony said to Rhodes. His old friend and guard nodded and forced him out of the house.
“Don’t know? Don’t know what?” Tony asked, feeling a little caged from Bucky’s intense stare. He had a terrible feeling go through him, though he wasn’t sure why. If Bucky was going to answer, he didn’t get the chance to. The doors to his lab slipped open, and there were heavy footfalls. Bucky tensed in his seat, but he didn’t dart.
“Tony…” Sam this time, looking tired and worried. “We have to let Bruce work. You have to rest, please,” the Beta begged of his Lord. Tony took a shuddering breath and let the other man lead him back to his own bed.
“I’d like to get some rest now, mother. If that’s okay?” He felt so tired all of a sudden. She nodded and stood, before planting a soft kiss on Tony’s forehead and leaving his tent. He watched her go before sinking into his furs. He could cry some more, but he refused. He let his eyes slip closed, and prayed to the gods for the best, for something good to come out of all of this.
“We shall see,” Tony said quietly, and the rest of their meal was spent in companionable silence. They set their bowls aside and walked out to join the fray of the clan. Most were up and doing their chores and duties by now. He quickly scanned the crowd but did not see Steve among the many people. He was more than likely with Howard, discussing the agreement.
He ignored the obvious contraction, determination in his gaze. “Tell me everything you know about the defenses Obadiah has planned against a possible night raid. Do so and your death will be quick. Don’t, and we’ll keep you on the knife’s edge of death all night, maybe longer.” Tony left the ultimatum in the air.
Tony nodded, agreeing. “Okay, let’s talk. You want Bucky with us?” The last thing he wanted was to make Steve uncomfortable again. He was dying to know what had happened, why Steve had been so upset, and why Steve and Bucky seemed so chummy now. Steve looked over at Bucky, happiness dimmed a little bit by the slightly regretful look that crossed over his features.
It almost didn’t feel like a march toward war and Tony held out hope that their plan was working. They were going to surprise Obadiah and beat him in the dead of night. It wasn’t as honorable of a win as Tony would hope for, but the truth of the matter was that if they did try for an honorable face-to-face battle, they’d lose.
Bucky laughed, a low, soft sound that he was still getting used to himself. “Yeah. You are, but it’s adorable,” He placated. Tony lit up at that, delighting in the compliment and Bucky secretly vowed he’d compliment this man every single fucking day.
“My Lord, your husband has been gravely wounded. They were waiting, an ambush. We fought valiantly and took many of Obadiah’s numbers, but we had to retreat once he was injured,” Natasha told Tony lowly. She noticed the child and she gave a watery smile. “He’s beautiful,” she noted softly.
He knew if his mother were here, she’d be telling him that Steve was right. That Tony should let that anger go, and help where he could.
The last of the communal fires were mere embers around them, and Tony did feel a slight chill, so he was grateful for the fur. They stayed close to each other as they stood outside Tony’s tent, and Tony wished they could curl up together now.
Tony paused and stared, looking a little horrified and no doubt making some of the same connections that Bucky was.
“Quick! Move him in here, I don’t have another medical tent set up!” Bruce called. He gave Tony a worried and apologetic glance. Tony’s heart leaped into his throat and Peter started to cry.
He let his eyes close and listened to Pepper’s soft breathing beside him. Tomorrow, they’d make the announcement to both the Stark clan, and those visiting from Rogers’ clan. Lord Steven and the heir to Stark clan would be mated. Tony would be leaving this place for good, hopefully to a better life, with a new family.
Tony ducked his head a bit, something he never does, as he feels a pull toward the Alpha. Is this how nature intended it? He’d never felt such a connection. Maybe this was what wanting to mate felt like. “I suppose you’re right. I have a few furs, but not many. Even the winter doesn’t make the lands here very cold,” Tony admitted, finally able to bring his gaze back up to Steve’s blue eyes.
************************************************************************************
Steve choked a little at Tony’s words, his blush rising to the tips of his ears. Tony’s terrible brain had to wonder just how much of Steve’s skin could get all rosy pink like that…he’d log that experiment idea for later use.
“There are some I suspect for being the traitorous ones. Alphas I know to be particularly old-fashioned. I do not want to make accusations outright, however. It could hurt the image I’m trying to uphold to my real supporters,” Tony said to his husband in the quiet of the night.
Some resolution, finally. There was so much baggage, I thought Bucky and Tony deserved some time to hash things out with Steve alone.
He had so many emotions. He loved this child, was so glad he was here. He was devastated that Steve wasn’t here to see his first-born come into the world. He was relieved that the worst of the pain was over.
“Regardless,” Maria interrupted once a beat of silence had fallen over the two, “we need to move quickly. We’ll announce the training tomorrow morning. Put our best fighters in charge. Natasha, Sam, Rhodes,” she detailed.
Bucky looked back to Tony and then slowly nodded. Steve looked so relieved it was damn near palpable. Tony wasn’t so sure Bucky would be here come morning, but Steve was obviously hoping so. He figured it couldn’t hurt to try, but he certainly couldn’t keep him here if Bucky didn’t want to stay.
Tony grunted in agreement, still peeved at Steve’s insistence that he shouldn’t fight. How could the Alpha have thought that Tony would stay here for even one second while he let others fight?
Tony nodded back and got up, starting to turn things off in his shop. Bucky stood slowly. He walked close to Tony, giving Steve cagey glances. Tony could tell that hurt Steve quite a bit. It would just take time, Tony figured. Bucky wasn’t ready to be Sargent Barnes again. He may never be. Steve would have to come to accept that.
Tony whirled around to face him, eyes burning with anger. “I will not stay here. I cannot. Don’t you understand?” Tony yelled, not caring if anyone heard them beyond their stone walls. It was unlikely anyway; they had a rather private plot of land.
“No, there’s nothing we can do about the wedding. It’s happening. Though, there might be something we can do afterward. Let them get married, let Tony take the few he trusts to the barbaric North,” Rumlow said quietly. “If we can’t get Howard to see reason once the Rogers’ influence is gone…we take matters into our own hands. We cannot let the clan fall into Rogers’ hands when Howard passes.”
Steve reached up, cupping the side of Tony’s face with his hand. Tony leaned into the touch, closing his eyes. Then, he felt lips against his, soft and pliant. He was shocked for a moment, but eventually, he let himself kiss back. It wasn’t anything too eager. It was an easy, gentle kiss, that didn’t linger for too long. But it left Tony wanting more, desperately so.
Tony was screwed. He was so incredibly screwed. His plan flew right out the window, and he didn’t even know what to think. The sound of the Alpha’s laugh replayed in his head, over and over, and it was, unfortunately, one of the sweeter sounds Tony has heard in his twenty years of life.
Bucky sighed, looking a little fondly exasperated. “Okay, I think maybe you deserve the title of idiot more than I do,” He teased and Steve frowned, purely confused and not at all offended. He was used to their soft teasing. “He’s got it for you, too, you know. We talked about it, how we both had…have, feelings for you,” Bucky explained further.
“So be it,” Tony said evenly. Then, he fired.
When the night was winding down, they left, Tony paying quickly and then taking Bucky’s hand as they walked out of the place. Bucky felt a little giddy as he laced their fingers together and walked back to where he had parked his bike.
Tony counted thirty-two coffins. Some were too small, and he had to look away from them. Anger and grief surged in his heart as he saw the few that were so small that they were easily lifted above a grieving parent’s shoulder. Obadiah would pay for this. He and his whole faction would burn.
His crew. They were all dead. He hadn’t managed to stop the asteroid from hitting the ship and…how? How had he survived?
“Well, Tony. You should call me Steve, then,” he answered easily, looking absolutely delighted at Tony’s brashness, for whatever reason. Tony was absolutely perplexed. He was floored, wordless. And that did not happen often.
Steve’s hands came up again after Tony’s diadem joined Steve’s, but this time they tugged at a knot of his silk. The fabric loosened, unfolding from the careful placement it had been in. He felt warm fingers trail over his shoulders, brushing the silk off of olive-toned skin. Tony felt the fabric pool useless to the ground and he was finally naked in front of his new mate.
He felt like he could cry, but he didn’t. He kept it together as he made his way to his own tent. He wasn’t getting out of this. If he wanted to avoid it, he’d have to run away and he knew he wouldn’t last in the wilds. He was a Lord’s son, an inventor. He wasn’t a particularly good hunter or survivalist; at least he didn’t think so. It had never been put to the real test.
He never thought that it could be possible. Sure, he’d seen them getting closer. He’d been glad for it at first. It was honestly a miracle that they weren’t at each other’s throats, considering Bucky’s past. Tony had forgiven him, and Steve had been so relieved.
Steve looked torn but he eventually nodded. He let Tony’s hand drop and stood. Bruce told him before he left that this was no phantom contraction. Tony was having this child, tonight. Tony felt nervousness light up anew in him. He’d been somewhat hopeful that it was just a false alarm.
Steve shook his head as they walked back into the elevator. Tony was getting a little worried about how serious Steve suddenly looked. Although, he figured that the reaction was warranted, considering the current situation.
“What? Years? But what about Pepper? You two were so happy.” Steve looked beyond confused. Tony sighed and nodded, thinking back to his past relationship. It was complicated, in his mind. Both good and bad times, and yet still Pepper was one of the most important people to him.
Just as Tony had started to heal, about six months after the fact, Steve’s world came crashing down again. He’d been so close to asking Tony out, as he noticed the signs of Tony’s happiness coming back to him slowly but surely.
“I’m sorry. I’ve hurt a lot of people. I knew…” Bucky trailed off. He’d known Howard. He’d been a friend, and he hadn’t even blinked as he ended the man’s life. But that was the last thing Tony probably wanted to hear. Tony twitched, and brought up some holograms, trying to deflect.
Howard cleared his throat, obviously figuring out that Steve was awake now. “This is my son, Anthony,” Howard introduced, keeping his voice unobtrusive. “He’s also one of the brains behind your rescue. Chip off the old block.” Howard seemed proud, but Tony looked a little shocked at the man’s words.
He hooked another punching bag up and rubbed his hands together before he started to punch, trying so desperately to let all his emotions leave him through the violent movements.
“Good, you’re in working condition. Who do you work for, Soldier?” Came the cold voice of Alexander Pierce again, echoing against the stones.
The Alpha laughed as their clothes came off in pieces, and Tony swallowed up the amazing sound with a kiss as they tumbled into the furs that had been waiting for months.
An alarm sounded, and Tony hadn’t expected to catch the clan by surprise at all. There would be no formation though. Tony didn’t care about honor. He’d burn these traitors and murderers to the ground.
A question about Obadiah’s defenses was on his tongue when he felt a sharp pain in his abdomen. He just managed to bite down on the whimper that wanted to come from his lips. No…please don’t let this happen now. They were so close, they just needed some information and then they could attack tonight.
Steve gave a considering hum and thought this over for a long moment. “List them. Our trusted few will keep an eye on them, and never utter a word to anyone else,” Steve answered. Yes, that would work. The few they could trust to observe casually, without rumor, they would tell.
That made Tony pause, even more, surprise surely evident in his facial expression. Bucky let out a laugh, obviously sensing Tony’s disbelief. “Yeah, I like the fellas just as much as the dames. Of course, couldn’t admit it back in the day. Would’ve been locked up at best, dead at worst,” He explained with a frown and a shake of his head.
Steve smiled at him softly, reassurance in his kind blue gaze. Tony smiled back, his heart light. He didn’t care if the wedding was stopped right now. He would run. He would choose this man over everything he’d ever known, in a heartbeat.
The gods didn’t answer him, but that didn’t mean that they hadn’t heard him. Tony knew they were watching, listening. He stood and walked to his and Steve’s tent. It was late, after dinner, and most people were finding their ways to their bedrolls.
At that moment, Steve felt dread pool in his stomach. He was an expert tactician, and he knew how to gain knowledge of his surroundings and situation quickly, and he did not like what his brain was adding up.
“Possibly,” Steve admitted, though he was a little quicker in getting the rest of his clothing off. Tony watched, unabashed, as more smooth pale skin became bare. God, his Alpha was gorgeous. Strong shoulders, muscles that told of his power. Tony let his gaze dip lower as the last of the fabric was shed. His eyes widened a bit and his mouth fell into a small ‘o’. He didn’t have very much to compare it to, but he was pretty sure that was above average as well.
Sam Wilson was a Beta, one of Steve’s best friends from childhood. He was a natural fighter, but since the loss of his mate, he hadn’t wanted to take charge of their hunts and fights. He’d conceded the position to Natasha easily when she’d come along. Tony didn’t ask for details. If he were to marry into this clan, he’d find out on his own soon enough.
He paused as he walked in, and his heart froze as he saw the state of the place. There were broken punching bags everywhere, the gym in a complete state of disarray. Bucky immediately turned and ran toward the elevator. “Friday, where’s Steve?” He demanded, panic surging through him. Had it really been that bad? Was Steve that angry? How had he missed this?
Natasha scoffed. “Nonsense. Of course, he wants you. I haven’t seen him this besotted in…well, in a long time.” Tony wanted to ask what she meant by that, as there had been a slightly pained expression on her face for a moment before she’d schooled her features. He let it go, however. He had no business prying into Steve’s past like that.
“I will. If it’s what you want, I’ll take you from here,” Steve agreed easily. Tony let out a relieved breath, shaking with it slightly. It was frightening in so many ways. Here he was, agreeing to marry this random Alpha. Agreeing to leave his clan, and all he’d ever known. Of course, he just got abused and put down here, but still. It’s where his family and clan were.
The trip got colder, too. Tony had to abandon his silks not two weeks into the trip. He used them for more important things. It had been strangely gratifying when he’d taken one of them, a soft lilac, and ripped it up so he could use it to wrap a wound Sam had gotten from his horse bucking him off. He’d caught Natasha staring at him that time, a pleased glint in her eye.
Here, though, they had permanent structures. He’d heard of such things of course and knew the people of the North used them to keep out the chill. It was almost a necessity, during the winters here.
They took one more moment to look around their old place, silently remembering another lifetime, before Bucky gave a little tug on his hand and they left. The receptionist gave them a smile as they walked out, but Steve was too preoccupied with the fact that Bucky was still holding his hand to notice.
Obadiah’s body slumped to the ground, and the nearby Hydra men noticed. They gave an angry rallying cry and charged at Tony, but they were only met with an abundance of arrows from the tree line.
“I’m sorry,” Bucky said shortly, before letting go stiffly, and darting to the bedroom. Tony would be concerned that Bucky seemed to know the layout of the tower apartments, but he was still reeling from the hug. Then, he registered what Bucky had said. Sorry? What was he sorry for? Tony frowned and turned to Steve, who suddenly looked very haunted, his usual bright blue eyes hooded by a darkness that Tony couldn’t explain.
“You will be married in two days time,” Howard decided with an authoritative air. “After that, you will leave with him, and further discussions of sending populations to the North will occur afterward.”
“I’m just saying! I thought I saw the redhead staring at you tonight. Natasha was her name,” Tony teased further, laughing as Pepper chased him around the room with a broom.
“You deserve it just as much as us, Tony,” Steve said softly, and they were even closer now. Steve let his eyes flit over Tony’s features. Taking in everything at once, as much as he could. The other man’s long dark eyelashes, the slight crows feet that got more prominent when Tony smiled. Tony snorted derisively.
Suddenly, the warmth of his Alpha was gone and Tony opened his eyes. He saw Steve step back further into the tent, toward the bed and furs. He started to take off pieces of his ceremonial garb. His crown, silver and beautifully simple, was lifted off blond hair by large hands. Steve set it aside and then shrugged off his white fur, folding it over a chair. He looked back at Tony and raised an eyebrow while smiling softly.
Bucky nodded. “Yeah. Yeah, I know.” Then, Bucky smiled, a soft, sad thing, but it held promise. He reached back out and took Tony’s hand in his again. It felt good, to have all of that off their shoulders. Now they could move on together, with each other, and hell if Tony didn’t love the sound of that.
Tony gave a cry of his own as he saw Natasha and Sam helping Steve into the tent. There’s a horrible wound on his husband’s side, blood pooling. The Lord is unconscious and deathly pale, but Tony can see a slight rise and fall of Steve’s chest.
He quickly thought about the best plan if someone came into his tent. He’d leave Peter on the bed and stand. There was a dagger on the table near him.
Steve wasn’t quite privy to the joke of course, but he found himself smiling back, admiring the way the smile lit up Tony’s features and his beautiful brown eyes.
As he worked, Tony became even more relaxed and pliant under his ministrations. By the time he had made his way up and over Tony’s ass, the smaller man had drifted into a light doze, breathing easily, his face turned towards Bucky and looking peaceful as he slept. With the same gentleness he’d shown the whole night, Bucky carefully pulled Tony’s sweatpants back into place and then snugged the weighted blanket up around his shoulders. He put a glass of water on the table by the bed then walked around to the other side and sat down on top of the covers. He propped his pillow up to let himself lean back against the headboard and picked up his tablet.
, his responsibility, his to take care of, and he felt the heat of shame roll through him that he had allowed this to happen.
"I need you to relax sweetheart. You're so tense, you’re going to hurt yourself. You're doing so good for me,Tony. Just relax now and let me take care of you."
, Buck, for helping him. And I’m sorry that you had to.”
“I understand Friday. He’s gonna be just fine.” The AI gave a wordless hum in response, but didn’t say anything else. “Come on, Doll, let’s get you to bed.” Tony found enough energy to protest at that suggestion.
Tony took a deep breath then blew it out, letting his body relax so he could just enjoy the feel of Steve’s hands moving over his body. He felt them move across his stomach, up his arms and over his shoulders, down his hips and back up his thighs with fingers trailing along the inside still without touching his cock at all.
Tony just blinked at him for a moment until it became clear he wasn't going to say anything else.
That was how Bucky found him when he walked into the kitchen a short while later. He had been in his room, staring at the blank page of his journal. He was supposed to write each day about his recovery, he memories, his likes and dislikes.
“Boss and Captain Rogers were engaged in a private activity, Sergeant, and Boss would not like it if I gave you details.” The AI’s voice sounded prim and mildly shocked, but he knew she had no problem embarrassing Tony in other circumstances. If she was being hesitant and closed-mouthed about his sex life now, she must be truly concerned. Which was why she called him; Tony was in no shape to have done it himself.
, but he just couldn’t. They
“I know that up here.” Tony tapped his head the paused and laid his hand over his heart. “But it feels different here.” He looked at Steve and could see the frustration on his face. “Hey, sweetheart, I’m not trying to blame you. I just need to know that it won’t happen again. I need to be able to trust you.”
Rhodes raised an eyebrow at him and stepped further into the tent. “Tony, be realistic. Your father is not going to stop looking for an Alpha. If he passes before you marry, half of the clan won’t want to see you in power alone. And this man…” Rhodes gave a bit of a shrug. “This man seems like good people,” he finished honestly.
It's done! Finally. It took me way too long to finish writing this, oops! I hope you guys have enjoyed it anyway! I promised a happy ending, and I delivered, with much fluff. Seriously, it's tooth rotting. You're welcome. Haha!
“Oh. The translator. Yeah, it’s going on without a hitch. I’m glad my design worked, otherwise we’d both be pretty confused right now,” Tony laughed a little. Steve looked up at him, impressed as he connected the dots.
He took a few moments, but he finally told her in a slightly shaky voice as she took off the first of his bangles. “I’m marrying him, Pepper. I’ve agreed to it.” He looked over at her and sees her slight surprise.
Tony looked at Bucky for a long moment. “Yeah, I know,” Tony said softly. They shared a moment of silence together before Tony spoke up again. “I…I was in love with him, even before I met him. But maybe…maybe Steve’s done us a favor. He’s brought us together. He never meant to hurt us. You know that,” He said as he looked across the table at Bucky intently.
It was useless though, and despite Steve trying his best with his orders, the asteroid sped towards them as they sat helplessly in space. There was a resounding, crashing noise and…darkness.
A month passed, and Tony only grew more with Steve’s child. The healers said he was healthy, as was the baby. The Omega hoped that stayed true through the ordeal. It looked very much like he’d have to fight a war while heavily pregnant. He was five months along now, and it became hard to hide the bump, even with thick furs.
“Like I’m letting you get stuck with some bigot here. There must be an Alpha that thinks just as Steve does in his clan. That is if you want an Alpha at all,” he said as he waggled his eyebrows at her. Pepper blushed brightly and swatted at him lightly.
Steve stilled for a moment, and then shifted in their furs. “No. I don’t imagine a trip such as this would allow for it,” he answered. “You’ve been doing wonderfully, my love. I’m so proud of how far you’ve come.” And of course, Steve would change the subject to Tony’s accomplishments. He doesn’t want Tony’s mind idling on the negative.
When they finally arrived, there was a big celebration. Tony was secretly taken back by how little the numbers were in this tribe. It truly was a cause for concern, and Tony can see clearly why Steve had been so eager to merge his people with Tony’s. The people of the tribe that had stayed behind, elders, children and people of weak constitution, came up to them with smiles on their faces.
There was an eerie silence for a long moment, the winter air whipping through the courtyard, and the angry citizens of Tony and Steve’s joined clan listened.
“Bucky…what…I don’t understand,” Steve managed, his mind desperately trying to catch up with what the other man was saying.
“Thank you,” Tony said softly in return. Rhodes was not far off, but he was even further than the other night, now that their impending marriage had been finalized. In two days time, they would be mated, sharing a bed. It seemed rather silly to hold to usual courting traditions.
Bucky’s eyebrows knitted together in concern, and Steve made himself keep going if only to get rid of that horrible look on his best friend’s face. “I love you, Buck. Not like a brother, not as a friend. Something more…and I always have.” The admission wasn’t a weight off his shoulders. It terrified him. He looked up, his heart heavy, hoping he wasn't about to lose Bucky again.
He tinkered with a few things as the morning stretched on, but he couldn’t take his mind off of the ex-assassin living in his tower. The man had killed his parents…but had he really? Tony kept thinking about the files that were out there on the web, encrypted and waiting to be opened. He set his tools down and waited a long moment.
Natasha got in his space, sniffing. It might be considered rude if they weren’t so close. Tony raised an eyebrow at her as she took a step back again. “Your scent is changing. It’s slight, but take it from another Omega. I can tell. Congratulations are in order, my Lord.” She looked happy for him, the ever-serious warrior offering him a soft smile.
“I will never surrender to you, Omega. You’ll have to kill me here, or I’ll do it myself,” Obadiah said gravely. Tony took a deep breath and aimed right between Obadiah’s eyes. There was no point in dragging this out, no point in waiting. The longer this man lived, the longer his horrid ideologies inspired what was left of Hydra’s infection of the Stark clan.
Tony, of course, had to leave the clan with one final statement. He’d been cautious at first when Steve had asked him to ride one of their horses with him, at the front of the party. Omegas didn’t ride. If they needed to, they rode sidesaddle or they rode in wooden carts in the back. It was considered highly improper for them to ride like Betas and Alphas did, though Tony had never grasped why.
Steve took a rattling breath and fought off another wave of tears. He’d have time to grieve later. He wanted the other questions rattling in his head to be answered now. “How long…” He barely manages to gasp out the partial question.
“It’s done. They’re gone. I have to focus on this, now. I have to lead our people against those responsible.” He sounded brave, his voice never gave a tremor, but inside he could feel his heart quicken. He’d never done anything like this before. He hoped that the training with Natasha would be enough. He’d kept the lessons going as scheduled, despite his condition.
“Whoa there, tiger. Take it easy.” There was a voice to his left and Steve quickly whipped around to see who was speaking. The accent was strange, but some sort of universal translator was making it possible for him to understand.
The announcement for the mass funeral was made for later that day. People all paused their usual work to help for the preparations. Plots were decided upon by the families and temples. Candles were gathered and set along the walkways. The sun was just setting when the official procession started.
He shuffled down to his lab, nursing his wonderful mug of life-elixir. He paused just for a second when he saw Bucky sitting on the couch he had down there, reading something on a tablet. He couldn’t help the soft smile that bloomed on his face when Bucky lifted his head and grinned at him.
Brock stood and looked at the Omega with a serious gaze. “Obadiah has the clan in disarray. It isn’t only Omegas who suffer, though they suffer the worst,” he tells him gravely. Brock’s head tilts a bit, and Tony can tell that he caught his scent in the wind.
Rumlow looked at them as he got down from his horse. He made his way to Tony and knelt in front of him. “My Lord. I’ve brought you the people who are loyal to you and your family, to fight and aid you in your war against Stane in every way we can,” Brock spoke solemnly.
His mother met him in his tent a couple hours later, as expected. She fixed him with a sympathetic glance as she crossed the space and sat down at the foot of his bed, among all the furs. “Anthony, my dear,” she started, brown eyes searching for any emotion on Tony’s face.
“You said ‘we’. Who is ‘we’, exactly? If your colony is new to the UFP, you must have another government in place,” Steve reasoned as he looked to Tony for the answer.
“Hey, Tones!” That had become a nickname that Bucky was sticking to. Rhodes called him that too sometimes, so he hadn’t minded in the least. Tony wandered over to Bucky, sitting next to him as he took another long sip of coffee before answering.
He made his way down to the lab level, looking around curiously. He paused at big glass doors, an access pad that was lit up red, locked, seemingly the only way in other than breaking the glass of the door. Bucky had at least three other ways to get inside, but he decided he should probably knock this time.
"What's that boys name?" Steve asked. The boy was running around like an idiot trying to get a wasp to stop chasing him, and fell directly into the pool. Steven gasped and stumbled backwards and fell over, a hand on his chest. He felt the boys pain. "I HAVE TO GO SAVE HIM!!!" Steve scrambled to his feet and ran down three fights of stairs to the back foyer.
He started thrusting at full speed and watched at Steve squirmed like a worm under him.
Tony decided he needed to get to the next task at hand. He pulled up his sleeve and examined his to-do list. His entire arms was scribbled with words like a full sleeve tattoo, hardly any of it even legible.
"I NEED HELP!" Steve yelled at him. The boy whipped around, confused. Steve was still sprawled out on the ground. He ran back and helped him to his feet.
Bucky looked at both of them them, then shrugged and downed the entire drink he was making for Steve, even though all he poured into the glass was grenadine which he just assumed was alcohol. He wasn't old enough to drink anyway, so he didn't know the difference.
He hit stop on he record and helped Steve into the bathroom he has installed that required a 56 digit long password.
"Actually.," Steven pulled out his batman shaped fidget spinner from his pantie string. He spun his and marvelled at this modern invention before Tony tomahawk slapped it out of his meaty hands.
"JARVIS," he yelled, not moving his eyes from the pool boys bulging muscles. "I'VE MADE A MESS."
"Good work today, Pete," Tony said as he ruffled the spiderboy-mans hair. "Now skedaddle on back to your room."
"It's fine, I'll get my sugar daddy to get it for me."
"FUCK KIDJENFNNVJFJVNN," Steve hollered at the top of his lungs, completely ignoring Tony's one-sided banter.
"Like what you see?" His eyebrows wiggled across his forehead.
"Buck?" Tony looked across the room at his sugar baby.
"Ah, that's right!" Tony exclaimed. He took a few steps to the side to the basement door. As he opened, he slipped right after he took a step, tumbling down the rest of the thirty floors until he reached the floor of the dungeon.
Sure, he was married, but still. He sat straight up and feigned composure.
"You boys up for a three way?" he asked, pointing finger guns at each of them.
"This is Tony and Cap, scene five," Tony said to the camera and fixed his hair while he was at it. Steve did not stop wailing the whole time.
"Aw, are they modelled after your own... you know ;)"
They made passionate eye contact and began to sweat.
By the time he reached the pool, the pool boy had already gotten out himself and found a towel to dry off with. He noticed Steve running straight at him, heaving and looking panicked.
"Oh, Steve wanted me to make him a drink." He stated. Tony made a face. He didn't think Steve was home, and was looking foreword to having Bucky all to himself. Damn.
Steve would've smirked if he could properly move his mouth at all. "Right now, you're turnin me on," he said.
"How'd you know??????" Tony winked too.  He knew very well how Steve knew.
Friday's voice bellowed in his ear.
There was a massive steel door at the bottom of the basement stairs, and 10 different deadbolt locks. Only Tony had the keys, and never remembered what key went with what lock.
"Besides, mine is cooler anyway." Tony reached into his pocket and whipped out his own fidget spinner, a trifecta of red metal dildos. "Had some spares from the old suits."
"Alright then, everyone strip down to your underoos!" Tony demanded. "Jarvis, dim the lights and put on the Bedroom Tunes playlist!"
Through it all he kept quiet and still despite every part of his mind screaming for him to twist and squirm and push himself harder into Steve’s hands. It seemed like Steve could still sense his inner turmoil, however, because he just kept stroking his hands slowly over Tony’s body, and talking soothingly in his ear, voice low and deep.
to get through that door, so he took a step back and looked up, a habit he’d never quite outgrown.
"Well, how about thanks, then? Pretty sure I owe some of those at least. You- you didn't have to do what you did."
“I’m here, see, I told ya I’d be right back. Now, I need to lower your sweats to put this on, so if that’s okay, roll over on your stomach for me. If you get uncomfortable, ya just gotta say so and I’ll stop right away.” He was a little uncomfortable himself doing this when it clearly should have been Steve. But Tony was hurting and if this would help, then Tony himself was the only thing that could stop him.
"No, Snowflake," he replied with a raised eyebrow, "It's not what teammates do. But-" he hesitated and took a deep breath before he continued. "Maybe it's what friends do?"
"Okay. That's fair. Who would you suggest?"
“Friday, would you send me some relevant articles about what Steve and Tony were doing tonight? Specifically in regards to what you do to recover after?”
“Hey, Buck-” he started, but Bucky cut him off, scowling .
“Friday,” Steve pleaded with the AI and looked up to address her again, “I fucked up, I get it. But I just want to make it right. Please let me through. I just want to make sure he’s okay now, please.” If the AI wanted to see him beg, he’d do it. Right then, he’d do anything that would shut off that video and get him to Tony. “Please, Friday, please open the door.”
the physical evidence of all they’d done. That was supposed to be private, between him and Tony. He felt distinctly uncomfortable at the idea of Bucky- or anyone- seeing and touching Tony so intimately.  He felt his grip tighten on the tablet and forced himself to relax and set it down before he damaged it. He noticed the site Bucky had been reading as he did; a pretty reputable one for information about BDSM; the article on the screen was
“Alright. If it’s that important, we’ll do it.  What do you need?”
"Thanks again. I guess I should go find Steve." He stopped, practically wringing his hands, an echo of last night's fears in his eyes. "He- he came back, right?"
Before Tony knew what was happening, strong arms were wrapped around him, pulling him close. “Tony-” Steve’s voice came out in a strangled gasp. “I’m sorry. You’re right, I saw the video, I know you’re right. I just hate that it happened and I won’t let you go through that again; I swear.”
"I don't know, Tony. It feels like adding someone else to our relationship. I'm not really into that. You're mine, and I won't share you."
"Yeah, slept fine," he finally said. "I, ah, I guess I owe you an apology. I'm sorry you-"
Tony felt the tension wash out of him as soon as he entered the familiar, comforting space. He moved immediately to the small counter where a coffee maker stood and started the machine. He kept his back to Steve while he waited for the coffee, taking deep breaths to calm himself while savoring the aroma of brewing coffee. When the coffee was finished brewing, Tony poured two mugs; a little cream for Steve and extra sugar for himself, then turned to offer one to Steve.
Tony let out one last scream as his long-delayed orgasm exploded out of him and over Steve’s hand. Steve kept stroking him as he shuddered and clenched hard around Steve who let out his own shout and came blindingly hard deep inside Tony’s velvety heat. He gave a few last thrusts as he rode out his release then leaned forward to press a kiss against the back of Tony’s neck while his hands moved to undo the ropes binding his wrists.
Tony mumbled something into the pillow that might have been acceptance, and Bucky didn’t want to take the time to make him say it again. He moved swiftly, and Friday directed him to the correct drawer once he was in Tony’s room. He spared another frown for the state of the bed, determined to have a serious discussion with Steve when he finally got back.
His smile vanished when Bucky saw Steve follow him out into the common room. He was on his feet and moving forward in a flash; metal fist pulled back then darting out in a vicious jab at his best friend’s jaw. Steve landed on his ass and looked up at Bucky in shock.
Steve was quiet for a moment, a thoughtful expression on his face. Tony imagined a virtual list running through his mind as he crossed out the names of people he wouldn't trust with Tony's well being. Tony waited, giving him time to think, and he could see the moment when Steve decided.
After a moment, he decided he didn’t have the strength to shower and he returned to the bedroom, searching for his clothes. He pulled on his own sweats and one of Steve’s long-sleeved t-shirts. The thing probably could have covered two of him, the ends of the sleeves fell past his fingertips. Another time, he would have enjoyed the feeling of swimming in Steve’s clothes, but everything just felt too bad for good thoughts right now.
something that you needed time to heal from so much. But Tony clearly did. He wasn’t upset that it had happened; he was upset that Steve had left so soon afterward, apparently without making certain that Tony would be okay.
“Listen, I saw the news. I’m glad you were there to help that kid, I really am. I just- I can’t go through that again. I- There’s still a voice in my head whispering that you left me because I wasn’t good enough. Even knowing all that I know, I can’t make it stop.”
"I want you to call someone to come be with me if you ever have to leave like that again. Someone who will understand and keep me from the worst while you're gone."
Tony scanned the report, his face going a little pale as read about the young man talked down off the roof by Captain  America. He understood why Steve would leave for something like this, especially when Tony had told him to go. His drive to help others, to save people could easily have clouded his judgement, made him forget that Tony wasn’t necessarily in the right frame of mind to judge his own well being at the time. A lot of the lingering hurt Tony had been feeling started to slip away. Steve hadn’t abandoned him; he’d just gone to help someone else. After a long moment he handed the tablet back to Bucky.
"Tony, wait-" Bucky called out to him as he opened the door to leave and Tony turned back, question on his face. Bucky handed him a tablet with a news report on it. "You should take a look at that before you talk to Steve. That's why he left last night. Not saying that makes it right, but he had a reason, and it weren't nothing to do with you."
would trust? Cause no one else comes to mind for me right now."
“Steve-” After an impossibly long moment, Tony started to feel like he couldn’t breath and pushed against Steve, trying to get a little room between them. “Babe, you’re squishing me.”
They kept like this for about :49 seconds and Steve came first, ribbons of his dick juice filling the room. Tony was soon after, pulling out and getting his load off on Steve's hot oily built abdomen.
"Are you really staying for this?" Tony rolled his eyes.
"Is that a snake in your pants or are you just excited to see me" Tony said.
"Let's get this show on the road." He hit record.
"You did this," Steve gargled. He was smiling despite the gag and his unfortunate situation. "After we.. you know..." ;) he winked.
Steve wailed in delight against the gag. He was totally helpless and totally horny, just how Tony liked him.
"I was thinking..."
Steve promptly passed out.
"Steve, honey," he said loud enough that the man in the other room could hear him. The was a loud crash and a scream, then scrambling.
Sugar daddy? Steve couldn't believe this. His eyes were blinded red with rage. He screamed at the top of his lungs. Who would take his sweet boy away from him? More importantly, what did he do that made Bucky feel like he had to turn to a sugar daddy?!?!?
When he came to, McGorgeous pool boy was hovering over him, shaggy black hair framing his face. "Please tell me your name," he croaked.
she exclaimed, then sighed,
"Don't you dare bring that symbol in my house," Tony growled. "Ol' batty and I have a tangled past." He sat back for a moment, using Steve's cheek as a pillow for the back of his head as he daydreamed of that fight on top of the Statue of Liberty.
He basically had to drag him back into the house and sat him down on a bar seat.
Jarvis came rushing in and set a 4L bucket of cherry lube on the counter. Tony scooped up a handful and splashed it onto Steve and Bucky. Bucky started moving while Tony got into position in front of Steve, dick already hard as vibrainium. Steve instantly took it into his mouth and went to work as if he was eating a popsicle.
Steve was so spent and slippery he noodled onto the floor, rolling in his own mess.
"Alright," Bucky said. "I think I need a raise."
"Yes?" Steve popped up from around the corner on all fours. Well, twos. He was dragged his legs limp, scooting forward like a dog rubbing feces off its ass.
"I'm James Buchanan Barnes, but my pals call me Bucky." He smiled down at Steve.
"Uh, I work for you?" Bucky replied. Steve was there when he signed the contract. Bucky looked further down and realized Steve's robe was completely see through. His dick was out and everything.  Steve realized this and glanced down, then back up with a smirk.
"Okay," Bucky didn't really know what to make or how to make it, but went into the kitchen adjacent to them to find ingredients.
"LUBE!!!!" Steve screamed in agony. "JARVIS WE NEED LUBE!!"
A lightbulb went off in his genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist mind.
"Perfect, now make sure the camera can see you. There, that's it, that's the angle," Tony directed.
"Sure," Bucky stood up and started walking towards the house.
"There ya go buddy." Tony deposited him into he bathtub and finally removed the gag. And put the water on full blast and let Steve pummel around in the jet streams while he himself got dressed.
"Y-yeah!" Peter said, wanting nothing more than to give the boss man a hug. Tony still insisted they weren't 'there yet'. He turned around and ran really fast into his room. Tony watched him go, laughing when he almost bit it on the stairs.
"Oh, it's Gucci, you can't afford it," Steve looked him up and down, judgingly.
Tony began to strip tease Steve , throwing his clothes every Cardinal direction. Steve was already hard as a brick wall.
, Friday praised.
"Are you okay, Mr Rogers?"
said Friday.
, she suggested.
"But it sure was fast and efficient!" He was head to toe in bruises but did not give a fuck. He turned the AI off, not even Friday could know what went on in the basement.
"Oh, hey Cap! Whatcha doin down here?" He wondered as he examined his full suit that was hanging on one of the walls. Only then did he realize Cap had been tied completely naked.
He screamed.
As he sat near the large bay window of  his husband's 14 story mansion, Steve sipped on the dirty martini his butler Jarvis had brought for him. He lounged on his Mariah Carey sofa in only his fluffy pink bathrobe. Nothing else underneath. Just one leg propped up like a spread eagle, right in the view of the backyard pool. With a sly smirk like The Joker, Steve watched the man at work outside. Look at that sweet piece of ass,  he thought. He took a long ass sip of his drink until it made a slurping noise. He tossed it to the ground, the glass smashing to pieces.
Steve made some animal like noise in response. "I hate making them!!!!"
"Is that not what we just gave you?" Steve asked with wiggling eyebrows. The two husbands high fived at Steve's wicked joke.
"We'll figure it out later," Tony decided, proudly placing both hands on his naked hips. "Make sure this video doesn't get mixed up with the ones we send to Peter's school, will ya?"
"Would you rather make a different kind of video?" Tony asked, snapping back the band on the g-string so hard it could've left a gash.
"JARVIS IVE MADE ANOTHER MESS," he yelled behind him. He was too rich to make any more of an effort.
"OOOOOO FUK BABE," Tony yelled. Steve had tears in his eyes from lack of oxygen but Tony didn't care. Bucky was going ham thrusting into Steve. As fast as the flash would probably, if Bucky had to liken his speed and dexterity.
Tony wasted no time and ripped Steve's chains off shoving his big hard dick into his tight little ass.
"This is really not how I imagined my Saturday would turn out," Bucky commented as he continued to slap his hips against Steve's ass.
"HURRY UP!!" he yelled and neither of them in particular. Bucky already had his shirt off, so he got right behind Steve and stuck his limp dick in dry.
"Yeah, that robe looks so soft, where did you get it?" Bucky wondered, grazing a hand across the fluffy collar.
"HHHHHHNNNNNNN," Steve groggled around the dick in his mouth.
"Thanks. I'm great, I know," Tony flashed his award winning smile. Two Oscars, to be exact.
Bucky took long strides toward him until he was very much in Steve’s space. Steve blinked. He was even more confused now as he felt one flesh and one metal hand come up to cup his face. “You don’t even know. How gone on you I was,” Bucky said softly. Steve felt his heart skip a beat. This definitely didn’t feel even remotely real, now.
He winced and held Peter in a better embrace, so it’s not only the sling that is supporting the fragile child. His heart hammered in his chest, worried that something was wrong, that they were under attack.
Steve sighed shakily, glancing at the old window. The glass still looked fogged and discolored, like no matter how much someone tried to clean it, it was of no use.
Tony let the wrench clatter to the floor, still in shock. They stared at each other for a long moment before Bucky moved to a nearby chair and sat down. He presented his arm on the table wordlessly, and that’s when Tony noticed it was damaged. The plates were bent and kept shifting. Bucky’s face kept twitching a bit. He was in pain.
This was meant to strategically hold an oncoming army if need be. They still had plenty of supplies, and they sent a few people back with a couple carts as soon as they were established. They would make the trek again so they could bring back more supplies if the war went on.
Tony could see some of the council members and Elders near the front were not so keen, however. In fact, they looked decidedly less than pleased. Obadiah’s intense gaze bore into him and he felt a terrible feeling wash over him. Stane definitely did not look happy about the arrangement and took his displeased gaze from Tony to Steve. Tony immediately felt protective. If Obadiah hurt his intended Alpha in any way, Tony wasn’t sure what he’d do. He’d never thought himself capable of killing, but he just might end anyone who harmed his soon-to-be mate.
“Alexander, that rat bastard,” Nick cursed. Alexander Pierce was one of the council members from the Stark clan. He and Nick had been good friends when they were young, although no official alliance had even been written between their respective clans. Nick had been sorely disappointed when he hadn’t seen Pierce among Tony’s supporters.
Bruce finally finished up, washed his hands in a nearby basin that was already dyed pink with blood. He held his breath as Bruce pressed his fingers to Steve’s neck. “Thank the gods, his heart still beats,” Bruce said.
Bucky knew that Steve had spent a lot of time down here with Tony as well. The other man would join them sometimes, but he’d always slip off after Bucky and Tony got talking about some theory or another, saying he should go for a workout or something along those lines. Bucky didn’t think anything of it, and neither did Tony.
“I’m fine, seriously, Bucky,” Steve tried again with a small, hesitant smile. He tried his best to fake contentment, but he knew it was a lost cause.
“My apologies,” Howard answered quietly, with a frown still firmly fixed on his features.
“My darling, I could take the lot of them down before they could blink twice. I’m not concerned,” she grinned as she pulled one of the finished pieces of meat from the fire. Tony decided that he really, really liked her.
The crowd cheered as justice was fulfilled, but the words that the Alphas had all said were still ringing in Tony’s ears as he stepped over to Steve. Some attendants took the bodies away, the angry mob of people throwing rotten fruit at and spitting on the corpses. Tony didn’t even think to stop them. He looked out to see his people still picking up their dead loved ones from the street, and decided wholeheartedly that the criminals didn’t deserve proper burials or proper treatment.
“Of course, Sergeant. I’ve sent a thorough selection to your tablet.”  Bucky thought he could detect the faintest tone of approval in the AI’s lilt, and he smiled in thanks as he settled in to read and keep an eye on Tony while he waited for Steve to return.
“You’re exhausted, you idiot. Take a shower. Go to bed. You’ll see Tony when he wakes up, then you two can have it out.”
Steve loosened his grip on Tony and pulled back just enough to bring his hands up to gently cup his face, his thumbs drawing light circles over Tony’s cheeks. Tony’s breath hitched as he looked into Steve’s eyes. Steve leaned in and brushed his lips against Tony’s in a kiss that started chaste but soon developed into something filled with heat and passion. Tony whimpered into the kiss and tried to pull away, but Steve’s grip, gentle as it was, was firm and unyielding.
“Friday, did Tony or Bucky tell you to lock me out like this?”
"Babe? What are thinking?"
“Save it, asshole. I’m not the one you need to apologize to.” Bucky returned the gaze with a hardness in his eyes. Seeing Tony broken and crying on the kitchen floor had affected him more strongly than he could have predicted. There were days when he felt like little more than a broken old soldier, but for the first time, he felt like that gave him an advantage. He knew what it was like to get lost in your own head, to feel like the world was crashing down around you while everyone else went blithely on their way. He understood that Tony needed help whether he wanted it or not, and with the help of Friday and the internet, he knew what to do and was more than willing to do it.
Steve was still smiling softly, the memory of the long evening with Tony fresh in his memory, when he walked into the VA. The smile faded quickly though when a pale faced woman approached him and stuttered a greeting, clearly upset. She told him that Sam was on the roof, and he should be careful. He took the stairs three at a time, not wanting to waste time waiting for the elevator, and stepped out onto the roof. He moved lightly despite his size and Sam jumped in place when he seemed to appear from nowhere at his side.
He eased Tony over to rest on his side while Steve got up to get water and a warm cloth to clean him up. As he returned to the bed, he caught sight of his phone lit up with an alert and glanced over just in time to see the message from Sam,
That stung a little, as if Steve didn't trust him, but hard limits were hard limits, and Tony wasn't going to push it.
“Okay Doll, I’m not gonna do anything ya don’t want me to. So do ya want me to get it and put it on for ya? It’s okay to say no, but if ya want it, that’s okay too.”
“Shut up, punk and get out. But don’t go too far, we gotta talk.”
“Go away. I’m fine. I don’t need-” Tony mumbled into his arms, hating that anyone had found him like this.
Tony had been feeling out of sorts for days and he'd practically begged Steve to take him down and help him still his mind so he could focus on a new deal SI was trying to make. And Steve had come through in spades, giving Tony exactly what he needed. Right up until the part when he left.
“So good, Tony, you’re perfect, love. So beautiful, can’t keep my hands off you. Come on, baby, just relax. Let go and I’ll take care of you, that’s all I want to do.”
"Of course I trust you. Which is why I'm trying to have this conversation instead of hiding what's going through my head. I just- I want to have a plan in case something like this happens again."
Steve proceeded to remove Tony's clothing,  moving slowly, and kissing every inch of his skin as it was uncovered. By the time Tony was naked, he was fully hard, cock jutting up into the air and leaking drops of pre-come onto the floor. He was so tense with the effort of keeping still under Steve's mouth and hands that he was half afraid he might just fall flat on his face.
“That tone might work on the boss, but it does not work with me, Captain Rogers. Boss needs to rest. You left him alone. Sergeant Barnes is caring for him. I’m certain one of them will call you if they need you. Again.” Despite his urgency to get to Tony, Steve had to marvel at the wonder of Tony’s creation. The AI sounded petulant and maybe a touch vindictive. Like a child finally getting her own way, she seemed to take pleasure in thwarting Steve. He knew that she was only doing this because she was worried about Tony and angry with him for leaving when he had. But he still
“Steve. Steve left.” Tears still spilled down his cheeks and his voice was dull and flat.
Steve ran a hand over his face as he considered what Tony was suggesting. He was quiet for a long time and Tony started to feel anxious about it.
Shame filled Steve again as he began to understand all the implications of what Bucky had done. He should never have been exposed to this, never had to clean up Steve’s mess, not like this. He looked back at the sleeping pair as his thoughts grew darker and suddenly the situation didn’t look quite as innocent as it had a moment ago. He pushed that thought away, though, aware that it was his own concern  and shame talking. Tony would never cheat on him, and if anything, he should feel grateful that Bucky had been here to do what needed to be done when Steve hadn’t been able to do it himself. Reassured that Tony was okay, he was about to back out of the room and let them sleep when he realized that Bucky’s eyes were open and his friend was glaring in his direction.
,” Steve breathed into his hair. “I’m so sorry, baby, so sorry.” He held him like that for an endless moment, one arm tight around Tony’s waist, the other hand buried in Tony’s hair, keeping his head pressed close to Steve’s chest.
Tony flushed and ducked his head. The events of the previous evening were crystal clear in his mind now. Tony wasn't typically one to care who saw him naked. He knew he was attractive, and he wasn't ashamed of his body, scars and all. But Bucky hadn't just seen his ass. He has found Tony at his most vulnerable and taken care of him in a very intimate way, and it was the memory of the intimacy that send heat flooding Tony's cheeks. He wasn't used to anyone but Steve seeing him vulnerable and open like that.
Steve paled as Bucky said his piece, terrified by the thought of Tony trying to kill himself because Steve failed to take care of him right. “Buck, you know I'd never hurt him like that. I wouldn't have left at all if it wasn't important. There was a kid-”
Steve’s head fell as her words hit him. She was right. A part of him knew it even before he left. Tony might as well have been high or drunk right after their scene, and in no condition to make decisions about his own welfare. Especially being Tony Stark; self-sacrifice should have been his middle name. He could have been bleeding out on the floor and he’d have still told Steve to go, he was fine.
“Can’t. Sheets are dirty.” Bucky frowned as he walked into Tony’s bedroom and took a closer look at the bed. A moment was all he needed to take in the stained and rumpled sheets; he knew that he couldn’t put Tony into his own bed like this, and right now he didn’t think he could even put him down long enough to take care of it .
Tony lost all sense of time passing after that. Steve was relentless in his teasing, hands and mouth covering Tony’s body, stroking his cock and balls with the lightest of touches, fingers barely trailing over the sensitive skin. He licked and sucked Tony’s throat and nipples, occasionally leaving bright red bruises in his wake.
He woke up a couple of hours later, and everything was not fine. He thought it was his shivering that woke him. He reached for Steve, seeking the supersoldier’s warmth, but his hand found only empty sheets with a drying, slightly sticky spot in the middle. He recoiled in disgust and called out for Steve, but there was no response. He stayed in bed for a while longer, shivering and aching, missing Steve so much that it was a physical pain deep in his gut.
"Good, Tony, that's so good, sweetheart. Let's get you undressed."
Steve walked slowly around him, fingertips trailed a burning path across his abdomen until he stood directly behind him. He wrapped his arms around Tony and leaned in the nuzzle the sensitive spot where his neck and shoulder met.
"If I have to convince you, then he's not a good choice," Steve explained with a shrug. "You asked who I would trust and I trust Bucky with everything. Plus he's already taken care of you once, so no need for any more awkward explanations. Bucky’s my choice; if you can trust him to take care of you again, then so do I."
Steve kept soothing and caressing Tony’s body until he started to lean back against Steve’s chest. With a grin, he then bent and scooped Tony up into his arms without any warning at all. Tony yelped in surprise and Steve immediately covered Tony’s mouth with his own, swallowing the sound.
"Alright. Bucky it is. Do you want to ask him or should I?"
Eventually, his own thoughts quieted and he stayed where he was. If he was wrong, Tony would make that clear in the morning, and he’d apologize to both of them for overstepping. For now, he’d let himself be a little selfish.
"Okay. Is there someone else
He looked down and his voice was barely a whisper when he continued.  "I wanted to die, Steve. I thought it would hurt less. Please, if you say it'll never happen again, then it doesn't cost anything but a few minutes time to make a plan we'll never need to use."
“Sure, what’s up?” He snapped the journal shut and pushed it into a drawer as he stood and padded barefoot out of the room. He’d given up ages ago trying to get her to call him Bucky. She had simply agreed and then continued ignoring the request every single time.
"It's my responsibility to take care of you. I'll talk to him. Later."
“Tony, what are we doing down here? We can have coffee in the kitchen.”
“He was in no state to make that call, Rogers,” she interrupted him harshly. “You should have known better. You should have stayed.”
Tony stared into the room, eyes fixed on the place where he had collapsed the night before. He couldn't make himself step any further into the room. So he turned to face Steve, eyes wide, trembling as he pushed past him away from the kitchen.
Bucky was still asleep, looking young, peaceful, like he didn't have a care in the world. Nothing at all like his usual glowering self. As Tony watched him sleep, memories from the previous night began to filter back.
He didn’t remember the ride back to the tower. He was sure he must have broken every traffic law on the books, but he didn’t care. His only reassurance was that Bucky was obviously with Tony. He would be taking care of him. Of course, that also burned, because Tony was
This went on and on until Steve took a pebbled nipple into his mouth and Tony’s only reaction was an involuntary ripple of his abs. Then he reached for Tony’s other nipple and rolled it between his fingers, watching Tony’s cock twitch with a spurt of precome pooling onto his stomach. But he was otherwise still and silent just as Steve wanted him to be.
"I don't know, it sounds an awful lot like you don't trust me, if you think you need to plan for something that will never happen."
Steve’s frown deepened, deep lines of concern appearing on his forehead for a moment. He kissed Tony’s fingers before pulling his hand away
Steve accepted the mug with a frown on his face. He stood there for a moment with his arms crossed without taking a drink.
“Boss requires assistance.” She hadn’t answered right away, and for a moment, he thought she was going to ignore him. Now he just wondered what Tony might need
He stopped long enough to send a text to Steve.
he need? It was easy to say he never wanted to feel like that again, but how did they prevent it? After a moment of thought, he drew in a deep breath and looked nervously at Steve.
“Love you too, babe. Now go ‘way, lemme sleep.” He snuggled down into the covers, pulling the blanket up around his shoulders.
need. Talk to me, Doll. What happened?” Bucky reach out and slipped a hand down the side of Tony’s face and lifted his chin. He was gentle, but his strength did not allow Tony to resist the movement. Tony glanced up at him, then looked down at the floor between them.
