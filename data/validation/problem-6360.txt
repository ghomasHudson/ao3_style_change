It was a song. A song about...the Red Baron? A Christmas song about the Red Baron and someone named 'Snoopy'?
"—say 'shit' or 'fuck' or 'Jesus Christ, Steve, learn to load the fucking dishwasher' because you know what—"
She gave a broad and understanding nod. "Well, luckily, JARVIS seemed to realize there were extenuating circumstances. He let us back in."
"Good." He took hold of Steve's hand and pulled him over to the table. "Now, come on. I'm fucking starving, and that smells delicious. J, crank up whatever sappy tunes the Cap asked you to play."
"Yeah, well," Tony said as he pulled away. "Was starting to think you were trying to get yourself a Tony pancake there."
"It's not like that," Bucky said with a laugh and shook his head a bit before he went back to turning the peg on the head of the guitar, attempting to match the tone of the string with the app on his phone.
"With this? I'm going to go to an actual, normal, everyday medical doctor like this? How am I supposed to explain this?"
They swayed a few quiet minutes, Tony with his eyes closed as he let the rhythm and the music take him back to a happier time, but he was never one to leave well-enough alone, and he murmured, "Is this you trying to say you're sorry?"
Steve nodded. "That's the one," he said then grinned like he was proud of himself, and Tony smiled back despite himself.
He's been looking a little puffy lately — was he gaining too much weight? Was he suffering breakouts? Who had
He was stopped from saying anything more by Steve crashing his mouth against his, and when he dropped his jaw in surprise, Steve took that opportunity to slip his tongue in. He squeaked as Steve put his arms around him and pulled him into an embrace, tight and possessive, one hand splayed over his back while the other one cradled the back of his head, trapping him there, forcing him to take what Steve was giving him. His eyes slipped closed as he relaxed into it, Steve's initial bruising kiss turning languid and playful. Tony ran his hands from Steve's narrow waist up his midsection and then around to his back, feeling the hard, firm lines of muscle, and a giggly little voice reminded him that this was
He grabbed Stark by the wrists and yanked him away from the car, turning him around and pulling his arms up behind his back. Stark grunted a little and gave a weak attempt at trying to pull his arms away before he said, “This is fucking ridiculous. You honestly can’t think you can just
Bucky, on the other hand, is just getting started. "Hurt you more?" He growls and bites down on Tony's neck once more, definitely bruising this time. "Oh you have no idea how much I wanna hurt you, Stark."
"Does that bother you? Men coming onto you like that?" He sounds largely disinterested even though he's anything but.
Steve swallows and with a soft smile he gets up the courage to say what he should have said months ago. "I love you, Tony."
face the fact that it's over or you don't. But then you have some fucking work to do, man. If it's not over, then you have to talk to
Tony arches an eyebrow back. "What? Isn't that what we were talking about in there? You wanting to see me break? Showing Steve how to do it? Or me watching how you take him?"
, okay? Christ, what the fuck do you want from me? Are you jealous, too, now? I won't touch either of you again without permission!"
She shrugs. "I think Tony's got it bad enough that you've got some time, probably. As long as you make things right with him soon. Not that I'm saying you're the only one who screwed up. It's Tony and a relationship, I'm sure he did way more that his share of fucking it up."
"You're greedy and some day you will," Steve says with a chuckle. "Right now, all I wanna do is kiss you, though. And maybe have dinner together."
"Shut you up." Bucky's metal hand comes around Tony's throat and he chokes him while also holding him up and against the wall. "I still don't know what your fucking problem is, but slowly, I don't give a fuck anymore."
Tony needs the pain, drinks it in so eagerly, even pulls against Steve just to make him grip tighter and force him more still. It serves as his penance, absolves him from the much deeper pain, and at once makes him forget everything that's ever been wrong. Having his hole wrecked is good, but he craves more. "D-don't, don't just," he stutters out, voice rough and uneven. "Painslut," the single word is the best his language skills are capable of at the moment.
"I wanted to make sure you're okay." Steve shrugs. "Sorry if I invaded your privacy, Nat just told me you were... a little bit out of it."
to be the one who watches," he admits quietly, not wholly sure how Bucky would take him talking about it.
Bucky nods and turns his head back to look out over the beautiful land behind their apartment. "No strings." Fuck, the idea of getting to be with Steve and Tony and then potentially losing it again? He swallows.
Steve soaks that in, and his voice goes very serious. "You know it doesn't go both ways, right? You can't be with anyone else like that, I wouldn't be able to stand it."
Tony sighs, frustrated. "You don't get it, Steve. You're not a trophy or... or whatever, okay? It's not like my boyfriends haven't had the social status or haven't been pretty enough or whatever. The difference is that you're not an arms dealer, or a pharmaceutical baron who jacks up the prices on drugs because it makes him rich. You're not going out with me to get famous, you're not gonna sell the story to get rich. I've made really stupid choices in the past, and for once I'm not, and I just... it's time, okay? I feel like it's time."
"You're the most beautiful, purest thing on this godforsaken planet, I didn't wanna take chances," Bucky mutters quietly. "And an arrogant, very selfish part of me knows that you'd ruin yourself for me, if it came down to it."
He sighs, trying to get ahold of himself, but not displaying any annoyance. He pulls away and takes a step or two back.
"I'm pretty good with a grill. We should have a barbecue some time," Steve suggests and cuts up the prosciutto. "I bet everyone on the team would enjoy some old fashioned American meat."
He just arches an eyebrow and starts the kettle, glad Steve bought a French press a few days ago so he doesn't have to mess with the monster of a coffee machine. "Aren't you one considerate landlord? As I said, I sleep in the living room in front of the fire place. I don't have a room, it's not like I own anything worth putting in one anyway."
"More than fine with it." He finishes whatever he's doing, whether he's actually done or not, and turns to face Steve again, crossing his arms over his chest. "Thought about taking advantage of some of it, actually, but I've never found Mr. Right and I know I'm not stable enough for kids unless I want them raised by a nanny like I was."
Steve knocks on the door frame and enters the room, clearing his throat three times before he gives up trying to be subtle. "Tony... It's me."
? God, turns out you really are old fashioned," his voice carries a lot of affection. "So, what do you do while you're waiting for your soul mate?"
Fuck. Bucky's eyes darken and he leans in, breath now ghosting over Tony's neck. "Give me the last time, Stark. And I'll tell you what you'd get for it."
“He isn’t a spy,” Natasha assured him with a rueful laugh as a waiter brought another martini and bottle of beer to their high-top table, along with a bowl of what Steve was told was gourmet popcorn that tasted exactly like regular popcorn as far as Steve could tell.  “As for a security risk…let’s just say he has been fully vetted.”
“No, likely not,” Bucky responded with a low chuckle. “I know you aren’t big on performing for the masses, but I don’t think understated is exactly Stark’s style. Hell, he can’t fucking wait to have you standing up there next to him, show everyone who stared at you that day with Stern what you mean to him,” Bucky said with a snort that he probably meant to sound derisive, but didn’t quite manage it. “Give you his name and put a crown on your head and let them know that you bow to no one but the Realm from then on. He wants it like air, I swear to the gods.”
This felt a little like that, he realized, stepping into Tony’s workshop.  Like if he closed his eyes now and opened them again in a moment, everything could be different, even just for a short time.  Even if it all went back to what it was when this was over.  He could have this moment, this time, when his life was something else.  No battles.  No wars.  No death.  No wondering if today would be the last sunrise or if he would have to do it again tomorrow.  Or what he would do if he couldn’t do it tomorrow.
He sounded tired. And angry.  Tony gazed up at him.  Steve was looking away, back at the house, where the party goers milled on the porch and in the lawn amid a smattering of cups, bottles and plastic bags that floated around on the night air like urban jellyfish.  Finally, Steve looked back over at Tony, his brows drawing together into a frown and his mouth flattening for a moment before his expression softened.  He brushed a hand through Tony’s hair, moving the sweat-dampened curls back from where they had plastered themselves to Tony’s forehead.  Again, Tony was struck by how similar the motion was to what Ty had done, and how different it felt.  He wasn’t sure why, and his mind was too foggy to try to figure it out, but he leaned into the motion anyway.  He’d almost forgotten how good it felt to be touched like this.
“Okay, what is going—oh, hello, ah, come right in.  Why not?” Steve muttered as three more men brushed past him, each carrying large shopping bags filled with boxes and suit bags filled to the brim slung over their shoulders, though they looked nothing at all like the first man.
“Well, we—“ Tony started, then clamped his mouth shut.  Actually, they didn’t really do this.  Had they done this?  They’d eaten together at the Tower, sure.  Group meals when Tony could manage, or sometimes, Steve brought food down to the lab on the extremely rare—don’t listen to Steve on this---the extremely rare occasion when Tony forgot that lightheadedness wasn’t a natural state.  But they didn’t really do this kind of thing.  Whatever this kind of thing was.
“Its about the new promotional items for the Avengers,” Steve began. “I talked to Deirdre down in Marketing this afternoon about it, and, well, I thought I should really come to you, because…well,” and Steve stumbled a bit over his words because Tony’s eyes had gone saucer-wide with what could only be described as panic, though Steve was at a loss as to why.  “About the poster?”  Steve tried.  Maybe Tony had already heard and was upset about the change?
“I had a good time, too,” Steve said, raising his brows, a light dancing in his eyes.  “Don’t know much about taming you, though. Sounds like a tall order.”
At least there was a good fire going in the hearth, thanks to one of Lizzie’s boys, who came down from Gulleytown the other day to chop wood and do some chores for him, and he was glad for the heat now, as the wind rattled the shutters.  Willie and his boys moved his bed in front of the fireplace a few years ago, when he fell getting down from the loft, and Lizzie said no more of that in the same firm tone her mother used to use when she made up her mind about something and arguing was a thing you did if you wanted to hear your own voice.
“Tony?” Steve said with a frown.  “You sure you’re okay with this? We can go home and try this another day, if you want.   I shouldn’t have sprung it on you.  I wasn’t sure if we’d have enough time with the shopping, and I thought…well, I thought you’d be excited.  Like with the birthday thing.  That you’d like it.”
That was unfair, he knew. She wouldn't do that in a million years. She'd be understanding and sympathetic and outraged on his behalf, and he could handle anything except someone being kind right now.
Tony stared at him for a long, silent moment, one finger tracing up and down the arm of the chair as he looked Steve up and down, slowly, almost nonchalantly, but his mouth was slightly parted and his eyes were dark and wide, roving over Steve without any pretense now that he apparently deemed himself to have permission, almost to an exaggerated effect.  It should feel ridiculous, standing here, letting Tony inspect him like his own personal Ken doll he’d dressed up.   There was a layer of embarrassment that slowly built as he stood there for what seemed like an inordinate amount of time, but there was something else, too, a flare of heat that was almost pleasure, the same sense of being seen that he’d felt before, like he was suddenly standing in three dimensions when everything had been flat for so long.
Unlocking the safe was child’s play.  Literally.  He was eleven when he cracked it, not for the radio, not then, but because he wasn’t supposed to. Howard would hate it, hate this above even the joyride he’d taken in the Rolls that ended up with a broken fountain and a wet Phantom.   He paged through some of the papers inside the safe, boring pages of formulas that clearly didn’t work, spherical schematics of a depleted uranium tamper that he knew worked all too well, drawings of a cube that held his interest for a moment and rolled up reams of nautical navigational charts with various square-shaped grids crossed off in red x-marks.
“I must tell my painters to put down their brushes, my jewelers to set aside their tools, my gardeners to cease cultivating their flowers.  You put them all to shame, my beautiful one,” Tony whispered, voice rough and gravelly, and seeming to vibrate down to the hand that cupped Steve’s cheek, so he could feel the words themselves flow over his skin, tremoring though his body.
.  What was happening that was worth capturing on precious film.  He thought he understood that better, now, too.  If he had a picture of Yinsen, he’d want one of him playing their makeshift backgammon or working with the few precious tools they had been given.
“Tony?  Are you…is it okay?” Steve asked, head tilted to one side, arm reaching out to hang in the space between them, like he might grab onto Tony, or maybe so that Tony could grab onto him.  He thought he might already have.
“You gonna deposit it first thing, right?” Brock asked from over Steve’s shoulder where he lay on his side of the bed, scrolling through his own phone.
The shine of headlights drew his attention to the window, making his stomach do a somersault then decide to fold itself into an origami swan while working its way up his throat, apparently. He stood up and smoothed down his suit, running a hand over his hair in what was probably a useless attempt to get it to look less Bride of Frankenstein meets Fonzie.
Steve had worn a replica Brooklyn Dodgers uniform.  Tony spent much of the evening making wildly inappropriate comments about pitching and catching that left Steve attempting to frown with disapproval while simultaneously trying desperately not to let a laugh escape.  Sometimes Tony said things to get a rise out of Steve, and more often than not, Steve could ignore him.  He knew it wasn’t exactly Tony being mean, more like Tony behaving like a two year old and testing his limits.  Next thing, he’d be throwing things on the floor at the dinner table to see if Steve would pick them up.   Which, let’s face it, Steve knew he probably would.  Steve had been leaning against the wall, tossing a baseball into his waiting glove when he happened to look up at Tony, who was doing nothing more remarkable than holding a Jack-o-Lantern and reciting Hamlet, and thought,
“You’re asking me to watch you die because it’s safer that way.  I know Ultron was a mistake.  Huge.  I kind of got that around the time he Wile E. Coyote’d a city,” Tony bit out, all venom and self-loathing now, and Steve knew enough from the news reports to hear hours of hearings and stacks of subpoenas in those words.  It was all Steve could do to bite back something to soothe that, to tell him it was going to be okay, they would figure this out, even though he didn’t have answers today any more than he had then.  He should have been next to Tony for it though.  He wasn’t sure which one of them he’d been punishing by hiding up here and calling it building something when each day was a step further away from what he wanted.
“Didn’t get what?” Tony breathed out, holding himself still, the deep breath before the great plunge, he thought.
Tony mentally finished.  He turned his head to look at Rhodey next to him, maybe to gauge his reaction, maybe for support, he didn’t know, but Rhodey was watching Steve, too, a deep frown marring his features.  “That’s fine.  Good.  Thanks. Glad to, ah, hear it.”
“Troublemaker, huh?”  Tony asked in a light, teasing tone, as if he had been reading Steve’s thoughts. Steve let out a bark of surprised, nervous laughter before he could help himself, then felt himself let out a relieved breath of air.
good thing…it slipped into Tony’s mind and coiled there, settled in and made itself at home.  Like it belonged.  It was the strangest feeling to receive praise without the concurrent need to figure out why.
But…Tony doesn’t want to do any of that, not this time, not their first year.  So, they stay at the townhouse in Boston and snuggle on the sofa with store-bought champagne and some goodies from the bakery down the street.  Tony got them and the bots some of those metallic hats that say Happy New Year’s and some noisemakers.  No one should look good in that hat, but Steve pulls it off somehow.  DUM-E is supposed to throw confetti at midnight, but he gets too excited and jumps the gun a little after CNN shows Iceland ringing in the New Year.  The bot manages to more or less drop the confetti in a pile, while Tony gives him a lecture about what “throw” means.  U tries to scoop up the pile, but somehow, Steve and Tony end up finding scraps of confetti for months afterwards, so much that Tony swears it is multiplying.
Tony had just stared at him, then shook his head and scrubbed his hands through his hair leaving it in that ridiculous state of disarray that Steve liked.
“A worthy goal, we both agree,” Steve said with a grin.  Tony let out a low huff of a laugh and ran his hands up and down over Steve’s legs where they circled him in the large tub.
“Tony.  What’s going on? Where am I?” Steve asked.  Tony sighed, wiped a hand over his face and got up, returning with a blanket, which he wrapped around Steve’s shoulders.
“Whatever it is that’s needed.  I want to hear it. Come on, you two have seen this first hand, and I know Rhodey wants in on the action, so go.  Let’s hear it,” Tony replied. Steve glanced over at Bucky, who shrugged slightly, then took a swig of his beer and wiped his mouth with his good hand.
Tony rolled into Steve’s chest, hands coming up to grip the plain, gray shirt in tight fists like it was a lifeline.  Maybe it was.  Steve wrapped one arm around Tony’s back and the other came up to stroke through Tony’s hair, soft, soothing motions in time with the warm breaths bleeding warmth into the curve of his neck.
“Then, you changed your mind,” Tony said softly, looking down at his feet as they walked and adjust his sunglasses when the slipped down his nose.  He didn’t like thinking about Afghanistan, much less talking about it, and yet, he seemed to keep falling down that particular rabbit hole with Steve.  Shared life experience, he supposed.
“I don’t have any idea what you’re talking about,” Steve said, though he was more amused than the usual prickly way it felt when Stark’s pop culture references left him feeling like he should be in the corner with a dunce cap on over the cowl.
“It’s nothing.  It’s fine,” Steve said again, looking down at their bags and pulling at one of the zippers, even though it was already closed.  “Just… you know.  It’s kind of… weird, I guess.  Surreal, I don’t know.”
Steve’s heart pounded in his chest, echoing a drumbeat in his ears, and for a second, he was watching the whole scene from under a table, the spindly wooden legs partially blocking his view of two other pairs of legs, one in hose, one in a dark pair of coveralls still stained with oil and grease, and then he was here again, in Brock’s apartment, like a rubber-band snapped back into place.
Tony shifted closer on the bed, reaching up to cup Steve’s jaw, a soft smile forming.  It was so gentle and intimate, Steve couldn’t help but lean into it.  It felt so good, to be touched like this.  How long had it been since someone touched him without obligation?  Oh, there were hugs and quick pats on his hand, and sometimes, the little ones, they would climb into his lap, such as it was, for a few minutes.
That was true enough.  Months of planning and preparation, and it had still gone sideways, but the mission wasn’t totally unsalvageable, or so Steve hoped.   He swiped a hand over his face, disjointed flashes of memories slipping through his mind like one of those old flip books where the images seemed to move faster and faster as you flipped through the pages.
“Sure,” Steve replied.  He walked back over to the stool behind the easel and sat down.  He could do this.  Sure, Kirk was…completely naked and right there and had offered him a blow job ten minutes ago, but that was no reason Steve needed to think about him as anything other than a body to draw.  He looked over again, trying to see the pose and composition in his mind, shadows, light, form, and oh—Kirk’s cock was stiffening up, rising along the inside of his thigh as Steve watched.
He didn't know why he was fixated on the food. Well, that wasn't true. He did know, but the inexplicable rise of kale was easier to deal with than the jumble of mixed emotions that washed through him when he thought about the events of the evening. Or, rather, the lack of events. Event. Whatever.
” he started, then broke off into a cough. He pulled out his rag and caught most of it, dark and gritty like dirt.  Gravedirt, Steve thought, looking up at Tony.  He reached a frail hand out, holding Tony’s cheek.  “Come to me.  Come to me, Tony.  Please. I say yes. Is that what you need to hear? Then yes. I say yes.”
“You will,” Steve said with his usual absolute certainty in Tony.  The kind that made Tony want to be the person Steve thought he was.  “Um…speaking of doing better going forward…I brought you something,” Steve said.
“Take care of yourself, Tony,” Steve breathed out as he passed.  Tony wondered if it was deliberate, to needle at him, or just something Steve had a habit of saying.  His gaze snapped up, and he could see Steve’s throat working around the words, his eyes staring out at the street where a taxi honked its horn for a car trying to parallel park to hurry.
Tony waved his hand, as if to say it was nothing, but Steve could tell much of the tension had leaked from Tony’s shoulders.  He saw Tony reach for the covering, and found himself, without thinking much about it, saying, “Don’t.”
do,” she shrugged.  “These things are complicated. It’s not like it was, Steve.  We don’t get to fight Nazis. Most of the time, it isn’t so clear who the bad guys are.  Not anymore. We do the best we can.”
“I like your face.  And all of its expressions, even the mutinous ones,” Tony replied.  “I think I might like those best.  Odd, that.  You’re so easy to rile, though.  I shouldn’t take such pleasure in it, I know. You must have driven your commanders nearly mad.”
“I’ll check in with him. I wanted to stop by R&D anyway,” Steve said, turning to head for one of the punching bags.  He stopped, coming up short, and pivoted back to where Natasha ran in a smooth stride on the treadmill.  “Hey, ah.  You knew Tony. Before...before all this.”
“I love you, Tony.  So much,” Steve said.  “You’re—you’re incredible.  I can’t even—I--I love you so much.  So much, Tony.”
Steve shook his head a bit to clear it, then closed his eyes where he knelt by the bed and bowed his head, waiting for Tony to wake. The armor was hovering protectively behind him while Steve, and he couldn’t help the small thrill that ran through him when his eyes happened to land on the bright red fingers where the armor held its repulsors aloft. Those were inside me, he thought, recalling the cold, unyielding feel of the metal sliding into him. It was the first time he’d felt…he searched for the right word. Vulnerable. But…safe. Tony would never hurt him. He couldn’t explain it, not with any precision, but for the first time, he’d felt like he imagined an Omega was supposed to feel. Like his Alpha could take him, use him, do what he wanted, but was holding all that power in check because Steve was something to be cherished and protected and treated with care. It was an odd thing for him to want to feel, or it felt like it should be, but he couldn’t deny how much he had enjoyed it. He trusted Tony like no one else. Maybe that was why he could allow it, let himself go and let Tony just make him feel.
This was for him to use, and yeah, he liked that. He supposed Tony might know him a bit better than he knew himself, because, God, yes, the idea of fucking this hole until it was filled and leaking and sloppy with it… that someone would let him, would want him to do that, would put themselves in his hands like that… yeah. Yeah, he liked that a lot.
him very much.  He had somehow gravitated towards someone who saw him in the way he saw himself on his worst days, when those thoughts pushed through everything else and filled his head with all the ways he wasn’t worth more than this, until Brock was little more than a self-fulfilling prophecy.  Brock was who he deserved, or so some part of himself--maybe the part who still heard his father’s raised voice or the part that endlessly questioned what he had done over there in the desert--must have believed.
“I’ll call for pizza,” Steve was saying, though it sounded off somehow.  “Why don’t you pick out a movie?  That one you mentioned sounded good.”
“God, Steve, just…” he heard Tony take a shuddering breath, and he knew what he was behaving like, wanted to stop, but couldn’t help himself, too overwhelmed by what Tony was doing to care.  And then he felt something else pressing against his entrance, hard and insistent and groaned through the pressure, the burn, the stretch,
The thought thrummed through him, filling him with an intense, burning need.  He wanted to come on Tony’s cock, to feel what it was like to come like that, with someone inside him, when they were still part of him.  Maybe, with Tony, it could be different.  He could be different.
Steve followed Zola and the guards along the same route they had taken the first night, though Zola’s steps were hurried, almost a run, if such a man could run.  A quick knock on the King’s door and it was thrown open by one of the King’s guards, who held up a hand as Zola started to enter.
Oh, right, because the last time they’d seen each other post-PDA, Steve had asked if Tony thought they’d given everyone enough time to get good pictures, and Tony had managed to choke out something about a call with investors in Hong Kong past the lump in his throat, and definitely-not-run to his room and jerked off over the toilet with a bottle of the hotel’s stupid custom lotion and a wad of tissue while remembering the way Steve’s hands and mouth felt.  So, you know, goodbyes weren’t his thing.  Whatever.
Whatever it was he was planning fled from his mind in the fraction of a second it took for Steve’s mind to catch up with what his eyes were seeing.  Tony was sprawled out in the center of his bed in a puddle of red silk sheets with the reactor node glowing a soft blue from the center of his chest.  His legs were spread wide, and Steve was thrusting deep, in and out, holding Tony’s ass at an angle while he kneaded the soft flesh.  Steve was also kneeling with a knee on each side of Tony’s chest, and Tony’s wrists pinned above his head with one hand and the other braced against the top of the headboard while he fed his cock into Tony’s mouth.   Another version of himself, small, pale and sickly thin was licking a long, lazy stripe up the underside of Tony’s cock while it jumped in time to the thrusts, and looking at Steve over the ridge of Tony’s cock with a lascivious sort of challenge in his eye.
Before Tony quite knew what was happening, he had an armful of outfits that he shoved over the top of the dressing room door, then found himself giving a yes or no nod to one of the salespeople when Steve dutifully trotted out and turned in a slow circle for Tony’s approval.
Steve walked in the room and stood there by the door as Tony closed it, waiting.  He wasn’t even sure what he was waiting
, Steve, I swear.  You’ll see. You’re gonna look back on this and wonder what you got your panties so twisted over.”
“Isn’t it?” Tony challenged.  He held Steve’s steady gaze for as long as he could, until the cold numbness that started in his chest seeped to his hands and he couldn’t keep still any longer.  He needed to move.  For a fraction of a second, he could see a corridor with double doors at the end and everything he wanted waiting inside.  He sucked in a shaky breath and put the sandwich aside, brushing the few crumbs off his lap before he stood up.  “This isn’t what I…look, forget it, okay?  Let’s just go back.  Unpack.   Get settled.  I’ve got some calls to make anyway.”
“I--yes. It was a good day,” Steve replied, looking down at the sketch for a moment, his mind filled with memories so vivid he could almost feel the cold air seeping into his chest.  “A very good day. One of the last before...until you, I guess.”
Point was, Brock needed him.  That was the point. He mattered to Brock, of course he did. That was all.  It was just that Tony...Tony could afford to whisk his dates--which Steve wasn’t, of course--off to the Grand Canyon in a private helicopter, and who could compete with that?  It wasn't fair to compare. Though, he thought he honestly would have enjoyed having a hot dog on park bench with Tony just as much.  Tony was...different, that was all.  He just sort of exuded a sense that any time you got to spend with him would be nice.  Probably most people didn’t make you feel like that all the time.
.  Tony was very well aware of on whom, exactly, Obie planned to pin the blame if his black market weapons sales came to light.  That was what had triggered Pep’s suspicions in the first place, because she watched over everything to do with him like the world’s most militant mother hen.  Tony’s name where it shouldn’t be.  Clever, backstabbing,
“Yes.  Wait…he looked away—nope, nevermind, he’s checking out the reflection in the glass on the announcement board,” the man said.
“A political arrangement, I told you,” Tony said with blithe wave of his hand.  “You’ve no need to be concerned.  You must know that by now,” he added, voice going low and soft.  “Is
, he mentally corrected--and that was the last thing Steve wanted.  Wasn’t it?  What he should do--what Tony clearly wanted him to do--was to leave Tony alone now that their…
, and if it was, he would be better than the type of person who pulled someone into whatever this life was only in the hopes of pulling himself out of it.  That wasn’t fair or right or anything other than self-serving, Steve told himself firmly, failing, again, to quite make the admonition stick.
The mall wasn’t too crowded, being a weekday, but there were more people than Tony was used to seeing.  Families chased after squealing toddlers, who ran towards the jets of water spurting up from the ground in front of the fountain.  Couples strolled past store windows.  Groups of teenagers hung together in packs.
“North Star.   See, there, by the Big Dipper,” Tony said, pointing as he angled the telescope.  “Since it’s so close to the North Pole.  Stays relatively stationary in relation to the sky, which makes it handy if you’re a Viking explorer or something,” Tony told him.  “You can figure out how far you are from the North Pole using the height of the star over the horizon.  Find your way home,” he explained.  “Celestial navigation.”
Steve stopped next to where Stone’s lance rested and held up the purse, dangling it from one hand in front of Stone.  Then he curled his hand into a fist and brought it down as hard as he could. The lance splintered under the force of the blow, the coronel breaking off and falling to Steve’s feet, and the railing broke clean in two, sending the lance point falling to the dirt in a rain of gold coins.  The crowd seemed to gasp in surprised unison, several of them rising to their feet in shock.
“Good,” Steve managed to whisper, his throat having to work a bit to form the word. “I’m good, Tony. I’m—I’m sorry about—”
“Perhaps.  In some cases, perhaps.  But, not, I dare say, to Captain Rogers.  If anyone would understand about having your life dictated by your body’s limitations, it would be Captain Rogers,” Dr. Reese remarked, which made no sense.  Tony wasn’t blind.  That body had zero limitations, except perhaps finding shirts that fit.  “Here.  Take this.  When you get low, let Agent Coulson know, and I’ll send more along,” Dr. Reese said, holding the bottle out towards Tony.  It hung there between them for a long moment before Tony reached up and picked it out of the doctor’s grasp, pocketing it without a word.  “Good.  Agent Coulson will see about the rest of the things you might need.  If you have any questions—about anything at all—my number is on the bottle.”
“Yeah.  Just kind of hard to get my head around, you know?” Steve replied. He dropped his eyes to the table and his almost empty coffee mug.
“Thousands.  Tens of thousands, more like.  That was what they said later, though no one would admit to it at the time,” Howard added.  “Should’ve sent Cap in sooner.  A
“You want someone from the Corps,” Steve was saying.  “I’ll bet Rhodes can pull someone in for you.  The IRRF is doing most of the funding, but the Corps took over private contract management awhile back,” Steve reminded him.
“You want him to choose you,” Jarvis finished quietly.  “But, you cannot bring yourself to ask it of him on the risk that he might decline.”
. Easily detectable.  Oh.  Yes, God, yes, that, there, right there, he thought disjointedly, making some kind of a noise in the back of his throat.  Errors.
The door lock finally caught, and Steve nudged the door open with his shoulder where it looked like it didn’t quite fit the frame correctly, which seemed to be a familiar enough routine that Steve didn’t even make a face at it.
“Steve-o, you are never going to—oh, shit, no, you have got to be kidding me,” Barnes bit out, standing in the doorway, gaping at Tony like the proverbial fishwife.
Tony had asked him for something.  A small thrill jolted through Steve.  It wasn’t much, but it was a start. He walked over to the credenza and picked up a bottle of water that was chilling in a silver bucket, then walked around the edge of the table to stand as close as he dared to Tony.  The urge to reach out and touch him was nearly overwhelming. Just to know what he felt like, that would be amazing, Steve thought.
her to be. Like you.  More,” Steve went on, a smile, one of the real ones, splitting his face.  “That’s you, Tony.
“…They’re so good. I’m going to tell him they’re your favorites, so you might as well just enjoy them,” Bucky continued as Steve frowned into the darkness. Bucky let out a long, frustrated sigh. “Look, I know this whole show isn’t exactly what you want, but it isn’t every day the King gets married. You could try to enjoy the moment.”
Tony unbuttoned his pants and slid the zipper down.  Cleaning himself up was easy enough, but there was something terrible about it, too.  It felt wrong.  Awful.  Mortifying.  He didn’t want to deal with any of this, but he didn’t have much of a choice. Thanks, biology.  Great assist, there.  This is what you’re made for, he heard echoing in his head.  Why would your body do this if it were meant to be any other way?  A warm, moist hole for an Alpha to put his dick in, and you’ll say thanks afterwards, just like all the rest, he thought bitterly.
Which is how two very well-dressed Avengers ended up at some Formica-tabled diner at nearly midnight, with only some college kids enjoying the free refills of coffee and trying to make a plate of fries and all the free condiments in the joint into a meal for company.  Tony sent them each a burger and a pointed look when one of them took out his phone to start snapping pictures.  “Don’t make me have to destroy you,” Tony warned around a mouthful of onion ring.  Still got it, Tony thought a moment later as the kid stuffed the phone back into his pocket.
“What if the money wasn’t a part of the equation?” Tony asked carefully, echoing his earlier question, but more pointed this time.  He tracked the way Steve’s eyes darted to him and then down to the tabletop, studying his coffee as if it held answers, and found himself in edge, off-kilter somehow as he waited for what those answers might be.
“I’m, ah, glad you enjoyed it, Your Highness.  I must apologize for Lord Stone’s behavior. Most unseemly,” Lord Rand said.
“I’m trying to be disapproving, but it’s hard when it’s so completely awesome,” Tony admitted ruefully, casting an apologetic look at Jarvis.
Good news! Almost to the island. Sex is coming (heh.  God, I have the sense of humor of a 12 year old boy.  And I mean that in the nicest possible way).
Hanging up the phone, Steve hopped on the bus to Penn Station.  From there, he walked a couple of blocks, and sat down at a diner where a pretty waitress brought him coffee.  Taking out his sketchbook and pencil, Steve almost feverishly filled in the skyline.  He didn’t let himself dwell on the fact that the main feature was Stark Tower.  Frankly, he thought it wasn’t exactly the best looking building in the city, but drawing it seemed to let out something he had been holding tightly wound inside of him, like a knot being loosened, just slightly.
He pulled his cock out almost all the way, then shoved himself in again, then repeated the motion, holding the man’s bruised ass apart as he did. There was an echo in his ears, like a rush of waves at the ocean, or rain, he thought strangely, and then realized his cheeks were wet, and he was sobbing, his face twisted into a rictus of pain.
“Yeah, because Tony’s going to handle those kinds of questions about Steve so well,” Rhodes said, staring into the fluorescent light of the open refrigerator.
“I love to see you like this.  So beautiful, without the weight of the world on your shoulders,” Tony sighed softly, his hands running over Steve’s sweat-slicked skin.  “How do you feel?”
“About a mile a minute,” Daniel said, his voice slightly muffled by the wind.  “Seems to be really looking forward to school, I think.  Worried the kids won’t like him, but that’s normal.  I told him if they were mean to him, I’d come kick all these asses.  Shake my cane at them.  Think he got a bit of a laugh out of that.”
Steve blinked slowly at Tony for a moment. "That reference, I understand. Yes.  It would take some time to reach them, though,” Steve said.
“And I wish you could accompany me,” Tony sighed, grazing the back of his knuckles down the side of Steve’s face. “But, that is not to be.  In Koltun, things are...less formal. Lady Van Dyne is quite impressive. You’ll like her, I believe. You can visit her harem. Perhaps it will give you some ideas regarding what we discussed earlier.”
“Yes.  Very much,” Jarvis said with a nod, wrapping his arm around Tony’s shoulders and tugging him into a quick hug.  He smiled, his eyes bright, then nodded shakily at Tony and stepped back.
“Hope.  Hope that we can be better. That all of this, everything he does, every sacrifice he makes that chips away at him, that it can all be worth it one day. That he can better.  Sometimes, he’ll hate you for it. He loves and loathes your faith in him. I think I probably do, too, to tell you the truth,” Rhodes paused, looking over at Steve as they walked down a set of steep steps where the corridor branched off to both sides at the bottom.  Rhodes reached into his tunic and pulled out a small bag, then dumped the contents into his hand, nothing more than a few spare coins.  He plucked one from his palm and held it up.  “See this?  The Royal Crest and Creed.  Means it is official coin of the Crown, backed up by the Treasury.  It holds its value anywhere in the world.”
“Yeah, um…yeah, well, I…I’m…” Steve stumbled on, not really sure how to answer that one.  Why hadn’t he thought this through more?  It had seemed so simple as he buttoned his cufflinks and tied his tie tonight.  “working.  I’m working.  So, um, excuse me.  So sorry, really, I hope I didn’t get anything on you?” Steve finished, glancing down at the man’s suit to look for signs of stains and instead catching onto the fact that the guy was dressed impeccably, in what must have been a custom tailored suit.  Damn. Figures it would be one of the big-wigs he’d literally run into.
He poked a bit longer at the food in his bowl, forcing himself to eat the rest of it.  He still couldn’t let food go to waste, even if he didn’t have much of an appetite.  Finally, he climbed the ladder into the loft and curled up in his bed.  His parents’ bed, then his mother’s bed, was down below, but he had never been able to bring himself to sleep there.  Besides, he liked it up here in the loft, with his window that opened to the mountains and a nice breeze in the summer months, even if he had to board it up in the winter.
“Yours,” Tony said in a deep, throaty voice that barely sounded like his own.  He looked up at Steve.  Licked his lips. “Yours.  Please,” he said.  “Alpha.
“It’s not…that bad,” Steve said with a frown.  Next to him, he heard Tony huff and saw him give a little shake of his head.  “There are lines and blocks.  All the neon colors in these geometric shapes, if you look at it a certain way.  I saw a painting like that once at the Guggenheim.  Sarah Morris. It stuck with me,” Steve said, then dipped his head to his chest and looked over at Tony.
“This…this makes him generous.  I think this,” Steve said, looking around. “May be the farthest thing from what makes him
He was jittery by the time he got to the address. Though the place was in a different location this time, it was easy enough to note the similarities. Nondescript building. Vaguely industrial. Few people scattered about, and not the kind who really paid attention. The building had a sort of lobby this time, more open than the one before. The same desk with the same lap and the same man sat in the center. He wore a navy suit this time instead of grey, but otherwise, everything looked much the same. Eerily unmemorable, Steve thought, though he guessed they probably didn’t cater to too many clients with a perfect memory.
“What have I told you?  Huh? Huh?”  Howard demanded, shouting now, a wet, spittle-filled sound that seemed to fill the kitchen and spill out into the small room where Steve sat riveted to the bed. A sharp sound, then.  Steve’s breath caught, hitched and shuddered. His heart wrenched in his chest, twisting up and pulling his stomach with it, as he tried to swallow back a keen of anger and pain.  He knew that sound far too well.
“I’m just gonna—“ Steve started, holding up his cell phone with one hand and jerking his head towards the balcony that sprawled beyond the French doors, overlooking the Strip. Ms. Potts finally looked up and gave him a quick, distracted nod before turning back to Stark again. He’d been dismissed, Steve decided, and realized that had probably happened long before, and he just hadn’t noticed, which made it worse somehow. The heat hit him as soon as he opened the doors to the balcony, like it had just been laying in wait to find its way inside. Below him, the Strip glittered, waving in the heat of the afternoon sun, lights already beckoning. Not for the first time, he wondered why he hated these lights as much as he missed the way New York lit up, how one could feel so empty and the other like a beacon.   Maybe that had nothing to do with the lights, he thought dully. Vegas was a last resort, desperation writ large, and when he looked at it, he couldn’t see anything else.
“How about we take a look at your place?” Tony asked, clearing his throat as the moment of opportunity slipped past unnoticed by Steve.  Steve nodded and followed Tony’s too-quick footsteps out of the gym without comment.
“What? No,” Tony answered absently. His mind was whirring around something, a shadow in a dark corner that he could just barely see, but it was there. “Maybe,” he amended. “I don’t know—I thought—okay, look, I thought maybe Barnes, you know? Steve’s all,” Tony continued, throwing his hands in the air, which hopefully communicated to Bruce whatever it was Steve was about Barnes, because Tony sure as hell didn’t know. “About him.”
“Speaking of,” Tony said, stepping forward and holding up the six iron and golf ball in his hand.  “How far do you suppose you could hit this?  I’m asking for science.”
“He wasn’t one of Rumlow’s.  Not really. Came in on a raider ship.  They fished him out of the sea, to hear Jasper tell the story.  Half frozen and clinging to part of a ship.  Rumlow just took him off of their hands.  He caused a bit of a ruckus, apparently, and Rumlow got him for a song,” Zola explained.
“That a yes?” Tony questioned, keeping his tone light, but even he could hear the tense hopefulness in it.
“What is this? WHAT IS THIS?” Tyber demanded, scooping up the bone-lion and holding it out for the others to see.  “You see? You see? Look at this—this talisman he keeps! He
“In there?” Jarvis said, reaching over and holding the Walkman up to his face.  “Fascinating. Reminds me a bit of that Vita Ray Detector.  Do you remember that? What ever happened to it, I wonder,” Jarvis mused, his words startling Steve into a frown.
“I love you,” Tony said, his smile widening.  “This is ridiculous and crazy, and I love you.”  He stretched up on his tiptoes and pressed his mouth to Steve’s.  It took Steve a couple of seconds to catch on, but he returned Tony’s kiss with equal gusto when he did.
Then Tony’s mouth was back on his, kissing him so deeply, Steve thought he’d drown from the feel of it, felt himself groan, open his mouth wider and tilt his head to the side to give Tony’s tongue better access.  He heard Tony reach over and grab the tube from the bedside table and his cock, which had been dutifully patient while he’d been admiring the arc reactor, quickly grabbed his full attention.  He felt Tony’s hand, slick and warm, rub down between their bodies to wrap around his cock, stroking up and down.  Then with a deep moan, Tony brought his own cock alongside Steve’s and wrapped his hand around both of them as best he could, continuing to rub up and down, grinding his hips this way and that, letting them slide against each other in a perfect rhythm.  When Tony’s mouth moved down to suckle at Steve’s earlobe, he took the opportunity to run his hands over Tony’s chest, fingers lightly scraping across taut nipples, then tracing the circumference of the arc reactor, eliciting some kind of half-choked noise from Tony, who had moved his mouth down lick at the place where Steve’s neck met his collarbone, but gave a sharp bite as Steve’s fingers circled the reactor.
“This was ours,” Steve said as they came to the small pile that had once been his home. If he closed his eyes, he could still see the curtains his mother had sewn billowing with the breeze off the water.  She had dyed them a dark blue, and Steve had told her it was the same color as her eyes.  He remembered her smile at that, how she had rubbed his back and kissed the top of his head, and how glad he had been to make her happy.  One of the few things his sickly body had allowed him to do, trapped there in the home that was his world, he could find the beauty in anything, and her most of all.
“Steve,” Tony began, almost soothingly, trying to keep the panic out of his voice. He started to take a step forward, but Steve's whole body froze up, and Tony caught himself mid-stride in an aborted attempt to—to do something. “It's okay. No reason to panic. We're both adults here. Let's face it, this was bound to happen. We don't—ah--we can—you know. This. This could be something. I'm just saying—it could be. If you wanted.”
Tony liked him.  The why of it, Steve wasn’t sure of, but he knew it was true.  Tony liked him, as he was, not that servile creature Zola wanted him to be.  He thought Zola might know that, too.  He thought it might worry Zola, just a bit, that he did not know the King as well as he thought he did, and something about the collar Tony had gifted Steve with did more than just worry Zola.  It unnerved the man.  Deeply.  Though, Steve couldn’t fathom why.  Whatever the reason, Zola had no interest in the King’s continued happiness with Steve, of that much he was certain.
“My best friend isn’t who he was before the War.  Probably none of us are, but him more than others. I spent a lot of time blaming myself for that.  Maybe fairly, maybe not, I can’t say I know for sure these days. But, he’s alive. I’m alive. We still have each other, and maybe it isn’t going to be what it was or what I thought it would be, when I thought about the two of us after the War, but it can still be something good,” Steve told him.  He could make out a little bit of the red and gold now, glinting off the sun where it lit the water. He smiled, wrapping his hands together, his jaw tightening as he tried to think of what it was he wanted to say.
Tony shrugged and grabbed the pancakes again. "Yeah," he said and shoved a bite in his mouth. "Bu' wike uh shaid," he said through the mouthful, "twial wun."
"Yeah, I… I wouldn't know the first thing about a girl. I have some experience being a boy, so I sort of know what to do there. Boys still shoot marbles and play 'kick the can,' right?"
"Pep, sweetie-pie, you've really got to calm down. You're going to give yourself a stroke or an ulcer or something."
"Well," he said and took the picture back when Hill handed it over, "maybe I'm a little more old- fashioned than you think."
She reached for him to pick her up, and, without thinking, he scooped her up and settled her onto his lap, and she yawned and set the pillow on the worktable and then leaned forward to rest on it.
"The TV." She nodded at the contraption on the wall, eyebrow still raised and mouth pursed into what he could only describe as a patronizing frown. "We lost the signal."
"No, I mean it," he murmured, his lips just brushing Tony's shoulder and his breath ghosting over his skin. "Irish food with the Irish kid."
Tony matched his hint of a smile. "Look, what I meant to say before I was so rudely interrupted was that I know I can be an ass, but I'm just… I'm not looking to sell you out here. I'm just curious."
"Look," Tony said and set his fork down. "What are we going to do? Come out and say Cap and Natasha are just really good friends? Which isn't
Bruce sighed and ran a hand over his face. "Yeah, you're probably right," he murmured and glanced around for anything that would entertain a four-year-old until her father's — her
"I was thinking. With that charity ball coming up, and I know you want to just get in and get out, but you know how those things go. Yeah, you wine and dine and you socialize and glad-hand — sorry about that — but there's usually dancing involved at these things, and that can be a nightmare if you don't know what you're doing, and I have it from a reliable source that you don't know what you're doing. So, how 'bout it?"
"So, I just want you to keep all this in mind from now until the end of time, OK? I know you weren't here to see it, but I'm sure Bruce could give you a play-by-play of it, and I just want you to remember what I went through for you. I want you to remember what I did for you. I want you to remember the punishing abuse your child put my body through. And yes, she's a cutie, and yes, I love her, but
"What? That maybe you did it on purpose? That you'd finally gotten me as you'd actually be able to accept me? That you knew I'd have to stay like this if you got me like that?"
kidnapped my fiancé and took him god-knows-where — honest to god, Thor threw him over his massive shoulder and carried him out of here like a fucking caveman — and I'm stuck here at home using Rhodey's phone because he doesn't trust me to use my own or even
Steve finally pushed himself to a sitting position. "Yeah, uh," he said and raked a hand through his hair — his decidedly short hair. That was new. "Maybe I'm not as awake as you think I am?"
"All right," Barton said with a sigh and leaned over Tony to fiddle with the releases. The suit opened up, and Tony sat up, breathing in fresh air and suddenly realizing that he'd kind of been short on oxygen.
Tony nodded at him. "Like I said, there you go. Toast his memory, light a candle for him if you need to, but don't throw yourself into some overblown mourning. You know he wouldn't want you to do that. You know he'd want you to go on living your life."
He shook his head some and picked up his champagne flute again. "Good god, no. I don't want any more of you than there already are. But you're right. It would make a prime location for unethical human experimentation, wouldn't it?"
He stopped and turned back toward Tony. "Yeah," he said, but Tony couldn't tell what sort of tone or sentiment was behind it. It wasn't as closely-cropped as Steve's was, but it was short and neat, and Tony couldn't help but wonder if it was a superficial change for him or if it meant something a little deeper than that.
' Not 'a girl,' just 'someone.'" He went quiet a moment before he glanced at Tony and said, "I wish she coulda met you."
"Hey," Steve said, reaching up with his other hand to cup it around the hand he already held, his face sober and serious, "you know all that, right? Don't ever doubt that for a second. It's you and me, together through all of this, got it? I am
Welch put his hands up all innocent-like. "I'm not looking for anything, Captain. You're not going to throw me out into the street again, are you?"
Again, few of the words Tony spouted made any sense, and so Steve opted to ignore him. He eyed up the snow-covered road ahead of him. The snow plow hadn't done that swell a job clearing it, now that he thought about it. "How do you have any control of this car? I didn't see chains on your tires."
"). He hadn't noticed anything for himself or Tony from any of these people — well, except for 'Your Best Pal, Clint,' from whom, as it turned out, they'd received membership in a 'jelly of the month' club.
"You hold onto the headboard and nothing else, understand me? You are not allowed to touch yourself. You are not allowed to talk. You are not allowed to moan. You do everything I tell you and nothing else. Do you understand? Say 'Yes, Sir,' if you do."
But it was weighing on his mind, the same as something else Steve had mentioned about a week before that was weighing on his mind as well. Maybe he'd read too many parenting articles, maybe he'd watched too many videos or TV shows or whatever, but Steve was concerned that he had, well, nothing. Oh, not in terms of finances or material possessions — not
Olivia just gurgled at her and slapped her hands happily on the highchair tray, and as Steve watched Tony reach over and pick Olivia out of her highchair to settle her on his lap, a dark part of him thought that maybe it wasn't even a problem any longer that he was practically immortal. The way things were going, some Hydra goon would find those Infinity gems or whatever Thor had called him and attempt to lay them all to waste before Olivia was even out of diapers.
Bruce turned to him, the engines of the 'jet gearing up, and a suited-up Wilson called out from the loading ramp, "Nat! Let's go!"
Tony made a displeased noise in the back of his throat and didn't even try to hide the fact that he was rolling his eyes. Bruce just stared at him flatly before he continued.
Bruce laughed some more, that nervous laugh that he had, and scratched the back of his head as he said, "There…was a bet of some kind."
"Good thing about being head of security, former boss," he said as he maneuvered the car through traffic. "Get to make these kinds of executive decisions. Where to, boss?"
Her face went a little pinched all of a sudden, her eyes narrowing, her lips pursing, and a deep crease forming between her brows. It startled him a bit because up until that moment, even Tony could admit that she bore a striking resemblance to him — much as he hated to admit that — but this…this was not him. At all.
To Steve's surprise and continued confusion, Wilson just laughed. "Man, the universe just loves to fuck with you two, doesn't it. Hey!" he added and shot Tony a knowing look. "Nothing else
Still, that didn't stop the nagging little voice in the back of his head — the one that taunted him and pointed out his deficiencies, the one that had suddenly found something new and something devastating to bother him with. One little thought that he could oh-so-easily convince himself of because, honestly, he was pretty sure no matter how you shook it, it was completely 100% true.
He liked Peggy. He could even see himself falling for her. He could see himself marrying her and maybe even having a family with her. She was beautiful, she was smart, and she was filled to the brim with moxie. She was everything he told himself he'd ever wanted in a dame— broad —
," came JARVIS's dulcet tones from what Steve would always and forever consider the ceiling (which was why he would always and forever look up when JARVIS spoke), "

"No? So, you're saying that Steve Rogers would be totally cool with all that's gone on? Aliens. Your government trying to kill you. Marrying a dude that looks like a lady. Before you downed that plane, could you have imagined any of that shit? Would you have just shrugged it off as easily as you do now?"
"Leashed, arms tied up behind his back, trussed up in a tight harness, some kind of ball-gag in his mouth—
It wasn't until he'd begun to prune that he decided it he'd spent enough time in there and shut the water off. He let some of the excess water drip off before he stepped out and actually jumped at the figure that stared back at him from the broad and defogged mirror directly across from him — at his paunch and wrinkles and graying hair. Fucking air-circulating vent fan keeping the condensation from building up. He averted his gaze, like he was afraid of catching something he didn't want to see, and he had just gained the courage to be able to look at himself in the mirror again when the already-ajar door pushed open some more, and Steve stuck his head in and said, "Tony? I'm taking Livvy downstairs for her bottle."
think I would have kept my mouth shut about it if I didn't want it? You have heard me chew you out about backwashing, right?"
Steve sighed and watched as Sam and Bucky began to deposit the boxes of elegantly wrapped gifts beneath the tree...somewhere... There really wasn't that much room left.
No. That didn't… No, that wasn't— The mannerisms, the photographs, the kind-of-looks-like-a-dark-haired-Steve-if-you-squint…
But the nurse just smiled and wrote something down on a sheet of paper before she reached out and pulled up the measuring rod then set about recording his height.
"Olivia, you probably shouldn't do that," he said, a warning tone in his voice, and she pouted a little and shrank down but stopped bouncing as she ate her sandwich.
Bucky scoffed and began to follow Sam back to the elevator. "Yeah, I'm gonna let Thor in on a secret stash of food so he can eat it all on me. I'm not that much of an idiot. I make no promises about Natalia, though."
Sure enough, the news station was playing the usual footage of some congressman walking through corridors while the host and guests debated over what this meant for any charges he might face and what his political future as well as the party's might be.
The man — who, dear God, must have, at the very least, been about forty — made a slightly bemused face and said, "Are you asking me if it is?"
"Iron Eyes Cody!" Barton said like he'd just remembered something, and Wilson nodded at him and said, "Yeah, that's right!"
that thing had felt inside of him, and Steve hedged a little and said, "Tony, I don't know if that's such a good—"
"You spend enough time staring at Steve's mouth," Bruce said with a sly smile. "You'd think a few words would register every now and then."
"Ideally," she said as she stepped over and began to pull and tug at things, "I'd have you come in for
She shrugged like she didn't know and couldn't be bothered, and Tony nodded and gazed at the photograph a little more, squinting at it as he peered at the blonde, smiling sister with the oversized plastic sunglasses pushed over-top of her head. She looked familiar — they both looked familiar — in some way that he couldn't quite put his finger on. Perhaps he'd just seen this photograph somewhere before. In fact, he was sure he had. That must have been why they looked so familiar or seemed so familiar.
"But it's the truth. It's what's gotta happen. Brucie did the ultrasound. I've got parts inside of me that I shouldn't have, and one of those parts is housing something that shouldn't ever be inside my body."
"I'm pretty sure there're people out there that think Captain America doesn't even know what sex is."
At the same time, he was ashamed to accept the praise because…because that meant that, on some level, he
Steve blinked, unsure of exactly what Tony's aim was, and he stuttered and stumbled over his words a bit before he pointed down the small hall and said, "Uh, yeah, down there."
It could have been that the witch was exaggerating or downright lying to get her way, but the witch had also been privy to information that she could not possibly have known. It was quite possible that she was telling the truth — that this was the only way that King Anthony could ever produce an heir. It was also possible that the witch's powers were not as vast and as great as she herself thought. There may have been jokes when the King was young, but there could be no doubt that the King was as much a man as any of they were, and history — and God — had proven that men just did not conceive.
But Esmeralda just smiled as soon as he'd made mention of defending his baby, as though it was exactly what she'd wanted to hear.
He didn't know why the name had popped into his head, though seeing Barnes and Natasha sitting next to each other brought back a snippet of a memory associated with that name, but he shook his head and waited for the confusion from the crowd to abate. Everyone else looked perplexed, but Steve just turned to him and said, "'Madge' or 'Madelyn,' maybe? Why?"
Steve frowned a little at him, almost like he was insulted by what Tony was insinuating. "How 'bout what?"
He looked up again and met Steve's eyes, and he reached up ever so gently and lifted his long, dark hair off his neck and shoulders to allow for Steve to fasten the collar around him. Steve's gaze burned into his, and he stared pointedly at Tony and said, "Are you absolutely sure? Don't do this only because you think I want this."
Steve buttoned and zipped then moved so he was crowding into Tony's space, and he took Tony's face in his hands and tilted his head up at him. "But you've dealt with it far better than I ever could," he murmured and stroked his thumbs very gently over Tony's blush-highlighted cheekbones. "I really am just so proud of you."
The others all murmured their agreement as they sat staring at the TV, and Tony rolled his eyes while Steve went over and switched the set off, engendering groans from the Avengers, Wilson, and Rhodey, who was still in town.
"This isn't like— I lost seventy years of my life. But I didn't lose… I know now I lost a 'what might have been.' This isn't a 'what might have been.' This is a 'what is,' and I can't lose that. I couldn't— I couldn't survive that."
Tony hummed and went up on his toes to nuzzle into Steve's neck. "Well, we wouldn't want Captain America getting fat now, would we?"
Steve nodded and put his finger beneath Tony's chin to tilt his head up toward him. He brought his mouth down and met Tony's lips with his own, all warm and tender and gentle and caring, and in the periphery, he heard Barton say, "Well, if there's one good thing about them getting married it's that marriage usually kills the romance, so at least they'll stop making us suffer through this shit."
, and Steve was never going to stand between Tony and what Tony needed. Tony might hate him, might scream at him and throw things at him and tell him he hated him, but Tony would see, somewhere down the line, that Steve was right. There were certain things in life that were known and accepted. Tony Stark, the heir to the Stark Industries fortune, shacking up with some broke art student, was not one of those things.
So, he tried to think about what would come after the war, but every time he began to wonder what might happen once the war was over (he was certain the war would be over next year at this time), a nerve-wracking jolt of guilt flooded his veins. Even if Steve lived to see another Christmas, Bucky never would, and Bucky had only been where he'd been because Steve had asked…
"Because you are human and because you are so hung up on ideas like 'male' and 'female.' I suppose it is because only your females can bear life. Your males are made for nothing but inseminating."
"Hard on her?" he asked and pushed away from Bruce as he moved over to the worktable. "Hard on her?" he asked and sat down, putting pressure on his hand to stop the blood. It was coming through the gauze, but again, fuck it. "First of all, she appeared out of thin air. I am under no obligation to her whatsoever. Second, because of her, the best thing that's ever happened to me decided we're better off as friends. Third—"
He continued to laugh, and Steve reached out and rubbed his arms and said, "Uh, sorry? I don't, um—"
"Can we see?" Hill asked, and Tony heaved out a breath and opened the door to show them what he looked like. He held his breath as he waited for them to make their judgment on him, and both women just gave him knowing and approving smiles before Natasha said, "I told you," and Hill replied with, "I never doubted you for a second."
He averted his gaze, unable to take the pity he saw staring back at him from his oldest friend, and he expected a rebuttal along the lines of what Bruce had given him, but instead, Rhodey just reached out, clamped a solid grip of his shoulder, and said, "You know you're the one that has to explain this to the Captain, right?"
They both shook their heads, and Tony nodded his understanding then picked up his bag and slapped it on the table, stuffing the box into it before he took a deep breath and braced himself on the table to push himself to his feet.
difficult to explain Natasha Carbonell's attendance to the other attendees, especially given the rampant media speculation about her and Steve and what their relationship was doing to the Avengers.
Tony rolled his eyes. "Fuck's sake, Steve. Grab a sock like everyone else. Or— You know what? Get out here. I'll jerk it for you."
Barnes seemed to feel like he'd become the proverbial third wheel, as he said a somewhat hesitant, "Uh, I can come back later if you need…"
"Yeah," Steve said with a nod and a small smile. "You deserve it. You've been cooped up here the past couple months, and though I know you could be happy the rest of your life if we just left you down in your lab to tinker and toy, I know even you need to get out in the world every so often."
"Really thought he'd be noisier," Barnes said, and Tony didn't even have the energy to open his eyes and glare at him. "You know," he continued because clearly the idiot didn't know any better, "like the ones you see on TV or in the movies."
Bruce hit a few buttons on the set and said, "That's why I said he should go to a real doctor, but if you think you're seeing what I think I'm seeing..." He shook his head. "It's not possible. It's just not possible."
Tony took his glass back over to the table and sat down again. "Look, six months ago, I would be totally right behind you on all this, but I've seen things that I would never have believed back then. I've fought aliens —
As they'd discovered early on in the field, they worked well as a team, and as a parenting team this was no different. Steve, as he often was wont to do, generally took charge, instituting a rigid schedule he insisted was just as much for the baby's sake as it was for Tony's. But infants didn't always like to go along with that, and both Steve and Tony suffered their share of sleepless nights when they just couldn't get her to settle, and Tony, at one point, burst into tears and said he couldn't do it any longer and he didn't know why.
the 'White Christmas' he'd heard since the day that lousy record was released. Maybe it was a live radio theatre recording, but it didn't sound like it. The balance was too good for it to be live. It didn't… It wasn't right.
Tony stroke and play with himself? He could still see that look of wanton desperation in Steve's eyes, the pupils blown so wide as to make his blue eyes look almost black in the dim light, the way he'd tentatively reached out a hand, so desperate to
," he finished, clipped. "I'm sorry, are you trying to imply something, sweetheart? And how would we even prove that, huh? Some private investigator swears an oath to it? You want some investigator poring over pictures of me
But thinking about anything like that was a bad, bad idea. Not just because that was an alternate universe, and the Cap in this 'verse was as straight as an arrow, but because he'd just gotten out of a serious relationship, and only an idiot would jump headfirst — even in his own mind — into another one so soon after the fact.
Tony waggled his eyebrows. "Because as much of a whore as I'm made out to be by the media, I'm not an exhibitionist, and your pal Stevie over there has a very unique viewpoint of what constitutes 'helping' me in my workshop— Or, what did you call it? Church?" He hummed a little in thought. "It's not untrue, is it?"
He wasn't sure whether this was a dream or reality, but he said a silent prayer for it to be real, and he said another prayer that he might have just a little more time here to figure things out. Not just a day (if that's what this was) but…but just a little longer. He hadn't learned everything he was supposed to learn, he didn't think, and he wasn't ready to let it go. Not just yet.
Steve just blinked at Tony. "Rule 63?" he murmured and Tony smiled a little at him, brown eyes soft and twinkling with what Steve knew was untold amounts of love and affection.
Bruce nodded his agreement before he frowned and put a hand to Tony's shoulder. "I'm sorry, Tony. You all right?"
"That, too, kiddo," Tony said, and Steve reached out and gently moved her feet so that her legs were hanging from her seat. "Thanks," Tony told him, but Steve just shrugged and mumbled that it was nothing then asked, "Can she have Chinese food?"
Steve shrugged. "Well, you seem so convinced that I'm going to drop you like a hot potato when you don't turn back to your old self the moment you, uh…"
Steve dropped his crust to the side then reached into the box for another slice. "And I told you. I would have been fine with it just being the two of us having dinner."
now; it sucks — and this over-marinated douchebag corners me and starts trying to come on to me. I duck around him, and he follows me and corners me again. I very politely tell him he's wasting his time because I've already got someone. He says, 'Is he here?' I said, 'What makes you think it's a he?' Then, you know what he says? Tells me he doesn't believe that because I don't look like a 'carpet muncher.' What the fuck? Yeah, that's the sort of sweet-talk a woman wants to hear when you're trying to get into her pants."
"Mmm..." Tony said with a nod as he drank another sip of coffee. "You notice the way she's been gnawing on her hand the past day or two? I'm just hoping the crankiness holds off until after Christmas is over."
Steve folded his arms again, once more tucking his hands into his armpits. "She's not gonna wanna go."
bathroom for just the two of us." He grinned a little. "How does a suite at the Four Seasons sound?"
He put his hands on Tony's shoulders and pulled him into his space, leaning down to brush his lips against Tony's temple then his forehead, cheeks, nose, and finally mouth. Tony stood there like a stone statue and allowed him, swallowing to keep his composure, keeping his eyes open and staring ahead at the wall to keep from melting into it.
wanted to get married, they just got married. None of this 'prenup' or 'postnup' business. You just got married."
"Oh, my god, Steve!" he all but cried, dropping his arms as he leaned over the table some. "I swear to god, if you don't get inside me soon, I'm going to jump on you and do it myself!"
"Mmm…might be easier to do if it was produced by some bullshit outfit instead of Twentieth-Century Fox."
Tony glanced up and tilted his head to the side like he was considering this, and he rocked from side-to-side like he was testing something out before he said, "Kinda sore, but in a good way, I guess. Never had it there before. I mean, until, like, an hour ago, I never had one of those before. It definitely... It has its perks. Lot to be said for natural lubrication."
"I believe I heard something about your government paying you a considerable sum for, oh, how do you say, leaving you in a block of ice for seventy years."
Tony rolled his eyes again. "No," he said and took another bite, and through a mouthful of food, he added, "when I got turned into a woman, I completely forgot how to correctly interpret the meaning of the words, 'Yeah, OK, Tony. We'll go out on a date tonight.'"
Tony closed the doors and went back over to the counter where he'd stacked all the goods, and Steve nodded his understanding as Olivia began to whine. He frowned at her and said an unsure, "Uh…?"
an Adonis. Have you looked at yourself since 1942? I mean, even before then, the pictures I've seen, you had this cute little stubbornness about you. But since then?
"Practicing your 'smooth moves' in front of the mirror doesn't count as 'kicking ass,'" Barnes replied as he worked at puling the streamers down from the ceiling.
"Yeah? Well, that stops now. No one is dragging my family through the mud to sell papers or boost ratings or get…
Natasha shook her head, never faltering in her light and soothing strokes down the sides of his face. "That's not what I'm saying at all. But Steve needs to feel useful. He needs to feel like he has a purpose, like he's doing something. And there's really nothing for him to do until you start pushing. That could be five minutes from now, or it could be five days from now."
Steve turned his head some more in an attempt to block as much of Tony from his view as he could. "'Disgusted' isn't the word I'd use."
"You still saved him," Steve said, and there was nothing but warmth and gratitude emanating from him as he added, "Thank you."
Rhodey exhaled a heavy sigh and said, "Whatever, man. Look, maybe this is all just a big misunderstanding—"
Tony grabbed the arrows he'd been working on the other day and went about configuring a slight tweak in their aerodynamic capabilities.
"Yeah," Tony said. "I get that feeling, too. If I'm reading him right, he's got a bit of a soft spot for her. Gotta be something more to it, right?"
," Bruce countered quickly, "you said it's been happening for a while, so, I'm more confident in saying you're probably closer to delivering than, well, not."
He shook his head. "I'm not sleeping up there. Pepper sure as fuck isn't. Someone might as well use it."
to attract anyone under seventy? Is he even thinking? He looks like a fucking model, he— he dresses and acts like he's from the forties!"
He pulled away from Steve some to get a better look at it, and as Barnes wheeled it closer, Tony saw it was one of his tool carts they were using, and on top of it was a cake littered in lit candles.
But Steve was looking at him in that devious way that he got when he was calling Tony's bluff. "You'll go to a real medical doctor if I go with you? Fine, I'll go with you."
It didn't matter. This wasn't her, she had never belonged to him, and what made Bruce think he would even
"I fear for what he might use the scepter," Thor said, piling his bagel with deli meats and cheeses he'd pulled from the fridge. "Even Loki knew not what power it possessed. I fear for what trouble a mere mortal may cause with it."
Tony blew out a breath. "If we ignore the whole 'soul mate' theory, easiest way to explain it is that we're just two very powerful life forces, and the fate of the entire galaxy rests upon us getting and keeping our act together. Again, it sounds egotistical, but it's kind of true."
"If she does know anything, she certainly gives a good impression of pretending not to. She had a little girl, Maria—" She motioned to a photo of the photographer that Tony hadn't bothered to look at, one of the photographer in that same mini dress sitting on the floor and playing with an infant. "She disappeared along with her."
"I guess it couldn't hurt," he mused as Steve's phone buzzed, and he watched as Steve sat up, pulled it out of his pocket, looked at it, then frowned and sighed a little.
"I'm sorry," Tony said and turned a little in Steve's arms so he could direct his attention fully to
He sat there staring at the ceiling a moment, trying to process what JARVIS had just told him before he said, "Has anyone, I don't know, tried to talk to Steve about this?"
"Buck wouldn't—" he started to say in reply but just shook his head and shut his mouth like it wasn't worth the effort, and Tony stuffed the bite of food in his mouth then went to cut himself off another.
Tony stood up to get a better look as Rhodey added, "At least, according to her. Should she be doing that?"
He'd never given much thought to children or a family. He hadn't exactly felt the love from his parents (at least, he hadn't felt the love from Howard, that was for sure), and he was aware of the fact that he was, at times, too much like his father for comfort, which didn't exactly bode well for his own parenting skills (or lack thereof). He didn't detest the thought of children, and he had no desire to bring one into the world simply so that he would have someone to hand the company to on his deathbed, but he'd be lying if he didn't admit that there was a part of him that had thought, for a brief flicker of a moment when things were at their peak with Pepper, that maybe, just
"We could always do something about that," Steve said, only to be interrupted by that cockblocker named JARVIS, who said, "
Tony hummed a little as Steve sat back on his heels, and he blinked and took in his surroundings, finding himself in Tony's workshop in the tower. Oh, right. Yeah. That's where they were. He'd kind of forgotten where they'd been the past several minutes, his mind totally and completely set on just, well — god, he hated to say it, but his mind totally and completely set on fucking Tony. That hadn't been 'making love' — not as he understood it, anyway. That had been totally and completely about fucking Tony.
Steve just shrugged and set the baby on his shoulder, patting her back gently to burp her, and Tony rolled his eyes.
But Steve, that jerk, just sat up now, and he made to turn back to put the light on, and Tony cried out, "No, don't!"
Bucky shivered. "Thank fuck," he said, and Steve vowed then and there never to admit the truth to him. "Guy gave me the creeps. Anyway, my point is—"
Tony shrugged and went back to picking at his own plate. "Not your fault. No big deal. Not something I really want to talk about on Christmas, though, so if we could change the subject…"
He opened his eyes and was greeted with the darkness of the room, faint moonlight streaming into the windows.
?) called 'Hulk'; storybooks from 'Uncle Rhodey'; some weird robot thing called a 'BB-8' as well as a guide to dealing with overprotective parents from 'Uncle Sam'; a set of crystal figurines from 'Wanda and Vision'; coloring books and crayons from 'Thor' ("
"After everything you already ate?" Bruce asked, and Tony glanced up at him and stared daggers at him.
Steve chuckled a little and turned his head to brush his lips against Tony's forehead. "Well, if it's any consolation, you've been absolutely amazing throughout this whole thing. You've been so strong and so capable and so self-assured. I told you, I couldn't have done it. I couldn't have handled it — not as well as you have."
. Like, I could feel— When that thing was fucking me, I could feel—" He shook his head. "I don't want that. I don't want to feel that. I want to feel you. I want to know you're the only one that's ever been inside me like that. Not them. Not—"
Steve considered his words a moment, twisting the ring on his own finger. He didn't believe Tony. Not in the least. It would be nice,
Tony startled awake, gasping, pouring sweat. He blinked several times and tried to acquaint himself with his surroundings.
Steve sat on the edge of the bed, and he checked his tablet one more time, set it aside, took a quick drink of water from the glass on the table beside the bed, then turned back to him.
"You suck so beautifully," Steve whispered in his ear. "You're so good at it. I love to watch your lips stretch over my cock and over my fingers. I wish you could see yourself. I wish you could see how beautiful you look doing this."
Tony seemed to stand there a moment, arms still folded and breasts still holstered up, as he evidently contemplated Steve's admission, and he nodded and said, "Well, to tell you the truth, I don't know what's going on, but I've been desperate to have you inside me in places that never before existed for me since, like, the second I opened my eyes after that...weird...chick did whatever she did to me, so..."
Tony hoped it didn't show how much it hurt to hear Steve use masculine pronouns so easily when talking about the rambunctious little parasite growing inside of him.
there — as having his husband there, the father of the very child he was giving birth to. He didn't get to have
Steve responded by slamming Stark against the edge of the table. He pinned him there, Stark sandwiched there between the table and Steve’s front as Steve used one hand to hold Stark’s wrists together then reached down and swept an arm over the table to clear it off, knocking various towels and tools and papers onto the floor.
He took a sip through the tiny straw, and he pulled back and smacked his lips at the soothing taste of cola.
Pepper just smiled a little and nodded like it now made perfect sense to her. "I see." She considered this a little longer then said, "No girl's name?"
He sniffled and blinked another stream of tears down his face, only realizing then he'd spent the past several minutes rubbing his bruised hand against his belly. He stilled the motion, letting his hand rest against the swell, and got a little bump against the inside of his abdominal wall for it. He choked out a cry and signaled to move over to the shoulder before he lost control of himself, and after getting the car securely stopped, he threw it into park and hugged his arms around his belly, resting his forehead against the top of the steering wheel as he sobbed out everything. All the hurt, all the pain, all the anger, all the humiliation, all the fear, all the contempt, all the worry, all the doubt, all the suspicion...
DUM-E watched him a moment more before he seemed satisfied that Tony wasn't in any actual danger, and he lowered his claw once again to go back to playing with the piece of paper, and Tony went over to the couch to grab a pillow, giving the 'bot a gentle pat on the support strut as he waddled past.
He struggled to his feet and cleaned himself up in the bathroom — Steve, evidently, had turned the shower water off at some point — and he yawned and rubbed his belly and made his way into the kitchen—
Bruce rubbed his eyes beneath his glasses. "I can't believe I'm asking this, but Tony, when you and Cap…did it…when you were a woman, did you…did you use any contraceptives?"
He continued to rub at his lower back, and Natasha watched him a moment then said in a soft voice, "You know, Steve might make it back in time yet."
Tony laughed and continued to let Steve play with his hand. "However you want, babe. Could have taken mine. Could have taken yours. Could have made up our own. We decided to hyphenate. Legally, we're both 'Stark-Rogers.' And it's
like Tony Stark (or what they thought Tony Stark to look like)? Yeah, that might be kind of fun to watch.
"A little," Bruce conceded. "Doesn't appear anyone's thought to actually check the clerk's office for a marriage license, and if they have, evidently the one they found doesn't match up with their narrative, so they don't know what to do with it."
And then, because Steve Rogers was the most mature ninety-five-year-old in the history of mankind, he made the most over-the-top disgusted face Tony had ever seen on anyone.
"If I have to call Ms. Potts, the CEO of Stark Industries," he said, mustering as much stern authority to imbue the words with dark warning as he could, "to verify my claim, you are going to be
"I'm sorry about your daughter, though. Seems like… Seems like you two kind of hit it off. That was her chirping in the background — when I was on the phone with you, I mean — wasn't it?"
this baby, right? She didn't say anything about keeping it. I just— I mean, I guess I just assumed that we would…"
He put a fresh diaper on her, making sure to powder her as he did so, and he snapped the dark red MIT onesie back together and said, "Well, I guess you're down for the count," at the now-sleeping infant. "Now who am I supposed to play with?" he teased and picked her up to carry her over to the crib. He set her down then leaned over and kissed her forehead before he finished cleaning up the mess from the diaper-changing — and Tony said he was a slob that would gladly live in his own filth! — and went back downstairs.
Again, Tony went to open his mouth to reply, but Wilson said, "He's gonna deny it, but we all know it's true. He could literally blow up the world, and Cap would find some way of excusing it while we all sat on our little floating space rock foraging for space worms or whatever would be left to eat."
But Tony shook his head and said, "No, no, it's not you," and ran his hands up Steve's back until he could cup them over his broad shoulders. "It's not that. It's just— I was just thinking. You're mine. You belong to me. Legally, you actually belong to me now."
He didn't even have to ask JARVIS to take him down to the lab. JARVIS had seemingly read his mind, as the next time the doors opened, it was to his lab level.
It was a long drive back to the city, a good deal of which he spent speaking into thin air under the guise that he was talking to his underdeveloped fetus because...why not? No one else to talk to.
And then, from the middle of the heretofore silent group, Barnes blew into one of those unfurling, squawking noisemakers, a cheesy 'Happy Birthday!' pointed hat on his head, and yet somehow, a glowering look on his face.
"Huh," Tony said. He scooped out some gelato and stuck it in his mouth, and after swallowing down the chocolaty goodness, he turned to Steve and said, "They went to the beach."
Tony pulled up a schematic for a new suit, completely forgetting he was supposed to be working on a way to get the kid home. "She's not from the future. She's from an alternate universe."
of him already — but not before Steve came home!), but he was still fucking Tony Stark. He was Iron Man. He'd built a fucking flying suit of armor in a cave in Afghanistan with an electromagnet embedded in his chest. He'd flown a goddamned nuke strapped to his back into a wormhole to another dimension. He'd taken down a terrorist with nothing but his guts, his brains, and a little help from his friends (the fact that two of those friends happened to be the War Machine and Captain America was beside the point). He'd become a fugitive from his own government because his boyfriend hadn't liked the looks of things and had all but declared war on it (OK, it was actually a war against the evil organization that had embedded itself into the government, but whatever; technicalities). He had done all of that, and he'd come out of it stronger than ever before.
While the details for Tony's big revelatory press conference were being worked out (Steve wanted every 'I' dotted and 'T' crossed if they were really going out there like that), Tony thought it might be fun to get the public worked up a little bit first.
Tony sucked in a breath and settled himself onto the bench. "Sure," he said then grumbled and reached into his pocket. He pulled out that little black cellphone and looked at it, and his lips twitched in amusement at whatever he saw there.
It was a quiet, simple affair with padded chairs and tables and magazines and a television in the corner that was airing some daytime cooking program. There were only about a handful of women at current, and of them, only maybe two of them were noticeably pregnant. The others were either not far enough along or just there for an annual gynecological exam.
They stopped outside the office, the rest of the bureau all but dead thanks to it being technically after-hours. Tony waited outside the office door with Natasha and Rhodey (and Pepper and Happy) while Hill, Thor, and Bruce slipped in to see if everything was set up, and he considered the bouquet in his hands and said, "Honestly, I thought if I ever got married, I'd be the one wearing the tux and not the white dress."
conceived. That was the God-given duty and provenance of women. Men did not, and it seemed unlikely that even the spells and potions of the Red Witch could change such a fact.
He'd lost all track of time after they'd tried to convince him that Steve had… He'd lost all track of time after that, and even through his resolve of
Not at first. He knew he wasn't at first. He knew what he had with Steve was special. He knew when Steve looked at him he saw his world. But then
"—you really into that sort of thing, Stevie?" Barnes asked and made a face at Steve like he wasn't sure what to think of him any longer.
Wilson gave a slightly jerky nod, and he reached out and grabbed the bottle. Tony had presumed he'd just pass it over to Barnes, but instead, he popped the cap and began to squirt it onto his own plate. Like an idiot, Tony thought he was just taking some for himself before he gave it to Barnes, but instead, he continued to squirt, the puddle of red goop on his plate getting larger and larger, and Tony watched out of the corner of his eye as Barnes scowled and shook his head some more but continued to watch as Wilson emptied the remainder of the bottle onto his plate, giving a few pathetic shakes and squirts to get the rest of it out. Once he'd gotten out everything that he could, he turned to Barnes and held up the empty bottle of ketchup and said, "Yeah, man, sorry, I just used the last of it."
But Steve just shook his head and said, "He walked away. He saw me. He knew me. And he walked away."
Barton waited until Steve had gone into the kitchen to get something then said to Tony, "Nice color for a baby's room."
He shrugged and plugged in the necessary parameters to the program. "Wasn't really paying attention. Didn't think I'd need to care—"
"Babe, no one's going to come after you for it. Honest. I mean, yeah, you get some fundies after you to repent your ungodly ways, but seriously, no one cares— No, I tell a lie. The gossip sites are after us for dirt constantly because anything about the Avengers is pure clickbait for them, and they're whores for that sort of shit. But other than that? I mean, honestly, no one's going to throw Steve Rogers in jail for fucking Tony Stark. The most they'd do is throw you under the bus."
didn't as the day passed without note, and when they climbed into bed that night, Steve was just about to turn out the light when he said, "Oh,
It was the Battle of New York that had cast his one-time hero in a new light, and maybe he really was as valiant and inspiring as the propaganda — and Howard — had made him out to be. They'd parted the battle as comrades, and when Steve had come to live in the tower with the rest of the misfits, they'd forged a fragile friendship that became something more and something deeper as they bonded over their shared lots in life: mainly, having been heavily influenced by Howard Stark and having been cast into very public roles that neither one truly desired.
“Well, yeah, I mean…Steve, he’s—he’s nice and all, and…okay, kind of amazing, but just because he, you know, does stuff for me, doesn’t mean—it doesn’t mean he feels the same way I do.  The company—“ Tony stammered, feeling his mouth go dry.
Steve sighed and dropped his fork with a clatter, rubbing his hands over his face and grinding the heels of his palms against his eyes.
“I imagine you do,” the alien agreed.  “Please,” he said, holding his hands wide.  “I will answer if I can.”
“I always wondered where that story came from. I am not disappointed,” Tony said over a low chuckle.
“Head wound. Not serious, but must’ve stung like a sonofabitch.  Dinner platter, followed by right hook, I’d say. Nicely done. He’s pretty well out,” the Robin Hood cosplayer apparently called Clint said, standing up from where he had been kneeling by Obie.  “Got cuffs on him, just in case,” he added, handing Steve back his belt. “Take a look at this bit of tech. I’m betting this is not exactly sold in stores,” Clint continued, raising his eyebrows in speculation as he held the tiny sonic device that Obie had used up to the light.
Tony twisted around and rolled over into the warm hardness of Steve’s chest.  He laid his head over where the scar would have been, if Steve did normal things like scar and listened to the muted thwump-thwump of Steve’s heartbeat echo in his ear.  He tucked his hands up between them and grasped the dog tags in his fist, closing his eyes as he held them and let Steve hold him.  Maybe not so separate, he thought blearily, opening his eyes and looking up at Steve.  Steve’s face was curved into that soft, gentle look he got sometimes when he looked at Tony, his eyes crinkling at the corners.  Steve ran a hand over Tony’s hair, smoothing it back where sweat had left it in curly clumps against Tony’s forehead.
Not that he wanted to die. He didn’t.  At all. But, if he was going to die, he’d rather it be on his own terms than slowly being eaten alive from the inside by the thing he built to save him.  Once, he remembered, he had been afraid that he would die in a suit he built escaping a cave. Now, he was sure of it, but he wasn’t afraid. Not anymore. Next great adventure, right? Why not.
Bittersweet, Steve thought, with a choked-off sound as his hand flew to his mouth. That’s what this is.  Bittersweet. Because another time, and I could’ve teased him about this, made him smile and joke and deflect.  Bittersweet.  Because another time, and it could still have been true for Tony, and Tony could have said, of course, of course, Steve was enough, it was the world that was terrible, and Steve could have believed him.

“Turn around,” Bucky ordered, brushing imaginary dust off the shoulders and sides, then running a hand through Steve’s hair, trying to get it to flatten. “Well.  I guess you’ll do,” Bucky said with a long-suffering sigh, then grinned widely.  “Gods, Steve.  Our lives,” he said, shaking his head for emphasis.  “He’s waiting,” Bucky finished, voice going low as the smile slipped off his face into something far more serious.
"Suit yourself," Steve said with a shrug and went back toward the kitchen. "It's OK, Buck. Tony's not hungry. He said you can finish it."
"Yeah, it's my turn," Bucky said, but Sam shot him a look and said, "Uh, has the timer gone off yet?"
plan," Rhodey said, and Steve, despite his misgivings over the situation, chuckled a little. "No, I'm serious. That is— Now you got me wondering if I'm really sure about this."
Steve finished fastening the other cuff. "Not tonight, at least." He nodded at Tony's feet and added, "I see you've decided to go a bit more, uh,
That was a question he really didn't think he could handle being answered if only because he was afraid of what the answer might be. It's not that he believed that Steve didn't love him or wasn't attracted to him as a man. Clearly, he wouldn't have been with him if he hadn't been, and Steve didn't seem like the type to waste his time in a relationship he wasn't fully committed to. But Steve was an old- fashioned guy from the '40s. He clearly had been attracted to women in the past, and just because he was bi didn't mean there wasn't a part of him that maybe wanted to go with a woman because that '40s brain of his might find it
Tony didn’t expect it to be dark when he walked out of the elevator, but checking the time, it was already three at night. With any luck, Steve and Bucky would be dead asleep in their bedroom, but being the soldiers of countless wars and fighting evil almost every week, one can’t expect them to have a regular sleep schedule. So, of course, Bucky was propped up on the couch with mounds of blankets and pillows surrounding himself, The Office playing on the big screen TV. Noticing the resident genius coming towards him from the telltale pitter-patter of small feet on the carpet, Bucky turned around, opening his arms as an invitation.
“Sorry folks, can I steal our boy genius for one second, very urgent Avengers business, need to go now.” Steve rudely pushed through the circle of men surrounding Tony and steered him away, smiling back to all the faces painted in disbelief at the rude getaway.
Steve, of course, had to come back from his run at that exact moment, swinging the front door open noisily, toeing his runners off in front of the door and waltzing to the kitchen like there was no care in the world. Steve paused in the doorway, a dirty smirk already spread on his face. That bastard knew exactly what was going on.
And of course, what did he expect? Their comments were near all the same each time, describing how Howard would have done this better and oh how they missed him because he was such a good person. Tony tried to not give a rat’s ass about what senile, old, middle-aged white men thought about his inventions but when they compared him next to his father, that’s when the dam broke. In the end, even though Tony tried his hardest to keep an even face and smile when it was appropriate, he’d had enough. Silent tears were pooling in his eyes, trying not to spill over. The men seemingly paid no attention to him as they laughed and chattered on about Howard, but it was the two people he treasured the most that noticed his growing unease.
“I was just thinking about last night”, Bucky said in that husky, dominant voice, and Tony’s throat decided that it would be fun to close on itself, making him choke midway on his second sip of coffee.
Tony’s mouth dried up, gawking at Bucky like he didn’t think about this already. Didn’t almost look forward to the delicious punishments they always doled on him.
Everything will be fine, Tony though as he snuggled deeper into the covers, heated by his two supersoldier boyfriends.
Tony had already drifted off, comforted by his very own supersoldier/furnace and the background noises from the TV.
Pulling a t-shirt over his head (skin- tight, of course), Steve stepped softly into the carpeted living room, not expecting to find his two favorite people huddled on the gigantic couch, the Netflix screen saver illuminating the room and the thick curtain covering the windows to block out the sunlight that should otherwise be streaming in.
“Bucky’s waiting by the limo with Happy,” Steve said lowly in Tony’s ear as he leaned down, leading him to the exit and carefully dodging all the conversations that were thrown his way. True to his word, Buck was already seated inside the limo when they arrived and gently pulled tony inside and sat him on his lap as the tears that were threatening to spill over finally overflowed, shushing and rocking him through the back aching sobs that ripping their way through the man.
They were found piled on top of each other in the morning when Steve woke up to an empty bed and cold sheets, ready for his morning run with Sam. Assuming that Bucky went to the gym early and Tony was still holed up in his lab from the freak out last, Steve considered canceling with Sam and attempting to break the door to Tony’s lab, again.
His mouth trailed lower, down Steve’s throat beyond the collar, nipping and sucking at the skin where it stretched down to Steve’s shoulder.  There would be a mark there, too, Steve thought dazedly, as his back arched to reach more of the wet heat of Tony’s mouth.  Tony’s head dipped lower, to the hollow of Steve’s throat, then lower still, down the breastbone to the fold of skin where Steve’s muscles were stretched across his chest by the position of the chains.  Another puff of warm breath over his wet skin as Tony chuckled, and Steve realized his hips were canting up and down, trying to find some kind of friction that Tony refused to provide.
“Uh-huh. I remember hearing you tell me something similar when you were down in the isolation room with Captain Rogers trying to kill one of our former operatives with an overdose of Viagra after you threw me across the room,” Fury pointed out. “You and I have different definitions of ‘fine.’”
“Not…ever, no,” Tony replied, making Estes’ smile falter, though the guy recovered quickly enough.  Someone like that usually did.  “So, you’re into prosthetics.”
“I—I made you a mixtape.  This is going to end with me outside your window with a boombox, isn’t it?” Tony groaned with an exaggerated eye roll that settled into a soft smile.
Celestial navigation, Tony thought, heart pounding.  Find the right one, and you will find your way home.
“Tony…it’s in a basement,” Steve observed in frustration. He watched Tony look around his workshop, as if seeing it for the first time, and maybe it actually was the first time Tony had looked at it through any lens but that of a loving creator, inhabiting the space he was meant for.
!  The head of Tony’s cock hit something deep inside him and Steve flew apart. That was the only way he could think of it.  Pleasure sizzled from the inside out, burning through his skin until his whole body was thrumming with it.
“Gods, Steve,” Tony rasped out. “You’re beautiful. You’re the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen. I love you so much, love you, love you, Steve,” Tony babbled, the words of praise making whatever was wrapping itself around his chest constrict, then empty, slithering lower, and for the first time since he’d begun this, he was conscious of his own need, hot and hard, a line of wetness seeping down his thigh under his breeches. “I’m close. I’m so close, Steve, you have to—move—move, Steve,” Tony panted, pushing at Steve’s head, but Steve, reached up and wrapped his fingers around Tony’s wrist, holding it to the back of his head again with enough pressure for Tony to understand it as permission.
He didn’t sleep. Eventually, the quiet from the workshop gave way to sounds Steve associated with the King’s work, and he felt himself relax with the familiar notes.  He finally pulled back the bedcovers and climbed under them as the fire dimmed in the hearth. Turning on his side, he let his eyes drop closed and sank into the warm softness of the bed, trying not to think, though his mind kept wanting to replay the evening as if it was a bard with a new favorite tale, each thought seemingly punctuated by some plink or clank from the workshop as Tony did whatever it was he felt needed doing at this time of night.  Steve tried to think of ships and raiders, trade guilds and taxes and the problems of kings.  It didn’t quite work, as his mind kept slipping back to other things, but it did prove at least partially successful, as distractions went.
“Uh, clause two-hundred and fifteen, I think,” Tony corrected, splaying his free hand over his forehead and rubbing at his temples with his thumb and forefinger.  “You really should read the fine print.  It’s there for a reason.”
“I want to learn to drive,” Tony blurted out.  He shoved the last spoonful of yogurt into his mouth and pretended to look down at the empty cup of yogurt with intense interest.
“I've...heard something about that,” Steve replied, because he had heard of Edwin Jarvis, though not the way Tony likely suspected.  The man’s name came up several times in the files on Peggy Carter, then Peggy Carter Sousa, who was now patient P. Carter at the Arlington Memory Care facility, who sometimes asked for Steve like he had never been away.  He could feel his hands curling into fists, the knuckles whitening around the rod, and forced himself to breathe out through his nose and relax his body.  Count backwards, his therapist had once suggested, and Steve had laughed out loud at that until he thought he might have been crying, and she suggested a tranquilizer instead and then suggested Tony.
He wanted to tell Tony to stop.  This couldn’t be allowed.  But, then, Tony was sucking, swirling his tongue around and tracing the slit on the head of Steve’s cock, and Steve thought he would’ve killed anyone who suggested Tony stop.  Air kept bursting out of his throat in great heaving gulps, earning him a sloe-eyed look from Tony, who moved his hand down and followed with his mouth, taking more of Steve into his throat.
He was oddly unsettled by the whole conversation, though, looking back, he didn’t think he’d flubbed it too much.  If he was this bad with a stranger, he was really going to have to work at it to sell anything remotely like a lie to Bucky, though, which was something he’d been putting off dealing with and couldn’t really let it hang out there any longer or Buck was liable to do something stupid like demand that Steve have an actual conversation with him.
He smiled and picked up the papers, turning towards the fireplace. Holding them up to the light, he rearranged the papers one by one, then flattened them out together with the back of the stack towards the fire. An image came together from the bits and pieces on each of the papers, long and deadly and made to smash walls and rain fire down from above. He didn’t have a word for what it was. He wasn’t sure it existed in this world, though it did now, he supposed. Though he could not name the thing, he could see clearly enough what such a thing could do.
