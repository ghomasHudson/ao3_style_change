“Whatever Tony says, I believe him, I knew Ty too, he's a jerk!” Jan's voice cuts through the room. She's perched in her chair, color high in her cheeks with sympathetic anger. Tony laughs, shoulders slumping. He takes a long sip from the glass before speaking again.
“Is this the part where I say I know?” Steve asks, the corners of his lips twitching with a smile. Tony laughs, curling his hand over Steve's neck, fingers playing over the short hair at the nape of his neck in a light touch that makes him shiver.
“Does that feel good, is this-I can stop-I'm not hurting you am I?” Steve really needs to work on understanding when Tony's on the verge of taking his clothes off.  Tony wonders if it would be bad form to rip his shirt off and hang a
“Off to bed now?” Steve asks, reaching out to cup his cheek-slipping his hand up to stroke a thumb just under his eyes. “Been resting? You look tired there mister big brain, gotta remember to give that noggin some time off.” Steve murmurs, the corners of his eyes crinkling fondly. Tony realizes suddenly that he's been holding his breath. He lets it out with a gusty sigh, hanging his head in defeat. He
“I’m fine Tony, just didn’t sleep well last night.”  Or the nights before that, but he wasn’t about to burden Tony with that knowledge, there wasn’t really anything he could do about that as it was.  Tony was still frowning though, he raised a gauntleted hand to stroke his thumb over the hollows beneath Steve’s eyes.  Steve tried not to shiver.  It felt so good, Tony touching him so gently, even if it was the armor, it was so warm.
Carefully he reaches out, intent on what-he doesn't know. All he can think of is picking Stark up and getting him into a bed instead of wheezing quietly on the floor. Before that idea can become action, a soft voice pipes up from one of the tablets.
“Right,” Tony shoves away from the counter, grabbing a bag of freshly shelled peas from within his refrigerator.  “I'll just add some more then, just for you, one stew coming up, extra peas.” He peers into the bag, seemingly eyeballing the measurement, before wandering back over.
When they get up to leave Tony tosses a wad of bills into their dead eyed hostess' tip jar. She stares at it, then back at him as if his face has suddenly registered. He jerks a thumb at Steve, then himself and mimes a zipping motion. Bless her, she just nods, reaching out to take the money and stow it in her apron. Steve watches the whole exchange with a clearly amused expression, dropping a kiss on Tony's cheek once he comes into range.
“So perfect, so good, Tony, you're so good.” Steve realizes he might be babbling, but Tony seems to like it, clenching around his cock, mouth open and wet against the desk, fingers scrabbling at the tabletop when Steve starts moving his hand over his cock again. He's making a mess of the furniture; precome leaking from the tip messily, hard and velvety hot in Steve's hand.
“What? You're going to tell me our resident battle ballerina can't do the twirly whirly on the ice?” Tony manages to look appalled and horrified by this prospect without even cracking a smile, but Steve knows when he's being smarted off to.
The envelope is light, just barely registering on the armors sensors with its weight. Tony gets is open easily, only just managing not to flinch when a slip of paper falls into his repulsored palm.
“Up then, let’s get you to bed, I don’t have the armor, so I sadly can’t carry you.”  He wiggled his fingers at Steve encouragingly, pulling Steve up to stand with impressive strength when Steve accepted the hand up.
it even, but he's self aware enough to realize how many times he's traded the act for the intimacy that follows. That cavernous emptiness in him that craves love and affection; he's been tossing it scraps for years. Steve is here now though, spelling out something that feels a lot like love with every action, kissing him and cherishing him despite everything in Tony that says he can never deserve this. When they part for air again, Steve shifts them around so Tony's laying half sprawled atop him.  “Let me take care of you sweetheart. Wanna take you on dates, show you off, make 'em all jealous.”
“I am not!”  Tony squawked, his eyes going wide, as if Steve were blaspheming Jesus, Mary, and Joseph, and maybe all the choirs of angels too.  Steve pointed at his face, wagging his finger.
“Hi yourself, come sit with us.” It's said with such warmth, such affection that Tony feels the absolutely horrifying desire to
“Can we shower first, I uh-” The flush working over his face is hot and obvious but they're both in the same straits, so it could be far more embarrassing. Tony nods vigorously in understanding, hissing quietly when Steve lets go of his legs and helps him off the table.
After the mission is done and they are safe again, It flashes there, between his clavicles later when he shaves and neatens his hair. In the mirror his eyes seem dull, determined, he is marching towards something; what, he does not know. His evening is interrupted by one of the invaders popping his head in. There is a young boy behind him, looking contrite and resigned all at once.
“No, I don't really have anywhere to go. Still that seems kind of presumptuous.” Steve's ma' didn't tolerate the mooching type, and this seems awfully like something he would have gotten his ears boxed for entertaining.  As if reading his mind, Barton twists around in his seat, staring at Steve with a look that says he's off his rocker.
“Oh, oh, God,” The words punched out of him almost painfully. He was so hard, his cock slapping wetly against his abdomen when he let it go to pull at his own hair with just the thought of that, of Tony letting him fuck him. He could, he could get Tony on his stomach, pull his hips up, hold him like that, and-Tony was an omega, Steve wouldn’t have to keep a hand on himself, not if Tony urged him on, if he wanted it, and in his fantasy Tony sure did. Steve’s moan was shockingly loud in the room as he got his hand back around his cock. Both hands now, holding himself almost too tightly, the way Tony’s body might at first, but Tony would be able to-to, if tony wanted it, he could take a knot. Steve’s whole body arched with that thought, and he had to roll over, bury his face in the blankets, and grind into the mattress.
art... right?” For a man as brilliant and multi-talented as he is, Tony's terrible at accepting a genuine compliment.
“Yeah I bet, but he shouldn't sleep here, he's gonna wake up with one heck of a crick in his neck. Why's he sleeping on the floor and not the couch anyway?” Steve says nothing of the labored breathing, he hadn't liked it when people had pointed it out to him back before the serum-he doubts Mister Stark would appreciate the reminder, even if he's talking to JARVIS right now and not the man himself. He gets the feeling the AI talks to his creator a lot.
Tony takes a snowball narrowly missing their vantage point as a sign, going off to put on warmer clothes. Steve follows him inside soon after when JARVIS informs him that Tony is on the first floor waiting for him.
His vision spots, and he shakes his head to clear his thoughts, taking another long sip of hot cocoa. Bucky made it for him; something like understanding glittering in his eyes when he dropped it off on the nightstand in Tony's bedroom. Tony wants to take his arm apart for some reason, but that's probably
“He eats, he definitely eats. Sometimes I even eat with him.” He says, gesturing to the slowly melting shake. Tony squints at it, swiping it off the counter and shoving the straw back through the mouthslit as JARVIS thoughtfully opens it. He slurps at it pointedly, jiggling it in Steve's direction for emphasis.
They stay like that, wrapped together on the gently swaying floor of the limo until Happy pulls into the mansion's garage. Only then does Tony disentangle himself, giving a brief thought to the drink he spilled all over the place, but there's not much to be done for it now. Happy always sends cars off to be detailed after
“Is he-that was a lot of bruising.”
“Mister Stark is covered to the neck, he has stopped flashing his ankles at you Captain Rogers.” JARVIS sounds amused at his expense. Steve smiles despite himself. True to his word though he goes to get the tablets, once more stacking them on the table beside Tony's bed. He bends to retrieve the jar of minty ointment, startling when hazy brown eyes meet his on the way back up.

“Oh that blush, you are so so gorgeous, so pretty, so big and beautiful and perfect.  You fit against me just right, don't you, hot stuff?” Tony's voice is so silky smooth, the rumble of it reverberating against Steve's back where they're pressed so close.  Steve opens his mouth to argue-maybe, he doesn't really know, but Tony shushes him, pressing a little closer, his hand rubbing in wider circles over his stomach. “Shh, darling, it's all true, it's how I feel-”
“I um. Definitely, but first I wanted you to have these.” Tony blinks slowly as Steve produces the bouquet of flowers from behind his back. They stare at each other for a long moment, before Tony's eyes drag back down to the flowers.
“Perhaps you should not have insulted fair Anthony, this is the price one pays.” Thor says sagely, watching Steve in a way Tony can only qualify as impressed. Tony agrees, it's very impressive.
“Rhapsody in Blue, George Gershwin, this came out when I was a kid.” He says, clearing his throat to announce his presence before he speaks.  Tony's hands still on the keys where they had been flying. He turns on the piano bench, expression guilty, and that just won't do.
“Steve. Steven Grant Rogers, if you-if you get that fuc-darn song stuck in my head I'm divorcing you. I don't care how much you love Frozen.” Tony's grumbles.  Steve raises his eyebrows in response.
“Does he wear gloves?”  She asked, bending to retrieve another tray, this one full of all sorts of steady gloves, thin lace studded with stones.  “That might be too much of a statement, but they are very pretty.”
.” Tony says, pink faced and staring back at him. Steve shrugs, scooting up the bed to pull his shirt off, then methodically stripping out of his sweatpants. Tony just stares, mouth dropping a little bit as Steve reaches over to rifle through the side-table closest to him for lube.
. The walls are painted in soothing colors, white plastic tables are dotted around the place, and dead eyed teenager is standing behind a long counter full of what looks to be enough sweet toppings to make Willy Wonka cream his candy pants. It feels momentous.
two of Steve's fingers into that wet warmth. Steve groans despite himself, pushing his fingers deeper and watching Tony's jaw work to accommodate them. It's worth it to hear a harsh moan tear from his throat, and to feel Tony's body arch against his before going utterly lax.  So lax in fact that Steve loses his hold, but that seems to have been Tony's goal. Glittering brown eyes flick up to his and then Tony is on his knees on the floor, pressing his cheek against the front of Steve's tactical pants. It's a sight that will stay with him for years, and it's enough to make him moan helplessly.
Tony was staring at him, he very carefully set the plasma torch down, stripped off his welding gear, and walked over to the ultra modern seating area on the side of the lab with no projects strewn about. “Come sit with me,” he said, “and you can tell me why you thought that.”
“Oh yeah? Maybe I'm an exhibitionist, don't kinkshame me Clinton.” Tony snipes.  Steve isn't sure he wants to know what the meaning of 'kinkshaming' is. It sounds decidedly like something he would look up in the middle of the night in a fit of excessive curiosity-and then regret his eidetic memory for the rest of time.
“This tent looks kind of...small.” Tony says, standing in front of the zipped entrance and eyeing it critically. “Sure you don't want a cabin? There's still time.” Tony sighs at Steve's decisive head-shake, unzipping the tent and clambering inside. Steve sees the moment he realizes there's only one sleeping bag through the mesh covering the top of the tent.
“That is one nasty ex!”  Hawkey said, from his perch on a pretzel cart.
“Up to you, not susceptible to any of the regular stuff, you know that.”  Steve says warmly, running his hand down Tony's back just to feel the softness of his skin over hard muscle.  Tony seems to think that over, then he's reaching back, covering Steve's cock with that palmful of slick. Steve groans, nearly knocking his head back against the headboard when Tony gives him a few tight strokes, and rubs over the sensitive spot just under the head.
“Okay, well, I’m going to keep working for a little while, I’ll be here if you need me.”  Tony said, and then there was the sound of him shuffling back over to the couch.
Steve thinks unsteadily. The waistcoat is snug against the small of Tony's back, emphasizing the curve of a backside Steve may or may not have had a few furtive sweaty fantasies about biting.
somewhere outside a lab setting?” Tony's eyebrows are waggling, his hands slipping up Steve's chest to rub at the firm muscle there. Steve fixes him with a supremely unimpressed stare.
Jonquil symbolizes desire, as well as having the feeling of desire and love requited.
He didn’t sleep well that night again, but the dreams were not as terrifying as they had been.  He woke, hard enough to pound nails and wrapped up in his blankets hopelessly.  It took a good few minutes to work himself out, and thirty minutes with his hand in the shower to calm himself down enough to be presentable for breakfast.
“You bet, wouldn’t miss it.”  He said, sucking some peanut butter off his thumb, and then washing his hands.
“You do have a flat ass big bird, don't be bitter about it.”
“I think this may be a new kink.” He murmurs dazedly when Steve hefts him up a little higher and leans in to brush his lips over Tony's almost questioningly-as if he's hesitant to take what Tony so clearly wants to give-even if he has Tony pinned against the wall easier than breathing. He knows without a doubt Steve would let him down, would stop instantly if Tony wanted that.  The knowledge of that, how good Steve is, how much integrity, how honorable Steve is-that just makes all of this hotter. Steve seems almost nervous now, moistening his lips and staring into Tony's eyes with an unspoken question there.  he rubs his palms over Tony's thighs, shifts around, his eyes fluttering shut when Tony, presses against him in encouragement.  Another brush of those lips, and Tony lets his mouth open against Steve's, invites him in with little flicks of his tongue against Steve's, and suddenly all that hesitance is gone. Tony flips off the cameras he knows are there behind Steve's back.
SPOILERS FOR SEASONS 3&4 BEWARE
” Tony whips his phone out of his pocket, gesturing to it, blowing holograms up all over the room where they scroll with countless lines of glowing code.
“Oh so you brought your big blond boytoy with you. Well at least he's good for something.” Hammer says, as if Steve's presence leaves a bad taste in his mouth, and Tony wants to punch him right in the face, but he maintains his calm by remembering years of his mother teaching him how to smile in the face of people he despises. It's one thing for Hammer to insult him, it's another thing entirely for him to talk shit about
“Of course you can have me, you always have. Just had to ask, just had to say so beloved.” Tony breathes into the air between them when they part for a moment to catch their breath.  Tony says it so easily, and it’s true he told Steve he would call him beloved, but hearing him say it is something else. He says it so warmly, affectionately, sweet, like a mouthful of cotton candy.  There’s a look in his blue, blue eyes too, something Steve has seen for awhile now but didn’t have a name for. It hits him like a gut punch that Tony loves him in return.
“Fuck, yes, yes that's good.” Tony groans, dropping his hands down to brace on Steve's shoulders; digging his knees into the mattress to give Steve better leverage to fuck him open with his fingers. Steve always figured Tony would be a noisy lover. He's spent probably unhealthily long amounts of time with his own right hand trying to imagine what Tony would sound like, what he would look like writhing above Steve just like this. Even Steve's exceedingly vivid imagination could not do Tony justice. He
“Side room.” Steve says suddenly, fingers squeezing his wrist carefully to pull him into an empty room. There's a table, a few chairs scattered around, but overall it's pretty clear no one has been using it for quite some time.
Beware the Fluff!  As always your comments are my life-blood.  Many thanks to everyone on the Discord who patiently let me bemoan the fate of intending to write a oneshot and ending up with this instead.  You're all amazing.
“Mister Nanners, reporting for duty. He'll keep you safe when Shellhead's off being a hero.” Up close and without the faceplate on, the stuffed banana is somehow even more ridiculous. It's also a lot softer than Tony would have thought, and pleasantly squishy when Tony hugs it close and laughs helplessly at the smitten look on Steve's face. Tony pets over the fuzzy velveteen material, contemplating how much sillier it would look if he made it a special Captain America cowl and shield.
“I want to do this right, if you'll let me.” Earnestness has always been something Steve has in spades, he puts it to work now, hoping he can make Tony see how much he means everything he's said.  Tony clutches the flowers to his chest, staring off at some fixed point to the left of him.
Steve notes, taking the bouquet in his hands and looking it over. Red carnations
“Razzle dazzle Mister Stark.” Pepper answers, to the whoosh of JARVIS opening the glass doors. Yeah, Tony can do this.
Tony blinks, then blinks again, clapping a hand over his own mouth to quash the hysterical little giggle that wants to escape.  “Oh my god JARVIS, have you been running compatibility
. But no. He's not going to think about that right now. What he has with Tony is good, great, better than anything he really thought to hope for, especially after everything.
“Steve I don't know what you think, but being with you, loving you” He chokes on the tail end of the sentence. “that's the easiest thing I've ever done.”
at him. “I trust you, you're my best friend, and pretty handsome to boot.” Steve finally says after a long protracted silence. Tony feels his jaw drop and hurriedly snaps it shut.
“That was gorgeous, darling.” Tony says warmly, slowly slipping the toy from Steve's body and tossing it somewhere. Steve has no idea where, his eyes are closed, and it doesn't seem important anyway.
The next time Steve sees Mister Stark he has an entourage with him. Steve is in the kitchen scaring up a whole mess of breakfast when a tall elegant red haired woman comes in talking away on a cellphone and looking more imposing than a drill sergeant. Virginia 'Pepper' Potts, Acting CEO of Stark Industries-Steve read the dossier, he knows her immediately.
“Oh fuck, is it eating them, shit, get this off me, I can't-” Iron Man is struggling wildly, but he's held fast, Steve's ears ring with the sound of explosions, the shriek of claws on metal as the thing braces one of it's clawed appendages over the reactor at the center of the armor's chest.
. This just keeps happening with Steve. He's never felt so needy with a lover before, if that's even what they are. Tony doesn't know what kind of label to give their relationship, but he does know that he wants Steve all over him, and not even in a purely sexual way. Steve apparently trips every single touch starved thought Tony has ever had in his life. He might be more upset about it Steve didn't treat cuddling Tony like his own personal mission in life.
“You're doing so well, God...look at you, taking it so good, fuck, Tony.” He groans out, grabbing Tony's arms and pinning them above his head, crossing his wrists to hold them there with one hand, and stroking over Tony's face, then down over his throat, his chest, until he wraps his hand around Tony's cock to touch him in time with the deep rolling thrusts into his body. Tony doesn't fight his hold at all, instead, he shifts his hips around, grinding back against Steve, and giving a harsh wordless cry when Steve nails him just right.
He thinks with growing agitation as Steve leaves the lab. Tony does not stare at his ass because he's
“They're mine, give them back.” He hisses, uncaring of the alarm bells this person's presence is setting off.
. How does someone like him deserve all of that? Genius apparently means nothing when faced with that sort of rhetorical question. That doesn't change the fact that until Steve wise's up, Tony is going to cling to the love thrown his way like the affection starved creature he is. He stows those thoughts however, pushes them aside upon noticing Happy watching him with something that looks like concern.
_________________________________________________________________
“Right, Okay, time to go!” He says, pulling an about face to keep from crawling right back onto Steve's lap.
At least he didn’t have much to pack up, he mused, slinging the standard issue duffel with his life in it over his shoulder while climbing the ramp up to the plane set to bring him towards his destiny.  The plane ride was somber, Steve caught Dr. Erskine’s gaze multiple times when he looked up from sketching.  Steve added a little doodle of the scientist while he was at it, and Dr. Erskine laughed when he caught sight of it in the sketchpad.
“Very good sir.” JARVIS says without missing a beat. The phone rings twice before Rhodey's face comes into view. He's laying in a hotel bed, face smashed into the pillow, but he jerks into a sitting position when he sees the look on Tony's face.
As if reading his mind, Steve joins him in the garage where he's been waiting-looking so sharp in his tux that Tony feels like he might put an eye out if he stares too long. Steve seems to be having the same problem. He smiles so brightly that Tony thinks the sun must still be out after all instead of setting as the laws of nature dictate.
Steve pulls back, leaning up to put space between them, his blue eyes are blown, just tiny rings of color around the pupil. It's just a physiological reaction, Tony reasons, kissing feels good, no matter who it is if they know what they're doing. There's no way Steve is getting as much out of this as Tony is. Steve is smiling down at him warmly though, as if he's been wanting this. He touches Tony's lips, and Tony fights the urge to get those fingers in his mouth. That's not what this is about, this is just kissing. They're just seeing if Steve can tolerate that. Simulated blowjobs are
“We'll find a way to fix Arsenal, you've helped me with Bucky-” Tony shakes his head, pulling away slightly, but Steve holds him fast, slips his hand away from the tags to tip Tony's head up so their eyes meet. “Let me help, don't hide these things away from me.”
“I almost feel bad about eating these.” Tony says, when they're all comfortably sprawled around one of the sitting rooms with giant mugs of hot cocoa and heaping plates of decorated cookies. Steve inclines his head in Hulk's direction.
“It’s me, I am a public, and I will have you know, I am feeling extremely corrupt, someone delete my cache and reboot me.” The last part of that statement hadn’t made a lick of sense, but the first part made Steve flush hot. Tony was always saying stuff like that, he only wished he meant it. He didn’t know what Tony was going on about anyway, it was just shorts and a shirt.
“I like to watch him dance, he's pretty light on his feet for such a big strapping guy.” This voice is full of mirth, he can hear the smile there even without seeing her.
“C'mere then sweetheart.” Steve murmurs, gliding his hand over Tony's jaw then down to curl around the loosened knot of his tie. Light and shadow slants across their faces as he's tugged down.
don't know."
where darkness begins.
Up ahead, walls rose up out of the ground, encircling a courtyard, and he picked up voices over the wall, one of which he recognized instantly. It was Zemo’s voice, calling out orders imperiously, Steve wouldn’t be surprised if he’d sat himself atop some kind of palanquin. It seemed like something he would do.
Outside the windows the city is lit with blinking lights, and white puffs of snow drift down. If Steve really listens, there are carolers somewhere down at street level. Steve falls asleep holding Tony close, surrounded by the people he cares most for in the world. It might not be peace on earth, but it's one of the best days he's ever had.
Tony reels him in for one more kiss. Steve surprises him by deepening it, sucking lightly at is tongue and biting gently at his bottom lip. Tony is panting when he pulls back, hyperaware that Steve's hand has crept beneath the covers, and his shirt to spread over his belly, holding him effectively to the bed. He blinks up at Steve, mouth open and swollen from their kisses. Blue eyes fix on his lips, the pupils blown wide and dark. Oh god. Steve leans in again, trailing kisses over his neck, nosing the collar of his shirt to track the chain holding his tag. He presses a kiss there over the metal, right over the hollow of his throat.
“Sure thing Shellhead, but I like you all the time.” Steve knows Tony won't take him seriously, but that won't stop him from trying.  Sure enough, Tony looks away, a soft self deprecating laugh falling from his lips as he gets to his feet.
“Big mistake, Mole Man.”  Iron Man said, holding out his repulsored palms.  Steve threw the shield at a few straggling Moloids trying to sneak up on the armor.  Mole man sneered, pulling up some kind of long gun-like apparatus and pointing it at Steve, where he stood on the field.  “Bigger mistake.”  Iron man dropped his palms, his chest lit up blue.
His mouth worked, no sound came out for a moment, and then he cleared his throat and spoke. “Steve honey, say something? I’m sorry, I should have asked first, I get carried away, too much, I always do too much. I should have run it by you first, God that’s so insensitive, I’m, I-I made Captain America cry, sick and wrong and-”
“Two reindeer per penguin Captain Handsome. Don't be cheap.” He says, holding up his hand and making a beckoning gesture.  Steve huffs out a laugh, passing over two reindeer cookies and getting one penguin in return. Tony settles against him after that, methodically working his way through more cookies than he's ever seen their usually health conscious co-leader eat. Steve smiles at Tony when he's caught looking, leaning in to rub his nose over Tony's hair.
It's a quiet sort of intimacy, something he never thought he could have after the serum and his long time away from the world. He only wishes Tony understood.
“Shut up Hammer, I'm not here for your entertainment. This was found in a cave in the Smokies. Know anything about that?” He's proud of the cutting quality of the words, the steadiness of his own hands when he produces the tie clip. The clear diamond inset into the platinum reflects light around the room in tiny rainbows. Hammer doesn't seem happy to see it at all.
Tony winces, but Steve just reaches over to lace their hands together.  "I'm sorry, did it wake you up?” The apology is almost reflexive by this point, but Steve watches him for a moment, blue eyes warm and assessing.
” Tony indicates Steve's whole Steve-ness with a helpless hand flapping motion, and Steve gets that bashful pleased look he gets on his face when Tony gets speechless around him.
Steve slumped back onto the bed, raking his hands over his face.  Well, he’d royally messed that up.  Tony probably thought he was losing his marbles.
Iron Man dropped him into the largest group of Moloids, and the rush was on him in force.  Steve immediately went to work.  It was like smacking around a bunch of sentient bowling pins.  Everywhere he swung his shield, they went flying.  He bet Thor would have had a grand time of this.  He would probably be sore he missed out.  He wasn’t even winded, solely focused on containing the Moloid horde, protecting the crowd-which had decided this was an incredible show, and was cheering raucously from the stands- and keeping Iron Man’s path clear.
unconscious after all.
There's nothing pressing to do, no mission, no terrible empty night stretching out before him-and he knows he shouldn't complain, he's got it better than a lot of folks out there.  This though-this is better than anything he could have dreamed up even at his most maudlin, his most wanting and stupidly sentimental. Just the two of them here, in this warm space Tony has carved out for them, holding his fella and being held in return.  He hardly feels like he deserves it, but Tony has made it clear he wants Steve here, with actions, and words, and gestures of affection almost unreal for how much Steve wants them. They are real though, as real as the man dozing atop him. Steve kisses the top of Tony's head once more, breathes him in, and pulls him in a little closer, resolving to stop thinking so hard.  After that it's easy to relax. He syncs his breaths with Tony's, focuses on the warmth of his body, and lets himself drift off to sleep.
“Not yet, just a little longer.” Steve says, voice a gravelly purr. Tony can't even bring himself to say anything to that, so he just lays there, flushed and panting as Steve tosses the dental dam away and then trails a path of kisses up his spine.
“That's because your old uniform was just star spangled
“Hey JARVIS, need something?” He asks, scanning around the room for threats on reflex and coming up empty.
and Steve has never seen anything so goddamn gorgeous.
me, whatever you want, just touch me.” Tony sounds desperate already, and god that's not a tone of voice he ever thought to have directed at himself.  Steve just barely bites back a groan, sinking down enough to brush his lips over Tony's-teasingly at first, but then in earnest when Tony moans into his mouth and presses up against him. Steve has been fixated on their mistletoe kiss since it happened, but this kiss is something else. Tony puts his whole body into it, legs wrapping around Steve's waist, fingers pulling at his hair. They part for much needed air only briefly, before Tony is dragging him back down, licking into Steve's mouth with a such focused intensity that Steve can't help but grind down against the body trapped beneath his.
The lab is just as he left it, and suddenly Tony wants to be anything but alone. The armor sheds off of him in a wave, disappearing back beneath the floor. Tony takes a moment to brush his hair into a semblance of order, and to make the attempt at smoothing his rumpled clothing. The tag is warm against his chest, and Tony reaches up to clutch at it beneath his shirt.
Dinner was a surprisingly casual affair.  Tony took him to a pub style restaurant with big plush booths, and about a hundred or so beers on tap.  He ate a big messy hamburger and stole fries from Steve’s plate, but declined to order his own, claiming stolen food always tasted better.
empty. There's almost always at least one Avenger stuffing their face at any given part of the day or night.
“I'm nothing special, I'm just a kid from Brooklyn. Some days when I feel like I could go back in the ice-I think about that kid from Brooklyn. I think about having met you then, what I would have thought if I'd have seen you then. Even with the danger I still would want you.” Steve turns his hand, taking Tony's in his and stroking his thumb over Tony's wrist. Tony is well known for never running out of things to say, but he finds he can't speak, afraid to break this moment between them.
“Want you to be my contact, in case that ever happens.” Steve murmurs into the quiet of the room. Tony knew it was coming, saw the trajectory of this conversation, and still gets blindsided. Steve's cheek is hot against his, and Tony leans back, eyes roving over Steve's face searchingly. Steve's jaw is set stubbornly, brows knit together in a fretful line of worry.
“How do I look?” Tony asks, trying for coy but mostly ending up giddy.
“You don’t even have a watch there!”  Clint called.  Tony rolled his eyes skyward.
“No one expects you to just bounce back, Steve, no one expects you not to grieve.”  Tony reached out hesitantly, rested his hand on Steve’s shoulder, the way he had in the armor, but his unarmored hand was even warmer through the thick sweatshirt material.  “You’ve lost so much, but I’d like to, to try to make this alien planet feel like home again.  Or we, me, us, the team, we can try.”  He flushed, looked down, went to take his hand away.  Steve reached up, curled his palm around Tony’s elbow and held him there.  Beneath his thumb, through Tony’s shirt, Steve felt his pulse jump into a tripping beat.
“Knew you were in town and I thought to myself, so am I. Just had to come out here and see what you've been getting up to. Building water treatment plants, Polio vaccines, medical tech, you sure have been busy. Hey Iron Man is here too, but you can skedaddle I need to talk to your boss now.” Hammer has really always had an incredibly overblown opinion of his own importance, but trying to shoo off a superhero is a new one.  Tony rolls his eyes so hard he wonders if they might fall out of his head. JARVIS elects to say nothing, staring at Hammer from over Tony's shoulder with what Tony can only describe as quiet menace. Hammer is undaunted though, because he is as ever a complete twit.
It was a decidedly bad idea. Swimming through the dark-that he recalls. His head on someone's knees while they yelled for him; blue eyes wide and terrified.
"Come again?" Steve manages to get out, when it comes to his attention that he's been watching Tony spin around in his lab chair in silence. Tony's gaze zeroes in on him, he looks a little gleeful, pressing his lips together and then grinning.  He snaps his fingers, pointing up at the ceiling. There's a brief dinging sound, and a scoreboard pops up. Numbers scroll all over it, but Steve can't make heads or tails of what it all means.
“How are you doing in there?”  Tony asked from behind the closed door a few minutes later.

He lays in bed after that, staring up at the ceiling and knowing that sleep is unlikely to come tonight. The splint is as comfortable as it can be, despite the persistent healing ache that tells him the serum is definitely still working.
Tony seems to sense his thoughtful mood, twining their hands together and keeping a comfortable silence between them until they reach their destination; a tall building Steve has never been to before. Tony hops out of the car, dragging him through a back entrance and into what looks like a cargo elevator. He taps a code in on the keypad, and the elevator dings twice before rising smoothly upwards.
and then to beg Tony to please leave the life risking to him. He knows that would go over like a lead balloon though. Tony burns so bright with the desire to help others that Steve worries he will flame out, or that he will throw himself into the jaws of death even if it means saving just one person. He supposes Bucky would call this karma, Steve hopes he's having a good laugh at Steve's expense, wherever he is.
“JARVIS helped me pick them out.” He says by way of explanation, smoothing his hands over the jacket and sitting back. Tony looks down at the flowers, then up at Steve, then back down at the flowers. Steve just keeps throwing him for a loop, he has no idea what to say to this, and what's worse, the tips of his ears are heating up. “You hands are a little cold.” Steve murmurs, taking both of his hands and rubbing them between his. “Is it too chilly in here?”
“Mmm.” Tony mumbles. “Already touching me, feels nice, don't stop handsome.”
“Don’t kill him Widow, disabling only please.”  Iron man called, to Widow’s grunt of the affirmative.
“Kay. Bed yes, sounds-” He yawns, jaw cracking with the force of it. Steve finds it oddly endearing.  “sounds nice mhmm.” Then he's asleep again, soft breaths that catch at the end pooling in the space between them.
“Can I take off your tie?” Steve asks against the collar of his shirt, and Tony reaches down to practically rips his tie off in his haste. The offending article of clothing gets tossed somewhere, he can fret about wrinkled silk later, Tony's not really thinking about that right now.
It's quiet for a little while between them. Steve has a lot on his mind. He's not too distracted however to hear JARVIS' quiet
“Nice piece, from an admirer?”  He wasn’t jealous, he
“Hey Thor, hope I didn't disturb you.” Steve whispers, mindful of the sleepy genius dreaming away in his arms. Thor just shakes his head.
“You clean up nice Mister Stark.” He says, stepping in close to take Tony's hand and pressing a kiss against his knuckles. Tony resists the urge to do something really undignified, but it's a close call. Happy can tell though, he's holding the door to the limo open and looking so smug it's a wonder he can even still stand under the weight of it.
The rest of the article went on to detail a messy breakup, a broken bond before it had even been initiated, and more intrusive questions that Tony batted away with the seeming ease of long experience. Links on the sidebar led to other articles about Tony, pictures of him young and at parties with people draped all over him. In those he looked considerably happier at least, especially the one with him up on a speaker singing into a microphone while wearing some tiny sparkly shorts. In another he looked even worse, still younger than in his Rolling Stone piece, with a beautiful woman named Sunset Bain all but coiled around him, her fingers digging into his neck to point Tony’s face towards the camera’s flash. The whole tableau set Steve’s teeth on edge, and he clicked away from it before he did something reckless like calling Tony up and asking him about it all. That article led to more recent ones, articles about his work with the Avengers, his scientific contributions, of which there were many, and finally one that made his heart seize in his chest. Tony had been kidnapped, and returned covered in a crude version of the Iron Man armor with a feverish sort of purpose. He saved himself and then turned his attention to saving others, to creating things to keep others safe. He lost his flesh and blood heart and had become the first recipient of a fully contained artificial heart. Oh. Steve thought, staring down at the tablet. The scar, that’s what it was from. He suddenly felt he was seeing something he wasn’t supposed to see. He was prying, being incredibly disrespectful and nosy. Tony hadn’t wanted him to know, he’d clammed up when Steve noticed the scar. But, Steve worried too, he hoped Tony was alright, that his heart was alright.
“Mmm yes, you can take me to bed anytime gorgeous.” Tony mumbles against his chest, and Steve goes hot all over. Resolutely he ignores further slurred invitations and carefully deposits Tony on his mattress.
“You didn't have to lie to her you know.” Tony says once they're on their way back to the tower.
“Happy holidays Steve.” Tony says on a yawn, waving his hand to silence the movie still playing above them.
“I,”  He licked his lips again, breathed in and blew it out, “Thank you Steve, they’re gorgeous, I’m sure I’ll have the nicest ones in the room.”  He stepped back, smoothed his waistcoat, and straightened his tie, then reached out to give Steve’s arm an affectionate squeeze.  “I’ll see you tonight, promise I’ll be home before three.”  Tony said, turning on his heel to exit the room.  Steve tried and failed to avoid watching him walk away.
“Thanks Ma’.” He said, pressing a hand to her portrait before turning away to leave the room.
love butter pecan, but that's not what this conversation is about.
"I, oh man, Cap,"  Iron Man says haltingly.
“No Steve, calm down, it was strictly rhetorical, please don't kill anyone.”
“You love me.”
“I have his phone number, and a slew of other contact information.”  Tony says, giving a short sharp nod.  Screens pop up with phone numbers and a few email addresses.  Steve files them away after reading each once.  It's always good to know how to potentially contact an enemy, even if Stone refuses to answer, it makes Steve feel better even if it doesn't tell them where the guy is.
Back before the war, Steve would have given anything to hear someone say that.  It was a point of pride, for a courting gift to be worn where visible, a sign the giftee not only liked the gift, but was receptive to further courting.  Whether he knew it or not, Tony would be wearing his gift all through his day.  Through board meetings and important calls, and inventing, and God knew what else.  Steve stood closer to the counter, God he was hard.  This was not good.
“Yeah, yeah I know. There's a gala in a week, Maria Stark Foundation, come with me please, I hate going to those things alone. The others are invited too but I want you.” Tony blinks, and Steve tries not to look too pleased with that slip of the tongue.
“Captain, your chariot awaits.”  The one he’d heard them all refer to as Black Widow said.  She was compact, petite, with a gymnasts build, and a gaze that made him feel a little like a stumbling boy just out of grade school again.
“I resent that you would think I could be that cruel.” He says gently.
Steve hopes he's right about Tony being Iron Man as much as he wants to be wrong. If he's right, and he's all but one hundred percent certain he is; then Tony is constantly putting himself in danger. His fella has a heart condition, it's common knowledge-and even though Steve can't really hear his heart, he
“Tony, now's not the time for jokes, they can't find anything wrong physically but every time we try and debrief you, you pass out. JARVIS had to pry you out of the armor.” Blue eyes says as if that's supposed to mean something to him, but Tony barely registers this completely incomprehensible statement, staring at the man incredulously.
“A long time ago I had a friend. He loved men and he always had to hide it. I wish he'd lived to see this.” He's not ready yet to tell them about himself, but just revealing that feels momentous. Jan's hand on his is solid and warm, she smiles at him and it's full of understanding.
“Hi.” Tony says, eyes crinkling with a wide smile.
“Tell him he’s on probation until you get to wear your dancing shoes.”  Tony said, after the lipstick was removed to Jan’s satisfaction, patting her hand and walking over to rifle through the fridge.  Jan sighed and sat back down at the table, she looked a little sleepy and entirely content.  Tony emerged from inside of the fridge a moment later with a tall glass filled with layers of granola and yogurt.  He set it down on the counter, pulling on his other glove-thin soft black leather-with rings sewn into it, smiling a little obscurely when he noted Steve watching him.  “Hi Steve.”  He said, sidling over to stand close, close enough for Steve to catch the scent of expensive spicy cologne and whatever it was Tony put in his hair to make it look so perfectly styled.  Steve shoved a bite of egg into his own mouth to keep from saying anything ridiculous.  “How did you sleep?”  Tony asked, seemingly oblivious to the way Steve’s heart rate kicked up by just having him near.
The rest of the week passes slowly, Tony leaves for a symposium on technology in Cairo and has to reschedule their date for the following Saturday. The other Avengers accuse him of moping, but Steve knows Tony is an incredibly busy man. He still misses him though. No word of Tiberius Stone arrives, and a part of Steve is relieved, another part is even more concerned. With neither hide nor hair of the man turning up it's impossible to know what he's planning, and how to prepare for that plan. It leaves Steve unsettled and agitated, especially with Tony gone and away from the team.  Sure, Iron Man is with him, but that's not really as comforting as it could be, given well, everything.
some poetic portion of his brain supplies.  “Has anyone ever told you you're an amazing artist? I mean, you play the piano something gorgeous, but this, this is a different kind of art.” He can't help the admiration from leaking into his tone, and he doesn't want to.  Tony stills, eyes going wide and snapping over to stare at him. Steve smiles at the look of surprise aimed his way, gesturing at the scene around them.  “You made this right?” He asks, the question more perfunctory than anything else.  Tony nods, silent and seemingly dumbstruck.
“Iron Man?” He asks, but there's no answer. Steve mulls it over, but Iron Man could be unconscious or worse, so he cracks the door open to peer into the space. Bright blue light draws his gaze immediately to the figure half collapsed in the corner.
“We’ll talk later, yeah, I’ll be back at the mansion tomorrow.”  Tony said, his arm firmly wrapped around Steve.  Warm, the armor was so warm.  Steve leaned against him a little more, and Tony hummed contentedly.  They watched Jan field questions for a few minutes, before Tony shepherded them over to speak with the reporters.  He was dazzling and charismatic as ever, and he kept his arm around Steve the entire time.
going to go back down to the lab to work on the probability engine, but with Steve looking at him so knowingly he knows the jig is up.
a Redsox fan.
good. Is it? Tony shakes himself, stepping out of the lab, only to yelp as he runs into a solid wall of Steve just as he's exiting the elevator on the first floor of the mansion.
“God, please yes, kiss me
It was nice, relaxed and casual in a way he didn’t think stepping out with Tony could have been.  Of course they weren’t stepping out, not like that, but it was still nice.  Tony chattered away, drank copious amounts of perrier, and happily signed autographs for the other restaurant patrons.  He was charming, witty, and so kind even when their meal kept getting interrupted.  He even drew one of his Iron Man stick figures on a napkin for a little tyke who bravely came over with his ma’.
“That's not him, looks like him, but that's not him, that's an AI-no offense JARVIS, but I'd like to see the real deal. Where's Tony.” Tony knows he ought to be a little disturbed by the fact that there's a holographic AI that looks exactly like him wandering around somewhere in the tower, but he just feels relieved. If he's as important as everyone seems to think he is, then all of his memories being gone could present a huge problem.
The enjoyment of the successful transformation was short lived however.  Dr. Erskine had been killed by an inside spy.  Steve had chased the spy down, seen him die, but that had not made holding Dr. Erskine’s body any easier.  One of the first people who believed in him, and he failed.
It's late when Steve makes his way down to the training room. He tapes his hands by rote, but his mind is full of too much. From the sad cast of Tony's face to the startling realization that his two best friends' in this new world may be the same person. He wants to know so badly if he is right, but he knows if the question were to be posed to Tony, he might lose even the slim glimpses of the man behind the masks he has been allowed to see. The thought of Tony cutting him off makes something nervous and cold lance through his body and he pushes the possibility away. Whatever Tony chooses to give him is enough. Has to be enough.  Besides, it's in the Avengers charter, and he'll respect Iron Man's identity, and Tony's secret until either of them confirms his suspicions. It's already more than he could have dreamed of-to be welcomed into Tony's lab, the new gear, Tony looking at him with hope, wonder, and something devastatingly unsure in the bright lights of his workshop.
He runs a hand up beneath Tony's robe, traces the strong line of his back, the slope of his shoulders.  He feels so warm, covered and comfortable here, with Tony's breaths puffing out against his neck. Tony murmurs sleepily when Steve rubs one broad palm over the soft skin of his lower back.  He cuddles closer, throwing one arm over Steve's shoulder, and Steve can't help but kiss the crown of his head, burying his nose in soft curling strands of jet black hair. He thinks of his lonely bed, how much he hates sleeping there, only doing so when it is absolutely necessary.  Here with Tony is nothing like that, and he finds himself yawning, sinking down into the soft cushioned bench. His thoughts feel fuzzy around the edges, warm and glowing with contentment. It's such an unusual feeling, one he hasn't felt for what seems like a lifetime now.
“I don't know what you're doing, but you need to-need to stop. What's your angle, what do you want from me why are you
Tastes like grass and sadness.
“The windows are tinted too dark for anyone to see in, Steve, gorgeous, it's okay. Unless you want me to stop,” Tony says, right up against his ear, breath fanning there and making Steve shiver.
“I can't even believe a guy in a Turkey suit interrupted my Saturday manicure.” Iron Man grouches over the comms.
He knows there are soulmates who are friends, he wonders if his will be a friend
Stai scherzando-Are you joking
“Still on for that date tomorrow?” He asks, pressing the heel of his palm into the arch of Tony's foot with one hand, and holding his ankle with the other.

“Not this time, it’s well. Things that belonged to you. I figured out years ago that the army had a bunch of your stuff locked away, and so I um,” he faltered, before soldiering on, “I bought it, before we found you. Some of it’s in museums, but I kept some of the things that seemed more personal, letters, and,” he trailed off, upon noting Steve was staring at him. The warehouse, his things, he thought them lost forever, figured the army would have tossed it all in the trash after he was declared dead.
“Did you call me down here to tease me?” He asks, voice gravelly with arousal. Tony hums something about friction coefficients under his breath in response. Steve's eyes narrow.
“Go to sleep Tony, you're tired.” He grumbles, wrapping one arm a little more tightly around the warm well muscled body pressed against his.  Tony laughs, but his eyes drop shut with a soft huff of breath when Steve runs his fingers through his hair.
“Oh Steve.” He murmurs. “I'm never too busy for
“So, no coffee yet, or you haven't gotten the chance to go to bed?” Steve asks over the comms, tossing his shield to take out a row of bots. Tony grunts, laying down cover fire so Widow can back-flip across the ground towards Doom's monologueing figure.
sweetheart.” Steve is kissing him again, clasping him close and Tony just gives himself over to it, sinking into that love and warmth; uncaring of where they are, and the fact that Fury probably just got front row seats to their relationship drama. None of that matters because Steve
“It was hurting you.” Steve says without a second thought.
“Cap your arm is broken, closed break from the scans, but we can't just leave it like that with how fast you heal. Avengers-go scout around while we get this taken care of.” Iron Man says over the comms.  He hears several exclamations of concern, but confirms Iron Man's orders, they won't figure anything out standing around worrying about his arm.
“Yeah, it definitely is, and it's
“Oh my god.” Rhodes says, looking up at the ceiling as if he's saying a prayer for patience. “I can't believe I get to witness this,” he mutters with what sounds like intense gratitude.  Steve's eyebrows go up a little bit in alarm when Rhodes mouths a silent thank you in the direction of the sky.  “We were both standing here,” he gestures around at the room, speaking slowly as if he's not sure whether or not Steve's really all there. “right here in this kitchen right?” He continues, and Steve nods.  Rhodes just stares at him for long moments, as if he's sizing him up, he shakes his head.  Steve feels he's just been declared a hopeless cause.  “So then neither one of us just imagined that-with the almost kissing, and the flirting?”
“I love it when you're focused on your work.” He says quietly. Tony blinks, eyes raising from his screen to meet his.
“Go on another date with me.” He blurts. Tony stills against him. “That is if you still want to, after. After this.”
“I'd like to put my hands all over you, but that's not something fit for present company.” Maybe it's bold and over the top, but some sad part of him just knows Tony won't believe his complete sincerity on the matter. As if reading the direction of his thoughts, Tony laughs, slipping his hands away from Steve's to swoon across his lap in a pantomime of a faint.
this?” There's a part of him that wishes Steve was easy to figure out, that wishes taking one look at Steve didn't fill him with the desperate sort of longing he thought had been left behind before college, before Sunset.
Hammer has been moved from his high security cell to one with physical bars in place of the electrical stasis field. In here it's quiet, the SHIELD agent stepping into the background to allow Tony to walk right up to the bars.
Had there been a fairy fluttering around his face?  Was he having dreams about Tinkerbelle now?  That was new, but not unwelcome.
“He better.”  She said with a smile.  “Good luck, take care of yourself, and thank you for that save with the Brooklyn bridge.”  She passed him her business card with a wink.  Steve gave her a little salute after taking the bag with his purchases.
Steve twirls the stylus Tony passed over to him when they first walked into the room, and Tony pauses mid-rant to take a sip of his shake. How he does that without gagging, Steve has no idea, he even seems to
“Walk of shame already?” Comes a voice from behind them.  Steve's mouth stills against his, and Tony groans, tilting his head back to glare at the person standing in the doorway.
glad Thor is on their side.
“My name is-” Tony thinks about that for a long moment, everyone in the room seems to be holding their breath. “Tony. Tony something, anyway. Not important,
“Good morning, hermoso, how did you sleep?  I've brought us breakfast, are you hungry?” Tony asks, scooting closer and dropping a sweet kiss over the back of Steve's neck.  His hair is still damp, the clean spicy scent of him wafts over as he leans over Steve to seemingly kiss every bit of exposed skin available.  Steve grunts, feeling his cheeks heat when Tony helps him roll over and perches himself atop Steve's stomach, and he realizes the robe Tony is wearing is all he has on.  Red fabric opens in a long vee all the way down past his navel, and the spread of his gorgeous thighs makes Steve's mouth go dry. God that's a lot of skin, Steve wants to kiss him everywhere.
needing help, and if anyone has anything to say about it they can come talk to me.” Tony is getting all worked up into a rant, Steve can hear it in his voice, feel it in the way his shoulders square. The little guy he used to be, and the scrappy bastard he
Buoyed by Pepper and JARVIS' approval, he picks a red button up, and a pristine pair of black slacks, tossing the old clothes into the laundry chute on his way out of the closet. If there's one thing he misses with his whole secret arc reactor business it's wearing comfortable t-shirts out in public. No matter how slim he makes the chest plating, how snugly the lip of the reactor sits against his chest; it's still too noticeable under thin cotton for his particular brand of paranoia. There have been many an op-ed piece concerning Tony's sartorial choices post Afghanistan. Speculation as to why he's almost always in a suit when out in public as opposed to the more casual looks he used to favor abounds.
Do note, this chapter becomes VERY, VERY smutty, so if you're not into that, just be uh...aware.
“Well.” He growls, biting at Tony's lips. “I have the red covered, seemed appropriate, underwear's real uncomfortable though sweetheart I don't know how you stand it.”
“Don't apologize. It's beautiful. I haven't heard that in a long time.”
“Let him in Jay.” A moment later the doors whoosh open, and in comes Steve Rogers himself. Is he holding a silver tray? How did he get into a shirt that tight? Is that pomade in his hair? So many questions. Tony just barely keeps his eyes from bugging.
“Yeah? You like it?” Tony's arms drop to his sides when Steve gets right up in his space. He tilts his head back slightly, and it strikes Steve with absolute surety that it would only take one word of disapproval for tony to fold up like a house of cards. Tony always looks at him as if his opinion
Magic. No scratch that, not magic, but just as astounding, the future, she's the future.”  Tony is doing that thing he does sometimes, where his brain is moving so quickly that he seems to buzz with energy.  His eyes are bright, belying the mind behind them working away feverishly.
“Fuck, okay, whatever you want, anything, you can have it.” Tony cuts himself off, winding his legs around Steve's waist and pulling him into a kiss so scorching hot that Steve nearly stumbles. Tony's hands clutch at his shoulders, deftly unclipping the shield and letting it clang onto the ground when he's lowered onto the cool surface of the table, but he doesn't pause in kissing Steve for even a second.  Distantly he registers the shield rolling off to hit the wall, but it's not important.  Not with Tony kissing him like
want?”
Kisses on the cheek are joined by lingering touches. Tony again seems a bit confused, but he also seems to relish the contact. Steve's hugs are always returned; Tony turning into the affection and warmth like a flower to the sun.
“Tony,” Steve grits out in a voice that makes Tony want to do anything but but behave. Still a no is a no, Tony can take a hint. So he puts his hands properly back on the table, stealing another kiss just because he can, and leaning back in his seat to play footsie under the table like a good forties boy.
“Captain America is a dirty pervert, will wonders never cease?” Tony says with a grin, head leaning back into the pillows to bare the long line of his throat.
Tony's breath stutters in his chest, he turns his head, brushing the whisper of a kiss over Steve's temple. His pets Steve's hair, holds him close with his other arm, and presses his knees into Steve's sides, holding him there, keeping him close. He wants to take Tony's cock in his hand, he can feel it leaking wetly where it's trapped between their bodies, but Tony didn't tell him to, not yet, maybe soon. He thinks of Tony's come on his fingers, thinks about the sounds Tony makes when he's close. Just the memory of it makes him whine against Tony's neck, makes him press more insistently on Tony's prostate, until Tony bucks against him and his body goes taut with pleasure.
Update:  There WILL be an epilogue once I finish ch.10 of my longfic, thank you all for your words of encouragement!
“We can shower together, then sleep. Here.” Steve keeps his tone firm but still gentle.  Tony stares at him, mouth opening and closing.  “Tony. You didn't think I would do something like this with you and just...leave after, did you?” Steve asks carefully.  Tony's silence and slightly wounded expression say everything he needs to know on that front.  “I don't want you to think I'm saying this because we just had sex.”
“Tony? Is this...I can sit further away if-” Steve whispers, sounding so nervous that Tony just wants to kiss him all over his stupidly beautiful face.
“Just think you ought to eat more.  If my ma’ saw you she’d bust my chops for not feeding you up right.  Maybe some potato stew, a nice thick steak.” Potato stew sounds great with how cold it is outside.  It reminds him of home, of his mom standing waving a spoon at him and teaching him Gaelic swear words on a Saturday morning.
“Okay.” He concedes. “Okay, but no crazy plans until we talk first.”
Another compartment opens on the armor to pop out an odd little device. Iron Man shakes it out to reveal a sort of complex wire skeleton. That must be the splint, definitely better than the twig splints he's made in a pinch in the past. He would share that with Iron Man, but then he would probably start swearing again. Steve really wishes he was out of the armor now, that he could see Tony's face, but he knows this is not the time to push. This thing between them is still so tenuous, even the slightest step in the wrong direction and everything might fall down like a house of cards.
“I always did like him, but we’ve been at loggerheads before.  He’s mean as a hornet when he wants to be, but I don’t take it personal.”  The rush was still buzzing through him, but Steve paid it no mind, there was nothing for it.  Maybe his new friends could direct him to a gym when they got back from wherever it was they were.
“No one ever said I was fair” Steve murmurs, leaning back in the seat and bringing his other hand up to lick and suck at his fingers, blue eyes locked with Tony's as he draws his fingers out of his mouth and reaches behind Tony.
“No. If I...if I leave now some of the donations might fall through.” Tony shakes his head, raking a hand over his face.
The movie has been rolling for a few minutes when Steve shifts next to him, tugging him inexorably closer with one strong arm.
It was short lived, but it had been a one time sort of thing anyway.  It didn’t break Steve’s heart, but later, back at his hotel where he was staking out another Goddamned spy, he missed the calming presence of another person beside him.
“Ravish me Captain Rogers, I can't take it anymore.” Tony says, voice high as Steve lets him use his arm for support so he doesn't topple onto the floor.
“This was never a date, Roy, and yes, now clasp arms so we can sit and I can buy him food.  He’s a
Natasha never requests meetings unless she's onto something big.
He remembers.
“Oh yeah, he say what he needed?”
“Oh, are you asking me to put on happy relationship pounds, hot stuff?”  Tony sounds delighted, reprising his spot behind Steve to show him how to go about chopping the pecans.  It feels strange to be the one being shielded, being wrapped up in strong secure arms. Tony’s not quite big enough to manage it fully, but he loves it just the same.
How does Tony know just what to say? He wonders sometimes. He knows Tony is not fragile by any means, but Steve also knows his own strength, just how easy it would be to lose control and really hurt Tony while in the throes of passion. It's something he won't risk for anything-but this, what Tony is offering. Steve swallows, trying and failing not to give a little roll up his hips up against Tony's thigh. Tony just lies more heavily atop him, gently nudging his thigh up between Steve's legs, but he's looking at Steve so, so intently that he feels like he's burning up inside with want and the desire to give Tony everything he could ever ask for.
“Mister Stark needs to see to Iron Man's injuries. I will be taking control of the suit in order to fly him back to the mansion barring further need for assistance. It seems you have all in hand here Captain Rogers.” JARVIS' voice is smooth and crisp. The armor rises jerkily, joints locking into Iron Man's characteristic flight pose.
“Thanks Cap, uh. What's on the agenda then? Skee ball? Darts? That strength test with the hammer? Because I hate to tell you this but Thor already broke it.” Tony says, gesturing over to their resident Asgardian and his gigantic lion plush.
“Tessalon perles are non narcotic, I asked the pharmacist, and you know Bruce wouldn't prescribe opioids for you unless it was unavoidable.” Natasha's voice is smooth and calming. “Relax Tony, just rest.”
strong, persistent desire or craving, especially for something unattainable or distant:
There wasn’t really anything he could have said to that.  Not without being a total heel who ignored their wishes.  Besides, Steve supposed they were right.  He was just a skinny little alpha walking up to them.  There was no reason for them to have believed he was capable of holding his own against anyone really, alpha or not.
“You know it's true Steve.” Bucky says, a slight smirk playing around the corners of his lips.
The rest of the Avengers will be at the gala too, but they are showing up on their own time. Tony hopes no one besmirches their honor in front of Thor. He tends to take any rude statements about the Avengers as a personal affront. He wonders if anyone will manage to wrangle their resident space prince into a tux. Or Clint. Last Tony had seen, Natasha and Carol were trying to wrestle Legolas into formal-wear in the same way one might go about putting a sweater on a recalcitrant cat. Tony will watch that video later and bask in the screaming.
!” Tony shouts more loudly than he intended. He drags himself to his feet on unsteady legs, unable to look Steve in the face and see the inevitable disappointment there. “I leave and the show is over-they want a Tony Stark Performance. I leave now and that's less water treatment plants, less of everything. I leave now and that's blood on my hands Steve.”
mad at having his beauty sleep disrupted.
“Someone broke them out, and they’re spreading some kind of adhesive substance all over, the brooklyn bridge is at a standstill.”  Giant Man was reading a file, he could see all sorts of chemical diagrams in it he couldn’t make heads or tails of.  However, the mention of adhesive, that was interesting, and not in a good way.
Tony was scarce for the next two weeks, but still showed up for movie night.  He was curled in the center of Natasha, Clint and Jan, eating a sandwich when Steve walked in to join them.  The lettuce slid out of the sandwich and down onto Clint’s face, where it was pillowed on his thigh.  “Oh my God.”  He said.  Clint ate the lettuce.  Tony ignored him, staring over at Steve with wide eyes.
“Someone else he stepped out with, they're why we're having this little tête-à-tête, aren't they?" The words sound gritted out but Steve can't help it. Just the thought of what Rhodes implied makes something hot and furious settle in his gut.
The first thing he did after eating and going for a jog, he was not proud of. He went to his room, unlocked his tablet, and searched for Tony’s Rolling Stone cover.
“Oh no.” Tony says, pulling away from Steve, looking between the child and Steve.
. Iron man's words filter back to him as he catches sight of the moon outside his window. Steve heads to the gym. He doesn't sleep that night, too afraid he'll wake and another seventy years will have passed.
“Don't. Do not sacrifice yourself for me. If ever there's a choice between you and me Shellhead, you better not choose me.” In the light of the hall Steve feels the eyeslits boring into him like a physical touch. Iron Man is silent for a moment before speaking again.
“Steven.” Tony says gravely. “I never stopped.”
shoot him in the face, I promise it won't kill him.” Hawkeye calls over the comms. “Much.”
Tony jolts when Steve lays him flat, sucking in a rasping breath and curling up on his side as he had the night before. His hand flails out for the jar on the nightstand. Steve passes it over wordlessly, turning his back quickly when Tony pulls his shirt up to rub the stuff all over his chest. Nothing but the vaguest impressions of something dark and shiny wrapped around the upper half of Tony's torso remains. Steve swallows jerkily when Tony makes a soft sound of relief behind him. The comforter rustles, and the soft thump of the jar hitting the floor suggests Tony has covered up, but Steve refuses to see what he has not been invited to.  Steve isn't shy about nudity, he was in the army after all, but this is different, this is
In this position, he can't pull all the way out, but it's perfect. He can grind himself inside Tony, press along the spots inside him that must be tender now from when Steve was inside him before. He thinks maybe that's why Tony chose it, and it's so gratifying to feel the way Tony's body flutters around him with each thrust, to hear him sigh and moan, and urge him on.
Steve shakes his head, bringing Tony's hand up to press another kiss against his knuckles.  Just as before it seems to make Tony almost hold his breath.  “Don't stop. I'm glad that you...that you think of me and want to make things to keep me-and the Avengers safe. So thank you again Tony.” He says, giving Tony the brightest smile he can manage.  Tony is looking at him now, really looking.  It's an expression he's seen on Tony's face so many times now, the look he's been giving the long scrawling lines of math he can't seem to put down these days, a puzzle, something unknown.  It's vaguely satisfying to be able to throw a super-genius for a loop, but he'd much rather Tony see how much Steve cares for him, how highly he thinks of him.
“Run while you can, I can't control it anymore. You're in danger.” Tony reads the words, then reads them again. It looks like Ty is still the most dramatic asshole on the planet.
“Not it.” She calls, spinning the arm around and using it to send the Doom-Bot crashing to the ground. Somehow her short-spiky blond hair remains perfectly styled. Steve wonders if that's one of her superpowers too.
He walked Steve to his bedroom, popping his head in the doorway and leaving him with a murmured ‘
“I hear you, just relax, let me do this.” Says Steve, getting his knees under himself and dragging Tony's hips up onto his lap, shifting him to push one of his thighs wide, while draping the other over his shoulder.
They speak every night, all through the day, sometimes Steve will be sleeping only to wake to the sound of Tony's harsh breathing. The time alone is not doing him well. It's dragging at him, wearing on his ability to sleep, on everything.
she's one of the best people in his orbit.
“Steve does
with beautiful things
. His mind chants in recrimination. He braces his feet, hefts the shield up.
“Don't steal my vegetables.” Bruce says mildly, eyeing Tony's hand creeping towards a plate of sliced raw produce.
“Just answer me, why did you go and fight this fight that wasn’t yours?”  The man asked again, and Steve could have slid over the hood of the car, could have run, but something about the man made him answer.
Tony grunts in aggravation, eyes snapping up despite himself.  “What, hey, that's not nice.” He croaks out, grabbing his abandoned glass of scotch, the melting ice sloshes with the slight tremor in his grip. He doesn't drink it, just holds it, the comforting weight of it in his hand is enough for now. It's probably a pretty bad idea to get drunk right now anyway. Inebriated and maudlin are a decidedly bad combination. Tony knows that all too well. Tony has always felt like there's some terrible chasm at the center of him. A bitter sort of loneliness he can't even begin to address for fear of trusting someone with his heart. He's tried all kinds of things to fill that void, but alcohol and casual sex don't make up for much, no matter how fun they are, who knew? It's been better with Steve around though.  Better, and worse.  He's deliriously happy Steve seems to want him, but it's still terrifying, feeling himself wanting again, putting his heart out there and hoping Steve will actually want it.
“Thanks Jay.” He whispers, turning onto his side and holding tightly to his bright yellow pillow.
“I'm going down to the lab when we get back. I have a lot to work on.” He finally says, surprising even himself as he breaks the thick silence.
him. What's that saying? Everything is beautiful and nothing hurts?
“Yes-”  He gets out “all for you, all clean for you.”
“You smell like cookies.” Steve murmurs against the soft, sweet smelling strands.  Tony takes a pointed sip of his hot cocoa, biting the head off of a reindeer.
She screamed as it hit her, clearly not expecting Steve to strike out at something wearing Bucky’s face.  The rushing in his ears grew stronger, he caught the shield on the rebound.  All at once New York City was back, or forward, depending on how you looked at it.  There were helicopters up in the sky, beside him the wind kicked up, and Thor landed just as Amora got to her feet.  He could hear Giant Man over the comms making short work of Executioner.
I have things I need to do, Pepper needs me to-” Even to his own ears he sounds just a tad bit panicky.
“True,” Tony laughs, blessedly, terribly, taking his hands away from those bright hot spots of pleasure. He only has a moment to miss the sensation and then an entirely new one is making him gasp. Tony sits back, getting a hand around his dick and then raising up, pressing Steve against him right
“Missed you, I'm sorry you're sick, should have told me so I coulda brought you something on the way home from the mission.” He murmurs against the blanket covering Tony's head. Tony frowns deeply, sighing when Steve kisses the top of his head.
“Oh look at how pretty you are, how good, so sweet for me.” Tony all but purrs, holding himself up at the apex of the thrust; the corded lines of his thigh muscles standing out as he makes Steve breathless with want, with anticipation.
“No it's fine Steve, not like we haven't slept together before.” The devious grin on Tony's face suggests he knows exactly what sort of innuendo he's just made.
“You will not, because as you have expressed on many occasions, I am your favorite-and as I am your favorite I have flown to Italy and brought you chocolates in your time of need.” In Thor's massive arms Tony stops squirming, fixing the Asgardian with a wide eyed stare.
“It does feel good, you weren't hurting me.” Tony snaps his mouth shut before he can do something as undignified as begging. To his relief Steve doesn't ask any further questions, just resumes rubbing at his back with slow even motions. Tony sags against him, as Steve strokes the fingers of his other hand over his jaw.
“You, you dirty-fuck, does anyone know Captain America is such a-” What he was going to say is cut off with a moan as Steve's hips rock up against his own. “Oh god, Steve, please-oh please, you've been driving me out of my mind-but oh god, is this okay?”
in there.
Outside it's snowing, Tony can see it through the giant windows. He wraps the fluffy blanket around his shoulders more tightly, clutching his mug of hot chocolate and taking a long sip to feel the pleasant heat warm him from the inside out. Behind him a razor thin television plays a movie that came out five years ago. Tony doesn't remember it, but he does remember the exact year and day it came out. The functionality of his mind is unquestionable. He
“Keep any lab explosions away from Mister Stark if you can, we need him around here.”  He says, shooting Mister Stark a wink.  Tony looks scandalized, setting his now empty plate down and glaring between the two of them.
do to survive is to find a distraction, and the Avengers are here, if you decide you need that.”
Tony catches the Ferris wheel, firing the jet boots to slow the acceleration and compensate for the massive amounts of force being exerted on the supports holding it in place. His sound dampeners quiet the screech of metal on metal, but it's still loud enough to be wince inducing.
“Tony-” She sing songs. “Tony come sleep, plus I think Cap wants to discuss some uh...some training stuff! Yeah, some training stuff, he's got lots to talk about.” Steve blinks over at her grinning face.
' Self control is a terrible invention and Tony is so sorry he still has any left. Natasha makes her way over to Steve, looking over his shoulder and grinning.
He really, really wants to get back on the couch, but his brain just won't shut up-running through countless scenarios as well as reminding him of his massive to-do list. Steve seems to sense his inner turmoil, slipping his hands up to press his thumbs right over Tony's hipbones. It's enough to derail his train of thought completely, and he stares down at Steve as if he's seeing him for the first time again. So apparently Steve really isn't shy. That's probably a good thing, because once he gets the go ahead, Tony is going to scale that wall of muscle if it's the last thing he does.
Pink rose-happiness, please believe me, passion.
calls him pretty, no one except Tony.
“JARVIS, set up a sweep for Vibranium, that should narrow things down pretty quick. It can't have gone far.” He says, staying close to Steve as they pick their way through the underbrush. There's debris everywhere. Cracked and fallen trees lie strewn about, behind them there is a massive trail of destruction where the train was flung like a toy from the tracks. Something like dread curdles in Steve's stomach.
“You don't have to, it was just a thought, it's silly.” Steve says against Tony's lips, growling when he gets strong fingers tugging at his hair in response.
“JARVIS belay that, no pictures of me naked.” Steve laughs, shooting Tony an indulgent grin as he finishes tucking corners in and making the bed up to his liking.
“They didn’t really tell me much, I know we’re here about qualifying for some fancy program, but it’s all Greek to me.”  Steve said, patting Hayward’s hand when she grunted in affirmation.
“I'd be honored to do that. To have you trust me enough for that, but I only wanna do things you love, I want to make you feel so good Tony, because you are good, God, you're so perfect.” Steve's words twist down Tony's spine in a rush of sensation; as if he reached out and physically caressed him.
“Oh. Well okay then, twist my arm. I guess I can go have treats with my favorite.”
“Put a pink swizzle stick in my whiskey, I feel fancy.” He says to the bartender, dropping a few large bills into his tip jar when he gets not one but
“We've found something, Tony, Tones, come on, you have to see this!” There is more being said, but it fizzles out, drowned out by the sound of something cracking, loud and horrible to his ears. He's there on the deck, and down below in swirling waters. The ocean heaves, pulling at him, tumbling him down, down into the dark, dragging at him like clawing hands, a wild creature refusing to let go of its prize. He reaches up, up towards where he knows the sky is now, up towards the medallion around his soulmate's neck.
The pillows arrived right on time, delivered to him with a smile by Jarvis.  They were in discreet cardboard packaging.  Steve felt almost as furtive opening up the boxes as he might have felt cracking open a case of marital aides.  He filled the big pudgy cat pillow in his bathroom, waiting until the water was almost too hot to bear, and then climbing under the heated blanket with it.  He pressed his face against the soft fluffy fabric of the pillow, held it tightly to his chest.  It wasn’t a person, and it didn’t make his body feel all that much less like a live wire, but it still felt nice in his arms.  Steve breathed in, breathed out, tried to relax, tried to tell his body that it was alright, he could rest.
“I thought we could stay here, make dinner together, catch a few movies, just relax.” Tony turns toward him, glance uncertain as he too slips his shoes off. “Does that sound like something you would enjoy?” Tony steps a little closer, lashes dipping as he looks up at Steve.
“Yeah.”  He sighed, and Tony stood up, holding out his gloved hands for Steve to take.
“Can we watch another movie?” Well, it was worth a try. Tony sighs, settling down against Steve and telling JARVIS to queue up Monsters Inc-Steve is having a passionate affair with PIXAR Tony just knows it. After a few minutes Steve pulls Jan's blanket back on and kisses the top of his head. Tony snuffles into the space between them sleepily.
“Smart ass, thank you, any
“Fuck, Tony.” Steve knows the plug isn't nearly as big as he is, but for just a moment he calls Tony's bluff; bracing one hand on Tony's hip, and using the other to guide himself just barely into warm gripping heat. His eyes almost cross at the tightness, and Tony makes a high punched out sound, trying and failing to push back against him, only the hand on his hip keeps him still.
“Good, you're so good, just look at you, perfect.” Steve moans out, sounding awed and out of his head as he always does when Tony lets him do this.
“Oh. Well, I liked kissing you too, you're a great kisser Steve, anyone would be lucky to kiss you regularly.” That doesn't seem to have been the right thing to say. Steve makes a kind of groaning laughing sound, and then he's pulling away, shooting Tony another one of those not-quite-smiles over his shoulder.
“Might be, you wearing one too, huh Shellhead?”
“I missed you so much.” The admission costs him nothing, it's the truth after all. Tony makes a small wounded sound against his shoulder, lashes wet when he looks up at Steve.
“Why not, feels good, warm.” Tony answers slowly, once he's dragged his gaze away from what little metal peeks out from beneath Bucky's sleeve. That arm is just so
“Sir there appears to be a very small amount of Vibranium very close by.” JARVIS says in that cool crisp way of his that's all sass.  Iron Man snorts.
A strange series of sounds follows from behind the door, then the crunch and whir technology between metal. Iron Man must have crushed the old reactor. Even in the safety of the jet the concern for someone picking up his old tech seems to run strong.
“I’m not joining any sort of funny business enterprise.”  Steve said with as much conviction as he could muster, he knew it was rude to interrupt people while they spoke, but there was no way this could be on the level.  He was probably going to get bumped off if he wasn’t careful.
He stays a little longer to update security software and check camera feeds. The compound is quiet, the intruder long, long gone. Tony's shoulders slump in defeat after he reboots the darkened machines and gets everything running again. He walks outside after double and triple checking his people are safe, punching the autopilot for New York as he takes off into the sky. During the flight back he monitors feeds from all around the Seattle facility. The whole place had gone dark the moment Ty had shown up, but some grainy CCTV footage caught his figure on the way there. He had been traveling by foot, in a dark gray hoodie and scuffed work boots. He doesn't look good at all. Ty has always been a preening asshole, seeing him looking better suited to a dive bar than a rooftop lounge is jarring. It makes something awful and nervous creep along Tony's spine. He resolves to improve security on the Arc powering the mansion, and his own personal reactor, the one faithfully keeping his heart running. He gets the feeling there's a whole lot of magic at play here, but the monster, and Ty himself left Seattle's reactor intact.
Of course Bucky’s favorite would have been Natasha, all things considered, Bucky’d always had a soft spot for redheads and danger in small packages.  The first time they sparred, he hadn’t quite known where her skills were, but she’d cleaned his clock impressively.  Steve was only too happy to scrape himself off the floor afterwards and shoot her a salute.  She had looked surprised but pleased, and given him a sly little wink that made his ears crimson.  Her scent was hard to place, dark and sweet, and slightly bitter, he thought she might be an omega, but he couldn’t be too sure, she seemed to favor perfumes, and he had never known an omega to be ex-Russian intelligence.  He was sure there was a story there, but Natasha seemed guarded, so he didn’t ask.
"Ten points, ten points for me!"
Tony's room is unchanged from the last time Steve was in it, but that's not what his attention is on when he's pushed into sitting on the edge of the bed, and Tony is sliding atop his lap to press devouring kisses to his lips. Steve gasps, hands curling around Tony's hips, then further down to knead the firm muscles of his ass; holding him in place even as he squirms and sucks on Steve's tongue.
“Bucky used to rub my back when this happened.” He blurts out, feeling stupid the moment it leaves his mouth. Iron Man said he had them too-before. He must understand, he won't judge Steve for this, or at least Steve hopes so. He doesn't think Tony would judge him either. Tony is good and kind, and so gentle with the pain of others even if he pretends to be careless and fickle for the cameras. Steve knows the truth.  “People don't...after the serum.” the words are garbled, but Iron man just waits patiently, letting Steve take his gauntleted hands in his; the little baggie of food falls to the wayside, forgotten for now. “People don't touch me anymore and I miss it. I miss it so much, but I can't ask for that.” Inside the armor, Iron Man takes a sharp breath.
“Oh poor Captain.”  Amora said, with Bucky’s face.  “Did you lose something?”
“Really,
Tony is gone the next day-off on a business trip to Osaka according to JARVIS. Iron Man is with him, standing tall and gleaming at his side in the pictures that soon surface on the more reputable news sites the AI suggested to him. He wonders if the pilot is in the suit today, something niggling at the back of his mind supplies a resounding
sparkly sticks in his very nice glass of top shelf single malt.
Tony would be more worried about it if he wasn't so goddamn happy. Rhodey is probably going to name his first kid after Steve in honor of all this. In all honesty it's not that Tony dislikes the thought of someone clearly wanting to cherish him. It just makes him nervous. What if he reads something he don't like? What if Steve figures out the truth about Tony: That he's fucked up and tainted, and undeserving of someone like him, that he's hiding more secrets than a SHIELD dossier. And that's the kicker isn't it? Tony is
Tony snorts in response, cracking his eyes open to fix Steve with a mock glare.  “What kind of boy do you think I am-wait don't answer that.”
It seems only logical to kiss him then. Tony sighs against his lips, welcoming him as if he's been waiting. He traces his tongue over the seam of Tony's mouth, shivering when it opens easily for him. Tony presses closer, bunching his hands in the fabric of Steve's shirt, then slipping them around his waist to spread his palms over the dip in his spine. It's a sweet kiss, but still lights a fire in Steve's blood. Something slow and simmering like embers twists through him when he gently tugs Tony's bottom lip between his teeth, and dark eyes slit open halfway to fix him with a hot expectant stare.
is going on?” There's an edge of hysteria creeping into his voice so he dials it back, slumping on the couch like a puppet with the strings cut.
"Thanks Captain Marvel, you're a beautiful sight as ever."  He says, shooting her a little salute where she's hovering beside him.
“Same goes for you, Cap, no getting hurt.” God, if he gets any more awkward he's going to start slapping Steve's back companionably and talking about the weather. Miraculously though, Steve seems to take this in stride.
JARVIS sighs theatrically, pulling up the footage of Steve stroking his hair and tucking him into bed.  “I do not think he would care, and I think sir, that at the very least you owe it to yourself to test the waters.” Tony replays the footage from the previous night over and over.
“I'm sorry.” Bucky whispers.
Thank you
. Tony thinks, burying his fingers in Steve's soft hair and letting himself be kissed into oblivion.
“Yeah um. Well he thought that at the very least you deserved a proper burial. We didn't expect to find you alive. Which by the way, wow. Amazing, incredible. Stark is going to have an aneurysm.”
Steve frowned. “Don’t tell me what to worry about, mister. I can worry if I like.”
“I can’t really tell, and I don’t want to ask, or put my nose right on him, it wouldn’t be proper.”  He fell into a sort of pseudo parade rest as he spoke.  The saleswoman-Julia her nametag said-her eyebrows rose, and she smiled as if she’d just been given the best present in the world.
“Have a present for you.” Steve murmurs, the smile on his face verging on a shit eating grin when Tony opens his eyes to squint up at him suspiciously.
“I can usually smell it,” Steve said, feeling awkward and foolish even as the words left his mouth, “but I couldn’t with you. You’ve been smelling a little different though recently.” He hurriedly made an addendum to that when Tony’s eyebrows quirked upwards, “you smell good though, really good, nice, sweet.” Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.
His trek up the wall left him atop it, with a perfect vantage point of the courtyard. He dropped down, laid his body flat along the top of the wall to hide his silhouette in the slowly brightening light of dawn. Zemo was there alright, with his back to Steve, surrounded by six of his sorry little minions. There were storage trailers full of weapons arrayed about, but none of them seemed to be carrying one, except Zemo himself. Good, he was still unexpected. Steve took a deep breath and dropped down silently behind one of the trailers, pressing his back to it and peering around it to get a good look and gauge where he needed to approach.
tiramisu, hook line, buy a ring,
“Sounds like you speak from experience.”
There's no avoiding the thought with all of that pressed against him. Steve is very, extremely,
want Steve? Tell me because I don't get it. You want toys I'll build you a hundred of 'em; you don't have to do this. Or maybe you want to fuck me, go on, I'm easy, ask anyone, I'll spread my legs for you right here, or suck you off if that's more your speed.” He leans back, lets his tuxedo clad thighs fall open; giving Steve an under the lashes glance that screams invitation. He knows some people get off on that whole debauched formal-wear aesthetic, and Tony wears it like a second skin. “Don't worry Happy's seen it all.” He says bitterly.  Steve's face twists with something; anger, but then sadness, and that's not right at all.
“Not what I asked.”
“Not important, didn't happen.” Natasha doesn't look particularly pleased with him, but what's new.  “Nat, I'm
“You don't need to put that in a sling, it's almost undetectable under long sleeved shirts too. Just wear a hoodie or a sweater if you don't want anyone seeing it. I know you're probably still going to be ridiculous and go on one of your jogs.” Steve really does
Tucked beneath the heated blanket that still smelled faintly of Tony, he thought about what it would look like if Tony accepted his gifts, both of them, and actually wore them.  Tony in one of his fancy oxford shirts, with all the buttons undone, and the waist chain wrapped around his hips, gems hugging his gorgeous thighs.  The rush of heat hit him suddenly, rolling over the drop with such force he could have sworn he
” The dark smoky look Tony sends his way makes his gut clench, not unpleasantly. He licks his suddenly dry lips, slipping his hand away from Tony's cheek and sitting down heavily on the piano bench before his knees wobble out from under him.
“You’re crackers, kid, but fine, if that’s what you wanna do.”  Big head said.  Steve wondered how the guy could even turn his head with a neck that thick.
“By the way,” she said, her head just poking in the doorway, her smile left Steve feeling a little exposed, “if you need new sheets, the main linen closet is right across the entrance to this room.”
“If he doesn't talk, Widow will take over, but we thought you should try and get the jerk to spill his guts first.” Jan's Wasp costume looks particularly shiny today. Tony wonders if she added a fresh coating of color reflective cells to it. Everyone is looking at him, including Steve. It becomes obvious to him that they're all waiting for something, and Tony feels a strange foreign realization steal over him like a wave. They all want to come with him, they really
“JARVIS? I'm sorry. I don't mean any harm, just looks uncomfortable.” There's a silence as if the AI is considering his intentions, and then he speaks again.
“What are you doing up anyway Steve?” Tony murmurs, their faces are pressed together, and Steve can't help but nuzzle him, just a little.
Steve thinks as Tony starts listing off the astounding properties of his new gear.  “And it's completely bulletproof, because I cannot BELIEVE that you were running around in tights.” Tony throws his hands up, giving a horrified little shriek “Tights!  You can't fight monsters and magic,"  Tony shudders, "in tights, Steve, it is a travesty, a disaster, but now you have.” Tony gets up, walking over to unzip the suit from inside its protective covering. “Stark Tech!” The robot makes a little buzzing 'ta da' sound, and Steve has to fight down the irrational urge to pet it.
Tony wakes with the taste of salt water in his mouth, collapsed in the kitchen with Rhodey shaking him, eyes wide and worried as Tony coughs and chokes on the floor, his lungs full of water on dry land.
“All I want is you, want to make you happy, seeing you enjoy yourself, that's what I want.” Steve's voice is hoarse, his kisses grow a little firmer, but they don't progress into anything heavier. Tony feels as if he's coming apart at the seams with frustration.
That is how all of the Avengers, save for the Hulk-who stays in the tower much to Tony's obvious distress-end up sleeping in the Avenjet. It's too hot during the day, and cold at night, the Avenjet suits their purposes nicely. On the first night they sleep in hammocks in the cargo bay, but Jan soon deems this unacceptable. Twenty minutes and several miracles later she and Tony have covered a section of the floor in pillows and blankets. It looks inviting and homey all at once; strangely not out of place in the belly of the jet.
Tony’s mouth moved for a moment, and then he slowly lowered the sandwich.  “Why are you dressed like a centerfold, Steve?”
. Whatever that means, he doesn't seem to take issue with his Avengers communicator at least.
“I know you do, and trust me, watching you enjoy yourself is the most gorgeous thing I've ever seen.”  Tony shifts up, pushing the tray back and then swinging a leg over to take a seat atop Steve's thighs. Steve tries not to focus on the very sure knowledge that Tony is completely bare beneath that robe, and sitting on his lap.  “I also know you've been wanting this, and I want it too.”
“Steve, honey, that's-that's Shh, Steve baby, it's okay-” Tony soothes, combing his fingers through Steve's hair, brushing his fingertips over his brows, his cheeks, the bridge of his nose. It's such a gentle touch, so full of concern that Steve shuts his eyes tightly, clutching Tony as closely as he can.
, we had a sort of friendly rivalry thing going on, or at least I
He thought, as he stared at the image on the screen faintly.
“Oh yeah, tell me all about this appreciation.” Tony says, suddenly so very over his offense when Steve tugs the plush away and hoists him up into his lap by the backs of his thighs.
“We are not having this conversation right now, I have a Hammer to roast over an open fire.”
“Steve, hey, thought I’d let you know I’m having some stuff delivered to you, there was a warehouse, and,” he trailed off, as Steve stood to put his shoes in the shoe rack by his bed, “what,” he said. When Steve looked up, he had a hand splayed over his heart. His eyes were wide.
“Um, yes wow, so very on-board with your hands on my ass. God your hands are really big, I could just let you fondle me all day.” Tony might be babbling a little bit, but how could he not? Tony groans, combing his fingers through Steve's hair.
“Want you to kiss me after.” Steve sounds fond and amused as he settles the dental dam in place. Tony doesn't really have a moment to contemplate that before Steve is there again-licking and pressing his tongue into the relaxed clench of his hole through the barrier of latex. It's the most indecent kiss Tony has ever had in his life. Even through the dam it feels wet, hot, Steve's tongue licking around his rim and then pushing in, and Tony is gasping, writhing, being held fast by Steve's hands on his ass. Steve's hands holding him open, Steve's mouth sending chills up his spine and making his cock leak precome against the pillow so copiously Tony just knows that pillowcase is a lost cause.
“I like the ones with my name across your behind more, but these are nice too.” Steve says, grinning at the mock scandalized gasp this earns from Tony.
“Hey boss, where are we goin?” Happy pipes up from where he's leaning against one of Tony's more understated cars. A sleek black Jag with an extended wheelbase that Steve has ogled on more than one occasion.
“Come on, honey,”  Tony says, working himself over Steve's cock so perfectly Steve shouts “come on, leave me wet inside, you're so deep in me now aren't you-so deep I'll taste it when you come won't I, big guy?”  The words lodge in his mind, make him gasp and cry out just with the knowledge that he's going to come inside Tony, and that Tony wants that from him. It's so much, the breath is caught in his chest, everything is so bright and hot and shivering with pleasure.  He's not even truly aware of what he's doing anymore, the sounds he's making, only conscious of hanging onto the bed, keeping himself from tearing out of the sash around his wrist, and kissing Tony back when he leans down to lick into his mouth while Steve comes and comes and comes.
Time passed on almost uneventfully after that.  Steve split his time as he always had, winter came and went, leaving behind a cough and a wheeze in his lungs that wouldn’t quit.  Hunger seemed to be there almost constantly, but the De Rossis insisted he come eat with them at least twice a week.  Times were rough, but Steve felt he was a lucky man, after all there were people who didn’t even have an apartment to come home to, or anyone to offer them a hug after a long crummy day.
“Is it that so?” Tony laughs, the gravity from before melting away as Steve produces his big yellow prize from inside the bag he set down by the door.
“Yesterday I ah...helped Mister Stark to bed and I noticed something.”
“I do, I want it, but you're worried, I know, about being yourself.”  Tony says affectionately, draping his arms over Steve's shoulders and leaning in to buss his cheek with a kiss.  “You worry about your strength I know, so just let me take care of you, darling, let me do all the work. I want to.  You know how I love
“Well then you're slacking, you should just come up with names for me in retaliation.”  Tony's eyes glitter with mirth, and just a little bit of challenge.  Steve's never been one to back down, and today is no different.
? Are you saying-” Tony jabs his finger in the air. “that you approve of your creator's uhhh” What is Steve to him now?
“Don't talk to him before coffee, he's not human.” Clint adds from where he's picking at his nails with an arrow.
“You're all mine huh?” Steve says, low, but immeasurably fondly.
"Yessir."  He says, dutifully letting Tony move his hands around on the piano, letting him position his fingers to his liking along the white keys. Steve watches his face. Hazy moonlight makes his features look soft, catching on the bright gleam of his eyes as he slips his hands beneath Steve's so that he can mirror everything Tony does.
in some distant part of his mind before he's on his knees retching with such force that his vision grays around the edges.
sight a few times.” Tony says, indicating the round swell of his behind-wiggling it for good measure-and well, who is Steve to refuse such an obvious invitation?
“Maybe I do, maybe I just want you to cart me around.” Tony murmurs, pressing his face against Steve's stomach, inhaling the fresh scent of laundry detergent and old fashioned cologne. He can worry about his dignity later. Dignity is overrated anyway.
“Follow my lead Cap. I know you're used to calling the shots, but trust me on this.”
, he wants to say,
“What, I know you said no fish-man jokes but c’mon.”  Hawkeye held his arms out to the sky in mock supplication.  Iron man just sighed.
touching him, it feels like a revelation, pleasure spiraling up through his body, leaving him feeling as if he might melt right into Steve's arms, his body unable to hold itself up as Steve makes him gasp and his thighs shake.
Dutifully the rest of the non-fliers trickle into the jet, buckling themselves in and chattering away about their victory. In the reflective glass of the windshield the Widow's eyes meet his curiously, but she says nothing. Beside him Wasp has buckled in despite being flight capable. She smiles brightly at him as they take off.
“Will do, JARVIS, you heard the man.”
“Tones I don't want to leave but I'm actually supposed to be in Washington right now, I'll be around again though, I promise.” Tony feels like a promise from Rhodey is probably the kind people can take to the grave.
“Nay, Captain, I only wished to invite you to share a cask of fine Asgardian mead with me while we soaked in one of Anthony's pools, but I see you are otherwise occupied."  Thor gestures down to Tony in his arms.  As surreally appealing as mead and a hot soak with Thor sounds, some part of him suspects he'll be drunk as a skunk by the end of the night, and that's not really on his agenda at the moment.  He can't deny it sounds pretty tempting though.
getting chilly.
“Pacific Rim reference? I like it. Have we watched that together?” Tony wonders idly. “But okay, doing as you asked, no boogie boarding or rabbit chasing, can do Steve.”
“I also said I wanted to feed the strawberries to my steady, we gonna get to do that?”  Steve asks. Tony’s eyes darken slightly, he comes closer, setting the bowls down on the table and then insinuating himself into Steve’s lap.
“There's a Clint's Sexy Cupid Montage number one?” Tony asks, momentarily distracted from his Steve induced existential woes. JARVIS doesn't answer, merely projecting Clint's home movie project across the wall in living color. Tony feels his face twist in horror. That's a lot of Clint. “JARVIS I'm going to sleep, shut that off oh my
“Oh I do know that, but this is about us working as a team, and camping like this can be pretty relaxing too don't you think?” Steve pauses for effect, putting on his most sincere 'trust me' expression.  “Besides, I miss camping like this, low tech and easy. C'mon do an old soldier a solid?” Maybe the sad expression on his own face is overkill, but it seems to work. Tony sags against him-laying his head on Steve's shoulder, nosing against the side of Steve's neck. Clint is muttering 'oh my god' repeatedly beneath his breath. Steve agrees.
Tony throws his hand out, snagging the pot of minty ointment from the side table frantically. It's cool to the touch, numbing his fingers even as he shoves a hand under his sweatshirt to rub the stuff all over his bruises. The effect is immediate, some of the pain and tenderness eases, allowing him to sit up fully again. It doesn't do much for the deep bruising, but it's just enough relief to avoid the heavy pain medication he loathes so much. Being out of it used to be a goal, now it's a liability.
“Don't have to prep me more darling, you can push right in, I'm aching for you,
“You keepin' her then, settling in and adopting kids so fast?” Bucky asks as Tony rises up to stand.
.” Tony repeats, softer now. His name said in that tone of voice is enough to cause goosebumps. Desire pools in his gut, hot and heady when Tony's lips part, head angling so their noses won't bump. Everything about his posture screams
“Cap. I can't. I can't even imagine what this is like for you, I just-” Iron Man sucks in a tinny hissing breath, slumping slightly in his armor.  “I'm probably really not the best person for this, I can get someone else, someone better?'
“I'm...gonna go.” Tony chokes out, pulling his phone out to give Happy their current location with a few quick words.
“Nope, not getting into it, but anyway, I want to see you do a triple axle.”
not part of this whole scenario.
“What?”  He said, looking around quickly to see if there was an easy way to get around the car if he needed to.  Maybe he could climb a fire escape.  “Whaddya want from me?”
“Really?” Steve actually sounds surprised, like Tony isn't the surest thing on the damn planet right now. He's looking at Tony like he's not a colossal fuck-up. Like Tony's the best thing that ever happened to him. He's looking at Tony like he hung the moon in the sky, and wow, does Tony not know what to do with that.
The chocolates are delicious. Tony shares them with everyone present while perched atop Steve. The bright smile on his face doesn't fade even through the occasional sneeze. Watching him thumb wrestle Bruce for the mint truffle, Steve can't think of anywhere he'd rather be.
fitted to me you wouldn't be able to concentrate. You would be blinded by my gorgeous metal
This was bad. If Tony touched him, surely he’d know. He must have felt it, maybe that was why he was so intent on Steve getting that VA appointment. Sure he seemed to like Steve, respect him, and he was always kind, sweet, generous as the day was long. That didn’t mean he felt the same. Still, his gift had been accepted. Steve pushed that thought away, it didn’t count. Tony had no way of knowing that was a courting gift. He’d looked so sweet though, holding them against his body, soft around the eyes and mouth, like he would have welcomed Steve’s touch. Steve closed his eyes, willing his body to calm down. He didn’t need to change his sheets twice in one day.
“Hey,”  he said, gathering his courage as five pairs of eyes turned to fix on him, “you guys live around here?”
Steve snorts, stepping closer, hands still behind his back. The broad line of his shoulders hides the bouquet, but Steve knows it's there just ready to either make things very good or exceedingly awkward depending on how this goes.
“Did he...did he try something with you?” Steve asks.  His imagination is running wild with possibilities, unspeakable things Tiberius Stone might have tried to do to the man he loves.  Tony's eyes snap to his, their gazes lock. It feels like they're trapped like that for hours, but it's only a moment before Tony is shaking his head, waving his hand in a placating gesture.
does he want, but that's not how he wants this to happen. He doesn't want Tony to get the wrong idea, and he thinks maybe Tony is good at that-getting the wrong idea that is. Steve doesn't want Tony to ever feel used, not unless he wants to be. Maybe Tony will think Steve's old fashioned at heart, he wants their first time together to be planned-wants to make sure Tony knows he won't just leave after-that he's not just after a roll in the hay. There's a lot of stuff out there on the internet. Nasty things printed up about Tony pop up all the time. Old pictures of him with a woman or a man on each arm and a drink in each hand. They belittle his genius, make light of his struggles, but Steve knows a performance when he sees one, and Steve wants
He wanted to walk out into the living room, he knew Jan and the others were slated to watch a movie that night.  He wanted to join them, but he wasn’t in any fit kind of shape to be good company that night.  He was far too exhausted, far too raw to make conversation or even pay attention to the movie picture.  The plush was warm against his side, he clutched it closer, shut his eyes and tried to do the breathing exercises he learned during the war.  His heart was still pounding, but at last he drifted off into a fitful, uneasy sleep.
Tony has nightmares too, but he's secretive about it. At first Steve thinks it's because of how private the man can be, but then he realizes it's something deeper, something darker. Tony apologizes the first time Steve wakes him from one-body thrashing as if he has a live wire beneath his skin while he clutches at his chest, at the arc reactor. He's paper white, drenched in sweat, eyes wide and staring, and when Steve touches him he flinches away, curls around himself protectively. It takes almost ten minutes to bring him around.
“Can we have it for breakfast too?”  Steve goes for another piece of fruit to illustrate just how much he’s enjoying his idea.  Tony kisses him afterwards, slow and lingering.
“We could blindfold him, just in case.” Clint says, jogging over to pass Tony a bag full of apples. Tony drops them, hands clutching at nothing. The breath freezes in his lungs. Muscle memory, old panic. He doesn't know
“Are you sick?” He asks, stepping in front of Tony to press the palm of his hand over his forehead.
“None taken.” Steve laughs, but he does reclaim Tony from Thor's enthusiastic bridal carry.
“Muscle-iest then.” He offers, eyes sparkling playfully.  Steve chuckles, rubbing his thumb over Tony's jaw.
“It's perfect, it's...wow. You really made this for me? The bells and whistles are great. It's perfect. Thank you Tony.” He lets gratitude color the words, not trying to downplay the importance of this gift for even a second.  Tony seems to almost sag with relief before he schools that away, grinning brightly and pulling the uniform down from his wiggling robot.
The kitchen was just as huge and futuristic as everything in the mansion other his own room seemed to be.  Tony sat nearby on the kitchen counter while Steve spooned soup into his mouth.  It was hot, fresh, the pot of it still steaming on the stove.  There were chunks of chicken in it, a wide variety of vegetables that couldn’t possibly all be in season, fresh pasta, and a host of spices that made it taste like it belonged in a restaurant.  While he watched, Tony unwrapped a sleeve of crackers, and leaned over the counter to scoot them by Steve’s hand.
“Right of course, and by the way, I still can't believe you didn't invite me to the wedding.” Pepper says without missing a beat.
They're almost finished with breakfast when the beeping of Steve's Avengers communicator starts going off. Steve groans, but he's all business, whipping out his wallet to toss cash on the table. Tony almost protests and offers to pay himself, but Steve is already moving. Tony follows him out into the parking space where Steve kisses him, pressing him up against Steve's motorcycle until the quinjet lands in the street.
Tony comes with something near to a scream, fingers yanking at the covers so hard Steve swears he hears something tear. That thought is wiped away by the way Tony spasms around him, his orgasm making him shiver uncontrollably inside and outside. Steve pushes in once, twice, through that clinging heat, before he loses the battle with his own will, and he's coming, dropping his head down to seal his mouth over Tony's as his hips give a few last stuttering thrusts. They lay there, utterly spent for how long he has no idea, but It's Tony shifting around in obvious discomfort that finally inspires him to move.
“Are you sure? Are you really sure that's what you want?”
“La petite mort, I can get behind it.” Steve pants, shocking Tony entirely by reaching between their bodies' to cup Tony through his pants with one hand.
“There has been a break in at your Seattle facility sir, you have instructed me to inform you first, as the facility contains classified projects. Would you like me to raise the alarm with the Avengers?” Jarvis asks crisply. Tony shakes his head, tiredness draining away into battle readiness as he presses his fingers to the bracelet around his wrist, calling the armor to him from its hiding spot beneath the floor of the lab. As it closes around him, he takes a deep breath, willing the pounding of his heart to stabilize.
The fingers leave him, and then Steve is lifting him, slipping a pillow beneath his hips, letting him settle down upon it. He kisses over Tony's back, trails his hands over the muscles he finds there, testing, feeling for tension. There is none. Tony is warm and relaxed beneath him, although almost painfully aroused. Against the pillow, his cock is hard and hot, but it's a distant sort of thing, hazy and sticky sweet pleasure racing down his spine when Steve replaces his deep massaging touches with kisses that trace paths over his shoulders, the jut of his scapulae, then lower and lower, until he's swirling his tongue in the divots just above Tony's ass, hands around the backs of Tony's thighs, tight to hold him there so he doesn't squirm.
right, and wow. Wow. Tony would like to write a letter of thanks to the committee responsible for passing out anatomy.
We're near the end here everyone!  Next chapter is the big breakthrough for  our poor beleaguered Steve-depending on interest I might write an epilogue to this.  As ever, your comments bring me more joy than a sack of gold bars and sugar cookies.
“Pepper.” Tony groans,  “Pepper you're not my PA anymore why are you doing this to yourself?” Pepper just huffs, watching Mister Stark with something like concern.
me?” The incredulity in his voice only seems to amuse Steve more.
“Tony.” Steve half groans, trailing a searing line of kisses over his jaw, down his neck. “Tony I-I-” His voice skips as Tony rocks up against him. It feels incredible, Steve kissing him, Steve running his hands all over him, brushing his hair away from his face and tugging his bottom lip between his teeth. Tony slips his hands over broad shoulders, feeling the flex of powerful back muscles as Steve moves against him, and it's good, it's so,
Do not devalue yourself because you're one of the best people I've ever met. If you think I'd be alright if you died while I stood by and did nothing you've got another thing coming. So get that through your hollow bucket head.” Maybe he ought to tone it down, but he can't.  Not when his best friend in this world is talking about himself like that.  Iron Man's breath catches, the arm he has around Steve tightening enough to be felt clearly through the padding of his suit.
