Okay, this chapter contains explicit sexual content. 😏
Tony shook his head as he heard the bedroom door close, but he refused to turn around. He was so angry with himself and Steve that he couldn’t even articulate a coherent thought.
Steve stood in place as he watched Tony walk toward their lab, puzzled by the suggestive tone in Tony's voice.
Tony grimaced, completely surprised by Steve’s change in tone. “Well,” Tony forced his face to relax, “I shouldn’t have taken this out on you…”
Steve stepped toward the conference table. “This can’t be what we use Synergy for.”
“I’ve never said
“Right away, Mr. Parker.” J.A.R.V.I.S. answered as the computer took half a millisecond to complete the request.
“Nice. I can’t believe Riri managed to find more material from my dad’s archives…” Tony mostly said to himself, “it looks like she stayed up late, though. This email is from 3am…”
be serious, Rogers.”
“Barton. Please. You’re interrupting important business.” Tony sighed as he put his hands on his hips. Clint huffed instead of verbally responding as he walked over to one of the consoles.
Tony grinned. “What? Like, concocting a lie to tell our kid to keep the peace?”
Tony could barely listen to Obadiah ramble on about essentially nothing. He contributed from time to time when prompted, telling himself that remaining calm would be the only way to deal with Obadiah until they figured out what to do with Synergy.
Steve knew the answer, but only nodded as he let Tony respond; he was still too nervous about answering questions, afraid he would say the wrong thing and/or look ridiculous doing so.
to dinner.” Tony pulled out his wallet as he intercepted Steve.
“Me too, Steve.”
After reading Steve's letter a few more times, Tony finally convinced himself that maybe he should try to calmly talk to Steve in person and just let him say what he had written out loud.
“Steve, no, of course not. I’m just letting you know what you might be getting into, that’s all.”
“I just wanted to say a few things before I give Steve
Steve chose not to follow him; he wasn’t sure what to say. He had thought that last night had meant something more, but it appeared that Tony thought it meant something else. Also, Steve’s own intentions confused him; he wanted Tony in his life, and he cared about him so much. He wasn’t sure why he had told Tony he wanted to be friends.
Tony nodded. “What do I jam the core with?”
Bruce’s mouth bobbed opened once or twice before he took the hint, backing away slowly as he mouthed the word “okay” with his hands up in a halting position.
“Jesus fucking Christ…” Tony said out loud, rubbing his chest, thinking about every inch of his body Steve had either touched or licked.
“We broke up about a year ago. She was my last serious relationship. She was around when I adopted Peter, so they know each other pretty well. I’m actually surprised we’re on good terms now.”
“Okay, what’s next, Tony?” Steve turned slightly to face Tony who was now slumped to the side, but still awake despite the amount of blood he had lost from the blast.
Steve rolled his eyes as he crossed his arms. “I’m fine now, Tony. I was just getting used to being out of the bed on my own…you know that…”
Sam shook his head as he patted Steve on the back again. “Steve, it’s okay. I’m glad I have you guys here to support me. It means a lot. Also, I don’t mind giving you relationship advice.” He winked at Steve.
“…I never got the closure I wanted and I’m trying to deal with it in my own way, if that makes sense…?
Tony nodded once before turning to head further into his home. Steve followed, remarking to himself that this would be the first time he would see more of Tony’s place. As Tony entered his kitchen, Steve waited at the threshold to the space. He watched Tony walk to the island in the middle of the kitchen, opening a bottle with something brown in it before pouring himself a glass. Steve walked up to the counter, placing his hands on the edge.
Tony thought to himself.
“Okay,” Tony said through one last kiss, “turn over on your other side.”
Steve nodded wordlessly as he grabbed his bag, letting Tony walk ahead of him. They walked down the driveway until they were a few feet away from the house. As they approached, Steve couldn’t stop staring at the design of the house; it looked like something on the cover of an architecture magazine.
“…I’m so hard for you, baby…” Tony reached downward with one hand to rub both himself and Steve together. Steve gasped as soon as Tony’s hand griped his hard cock while he rubbed his hands along Tony’s backside.
Haha, well I should go to bed! Night!
Steve paused before nodding. Tony nodded back again, forgetting for about half a second the weird tension between them.
“Don’t worry about it, okay? It’s more hilarious than anything else.” Tony grinned before motioning toward the device on the table. Steve nodded as if he understood the sentence and the gesture.
Tony waited before sniffing his shirt. “Eh, I’ve been worse.”
Tony turned his head again to stare at Rhodey. That could have been the case; Steve wasn’t really himself after he drank a few glasses of Thor’s Jörmungandr—actually, Tony remembered that Steve hadn’t appeared drunk until after glass four or five, while everyone else had been hammered after the second or third. But Tony was fixated on his own actions. He had come to accept that if he had cut them off in the elevator, Steve would have stayed. Now Steve probably thought that all Tony wanted from him was just sex.
“Apparently there are some unfortunate company politics going on at Stark Industries. One of the people who hired me, Obadiah Stane, is giving Tony a hard time. I don’t know more than that obviously, but I can tell it’s really bothering Tony.”
Earlier that night, Tony had stayed in his office for some time before Rhodey found him. Tony reluctantly explained what was going on and Rhodey managed to convince him to put on a brave face and come out to the party. Tony avoided Steve as much as possible before he left earlier than he had expected, but Tony was relieved that he had; he knew he would end up saying something else that would ruin the entire party.
Bucky sighed. He looked past Sam through the room before looking downward. “Ugh…I’m going to sound so stupid saying this…”
“So, I know this is super last minute, but…” Tony fumbled a bit before continuing, “…I have to go to a house my folks used to own out in the Hamptons this weekend…I probably should have told you about it, now that I think about it…”
“Steve, Jesus. Just go for it. What do you have to lose?”
Tony nodded back slowly, his expression still somewhat solemn as Steve smiled at him before pulling him to lie back down on his body. Tony moaned as he began humping Steve again, feeling Steve along his chest before holding onto him tightly. Steve breathed heavily as he sped up his motions against Tony, now holding onto Tony’s ass.
Tony kept grinning as squiggled on top of Steve. “I’ll only let you do it if you say it.”
“You mean what, Cap?” Sam look genuinely concerned.
Tony could see Steve smiling at him out of the corner of his eye. Although he was trying to get off the campus as quickly as possible to celebrate with Steve, Tony couldn’t pass up such a polite request.
“Uh…are you asking me to go to this thing with you before the wedding…?” Tony finally answered back.
“Sorry, uh,
Bruce grimaced, evidently not convinced. “…how are things with Steve?”
“Sir., Mr. Parker is set to arrive soon.” J.A.R.V.I.S. interrupted.
“Sure. I’ll get dressed.”
Tony stuck his hand out, knocking Tiberius’s drink out of his hand. “Ty, back the
“Buck!” Steve shook his head as he sat up straight in his chair again.
Tony scoffed before walking ahead of Steve to follow Sam and Bucky.
“Good afternoon, Sir.” J.A.R.V.I.S. greeted, causing Steve to turn around to acknowledge Tony.
Natasha grinned. “I guess Fury made the right choice pairing you two up.” She smiled as she leaned further onto the table.
Although a little annoyed that he couldn’t seem to keep his mouth shut, Tony mused. He
Steve took his time responding, telling himself he could finally take his time. He smiled at Tony who smiled back.
Both Tony and Bruce waited patiently for Shuri to offer her opinion on the second iteration of the Synergy device, which had been reconstructed over the past month. The two men stood a bit away from Shuri as she tinkered with the device at a table in Tony’s lab, humming quietly to herself as she worked.
“My friends, this is quite the glorious endeavor!” Thor rubbed his hands together.
The other end of the receiver went completely silent, so silent that Tony feared that Steve had hung up on him.
Sam waited for Steve to continue. He had to have done something else after the party because now Tony was reconsidering how he treated him.
“It’ll be great to see Peter again. I miss him.” Steve smiled before turning back to the table.
Tony exhaled with relief, but just enough to himself to not cause a scene. “Thanks, Banner. I really appreciate it.”
Something out of the corner of Shuri’s eye caught her attention. She crouched down near an object, taking a moment before realizing what she had discovered.
Steve shook his head. “Tony—”
“J.A.R.V.I.S.,” Tony shifted his mental energy into work, “could you give me a rundown of my schedule for the next few weeks, please?” He leaned backward in his chair, clicking a pen as he swiveled from side to side.
The more he thought about Steve, the more agitated he became. Tony shot up from his desk and headed for the door, thinking it would probably be better to let off some steam in the lab then moping over Steve all day.
Once they reached the hotel, Tony remained just as quiet as he had been in the car. He could sense that Steve had picked up on but chose to remain silent as well in order to give him some space. They rode the elevator up to their floor, still silent, neither one really filling the void until they reached their room. Steve let Tony enter first who walked to the opposite side of the room, his back facing Steve who lingered near the door before walking further into the room.
“…but don’t despair, Anthony, your father had trouble with this damn project from the start—” Obadiah motioned toward Pepper and one of the female board members sitting closest to him, “forgive my language, ladies.”
“Tony?” Tony heard Steve call from behind.
Tony hummed back before quickening his pace along Steve’s cock, working with one hand and his mouth. Steve bucked upward slowly into Tony’s mouth until they were both in a good rhythm with each other. Tony kept going until Steve let out a muted cry, exhaling deeply as he came into Tony’s mouth. Tony waited before using his tongue to slide up Steve’s cock.
“Sam’s in his room on the phone with T’Challa talking about some last-minute ceremony things.” Bucky explained as he sat down at the table.
“Okay…” Tony started, “everything is more or less in the same order as it was before. I wanted to also make sure that the suits were able to play music with this current setup because that’s the most important feature.” He grinned at Steve.
Tony took a sip out of his water glass before taking the device back from Steve. “It’ll last for only twelve
Steve nodded before turning to exit the kitchen. “Thanks.” As he left, he could feel Sam and Bucky staring at him. But he didn’t care. He knew what he was doing and having Tony at the party was what he wanted.
Tony lifted the fingerprint scanner in the elevator to take him to the penthouse. He could feel his heart sink as the elevator carried him floor by floor.
“Okay, so now that everyone knows what to do in the interim, outside of this damn promotional tour, let’s try to keep a low profile. I don’t want to get back on the board’s radar unless we’ve saved some people from a burning building or stopped a bullet or whatever.” Tony waved a hand about as he concluded.
As soon as Tony walked into the main space of Stark Enterprises, he saw Steve chatting with Thor next to a cluster of consoles. Tony clammed up at the entrance, forgetting all that encouragement he had given himself earlier. He stood paralyzed, staring at Steve for some time.
Tony shrugged. “What can you do?” He was smiling which made Steve smile a little, although he still felt weird. He had to come to terms with the fact that he’d have to spend a good deal of the morning and most likely the rest of the weekend trying to convince Sam that he hadn’t gone that far with Tony.
“Hold him down.” Thor said to Steve as he let go of Loki to get to the trunk of his car. He pulled out two sets of jumper cables.
Tony looked at Natasha before giving Pepper the envelope. Pepper looked through the files as Tony leaned back in his chair, visibly upset by the new information.
Tony nodded at her as he straightened himself out. “Okay, showtime.” He winked at Steve before jogging out onto the stage to an uproarious round of applause.
Both Steve and Tony waited behind the wings of the stage; Tony was chatting with a couple backstage employees, while Steve stood silently, looking around awkwardly as the backstage people whirled around him trying to ensure that the projections of the device worked properly.
Steve laughed as he kissed Tony once more. They held onto each other, squeezing the other tightly as their hands roamed along each other’s bodies.
Steve shook his head empathically. “No, Tony. I’m fine. I promise…just a little nervous, that’s all…”
Steve sighed before he looked directly at Tony then the device. He smiled, albeit reservedly, before reaching out for the device.
Steve shoveled out the last sentence as quickly as possible, basically physically preventing himself from hiding underneath the nearest table.
Steve took his time approaching Tony, glancing toward the glass façade to make sure no one was walking past. As soon as he reached Tony, Steve rubbed his arms.
Steve shrugged. “A lot to take in, but great nonetheless.”
It was Monday and Steve had managed to rally up enough courage to tell Tony about Obadiah accusing them of some illicit affair.
“Okay, what’s the deal?”
“Uh, everything all right?” Steve looked up to see that Bruce had been watching him closely.
“Do you think this will ruin our chances for the state-wide competition?” Ned asked Peter as he cowered behind his friend.
Tony placed a hand on Steve’s shoulder; something about it felt different from all the other times. It was flirty, but Steve was sure he could feel something beyond it.
The ceremony progressed with a mixture of certain Wakandan rituals. Tony struggled keeping his eyes on Sam and Shuri; out of the corner of his eye, he could see Steve standing off to the side next to Bucky.
“I need to speak with you…” She whispered.
“Wait. Let me drive you home at least…” Tony offered quietly.
Steve backed away from the couch as Tony stood up. Tony walked toward him, but Steve kept backing away.
“Steve, you deserve better than me. You could do better than me. I've fucked up every serious relationship in my entire life and I’m only going to ruin this one.” Tony turned around slowly as he explained, resting his hands on his hips, but opted to look directly at the floor before summing up enough courage to face Steve again.
Tony eyed Obadiah before checking his wristwatch. "Where's Pepper?"
Tony chuckled. “Fashionably late. Not I-don’t-have-my-shit-together late. There’s a
Tony nodded quickly again as he waved his hands around. “Yep! You’re totally right!”
Tony stared at Steve before laughing loudly. Steve laid down next to him, his face turning red as Tony turned to face him, still laughing.
“Bruce, I’m restricting you to a closed channel.” Tony switched the channel to a private one. He managed to close it to everyone else, but because Tony had J.A.R.V.I.S. sync the mini teams to each other’s earpiece, Steve was still on the channel.
“…and I thank my lucky stars that you are who you are…” Bruce started singing along with Tony, but way too loudly. Natasha nudged him in the arm to take it easy, smiling as she got him to sway with her to the music.
Tony peeked upward at Steve, trying not to look too shook by Steve basically telling him he would like to see his vacation house someday.
“There,” Tony patted Steve on the leg, “it’s all better now.”
“Tony! I think it worked!” Steve shouted, turning behind himself to look at Tony.
But Steve laughed anyway as he waited for Tony to walk past him and into the kitchen, following closely behind.
Steve waited for the bathroom door to close, lying back down on the bed to face the ceiling. He was still enraptured by the euphoria from last night that he didn’t think twice before hopping off the bed to walk to the bathroom.
“Okay!” Tony clapped his hands together to address Bruce and Shuri again, “let’s haul the items we're keeping to Banner’s lab.”
“…I really appreciate that, Rogers…” Tony finally offered with a sincere smile, although it was a little weak.
in the hospital.” Clint grimaced as he rubbed his shoulder.
“Tony!” Steve shouted as he ran over to Tony.
Steve eyed both Tony and Peter before sighing heavily as he placed his hands on hips. “This isn’t funny, you two. Has this been happening when I’m not here?”
Tony laughed to himself, although his tone was worn. He placed his hand on his hips. “Well you know how I usually operate when I have something on my mind.” He attempted to joke.
Tony waved Steve off. “Rogers, I screwed up. I should have told you—the team about the failsafe.”
Tony smiled as he heard Steve laugh from his shameless flirting. “Uh, an undershirt and boxers.”
Steve nodded back, taking a moment before following Tony into the bedroom. He looked around the space: Tony had his suitcase wide open on the floor and the bed was covered with clothes and a tablet.
“Maybe he can give me a lesson on how to use technology.”
“Mr. Rogers, we have the pleasure to inform you…” As Sam began reading the letter out loud, Steve lost himself within his thoughts; his mind drifted back to that final interview with Tony.
He turned away from Natasha as he leaned up against a table. “…I didn’t know how dangerous this was going to become…,” he inhaled before continuing, “…I was trying to go about this as safely as possible…”
Tony shook Lupho’s hand before turning toward Steve. “Yes, and this is my husband.” He said with an crafty grin.
Tony grinned widely. “Thanks for the confidence, Obie. You’re a real one.” He smirked with a wink, his tone dripping with sarcasm.
Tony chuckled heartily. “Oh, you have
Obadiah flinched, but Pepper’s expression never wavered. He then looked past her to see Agent Coulson standing off to the side, waving at him with a slight grin on his face. Obadiah then turned to look at the press pool again, smiling weakly, before turning back to face Pepper. Pepper was still staring him down, indicating that he really had no choice. He coughed, trying to regain enough composure to readdress the press pool.
“If you don’t, I’m going to have to get S.H.I.E.L.D. involved.” Natasha added firmly.
“Who wants a snack?”
“…Tony…did you…have you a nightmare?” Steve asked quietly and with caution.
“Nope. Even though I would love to tell you I told you so, I’m sure bruising that pretty face of yours because you’re stubborn is more than a blow to your ego.” He grinned at Steve before turning around to retrieve a first-aid kit from the bathroom.
Tony chuckled as he shuffled around to face Steve who was clenching his chest from being surprised by J.A.R.V.I.S.’s presence.
Peter and Tony army crawled out from underneath the robot before running to the console to watch the sequence again. As soon as the computer finished with the numbers, both Tony and Peter hi-fived each other before running back over toward the robot. Tony pulled out a device from his back pocket, handing it to Peter. Peter accepted it before tapping on the gadget a few times. After a second or two, the robot began to flicker with a hodgepodge of colors before rising from its restraints.
Sam nodded. “Sounds good to me! Tony can you join?”
“Let me just get you up to the penthouse, okay? You can pass out in one of the spare rooms.” Tony whispered with his own goofy smile as he felt Steve nestled his head on his shoulder.
Obadiah waved with a fake smile as he listened to his caller. “…it’s a minor setback. If we get the device, then we’ll be able to move forward…besides—” At this point, a Stark Industries’ investor had past Obadiah on his way into the building. Obadiah paused to acknowledge the man.
The technician nodded as she turned around to find Steve’s prescription. Steve eagerly waited at the counter, looking behind himself, hoping Bucky stayed near the front of the store.
Steve sighed heavily before looking somewhat downward at Tony. He looked away before looking back at him again, seemingly struggling with the proposal.
As soon as the ringing ceased, Tony’s breath hitched. “Hi, Tony.” Tony could hear the weary tone in Steve’s voice as he answered.
Sharon nodded slowly before reaching out a hand toward Steve. Steve stared at her hand before letting her take a hold of his.
“Until tomorrow night. It’s only been a week, but I feel like I haven’t seen him in ages.” Tony answered.
Bruce shrugged as he looked at Fury. Fury expressed his usual cool demeanor, but it was obvious to Bruce that he was pretending to be clueless about the lab access codes.
Clint took his time approaching Steve and Tony. “Uh,” he shuffled around a bit, looking incredibly uncomfortable, “I think you guys look great together, by the way…” He offered awkwardly before spinning around to sprint off in the opposite direction.
international debacle.”
Steve looked around, waiting for Tony to walk him further into the penthouse, but Tony just looked past him expecting to see Sharon waiting in the elevator.
Agent Hill tapped on a console before stepping to the side to let Fury inspect the projection.
Steve struggled to sit up in the bed, but then he gave up. “It’s probably because I’ve been lying in this bed for days. I really just want to go on a run…”
“Steve,” Tony slowly pushed Steve away so that he could look at him, “…I’m…not a good person…” He let out quietly, turning his face to the side.
“I forgot; I’m having dinner with Pepper this weekend…” To Steve, Tony looked apprehensive again, “…but we can do something during the day, and I suppose I’ll see you after dinner.” He concluded with a grin.
Tony shrugged. “I thought you wanted me out of the lab, besides this isn’t work, it’s the boys’ project.”
Tony managed to look over at Steve who was standing with his hands rested on his hips.
“God, Tony…” Steve breathed as he gripped Tony by the waist, pushing downward into his body.
“Jutenheim has an excellent kitchen! You should try it next time you crash a party here!” He shouted with glee before running into something that felt like a solid brick wall. Loki bounced off the obstacle, falling backward onto his backside. He sat up, rubbing the back of his head, looking upward to see that Thor had blocked his path.
Steve walked over to the table Tony had assigned to him yesterday. He pulled out his sketchbook and notepad.
Tony glanced downward at him before sinking lower into the bed. “What’s up?”
And like that, the end of the month finally arrived, and Steve and Sam were on their way to the Stark Industries board event.
down, Stane.”
“I’m sure there are better ways to pay me a compliment.” Steve returned to massaging Tony’s shoulders.
Tony held up his hands to get Steve to calm down. He was still unsure of the explosive’s sensitivity.
Tony walked into the living room before crouching down near Steve. “Oh, that looks like my mother’s jewelry box…” He said quietly as Steve handed him the box.
, Rogers. You’re fast.” Tony smirked as he felt Steve near him. To Steve, it appeared as if Tony was joking, but the joke had an unmistakable edge to it. He told himself he would need to get use to the man’s personality in order to survive working in a lab together.
“I’ll have a nurse send in the discharge papers. You’re very lucky, Mr. Rogers.” Strange carefully patted Steve on the shoulder before quickly rushing out of the room to get to another patient.
Tony froze. “Uh, well…he’s fine…” He turned around away from the console to see that Steve was looking at him.
Tony nodded again, this time with a shining smile, as he reached around to pat Rhodey on the back.
Steve nodded back as he waited before taking his own mug, smiling at Tony enjoying himself.
“You know what’s great about the device? Its super lightweight, yet durable. That’ll be great once we’re on the ground, don’t you think, Tony?”
Peter looked to be seriously considering the idea. “That would make it easier for breakfast.” He concluded.
Something about Sam’s last comment made Tony feel emotional again, just as emotional the day he broke up with Steve. He nodded, not really sure what to add.
Tony exhaled deeply. “It…self-destructs the device in case it's compromised.
Peter nodded slowly, clearly put off by Tony’s tone. Tony took in a deep breath as he approached the bed to sit on the edge of it.
Tony looked at Bruce, grinning slightly before answering. “But what? There’s more we can do, isn’t there?”
Steve pulled back to look at Tony, rolling his eyes in the process. “I know that, Tony.” He leaned inward to kiss him, lingering for a bit as everyone around them cheered on.
“I’m sure there was a better way to do that, Tony.” Steve added as they ran through the hallway.
“You got in! I told you!” Sam handed him the letter as he slapped him on the back.
Obadiah stared at Tony, cracking a slight smile before walking toward the door. He walked past Tony before turning somewhat. They glared at each other before Obadiah patted Tony on the shoulder, keeping his hand in place as he looked at Tony intently.
He could sense Bruce was unwilling to give up on the whole Steve thing, especially since Tony gave him such a hard time about Natasha last night.
Fury sighed as he hung his head low before peeking upward at the team. Some shuffled around uncomfortably.
“Roosevelt Island.” Thanos started as he backed away from Obadiah, “I need you to take the weapon there for the tech conference.”
my boss.” Tony interjected. He had never felt so insulted in his entire life.
Shuri shrugged. “Anything you can find. It’s not perfect, but it’ll help.”
Tony took a moment before commenting; it felt as if Steve had been dancing for years.
After giving the presentation a few times over the past couple weeks, Steve and Tony had figured out a narrative that had a solid structure but could be easily rifted upon. And Steve, quite surprised with how comfortable he was beginning to feel, found himself improvising more than usual.
Steve laughed before kissing Tony again, taking his hand as he walked toward the entrance of the balcony. They walked back into the loft, saying goodbye to everyone before waiting for Happy to drive them back to the Tower.
“A dream!” Sam shouted through wild laughter.
Tony sneered.
Steve laughed before pointing to the other figures in the drawing. “And who are these two?”
“J.A.R.V.I.S., save the last diagnostic test. I want to show it to Banner tomorrow.”
Steve laughed again, shaking his head. “I can’t believe I’m about to agree with you.”
Fury chuckled which animated his entire body. “When I said this could be a ‘mentoring opportunity’ I didn’t mean
“What are you going to do, tie Rogers down?” Tony added with a grin. He was standing too close to Bucky at this moment, trying to sound as lighthearted as possible.
“Would you like for me to take care of that for you?” Tony asked in a low voice.
As Tony’s mind and body whirled, trying to mentally prepare himself for his conversation with Steve, less than an hour had passed.
Steve shook his head again, this time a little too vigorously, as he turned to walk back toward his office without motioning for Tony to follow him. He let Tony in first, who paused before entering.
Steve chuckled before tilting his chin downward to kiss Tony. He swayed a bit, leading Tony along with him. Tony held onto him before Steve suddenly spun him around. Tony laughed as Steve then quickly pulled him against his body. The tense atmosphere in the house dissipated as Steve shimmied against Tony to make him laugh which seemed to work because Tony appeared to be enjoying himself. They danced to a few more songs in the living room before calling it a night.
“Ugh, no.” He sorely admitted, returning to his work.
Steve shook his head again as the elevator stopped at the lobby. “I can’t do that. I’m not going to make a scene at my friend’s wedding. I already asked to bring my ex-boyfriend along.”
“Tony?”
“So...” Tony was standing in the middle of the lab, facing Bruce and Shuri.
“Fine, but it could be better.” She answered slowly. Steve watched her shuffle about. He had never seen her so tense before.
Steve chuckled as he leaned away from Tony to look down at him slightly. “Sorry. Thought I would be able to settle more in the background tonight and you would be doing all the talking.”
“Are you always this nosy? Jeez.” Tony lightly quipped, but he walked ahead of Steve so the latter wouldn’t see his hurt expression.
“I hope that’s not a reference to Howard, Rhodey. And if it is, you can go promptly fuck yourself.” Tony sneered as Rhodey laughed.
Loki shrugged. “I’m also at Stark Industries.”
Steve winced as his friends fell over each other at something he didn’t find that funny. Tony Stark barely seemed like someone he could get along with, let alone date. Besides, he probably wasn’t the man’s type anyway.
“Right, you’ve always been a step ahead, Anthony.” Obadiah laughed to himself.
Steve stayed on the bed, looking straight up at the ceiling, wondering to himself how he was going to get through this trip.
Steve nodded back as he let Tony hug him against his body. Tony turned him over onto his back, moving on top of him as he kissed Steve deeply, feeling all along his body. Steve kissed Tony back, rubbing his backside as Tony pushed downward into his body.
“What you see here, Stane, is the future. No one will be able to contest it.”
As the plane came to a complete stop, the group looked out the cabin windows at the resort. The resort was also located on a man-made portion of Long Island. Buildings reflecting the architectural character of Wakanda were surrounded by a sprawling and luscious landscape.
“What would you like to hear, Sir?”
“It’s a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Rogers.” The voice answered.
Steve laughed. “Yeah, Tony. Bucky’s not here, so feel free to come over if you want.”
Steve waited a bit before walking toward his lab. He sighed to himself, mulling over what happened to Clint and the current status of Synergy. As he walked, he passed one of the labs encased in frosted glass he usually past on route to his lab. However, something, like his first day, caught his attention out of the corner of his eye.
“Tony. This makes me look worse than you.” Steve attempted to explain further, but he felt sick to his stomach. Suddenly, and irrationally, part of him began to think that
Clint nodded back at Tony before hustling out of the space. Tony turned to face Shuri and Banner. “Banner and Shuri, just keep doing what you’re already doing.”
“Tony?” Tony could see Steve watching him as he internally debated with himself, “I really want us to make this work.”
Steve smiled a little just to put on a measured façade in front of his employees. “Tony.” He greeted, holding out his hand for Tony to shake.
Steve grimaced. “Mr. Beck? Tony, what are you talking about? The boys talk about him all the time. He’s their favorite teacher, remember?”
The group mumbled collectively in the affirmative before people began to exit the room. Tony stayed near the front.
Steve was standing in the opposite corner of the room next to Natasha and Clint, dead silent, yet enraged by Tony’s behavior.
“Sir, don’t we still, uh, need the device? Without it, this will—”
Tony turned over on his side, staring at the side of the bed Steve usually slept on whenever he spent the night. Tony sighed loudly, wishing Steve was with him now. He turned over on his other side, remembering to check his messages. He peered at his phone which was facing downward on the bedside table, turning it over to find a message from Steve sent a while back.
“Besides that, everyone go about your days as you usually would until we find Loki. Everything else is off hours. Understood?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony smiled, but then his expression hardened as he turned onto his back to face the ceiling.
, just uphold your end of the bargain and I’ll do mine. Agreed?” Obadiah nodded once before angrily tapping on his phone to end the call.
. Tony thought to himself as he tried to come up with a response to Bruce.
Bucky waited for Tony to continue. Tony took a deep breath, feeling the dull sensation in his chest.
A sharp buzz from his phone interrupted the thought. He turned the phone over, which was on his desk upside down, to peer at a message from Pepper. Tony sucked in a breath of air as he read the message.
“If the place is hip, it’ll be on a Wednesday. Cool people don’t like mixing with the crowds during the weekends; college kids drink on Thursdays; and Wednesdays are the middle of the week, which means it’s almost over. Seems like something a hipster would come up with.” Clint sneered.
As soon as Fury contacted Stark Industries, and by extension Tony, about Project Synergy, Obadiah knew he needed superior outside help to steal the tech. He knew Tony was working on redirecting the company’s production from weapons manufacturing. Obadiah couldn’t allow him to do that; their biggest clients were top buyers in that business and the company would fold without them.
Tony nodded as he looked back at Steve. Even though the statement appeared innocent enough, Tony couldn’t help but feel overwhelmed by it considering that every single stress in his life was coming to a head nowadays, including worrying that he might have pissed off Steve beyond repair.
Tony thought again. He shook his head as Steve kissed him; he seemed unaware that Tony was fidgeting around, fighting himself not to say his thoughts out loud.
Later that night, Tony went to bed earlier than usual to catch up on sleep. He sat on the edge of the bed, thinking about Steve and Peter. He fished out Steve’s letter from the beside table and read it again.
Tony sighed, hanging his head low. “No, Banner, ugh…Steve…brought a fucking date…”
Tony wondered as he threw some more ingredients onto the plate before jogging it over to the island. He then backed away from the island, pacing back and forth in front of it.
Tony chuckled; He noticed he was starting to become a little more comfortable around Pepper. “I like how it’s not a possibility that I had anything to do with it.” He teased before pausing. “Actually, Mr. Steve Rogers came up with the idea.”
“Yep, sure!” Steve heard Bucky shout behind him.
Tony considered the statement against everything else they had encountered thus far. “Nothing is out of the realm of possibility, Banner.”
Steve let out a groan as Tony’s comment made him panic even more. He turned to walk toward to the bedroom door.
Peter nodded with a sigh. “Yeah, but they
“Oh, and, uh…,” Tony took his time turning around again as he heard Steve address him once more, “…I found these in my couch…uh…last night…”
Bruce rounded the console to lean against an edge. “Shuri sent me an email last night that she found some obscure notation in your dad’s original schematics that we missed the last pass…she’s not really sure what it means, though…but she’ll explain after she finishes something she was working on all night at Stark Industries.”
Tony had hoped he would be able to lie low during the graduation, but of course being at a university someone was bound to recognize him.
Steve paused before responding. “Tony…I don’t think you’re incapable of figuring out what’s going on, but I understand why you feel frustrated.”
Tony nodded with a smile, leaning back in his chair. He looked forward before turning slightly toward Steve again.
“I’ll see ya.” Steve answered as he heard the bathroom door close.
“…Bruce and I are working on codes for another scenario before the publicity tour starts.” Tony desperately tried to change the tone in the conversation again, hoping Steve would just play along.
“Hey! It’s Malibu time!”
Steve furrowed his brow as he took the hint that the conversation had been taken to another level; it was now more about their continuing fight than anything else.
“Hey! When did you get in?” Steve asked with a broad smile as he set Peter up at the island to toss ingredients into the salad.
“…my dad
does that have to do with Steve?"
“Tony…” Steve was wringing his hands on top of his stomach.
“Well, I had no
“…honestly,” Steve waved a hand around, “I don’t have any ulterior motive for bringing Tony along…okay? Please don’t make this a bigger deal than it already is.” He pleaded.
Also, if he confessed to Steve that he loved him, would Steve even say it back? There was no way Tony was going to put himself in that position especially after the huge fight they just had. No, he would just wait; everything was just as fine as it was.
“Besides…there might be something that you thought you enjoyed that you probably aren’t into anymore…” Tony took a deep breath before continuing. He reached out a hand to rub Steve’s waist, pulling him close, slipping a thumb underneath the band of his briefs.
“I miss you, Steve. We used to talk all the time. Now I never hear from you…” Bucky sounded hurt which made Steve feel terrible.
Tony turned to face Steve, holding a small little black box with a giant red bow on top. He watched Steve’s eyes widen, signaling that he was speculating what the contents of the box might be.
Tony looked to be considering the proposal, but then he shook his head again. “As appealing as that sounds, it’s totally okay, Rogers. Thank you though.”
After the project ended, Bruce went back to work on his daily tasks for the company. Tony had also hired Shuri as a fulltime Stark Industries employee. And everyone else on the team went back to work at their original positions before they joined Synergy.
During their last day at the house in the Hamptons, Tony thought about giving the ring away; he didn’t want it. Last night, however, after Steve left, Tony convinced himself that maybe he could give it to him because ever since they left the house, all Tony could think about was asking Steve to—
Tony glanced downward at his leg before slowly looking up at Steve, grinning widely from making Steve laugh. Steve smiled back; although there was a weird feeling between them, it was fading steadily as they settled in their seats.
“Hi, Tony. How are you?”
Tony sighed as he tried to mentally craft his next sentence. “I ran into an ex at the event…actually that guy I told you about…”
“Hey, Cap! Come over here for a sec.” Bucky was motioning with his beer glass.
Steve let out a whiny noise as he shuffled underneath Tony, but he smiled to convey to Tony that he knew he was attempting to ease his apprehension.
Steve let go to stand up straight, leaning forward to place both hands on Tony’s face to pull him into a kiss. Tony let Steve hold him as he wrapped both hands around Steve’s waist. Steve moved one hand from Tony’s cheek to place on his waist, kissing him one last time before hugging him tight again.
“Is this why you were avoiding me the rest of the night?” Tony asked casually, turning to face a projection above the console.
Steve’s expression hardened, instantly feeling himself losing control over his emotions. “Of course, I do, Tony.” He answered sternly.
Natasha nodded with a smile. “Yes, hopefully we can do this again.”
He sighed loudly, swearing to himself before reaching for the bedside table drawer. Tony slowly withdrew the envelope from the drawer, turning it over before lifting the flap. He stared at the folded letter, groaning before pulling the letter free.
“Hey, Rhodey—Is Peter all right?” Tony nearly dropped his phone, believing the worst.
“Yeah…I’m setting it now…” Tony walked slowly toward the device before leaning downward to input the failsafe code. He let out an uneasy sigh; they were more than capable with reconstructing the device, but now Tony was frustrated with how Steve reacted.
, save it, Rogers!” Tony had taken a step toward Steve to meet him at the door, “when we’re here at work, I’m your boss, not your—” Tony cut himself off, waving a hand around as if trying to explain whatever relationship he had with Steve.
Tony sat down on the edge of the bed; his mannerisms were becoming more anxious and he knew that Steve could tell that something was up.
“Sir, your readings appear to show that you are under duress. Do you need medical attention?” J.A.R.V.I.S. asked him.
Tony groaned even louder. He slapped a hand to his face to cover his eyes, taking a moment. “Speaking of which, are you still able to go with me to the house in the Hamptons?
“Tony. Tony!” Bruce shouted as he watched Tony continue to ambulate aimlessly.
Steve retained a soft expression toward Peter before returning to his food. As they continued to eat, Steve felt a hand slide across his leg. He glanced over at Tony, trying not to turn pink from the intimate contact in front of Peter. However, Tony didn’t make a big deal about it; in fact, the longer he kept his hand on Steve’s leg, the more Steve was beginning to feel more comfortable being so close to Tony.
“You know, I seem to remember an encounter that sounds a lot like that. And like you said, it was late.” Tony tried through the smile.
“So, what else is there to know about Project Synergy? That letter they sent you was super vague.” Sam wasn’t as nosy as Bucky, but Steve could tell that he was also fascinated by this mysterious project.
Tony looked at Steve before facing the road again. “Thank you again for coming with me…it’s a lot to ask for, but—”
Tony watched the door close. He waited a second or so before smiling to himself, turning the car engine on. Along the way home, all he could think about was how hot his moment with Steve was and how close he felt to him. He smiled ridiculously thinking about Steve as the private express elevator carried him up to the penthouse. As soon as the doors opened into the penthouse, Tony pulled out his phone to text Steve.
Fury slid against the wall to retrieve some rolled-up maps in the corner. He unfurled them before placing them on the table. Everyone scooted close as best as they could to take a look.
Everyone peered out of the helicopter to see Steve holding a thumbs up with his free hand to show that despite sustaining injuries from the reactionary blast, Tony was alive. Everyone cheered as Natasha maneuvered the helicopter over toward Steve and Tony.
believed that you were having a good time this time around.” Bucky teased as he settled next to Steve as Sam settled on his other side.
Steve nodded with a kind smile. To Tony, something about the smile was both super sexy and innocent.
“Would you, um…” Steve flinched, almost sure he hadn’t heard Tony begin to address him again. He turned somewhat to look at his lab mate out of the corner of his eye.
Steve nodded again, squeezing Tony’s shoulder before letting go. “I think that’s a good idea…”
“There I was—just the clothes on my back—completely unaware of my surroundings. My lucky hammer was my only companion...”
“You know the way out, correct?” Thanos asked with his back still turned toward Obadiah, working quietly to himself.
“…you should have seen him, Tony,” Tony groaned as Bruce pressed on, “he looked heartbroken that he didn’t even know about trip. You should have talked to him.”
“I don’t know what there’s to say, Buck.” Steve lowered his voice as he answered, a little self-conscious that Bucky had been so blatant.
“Nothing.” Bucky shrugged again, his expression turning cheerful suddenly. He swiftly grabbed an appetizer from a server passing trays before making a move to walk away.
“It’s morning, Tony.” Steve answered, not really hiding underneath the blankets but he had them drawn up to his neck.
Steve laughed as Tony gently pushed him onto the bed, grabbing Tony to scoot up the bed to meet the headboard. Their clothes were scattered about the floor around the bed.
There were a few scratches on the cover, but besides that, the diary was in good shape.
Steve groaned as his eyes flickered opened from the morning light. He shifted, realizing that Tony was lying halfway on top of him, sleeping soundly. He smiled as he rubbed Tony’s back before turning toward the bedside table to check the time. It was early in the morning, so he still had some time before needing to meet up with Bucky and Sam for brunch.
Waking up and find another part of his body being replaced by something else,
“Looking for him?”
“I – what?” a genuinely confuse painted all over Steve’s face right now, his voice lowered as he no longer shouts. “Turned her down? What – we – there’s –
“Listen, beauty. You better shut your fucking mouth right now or people will notice just how ugly you are,” she didn’t even grunt when that blonde jerking to escape, which only made Natasha’s grip even tightened around her hand. “You’ve been under the Council’s eyes these past years – we know all of your dirty little secret and don’t make us write this down as your another black list.”
“If it’s about you breaking up with him, don’t worry, he already done that.”
Sore, but undamaged.
Steve nearly got himself beaten when he waits for Tony the next day. All thanks to Pepper, Rhodey only huffed instead after shoving him hard into a nearby wall. He let the quarterback off with a sharp
“Write what?! I do nothing! It’s those faggot faults that I –”
“Well, he didn’t. Only punched me so hard I won’t ever able to forget it.”
“What? Sorry?” at this Tony turned from his table, though his eyes still refuse to meet Steve’s, “I knew she made you drunk, I knew that wasn’t your fault. But – but I’m sorry. I’m done Steve, we’re done. I just can’t – seeing something like that again.”
“Tony.”
“Tony –”
“I’m sorry it’s my fault.”
“I do.”
“See? You didn’t even learning your mistake. Saying those things can be considered as harassment. Try to think before speaking or when simply doing something – unless you have no brain to do that.”
“For God’s sake! She got me drunk that night! I will never lay my hand to other people than Tony and you guys know that!”
“Three days.”
“So you following me instead.”
No, it was something else.
And everyone knew. Every single soul knew which maybe including Fury because that man always knew about something.
“Get rid of that bitch,” Bucky said before leaving, “And when you’re done, we’ll let you meet Tony again.” He stopped, though, between the door to turn to Steve and said, “I know we are buddy, Steve, I know we have always said ‘bros before hoes’. But this is Tony we are talking about and I will never forgive you for what you’ve done to him.”
“What?! No! No, I don’t want to break up with him – who said I want to break up with him?!”
Something snapped inside Steve’s mind. He almost, just a second behind, raised his hand when Natasha’s voice sounded from nearby; calling his name with a deep warning. The red haired Russian looked calm as she walked in and Steve had no idea if she had heard everything or just happened to be in the right place at the right time. It's easier to crack the governor code than reading Natasha’s face.
“Shut your fucking mouth!” literally everyone turned to them when Steve slams the table, but he was too furious to give a fuck. “You made me drunk, you tricked me. We’re not and never will be together and besides, you are too damn a whore to call yourself my girl. Tony is a guy with none of that worth ten of you. Get the fuck out of our life.”
“That’s so vanilla Steve.”
“Tony.”
“Punching her won’t solve anything. It only makes it worse,” she put a hand on Steve’s shoulder to calm him. “Come on, Pepper said you want to talk to Tony today.”
The last one only spoken once, or maybe more since Tony only aware of Steve’s rambling over the com recently. But it was enough to make him choked on his own breath.
As often time they spar together, or making a bet with each other, or went on an undercover mission to the depth of the ocean together.
“I don’t know if I can forget it or not, Steve.”
“I don’t deserve you.”
“Don’t,” he said with trembled voice, “Mess with me Steve.”
“Because he knew who she is! Do you think Tony ever thought that an offer from the team’s captain cheerleader to celebrate their member’s oh so called birthday will turned into his boyfriend cheating in front of him?! Do you ever imagine how his face when he saw you sucking that breast and let her steer you away from the crowd?! Leaving him alone, in the middle of a party which of course out of his comfort zone and getting bullied by people around?!”
He went to Tony’s apartment, but the place was empty. He contacted Rhodey and Pepper but they completely ignored him. Both Donald and Sam didn’t much help since they refuse to tell him even though how hard he begged them. He asked Clint but the placekicker shout him inappropriate words before hanging up with a loud click – he never met the Hawkeye after that, not even in practice. Bruce just sighed when Steve phoned him, saying with his calmed tone that he’s so upset with Steve and warned him to not contacted Natasha if he still love his head because she was really, really pissed off with him.
His heart scattered when Tony gave him a forced smile. Steve tried to grab that small wrist, tried to get it under his hand again, but Clint stepped between them and though he was smaller than Steve, he looked intimidating enough. “Please, Clint, I don’t want to lose him,” then to Tony, “Please, give me a chance to fix this sweetheart.”
“Did you know what he said to me this morning?” was what Bucky warned before he hit Steve, hard.
“This conversation won’t go anywhere, right?”
The voice was barely there. Almost inaudible if Tony didn’t pay much attention. But Captain America was actually repeatedly murmuring his name. Followed by
“I won’t let you.” Carefully, Steve squatted in front of Tony then raised his hand to cupped Tony’s cheek. He almost shouted in joy when instead of jerking away, Tony just sighed and moved closer to his hand with closed eyes. He stayed like that for a couple of second before saying, “Open your eyes, Tony. Look at me.” And there it was, the lovely brown eyes Steve couldn’t help from falling in love over and over again. “I’ve loved you, I love you, and I will still love you in the future. Keep that in mind, Tony, but I don’t mind saying it again as many times as you want.”
Steve groaned on his palm when Tony grinned at him. All innocent and white teeth. “It shouldn’t be like this.”
There was a paused as gears tickling inside Steve head, processing Tony’s words. When he gets it, his face exploded in a crimson red as his mouth gaping like a goldfish, drawing out a laugh from Tony’s chest. He walked back to the small chair beside Tony’s bed with right hand half raised and mouth opened but no sound escape. Until he sat on the said chair he found back his voice.
, wasn’t something he fancies with.
Steve stood still in front of the door blocking the only way out. “Bruce told me not to shout, respecting our seniors here.”
“We’re done, Steve,” Tony said still refuse to see him, “I know something like this will happen soon. I’m fine, though.”
Steve blinked in confuse as his brain tried to process what the fuck just happened. He just finished showering after a long exhausted football training and only manage to put up his pants when suddenly his best friend stormed into the room. Face furious and demand nothing from Steve even just a simple ‘hey buddy, how’s your arm’ before he said those things and hit him.
“Good.” He left after Pepper shouted his name.
“Maybe?”
Steve didn’t answer.
You know how much I love him – you were there when I desperately started to try to win him three years ago! Did you forget that?!”
Tony thought as he gave an open smile, “I love you too.”
Both Pepper and Rodhey glancing at each other hearing him, with Rhodey frowned and Pepper only sighed. Then after a couple of seconds or so they turned back to Steve. “Three pm. He had no class after that,” said Pepper while Rhodey looked annoyed, but said nothing, “But Bruce will be there, in case something get out of control.”
What he didn’t miss, was the white ceiling of a hospital room and Steve sat beside him.
Who had no gut to say something.
“You’re not what? Banging that blonde whore in that closet?” his hand on Steve’s shoulder clenched and he ignored the painful hiss from his friend. “Fucking her cunt while your own boyfriend got harassed in front of the whole party?! Are you going to deny that Steve?!” he pushed Steve hard, made not only his body, but also his head hitting the locker with a loud thump.
Steve stopped and stood hesitating in front of the door. It was quarter to five already and Steve is doubting if Tony was still in there; considering that Pepper told Natasha, it’s a huge possibility that she also told him. He let one of his senior walked in passed him and pay no attention at her strange look. Then after two or three deep breath, Steve walked in.
Steve sighed in relief when on Monday morning he found Tony in the hallway, but his spirit soon vaporized when he saw Tony noticed him and fucking run away instead. Angry and tired of himself, for this day Steve chose to take a day off and only went to college for evening training. Didn’t even imagine that he would get a punch from his old buddy.
The next thing Steve knew, he was left alone in the middle of hallway silently watching Tony walked away inside Clint’s embrace.
He shuddered to imagine that.
Great. Where there was Bruce, there was also Natasha. So it was Natasha whom Pepper mean as the guard dog. Definitely not Bruce. Clever girl. “Okay, not a problem. Second lab, then?”
But it seems neither of them heard him. Leaving the genius dumbfounded staring at the darkness surrounding him with Clint and Sam bickering over the com as the background sound and Steve constantly whispering his name like he was praying.
Tony, now straddling Steve’s waist, sat up. “Yeah,
Steve had left earlier that day to go for a run, attempting to use it as an opportunity to process his emotions. He ran back to the apartment not long after Tony had left to find Bucky standing in the kitchen drinking a cup of coffee. Steve acknowledged him with a nod before stretching in the middle of the living room.
He took his time walking slowly toward Tony’s giant jacuzzi bathtub which was situated in the middle of the space. Steve limped slightly to the counter space, removing his clothes to place on top as he caught a glimpse of himself in the mirror. He had quite a few scratches and burns from the explosion that were healing quickly, but it still took some getting used to seeing himself like this. Even in the army, Steve had never sustained so many injuries.
Tony waited for the older man to continue, even though he could really care less at this point. It was becoming clear, especially during the final interview stage, that Obadiah had been slowly trying to push him out of Project Synergy.
heard, Rogers.” The statement made Steve laugh, although his expression eventually settled to express his concern for Tony.
Shuri nodded slowly as she looked at the screen. “I emailed Bruce about this…we can finish the first round of safeguards here at the resort, but it won’t be a hundred percent complete.”
Tony turned somewhat to smile back at Steve before placing a record on top of the player. It spun around a few times until it began playing Billie Holiday’s “I’ll Be Seeing You”. Tony plopped down on the sofa, groaning to himself as the music continued to play. Steve watched the scene in front of him before taking his time to join Tony. He sat up straight with his hands in his lap as Tony sank further into the cushions, leaning on the armrest with a hand covering his face.
Tony rubbed his shoulder some more before rising from the sofa, holding out his hand for Steve to take. Steve smiled timidly before accepting. He followed Tony to his master bedroom, his heart doing somersaults the entire trip there. As they entered, the bedroom was dimmed, but Steve could still see Tony in front of him.
"No worries, Virginia. It appears that my assistant mixed up the times." He walked back to his chair as Tony tried to settle in his.
“…Hi, yep, it’s me,” Tony laughed, “…no, not today. I’m calling to add a name to Peter’s pickup list…” he waited a bit before continuing, shyly smiling back at Steve before turning around to face away from him, “…Steve Rogers…uh, yes…same one…” Tony’s voice lowered, trying not to make it obvious that he had been telling the office people at his kid’s school about the person he’s been seeing.
Loki sighed as he placed his tiny cup on its saucer, shrugging. “I don’t know, Thor.
Tony had been working on the Synergy device and reviewing his dad’s schematics after arguing with Steve earlier that morning. He was beginning to regret accepting Steve’s invitation to the bridal party getaway; he was confused by what Steve wanted, but then again he was also confused about what he himself wanted.
“Hey, Peter.” He greeted with a wave as Peter turned around at the sound of his name.
“Okay, Parker,” Tony called, “have it come over to your dad.” He pointed at Steve who looked back and forth between his kid and his husband, horrified by the robot’s capabilities.
Steve managed to laugh back, although he felt incredibly awkward. He watched Tony crack a few eggs before tossing them into a frying pan.
Peter cried without responding right away. He then nodded again as he tightened his grasp on Tony.
After eating, the group went to a bar that wasn’t too far away from the restaurant. They ended up running into some members of Steve’s graduating cohort and professors, turning the small gathering into a larger informal graduation party.
This chapter is broken up into two parts for a much-needed pause in the middle. Enjoy reading!
Bucky wiped his eyes as he let out another sigh. “Cap! You gotta admit that that there is some cosmic trickery.” He paused for a second as he appeared to be remembering something, “actually, Sam had asked me before we found out that you broke up whether he should plan for you bringing Sharon and I
He held onto Tony, still feeling euphoric. The feeling washed over him as Steve suddenly felt himself falling asleep, still clutching onto Tony as he let himself drift off.
“Uh,” Tony shuffled around in his chair after they ordered some appetizers, “do you remember the first time we worked on the device together?—But, I think I might have blown the vibe by freaking out on you during that first simulation with the group…” He mentally berated himself for starting with that in order to avoid talking about something serious.
As soon as Steve finally met Tony, he reached out his hands, rubbing Tony’s arms as tenderly as possible. Tony choked on the sob he tried to will away before letting Steve pull him into a hug.
As soon as the doors opened, Peter jumped out to greet Tony.
Tony couldn’t help staring at him; the light from the candle in the middle of the table accentuated every little feature on his handsome face. Something about Steve’s demeanor and tone in his voice suggested that maybe he was interested. Besides, who starts talking about being vulnerable and such while having a nice quiet, intimate dinner like this?
Steve blamed himself.
“Let me know when you’re on your way back home, Steve.” By this time Steve had turned to leave, but he could hear Sam’s voice behind him.
At this moment, the hired orchestra for that night’s evening began playing a version of “3 Pièces pour orchestre”. Tony placed his drink on the counter behind them before walking forward. He turned around, reaching his hand out toward Steve who looked puzzled.
Peter looked past Tony to see Steve standing nearby. Steve waved shyly, unsure if Peter would even care.
Tony, now expressing horror, rapidly shook his head a few times. “What? No, I’m just being honest like we talked about.”
“Right, I’ve kept you too long.” Tony joked.
Peter giggled as Tony picked him up from the ladder. He gently placed Peter down in front of Steve before returning to the pot on the stove.
“Hold on everyone! Chill for a sec…” Tony held his hands out to get everyone to stop talking all at once, “Of course I don’t want to tell you what to do, Shuri, but I honestly think cancelling the wedding would be a mistake…”
Tony waited for Pepper to reply before gathering his things on his desk. As he prepared to slip a document of an annotated image of vibranium into a folder he stopped to think about Steve sketching in the lab. Tony smiled as he inserted the image into the folder, still smiling as he zipped his bag before turning the lights off in his office.
“Come in!” Tony called, never taking his eyes off his task.
Tony groaned as he shook his head, but he finished packing his things before responding. “Obie, I really don’t have the bandwidth to deal with this shit right now.” He closed his eyes, took a deep, much-needed breath as he motioned toward Obadiah with one hand.
“Tony…I’m really sorry that I didn’t tell you that I’m seeing someone…we just started seeing each other this past month…”
Tony’s smile spread across his face even more as he took the opportunity to move his hand closer toward Steve’s crotch, stopping short to rub the inside of his leg.
“Okay, Rogers.
Steve waited nervously next to the car, crossing his arms, trying to seem as cool as possible as he waited for Peter to appear. He looked around and smiled at the other parents before the school bell rang way too loudly.
Gamora unexpectedly flinched in time with the flash of light that her safety goggles barely shielded her eyes against. Yet, as her vision gradually recovered, she could hear her father laughing manically before speaking to her sister.
Thanos had his daughters meet him in his office later that evening. As soon as they arrived, he was sitting at his desk watching a recording of the Synergy promotional event Steve and Tony had given in Berlin. Thanos cackled to himself as he listened; Gamora and Nebula were standing on the other side of the desk, annoyed with their father’s developing obsession with Synergy.
“Of course, I have!”
“What would make you believe that, Tony?” Pepper rephrased quietly, “has Steve said or done anything that would lead you to believe that?”
Yeah, sometimes Tony appeared aloof, but he
“Parker, you’re the smartest kid I know, and I’m not biased at all.” Tony tapped on the tablet he was holding, “okay why don’t we give this a try…”
Steve smiled wider, but just enough not to look silly. “Of course, Tony.”
“Steve…?” Was all Tony could handle in an extremely low, surprised voice.
years of my life. I would have killed to hear him say he screwed up, not muse about the possibilities over twenty fucking years later in a fucking diary, Steve!”
Fury smirked before turning around to walk away with a shrug.
Tony moaned quietly as he felt Steve squeeze his waist gently. They kissed each other in this position for some time, taking their time as if they hadn’t seen each other in ages.
“Oh my god, I love you so much, Steve.” Tony breathed as he squeezed Steve’s body, lifting his head to kiss him.
“Why…wouldn’t I care…?” Tony said quietly, fighting back a sob that had formed in his throat.
Tony could feel his face growing hot; so hot that he had to keep one hand on the armrest of his chair to steady himself.
Tony nodded as he motioned for Steve to come further into his office as he stayed near the window. Steve took two steps forward, remaining closer toward the door.
Steve nodded, finally taking it easy, kissing Tony. He turned some more onto his side to hug Tony.
Steve blushed as he accepted the tissue, awkwardly wiping himself off before zipping up his pants.
The unexpected compliment caused Riri to look more cheerful than before. She straightened up a bit as it became clear that she wasn’t in trouble.
Steve reminded himself.
Tony nodded but his attention was divided between the ridiculous presentation he was about to give and worrying about Steve. He waited with Rhodey by the stage as Pepper talked for a minute before motioning for Tony to join her. Everyone began clapping and cheering as Tony walked onto the stage, waving awkwardly, too self-conscious knowing that Steve was in the crowd but he couldn’t see him because the lights had been dimmed for the projections to be visible.
…Steve looked up at Tony who was staring listlessly at the signature.
surprised.”
Tony shuffled a bit to fiddle some more with his dad’s record.
The intern watched Tony leave before looking at Steve. Steve sighed before marching out of the room in the opposite direction of Tony.
“…after the trip to the Hamptons…I…ugh…” Tony rubbed his forehead with his free hand, “…this whole thing is a nightmare because of me…” He groaned.
Tony screamed in his head, leaning back into his chair, rubbing his forehead again.
“Nope,” Steve waved his hands around, “I’m shutting this whole thing down.”
Tony grabbed Steve even harder as he kneaded Steve’s ass with his hands. He widened his legs to let Steve drop down further against his body which cause Steve to shift his body weight against him, grinding his cock up against Tony’s. As he felt his body react, Tony moaned loudly through their kiss, feeling Steve up against him; even through their clothing, Tony could feel Steve getting hard.
Steve nodded as he placed his hands on his hips. “I should really apologize. I realize I haven’t since the argument over the failsafe…it’s obvious that it’s still bothering you…”
. Tony’s insides felt like a smorgasbord offering varying levels of pain. Hopefully, the smile he was wearing for Steve masked all of that.
“We’re
The provocation nearly knocked the wind out of Tony; despite how contentious their relationship had become since launching Synergy, Tony couldn't believe how blatant Obadiah was acting. He felt like a kid again getting harangued for fucking up over and over.
“It’ll only change slightly, just enough for someone to do a double take if they’ve met you before.” Tony returned with the glasses, handing one to Steve. Their hands brushed up against each other, but neither acknowledged it as they continued with the plan.
Sam shook his head as his laughter subsided. “Nothing, Steve. I’m glad you and Tony are working well together.”
Tony groaned as he turned over. He stayed facing downward in a pillow but turned his head slightly to address Peter.
“Steve, you can take the bedroom then. I don’t mind.”
“Oh, nice. Would love to meet a friend of yours.” Tony lied, his teeth practically gritting against one another.
Tony wouldn’t give Tiberius the satisfaction of visibly acknowledging Steve. “He already knows about you so you can cool it with the dramatics.”
“Whenever you’re assessing the validity of a hypothesis, you have to run multiple tests to establish any possible variables.” Although it was straight forward science, Tony meant for the sentence to sound as condescending as possible.
“…fine…” Tony let out, “I guess you’re right…”
life wondering if you missed out on something? I know I wasn’t Tony’s biggest fan when you started this thing, but I saw the way he was with you today, and I can tell he likes you.” He pointed at Steve. “And vice versa.”
Tony considered Steve’s position; he appreciated his unflinching doggedness, but Tony feared that there could be more danger ahead if they advanced the project. Besides, this was his dad’s legacy, not his. He had no obligation to finish it, even if Tony had figured out how to get the device to work.
As Tony and Bruce entered the conference room, it immediately became apparent that there was something unfortunate hanging in the air.
“The Synergy device is only stable because of its virbanium core. We find something to counteract that and build the same core. It’s simple.”
Tony inhaled sharply before responding. “Hey, are you free to talk?”
“Did you forget our meeting, Tony?”
Steve walked to the middle of the space near the fireplace. He crouched down once he approached the boxes, hesitating before opening one. Once he finally dusted the flaps off to open a box, he found another stack of albums and a bundle of papers tied together. Steve carefully removed the albums, looking through them before moving the papers aside. Immediately, he eyed what looked to be a jewelry box at the bottom of the box.
Silence hung in the air as Steve tried to figure out how to respond. He looked around, anywhere really except at Tony who was now fidgeting. He wasn’t sure why he suddenly felt nervous; while with Bruce he felt at ease, but now with Tony, he could feel obvious tension between the two.
“Do you want coffee or something, Tony?” Steve leaned inward to whisper to Tony.
“Tony, you could have gotten either yourself or Steve hurt. What if Obadiah found out? What if he already knows? How did you meet the buyers without them recognizing you?” Pepper couldn’t help herself from inadvertently interrogating Tony.
“I, uh, used to feel like that before I met Steve…” Tony quietly volunteered.
Tony’s eyes widened, absolutely mortified, but he was speechless.
Steve leaned forward to study Tony’s face closer. “Yeah it’s a little creepy, I’ll give you that…” He reached out a hand to touch Tony’s face, completely disregarding any semblance of personal space, but Tony didn’t seem to mind.
“…Steve, I don’t…trust myself…”
“How was your night?” Shuri asked as she joined Tony on the other side of the conference table.
Tony drew in a painful-sounding sigh before finally letting go of Steve to turn over onto his back. He sighed again as he looked upward at the ceiling.
“I’m going to have to get you up here more often, Rogers.” Tony began as he joined to admire the skyline with Steve. He had two drinks with him, one of which was a glass of water he handed to Steve.
Tony laughed loudly. “No, Rogers. He’s still too young to own a phone. I made him a watch that he can send me messages through, well, emojis really. J.A.R.V.I.S. is also wired to it, but besides that, it’s really just a high-tech looking wristwatch.”
“Stark,” Natasha called sternly through everyone’s earpiece, “there are some numbers here that don’t look like the information for the medical supplies…I’m not sure what to make of it. I’m sending it to you and Dr. Banner now.”
murder you.”
“Yeah?” Bruce stopped, “What was I talking about just now?” He dipped his eyeglasses downward, patiently waited for Tony to answer.
The press pool grew quiet as soon as Steve finished his comment. Everyone else at the table also remained quiet. Tony turned slightly to look at Steve.
Steve looked back up at Sam and Bucky, both expressing sincerity, but Steve sensed that they wanted him to be completely transparent about his feelings.
After eating, Tony, still wearing the mask, announced that it was time for Peter to work on his homework before going to bed. Peter had asked Steve to assist Tony in helping the nine-year old with his homework, although it was clear that Tony was playing along. Finally, it was time for Peter to get ready for bed which allowed Tony to finally take the mask off.
Tony nodded before continuing. “Peter’s parents…they were good friends of mine. They used to work at Stark Industries before they died…the same way my parents had…I think one of the reasons why I felt like I needed to take Peter in was because of the way he lost his parents. He could have easily grown up the way I had, but I couldn’t allow it…”
As Steve was in the process of responding to Tony, a ringing sound emitted from their suite’s foyer. Both Steve and Tony looked at each other before Steve walked through the living space to get to the foyer. He walked up to the elevator to review the security panel next to the elevator. Steve squinted to see Bucky requesting access to his and Tony’s suite. Steve approved the access and not long after Bucky appeared in the foyer.
“Tone? You all right?”
Tony waved him off again with a smile. “Yeah, sure…”
After cleaning, Peter got ready for bed and Steve helped Tony tuck him in. After putting Peter to bed, Steve and Tony took their time walking to the master bedroom. Tony opened the door for Steve; Steve smiled back at him as he approached the bed, unbuttoning his shirt.
Steve made a face, but he looked away from Bucky, turning red from the insinuation. “There’s nothing going on, Buck,” he then faced Bucky, “Tony and I are just friends. Besides this is mostly for Peter than anything else.”
Steve looked back at the elevator again before turning to face Tony; his expression becoming even more perplexed.
“Tony…” Steve whined, but never backed away.
Tony could hear Bruce swear through the channel in their earpieces.
Steve backed away from the bed, feeling himself panic. “Maybe…uh, maybe there’s a pullout somewhere.” He almost tripped over himself as he searched the room, leaving Tony staring at the teddy bear on the bed.
“Then,” Tony turned to Steve with a broad smile, “I’ll have you come out and give a little spiel about the device. Like the vibranium core and how it replicates material or whatever.”
Steve turned his head to look at Tony. He laughed again before getting off the bed to follow Tony into the bathroom.
“It was nice to see you both again, and I hope you have a nice rest of the day!” Mr. Beck showed Steve and Tony out into the hallway before closing the door.
“J.A.R.V.I.S.,” Tony began as he entered the elevator,” send an email to Banner to let him know I’ll meet him in his lab during lunch.”
“Tony…” He finally gasped, “this is serious…”
Steve held on to Tony’s hand, closing the gap between them. Tony placed a hand on his shoulder as Steve positioned himself to take the lead, impressing Tony as he effortlessly began maneuvering them around to the rhythm of the music.
“It would make sense that he would take you…or Colonel Rhodes even if he were here…I have to remind myself that we haven’t known each other that long…” Steve tried to rationalize Tony’s behavior out loud, but he struggled trying to come to terms with it.
“Shit!” Tony smacked his forehead with his hand before squiggling out of the bed.
“So, what happens if it doesn’t understand what needs to be replicated?” The board member asked as he scratched his head.
They both continued to stare at the other for a second or so before the rest of the team barged into the lab.
Tony turned slightly as he tried to open the door. “I’m just doing us a favor, Steve.”
“Good morning, Sir.” J.A.R.V.I.S. greeted.
“Whoa, this is too awesome, Steve!” Sam studied Steve’s annotated sketch of the vibranium core at the little table that separated their kitchen and living room. Marvin Gaye’s “Trouble Man” was quietly playing from the stereo in the living room. Steve was perched against the counter drinking a cup of coffee. He had promised Sam they would celebrate his first day, but he needed a little boost of energy.
Bruce nodded back at Tony. “Sure, Tony.”
Tony was standing in front of their group of friends who had gathered on the penthouse’s balcony to celebrate Steve’s birthday.
Both Tony and Pepper glanced at each other before Tony reached for the envelope. After opening the envelope, he flipped through a few documents until his expression hardened.
Tony laughed back way too loudly. “You know me!” He turned around to walk over to Bruce, holding his tablet out, “also, here are the drawings for some safety uniforms.”
Steve smiled as he sat up straight in the bed. "One of the board members at the event—”
Tony shook his head as he tried again. “The chip with the failsafe codes. I gave it to you a while back. Do you have it? Please tell me you still have it.”
“Oh!” Steve sat down before getting back up again, “do you want anything to drink?”
Steve groaned as he pushed his friend’s arm away but Bucky kept up with him, now laughing loudly.
Steve groaned, wallowing in pain and embarrassment, as he laid back down in the bed, rolling from side to side.
Steve sighed as he hung his head, still mounted on his bike. He had to finally admit that he had been sitting on his emotions for too long, pushing them down, lying to himself that he was trying to repair a friendship with Tony for Peter’s sake. When in reality, he missed Tony, too.
Steve took note of how engaged Tony appeared as his lab partner studied whatever was in front of him.
.” From the tone in Tony’s voice, Steve could tell that that was the end of the conversation. No further questions asked.
Steve nodded; he waited a moment before responding. “I can get him for you if you want, Tony. I can borrow Bucky’s car.”
Tony froze much like he had when Steve confessed his feelings the first time.
Hey, you don’t have any food allergies, right? 🤔
Tony’s mouth bobbed open as he attempted a reply.
Steve looked upward at the ceiling before peeking downward at the covers on top of his body. He removed the sheets slightly to keep looking at himself before reaching downward to feel a little. He moaned as soon as his hand found its way to the base of his cock. He closed his eyes as he felt himself, getting so caught up in the moment that he lost track of time.
“That I would fool around with you while I was seeing someone else? Tony, do you not know me at all?” Steve’s expression was harsh as he spoke, so harsh that for a second Tony barely recognized him.
Tony had to prevent his face from twisting into the most puzzled expression he had ever expressed.
“…I just wanted to apologize again…for earlier…I’m really sorry…” Steve let the sentence drag out through agony.
--lady_slice
A jolt reverberating throughout the subway car forced Steve’s body to bump into a shorter older woman. Steve instinctively held out a hand to help the woman, and she gratefully thanked him for stopping her from falling over. Steve smiled back, but on the inside, he felt miserable.
Tony smiled back, giving himself some credit for making a good move finally. He then looked downward at his phone, realizing he was down to one percent battery power.
“I’m really thankful that Tony knew my brother well and was more than willing to take Peter in…he’s really the best thing that’s happened to Peter, honestly…,” May laughed quietly, “actually Peter tells me all the time how happy he is with Tony…I just wish Tony had more faith in himself…”
“You know…” He started, turning back to kiss Tony, “I still need to pay you back for…the time…in the car...” he finished quietly.
Steve tilted his head back to smile at Tony before leaning in to kiss him. “Let’s get back to the party.” He whispered.
“May needs to know,” Tony says.
“I’ll watch on mute,” Tony tried.
“That’s the problem though, I’m not going to forget,” Tony said. “I don’t want to forget. Even if my mind did, my body wouldn't.” He stepped a fraction closer to Steve who still hovered by the door, ready to bolt even though it was his apartment. “I can’t get rid of this and I don’t want to.”
“It’s alright,” he whispers, his own voice coming out horse. He grips harder, almost to the point of pain. “Let me help.”
“How often is it happening?”
“That’s not fair, and you know it.”
“I got one of you storming out by night two,” Sam said with a grin. “The kid’s the only one who has you guys staying together all four.”
“Who else has seen it?”
Steve lets out a sound that’s something between a whimper and a cry, his hands gripping at Tony’s waist again. The sweat and lube between them creates a nice, slick surface and Tony keeps rutting on Steve, letting the head of his dick slide between the perfect V of his hips, while Steve bucks up into him, desperate for more touching, more friction, more something.
“Easy,” he says and straddles Steve again. He takes a deep breath, tries to control the trembling in his own hands before touching Steve. Like the night before, Tony starts by running his hands up and down Steve’s spine, pressing his thumbs into flesh till he feels Steve deflate beneath him. He keeps going, paying attention to the minute shifts in Steve’s breath, the twitches and flinches as Tony hits on a particular sore or sensitive spot.
“You seemed OK enough,” Peter says, his eyes still grazing the floor. “Plus, there were a lot of people around.”
“I’ll have it on for five, ten minutes, tops.”
“Captain Rogers, Dr. Banner’s medical report indicates that when you were found, your body was covered in cuts and scars indicative of physical torture. Can you recall anything that was done to you?”
Steve reaches for the file, but at the last second, Tony it pulls away. “Look, you don’t have to read it if you’re not ready for it, Steve. There’s no pressure.” It’s a half-hearted protest, and they both know Steve can’t avoid these images forever, though Tony would do anything to spare him from them.
Before he could say anything, Kara tugged him across the room, and lay down on the bed, spreading her legs apart.  He’d never gone down on a woman before, had only really ever heard Bucky talk about it, but he wanted to do it. Badly.
There’s a time after that (in Clint’s barn, Steve pressing Tony against the wall, stroking both their dicks in his massive, calloused palm), and a time after that (the Quinjet, Tony rutting and coming against the sharp V of Steve’s hips) and a time after that  (the lab, when Tony pushes Steve to his knees), all furtive encounters in semi-public places, each one ending with someone walking away first. Sometimes it’s Tony, who tucks himself back inside his pants and gives Steve a little wink before departing. When Steve leaves first, his mouth always stretches into a thin, stern line.
“It’s four nights, Tony,” Natasha said.  “You survived in a cave for months. You’ll be fine.”
Tony nods, and explains what might happen, what it could feel like. “You don’t need to be scared, Peter.”
Trembling with pleasure, Steve let everything inside him unfurl slowly, relishing the light touch of Tony’s fingertips along his cock as he came down. Kara moved up to kiss him, pushing the taste of his own come into his mouth. It was the dirtiest thing Steve had ever done and he almost cried, not out of shame, but because it felt so good.
There are plenty of cheers and a few tears as they all rush into the hanger. He’s able to grab Peter for a few seconds before he gets pulled away by everyone else. Nat, Bruce, Steve, Sam can’t help but pinch his cheeks again.
“Boss, there’s suspected use of alien weaponry happening in a remote region on the western Canadian prairie. Satellite imagery shows radiation readings that are well off the normal range.”
Tony shook his head slightly and tightened his grip on Steve’s hair, locking their eyes. “Fuck me,” he said.  He saw Steve swallow, his hand still working slowly along Tony’s dick.
Steve groans in frustration and tries to still his hips, hands gripping the metal arms of Tony’s desk chair. With care, Tony undoes Steve’s belt and tugs down his zipper, providing just a little bit of relief. The head of his dick is already poking out of the opening of Steve’s pale blue boxers, a site that, even in this weird, fucked up scenario, sends a jolt of desire through him. He reaches between Steve’s legs, thumbs the wet head of Steve’s dick, feels it already sticky with precome.
“What I know is that the failure rate for this is probably around 60%. What I have to decide is if I’m willing to live with the consequences.”
“You leave the towel where it is, ok? If you want me to stop, just say stop and I will.”
“Mr. Stark! Can someone help me?”
“You lost fair and square,” Sam said as they all crowded into one elevator. “There’s about 100 hotel rooms in this entire town and over a 150 people here for this UN conference. You do the math. Sorry man, but fair’s fair.”
“God, you feel so god,” Tony whispers into his ear. “You’re being so good for me, Steve. So very very good.”
Tony thinks about it often enough, wonders if he should say something, bring it up in a casual, non-threatening way.
“That good?” Tony asks, genuinely unsure.
“Do you know how many men or women held you captive.”
“Is that what this is about?” Tony asks quietly, the pieces sliding into place. “Are you mad at me for getting hurt? There were lives on the line, Peter. I did what I thought had to be done.”
He skips dinner and retreats to his room, staring at the ceiling until he hears the soft woosh of the door. Tony lingers for a second before taking a seat on the edge of his bed.  His tie is lose, shirtsleeves rolled up and Steve stares a second too long at the bare strip of his forearm. Tony leaves early tomorrow morning and they should both sleep in their own beds tonight, but Steve spreads his legs just a little and Tony crawls between them.
It takes them 3 full days to wake him up. To hear Steve tell the story, it’s 72 hours of touch and go, where every breath could have been his last.
“All the way,” Tony says, close to Steve’s ear. He sounds wrecked.
“I know. I’m just really surprised is all.”
Peter shrugs. “I don’t know. Lots of things.”
He tightens his grip just a fraction and begins to work his hand up and down Steve’s rigid dick, which is starting to peak through the confines of the towel, already an angry shade of red. He keeps his movements light but efficient, brushing his thumb over the mushroom head until Steve’s breath starts coming in short, heavy bursts.
. Captain America’s.”
Tony pointedly raises his eyebrows towards Steve’s towel. “Is that a side effect?”
“Tony,” Bruce’s voice come through the system anyway. “You need to come down to the hanger. Right now.”
It’s dusk when they finally bring him back.
“Oh,” he says, not sounding all that surprised. “Did I win?”
“How is he?” Steve is waiting for him when he tiptoes out of the bedroom, putting the sofa cushions back in place.
On the way back up to his room, he has FRIDAY disable the security cameras around the gym, so that even if he wanted to, he can’t evesdrop on Steve’s location. He’s already too comfortable crossing the lines of their relationship, the memory of what happened earlier today turning into an urgent pressing need inside his gut. He doesn’t let himself jerk off to that though, no matter how hard he gets in the shower. It feels wrong to use Steve’s confusion and pain for his own pleasure and he wills his erection to soften before tucking himself into a pair of boxers and throwing on a t-shirt. He’s toweling off his hair, thoughts still firmly focused on the folder he left with Steve, when the door chimes.
“After last night? Not a chance.”
“You know what I’m talking about.” There was nothing light in Sam’s tone, just the deadpan seriousness that meant whoever was on the receiving end was in trouble.
“Fuck,” Tony whispers, kissing along the hollow of Steve’s throat, while his hands continue to work.
“Frankly, I hope he doesn’t remember anything about it,” Tony says now, turning back to Bruce. “Nothing good can come from it.”
“In small doses, maybe. It’s main use is an anesthetic. It numbs people to pain but can also essentially wipe out their memory.” He leaves out the part about how it increases sexual arousal, for which Tony is unendingly grateful. “When I did his labs, Steve’s blood was drowning in it. They kept him mostly under sedation for 8 days. It could have killed him. Fried his brain totally or destroyed his ability to make any new memories at all.”
“God, you don’t listen do you. I told you, I had it handled. But you had to swoop in and blow everything up.”
“This is ridiculous,” Steve mutters, dropping down into Tony’s office chair, resting his head in his hands. He sits with his legs spread apart, his erection straining his trousers.
Tony gives him a sad smile and squeezes his shoulder, one fear at least releasing in his chest.
“Just us,” Tony says. “Rhody, Bruce, Nat. And me and Sam.” He wouldn’t send it on to SHIELD, not until Steve was OK with it. There are more than a few government organizations breathing down their necks, feigning entitlement to something they have no right to.
Through the glare of the setting sun, Tony watches from his office as the Quinjet lands, his feet itching to run out onto the tarmac.
“He’ll be alright.” Tony nods as Steve settles more comfortably against him. He likes being trapped like this, bracketed on both ends by people he loves. “He was angry. And scared. Terrified, I think.”
They stand together in the dark for a long moment, Tony surprised to find himself panting, his own heart beating wildly. With his hands still gripping the chair, Steve tips his head forward, rests it briefly on Tony’s stomach, before pushing away.
He throws the shield to Peter, who barely manages to catch it through his surprise. Steve shows him how to balance his weight, how even the smallest flick of his wrist changes the angle of the throw. They stay at it for longer than 10 minutes, until Tony comes looking for them for dinner.
“Nothing good,” he said, eyes lingering on the turned over metal table, covered in what looked like chicken wire. He crouched down next to it, fingers pulling at the taught carbon steel. The edges of the barb had rusted over with dried blood, likely from the length of time spent digging into Steve’s skin. Tony was too scared to examine anything else more closely, for fear of what would be revealed, but it all pointed to an inevitable conclusion. Steve had spent eight days trapped in this hell, his body being abused, cut and violated.
Tony nods, trying to exhale some his worry. It hasn’t been easy on any of them. For the next hour, the three of them, plus Natasha, sit outside his room, impatiently waiting till Bruce finally comes outside.
It took a total of 10 days before Bruce discharged him from the medical wing and back to his quarters. The fact that he pulled through was a minor miracle considering his blood had almost been ionized into nothing. Tony had never been so grateful to be back in his own bed. He flopped onto the mattress, barely making it under the covers before wiping out. From his internal clock, it felt like he’d only been asleep for minutes when the bell chimed.
“Can you recall how you escaped?”
“Are you doing a mission? I can help too.” He looks ready to jump off his chair, but Steve smoothly steps in.
There’s no pattern to it, or none that Tony can discern.
He didn’t answer, just buried his nose in the short hairs at the back of Steve’s neck and inhaled deeply. What he was doing wasn’t fair to either of them, he knew that, but he couldn’t resist. His mind tried to reason with him, but his body couldn’t, wouldn’t obey.He knew though that if Steve turned to face him, tried to really kiss him, he would run.
“I said forget about it.“ Steve kept his eyes on his phone, but Tony saw the twitch of his jaw.
There are a few ticks that Steve has--tiny little tells that it took Tony years to figure out--and one is the slight flaring of his nostrils when he’s really upset. He does it now and Tony takes pity on him. He waggles his fingers and Steve takes the hint, curling their hands together.
“Tell him I’m out. Seriously, what is the point of having a DND protocol if no one’s going to respect it.”
“Prop bets.” Natasha shrugged her shoulders. “What? This is a once in a lifetime thing. You can’t expect us not to have fun with it.”
Steve doesn’t answer him, just turns his face into his shoulder, eyes shut tight. He can’t work out if it’s pain or pleasure that flickers across Steve’s face, but Tony guesses it’s a little both. There’s wetness gathering at the head of Steve’s dick and Tony uses that to his advantage, smearing it around. He works his hand quicker, adding a little more pressure to the flick of his wrist on the up stroke, until Steve’s gasping harshly.
“Hey,” he says.
Tony swallows past the sudden lump in his throat, a pit of regret deep in his stomach. He hates what he has to say next, but does it anyway.
Tony’s face flushed, the mention of it enough to make his stomach flip. “Jesus Christ,” he muttered, glancing up to make sure the room was still empty. “No. Of course not.”
“Peter…” Tony reaches out to him, but Peter rears back, shaking his head, tears pooling in his eyes.
“What do you mean, tried to tell you?”
“Easy, Rogers,” Tony said. “We’re not in a rush to finish.”
They need to do tests and check his blood and make sure there’s no radiation poisoning and his abilities are still there and none of it can wait. Tony hangs back as Bruce takes him down to the medical wing, let’s May hold his hand all the way there. There are too many people around so Tony—relieved, grateful, but exhausted—heads up to his room.
“That’s not going to happen,” Tony says.
“You sure?” he asked.
“Tony,” Steve whispered.
“30 minutes,” Tony reminds them, pulling up the report on one of the holographic screens. “Not a second more.”
“We’re all set.”
“Is it a possibility?”
“Where you going?” he says, through a mouthful of cheese. “Can I come?”
Instead of heading straight to bed that night, Tony had gone down to the communal kitchen, even though it was late, and found Steve standing there in his tux, bow-tie undone, gazing outside. Without a word, he gave Steve’s hand a gentle tug and led him back to his bedroom.
He stopped to take a big gulp of air but Tony put a hand over his mouth before he could continue.  “Nope, that’s it, you’re done. Thank you, very much, for that bit of hard earned wisdom, but Steve and I are fine. Now, go. Go, find your table. The speeches are starting.”
“See, that’s not so bad is it?” As her robe parted a little bit more, Steve noticed she was wearing black lace panties, the sight causing his pants to tighten. She placed small kisses along his jaw, behind his ear and Steve caught the light scent of her sandalwood perfume. The smell relaxed him even more and he let his eyes slip shut again.
Steve kept a firm hold on Tony with one hand while using the other to run through Tony’s hair. “We were watching you from the helicopter…you got caught in the reactionary blast…”
Loki looked over at Thor before facing Tony. “I don’t want him anywhere near me if I tell you.” He said quietly, referring to his irate brother.
Tony nodded back. He moved toward Steve then hesitated, backing away to lean up against the car.
Rhodey nodded but didn’t add anything. Tony could tell that his friend was waiting for him to say something more about Steve, but Tony couldn’t say out loud that he thought maybe he was in love in Steve; saying it out loud, even to Rhodey, would make everything all too real and terrifying.
Another pause lingered on for a few seconds. “…ah well…so you’re…not upset with me?”
“It looks like whatever this thing is, it’s in the basement.” Tony said to Steve quietly.
Steve stared at Tony, not really understanding his current demeanor before he shook his head. “Is it okay if I stay for dinner at least? I wanted to see Peter before going back.” He teased awkwardly.
“No, Bucky and I, when we were little, used to share a bed when we stayed over at each other’s house.” Steve answered casually as if sharing a bed with your childhood friend when you were kids was the same as sharing a bed now with another fully-grown adult.
“Hear what?”
Steve nodded without responding verbally. Tony took another deep breath, strangely finding enough courage to ask Steve out.
Tony sighed deeply as he turned to face Steve. “…I’m thinking about suspending Synergy indefinitely, just until we figure out how to keep everyone safe…”
Tony nodded as he pointed to Thor. “Are you ready to come back in?”
“Tony, you are the most kind-hearted person I know.” Rhodey genuinely offered, causing Tony to groan again.
“See. I told you I knew what I was doing,” Tony straightened out his shirt, “and I couldn’t secure a proper foothold, Rogers.” He added the snide comment before storming out of the arena, referring to Steve using his body weight to keep Tony from knocking him over. The living room scene pixeled as he exited the program.
Steve swallowed a lump in his throat as he adjusted his tie, confused that Tony was excited to see him even though he hadn’t heard from him.
“…I thought it would be cool to get it framed. You both look kind of awkward, but I thought it was cute.” Peter continued, unaware of the magnitude his gift had on both Tony and Steve.
“Stane,” Obadiah finally answered, pausing to listen to the other end of the receiver, “…yes, I also agree. I—” Obadiah rolled his eyes, but then smiled as he noticed some board members walking out of the lodge.
Fury barely flinched from Obadiah’s vitriol. “I can assure you that no one from
“I agree with Tony, Bruce. We know that Thanos is trying to replicate a core similar to this one for his super weapon. And if we let an outside company bid on the remnants of Synergy including the core—"
“Yeah, Rogers.” Clint was just behind Thor, “it was too much pressure being the best looking one in the group while you were out.”
Sam laughed. “Uh, no.” He had his arms crossed against his chest again sporting the same goofy grin from before.
Steve placed a hand on Sharon’s shoulder, making Tony cringe. “Do you mind? I haven’t seen Peter in a while.”
“Uh, no…aw, well.” Tony ran a hand through his hair. He waited a second or two before continuing.
Steve perched himself against his table and observed the interactions amongst his teammates. They were proving to be an interesting group, but in a cute way.
Hammer smirked at Tony as he sat down. “So, what can I get the national hero?” He waved for a waiter to serve their table, “seriously, though. How did your gadget figure out a cure for a newly developed virus? That seems impossible.”
Steve grimaced. It wasn’t as if he were completely opposed to swearing, although he never really did himself, but he figured since this was a professional environment, professionalism reigned supreme. He quickly learned that that wasn’t the case with Tony Stark.
Pepper picked up on it immediately. “What?”
As Fury finished his statement, the simulation began to pixelate, slowly revealing the suite. The rest of the team appeared near Steve, Tony, and Fury, and Pepper and Rhodey were trying to usher the board members standing above on a balcony out of the space. The team promptly marched out of the suite as they followed Fury who continued to give orders.
Tony stepped up to the projection to study the images. “Nothing?”
Steve held onto him before Tony slid off to lie next to him. “Sorry, Tony.” Steve repeated, shielding his eyes with one hand as he tried to catch his breath.
“Jesus, Banner. Aren’t you aware of your own strength?”
“While not illegal, would have definitely been morally uncouth, Rogers.” Tony tried to get Steve to loosen up with a grin, but it was obvious that the conversation had taken a serious turn.
The robot’s specs appeared on Tony’s phone as the screaming and shouting in the space grew. The robot had rushed the stage where the award statues were held, knocking over the sound equipment as it cornered the principal. Steve ran toward the stage to help the principal, but the robot swung around with its arm. Steve dodged it, tucking and rolling as he then got up to get the principal away from the stage.
“…Ned and me are going to enter the robot in the science competition.” Peter explained. He was sitting close to Tony at the table in the kitchen.
“I made reservations at a restaurant not too far away on the other side of the resort…we can use one of those private cars to get around…” Steve offered as he took a step toward Tony.
“This is why I can’t tell you anything.” Tony added with a sneer.
know, Synergy is whatever we want it to be—”
“Was a piece of shit, Steve!” Tony had whipped his body around as he threw the diary across the lab away from Steve, “I can’t believe you read this. This is an invasion of my privacy!”
“So, when are you supposed to show up for work?” Sam chugged his glass of champagne before pouring himself another. He motioned toward Steve to do the same. Steve smiled, knowing he should celebrate his achievements more often, and reciprocated the act.
Sincerely,
“How long is Peter staying over at May’s?” Steve took Tony’s hand as he let himself be guided.
Tony grimaced as he tried to smile, watching helplessly as the elevator doors closed on Pepper.
“…I…uh…” Steve laughed again, rubbing a hand through his hair before he settled again, “…I...love you, Tony.”
Tony stared at Steve before turning slightly to hide his expression which had twisted up with his emotions. They stayed like this for some time, with Tony struggling with whether he should just give up and leave.
The staffer nodded back slowly again before backing out of the room, thanking Obadiah once more for participating in the conference. Obadiah groaned loudly as soon as the door closed. He then placed the briefcase he was carrying carefully on top of the table. He inhaled deeply, reminding himself to remain calm, thankful he had made it to the island without any incident. He took a moment, breathing deeply, his hands trembling as he opened the briefcase.
Steve laughed nervously. “I think I’m just okay, but thank you for the compliment, Peter…”
“Uh, nice to meet you…Thor.” Steve responded, not quite sure how to seriously address someone who had chosen to be referred to as the Norse god.
Natasha reached over to pinch him one last time, grinning in the process. Clint yelped as he nearly jumped out of his chair.
Tony licked Steve slowly one last time, getting him to the point where he knew Steve was close before straddling his body. He smiled downward at Steve, rubbing his hands along his chest before leaning downward.
“Of course, Rogers. I wouldn’t miss embarrassing you.” Before Steve could ask for an explanation, Tony side stepped next to him, pulled out his phone, and snapped a picture of the two of them. He had his hand around Steve’s waist, instinctively pulling him tight.
Steve stared at him intently, making Tony feel anxious, before turning to exit the space. “Okay, just call me if you need anything, okay?”
"…besides…think about the emotional trauma you'll potentially be putting Peter through by constantly trotting temporary romantic partners through his life without a care in the world. Do you really want him to think that's normal?"
“Anthony.”
But Steve didn’t seem to notice as he began talking to Tony about Synergy and Sam and Shuri’s upcoming wedding. They talked for some time before Tony thought he should ask about Sharon to ensure Steve that he was trying at their friendship, although it still hurt to know that he most likely missed his chance with Steve.
Peter giggled before his face grew serious. “J.A.R.V.I.S., run the sequence, please!” He shouted.
Steve watched her as Sharon leaned in close. “The people working on your project are really nice. Tony seems more down to earth than you give him credit for.”
Fury nodded before quickly following Agent Hill out of the room.
Tony patted Steve on the chest before walking over to the group. Steve smiled as he watched Tony walk away.
He found a police officer near the entrance of the building, scratching her head as she communicated with her bomb team inside. Tony walked up to her with his hand outstretched, but she didn’t take it.
Steve sighed again, frustrated with the entire situation.
Steve nodded again before swiping a few times on his tablet, too annoyed with Tony to engage in small talk.
Tony inhaled as Steve kissed him, moving their bodies back to their positions from before. Steve held onto Tony’s legs as he let Tony rub his cock. He gasped as he felt himself getting hard, rocking forward into Tony’s hand.
Steve backed away somewhat to clear his throat. The more Tony kept rubbing his hip, the more he wanted to feel up against Tony’s body, rubbing himself as he let himself get caught up in the moment.
“I got Pepper on it.”
“Also,” Steve started, “if you want, considering you need someone to babysit…I can watch Peter for you when you’re out with Pepper…” He tried to look cool about it, but he was sure his expression exposed how awkward he was beginning to feel about volunteering.
Thanos stared before grinning once more. “Good. Let’s try this again.”
Thor leaned inward as his voice dropped. “Loki, I do not understand the animosity you have toward me…we have not spoken in a such a long time…” His expression was calm, yet poignant.
“Wait, you know I’m asking you to marry me, right?” He smiled weakly, disheveled from the quick kiss and trying to get his thoughts in order.
“Oh well, you should really get your stories straight, Rogers. Sharon said a few.” Tony corrected, turning away from both Steve and Bruce.
Tony sat up straight in the bed. Steve sighed. “If I had known you when you were my age—”
“Tony—,” Steve hesitated before entering the penthouse. “May I come in?”
Steve shrugged, still leaning. “No.” He answered sternly.
“Indeed, and while the device has done some good in the past, most significantly stopping a virus from spreading widely, it’s difficult seeing this project moving forward after this…”
Steve took his time before addressing Tony; he could feel Tony pulling away from him again and figured it was probably best to talk in the morning.
Despite the terrible pain he was experiencing from his injuries, a stupid grin crept up onto Tony’s face before he answered.
“Okay…” Steve responded as he waited for Tony, slowly dragging the word out, clearly fearing the worst.
“This is really great so far.” Bruce had unintentionally let out, immediately regretting it and hoping he didn’t sound desperate.
“I think everyone should trust what our team is capable of,” Steve glanced at Tony before looking directly at the pool, “I know I do.”
“I need Romanov and Barton at S.H.I.E.L.D.,” Fury turned to face the group as they entered the hallway, “the rest of the team I need you all at the medical clinic.” Natasha and Clint followed Fury into an elevator as Tony turned to face the rest of the team.
That stupid grin crept up once again on Tony’s face, but he really couldn’t do anything about it.
Steve nodded. “Oh, if it’s too much trouble, I understand—”
Tony waved Steve off with a laugh. “Just hold on, Rogers. Watch what it does.”
Sam’s eyes grew big as he gawked at Steve. “Cap! Why didn’t you say anything?”
sequences…then…”
“What?” Steve responded sharply, confused by Tony’s comments.
“I’ll keep a look out for your guys’ project.” He gave the boys a thumbs up before walking over to another project stand.
“So how do you feel about Synergy? It’s great isn’t it?” Bruce barely looked back at Steve as he continued to whirl around, checking a tablet as he studied each console.
“It’s probably not even a big deal, Cap.” Sam smiled weakly.
The moment felt superbly intimate, but Tony wasn’t sure what his next move should be. He was close to Steve on the couch, but not really close enough to kiss him. Also, he wasn’t sure if he should try; something about the morning after the party was still bothering him and he was afraid of misreading the mood again.
Steve groaned. “Tony, please! Stop that.” He nearly exclaimed which caught Tony off guard.
As this story begins to wind down, I just wanted to thank everyone who's been reading for sticking with this story. Also, I'll add this after the last chapter, but this story is only the first in a series installment focused on this alternative universe's Steve and Tony, so stayed tuned!
“I would love to, Tony.”
“You know, Tony. I was thinking—and just hear me out before you protest.” She held her hands up in defense almost immediately before holding the elevator’s door open.
But there was something about Steve’s smile and the way he looked at him when they were together. It had the usual hint of Steve’s agreeable personality, but something about it suggested something else. As the elevator ran up the core of the tower to the penthouse, Tony smiled as he thought about Steve possibly “liking” him and that maybe he did have a chance.
Sam nodded with a sincere expression on his face as he listened.
“…I don’t know what I’m going to do about Obie. This shit feels like its way over my head…” Tony groaned as he put his head into his hands. Steve hesitated before placing a hand on his back. He gently rubbed as he continued to wait for Tony to finish.
“Yes, indeed. Tony Stark and his Synergy team swooped in at the eleventh hour to save a visiting diplomat and needless to say, the country possibly avoided
“Ready when you are, Tony.”
“So…” Tony started, “he didn’t say anything?” He was standing next to Bruce and Thor.
Tony couldn’t believe the progress he was making with Steve. He knew he was pushing his limits, but Steve seemed to be enjoying it. And, although he insistently teased his lab mate for preferring to stay in to going out most nights, Tony could easily picture himself spending one of those nights with Steve.
He thought about the way his new lab mate had sketched the image of the vibranium core. As he moved from console to console, Tony had noticed out of the corner of his eye Steve sketching and notating in his notebook. Tony took a moment to observe his mannerisms as Steve illustrated the core, taking note of the care Steve made with every stroke of his pencil.
“…ugh…I really messed up with Tony…”
“How did you get up here?” Tony cheerfully greeted back.
Tony’s eyes lit up. This string of messages from Steve was the flirtiest his lab mate had ever been with him. He took a deep breath, commanding himself to take it easy.
Tony looked grim as he glared back at Steve, too angry to respond verbally. Steve reciprocated the expression, obviously too angry to clarify. To both, it felt as if they were the only people in room, but of course the entire team was still witnessing their exceedingly tensed argument.
Tony, who was quite drunk himself from the Jörmungandr, had figured it would be easier to have Steve stay over at his place before driving him home in the morning. He wasn’t planning on anything beyond that, really; he was honestly trying to make sure that Steve did get home in one piece, but it would be easier for him to do so if he slept a few hours first.
“That’s completely understandable…but please don’t worry about it…the team’s on it…you have to get better…” he looked away before looking at Steve again, “…uh, I talked to Bucky and he doesn’t mind if I take care of you…until you get better…”
Tony shook his head as he crossed his arms. He kept his eyes trained on Bruce to avoid accidentally looking back at Steve.
Steve chuckled. “Why would I mind?”
Steve turned his head a bit. “Tony, I know that. I want to help out and I would like to get to know Peter better…but if you don’t want me to—”
“So,” Bruce started, wringing his hands together,” I really hate to do this, Tony…but I mixed up the dates for this trip…”
He leaned forward, drawing his knees up to his chest, crying to himself as the memories continued to torture him. The whole night had been a complete disaster.
“Mr. Stane?”
Steve nodded again as he felt himself getting close from just rubbing up against the bed. He reached downward to touch himself, moving a hand past the band of his briefs, all the while still sucking on Tony, almost forgetting which movement to use as he felt his own body giving in.
Tony ruminated on the possibility before pressing the button to the lobby.
J.A.R.V.I.S. went through Tony’s schedule until the computer came upon a press event that Tony had forgotten about.
He whipped out his phone to send a quick message to Steve.
Fury shrugged, much like Bruce had done. “I made a deal with Stark. He doesn’t meddle in the government dealings and I don’t get in the way of the lab work. It keeps the peace.” He ended with a leer, crossing his arms.
“No, destroy it.” Tony repeated as he walked away from the huddle. Bruce turned to Shuri, visibly pleading for some backup, but Shuri looked defeated, hanging her head low with a heavy sigh.
For the board presentation, Tony and Bruce had created a scenario in which the team needed to use the Synergy device to create a mobile medical clinic to save a few people from a car crash on an interstate highway.
Thor managed to get along with everyone; he even got into a long-drawn-out conversation with Steve about his military service, interests in art, and plans related to his law degree outside of Synergy. Steve appreciated the company as he was still getting use to the various personalities of his teammates.
Tony turned around slowly, grinning as he waited for Steve to elaborate. “Oh yeah?”
Tony watched Steve work out of the corner of his eye. His lab partner, although probably focused on his work, acted as if he was the only person in the lab. Ever since that simulation, Steve would only speak to Tony on a need-to basis.
Tony laughed back. “I have noticed it, but…honestly…and this might sound silly given the situation…that’s one of the things I appreciate about you, Steve…you’re just trying to be helpful…”
Tony laughed again, moving side to side, hugging his body as if his sides were on the verge of splitting from laughter.
Tony couldn’t stop himself from expressing how surprised he was by Steve’s response. “Really? Uh, I mean…that’s great!”
“Tony, please stop doing this…”
Steve pushed downward as his hands traveled up Tony’s torso then his chest, rubbing both of his nipples. Steve kissed Tony deeply before moving his head to lick one of Tony’s nipples. Tony couldn’t help himself as he moaned even louder, feeling Steve’s tongue swirl around slowly against his skin.
Steve swallowed. “Um, no…”
Obadiah stared at Tony who returned the expression.
Clint took a step toward Tony to turn and face the group slightly, stretching a hand out. “Okay, so I get all that,” he interjected before Tony could respond, “but is there something we can do in the meantime? I don’t think I need to remind everyone that we’re dealing with a dangerous nutjob.”
