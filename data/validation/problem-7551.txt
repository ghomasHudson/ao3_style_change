He does it anyway.
"Lot of bugs?"

' Marcus Brutus' name, exactly, scrawled across Julius Caesar's wrist after the death of his daughter, the beginning of his descent into madness.
"That man was the devil," Tony gives in, laughs shakily. "Gave me a C minus on Dummy's initial mainframe."
Tony's hands drop from the controls, completely nerveless, as Clint's voice breaks, as the younger man keeps going. "He kept telling Steve how he was tearing us apart but who hasn't picked up-"
"As long as you need, Wanda."
Steve readies his shield, done with this already. "You

, his mind screams.
"Is this because of Germany?" Peter suddenly asks, and Kamala makes a noise of distress in response to his tone or the topic, Tony can't tell. "Because I messed up? Because I followed your orders perfectly in Canada, I stopped that bomb-"
"This is Barnes' blood here.
Vision is perfectly polite to Bruce when Tony brings him home, having only met the man once. Rhodey is a little more enthusiastic but cautious after registering Tony's low mood. Nothing could compare to Natasha, though, whose jaw actually drops when the wayward scientist walks into the room. She gathers herself quickly enough but its too late; Tony know she is internally losing her damn mind.
Tony understands. Legacy is a powerful thing. They meet each other's eyes across the table and for a moment everything is very still. Then Tony breaks it, looking to the side with a shrug. "Report to Agent Romanov tomorrow morning for training. She'll assess your skills and we'll go from there. Welcome to the Avengers, Wasp."
And Nat - Natasha who is so terrifyingly competent but walks around the halls like a ghost. She sees things in this compound, memories and nightmares that Tony can't understand. He is still so miserably angry with her but Tony won't let her fade away like this.
"Wait," he whispers. "I know this road."
"Stark's always ready to compromise himself," Sam says, but there's no judgment there. "To fix his mistakes. To do what's right. Don't pretend you don't know something about that, Mr. I Went AWOL To Save My Best Friend. Twice."
"How so?" Natasha asks, always eager to hear tales of normal, well-adjusted childhoods.
Tony, still not looking, stabbed at his digital display angrily. "Can we skip this part? Okay? I know I messed up. I know I'm pushing you. I know you don't like it and you want me to stop. I - I get it. I mean, the movie nights, I'm not stopping that. People like them. But I'll leave you alone. I'll," he inhaled deeply, like he was steadying himself. "I'll be patient."
. "Then I'm getting it. The victims of the Winter Soldier are not the only ones who suffered. James Barnes is just as much a victim as we are. He wasn't himself-"
"Bingo," Rhodes agreed, then rolled his eyes. "Plus a little bit of an inventing high from the alien tech and a dash of nursing his bruised ego: Rocket absolutely schooled his ass at tech. So he got a little crazy. You know how he is. All that being said, Cap? Honestly, I'm glad you said what you did."
BANNER:
He shakes himself hard and glares at the ceiling. "That's not helping. Don't talk to me, okay? Just - I don't want to know you're there."
There was a crackle of static and then:
, you'd still be alive, and it would be worth it. I wanted to run and hide, Sheriff. Mend horseshoes and tools for the rest of my life and drink away the coin it got me and sing to you when you locked me up for the night. That would've been a good life, more than I deserved. But it wasn't enough. And I should have known better. It's all my fault."
Dimly he feels T'Challa's hand pass from his wrist to his shoulder to his cheek before falling away. "You are a good man, Tony Stark."
"Donald Gill was taken by HYDRA."
"Of course," Donald spits. "Got to keep those hands squeaky clean, huh?"
"No," Steve protested, almost on auto-pilot. Stark's words were bouncing around in his head. "You didn't know what was going to happen. You didn't pull the trigger. You're not the one who killed him."
“Me?” Tony nearly snarled. “Look, I didn’t not go because I’m lazy, or unmotivated, or narcissitic or whatever else you and Rogers and Fury think of me-“
"I can't believe you got taken out by Frosty the Snowman. How's it hanging, Donnie?"
"Before even Ultron happened. Since SHIELD fell. That's...that's a long time, don't you think?"
NATASHA:
"Tensions were running high and things looked bad, Barton, real bad," Rhodey adds. "Then Barnes goes Winter Soldier and kills half his guards? Forget it. Nobody knew about the brainwashing, nobody knew anything about Zemo, it was just an insane HYDRA ghost and his enabler that, oh yeah, dresses up in the American flag."
his father says, shaking his hand out.
The first wave of the attack had been hard without them, the Avengers unaccustomed and unprepared for the aliens' advanced weaponry. They'd beaten them back with no small struggle and Tony Stark had been working day and night churning out better equipment for everyone and preparing his Iron Legion to fight alongside the SHIELD agents that Steve Rogers had personally trained.
Tony?
Steve slides the phone off of T'Challa's copy of the Accords and tugs them closer to him. There are three logos on the first page: the giant 'SA' on top, the UN's globe to the left, and the arrow-A of the Avengers to the right. "But who decides if the action was unconscionable and/or reckless? The council. And who's to stop their egos and agendas from finding us guilty?"
“Gives us something to look forward to when we win,” Steve shoots back.
It had sounded like everything the newspapers ever accused him of, narcissism and ego and vanity, but how else could Tony properly express how violated he felt sometimes, thinking of all those night he laid in Steve’s arms while all the while Steve knew?)
Where two weeks ago this would have gotten him an instant reply his inbox remains silent and Tony tucks the tablet away with a grimace. "Just finalizing Rhodey's date night this weekend. Fourteen chaperones, buddy. It's like prom, or at least what the movies told me prom is like."
Peter's eyes grow comically large. "I - really - no way - I - sure, Mr. Stark!"
Natasha's hand is so tight on his shoulder Tony is actually worried she might try to break him to put him out of commission. The commander warns "If there is one hint of Iron Man-"
"I'd have to speak to the whole team," Tony says slowly. "And unfortunately Ms. van Dyne won't be at the compound until Thursday. But we'll be sure to let you know. If I could be so bold," he says on the next breath. "As to borrow Agent Carter for a moment?"
Waking up not knowing where he is is a common feeling for Steve, but he's gotten past it over the last few years. So when he jerks awake, panicking and swinging at the ceiling, it takes him longer than he'd like to settle. He's in his room, the sun's light through the window not strong enough yet to do more than blur the edges of the shadows, and nothing's out of place - but the shrill ringing coming from his desk.
“Photographic,” Tony finishes. He takes a swallow of his drink and lets it burn all the way down, finds his lips curling up against his will. “Sucks, doesn’t it?”
"Always," Tony promises. "Fry, have you landed any hits on Malik, yet?"
They made mistakes and Tony will obsess over them later, watch the footage FRIDAY has saved until he can see it when he closes his eyes. But they can fix this. They can make this work.
He could barely get the last words out, could barely look at Tony, even though he could feel the other man’s steady gaze burning a hole in the side of his head. A hot wash of shame rushed through Steve, that he lost control like that on a man who seemed to have plenty of problems of his own. On letting someone else
But God, does this feel right, Tony alive under his hands, the faintest hint of a pulse in Tony’s lips where they meet Steve. It feels right when he kisses back. Together, he thinks, or not at all. “Don’t be,” he whispers back, and Tony’s lips curve against his.
"You don't know the difference!" she shouts. They both pull up short, staring wide-eyed at one another, as the echoes fade away.
"If I go out with you, I can make sure they don't send you and T'Challa into some death trap just to save a few of their own men. And they're not going to kill me, Honey-bear. I realize the threat of UN sanctions isn't very scary, but these people aren't stupid. It's all going to be fine."
Peter nods, smiles softly. "That's the goal."
“You gonna stick around?” Sam asked. “You have to see the President’s speech at least; I’m pretty sure you’ll cry.”
Steve hadn't even realized they were watching the same screen; Fury has mostly been preoccupied with watching a barely lucid Madame Hydra recover from her emergency surgery. "What we need, sir?" Fury looks over his shoulder so Steve is just in his peripheral vision and Steve makes sure to sneer just for him. "Who's 'we'? Tony's team? Mine? All of us? Or maybe just you."
"I never said anything of the sort," T'Challa says, almost gently.
But he's not losing the damn war. Not with his friends on the line.
She smiles, and it is razor-sharp as ever, but it isn't a no. "I feel like I should be waving pom-poms."
In his mind, Tony widens it even further. A snowflake for Donnie, a spider for Peter, the lightning bolt that Kamala has incorporated into the early drafts of her suit. An eagle for Coulson, an all-seeing eye for Fury.
Donald watches the line, subconsciously starts to breath in time to the steady beat, and slowly relaxes. "No. It looks - normal." There is unmistakable relief in his voice. "I'm uh, sorry about-" He gestures behind him. Tony shrugs.
"What do you want?"
"If you're agreeing to the treatment," Barnes says.
But James, instead of beginning absurd bargaining as Steven expected, dropped his eyes down and to the left. “Yes. Well, about that, Steven…”
And Tony has always known that Steve was - is - not stitched up quite right. Botched jobs, half-finished ones still bleeding all over the place. Tony isn’t quite healed up either. And he remembers, painfully acute, not telling Steve about Ultron because he couldn’t even bear the thought of pushing him away.
Twenty-five years later, Tony may finally understand at least one thing about his father.
"Donnie, hopefully, will be ready in a few months," Tony says, lies really but that's something he shoves down. "For now, he still needs a bit more time to sort things out. Hope has already agreed." And wasn't that a pleasant conversation. Hope still has a business to run on the West Coast, so she doesn't mind staying on the reserves for the time being, but he knows it galled her to be told once more to wait. "Black Panther is technically already on reserves. He's called upon when needed, just like the rest of you will be."
"Barnes' serum should protect his brain from the wear and tear, but his brainwashing is also decades long, instead of just months. The work we've done with Donnie - multiply that by about say, fifty times, and you've got the most optimistic look-out. If he even says yes."
"I know you do, Stone. That's the icing on top."
"The Captain has been contacted. Ready for extraction," the man says, that strange blackness creeping out again.
"I miss the red and gold. I remember watching you fly up into the portal on TV. It was the coolest thing I'd ever seen." Kamala taps on the glass then spins on her heel towards Tony before something catches her eye. "Is that Captain America's shield? Why do you have it?"

Peter inhales. Deep breaths, like he's steeling himself for a long jump off a high rise. The exhales shake a bit on their way out. "It wasn't my fault," he finally says.
Natasha looks absurdly pleased and he rolls her eyes at her as the agent agrees with his demands and hangs up. "Stop that," he tells the redhead, but she just clambers up on a table and swings her feet like a little kid. "Here," and then he hands her the transcript of the call. "I told FRIDAY to send the call to Rhodey; she'll change the settings to you if you ask."
He reaches for his arc reactor, the final piece, but its not where he left it. "You don't need it," Howard hisses. "They don't need you. Didn't he prove that? Didn't I tell you, boy?"
Another long pause and then: "The mist is frightening my men, Avengers. They say they see things in it. If I order you to attack the perpetrator, will you?"
"Always with the hands, Tonio," Sharon snarks, wrenching her elbow when they're inside. "What do you want? Wait, no, me first. Give me this job, Tony. My career is in shambles after helping Steve-"
T'Challa comes by while on a diplomatic visit and does not say anything when Tony doesn't join in on training with Vision and a reconstructed War Machine. He doesn't have to.
and exiting the room quickly. Tony turns on the king. "Kind of a dick move, highness."
"We need to talk," Steve tells him. He thought he would feel relieved, but the Accords in his hand have pulled his heart to the ground.
“Well, he’s helping too much,” Sam replied bluntly. “He’s pushing. Steve hates that. He think it’s pity, and if there’s anything Steve Rogers doesn’t want to be, it’s pitied. The movies, the music, the constant barrage of pop culture references-“
And just before he wakes up he sees a shield coming for his chest and Tony thinks
"My powers are still really wiggy. I can't go out in public like this, but I can't not be at my family's funeral. Dr. Banner said the only thing he could think of was drugs and to ask you instead. I - I don't want drugs. I want to remember."
"Is this your sales pitch, cuz?"
“Then stop trying to fix me!” Steve shouted. “Just-“ He shoved Tony’s hand, clutching whatever Tony had tried to show him, back into the smaller boy’s chest. “Just leave me alone.”
You know what?
"I remember it being mostly you and Clint. I claim no responsibility."
, Natasha mused.
"It's okay," Steve said, and realized that it really was.
"Keep at it. If whatever made Osborn turn into the Fantastic Flying Freak has been through the government we needed to know yesterday. Terrigenesis to Screen 3, please."
"But I'm not - I can't. I'll do everything else I can possibly do, but I'm not going to call. I'm giving that choice to you. The smartest people I know - the best. You won't hesitate because you're angry or guilty. You'll do the right thing. That's Steve's number, okay. He'll be there if you need him, like he said. And if he needs us, the call will redirect to you, Rhodes." Tony takes a deep breath, turns the letter over in his hands so he can't see Steve's writing but not meeting Rhodey's eyes. "Please," he finishes on an exhale.
did more."
Donnie laughs brokenly. "Jesus fuck, Tony, look at me." He splays his hands wide and and ice webs up between the digits. "I'm not even safe in my own head."
"'Sorry about all the murder!'"
"Loud and clear, kid," Tony says, straightening up. "We just worry. First-class worriers here. Perks of the job. Or did you miss my late-night chats at Kamala's bedside and the five million version of braces Rhodey's never going to use or Clint's inability to not feed us or Hope's love affair with bandages?"
For a moment, it feels like putting on a costume, like it used to whenever the Army would trot him out in front of the troops. Captain America seems so unreal, so unreachable. He thinks,
"Sadly, he's not joking," Rhodey interjects. "I have never seen the man so well-fed. Stay with us, Laura."
Natasha hasn't spoken since he laid the papers in front of her but now she flips the pen to grip it tight in her hand, so tight her knuckles turn white, before looking up at the assembled Avengers. "Why me?" she asks, her voice trying and failing to modulate itself, eliminate the tell-tale quiver.
Never has Tony been so happy to see Ty so furious. "Just the one?" his former best friend snarls.
"Why does it frighten you?" Rhodes shot back.
Tony smiled, bright as could be. "Don't sweat it. We caught it all on video. Two million hits on YouTube, Cap, you should look it up."
"Of course, sir," Vision replies promptly. His voice is calm, smooth, no hint of judgment. When Tony risks a glance up the synthezoid inclines his head before rising from the table. "If need of the Captain arises I will make the call immediately." He exits the room to the soft sound of Tony's sigh of relief.
"I can't protect you," she says, and Tony knows who she has found.
"Buck-"
HE STOLE MY SHIELD:
Rogers. I watched you at the airport, blowing up planes and trucks and each other like you had good sense. That was the team I built, those were the people I trusted to keep the world safe. And when push came to shove, you fell apart. You couldn't hold it together. You forgot your duty. So yeah, I'm playing this a little close to the chest."
He accepts the letter when its handed back over to him. "FRIDAY?" he prompts.
"I think you're overestimating my commitment to your cause," Steve remarks dryly, although the truth is if Fury does make a move towards Diamondback, he will step in. No matter what she says, part of it is his fault for not watching her better.
Thank you all for being so patient, this chapter was incredibly hard for me.
"Yeah, you do," she tells him. "Good thing he's got you, then."
"Tony-" Jan said, getting to her feet as Steve took a threatening step towards the armored teen.
Steven shrugged, sheathing his sword. It had been a good fight; their kingdom protected and King Arthur triumphant against the evil that had threatened its borders. He was never one to dream of battle, only to do what was right. To be a Knight of the Round Table was to be fulfilled completely, for Steve. “You know me, James. I can do this all day.”
Malik said Terrigenesis is unstable, but perfect. Tony thinks it's simply out of control. HYDRA has created something out of a thousand broken pieces of other failed science experiments and none of them are smart enough to piece it back together. So they're experimenting on innocent civilians. Making the entire world their lab rat.
She looks in on Madame Hydra and her lip curls in disgust. "I think I'm done here, actually." She pivots on her heel and starts heading down the hallway and Steve watches her leave. Her words have a ring of truth in them, but just barely. He does care, and maybe he has been lying down for Fury, maybe it was nice for five seconds to take orders again, to be the bullet instead of the shooter, but this isn't something that can't be changed. He isn't something that can't be changed. Accords or not, the world needs the Avengers fighting together on this.
Indeed by the time they make it back to the compound the next day, news has spread fast that Secretary Ross has quietly resigned from his post, leaving President Ellis scrambling for a replacement.
"People are stupid," Tony says bluntly. "Of course they'll get mad. But if you're asking if its okay for a superhero to do it? Yes, still very okay. The Accords didn't make us mindless attack dogs, Kamala."
Bucky remains frozen.
"No," Aamir says promply, while Kamala immediately answers "Yes."
"Don't worry," she tells Tony as they head towards the plane Chad has finally allowed to land, Tony grabbing up Clint's feet. "I read him his rights before I knocked him out."
He knows what he’d choose, every time. He also knows he can’t do this without Steve.
"Natasha-"
He said that it's not your fault btw. Don't blame yourself for what happened.
“Thank you,” Steve whispers. He reaches out, wraps a hand around the edge of the shield. “You didn’t have to.”
I think i'm going to sign. I can't go to jail i need to be there for my family. i still don't agree with them but maybe this way i can make them better for us. make so you guys can come home one day.
“Oh, I’ll always be right here,” Tony says, sarcastically cheerful when Steve turns to find him mowing down a line of Chitauri. “Right by your side. Even if it kills me.” The last bit is delivered in a grumble, because everything is still not fixed and some days are hard for both of them. But they are getting better. Steve stands at Tony’s back on the battlefield and knows he is right where he belongs. He’s determined to never forget it again.
The happiness that surges through him when the board approves his new prosthesis design for public consumption is so unfamiliar that Tony actually mistakes it for a panic attack when it first happens. He lets the board members exit the room and then reaches out.
." He had got to stop programming his AIs with so much sass.
“This is a school?” the older man asked quietly, looking around.
"Now we have, and it's not perfect, but," Tony tells her with a smile turned sad at the corners. "I'd like to think that every time we gain a little more trust. Every time we prove ourselves a bit more capable. I won't - I don't want anyone to walk all over us, I never want to see my teammates in another jail cell for the rest of my life, but I'd make the same decision I made back then again, even if I knew what would happen later. Because I am
"Fury here wants a sit-rep," Tony says to the group, all fake cheer. "Well, post sit-rep. Apparently he was off in Timbuktu during the civil war."
Avengers assemble.
"Well," Tony says, blank for a moment, then he grins. "The world's a busy place, Secretary Lukin. No doubt they can pull off both."
“You know we can’t go back,” Tony whispers. Steve stiffens in his arms, and then relaxes all at once like a great weight has been lifted off of him.
"Rhodey, no. Jim," Tony had pleaded. "Come on, I wouldn't be alive if it weren't for you. This was bad luck. The exact right angle. Or wrong angle, I guess."
"No one's asking you, too, Carter."
"Not really," Peter says, embarassed. "I know a little about data entry, but she says that this one number kept popping up - this one, here. And all of this was under something called Project Samson. Mr. Osborn had been working on it for months before the - the accident, Harry said he was obsessed. Tony? You have this face right now. I'm not a fan of it. What is it?"
“I’m fine,” Anthony said. “Merls patched me up good.”
"Nowhere to shake when your royal smugness is taking up the whole room," Tony snipes back with a tired smile. T'Challa accepts it with good grace. "Canada specifically wanted a non-American there. Apparently the former KGB super-spy and the robot don't count. Thanks for doing this."
"Let's go sit with Sam," he suggested, and Tony stood. "Where is his, by the way? He doesn't have a bean bag."
Tony scrolls through his phone again, handing it back over. "This is Kamala Khan. She inhaled a fatal dose of something called Terrigen, but by some miracle managed to live through it. Problem is, it's rapidly destabilizing her DNA, faster than its repairing itself."
"Ah," Tony says in commiseration, nodding his head sagely. "Far be it from me to suppress your inner-

"I thought you'd already picked JOCASTA?"
And besides: he's the only person left in the world who really knew either of his parents. This is what they would have wanted. And
She turns to stare into the room again, muttering something under her breath. Her hand is trembling slightly and Tony gives in, encircling her wrist with his fingers, knowing if Natasha wants him off she'll have him disabled in seconds.
"I'm on the roof, what's the problem?"
Tony doesn't know what he means. Tony is moving through molasses.
"You'll be the liaison to the council. Confer with them on missions, tell them where we're most needed and where we shouldn't interfere," Tony explains again calmly.
Send."
He sighed as he rounded the corner near the Robodojo and headed toward the TimeFog. He shouldn’t have shouted at Tony like that. He should’ve just taken the tech and done what he’d done with everything Tony had shoved at him in the last week – ignore it. Stark would lose interest in making Steve his project sooner or later.
Bruce nods again, a bit more sure this time, but something in him is hesitant, enough for Tony to quirk an eyebrow. "There's something else, though. Something that might make you feel better." Slowly, Bruce reaches forward, turning page over page in the file, until he gets to one on which Howard's old notes have been transcribed. Bruce taps at the page. Howard had written in vague detail about the VitaRay there, not enough so that anyone could ever reconstruct it, but its general purpose and effect on a serum-enhanced being. "You see this bit, in blue ink? There's more, a lot more, and I asked FRIDAY to do some analysis. This ink wasn't developed by Bic
"Can you maintain that?" Steve asks, already turning towards Wanda, acknowledging Cloak's slightly-offended 'yes' with a nod before pulling his youngest teammate into a hug. "I'm going to miss you. Keep the phone on you, alright?" He already has Wanda's new number plugged into the phone that was meant for Tony. "I'll call as soon as I can."
The talking heads on TV are talking about the 'controversial' decision, what it means for the fugitives still at large, if the public will ever accept Hawkeye back into the fold when the screen suddenly cuts to black and FRIDAY says "
NATASHA:

"I thought you wanted to save your world, Captain. Others in my organization would rather run around bending people to their will, but I prefer the direct approach. Straight to the source. You are imperfect, and yet also our greatest hope. Give it to me, a final sacrifice. After today you will be obsolete anyway." The whip snaps and he moves again, rolling into position and unclipping his shield, preparing to throw.
“You must – you don’t seem to like him much,” Steve ventured cautiously. Tony raised one sardonic eyebrow that he had seen on his own Tony’s face a thousand times. He didn’t hate it any less on this older, bitter Tony either.

But Tony does. He knows. His father had always been so desperate for Steve to come back. Because Steve was good and kind and the best man he'd ever known, and because Howard had

He's forgotten that guy. Maybe Diamondback was right, and he has been swinging at shadows without purpose. Maybe he buried it somewhere - somewhere cold: with Bucky, in a Siberian bunker, in the bottom of the ocean. But he could try, he could always try. He could do this all day, once.

"Sounds an awful lot like I'm appealing to the one good bone in your body, Caesar," Tony slings back, grimacing when he realizing the thousand different ways he's now opened the conversation for Tiberius and his fratboy humor.
“Oh, Anthony,” Maria sighed. “We never blamed you. You need not get yourself killed to make Arthur proud. A finer heir could not be asked for.”
"If they saved some, it would be easier to recreate than relying on notes," Bruce finishes for him. "This could form the Erskine basis of the Terrigenesis formula. It
"I don't see why he would leave," T'Challa replies, and for a split second a shadow crosses his face before his eyes refocus. "Despite what you may think, he is a good leader. He won't leave his team."
"Jameson heard a tip you were here," Peter explains, wincing. He works weekends at the paper, scraping together extra cash for his aunt. Tony's got to get this kid a paying internship at Stark. "Sent me."
"You're sadder," is the first thing Bucky says. Steve jerks a little in surprise, not expecting that. "You've always been a brooder, but the fight with the others, it really took it out of you, huh? I've never seen you like that, Steve."
But he leaves the house feeling like he's on the way to fixing it.
"And you expect me to believe Scott wasn't right by his side?" Hope challenges, leaning forward in her chair. "Scott's a hero, Mr. Stark, he was born to help those who couldn't help themselves."
"Nothing I shouldn't have expected him to," Tony answers evenly. "Updates?"
"Iron Man," Gwen breathes when she gets in front of him. He flips the faceplate up and steadies her with a hand to her shoulder. Her smile is as brighter than the million flashbulbs surrounding them. "You weren't going to leave before I said thank you, were you?"
"Then you'll be turning in, too, of course."
"Sharon?" Tony splutters. "As in, aided and abetted international fugitives Sharon Carter?"
"You done with drinking, playboy?"
He would be more appreciative of the gesture if Steve weren't being so blatantly manipulated into this state, though.
"Well, there's no one like Tony, but..." Steve jokes, and Bucky chuckles. "I miss you, Buck."
Tony winces, looking down at his feet and scuffing them against the ground. Uncharitably, he thinks of Steve, the young harsh Steve that had just come out of the ice that would have sneered at anyone who dared imply they wanted gratitude for 'doing their duty.' Dear God, that Steve was an ass. "Thank you," he says, looking at Peter. "Maybe too little, too late, but you're getting it anyway. Thank you."
Natasha smiles, continuing the thread of the conversation, and the two chat about nothing while Tony stares out the window as the greater landmass of mainland Europe comes into view. He tries to line it all up in his head, the information on Barnes and how best to present it to the council before they take it to the courts, but its all jumbled up in his head.
That is Pepper's voice, and his mother's, and Steve's. Tony is eight and twenty-one and forty and forty-six. His pulse beats like a hummingbird at his neck and he can hear the thrum of it all through the bunker. Tony is eight, trying to keep his hero Bucky Barnes calm. Tony is twenty-one, and Bucky's cries cannot be heard over his own. Tony is forty and locked up tight in his suit, cannot help. Tony is forty-six and shoves his fist through Bucky's heart.
"One more thing," he whispers before he changes his mind. "FRIDAY, 121691 to Parker's phone."
With a groan of resignation, Tony dutifully catches Rhodey's pinky with his own and they wiggle their hands together for a few seconds like they're both five-year-olds. Then Rhodey stands, half dragging Tony off the couch. "Up and at 'em, Tones. Time for all assholes to go to bed."
she was already going through withdrawal. I didn’t understand. It was my choice.” He looks down at the glass in his hand. “It was my choice to do that to myself.”
It didn't have to touch him, he told himself. It didn't.
"And if you need me?" Peter says, something like hope on the edge of his voice. Tony raises an eyebrow at him. "I...I like training with you guys. I couldn't go on big global missions but - if the Avengers need help-"
"You were both wrong," he tells Steve bluntly, and Steve barely covers a flinch. "And don't come at me with 'we were both right,' because it doesn't really matter in the grand scheme of things. You were both wrong and you fucked up and every single one of you damned Avengers, people that I trusted with the safety of the entire world, you just made everything worse. There are threats worse than the Accords waiting for the moment to strike and - you and Stark just handed it straight to them. Silver platter. Zemo played you like a puppet on a string."
"But if rules are placed upon us, the same will be demanded of them," T'Challa finishes for him. "A compromise, then."
"Me, too, punk. Come home soon." Steve can't answer that, and Bucky knows it. "Hey, and...I don't know, if this makes a difference, but Stark? He all but admitted he's doing this for you, so you can come back. I know it was hard for you, especially after the bunker but. But it might not stay that way forever, is all I'm saying."
"I'm getting nervous," Spider-Man says, bringing them all back to the present, and Tony sighs into his cup.
Donnie, sure enough, starts to pull himself together. Tony gestures at him. "C'mere." Together the two of them hook Kamala Khan pack up to the wires and monitors that had torn loose in her panic. Tony gestures at the beeping machine, tapping at the spiking line of Kamala's strong heartbeat. Ms. Khan's DNA may be trying to eat itself but damned if she isn't fighting every step of the way. "Look at that. That look small to you?"
“All I’m asking is: Jan. Please. As our local Tony wrangler, can you please ask him to back off a little?”
"Not a single part of that was a request. Move it or lose it, Rogers." She flicks her hand and a shuriken is there in her palm. Steve sighs and surrenders to his fate.
"Thank you," he manages. Bucky and he linger on for a few more minutes, desperate for every second of conversation they can get, and then voices begin to filter through on Bucky's end. "Later," Steve says, and it's a promise.
Sending you an audio file and Fury's interrogation of suspect captured, known as Ophelia Sarkissian AKA Viper AKA Madame Hydra. Stay safe.
"He put me in jail," Clint had yelled one day when the silent treatment got to be too much. "I was pissed, Rhodes!"
"I'll be by the compound tomorrow," Parker promises, hefting his backpack more firmly on his shoulder and looking uncertain before he decides to turn away. Tony drags his hand away from the cold, dark stone to watch him go.
Rhodey knows from long experience that it's not as easy as that, but Tony does feel better hearing that, no matter how many times he's heard the sentiment before. "What do you think about all this, with St - with the others?"
Cage says grudgingly. "
They both turn to look at the man in the cryo chamber. "I will take care of him," Wanda promises, and Steve's stomach roils. He's leaving him all over again, abandoning him to strangers, how can Steve do this to him again?
"No. No machines and no robots," the heavily-accented commander refuses. "We will not be another Sokovia."
"I don't want to be here anymore," he tells Steve. Steve brings the shield down and Tony catches it in his hands, breaking it away piece by piece. "I don't want to come here anymore. I want to go home."
There are mistakes Tony cannot fix.
The Captain tore his gaze from Tony's - he seemed to have a perplexing preoccupation with the other boy's eyes, having not once looked away since the faceplate came up - and nodded, getting serious. "Right. You know him better than we do, Guardians. What's your suggestion?"
Tony watches as Barnes carefully separates papers detailing the BARF system from the rest, laying them out side by side.
"I can't leave him," Steve says, edging in front of Bucky. "Or my team."
"He mentioned it, yes."
He can do nothing but look at his feet and keep breathing. "Who was your favorite, kid?" he asks quietly. The Captain, he supposes, or maybe Wanda.
"Stop squirming," Bucky admonished, his hand easily following Steve's bobbing and weaving to press his handkerchief against his split lip. Steve very manfully did not yelp in pain, but it was a close thing.
Peter laughs weakly. "Your boss is scarier than mine, nobody else would take the job. I actually kinda volunteered. Jameson will understand. I just wanted to see you. I'm sorry I've been so busy, I saw on TV and I - I'm sorry, Tony."
She throws up a projection of one of Howard Stark's thousands of scribbles, something that Tony must have looked at a thousand times but eventually threw in the 'Not Helpful' pile. On it is the formula, in the middle, with about ten different paths branching out from it. One of them is cordoned off but the rest look like guesswork. '
make that up?" Tony's smile turns a bit smug.
and takes the bait. "And what is my kind of place?"
Steve looks up at the ceiling, exhaling in a long controlled breath. "It's
He’s glad he never told Tony he loved him and he’s glad he never heard Tony say it back. And that’s so cheap, that’s all surface, because Steve knows the truth and it is damn near time he stopped lying to himself. He loved Tony, and Tony loved him, and that’s how they broke each other.
Fuck your secrets and your lies and your fucking high-handedness, fuck her and you and fuck you double for passing that kinda bullshit on to Captain America."
"This is Tony Stark. I have something of yours."
"I've been obsessing over these a little," Bruce confesses like its a dirty secret instead of a well-known fact. Tony can't help but grin. "And I think I might have come up with something that could stop the switch. Permanently."
"Carol," Rhodey butts in, almost sounding embarrassed. Danvers finally lets go of Tony with a nod, sitting back down beside him.
"Not entirely." Tony looked at him with such shock it made him smile. "Some of the stuff you've shown me has been pretty swell. So maybe we could just, er, change the methods?" The tiny grin that got him encouraged Steve to continue. "Like next week, I'll pick the movie. And if I want a recommendation, I'll ask."
I can't do both?
"-but when the call came and Sam Wilson said that Captain America needed help saving the world, Scott dropped everything to do it. Because that's the kind of man he is, a good guy, truly good." She slides one of the papers across to Tony. "This is the kind of man he is. And you sent him to jail."
It hadn't been good enough for Tony back then. It still isn't. Losing isn't in his playbook, not as long as he can still think. But maybe, maybe they can both be right. Meet in the middle of the mountain after all.
"I do not like your kind, Dr. Stark," she says baldly. "My father was not wrong about you. I do not like the burden you have placed on us. In correcting his own mistake by housing this Barnes, my brother has endangered us all."
Steve was on his own here. “Hello,” he started, and almost rolled his eyes at how lame it sounded. But what else could he say. “I don’t know who you are, but this is the Avengers Academy in New York City. I’m Captain America. Get on your feet and put your hands in the air...please.”
Stark stared down at his glass of water, watching the ripples that formed on the surface, a product of his shaking hand, and Steve stared at him. Tony - his Tony - never seemed to struggle with the weight of the world, not like this. In fact, he seemed to relish it. Every impossible thing Steve could think of, Tony had already built it and upgraded it - twice. Anything that could be wanted, Tony already had it. He built armored suits and robots and guns and ships in his spare time, he ran a billion dollar company, he went on press tours and to expos and screamed
"I don't," he tells her bluntly. "But we can't change the past." He meets her eyes steadily as they widen then narrow. Still, she remains quiet, listening. They all are, he realizes; even Cloak is looking up at him. "What we can change is the future, and we already have; how many women like you aren't going to fall into her hands? But this-" he points towards his phone. "This was only the tip of the iceberg. A distraction from the real threat. I'm willing to bet that HYDRA was ecstatic to know that Sarkissian was out there running around, taking the unloyal along with her, distracting us. We could do their dirty work for them, while they focused on Terrigenesis and the Avengers. It wasn't just two birds with one stone, it was a whole damn flock." He breathes out a frustrated breath, shaking his head when Sam opens his mouth.
you and not
CLINT:
"Anybody using their powers to police. Unless they retire. Until I can get that changed." Ross' control on the Accords needed to be removed as soon as possible; it's him that's pushing so hard for this sort of rounding up and registering. But until then, Tony's going to play by the rules and protect as many people as he can.
"You know me, sweetheart, I always dream big." Tony smiles bitterly at his reflection in the window. "Least important up, please."
Bruce takes another step forward.
"It's the arms. I never know what to do with them. This is why Rhodey and I stick to the one-armed bro hug." They let go, and Peter begins to slide on his mask. "Remember what I told you."
"Sergeant Barnes and Captain Rogers resisted arrest," the German official is stating for the third time. "Even if we are to believe these reports, they must still be held accountable for the damage they have done. One of them threw a cement block into a man's chest. He died en route to the hospital. Or is Mr. Stark going to argue that Barnes was under HYDRA's sway then, as well?"
"Oh, God, you're gonna make me sappy," Tony whines as he plops down on the couch and burrows his shoulder into Rhodey's. "I always need you. I'm a needy person. I need Pepper, too, but please note this is me, needing her from several miles away. I won't spontaneously collapse if you're gone for a few days."
"Because it wasn't what he wanted to hear," Tony snaps, then falls back, feeling inexplicably guilty. "There wasn't enough time and I - wasn't my best. If I had had the chance-" Horrified at himself for letting that out, so fucking whiny, he clamps his mouth shut. Fuck his tells, let Barnes see. What else can the man take away from him now?
She points at him. "You think that, but you have very judgey eyes."
"By yourself?" Tony asks, flabbergasted. "You've been triggering yourself alone? Godammit, Donnie-"
"It's just probation, Nat. I'm fine."
"These 'tourists' sound weak and pathetic. On my planet such a display would be cheered on in front of thousands," Drax declared, and then, seemingly making up his mind, stood. "I am going to play. Take many pictures, Khan. This 'In-sta-gram' of yours
“Okay,” Jan said. “I know. Just, maybe, next time, ask him? Steve’s out of his depth here, Tony, he’s not used to any of this, and Fury just threw him in and told him to play leader-“
He rises, heading towards the door. He's ready to go back - to the cold of New York, to the warmth of the compound, to FRIDAY being everywhere, not just a phone. He wants to crawl into bed with Rhodey tonight because the man is a saint who still lets him do that, or maybe spar with Natasha until he's exhausted. Check on Kamala and Donnie and Peter.
"Natasha," he says, voice strained and breaking a little. "I tried talking before. When that didn't work, I tried something a little less verbal, also hugely unsuccessful. You told me not long ago that I had to learn to ask for help, well this is me asking. Handle it. Can you do that?" She watches him, eyes flicking all over his face trying to read every twitch and clenched muscle, and then nods. "Thank you," he breathes, and heads over to where T'Challa is conversing with one of the first responders in heavily accented French.
It's a good idea, leaving War Machine with the SHIELD agents; he's used to working with a team under pressure so they coordinate attacks well. Spider-Man keeps out in the woods all along the perimeter, webbing people to trees and creating huge traps at the entrances and exits of the compound that the stupider HYDRA men walk straight into. Iron Man works seamlessly with Black Widow and Black Panther, slinging them up to walkways and rafters while blasting any agents he comes across, creating distractions while Vision just fazes through everyone, intent on his goal.
He's rambling; when he finally looks up T'Challa's eyes are on his finger, still tracing unsteady lines across the table. Slowly, Tony places his hand in his pocket, clenching it tight over the phone resting in there. "What?" he asks when T'Challa doesn't speak. "You think I'm trying to get away?"
“What is this?” Tony asks suspiciously as Steve rounds the table to slide in behind him, arms wrapping around his waist.
“Like you?” Steve challenged. Tony grinned, wide and unkind.
"I want you to keep doing what you're doing. Work for Fury, and work
"Tony, man, just breathe. You're alright. You're alright."
Steve took a deep breath, unprepared for the look in Tony's eyes and how uncomfortable it was to be on the other side of mourning. Nobody had ever missed Steve before; nobody had gotten the chance. "No. I'm a - well, I'm a different version of your Steve Rogers. I have a Tony Stark with me, too."
Vision reports. "
It would be shamefully easy to slip back into his old ways, and for thirty-eight hours Tony does. He locks himself in his lab and doesn't eat or drink, he just builds. FRIDAY has been reduced to a drone in the background the way he never could manage with JARVIS, but even through her constant needling for him to take care of himself she keeps everybody out. Tony movies from one project to the next without stopping, even when his hands come out from the Iron Man suit bloody. Butterfingers nearly ends up with a brand new head when it tries to bring a soldering Tony bandages, which brings its on hosts of worries that result in Tony spending an hour on the floor with his bots and bottle of vodka, apologizing every five minutes. Dummy has never been apologized to, before; he thinks its making the robot very anxious.
Steve gritted his teeth. “Being a jerk is a constant for you, isn’t it, Stark?”
enough. Our enemies are only going to get stronger. When the Chitauri got here, that first day, don't you remember? Their weapons punched straight through the first layer of my armor-"
"I'm on the Upper East Side right now, I'm fine."
"I'll check them out."
"Yep. We're waiting on two more people."
"I'm a big fan of 'give them hell.' Short, sweet, sounds threatening in Russian."
He hears a muffled curse, what sounds like the slamming of binders, and then the voice returns. "Is there an actual point to this call, Tony?"
Natasha nods. "We'll both be fine. Tony, we can't just sit here, we have to try. If we can save even one person-"
"She caught me talking to the coat check girl and threatened to cut my dick off and beat me with it. Probably could have succeeded too," Rhodey says, and Tony laughs. Rhodey usually only tells this story when they're both very drunk and they play 'who has the craziest ex.' Tony still maintains that since not one of Rhodey's exes has yet to shoot at him, Tony is still winning.
"Of course. Four days, Tony. I'll send you the interrogation tape by then." Coulson moves to leave, sending a nod towards Natasha that she doesn't return.
"I don't know," Peter breathes out wetly. "I don't know, I don't know, he knocked me through the floor. I can hear people screaming. I can hear him
Natasha's eyes soften imperceptibly and she lowers her gaze once more, reads the fine print. Raises the pen and puts her name to paper before sliding the document over to Tony. Rhodey claps his hands once, says "Alright, we're in business!" while Peter gives a whoop from the ceiling and Vision works his face into a smile.
"No doubt," Sharon replies.
Better encryption. You should ask T'Challa for the new version of the Accords.
"Say it," he murmurs through numb lips.
Her whip cracks out and Steve raises his shield instinctively, blocking the blow. His blood? Is Terrigenesis...based off of his serum? But all the records of that are lost, and even with his blood the serum would be nigh impossible to synthesize. The whip cracks down again and Steve rolls to the side.
He caught and held those dark brown eyes for a moment, unintentionally looking for coldness and basking in the life he found instead. Tony looked a bit petrified, honestly, but there was no hint of contempt or hatred.
"About?"
CLINT:
"Then I'm going to burn this." He reaches for the letter.
We are on the couch, and Tony is drunk, because none of us but Rhodes are the kind of friends who can caution Tony about his drinking anymore and the War Machine is out on a mission.
"Zemo?" Bruce asks, but Bruce is smarter than that.
Tony's first instinct is to snap that he already offered one, that Barnes can say no, but the moment passes, the instinct fades and logic prevails. He knows the real answer, too. "Short answer? There's always a choice. You can kick me out right now, Barnes. Wanda's itching for the chance."
"Still kinda sounding like a lecture there, kitty cat."
"Well, now you're just being ridiculous." A silence falls, and Tony frowns. "Grand finale, or more bad news? Fry?"
Tony only just barely refrains from jumping, turning instead to look at Bruce, eyebrows waggling. "Is that personal experience speaking there, Dr. Banner?"
"That's not true," Steve says lowly, firmly. "Or fair."
Tony can't. He can't do this again.
NATASHA:
"I own 51 percent of the company," Tony counters, eyes going back to the data FRIDAY has been running on the recording of Malik's interrogation. Heart rate suggests he wasn't lying. No sweating, no twitching muscles, just chatting amiably with Agent Mackenzie about the end of the world. For HYDRA, maybe that's just a regular Tuesday. "SI has enough subsidiaries. We're not buying out Oscorp."
Natasha fixes him with a stare. "I just don't want you taken in by a fly-by-night operator, Tony." He opens his mouth, closes it, squints at her, then opens his mouth again; all the while, Natasha maintain her calm facade. Waiting.
"Rachel."
"Great. These here tend to go pigeon-toed. It's awkward, man, c'mon."
"I don't know," Tony says honestly. "I don't. I do know that I have this - all-encompassing fear that I might be wrong. I calculate everything, for days, I run simulations in the background while I eat and sleep, I try to predict everything. But I can't, not entirely. And if I'm wrong, and something happens to you because of it, I will lose my goddamned mind." Donnie has turned to stare at him and Tony sucks in a deep breath. "But I also can't - the surest path to the safest future is to keep you here where SHIELD and triggers can't get to you. But I can't decide that for you, can I?"
“The window broke first thing on the plane,” Steve agrees, and this conversation of half-filled fears is less gruesome than it has any right to be. Tony almost finds himself smiling in the brief seconds he isn’t wondering what the hell Fury was thinking, putting this team together. The Island of Misfit Toys was a part of fiction for a reason.
I WROTE STEVE. Somebody please murder me now.
"We were sparring, Jan," Steve told her soothingly. "I wanted to test my skills against a dual-wielder and Nebula is aces with those swords of hers."
This Bucky says Steve's name like he's asking a question, truth or fiction, your name is Steve? Truth or fiction, newspapers in your shoes, your mother's name was Sarah? Truth or fiction, I killed dozens of people, I killed Howard?
Tony waved his hand. "Enchantress turned it into a slug because Sam compared her to the Wicked Witch of the West. Joke's on her though, 'cause Fury told her she had to take care of it."
They are in the same room this time, less playing at bravery than the absence of cowardice, facing each other over a table, and Tony's mouth is still open from gearing up to his spiel again when Barnes leans forward and asks that.
He wonders if Barnes even has that.
"Yeah," Tony says slowly, then decides
Then. Quieter.
"Don't know. Still trying to figure out a way I can ask and stay tactful but hey. Tact's never been my strong suit anyway," Tony says. He taps a few more keys, more aggressively than is strictly needed on something that is holographic. "There's a whole lot of pieces here, Nat. I can't see the picture they're making, but I know it's not good. I'm sure of it."
It's been two days since he first saw him, two nights of the same dream standing at his parents' graves with a fistful of dirt in his hand that he never manages to throw down onto their coffins, forty eight hours to wonder if he's doing the right thing. If there is even a right thing to be done here.
him."
practically an explosion of emotion for him. "You could tell me if you weren't okay, too. Or you could not, that's always an option. But I figure, you and me, we're pretty familiar to each other in our own super weird way. We're safe. For each other."
Rhodey's expression kind of folds in on himself and he nods. "Sometimes I still feel like I'm falling."
"I'll think about it," Peter hedges again. "I gotta be strong for him and I - I mean, look at me."
He reaches for his chest, takes out the reactor. He places it on the table.
Tony leaned the rest of the way with a grin, kissing him so hard Steven tasted blood through the sweet taste of relief. Anthony was alive, and would remain so. The day was victorious. They were heroes all. Outside there was a sudden call for the whiskey casks to be broken open. The celebrations would begin soon.
Rhodey puts the crutches to the side and like a puppet on a string Tony lunges for him before he falls. Rhodey wraps his hands around Tony's shoulders, tight, so tight, and forces Tony down into a chair. "Tony," he says, and he sounds a bit scared. "Breathe for me, okay? You're not making any sense."
"There's a doorbell!" he shouts at her.
“You promised.”
"Um," Tony says eloquently. "Yes?" T'Challa doesn't speak, waiting him out, and Tony puts his head into his hands. "Look, 'poor mood' does not even begin to cover it. Gill's memories are a
NATASHA:
"My brother is getting things prepared back at the facility." Even her speech is all cutting consonants and short vowels. Tony vaguely wonders if T'Challa is actually like this too and Tony's either gotten used to him or T'Challa is purposefully dulling his edge whenever they speak. "We will meet him there. You will stay for as long as Mr. Barnes deems he is able to handle you and then you will depart until you are recalled. These terms satisfy you?"
“Too late…” Jan sighed. “And Tony starts crying.”
," FRIDAY begins. "
"Big guns?"
"You remember to stay true to yourself. If you do anything for your mother, you grab onto James tight, and never let go. Will you promise me?”
, she meant. Not anymore.
"Yeah," Peter agrees in that weird shaky voice he gets when he's trying to be particularly tough. "You should have. I kicked ass against the Green Goblin and you didn't even say thank you."
He is back in front of that monitor, relearning all his worst fears had never died but gorged themselves on his absence and grown stronger than ever. "What have you done?"
and the wheelchair swings around in front of him with a squeal of the wheels, blocking Tony's path. Rhodey looks up at him, worry and concern pouring out of every inch of him. "Tell me you're alright and we're good."
No I really can't. Take care of your team Captain. We're going to need you. Tell Sam.
Natasha's face is a careful mask of blankness, her voice as gentle as can be. "Bucky was brainwashed by HYDRA for years, Tony."
"But it can't," Bucky says plainly. "Because we're
started dragging me to movies, forcing me to watch and he knew I didn’t get it, but - so I stopped. You know what he did? He started displaying them like that, up on the Tower, so that I couldn’t avoid them, and he made it into this thing, this
"Wimp," he accuses. Natasha shrugs. "They're going to be part of the team someday, Natasha. All I've ever known is you guys. I'm not sure I'll know what to do with new blood when the time comes."
"Look after yourself," Steve tells him. "Call me."
Team's safe.
"Meet me in the stairwell," Daredevil cuts in. "I've got civilians."
Around him is a deserted hallway, the dim sounds of bustle and machinery in the background. "So, this is the Vault?" Steve asks. He wouldn't agree to Fury's terms until he knew where he and Sam were going. The files Fury sent over after one long-suffering sigh listed the Vault as SHIELD's number one containment facility and full-time base, designed by Howard Stark and a Doctor Reed Richards and constructed under Director Margaret Carter. Steve knows the thrumming in the air is from Cell Block 42, housing the most dangerous criminals the government didn't get to know about, holding them behind the strange energy barriers developed by Dr. Richards before the man went off to space with his untrained wife and family and never came back.
(Tony had to say
Peter smiles tremulously up at him at that, spreading his arms wide. Tony lifts an eyebrow.
Because it wasn’t about Bucky then, and it isn’t about Bucky now, and Tony understands how he might have given that impression what with trying to kill the man, and that’s on him, but he hates that after all this time, Bucky is still the only thing Steve can see. He hates that Bucky was the only thing Steve chose to hang onto. He hates that he was sacrificed on the altar of Bucky Barnes, but he gets it. If it was Rhodey he would have done the same thing, which is why psychiatric help for Barnes was the first thing he offered Steve when he could. Bucky isn’t the problem here.
He figured it out. He came to help us take Zemo down and we did. Tony tried to stop us again things got out of hand and we escaped. And now here we are.
"-it's been a long time since I felt like a person," Barnes finishes.
Then he starts drinking.
know my name."
Tony straightens up, glancing at the slumbering Kamala. "Khan? He's related to Kamala?"
Except for one. He hears Diamondback's giggle before he actually sees her, and he sees her shurikens before anything else. They flash in the air and spin into the keypad locking them out of the innermost section of this HYDRA base, frying the connections. A moment later and the giggle herself drops down beside him, all pink and black and dangerous. "Am I your back-up, fearless leader?" She smiles wildly, grabbing for her weapon without looking, plucking it up perfectly by its deadly little edges. She throws out a snappy salute with it. "I am flattered."
It's Rhodes.
"I never thought of using a staple gun that way!" Sam added, and then, in an aside to no one muttered "I can't believe space is still using staple guns."
I hate this chapter so much I want to write it a condescending letter and mail it a burner phone.
He was opening his mouth to respond when Tony lurched a little, grabbing at his midsection.
Rhodey sleepily rolls his eyes, dragging himself upright. They all watch interestedly as he shifts his legs as much as he can, straining to use the mostly-defunct nerves until they are in position and he can strap the braces on. Rhodey is slowly regaining feeling in parts of his legs. He'll never be like he was, but he's getting better. In the meantime Tony just builds him different braces every other day and tries to fool Rhodey into thinking he's just a test dummy for Stark Industries' new line of prosthetics.
"So you ran away," Tony continues for him. "How that work out for you, Princess Jasmine?"
No, no, Steve wasn't let him leave on that. "Hey, Tony," he said, catching the other man's arm just as he began to turn. "Listen to me. If you do one thing - anything - in my name, you do this: you live. Do you hear me? You live, Tony. You have a great life."
Tony shrugs. "In theory, it's all coming from the same place, and the way this formula mutates once it's in the bloodstream is like nothing I've ever seen before, so who knows? Biochem's not my thing. We won't know until Bruce finishes up and even then - we already know whatever they're pumping into people isn't strictly the Super Soldier serum."
Because yes, he’s incredibly angry Steve lied to him about his
"You're very astute," she says drily. She presses something in her hand and suddenly there is a canvas bag in her hands. Out of it she pulls two sheets of paper and what looks like a copy of the Accords. "I saw what you did for Clint Barton and I'm here to make a deal. You're going to get Scott Lang out of whatever hellhole he's in and back to his family."
"Contracts with the United States within the parameters of the Accords might do it."
For the first time, Bruce hesitates. He runs his hands through his hair over and over again. "You know there's that saying about how if you can't look at your actions in the light of day they were probably the wrong choices? You didn't call me until this was already over, until you'd already won, because you knew which side I'd be on." Something inside Tony crumples at that, but it also kick-starts the part of him that went silent the moment he saw Bruce's face.
"Not at all, Ms. Khan," Vision says serenely, without even moving a muscle.
Steve furrowed his brow, a bit lost. “…Rhodes? War Machine? He’s transferring soon-“
FRIDAY answers the question he's already forgotten, but Tony is standing shakily, reaching for clothes and telling the AI to ring T'Challa and tell him what's happening. He needs to get back, needs to head this off at the pass, talk to Peter, talk to Pepper about maybe taking a few more shares of Oscorp so that the younger Osborn doesn't lose everything, needs to-
"Um, hi?" Tony tries. The woman's shoulders tense and she snatches off her helmet. "Mrs. Pym?" Tony says dazedly, but no, her eyes are too blue, her features a touch too sharp. Mrs. Pym was always smiling, too, one of the few adults to say hello when Tony was allowed down at Howard's parties. "Hope van Dyne. Pleasure."
That girl said you saved her life and that 'guy' was the one who nearly killed her, not you.
"The lights were still on," Pepper supplies. "Before the explosions. There are people still in there."
"Great. It's been getting kinda toasty around here without her icy glare." Even with an entire country between them, Tony does not feel safe even referencing the tears Hope had cried when he brought Scott home with him in handcuffs. She'll know, somehow. Hope's spooky like that.
"I'm sure you were. He doesn't know what he's missing," Tony says, only just managing not to laugh at her.
Tony nods, ghosts shaking fingers over his mother's stone. "Thank you."
"Do you regret it?"
because it's
Rhodes' face went soft, and oddly knowing. "That's what he'll have us for, Cap. Right?"
"Speaking of," Coulson says, stepping closer. "How is Donald Gill coming along? How soon can we expect him back with us?"
"It wasn't your fault," Tony agrees.
Steven snapped, seizing Clinton by his collar. “You were supposed to protect him!”
(A week later Luke Cage will call him and ask "But what do you think about 'Defenders?'"
We agree to disagree. We’re good at that.
"A journalist always has to know the kernel of truth, you told me that. How are people really dealing with it?"
. It was never about
"With all due respect, Director Fury, we had not been told of Zemo's plot and at that point the stakes had grown too dire to simply let Captain Rogers be. The forces being sent after the Avengers who had not signed were also tasked with taking in Sergeant Barnes, and they had orders to shoot on-sight. We felt our comrades were in too great a danger to not take the tasks of detaining them for ourselves."
Tony has his sunglasses on but even they can't hide how utterly wrecked the man looks, keeping Pepper close as he wades through the mass of people slinging questions at him.
He will. Someday. Soon. They have time now; he figures they’ve beaten the odds, two broken souls fitting together just right. All those dreaded maybes slink off to the back of his mind to die a quiet death. Steve is the best thing that has ever happened to him.
"I'm not crying." He's not. "I probably should be." Also true, but Tony doesn't cry.
"Reports on us?" Fuck, Tony did not even want to imagine what his said.
His hand curls into a fist against his will; the phone creaks ominously. The last time Tony came to them with hands open it ended in a bloody fight, and Steve knows how much of that is on him, but it doesn't change how
Tony pauses a moment, then thinks
"And you, Tony?" Vision asks. "What would be your best dream?"
is pushing it, to say he has
. They ruined her.
"No."
." Suddenly Vision head tilts sharply in the other direction just as Rhodey's phone beeps loudly in his pocket. Rhodey pulls it out, staring at the new number listed on his screen, and then turns that sharp gaze on Tony.
"I don't know what that is," Steve says, which is precisely why Sam mentioned it. "Thanks, Sam."
But the more he tried, the more it hurt. The more he showed Steve, the more it seemed like Tony was rubbing in his face everything Steve had missed. He was always looking for
"Well,
T'Challa's gaze is roving his face, his dark eyes nearly black from the odd hang of the lights overhead. "You continually surprise me, Tony," he says in his low, husky voice. "Every grandstand greater than the last."
"He gets the good part from me," Rhodey replies, all smug pride when Tony glares that softly fades to concern at whatever he sees in Tony's face. "Hey, no, look at you, you're just fine. You wanna count the beats?"
"You're not here for the tech?" Tony sighs.
"Really?" Kamala asks breathlessly. She's let her guard down a little today, conceding to Tony's presence if only because the boys insisted on hanging out in the lab and she didn't want to be left out, but now she lets it down fully. She practically glows in her admiration, and Tony selfishly lets himself basks in it for a moment. It passes as a shadow crossed her face. "But, I mean. With my powers. How is anything gonna...?"
"You've still got friends, Steve. And Bucky. Hell, I'm willing to bet you still have Tony."
"Chest hurting?" Natasha asks, and only then does he realize he is rubbing at his sternum.
-Never mind.
"No," Tony says, holding up a finger and beginning to walk towards the War Room.
"Or?" Tony says when Tiberius pauses.
…and sometime he couldn’t sleep for thoughts of everything he’d lost.
"Wild," Kamala breathes as Rhodey covers an indelicate snort.
"He usually is."
“Alternate universe,” Steve blurted, forcibly shoving that ‘prettier’ out of his mind. “You’re in an alternate universe. You came in through that – we call it the Time Fog. It’s like a tear in space made corporeal.” He gestured to the wall of mist and Tony, keeping his body facing squarely forward, turned his head to follow. “Things fall through sometimes. From other places.”
, he thinks darkly, and then he thinks of poor Harry Osborn, and then he thinks
"But, I guess I'd have to get used to that, huh?" Kamala asks dully. "If I ever...became an Avenger. Double checking everything I do, looking over my shoulder. People would always - because of who I am, you know."
Tony's eyes snap up to meet his friend's, pained but resolute. "Rhodey," he croaks. "Don't..." He goes quiet and still for a moment, dropping one hand from Rhodey's and resting it on the table. If his father - if his father -
"Madame Hydra fights with a whip," she tells him unnecessarily. He just blinks at her. "Your legwork is shit and it makes you an easy target for distanced attacks. That's why she got away last time. Look, Rogers," oh, and she's definitely Rachel right now if she's using his last name. "Fury told me to be on my best behavior, work with you, and I'd get my girl. But you're not giving me a lot to work with. I want that bitch dead and you're going to help me do it. Ergo, you and I are working on your legwork today. Pull on your big boy super tights and let's roll."
Hope narrows at Tony, half at the slight and half in thought. "I think," she says. "That you don't really know what you're suggesting here."
"And now?"
"Don't start weaving the friendship bracelets just yet, Killer Queen," he says. "This part, this-" He waves at the interface. "This was never in question. If the world is at stake, I know Rogers will be there. For everything else...well, that's what the VI is for. Neutral third party. Keeps the system safe, information organized, and me and Cap from going at each other's throats. Easy-peasy."
“Tony, you can’t just-” Leave me, he doesn’t say. “If I wasn’t fast enough, or if your heart had given out sooner-”
I'm back.
Steve bristled. “I’m fine.”
"Poor choice of words!" The green figure cackles as once more Peter is sent flying through the air. War Machine intercepts him immediately, taking Spider-Man to the ground.
first, the Retro-Framing technology that could help him overcome the trigger words -
"In a -" Tony swallows his next words, guaranteed to be outraged and hurtful. Bruce isn't trying to hurt Donnie. No one is going to hurt Donnie, he has to remember that. "Okay. Look. You keep working on this - this is good work. But right now, it's non-viable. Do not bring it up to Donnie because he will volunteer for it a heartbeat. Until we can work out the kinks, maybe some practical application once we figure out how to Winter Soldier-ize some mice, and we'll look at it again. But this could kill him. It's too risky."
She was so fucking terrified. I died terrified once, did you know, out in space? And that's - that's how she felt. That's how dad felt. It's all I think about. And now I die like that, all over again, just like them, every night."
"Peter!" Tony shouts. "Peter, don't!" The girl has already reached terminal velocity, a stop at that angle will break her neck. And the web is beating Tony. "Spider-Man, pull back!"
. "You just have to use the right cheese." She makes it sound like a trap, Tony thinks dimly.
The illusive tomorrow never came though. Tony ran himself ragged preparing for Ronan's final push, as Steve did the same repelling the warlord's ground forces. They barely had time to speak, and when they did it was commands and relays. Finally, the aliens were sent packing, and Tony disappeared making repairs on the Legion, which seemed to grow by the day, while Steve aided in reconstruction on the damaged building on campus.
T'Challa swears to the stars.
God, he wishes he still kept alcohol on this jet.
But that was a dream, like Wanda's vision, and when it ended he felt just as alone. If he could go back...If he could go back, he'd do the same thing.
"Ellis probably ordered him to get back into the council's good graces," Rhodey says. "It's got to make him itch, not having an American on board."
“Aye, sleeping, like always. He’ll get his rest tonight, and then tomorrow, then what? Will it be the lungs or the legs this time? Rest won’t fix what ails him. You’ve coddled him too much.
BANNER:
The conversation shifts after that, to Peter and Kamala and their training. Clint's pointing out the weaknesses in Kamala's observations and theories and where she's already grasped the finer points of strategy, telling the others how to work with her whenever they're in training with her. Hope glances Tony's way once or twice, probably wondering if he's going to bring up his ideas about moving back into the city, but Tony keeps quiet, absorbing everything Clint says. He wishes Peter was here right now; even if he was being criticized or corrected, Peter loved learning more about his abilities and how to improve. It's what makes him such a good hero.
HE STOLE MY SHIELD:
"That'll strike fear into the hearts of our enemies," she says dryly, dropping a plate filled with food among the bolts and styluses on Tony's desk with expert precision. "Food for you. Beef tips. Never claim Laura Barton doesn't love you."
"Well, but it would be hard to seek revenge when you're at the bottom of the ocean."
The capital city of Birnin Zana, the little he gets to see while they travel down the Royal Mile towards the palace (the cab driver calls it something completely different, something approaching 'Panther's Grace.' Tony doesn't know what these people are bothering to hide; there is literally a panther statue or a panther carving every other building.) is incredibly beautiful, a mixture of technology and history that only the oldest and largest American cities even come close to. Once inside the palace they are surrounded by Shuri's contingent of body guards and led to the large grounds in the back where a helicopter is waiting to take them to the Royal Science and Engineering Institute (nobody translates this time but Tony is still willing to bet the actual name has something to do with panthers) hidden up in mountains. Right after the helicopter passes the giant panther statue carved into the mountainside - and Tony is not so insensitive as make the analogy to Disney World that he's absolutely dying to - it touches down on the sole flat space in the entire region, just outside a large boxy building that to the naked eye looks completely deserted.
, he thinks now.)
The mad scientist has a bomb, because of course he does.
Another Tony Stark had come to haunt him.
"Doesn't seem like your kind of place," Luke Cage remarks as he strides into the abandoned packing factory on the high end of Hell's Kitchen.
Upstairs Rhodey and Natasha are debating asking the Defenders to take on a small mission in Harlem. "No way," Rhodey is saying. "Cage and Daredevil will probably just deliver gift baskets."
Steve's fists curl. "You still experimented with it, the terrigen. Why?"
"You're hard to forget."
I am not at liberty to say, Captain. We are handling the situation.
"I don't actually need your permission, you realize?" she points out. "I'm your CEO."
"Mr. Stark?"
Tony laughed. “Nice to know Will Smith is multi-universal, at least. You’d probably like it, Cap – Bill Paxton, hm, wait, maybe it’s Pullman – anyway, gives this speech at the end? You should take notes.”
Scott, eyes still red from his crying jag, gestures in front of him at the phone. "What the fuck."
"Oh, we're done alright," Peter says darkly, and shoots out one last web, wrapping the man up before kicking him over the edge of the building. "How's it hanging down there?"
"And little more civility towards your boss, for one," he replies, then gives in to a dramatic pause. "But then again, that's not really me, is it, Agent Hill?"
"Everett Ross is a direct man," T'Challa says, caught out now and still smug. "He required a direct approach, which I used to great success to get Romanov into to see Zemo. You, my friend, require a bit more subterfuge."
FRIDAY recites sullenly.
Tony turns to him fully, taking a step towards him. "I just - I'm not sure it's a good idea-"
Sarah gathered her son up close, willing her meager warmth into his small body. His skin felt hot against her clammy cheek. “
"I do," Tony cried, looking more and more upset. "But do you think the future just falls into your lap? You think the rest of us can be like you and sleep our way into it?"
Tony waves his hand, grinning. "Me and Banner cracked the secret to stretchy pants about two years ago. You're good. Here, have a hologram." He swings his hand to the left and the computer dutifully loads a blank template right in front of her face. "Go crazy."
"Siberia," Tony grits out. "In the report. It's a pretty dull story, too. Tell us yours instead. Something about terrigen bombs." That perks everyone but Clint right the fuck up, since the Avengers as a whole are really, really on board with murdering the hell out of the people who killed dozens and mutilated Kamala.
"I hardly think Mr. Stark's personal motivations matter-" the Russian delegate, eager to sweep even more of his country's sordid history under the rug.
Vision inclines his head and withdraws, going back to his workstation. Tony baldly switches the conversation to Viz's next adventure in cooking and the night is no longer silent.
And Steve has thought, every once in awhile, that there is something intrinsically broken within him, something that he didn't want to fix, or didn't want to be better, because to change himself meant moving on, and he wasn't ready for that. He has always dismissed the thoughts as soon as they came because even if he was broken, it didn't seem to matter to anyone but him.
"Ready for what?" Tony asks but his voice sounds far away even to his own ears.
Isn't that what
"It would give victims a fighting chance. They could make it through the other side. Like Kamala did," Tony follows-up. "Glad to hear it." His eyes can't help it; they find the data again. "I - I know I'm not my father, Bruce. One hundred percent aware. Still. Legacies are a funny thing."
That Tony wasn’t trying to flay him bare and expose how he was lacking, how he was so already so far behind, but was trying to share the future, because Tony loved the future. Tony loved those movies, and those stupid references, and the tech and that by sharing his love, Tony was sharing himself.
"That's beside the point-" Tony begins, but T'Challa slices his hand through the air and he falls silent. He hasn't seen the expression in T'Challa's eyes outside of news clips from right after the bombing.
They watch as the man bolts to his sister's bedside, holding her close even as her skin gleams gold. "
"Don't," Natasha says with no bite. "Rhodes is really happy." When he doesn't respond or look up, Natasha sighs and curls a little closer to him, making no more contact than that one hand but very
you now as his leader, so maybe he'll actually listen when it comes outta your mouth. You got a knack for putting his feet back down to the ground, man. He needs someone like that; I got into the habit of indulging him back in college."
. One day she'll stop hurting. My friends stay dead. It's not enough."
don’t hold a lot of weight against memories, do they?” Tony rubbed at his chest again, watching Steve in a way that made him feel uncomfortably like he was being catalogued. Something settled in the other Tony’s face, something determined. “He’ll get the idea, you know. He’ll drop it eventually. And then you can go back to wallowing in peace.”
“But hey,” the other Tony blathered on. “Like I said, Tiny Stark will catch the hint eventually. Maybe it’ll be better this way. Not like he needs you, either – he’s got a Rhodey, right?”
However, he was just short enough now that the edge of his chest plate knocked into Steven’s hip, where one of Mordred’s bannermen had gotten a lucky hit in the barest gap between his mail and his armor, cutting through the jerkin and beyond. The wound wasn’t deep and would heal quickly, but he was like to never hear the end of it until it did.
Tony shrugs. "I never said I didn't get why Rogers and the others were skittish. It was a shit move Ross and the Security Council pulled on us, but even then-"
"His Panther-ness is always careful." The bitterness of Tony's voice pairs horribly with the sing-song tone. "He knows I'll exercise the same caution. Transfer now, please."
Not Afghanistan. Labs. Safe. No blood, no - he can't think over that sound, what is that sound?
like her dad. She's even got a name for herself - Stature. Her mother says she heard it on a news report about Giant Man." Tony raises an eyebrow, half confused and half impressed; 'Stature' is a fair bit cooler than 'Ant' or 'Giant Man.' Point to Little Lang. "How do you think any of us are going to stop her? Scott can talk about how dangerous it is until he turns blue in the face, but Cassie doesn't just idolize him but everything he does. She's going to grow up and wonder why she can't help the same way. And she'll steal her dad's belt one night and end up killing herself because she doesn't know what she's doing."
"You know why," Ultron chides him, and Tony sucks in a breath that doesn't make it all the way into his lungs.
"Civil war," Fury harrumphs. "I saw that in the news.
"Good plan."
"Same to you, Your Highness."
"I don't know where he is," he lies one more time. Hope's eyes more give the indication of rolling than performing the act itself but it still makes him grimace. "We got Clint because he wandered into a warzone like an idiot and got himself captured by the Black Widow."
[DOCUMENTS ATTACHED]
But then Tony showed him that hologram, then Tony started talking about plugging alien chips into his brain. Upgrading himself like he did everything else. Why have Avengers when you could have a robot fighting force to replace them? Why train when you fought in a metal suit? Why protect civilians when you could have Big Brother attack your foes before they even struck - even existed? Why settle for humanity when you could have 'powers they wouldn't understand'?
"Buck, I - I don't know what to do."
He stays ensconced in his lab, working on SI projects or updates to the armor or building up his secret armory in the basement for a threat that looms large in his mind and nowhere else. He sees Steve looking up at the cameras sometimes, mouthing words that Tony doesn’t puzzle out. He knows the man asks about him sometimes and FRIDAY has full permission to give him updates, because he remembers what killed him most during the fighting was the uncertainty, the not knowing if Steve was okay. He may be angry, but Tony Stark is capable of empathy sometimes.
"Yes. I expected, I don't know, evaluations, but he dug deep. It's what made him - what makes him - a good leader. You should read them some time; I think he digitized them a year back during the move."
"Yes, but not all of us read her bedtime stories from scientific journals," T'Challa teases. Tony ducks his head. "Truly, though, Doctor, you have done a marvelous thing."
Much later, the kissing grows more fervent, and they wind up on a couch, Tony in his lap making all kinds of delightful noises, and Steve is so happy and
She didn’t say it out loud; she never did. At first it was out of hope that things would change, but more everyday it was out of fear. Joseph was not the same man she married. That man would have listened to her, but he died in the trench and sent back this monster wearing his face and another woman's name.
"The Avengers?" Nat can't help but start guessing, and its not surprising that once she stops and thinks, she gets it. Her eyes widen, head tilting towards Tony like they're conspiring. "Bucky Barnes. That's...big of you."
She scurries out of the room and Rhodey's smile has turned incredibly smug. "What?" Tony says.
"Making tea?" Spider-Man says like its obvious. He looks over his shoulders to find both men watching him and he shrugs. "Like I said, you look bad, Mr. Stark. You need tea. It's like one of the rules of life, you know?"
He likes looking at Tony. He likes listening to Tony. He likes watching him work and scheme and laugh and he’s even fond of his irritating lack of filter and the fact that he is allergic to sleep. But he doesn’t love Tony, not like Peggy.
Taking a chance, he opens up the secure, Stark-approved direct messenger app that all the Avengers have on their phone.
"Rogue?" Rhodey asks, leaning forward. Natasha nods, and pushes her phone to the center of the table before pressing play on the media app displayed on screen. They listen in complete silence first through Fury's interrogation, then through Steve's, though the latter could only in the vaguest terms be deemed an interrogation. It's much more of a conversation, and hats off to Steve Rogers: it works a sight better than anything Fury could have pulled on this woman.
"It means that you try to help and everybody else pays for it. You try to fix things and everybody else pays for it. You chased away Steve, you chased away the Avengers but
"What's happening is some very bad people out to spread fear through tragedy," Tony responds, voice and eyes as hard as stone. "These are terrorists, folks, and I know on a day like this no one wants to hear this, but you can't let them win. I know you're hurting and I know that right now giving in feels like the simplest thing to do, but I urge you not to. The Avengers will be using every resource available to hunt these cowards down, with the aid of the United Nations. We stand ready to live up to our namesake; we will make those responsible face justice."
in the middle of a lecture on my moral quandaries," Rachel says, voice so dry he feels scorched hearing it.
The words sink in, and they’re not the surprise Tony expected them to be. It was never love that was the problem between them, and love is not what needs fixing. “I love you, too.”
“Means some poor bastard out there has been saddled with a corpse for a soulmate,” Joseph snarled.
The council is quiet, looking down on him from the odd courtroom arrangement they have set up. "It might be considered," the Englishwoman says finally, and Tony supposes that's the best they can hope for.
Or maybe he could have told Sam about the five whole seconds after he'd looked Tony in the eye and told him he knew Bucky had killed Howard and Maria. The five whole seconds where Steve had watched Tony fall apart and Steve had done nothing. Five seconds and Steve's a super soldier. He can save the world in five seconds, but he couldn't save Tony or Bucky.
“To fallen enemies and Mordred’s defeat,” Clinton proposed.
He endures the attack, his AI a comforting presence in his ear as she tells him odd stories from around the world. She has a particular fondness for Florida Man, and by the time she is through telling him about the poor soul who killed his imaginary friend, Tony's breathing is back to normal. "Thanks, girl."
"And you think this plan is going to work?" Steve asks incredulously.
“We can’t be like this anymore,” he breathes into Steve’s shoulder. “We’re gonna get each other killed.”
Tony takes a step closer. "I know you want to be alone, to do this alone. You've got some crusade; don't look at me like that, we all do. It's the rare man that becomes a hero just for the sake of doing good-"
“And foolish,” Lady Pepper said.
"Because I need you to be," Tony says. Then, more quietly: "Because you
"The - the trial?" Steve repeats, and then flatly, as it sinks in: "There's still going to be a trial."
The smile drops from his face. The screen, previously filled with lines of FRIDAY's code, dutifully clears, and a name pops up, one he didn't expect to hear from so soon.
“I’m sorry,” Steve whispered, because – because someone had to. Because this Tony clearly needed to hear it.
Hope's side-eye is as impressive as every other thing she does. "You know, I think that little nickname's more of a compliment than you meant it to be, Stark. For your information...I was, apparently, 'hovering.'" It looks like it pains her to admit. She point the spoon at him, more threatening than it has any right to be. "Scott's words, not mine. I thought I was positively delightful."
"This and that," Bucky says, so deliberately calm, still acting like Steve's anchor even when he doesn't remember everything. "The trial, mostly, clearing my name."
"I'd say no problem but I don't have a very good track re-" T'Challa's eyes open only to narrow at him. "Safe. Got it."
"Even me?" It's a question he's asked himself more than once, and only in this moment, looking back at Barnes, does Tony come to any sort of resolution.
. Not what Obie was doing, not what ignoring Killian would do, not what Ultron would turn into. Howard couldn't have known - but he should've known
"What can I say, Rep," he says tightly. "I got carried away."
A true hero. Steve would be so proud of this kid.
'Cloak' winks at him. "'Til next time, Captain." And then he is gone is a swirl of darkness, leaving the phone in Steve's hands.
Tony spread his hands. “You need some hard data, you’re looking at it. If he’s anything like me-“ A pause that hung heavily in the air. “He’s not doing it to hurt you.”
"Where are you going with this?"
Three little words, and they destroy Tony's world.
" As his AI maps everything about the rinky-dink phone, Tony watches Rhodey's eyes move side to side as his friend reads Steve's letter once, twice, three times, face twisting up at the same spots every time. The three remaining Avengers sat around the small table, eating dinner that Vision had made. Tony had come in late, dodging increasingly insistent calls from Ross, and placed the phone on a nearby Starkpad for FRIDAY's easy access while sliding the letter across to his best friend.
"So," he says. Clears his throat, tries again. "So you're going to see Harry?"
"You don't
"You don't have to convince me, Tony," Natasha says. "The whole thing is wiggy."
“Jesus
Another person landed on top of him.
"How we...are?"
“I’ve been told it’s a classic?”
And the girls? Rachel, her friends? Was that to prove a point, or is torturing young women just your particular brand of cruelty?"
"Do you forgive me?" he asks her.
"It's...it's cool. I get it. But you know, I'm not so pathetic that I kept calling you just so you would notice me, senpai," Peter says, suddenly getting very business-like and reaching into his pocket. "Gwen Stacy wanted to get in contact with you. I've been trying to help her out. As Spider-Man, of course! She uh, she doesn't know Peter Parker exist. I mean, she knows! Cause she, um, tracked me down through...me. Like, she knew I took my pictures, so she asked me to set up a meeting with me? So I did, and she wanted me to pass this along to Iron Man." It's a printout of a string of data entries out of what must have been the OsCorp databanks. "This was all she could get before Harry locked up the servers in some remote location. I think he's taken a page out of your book; he's totally turning the company around."
, and has loved him this entire time. He wants to tell him, but all that comes out when he turns and throws his arms around his boyfriend’s shoulders is “Captain America, always saving the day.”
"And we wouldn't want that!" Gwen chirps smartly. She gets up on her very tippy toes and he obliges her, crouching down so she can place a kiss on his cheek. "Thank you, Iron Man. You saved me and my friends. All of you. We won't forget."
"It still needs work," she tells him.
He falls silent, staring hard at something beyond the papers.
, he had always told the Avengers, some in different ways than others. (
Alright, the reason this chapter took so long is because it started become just hugely long, so I had to start splitting it into two. Which, good news is if I don't get called into work much, means the next chapter shouldn't take so much time. And as a warning, we're getting further away from the emotional stuff and more onto plotsville because this fic won't leave me alone.
The very worst thing, the thing that no one tells you about, is the aftermath.
(Something in the way that Steve looks back. That Captain America is always at Iron Man’s side.)
We agreed that SI and Avengers wouldn't mix, Tony. Promise me this won't affect the company when whatever you're cooking up inevitably goes south.
"Maybe they can ask Rose Tyler," Tony murmurs. At Rhodey's frown he just shrugs. "Bomb guy. Kept talking about a Doctor. Look, yeah, we'll tell Coulson."
"I don't know who you are," he tells the shield. "But I don't trust you."
Tony scoffs. "Seriously, Nick, it's been months. Where have you been?"
It's not that he wants to stop missing his parents - he can't do that, he will never not miss them. But he thinks it'd be okay if some part of him just let go and stopped grieving them. Sometimes, when he doesn't have nightmares about Steve Rogers, he dreams that he's keeping his mother here with him, unable to move on to whatever is past death, to the God she prayed to, forever serenading a son that cannot recover.
Jan said sternly. “You sulked for three days. Tony Stark is not meant for sulking! You are meant for explosions and world-saving and shiny new tech. And me, you’re best friend who has been deprived of your company, wasting away-“
"Tony."
He fights on, body after body falling under his shield or his fists. Sometimes he hears the particular zing of Dagger's light projectiles or smells the odd ozone scent that accompanies Cloak's portal or hears a scream from above that gets closer and closer until it ends abruptly and that's Sam, taking people up and dropping them. Shurikens dance at the corner of his vision so Diamondback is somewhere close, watching his back, and Steve presses forward.
, but stupid. But! The process could be replicated, with science!" Tony exclaimed. "Nanites, Steve! Picture this: I'm walking along, minding my own business when out of nowhere - BAM! An AIM agent with a giant gun.
"My father would have been proud," he calls to tell Tony.
FRIDAY suddenly interrupts. "
But they’re getting better at pushing through. On those mornings, Steve will call Tony to come to him, and he always does. On those days, Tony will ask Steve to wait for him, and he always does.
"And so now Wanda listens to K-Pop every night and the rest of us suffer the consequences." Steve finishes his story and he remembers the laugh that Bucky used to give whenever he didn't think Steve was particularly funny but didn't want to hurt his feelings. He places a hand on the frosted glass and sighs. "You were always looking out for me, Buck. I'm sorry I couldn't do the same."
Night was beginning to fall. Movie night would start soon, he thought bitterly. He wondered if Stark had rigged up some robots to make genuine lazer effects light he had for that Star War film. Fury had thrown a fit.
Ty's smug face fills up the leftmost screen and Tony watches the data while he waits. Tiberius is probably sitting right next to his phone but lets it ring until the very last second before picking it up.
"'Come back soon!'"
"You're with me, Goblin," Tony tells the raving man. When they all get down to the ground there are already reporters flocking to the scene, and they call out loudly as Tony hands over Mr. Green to Captain Stacy, swarming close when he steps away. War Machine keeps Peter tucked in close to his side where his face isn't visible and hands off Luke to an exasperated Jessica Jones and a limping Daredevil.
"Nobody is," Tony says, resolutely grabbing one hand and crunching the ice under his own grip, not letting the screaming agony of that much cold on his bare skin show on his face. "I would know, I'm the one who built this damn thing."
“Enjoy your Cap nap?” he asks, and Steve groans theatrically at the terrible joke.

"It's exactly what I warned Tony about," Steve says tightly.
"For you, Panther King? I've got ages," Tony says flippantly, wishes desperately there was something he could prop himself up against. It's easier to fake being relaxed that way. "Hit me."
Steve never wanted a new life, a fresh start. But Bucky does. No, it's more than that: Bucky
"I'm flattered," Steve says flatly as he takes one step to the side, trying to get around her at least a little. "But you're not my type."
He stares at the suit, the long gash across the torso.
"If you're so furious with me, why did you come?"
of them. Your idea has merit, Stark, don't get me wrong - the Compound is great for training, but it's not sustainable for leading any semblance of a normal life. But you need to recognize what you're opening yourself up to."
But that would have to wait until the angered inside him had boiled up and over. Until he no longer felt the urge to fondly throttle Tony. Until he was sure he wouldn't yell at him again the first time he saw his stupid smirk and big brown eyes that were bound to be full of hurt that Tony would never admit to.
Kamala seems to come back to herself, squaring her shoulders. "Well, I-" And then she loses the plot again, looking to Tony like she's lost and he's a compass. "Will he really be okay? Mr. Cage. Going to a rally like that? People won't get mad?"
He pushed a hand forward so it sunk into the Fog. Steve grabbed onto his shoulder, one more wait dropping from his lips, and Tony turned. He looked…scared. Sad.
the people don't trust us anymore. I was trying to help. I was trying to fix this."
"And why is that?"
he fucking did."
I can't escape this, I can't protect people from this, the only thing I can do is try to control it, and you want to talk to me about fear?"
"You'd best get to it then," he tells her, standing up. "Supervillainy won't wait forever. I got business in the city; you need a lift, Spidey?"
Tony doesn't reply, just lets the call drop, and then carefully puts his head in his hands. "
What is this
"Of course," Vision says, while the rest of them either chorus yesses or suggest improvements. In the end, with collaboration from Agent Coulson, Tony agrees to head inside with the other two while Quake works at containment and Agent May fights on the ground with someone called Mockingbird. With Canada's final okay, the quinjet opens up and the Avengers wage war.
. You'd make it all better again, and I could get it right this time. I wouldn't let you die this time."
there?” he asked out loud.
Barnes' face tightens momentarily before easing. "Why is," he clarifies. "Any of this coming from you? I-" he chokes on whatever he's saying next, and Tony can nearly see him change the direction of the conversation. "-am the last person you should...be considering."
But Tony submits Clint and Bruce's testimony to the council with no hesitation the day before Clint's trial, along with a new contract for the Accords, fresh with Barton's signature. T'Challa and Tony fought to keep the trial private and one bright morning Tony packs the Avengers old and new into a quinjet and flies them off to Belgium where they sit and watch old men debate for five hours before sentencing Clint to a year of house arrest and five years probation. Tony thinks Natasha may have actually cried.
Hope looks down again, carefully places the two halves the Accords together so the edges line up. "I'm not here just for Scott. I want to do this. For myself and for my mother. And the Accords - my father hates the whole idea of them, which generally means its a good idea, but I can see why. Government oversight tends to lead to government control. And the fact that they threw Scott in the others in jail without a trial is terrifying."
Jan was up, taking Tony's arm, ready to steer him away. "Tones, why don't we go run some drills at the Range? Rhodey's on patrol right now but I'm sure he'd love to shoot a few rounds with you. He's still trying to beat your high score."
His temper, simmering since he awoke, snaps suddenly bright and flaring. He's stepping forward before he can stop himself. "Fine, you tell me, what's your plan? What's
"FRIDAY," he begins, dropping the notes, then stops.
I don’t need a story. I’ve lived, and sometimes that seems like tragedy enough.
Her heart settled just as soon as it had soared. “Just a cold,” Sarah Rogers lied, and tucked the blankets more firmly around her son. “He’ll be better in no time, just you wait.”
For a moment, Sam's shoulders get even tighter, and then they loosen like a string has been cut. "I know," Sam's voice comes, slightly muffled. He looks over his shoulder, his smile small but so genuine Steve doesn't know how he's been fooled by all the others. "But it's always nice to hear, Cap."
The image, combined with the old memory of Tony using the building as an example of the past being brought into the future, not being destroyed by it, makes Steve laugh at his words.
"I'm a Capricorn," Cage says testily, eyeballing the new terms.
Above all things, Tony was a scientist. So he sat down on his bed, and he tested that hypothesis.  Lined the variables up, tested them one at a time, and came up with a theory that twisted something inside him with a permanence he wouldn't realize for years.
, not to trick myself back into a HYDRA agent!" Tony shouts back. His hands are shaking in rage - and worry - and guilt. Donnie's been sleeping off the Asset state for an entire week, no one's been there to drag him back up, anything could have happened.
He tells me that we all could have done better, and we didn’t.
He swallows once, twice, then opens his mouth. "Until then, the Accords, ladies and gentlemen?"
"I could've built him again," Howard repeats, and Tony's had enough.
NATASHA:
, Natasha thought.
If only Steve had been able to give it. He looked down at his hands, then his wrist, at the strong black lines that had been there for over seven years now. Strong and true, that's what his mother said, that's why Steve tried to be, but his outsides never seemed to match. "Arnie's real patient, Buck. Ten years old and he's not worried at all. I think that's real brave."
"I'm-" he snaps his jaw shut so hard his teeth grind painfully.
They sit around the table - Bruce and Kamala marking a clear delineating line between Tony and Rhodey and Clint's family. Tony's petty enough that he told Rhodey exactly what Barton said in the Raft and now it's better to keep at least a seven foot distance between the two at all time.
He walked towards the Fog almost as if in a trance and Steve hurried after him. “Hey, wait! People don’t go back in there, just wait until I can get Professor Pym or-“
He opens one of the drawers and splutters. Well, of course they're familiar, then. "T'Challa, you sneaky son of a bitch," he mutters as he lifts an abandoned sketchbook out. He flips through it rapidly, seeing only a few pages filled, but the familiar lines of Steve's art twist at something in him.
In the set of her shoulders is a lifetime of discrimination. "Who you are has nothing to do with it," Rhodey says quietly. "That's all somebody else's ignorance, Kamala. I'm not going to lie to you and tell you that its easy or fair - people are a lot more comfortable with Tony than they are with say, me or even Natasha even though we're just as good as he is."
"Do I have a choice?" Barnes asks.
Listen to you. Does Wakanda have giant panthers that eat anyone who tries to cross the border with bad intentions?"
"You make it sound simple."
"It's not as if I would enjoy it," Bruce says the next morning, looking as if he hasn't slept. "Asking for - for something like that. Promise me that if you see him, you won't just take it, Tony."
Steve this is Bruce Banner. Tony gave me this number. I realize it's most likely only for emergencies but I figured I should touch base.
What followed was a long, lengthy discussion about Tony's decision to bring Peter to Germany - which Clint took with a surprising lack of vitriol when Tony told him that the plan was always for Spider-Man to stay at a distance - Kamala's future, Wanda and Pietro, and uncomfortable mentions of Clint's own past as a pseudo-child soldier. They didn't have time to implement the plan they made before between Tony's unintentional ice-out of Peter and Brussels, and Tony isn't sure that now is the right time, not with whatever is lurking out there and Fury playing Information Tag. But if they do this right...if they do this right it could secure the future. For when his team is gone and a new one takes their place.
“So you do know my first name,” Tony muttered under his breath. Steve’s shoulder stiffened imperceptibly and he sighed. “Look, I got the shield because it belongs to you – and you know, I figure now instead of destroying punching bags you can give the Blasting Range a try. You need to start trying new things, Cap. Because. Because you’re here now. With us. And we, um. Well, we need you.”
"You have collected a particularly resilient bunch," Vision agrees. "Or perhaps they were attracted to the same qualities they saw in you."
Bucky groans, somewhere to his left. Steve stays silent and Tony, who had tried to murder Bucky, now seems completely unconcerned with him. His eyes are fixed on Steve, big and bright.
"Oh, it's too late for that, Captain," she answers. "There is no stopping this."
"My son," she says, teasing. "You don't know the word."
Steve opened his mouth and Tony barged on. “But next time, I’ll ask –
"The Panther said
This actually gives Tony pause as he casts the man a disbelieving look. "Dummy regularly tries to poison me with motor oil in my coffee."
. Listen to me. I sound like I'm about to mug you."
"He read them. He offered many notes and comments. They are...well thought out. Things and worries that have not occured to us, the Captain has accounted for." Tony must make some sort of derisive sound because T'Challa exhales and pushes closer with the Accords. "Tony, the proposal that I have created? Some of it was made from Steve Rogers' counsel. Read it. If not for him, then for the rest of us."
"I'll get him!" Jan said. They waited for her to shrink and fly off but she merely pressed a button on a panel on the front of her suit. "Iron Man, this is Wasp. We're having a pow-wow and you're invited so get over here, Mister!"
Steve has come down for his daily chat with Bucky but his attention keeps getting drawn by the newsfeed he's set up on his tablet to keep track of the fallout from last night's battle in New York. Rhodes hasn't responded to any of his texts but frankly, that's probably a good sign.
"Shh, Small Khan," he stage whispers to her. "Don't ruin it for the others." She giggles and Tony turns the rest of the group. "Big Khan, you'll be escorting your sister in the Jag. Hope will be with you."
"I - okay," Tony breathes. FRIDAY, unbidden, reoxygenates the air he's breathing in and his head clears a little. "Okay. Viz, stay with him. Don't let go of that bomb. There's a medical room back; see if you can find any sterile bandages and patch him up. Iron Man inbound, copy?"
going to talk about this?"
He shakes his head at one point and she asks him what that's for. He holds the phone up to her, showing the text that Rogers sent late last night, just minutes after the bomb exploded. "Rogers is infringing on my gimmick. Unless he was the one who set up the bomb, I'm not entirely sure how any of this is his fault."
Tony is doing the best he can, along with the help of Colonel Rhodes, Agent Romanov, and King T'Challa. That will have to suffice for now.
"No wonder he was so effective," T'Challa says fondly, gaze turning inwards for a moment before he looks into the camera. "I am glad you woke me, though, for I have good news. France and England have promised that if the Accords can be maintained for two years they will consider our amendment to the original charter and the United States is seeing positive signs in the negotiations with the council to allow the Avengers the clause Captain Rogers suggested."
Madame Hydra draws away from him. "They whispered behind my back; I heard them every corner. They called her a failure, weak, and I even more so, but it was them, Captain. The fault lay
But what would that do, he wonders, staring back at Tony, but hurt him even more?
“Maybe he wants to know you’ll stay,” Tony added softly, and it cut through the air like a knife.
On the last page is the original of the drawing that Steve had put on the front of his copy of the Accords, the one that had caught Tony's eye and held it: symbols of the original six Avengers held together in a ring, encircling the earth. Protecting it. This one is larger, taking up the whole paper. Tony's reactor is still linked to Steve's shield, but on the other side is Barnes' star, and across the circle are Falcon's wings. A swirl that is most likely Wanda is close to Clint, a tiny ant for Scott by Bruce's radioactive hazard circle. Vision's gem is connected to Thor's hammer.
"Yeah, well," he says, and then stops, because he's got nothing. Some part of him really thought that the war was it, that everything, including himself, had been broken forever, but this isn't anything but
"He went anyway," Sam points out. "Just like last time. He broke the Accords when it really counted."
"We have," Sharon agrees mildly. "She and Tony showed me up when taking down Bucky Barnes. I was a bit surprised to hear you defending him like that today, Tony. Ignoring the Winter Soldier's previous activities, I don't remember you being one to shrug off being shot in the face like it's nothing."
basic right to exist,
Looking back, the first time Tony had met Steve had gone amazingly well. There had been Tony, stars in his eyes, shaking Steve’s hand and refusing to let go, and there had been Steve, not even trying to pull away, listening with rapt attention as Tony explained everything about the Academy and the Avengers in one impossibly long breath. And if they had just left it there, Jan mourned, if they could just limit Steve and Tony to two-sentence interactions per day, things would go great.
"So you turn to your teammates, you depend on them to help you fight back, you don't think turning yourself
"I will," he says firmly. He won't let Clint go to jail. He'll get Tony to talk to him. He'll apologize to Natasha, to Rhodey. He'll reunite Wanda with Vision. One foot in front of the other.
Now, he walked because he couldn’t stop. Couldn’t settle, couldn’t sleep, couldn’t…be. Sometimes he felt like he was still trapped in the war, and sometimes he felt guilty that he wasn’t, that he had got out.
His breath cuts short. God, he can't breathe. Vision has gotten very close in between the moments and lays a hand on the very center of Tony's back. "I do not have to know, Tony. But I am right here."
“Yeah,” Tony agreed, his voice soft. “Let’s get some hard data.”
Tony huffs. "Yep. All those fatherly lectures? You and your sister were just guinea pigs for talking down pissed politicians."
While the two pseudo-villains set to trading blows, one of the subjects of their ire was approaching the rest of the group, sweaty and panting and bleeding from a gash on his cheek. Walking beside him was Nebula, her head plate a little dented but otherwise unmarked. "Cap!" Jan cried with dismay, rising from her seat beside Groot (she was trying to help him learn Text-to-Speech so they didn't have to guess what
Fury doesn't speak, though, just waits Tony out, and it is Clint of all people who takes pity on him this time. "Tony came to the Raft, told Sam he'd been wrong about Barnes bombing the UN, then headed off to Siberia to help Steve out. Report says Zemo had already killed the other Assets?" Tony nods. "So I guess he just wanted to mess with us. Which...he did."
Tony stares blankly at him for a long moment, processing. Kamala catches at his mind worriedly but he doesn't want to disrupt the girl if she's having trouble and Donald looks as anxious as Tony's ever seen him. "You haven't gone under in, what, a week now?"
"Not on your life," Cloak mutters. He shares none of his partner's tolerance for their team's erstwhile criminal element.
Tony wishes he trusted someone enough to tell them how much he misses Obie.)
Now, Tony reaches out, places his hands on Rhodey's collarbones, and plays the notes from so long ago. "We're way too old for this," he remarks, even as a small smile begins to stretch across his face. His hands had been so small beneath his mother's, not able to stretch for the more complicated notes, but Maria had always pretended that he had. "
but he's working on it.
, he tells Tony as he brings the shield down on his neck.
"Sure, no problem," Tony says immediately, kicking himself for not realizing how long Kamala and her brother have been cooped up in here. "You and Aamir are welcome to any of the cars in the-"
Peter always thinks he can do better. He's, maybe, a bit too much like Tony for that to always be a good thing, but he's himself most of all, and that will see him through.
"So here's the deal. You're gonna give me proof that Ross gave you the leak and you're gonna give me one favor."
“What is it this time, then?”
He made the choice, once before, in a moment of loss and confusion. He'd dropped the shield, unsure of his worthiness, his place in the world as Captain America. He'd wanted to just be Steve, and Bucky could simply be Bucky, and that would be enough.
The Steve, who looked like he could eat Tony’s Steve for breakfast, cocked his head, a smile twitching at his lips that he couldn’t quite smooth away. “You sound like Tony. But you – did I –“ he suddenly looked horrified. “Did I time travel again?”
Kamala's family's funeral goes as well as a funeral can possibly go. Tony sends flowers, then apologizes since he didn't check to see if that followed custom, and Aamir thanks him anyway while Kamala tries to hold herself together. Literally. She's torn the inhibitor off and her hands have wrung out to the ground.
“Please stop talking,” Steve says, and Tony laughs because they’re both so shit at this. “It wasn’t - you didn’t do anything. It was all me.”
Bruce starts working with him and Vision and silence fills the nights once more. Tony dreams that his father pleads for his life as he's trapped in the car, waiting for the Winter Soldier to kill him. Tony dreams that he is in a cell in the raft and he can't move his arms and beyond the bars is his own face, staring back. Tony dreams of falling, falling, falling from a great height.
"Hey," she says softly, smiling. "Calling you out is the best way to break you out of your funk. It's super spy proven. But it's okay if you've got doubts, Tony. I'd be scared if you didn't. What is that charming expression you Americans use to get out of everything - 'you're only human?' That's you, Shellhead."
Tony pushed the heavy sheaf of papers away, following them down across the table until his head rested heavy on his folded arms. He was used to the weight of disappointment, but it still dragged him down sometimes. "Alas, I remain your loyal liege, Caesar," he mumbled into his elbow, hoping Ty couldn't hear the tears in his voice. "They said it was too soon for me."
"Don't get in the car," Tony mumbles. "Don't take her with you."
me.’)
"Thank you," he murmurs.
?" Madame Hydra hisses, and suddenly she is much closer, that jagged fork pressed into his neck, the phone forgotten between them. "Years ago they told me they had a breakthrough. The final solution, the dawn of a new age, and they chose my daughter to be the new Eve. I was honored." Steve is silent, watching her, his world caught between the sudden mad gleam in her eyes and four pricks of pain at his jugular. "And she lived, Captain. Her power - to behold the creation of a new species within her - it is more than I can possibly describe.
“-who only wants to help you,” Jan finished, flopping a dramatic hand over her heart. “So let me help. Why did you and Steve fight?”
"I'm sorry," Peter repeats immediately.
"What doctor?" Tony blurts. "What are you saving us from?" Suddenly a burst of gunfire echoes loud over their comms and Tony hears Rhodey curse. He switches his speakers to private. "War Machine, report!"
"Well, I know I kind of botched this the first time, but I think he'd be proud of you," Tony offers. "Whatever you decide, thank you for looking out for them."
"You're a bad hugger," Peter tells his shoulder.
Obadiah patted his knee absent-mindedly. "Well, that's not unexpected, is it, old boy? She's always placed a lot of stock in soulmates." Obie threw a casual wink his way. "She would, wouldn't she, landing the cream of the crop!"
So while Malik was motivated by blind zeal, Sarkissian is motivated by something a bit more personal. Still completely HYDRA though, obviously.
"And you won't let anyone help with Donald even though you don't have enough time for him-"
"Lang sent himself to jail," Tony bites back shortly, touching the paper with just the tips of his fingers. It's a letter. Of course it is. "After being told that his actions would land him in jail. Maybe he is a truly good man, Ms. van Dyne, but even good men have to face consequences for what they do."
The man smiles. "As I said, I am here to help. I'll be blunt." And the man's accent slips away entirely to something familiar. Boston. "I'm an agent of SHIELD, Captain Rogers, and I've been made. The Dora are probably looking for me as we speak."
"So, he said yes," Tony opens lamely when T'Challa does not turn or speak for an entire minute. "Where is he?"
Laura takes the keys from his hand with a smile. "We'll be fine, Tony." Clint and the two of them had decided that Vision was the best option to protect the Bartons from any harm. They would be taking one of the boxes Tony reserved.
"And I always will be. We were friends first, Tony." But her eyes are so sad. Tony has been a hard experience for her.
You can strike where we can't but you're no good to anybody flying blind.
"You're hurting people, Double D. I'll have a copy of the Accords on this rooftop tomorrow night. I'll come back a week from now. Tell me what you think."
"Say no," he says, leaning forward, urgent,
“I thought you said Tony wasn’t your type,” Natasha said faintly, still trying to process.
for a reason. I can't let it go to waste."
They had been saying it all along, each in their own ways, each trying to help. He'd forgotten, oh
"So," Natasha says, and when Tony looks back Rhodey's gaze is now directed at the other screen Tony has up. "That doesn't look like the armor."
With that parting blow, he finally let Sam drag him away, leaving Tony staring after him, stiff and cold as a statue since his father’s name passed through Steve’s lips.
"I see I was not missed," T'Challa says, raising one eyebrow. He turns and begins walking down the sidewalk without waiting for Tony, who splutters for a moment before grudgingly following him. "I was expecting a report on what happened. None were received."
Peggy and Bucky, young and whole, the Howling Commandos at his back and a war to fight for the side of justice, Howard and Colonel Phillips. He can't let go of all that. That's who he is, and if he lets go, if he accepts that he's lost all of that, then who is he supposed to be? It isn't
(He had come out of that surgery to find Rhodey by his bedside in a wheelchair, holding the cleaned remains of the fiberglass in his hands, running his fingers over the deep cracks that had come from the suit's reactor being driven into Tony's chest.
He personally swung the shield at Black and Gold himself, rejoicing in the solid thud it made on impact instead of the clanging noises that woke him up at night. T'Challa's gift of vibranium could not be more welcome.
Aleksander Lukin is an intimidatingly tall man, his eyes a near electric blue and cold and his mouth set in a smirk that borders on a sneer. And the first thing he does is hold out a hand for Tony to shake.

He looks at Steve.
For now. They needed my help with an experiment.
BUT THEY DO EXIST. Can you please just fucking deal with it? You could be here right now, helping Tony and T'challa amend them. Theyre not going away, not with Tony Stark behind them. This is real Steve.
Both. You said yourself you wanted to make some deals with them. This is just me lending my brilliant boss a hand.
"Good. Stay there. I'll call back later. FRIDAY, scan what we can and get it to Spider-Man. Get the Mark II ready for-" Suddenly the explosions stop and something - someone emerges from the building, standing on one of Oscorp's prototype gliders and holding Peter by the throat. "What the fuck is that?"
“Not really. On average, they’re getting better. Something must have set one of them off early today.”
I have been informed many times. I know it to be true. The fact that even one person survived the initial attack was a miracle.
Tony rears back. "What - no - that's not," he splutters. He feels like his head isn't on straight.
"How 'bout I hand you your ass and you go to jail?" Cage shouts back.
Clint sneers. "I've seen what your help looks like. No thanks."
"It's all he's got," he tells her simply. "It's his life. It's all I can give, and from what I can see I'm the only one who can give it."
It is amazing between all this worry that it occurs to Tony that maybe he hasn't worried enough.
There is a brief pause, and then:
"Guess we don't really have time for waiting?" he murmurs.
Tony’s hand are so tight around his arms. He tries to focus on that, on the feel of them, on Tony’s back muscles moving under his fingers. But he’s floating somewhere, or sinking down, to wherever Bucky hides now, wherever Peggy’s mind goes, wherever Dum Dum and Morita and Phillips went after they passed. Steve never keeps anything good. “Don’t leave me,” he repeats. “Don’t.”
2. This was written before the casting of Brie Larson as Carol Danvers. IMO, Ms. Larson, though a wonderful actress, is far too young to play Carol. I intend to keep her canon pairing of Carol/Rhodey, so just envision her as the Charlize Theron/Katheryn Winnick I saw, if you would.
. It rips apart slowly under his hands, zigging and zagging him through the air until he breaks some essential component and it sputters to a stop, dropping like a stone and taking him with it. He cannot get untangled before he lands, hard, on the street, but there is no time for the burst of pain spreading out through his chest, because someone is screaming.
"Snagged it off of Diamondback," Steve counters, carefully setting the tray up. "Had to go and switch it out. It would be awfully inconvenient for us if you died of arsenic poisoning, ma'am." He smiles, the one he used to shower politicians and bureaucrats with, the one they never knew was cold because they never knew Steve Rogers.
Steve smiled fondly even as a tiny furrow appeared between his brows. "You don't have to show up the entire galaxy, Tony. I think what you're doing now is more than enough."
"I hate surprises," Ty grumps and Tony finds himself laughing almost against his will.
Tony releases a tranquilizer dart and the man collapses. "Bomb's secured," he barks over the comms. "Check in."
So, no. Maybe Steve couldn't tell Sam about that. Captain America is supposed to be better than that.
“That’s a lot of maybes,” Steve repeated, like that last sentence wasn’t a lance through his heart.
"Kamala, you're sixteen. Mom and Dad would never-"
Steve moves.
"Sir," he says dutifully, letting Vision lower him into a chair.
"Guided falling," Jessica corrects. "You need help?"
He takes the phone out. He dials.
Coulson doesn't fight his grimace this time. "We're hoping to avoid that."
“So,” he began gruffly, then cleared his throat. “This wasn’t an apology?”
Clint comes to in the middle of the Avengers' scheduled debrief and between his mouth and the constant pinging of alerts through both his helmet and War Machine's Tony is impressed he hasn't strangled anyone.
Wanda's small hand fits into his and Steve tears his gaze away from Bucky, looking down at her. "I'm going to miss you," he tells her. She shrugs off the affection, as she is prone to do, always more comfortable giving than receiving.
“Tony, I never said that,” Jan interjected, soft but firm.
"Then I suggest you leave him with me," Tony snaps. "Where he's comfortable." Coulson's pale eyes flash with interest and Tony quickly steps away. "We got a deal?"
"Oh." Steve's face fell, shoulder slumping. Were he and Tony really that bad? He knew they had their disagreements, but he thought they'd been getting better.
, I should say. Truly, that's it. We won't die or anything."
B) 'What the hell did you do that to Kamala for?'
Bruce leaves with the day's research and Tony watches Donnie rock his body back and forth until his eyes begin tracking again. "Fuck," he hears over the intercom. "Fuck, fuck, fuck!"
"Tony. My little genius, there's no need for all this," Ty said."You're wasting your energy and frankly I am exhausted watching you. Remember that article I showed you? Remember what it said?"
"Oh, yes, I can just imagine that now," Tony scoffs, and Natasha and Bruce look over, the former matching his cocked eyebrow with her own. "'Mr. Stark, we see here that on the 3rd of December you transferred a large amount of secured Avengers file to an unknown, untraceable number. Would you mind telling us more about this?"
? Uh, yeah, it was better. The guy killed your dad, T'Challa, and a whole lot of other good people. He deserves to rot."
Until Tony's big guns arrive, care of Kamala is split between him and Vision as they try to figure out a way to stabilize her. Natasha has been, in her own way, worried about their orphaned guest, letting the two of them work away in the lab while all missions are handled between herself, Rhodey, and an accommodating T'Challa, who dropped by once for a few hours and fell seamlessly into place between Vision and Tony before leaving again with the promise of Wakandan aid. Peter Parker has also been a godsend, occupying Donald Gill's time when Tony can't be with him, helping him shake off the vestiges of the Asset state whenever Donnie fails a trigger.
Tony nods, swallows down the bile in his throat. Manages to keep it down the whole way into the city, but it is very near thing when he walks into his mansion and sees Bruce Banner sitting in the living room, eyes growing green in the darkness.
"I don't want you going in," Donnie says roughly, looking down at him. "I don't want you there, okay?"
Arnim Zola whispers in his ear.
?" Spider-Man's beaten down voice echoes through the helmet. "
Tony calls the Trauma Olympics an ‘unprecedented draw,’ but we still meet up and talk. Slowly it spreads, to the day, to the evening, to our entire lives.
"Ma'am, I-" Peter sounds terrified; Tony doesn't blame him. Pepper's got enough ice in her voice to freeze the Hudson.
Everett rises as well and they shake hands again. "Take care, Mr. Stark."
"Wow. What ringing endorsement. I'm gonna have FRIDAY investigate him anyway. In the meantime, you want to head into New York with me?" Tony asks, slipping on his sunglasses so he can start reading the information FRIDAY's already pulling on General Lukin. "I found out who got the video onto TV."
"And if I Spider-Man anyway?"
Of course that is when things go wrong.
"Oh you poor fools," Madame Hydra laughs, lifting the hand with the detonator. "You truly think
"Explain."
"Nice to finally meet you, Mr. Stark. We've all heard great things about you." Her smile is as warm and her grip is tight over his and Tony doesn't know which one to trust.
"You go too easy on him," Howard muttered now, his eyes falling to Tony's wrists again. His son wore sweaters and long sleeves exclusively now, bought a size too big so they swallowed his hands entirely or elastic sewn into the cuffs so they pulled tight across the wrist. Howard didn't know when that happened, for he never instructed Jarvis or Ana to adjust Tony's clothing, only that one day Maria had dropped a cup on the ground after six year old Tony had held his arms up for a hug, and the next day Tony was in a jacket that seemed glued to his wrists.
“Joseph!” she cried next, even as she knew it was useless. The room was filled with the cold light of dawn, and Joseph would already be gone to work, sleeping off last night’s drink in an unused lifeboat. She was alone.
Natasha tries out a teasing smile. "Always picking up after you boys."
Barnes snorts. "I don't think we need to go as far as that. Stevie'd kill me if I let something happen to you."
"Sure," Bruce says easily, after a moment, and Tony really loves him for that. He doesn't deserve his friends. "Let me show you where I'm at on the nanobots for Donnie. I needed your help anyway with the schematics..."
(Joseph Rogers never came home.
Her mouth opens and closes, but nothing comes out, so Tony nods in her direction and turns. "Tony," she calls, and he has never heard her say his name before. He looks over his shoulder. Wanda's face is closed, shut off, but her eyes are suspiciously bright and knowing. "Your mind is very loud, as well."
There is a moment, before the masquerade begins, that three knocks echo softly in the comms, sending Natasha briefly into full alert until Tony apologizes. Then he stands, whispering to Donnie that he might be awhile, and exits into the lobby to climb the stairs to the roof. Peter Parker is waiting for him at the door, and after a quiet order to FRIDAY, they head outside to the cold night air. From here they can see Times Square lit up bright, the big screens displaying advertisements and short videos and twenty-four hour news.
His phone rings, saving him from his thoughts, and T'Challa's grumpy face that Tony didn't have the balls to tell him how cat-like it was appears on his screen. "He has a flair for drama," he mutters out loud, and answers. It's time to hear Barnes' choice.
"Now!" Peter's arm jerks, the web's speed checked and its trajectory unbalanced and Tony reaches the girl just in time to get a hand under her neck and lower back and pull up as the web catches her ankle. "Vitals, FRIDAY!"
very much,” he admitted quietly to the ground. “Maybe that’s universal, is all. Multi-universal, actually.”
"So," Tony breathes out. "It has recently come to my attention that I might be kind of an ass."
"If he left the shield with you, he's coming back," Kamala says confidently. "Captain America doesn't just give up." Her
“What?”
Tony laid down, exhausted now, his right hand drifting automatically to clutch his left wrist to guard a secret that would never be told. As he slept, he dreamed his old dream, searching for somebody who wasn't coming. But this time he swam too far, too deep, and he froze. From the inside out.
Pepper makes a distressed noise, pushes her forehead tight to his suit and holds him close. "This isn't your fault, Tony, it never was. Sweetheart, just sit with me for a moment, alright? Tony?"
His brow furrows, then his mind skips backwards in the conversation, makes the connection. He almost smiles. "Not the worst thing that's been said about it."
He turns to Fury, glancing to make sure Sam is ready, and after his partner says his goodbyes to T'Challa, they step forward into the darkness, Steve looking over his shoulder for one last look at Wanda, one last prayer for Bucky, before he slips through darkness for a long disorienting moment. "Keep walking," Cloaks warns, and Steve takes a step forward, stumbling just a bit when his first step meets nothing. The next meets hard concrete, and the darkness is gone.
“Tony,“ Steve sighed, looking over his shoulder. “Can’t we just-“
Tony knows he should be honest since Vision was, but he can't. There are some things he still needs to hold close. "You know, I'd really just settle for not dreaming about snow."
"You went inside his mind?" Tony asks.
FRIDAY agrees, but he doesn't take it personally. The memory of JARVIS hangs heavy over FRIDAY, somewhat literally. It's not her fault that she's not as fast or as clever, and the guilt over that will probably eat Tony alive someday once every other horrible thing he's done stops gnawing on his soul.
The king's hand grips tight on the door. "If you change your mind," he offers, and then he is gone.
Libya is nice enough to let the quinjet hover in their airspace while they work. The death toll climbs and Tony gives it one more try, reaching for the phone. "We don't have to send in the whole team, but Iron Man and War Machine could make a world of difference-"
He got the grin lingering at the corner of Bucky's mouth and felt his own mouth curve in response. "And we fight 'em together?" Steve liked the sound of that. "Like in the stories?"
“No?” Tony breathed, and then he shook himself, scrambling to his feet. Right. Science. This was what he was supposed to be good at. “I mean, no! I don’t think so. Otherwise you’d be my Steve too, and he’s full grown and let me tell you buddy, you are like two of him.”
it says.
It doesn’t snap everything magically back into place, but then again they don’t want to go back. They don’t kiss; they are explicitly not a couple, although lately the word ‘yet’ has been thrown around an awful lot whenever they repeat the denials to their friends. The kind of forgiveness, love, and trust that they are cultivating takes time.
Terrigenesis to do. Tony could take the sample from Kamala's blood and use it on a lab rat at this very moment, and if that lab rat was lucky enough to live, it would have an entirely different skill set than Kamala, even with the same exact formula in its blood.
Almost against his will, Tony's fingers begin to beat out
“Tony…” Jan began, but for the first time ever, Tony shrugged off her embrace.
T'Challa doesn't ask who he's talking about, just simply takes the Accords in his hands and looks down at the little drawing that Steve has sketched in the space between the symbols for the Accords, the Avengers Initiative, and the UN. It's the world, the North and South America, Europe and Africa shaded dark, with a circle around it. Equidistance apart in the circle are six little breaks, miniature circles, each containing different symbols. Steve's star, Natasha's hourglass, Clint's bow, Bruce's sardonic radioactive hazard sign, Thor's hammer, and Tony's old arc reactor.
"You would fly, Tony. Such great heights," Howard muses into his ear. Tony rubs at it with an upraised shoulder, eyes never moving. "Maybe you could finally match me, son. Maybe you could understand."
The United States is a problem in and of itself. It doesn't want UN control but it has by far the highest number of meta- or super-humans, so it doesn't want to
She looks thoroughly unimpressed. "Because reading politicians and board members takes no skill at all. Stop being prickly and work with me, boss."
“Nope,” Jan said, popping the ‘p’ with acidic glee. “Not until they reach a certain decibel.”
"But I did," Barnes says to the table, quiet.
Steve shook his head, and Tony’s mouth twisted in an odd grin-grimace. “You think they don’t want to do the same for you, fearless leader?”
What a turn-around, he thought, his mind still whirling with the fight from earlier. Wasn't Tony the one who had once begged him to let the Avengers in and realize he wasn't alone? He should have known Tony would be terrible at taking his own advice. There was just - there was no need for it! Steve, Jan, the others, they would always be there to fight by his side. Sometimes Tony acted like the Avengers were just there to be his test subjects for his latest and greatest creation.
The man smiles and there is a creeping darkness around the edges of his frame. "Only if they see me coming." The darkness expands and then contracts and Steve is left blinking at the place where the man once stood.
. He can see it now: not the cracks and fissures that have always been there, but the places they can be mended and patched over.
Steve had written, and it had carved out Tony's heart. Not even Captain America had spared a thought for saving Tony Stark.
"Of what?!"
“That’s – not at all why I was asking,” Tony muttered, but there was a difference in the way he looked at him now.
Or, more likely, Howard would never have forgiven him anyway, because even a genius like Howard Stark couldn't figure out why his only son made him so angry. Tony has a theory; Tony has dozens, he's a scientist. But his father is dead and gone and has been for twenty five years. There's no one to test his theories on anymore. There's just a headstone to visit and a legacy to maintain and the ghost of Howard left in Tony's footsteps, making them heavier than they should be.
"No. We defeat the threats when they come, and we do it together. We don't play God and we don't go looking for fights to prove how superior we are. How long would it be before you turned those satellites on your enemies on Earth? How long before you started sending out the Legion to patrol the population instead of just respond to threats?"
Everett observes Tony for a few moments then leans back in his chair, running a finger along his brow. "Their families were found and the ashes were returned to them."
"Something Vision said," she clarifies with a faraway look in her eyes. "Do you think we create our own monsters?"
“But it didn’t,” Tony insists. “It happened, we fixed it, it’s over. Steve,” and he sits up inside the circle of Steve’s arms and he’s so close and all Steve can think of is to drag him closer, so he does. Tony is so warm against, so soft. So
Clint picks up the slack, looking at Kamala. "I know you haven't signed, but if you did I'd like you to consider the same. The fact of the matter is, you two are crazy powerful but you're not trained to be on a team. That takes
"To save the world," Sam reminds him pointedly, but it only riles Scott up further.
More handshakes and nods and Lukin and Carter leave them on the outskirts of the tarmac. Vision watches them go, head tilted to the side, before turning to Tony. "I am still learning about human behavior but that was...weird, was it not?"
Bruce shrugs. "I know Ross isn't a problem anymore but I think keeping a low profile is in my best interest right now."
"I was warned of your over-inflated ego. Do you truly believe you are the only one who can turn the tide, Captain? You have been weighed and measured and found wanting. HYDRA has corrected this error, like we always have. The good doctor warned you but you didn't listen."
And what if something like Chad happens all over again? I'm just supposed to sit back.
"Is completely outdated?" Diamondback finishes cheerfully, falling dutifully in place to guard the door for all her bluster. "Back from when they wore Hugo Boss and ripped their faces
"You look terrible," Peter tells him. He looks comical in regular street clothes with the mask pulled over his head, but Tony doesn't comment. It'd be a bit hypocritical when he was the one threatening the others if they mentioned Spider-Man's other identity.
Tony thinks. Wakanda has a sense of humor, it seems) airport in Wakanda's capital, but his sister, the Princess Shuri. She has the same even dark skin tone as her brother and the same round face, but her eyes slant where his do not, her cheekbones a certain type of defined that T'Challa - or really anybody - will never achieve.
Howard and Maria exchange a look and his father meets Tony's eyes in the rearview mirror. "It's your dream, kid. You asking me, or you asking you?" Which was honestly such a Howard thing to say; Tony hates him all over again. The car turns and the city gives way to trees and undergrowth. Behind them, Tony hears a bike revving.
CLINT:
"I thought you didn't approve of my methods, Rogers," Rachel says.
“Oh my God,” Tony whispered to thin air.
There is no slow struggle of emotion; it rushes up in him and Tony is shaking apart all over his mother's headstone before his next breath. "I should have - I really messed up, guys, I'm so. I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to but it just - I was being good, I swear and it got out of my control. I'm, I'm so sorry. I shouldn't have let this happen to you. You've had enough."
Tony leans back so he can look at her better. "Is this a sit-rep? Are we sit-repping, Nat? Do I need to call a team meeting?"
"No, that's good enough for me," Steve replied. Reluctantly, he let go of Tony's arm and the man took a few stumbling steps back to the Time Fog, his eyes never leaving Steve. He stopped just on the edge, seemingly unable to go further and let Steve disappear. Goodbyes, Steve knew, were always the hardest. "My Tony's got a suit of armor, too, you know."
