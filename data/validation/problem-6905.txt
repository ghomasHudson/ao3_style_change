The thought was a bit of a thrill.  He’d always admired Tony Stark.  Wished he could be half as good as he was, back when.  Steve didn’t examine it too much, just moved onto another stretch. But really, competing against Tony Stark, when Stark was at his best, and so was he?  The whole idea was amazing.  Exciting.  Stark didn’t even know who Steve was, he was sure, but Steve remembered him.  Tony’d been notorious for being a party boy, for skating hungover, and him only sixteen, but he’d been amazing, even still.  Even with only one quad jump.
Tony narrowed his eyes at him as he pulled away, bent to take off his skates.  “No ego on you at all, is there?” he asked.
, and then there were two fingers, slick and wet with something, pressing against him there, against his hole, just like Brock had done earlier through his jeans, and then they were pushing unceremoniously inside, and it was the first time anyone’s fingers other than his own had ever been inside Steve, and he felt himself gasp against the bed and it hitched in his chest, as a wave of heat went through him and he felt so very aware of his cock bobbing cold and wet in the air now that his pants were down around his knees.  He was sweating, and he couldn’t seem to get a breath in.  He clenched his hands in the blankets and dragged in an unsteady, heaving breath, and then Brock’s fingers, callused and rough, dragged along something inside him and it felt so good,
The kiss went on for quite a while after that—Steve didn’t really know how long, just that he got his hands under Tony’s sweater and Tony put his mug down and started running his hands into Steve’s hair, all over his neck, up and down his shoulders and his chest, kissing him deep and slow, and by the time they stopped and rested their foreheads together, panting, Steve’s mouth was stinging and swollen and beautifully sore, and Tony’s looked wet and swollen, and Tony shuddered and groaned and threw back his head and laughed breathlessly when Steve leaned forward and dragged his tongue over that shining wetness on Tony’s bottom lip, swirling it to the side and over, one last time.  Steve smiled and thumbed at those puffy lips, wondering if they were as tender as his felt, and Tony shuddered for him.  Steve stroked his hand down his neck and smiled at him again.  “God, you kiss like a million bucks,” he said.
, and bent his head to sink his teeth into the sore flesh around one throbbing areola.  And then Tony was holding him by the shoulders as he bit and sucked bruises into Steve’s sensitive nipple, the flesh of his sensitive tit, until he was whimpering, his cock throbbing, chest heaving as his whole body shook on each breath, and then Tony started all over again with the other one.
Tony’s face did something odd, his mouth going soft and trembling until he bit his bottom lip, and he patted Steve’s hand, reached up and stroked his thumb along his jaw, making Steve go warm and shivery all over again, before he dropped it and sat back up.  “Thanks,” Tony said roughly, then cleared his throat and blinked quickly. “Um, I had some ice chips for you,” he said.  “I bet you’d like that.  Hold on just a second, tiger.”
, as he let Steve.  Steve’s fingers in his wet hole didn’t even hurt, despite their size, so he really must be relaxed.  He knew he was flushing, but then Steve just kissed his shoulder again, reached down to stroke his cock gently, fingering idly at the soft head, running his fingers around it.  Tony was a lot less sensitive than Steve was, there, being circumcised and well, not the peak of human perfection, but that meant it wasn’t as overwhelmed to be touched just there after he’d come.  It hurt, a little, overwhelming, making him shiver with the sensation, but it felt good, too.  He sighed, relaxed into Steve’s touches.
The pleasure crested higher and higher, and Tony wasn’t even sure when he first started to come, when the pleasure crossed over into that of his peak, just that suddenly he was flying so high and so hot that his whole body was tingling with hot, bright pleasure, and he was crying out, lifting his hips into it, everything swallowed up by the pleasure except the knowledge that that was Steve’s mouth around him, Steve was making him feel this good, Steve’s soft hair under his hands, because that made it even better, made the pleasure feel even sweeter.  He knew he was coming when he was halfway through his orgasm, could feel his cock pulsing, pumping out come, as he flew off the peak and hung there in the air, and the pleasure shuddered through him in wave after wave.
“Merry Christmas, big guy,” Tony said, eyes soft as he looked up into Steve’s face once he had him situated comfortable sideways on his lap.  He brought his hand up, cupped the side of Steve’s face gently, palm against his jaw, and stroked his cheek with his thumb.
“How do you want me,” he murmured, pressing their cheeks together, running his hands up and down Steve’s chest, over those hot, heaving pecs, pressing, teasing at those red, flushed, perky nipples, squeezing them between his fingers, rubbing at them. Steve dragged in a harsh breath, shivered under him, hands sliding down, squeezing at the back of Tony’s neck. “C’mon, just let me know, big guy.”
“Do my best,” Steve said, smiling a little.  Being good and obedient hadn’t been his strong suit even when he was a soldier, but somehow he always wanted to do his best for Tony.  He curled both arms around Tony, hugged him close, let his body relax into his, against him.  Tony was all lean muscle and strength against him, under him, and Steve just wanted to curl up around him and never leave.  Nothing felt as—as good as this, as perfect, as—as safe, as this, curled up against Tony in Tony’s bed in the mansion, the bigger-than-king bed that fit both of them with room to spare, that smelled like Tony, soap and aftershave, the crispness of clean cotton sheets warm and soft and fresh on his skin, the firm but soft pillows that he could just sink into, Tony’s living warmth there against him, the reassuring security of Tony’s presence, his strength, his comforting presence and how he made Steve feel sheltered and looked after and, and loved in ways Steve didn’t often let himself feel.  He always tried to be—to be strong, not a problem or a burden or a drain, doubted he’d have imposed himself like this on most of his other lovers, but Tony always made it feel more than okay, like it was a favor to him instead of the other way around.
.  He could see Tony’s lips forming the words, but they didn’t really make any sense. Steve dragged in his breath, blinked again, and felt a swoop of vertigo as things started to come back together again. He’d been thrown free of the building in an explosion.  He’d landed on his back in the street, which was why he’d been staring up at the sky. His shield and his shield arm were lying on his chest.  The ringing in his ears slowly started to subside, but with that came a wave of nausea and the absolute conviction that if he so much as tilted his head he’d puke up his entire guts, the feeling crawling over him like a horde of Hank’s damn ants.  He swallowed, gulped, uncomfortably.  God, his head hurt.
“Yeah,” Steve said, and slapped his round, red rump lightly, but loud enough to make a sound, hard enough that Tony jolted and then gave a groaning, breathy laugh.  “For now, buster.”
Steve could feel himself go red, an even deeper red, hot all the way down over the back of his neck, over his ears.  “I, um. Is that a yes?” he asked.
“You know I do,” Steve breathed, fighting the urge to just sink to his knees in front of Tony, press his face to his thigh, wrap his arms around his hips and thighs, maybe suck his cock, if Tony wanted him to.  Tony pranced back over, shaking his hips and all, and gripped Steve’s hands in his own, smiling down at him, running his thumbs over the backs of his hands, before he pulled him up.  Steve just let him, let Tony slide his hands under his wrists and brace him, use all that strength to help lever him up to his feet, watching the flex of Tony’s muscles with dreamy appreciation.
“Yeah, I figured,” Tony murmured, after a long moment.  What Steve kept doing to his prostate, how he kept rubbing at and stroking along his inner walls, was incredibly distracting.  “Your dick, am I guessing right, here, tiger?”
Steve almost always woke up quickly, instantly alert and ready, even when it was nothing more than an average morning, but this time, he came awake slowly, his thoughts feeling slow and thick.  There was a warm, pleasant feeling of caressing pressure against his scalp, through his hair, the weight of a hand he recognized, that went along with the scent surrounding him, pleasant and familiar, the crisp scent of a familiar cologne with an undercurrent of motor oil, metal, and grease.  He opened his eyes and smiled up at Tony.
“Good boy,” he said, and his voice was still very hoarse.  “I wonder how soon I could get you to come again, huh?  Any bets?”
“Yeah, an itsy-bitsy spider clued me in, big fella,” Tony said.  “That you’d gone down, and hard, too.  Everything all right on the many-headed snake front?”
“How bad is it?” Steve asked.  He wanted to reach up, touch his face, make sure he wasn’t burned too badly, but Tony was holding his hand now and he didn’t want to waste that. Tony’s thumb was rubbing warm circles on his hand underneath the tape.  “Did I—there was an explosion?”
Tony smiled again, and it seemed even softer and sweeter than before, somehow.  “Not the point either, slugger,” he said, and his thumb was rubbing a soft path along the side of Steve’s hand.
“Well, if that’s true,” Steve said, his mouth a line of determination, “I want to blow you.  But you’ve gotta tell me how to do it right, how to please you, Stark.  All right?  That a deal?”
pain, tingling and hot, lingering in his skin, on the edge of pleasure until he couldn’t quite tell the difference.  Tony had given it to him perfectly, laid down marks until they formed crosshatching, little squares all over his rear, that Steve could still feel hot and stinging and swollen.  He suddenly wanted Tony to rub his rear more, to make it hurt more, to tug and pinch and massage his marked cheeks.
“That feels really good,” Tony told him, and it came out soft, low.  He knew he was still floating, stupid with sex and the way Steve had used him so perfectly, so exactly how he’d wanted, by the fact that he’d said it at all, but he couldn’t find it in himself to wish it back.  “You have about a million years to stop.”
“I’m just glad you liked it,” he said, and it was so sweetly sincere that something seized up in Tony’s chest, a lump clumping in his throat.
Tony kept at it for a—a long time.  Steve wasn’t sure how long.  His sense of time had completely dissolved, washed away by pleasure and pain and the constant wonder of Tony’s hands on him, Tony’s hands on his chest, his pecs, teasing at his skin, at his nipples, pulling on the weights until Steve was gasping and his face felt sweaty and wet.  Tony even reached up after a while, playing with perfect, insistent, pleasure with his fingertips at Steve’s nipple, setting the clamp, the weight, swinging with his other hand, and pressed the backs of his fingers to Steve’s cheek, rubbed where his skin felt sweaty and damp, wet, then turned his hand over and stroked it there gently.  “Shh, big fella,” Tony murmured, soft and warm and low and soothing in his ear, and Steve was too far gone to even speak, just gasping against him, squirming, breathless, “shh, sweetheart.”  He pinched at Steve’s almost numb nipple, and Steve gasped, arched back against him, couldn’t help it, and then Tony slapped at his tit again and Steve almost came all over again.  He could feel the way his toes clenched tight in the covers of the bed, the way his back arched and the hoarse cry that tore out of his throat.
Tony wasn’t sure if that was a euphemism for oral sex or if Steve meant it exactly how it had sounded, but he supposed that each was as accurate as the other.  “I’ve always thought practice made perfect,” he said, keeping it light.  “So, if that was a question, sweetheart, yes; I’ve done my best.  I take it you’re appreciating the results?”
Steve moaned, buried his face against Tony’s neck, dragged in a deep breath.  “Okay,” he mumbled.  “Okay, sweetheart.”  He kissed Tony’s neck, then put both hands at his waist, his hips, holding him tight as he pushed him back up, irresistibly, impossibly strong, back onto all fours. “Hold onto the mirror again, beautiful,” he murmured in Tony’s ear, and Tony gasped, shaking at the feeling of Steve’s hard cock shifting inside him, obediently reached out and gripped the sides of the mirror, trying to center himself.  Steve laid both big, warm hands on Tony’s hips, gripped him, and then started to fuck him, really fuck him, this time, deep and long, with quick, efficient strokes.  It wasn’t rough, but it was deep and thorough, and after just a few, it was all Tony could do to hang on, squeezing his eyes shut again, looking in the mirror too overwhelming as Steve thrust and thrust into him, shuddering sensation lighting up his overworked prostate, Tony swaying slightly, helpless, with each thrust. He was overwhelmed, exhausted, legs trembling, gasping on every thrust in, but he didn’t care, he loved it; this was perfect, Steve taking his pleasure from him, every overwhelming thrust designed for Steve, not Tony, making all of Tony’s overworked nerves fire and jangle all at once.
“You definitely know what you’re doing,” Steve said, going even redder in the face, even as he turned his face in toward Tony’s caresses.  “It’s, um, it’s been.”  He was going redder and redder.  “I mean, you’re real swell at it.”
“Now,” Tony said.  “Now that you’ve come, lovely, you can put all that enviable focus to work on me, right?”  He winked.
“But Steve, honey,” Tony gasped, and lifted his head.  “You, you haven’t.  Can I. Can I make you, you come first? Please?”
Before he finished Steve moved back up to his shoulders again, painting them with the soft white leather, the creamy velvet of the tails, over the hot, sensitive skin, watching Tony as he trembled, keeping an eye on it.  It was a long time before he thought Tony had had enough, and Tony was very, very hard by then, moaning as he rubbed his cock unthinkingly up against the pillow.  Steve set the flogger aside, stepped in, having to adjust himself through his pants as he did and groaning out through his nose at the pressure on his needy, hot, wanting cock, before he stroked over Tony’s rear, his shoulders, again, and heard him make a startled noise, felt him jump under his hands.
“Why would I hate you?” Steve asked, feeling his stomach twist strange and bitter, a sour taste in the back of his throat.  “I barely even know you.  I don’t know the first thing about who you really are.  I’m not going to hate someone for being better than me.”
“God,” Tony breathed.  “If—if you’re sure.  You were so good, baby, so good.”  He pushed himself up enough to press a kiss to the back of Steve’s neck, his ear, his hair, and Steve shivered pleasantly, hid his smile against his arms.  “So, so good,” Tony murmured, lips traveling down Steve’s neck, behind his ear, against his pulse.  He traced his fingers lightly over Steve’s chest, his clavicles, rubbed at his pecs above his nipples, and Steve shuddered, because oh, oh, that was sensitive, felt his cock jerk again, tiredly.  “Couldn’t have asked for better, or for more.  You give it up so beautifully.  You give me everything.  You’re perfect.  Are you sore here?”
at Tony, and Tony had to close his eyes, take a deep breath, as his big hand curved around Tony’s cheek, rubbed at his chin, the hinge of his jaw, and he said, “Okay, good, that’s good.”  His fingers brushed softly, gently, over Tony’s mouth, and he said, “Thank you, Tony, sweetheart.  I really mean it.”
Steve pulled off, lapped gently at the head, licking at it, around it, tongue so warm and wet over the sensitive flesh, and then muttered, hoarsely, “It’s real, Stark.  I’m here.  Believe it.”
God, it felt incredible. Tony’s mouth was always incredible, so hot and wet and perfect, and he knew just how to suck, just how to use his tongue, and—this time around it was hot and wet and messy and sloppy, Tony was clearly all over the place, just suckling wet and sloppy and hot at his tip, sucking and wet, then bobbing his mouth down over him, down and down until Steve was in his throat and he was swallowing and choking wetly, and Steve almost pulled him off despite the brilliant, unbelievable wet pleasure, before Tony swallowed again and the choking eased off and there was just the tight, soft, velvet clench of his throat, dragging along him before he pulled back again and mouthed all sloppy and wet at his tip, sucking on it like it was a popsicle, dragging his head back and forth, thrusting it in and out of his own mouth like there was a prize for most determined cocksucker on offer and Tony was goddamn determined to get it, before he went down on him again.
The praise felt wonderful, warm and soft, settled in his belly like a glow, but Steve’s mind had caught up on something earlier.  “’Course I’m sure,” he murmured into his arms.  “And ‘course I’m sore.  Wasn’t that the point?  ‘S good though.  I like it.”
Steve had known he still shouldn’t—Rumlow was his subordinate, for God’s sake, and kissing him outside a bar bathroom didn’t change that, however it had felt—but Rumlow knew what he was doing, he clearly knew what he was doing, on the field and off of it, with a pool cue and with his mouth as well as a gun, and Steve so often felt like he didn’t have a clue, about any of it, and it felt like the first time he’d been able to forget all about that in—in a long time (the last time he’d been to Stark Tower, and Tony had smiled at him and taken his hand with both of his and patted the top of it and squeezed, but that hadn’t lasted, Tony had been off like a shot a second later, talking about a thousand different things Steve didn’t understand in a way that felt like it was subtly mocking him for how he couldn’t keep up, and they’d ended up snapping at each other all over again, however little Steve had wanted to—he’d been so determined to get along with Tony that time, to tell him he wanted to move into the Tower, to show him how much he wanted to be friends, but—well, he hadn’t done any of those things, and he’d ended up moving out to DC instead—and, well).  But when Rumlow—Brock—had grinned at him and invited Steve back to his place, he’d agreed.  Agreed and tried not to think too much about Tony, even as he rubbed self-consciously at his mouth, red and bitten and wet, stinging with the marks Brock had left on him, feeling like everyone could see, would know what he’d been doing.
Tony grinned, then obeyed.  The sight of him sticking out his tongue also made blood rush south—it was all—all red and glistening—but Steve steeled himself as he took another big dollop of whipped cream with his finger and swiped it onto Tony’s tongue.
.  His hole prickled and stung sweetly, neglected now, but still worked open and relaxed, butter-soft from Tony’s sweet, insistent fingers and wet with lube.  He felt so wet, smeared and sticky.  The head of his cock throbbed with every breath, every beat of his heart, feeling hot and raw, aching and flushed, even though no one had so much as touched it, not him, not Tony.  His whole body was . . . warm, felt like it was glowing all over from the oil Tony had rubbed on him, inside him, keeping him tingling, making him feel warm from the inside out, radiating into him, flushing him hot, making the sore places, the melts and marks Tony had left him over his back and thighs, prickle and tingle and warm with the kind of hot, tickling sting that kept Steve aware of them, reveling in them, in the marks Tony had left.
“’Course,” Steve said.  “Hell, Tony, I’m sorry I left you hangin’.  Just let me—” —he stopped, because Tony’s hand was pressing gently against his chest, and looked up at him in surprise.
He thought he heard Tony mutter, under his breath, “Oh, sweetheart, that ship sailed a long time ago,” but that . . . couldn’t be right.  Maybe it’d been something like,
?  What was he thinking?  Brock was his subordinate, he couldn’t—couldn’t have a relationship with him.  Not a real one.  That was wrong.  That was—sure, SHIELD didn’t seem to have any rules against fraternization, and plenty of agents, well, they . . . fraternized.  But STRIKE was a front line military group.  It was like sleeping with Dum Dum would have been, it was—wasn't
it, wet and sensitized and trembling, every time Tony slapped Steve’s sore, hot buttocks and made him clench down instinctively.
“Like I want you to do something about it,” Tony told him, rubbed the back of his fingers against Steve’s jaw, took a deep breath.  “C’mon, come inside me.  Use me. I got all dolled up for you, so come on, soldier, use your pretty little doll.”
of pain that had Steve crying out, full-voiced, almost a whimper, and bucking up back against Tony, he couldn't help himself, and then Tony fucked into him again, and there was blood rushing back to his nipples, back to his painful, bruised, sore, aching tits, and then Tony’s hands came back, fingertips massaging into the sore flesh, rubbing into the flesh, sliding up toward his nipples like he was milking a goddamn cow, squeezing warm where his nipples were already on fire, tugging at them, and Tony’s cock pushed past his sweet spot and the pleasure surged through Steve, was everywhere inside him, over his skin, every raw, sensitized, desperately firing nerve-ending, and Steve came again without a single touch to his throbbing cock.
“Still feelin’ good for more?” Steve asked, stroking gently now, along both sides, down over his hips, back over Tony’s hot skin over his bottom, his thighs, rubbing his thumbs up and down the sensitive skin of his inner thighs, too, and smiling as that made Tony shiver and gasp, shuddering under him, slid his fingers up and played them softly over the underside of the curves of Tony’s bottom, stroking up and in and over the soft sensitive skin in between to press in toward his body gently, before he pulled them back, wandered them down his thighs again. Tony was shivering, gasping, moaning at almost every touch.  “I promise, I’ll still go easy.”
Steve moaned around him, and his lashes fluttered closed.  He sucked a little bit harder, his tongue swirling around the head of Tony’s cock with increased determination, and his hand sped up on his own cock.
.  “I,” he managed after a moment, vividly aware of how his chest was heaving, how it made his rounded pectorals, red and hot all over, jump under Tony’s hands like his tits were bouncing, “I, yeah?  What—whatever you want, Tony.”
He skimmed both hands down, ran them over the back of Tony’s neck, down over his shoulders again, laid the heel of his hand against his skin and massaged at the small of Tony’s back, the base of his spine.  Tony sighed, went limp under it, sagging against the pillow.
“C’mon, princess, don’t be a pussy, I didn’t tell you to stop,” Brock said, and so Steve kept working his finger in deeper, shutting his eyes against the dry burn, sucking grit off his lips and tongue, even as Brock started to beat him with his belt in earnest.  The pain built, grew bright and brighter, stinging and hot, throbbing all through his hand, up and down his wrist, across his rear cheeks.  When Brock finally told him he could stop, opened the belt, Steve dropped his hand, almost in shock at how badly it was throbbing, how little it wanted to hold him up.  He curled his fingers into the covers.
.  Steve had been really pleased—thrilled by Tony’s reaction, but pleased with the flogger itself, too, the way it threw, the way it fell on Tony’s skin, not too heavy, soft and perfect for the way Tony liked it done to him, exactly what he’d wanted.
Steve didn’t mind.  He didn’t need sleep as much as most people, but that was okay.  He could just lie here, in Brock’s bed.  That was nice.  Brock didn’t always want him around after he came.  Lying in bed was nice.  And he liked his softening cock inside him, even feeling his come slipping out around it, hot and wet and filthy—it was so hot—but just the holding it with his body, too.  Holding him inside.  That was good.  At least he was a good fucksleeve.  He was good at holding Brock’s cock inside him.  He could clench down, keep him in even when he was soft.
of Steve inside him.  He had to reach back, steady himself with one hand on Steve’s hip, writhing over him, and feeling that huge length just so hot and deep and throbbing inside him, like he could feel Steve’s heartbeat all through his own body because of it, because of that heat nestled so deeply in his body, immovable and impossibly, it felt like, large.
Tony pulled on the mirror to help himself raise his head, look back at Steve through looking into the reflective surface.  Steve’s mouth and chin still looked wet, his lips red and swollen and shiny, and Tony shivered with a self-conscious wave of heat, knowing that had come from—come from licking at
“I can get you on something serious until you fall back asleep, at least, if you want,” Tony said.  His face was very serious, grave, as he looked down at Steve, worry in the tightness around his eyes, his mouth somehow soft.
“Begging,” Brock had said.  “Just what I like to hear.”  And he had let Steve’s hair go, just to reach down, skimming his fingers along his face, letting his fingertips play over Steve’s lips, press into his wet mouth, between his bitten lips until he was drooling, panting around them, then dropped his hand to his neck and squeezed it, hard, hard enough that Steve found himself flexing the muscles in his neck against his hand despite himself, gasping for breath, before he pulled it away.  “All right, big guy,” he said.  “You’re not Cap anymore with me, do you understand?  You’re mine.  You’re my big needy cocksucker, all right?”
Stark was pulling his leg up to his shoulder now—wow, he really was flexible.  Steve didn’t want to interrupt him, but—
“I—” Tony started, swallowed.  Steve wanted to put his tongue on him.  He knew Steve didn’t mind it, but it still felt so—so intimate, so, well, filthy. He was clean; he’d cleaned up scrupulously for this, even before making sure he was shaved and trimmed and freshly waxed, but.  But still. It was his
.  Not like this.  Not now.  Not with him.  And—and when Brock called him those things—part of Steve burned with shame, even while his cock sat up and took notice, even as he gasped and arched his back and ground down onto Brock’s dick or his fingers, desperate for more, and he wasn’t sure—wasn’t sure which one was the real him.
“Good,” Tony breathed.  “Want you to feel good.  Want you to feel good sucking my cock.”  He found himself caressing the side of Steve’s face, rubbing his fingers into the hinge of Steve’s jaw, up over his cheek.  Steve shivered at the touch, gulped, turned his face toward Tony’s hand, pressing in against it without moving off his cock, his eyes just fluttering open slightly.  Tony let his hand slide over, let his thumb rub Steve’s lower lip, feeling it wet and swollen, stretched around his cock, and it was Steve’s turn to moan, to press his face closer into Tony’s hold, even as he lapped at Tony’s cock lightly with his tongue, dragged it over the tip of him.  Tony moaned at the wet, soft pleasure that tingled through him, lifted his hips into it, and Steve smiled, let him push further into his mouth, then bobbed his head, pulling back and then taking Tony in shallowly in again.  “Oh,” Tony gasped, rubbed at Steve’s bottom lip, pushing his thumb in against it convulsively.  “Oh, that’s good.  You’ve got it, darling, that’s it.”
“Sure,” Brock said, and bit at his bottom lip.  “You know how to make my eggs just right.  Now get in that shower.  You messy boy.”
Tony shivered, all the way down his body, over his shoulders, this time.  “Yes,” he husked out, low and rough.  His fingers curled in against his palms, and Steve reached up, slipped his hand under the fingers of one hand, squeezed.
Tony was back with a nurse a few minutes later, and he was as good as his word.  Steve was dropping off, when he suddenly felt a jolt of fear, of alarm, and forced his eyes open again.  “Tony?” he said, panicky despite himself.
“Sweetheart,” Tony said, low and thick, and pressed a soft kiss against Steve’s hair, against his temple, that sent warmth through him, a gentle glow that made Steve relax against him even more.  Tony’s fingers carded gently through Steve’s hair again.  “You’re taking it easy, all right?”
He tried to say something—something about how Tony could chew him out for being stupid for not seeing it coming, but not for being reckless, because he hadn’t been reckless at all, and he could show Tony reckless if Tony wanted, but he couldn’t hear the words coming out of his own mouth and that left him not sure if he had actually said them or not.
They lay like that for a long time, Steve’s big body shivering against him, his lips pressed against Tony’s thigh, saliva drooling out into a big wet smear against it as Tony pet his hair, rubbed behind his ears, at the back of his neck, into the hinges of his jaw, and Steve breathed unevenly.  His big hand was still clasped loosely around the base of his own cock.  Eventually, though, his breathing evened out, his abs quivered, worked, and then he was opening his eyes, pulling his hand away from his dick.  It was covered in his own come, and he made a face at it and wiped it off on the covers, then down his own side, before he looked up at Tony.  He was biting his lip, and his face looked uncertain, despite all of Tony’s praise.
“Stark!” Steve said, and then hugged him around the waist, rolled over, and leaned in to kiss him—but he hesitated, just at the last moment.  “Oh,” he said.  “My mouth’s—”
“Tell me how you cleaned up for me, Tony,” Steve murmured softly, now stroking his thumb along the underside of Tony’s caged cock, leaving sticky wetness there.
“His parents had just died in that wreck,” he murmured to Natasha.  “And everyone just jumped on him.”
, like that.  Steve still had that mischievous look on his face. Tony gave a questioning noise, shrugged his shoulders.  “Al-already in, inside me, champ,” he finally managed to get out breathily.
“God, you’re beautiful,” he murmured, and it was true.  Steve’s pleasure was one of the most beautiful things he’d ever seen, and he didn’t intend to miss a moment of it.  “So gorgeous, so beyond gorgeous, most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen, Steve, damn, you’re gorgeous.  You’re perfect.  You’re feeling so good, right?  I want you to feel so good, love seeing you like this, in your pleasure, you look so perfect for me, come so perfect for me.  Love watching you come, never get tired of it.”  He massaged Steve’s scalp through his orgasm, rubbed his hands through his hair, stroking gently, until Steve collapsed against the bed and let his cheek rest on Tony’s thigh, his cock slipping gracelessly, wetly, out of Steve’s mouth as Steve panted there on his thigh.  His eyes were still closed, and he sighed, his whole big body going loose, relaxing, as Tony kept petting his hair. “So good,” he told him.  “You were so good, so perfect, coming for me like that, bringing yourself off just like I said, touching your cock for me while you sucked my dick.  So good, Steve.  You did so well.  That was such a pretty orgasm, my dear; I hope it felt as good as it looked, because it looked spectacular.  Are you feeling good?  I hope you’re feeling good, want you to feel good.  You look like you’re feeling good.”  He kept that up, a steady stream of rambling, babbling praise, soft words and telling Steve perfect he was, how perfect he’d been, barely thinking about it, just sure that that was no more than Steve deserved.  It was always easy for Tony to talk in bed—being quiet would have been the challenge, really.
pressure.  He whined, moaned, twisted his head until he could pant into the bed under him, jerking his hips up despite himself.  He was aware his voice came out sounding breathy and needy and desperate, like—like sex.  “Hurts so perfect, Tony.”
“S-sure thing, honey,” Tony moaned between licks at the mirror.  It tasted like Steve, musky and salty sweet, strangely cool on his tongue. “’Course.”
Tony was kissing down his spine, groaning as he thrust into him, his cock still kissing over Steve’s sweet spot with every thrust, but a bit wilder now, harder, and that was what Tony felt like when he was feeling good, getting into it, and that made everything in Steve feel sweet and pleasurable as honey, slow and sticky, like lolling out on his back in the grass on a warm day and feeling the soft spring air on his face.  That was almost better than the heightening pleasure each thrust of Tony’s sent through him, or the pain in his chest, or the prickling sensitivity of his sore rear end every time Tony’s hips thrust up against it.  He felt himself whimpering, his cock leaking, just at that sign of Tony’s pleasure.  The head of it felt so sensitive, wet and achy, and he could feel himself dripping.  Oh, lord, he was so messy, he felt so good, he felt . . . he
But that was Tony for you, so Steve had just kissed him, warm and deep and lingering enough to make it last, to make Tony melt into his arms and press his body into his and for both of them to start to get hot, hot enough that Tony pushed him away with a laugh, caressed his face, and said, “Go on, get out of here before I forget all about having work to do.”  Steve had gone in for one more quick kiss, lingering wet over Tony’s lips and grinning all the while, raised his hands in surrender as Tony took a mock swing at his arm, then grabbed his face in both hands and kissed him one more time.  Tony had swatted his rear as he went and made Steve feel even warmer.
“You can always make me,” Steve murmured, catching Brock’s mouth with his again, biting down on his bottom lip, curling one hand in his belt loops and the other around his shoulders.
“Neither are you, big guy,” Tony said.  “Okay, up you get.  This is going to hurt like hell, stud; I’m sorry.”  At first Steve thought he meant he should stand up, and he was willing to give it a shot, even though he had his doubts that he could do it, but then Tony was pulling his gauntlets back on and lifting him, just like that, one gauntleted hand coming up to cradle Steve’s head against the shoulder of the armor, and Steve felt stupid that he thought Tony would have wanted him to stand like this, about a half-second before it hit him that it was all hurting exactly as badly as Tony had warned him.
Tony smiled a little more. “That was the idea,” he said.  He reached up, fingered one of his own nipples idly, sucking in his breath at the dual stimulation.  They really did look—pretty striking like this, sexy.
“Mmm,” Tony said, his hands flexing softly under Steve’s.  He curled his fingers up, rubbed them against the sides of Steve’s face, and Steve shivered, just a little.  He got wind-burned easily, and it was cold outside—the serum hadn’t yet healed it, though in a few hours it would be gone.  Tony rubbed at one cheek with a thumb, then, abruptly, wriggled out from under Steve’s chest, dug in his pockets or sweater or something under the blanket.  Steve blinked, surprised.  “Aha!” Tony said, a moment later, and pulled out a little tin of what looked like lotion.  “Now c’mere, lover,” Tony said, and turned quickly to sit sideways on the sofa, trapping Steve between both of his legs.
Tony savored each long, slow slide, the fullness of it, tight down his throat, hot and pulsing against the walls of muscle there, every time Steve slid out over his tongue, then Tony rocked his head forward again and slid him back down his throat.  It never took Steve all that long to come from being deep-throated, and so Tony just gripped his hands around Steve’s thighs and relished the overwhelming heat and weight and stretch of it, the way Steve filled up his mouth, over his tongue, his throat, forcing it to squeeze and spasm all around that thick length.  He just lost himself in it, let his hands slide up to rest them against Steve’s firm, clenching stomach muscles, forearms against his thighs, enjoying the way it felt like it rubbed his soft throat raw on the inside, but still felt it as it started to build for Steve, his cock pulsing down Tony’s throat, and pulled back just enough to rub Steve’s wet, lipstick smeared and sticky cock with his hand, so that Steve could come over his tongue.  He always came so much, in big, hot, wet, pulses over Tony’s tongue, and Tony swallowed and swallowed, sucking at the tip, just under the head, against Steve’s foreskin, riding out Steve’s orgasm, trying to prolong it as long as he could, rolling his hand up and down along the shaft, tugging gently as more and more come pulsed out over his tongue, swallowing as best as he could, though he could feel some of it bubbling up, leaking out and spattering over his lips, because Steve just came
“Your wish is my command, o Captain, my Captain,” he said, and kissed the back of Steve’s head, and Steve hid his suddenly bashful smile in the towel.
“So, so good,” Steve promised him, still petting his hair, and saw Tony’s lips quirk up into a tiny, pleased smile.  “That’s it,” Steve told him.  “Good boy. So good for me.  Taking that so perfect.  Sucking me off so damn nice.”  He reached down between Tony’s legs as he spoke, hitched one up and out to the side, exposing him just enough to give Steve a dramatic view of Tony’s still very hard cock, hard and red and wet and needy, then used his arm around Tony’s thigh, above his knee, and another around his waist, to hoist him up, drag him back into Steve’s arms, back to his front.
“Call back later?” Steve murmured, and kissed him.  Tony moaned, leaned up into the kiss, reached up until he could take hold of the back of Steve’s head and pull him down into it, soft and wet and lingering.  Steve kissed him gently, deeply, slipping his tongue into his mouth, cradling him against his body, stroking the side of his neck, holding him even as his cock was still hard deep inside him.
Steve knew his blush was furious this time.  That damned nickname.  Even more stupid, since he wasn’t the national champion anymore.  “You didn’t steal anything from me,” he said.  “You won it fair and square.”  It actually hadn’t been fair at all—Steve’s own program component scores had been massively overscored, and the judges had been ridiculously harsh on Stark’s.  If they hadn’t been, Steve would have been in second by a huge margin.  As it was, Stark had only beaten him by a point. So.  Stark’s win had been more than fair.  “Your free skate was incredible,” he added, knowing he was smiling admiringly but unable to help it.
“Oh,” Tony heard himself moan.  “Oh, oh, Steve, Steve, honey, you’re gorgeous, that’s gorgeous, you’re so good.”
Steve smiled and ducked his head down, kissed Tony’s thigh.  “All right, fella,” he said.  “If you say so.  You gotta tell me how to improve though, okay?  I want you to.”
Tony smiled, a different smile, though still oblique, a little hard to pin down.  But this one was softer, seemed more real, even as crooked as it was.  “Maybe not,” he said.  “I mean, it’s possible.  I’m not ruling it out.  But I have this feeling that you’d stand out anyway.”
It wasn’t a total surprise, but the pleasure of it still struck Tony like a blow, had him arching up off the bed helplessly, clutching at Steve’s hair with one hand and covering his mouth with the other.  Steve moaned, as if in pleasure, as if to spur him on, and moved with that thrust, keeping his mouth on Tony’s cock even as he moved back, then sinking himself back down over it again.  He didn’t go so deep that it hit the back of his throat, but he still covered a good percentage of Tony with that hot, deep sucking pressure, and Tony heard himself whine high-pitched and pathetic as Steve drew back, his lips dragging over his length, providing tight suction around him all the while.
He got to blow Steve in the shower, and by the time they were falling into bed, Tony still in the cage, he felt so—so relaxed, so easy, so warm and soft and good.  He rolled over, pressed the cage against Steve’s thigh through his soft pajamas, his boxers, pushed his face into Steve’s chest, nosing against the key on its chain around Steve’s neck, against his dogtags, though his shirt, and sighed.  “Good night, sweetheart,” he mumbled.  “Thank you.”
Tony’s head snapped up immediately, so he must have heard Steve sigh, then he started violently enough to knock his tablet to the floor.
“I’ve got some water for you,” he said.  “And a few snacks.  I thought I’d hand feed you.  How does that sound?”
Tony smiled up at him.  “Nicest thing anyone’s done for me in ages, sport,” he said, and he meant it.  “Except for you taking me out to dinner, of course.”
Brock tripped him, and Steve thought of at least five ways to catch himself, even through the agony—Brock’s shoulder, his belt, his shirt, he could bring him down under him—and let himself go down hard on his knees, let himself be pushed into the floor.  He let Brock straddle him and drag off his jacket, rocking his own hard-on into Steve’s rear, along the seat of his pants, against his crack, pushing his cheeks apart with that hot, heavy bulge, even as he undid the buttons of his shirt one by one, rubbing Steve’s cheek roughly against his wooden floor as he pulled it up from Steve’s slacks in rough fistfuls.
Tony gave a desperate, aching groan, though, and so Steve opened his eyes again, saw Tony looking at him pleadingly, licking his lips eagerly.  Steve helped him work himself down, until Tony could brace himself with both arms and lower his mouth over the tip of Steve’s cock.
Steve groaned, felt it gurgle in his throat at the angle Tony was holding his head, as Tony flexed his foot again, pressed down a little harder, and pain and pleasure swept through Steve’s body all over again, turning him hot with it, hot from the inside out, red hot.  “Yes, sir,” he breathed, and he could hear the way Tony sucked in his breath, felt the way Tony’s fingers tightened in his hair, against his neck and jaw.  He thought about Tony’s expensive shoes, glanced down to see that expensive black leather shoe smeared with his own fluid, the sole pressed down against the messy hot flushed length of his cock, obscene and huge and purple-red where blood was surging against the thin tissues, messy and wet against the floor, and another desperate whimpering noise tore out of him, his hands clenching helplessly as his stomach pulled tied with desire, with need, just at the sight of it, at his hot, leaking mess contrasted to Tony’s cool elegance.  He felt hot and big, overlarge and ungainly and helpless and messy while Tony was all cool competence and control, standing over him.  He felt helpless, entirely in Tony’s hands.  He knew he was drooling now and couldn’t seem to help it.  His mouth felt very wet.
They finished off that cookie fairly quickly, and moved on to some of the sugar cookies, some iced, some sugared.  These were in the shape of the mansion itself, unicorns, pegasi, dragons, reindeer, and Christmas trees.  There were also spiced cookies and peppermint candy cane twisted cookies that Tony seemed to enjoy feeding Steve piece by piece.  Eventually, by the time they’d finished off the plate—which didn’t take as long as it probably should have—and drained their cocoa (and a second cup each), Steve was feeling warm and loose and a little drowsy, not like he was really tired, but more like he was so relaxed he couldn’t bring himself to be all the way alert.  He slid Tony to his feet and rinsed out their cups in the sink, continuing their conversation about what they’d done that night—the details of Steve’s mission, Tony filling him in on the way he’d set the mansion’s security functions, the extra updates he’d given it since most of the Avengers would be distracted or off duty, though luckily not all, the presents he’d finished wrapping and setting up for everyone.
. Steve ended wobbling on his feet, pressed awkwardly into Tony from shoulders to thighs, his weight mostly on the armor, collapsed half into Tony’s chest.  Tony’s hand came down, curved under his rear end, and Steve felt a strange sense of—not quite embarrassment, more like a frisson of awareness, of how much he’d wanted Tony to hold him like this—before, and also a strange, stupid sense of safety.  “Whoopsie daisy, champ, gonna want to put your arms around my neck,” Tony said, and his breath was on Steve’s face, and, stupidly, suddenly, there were foolish tears burning in his eyes.  He shut them, quickly, let his head rest on the shoulder of the armor, and brought his arms up around Tony’s shoulders, just as Tony had instructed.  His chest hurt.
“That sounds so good,” Steve murmured, sliding his hands back down over Tony’s sides, “but maybe later, all right?  I want to work you open first, use your tight little hole.”  His fingers petted down over the small of Tony’s back, slid down to rub there, massaging lightly, in slow circles, over Tony’s rim, not pushing in, just rubbing back and forth, and Tony moaned, felt his mouth open, wet, felt his eyes flutter, and then Steve’s other hand was coming up, curving against Tony’s jaw, stroking gently, pushing gently at Tony’s lower lip with his thumb, then pushing inside.  Tony closed his mouth, sucking softly on it, and Steve sighed, his lashes fluttering now. “I might have your mouth after,” he murmured, and Tony moaned, sucking, nodded his head, encouraging, “but right now I want to watch you, all right?”
“Yes,” Tony said, and it came out raw and honest.  He rubbed himself with both hands through his panties, settling them along the weight of it, against his shaft, squeezed and rubbed, rocking up into it, reveling in the feeling of the smooth steel around his cock, the tight constraint, the way he could feel his own hands, the silk, but almost distantly, referred, just the feeling as his cock wanted to get hard, started to struggle, aching sweetly. He kind of loved the feeling of the smooth heavy metal, against his sensitive skin.  “It feels really good,” he said.  “I’ve been, I’ve been thinking about this all day, hon. Just having it on me, I—I.”  He swallowed, hefted it in his hands, lifting it against both his palms, presenting the heft of it, the jut against the silk, in his silken panties.
Tony’s fingers petted through his hair.  “You could come just from this,” he murmured softly, nudging gently at the base of Steve’s cock with his foot, and Steve nodded, moaning into his waistcoat, even as Tony moved his foot off his cock, slid it under Steve’s length to nudge gently at his balls, bouncing them and Steve’s cock slightly on the toe, then pushed it back farther, nudged at Steve’s hole, teasing, pushing enough that he gasped, whimpered, feeling very wet, very tender, as Tony rubbed the leather along his lube-wet crease, tapped the toe of his shoe against his sensitive opening.  Steve heard himself gasping, felt his chest heaving.
And he did, that was the thing.  He really did have him.  He looked out for Steve, watched over him.  He gave him a home, he gave him a place to feel soft and weak and himself, he—he did so much for Steve, and Steve was so difficult, and he was so grateful. All the time, he was so grateful. Tony was so good to him, and he never even had to ask.
Tony took a deep breath, had to blow it out.  He felt dizzy, warm all over, lightheaded, just looking up into Steve’s face—Steve Rogers, braced over him, staring down at him with determination, asking Tony to direct him how to suck his cock properly.  He could never have imagined this, not in a million years.  It felt wilder than his wildest fantasies ever had.
“Love having your tits clamped up, your little nipples all hard, look at you, squeezed all tight from it,” Tony murmured, and Steve panted, squeezed his eyes shut, because it was so—Tony’s words alone were making him tremble and shake, making his cock jerk, making him hot for it all over.  “How’s that feel?” Tony purred.  He tugged on one clamp and Steve bit his lip against a cry, managed to swallow it into a loud moan.  “Hurts?”
Steve felt himself going even hotter and thus probably redder, a little raw where he was still wind-burned even under the lotion, but he let Tony push him over to lie on the sofa, piling pillows underneath his head, then arranging himself over Steve’s body, between his legs.  He tugged the blanket over them both, bracing his elbows in the pillows, and went back to stroking Steve’s hair, massaging his scalp.  Steve sighed, felt his whole body sort of—uncoil, go loose, now that Tony’s weight and warmth were pressing down on him, body against his, the smell of him—clean skin as if Tony had showered not long ago, too, Tony’s aftershave, the one that smelled like fir trees and sandalwood and frankincense, a surprisingly good combination with the smell of the lotion—in his nose, both of them cuddled up together.  Pleasure was still spreading through him, slow and warm, from Tony’s hands against his scalp, in his hair, and Steve sighed.  “On my back, huh?” he murmured, hearing own voice gone all scratchy and low, smiling up at Tony.
Steve nodded his head, jerkily, eyes still fixed on Tony and hot, hazy with desire, his pupils dilated and lashes heavy enough to make them look darker than their normal light blue.  Tony found his attention fixed on the golden tips of Steve’s dark blond eyelashes, where they’d picked up the sun and gone red then bright as gilt.
“I like the sound of that,” Tony said, looking down at him with the softest smile.  He leaned in, brushed a kiss over the lotiony tip of Steve’s nose.  “All mine, huh?”
Tony hugged Steve tighter to his own body.  “It’s a new one on me, too, big fella,” he murmured, and kissed the hot curve of Steve’s ear.  “You’re a new one on me.”
It didn’t seem to be—Steve was moving with him, rocking his head back and forth over Tony’s cock like he’d been doing this for years.  Tony had known he’d pick it up quickly, he thought again, the quick thought feeling like all he could spare, his mind scattered, jumbled, by pleasure.  “So good, darling,” Tony heard himself groan.  “So good for me.  That feels so good.  You’re doing so beautifully.  It’s so perfect.”
, like he couldn’t even believe how beautiful Tony was.  Because it made him feel soft and desirable and, and pretty and fragile and sexy and powerful at the same time.
He moved to straddle Steve, and Steve’s warmth immediately bled into him as Tony spread his thighs out wide, feeling the stretch in his hips as he settled down over Steve’s strong, muscular thighs, his legs.  Steve looked at him, licking his bottom lip, already looking breathless as he ran his hands up and over Tony’s thighs, rubbing gently, massaging against the muscle. “How’s that feeling?” he murmured, rubbing his thumbs deeply into Tony’s muscles, kneading gently but firmly. “You like that, being locked up for me?”
They lay there for a long time, Steve still inside him, Steve’s warm hands sliding over Tony’s back, his shoulders, rubbing at his ass, caressing and squeezing, rubbing at the back of his neck, and Tony just felt like warm, relaxed melted putty, epoxy that hadn’t set, the liquid polymers he’d been working on lately, until finally Steve coaxed him up off his cock, practically carried him into the bathroom, and they cleaned up, Steve’s hands so gentle as they unfastened the cock cage, cleaned Tony up, caressing him gently, before he locked it back on and Tony let out a satisfied sigh, playing idly with the little lock.
, he thought, but didn’t seem to be able to follow it up with anything, not when he was still panting for breath and couldn’t seem to get any air.  In those first few moments, he didn’t have the first clue what had happened to him, and part of him wondered if he was waking up into an asthma attack.  It was so hard to get a breath, and for a moment he was back in his narrow bed in the tenement where he’d lived, cold wind whistling through the walls as he shook with cold sweat and tried to get a good breath, straining his chest so hard there was nothing but pain in his seized-up lungs.
He heard Tony suck in a breath, harsh and unsteady.  “Hey, c’mon, God, what’s wrong, what’s wrong with you,” Tony said, “can you give me any sign here, shit, Stark, he’s out, of course he can’t, don’t be stupider than you need to be, Jesus—” his fingers slid down to Steve’s throat, curling around his neck, leaving his face, and Steve felt his head loll a little, bobbing unsteadily at the loss of that support.  Tony was taking his pulse, he registered dully.
And then Brock had laughed, had called him easy for it, eager, an easy slut just waiting to be mounted, and he’d spread Steve’s hole out on his fingers and drizzled, poured lube over it until Steve was shivering, then he hadn’t felt cold at all, as Brock’s thick, heavy, hot cock was pushing into him.  He jerked at Steve’s shirt, bound it up in his hand, and laughed as he said, “Sure hope you don’t mind a little barebacking, little filly, ‘cause I sure ain’t finding a condom now,” and smacked Steve’s rear so it stung, and his cock was so hot and heavy it left Steve gasping.  It had to be as thick around as a soda can, and Steve felt like he was so—so full, of heat, the stretch—oh, the stretch, it was so
Steve just squeezed the back of his neck, tugged on, stroked his hair, pulled on it gently, twining it around his fingers, rubbed over his shoulders, kissing his cheeks.  “Shh,” he said, “shh, sweetheart, you’re all right. Just breathe deep, deep breaths, okay? That’s it.  You’re good, you’re fine.  Just settle into it.  The way the cage is holding your cock, keeping it all nice and tight, that’s it. Just let it happen.”
Still, Tony let himself work both of them up slowly this time, let his eyes slide mostly closed as he closed his fingers around Steve’s cock, ran a hand down to stroke and roll at his balls, letting Steve’s hot, thick cockhead and sweet musky taste slide back and forth over his tongue, dragging his mouth open wide, even as he hollowed his cheeks and sucked on him, played gently with his tongue along the ridges, the underside, over the head, flicked it gently against the slit.  It always felt so good once he got into the rhythm of it, and Tony found himself squeezing his legs together, soft silky stockings rubbing together at his thighs, the feeling shivering and bright, as if that would give him any stimulation on his tightly captured cock as it throbbed beneath his panties and the garter belt, pushed down tight against his skin even as it hardened and plumped up and he could feel it leak a bit of precome, wet and messy against his skin, as Steve’s hot musky length filled up his mouth.  He could feel the steady pounding of Steve’s heart in his hot, hard length over his tongue, and Tony’s mouth felt wet and sticky and strange with the lipstick, made him all the more aware of it.  He could taste the lipstick on Steve’s cock, on his own tongue.  He was determined to smear it all the way down to Steve’s base, to leave a ring of it there.
“Good,” he said.  He slid his hand down Tony’s thigh again, down around his knee than up around the inside, until Tony was shivering with the warmth of it, of the touch, the way it felt, the pure pleasure of being touched like that, and then he slid it up Tony’s inner thigh, pushed his leg out wide, and Tony let him, sighed and relaxed into it.  He’d let Steve manhandle him however he damn well wanted to, any day of the week.  Steve’s big, broad, blunt, square fingers smoothed along his inner thigh, up along the sensitive skin at the crease of his groin, and Tony shivered again, panting, bit his bottom lip, sucked on it.  The hot sensation went all the way through him, a thrilling tease, warm and prickling where Steve’s calluses skimmed over his skin.  Steve’s hand moved over to squeeze and massage at his balls, then he was running his wide warm palm against them, stroking and tugging gently, and Tony heard his own loud gasp in his ears, felt sweat spring up under his arms, heard himself panting.  It felt so, so good, a low warm pleasure building and building, in his gut, his balls, his still-wet cock.
“Good, good,” Tony managed to get out, swallowing hard just so the words came out clearly without spilling saliva all over his beard and the sides of his chin.  Steve always came quickly, and it was pretty apparent—from the flush of his face, from the leaky mess his cock was making on the coverlet, all over his fingers, from so many other things—that this was turning him on even more, so Tony didn’t expect him to last much longer.  “Are you gonna come?  Come while you’re sucking me off?  Rub yourself off with your mouth still on my cock?  You want to?  You want to come with my cock in your mouth, knowing how well you’re sucking me off?”
“I won’t,” Steve assured him.  He blinked, because his eyes were watering in the bright sun, and squinted up at him.  He still couldn’t hear his own words.  His lips felt very dry, when he ran his tongue over the bottom one.  It was cracked, bleeding.  “I’ll be good.”  He still wasn’t sure if he’d said that, either, but Tony’s face did something strange at that, so he figured he must have.
He hadn’t been thinking about suicide bombing, because why would A.I.M. want to waste the results of their experiment?  He hadn’t been considering that they’d considered it a
“Doing good?” Steve murmured, and Tony nodded, his head spinning, his body throbbing, aching for something, needy and hot.  He ground his hips down against Steve’s fingers, looked up at him questioningly. “You want me inside?” Steve murmured. His fingers petted at Tony’s cheek gently, slid over the back of his neck, petting through his hair, and squeezed. “You ready for that, mister?”
Steve pulled off, smiled up at him, eyes hazy, and just the sight of that, his face red, mouth messy and wet and swollen, his eyelashes low and heavy over his eyes, had Tony’s cock throbbing.  “Yeah?” he said, and God, his voice was already low, but that was nothing but a hoarse rasp, as if he too felt overcome, and it went straight to Tony’s belly and twisted up with heat, throbbed in his dick.  “Good,” Steve said, then, and then pushed Tony’s cock up with his hand, pressed a kiss against the inside of one thigh, then the other, against his balls.  Tony heard himself gave a high-pitched whimper and covered his mouth with one hand, pressed his open mouth against the back of it.  Steve smiled at that, and then dragged his tongue up along the underside, a long, dragging, perfect wash of heat, closed his mouth over the tip and sucked, bobbing his head up and down—not enough to hit the back of his throat, but enough to give Tony the feeling of fucking and oh, oh,
“Mmm,” Steve agreed. He forced himself to start moving again, twisting out of Natasha’s arm so that he could go back to jogging.
isn’t in question, stud.”  He kissed Steve’s shoulder again, smoothed his hair back, and Steve sighed, thought about how he felt seeing Tony’s thighs covered in bruises, even when Tony would rock his fingers into them and sigh, eyes going heavy-lidded like that was the hottest thing ever invented, the twinge of guilt he always felt deep in his stomach, and he let Tony push his thumb in against his hole, fuck him in and out a few times with it, rough and heavy against his tender, pouty rim, and was content with that, even as only that much had him gasping and squirming with heady, almost too much sensation.
“Mmm,” Steve said.  He was laving his tongue up and down the underside of Tony’s cock again, and it was so hot and so perfect that Tony found his eyes closing, his head tipping back, moaning helplessly.  “You always swallow for me.”
, he had been close just then, just from Tony squeezing his sore, marked backside, the way Tony’s warm, firm, strong hands felt over the tingling marks, the sensitive, swollen skin, the heat the oil had left radiant in his muscles and under his skin, shimmering along the top of it.  “That’s it,” Tony purred into his ear, “
Steve just nodded, sucking harder then pulling back a bit, licking at his cock and panting as he slid a hand down, wrapped it around his own huge, hard, dripping cock again, hard palm and big square callused fingers big enough to look proportionate as he tugged at himself, slid it down to wrap around the base, even as he went back to sucking hard at Tony’s cock, taking it into his mouth far enough that he must have been filling him up pretty well, even if he wasn’t knocking at the door at the back of his throat, exactly.  He groaned, a harsh sound that send a hot rush of air down along Tony’s cock.
.  He brought his shield up and ran for the other man, hoping he could stop him, do something—and then the wave of heat and force of an explosion hit him like a wave in the ocean, sucking him under the water with it.  Steve thought,
And since Steve hadn’t ever been into that sort of thing either, he’d just grinned and said, “Guess that’s one we don’t need to check off our list, huh?” and volunteered a sort of embarrassing story about being punished during his own school days (for refusing to recite an essay he found insulting and just flat wrong-headed in front of the class) as an illustration of how little he wanted to relive them, and they’d just moved on.  But when they’d moved into impact play, Steve had realized that if you left the roleplay off, Tony kind of loved spanking, the hard smack of Steve’s hand against his rear, the warm glow of it, the pain, even liked him to go what Steve thought was pretty hard, moaned and rocked his bottom back into it and begged for more even when Steve knew it hurt and he was panting, head hanging down and his body flinching and flushed even as he pushed his rear back and begged with his whole body to be smacked.  Tony was no masochist; Steve knew that, not like he was himself, but there was something he liked about it, liked a lot.
, Tony.”  He rubbed gently the rim with two fingers now, massaging the tight muscle.  Tony was still just a little open, a little relaxed, from his clean up, and he felt shivery and hot as Steve rubbed wet, slick lube all around and over his sensitive skin, making him feel all the more aware of that part of his body, even as his cock throbbed dully.  Steve tugged at him with his thumb, rubbed it gently over him, relaxing the muscle as he rubbed at it again and again, and then pushed his finger against the tight rim insistent but gentle until it slipped inside.
, and he’d still been wearing his fingerless gloves, and it had hurt so perfectly, the way he palmed the back of Steve’s neck when he did it—brought him back down, deeper into the kiss—
“Good,” Steve said again, not quite able to track enough to think of another answer.  “G-green.  Green, Tony.”
Steve took a deep breath, felt a moment of indecision, but then remembered how seriously Tony took being able to make Steve come, being able to give him pleasure, and directly, with his hands or mouth or thighs or deep inside his body, how much it could upset him, especially when he was down, if Steve didn’t let him.
Tony took a breath, made himself take his hand away from his mouth—he’d been drooling on it, Jesus—and slide it into Steve’s hair, combing it back for his face, tugging on it.  He always loved it when his partner pulled his hair when he went down on them.  Another thing losing his hair had made harder, because having it come out in their hands wasn’t exactly a turn-on.  These days, at least, he was healthy enough that it wasn’t coming out quite so easily.  But he loved it, and from Steve’s earlier reactions he thought he might love it, too, so he tugged gently at Steve’s hair, carded his hand through it, stroked through the short spiky strands, caressed the shape of his skull, and Steve shivered all over.  Tony watched his toes curling even through his own hazy, dizzy pleasure, and found himself smiling.  That was good.  “Are you going to bring me off, big guy?” he whispered, almost a moan, as he kept lifting his hips into Steve’s mouth.  “Are you going to get me off?  Gonna get me to come in your mouth?”
After that, he had the rhythm of it, and it was easy to rock forward, take Steve even deeper with each bob forward and down of his head, playing gently with Steve’s balls in between with one hand, tugging them up toward him with every pass.  Steve kept gasping, shivering, gave low wet grunts and needy, gasping,
Steve managed to raise a hand, wobbled it back and forth.  He had a feeling he was smiling in an unforgivably dopey way.  “S’okay for now,” he said.  “Under control, Iron Man.”  He reached out, patted the shining metal arm of the armor clumsily.  “Good to see you,” he managed to say, and had to blink.  His eyes felt very, very heavy.  He was so tired.  But it was, it was
Brock’s belt snapped across his rump, across his hand, a moment later, and the pain of it bloomed in Steve’s palm, up his wrist, over his rear.  He heard himself gasp.
, and it made Steve almost eager for the next round, the next time Brock slapped his ass or his thighs and called him a—a cunt, because it felt like he deserved it for thinking about Tony like that, without his consent, when he’d never want it.  God, if Tony could see him like this, he’d probably be
“Hilarious,” he said.  He had something in his hand now, a cloth of some sort, and was pressing it against Steve’s head.  It
Steve picked up the elk flogger, tossed it back to get a feel for the weight of the tails, then picked it up, let it fall heavily onto Tony’s shoulders and linger there, let him breathe in the scent, shudder under the heavier thud, watching him for how he reacted, the tremors in his muscles, the gasp that caught in his chest, but it seemed good, everything seemed good, not too hard, so Steve dragged it down, let Tony get used to the heavy, chocolate-pudding slide of it, the velvet richness of the leather, then threw it again.  This had more thud, but it was still soft, caressed the skin, the leather soft and rich and squishy.  Steve let Tony feel it, really feel it, luxuriate in it, then threw it just a little harder, enough to feel as well as hear his breath catching under him, then moved down to his rear, to let Tony feel that rich deep thud there, too, against his thighs.
“I should time you,” Tony said, still smiling, and kissed his cheek, still stroking along his chest, playing idly with the come still spattering it, swiping it up on his fingers.  “Here, sweetheart, I’m gonna fuck you.”
, throbbing and prickling, desperate for some kind of attention, pressure, or friction, or anything, but Tony hadn’t been touching him at all, had used Steve’s sensitivity—in his nipples, in his rear—to get him off three times already.  His cock felt wet and sticky and aching, and it
“I like it when you sound like that,” Steve murmured, lips against the soft skin of Tony’s cock, and Tony shuddered, felt himself trembling in his thighs, down to his toes.  “When you let me hear you.”
“I remember,” Tony said, and ran a hand back through his hair. “You do look a bit …” he smirked, again, and raised one eyebrow “. . . taller.”
Steve groaned, his mouth falling open wetly around Tony’s length.  He was doing as Tony had told him, pulling at his cock, stroking himself rough and quick, tugging roughly up over the head, panting against Tony’s cock.  Tony’s fingers twitched in Steve’s soft hair, itching to pull him in close and curl his own hand against that hot cock—he could almost imagine the remembered searing heat of it, the wet slide, the weight and incredible thickness of it in his hand, the soft, impossibly tender, thin skin of Steve under his hand over that steely hardness and the pulse of blood, even the taste and smell of him, sex sweat and musk and the sweet clean scent of plain Ivory soap, the way the taste of it clung to his skin.  Steve was panting now, mouth gone wet and sloppy around Tony even as he sucked determinedly at his cock, and rolling his hips up into his hand, groaning a little low in his throat.  He was definitely close, then—Tony recognized the noises he made.
“And you’ll stay here?” Steve asked, feeling selfish. Tony had so much to do, and he was keeping him here, tied to his bedside.  “Are you sure?  You don’t have work to do?”
Steve didn’t trust himself to speak.  He was sweating.  He just nodded, looking up at Tony and hoping that he could see how much he wanted it.
Steve felt himself getting closer and closer—he was sure he’d come before Tony did, he almost always did—but it wasn’t quite enough to tip him over the edge.  Everything felt hot and soft, all through him, his head was a soft, hazy place, and everything felt right and good, every burst of sensation, every swing of the clamps or trickle of sweat, sending him higher, firing in his brain like pleasure, even as his cock ached and throbbed and he gasped with need with every thrust of Tony inside him, every rock of his hips back onto Tony’s cock.  He stayed there what felt like a long time, teetering on the edge, the plateau, and he just couldn’t seem to get there, couldn’t seem to reach the peak—even though Tony was praising him, constantly, and every word of it sent pleasure arcing through Steve’s body like an electric shock, made him feel warm and good and honey sweet and hazy from the inside out; “Good boy,” he said, “God, Steve, so good, you take it so well, so, so well, yeah, that’s it, that’s it, honey, are you feeling it?  Is that good?”
, stretching Tony out wide, and then Steve tugged at him, adjusted him slightly as he drew back a bit and slid into Tony again, and then Steve’s cock was sliding directly over his prostate, and Tony gasped, cried out, choking on his own breath, writhed, whimpering helplessly, unable to help it. “I’ve gotcha,” Steve murmured again, “so beautiful, Tony, that’s it, that’s so good.”
Tony looked at him, scowled a little, looked at him again through his eyelashes, then shook his head, smiling unwillingly.  “Are you fishing for compliments, pretty boy?” he asked softly.  “Yeah, you got me.  You know I think you’re the most beautiful thing in the whole damn world.”
But maybe he could … introduce himself to Stark?  He was sure the other skater wouldn’t remember him; it had been years, and—well, Stark had been through a lot in the intervening time.  But everyone else was visibly giving him such a cold shoulder, and it didn’t seem right to just leave him there with everyone pointedly ignoring him. Steve was the one Stark had beaten out at Nationals and pushed into fourth at Worlds.  If he said hello, maybe it would ease that freeze in the air a bit, somehow.
The first hit made Tony cry out, stiffen and raise his head, then slump down again the blankets and the pillow at the second.  He was panting, his head down so his hair was falling forward into his eyes, muscles tightening and his strong arms working as he cried out.  Steve started slow, deliberate, first one side, then the other, over Tony’s lush backside, then down over his thighs, then up over his backside again.  Tony panted, whimpered, breath going harsh in his throat until it sounded almost like sobs, but he didn’t move, didn’t even try to press his legs together, just lay there for it, sometimes even still rocking his rear back into it, even as his breath hitched and sobbed on every indrawn gulp of it.  His rear got rapidly, deeply red, dark and rosy; his thighs took a little longer, and Tony’s fingers scrabbled and twisted at the blankets and his chest heaved and his breath sobbed in his throat, and finally he went limp and relaxed and moaned with every hard swat at his thighs, at his rear.
“Good,” Tony murmured.  “That’s good.”  He leaned in then, blew out a breath, and it feathered over Steve’s sore, clamped nipple, and he gasped, jerked on a helpless moan at the soft sensation of Tony’s warm, feathery breath.  Tony took another breath, blew it out again, then moved to the other, gave it two puffs of air, too, and Steve was squirming, felt his eyes go wet where they were shut tight, behind his eyelids, because it was just . . . so much.  He couldn’t help the noise he made when Tony closed his mouth—wet, hot, soft and sucking around the cold hard steel, the unforgiving bite and the pain of the pressure biting into his muscle—around his nipple and
what I wanted you to do and gave me a stupendous show.  I’d be happy to watch that any time at all.”
Steve tugged gently at Tony’s sagging stockings, pulled them up then let them slip down again, rubbed at Tony’s hips, played with his panties, tugging on them, feeling at them, before he grinned at him in the mirror, sat back a little, and ran his hand over Tony’s side, then the other over the other.  “You look so beautiful,” he murmured, and Tony ducked his head down.
Steve leaned in and licked it off.  “You’ve got the most adorable, handsomest nose, too,” he added.  “I forgot to mention that.”
, he’d imagined being at the mercy of the pirates and his belly had gone tight with want.  But this—he hadn’t thought anyone would be, would be
“Mmm,” Steve said, and pressed his hot cheek close against Tony’s shoulder, against his warmth.  “Real, real good.”
“Would that be all right?” Steve asked, with an almost touching earnestness, stilling his fingers inside him for a moment, like he actually thought Tony might say no.
of it, spreading him out wide, pushing against that sensitive, intimate place, but then he was opening wide, giving way, and he felt Steve slip into him with that sudden sense of give, of slight vertigo, it always gave him, as Steve’s thick warm heat spread him open and pushed inside.
against his rim, and oh, God, it was his beer bottle, the base, the bigger side, and oh, God, he was going to fuck him with a
“Good boy,” Tony said again, and then his hand was under Steve’s back, against his spine, stroking down the small of it, and he was pushing up, and Steve realized what he wanted and worked his muscles and pushed with him until he could get himself up and sway forward, and then almost shouted as he came up and was sitting on his sore, marked, sensitized buttocks, hot and tender against the bed, and the weights were swinging down, tugging on his nipples, his tits, until he was gritting his teeth and groaning.  His head swung forward, down, and then Tony’s hand was there, bracing it, petting his hair back, and Steve moaned and turned his face in toward Tony’s hand, rubbing his cheek against the comforting firm, hard calluses, the way Tony cradled his cheek and jaw, stroked his wet, parted, open lips with his thumb, let Steve flick his tongue along the nail and suck wetly at the pad of it as he groaned through the weight at his nipples.  Tony’s other hand came around and rubbed at, cupped, the back of Steve’s neck, stroking gently through the wet hair sticking there at the back of Steve’s neck even as he panted and groaned against Tony’s other thumb with every breath.  The weights pulled on the clamps, pulling them down until every breath brought a painful, tingling ache as they swung and pulled on his nipples.  His nipples felt very raw and hot, a prickling heat tingling against the air.
“Up and at ‘em, Sleeping Beauty,” Brock said, and laughed.  His cock was out, but his pants were on, and his undershirt, a dramatic contrast to Steve’s nudity.  “You look like something, that’s for sure, princess.”
He let it bump there one, two, three times, then was confident in his ability to open his throat, take it deeper, and shoved himself down further over Steve.  Steve gasped, trembled under him, jerked, but not hard, not shoving himself up into Tony’s mouth, a low, gasping groan escaping him as his hand tightened in Tony’s hair, and Tony let out a gurgling sigh at the pleasure of it.  He kept Steve’s thick heat down his throat as long as he could before his eyes would start to water, then slid off again, sucking and licking and making love to the head, really, with his whole mouth, lips and tongue and everything, as it lay in his mouth.
Steve shook his head, still watching Tony—Stark.  He had turned to the TV cameraman and was now arguing with the reporters in short, quiet tones.  Before too long one of them threw up their hands, and the whole lot of them left, TV camera and all.  Stark replaced his earbuds and started to stretch out over his legs.
“S-sorry,” he blurted.  That was it, what had been circling around his mind for months, that—“I’m so sorry, Tony.”
“Mmm, you like that, huh,” Tony murmured against the back of his neck, lips soft and mouth dragging soft and wet along Steve’s nape.  “You like me deep inside you.”
“It is, though,” Steve said, and reached down between Tony’s legs, hefted it gently in his hand. “Soft like this, too, sweetheart. It’s one of the prettiest cocks I’ve ever seen, and I love how it looks on you.”  He squeezed it, gently, and Tony trembled under him.  Steve kissed his shoulder, ran his fingers back, stroked his hole a little, softly, with his fingers.  “This is pretty, too,” he murmured, as Tony trembled as the oversensitized skin, the tender muscle, was massaged by the tips of his fingers, “so smooth and soft right now, and it’s easy for me to do,” he crooked his fingers gently inside, pumped them in and out until Tony was gasping, “this,” he said, “so sweet and open.  Just for me, huh?  You only open up just for me like this, so sweet and open and soft and relaxed.”
“Yes,” Tony said, and let the heaviness of his sincerity, the aching weight of it, show in the word, despite the way that terrified him, made him shake with the awareness of everything he might have revealed.  “I do.  Come here,
“So sloppy,” Brock’s voice came, replete with satisfaction, and Steve buried his face against his arm and gasped.  “So damn wet for me.”  Fingers tracing along his sore rear, along his crack, over his sticky hole, nudging inside and pulling until Steve gave a heaving breath that made his chest burn like he’d run a whole marathon in just the amount of time Brock had spent fucking him.  “Mmm, I bet you want more,” Brock said.  “Bet you want that slutty hole filled.  Bet you wanna come.”
Tony did it again on the other side, and Steve almost sobbed as Tony twisted and tugged his nipple, then the clamp bit in tight, unforgiving steel balls biting, pushing deep.  There was a chain linking them, draping across Steve’s heaving chest like a, a kind of jewelry, silvery cool against his skin at the same time the chill almost felt like heat against his hot, oversensitized pecs.  Tony tangled his fingers in it and tugged, gently, and pleasure shot through Steve, pleasure or pain or both, hot and fiery, and when he came back to himself he realized he’d bent inward, curled his knees up, and was panting.  His shoulders prickled and stung against the bed, his buttocks felt raw and sore.
“God, it was years ago,” Tony said.  “For it to be a walk in the park, I’m sure.  I was an insufferably arrogant teenager.  The reality was quite different.  I ended up with come up my nose and a sore jaw.”  He winked at Steve.  “And look at me now, darling.”
Stark was stretching his muscles from side to side now.  He still had his earbuds in.  And Steve really needed to concentrate on his own warmup.  He forced his mind back to his routine, running through his choreography in his head.  If he forgot his steps again, Fury was going to kill him.  And he really did need the money.
flexible, and the way he shook his hips and twisted his body around was something to see for—well, for sure.
, and nothing else.  Tony kissed the back of his neck, and it was like someone had set off little fireworks all through Steve.  He felt so warm.
As soon as he threw it forward against Tony’s shoulders, he knew Tony recognized the soft fall of the white leather against his skin, because he smiled to himself, closed his eyes, and relaxed into it.  Steve smiled at that, too, a little touched at the response, skimmed his hand up Tony’s leg to rest it behind his knee, as he let the falls spread out over Tony’s skin, dragged it down, then brought it up, threw it again.
.  He felt like he was disintegrating, falling apart, and yet loving every moment of it.  He groaned again, lifted his hips, and Steve took him obligingly, curled his tongue around him all the while.  His fingers bit into Tony’s asscheeks again, tight little points of pain that lingered wonderfully in his muscles.  Tony hoped they bruised.  Steve was clearly urging him on, so he let himself settle into a slow, easy rhythm of rocking his hips up and forward, hopefully one that wouldn’t be too difficult at all for Steve to follow.
“You just let me know,” he said, and stroked his hand down over the back of Tony’s hand, his forearm, stroking at the hair that prickled over the skin, down to rub at the sensitive skin at the inside of Tony’s elbow with his thumb, watched Tony shiver, because he liked that, liked strokes to his sensitive inner elbows, the inside of his knees.  Steve loved touching him there, seeing him breathe out, twitch his hips lightly, squirm, the light trembling shudder that would go through every inch of him.
“Such a good boy,” Steve murmured, reaching out to stroke his palm over the top of it, through the fabric.  Tony shivered, breathed out and let his eyes slide closed.  Steve’s hand was warmer than his, broad and powerful and strong, and he felt the warmth of it even through the cage as he closed it over the cage, Tony’s cock, through the silk, rubbed gently.  “You like this so much.  Did you think about me while you cleaned yourself out?  Are you all nice and clean inside?”
Brock’s rough fingers pinched his sore, stinging buttock a moment later, and Steve quieted his gasp.  “Sweet, sweet sub,” he muttered.  “You’d make some soft asshole the sweetest service sub on the planet.  Well.  Anyway, sweet little sub.  Service slut.”  Another rough, almost cruel little rub into Steve’s soft hole, where he was wet and messy with spunk, deeper, against that spot that always felt so good, that made Steve swallow back a cry and clutch harder at the coverlet.  “Got to fill up this,” he gave a harsh tug, “needy,” another tug, “sloppy,” another, until Steve bit down on his hand, “hole.”
, hon.  And these big, pillowy, whipped cream tits, strawberry pink, until they turn, well, strawberry red.”  Steve bit his lip, flushing hot.  “And we’ve already had a few loads of buttercream.”  Tony waggled his eyebrows at him, and Steve was so hot by this point he felt like he might faint, might get heatstroke, or—or something.  “But I know how much you like to lick off the frosting first.  I think you’ve got plenty where that came from.”  His fingers slid down, teased at the head of Steve’s cock, just a little, and Steve gasped, bowed forward, almost sobbed, as Tony’s callused fingertips pulled and tugged at his cockhead, so sensitive it almost hurt as pleasure, sensation, raw and immediate and hot and overwhelming, swept through him.  “This is just as red as your hot little nipples,” Tony said.  “Maybe this is your cherry.”
“Well, all right, sweetheart,” Steve said, and his hand pressed flat, so warm and broad, on Tony’s stomach, as his other slid gripped Tony’s thigh, around his hip, even more firmly, and then he was shifting his hips, rolling his them with a kind of liquid movement that shifted Steve’s cock in and out of Tony in little rolling thrusts instead of any kind of dramatic in and out movement.  Tony whined, felt his head thunk back against Steve’s shoulder, because that kept him so
“I know what you want,” Tony said softly.  “Yeah?”  Another little bit of pressure, sending pain shooting from that oh-so-sensitive skin and flesh to every part of Steve’s body.  “You want me to step on you.  You want me to hurt you.  Give this big gorgeous cock a nice little kick, huh?”
Steve spent long minutes after licking into him, soft and hot and slick, the muscles of his strong tongue insistent but soft on his inner walls, until Tony felt like he was wet, dripping, shivering with the gentle wetness and pleasure of it.  He could feel himself slowly relaxing into it, despite the invasiveness, the hot wet warmth and demanding slickness in a place that felt so strange for it to be, and then Steve reached up with one slick hand, still holding Tony open with the other, and started to rub at Tony’s now free cock, stroking it gently, tugging at it, smoothing his palm soft and smooth over the head, and Tony sighed low and trembling, shivered, rocked forward into that strong, firm, callused palm, feeling himself really relax.  Steve was licking deeply into him, letting it go slick and wet so that Tony could feel the cool air against the skin over his damp ass cheeks, the heat of Steve’s breath, his mouth, deep inside, even as Steve continued to massage, to tug at, his cock.
“Shh,” Steve said, stroking the back of Tony’s neck.  “Shh, sweetheart.  That was so good.  You were so good.”
“You’re such a good boy,” Steve murmured, stroking the insides of his thighs now, with the backs of his fingers, making Tony shiver, feel hot all over.  “So sweet.  Thanks for taking care of that for me.”
Tony groaned at the idea. “Sure thing, slugger,” he murmured. His own cock throbbed now, aching, as he turned around, shuffled forward and gripped the sides of the mirror with both hands, steadying himself, very aware of how the position pushed his ass out toward Steve as he squeezed his thighs together, unable to resist rubbing them together as he pressed them tight, feeling the silky softness of his stockings, the gentle tease of the lace over his thighs.
How could he not feel better, with Tony here?  With Tony here, holding him, petting him like that, keeping him safe and warm?
And now here he was.  Giving into his baser desires.  Seeking out one of his subordinates for sex.  Steve sighed, rubbed one hand through the sweaty hair at the back of his neck and shook his head at himself.
“’m always lucky when you’re out there on the field, ‘s all,” Steve managed to get out, and that warm, tight feeling in his chest got warmer when Tony grinned and laughed.
Steve smiled, kissed his lips again, softly, and pulled his fingers out of Tony. They made a wet, squelching noise, and Tony immediately felt a hot flush travel over him from his head down over the back of his neck, feeling very aware of the cool wet feeling of his hole.  He felt—open, ready for Steve’s cock, the way Steve liked him before he’d even consider putting it inside him, soft and open and dripping with lube.
“Okay,” Steve said, and gave Tony one last, long caress over his warm shoulders, down over his back, before he set the flogger aside and reached for another one.
“Sure,” Tony said, and there was a tension in his eyes, and Steve didn’t know why, wished he could ease it, even as Tony’s smile grew more careless, more bright, and less, somehow, soft and real.  “Why not?”
“That’s it, sweetheart,” Tony murmured.  He pushed the tablet on his lap over a little, stroking Steve’s hair again. “Just relax.”
, Steve, you’re so good at that.  Just look at you, you’re so good at that.  Perfect mouth, perfect tongue, you feel so good on me, hot mouth, you’re so good with your tongue, getting all wet and sloppy, huh?  That’s good, sloppy’s so good.  Feels so nice, so nice and wet.  So hot.  Not afraid to get wet and messy, are you?  That’s perfect.  Yeah, yeah, kiss it.”  Steve was ducking his head, kissing at the head, swirling his tongue around it and then going back to sucking softly, kissing against it, tongue against the underside, catching it between his lips, even as Tony groaned and rocked his hips forward, sliding his cockhead back and forth, in and out between Steve’s soft lips and hot tongue.  “See?  See, you have the instincts for this, big guy.  I knew you did.  I knew you’d do great.  Knew you’d do wonderfully, be wonderful.”
, doing something that he wanted, that he’d asked for.  For Tony.  His voice sounded wrecked.  He sounded like he’d been gargling with barbed wire.  “Yeah, y-yeah.  Put ‘em . . . put ‘em on me, hurt me, Tony, please.”
“Yes, sir,” Steve mumbled. He still felt sleepy, thick, pleasantly transported on the warmth and solidity of Tony’s body, the warmth and welcome of his presence.  “You’re the boss.”
Of course it was honest, Steve wanted to say, would have said, if he could think straight.  He honestly
Tony panted, trying to obey, and slowly his breaths slowed, something uncoiled inside him, and he felt a warm wave of slow soft easiness wash over him, the tightness in his belly smooth out, soften into something hot and liquid, the ache in his cock somehow settle into him, like it was part of him.  He leaned his sweaty forehead against Steve’s shoulder, gasping.  “Oh,” he managed.  “S-Steve.  Sunshine.”
“Merry Christmas, sweetheart,” Steve replied, and covered Tony’s hand with his own, stroking the back of his hand just as gently, turning to press a kiss against his palm.  Tony sighed, a soft little exhalation of breath, his eyes fluttering closed.  He kissed Tony’s palm again, then reached down, grabbed a marshmallow covered in whipped cream, and held it to Tony’s lips.
Something twisted up tight and uncertain in Steve’s chest, in his belly.  “Yeah?” he said, and it came out quieter than he’d meant it to.  “You mean that?”
“Oh, yeah,” Steve said. “Guess I am.”  He smiled, gave Tony a long slow rub of his prostate inside with both fingers that left him trembling, gasping, rocking on his knees as he desperately tried to ride the pleasure that send quivering through his body. “I wasn’t talking about my fingers, though.”
“How about you?” Steve asked, even as Tony slid his hands into his hair and started to massage at his scalp, scratching his fingers gently along it.  “Ah.  Oh, man, Tony.  That feels good.  You have about a million years to quit doing that.”
So he started slow, with this—it was a thick mop, but still just about the lightest flogger they had, and he stroked it over the round, rosy cheeks of Tony’s rear before he swung back and hit it against his skin. He went easy, kept it light, knowing that even then, it would feel more intense against the skin of Tony’s buttocks, already stinging and warm from Steve’s heavy hand.  He couldn’t help but revel in the way that Tony gasped, lifted his rear up into the strokes of the flogger, even as Steve let it slide down over his thighs, a silky tease over the sensitive skin, up and down the inside of first one thigh, then the other, before he teasingly flicked it up against Tony’s perineum, his balls, his cock, not hard enough to hurt or with really any force at all, and made him gasp and shiver, moaning and rocking on his knees, before Steve brought it back around in a gentle drag against Tony’s warm red rear, smacking lightly across it.  Tony moaned, dragged his face against the pillow, hands curling into fists in the covers, and rocked back into it.
“Sir,” Steve said helplessly, then had to swallow, hard.  Oh, God, the way his cock was throbbing now, now that he was aware of it.  “Sir, I—oh, Tony.  Sir.”
“Do you like that?” Tony whispered, his own voice rasping, rambling.  “Do you like my cock in your mouth?  Does it fill you up nicely?  Feel good, nice and hot and salty on your tongue?  You like that?  Do you like the taste of me, do you like the idea of me inside you like that?  Swallow my spunk down and let it keep your belly warm, huh?  You like that?”
, and he flinched away, yelped despite himself.  He wouldn’t have done it if he could have helped it, but it wasn’t all bad, because then Tony’s other hand was stroking his jaw, petting his face, gentle, soothing touches, like he needed them.  And that was
“Good,” Tony managed on a tight groan of his own.  “I want you to feel good.  You’re doing so well for me.  Doing so good sucking my cock, huh?  Just look at me, huh?  Look what you’re doing to me.  Is that turning you on?”
Steve felt his face on fire.  He was probably red down to his rear, from the way the flush felt, the way it prickled down his spine, his tailbone, down his chest over his nipples.  “He’s with someone,” he said, instead of everything else he could have said, and had to swallow hard, again.  His cock was throbbing, and it was hard to get a breath.
“Cupcake . . .?” Steve managed, feeling himself go bright red, probably all the way down to his damn toes, which wanted to curl, tucking themselves up against his feet, because of course they did.
“That’s it,” he groaned, “oh, that’s it, that’s perfect, sweetheart, God, Steve, that’s so good; that’s just exactly right.”  Steve licked him again, and he whimpered; there was no denying that had been a whimper.
“You are,” Tony insisted, then grinned and bit lightly at the lobe of Steve’s ear to lighten the moment.  “Big, beautiful, and you can suck cock like a champ.”
Tony’s hands came up and framed his face, and he pressed a kiss to Steve’s forehead, and Steve felt something in him relax, some tight insecurity coiled painfully in his belly loosen and smooth out, as Tony brushed hair back off his forehead and kissed him there again, at his hairline.  “Okay, sweetheart,” he said.  “I’m going to pull out.  I’m sorry.  You ready?”
Steve, incredibly, somehow, held still, just kissing Tony’s neck, rubbing his stomach, not moving the slightest bit, even though Tony could feel the strain of it in the hot skin under his hand, the trembling muscles of his thighs and stomach, the tightness of the body behind him.  Tony squeezed his hip a moment later, anchoring himself, rubbed at Steve’s skin. “Go ‘head,” he managed to gasp out, finally.  “Oh, yeah.”
“Um,” Steve said.  His breath was warm, damp, feathering over Tony’s lips and chin.  He pushed his chest up under Tony’s hands, apparently unconsciously, and Tony obliged him, plucking gently at his nipples, squeezing and tugging, with both hands. He realized it was distracting, but he couldn’t resist giving Steve that little extra pleasure.  He kept fondling at his heaving chest, tugging at his nipple, with one hand, reached down with the other and rubbed at Steve’s cock, pulling on it gently, sliding his foreskin up over the head, until Steve was panting, hard and throbbing and furiously hot in his hand.  “Uh,” Steve said again, breathy.  His hands squeezed at Tony’s side, one coming up to his arm, almost kneading at the muscles.  “God, Tony, I—God.  That’s …” he was jerking his hips up into Tony’s grip, his cock very hard now.
releasing because Tony hadn’t let him yet, until his bound hands were twitching into fists and his shoulders were quivering, shaking, against Tony’s.
Tony pressed lightly, and Steve felt dizzy, barely recognized the high whine that came out of his mouth.  It struck him that this was the most attention Tony had paid to his cock this entire time, ever since Steve had first gotten undressed, and his cock throbbed desperately as a heavy, needy noise escaped him quick on the heels of the first one.
to rub off on Steve, against his stomach, and the prickling need in his cock had nowhere to go, his breath practically sobbing in his throat.
“Oh, yeah,” Tony groaned.  He bit his bottom lip, licked at it.  He could practically feel himself salivating.  “That’s the stuff.  Look at that big ol’ salami, huh?”
Steve wasn’t thinking straight, he was feeling warm and soft, getting to hold him like that, when he linked their fingers, curled his own inwards against his stomach, and let his mind drift.
Steve wanted to say yes, yes, it was so good, it was so, so good, but he couldn’t seem to string words together, or think to speak.  Finally he managed to groan out, “Yes, Tony, please,” his voice a slurring, rasping mess, and he could feel it as Tony moaned with pleasure, felt his cock twitching and hot inside him, because of course Tony always wanted to please him, nothing turned Tony on more than hearing he was doing a good job for Steve.  God, he wanted to please him, he wanted to feel, hear him come, he wanted to make him come with his body, he wanted that so bad.  He felt himself moan, rocked back against Tony’s cock even as it made the weights swing and pull on his tits, made his muscles squeeze down around him, and he was rewarded by the way Tony’s weight came down harder against his back, the way he moaned and rolled his face against Steve’s raw shoulder with a moan of his own.
“Careful, there,” Tony murmured, low and soft.  There was a sweet, almost shy smile on his face.  “It’ll go to my head.”
.  That wasn’t what he’d meant to apologize for.  Why couldn’t Tony understand what he’d meant?  He took a breath to try again, but then Tony was shifting.  He lifted Steve’s leg, one hand under his boot, the other against his knee, slid it up onto the thigh of the armor, and oh, now that hurt, now that hurt a lot.  Steve shut his eyes and tried to breathe out evenly.  He didn’t want to—to cry out, or seem like he was—was weak or angling for Tony’s sympathy, or his pity.  “So, this is broken, champ,” Tony said.  “And I mean, you probably know it’s—it’s pretty damn torn up, yeah?”
Tony made a happy, contented sort of humming noise, and let Steve pull his head down to his shoulder, slide his arm around his waist.  Steve stroked his hair, pulled up the blanket to get a good look at one of Tony’s thighs, his round red buttock, running his hand gently over it, making Tony pant and writhe and grin up at him, teased his hand up under the blanket over Tony’s shoulders, caressing them, making Tony gasp, teasing him even as Steve smiled down at him, called him beautiful, again and again and again, praised him for how well he did until Tony was pressing his face into his shoulder again, smiling as Steve teased at his hot, sensitive skin and kissed his forehead and called him beautiful because he was, he always was.
“Oh, honey, I’m so glad,” Tony said.  He rubbed his hand through Steve’s hair, scratched at the back of his head, down over his neck.  “Want you to feel as good as you’re making me feel.  Are you feeling good?”
It all seemed to happen more quickly then, time sliding into a soft, easy meld, a mash that settled around him, things slipping and sliding into each other, and all of it felt cushioned around him, warm and good.  Tony slipped his fingers out of Steve, and Steve thought oh, yeah, he was very wet with lube, as he felt air chill on his hole, and then Tony’s cock was there, warm on his hole, the head hot and thick, and he bore down and Tony gasped, moaned, said, “Oh, yeah, yeah, oh, Steve, honey, just like that, just like that, stud, so good, opening up for me so beautifully, you’re so good at that,” and it felt so good, so, so good to hear him say that, that Steve moaned a little.  And then he was moving, Tony was moving inside him, and he was hot and hard and thick, stretching Steve out wide around his length and his heat, and Steve’s thighs trembled, and he fell to his forearms, locked them against the bed, let his head hang down forward between them. Tony ran his hand up and down the broad slope of Steve’s shaking back, along his spine, and he shivered it felt so good, and then Tony was fucking him.  He swayed with each thrust, the clamps on his tits swinging and sore and his tits numb yet throbbing, and Tony hit his prostate and it was so good, all so good, his prostate tender and almost sore but the pleasure still arching through him, high and sweet and all-encompassing, his whole body prickling, and it was so good, every time.
putting his own orgasm off; he could feel Tony’s cock hot and hard through his slacks pushing up against his back the way Tony was holding him, the bulge of his hard hot length against his spine, while he lavished attention on Steve; he could feel him a little wet through his slacks, his underwear.  It made Steve feel—feel helpless and greedy.  He could hold off, he knew he could, but—but Tony seemed to enjoy it, a lot more than he did, the holding off, so maybe it was all right.  It was torture for Steve, the waiting; his whole body was already pulled tight with need, with anticipation, hope for another orgasm, and he felt like a needy, wanting mess, an embarrassment, out of control, a quivering wreck, totally in Tony’s hands now, and he loved it, had to bite back a sob just at the twisting, wonderful, out of control thought.
When he got it undone, he dragged it off, too, Steve’s undershirt, next, leaving him there bare-chested in the air of his apartment, feeling it prickle over his cold sweat, along the peaked hard pebbles of his nipples, and then Steve felt him buckling the belt around his wrists and whatever it was inside him that needed that, it relaxed, it went soft and sweet inside him again, he felt it unspooling inside his head, in his chest.  He moaned, rocked his hips forward before he knew what he was doing.  His cock throbbed, hurting so badly still, throbbing, a solid mass of agony between his legs, hot and tender and stinging with blood, like a massive bruise, but he didn’t even care, even as his hardening length made it hurt worse.  He gasped helplessly against the floor, and Brock grabbed his hair, dragged his face along it.  “Clean it up,” Brock gasped out, breathless and hot, “mouth better than a damn hoover.”
“Okay,” Steve said, feeling his face break out into a smile, brushing Tony’s hair back off his forehead again.  “Okay, it was good.”
Tony panted.  He wanted to say yeah, Steve, he could tell that, thank you very much, but he couldn’t seem to find the mental or physical coordination.  Taking Steve was always just so—overwhelming.  He was so big, and Tony swore he barely fit inside him, spreading him apart the way he did, until Tony was left trembling, gasping, barely able to stand the overwhelming heat and just, just
“Thank you, Tony,” Steve murmured, leaned forward, covering him with his warm strength, his sturdy body, again, kissed his shoulder, the back of his neck, and then he was reaching back, had to be angling himself, and there was the wet sound of him adding more lube, slicking himself.  His fingers brushed more gently over Tony’s hole, pushed just inside with a big squirt of it and twisted, painting it along his inner walls, and then Steve was pushing into him.
“Don’t say you’re not clean,” Steve murmured, gently fingers stroking the underside of Tony’s balls, through the silky lace of his panties, making him shiver, shake.  “I know you spent hours on it earlier, getting all spic and span for me inside.”
“That’s my old-fashioned guy,” Tony said, smiling fondly, and kissed him again.  “Gonna get Jarvis to make you malted milk every year,” he said, against Steve’s bottom lip, and curled his tongue hotly against it, into his mouth.  Steve groaned.  Tony rocked into him, his body all heat and muscle, kissed damp, wet kisses deep into his mouth.  “Make you a malted milk cake for your birthday, red, white, and blue,” he murmured in his ear.  Steve shivered.
That was a bit—well, it was true, of course.  Steve couldn’t blame him for that.  But that hadn’t been how he’d expected this to go.  He shook Tony’s hand all the same, tried a smile.  “We met before,” he said, sheepishly.  “Years ago, now.  I was … um, I was smaller then.”
Steve lit up again, and Tony felt an answering warmth in his own chest at the idea that Steve wanted to spend the night in his bed.  He was getting used to that, and every time it felt so good, warm and safe and—and—well, it was just good.  “You got yourself a deal,” Steve said.
“Mmm,” Steve groaned at that, the vibration traveling so perfectly along Tony’s cock, and he pressed closer, opened up his mouth a little bit more and let Tony’s cock slide just far enough to flirt with the back of his throat, then pulled himself off nearly to the tip again, lips tight, providing him with suction until Tony was moaning.  Through his own pleasure, Tony was vaguely aware of Steve’s hips jumping, how he pressed them down into the bed and rolled them idly, the big broad length of Steve’s erection obvious behind the soft, clinging fabric.  Steve whimpered, at that, and the feeling of that noise around his cock shot to Tony’s belly and coiled tight in his balls, throbbing hot in his groin.  Hell, was Steve really that into it?  Sucking Tony’s cock?  It seemed impossible, improbable in the extreme, and yet there he was, idly rolling just one big broad thigh against the bed to press his cock into it just a little, flushed all over and hot against Tony’s legs, blatantly turned on.
Tony gave a breathless, disbelieving little laugh, with a catch in his throat like it was almost hysterical, and there was a strange sheen in his eyes.  “Okay, yeah, there you are,” he said.  “Now you decide to join us, right, of course.  Doing a great Capsicle impression there, big guy.”
Steve just smiled at him, and the expression was so—so soft, so warm, so damn loving, like it made him feel a little overcome, a little choked up, just to
The mirror was mostly clean now, and Tony had to bend down almost to the floor to get the rest of it, lick it up off the frame.  It pushed his ass up, as he arched his back, tried to lean down, so of course that was when Steve set his lube-slick thumbs at Tony’s damp, softly massaged into open relaxation hole, pulled him slightly apart, hands gripping his ass cheeks and parting them as his thumbs slid in, and pressed his mouth, soft and hot and wet, to the soft slick open rim of Tony’s hole.  He kissed at the rim of it, soft and sweet, then sucked a little, until Tony shivered, moaned a little, uncontrollably, at the soft wet suction against such a sensitive place, rocked on his knees, and then Steve was kissing him again, but more lewdly, like he would have kissed his mouth with tongue, licking into him, sliding it wetly along his rim, his inner muscles, in and out, flickering and wet and warm.  Tony trembled, vividly aware of the wet soft strength of Steve’s tongue at his most intimate place, of the stockings pooling and slipping on his legs, starting to slide down toward his knees, of his cock throbbing and nipples prickling and the saliva that was sliding into his goatee, all across his cheeks and lips, the soft ache of his jaw.
Honey pie, Steve thought, dazed and slow, a little disbelieving.  Growing up on the Lower East Side had he ever even dreamed anyone would call him that, even a little bit seriously?  He felt a little giddy.
“Well, I’ve probably got that part under control,” Steve said, self-deprecating, and Tony laughed, and they both took a drink of cocoa.  Steve put his down, after a moment, and leaned in and kissed Tony again, tasting cocoa and whipped cream on his mouth.  “Tasting malted milk on your tongue,” Steve murmured against Tony’s mouth.  “Highlight of my holiday so far.”
At some point, Tony fisted his hand in Steve’s hair and half dragged him, half guided him, up on shaky legs, still biting his chest with sharp, painful pleasure, sucking bruises out of the skin, then pushed him back, back, back.  Steve could barely think—his nipple was a throbbing ache, a reflection of his cock except that this one Tony
Tony was quiet for a moment, pulling off his skate and flexing his toes, then tugging off the other. “I have to admit,” he said, as he straightened up, “your attitude is a new one on me.”
, since they’d started, and Steve felt like he might just vibrate out of his skin.  His hips wanted to jerk so badly.  He felt so hot under his skin, like he’d gone molten from his core out.  His cock was on fire, all blazing heat and burning, hot sensation under Tony’s teasing fingers, so sore from his foot and now all sensitive pleasure from his fingertips.
.”  The emphasis on that made Steve flush, made awareness curl hot and tight in his belly, made him gasp and his cock jerk.  He leaned in, just like Tony said, and Tony petted his neck, squeezed gently, then slid his hand down Steve’s sore back, leaving him flinching and hot, his cock drooling with need with every touch, jerking every time Tony’s hand skimmed over a welt, to grip Steve’s other cheek in his other hand.  He squeezed so hard that Steve cried out, felt a hot wash of pleasure, welling up hot and hard in his cock, felt it jerking, the head prickling hot with need and pleasure, precome dripping from him like a faucet, and whimpered, because he
Steve pulled off again, panting breaths shivering along Tony’s wet cock, a sharp contrast to the overheated wetness of the tender, sensitive skin.  “You can come wherever you want,” he mumbled.  “Mouth’s good.”
.  He could kick through a stone wall with one foot, braced properly, but he felt weak and stumbling and clumsy as Brock slid his fingers through Steve’s belt loops and pulled him in against his chest, toward him, and toward his bed.
When he woke up, he felt very, very cold.  He was shivering.  Brock wasn’t inside him anymore, and his hole felt wet and sticky.  Messy.  He dragged his knees up toward his stomach before he opened his eyes, realized Brock had tugged the blankets back off him.
—“Good little fucksleeve, ain’tcha?”  His hand came up, rubbed loosely over Steve’s face, thumb tugging at his lips, and then fell to his belly.  He tugged the blankets up over them when Steve was still blinking, trying to process what had happened.  And with that, he was asleep, still in Steve’s body.
to.  I still want to.”  Tony could see the stubborn set to his jaw, even with the way he was caressing his thigh with his lips, his face.  He pushed his face in between Tony’s thigh and his cock, against the crease there, and left a kiss, then pulled back, enough to kiss Tony’s thigh lower down, closer to his knee, the top of his leg.
known what that meant until Brock had explained to him in exhaustive detail one night, after he’d fucked Steve twice and gotten four fingers up into his hole, and was using his hold to make Steve jerk and jump on all fours, laughing at him and calling his hot little cockpuppet, his slutty hand-sleeve, his loose pussy, because that’s what he was, Brock had said, a hole, a gaping, hungry hole—and Steve had come, when Brock teased a finger along his prostate and slapped at his cock and called him a hole.  His face burned.  He wondered again why he was like this.  How could he like this, to be demeaned, to be slapped, to be spat on, to be—
“Can’t wait to see what we do tomorrow,” Tony murmured.  Maybe Steve would want Tony to fuck him in the cage.  Maybe he would come into Tony’s office in the mansion while he was working and take him over his desk; he’d done that before while Tony was in chastity.  He couldn’t wait, either way.  He loved the floaty, relaxed, easiness he got when his cock was locked up, not chasing an orgasm, not fighting with his body and himself to come, not worrying about coming too soon or too late, the way it took the pressure off, the way it made him feel loose and easy and good about focusing on Steve, about letting Steve focus on him.  It was going to be a good rest of the week.
“Your back feels all right?”  Tony’s hand on his thigh skimmed up, over the raw, marked, stinging skin of Steve’s rear, and pinched lightly, making Steve gasp, arch up with a hot, hard breath, bite his bottom lip.  “Your poor little peach of an ass?”
“I, uh, I, I love you, too, sunshine,” Tony said, stammering and sweet and unsure, and God, Steve loved him so much.
“Am not,” he said.  “Besides, I’m supposed to think you’re the most handsome man I’ve ever seen.  It’s all part of being a good boyfriend.”
, and it felt so good, he just let it settle inside him, warm him up from the inside out, tighten and throb in his chest until it felt tender with the sweet warm wonderful ache those words made him feel, all soft and loose and warm and liquid in his belly.  Steve was stroking his hair, gently, hand sliding, tugging through the thick, curling strands, dragging heavy and firm over the curve of Tony’s skull, and Tony breathed out a long, deep breath, relaxed into the pleasure.  It felt so good, Steve just rubbing and stroking the back of his neck, through his hair.   “You’re so good,” Steve said, again, and Tony felt himself go hot, the heat sinking in deep over his ears, the back of his neck, shivered and pressed in tighter against him.  “You’re so perfect,” Steve said, “just look at you, you’re so sweet for me, God, you love this.”
“’S not flattery if it’s true,” Steve said, still smiling at Tony and not caring how dopey or lovestruck it looked.  “You already know I think you’re just about the best-looking guy on the planet.  That a surprise?”
Whenever he said Tony instead of Stark it still sent a little thrill through Tony, coiled tight and warm in his chest and belly, made his skin tingle, prickling.  He caught his breath despite himself, realized he had his mouth open, his tongue against his bottom lip.  Steve looked up at him and smiled, and then he leaned up quickly, pressed a kiss against Tony’s mouth.  His lips were soft and dry, his breath hot and wet and panting, and Tony moaned against it, closed his eyes and let himself arch up into it.
Tony smiled at him, his eyes full.  “Don’t you start, sunshine boy,” he said.  “I did all of this for you out of the goodness of my heart.”
He was blinking up into Tony’s concerned face a moment later. And it was strange, because it was like he hadn’t even remembered Tony existed until he saw him—hair falling into his eyes, sweaty and sticking to his forehead, so he must have taken his helmet off, his face flushed and his eyes frantic—but then when he did it was as if something had fallen back into place, and his life was complete again, and a wave of warm, bright happiness swelled in Steve’s chest, even bigger and brighter than the pain.  He realized he was grinning, probably dopily, up at him.
Brock started by running his rough hands over Steve’s throbbing rear, squeezing and digging in his fingers, his thumbs.  He tugged him open, spit on Steve’s hole, and Steve’s cheeks went hot with shame.  He fingered him roughly, grunting the whole time, until Steve felt slick and open with lube, muttering something hot and humiliating about Steve’s—Steve’s pussy.  Steve hadn’t
Tony blinked at him a moment, and his mouth moved, making shapes, but no words came.  He swallowed, then smiled again, suddenly, brightly.  “You’d know I’d stay with you any time, sweetheart,” he said.  “I could climb in bed with you while you sleep, but that might hurt, babe.  Not enough room for both me and you, big guy.”  He gestured illustratively at how Steve’s large arms were already precariously near the edge of the small hospital bed.
He should say hello. Steve straightened up from his own stretch and wiped his hands on his sweats before he started across the warmup room.
Steve’s fingers came up a moment later, petted softly over the lace borders of Tony’s stockings, before sliding between his thighs, rubbing at the soft skin just above them. They kept moving up, slid under Tony’s lacy little skirt, kneading at the rounded curves of his ass, massaging against the garters, the lacy edge of Tony’s panties where they peeked out from under it, down over the top of his thighs.  He bent down, warm breath shivering over Tony’s back where it was bare, before he pressed soft, wet kisses down his spine, first over the bare skin, then down through the silky soft lace of the babydoll where it covered Tony’s back, hung loose over his sides.  Tony shivered under him, cock throbbing, and then Steve’s big, heavy length was pushing between his thighs, making Tony hyper-aware of the garters, the stockings, the way the lace and the straps pushed into his skin.  He moaned, pushed back against him, and then Steve was gasping into his back, pressing a kiss right under Tony’s ear, against his neck, and fucking him.
Tony caught his breath on a gasp, feeling it vividly as a tremor went through him, lancing hot through his cock, making it swell, throb against the smooth metal tight around it. He moaned, overwhelmed, bucked his hips up, then pushed them back on Steve’s finger, trying to be good, to take him deeper.  Steve gripped his hip, squeezing, massaging his ass tightly with his other hand, and Tony gasped for air, got one hand down and rubbed instinctively at the metal encasing his cock, groaning.  It was just a ghost of sensation, of warmth, but it took the feeling even higher, somehow, and Steve didn’t stop him, just murmured praise to him as he sank his finger even deeper inside, began to thrust it in and out, gentle and slow, stretching Tony inside with gentle circles and pushes of his knuckles, curling it, working it inside, each time.  Tony was gasping, chest heaving, gulping with each breath, his mouth wet, gripping desperately at his cock, dragging his hand up and down the metal surface as Steve worked his finger inside him, before too long, feeling hot and overwhelmed and shivering with it, Steve’s finger soft and dragging against him inside in a way that left him feeling sensitive and hot around him already, close and clinging and tight, tender and throbbing at every touch, especially when Steve began to stroke his prostate and pleasure sparked hot and needy through Tony’s body, thrumming under his skin, with each sweet, hot pulse of slowly building pleasure as Steve rubbed at him.  Tony was moaning, panting, already, as Steve worked in another finger, and his cock throbbed needily, twinged as it was constrained by the cage.
“Oh, yeah,” Tony said, breathlessly.  “You are, huh?  You’re getting so hard from this.”  He blinked through the haziness of the pleasure, the starry dazzle of pleasure over his eyes, and glanced down toward Steve’s dick, where he was sprawled out over the bed, saw the impressive erection tenting his soft workout pants.  “Look at you, huh?  So damn big, slugger, filling up your pants up so well, straining at the seams.  That’s all for me, just from sucking my cock.  Look at that.  So big, so needy, so hard.  So hard, aren’t you?  You could pound nails with that thing, just from sucking me off.  From sucking my cock.  You like it, don’t you?  Like sucking my cock like this.”  Steve moaned through his nose, panting, and his eyes slid closed.  He let go of Tony’s cock, just long enough to slide his hand down and palm his own dick.  Steve’s big hand made his bigger cock look even more obscenely gigantic as he cupped it, shaped it through the soft fabric, made the rigid length of it even more obvious against it.  “Oh, yeah,” Tony murmured, his voice going soft and gentle, somehow, as he gripped Steve’s hair, rocked his cock gently between his lips, into his mouth, watching as Steve’s saliva spilled over, trailed down one side of his jaw, as he drooled messily around him, his eyes closed as if in bliss.  “You do love that, look at you.  You feeling good, handsome?”
Tony wasn’t sure how long it took after that—he couldn’t have said, really.  He had a vague impression that it hadn’t been much longer at all, but for all he knew it could have been hours, he was so lost in the pleasure of what Steve was doing for him, running his hand through his hair, and rolling his hips as softly as he could he manage and gasping his breath between babbling words of praise for Steve.  If someone had told him he’d been there for hours with Steve’s mouth on his cock, he’d have believed them.  Everything sort of spun out and solidified, like strands of sugar, going amber and gold all around him, perfect pleasure as he was suspended there in the midst of it, hanging by a thread that was his cock in Steve’s mouth.  Steve balanced his cock on his tongue, slurped around the head, wrapped both his hands around it and got his knees under him and suckled, bobbed his head, clearly losing his inhibitions a bit now, getting the hang of it, pushing Tony higher and higher, dragging his mouth down over the tip and playing his tongue against the slit, covering the whole head with the warm wet drag of his tongue then balancing it on his tongue again to play gently with his tongue, licking it gently all over, going down far enough to nuzzle and suck on his balls then back up to suck at the tip.  Tony thought his brain was probably drowning in endorphins, neurons going off in little fizzy sparks, spinning all around, he thought fancifully—his brain probably hadn’t produced so many endorphins at once, so powerfully, for months.  Steve was always good to him in bed, but this was something else, the pleasure so pure and powerful Tony found himself hanging onto Steve’s hair for dear life, shaking against the bed, his thighs shuddering, twitching helplessly as Steve sucked him higher and higher.
“I had things to do,” Steve said, and swallowed.  His mouth already felt dry with anticipation, and he knew he was red in the face, flushed, already, with the awareness of how his erection was tenting his slacks.
, pain rocketing through him, all over, head to toe, left him gasping.  He realized his eyes were open, and there were blurry buildings obscuring a blue sky.
He was amazing.  Steve still wasn’t sure where the judges got off giving Steve anywhere near the PCS they gave Tony, especially with the depth and quality of his edges to go along with it.  His legs looked a lot less wobbly today, too, though, of course, he didn’t do any quads today.  There was no need for it in an exhibition, of course, especially when Tony’s quads weren’t the strongest.  Steve just wished he himself could remember to use his arms like Tony did—though he didn’t think he had any chance of that.  The lines of them were so elegant, and the way he used them seemed totally different, based on his music—finger snapping and swinging his hips, now.
Tony kissed him for a long time.  Steve couldn’t have been happier.  He was floating, somewhere where everything was pleasure, deep and sweet and good, the kiss perfect, sending little shivers of pleasure through his whole body as Tony kissed him and kissed him.  He kept moving his mouth against Tony’s, maybe a little clumsily, but he didn’t even care, rocked by pleasure every time Tony easily moved with his lips or tongue, gave him even more exactly what he wanted, even more perfectly.
Steve pulled off again, kissed the tip of his cock with what felt to Tony like incredible fondness, considering, slid his big warm hand up along his dick, stroking, in a way that had Tony trembling, moaning again despite himself.  “More than just New York State, from what I heard,” he said, and that fondness was still in his voice, somehow.  His hand slid down, rubbed at Tony’s balls, pushed back behind them until Tony was groaning as he rocked his fingers, then his knuckles, gently back into his perineum.  “So what, you’re putting on the Ritz for me and you think I won’t want to do the same for you?”
“Steve,” he groaned, practically whispered, whimpered, jerking his hips up helplessly, spasmodically, into Steve’s hand.
.  “The fight’s practically over anyway,” he said.  “Thor and Shulkie are just mopping up now.  With Carol’s help.  Looks like they’re having plenty of fun.”
“Thank you,” Steve whispered, and Tony’s eyes filled, with liquid emotion, with fondness, with love.
, the thick heat and pressure of Steve, and he leaned back against him, panting, as Steve slid back into him, balls-deep, but if he hadn’t been nice and ready, in this position he wouldn’t have been able to do even that; he didn’t have much leverage.
swallowing,” he said bluntly.  “But not everyone does.  If you want to spit, spit.  I’m going to have the sheets laundered anyway.”
Tony gave a soft, moaning groan, his cock already throbbing insistently in the cage just at Steve’s words. “That sounds good, sweetie,” he murmured.  “It sounds really good.”
“Of course I am,” Tony murmured.  “I don’t want to be anywhere else.  Shhh, honeybunch.  Relax. I’ve gotcha.”
That didn’t necessarily mean he wouldn’t be disgusted, though.  That just meant he’d have already made up his mind on it.
, and all that.  But he knew Steve didn’t want him to be any different than he was.  He just—he just liked seeing Tony, as he was, in soft, pretty things, things that made Tony feel soft, and vulnerable, and maybe a little doll-like, a little beautiful, a little bit a lot of things. He sighed, reached up and curled their fingers together, squeezed.  “Thanks for letting me,” he said, looking down at Steve’s hand.
“Yeah,” Tony gasped out.  “That’s it.  Touch yourself, honey.  You look so good like that.  You like that, thinking about me thinking about you, missing your mouth with my hand around myself?  Couldn’t possibly be as good as you, not in a million years.  I’d be aching for you, your hot wet mouth, your tongue, your big body all over me, beside, me, keeping me nice and warm.  You gonna think about this the next time you bring yourself off, too?”
it,” Tony corrected, and ran the backs of his fingers along Steve’s cheekbone, back into his hair, where he gripped firmly, steadyingly.  “Wanna shower together, sunshine?”
The pleasure swept over him and just washed him away.  It was like a white-out.  Steve Rogers didn’t even exist for a few seconds in there, just pleasure.  Pleasure and that beautiful peak that crashed over him like ice breaking away, like coming into the sunlight, like opening his eyes, and Tony was still fucking into him, Steve’s body rocking with each thrust, his head was lolling against the bed, mouth open and wet in the covers, and oh, oh.  His cock was jerking.  He was still coming.  Steve floated away on it again.  There was so much pleasure.  It was so good.  He was coming all over his chest and belly and the bed; he was a mess.  He didn’t care.  That just made it even better.
