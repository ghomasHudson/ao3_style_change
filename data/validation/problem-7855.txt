“I hate you all.” Clint groaned dramatically.
This could all be a disaster. Tony was reminded every day that he wasn’t a good enough omega in his old pack, so what if spending so much time with The Avengers Pack made them realise that? Made Steve realise that?
The pack was suited up for their mission within the time Steve had asked. Natasha noticed that Tony’s lab coat was no longer hanging on the coat hook and nudged Clint to let him know too. The pair gave a knowing look to one another whilst Steve wasn’t paying attention, hiding their smirks. Bruce had also noticed as they were leaving the house and the trio made a quiet discussion about what they were going to do next.
“Be back soon.” The female smiled before being dragged off by the omega.
“Who are you? What are you doing here?”
“I do have a name.”
“Okay.” Steve nodded before licking the omega’s muzzle.
“You know that might be why he’s more possessive than usual. It's not just you. You’re carrying his children, Tony. He’s extra possessive that nothing happens to any of you. His hormones have probably been affected too. There was a report on the impact on pack hormones on having pup’s in a pack a few years ago which I found interesting. In most cases, it’s not only the pregnant shifter that goes through a hormone change but every single member of the pack. I think the statistic was 96% of alphas tested have a hormone change along with their pregnant significant other and an average of 61% of other pack members.”
“Sorry. Just wondering why everyone is here… in my workshop? Can’t a guy work in peace?” The omega joked, climbing down from the stool. Coffee was the first thing on his mind right now and if he was going to finish these projects, he needed loads of it.
“About what?” The blonde sat on the bed, tilting his head whilst looking at the omega.
“It was Loki’s idea.” Thor grinned, looking at his brother.
Tony raised his menu to cover his face before looking at Steve, poking his bicep to get the blonde’s attention. The alpha looked at him, confusion on his face, he hadn’t been paying attention to the conversation. Tony adjusted Steve’s menu so it was also covering his face completely so they could have a conversation in private.
. The omega failed to hide his laughter as Nat looked at him as if the delta had just grown another head.  The omega honestly thought the delta looked like a massive twat, his drunken state not helping his grace and almost made him knock out a poor woman to which he repeatedly apologised to.
“Leave me alone,” Tony growled before turning away to walk back to Bruce.
Tony glanced at his watch. “Coming up to six.”
“I’ll have the Tikka Masala please,” Sam spoke up. Clint nodded, tapping on his phone before looking over at Bruce. Sam passed the menu to Tony, ignoring Thor and Loki.
Tony’s ramblings were cut off by the alpha. “Tony, it’s okay. I can give you a ride back to SHIELD.”
“Come find us, Stevie!” Clint laughed down the phone.
"Hey! Get Strucker and whoever was the head scientist. I know what's wrong." Tony called through the door.
Clint thought to himself.
“You came in when I had my meeting.”
“I was born in Manhattan, New York but I moved around the States a lot growing up. But my pack -my family, they live on the outskirts of Brooklyn, near Queens, which is also in New York.”
“Because the alphas were mainly on the dancefloor.” Another omega answered.
“What’s up?” The beta asked, sitting up on his elbows.
Reasoning: Thor couldn’t be anything other than an alpha. No discussion there. Also, a lion because that’s what he is in every shifter a/b/o fanfic I have read ever, and it just makes so much sense. And I have a soft toy lion called Thor. He’s just so powerful and majestic. I wanted him and Loki to be felines because they’re from Asgard and Jotunheim, different from the rest of the avengers, and different from one another.
“Top at getting us in trouble too.”
“Sorry, don’t shout, sleeping omega.” Bruce hurriedly got out in a hushed tone before Clint got a word in.
“Oops. My foot slipped, sorry Clint.” Bruce smiled innocently up at the archer.
“Don’t make me tickle you.”
This was unfamiliar territory to the brunette, he didn’t even know where they were going. Steve was very excited, his tail still had a wag as he walked through the forest, occasionally sniffing rocks and trees as he passed. The omega was desperate, wanting to know where they were going, what they were doing or at least how long it will take to get there, but each time he asked the alpha would avoid the questions.
“Acronyms. DIEGO stands for Drunk Intellectual Eccentric Genius Overlord. BRIE is Best Robotic Invention Ever. TIA is Tony Is Awesome. WIM is Whiskey Is Magical and Steve Jr is after you because I missed you and they are our babies now.” Tony grinned up at the alpha, petting TIA as the blonde sat on the bed.
Being around Tony had made the delta a lot smoother and sassier. At least he didn’t direct it at Steve that much, instead of using it to stick up for the alpha against the three amigos; Bucky, Sam and Clint.
“It’s a glove, you put it on your hand.”
The omega climbed out of bed, keeping the duvet wrapped around him, because why the hell not, and made his way to the door. The whole way there he muttered “should have said ten” over until opening it to face the other wolf, scowling.
“How much was mine?” Steve asked, taking out his wallet.
Natasha’s mouth was moving but Tony wasn’t focusing on her, his eyes were on Steve. The alpha was so stressed, checking the omega over before bringing him in for a hug, keeping the brunette close to his chest.
I adore Thor so much. He's just there being all precious.
“Why?”
“Why don’t you move in?” The alpha asked, running a hand through the omega’s soft hair.
Tony woke up, one of Steve’s arms draped over him as the alpha slept. Tony sat up carefully, minding the blonde’s arm, and looked around. No one else was around and the sun that was covering them had moved, leaving them in the shade. Tony shivered a little as the wind picked up. It was warm in the sunshine but now it was pretty chilly.
“You were literally gushing about how attractive he is the other day in the kitchen.” Steve’s ears twitched at Clint’s statement. “I’ll take it as a compliment.”
“Access denied.”
“I can’t believe you convinced me to let you pack the champagne.”
A beep stirred the alpha from his thoughts, looking over to the van that Bucky was just climbing into. The front passenger door was still open, waiting for him. Steve didn’t waste any more time and ran over to the vehicle, climbing inside next to Natasha.
“Hey!” Sam frowned, turning to Clint before shoving him.
“No JARVIS, to Paris.”
“Everyone okay?” Bruce’s worried voice called over the comm. The pack all responded. All of them had gotten out safely. “Steve?”
“You can understand him?”
Huffing whilst sitting up and sending a glare over at the door where the knocking had subsided, he called back, voice scratchy from sleep.
“And ask him if he wanted him to do a flip.” Clint began to laugh “he’s so whipped it’s crazy.”
Thank you to everyone reading, commenting and leaving kudos. It means so much to me.
Tony tried to ignore the pack being with him at all times, but it was starting to get on his nerves a little. The next day was a little worse than Steve constantly helping him with little things.
“Are you okay? Do you want to come in for some breakfast?” The blonde asked, making the omega look up but not directly at the alpha.
Tony and Pepper went for lunch at a nearby sushi bar. Pepper had overhead a few agents talking about the place and had suggested it to her fellow omega. Although Tony’s favourite wasn’t fish, he didn’t mind it and thought it would be nice to try it with his friend.
“Because he eats all the cookies,” Sam replied.
Steve Rogers: Alpha Wolf
“You have a mate?” Steve looked down at Peter, who was looking up with him with wonder.
Rhodey let out a laugh but allowed himself to be pulled by the omega, Tyler following them too. The three of them dancing in what seemed to be a dining room, which had been mainly cleared out so a DJ could be set up and people could dance. Tony swayed to the music, taking occasional sips from his bottle, smiling over at Rhodey and Tyler. The omega went up to request a song, before re-joining Rhodey on the make-shift dancefloor.
“I’ll have to speak to him when I get back home.” Tony looked at the delta. “Fancy walking me back. We can catch up.”
They both turned, going to leave the room. Tony sat up fast, throwing two small electric discs at the guards. Both guards passed out from the electric shock, their guns dropping from their grip. Tony smirked at Pietro, standing up before walking over to the guards.
Also, I'm giving a warning now because in this chapter there is going to be a short sexual harassment scene. I've marked the beginning and end with // if anyone doesn't want to read it.
“Hawkeye? Falcon?” Steve called for the two on the comms.
“Where?” Steve asked, following the beta into the house and down the stairs to a basement with a shut door. Pietro was standing outside.
“Hey. You need to calm down.”
“Too long. I just want to give him a kiss. Make sure he is okay.”
Reasoning: I had originally planned for Dr Strange to be in book two only and to hint at him in book one. But I decided to squeeze him in the last chapter of book one, instead of a random doctor. It’s changed a tiny bit of the story, but nothing major. Steve will also become very jealous of Dr Strange too. I honestly don’t know why he has this coat colour, I just liked this picture of the wolf.
The drinks kept on coming and the omega was sure he was ten times more drunk than last night in half the time. But two more people were buying him drinks. He had gotten up to dance with Clint god knows how long ago and he was having the time of his life. The older wolf stumbled over to the table, looking over at the redhead with a cheeky grin.
Rhodey continued to tell everyone very embarrassing stories of their shenanigans whilst growing up, causing the omega to groan and hide into Steve’s side. Everyone was laughing and even sharing their own stories and taking turns to go to the bar to get drinks and even though Tony said he wouldn’t be getting drunk tonight, he was feeling slightly tipsy. Soon enough, Rhodey claimed it a night and that he’ll call Tony in the morning whilst they hugged and exchanged numbers as their current ones were wrong. Thor was having a conversation with Tyler; the younger alpha had never met a feline shifter before and was asking about the lion and his brother. The rest of the pack continued to talk amongst themselves, mainly inside jokes that Tony didn’t understand, his head resting on Steve’s shoulder as his fingers traced over the star again.
Bruce stared up at the ceiling, piecing together the information. His pack was here last night. Steve had wondered off right before their mission and Bucky had gone to find him. Neither had said anything when they returned. Bruce had left early this morning, so it was likely Bucky had filled in the others on this piece of information and he had missed it from him. But Tony had seen Steve and was interested in him too. Tony should know that Steve was his alpha.
“You’re so weird. No wonder you’re friends with Steve.” Tony smiled at the brunette as they came to a stop.
“Is everything okay?” The omega lifted his head towards the voice. Dr Strange walked over, stopping beside Tony. “Mr Stark.”
“But we can move out, right?” Clint asked, everyone’s heads turning to face Steve’s.
“I wouldn’t dream of it.” The alpha sipped his drink. “HYDRA, on the other hand, that’s much more of their area of expertise.”
Steve laughed, shaking his head. “We’re almost there now.”
The blonde turned to where the scent was coming from, following it. Getting closer he could hear sniffles.
“He was protecting you, Tony. I know he was.” Pepper sighed as Tony turned to look up at the strawberry-blonde. “He always asked me to give you more work when they would visit so they wouldn’t be able to meet you. Most of those people were greedy and disgusting alphas... You should have heard the way they talked to me and then about me when they thought I wasn’t listening. Howard didn’t want that happening to you. I know he didn’t show it in a normal way, but he did love and care for you, Tony. A lot. He just didn’t know how to express it properly.”
I hope you enjoy.
“You are what you eat,” Tony smirked. “So that’s one massive dick.”
“You got your head stuck under a toilet door?” Steve turned to face Tony. “How?”
“The pack is waiting for you. The mission. Remember?” Bucky spoke, glancing over at the omega before raising his eyebrows at the blonde.
“Bruce we should go out and celebrate! You’ve been working on this for so long, come on Brucie-bear.” Tony exclaimed, taking off his lab coat and throwing it onto the worktop. The delta had come accustomed to Tony’s variety of nicknames very quickly, learning that the omega would give them to almost anyone and everything. But only the people he liked got the nice ones.
Steve’s eyes opened, not expecting the question. “I’m sorry?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Hey.” Tony gave a small smile, rolling his shoulders before giving a small wave. The male glared at Tony, shuffling to cover his sister. “I’m not going to hurt you.”
“Oh, great. Ask the alpha if it’s okay why don’t you?”
“Shut up.”
“Where are you?” The blonde climbed out of bed, putting the phone on speaker before slipping on a plain tee, jumper and some joggers.
“You do?” Steve smiled wide, eyes lit up. No doubt if he had his tail it would be wagging like crazy.
Tony left the room, going downstairs and into the kitchen. It was only a few hours until dinner time, so the omega decided to make himself a sandwich. Tony sat at the island table, eating his sandwich whilst watching Netflix on his phone.
“You will come over.”
“I really can’t dance.”
“I noticed the scent of an omega, but Steve hasn’t acted this way before. Plus, wouldn’t Thor be acting strangely?” Bucky asked, Sam, nodding along with him.
Also, I've actually been working on other stevetony fanfic ideas because I am a mess who likes to cause myself unnecessary trouble, so that's why it's a bit later than what I planned (along with my uni work and stuff going on at home woo)
“I am completely innocent, Bruce. I have no idea what you’re on about.” Clint grinned, sitting down at Tony’s feet.
The doctor only rolled his eyes in response, handing over an envelope with the ultrasound scan inside. Tony took it with a small smile before heading to the door.
“I know.” The omega grinned. “You know you’re going to have to watch your coffee intake too?”
“I promised I would spend the day with Clint.” The scientist frowned. “Could he come along too? I think you’d get along really well.”
“Right. That makes sense. Show me the way.” Tony replied, stepping out of the room, closing the door behind him as the human began to walk up the hallway.
“Voice activation required,” JARVIS repeated, the pad flashing brighter. The pack all looked towards Bruce who just shrugged a little before looking at Clint. The scientist had no part in making this.
“I have to go, but we can arrange to meet up later in the week, yes?” The redhead spoke as she stood, dropping a few notes onto the bench. “It was nice to meet you, Brooke, I hope you can convince him to see Steve again. Tammi, I’m sorry we didn’t get to talk.”
“Not Peggy?” Sam asked.
“That’s not fair! You’re biased!” The archer threw his hands in the air but climbed into the back nevertheless.
Tony was confused at first until realisation hit him. “Oh, your alpha.”
“I’m right here you guys.” Tony cut in before this could get any further.
No one spoke as the two deltas sat back in their seats, Natasha and Thor both finished serving before sitting down too. Steve turned to face Tony, eyes softening as if he had never used his alpha voice moments ago.
“Sure, I could get something to eat. Good thing you’re here or else I probably would have forgotten until I had to leave and get back home to my pack.” Bruce nodded, taking off his safety goggles.
“Hey,” Tony muttered. “Ever tried getting out of here?”
“I- Just think about it... please?” Steve pleaded, looking at Tony with puppy-eyes. “Even just as a trial to see if you would like it. I’ve wanted to ask you for a little while, but I didn’t want it to be so soon, but I didn’t want it to wait too long either. I don’t want us to get too far in a relationship and realise you don’t like being in my pack.”
“I must not tell lies.”
“The waitress is waiting for your order.” Pepper sighed.
Tony laid down in front of Steve, his back to the alpha’s chest as one of Steve’s arms wrapped around his waist. Steve nuzzled into the omega’s hair as their legs entwined and let out a short, happy hum to be cuddling Tony, his eyes closing. The two of them remained cuddling in silence for a little while.
(the previous picture got taken down but I like this one)
“But the human-shifter omega needed an alpha so they could shift and follow orders. At first, they were responding to the alphas here. Now they’re not and the scientists didn’t know why. Until now.”
Tony nodded. “Ready to go?”
Don’t get Tony wrong, he loves his pack, he loves Steve. But he also loves his own space. And while all of this overprotectiveness was very sweet of them, it was starting to annoy the omega.
Bruce had guessed that his pack had treated him badly before although he never mentioned it. He knew omegas got treated badly and used a lot for sex by alphas and male omegas got a lot of slander for being a “weak” male. He didn’t want his friend getting upset now.
“I’ve seen you before.” Tony sat up, thankful he was in a shirt and boxers.
“Hey.” Clint’s eyes narrowed, looking at Tyler. “I know you… Wait you tried to get it on with Tony when he told you no!” The archer stood up from his spot, Natasha doing the same beside him, ready to launch over the table. Steve and Rhodey let out growls, glaring at Tyler, preparing to fight off the young alpha.
“I hope they have more food in there,” Clint mumbled, looking down at his half-eaten sandwich. “If not we’re gonna need to go shopping.”
Tony nodded. Heading to bed sounded wonderful now. He ate two double cheeseburgers on the way back to the house and he was full. Tony headed up to the top floor, the bots beeping as they trailed behind him.
Four of the bags and drinks went to Bruce, who was now in the living space. He thanked the two of them and began putting the snacks away as Bucky and Clint went back to their room. Steve was fast asleep on the sofa when they returned. Bucky knew the alpha hadn’t been sleeping properly so he was thankful the blonde was getting some rest. He left Clint to start putting things away while he went to check on Sam, who was also sleeping. He smiled at his boyfriend, shutting the bedroom door as quietly as possible before going back to helping Clint, rolling his eyes at the archer who was stuffing his face with Cheetos.
“I just wanted to warn you.” Steve stood up again before pressing on his comms. “Tony, I have something important. I’ll be back at the quinjet soon.”
“I had to find you. I wanted to come back two years ago. Straight after I found out the news. But I wasn’t allowed to go for another two years until we were coming back.” Rhodey pulled back from the hug, looking over his best friend. “When I returned and found out you were no longer in your pack, I had to get to you, to make sure you were okay. No matter how much I want to kill that asshole.” Asshole being Obadiah.
“I’ve been catching up on sleep.” The archer shrugged with a grin. It wasn’t a surprise, whenever any of the pack got sent out on a late-night emergency mission, they slept a lot in the day.
“I was going to let our guest choose.” Loki looked up from his book and over to Tony.
The drive to SHIELD HQ was silent and felt much longer than usual. The whole pack desperate to find their omega. Clint parked up at SHIELD HQ, Steve getting out as soon as the van stopped. The pack followed their alpha as the blonde ran towards the doors to SHIELD. Steve groaned upon running into someone just as he was about to run through the doors.
“I’m glad I’m leaving now.” Thor was notorious for karaoke and would end up dragging everyone up there to do it with him.
Pepper’s heart sank, panic rising as she stood from her desk “I’ll be right there.”
Steve sighed, leaving the building, looking at his other teammates. Sam, Wanda, Loki and Thor were putting out fires. Natasha and Bruce, bless their souls, were checking every person on the ground and covering them up in preparation for SHIELD to get here. Bucky, Clint and Pietro were searching for people.
The omega didn’t respond straight away but soon took in the question. “Yeah, just a little shocked. It’s a lot to take in.” Tony put on his fake smile as if everything was fine.
Bruce thought, keeping himself calm.
The archer had caught the attention of a few other pack mates. Bucky and Sam had poked their heads out from the living room to give a wave and a hello. Bruce could hear the tv on, they were most likely watching a movie together. The pair were close, though they often showed it in a funny way. The scientist wasn’t sure if the pair was anything more than friends, but it wasn’t his place to try and find out. Just as Clint left to go outside, Steve had made is way over, having come from the kitchen and sniffed around his packmate.
“Please Pepper” Tony pouted although the redhead wouldn’t be able to see, as they were on call. “Everyone else is coming. Rhodey, Tammi, Brooke and Tyler.”
“See! From an actual alpha. He let Tony stay at his too last night and cuddled him because this alpha is clearly attracted in him too. They cuddled.”
“Honey, this is nothing.” Tony grinned, holding out a hand for Rhodey to take. “Let's dance.”
Tony was snooping, again, and came across how often SHIELD HQs are attacked by rivals, specifically Hydra and how that can put innocent lives at risk. So right now, he was working on the plans to make a mobile HQ that can be airborne. He was going to pitch the idea later, along with the idea of having more than one mobile HQ in the future.
“He lied to me, Clint.”
Everyone got to work, but Steve stood just looking at the village for a moment.
“Widow?” Steve called for the beta.
“Tony!” Steve heard Clint shout from the hallway.
“I’ll see you soon, Peggy.” The male alpha nodded and watched as she walked away before turning to his packmates, waiting for Clint’s onslaught.
“Come on, let’s get you all back home.”
“When is he coming?” Pepper asked.
Tony opened his eyes, scanning around the darkroom. His wolf eyesight made it easier to pick things out as he sat up. The omega felt the bed shift, making him turn to look at Steve as he rolled onto his back. Tony grabbed his phone which had been placed on the nightstand, checking the time which read 3:18 am. Tony stretched his arms above his head before looking over at his boxes and bag that had been placed over by a chest of draws.
“It’s urgent. We need to know.” Steve leant on the counter. “I’m his mate, you have to tell me.”
Tony only nodded in response, not trusting his voice, Bruce leading the two of them out of the workshop and to Tony’s room for one last time. Bruce set to work getting the two of them a coffee each whilst Tony sat at the sofa, staring at the wall while his thoughts spiralled.
Tony had invited Tammi, Brooke, Rhodey, Tyler and Pepper to come over for dinner tonight. They would probably have pizza and watch a movie or something, Tony hadn’t planned that much. He will confirm with them tomorrow, but everyone was pretty laid back and even though Pepper acted like she was only thinking about coming, Tony knew the redhead would.
“Shit,” Tony muttered out loud to himself. He drifted off. He fell asleep when he said he wouldn’t do. His memory was hazy, and it felt that the more he tried to remember, the more he forgot. The omega looked around the room, looking for any clues to where he was. Spotting a small note on the bedside table, leaning on a lamp, he made his way over to it and picked it up, reading it over.
It was only a whisper, but Tony caught it and didn’t know how to respond. His cheeks turned red as he nuzzled into the alpha who he had grown so fond of recently.
“Uh, yeah, J. Thank you,” Tony said, moving his arms out from behind him, his watch having a gold type hologram above it. “And impeccable timing as usual.”
“You made this for me?” The beta looked up at Tony.
“Yes. But I was bored. I was just doing paperwork.”
“Rumlow has Tony, we have to let them go.”
“Tell me about it.” Tony let out a sigh, going over to the bed, lying down on it with a groan.
This was the longest though, and Steve had allowed Tony to have a few friends over to keep him company, also to ‘make sure he eats and sleeps’ whilst the pack was gone. The omega had begged to let him come along, even if it was just to stay behind at wherever they were sleeping, but he wasn’t allowed. Therefore, the omega was being petty and has pushed back the dates of his projects, not giving a damn about what the director will think when he finds out. Tony had been left behind, and he was angry at that, and probably wasn’t handling it in the best way.
“That can’t be comfortable.” Bucky pointed to the alpha.
Peggy Carter: Alpha Wolf
“Tony, I know you’re worried. You don’t have to move in if it’s too much for you.” Bruce sighed, looking around the room. Tony had a few boxes packed with his items in, though nothing much.
“Tony.” Pepper gave Tony a disproving look. “That’s going to make them worse.”
Tony turned to Steve who was watching from the back door. The omega wagged his tail before walking into the woods, taking in the scents from the pack that had come through here earlier on today. The omega carried on walking, deep in the woods but remaining on pack territory. He reached the lake that he once went to with the pack, wagging his tail at the happy memories.
Steve recently discovered that Tony would sleep talk if he was working on something big, most likely to do with stress. Steve frowned, as far as he was aware Tony had given in his latest project to Peggy a few days ago, and The Director had been pleased with it. The omega would only have been working on projects for the pack, which wasn’t anything to stress about. Steve kissed Tony’s forehead, smiling down at the omega as he slept, sitting with him for another hour before going for his morning run just before Tony would usually wake up and breakfast started.
and he hates it so much.” Clint looked over to the beta who had overheard the conversation, turning to glare back at him. “Steve is Marshmallow, Loki is Snowflake and Nat is Muffin.”
Tony turned, glaring at the archer, causing him to gulp, taking a step back as the omega stepped closer. As if from nowhere, Tony pulled out a small dagger, pointing it up to the delta as he spoke.
“Everything will be alright.” The alpha smiled, taking Tony’s hand as he helped the omega the rest of the way, where the quinjet was waiting for them both.
“Can you help me find my aunt and uncle?” The boy was more interested now, uncurling from his ball. “Aunt May asked me to hide down here until she and Uncle Ben got back but they didn’t come back.”
“How did you know that?” Stephen asked.
I have put // warnings too for a bit about Tony's past. It's only short, but I don't want anyone to be triggered by it.
“So, SHIELD, right?” Tony asked, not addressing his lateness as he stepped into the room. One glance around the room was all it took before making his way over to the desk and plopping himself down on one of the lavish leather chairs in front of the oak desk without being directed to. “Who are you, why am I here, and what do you want with me?”
“This guy came out their room to yell at me and Rhodey was apologising loads whilst holding in his laughter as I drunkenly and very badly back-chatted his dude. The guy took one look at me naked before rolling his eyes and slamming the door. We eventually got back to our dorm and then I started crying on the floor. Rhodey kept asking me why I was crying as it came out of nowhere and I eventually told him it was because hamburgers must be sad and feeling left out as they don’t have cheese on them before passing flat out.”
“Steve?” The redhead repeated, confused.
“I am unable to track his whereabouts. His last known location was in SHIELD Medical. He had arranged an Uber to pick him up and bring him home.”
“But Tony-” Clint was cut off.
“Yeah of course.” Bruce grinned with a knowing glance, finishing off the lasagne. “Now if you’ve finished harassing me about your new love interest, who happens to be my friend, I’m going to go.”
“Of course, Sir.” JARVIS never questioned Tony, something the omega was grateful for.
“You okay?” Steve whispered.
“So… you like him then?” Steve asked, leaning closer. “This omega?”
“I have nothing to say to you.” Tony didn’t move from his place. Stane was at the far end of the table, a business smile spread across his face.
, Tony thought to himself.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Tyler. Just a friend.” The two alphas shook hands. A short uncomfortable silence formed before Tony decided to break it, spinning around on his stool to face Steve.
“Well, I’m a little tired. Want to go cuddle at least?” Steve looked hopeful, knowing that Tony loved to cuddle when drunk, and so the omega nodded.
He didn’t know how much the omega usually drank, but it was a lot last night. He was very drunk last night, his words occasionally slurred and he did talk a lot. But Bruce wondered if this was only the tip of the iceberg. Maybe he would be able to talk to the omega about it at some point.
“I left it blank so I could customise it for you, whatever you want,” Tony said almost a whisper as Bucky continued to stare at the arm.
“Tony left SHIELD earlier and hasn’t come back home.”
ed Tony lasted for another week. He was surprised he lasted this long. All he wanted to do was work on some projects again. But he wasn’t able to go back to SHIELD HQ again and at least one member of the pack, mainly Steve, was with him at all times. They were smothering him. He hasn’t even been able to see any of his friends since coming back. So, if Tony was sneaking out of the house, thanks to help from JARVIS, at 2 am then no one else had to know.
“Just spending time with you.” Steve smiled, turning to face the omega.
“I used to think I could pull anything off. This is a no.” Tony smiled at her, deciding that he liked Fire a lot.
“We got back to SHIELD twenty-minutes ago, had a debriefing and came straight here afterwards. We tend to do so after a group mission.” Steve cupped the omega’s jaw. “I was going to text you actually, but then Bucky pointed you out… I looked over and there you were.”
Steve and Tony seriously want to kick names and take ass.
“Well, yes. We call them mates. We bonded.” Tony pointed to the bond mark on his neck. “When some shifters find a mate, they bond. These bonds, they tend to last for life, only in extreme circumstances they break. Or if one dies.” Tony paused, hoping the siblings weren’t too confused before continuing. “I guess it’s like being married in human terms? But much more extreme. We can feel one another’s emotions, their pain and things like that. But my bond with my mate didn't compete, so it isn’t very strong. So, I cannot communicate with my alpha. It’s very common with wolf shifters to find a mate for life."
“Of course. You’re your own person. I can’t force you to stay. Just be careful.”
Tony laughed and nodded. “I remember one time I had an in-depth conversation with some guy about how many chickens it would take to kill an elephant.”
“Hey, I don’t regret that. I knew what I was doing. I was showing team spirit.” Tony pointed a finger at the laughing alpha.
“O-oh okay.” Tony nodded again.
“A-and you like him, yes? A lot.”
As promised, a HYDRA henchman came to collect Tony, giving Fire her meal of what Tony could only describe as pure slush. The omega had no idea why he was going to this meal or who he was going to meet.
“So I’ve been told.” The omega smirked, drinking some of the water before putting it down. “Can you get me a shirt?... And then cuddles.”
“What?” The alpha whispered.
“I was almost killed by random shifters at the request of a previous pack member who became head alpha after my boss and alpha died. Of course I needed therapy.”
Steve scrunched up his nose as he looked around, spotting a staircase, heading over to it. He carefully climbed the stairs, spotting Loki standing in a doorway, waving the alpha over. Steve hurried over, stepping around the beta to get into the room. Bucky stood up from the bodies.
“Don’t panic then?”
Steve nodded. “Alright, you two continue the search, SHIELD will be here soon. I’ll see if I can get in.”
“I believed it was best not to wake him.” Steve’s head turned towards the voice. Loki was standing there, mug in his hand.
“I’m fine. Why wouldn’t I be?” Steve shrugged as he gave the pasta another stir.
“If you need anything else, just ask.” She added before leaving the table.
“What’s he like? Your mate?”
Tony gave a soft smile. “Okay, you can take me to lunch.” The blonde smiled wide, leaning in to kiss the omega softly.
Tyler: Alpha Wolf
Last night both of them came come smelling of omega, which wasn’t uncommon if they were sent on an omega rescue mission, but this was different. The smell of this omega was something else to Steve. It wasn’t very strong, it would have faded after dropping off the omega and their scents would have begun to take over, but he could smell it as soon as they stepped through the door. The alpha had come across quite a few omegas because of SHIELD but none sparked his interest. That was until last night, when the two-pack members returned home in the early hours of the morning, around 3 am. Steve stayed awake after sending the pair out, just in case they needed him for whatever reason. He knew that they wouldn’t, they were professionals after all and it was always risky sending out an alpha on an omega rescue mission. As soon as they walked through the door the alpha wolf got a strong whiff of a sweet-smelling omega and rushed over to them, sniffing around them. It wasn’t unusual for an alpha wolf to react to an omega wolf’s scent in such a way, but Steve had never been so intrigued by a scent before. This was something new, something different and exciting and he needed to know more. The agents just shrugged it off, this wasn’t the first time Steve had sniffed around him after helping an omega, but he did hang around longer than usual.
“Okay. I’ll think about it.” The omega gave a soft smile. Steve only smiled in reply.
“You just eat so much. I can understand Steve and Thor, they’re alphas. But you, you have a stomach of an alpha. It’s like a black hole in there.” The beta nudged the archer playfully as they walked along the pathway. “We should call NASA.”
Reasoning: I chose Tony to be an omega because I just love it when Tony is protected and shown all the love he deserves. I also wanted Tony’s past to be rough and had been used but could be shown that just because he is an omega, he can be looked after and loved. Although Tony isn’t a standard omega, he only acts like a true omega (caring, submissive, etc.) when he’s around the ones he loves, otherwise, he is very defensive. I fell in love with this wolf picture and thought the coat was so pretty I just had to give it to Tony. I wanted his fur to be brown, but not solid brown, hence why I added the black and white too.
“Alphas.” Tony shrugged.
Everything will be fine.
“Of course I’m going to worry about it Tony, you can tell me anything.” The alpha shifted, moving back from Tony so the omega could roll onto his back, letting the blonde look down at him.
“Went to get us a beer,” Rhodey replied, leaning in close to Tony so he could hear.
“Hi, I’m here to see if I can book an appointment as soon as possible please,” Tony said and the receptionist nodded in response. Tony have his details so the appointment could be booked, Suzie kept her eyes on the screen, manicured nails typing now and then.
“Sorry, Tyler was just saying goodbye,” Tony said, pulling his jacket tighter around him. Even though it was spring, the wind still had a chill to it at night.
“Still trying and failing, by the way, to lie to me.” Pepper gave the male an eye roll, leading him down the hall and towards an elevator. Tony had no idea quite how much he missed his friend until now.
Just to let you know, I am in no way defending any type of sexual harassment. Most people who have read fics with shifter's or A/B/O dynamics know that in most cases a heat/rut makes the person unable to think properly. I am not defending Brooke's brother's actions, but his animalistic side was in control there. He will be making another appearance and he isn't a bad person.
“Your scent gives it away.”
“Steve?” The alpha looked up at Peggy.
"I'm sorry but you really do look unwell. But of course, I can look after DIEGO.” The delta replied, looking over at the bot. “You shouldn’t have come in today.”
“But you refused?” Steve asked, Tony only nodding in reply. “Can I ask what it was?”
Steve smiled softly at Tony’s blush.
“Hey, tomorrow is Friday, right? We can go out then. At least I can tell my pack beforehand… plus I know you like a drink and it’s 2 for 1 night.” Bruce offered, hoping to cheer the male up.
The brunette took a deep breath. “I’ll be fine. I just hate it here so much, we need to get out of here.”
“Some kids I have now claimed as my own.” Tony shrugged, walking down the hallway. “Cheeseburger is our check-in word.”
College!AU friends with benefits (that's still the same)
“But the human-shifter alphas all failed?” Tony recalled.
The beta wolf stared at his alpha, who’s declaration of love came out of nowhere. They had been training for their next mission in the gym and had just walked up the stairs to get to the main floor.
“You were gone for so long, without barely a trace. And to find out you were pregnant too.” Tony could hear the hurt in the alpha’s voice as he sat on the bed.
“Brucie!” Clint had been the one to break the fellow beta out of his train of thoughts about his day with Tony. He was standing at the top of the stairs, his quiver on his back indicating that he had been or was going to do some training, before hurriedly running down. “How come you’re back so late?”
“One Strongbow, one Budweiser and” Tyler looked at Tony who nodded “and a scotch on the rocks please.”
“Shut it, Buckaroo.”
“Shh!” Bruce raised a finger to his lips, just as Clint was about to open his mouth, the other hand reaching out in front of him to give a stop sign. “He wanted to cuddle, and I couldn’t say no.” Bruce shrugged, looking at Tony before looking at his packmates, noticing Natasha taking a picture.
Fur colour: Grey on top, white on the bottom
“You’d think he’d learn after catching several members of the pack in some memorable situations.”
“We should get downstairs,” Steve whispered after pulling back only inches from Tony’s lips. “Sam’s making a fry-up for breakfast. I’ll be good.”
He was cut off before he could reply.
Fur colour: Dark brown (solid)
Time for some texts and Tony bonding with his friends while Steve is trolled with his.
Steve smiled gratefully at Natasha. She could be just as much as a teasing pain as his three packmates in the hall, but she knew when to give it a rest.
“I know that’s a lie -what the hell are they?” Rhodey asked, moving around Tony to walk into the workshop. The bots made high-pitched beeping noises as the flew over and swarmed around Rhodey, clearly excited by their new guest.
“You are a good omega. You were standing up for yourself. Fighting wouldn’t have been the best bet here though.”
The omega couldn’t go around the tree, as the root end has a vertical drop and the top was far ahead and he would have to get around the leaves. He would probably end up losing Steve and getting lost and potentially attacked. Tony let out a whine, taking a few steps back before spotting a small gap underneath the tree trunk.
Tony nodded. “I know that. I’m going to. I just don’t want him to hate me. There’s something between us. I know there is.”
“Tony, what do you want to drink?” Bruce called, poking his head in the room.
“Really?”
He didn’t know how Nat and Clint could do stuff like this, worse stuff, all the time. This was just a lab coat.
“We want you, Stevie!” That was Natasha.
“Of course not.” Steve kissed the omega’s head “this is your house too. You’re welcome to stay and finish your work.”
Steve leant down and kissed the top of the brunette’s head, giving his hip a gentle squeeze. “I’ll remember that one.”
“Or I could tell him, and he gets scared and wants to move out and then never sees me ever again.”
“Okay, half six, everyone better be outside.”
“Strange? He could have practically humped us!” Clint exclaimed.
“Thanks, Bruce. You sap.” Tony laughed, taking a sip from his mug. “No! No tickling!”
“Oh, Tony.” The female omega was right down on the floor beside him in a heartbeat, her arm wrapping around the brunette gently. “Can you remember our breathing?”
“Thank you.” Bruce ended the call, sounding thankful.
“I had no idea what to do, I had to get rid of these feelings. I couldn’t fall in love with an alpha… what if I was mistreated again? I drove myself crazy, but I just couldn’t push the feelings away no matter how hard I wanted to. But then a friend reminded me that I deserve to be happy.” She smiled at Tony, his mind automatically going to Pepper.
Delta.
“I’m fine, Thor. I can do this all day.” The wolf shrugged.
“You and your friend really thought you could get out of here?” The alpha smirked as a guard came up to him with a catcher pole, putting it around Tony’s neck, causing the omega to growl.
“Just to get you a lot to stop arguing over the number of candles that should have been on it.”
“Are you okay, Tony?” Bruce sighed, taking off his goggles and looking over at the mechanic who was had stopped in the middle of the room, wench in his hand.
“Noooo.”
The door opened, Tony looking up at the smiling blonde alpha who opened it. Steve pulled the omega inside his room, hands-on Tony’s waist and before Tony could even say another word, Steve began to kiss up the brunette’s neck to his jaw.
He didn’t have many items to move in. Of course, he had his clothes, both old and new, and a few personal items that he had with him when he was abandoned that day, but that was all. No furniture of the sort, so packing was easy.
Bruce let out another laugh, giving a wave as he went through the doors that lead to the stairs. The delta was thankful that Tony didn’t comment on the lab coat because he really couldn’t lie to save his life, no matter how many times Natasha had practised with him. Bruce fumbled around for his keys as he went down the steps, nodding to another scientist as they walked up. He kept the lab coat tucked under his arm as he left the stairs, waving to the receptionist as he passed her and out of the glass doors. The scientist let out a breath he didn’t know he was holding in, stopping briefly before going to his car to take the thirty-minute ride back home.
“Please. I need this.” Tony begged, going up on his tiptoes so he could lean over the desk, trying to peer at the computer screen. "I'm desperate."
“Ooo, don’t you win the prize of coolness.” Sam rolled his eyes before imitating the beta’s voice. “Look at me I’m Robo-Cop.”
“I want you to tell me why you’re here.”
“Why do you have it?” Steve asked, walking over to it.
“We could smell omega in there and Steve literally short-circuited. The idiot thought he could be subtle.” Clint sat up, looking at Natasha then Bruce.
“I’ve been dealing with HYDRA for a long time, Tony.” Obadiah looked down at his drink before looking back at the omega. “Keep your friends rich and your enemies rich and wait to find out which is which.”
“I am many things, but I am not dumb.”
“You, um, didn’t mention your mum. Can I ask about that or is it too much?”
“We rescued a male omega last night for SHIELD… I think he could be the same one because he was strange with us last night, and when we went in your lap earlier.” The redhead was in thought.
The two wolves headed down to the village, joining the rest of their pack in the search.
“Twenty missed calls and sixty text messages, Tony.”
“Hey! Get off me!” Tony struggled against the grip, looking up to who had grabbed him. It was a male alpha who he noticed being from the pack that he had taken a cigarette from.
Steve had never been so thankful for the redhead in his life. Sam and Clint let out a whine of frustration but obeyed to the higher-ranking wolf and walked into the connecting dining room. Bucky didn’t listen at first and Natasha gave him a hard stare that soon caused him to follow both deltas. Natasha gave a knowing look at Steve before going into the dining room too.
“Everyone, these are my bots. TIA, WIM, DIEGO, BRIE and” Tony gently took hold of Steve Jr, turning to Steve. “Steve Jr.”
“Guys, not the time.” Steve sighed.
“Oh yeah, I haven’t had a chance to dye my hair.”
“We should probably go before I’m late.”
“Steve… His name is Steve.” Tony smiled, thinking about the beautiful blonde alpha.
“I can’t lose him, Buck. I can’t.” The blonde looked up to his life-long friend. “We’ve lost so much already. He’s just become my mate. I just can’t handle losing him.”
“Is everything okay?” Steve asked as he walked outside, stopping in his tracks as Tony and Bucky turned to face him. The beta ran over to Steve, bouncing around him as the other’s joined them outside.
“This is great news! We need to get him to come over, meet the pack. Maybe for dinner?” The archer was grinning, getting excited. Bruce had to remind him to keep it down.
“I always hated that saying.”
“I want to come on a mission.”
“Hey,” Tony replied, leaning back into Steve he let out a soft hum just as Rhodey turned around to face them, about to launch himself at the alpha that had just arrived.
“It was merely a suggestion.” The feline shifter smirked over at Bruce.
Reasoning: Adding in deltas was a last-minute decision. I just wanted to break up the pack rankings a bit more. I didn’t want too many alphas or deltas, and I wanted different characters to be on different levels of rankings. Deltas are basically a lower-ranking beta. I wanted Clint to be lower down than Natasha and Bucky, but without making them alphas or him an omega, hence why I added deltas. I thought about adding gammas too (lower than deltas, higher than omegas) but I went off it in the end. I honestly don’t know why I chose this coat for Clint, I just really loved the wolf and I was like “Clint, there you go”.
“From what? Having a shit?”
“I kind of want to watch The Lord of The Rings.”
“But I know there’s something wrong. Because I wouldn’t be here still.” The man raised an eyebrow, Tony knew he was right.
“I’m Tony.” The brunette gave a smile, sniffling the female. She definitely had his DNA. They smelt so similar it was unreal.
It really wasn’t, both of them knew that. It was Obadiah Stane written all over. He manipulated Tony right from the beginning, making the omega think he was weak and undeserving of his father’s attention. That his omega status brought shame to Howard Stark and the Stark pack.
Pushing the door open, he made his way into the room, chucking the card onto the desk in the room before placing his coffee on the nightstand. He didn’t take in the room that much earlier. It was a studio apartment. The room was open-planned with a bedroom, living space and a kitchen. There was a room just left to his bed, he assumed the bathroom. The omega made his way over to the kitchen area, deciding to inspect it now he had the time. It had the basics, cooker, fridge-freezer, toaster, kettle and a small range of cupboards and draws. Agent Coulson had informed him that everything had been stocked with the basics for now, but he would need to buy anything else himself. Going over to the living area and picking up his bag from the sofa, Tony grabbed the TV remote before heading for his bed.
“Are you okay here?” Pepper asked, wondering if anything in the workshop had set him off.
“I’m getting there. Plus, in a way, things ended up working out. I got an amazing pack, and I met you.” Steve kissed Tony’s cheek. “I doubt I would have met you… and I’m so glad I did. I don’t know what I’d do without you, Tony.”
Pepper knew this was a lot for the male omega to take in. She would let him speak when he wanted to, her hands gently running through his hair in the meantime. It was a lot to put on the omega, but he couldn’t keep on with this lie and the guilt he had eating him up over events that weren’t even true. There was potentially a lot more lies that Tony was told, the things Stane and other high-ranking packmates told him to put him down and manipulate him, to claim Howard hated him because he was an omega.
“I’ll get it for you.” Steve smiled as he got up from the bed to get the omega’s band shirt that was carelessly thrown on the sofa.
“It’s different.” Pietro was the one to speak up this time, moving to sit beside his sister. “Strange to, hear everything. Smell everything.”
“Steve…” Tony sighed, looking away from the blonde.
Steve nodded and took out his phone and sent a text message to the pack’s group chat.
“We’ve only been trying to get your attention for the last half an hour.” Bucky grinned at the alpha’s blush. “Oh, we know you’re hung up on lover boy right now, carry on. You’ll be no use to the conversation anyway.”
Steve bit his lip before leaning closer so he could whisper into the brunette’s ear “maybe I could change your mind?”
“So, if you had a complete bond.” Wanda paused. “And I hit you, your mate would feel it?”
The brunette froze. He was sure he heard something. His ears twitched, adjusting in position to try to pick up on the noise. Nose sniffing to try and catch a scent. He was being watched. Tony slowly turned, eyes scanning the trees for a sign of something or someone watching him. He took a step forward, hesitantly, sniffing the air. That’s when he caught the smell.
“No, never this extreme and it’s slowly driving me crazy. My hormones are all over the place. Sometimes I want him close all the time and sometimes having him constantly over me makes me want to scream and cry.”
“Perfectly fine,” Tony replied, snapping out of his trance, the blue eyes leaving his mind again as he walked over to the bench.
“That’s Steve’s night sorted,” Natasha replied making highly inappropriate hand gestures, making the two wolves laugh even more in the backseat as the alpha and omega blushed.
Even though Pepper was only getting one-word responses, it was better than nothing. Her hand was still running through Tony’s hair gently.
The alpha checked in a few more rooms looking for any clues to try and find the omega. Nothing. Steve walked into the last room, and unlike the other rooms, it had a table inside, with a few items sitting on top.
“Steve, honey. I’m okay.” Tony leant back from the blonde who was tending to the gash on his head.
“Not for the first time.” Tony glared at the other omega. “But he invited you. Himself.” The redhead reminded him.
“Tony. I need to tell you something.” The blonde said just as the omega started cuddling up to him.
“We have Jack Daniels, is that okay?” The waitress replied and Tony nodded in response. She jotted his order down before turning to Steve who had collected himself now.
“Where’s Bruce? Is he okay?”
“Where’s Bruce?” The alpha ran a hand over his face, yawning.
“You’re going to be called TIA.” The omega smiled at the bot on his left, before looking to the one at his right. “And you DIEGO.” Tony looked up at the bot circling his head “you’re BRIE, and you over there are WIM.” He looked towards the bot flying around the workshop at full speed. “And you.” Tony looked at the bot in his hands “are Steve Jr.”
Tony nodded. “I’ve known for a while, I just didn’t want to say.” The omega snuggled back into the alpha’s side, letting out a yawn. “Now can we nap? I want one now.”
“Tony?”
“Tony!”
Steve stared down at the small, abandoned warehouse as they flew over it. The Quinjet came into land on the car park as the alpha calculated the distance to the ground in his head, deeming it safe to jump before doing so, landing in a roll before standing straight. He was pretty sure he heard Clint shout ‘show off’ as he landed the jet. The coordinates had sent them here. Tony’s last known location was here, and he had to get to his mate as soon as possible.
“What’s a quinjet?” Peter asked as they began walking again.
It had almost been three weeks since Tony had gone missing and no matter how many HYDRA bases they took down, no matter how much they searched, they hadn’t had a single lead on finding the omega and it was driving Steve crazy.
“Exactly,” Tony replied before taking a few sips. Steve offered Tony a sandwich, the omega taking it gratefully, swapping with the champagne bottle, allowing the alpha to have some.
“Daddy is back.” Tony grinned.
“Just when I miss-behaved, didn’t follow the rules or do what an omega was supposed to. They would say it was putting me in my place, as an omega, I am to submit and listen to them.” Tony swallowed, eyes watering, “they made me do things I didn’t want to, touch me when I didn’t want them too and when I tried to refuse, tried to get away, they would attack me. They were sneaky about it when my father was alive, as he was too busy working to notice, but once he was gone no one cared, I was just a disobedient omega that wouldn’t follow orders. They would use me until they were satisfied and then leave me to pick up the pieces on my own.” Tony didn't want to go into his past too much, but he felt strong enough to tell the alpha in little detail what had happened to him.
“Jeez, I thought Clint was the dramatic one.” The beta muttered under his breath, Steve chose to ignore him.
“I just think it would be good for you… Just maybe give it a shot for me?” The female omega gave a small smile.
“Steve.” Tony smiled, hugging back. “Guys, Steve is back!”
5. Martin Freeman.
“I promise you I’m fine. We all are.” Tony sighed, looking down at his mug before finishing the coffee.
“Hey, JARVIS. Can you let Steve know that I went to the lab when he wakes? Oh and that he can visit me if he wants to but I’m hoping to see Pepper later when she replies to my text.”
“I am the most fun.”
“Are you nearly done?” Pietro asked, walking over to Tony.
The other wolf walked over to him, tail wagging a little. Tony sniffed, this was Clint. Clint’s fur was grey on top and white on the bottom, much like a great white shark. That meant the dark brown wolf that was currently chasing the giant lion across the garden was Sam. Tony tilted his head slightly, Clint’s fur looked so soft and he just wanted to pet him.
All three let out whines of apology, looking sorry for themselves.
“For a genius, you’re pretty dumb.”
“It’s not strong enough. It’s only one way.” Tony let out a sigh. “I didn’t return the bond.”
“Goodnight, Tony,” Steve said, his hold on the omega tightening a little as if Tony would disappear.
“Thanks for getting it ready for me.” The delta said, placing the dish on the island table before sitting up on the bar stools.
He was just about to take out his phone to see if Steve had texted when a pair of arms wrapped around his waist from behind. Tony was about to pull away, ready to shout when the familiar scent of Steve surrounded him.
“You programmed me, Sir.”
Tony nodded and did as instructed, biting his lip as Stephen applied the gel. The alpha moved the wand across his stomach, looking around for a sign to confirm he was pregnant. It took a couple of minutes, but it was confirmed. He was pregnant. With twins.
“Hey! I am cool.” Bucky crossed his arms. “I have a metal arm.”
Tony looked up, Steve was in an alpha stance, tail up as he stood up high over the two lower-ranking wolves who were lying on the ground, ears flat and tail between their legs. The golden wolf let out another growl, the deltas rolling onto their backs, showing submission to their alpha. Steve accepted it before turning to face Tony.
The omega kept one arm around Tyler as he drank more of the rum, the bottle half empty now. It wouldn’t be long until the bottle was empty, and the omega would be shit-faced and wanting more. The song Tony had requested started to play, the omega cheering loudly before dancing. Tyler let out a laugh and danced along with him. The continued to dance through a range of songs, Rhodey soon joining them again. Tony’s bottle soon emptied, causing the omega to break away from Tyler.
Tony laughed at them, shaking off near Thor before walking up with him to join the others. The omega went around to Steve and nuzzled up against him before sitting down beside him. After eating, Tony was happy to lie with Steve for a bit and dry off as the sun began to set.
“To SHIELD Head Quarters?”
"Oh, sorry I already claimed top bunk." The redhead grinned.
“I-I’m sorry sir but I don’t know. There is no record of an appointment for Tony Stark.” She continued to scroll through the computer, trying to find what the alpha was looking for.
Tony laughed, head tilting back as he followed Tyler into the house. Tyler had been invited to a house party being thrown by a friend of a friend and suggested that the three of them went after Pepper, Tammi and Brooke left.
“Great. Thank you, Bruce. I’m glad you’re willing to break the rules for me.”
“I can’t even smell Tony’s scent,” Bucky added.
Brooke nodded, taking out her phone. She wanted to ask more questions but let it slide as the two exchanged numbers. “I’ll text you Tammi’s too. We can have a group chat!”
“Tell me about it. It was lucky your pack was there to help you out. That delta of yours packs a good punch.”
“Tony you’re not an awful omega. You’re just being irresponsible.”
Tony nodded, flicking the ends of the cigarette before taking a final drag. “Sometimes people make me nervous. Guess it’s an omega thing.” The omega put out the cigarette before putting it into the bins designed for them. “Let’s dance again, yeah?”
“I hate them all.” Steve groaned before looking at Tony who had an amused expression as he sat up.
Tony smiled, eyes closing.
“Same here, normally Rhodey would stand with me when we were in MIT together. I don’t even remember half of the conversations because I was too drunk.”
“Agent Carter, I seem to have lost my key card. You know, the one with complete access to all rooms in SHIELD headquarters. Which includes the armoury and the new top-secret quinjet hanger. The quinjet which Tony Stark helped to make and design for The Avengers.” Agent Coulson glanced over to Steve before turning his full attention to Peggy. “I think we should check your office in case it’s in there.”
“I asked nicely,” Tony smirked. Sam shifted back into his human form, laughing as he took his clothes from Clint’s bag to slip them on.
The rest of the avengers sped up, praying that Natasha and Clint were okay as they climbed to the top of the hill. Steve was horrified at the site.
“Sam, Bucky and Clint are currently on territory checks. Thor, Nat and Loki are looking after Wanda and Pietro, teaching them the ropes and stuff.”
“I wanted to.”
“Is it another gun?” The beta seemed excited.
“Of course, sir, I’ll let him know.”
“Like that’s going to happen.”
“Brooke explained. I guess we can’t help our natural urges.”
“Shh.”
“Pepper it’s Bruce. Somethings wrong with Tony you need to get to the workshop.”
Tony thought it was dumb, but he went along with it anyway. It would mean that he would be drinking, as there were very few things the omega hadn’t done.
“Damn right I am.”
“Hello?” Steve said, voice croaky from not talking.
Plopping himself down behind a large rock to rest his legs for a short while, he let out a long, soft whine as his bag slid down off his back. He knew it wasn’t a good idea to stay here for long, but he just needed a little rest… Just for five minutes…
Tony looked up as the en-suite door opened, Steve walking out with a towel wrapped around his waist his damp hair flat on his head. The omega bit his lip as he looked down at his phone, keeping his eyes fixed on the screen as three dots appeared, indicating Rhodey was typing.
“He asked me to leave it with Agent Hill, so of course she wanted to go through it right there and then. It took forever! This is why we need a new internet provider, so I don’t have to come here and have my ear chewed off by Hill!” Clint threw his hands in the air dramatically, looking away from his redhead friend and over to his alpha. “He wasn’t done with the omega we retrieved last night.” Steve caught onto the last part of Clint’s statement.
“Make me go into the kitchen where I belong? Yeah, let me just go in there and grab a knife.” Tony stood. “If it ends up in you, I’ll just blame it on my dumb, clumsy, omega-self.”
“I’m a genius.” The omega smirked.
“This is my mate and omega, Tammi.” The blonde smiled, taking the omega’s hand as they sat down.
“Dinner is fine. We have fun at dinner. I don’t know why you think it will be bad.”
“You’re on the wrong side here, Rogers.” Brock stood and did as asked, going over to the front door, Steve following behind.
“I will always worry.”
“Damn it.” Steve groaned, removing the tea towel that was on his shoulder onto the countertop beside the stove.
“But this is for my birthday and they’re over there making googly eyes at one another and not paying attention to me at all.” Tony had a pout.
“It’s just stress. Stress to get this fucking shit done.” The omega muttered to himself. “Shit.” Tony winced, pulling his hand back from the soldering iron he had just burnt himself on. “All these years and I still get burns.”
“Then leave,” Bucky spoke up, looking back at Clint.
“Promise.” Steve gently squeezed Tony’s waist as he looked over at his pack. All were watching them, and some were standing with smirks.  He wasn’t going to hear the last of this one on the ride to their mission.
“Oh I did, I just didn’t think I’d need it.” Tony gave a small shrug. “Like I said, I’ll think about it now.”
“Okay.” The boy nodded, getting up, fixing his backpack. “I’m Peter.”
Tony's mind whirled with possibilities. Had the HYDRA scientists done something differently? Were the twins not as compatible as they thought? Was it something to do with him and Fire? Other than the two of them being omegas, Tony wasn't sure what else the two shifters had in common. They were both very different. Tony's eyes widened as a thought hit him, making him stand up abruptly, heading over to the door, banging on it.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Steve.”
Tony nodded, going over to his mate and wrapping his arms around him. “Glad I had you there.”
“Hello, Steve… Is everything alright?” Bruce asked his alpha as Steve came to a halt, still close to the delta, realisation hitting him at what he was doing.
“I thought you were joking?” Clint looked up at the omega, confused.
“You were? Well, thanks. I’d probably be dead or kidnapped otherwise. Instead, I’m here and annoying Bruce every day.”
Mine is personally Captain America: Civil war.
“Clint’s allowed dinner.” Steve sighed.
alpha. He’d gone home with them last night and had gotten the alpha to cuddle with him. Tony let out a quiet whine at the idiot he was. If the earth was to open up and swallow him whole right now, he’d be eternally grateful right now.
Bruce took in Tony’s sleep-deprived state, his hair wild, bags under his eyes. The older male pulled the duvet around him as he shuffled over to the sofa before falling face-first on the sofa over the armrest, letting out a quiet groan.
“I’m Steve.” The alpha stood.
Bruce had just made it to the top of the stairs before he was dragged off to Clint’s room by Natasha. The archer was lying halfway off his bed, upside down, watching as the two made their way over.
“I hate you, you know that?”
This one (and the next) are my favourite -they were originally written together but I ended up separating them because it was going to be so long. But I'm posting the next one pretty soon after because I need them to be together.
Natasha was similar to Clint, but her fur was a reddish-brown, almost like her natural hair, instead of grey like Clint’s, and white underneath. She was also a bit bigger than the delta as most betas were. Bucky’s fur was a solid jet black, very close to Sam’s but the delta’s shone brown in the sun. Tony could tell that this was Bucky, as his front left leg was missing, where his metal arm should have been. Tony frowned, already thinking about the ways he could try and help Bucky out, so he could have his leg once more. Tony was snapped out of his thoughts when he felt a hand on his waist. The omega looked up, smiling at Steve who smiled back.
“It’s my glove.”
“You’re in the very early stages, but their heads are here.” The doctor pointed to each one. He continued to point to them, talking about the stage they were at and what would be next, Tony only able to nod in response. “Are you okay?”
“Lab!” Tony exclaimed, drawing out the vowel as he ran into the elevator and pressed the button for the first floor. “Boom time.”
“Okay fine. I’m not the most fun.” Steve let out a huff. “But I really want this to be a surprise.”
“Making out.” Tony ruffled Steve’s hair with a smirk, the alpha gaping at him as he ruffed his own.
“Right, I have a meeting to get to now and your delta is back, meaning that you will be going now. I’ll see you soon, Steve.” The dark-haired alpha smiled up at Steve, leaning in to give him a quick peck on the cheek.
Clint and Natasha made idle chatter whilst they waited, a door soon opening and a few agents stepping out before the three wolves made their way inside. The redhead pressed the button for floor one to take them to the labs. The elevator dinged as they reached the floor and Clint walked out first, scanning his badge for the door which took a small moment before beeping and the small light turning green. Pushing the door open, the delta let his two packmates walk through first into the long corridor. The trio walked down the hall to Bruce’s lab, Steve sniffing subtly. Something smelt very familiar, but it was very faint, and he knew it wasn’t Bruce, for he smelt very different from everyone he ever met. Many humans and shifters had made their way through the corridor, the scents were mixing, and it was hard to pick out specific smells, even for an alpha. Natasha swiped her card to access the lab, walking inside once it unlocked. As soon as the alpha stepped through the doors the strong smell of the same omega wolf filled his nose. Now Steve could tell this omega was male before the scent had been two weak on Clint and Natasha, but the smell in this room was so strong and it was clear he had been all over the scientist’s lab. The room was empty, but Steve knew they couldn’t have left here any longer than 10 minutes ago.
“But nothing.” ‘Strucker’ bit back. “He is our golden goose.”
“So am I. Magic is just an illusion. The dumb are fooled by-” The omega was cut off by Steve kissing him gently.
“Steve.” Tony didn’t giggle no, Steve might argue otherwise.
“Yes?”
Steve grinned, taking Tony’s rum and handing it to Natasha before carrying Tony upstairs. The bots followed them, Tony reaching out to pet them, assuring them that he was okay. Steve reached their room and walked inside, pausing and sniffing, nose scrunching up as he let out a growl.
“I just remembered I was going to go annoy Loki.” Clint also left, leaving Tony and Steve alone in the room.
Tony groaned as he patted his pockets, realising he didn’t bring any cigarettes with him, again. He had forgotten yesterday too and was determined to get one this time.
Steve had driven them to the restaurant on his motorcycle and Tony had enjoyed every minute of it. Arms wrapped securely around Steve, chest pressed against the larger man’s back, wind whipping past him as they drove towards the city. The omega was so tempted to ask the blonde to take him to work and back on it, and the alpha would probably say yes, but it would be unfair, no matter how much he wanted it to happen. But there was not a chance in Hell that Steve would get away with not taking the brunette out again, even if it was just for a ride around the city, they didn’t have to go anywhere, just riding would be perfect.
The brunette shrugged. “They either ignored my existence or wouldn’t leave me alone until I was ‘put in my place’. I don’t think you’d be able to comprehend what an omega goes through every single day of their life, Steve. Not until you’ve experienced that fear yourself. Ask any omega and they will all tell you the same thing, I’ve never met one that hasn’t felt that way at least once.”
“He will be back soon, you’ll see. Then you can kiss him all you want. But for now, lets party, yeah? Time to have fun.”
Tony was surprised. “You talked to them?”
A blush spread across the omega’s cheeks, his head dipping down slightly in Steve’s hold before tucking it under the alpha’s chin. His eyes fluttered closed as his head rested on Steve’s chest, listening to the steady sound of Steve’s heart. Tony let out another yawn as the alpha pulled him onto his lap and let go of their entwined fingers to wrap his arms around the omega.
“I’m okay, Steve. Kind of tired though.” Tony smiled up at the alpha before letting out a yawn.
“I’ve never had an experience like that.” Tony rubbed under his eyes before taking a sip of his scotch. “I got in a lot of trouble at MIT. I’m surprised they didn’t kick me out.”
“Yeah. Strongbow please.”
“I miss Steve.” Tony pouted into the male’s shoulder as Tyler wrapped his arms around the omega’s middle.
The pack soon ordered their Chinese food and it was Bruce’s turn to choose. The delta ended up picking ‘Sherlock Holmes’, and the whole pack gathered around to watch it once their food had arrived.
“Maybe he went for an early break?” Clint suggested, looking around the room. Both wolves were unaffected by the omega’s scent. They knew one had been in the room, but they wouldn’t be affected like an alpha.
“You know him?” The omega asked.
“I’ll have to torture you guys another time.” Tony grinned.
“You’re beautiful.” Steve sat on the bed beside where he had laid Tony down and turned on the bedside lamp before running his hands through the omega’s hair.
Tony has a panic attack in this chapter and talks about his past and being manipulated/lied to. Just in case anyone needs a warning.
Bruce nodded. “Everyone else?”
“Is that why you smell like that?” Wanda tilted her head, pointing to Tony’s stomach.
“At first it was an issue, but after being in a pack for so many years and having to go out on missions, sometimes in our shifted forms, we had to learn to communicate with one another. Somethings are harder to get, and Thor and Loki don’t always understand us either, but you’ll get there. We’ll help you out.” Clint’s tail wagged. “Think of me as your personal feline language interpreter.”
As I said, I'm posting the two together.
“We’re courting.” Steve smiled.
“I have no idea, but everyone is gone and we’re in the shade now. It’s cold.”
“Scared?” Tony raised an eyebrow, opening one eye.
Once everyone was done, the pack headed up to the main floor. Clint, Natasha and Sam started to pack the car whilst Steve made sure everyone was out before locking the house. JARVIS would watch over the house and the bots while they were gone while also looking out for Tony. Steve had never been so thankful for the AI.
“I’ve come to negotiate, Tony.” Stane looked up at the omega, holding out the glass of scotch. “Come on, it’s your favourite.”
“What did I do?” Thor asked, confusion spreading over his face.
Bruce’s panic started to return.
The guards nodded, the three of them leaving the hallway. No doubt he would be knocked out with a tranquillizer again and taken away. That was always fun.
“I’m fine. I can take care of myself. I work at crazy hours. Whoever the inspiration hits. We don’t all have normal body clocks that allow us regular and decent sleep. I’ve gone five days without sleep before and I was fine-”
“Get everyone else and suit up. We’re going to find him.” Steve said as he pushed through them, not waiting for a reply. He went into the kitchen, getting away from the rest of the pack so he could talk to JARVIS.
Steve slammed his shield into another HYDRA agent, knocking them unconscious before turning on his heels and punching another in the gut before kneeing them in the face, knocking them unconscious too. Steve looked over at the room to Hulk and Thor who were currently taking out the final guards.
“This is Steve.” Tony introduced the newcomer.
It wasn’t the first time an alpha had tried to touch him inappropriately. He’s had far worse done to him by the members of his previous pack, Stane being the worst. This was another young alpha, he must be only twenty-one, maybe twenty-two at the most, and only just able to get into the bar, thinking he could have an easy fuck with an older omega that would just roll on their back in submission. This alpha was so wrong.
“Of course, it does. We have to make sure Captain America’s mate and our very own tech genius is healthy.”
The male turned upon hearing his name, a female alpha walked over. She looked so familiar, but he couldn’t remember where from.
“Okay, Steve. Love you.” Nat shouted, dragging out the last word.
“You drive me crazy, you know that, right?” Steve called, following after the omega as the left his lab.
“Hey, Steve. Are you ready to go?” Tony came up beside the alpha, his hand sliding into the larger male’s.
“Barton.” The blonde gave a warning growl as he got into the driver’s seat and buckled in. Natasha and Tony also got into the car and buckled themselves in as Steve backed out of the parking space. “SHIELD HQ, right Tony?”
Tony let out a laugh, leaning back into the alpha. “I did. Thank you, Steve.” It was the best birthday he had in years.
“I traded with Clint for his dessert,” Thor replied, looking at the archer.
“Steve?” Bucky’s head poked through the door, Steve opening one eye to look over at him, trying his hardest not to look pissed at his second. “I’m sorry to tell you this but we’ve been called in for a mission.”
Tony looked over to where the scent was coming from behind the tree line. The omega let out a growl, letting the delta know he had been caught spying and that he wasn’t impressed.
The omega let out another growl. He couldn’t do anything anymore.
“I’ve texted Bruce.” The redhead grinned as they made their way across the street to a club named Aurora’s.
“Deal.” She grinned. “I hope you get better soon Tony. I’ll let Agent Coulson know and hopefully, I’ll see you soon.” She let the omega go before walking over to the main desk, where Agent Coulson was talking to a cleaner.
, Steve thought to himself.
“I owe you it.” Tony smiled softly before kissing the delta’s cheek. Everyone watched them both in confusion and shock, excluding Natasha as she seemingly knew what the exchange was about.
“Sure you will,” Clint replied sarcastically, giving a mischievous grin.
“Steve. Nice to meet you.” The two shook hands before the two blonde alphas looked at one another.
“Still hilarious though. You were so dumb.” Rhodey began to laugh, Tony glaring over at him.
“Thanks, J.”
“It’s what you’re going to do… eat my brownies.” Clint huffed, crossing his arms. “Now you can have my friendship back or the brownies.”
“What?”
Also, I changed my username again because I'm a disaster but I really like this one so it will probably stay (so it's closer to my twitter (defencelesstark) and tumblr (defenceless-stark) accounts lol)
Well, I haven't updated in a little while. I'm so sorry. But I'm back as the story continues.
“Tony, I’m serious.”
“Fine. You win.” Tony muttered as he stood up before following where Steve had walked. The alpha was waiting for him just a few paces ahead, tail wagging as Tony walked over. Tony looked up at the alpha, tail wagging softly as he rubbed up against the golden wolf.
“I was going to be in the next room!” Tony looked away from the blonde. “You know what, leave it. It doesn’t matter.”
“Thank you, Natasha. I’ll join you guys in a bit for movie night?” Bruce offered at which the other two wolves nodded at before going into the living room.
“I’ll pin a nickname on you soon, Tony. Don’t think you’ll be able to get out of this.”
The omega struggled to find time to spend with Pepper, she was busy most of the time with her work with SHIELD, but they planned to go to lunch together on Sunday. He also hadn’t met alone else that he felt he could become close to. A new friend, especially one Bruce knew, would be fine.
“Yeah, I’m surprised you do,” Bruce commented.
The omega left SHIELD HQ, heading to a corner shop where he picked up a pregnancy test. The lady looked at him strangely but didn’t say anything. Tony took it back to SHIELD and went up to the restroom on the floor of the workshop, thankful it was empty. Tony went into the stall, peeing on the stick as instructed. He flushed before putting down the lid so he could sit on the toilet, waiting for the result. Tony flicked through the news on twitter for a while, checking what was trending. After a while, he checked the time seeing it was up and he could check the result. Tony stared at the pregnancy test in fear, hands shaking.
Bruce Banner: “Delta” Wolf (mutated due to experimentation)
Tony smirked, keeping low to the ground as he watched the alpha, thankful the grass was able to hide him. The blonde had yet to spot him, and the rustling noise coming from behind Steve would be sure to make him think that Tony was behind him, when the omega was, in fact, in front. The wind was working in his favour, the alpha had yet to catch his scent.
I have a few more but those are my favourite ones so far.
“Ah, yes. The boyfriend.” Stane waved his hand. “Don’t worry, he’s being dealt with.”
Clint made a whipping noise from the back seat, causing the beta beside him to burst out laughing. Clint was quickly becoming a dead-man and the alpha’s rage at the delta would have been able to be smelt by all in the car. The blonde took a deep breath, ignoring the two in the back as he focused on driving.
Tony only nodded and waited for the omega to continue her story.
“Who’s ran away?” Clint asked, walking over.
Tony tilted his head up, his hands going on either side of the blonde’s face before pulling the alpha down into a kiss. Steve’s hands made their way to Tony’s ass, squeezing it as he pushed the omega backwards until he was against the island table.
The meal had been pretty smooth after that, Steve mainly kept quiet, allowing Tony to bond with his pack that could become the omega’s own one day. Tony made conversation with everyone, including Loki albeit a short one. Bucky had embarrassed Steve with tales of them growing up and the stupid things they did together. As much as Steve wanted to stop the beta from telling anymore, they had made Tony happy and laugh so much that he couldn’t bring himself to do it. So he dealt with his embarrassment just so he could see the omega smile.
The two chatted as if no time had passed between them, and it was nice for Tony. He was getting some normality back. It didn’t take long for them to reach the house again. Steve was at the door waiting. The alpha’s face dropped upon seeing the two wolves together. Tony spotted Bucky lying on the grass beside Sam, smirking at the alpha.
“You don’t need to worry about me.”
He didn’t want to hunt the rabbit either, he wasn’t hungry, but a chase to get his blood pumping would be nice. The wolf winced as he stepped on a twig, hearing it snap underneath him which caused the rabbit to look up, directly over to the source of the noise before bolting. Tony chased after it, just for the fun, keeping it in his sight as it zipped through the trees, trying to lose the wolf that was chasing it. It was all going well until the rabbit made a very sharp left turn, confusing the omega before he could see what he was running into. He jumped too late, his hind legs catching on a log, causing him to lose balance and tumble down a steep hill that followed directly behind it before stopping by crashing into something.
“Whatever. Just come sit.”
“Steve will be out in a minute,” Natasha told them both before going over to the chest with Bucky, Clint following behind them.
“I-I think so.” Tony was unsure. Honestly, he had no idea. This was big.
The strawberry-blonde left her office and took the elevator down to the first floor. Her heels clicked against the floor as she speed-walked to Tony’s lab. She had only been there one other time but she had a good memory and could remember the way there.
in that way, with a good friend of mine. I haven’t seen her in a while and we were just going for a catch-up and I think I’m going to be late. I was just wondering where I was, so I could get back and-”
“Thor found out its karaoke night.” Nat sighed.
It didn’t take a genius to work out that omegas were vulnerable when left out alone. Yeah, omegas were in a better position than if they were human, even a small group of humans wouldn’t be any better, but it was still dangerous. Especially with the way a lot of alphas still thought.
“Oh no, what a nightmare.” Pepper said sarcastically with a smirk. “Have you booked another appointment?”
“You made an AI too!?” Peter looked up at Tony. “You are so awesome!”
Pepper’s and Tammi’s words stuck in his head.
“We couldn’t find you anywhere Tony. You weren’t answering your phone. We came looking for you.” Bruce stepped into the workshop, stopping Tony with a hand on his shoulder as the omega walked passed.
The Avengers Pack didn’t get home until 6 am. Steve had called Tony, but it had rung out until going to voice mail. He figured the omega probably waited up all night for the alpha’s call but ended up falling asleep.
Sam Wilson: Delta Wolf
“So, what am I supposed to do?” The omega asked, looking at his new friend.
“He resented me for being an omega, Pep.”
The blonde shook his head, following the brunette before pressing the button for the top floor. “Fine, okay, you can fly the quinjet. But you’re staying in it while we go to the village.”
“We could make a pit stop on our tour of the states.”
"I can't hold it. It's too much." Pietro replied, Wanda, nodding along.
“Yeah, we were going to say hi, but you weren’t in.” Natasha shrugged.
“Is it bad that I’m not going to ask?” Sam turned to Clint.
A howl was heard in the distance which caused both wolves to stand, Tony, lifting his weight off his left leg, and look over to where the call was coming from. The alpha took a few steps forward, then howled back in response to the call. It dawned on the omega that the alpha had someone, most likely from his pack or even a
Tony looked up at the wolf. “Yes. Of course. It was an accident, Steve.”
I should upload soon but I just moved into my new house yesterday and I have my first university class on Friday, so I'm pretty busy. But I have a name for the book now.
“Okay.” Tony nodded as the alpha stood and left the room.
“It’s a ten!”
The brunette stepped inside, closing the door behind him as quietly as possible before walking over to the bed. Carefully sitting down on the edge, Tony looked over Steve. The alpha was awake, his eyes were slightly reddish-pink and glossed over as they looked up at Tony for a moment before going back to staring at the wall in front of him.
“Says the person who spies on people for a living,” Steve replied, walking back over to the hob so he could stir the saucepan of spaghetti.
“I’ve had a drink.” Steve was still trying to convince them.
Omegas and deltas were known to be more playful, and Tony’s previous pack had mainly been alphas and betas. Other than Pepper, he didn’t have many other people to play with, as they were much older business wolves who wouldn’t dare play with an omega.
Reasoning: Just like Clint, I wanted him to be lower than Bucky, but not an omega and without making him an alpha. I also don’t know why I went with dark brown fur for Sam. I knew I wanted dark fur, but I wanted everyone’s fur to be different, so I went with solid brown after deciding that I would give Rhodey and Bucky grey and black.
Fur colour: Golden, faded brown spots on legs, golden mane with black tips
“Steve’s still distracted with Clint, you have time to escape.”
“Now, now, Steve. You don’t want anything happening to your pretty little omega now.”
“I shouldn’t have invited him over. I heard about him being like that to omegas, but I didn’t think he’d be so rude towards you, in front of us both.” Steve held the brunette close, kissing the top of his head and burying his face into the omega’s hair.
“Scared of what?”
“As far as I’m aware, he’s fine. He called me to help you. He’s just giving us some space for now.”
Clint let out a dramatic whine but slid off the bed. Bucky remembered to pick up the room key along with the one to the other room. The eight of them had gotten two rooms between them. Bucky, Sam, Clint and Steve in this one and Bruce, Thor, Loki and Natasha in the other. The beta smiled at Sam, kissing the delta’s head before leaving the room, Clint following.
“Steve Rogers.” Steve scowled at the familiar voice.
“Do you want to do something for lunch?” Tony asked after a moment of silence.
“Right, Brooke, you’re a mated alpha. Can you please try and convince this” Pepper began, circling her chopsticks around Tony’s face, leaning over the bench so she could see the alpha “mess of an omega, who is very clearly interested in an alpha that
“You’re an omega. Submitting to any alpha and doing as they command is what you should do. What a good omega should do. So, run along back into the kitchen where you belong, before I make you.”
A shy smile formed on the omega’s face before turning mischievous as he literally bounded over to Bruce. Tony might be older than Bruce, but he was a child deep down.
“I can show you if you like?”
“The difference is I do it for a living.”
“You're overwhelmed by me,” Steve stated, looking like a kicked puppy with those sad baby-blue eyes.
“Steve.”
Thursday was always movie night and they rotated who picked to make it fair, much like house chores too. Steve was a fair alpha and joined in too. He could have simply made the lower-ranking packmates do everything, but he didn’t. Thor, who was also an alpha but a feline shifter instead, did his fair share too. Everyone joined in here and there.
“You okay?” Steve asked, Tony nodding. “Time to meet Hulk.”
“What if it goes wrong?” He asked, looking over Tony’s shoulder.
“I was drunk and didn’t want to do my work for SHIELD.” Tony climbed into the bed.
“Trust me, he wanted to. You’re lucky he listens to me.” Steve laughed a little at the memory from the dinner table, Clint’s scowl still clear in his mind at being refused the final slice after trying to sneak a slice a few times and getting a slap on the head from Natasha.
Eventually, Bucky broke the silence. “Steve, we’re going to start the movie without you if you don’t get your ass here right now.”
I genuinely can't remember if I said if Maria was a shifter or not. I know I was debating it whilst writing the first book. If I did, let's just ignore that and I'll change it *shifty eyes*
“HYDRA.”
“Back off, he’s mine.” That was all it took before Clint punched the alpha in the jaw.
“Is it bad?” Tony pulled back a little.
“Who wants the first piece?” Tony regretted asking that as another full-blown argument happened, but the omega wouldn’t have it any other way. The first piece went to Loki, the only one not arguing, before giving a slice to everyone else.
“We’re going to see Bruce while we’re here, Steve. Did you want to come with?” The female beta asked, breaking Steve out from his train of thought about this mysterious omega.
"No, you guys get out of here. I'm going to finish this off." Tony turned to face Sam and Clint. "You look after them, I'm going to find Steve and make sure HYDRA doesn't get away with this."
“And you’re being possessive.”
Tony looked between the pair, slightly scared and confused. They were not helping the dull ache in his head.
There was no response, causing both wolves to worry more. Any shifter would be able to smell their panic as soon as they stepped into the hall.
“I was just worried when you weren’t there.”
“How?” Pause. “Why?”
A roar came from Thor’s direction and Tony looked over once more. Thor was shifted into his lion form now. Big, beautiful and golden. Thor shook, his mane fluffing out, before stretching. Thor’s shifted form was huge, definitely bigger than Steve and looked powerful and mighty, that was until he pounced on by a dark brown, almost black, wolf and began to play fight as if they were young again. The wolf was a lot smaller than Thor but showed no fear of the alpha lion.
“How long until we get there?” Tony looked up to the golden wolf.
“No shit sherlock.”
Steve had somehow managed to survive the journey home and hadn’t killed anyone. But the night wasn’t over yet and both of his packmates, Clint especially, were still pushing their luck as they sang love songs to the alpha and omega. The alpha eventually got the two agents in the house and upstairs to their beds, telling them to be quiet because of the others in the house. Sam and Bucky were still up, hearing them talk in the kitchen, so he didn’t have to worry about them being woken up. Thor could sleep through a storm passing right through their house, so it was only Bruce and Loki he’d have to apologise to in the morning. Or let them get their revenge by disturbing the two hungover wolves.
“What’s it like to be an alpha?”
Bruce caught Tony’s sad scent, making him feel guilty. The omega only had him and Pepper here, and Tony had mentioned he’d been finding it hard to find time with her.
“Hey, there’s nothing wrong with junk food.”
“I hate you all.” Steve groaned looked around at his pack. “Except Thor. Wait. Where is Thor?”
“I was nine!” Tony shouted, causing those around them to look over. He knew the embarrassing stories were coming, of course, they would.
Tony nodded, biting his lip before leaving the workshop to go into Bruce’s lab. Pepper had taken this time to message her superior, to tell her she had to leave work on a family emergency. Tony returned into the workshop a few minutes later, phone pressed against his ear.
“Wow, a cheetah. That’s cool. You’re the first cheetah shifter I’ve ever met before.”
Climbing out of the bed before going over to Natasha who had his clothes, the two shared a look, trying not to laugh at the archer’s expression. Bruce made his way into the bathroom, locking the door behind him to start his shower.
“And who was that?” Clint asked.
“Are you listening? Tony?” The brunette turned to face Steve now, the alpha still clearly worried and in distress.
“What’s up with me,” Tony muttered to himself, grabbing the bubble bath. “I don’t get this angry about little things. I shouldn’t have had a go at Steve that much. Yes, he was wrong but still, I shouldn’t have talked to him that way.”
“Goodnight Steve.” Tony let his eyes close, his head resting against the alpha’s chest, letting his heartbeat lull him to sleep.
“Doll?” Tony grinned.
“You’re still so small considering you’re eighteen weeks with twins.” Steve stopped, turning to look back at the omega.
“He just wants to keep you safe.”
“You definitely have alpha tendencies to do that. I don’t think I’ve seen any omega talk back to an alpha like that.” The cheetah wrapped an arm around Tony.
The pack nodded, leaving the alpha alone in the room. Loki was the last one to leave, looking over at the blonde.
“Can we stop for cheeseburgers? I haven’t had one in over three months.”
“Okay. That’s good. Can you give me a number?”
"I-I believe so." The man nodded.
He knew that Steve and Bucky had a pack prior to The Avengers and that they had been killed. Neither of the two had told him themselves. Bucky and Steve had talked about a previous pack before and Tony had assumed they left them once confident to make a pack of their own. That was until Bruce accidentally let it slip one night while they were working that they had been attacked and only the two of them survived and was the reason Bucky lost his arm.
“I still hate the fact that you were taken before.” The blonde embraced the omega, resting his chin on the brunette’s head. “I don’t know what I’d do if it was to happen again.”
“I think you mean mummy.” The archer began to laugh. “Steve is their daddy.”
“Half a pint of beer three hours ago and water since. You would be fine to drive.” Loki spoke up.
“Thank fuck. I hate the snow.” Bucky muttered. “Don’t even say anything, kitty.” He glared over at the smirking Loki. Loki, being a snow leopard, was at home here in the snowy peaks. Bucky had never liked the snow, even growing up. Steve would have to drag him out on snow days so they could play in the snow, which always resulted in the alpha getting sick, but it was worth it.
“Get down there and look for survivors and give them help if they need it and put out the fires. If you’re able to, take people who need medical care to the quinjet, Hulk you’ll have to let Bruce come back if someone needs a doctor.”
“Brownies.” Everyone in the pack said at once, causing Tony to burst out laughing.
“The alpha you like.” Tammi moved off her stool and sat on the one right next to Tony’s, where her mate was sat just before.
“We’re never going to let you live it down, Tony.”
“Nah, you guys feed me too well.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“But you know that you’ve taken it too far?”
I'm so sorry for being super lazy and not updating, but I'm back. Not long until the end of this book now. Any ideas for what I have installed?
“Besides the point.” Steve gave an exasperated look to the beta. “Are you okay?”
“I said it’s fine, Bruce. Get home. I can handle them.” Steve hung up before the scientist could get another word in.
“It won’t we’ve got this. Now stop crowding me, it will look suspicious.”
“Let’s go,” Clint said, the doors to the hanger opening up as the quinjet doors shut. Everyone found a place to sit. “We’ll find him.” The archer smiled at his alpha as they flew out of the hanger.
“I need you to take Wanda and Pietro to the quinjet and keep them safe. They’re only kids and have been experimented on and turned into shifters. I don’t want them getting into any more trouble.” Tony spoke, walking down a dark hallway, the lights flickering now and then.
“I gotta go.” The alpha stumbled over his words, holding his phone close to his chest as he left the room, the three packmates laughing.
“I don’t mind hunting,” Natasha added. If Tony remembered correctly it was her turn for dinner tonight.
“Agent Coulson kept you up there for a while. Was everything alright?” The beta asked as the male approached her.
“Mr Stark, I do hope you will join me for dinner this evening. I have a guest whom you might want to see.”
Steve sat up with a stretch, looking around. “Let’s go inside and see what they’re up to.”
“I definitely won’t make any promises there. I have a bit of a proven track record in being late.” The omega replied, turning on his heels to face the human with a shrug, walking backwards a bit before turning back around, heading for the elevator. Once inside and seeing he was alone, Tony looked down at his watch and clicked a button. “Hey JARVIS, find everything you can on SHIELD.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“It’s not stealing, it’s borrowing without permission.”
Tony cut the alpha off with a hug. He was so happy he could just have some alone time.
Steve walked into the room not too long after before stopping and walking backwards out of the room to the hallway, almost bumping into Bucky as he did. This second in command gave him a confused look as he sat beside Sam who was about to call him out before Natasha put a finger to lips, signalling for the delta to keep quiet. The pack kept their eyes on their alpha, no one saying anything, even Clint who was biting his lip to hold back his snigger. Clearly, the lab coat had caught the alpha’s attention.
“He’s worried. Thank you for your help.”
The two wolves continued their way to the ground floor and into the living room, TV on playing an episode of Rick and Morty. Sam, Bucky and Natasha were on one sofa, Sam’s head resting on the male beta’s shoulder as Bucky’s metal arm was draped over the delta’s side. The coffee table had been pushed aside to make room for Thor and Clint who were lying on their stomachs on the floor, watching the TV show. Loki was in the armchair, as always, and Bruce was alone on the other sofa. Steve lead Tony over to the sofa on which Bruce sat, sitting down and gently pulling the omega to sit beside him. Tony smiled as Steve’s arm wrapped around him and he happily cuddled into the alpha’s side.
The omega went straight for the bed, collapsing immediately on it on his front, lying face in the duvet for a moment before rolling onto his back, head leaning up to look at the scientist before bursting out laughing again. He was trying to kick off his shoes, grumbling about how they were being the bane of his life. He gave up, taking off his glasses, throwing them carelessly onto the bed and slipping off his watch.
A few moments of silence past before Wanda spoke up.
“We could always hunt while we’re out there,” Bucky suggested.
Tony kept close to Steve’s side, the woods was a lot darker and anyone could be leaking around in the shadows or trees. The omega was on high alert, ears constantly flickering to get sound from around him, nose sniffing to catch scents and tail subconsciously partly between his back legs. The alpha nuzzled into the brown wolf, licking across the omega’s head.
“Thank you, Agent Coulson.” Tony looked down at the card once more before standing and walking over to the door and stepping just outside of it. “I’ll let you know my decision.” It was most likely going to be a yes. The wolf had nowhere else to go, but he was going to try to find out as much research as he could about SHIELD.
“Puny omega much punier than Thor.” Hulk leaned in once more. “Must protect puny omega.”
“You don’t have to do that, I know you have other projects to work on.” Steve placed a hand on the omega’s jaw, thumb rubbing his cheek gently.
“Yeah, I’ve heard that one before.”
“You need to learn how to troll them back.” Tony laughed, taking off his shoes and throwing them to the floor. “Ugh, my shirt is over on the sofa.”
“Not as much as Tony.” Natasha pointed out, sitting on a barstool.
“The humans weren’t able to handle it. They couldn’t control their animal side. They were more like, for example, werewolves than shifters. They then tried betas and deltas. Same result. Uncontrollable shifting. Violent outbursts. Not listening to leaders. Eventually, the animal side of them ended up killing them. So, they tried with omegas. And it worked.”
“Deal. No backing out now, Banner. This is the real deal. We are going to have a good time.” Tony smirked.
Bruce looked hesitant. Honestly, he wasn’t sure if this was a good idea. He had already been out yesterday with Tony, and although Steve was a very laid-back alpha, he wasn’t sure if he should be spending this much time away from the back. The female beta picked up on his worries.
“Who’s ran away?” Clint asked, walking over.
“How was your chat with Agent Carter, Rogers?” Clint teases, looking over at the alpha female as she got into a lift before looking at his alpha, an eyebrow raised. He can’t help but tease Steve about her. He knew he wasn’t interested in her in the slightest, but he loved to push his alpha’s buttons.
Fur colour: Dark grey (solid)
“I know but-”
“Oh, yeah, sure let’s go.” Steve nodded, looking over at his two packmates before walking towards the elevator and pressing the button, waiting for either of the two to open first.
Tony placed his menu down on the table, grinning over at his best friends who didn’t look amused at all and a waitress standing with her notepad ready to order. Steve slowly lowered his menu, cheeks slightly red as he looked down at the table.
“Are you getting coffee or just going straight to your room?” Bruce asked, hoping for the latter.
“My eyes?”
“It wasn’t a problem.” Steve looked hesitant. “How was today?”
Tony let out a belly laugh, his head tipped back, crinkles forming by his eyes. He was close to tears at Tyler’s story. The wolves were sitting at a bar, Tony with a scotch whilst the alpha had a beer. Tyler was explaining the story of how he and his beta got in trouble when they were younger on their packs farm. The two wolves had forgotten to shut the gate properly for the turkey pen, and the wind had opened it up again, causing the birds to escape into the nearby woodland. They knew they were going to get into massive trouble so tried to sort it out themselves; massive mistake.
“It’s tonight... isn’t it?” Sam looked over at Clint and Bucky who were sitting at the island table. The trio had been trying to get the alpha’s attention for some time now but had resorted to teasing comments, but the blonde was too busy texting to notice.
The omega decided to cut in before they got in any further. “I need coffee.”
“Busy being annoying,” Bruce spoke up.
The male snorted again, stabbing his sushi with a chopstick.
“I don’t need protecting. If you want your space back, I will go ask for you.” Tony went to get up.
“Slipped my ass,” Clint muttered, leaning down to rub at his leg.
“You guys are going to love this. Tony is going to make SHIELD a thousand times better.”
“Yeah.” Tony gave a tight smile. “So am I.”
“Boring.” Tony flicked both alphas’ noses before going back to dancing again.
“Are you okay?” Brooke asked, breaking the silence.
“Shut up. Steve. Steve. Steve.” The three of them stopped in the hallway as Clint spoke down the comms. “Steve I’ve found Tony -oww! Tony found me.” Tony stared at the archer, going to hit the delta again “and saved my ass.” Tony grinned triumphantly.
He could hear Bucky laughing as Sam and Clint argued. Thor was chatting to Bruce, most likely dishing out the scientist’s share of the meal. Natasha and Tony were also in conversation, the beta having distracted the male from Clint and Sam. Everyone in the pack was used to some sort of argument breaking out in some form or another. Looking back up at the two delta wolves that were still arguing, hands slapping at each other, something inside of the alpha wolf snapped. This night was meant to be perfect for Tony, so he could be shown what having a good pack was like, but it wasn’t going that way at all.
“I forgot I was speaking to the King of Cheeseburgers.”
“Alright, Barton, what did you do to him?” The delta wolf asked, raising an eyebrow at the archer.
“No!” All the omegas called.
“Well, I am pretty great.”
“I’m just ordering his usual.” Clint shrugged. “Let Tony get him, he’ll listen to him.”
Upon hearing the door click closed, Steve began making his calls. The first was to Pepper, then to Rhodey and finally Brooke. Steve explained the story to each one of them and asked that they keep alert for Tony, for any signs of him at all. That they also ask around, to see if anyone saw anything or had seen the omega since. He didn’t want them to put themselves in danger by coming out on a pack mission. James Rhodes had left around two weeks ago with his pack, so Steve had asked him to keep an eye out for anything shifty in other states, instead of abandoning his pack.
“No! Get off me.” His response made the alpha growl, tugging harder on Tony. “You’re hurting me.”
“We could go out somewhere… You know the area better than me.”
“Thank you, doll.” The alpha grinned, kissing the omega softly before pulling back and gently rubbing a thumb over one of the marks he had made on Tony’s neck. As predicted, Tony had gone into heat and Steve had his rut halfway through, Tony’s heat lasted for five days and Steve’s only three. The blonde had done a wonderful job of marking up the omega and claiming him as his own with hickeys from the omega’s jaw to around his thighs. Alpha wolves were known to mark their mates during heats and ruts, claim them as their own, to warn off other alphas. What Steve didn’t expect was to mark Tony as his mate. The omega had begged for it and the blonde was scared that once his heat ended Tony would regret it, but the brunette showed no signs of it. The pair had mated; they had a deep bond that lasted for life, in most cases anyway.
“H-hello,” Tammi spoke softly. The omega was incredibly shy and nervous, leaning closer to her alpha for support and protection.
Bruce smiled softly. He was so glad when Tony had mentioned that he had made new friends. He knew that the omega got lonely and meeting two more shifters had made a difference to him. Tony was less clingy with the delta and was happier. That and things were going well between him and Steve. They’d only met up a few times since that night but never had very long together or alone. But now Tony was going to spend time with not only Steve but the whole pack, so he would be able to have an even better social life. The scientist was also hoping to make sure he could give the two some alone time together as well, as they failed at having that before. There would normally be another pack member around or the pair would be in a public setting, he had spoken to Natasha on the phone earlier and they were going to keep the pack as calm as possible. He knew she could take care of Clint. Hopefully, they could convince Bucky and Sam to lay off too. Loki wouldn’t be a problem at all, and Thor was harmless though would most likely be inquisitive about the omega as the alpha lion had never properly met a wolf omega before.
“Hi. I’m Pepper Potts.” The redhead smiled, her hand reaching out to shake the alpha’s hand.
, Steve thought.
“He’s missing? Tony was only here earlier. He didn’t look very well at all, said he was going home.” The alpha female replied, frowning. “I told him to go get checked over at SHIELD Medical.”
“What do you mean by go-” Bruce was cut off by someone else, but no one was around except him and Tony, so he believed.
“Are you sure?” Steve asked.
In a way, he was excited to get his own workshop so he could leave the place a mess and not care about it. Of course, having Bruce around was fun and he loved to push the delta’s buttons, but they were going to be right next door to one another with a connecting door, it’s not like they’d be floors or even buildings apart.
“I don’t want to sleep.” The omega frowned, taking offence. “you just got back.”
The delta shook his head “no. I heard a crash and went to investigate. I couldn’t open any of the doors. All I’ve heard is a very broken sounding “go away” which was just before I called you.”
“You dare and I’ll cut off your hands.”
“That would be telling.”
“No. No buts here Steve. I told you that I wanted to go alone, and you said that was fine. We made an agreement and you lied to me. I had been locked away and watched over for months. I wanted to be free, to have my own space.” The omega turned away again, grabbing a towel from the trunk at the foot of their bed. He needed a nice bath to calm him down. “If you would rather have had me go with someone, you should have said it there and then. Not lied and sent a member of your pack to spy on me! I’m supposed to be your mate. We should be able to trust each other. You need to start treating me with more respect than that Steve. You’re supposed to be better than this.”

“Hi.” Tony focused back on his tablet again when Brock didn’t reply, nose scrunching up a little.
Old and new friend's for Tony.
“I do. I feel it all the time. Every time I look at him, every time he does something. From the smallest expressions on his face when he’s thinking to when he’s full-on laughing at my expense because Clint has made my life Hell.”
He did have a tendency to strip and run around naked when drunk, shouting “I’m Stark naked!” to anyone and everyone, as Rhodey and Pepper chased him down to get him to bed. Tony wasn’t as fast as Rhodey but was smaller so he could slip through places the alpha couldn’t, whereas Pepper could follow him into the small places in which he escaped, but he was faster than her. At first Tony could be running around for ages, one time at a MIT Students Christmas party he got away with being naked for half the night before running and knocking on people’s doors, but the two wolves learnt to work together in the end and the male omega was lucky if he could get in ten minutes.
“JARVIS?” The female wolf asked, walking over with Tony’s coffee in her hand. “Who’s that?” She passed the omega his drink, Tony taking it gratefully.
“Mine always look shit.”
“I can go speak to Fury. You go ahead. I can handle things here. Maybe send your pack to talk to Agent Coulson. I bet he would want to help too.” Steve nodded at Peggy’s words. Agent Coulson had always helped him since he first joined SHIELD. He was always very thankful to the Agent.
“Hello? Who is-” The omega was cut off.
“Yeah, I can live with that.” Tony leaned forward to kiss Steve gently.
“Tony went home seven hours ago Steve.” Bruce’s eyebrows furrowed.
“Yeah, there’s not many of us now.” The feline gave a sad smile. “Not the first feline shifter?”
Steve is in love and Tony finally gets to see everyone else in their shifted forms.
“Wrong.” Tony huffed as he petted the bot. “Who’s your daddy TIA?”
“Hey, it’s your job.” Tony reached out his hand to grab Steve’s own. “Plus at least you can give me a ride back and I can see you in your uniform.” Steve gave Tony a look as he stood up from his seat. “What? I love a man in uniform.”
“It was good. I met someone new today, an omega wolf, he has just taken up a job opportunity with SHIELD. We’re going to be working together a lot. He’s very smart, a genius.” Bruce began before beginning to eat his dinner as Steve sat down on the barstool beside him. “I didn’t get a lot closer to finishing my project, but I’m about there.”
