this place. It was more than the drinks—the drinks could be garbage sludge for all he cared, but he was beginning to think of Steve and the rest of them as regulars in his life, if not friends. He had no idea what they thought of him, but they had yet to ban him from the premises or give any signs that their friendly attitudes towards him were anything but genuine. That had to be a good thing, right?
Someone behind them coughed. “Look, I like a good romance movie and all myself, but there’s a bit of a line and I’m sure some people are less patient than I.”
Steve. No one should look at you and think you are anything but wonderful. You’re a pain in the ass, but just because you’re scrawny or are more prone to colds shouldn’t matter. I happen to like the fact that someone is shorter than me.”
How the hell did Bruce find out about his crush on Steve anyways? Sure, he knew Bruce went to the coffee shop without him, he didn’t have the man on a leash, but he was only with Tony
The language of the clan was softer than his own, with more of a cadence in the way they spoke. It could still be loud, sarcastic, and every other emotion under the sun, but there were a number of sounds he had never heard before. Antonius practiced as often as he could, picking up phrases such as greetings and words of action, but he sometimes stumbled. It was like the words in their language were said out of order. He would figure out the individual words and try to put them in a sentence, only for everyone around him to frown in confusion. It took some repeating before they understood, and even then, he had to say his sentences backwards.
“Marry me,” Tony said. “Forget about money and titles and what the gossipmongers will say and just marry me.”
“Yeah,” Tony asked. “What do you think about Maslow only studying the healthiest of college students at the time and saying that studying those who aren’t neurotypical can, and I quote, ‘yield only a cripple psychology and a cripple philosophy’?”
“Sir,” JARVIS said, breaking Tony out of his thoughts, “I would like to remind you that your parent-conference is in half an hour.”
Tony didn’t stop—and he didn’t come back—until he was sure that he got every single gun, bomb, and flare. Then he made sure to gather all of the intel he could, because like hell he was going to just set everything on fire. That was how cockroaches came back with larger armies: when everyone thought that they were destroyed and had nothing left.
Pepper sighed once more, rubbing her temple. “This might take a few weeks. Has anyone contacted Thor to see if he would know about this?”
That was not the point. Three people in this world instantly knew everything that the journalists were trying to figure out. Bruce became a little green, yelling at him for being irresponsible and possibly causing future retaliation. Rhodey was just as pissed, because he had to deal with the fallout and the clean-up and the repercussions, not to mention the possible power vacuum. Pepper shook him until his teeth rattled, because it was one thing for him to get kidnapped, it was another thing for him to dive back into danger without as much as a note.
Ned walked with him to the water fountain. “Wanna hear about the chemicals? Some of them were so cool!”
The coffee shop smelled as fantastic as always. The sunlight entered it weakly, casting deep shadows all over the place. Tony was sure that it still felt cheery and warm to the other patrons, but … he paused in the front door for a moment, just taking it all in, wondering what was going to happen next. Some futurist he was, constantly wondering about the future when it should have been horribly obvious. But he couldn’t predict a single thing.
Pepper looked at the apple cake, all warm and fresh, with a critical eye. Tony knew that she occasionally liked sweet stuff, and while many people assumed she preferred the more elegant and fanciful desserts,
As they walked down another hallway towards a staircase that would provide them more cover, they didn’t come across anyone else. Most everyone who was not HYDRA should have been cleared out of the building due to Tony’s fire alarm, but another glance out a window showed no signs of firefighters or even police.
“Oh, yes, as if taking care of yourself is such a punishment.” Pepper kissed his forehead and headed out of the office. “Enjoy your lunch.”
The real story about Captain America was not like the comics at all. Besides the number of different serial runs, the different plot lines (and holes), writers and points in time, plus some characters that were purely fictional; the government had to keep its secrets. The super soldier serum was truly lost. It could not be derived from Steve’s DNA or blood. The paperwork needed to change him from KIA to active service member was taking forever to process.
Maybe his father did have ADHD and was undiagnosed. He wondered how people treated him, remembering foster parents getting frustrated with him and some teachers from previous schools labeling him as a ‘problem child’ with ‘behavioral issues’. They would sit him in the back of the classroom, give him detention for forgetting his homework, and eventually leave him behind. Sure, some teachers tried, but there weren’t always enough resources for everyone and with the amount of times he changed schools because he got shuffled somewhere else …
“Nat,” was all that Antonius could make of the sentence. By the way Nataliya rolled her eyes, it looked like she had attempted to play a trick on him.
“I—” Steve cut himself off, trying to collect his thoughts as he tugged the blanket closer around himself. “I feel so strange. Not like myself at all. Like I’m too large for my body and I’m running on empty. I want to yell and burrow myself under some blankets for the rest of eternity.”
Last spring, a young man from the village shyly asked if he could make a broach for his sweetheart, so he might have a gift if her father gave his blessing.
Did Tony really see Alpha Night like that? As an opportunity to get around all that? He had to ask him more questions, figure out his other opinions about courtship rituals. Was Steve going about this all wrong? Was there a chance to win him if he didn’t want to follow tradition?
He pulled Tony closer, pressing his face into his neck. “I’m sorry. Those omegas were idiots too, for making you think you weren’t good enough or something.”
She looked delighted. “Hydrangea petals! That’s my girlfriend’s favorite flower, but she likes them pink.”
The movie part of their date explained why Steve wanted this particular evening. A movie theater seemed to have themed nights here and there, kind of copying what Turner Classic Movies occasionally did. The night’s feature was a 1922 silent movie, starring John Barrymore as Sherlock Holmes.
“I don’t doubt that,” Mr. Rogers laughed. “I know it has only been a few weeks since he has been diagnosed, but I wanted to check in on how he has been at home and let you know what has been going on at school if he hasn’t already.”
He was coming every day now, sometimes twice, and he wasn’t sure how pathetic or obvious he was getting with his crush. He was sure that Bucky, Sam, and Natasha were more than aware, but what about Steve? Was he being kind, ignoring it to spare Tony any hurt feelings? Was he unaware? He never saw anyone else flirt with him, but he could have someone somewhere. It wasn’t like he and Steve were the best of friends, knowing every detail about each other’s lives.
Now, he kind of wanted to bunker down in the workshop for the winter. Three months of non-stop inventing and designing. It would be glorious. He would be like a reverse Santa Claus, except he actually brought joy to the world through technology instead of just toys. Or was that what the elves did the rest of the year?
“I don’t think she would be that mean,” Steve said, voice somewhere far away. Was he speaking out loud? Damn, that’s not good.
Rhodey hugged him, slapping his back a few times before pulling away. Tony grinned, happy to see him back from another one of his tours. He had no idea where he had gone, classified and all, but he supposed that he could have JARVIS look him up. You know, just in case anything should happen. Maybe have the armor ready as a backup plan, because things always happened.
In the end, he could think of a lot of countries that he hadn’t been to yet. About three dozen or so. It was kind of sad, a lot of them were great vacation spots. One of them was Ireland and that got him thinking about how he couldn’t bring Steve into messes like these. It was bad enough that he had Pepper and Rhodey as possible targets for his enemies.
Later that day, after a few hours of horribly boring board meetings, Tony finally got a moment to himself. He wasted no time grabbing a fork from a random break room and heading back to his lab where the apple cake was waiting for him. There was still some odd behaviors in his head of departments and some variables that stuck out in some reports, but he could pick those apart later. Maybe he could do that instead of fighting off nightmares tonight.
Tony chuckled. “Just come back if you still got bumps and bruises. I wouldn’t mind seeing you again.”
Apparently moving in with Bruce and accepting his proposal wasn’t enough of a clue to get him to realize Betty was perfectly happy with him, her father’s opinions notwithstanding.
Science was one of the classes Peter unfortunately shared with Flash. He was at least seated a few rows away from Peter and in a different lab group. It wasn’t as bad as gym where the higher student-teacher ratio created the perfect environment for students to get away with anything from throwing balls at someone’s head or gossiping when they were supposed to be running laps.
“Oh, fine,” he groaned, letting his shoulders slump dramatically. “There’s this new coffee place that opened up a block away and I’ve been curious! It’s not a Starbucks! I want to see how much of a chance it has of surviving! I need to know if I should invest my time or not!”
Hey everyone! Thank you so much for all of your comments and kudos on the last chapter! I'm so glad you enjoyed it and I hope you enjoy this one too! Keep safe and healthy out there!
Tony was running a bit late for their usual coffee meetup thanks to some late night inventing binges, but Steve was outside the coffee shop hacking up a lung.
“Whoa! You’re lucky you took the right one!” Tony exclaimed. “What if I didn’t want lettuce on my burger this time?”
Peter was in school, probably at lunch. The meeting was going to be short—Mr. Rogers had just wanted to check in and go over how the plan they had come up with for him. All in all, the accommodations seemed to be reasonable and required more effort from Peter’s teachers than Peter himself. Being allowed more time on tests, more options for assignments, and being allowed to get up and move around every so often was not what Tony had expected.
This resulted in a healthy mixture of different students: those almost done with their bachelor’s, beginning freshmen, med students, art degrees, and more. Despite these differences though, most of them agreed the class was not really giving them anything worthwhile.
Steve followed him through the city manor home that belonged to Sir Anthony Stark, the something odd Lord of one Place or other. He was obscenely rich, had connections with every other rich person in the kingdom, and probably abroad as well. No one could quite calculate his worth, but oh, was there plenty of gossip about parties, balls, drinking, and some crazier ideas that didn’t seem to fit: inventions, a falling out with his father, something in Italy—
He was blessed. His gods had not sent him here to punish him, but like Shem’el and the others, to give him safety and family. To make a new, better life.
The simple request brought Steve back to earth. Tony was going through an apparently unexpected rut and needed help. There was nothing to panic about. His friend needed help and that was it. That was all that was going on.
Tony glanced at him. He was not sure what happened in the last … ten hours based on the text messages … but he surmised that something happened.
“That’s … pretty cool,” Tony admitted. “I saw Peter’s handwriting on a lot of notes under the answers section.”
He had been trying to figure out what has turned Steve into a golden retriever. He didn’t accept Stephen Strange’s vague answer about magic and all that. It would eventually wear off, like Tony’s squirrel transformation did, but there were so many unanswered questions.
He and his father did share a lot of similarities: both of them had a lot of energy, fidgeted a lot, could bounce from one topic to another, and had a habit of losing track of time. Aunt Pepper had described to him that his father used to be constantly late and forgot about deadlines, or would go into his workshop and not come out for days. If not for JARVIS and other tools at his disposal, his bad habits would have likely continued to escalate. Sometimes they did that, working on projects together long after Peter was supposed to have gone to bed. They did their best to keep it to weekends, but sometimes they slipped up on a Sunday or Tuesday evening.
“Let’s just … figure something out,” Pepper said, rubbing her temple. “What is the best thing to do for an alpha in this kind of situation?”
“Here, give me one of those,” he said, holding out his hand and grabbing a screwdriver in his other. “I know a thing or two about getting around jammers.”
There were no servants and it was obvious that they did not have as much access to as many resources as he did back in Thrinacia. There were roads, small dirt paths that led to places to fish and to the small fields of grain and vegetables. It appeared that any centers of trade were some days’ walk away and such trips were infrequent. There was a great amount of stone in the soil, requiring many hard hours of labor to remove them, but they were being put to use as borders around their fields. If there were other villages, they were hidden by the hills across the way.
Tonight was a fancy date, though. Just to mix things up. He loved movie nights, taking walks in the park, finding hole-in-the-wall restaurants to try out, and everything else that they had come up with to spend time together outside of work and their other obligations.
Steve shook his head. “No. It confuses the hell out of me sometimes, but it’s amazing. You’re able to do so much that we could only dream of in novels and pictures. There’s a lotta things that I wish hadn’t changed in this world, but technology advancing ain’t one of them.”
Tony knew that Peter could take care of himself and that he had a good head on his shoulders, but damn, it was like he had a martyr complex or something. He didn’t want to cause trouble or make a fuss or bother anyone. Why didn’t Tony insist upon seeing this kid sooner? Why didn’t he insist on sending the lawyers to the kid’s house? This could have been prevented!
“Not as quietly as they would have liked,” Coulson said. “But they are out and Natasha’s team is providing to be quite the distraction.”
His mind was a whirl. On one hand, he didn’t want to ruin the friendship they had. It was a good thing, one of the most important relationships in his entire life.
It was better to just stay away and let Captain America get used to the idea that everything he knew was gone. The son of an old war buddy wasn’t going to help much.
Then, there parents like Tony Stark: the ones who admitted that their kids had faults and might need help. The ones who were reasonable when it came to communication and reached out when they had concerns. The ones who cared about their children and were willing to do whatever it took to help them succeed, no matter how inconvenient it was or what it took. The ones who took utter delight in anything and everything their child did.
As the sniper reached down and grabbed the goon’s walkie-talkie, Tony kept his distance as he waked past the body.
Schools were supposed to be safe places for kids! Sure, there would be arguments and bullying was to be expected, and he could not imagine that every kid out there was a perfect angel who would never get into a fight, but this was different!
“Well hey, when one doesn’t have internet access, snail mail is the way to go!” Clint remarked. “At least we don’t have to pay customs fees or that like other countries.”
Going over to him, Nat took his hand and placed the stone arrowhead she had used to kill the stag into his palm. He blinked up at her, not understanding. When he tried to give it back to her, she shook her head and curled his hand around it.
When they did share the good news, it was met with cheers of joy and relief. Clint pulled out bottles of champagne from god knows where and Pepper somehow had glasses on hand. It was almost like they planned for this. Steve also caught Bucky and Natasha exchanging money, but Bruce gleefully counted out his winnings in front of everyone.
“How about we let him get some rest?” Bruce suggested. “I could go for some tea if anyone would like to join me.”
Tony hoped he didn’t scramble to stand up. The handshake was firm and warm. His smile was friendly, though he couldn’t tell too much with his cowl still on and obscuring other aspects of his face. His eyes though … they were definitely smiling too.
Steve caught his shield with practiced ease and used it to knock out another solider about to run Tony through with a spear. It felt good to have his favorite weapon in his hand once more, the weight of metal comforting when little else was. Bucky charged into the melee, slamming his fist into a different man’s jaw with a sick crack. Steve lost track of how many men they had to take down until Tony sent a long beam of magic towards him, using his shield to magnify and spread it around the hallway. Men attempted to dodge it, but it was a long practiced and favored move of theirs. Soon, there was nothing but groans, rubble, and dust.
Turns out, when Steve wasn’t having a bad day, he was half fire, half thunderstorm. Painting, cleaning, protesting for social reform, getting into brawls over those social reforms, he did nothing in half measures. That also included loving him. Oh, they clashed at times, and there was that infamous run-in with his father, but he would much rather have Steve with all of his flaws than some sort of tepid, domestic bliss. Something like
But he wouldn’t dare take it off. For one, he really was cold and needed another layer. JARVIS had told him so, but he thought he could withstand it. He was wrong. Second, it would be rude to take it off moments after Steve had wrapped it around his neck.
The social worker gave Tony another sneering look and then went to a chair on the other side of the room to give them a semblance of privacy.
“Underappreciated and valuable resources that deal with very prejudiced and misogynistic stereotypes,” Steve interrupted.
“What about after they’re not my teacher anymore?” Peter asked. “Then there’s nothing ethically wrong, right?”
Tony snickered. “Man. I don’t know if I should show you stuff about quantum computing or have you write an autobiography.”
Oh, wow. How was he even breathing right now? How was he even forming words without stuttering? Someone must be smiling down upon him today.
The man balked. “No! The Académie are just a bunch of frumpy idiots! I should know, I’m related to one of them!”
Tony’s heart was hammering. Apparently, Steve had gotten worried about him when he didn’t show up at his usual time. He hadn’t even realized that he
The principal gave him a flat look. “That is not the point, Mr. Thompson. Destruction and theft of property goes against our school policies. Where is the book now?”
Person a is a writer who works best on coffee at midnight and person b's coffee shop is the only one on campus thats open
child ask such things, and he knew the system was broken, but god, finding the right people and giving them resources would make a world of a difference. So, he did that instead. Him being in jail would do no one any good.
“Yeah. They understood. I didn’t have to explain it too much. They were more concerned with it helping me or not.”
If he wanted to visit the man he had a crush on while he was on lunch break, he could do that with barely a five-minute walk.
“I must be missing them.” He didn’t see any employees when he went in, but it could be that he just went in before or after them, or maybe he was just too focused on Steve.
Nat single-handedly killed the war-like tribesmen who had kidnapped her and other women from her tribe, dragging them from their cold, mountain homes to the desert cities. They were to be sold into the slave markets, but the gods whispered in her ear. They told her when to strike and where to go after their captors’ souls had been carried away. She led all the other women to different places where they would be safe and find new clans and tribes. Then they guided her until she arrived on this island, where she met Buk and Stiofán.
“That’s it?” Tony asked, squeezing Steve’s hand involuntarily. His palm was solid and warm. Steve’s thumb began to rub soothing circles on his wrist, right over his veins.
‘Bucky’, as the name tag said, had soft looking hair pulled back into a low ponytail and blue-gray eyes Tony was sure people loved to get lost in. That his flirty smile seemed to be more a natural feature than a conscious effort probably helped with those photoshoots. Before the head honchos got in too deep with owing someone a favor and they had to flee their beloved Italy.
The last time he had gone on a date or anything of the sort was five months ago, when he broke up with someone he refused to even name in his own thoughts. Some might speculate that he was wallowing in self-pity and needed to get back onto the proverbial horse, but it was much more complicated than that. When someone’s words and thoughts were twisted around, when they were constantly gaslighted by the person who was supposed to cherish and respect them … it does things to a person. It takes a long time to recover from such an ordeal.
“You should talk,” Steve replied. “Apparently Rhodey has photos of you from MIT, all bright-eyed and covered in grease. With braces.”
go to the back of the house through the servant’s quarters like some dirty little secret. He had a reason for being a visitor and visitors came through the front door.
undo the last two years by saying that there was something wrong with his kid or he was a delinquent or hopeless!
“It wasn’t a problem, really. I managed to find it under the shelf. Someone just shoved it there, instead of putting it away properly, is all.”
“But seriously, thanks for helping him out. The kid was worrying himself up a wall and wouldn’t tell me about the problem. I mean, it was just a textbook, I could have easily found it—”
“Am I that predictable?” Tony asked, purposefully pouting. “I mean, I’ve had your cappuccinos. The other day I had a hot chocolate. That had no caffeine whatsoever!”
A little part of him had realized that of all the places Tony could have gone, like a medical plaza or a hospital, he had chosen to come to his apartment instead. To
Above, Sam and Rhodey were taking out men with their alchemized wings, frightening more people along the way. There were dozens of abandoned swords and spears littering the ground.
“Here,” Steve said, taking his scarf off and wrapping it around Tony’s neck. He had been shivering all day, despite the heater being on and the thick sweater he was wearing. Steve stamped down the sudden primal urge to wrap him up even further. He was doing this because Tony looked genuinely cold, not because he wanted to be possessive or cover him in his scent.
“I don’t think anyone ever really means to. Emotions are complicated—sometimes you can’t help but feel the way you do.”
Natasha rolled her eyes and handed Tony’s cappuccino to him—Steve was currently bussing tables, because store policy was that no one got stuck doing the same job all the time.
Knowing that anything could happen that would change the situation, Tony fell silent when Captain America and the sniper did. The two of them worked perfectly in-sync, communicating silently with hand gestures. Something tickled at the back of Tony’s brain, like his subconscious was noticing details, but didn’t want to share with the rest of the class just yet.
“Hey, hey,” Tony said, getting up and kneeling beside him. “It’s okay, Peter. There’s nothing wrong with you. You haven’t done anything wrong.”
“It’s Betty,” Carol called as she got the darts from the board so they could begin another round. “She got the letters from everyone. We’ll all probably be drowning in crocuses soon.”
Captain America frowned. “It wasn’t your fault. HYDRA is a force to be reckoned with, as much as we do fight back against them.”
As much as it pained him, Steve couldn’t resist finding some more books about courting. The self-help section had been growing lately and now that he was a little calmer about the whole thing, he was much more selective. So, on a break, he decided to look through the books there and see if there was something a little more helpful. Even if it was one of those encouraging self-esteem-boosting books that would take maybe twenty minutes to read.
It was like the unmoving stars that sailors used for navigation or the sun at its zenith in the summer months when everyone thought the world would burst into fire.
“I ordered some books,” Steve gushed, gently pulling out multiple paperbacks and setting them on the counter. The editions were obviously old and second hand with cracked spines and aged pages, but he treated them like they were made of glass or gold.
“Mrs. Elison just put her foot down,” MJ said, looking back to the chemicals they were supposed to be observing. One of them was starting to turn a different color ever so slowly.
“Because if you want to, I can run a background check, look through their financials, even put JARVIS on your phone if you need an emergency ‘get me out of this bad date’ card—”
“Oh,” Steve said, a hint of a blush rising. “Well, glad you approve. Still want a cappuccino, or do you want to try something without caffeine?”
It was not the acclimation SHIELD might have wanted, but watching him chat with random people, play darts, and enjoy a beer was … nice.
“I know,” Steve whispered conspiringly back. “And Maslow’s Hierarchy has tons of criticisms, but it’s like she’s trying to convert us.”
What Tony just said did not mean all of that. He was speaking in general terms, about everyone and for everyone. Not for himself, not for him, not for their situation. Tony didn’t even know that he had a crush on him. The people he did know, who were only his closest friends, promised to keep it to themselves and not reveal anything to Tony. For all the other times they were mischievous, gossiping busybodies, this was something they respected and left alone.
“Oh, no. I’ve been getting Hanahaki Disease for like, the last two weeks. Not sure what kind of flower this is.”
“His ruts might have been suppressed due to being around other omegas,” Sam continued. “It’s been proven prolonged exposure results in less frequent and intense ruts. Suppressant medication can do the same thing, depending upon the individual biology. Any heats he might have had probably
. In that second, he knew that she was up to no good. Whatever she had found or figured out, he was done for.
Antonius’ heart skipped a beat, because he was not sure if that was the work of Hēphaistos or an example of one of the curses—
, that he didn’t have to suffer alone (or at all), but he rarely did. He was going to change the world one of these days and they couldn’t wait to see the kind of person he would become, but for now, it was a struggle to not want to put him in a bubble and destroy all of the things that had made him think he wasn’t worth time or consideration or respect.
An older gentleman dressed in a fine suit answered the door after a moment, but Steve knew that he was not the lord of the house or even close to it.
He never understood why people liked romance novels or any of those sappy movies. They always lacked a certain … aspect of reality. Namely that people who were oblivious when someone was in love with them or they kept their feelings hidden from someone else were irresponsible idiots and the ultimate jerk.
Tony was not going to let one of the best friendships of his life get totaled because he had to go and fall in love with the way his hand held a pencil or the way sunlight got caught in his hair or how he could be so stubborn and passionate and such a little—
He dared not look at it or even touch it. He knew there was scarring around it. He felt the tug and sting of the skin. He felt its weight and its warmth.
The conversation tapered off afterwards when some students came in, looking haggard and laden down with textbooks, laptops, and essays. Two promptly began arguing about the best way to move forward with a project, while another looked frustrated over what looked to be history or a literature course. The amount of books they had was criminal. For the next half hour or so, no one else came in. Business seemed to be slow, so it made sense that Steve was alone.
Tony shook his head. “No, I just got away from the goons. Your plan isn’t bad, but they have eyes on your guys already. You need to extract them. They have heat-seeking missiles at the ready.”
Tony hoped that when this was over and Steve was in his right mind again, they could talk and smooth over any lingering hurt feelings. Tony knew Steve would be mortified about his behavior if he wasn’t already. Maybe that was why he was still holing himself up in his room.
It did not take them too long to get all of the papers printed out and filled out again. Steve kept meticulous and detailed records, with dates in the file names and easy to identify folders. Tony marveled at it, because the only thing organized in his life were the cabinets in his workshop, and that was only because no one wanted to accidentally grab a wrench when they needed a hammer.
Before he knew it, he was somehow dressed and already in front of the coffee shop. Someone like him should be sick of the scent of coffee, tired of seeing the same place nearly every day, but Tony found himself drawn to the shop. It was cozy. It felt like home. He knew that he was welcomed and known here, despite his last name. He knew the floorboards, for god’s sake.
They had long been his favorite, ever since he out grew flowers like daisies and dandelions most kids liked, at least until they learned about other flowers.
The walk there, though fairly quick, took a little too long. It was like they hit every single crosswalk.
“I’ve heard not a lot of people like medication,” Ned added. “How is it working for you? Is that okay to ask?”
“That’s it,” Steve replied with a nod. “I didn’t know you knew about SHIELD or HYDRA. I knew you were a brilliant inventor, but who doesn’t? I have no idea how you all created everything you did in the time I was asleep.”
“The hardest part is over,” Tony said softly as Peter took a seat in a desk next to him. It was a little awkward, seeing so many adults sitting in desks meant for kids, but a smaller ‘stage’ made more of the kids comfortable and was easier to manage too. “You did great.”
She loved him, of course, but it was a complicated and non-romantic way. They were a thing, once upon a time, but it settled into something more like ‘dumbass king’ and ‘long-suffering advisor’, with Rhodey as the one person who could emphasize with her. Bruce was head over heels with Betty, but thank goodness their love wasn’t unrequited. Just a little star-crossed, until General Dickhead got his head out of his ass and stopped trying to get Bruce fired.
He texted Sam, who laughed and offered to bring some cold medicine next time they met up for movie night. Steve’s reply was not appropriate for work.
Peter quickly took a bite of his ice cream and suffered a mild brain freeze in his attempt to avoid the question. They had gone to one of their favorite ice cream shops that had all sorts of amazing flavors. Peter predictably got the one that was blended with all sorts of breakfast cereals. Tony decided to go for a simple dark chocolate.
The lunch turned out to be just what Tony needed: a good old fashioned break with good food and even better company. They avoided talking shop as much as possible, but they were in the library breakroom. Fellow librarians occasionally came in and out, taking their own breaks, and muttering about late fees, damaged books, and politics.
“Well. That’s okay. I mean, no one knows for sure if ADHD is genetic. I just … noticed some stuff, but it looks like you got it handled? I’m sorry, I’m probably making this worse.”
Exiting the car, Tony kept a hand on Peter’s shoulder, glad that he hadn’t hit a growth spurt yet. Some of Peter’s peers were
“Fine, I’ll come,” Pepper sighed, still plugging away at her phone. Probably answering emails, facilitating meetings, and basically keeping the company from bursting into flames.
It was like he had insulted Steve’s mother. Like he had insulted a sacred institution. Tony scrambled to come up with something,
best things in my life. You are wicked intelligent, you don’t take crap from anyone, keep me on my toes, and always make me smile. You’ve given me so many more reasons to wake up in the morning, and god, you’ve given me friends beyond people I met through SI. Speaking of that, just in case you forgot, there are half a dozen people out in the living room who would kick my ass if I broke up with you just because you’re an alpha and I would be the first one. Maybe second, if Bucky fights me for that honor. So, just to say it again, I love you and that is not going to change no matter what else does.”
Steve was the one who noticed why Peter was struggling and reached out to help. He was the one who defended him and worked with him these last few months, pulling out all the stops. Because of his efforts, Peter was flourishing. He was coming back home, excited to tell Tony about his day and the things they learned, what they were working on, and was no longer panicking when he couldn’t understand something or focus long enough on a question. He was still hyperactive at times, and could be forgetful, but Tony was giving him some leeway with that, as he wasn’t even a teenager yet. He had plenty of time to learn, adapt, and develop healthy habits.
Tony refused to inch back or even blink. “They proved that torture only makes people say what their captors want them to say. Anything to stop the pain.”
were my courting attempts. They just didn’t turn out well. Like the pie. The one I managed to not burn did a faceplant on the sidewalk.”
“Yeah, it’s the weirdest thing,” Bucky said, clearly frustrated and worried. “All the times he’s been sick, he’s been a grumbly, needy thing. Now this is like—I don’t know!”
“It’s like …” He trailed off. His brain was going somewhere, but wasn’t telling him the final destination yet. “It’s like—”
and knew Tony was feeling a little more like himself because he gasped in horror at the sight of Steve pulling out an old VHS tape from the 90s.
“What is this, twenty questions? Just guess.” She called out some names and handed off the drinks, saying thanks when needed. Especially when someone put money in the tip jar.
“Tell—tell Rhodey. Bruce too. If something happens, get him out of here. Call Betty. JARVIS, make backup copies of this. Put it with our evidence against—against Stane. Start looking for others who might have been in on this.”
It was another after-hour’s night, which was starting to become more regular, and not just because he and Steve were officially dating. Pepper was growing worried about his lack of sleep again. So was everyone else, but he was just too restless.
It turned out that the early 2000s had no idea what ADHD was really like. Especially those little comics that probably took someone five minutes to come up with and post.
Even though she looked perfectly immaculate, there were bags under her eyes. Tony hoped that she wasn’t worrying about him again, or that he would pull off another stupid stunt.
“The weathermen lied,” Tony mumbled. “What’s worse is that Happy’s stuck in traffic. Where he is, he could make it to my office in time, but to get here and then to SI? Nope.”
Being away from a partner for an extended amount of time was hard enough, but that was why Pepper planned this trip around Steve’s heat schedule. It was the general thing to do to prevent this exact kind of situation, but surprises happened. Day or two early kind of surprises, though. Not a
The picture was clearly something from school with a mottled gray background, but as he stared, Tony saw the resemblance. It was slight. He probably took after his mother’s side of the family with the pale skin, round face, and light brown hair … but … Peter had his grandmother’s smile.
“So, what is this meeting about? I got the note, but it was kind of vague beyond some of the issues Peter has been having his classes.”
“Okay! Okay! But I demand to be read my rights! You can’t just kidnap someone and force them to do something for you. That’s just in the movies.”
He owed her flowers. A room full of flowers, even though she begged him to never, ever do that again.
, he had not been turned into a cat. No, for some reason, someone thought he should become a squirrel.
Doom Bots were everywhere, causing mayhem and destruction with broken windows, cracked sidewalks, and bent lamp posts. Cars had been tossed around and people were being led away by police officers. A fire truck was already on the scene, putting out a fire. Sam was keeping Doom Bots at bay, allowing the firefighters to contain the flames before they could spread from the car in the street to something like the apartments not too far off.
“Sure thing. So, why do you look like you two just rolled out of bed? Or, in Tony’s case, out from under a car?”
“Before we begin, I would like to state that I want to stick to the facts and see if we can find a resolution, rather than dish out punishments.”
Steve quickly finished wiping down the counter and threw the damp rag on his shoulder. “I’d like to talk to him before I dole out anything.”
The thoughts surrounding all this had consumed him for three days, causing him to reschedule meetings, post pone some development projects, and basically cause headaches for everyone around him. Even JARVIS seemed to be a bit annoyed, even though he understood that sometimes Tony had to act like a hermit to get his head back on straight again.
Honestly, seeing Tony so vulnerable helped a lot. Once he calmed down himself, he started to notice major differences between Tony and other alphas he had come across in his life. Not that he had many experiences with an alpha in an unexpected rut, but he knew plenty of alphas who became more aggressive shortly before and during them. Tony hadn’t acted like that at all. He hoped that he really would be alright by tomorrow. When he was younger, his heats would do pretty much the same thing to him, but for about a week.
He made sure the air was being filtered within an inch of its life, researched everything someone needed to do when dealing with a fungal infection, and rubbed Steve’s back when Bucky gave a very worried, scathing phone call. He got blankets and tea and had prescriptions delivered. If there was anything he could possibly do to help, by god, Tony was going to do it.
Before it could turn into a full on brawl, and ruin the suit that made Steve look very, very alluring, Tony grabbed him by the elbow, shouted out some sort of ‘gotta go bye!’ and closed the door.
As much as he tried not to think about it, the attack during his Jericho demonstration and kidnapping was suspicious. How did someone know to attack
That was when he realized other people had just returned to the cave. Everyone seemed to be around the same age, which was unusual in a clan. None of them seemed to look related to one another either, which was even odder. They were dressed in various wraps, shawls, and cloaks made out of skins and more of that finely woven wool. It seemed to be warmer than the material he was dressed in, with horizontal and vertical lines crossing over one another to create a variety of patterns and colors. With how cold it seemed to be, Antonius wondered if he was further north, where the seasonal weather could be bitterer than the oceanic lands he knew.
Steve chuckled, a little sadly. “We stuck together in the slums through the war. Why not some ice? He was off a few hundred feet, but thank goodness for thermal scanners.”
“Can’t find a better cure for anything,” Steve swore. “Not even if your medical team spent the next hundred years doing nothing else but looking for cures.”
Tony grinned and gave him a quick kiss. “Later. When you’re off work and I’ve cleared some stuff and we’re scot free.”
Thor blinked slowly at them and Steve felt like he had missed something huge. “Stephen, what do you think pining consists of?”
Tony looked down at his tablet, where he was redesigning the armor to not frost after reaching certain altitudes. Sure, JARVIS could easily pull the research and crunch the numbers, but he wanted to do more of it himself and have JARVIS just double check his work. If he was going to screw up, he wanted to screw up personally.
He wanted to rush over to where Obie was and punch his face in. He wanted his blood on his hands and his brains on the floor. He wanted him to be put on trial and have to personally sign checks to the families of everyone he had ever had a hand in killing.
Peter and Tony both looked over their shoulders to see Mr. Rogers coming down the parking lot. It took him little time to reach them and he wasn’t the slightest out of breath.
“He’s only in the form of a dog,” Natasha said, not looking up from her tablet as she typed away on it. Or, from the look of concentration, she might have been playing a game.
“No, you’re right. Doing this ritual is old fashioned, ultimately doesn’t prove a thing, and just perpetuates all sorts of harmful stereotypes and aspects of our culture. However, ignoring all of that, it comes down to an alpha and omega being able to express interest and consent to one another without all of the usual courtship trappings or social expectations. If I could, I would make that the everyday experience, but one step at a time.”
They walked down the hallway until they found another stairwell door and continued going up from there. As they got further away from where the bomb went off, the damaged decreased. Looked like it was localized to that corner of the building, but man, was it going to be a mess, trying to clean up everything and bring it back up to code again.
Real life was, oddly, kinder than the comics. Bucky was obviously not some mascot kid, tagging around because he saw Captain America without his mask, though he was just as loyal and dedicated. He hadn’t died during the plane crash and was never captured by HYDRA scientists.
Tony felt like he had been punched in the gut and wanted to argue, but Sam was a therapist. He knew his stuff when it came to human behavior in general. If he said this might be a rut, then there was a pretty good chance he was right. Like in the ninety-five percent chance range.
The music got dramatic all of the sudden. He and Steve looked back to see a shadow of Moriarty growing along the wall of a staircase until he appears in Sherlock’s parlor room, where Sherlock was slowly inching his way to a corner, a gun already drawn.
“Okay, who spoiled it for him?” Tony demanded. He and Clint might not have been subtle about there being a reveal, but it wasn’t as if they could have guessed! “Who told them the secret?”
Tony sighed. “Alright, alright. I concede. But let me know if I can send a lawyer your way, pro bono or something.”
There were different forms, like the kind that made it hard for children to physically keep still when needed and another form that made it hard for children to focus for long lengths of time. Girls and boys were affected differently. As they grew, the symptoms could change. Scientists and doctors suspected there were more adults out there with ADHD than people realized because by the time they got into the workforce, whatever they weren’t diagnosed with was ‘normal’ to them and why would they seek medical help for something they didn’t think they had?
Squinting and cursing his past self for not turning down the brightness on his phone, Steve flopped back onto his pillows and blankets when he saw it was Tony.
So when he started coughing and sneezing more than usual, he didn’t think much about it. It was spring and everything was blooming. It was an unavoidable risk with the changing of the seasons. He wondered, briefly, if it might be that annoying Hanahaki Disease some people got, but dismissed it. Even though there were many, many romance novels about how people would find that special someone thanks to the non-consensual petals being sneezed up like they were at a wedding (another trope romance novels loved), it was also common knowledge that Hanahaki Disease could and often did express all kinds of love.
“If you want to create this, we will help you. It is just that we have never seen such a thing, save for in stories that some of the traders tell us of. We thought it was a fantasy.”
It had been a few days since that horrible situation with the love letters. He had managed to brush off most of his embarrassment and not think about it. The love letters were now safely in the back of his closet where only dust would find them.
Tony inched his way some feet, holding his breath the entire time. Nothing seemed to give way as he continued on.
When he came in, it was testimony to how late (or early) it was because no one else was there and the lights were turned down low. The front door was still unlocked and he knew Steve well enough by now, so coming in shouldn’t be too much of an intrusion.
Steve laughed, open and loud. “God, I hope not! Though that might have been easier to adjust to. Do you know how much the world has changed in seventy years? Miss Lamarr would be impressed with how far you’ve taken her spread-spectrum techniques.”
Maybe that was why he ended up on Steve’s doorstep. He was heading there anyways and it was close by. He knew it was somewhere safe too.
Shem’el had spoken against a corrupt chieftain in his homeland, which was south of the Land of the Riverbank across the Great Sea as Antonius first suspected. He had been thrown into a jail chamber and tortured for weeks, but he refused to retract his accusations. Every night, he prayed to the gods for justice and freedom for his people, but they remained silent. Just as he was about thrown onto a pyre to be burned alive, his gods gave him a pair of ruby wings to carry him away. He flew and flew, until he arrived on this island as well.
He realized, half way up the stairs, he was not fully awake to really appreciate that he was behind the counter. Sure, it was a little childish, but there was still a kind of thrill towards going places that were restricted in some way. This was not only behind the counter of the coffee shop, but also where Steve
“So, I’m back in the Tower?” he asked. God, he hoped he was. He could tell that he was naked under the sheets of his bed and he did not want to know how that happened. “Wait! Where’s my suit!”
In the echoing silence, Tony heard someone’s footsteps approach the closet before pausing right in front of it. He held his breath, looking at their shadows on the floor. The supply closet was small and cramped, stuffed with all sorts of things. He took a few steps back. His hand came across something cold and metal. It wasn’t attached to anything. The door slowly opened.
now. It was a long-standing tradition where on one night a year, an omega could steal their alphas, to prove that they were on equal footing as their alpha counterparts. There were all sorts of ways this was taken, from proposing to an alpha to the much more common literal kidnapping of an alpha.
“Oh, shit.” Clint’s voice echoed a bit, so he clearly had a visual on Tony, but not the reverse. “They were serious about that? You’re really a squirrel?”
They were still chatting when Steve came in, giving Natasha a wave as she headed off for the day. Bucky was due in half an hour and Sam was finished with the last of the day’s baking, and from the sound of the pots and pans in the back, tomorrow’s preparation too. No, he did not know all of their schedules like clockwork. He just figured out some signs of who would come when and when someone was done with their shift based on what they did. It was logical.
Tony kept reading. “This is way better than some of that drivel that is currently in the romance section. Are you anywhere near done? Looked into a publisher?”
“It’s okay, I promise,” Tony said, trying to channel his inner Pepper. “We’ll figure out what is going on. We’re all out here. Between the six of us—”
He wasn’t sure if his feelings were stemming from relief and gratitude towards Steve’s efforts to help Peter, or if because he genuinely liked the man. They had yet to interact outside of a school setting, had yet to have a conversation that wasn’t about Peter. Teaching might be his job (or maybe even his calling), but Steve was a complete person outside of being a teacher. He at least deserved someone appreciating him for all of his facets.
Showing Captain America a pivotal piece of American culture? Yeah, he would fight tooth and nail for the chance to see him react to the Darth Vader Luke Skywalker Connection.
“Oh my—what the hell? Are these covered in—?” Bucky yelled, brushing the blue and yellow petals off him.
His whole body ached. He wanted nothing more than to curl up somewhere and not move ever again. If he did not move, if he did not do anything, then he would not create. Tools would not be abused and people would not suffer. He wanted to sink back into darkness and blissful cold, but this was the realm of the gods. If they did not want him to linger, he could not. They had shown him mercy and it would be foolish to incur their wrath by not listening to them.
“Beats paying rent in two places. Some people would say there’s a few lines crossed, but me, Sam, and Bucky got it worked out since we’re all equal partners.”
“Yeah, underestimating villains are for newcomers,” Rhodey scolded. “You know this. How many cartoons did you make me watch when you were a teenager?”
Since they were kids, Bucky was used to taking care of Steve and standing up for him. Not that Steve didn’t do that for himself already, but the two of them had a brotherly bond that went beyond sub-genders and what society said alpha-omega relationships should be like. They, as they said, were with each other until the end of the line. For Steve to push Bucky away when he was trying to help must have smarted.
She was dirty and tired, but grinning with pride. Everyone else was proud as well, as this stag would add to their winter stores considerably and provide some more hide to make clothes and water skins with. Fresh water was abundant in these lands, with the many rivers and frequent rains, but it was difficult at times to go the river when the mud was thick and cold. Antonius was finding himself wanting to stay in the caves and near the fire on such days, listening to stories and keeping his feet wrapped in a wool blanket.
Steve was definitely going through a rut. Tony wished they had seen the signs sooner—how competitive Steve could sometimes get, how he was more likely to punch someone than try to talk it out, and a dozen other details that was more typical of alphas. They were idiots for assuming just because he was small and sickly that he was an omega. It made him wonder if Steve ever wondered about that himself. It never came up in their ‘relationship conversations’, not that they had many of those to begin with. Maybe they should have.
“Oh god, that’s hot,” Tony said, his voice full of awe. “Handwritten letters, damn. And here I thought it was a book you were writing. See? Oblivious. What did I do to deserve you? To even catch your eye?”
Tony was personally excited for the coffee festival and their version of Comic Con, though he really could attend
Natasha flicked her eyes up from her book. “Knowledge is power. Never underestimate even the most random of facts.”
Tony gave him an amused look. The discussion between which was better, the Dewey Decimal system or the genre section, had yet to be resolved. “Come on.”
But when one of them, a woman with shocking red hair, pointed at the strange material that was now in the center of his chest, Antonius quickly covered it with his hands.
What else would be revealed as they continued? What else would he learn? Did he leave the dishes in the sink to be washed at the end of the day instead of putting them in the dishwasher right away like a normal human? Did he always lose a sock? What kind of foods did he hate? What were his 3 AM cravings? Did he sleep like a rock or did he toss and turn?
Third, Steve had wrapped it around his neck. Carefully and with consideration, making sure it wasn’t too tight or loose, didn’t leave a gap at the base of his neck, and was tucked in just right. Once or twice during that maybe ten second exchange, Steve’s fingers brushed up against his bare skin and it sent his heart skipping along a flower-filled meadow.
Pepper rolled her eyes. “You’re not the only one raving about that place, Tony. I’ve had at least two dozen other employees sing its praises.”
Tony stood up, tucked the helmet under his arm and headed down to the workshop with a focus he’d thought he would never have again.
“Thanks. It’s a less processed sugar, has more flavor. It’s becoming more popular, but my ma always said she missed it while I was growing up.”
A combination of medicine, some therapy sessions, and comforting rituals like movie nights—and a rut tracker application on his phone—negated so much of what would be a miserable experience every month. Actually knowing what was going on and what triggered some of the worse instincts was a miracle too. He hated feeling possessive, territorial, and grouchy. No one deserved to be snapped at by him just because his hormones were going out of whack.
Tony blanched. “What? About what? I don’t need another visit from the men in black, I had enough of that already!”
His hands were shaking. Even sitting down, his knees were buckling. So much for fleeing—he’d trip and kill himself in an attempt. God, his face was probably completely red.
series. Steve was really going back in time. These stories were the foundations of science fiction, the stuff that led to
Their professor stopped her lecture mid-sentence. “Is there anything you’d like to add to the discussion?”
The commotion brought out Steve from the back, who was covered in flour and wiping his hands. Tony briefly wondered if kneading dough gave him those muscles or if he spent his time at the gym when he wasn’t making the best cappuccino in the world.
a classic movie. There was a diner a few blocks away from the coffee shop, one of those places that seemed to exist forever and somehow never seem dated. The tile floors were glossy, there was neon in the jukebox, and the menu was horribly expansive. Tony was tempted to ask for a chocolate malt with two straws to complete the picture, but that felt like teasing.
“Brilliant,” Tony gasped. “That is why I am gonna make you CEO, Pep, you come up with the best ideas. You can talk to the toaster, take the guesswork out of all the buttons and everything. It can tell you when it needs its crumb catchers cleaned, rather than smoke filling—”
Tony looked unimpressed. “It’s only because you work with kids that I don’t tease you for knowing that reference.”
Steve sighed and leaned down, kissing him softly. Tony sighed into it, realizing that he was stiff and sore, but oh, was kissing Steve like a soothing balm.
“…probably,” Tony finally said, his shoulders sagging and his hands stilling. “You had to have gotten it from somewhere, but I don’t know about your mom’s medical history. But I’ve been doing a lot of thinking since you’ve been diagnosed.”
Bucky ruffled his hair. “Like Sam said, payback for all the times we coughed up flowers because of you.”
Carol came over, sighing. “I still can’t believe her father is being such a jackass. I mean, how often do you find a literal genius who spends his day taking care of sick people? I know a hundred fathers who would want their daughters—hell, any of their kids—to marry Bruce.”
It had been a few years since he had originally come to these lands and now, he could not bear the thought of ever parting from them. He still thought of his friends and wondered whatever became of them, as much as he grew to love the friends he had made here. The forge had grown and expanded more than it ever could in Thrinacia. He was allowed to design what he wanted, use what resources he could find, and more often than not, he made items that allowed people to perform their duties more easily and protect each other from the dangerous wilds.
“You are amazing,” Tony repeated. “Absolutely amazing. I don’t care about what alphas or omegas are supposed to be like. Screw that. Throw the book out. I’m just oblivious, okay? Sometimes I need someone to spell something out for me before I get it.”
Even though the man was covered in oil stains and grease, looking like he came from some factory, the apartment was practically luxurious. It was like something from a magazine selling furniture in the latest styles or a romance novel that Jane Austen had written. For instance, a wood table was placed next to a window with sheet curtains. Nothing was on it, but Steve could imagine putting a vase of flowers in the center of it and capturing the sunlight—
“Yeah,” Steve agreed. “Twenty-six minutes is a lot of time to fill in those blanks, but the romance seemed really weird. Almost forced.”
“Besides them all thinking I was unconscious for about an hour, my father was Howard Stark. You don’t think one of the original members of SHIELD wouldn’t keep records somewhere? Records his insanely curious kid could potentially break into?”
Clint shushed them as he got up and draped a blanket around Peter’s shoulders. “No arguing. Only the soothing power of Disney.”
If the situation were not so serious, he was sure Tony would quip that this was cliché. Kidnapping a king from a locked tower, though it lacked a dragon.
Sam thought for a moment. “Usually alphas go through their first ruts when they’re much younger. The drive to mate is not as intense as it can be when they’re older, but by the time that happens, they’re closer to being adults. I’d say just make sure he’s physically comfortable and do what we can to make him feel safe. He’s not quite himself right now.”
Sometimes, there was a process long before that: having to gather certain roots, leaves, berries, bark, or even entire branches; drying them out or boiling them, grinding and mashing, mixing with other materials, straining and leaving to dry in the sun …
Tony was very, very proud that he asked her about which of Sam’s muffins were the best, instead of focusing on why Steve was worrying about him and how often he voiced his concerns that Natasha started to get annoyed by it.
Pepper commented that they should have known he would have used the suit; he didn’t build something for it to be shoved in a corner and forgotten.
Perhaps someone was just simply migrating into the area? Or performing a pilgrimage to the burial chamber? He squinted his eyes to see better before he—
Steve couldn’t help but look away again, his stomach churning at Tony’s bold words. He felt embarrassed, exposed. He didn’t look at Tony again until Tony reached up and cupped his face with both hands, turning his head back slightly.
“Thank you,” Captain America said gratefully, before giving information to the person on the other side of the com. “Okay. They have a pickup on their way. ETA five minutes.”
He closed his eyes and tried to separate the image that was Captain America and the human being that was Steve Rogers. It was going to take a while. He was going to have a lot of doubts and questions. There would be arguments and miscommunication. He was going to say something to screw this all up, have everything explode in their faces. It was inevitable. He was Tony Stark.
. This close, he could see the dark blue around the very edges of his irises and the tiny flecks of green in his left eye. He could see the way his hair was getting a little long, long enough that Tony wanted to brush back the strands that were falling across his forehead.
“No,” Tony answered. “That would take too long, but I figured you guys would want intel on their mad, evil schemes. So I have it on a secure server.”
Pausing only when someone came up to the counter in need of help for one thing or another, Tony filled him in on the details of his trip to California where he worked on some projects at the R&D Department of Stark Industries. Trips where he worked with one department or another were only over weekends and holidays, given the school’s strict attendance policy, but it was a better idea than throwing Tony into a CEO position when his father stepped down. At least he would be prepared and have some idea of how the company worked when that happened, as if Tony hadn’t already researched all he could about their practices and business methods.
. Unless he passed by Bruce without seeing him? Was he that oblivious whenever Steve came into the room? Did the others talk about him when he wasn’t there? Was Bruce psychic?
How long had it been since someone had not seen his father’s face and remembered his wrath and prowess at battle? How long had it been since someone had not seen his mother’s eyes and wondered what happened to her and her wealth? How long had it been since someone had not looked at him and only saw something to be controlled and used?
Alpha Night was supposed to be about equality and a ton of other feel good adjectives, but with results like that? It was just plain demeaning.
But as he worked, other things filtered into his mind: the way some of his higher ups and heads of departments were a little jumpy; how Obie was behaving since he came back. It was like someone knew something and they weren’t telling him.
Even if it took him forever, Tony would constantly do his best to make sure he never, ever gave Peter a reason to doubt his love for him or think he would be given back to the system.
As he continued to cough up more daisies and violets (who knew the flowers could repeat themselves?) Tony thought.
Steve was sure he looked annoyed, but it was hard when he just felt so much love and fondness for Tony. Getting a marriage license,
Tony, on the other hand, made sure to only keep informed of the matters. He kind of got the ‘hands off you’ll never amount to anything like him’ message early on. But when word got around that someone was messing around with vita radiation and had poked into some old archives that were still supposed to be classified? Well. That was different.
And so, that was how he spent his entire morning in a back corner, watching Steve, Sam, and Bucky work, occasionally joining in on their constant teasing of each other and trying to guess their specials in vain. By the time the sun started to rise and bring in other customers, Tony had two cups of coffee and an ‘orange blossom muffin’. Sam claimed it was healthier than other muffins because it had actual orange slices and cranberries, but Tony tasted the butter in it.
The nearby forests also held many foods to be foraged. He did not recognize many of the plants that were in it. They were all leafier, cool to the touch. He left gathering those plants up to Shem’el and Stiofán. The last thing he wanted to do was accidentally pick a fatal flower. It was also not wise to go into the forest alone, even in the afternoon. He heard wolves howling the first night he had slept in the cave with the rest of the clan. He had not heard wolves in a long time, so protected in the highly organized and developed village he had been born in.
Only Stiofán and his friends lived in the cave, guarding the small village that held the rest of their families in the small valley below them. They made frequent visits to the many huts made of reed and straw there, helping with the communal fields or larger tasks that a single person or family unit could not do alone. The burial mound was a half hour’s walk to the north and the sea laid beyond the village about half a day’s journey away to the east.
“Well, we have our heats and ruts here all the time,” Sam said as he stirred his curry. “Dunno why he would go all the way to our apartment though.”
“No, don’t apologize,” Tony said, pulling him over to a long couch placed against a wall with three or four small workstations in front of it. “Steve, look at me, darling. Whoever made you feel like that is an
