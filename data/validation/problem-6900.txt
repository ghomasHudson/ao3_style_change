Steve turned his head to the noise, flexing against the restraints on his hands. “Tony,” was the first thing that came out of his mouth, the word choked off and horrified, “what did I do? What did I- is he… Did I-”
Tony smiled at him, his eyes drifting shut as the late hour compelled him to sleep. It was nearly two in the morning, by that point—and it seemed Steve noticed as much, because he squeezed his hand on Tony’s hip and dipped down a little lower. “Hey. Happy Halloween so far?”
Tony doesn’t even think about shutting it down. It’s the only thing that keeps him sane, some nights. Knowing that he still has that; that tiny semblance of control. That even if he can’t ultimately stop his friends if they are hellbent on it; he can do his damn hardest to get to them before it gets to that point.
"He tried to bite me earlier," Clint called out, "he's got like, two teeth, but it still hurt. I think he thinks we're food."
“Steve, please- I’m okay, Tony’s okay, Thor’s got him. You gotta get back in the room- Tony’s fine. He’s okay. He’ll be back in less than a minute.”
“And the team are going to come barging up here with pitchforks unless we hurry up,” Steve interrupted, throwing on a shirt and smiling as he crossed the room and jumped back on the bed, crawling over to Tony and covering his face with kisses, despite the man’s giggling protests.
Steve rolled his eyes- of course that was what they’d start with. Was he ever going to be able to go a day without something popping up about him? “No, you’re not allowed to ask,” he told him, “because we’re just friends-“
He spun on his heel, looking at Tony through narrowed eyes as he threw his hands in the air. “Jesus, Tony, I don’t need to have spoken to him to hate him- do you even remember what you told me on Saturday? I think that’s reason enough! And, you know, the fucking… degrading way he speaks about you doesn’t fucking help his case either, Jesus, you should have just let me fucking swing at him.”
The social service workers had the gall to look surprised, and for a moment Tony wondered whether he’d jumped to the wrong conclusion. That would be rather embarrassing. Luckily – or
But no matter how hard he tried, nothing came up. The most he got was the briefest of flashes, like images through a cloud of smoke, hazy and unable to be properly grasped. His hands clenched down hard against the side of the table and he felt sweat form at the back of his neck from the energy he was exerting, but to no avail. It wouldn’t fucking come.
They’d disabled JARVIS. Tony was going to guess at a blanket EMP, which would only work for a few minutes before JARVIS’ systems rebooted, but even then, it would only be basic functions that came online. He wouldn’t be able to establish communication with anyone for another twenty minutes or so.
They arrived back home fifteen minutes later, and Steve was put on chores as soon as he stepped foot in the house. He completed them all meekly, trying to figure out how best he was going to make it up to Mr and Mrs Wilson. Sam had always been a good kid at school- Steve figured they probably weren’t used to rulebreakers, and he felt terrible for having to let them down like that. At least with his own mom, she’s been sort of used to it at that point.
His friends had to have started wondering where he was, by that point. He’d been half an hour, which was ten minutes late. Maybe they’d go out and look for him. Maybe they’d find him in a few hours.
Sam, who had been busy on his phone a second ago, suddenly piped up. “He as good in bed as everyone says he is?”
With nothing else to do, Steve just nodded slowly. Seemingly satisfied, Peter uncrossed his arms and then started backing away, saluting Steve as he went. “Gotta get back or I’ll miss Reed blowing a gasket when Tony calls him an unimaginative cretin in French!” He said, skipping down the halls.
Steve snarled, lashing his head forward and actually managing to brain one of them. “Fuck off- Tony Stark is an asshole,” he told them- the same thing he told everyone, because it was true-
-Only to be jolted awake again a second later with an uncomfortable slam against his chest, gasping for glorious oxygen as his heart suddenly kicked into gear. With a wild panic, his hand flew up to his chest to check for empty space, but instead his fingers met with someone else’s. Following the hands to wrist to arm to shoulder, he eventually came back to Steve’s face, pale and shaken and staring at Tony in a mixture of panic and relief. He must have put it back in.
Steve just gave him a long look, stroking the hair from his eyes and letting his thumb linger across the outline of his cheekbone.
Licking his lips and steeling himself, he stopped walking just as he reached the bench, and then slowly sat down next to Tony. The bags made a big noise; crinkling and nearly spilling over Tony’s feet, and Steve winced. The whole mystery and smoothness of the situation was being ruined by his groceries.
Twenty minutes later and dinner was served for real this time, Tony grumbling to himself as he leaned into Steve’s side on the couch and  bounced Maria up and down on his lap, all of them watching another round of My Little Pony, which Maria seemed to have taken a shine to for whatever reason. Steve had tried to introduce to her the cartoons he’d seen when he was a kid, once, but she’d regarded them with such a look of disdain that Tony had burst out into hysterical laughter and Steve had admitted that it was probably a tad dated for her, being the daughter of one of the most technologically advanced minds on the planet and all.
Steve squeezed down on the gauntlet and copied the thoughts, amplified them between himself and Tony, Light exploded around them, a white so bright that Steve could see nothing apart from it, and he screamed in an agony he couldn’t even describe, thinking about Maria and Tony and their boat on the lake, and how they’d be able to go there soon, if this didn’t work out.
“Well that’s a lie, you’re gonna be riding over to mine without one, aren’t you?” Steve grumbled, taking his hand and pulling him over to the door of Bucky’s place. “I’m gonna glue the thing onto your head while your sleeping next time, I swear to God.”
Steve tried to process that in his head, but it didn’t quite work out. Tony laughed quietly, grabbing the glass of water from the table and then wafting it under Steve’s nose. “It does help. And then once that’s down you, you should get gone, alright? You shouldn’t be here.”
Thor grunted in approval, shuffling up the couch and then picking Peter up before standing and following Tony. “I think he missed you,” Thor commented, and Tony felt himself stiffen.
But he’d called Rhodey. And Rhodey said he was… that he was happy. That definitely meant something, and Steve knew Rhodey wouldn’t lie about that. Or march into his home and dole out thinly veiled threats to him if this wasn’t a least a little bit serious.
He heard their murmurs behind him. “That’s good,” Thor said earnestly, “I’m glad to hear it. Did you have a good time away?”
Bouncing up and down on his toes, Tony grinned at him, leaning into his chest and kissing him quick while copping a feel, of course, because when Steve was naked Tony was not just going to
“Tony?” Steve’s voice drifted through his train of thought, the edge of excitement fading and turning into concern when he finally clocked the look on Tony’s face. “You okay?”
Steve was silent for a moment, wincing as Tony cleaned up the blood over his cheek. “Heard of APA?” He asked, and when Tony didn’t answer and instead just cocked his head, Steve continued. “They’re a pacifist organisation, known for attempting to break & enter or vandalise Army bases.”
“I don’t care,” Steve made his feet take steps. They brought him to the door. “I just need you to tell them I am at home. That’s an order.”
“So, we know the sides of the right-angled triangles are given special names, obviously, hypotenuse, adjacent, etcetera ectera. Just to start us off, how would you guys work out the angle YZ?”
He clenched his jaw and then unbuttoned Steve’s shirt, exposing his chest as he pressed the frame of the reactor against his skin. Feeling sweat begin to form on his face from the stress, he pressed his thumb into the back of the casing, setting off an electric impulse in the reactor. There was a flash of light and Steve’s body jolted unnaturally, Tony himself being thrown backward by the force. He rolled back up quickly though and then pressed his heart against Steve’s neck. Still nothing.
Steve leaned against the counter nearby, folding his arms and smiling in bemusement as he watched Thor rush off into the corner of the room, grab a long pillow from one of the windowsills, and then toss it over to Clint, who caught it easily and then pushed it into a crack in the apparent mound of pillows, blankets and bits of furniture. Peggy was stood on the coffee table, pointing people to places and eating a pack of chips with her spare hand. Then there was Clint and Tony, both on their knees and adding various blankets and pillows to the pyramid. Natasha was nowhere to be seen, but Steve would bet his bottom dollar that he’d find her inside the mound, with a pile of snacks, watching the TV as it played
The boy in question was staring back, not even attempting to seem nonchalant by that point. His face was hard. “You know what, Steve?” He began, stepping forward. The hallway went quieter still, and Steve saw people stop walking to look at them both.
“I know,” Tony rolled his eyes and stroked his fingers along Steve’s face lightly, pushing his hair behind his ear as he smiled, “idiots, huh? Although to be fair, I'm not the only one who acted strange and irrational,” he argued, raising an eyebrow as he said "I was initially confused as to what your goal was when you came and joined me and- uh- Helen? No, wait, Helena, in the hall earlier this week- but now it does seem to make a little more sense."
“Are we taking your bike?” Steve asked, the tinge of excitement filling his voice as they both made their way down the corridor and into the kitchen, where Tony opened the door and then stepped outside. THe look on his face told Steve he knew exactly what he was thinking.
. “Steve, please don’t start doing that. Don’t be like… Please. It’s not… it’s not what it’s cut out to be, I swear. Please- please don’t.”
Whatever- at least homework didn’t seem to be making him want to jump out the fucking window anymore, which sure was great!
And in another universe, Tony would waver. He would agree, and then he would kiss Steve’s tear-tracks and work out a way to fix this, to let them be together, the way they had been in the beginning. They would live true to their whispered promises in darkened rooms and stay with one another forever- because the only way Steve would be able to stomach eternity was when it was Tony who was taking him through it.
“You’re going to lie, aren’t you?” Steve interrupted before he could bother, and he wasn’t even angry, really- just confused as hell. Tony always made him
Pulling out his phone again, he tried Peggy’s number one last desperate time. Only for it to go straight to voicemail, of course.
Tony sighed. He wished he felt more irritated about it all, but in reality, he didn’t. He was aware enough of his own bullshit to realise that his anger was just misplaced sadness, and his reticence now was pretty fucking translucent, too. He felt glad. He was glad that he had an excuse to keep Peter in their room at night, to be the one that Peter reached for, to celebrate any other milestones they were lucky enough to witness. He wanted that. And never in a million years had Tony ever thought he’d even consider that; not even a month ago, all this had felt like nothing more than a temporary scenario. A funny little game of make-believe, where they’d all played happy family and Tony had pretended Peter’s last name was ‘Rogers-Stark’ whilst in reality Steve had hidden in the corner every time Peter had gone near him.
Steve turned his head back down, grinning as Tony pushed his way through the doors and walked over to him. “I don’t know, Stark, are you gonna ruin the mood? I mean, you’re already ruining the view,” he looked pointedly over Tony’s shoulder as the man leaned over him from his place on the deckchair atop the roof of the Avengers Tower.
“You think they’re gonna be okay?” He asked Steve, “I mean… Peter’s pretty fussy. He might not get any sleep at all tonight, and then his whole routine will get messed up—”
Bucky looked warily at Steve, who just sort of flailed his hands helplessly. “I was literally gone for a second,” he stuck up a finger, “
Steve took another moment to just stare at the mess of a scene in front of him- and then without another word, he turned and marched away.
“Help me out in my useless attempts to try and get him to notice me?” Jane blushed a little, tucking a strand of her behind her ear as they wandered over to the entrance.
He licked his lips and wiped his brow, glancing behind him to check on Tony, who was working his way up the glass with the laser, those steady blacksmith’s hands never shaking an inch. At least he’d be alright, with his fancy suit and jet boots. Steve really wished he had some of them right about now.
Steve frowned, not making sense of the words. Thor, who apparently had come to see what the problem was, spoke up before Tony could try again, however. “You unlocked the dead woman’s phone,” he summarised, voice grave. Tony glanced at him, and then nodded once. Under his nose, Peter smelled like babies and a little bit of Steve’s aftershave. He just tried to focus on that.
Steve just looked down at him with a heavy swallow. Nothing was going to happen. He hadn’t been used. Tony had gotten to him in time.
“He… he gave me my birthday present,” Steve turned to look at Bucky then, hand curling subconsciously around his phone. Bucky began to frown at the serious face Steve was making, but Steve just shook his head, a silent gesture for him to wait a minute. “It was beautiful. Really, he… it was amazing.”
“That was easier than I thought,” Bulletproof guy said after a moment, stepping back and looking across at the Avengers through the blueish energy field. “Aren’t you guys supposed to be responsible for like, saving the universe and stuff?”
The boy’s eyes flickered back to him, and he smiled. “Top o’the world,” he responded, to which Steve rolled his eyes and gently moved his fingers to begin stroking through Tony’s hair once more. He knew how much Tony liked it when he did that.
“Nah,” he said shortly, turning away, “I’m not really good, just making sure the kid doesn’t die in our care, you know? I don’t… he’s really annoying, mostly. Don’t worry, I’m not gonna go all lovey-dovey-family shit on you. I’d be crap at it anyway.” To prove his point, he rolled his eyes at Peter and pulled a face, stepping out of the baby’s grasp. Although it was a pretty dumb point to make- a second later he had to step forward and stop the little menace from rocking off the table in an attempt to follow him.
Steve sighed. Tony looked over at him and opened his mouth, and Steve wondered if he had been about to backtrack- but no words ended up coming out, and so the old ones stuck. Yeah- Steve figured he'd probably been a source of amusement for Tony Stark since the very first meeting. Everything he had done since that had been slightly odd and most definitely not someone of Tony's status would ever engage in. Ice cream, Jesus- it even
That seemed answer enough to Thor, because he nodded once, and then smiled at Steve, punching his arm gently. “God, look at the pair of us,” he said with a small huff, “soaking wet and miserable, talking about depressing family matters in a graveyard. This would be a hell of a lot easier if I was high right now.”
Steve watched, transfixed as the blue light activated in the eye-slits. It was all over in less than a few seconds, but almost a lifetime seemed to pass between Steve looking at Tony Stark and Steve seeing Iron Man. This was it, really. The ultimate proof. Of course, Steve had known from pretty much the first moment; the evidence had been damning enough. But now, it was impossible for Steve to consider Tony as anyone else. He was barely seven feet away, watching Steve with those glowing eyes.
“I- what?” Steve asked in confusion, as he was led briskly over toward the studio he’d been watching intently for months by that point.
“You can stay here until my parents get back,” Thor told him with a nod, “and they’ll only stick around for a month or two, so as soon as they’re gone you can come straight back again.”
In a second that LMD was going to do some serious damage to Natasha’s leg, and the frequency blasting out through the speakers wasn’t doing jack shit to it. Maybe that was because Tony was going the wrong way up the scale, though.
“Merry Christmas,” Bruce returned, tired smile shining on Tony and Natasha as he took both of their hands and squeezed. Tony shut his eyes and attempted to respond in kind, but he couldn’t find the energy and instead just hummed, hoping they would get the message anyway.
He checked his watch. Sam would be out at the gym by this point, and Mr and Mrs Wilson were working late tonight too, which meant that no one would be in the house when he got back. He sighed to himself- spending time alone right now didn’t seem like a particularly appealing idea, but he didn’t really feel like conversation either. Sometimes it was just too tiring to try and think of things to say.
He jumped to his feet and didn’t even call Bucky out when he heard him mutter to Natasha “That gives us 25 seconds to make out for, quick, get over here,” because he was feeling in a particularly charitable mood at that moment, thanks to Thor’s wonderful Mead.
“A list. For everyone. In case… just in case. I… didn’ think anyone would think along the same lines as me, though.”
“So, just out of curiosity, are you actually dating Tony, or is that just a rumor? ‘Cause people have been talking, and I’ve got loads of people asking me to find out, seeing as I know like, everything, but Tony refused to tell me and so obviously my next option was you,” she explained, sitting back in her chair and then fiddling with the cutlery on the table.
“Not real,” he mumbled, thinking back to what he’d been told: ground yourself. Ground yourself to reality. Show your mind it was wrong.
Tony rolled his eyes and sat up, feeling his neck twitch sorely. A little too old to be sleeping on couches, by this point. “Right- got any ideas on how to get a supersoldier and a mutant-baby into their correct beds without either of them screaming?”
“Hey, look, as long as we have at least one genius dude on our team, then our opinion can be backed up by scientific fact and you can all shut the fuck up!” Natasha declared, waving a hand over to Tony, who turned his head and looked to her with a nod of agreement.
Steve laughed absently, arms instantly curling across Tony’s body and adjusting him so that he was facing the TV instead. “Nice to see you too.”
Steve was stood there in the alley, looking down at the blinking red dot beneath him. Tony was still talking through the speaker; mundane, rambling things, the way he always did when he was exhausted or nervous. Telling Steve the next time they woke up together it’d be better. That Tony would cook him breakfast and do everything in his power not to burn any of it. That he’d explain everything properly when they got home.
“Wuh- what? No, no, ‘m… I’m good,” Tony mumbled as Steve shifted him, sitting upright and then tucking Tony into his side so that his head fell easily onto Steve’s shoulder.
“Nat and Clint are down with the recruits,” Tony explained, lifting his leg in order to tap Steve’s hip and push him out of the line of fire, “Bruce’s in the labs with Thor. They’ll both be a while- the place goes into lockdown when the siren sounds.”
Steve ran until Tony was right under his feet, and then he sank to his knees slowly, hitting the unyielding sidewalk with a dull thud. There was a commotion across the street as someone or another wrestled the shooter to the ground. Beside Steve, someone asked him a question. He let it drift over his head, meaningless.
Seeing as Tony’s parents were on the other side of the planet by then, he felt it safe enough to invite Steve over, and they’d been lolling around in Tony’s workshop since that morning.  Now that it was around dinner-time, they were in the kitchen, having just finished preparing the food that was now cooking in the oven. Although, when Tony says
already, quit it with the compliments, weirdo" Tony mumbled, but Steve knew from the way he was smiling that he didn't mean a word of that. Steve rolled his eyes- Tony could charm the pants off a stranger, but the moment he received a genuine compliment, he blushed firetruck red and suddenly forgot how to speak.
Steve nodded. "Ma used to sing it to me when I was sick," he explained, "old Gaelic lullaby. I thought I might as well try it."
The whole deal with the weapons, and what Tony had said he would do with them. Destroy them—because they were his, and ever since he’d caught Obadiah Stane double dealing, he’d made it his mission to get them all back. Apparently.
The door was yanked open and Steve watched in surprise as someone’s hand flew out and shoved Tony off the step, sending him sprawling onto the gravel a few feet away.
Steve just looked at him blankly, before pulling a face and punching his friend in the arm. “When the fuck did you become such a sap, Barnes?” He asked with a grin, whilst his best friend just rolled his eyes and then punched him back. “I mean, it’s all well and good for
Tony didn’t say anything. He looked off to the side of Steve, swallowing and keeping his eyes fixed on a random point of Bucky’s house. Steve just waited for him.
. Steve couldn’t see his face, but he knew what it would look like, because he’d memorised all of Tony’s facial expressions.
“No no, that was Peg—” Tony stopped himself suddenly, the smile sticking on his face. Steve, too, felt the immediate heaviness settle down in his chest at the start of her name. Not nearly so sharp, so agonising as it had been in the beginning—although he guessed Tony didn’t know that. Last time they’d seen each other, Steve wouldn’t even say her name at all.
Tony just nodded, looking back at the desk. More children, being put through hell because AIM wanted soldiers. More babies like Peter, potentially, who didn’t have the luck that Peter had. Who hadn’t made it out.
kids- the one with the divorced parents and two of everything because his dads were both trying to one-up each other in the Who Loved Their Kid Most competition, which sounded great in theory but really just sucked.
He watched in utter bewilderment as Tony moved forward suddenly, staring at the floor as he made his way over to the door Steve was currently stood at. However, he didn’t get far- Bucky reached out and tugged at his arm, holding him in place by the sleeve of his jacket.
“Steve,” Bruce said gently, taking Steve’s shoulders into his hands and squeezing, “you’re allowed to be here. Tony’s been wanting to see you for days.”
“Shut up,” Tony cut in, slicing a hand through the air, “Steve—Steve, stop talking. Just…” He looked at Steve with a face that looked damn near heartbroken, and then stepped forward, his hands reaching out to slide over Steve’s shoulders. He flexed his fingers and held on tight, shaking his head and looking down at him. Steve wanted to run his fingers over ever cut, every bruise on Tony’s beautiful face—wanted to apologise, over and over and over, until all of it just went away again. But that clearly wasn’t what Tony wanted, so Steve kept his mouth shut.
Bruce coughed. “Actually, now that we’re here, it would probably do to just give you a bit of a checkup, see how you’re adjusting to—uh—”
He sat back and tried not to flinch as Bucky cleaned him up. The flow of blood had, thankfully, stopped by that point, and all that was left was a nasty purple bruise on the left side of his nose, the darkness seeping into the underside of his eyes just a little. Not his worst nose injury, but it sure wouldn’t be pretty for a week or so.
From what Tony could work out, they must have been waiting for Steve to turn up at the compound and then ambushed him upon arrival, taking him hostage as opposed to killing him in an attempt to create The Winter Soldier 2.0. They must have removed his suit then, in order to… to begin their tests. But obviously, they’d underestimated Steve’s stubbornness and strength, because he must have broken out and—well.
, and his face and hair and clothes were all wet and he was choking while they laughed and he couldn’t breathe and all he’d known to do was run, away, out, as fast as his legs could go.
When Steve sat down with his friends again on Friday morning, he watched them all slowly stop talking in order to stare at him in surprise.
Steve looked down warily at the child. “I have no idea. Are there… can we do tests or something? I mean—God, are we supposed to tell social services this? Do they even have a way to deal with this?”
Steve said in his foreign language, swallowing nervously and then running a hand through his hair, apparently trying to recall the lyrics, "uhhhhh... oh!
They had been for at least a week now. Peter was used to the occasional blowup for a night, maybe two, before they got all stupidly sappy with one another again.
“You know,” he said loudly once he got to the door, hands working at the lock and yanking it open, “most people wait until the sun’s properly risen to do social calls, just so they can avoid the annoying process of having to wake some innocent boy u- oh.”
Steve held him close, nose to nose, rocking them gently on the street until the paramedics came and took his body away.
Instead, he just smiled. “You made me happier,” he said simply, before drifting out of the room, feeling Tony’s eyes on his back as he left.
, or use it as material against the other. It’d been an unspoken rule ever since the beginning. Steve knew it was a little unrealistic, really, when in the heat of the moment, you said whatever you could to get your point across, but- well. That didn’t make it any less agonising to hear.
With an incoherent mumble and one last messy kiss against Steve’s collar, Tony did. Steve let himself watch for a moment before he too shut his eyes and let sleep pull him under.
“Uh,” he said as she pushed him into a chair and then sat next to him, an expectant smile on her face, “uh, hi- do you… what is it exactly that you-“
Tony just laughed, and the bed dipped as he leaned over and planted a kiss on the crown of Steve’s head. “Aww, I’m happy to wake up next to you too, sweetheart.” He heard Tony as he rolled off the bed and then pressed his feet into the wooden floor, and couldn’t resist stealing a peak as Tony stretched, then looked around for what he figured were probably some clothes.
“Steve?” She said his name and he blinked, looking up at her. He was so tired. “Are you going to see Tony?”
Shit. He was crying properly, now, and Steve sounded like he was struggling for air too, as he stumbled forward and reached blindly for Tony’s hand. “I know, Tony, I know, and I’m so sorry, I thought it was what you wanted, please-”
Tony just smiled, taking the pillow. “Don’t worry about it. Thank you for letting me stay at all. It’s very generous of you.”
He looked down at the slack arm resting around his waist, shutting his eyes for a brief second. He could feel it before he even knew it- today was going to be shitty. But here, now… God, it was just
Tony blinked at him groggily, before giving him a weak smile. “At least have a nap. You look like shit.” He paused, before adding, “but in, like, a sexy way. Obviously.”
“Steve, I’m pretty sure there’s only one person Tony wants to date, and he’s stood to the right of me.” And Steve almost turned around in search of the mystery guy before his cheeks heated and realized, right, she was talking about him.
It was a few moments later when she left the room. Maybe she’d said something else. Maybe she hadn’t. Steve couldn’t tell. It was all blurry and cold and wrong. He was pretty sure he was drugged with something or another. He was pretty sure he was dying, too.
“You got it back,” Steve stated, taking a step forward, “you went after it. Is that- is that where the…“ he gestured to the various bruises over Tony’s general vicinity.
“Hey Peter, didn’t know you’d be back so ear- oh,” his Pops said, entering the room and faltering when he saw Dad already sat at the table.
Bruce turned and left without another word, leaving the two of them to fully re-acquaint with one another after those four long days of absence. Tony made sure to avoid the particularly deep wound in Steve’s side as he rolled his hips against the other man, and Steve reached out blindly for the monitor on his left, grabbing blindly until he found grip on a wire and tugged. The fast beats cut off with a burst of static, and they both laughed in amusement in between their frantic kisses.
“Hello, Mr Rogers,” the voice called out to him cheerfully, “May I just say that I am pleased to finally make your acquaintance. Sir has spoken lots about y-“
The car in question sped around the bend and turned down Steve’s road, illuminating the fast-darkening streets in white light. He raised a hand desperately, trying to wave the driver’s attention, and then sighed in pure relief as the engine cut out and the car stopped messily at the side of the road.
“Three weeks ago. We were fighting Loki again. You disappeared for a few minutes,” Tony said quietly, and he watched as Steve stiffened minutely under his gaze, and knew he was on the right track.
“There’s not much we can do about it now,” he said gruffly, “this is probably just a badly hashed-out plan to get one of the gizmos down here. Storm the building, hire out a few professional Enhanced to lead the march, then let them do their own thing while everyone else gets the hell outta dodge.” He shrugged and raised a repulsor toward the door. “Let’s just go in, see what they’re about, and then take them down.”
Steve sighed. “You know, there’s really not much difference between our school and this one. I bet you a hundred bucks there will be the same groups, the same sort of teachers, and the same assholes as there always are. It’s a universal constant.”
Steve pressed a finger into his forehead and shut his eyes. “Tony got kicked out last night,” he said quietly, “because his dad found out. About me.”
“-To sleep,” Steve turned his head a little, raising an eyebrow, “considering how long it’s been since you actually engaged in that activity.”
He’s so caught up in his own head that he forgets to watch where his feet are going, and they catch on the overhanging material that hangs over his toes whenever he wears Steve’s sweatpants, and then he’s off, falling face first, destination: corner of the fucking tabletop.
Steve laughed, burying it into Tony’s shoulder before kissing the place where his mouth met the skin. It was an absent motion. Tony liked that. “I’m good,” he said softly, “I’ll go get us something to clean up with. This might feel weird.” With a fluid motion, Steve eased out of Tony and sat up on the bed, sliding off it and heading for the bathroom. Tony lay there amongst the pillows and watched him move in that graceful, haunting way of his. It looked like there was a layer of air between his feet and the floor, like his limbs were suspended in water. It was strange, and it was beautiful. Tony wished he could watch Steve all day. Maybe something could be arranged. Steve didn’t ever have to leave this room, in fact, and they could stay here and keep doing this forever until they died.
That was what made up Steve’s mind, in the end. Because HYDRA had come in on large, three-person motorsleds, and although they could have been used for the travel down, Steve was almost certain Tony wouldn’t survive that. Hell,
“Dude, you’ve barely spoken a word since coming in,” Clint argued, “please- I know you’re going through a tough time right now, but that’s why you need-“
“— Steve, for fuck’s sake, the only reason you’re in this mess in the first place is because of me—”
Steve’s legs were locked in place as he stared at the spot Tony had been only moments ago. His head felt stuffed full of cotton, and all of his thoughts just didn’t seem to be melding right. The picture of Tony in his head was distorted—Iron Man, supervillain and terrorist, mixed with Tony, the man Steve still loved and the one who was seemingly adamant about getting his weapons off the market.
“I know that this is messy Steve,” Tony breathed out after another few seconds of silence. “You did what you did, yeah, and that… hurt, I can’t lie. It hurt a lot. And for the first few hours, I was pretty fucking angry about that. But then the fifth hour rolled in, and I realised a few things." Tony cracked another tiny smile, and there was something almost like fondness in his eyes. "You broke my heart, Steve. Yeah. You did. But then you went home, changed your mind about me with no concrete evidence other than the word of a man who'd been pretty solidly accused of destroying thousands of lives, and turned your back on SHIELD in order to risk everything you'd built for yourself here and break me out. You took a gamble on me when the rest of the world was ready to put me on death row. Figure that’s ultimately a lot harder than just going to your asshole exe’s house and sleeping with him for information. So yeah. Thank you. You saved my life back there. And I know it doesn’t mean shit coming from me, but you really have done the right thing. I’ll explain everything, from start to finish, I promise. But I just want to get this conversation out of the way first.”
Bruce’s face went more serious and he gave Tony a sharp look. “He got hurt too, Tony,” he said bluntly. “in a different way. He’s not being stupid and that’s not fair.”
“Yeah,” Steve blurted before Tony could even finish, “yeah, we can… we can go somewhere. For a bit. I’m sure the others wouldn’t mind.”
God, don’t think about that. Push it down. It was fine. “Yeah, whatever Bruce,” he muttered, pulling his hands off the table so that the other man wouldn’t see them start to shake. They did that so much these days, and he hated it. Hated every last part of himself, really. The way he jumped when doors opened and how sometimes when Steve came into the room looking unhappy, Tony sped through a quick checklist of things he’d done wrong and threw an apology straight up to his lips just in case.
Peggy turned the handle and walked in, looking around the room until her eyes settled on him and she sighed. “In all fairness,” she began, sitting gingerly on the edge of the bed, “I didn’t do much wrong besides stand there and watch the events unfold.”
The sun was peaking through the curtains; warm and lovely and deceptively pleasant. The type of weather that made people smile and suggest stupid things like barbecues or swimming or whatever. Dumb stuff. Stuff that required friends, family- things other than just machines.
“As long as it doesn’t involve excessive amounts of peril, I’m good. Medium amounts of peril are fine, though. Also no nudity on Clint’s part.”
Steve howled, then- marching forward, not knowing what he was going to do but knowing that Bucky had just managed to hit on every frayed edge, every torn up part of him, and now all that anger had to go somewhere.
At least, he did feel those things-- right up until he watched Steve give Peter a kiss on the forehead and then got hit with the brutal realisation that it was only going to get worse from here.
Rhodey muttered a goodbye, and Steve hung up with a blank look on his face, trying to swallow the lump that had suddenly formed in his throat. He thought back, all those months ago, to the first time that Tony had ever brought him to his home. Back when Steve’d gotten mugged. He’d been confused by the way Tony had scrubbed so desperately at his car, trying to clean off the non-existent dirt. And he’d told Steve to shut up when Steve had asked him about it. Other times, too- like when they’d been talking to one another, and Steve had jokingly called him a useless boy, and Tony’s face had just… blanked. He’d gone home barely even five minutes after. God- Steve had even learned not to grab his wrists too hard, because the one time he had, Tony had wrenched them away and immediately apologized over and over, keeping his head bowed and his gaze on the floor despite doing absolutely nothing wrong. Like it was a knee-jerk reaction.
Tony looked down, and the tears slid over his cheeks. “I don’t belong here, with you,” he whispered, “this was never my world. And being here is killing you. I cannot let that happen, and I refuse to be responsible for that.”
“I act like I care because, amazingly, I do,” Steve said with a shrug, “but that must be hard for you to understand. All you ever do for people is give them an extremely mediocre fuck and then bounce, acting like you’ve earned some sort of prize for World’s Greatest Sex God. How
He plugged the wire in and then, taking a deep breath, twisted and yanked at the metal in his chest . The reactor came loose with an ominous hiss, and he gasped as his own heart began to fluctuate wildly, feeling the terribly familiar sensation of tightness on his chest that came removal of the pacemaker in his chest. Without the arc reactor inside to regulate the electrical impulses of his heart, it was starting to spasm and do things that no healthy heart should be allowed to do. It wouldn’t be long before he went into cardiac arrest as well, so he had to work fast to get Steve’s beating before he passed out himself. It was a race against the clock now.
“Hey!” Natasha turned to Peggy in betrayal, “Bucky and I chose that car with care and love, don’t disrespect her.” She paused, before frowning a little and glancing at Steve. “Although I
He made to move, but suddenly Bucky’s hands were there again, sharper, firmer this time, holding him on the bed. “Gently, Steve,” he warned quietly.
that would stop the room from feeling so cavernous and empty. That was absolutely not what they should be thinking at these meetings. Sam would have kicked his ass and talked to him about positive reinforcements.
The penny dropped. Tony’s eyes shifted, dragged themselves over to the corner of the room where he knew Peter’s crib lay, and where he knew Steve’s thoughts had settled. Were he anywhere else, at any other point of the day, the statement might have thrown him. Too many variables to consider, too many doubts and fears to cloud his vision.
“Oh, so this ain’t even about me, is it?” Bucky asked him wryly, “this is about Tony? Of course, that being said, when is it
“Hey, you chose to do this in the communal room, your fault,” Clint said, before waving them away, “now shoo- go have your way with him or whatever, Steve- I don’t want to see any more of this here, I’m eating my cereal.”
He looked up in time to spot the tail end of Mrs Wilson’s small frown, as she turned around fully and took the pot off the stove. “What, the Stark boy? Isn’t he a troublemaker?”
Steeling himself, Steve reeled off the situation and events as they’d unfolded that previous night. The lack of sleep was starting to take a toll on him, but he intended to chug another cup of coffee once he’d gotten off the phone, so he’d be okay. Tony still hadn’t woken up yet, but Thor had taken over watching him temporarily while Steve got in touch with all his friends.
The whole team. Meticulously trawling through their histories, their triggers, their responses to bad missions or guilt or loss. It takes him 6 nights of no sleep.
He sighed, rolling over and staring at the same spot he’d been looking at for the past hour. His hand was still holding onto his phone, and Tony’s jacket glared at him from where it had been carefully draped against the chair in the corner of his room.
As a general rule, Steve did not switch his work-phone off. It was emergency-only, so it was rarely used anyway, and when it was, SHIELD tended to call during normal working hours; you know, 9 to 5, that sort of thing. Sometimes he got one or two a bit later in the night, although that was because of immediate assistance being needed to deal with situations. Never one past midnight though; not in the year or so that Steve had been working for the organisation.
Tony glared at her, but opened his mouth all the same. She popped the square onto his tongue. It tasted like compacted shit, but food was food. “Tactically, stayin’ here makes no sense,” he argued weakly, wheezing in a small breath in order to speak again. “You can—you can go down unnoticed in th’ darkness, get help, an’ then find me again. Probably in under 24 hours.”
“So,” Clint said, and Steve turned, looking back at his friend and then immediately becoming wary when he saw the cheeky spark in his eye, “now you’re back with us, do I get to ask what your deal is with a certain Tony Stark?”
Steve grinned to himself as he pulled out his phone, happy to simply scroll through Instagram in quiet as his friends chatted and lounged around him. It was a certain kind of comfort, that ability to just sit and do nothing with your friends. Without the awkwardness. Without the worry. Steve really, truly loved it. These were people that he knew he could be himself around. That he knew he could rely on, without question.
and nothing else, so Steve figured Bucky had done okay for himself despite Steve’s absence. He sent an apology text off and hoped Bucky wouldn’t rip his head off for not answering last night when he’d been… occupied. “We’re all going over to Nat’s this afternoon, aren’t we?” He checked in with Sam.
,” Natasha said, sounding confounded, “when the wave came, the Enhanced split off to the basement floor, but all the other targets just marched right past and through to the exits on the other side of the building.”
“Hey squirt- how was school?” Dad asked, when Peter dropped his bag and began making his way into the kitchen in order to make himself a bowl of cereal (he was a growing boy, okay, shut up, cereal in the afternoon was perfectly fine, his Uncle Clint did it all the time).
At about 7, he gathered Peter, who was already awake and sat playing contentedly with Steve's gloves, up in his arms and then marched him up to the communal floor. He told Steve to get Clint, and then plopped Peter down on the counter next to the coffee-maker. He glared at the child and Peter looked back at him, shooting him a gummy smile. For a creature who had spent the entire night bawling his eyes out, he seemed to be remarkably jolly now. Tony poked him gently yet accusingly in the chest. "I'm onto you," he warned, "giving me your cute face, pretending you're a little angel. Well it won't fool me. I haven't forgotten last night, you know. I know you're a menace."
Someone yelled after him, but he didn’t register it. The ground was beginning to crumble away under his feet, he had seconds left, and
It didn’t take much to know it was Tony. He’d memorised the walk, the breathing, the pressure Tony asserted against his shoulder from the first week of knowing him.
“Lucky we didn’t take Sam with us, then,” Steve muttered, peering into a huge room curiously, “he, and I quote; ‘doesn’t fuck with demons or spirits of any freaky shit like that’. Apparently, he values staying alive more than going into places that are supposed to be haunted.”
He blinked. “Yeah. Yeah, I just… tired. Think I’m gonna head up, actually.” He paused for a moment, before turning jerkily on his foot and wandering toward the elevator, his good mood having evaporated and left only bitterness in its wake. “Give Peter over to Thor. It’s his turn to take him for the night.”
“Of course I’m fucking serious.” Tony clicked his teeth and then looked sullen for a moment before he finally looked Steve in the eye. “The whole world’s fallen apart. We’ve lost everything. I don’t… God, I just want—just come in. I’m tired of being angry. That’s so pre-apocalypse.”
The memories burned his mind. They hurt. They hurt more than anything else he’d ever felt. He couldn’t get the image of his husband’s dead body out of his head- the body that Steve had put there-
) found out that Tony was actually alive. He’d met up with Tony at the hospital where he’d been checked into and essentially barred him from leaving until the Doctor’s saw fit, shooting Tony stony glares each time Tony even so much as mentioned departing before he was suggested to.
He shut his eyes, shoulder lighting up in pain as it hit the concrete hard. They both rolled, Tony feeling the cool lines of Steve’s shield on his back.
“No, it doesn’t,” Steve said, knowing that Tony was currently talking more to himself than Steve, “but how well do you think you’d sleep, knowing that pin was digging into you every time you turned?”
He felt Peggy begin to smile. “So the Steve Rogers-Bucky Barnes friendship has not been irreparably fragmented, then?” She asked hopefully, and Steve just rolled his eyes, jostling their shoulders.
“You know this has to happen,” Tony whispered after a second, and Steve looked up- up from the floor, over to his lover with a frantic rebuttal already forming on his lips. “You knew this had always been going to h-”
Bucky looked gobsmacked for another moment, before something clicked on his face and the expression turned to one of outright fury. “Where the
Steve contemplated for a moment, before shaking his head. “I’ll do it myself when I next see him,” he said with a huff.
“Oh, don’t worry man, I don’t wanna touch this with a ten-foot pole- I’m just here to tell you Bucky’s outside the house. He wants to talk.”
Tony’s hands ran through his hair a few more times (and Steve knew him- knew he was checking, because the battle had been hard and Steve was pretty beaten up after being thrown through that wall), before he pulled away a little and let his knees buckle; falling into Steve’s lap fluidly. Steve watched fondly as he wiggled his butt and got comfortable between Steve’s legs, lying back against his chest as he looked upward. “Really is something, isn’t it?”
He sighed, leaning back on his desk chair and swivelling around a little so that he was facing DUM-E. The bot chirped at him as he leaned forward to run a finger along his claw. “Any ideas?” He murmured quietly.
Tony had to hand it to them, they didn’t even blink. Bruce just sighed and Natasha told them to have fun.
Tony looked back at him, a depth to his eyes that made Steve feel as if he’d said something that Tony probably hadn’t heard in a long time. Steve eased the shock with a few short kisses to his cheeks, and then tried to pull Tony back so he could lie down, but the other boy didn’t move.
“Hi,” Steve said, and his voice didn’t sound angry any more, didn’t sound sad or irritated or cold, there was a slight lowering of pitch toward the end of the word like maybe he was tired, but other than that— “I know it’s late, but… Look, can I come over again? We should probably talk.”
“Of course it was a good choice, they’re the only sort of choices I make,” Steve raised an eyebrow and then trailed his hands up the curve of Tony’s spine and back down again, settling them at the small of his back. The video he’d seen of Tony yesterday came back to him; younger, skinnier, with eyes that had seemed even bigger than they did now he was older. He hadn’t watched all of it. Even now, when Steve knew every part of Tony intimately, it had still felt like too much of a violation of his privacy. But he’d seen the way Tony had been looking at the other two people in the video—trusting and nervous. He must have been young, to still be looking at his bed-partners like that.
Steve’s eyebrow went up. “I’ll drag it out,” he said easily, “and we both know how much you hate to wait.” With that, he slipped out of the bathroom and shut the door behind him, leaving Tony holding his razor and internally debating how much he
She clicked her fingers and brought the two other men forward smoothly, one of them opening the case and setting it out on a stool. Turning, she plucked a needle from the inside of her jacket, glancing between Steve and the device with that same smug little smile. “Captain Rogers, have you ever been shown your worst fears?”
“Mmmf,” Steve answered simply, tightening his hand against Tony’s hip and then opening his mouth on Tony’s neck, beginning to spread little kisses into his warm skin. Tony shivered and hummed against his will. “Will the box have you in it?”
But Tony didn’t look particularly chaotic at that moment. He just seemed sad. Steve recognised it from a mile away- he’d seen it in the reflection often enough, come on.
. That bothers me more than you could ever believe.” He pulled a face and sighed, rolling Tony back onto his side of the bed and then nudging up a little closer until their noses were touching. Then he dipped down, kissing the warm mouth in front of him. “But no part of who you are freaks me out. Apart from the fact you love orange juice but hate oranges. That’s just fucking strange.”
Tony swayed a little, the dizziness clearly messing with his vision as he tried to locate Steve. A second later, Thor jolted Tony’s socket back into place quickly, and Tony jerked.
“He doesn’t,” Thor explained, “they’re just… complicated. Used to be best friends, they’ve kind of grown up around eachother. Tiberius’ parents are close with Tony’s father- that’s the only reason Tony puts up with his idiocy, because if he pisses him off too much then the bastard will go tattle to Howard,” Thor spat, and then rolled his eyes as he added “plus, they’d been on-and-off for years before the start of this semester. Ty can’t seem to get the message that Tony isn’t interested in him anymore. He’s just… a dick.”
Mild Warning I guess for underage sex, depending on what State you're in? Idk Tony is 17 and Steve's 16, take it as u will and enjoy!
“But if you sent in someone that he had an emotional investment with…” Steve started dully, hands tightening against the chair.
Carol had left, and she was going to find Tony. They just had to hope that it wasn’t too late, and he was still… still alive.
“That’s what you get for scaring us.” Her face softened as she looked at Steve, and she tilted her head. “Seems like you’re feeling a little more chirpy, Captain.”
The words rang out as sharply as the bullet had. He wanted to suck them back into his mouth as soon as he’d said them, because they suddenly became real, because saying them meant all of this was something he needed to accept now, and he refused to do that. He was still in battle mode, he’d decided. He was still fighting. Once that will was gone, he had no idea what would become of him, so he needed to continue on with his fight against time, the universe, everything.
“Tony, this isn’t working,” Steve told him as he watched Tony get blasted through a wall by an energy beam sent out of the robot’s chest, “it’s gonna kill you if you keep doing this.”
New suit for Natasha. Fix Thor’s hammer strap, because the metal might be the strongest thing in the universe, but the leather was, unfortunately, just leather. Clint’s bow was getting worn too, so that’d need some work. And the whole team needed some sort of filtration system that they could carry around with them, because right now Tony was the only one protected from gas-attacks and that just wasn’t good enough.
Steve laughs, and it still sounds too sad for Tony, which is his own fault this time- he’s going to have to add the word
People kept telling him it wasn’t his fault, but if it wasn’t his, then who else was there to blame?
Steve had paused, trying to look suitably offended, before he apparently gave up and shrugged. “Like I said- you don’t fuck around when you play hide and seek.”
He heard Sam and Bucky begin to mess around in the other room, and threw a pillow at the door in order to shut off the noise. It didn’t do much good- Sam’s walls were notoriously thin- and he cursed in annoyance, knowing he would only last so long before he gave up completely and went to join them, detention be damned. Once his ass left the vicinity of that homework, it wasn’t going back.
Steve paused, but altogether he didn’t seem that shocked by Tony’s wishes, which said something about their lives, really. “I told Clint explicitly that no clothes were to be removed, don’t worry. As for the peril, I’m pretty sure there will be none. Although, you know, I can’t exactly promise that.”
But not like the way he cared for Tony. That felt… different. Burned harder, sharper, more painfully and fiercely. He’d been at the gym when he’d seen the news on the TV of Tony’s house being burned to bits, of everyone saying he was dead, and to say that the bottom had dropped from his world was an understatement. It was like being pushed into a new world all over again, lonely and terrifying and completely unfathomable. He’d been beside himself with panic, the prospect of losing his very first anchor to the future being something he couldn’t even bear to think about.
Bruce’s face was twisted in fury, but he said nothing. Just shook his head again and looked away, until a second later when he stood abruptly from his chair. “I need to take a breather,” he muttered, before he snatched his bag up and then moved away from the table. Steve didn’t try to stop him- although the teacher did. Not that Bruce paid any attention to him, though. He left the class with a slam of the door before the teacher could even hope to apprehend him. The man just looked at the space Bruce had vacated for a second, blinking owlishly before turning back to the board as if nothing had ever happened. Steve snorted to himself. Typical. Teachers weren’t paid to give a fuck about their students, after all. Just teach them.
To his left, Sam whistled slowly under his breath. “That’s… wow, that’s great, Steve,” he said, a soft look on his face, “I’m glad you finally worked that out with him. And he’d hang the moon for you too, y’know.”
Steve needed this. And Clint was right- there was pretty much nothing on this earth that Tony wouldn’t do for Steve.
Tony rolled his eyes. “You’re nowhere on it, seeing as you have a panic attack every time Peter goes near you.”
we’re talking about. HAMILTON. You don’t just pass up on an opportunity to see Hamilton,” Bruce said, horrified.
But Peggy looked at him like that was odd. "So you're saying you're voluntarily keeping your relationship secret?"
Steve pulled a face, and when he glanced around he realized in surprise that both Bucky and Sam had left the room. Probably for another food break or something.
Steve poked at a floating piece of cereal and let his head rest in his hand. He still didn’t really feel like talking about it. “I’m better,” he agreed in the end, leaving it at that and hoping Sam wouldn’t push.
Another quake; this one even more powerful than the other, rumbled at their feet, and once more sent all three of them flying around the corridor. This time it was Bucky who grabbed hold of Tony- and in any other circumstance, Tony probably would have had something to say about all this coddling- but for the time being, he was simply glad Bucky had saved him from braining himself against the floor.
Tony’s head turned upward, and the cheeky glint in his eyes made his whole face look a little less tired. He slid his hand lower, dipping it under the waistband of Steve’s sweatpants. “Fun?” He asked, voice dropping.
It was him, without a doubt- but it was done in such a way that Tony had never seen before, and probably wouldn’t ever see out of anyone other than Steve Rogers.
“Yep,” Tony popped the word before shoving a potato into his mouth, smiling at Natasha and then leaning sideways so his cheek rested on Steve’s shoulder. Steve hummed happily. He was still holding the slip of paper from the Christmas cracker, and his crown was still skewed on his head, and his body was warm and strong, and Tony realised that he wouldn’t mind staying in this hospital bed at all if Steve was there with him. Which spoke volumes, really, because barely anything could keep him still for long.
As the videos went on and the months passed, Tony watched Lewinsky appear to become more and more removed, quiet, subdued. She watched on while they continued to experiment, but she often cut the tests short, and Tony noticed she began to pick Peter up from the crib herself and take him away back to his nursery. If Tony was being objective—which he wasn’t, Lewinsky was a fucking monster and she had no soul—he’d have hypothesised that the woman was slowly getting attached.
“I don’t—I—okay,” Steve spluttered, carefully shifting Peter around in his arms so he was held somewhat awkwardly between Steve’s hands. “Like this?”
Steve looked, eyes going wide for a minute as he too lurched forward on instinct, before stopping himself and merely blinking in confusion. Tony took the opportunity to shove the mug of coffee into his hands, which he accepted in thanks. Bruce walked in a second later, and the words on Tony’s lips died as he took in Bruce’s face. “News?” He asked instead, cocking his head.
Steve rolled his eyes tiredly and followed Tony as the man stepped out of the elevator and started prancing through the corridor, eyes already lighting up at the prospect of getting back to whatever project he had been working on before JARVIS had interrupted with the alert about Steve. The doors slid open easily for the both of them, and Tony turned to Steve questioningly as he reached the desk. “What are your thoughts on some Black Sabbath?” He asked.
The gunshot rang out in his ears. A single, blinding strike. Elliot Redford had a good aim. It was one bullet, one man, and he had single-handedly murdered Iron Man and destroyed Captain America. All in three seconds.
When Steve remained confusedly silent, Tony made a face and wiggled his fingers. “I just… need to do something. A
Tony looked back, over to Steve with a wary face. Police reports were rarely good news, especially when it had things to do with small and vulnerable babies. He spun his finger. “Pull it up, J.”
Steve folded his arms, trying to make himself look a little taller. Tony seemed to spot it, and for the first time ever, Steve watched an actual smile spread across his lips before being pulled back and smoothed down. “I’ll go- I got here first,” Steve said gruffly, beginning to stand.
Suddenly and without warning, reality clicked into place with a startling clarity. This whole thing was a far bigger problem than what he’d previously realised. He couldn’t believe that he hadn’t clocked onto it sooner.
And the next time movie night came around and Tony got told to choose, he held his tongue from saying his favourite- it was one that starred The Actor Who Shall Not Be Named, and he knew Steve wouldn’t like it. He just said something else instead. Because relationships were about compromise, and Tony was trying to be good for Steve. Whatever strange bump this was, they could work through it. Because Tony loved Steve more than anyone or anything, and nothing could change that.
“Steve?” Susan Storm’s gentle voice was soft, but concerned, and Steve’s eyes turned to the elevator where she had just appeared from, “what are you doing here?”
Peter pulled his attention away from his own thoughts by smacking his palm into the glass casing of the reactor in front of him. “Appah,” he said happily, eyes gazing into the cold blue light. “Appah!”
"Well- I should probably go back," Steve pushed an unenthusiastic hand back in the direction of the cafeteria, and he watched Tony look horribly, awfully sad for a moment, before the usual face slipped back on and he just shrugged indifferently.
But, it seemed that they were being given a chance to practise, right here, right now. Peter was in danger- Peter was being chased down by one of the most notoriously evil scientific terrorism corporations in the world, and the only thing that was standing between him and them were the Avengers. Dysfunctional or not, they were still all that this baby had.
Tony just smiled, squeezing their fingers together. “Are you sure you’re 16 and not like, 56 or something?”
Peter just waited. Whatever form it came in, at the end of the day, the outcome would still be the same. They weren’t going to be a proper family any more.
Tony raised his voice then, the word cracking at the end as he pointed a finger accusingly at Steve, “don’t fucking say that. You can’t… use that, not now. We have priorities, Steve. We have a little baby girl, if you had fucking forgotten—”
“I love you,” Tony told him, feeling something disgustingly similar to tears prick up behind his eyes, “I love you so much.”
Tony bit his lip, hands rising until they were against Steve’s face. Gently, he pulled the hands that covered his eyes away, revealing Steve’s guilt-stricken expression underneath it.
, he smiled at me while i passed on the corridors today and that was literally all that happened. I honestly don’t know why you’re making such a big deal out of this, he called me cute
The bass dropped on one of the songs playing, and Steve stared at everyone dumbly as they started jumping. He really couldn’t imagine jumping right now. He thought he’d probably throw up.
mistake there Steve—oh, and then all the other stuff, about how you missed me, how you wanted to start over, staying the night and then helping me out when that big fuckoff robot tried to crush Santa Barbara. In fact, the only
“I’ll see you around, Steve Rogers,” Tony waved, turning around once again and beginning to walk off, “try to stay out of trouble.”
” Steve pleaded with him, running his fingers across Tony’s collarbone and then pouting, “I wouldn’t ask you if I thought it was going to be detrimental to anything in the long run. I’m a strategist, remember?”
Steve just shut his eyes, sinking further into the softness of Tony’s faded Guns ‘N’ Roses t-shirt. He curled his fingers around Tony’s, his small and bony ones being nearly entirely encompassed by Tony’s long and agile ones.
Things came back to him vaguely. He’d been… he’d been fighting something. And then someone had tackled him, and knocked him out, and- and he’d been so angry, so
Tony said nothing. Steve watched him slip through a dozen different emotions all in the space of a moment: disbelief and apprehension. Realisation. Gief. “No,” he shook his head almost dazedly, voice numb, “No, he… he wouldn’t.”
Still, Steve said nothing. He couldn’t. There was too much that he wanted to say, all of it clogging up in his throat and settling there like a noose. Eventually, Tony looked away again. Back to the wall. “Just the fact that I’ve told you has put your life in danger. But someone on the inside needs to know, just… just on the off-chance that you believe me. This is bigger than us. Bigger than me and my stupid life. Ask for a copy of the recording of this conversation, take it to Nick Fury and tell him to do some digging into Arnim Zola, Operation Paperclip. Most of my intel has led me to believe there’s something big hidden in Camp Leigh, but you’re not gonna be able to get in on an official basis; you’d have to have it done under the radar. I have no idea how many of your colleagues and superiors are marching to HYDRA’s fife instead of SHIELD’s, but it could be anyone.
Tony sighed, letting his head fall back against Steve’s shoulder. “Right,” he griped, “right, I guess this is just my life, huh? Fine. Okay. Lead the way, Pack-Wolf Rogers. Just please, don’t try and feed me anything raw. I will throw up. Go fetch some jello or something, I could eat a bit of that.”
Ugh. He hated when Steve was right. With a pout, Tony looked back out through the window, trying not to think about what awaited for him when he got home. He’d been keeping on top of the important stuff—Pepper had tracked down the person responsible for leaking the footage and was currently in the process of raining hell upon them, and the updates on figures for the product launch was all stored away in his head—but that still left the media to contest with, statements he was gonna have to make… it wouldn’t necessarily be
that, I do, and I know that that’s not enough and I understand that you probably still don’t want to be with me any more, but I want you to know—”
“What did my poor cigarette ever do to you?” Tony asked him, pouting slightly as he dug his hand deeper into his pocket and then started pulling out another.
“Nope,” Bucky said firmly, “you sit your ass back down, Stark, you can’t run off now, you should at least explain what just happened.”
Tony had padded back into their bed and fallen asleep shortly after with the thought playing through his subconscious, and by the time he’d awoke to the smell of bacon and the sound of Steve’s singing drifting through the floorboards, his mind had been made up: he was going to propose, and it was going to be perfect. He was going to make it everything that Steve had ever dreamed of, because he knew that Steve would do the same for him, and his goal in life was to be half as good as Steve was at all this. Tony knew he was messy, and
“He needs time,” Bruce told him gently, when he watched Tony bristle in the kitchen one morning, “and so do you, Tony. You both got put through a lot. You can’t expect this to go back to normal.”
Tony looked up, face splitting into a soft smile as he stared at the thousands of stars glittering above them.
“Ah, well actually, I was thinking we could all dress up,” Tony steeled himself as they broached the more uncertain waters, “you know,  have a whole Halloween bash at my place. You could go as, like, a sexy vampire. And you already fill out the vampire part, so you could just take off your shirt and Bob’s your uncle!”
“Oh shit, don’t tell me he saw you,” there was a sudden clattering on the other end of the line, as if Rhodey had stood up suddenly, “Steve, holy shit, is Tony still with you? Get him out, get him out of there right n-“
Tony looked at him; the confused way he was staring between Tony’s face and the bag in his hand. Tony supposed that this was for the best anyway- he had to face the music someday. But the worst thing was, more than anything, he just wanted to drop the whole idea. Even now. Even when he knew that he couldn’t live like this, part of him didn’t even care. Part of him would take the pain, just for the chance to get Steve when he was good and happy. Part of him- a terribly, humiliatingly large part of him- thought that would be worth it.
“Oh, darling, you don’t even know the half of it,” Tony grinned and turned a little, and Steve kissed him softly for a moment before his attention was caught by an explosion on screen and he turned his head back.
“Never better,” Rhodey said softly. “You scared the shit out of me, man. You blacked out. Bruce said you’d wake up but, fuck, I dunno—”
Steve shut his eyes, tipping his head forward into Tony’s. This was… big. Bigger than any other chance they’d had before. Tony had worked it out now, and all they had to do was act on it. Try. Do better than last time, do something that might actually bring everyone back.
“Anyway,” Tony said eventually, laughing, “sorry, I’ve been talking for a million years. You really should just tape my mouth shut one day, I swear to God.”
and Tony wanted to be in a relationship with him and God, the thought still sent electricity racing down his spine.
Tony cocked his head at the man in front of him. “Johnny Storm isn’t going to be happy when he finds out he’s got a knockoff version of himself running around New York,” he declared as he lifted his repulsors and fired.
“By looking up at the sky, thinking- ‘oh, hey, that’s the most famous star in the sky and changing it to something obnoxious would make my boyfriend cry real tears, so I’m just gonna put my credit card away, this once’,” Steve told him firmly.
“Please don’t, Tony,” he said, shaking his head, “whatever you’re about to say, I don’t… just leave it. I’m fine.”
“Really- I personally would’ve said more along the lines of cyberpunk, but y’know, I guess I can see a bit of the retro aesthetic too,” Tony looked up at him- filthy from engine grease and smoke patches, hair falling into his face in messy strands, stripped down to a worn-out tank top and the jeans he’d been wearing last night. “Hi.”
“I don’t need to hold onto the hope that I can find him any more, Tony,” he whispered, shaking his head. It hurt to say. It would probably always hurt. But he had to move on. He had to. “Bucky… was my best friend. And he died. And I wanted to cling on, because I had nothing else. But this is a wild goose chase, Tony, you know that. I think you probably did from the very start, so thanks for humouring me I guess.” Tony chuckled lightly, a little wet, and Steve pushed on. “So I want to turn off the searches that we haven’t checked in two months anyway. I want to let him rest. Can we?”
, he wanted to say, but like every other word that had tried to force its way up through his non-responsive throat, the sound never made it past his teeth.
Tony glanced down at his hands as Steve reprimanded Bucky from beside him. Their methods of comfort were rather stark in their contrast; Steve preferred to be motherly and gentle, whereas Bucky was more of a ‘get up and walk it off’ kinda guy. “Think I made it out in one piece this time, Buckaroo,” he assured with a small grin.
“I feel like we should introduce ourselves properly,” Steve yelled, not entirely sure where his brain-to-mouth filter had disappeared off to all of a sudden. “I’m Steve Rogers. Hi.”
Tony groaned down the line and started shouting a few seconds after. The three guys just smiled and stepped forward.
“Nope,” Steve interrupted, pushing Tony’s hips back on to the bed before rolling off him, grinning cheekily, because he was a
And get on with it Steve did, because by the time the movie was over Tony’s whole forearm was covered with little doodles. Flowers and patterns and cartoon Avengers spattering across his skin, painting a lovely picture as to what exactly went on in Steve’s head.
“And if there are more HYDRA teams following the others right now?” Clint questioned, face hard, “if there are enemies with equipment that can hunt them down way better than we can? They’ll attack again and this time we’ll be four hours down the mountain. They won’t stand a chance.”
okay so due to the fact that I am notoriously terrible with timelines and also am British, i fucked up with the scheduling of the school holiday in America and stuff, which has resulted in steves birthday being the 12th of september. just roll with it.
Unable to resist, he pulled his phone out from the pocket of his hoodie and opened it up, going straight to Tony’s contact.
Later that night, when Steve broke the news that he was actually Officially dating Tony to his two friends, they’d gone and had another celebratory night in the bar, but this time, they’d taken Tony with them. The newest member of their group.
Tony asked incredulously, all anger forgotten as he stepped forward, sliding over the table in the center of the room and putting his hands on Steve’s shoulders.
He took in an anchoring breath and pressed his mouth into the top of Peter’s head once more. The baby gurgled happily. Safe, safe, safe and protected. “He’s ruining your tie,” Steve murmured softly, trying to tug the silk out of Peter’s mouth. Unfortunately, it seemed like a lost cause; Peter held firm with his teeth, and after a second or two Steve simply gave up with a defeated shrug.
God, he was actually doing this, wasn’t he? Last time he’d seen Tony, he’d been moving all of his stuff out of the man’s fucking home, trying his very hardest not to look him in the eye. This hardly even felt real. But then, of course, Steve watched the front door of the mansion open and Tony hurriedly step out of it, flooding the drive with light, and nothing had ever felt more startlingly,
He happily drifted back into unconsciousness for a moment, letting his head fall against the floor that he’d been wishing to swallow him whole a few hours ago. It was comfy there- or at least, comfier than sitting up and rolling back into bed.
“Thought you didn’t even like him?” He asked Sam, his eyebrow raised. In front of him, Sam just shrugged, looking a little sheepish.
playing this game today, Tony, I’ve seen you. You haven’t stopped grinning for pretty much 7 hours.”
It was easy to imagine you were meaningless, when you looked up at something like that. But Steve… it just made him more desperate to look out for the stupid rock they called home. They still had to make their place in the galaxy. They still had so much to give. And Steve would protect that until his dying day.
Steve sighed. “Love you too, sweetheart,” he muttered, before palming a hand over his forehead and leaning back against the wall just as the evac team all jogged through the doors. It was going to be a long few hours.
There were more bodies in this room than anywhere, mainly because Tony figured these guys hadn’t been able to flee the compound, and had instead been trapped right in the eye of the storm. Looked like they’d been scientists, mainly. Few soldier uniforms. Tony felt no sorrow for them. He stepped over their corpses and headed over to the corner where Steve was tucked away. “Sweetheart?” He tried again, “Steve, it’s me. Tony Stark. I’m the cool red and gold robot that’s coming toward you now.”
The grin on Bucky’s face was huge. “What, a worthless son of a bitch?” He asked, and Tony just sighed.
Tony pulled Peter more firmly against his chest, looking down at the little boy. His heart clenched painfully. What must this baby have gone through for the first few months of his life? If it was true- if that was the reason AIM were coming for him, then he must have been in their care ever since birth. Jesus- had he ever even been cared for properly? Hugged? No wonder he wasn’t crying right now. He was probably used to shit like this,
Steve gritted his teeth. “80% of any infiltration is all about walking like you know what you’re doing,” he said weakly. “I’m going to tell the receptionist that I’m taking you to meet your lawyer. You’re going to spit and curse at yell at me about how you’re going to ruin my life and sue me for everything I own, then sue SHIELD for everything that
Steve huffed, falling back into the bed as Tony pushed himself up and then- “wait, Tony, what are you doing?”
“I’m sorry Miss Romanov, but that’s confidential. We’re just here to respond to the matter and try to make sure that any potentially vulnerable children are accounted for.”
Tony smiled at him, his hands wrapping gently around either side of Steve’s neck while he leaned down to kiss him. He felt… well, he felt a lot of things. Relieved, mainly, that he hadn’t ruined all of this. Glad that Steve had confided in him. A little horny, but that was just a constant whenever Steve was around, so he couldn’t really count that.
Flame Guy- Cass- stepped forward with a small shrug. “Oh, nothing, actually,” he admitted casually, “we were just hired to draw you in here and keep you there. Our employers told us where abouts in storage you guys were keeping the energy field, and that all we needed to do was put you on that side of it, and viola.” He turned, clapping his colleagues on the shoulders. “Well done guys. This was executed perfectly. Chinese food is on me tonight, ‘kay?”
Steve was carefully stood on the other side of the room, hands in his pockets as he plastered himself up at the wall and looked numbly at the wall parallel to Tony. “Sorry,” he said again, quiet, “I’ll—next time, I’ll remember.”
“So tell me the real reason why you missed out on all this,” Steve said, after a few seconds of silence.
He found himself standing again; a hand balancing on the huge chimney as Tony remained sat and pulled out a cigarette from his pocket. Steve knew he was being stared at, but he couldn’t take his eyes off the view. He’d lived in some bottom-floor flat in Brooklyn for most of his life; he’d never seen so much laid out in front of him like this before.
Thirty seconds later, and Tony was snoring lightly into Steve’s shoulder, just as Steve predicted. He grinned to himself, kissing the nearby forehead one last time before resting his hand over Tony’s reactor and following suit.
Steve rolled his eyes and then kissed Tony’s neck, mouth lingering against the other man’s pulse. “S’good for ya,” he murmured, “Your cholesterol’s too high.”
“Shut up and drive, jerk,” Steve kicked the driver’s seat impatiently and rubbed his hands together, “your car isn’t going to bear our weight for much longer and I don’t want it to fall apart whilst we’re in the middle of the highway.”
Damn fucking right it had. Tony laughed, and metal coin begin to warm up under his clammy hand. “It’s all still going to be there when I wake up. The work and—and the want, and the fucking… everything.”
Certainly a nice way to wake up, Steve thought, breathing in sharply as Tony dug his teeth into the soft spot just under Steve’s jaw. He moved his hand, curled it into Tony’s hair and gripped, just the way he knew Tony liked it, and heard the pleased little grunt he got in response, the man’s thigh shifting so it pressed down between Steve’s.
Of course, he should’ve known it wouldn’t last. That just wasn’t how his day was gonna fucking go, was it.
“Mind if you do the honours while I grab a shower?” Steve asked, wrinkling his nose a little and poking Peter in the side accusingly. “He peed on me while I was changing his diaper.”
With a small groan, he pressed the heels of his palms into his eyes, uncaring off the way it pulled at his sore nose. The feelings of the dreams were often worse than the images themselves. Steve dreamed in emotions, of the pain of it, the complete and all-consuming loneliness that was still weighing heavy on his heart, even now he’d woken up.
“Stop calling her a piece of crap and buckle yourself in, Rogers,” Bucky turned back to face the road, turning the keys and then wincing at the unholy noise it made in response. “This is fine, by the way. Just means it’s turning on.”
Steve ducked his chin a little, trying to follow the broken fragments of what Troy/Chad/Jace had been trying to say. “You’re apologising?”
Certainly a rather swift change in mood, Steve thought as he screamed. “Thor! Thor put me down right now!”
Steve blushed sheepishly. “You, uh. You seemed very pleased with it. I didn’t want to step on your moment.”
Sensing that Tony wasn’t going to be up for talking any time soon, he quietly cleaned up and then made his way over to the gym to vent out some of his frustrations. There he stayed for about an hour, punching away at the bag and running through combinations that had been drilled into him years ago, just to feel something familiar, sense the pull of muscle under his skin.
Tony looked up at him for a few more seconds, before turning back down to continue without speaking. But Steve could see him holding back a smile, and the back of his neck was turning pink again, holy
. And Goddamn it, Steve knew him. He knew, in his heart, that Tony could never be the man everyone at SHIELD said he was, no matter what he’d been accused of doing. Steve had watched him tip waitresses a thousand dollars, watched him go to orphanages and hold babies just for the sake of letting them feel loved. He was a good man when Steve had left him, and people didn’t change that quickly in a year. They couldn’t.
In the other room, he could hear Tony arguing with Clint, his voice frantic and angry. He was trying to get out of bed, and Clint wasn’t letting him. “Clint, dammit, he’s out there and he needs me! Tell him to come here or let me go out, but either way, I have to- I have to see him.”
“What can I say, I’m a complete hypocrite,” Tony admitted, smiling softly at Steve, before nudging him with his thigh. “I’m serious, though, you need-”
“Steve, if you don’t want to, and you’d rather be alone, that’s absolutely fine,” Tony said, giving him a sad smile as he began backing away, “you go, uh, do your thing. Have fun, be merry, it’s your birthday, you deserv-”
“Hey-“ Steve paused for a second as the question jumped into his mind, and Tony looked back toward him, eyes dark and huge as he stared, “why
he was getting redder and redder. Goddamn it, he hated his pale skin sometimes.  "The fact that you try so hard to keep everything under wraps... well, that on its own says quite a lot about you, don't you think?" He said eventually, picking his words with care so that he didn't accidentally offend Tony.
“Steve,” Tony said with a shake of his head, “he won’t. It’s an empty threat. He’s full of shit and he cares about Howard’s opinion of him too much to risk ruining it. If he exposed me, he’d expose himself. He wouldn’t do that. I’m fine.”
Steve just gave him a long look, until Tony just bumped him again, sighing loudly. “I think you know me too well, Steve Rogers,” he declared, twisting the spanner sharply a couple of times before finally sitting back, letting go of what he’d been pressing down, “oh thank God, my finger was starting to cramp.”
“Are you serious?” Natasha asked, jumping to her feet and checking out the contents of the tickets, eyes widening a little as she read through. “Oh my God, you guys, we better haul ass- the show starts in 30 minutes.”
"good morning guys, we are going to bed,” Tony declared, pulling Steve forward and toward the elevator as Natasha, Bruce and Clint all filtered through into the kitchen.
Tony pulled a face and shrugged, looking smug as he muttered “Seguo le regole di tua madre a letto” under his breath and then smiled innocently over to Reed as he spluttered wildly.
She laughed, raising her fist for him to bump. “Sure thing, Rogers, where do you want me to start? Foot massage? Birthday kiss?”
“Of course you are,” Steve agreed absently, hands wrapping around Tony’s back, hoisting them both upright as he brought Tony into an easy bridal carry, “but we had a long day. I think sleeping is in order.”
Steve smiled back, but it was heavy. “Last time, we had Iron Man,” he murmured, “we had Thor. We had a team.” Last time aliens had come through trying to take over London, the Avengers had been a cohesive unit that worked together seamlessly, Iron Man and Thor offering air support while Clint, Nat and Steve worked on the ground and the Hulk did some concentrated smashing. They’d wrapped up in under four hours, Steve rolling his eyes when he saw Tony do his trademark Iron-Man landing beside him, lift up his faceplate and then dip Steve in his arms to give him a smack on the lips.
Steve felt the rage curl in his gut and he snarled in fury, stepping forward with his fist raised. Something pulled him back, though- a sharp tug at his jacket that sent him stumbling backward, straight into Tony’s arms. He pushed out angrily, wanting to just teach that piece of shit a fucking lesson, but Tony held firm, his arm not moving from around Steve’s midsection.
And suddenly, he could hear something that wasn’t his own screams. He felt something that wasn’t cold or scratchy or agony. He smelt something other than blood and stale air.
“You like the ears?” Steve grinned, leaning forward in order to get his hands around Tony’s waist and pull him in so that Tony was transferred from his own seat and into Steve’s lap. Once that was done, he grabbed the shiny black plastic on the table and then opened it up, sliding them onto Tony instead. Tony smiled and batted his lashes, feeling the way his boyfriend’s grip tightened around his hips, the way his eyes darkened. “You, uh- you suit them better than me,” he declared in the end, voice a little throaty.
Tony’s face soured a little, and he shrugged. “He’s an asshole,” he admitted, eyes rolling upward with a sigh, “but he’s also pretty messed up. I don’t know- their parents are kinda distant; always away in Norway for their company, and Loki… I think he needed them. Thor does everything he can, ‘cause he’s incapable of knowing when to let things go, even when they hurt him- but it’s difficult. Kinda got dragged into it all along the way, and now he’s stuck there.”
“Once is enough,” his dad shrugged bemusedly, poking Peter in the side as he walked around the table to sit next to him and get to work on his snack.
Steve’s smile dropped off, and he began to shake his head, but Tony wasn’t having it that time. He jumped out of bed at a record speed and headed to the bathroom, giving Steve a thumb’s up before locking the door firmly behind him. Whatever Steve’s problem with Peter was, he could sure as hell get over it, because Tony downright refused to do the changing for a second time when Steve hadn’t done it once.
Tony thinks that’s what he loves most about Steve. Those hands can tear through walls and punch men dead- but Tony only ever feels them as a gentle caress. Steve is even softer and careful than most normal humans, and it must be so much harder to do for him. And yet he always manages.
“We are not the men we were,” Steve told him, “we are people with scars, and wounds, and pains that linger with us. You went through something terrible, and today you were very suddenly reminded of that. But you don’t have to apologise for that, or suffer through it alone. You’re not gonna get better if you’re treating it like it’s something to be ashamed of. It’s not. It’s just… it’s proof that you made it out. That you’re still here.” Steve’s face lightened and his thumb ran delicately over Tony’s cheekbone. “I for one, am incredibly grateful for that.”
But Tony just cocked an eyebrow in amusement, and before Steve knew what was happening, Tony had swooped down and then picked him up in a perfect fireman’s carry, walking them both down the corridor with absolute ease. Steve just froze in complete and utter shock. This was the first time he’d ever been this close to Tony. Oh God, he smelt like metal and lemony things, and Steve was looking right down at he perfectly shaped ass.
He slowly lowered himself to the floor, until his knees were touching Steve’s. “Hey, is it okay if I touch you?”
Tony froze at the door, wondering what the hell he was supposed to say. He didn’t particularly feel like starting an argument at this time in the morning- they’d already had to deal with the Clint and Steve fiasco earlier that week, and Tony was happy to leave it at that.
He sighed, letting his head drop back into his arms. He felt something tap against his head a few seconds later, and then tilted his head and eyed up the ball of paper that had landed just by his hand. Of course, when he opened it up and recognized Jan’s swirly handwriting a moment later, he automatically raised his middle finger in her general direction, trying not to laugh at the thinly veiled insult she’d written on the scrap paper. When he actually glanced up at her, she was just smiling innocently.
. He wanted everyone else to be fucking done with it too, he didn’t want to be reminded constantly of everything Steve had fucking done to him while Tony had just stood there and taken it—
Tony’s voice cut out and Steve felt his stomach drop as he watched the robot swing its leg out in a manoeuvre no human would have been capable of, clipping Iron Man’s thigh and sending him cartwheeling across the sky. He managed to regain his balance about ten feet off the surface of the sea, but from the way Tony was cussing down the comm, it had been a painful hit. Steve clenched his fingers around the two joysticks JARVIS had directed him to, looking at the robot thing down below him.
Luckily Steve had seen him go, and managed to scream at Sam to get to him before he fell, which he did, but that wasn’t the fucking point. He’d nearly died, and yet all Tony thought Steve gave a shit about was the part where Tony hadn’t listened.
Bucky was playing something obnoxious on the radio, but he turned it down and then turned to them all. “You have fun, kids?” He asked, leaning over the back seat in order to press a hello kiss into Natasha’s forehead.
The way Tony spoke Italian was absolutely beautiful to Steve’s ears. No idea what he was saying, of course, but it didn’t matter. He would listen to Tony speak like that all day if he could. He’d even heard some words slip out last night- mostly ones he could understand- muttered curses and compliments, slurred from breathlessness, but just about audible, and making Steve even crazier. He didn’t know what it was about them, exactly. Maybe it was just because they came from Tony. But to him, they sounded like some of the most beautiful things in the world.
“I’m sorry,” Tony had blurted out the apology almost immediately afterward, however, swallowing and shaking his head, “sorry, I didn’t… that was out of line. I need to cool down. We both do. I’m gonna…. Workshop.”
“You asked me to alert you when your father was five minutes from arrival,” JARVIS told him, sounding prim, and despite the fact that it seemed he’d just been cockblocked by a fucking AI, Steve couldn’t help but marvel at the way Tony had managed to get authentic inflections in the robot’s voice. It sounded almost human. A fucking annoying human, sure, but still.
“Oh Jesus,” Steve said, blinking rapidly as teacher pushed past him to disperse the crowds and get Ty to the nurse, “God, no, I gotta-“ he broke off and pushed past them, following the footsteps that Tony had been led off in and ignoring his friends’ protests as he left them guessing. He needed to find Tony.
Literally. He can’t sleep. He barely lets Clint out of his sight for weeks after, just in case. The thought plagues him, because he
Tony looked up, smiling again, if a little tighter. “Mm,” he nodded, and then got slowly to his feet, “but I just- I should probably go. It’s getting late. I’m supposed to be meeting people like-“ he glanced down at his watch and then raised his eyebrows, “-an hour ago.”
Suddenly the continuous noise cut off into a much duller thumping, and Steve opened his eyes, which he hadn’t even been aware were closed in the first place. He was stood in a large kitchen, occupied by a handful of people, most of them making out in various corners.
“Guilty,” was all Steve said, before rolling himself on top of Tony, elbows resting against the bed to stop his weight from crushing into Tony’s arc reactor. He leaned down a little, kissing Tony’s nose. “Happy birthday, darling,”
!” Sam scolded, whilst Steve just felt his cheeks begin to burn and his mouth go a little dryer than it had been a few moments ago.
not with Steve- but it didn’t matter. He guessed his reputation surpassed him, because it seemed as if Steve already assumed that he could. With some stupid fucking movie star that meant nothing.
Tony paused, breaking off and pulling away just a fraction. His eyes fluttered open and he looked down at Steve for all of one second before breaking out into a loud snorting laughter, dropping his head onto Steve’s shoulder as he giggled like a five-year-old.
“Stop talking,” Steve shoved her away hastily whilst they all just laughed, “you are the worst people ever, oh my God, don’t put that thought in my head-“
