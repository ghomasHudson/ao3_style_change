Steve never got to finish his sentence as Grant launched himself over the table and at Steve, turning it over in the process. Grant was punching Steve at a furious rate, having the advantage with a surprise attack. Steve, however, was able to recover relatively quickly. He threw Grant off his person and delivered a right hook before jumping on his feet.
“Well I told ya’ not to get him. He’s old. And I’m not changing how we eat because he can’t bend down.”
Sam tracks Steve with her eyes before and he must have apparently been out of earshot when Sam began talking again.
“ We can go walking again later, if you are not too sore.  It can be hard for humans sometimes when they are mating with a werewolf. We are more... enthusiastic.”
I would love to hear your feedback! Let me know what you think! And what you would like to see for a Strange and Tony relationship. Also, I’m looking for a Steve x Tony story where they or in Vormir looking for the stone and Steve pushes Tony off the cliff and begins to cry. Tony was begging Steve not to kill him because he had a daughter. Please let me know if you know the name of it.
“ I see that you are still kicking. You may want to keep your boy on a tighter leash because it looks like he is looking else where to get a piece of ass. And usually I won’t mind but I rather that piece of ass not be my son.” Bucky hissed again, tail slapping the surface of the water.
“ Well if you’re fine, I advise you stop flirting and get your ass out of there. “ Clint shouted back.
Steve leaned in again and gave him another kiss before reaching in front of Tony and undoing his button and fly of his jeans. He pushed it down in one go and pushed him forward.
Howard roared in anger and Steve looked as if he was going to piss himself especially when Howard pulled out a revolver . Steve paled and jumped through the window, shattering it.
They sat in silence for a while. Tony really had no clue where he was. He looked down at his clothes and noticed they were matching Steve’s.
Steve sighed again and began to type. He scrolled down a bit and put his headphones on before clicking on a video.
“ Grant you need to tell him. He has the right to know. And Steve I swear to god. Keep your mouth shut. “
Steve didn’t respond as he continued to look out the window remorsefully. Maybe Tony would be willing to talk to him if he bought some Italian food.
“ That and he accidentally opened his comm channel when you two were playing hide the cannoli.” War Machine Added.
“ Just wanted to make sure I didn’t have to call the funeral home yet. After your last stunt I thought you would be more careful,” He quipped.
When they were both back on land, He wrapped himself around Tony and held out his arm toward Bruce as if...
Tony looked a bit sheepish. “ I don’t have any STD’s but I really didn’t anticipate my night to end like this and I need some.... things.”
The blonde man smiled at him and draped an arm over his shoulders. He pulled him close and lowered his head to kiss Tony at the edge of his mouth.
“ Well get unbusy. He found out about Tony and wants to see him and you know how that pain in the ass gets”
Ah. Claire. The other Black Widow. What person would call themselves Claire Voyant? There was no creativity there.
Steve just shrugged. “ I think we have to keep him here. Who knows what he will do when he is out there to get Tony’s attention. He is probably going to do something stupid. He did a lot of stupid shit to impress girls. I don’t see why it would change now even if he was turned to a Hydra assassin.”
Tony Just hummed as Steve continued to kiss his exposed skin.   That Bucky was a ducking asshole. He was not that old.
“ Tony What about Sarah? The little shit is like if Chucky was actually real. She was throwing the kitchen knives at her stuffed animals. We have shitty genes, that’s why they are fucking nuts! And the serum just makes them crazier! Why the fuck you think Bucky’s kids are like little fucking maniacs? Your kids at least want to bang everything that walks by and or experiment. That can be managed with a rifle to shoot away dip shit wayward alphas and a schedule to make sure they eat. But either way I don’t think my heart can handle the stress of another kid. We need to be safe.”
Peter looked up and saw a guy with brown hair and eyes standing in front of him. Peter couldn’t smell what he was.
Bruce brought up a hologram of the pen. The creature was currently singing a melancholic melody. “ We just found him beached with that Hydra equipment on him. We have established a few things though. His-“
Tony felt his held being gently coaxed back the a large hand as a wet tongue licked its way up the column of his throat, and then switching to sucking, without breaking the skin when he reached his jugular. Tony wrapper his arms around the pain in the ass, encouraging him. He wanted to be extra good today so that Rhodey could perhaps get out of his jail time a little quicker. The dumb ass had struck the vampire after catching him giving him a kiss on the check. Yeah it wasn’t a good idea for a servant to hit a king. The only thing that prevented him from getting executed was Tony.
Grant scoffed. “ You are the most addicting drug sugar. We are never going to get enough of you.” He came over and gave Tony a small kiss to his temple.
“ I don’t. But he doesn’t really talk back and this is a new field of science really. No one has ever taken care of a mermaid or merman before.”
4) Bucky had been prisoner for a long time, but Peggy didn’t know how long and was the only survivor for the original group including the children. Those Hydra assholes.
Tony quickly finished the rest of his bath and used the toilet before dressing and meeting Steve back on the bedroom.
Tony stood up. He moved gingerly due to the soreness he felt. He was thankful that he was still naked besucase it would have been a chore to take off those clothes. Last night had been miserable even after the shitty sex. Steve has swollen up and was inside him for a while. Then when he softened enough Tony still had trouble squirming around to get that thing out of him. Who the hell just falls asleep after sex like that?
He could tell that Harry really didn’t want another run in with his dad if he could avoid it. He couldn’t blame him, his dad was intense at times.
“ You’re so tense...and little.. you definitely haven’t been fed appropriately, we will have to fix that.” Steve said softly as he continued to knead his traps.
“ What a fine woman you married. How drunk was she when she said yes to you? I mean she is way to smart to settle for your ass sober” Morgan teased.
“ Manic? I’m not feeling manic. Nope definitely  not. When I’m manic I am defiantly manic. I’m not manic yet.”
“ Shit, Petey-pie you know how to pick him. Dad freaking hates him. Does he know his son goes to your school?”
wall paper was peeling in some places on the wall while there were cracks in the plaster elsewhere. The carpeted floor was heavily stained, making it difficult to discern what color it originally was. Wade said it was a good pace to hideout, but hopefully Peter could persuade him otherwise.
"Alright, my driver Happy is on his way. We can either go straight to your hotel or... I can show you around New York if you like?" Tony smiled brightly at her, it never faltering even when she had to stop and think before shaking her head at his offer.
Setting up her bank account was the easiest out of her accomplishments during that month, as she had money to go into it but it was slightly annoying when she had to confound the woman behind the desk because other than her I.D. she had no other way of saying who she was and where she came from. This also made her realise she needed documentation and so she forged everything the best she could, creating a background story that would hopefully stand up unless someone looked to closely. Kitana got herself a mobile phone and after some debate with herself, she reluctantly added Tony's Number to it. Health wise, she set up a food schedule and exercise regime so that she can stay on top form. You see, she wanted to keep fit. She may only look 25 but she was 35 and while she knew she wasn't going to be aging, she wanted to look and feel her best. On top of that, she'd made a new friend. Only, she didn't really try to be his friend, it just sorts of happened.
"You're not looking quite so bad yourself Steve. I'm glad you took my advice and wore those skinny jeans, they look great on you." her voice was exactly the same and it somehow suited her look even more. Steve hadn't stopped blushing once but had found the courage in him to smile over at her and thank her through his blush. Tony was kind of surprised although he knew he shouldn't be. He'd been checking Steve's arse out in those jeans the whole elevator ride down (not that he's gonna admit that anytime soon) and now he knew he had Kitana to thank for that.
His speech turned rant lasted a long and from the beginning he let everything that he'd been thinking for a while now, get off his chest. She just stood there gaping at him, not believing he'd fire her and then say all those things about her.
"Now both of you are done checking each other out, what are you doing here Tony?" Steve's voice was filled with laughter as both of them ducked their heads slightly to look at the other one. Clearing his throat, Tony started to speak.
Her eyebrow raised as she realized he was checking her out, again and she looked him over. He was wearing a pair of black jeans along with boots so they were tucked in and a plain but smartish black shirt, not tucked into his trousers. Over the top was a suit jacket left undone and his trademark sunglasses were on top of his head.
"My names Virginia Potts, but everyone calls me Pepper, thanks to my boss." the now named Pepper was turning in front of the mirror, trying to see herself from all angles. Kitana had to admit, she did pull off that dress well. Not too tight but showing off curves, nothing too flashy but it looked modern and good enough to go to a party in. Looking even taller in those black heels, which go better with the dress than blue one's ever would, everything matches, even the bag with it looked good even though it was modest, just like the dress itself. Glad that she'd picked out the right outfit for Pepper, she put the left-over shoes away on the rack again.
A laugh came over the phone and it made Tony frown even more. He didn't know why he kept Pepper on as his secretary, he didn't like her that much, she treated him more as an unruly child than a boss, always making out what she was doing for him was more important that what Tony was doing at all. The only reason he kept her on is because no one else could probably put up with the stuff he did like Pepper does.
"Tony? Just come over here, we can talk better then and you can join us for something to eat, god knows you don't eat enough sometimes." Steve hung up before getting an answer, staring him down until he walked over there. Steve stood up and pulled another chair across for him and he sat down looking slightly reluctant.
His gaze seemed to stay on her legs and she lightly smacked his arm, growling slightly. "My eyes, are up here!" His eyes slowly went up to hers and he didn't seem the least bit embarrassed at being caught staring.
"Hey Steve, you on your way?" she knew he was ringing to tell her that he'd left home and was on his way to see her. Apparently, it only took him five minutes to walk to her shop from where he lives, but then again, he was the super soldier so his 5 minutes could be her 15.
She laughed aloud at the little stares they'd give each other, the slightly jealous look when the other one would complement her and the miffed look when she'd accidentally flirt with one and not the other.
After being dropped off in a very lavish looking room, she set down her stuff and wondered if she should start getting ready or is she should wait for Natasha to show up. As it happens, she didn't need to decide because at that moment the elevator in the main room dinged and she heard footsteps, very quiet ones, as who she expected to be Natasha walked towards the bedroom. Coming into view was the tall redhead and they both smiles at the sight of each other, Kitana's wider than Natasha's.
"Yes Tony, I've told her. Before you rang up, Kitana was deciding on what she was going to wear and I asked her if she wanted to walk in with me. At least that way, I know she got there safe and wasn't alone." Steve explained to Tony, blushing at his admittance on the second part, trying to defend himself in the end. The grin on Tony's face told him he failed but he also noticed a gleam in his friend's eye's that he couldn't recognise and didn't get the chance to try and decipher as Kitana spoke up.
didn't expect her to be having lunch with you. I didn't even know you two knew each other. How did you two meet?" his cheeky personality seemed to re appear again and the other two at the table shook their heads smiling.
Tony's voice went from very happy to slightly wary and sad. Looking slightly concerned, Steve nodded before realizing Tony couldn't see him and saying 'yes' into the phone.
Tony looked over Steve's shoulder and caught Kitana's eye and nodded, showing that he approved of the girl, although he wondered what the second part was. Jarvis hadn't informed him of anything, although he supposed if it was a surprise he wouldn't want anyone to know either. His train of thought was cut off as Kitana was blocked from his view by Steve who was hugging the life out of her. His eyes strained over Steve's back, watching all the muscles under the shirt tense.
Her voice sounded exasperated again and he frowned down at the phone before speaking not letting her know what he was really feeling through his voice.
"It pretty great isn't it? I mean, I am the one that designed it, you know. Okay, so this is the communal area, this is where anyone who lives here can go. My lab is one floor down but to get in you have to be invited in or have you own special pass code, and my assistant Pepper is the only one with full access, but that's only for the next few days while she tries to find a new job. Which reminds me. Jarvis, Miss Potts is not allowed anywhere with her high access pass code unless it is her own rooms or I am with her or in said room." Nodding to no one in particular and hearing an affirmative from his AI he continued.
"Yes, sir. Welcome back, I take it this is the Kitana Potter that you and Steve seem to like?" The slightly British robotic voice sounded throughout the lift and she jumped, spinning on the spot, stance defensive as she tried to see or sense where the voice was coming from.
In front of her was a large room with an adjoining kitchen just as large as the living room. Three leather 3 seater Sofas were placed around the room, all facing a rather large wall with an equally as large TV hanging on it. 2 recliner leather chairs joined these as well as a few beanbags randomly places around. Near the ceiling, a hammock was hung, also in a place where the person in it could see the TV. The wall with a window on it wasn't a wall at all but glass, probably with the effect of you can see out and no one can see in, just like down stairs. A glass coffee table stood in front of two sofas and one chair and underneath that was a very fluffy and soft looking black rug. The kitchen was opposite the TV, an archway leading to it. A marble countertop was in the middle and all the appliances were around the edge, creating an island. At least 8 stools were around the marble countertop and another smaller table was in the corner with two more stools placed there.
The next day was the day of the party and Kitana stood in her apartment thinking over all that happened yesterday. Not only did she get invited to Tony Starks party, in Steve's honour, she also met 2 other people from their little group. Thinking on those girls, she held a slight grimace as she thought of one red head. She didn't like Pepper, she reminded Kitana too much of the people she left behind. They left her behind first, so she knew thinking bad of them wasn't frowned upon at all, but she liked to think of them as how they had been before.
Pulling back, Steve grabbed Kitana's hand and pulled her over to where Tony stood and smiled, not letting go of her hand, silently asking whether or not he was ready to go.
"Tony? Hey, what do you need?" Steve questioned over the phone a slightly puzzles look over his face.
"You don't want anything? At all? I don't believe it; any normal person would jump at the chance of me owing them something! So what'll it be? Clothes, shoes, makeup anything you want I can give you!" He grinned the same grin as before, faltering slightly when she just shook her head.
"Hello Kitana, how nice it is to see you again. I take it Capsicle has invited you to my little shindig tomorrow. Were also celebrating Caps birthday too." His voice bounced back too normal, as did his face as he looked the green eyed girl over at the table. Today she was wearing black peep toe heels, with 4 black straps going up the foot to the ankle that had gold bits attached, see through black tights and a black and white Skirt that came to mid-thigh. For her top, she was wearing a white vest with a black lace off both of the shoulders top on over the top. The pattern in the lace were roses and it went perfectly with the skirt and accented her body well.
Deciding to risk it, she turned in her seat and saw him standing closer than he was before. Putting a smile on her face, she tapped Steve's hand and pointed him out.
"Sorry, I've already said, I don't accept bribes or anything of the like. The only thing you can do for me is, step far away from me and give me directions to the nearest Hotel so I can have a shower and get some sleep, hopefully finding this whole thing to just be a dream." her sarcasm showed through and he narrowed his gaze on her, trying to see what she was getting at.
Closing it back up again, she grabbed her jacket, keys and bag before walking out of her apartment door and locking it, making her way out of her shop and over to Tony's Tower.
She didn't look impressed, and just crossed her arms, staring him down with one eye brow raised. He noticed her gaze and stopped laughing. He stared back at her and looked her up and down as if noticing there was more to her than just her head. He gave a roughish grin as he noticed her short stature, legs elongated by heels and showed off by tights and a semi short skirt. A white vest was under an off he shoulders ripped black top and her bag was on both shoulders.
She glared at him for a while longer but his grin didn't relent. Finally, she sighed slightly and slumped a little bit before offering him her name. "Kitana. Kitana Potter."
"Oh god Tony, she has you pegged right down to the T!" he kept on laughing, not noticing the slightly glazed looks in both of theirs eyes as they watched him, both with small smiles on their faces.
She reared back from him, shock on her face as she realized what he meant. Her hand automatically came up to smack him but she stopped herself. She was new to this world, and even though he was a pig, if what he said was true, she didn't want to get on the bad side of him.
"You can wear what you like, you know that. It's a party, a Tony Stark party at that, so whatever you wear, you'll look nice and you don't have to worry about fitting in. I'm going to wear those black skinny jeans you made me buy last week along with a white vest and the red and black checked shirt but leave it un done. How does that sound?" he sounded slightly nervous as he finished, wanting to know her expert opinion on what he wanted to wear.
"Hey Steve! Just let me grab a jacket and lock everything up and we can go to lunch." Smiling at his nod, she headed back into her store and noticed no one else was in there. Locking her till and grabbing her short leather jacket and side bag, she stopped to check if her purse was in there before going over to the alarm panel and setting it for 2 minutes, enough time for her to leave and lock the door too. Before locking the door, she turned a sign that said, "out to lunch." So that it was facing outwards. Hearing the doors lock on the inside as well, she turned to see Steve behind her, with both Pepper and Natasha watching them from down the street.
"Alright. Deal. Now show me to a hotel, so we can hopefully never meet again, alright?" She wasn't in the best of moods at the moment and she knew she shouldn't really take it out on him, even though most of it was his fault. Even thought he was cocky and annoying, he seemed like a mostly nice guy, but at the moment, she just wanted to relax and try and figure out what she was going to do.
"All the people who live here have a code that let's Jarvis know to tell me there outside of the room. Now, this is the kitchen, we each take turns on cooking breakfast and dinner. We're not usually here for lunch so we only ever eat together in the morning and in the evening. If your ever here, your welcome to use anything and everything in here. I bet you'll be a better cook then any of us ever will be. If there's something you need and we don't have it, just tell Jarvis and hell put it on our shopping list or depending on how badly you need it, get someone to deliver it downstairs where It'll be sent up. Okay, that's it for here, onto the bedrooms. Each person has their own floor to live on, mines downstairs next to my lab, then Pepper has one above here but she rarely uses it and come Monday, it will be cleaned out and anything of her left over will be chucked away. Happy, that's my driver if you remember him, has one on the same level as mine, as It's the biggest floor, and because he's my bodyguard. Then it's Steve, Clint, Natasha, Bruce and Thor, although he's hardly ever here to use it. And that's the basic of the grand tour!" Everything he said seemed to speed off of his tongue, almost like it was second nature to say all of that.
"She's not lying. I did give her a lift home, after bumping into her pretty hard on the street and I didn't want her to walk home like that on her own. I did want to spend the night with her, but she said no and so I just gave her a lift home. And gave her my number too." he shook his head at the phone, rolling his chair back to his computer and typing a few things into it.
"Kitana! I've just come down to wait for you, how long have you been standing here? "He walked as fast as he could without running and eloped her in a hug which lasted longer than both would care to admit, neither wanting to let each other go. Because they were in public, they did eventually let go just so no one would notice the long exchange and gossip to the wrong people about it.
After eating they talked some more before both walked her back to her shop, which she gave Tony a full tour of. He got to see her when working as a small group of ladies walked in looking for outfits to go to a gypsy wedding in. According to Tony, she handled them better than he could handle his business associates. That's why he leaves them to Pepper, he says. Frowning again as her name came up in her head, she turned on the spot and grabbed a bag that was on the sofa, opening it and making sure everything she would need for the party that night was in it. Obviously, the bag was only for appearances, as she could magic anything she needed from wherever she was into her hand at a second's notice.
"Fine, I'll take that as your resignation. By end of play Monday, i want your desk and rooms all cleared up.  Since i know you have an apartment not too far from here, i'm giving you till monday to make arrangmenet to move out of here and back into there. I'm going to need your pass codes and pass keys Monday evening, and you will be put onto restricted access until that point. You'll get this month's pay and you can still attend the party. Come monday, the notice will be going round that i'm officially looking for a new secretary and that you no longer work for Stark Industries. Is that clear? Good. Now, on to other things, I don't need you and I don't want you, not like that. I liked you at the start, Miss Potts, you were nice, kind and good at what you did, but lately you've turned into a nasty evil cow. You sneer down your nose at everyone, including me and my friends, thinking yourself better than us. Well you're not, you have no right to do so, especially when you know us and yes, were all annoying in one way or another and yes, I am childish most times and don't want to do the work I'm meant to be doing but that's because I'd rather be in my work room, inventing something new, rather than being weighed down with paperwork. That's why I hired you, so don't you dare start complaining about that, I made it very clear to you what you'd be doing when you started. As for getting a lower pay, don't make me laugh. I pay you way more than I strictly should, I pay for things such as clothes or shoes for any parties I host. Just because you have got used to living lavishly and pay for things when you get the money and then pay the rent on your penthouse that you are barely in, leaves you with hardly any money at the end, isn't my fault now is it!"
she hung up before he could say anything more and his hand clenched around the screwdriver lying uselessly in his hands before throwing it down on the table in front of him.
"Find everything you needed?" She started to scan all the items, noticing what Natasha put down was considerably less than what Pepper did. Natasha only has the dress, shoes and bag along with a necklace and pair of earrings. Pepper however added 2 pairs of earing, 3 necklaces, a jacket to match the dress and 2 pins to go in her hair. Not saying anything more when they both nodded to her, she finished scanning and bagging and told them the price.
The buzzing of his phone didn't disturb Tony in the slightest. It wasn't until JARVIS announced he had a message from an unknocwn number he identified as a Kitana Potter that he paid any attention. Telling JARVIS to read it aloud, he kept fiddling with the wiring of the gauntlet in his hands as he listened.
"We've just been shopping for Tony's party tomorrow. There's this new shop just down there we'd never seen before, so we decided to check it out and we found dresses on the first time. The owners pretty nice too, she helped us pick everything out and get it matching to us." Natasha's soft voice came over the speaker and she continued to listen to the conversation.
His grin became even larger if possible. "Kitana, a beautiful name for a beautiful face." He grabbed her hand and extravagantly kissed the back of it. Unbidden, a blush made its way to her face.
Turning back to Steve, she noticed him with a smirk on his face and an eye brow raised slightly as he caught her checking Tony out. Blushing slightly, she gave him a quirky little grin back and he let out a little laugh.
Shaking herself out of it, Kitana stepped out of the alley way and looked around her. She had not travelled very much in the years after the war but she'd recognize New York anywhere. But it looked different, more... Modernized. Especially the big building with 'Stark' written on the side. That building looked so much different to the buildings she was used to, that alone was her proof she'd travelled somewhere different, whether it was into the future... Or a different dimension all together.
"Alight then, we'll go to the Ritz Hotel, It's the furthest away so I'm gonna call my driver so I can drive you there and make sure you made it alright." Tony stepped away from her, going towards the opening more and then lent against the wall before pulling out his phone and dialling. While he spoke to who she assumed was his driver, she swung her bag off of her shoulder and place it on the ground in front of her. Crouching down beside it, she rooted through it before pulling out a very small pouch. In real life, it was an equally as big a bag as her back pack and inside it held all her money. Reaching in and pulling out a purse at random, she placed the pouch back inside and enlarged the purse when Tony wasn't looking. Inside the purse was quite a lot of money, but not in the right currency. Hoping the currency was the same in this dimension as her, she tapped it and quietly said "American Dollars."
"Sweetheart, I'm pretty sure everyone will love whatever it is you choose to wear and those that don't are jealous of you is because of good you look. Now you've told Steve, but why don't you tell me, so I can ready myself to having a heart attack when you walk into the room looking like a goddess." Tony's obvious flirting with her was stirring something up in both hers and Steve's stomach, although neither were quite sure what it was.
"Well Tony, we met in kind of the same way as you and me did. Only Steve didn't cover my mouth and drag me off into an alleyway just so you could use me to hide from your fans." letting a smirk cover her face she insinuated to what actually happened. Laughing at his sheepish look she saw Steve's confused face.
rinning mischievously, she pulled her phone out and bought up a new text, selecting Tony's number before writing.
Interrupting her thoughts, she heard the bell on the door go, watching as two red heads walk in, eyes wide in obvious curiosity. Walking over to them with a modest smile on her face, she introduced herself.
Walking forward, she lightly tapped both boys on the shoulder as she strode past, commenting before she left not to stand there and stare, compliment her. Both broke out of their daze blushing slightly. It was Steve who cleared his throat first, trying to find some words to fit how he felt at that moment.
About to speak, she was stopped by a large hand covering her mouth and a male voice whispering in her ear frantically. "I'll give you anything if you don't scream my name right now, I'm trying to hide from some fans and they're going to be coming around that corner any seconds now, I need to hide from them and after their gone we can talk about what to do to keep you quiet, okay? Good, you're coming with me!" With that, he let go of her mouth and grabbed her hands, pulled her up and dragged her back to the alley way she appeared from. Pushing her into the corner hiding both his and her body from view as well as both their faces and shocked her by kissing her full on the lips. Kitana stiffened in shock, eyes going wide and letting out a squeak. Just as this happened a hoard of people ran past, screaming a name she couldn't quite make out at that moment. She started to feel slightly light headed when he finally pulled back. She breathed in the much needed air and her mind cleared. Her eyes narrowed and she looked to the man in front of her, who was looking away from her checking for any fans nervously. Finding none, he let out a breath and turned to her, a shit eating grin on his face. It slipped off when he saw the angry look on hers.
While she was changing again, Natasha walked out of the dressing room in her dress as well as her shoes too. She's chosen the open toed ones as well as the plain black clutch with the diamante opening. The dress had two straps but they rested more on the edges of her shoulder rather than the centre of them, giving the illusion of being held up wherein realistic they were non-functional. It had a semi low cut neckline, low enough that it shows off some cleavage but not enough that it's indecent. At her left hip, there was a cluster of fake gems that pulled the dress together slightly. It was on the same side as the slit up the leg and it accented the dress nicely. It hugged her figure in all the right places and made Kitana quite jealous as she didn't have, and probably would never have, the curves that Natasha has nor the height, as she finished growing some time ago.
"Pepper will not be getting dressed with them. As of Monday, she will no longer be working for Stark Industries." His voice held no emotion as such, but his face did. It held annoyance and anger and something else that neither of them could place.
"I was you idiot, but your famous, I didn't want to be the one who gave Tony Stark a black eye." Sarcasm shoved through in her voice as she rolled her eyes.
"I've had an average day, nothing of any importance has really happened, except all my friends grilled me because I didn't tell them that it was my birthday tomorrow, and so there throwing a party for me. That's why those two were looking for an outfit." he seemed sheepish, one hand coming up to rub the back of his head.
"Fine, but then you'll have to explain what your wearing. And if anything I've heard about your parties is true, I hope you're still wearing them by the time the parties over." to try and get away from her slightly blush, she chose to tease Tony and Steve let out a throaty laugh.
"I think it'll look good on you, it'll go well with your hair." was all the comment she got as she walked over to the wardrobe and pulled out a clothing bag with her dress in and then leaned down to grab the shoes off the floor. Hanging it up on the outside of the wardrobe and pulling the clothing bag off it she reverently ran her hand along the dress once before turning to Kitana.
"I know you said not to get you anything but I wanted to. I got you a tradition card, because I know you'll like to keep it as a memento. And you present comes in two parts. I already arranged for Jarvis to set up part 2 while were getting ready and here is part one." she handed him an envelope that clearly had the card in as well as another smaller envelope. Opening the smaller one, his curiosity was peaked and it turned into slight shock at what two things fell out into his hand. One was a voucher for his favourite art shop, which he knew he would be going in soon and the second one was an invitation to go see a film he hadn't seen since before the war performed on stage. He had mentioned it to her one day that he'd been trying to find it but didn't want to ask or help. Kitana obviously had some money behind her as well as the know-how and the magic to do these things and she found out that it was going to be performed on stage for the first time and she got him tickets as well as two others so he could bring guests, as well as flight tickets there and hotel rooms and after the performance she gets to meet the author, who is surprisingly still alive and the play writer. It all meant so much to him because it was the last thing him and Bucky had been able to do before they both eventually went to war.
"No Pepper, if I was that desperate, I'd have to stoop as low as asking you, wouldn't I?" Tony's sarcasm reached its peak crossing the line from sarcasm to being cruel, but he didn't care. what she was saying inadvertently about Kitana was uncalled for and he won't stand for it. He knew he was a man whore, he accepted that, but insinuating that Kitana was easy if she got drunk made his blood boil. What he said wasn't nice but he'd had enough of the attitude that Pepper suddenly seemed to get over the last few month, pulling on every nerve he had, getting more and more demanding and bossy and thinking she knew what was best for both him and his company. Now, she was getting up in his face about a girl who she didn't even know and if he had his way, never would. Taken aback looking like she'd been slapped. "How could you say that to me! I've been nothing but kind to you, putting up with your childish behaviour for years now, doing all the work you should be doing for a lower pay than I should be working at, letting you walk all over me and hit on me anytime you want! I don't deserve any of this, I should quit!" She sounded so distraught throughout this but at the end, her voice contained a smug note, thinking he'd never let her quit or fire her, he needed her. She wasn't really upset, she just said all those things to make him feel bad and kiss up to her, all the while giving her a raise.
his voice was not back at happy but unless you concentrated you couldn't tell, but both the people at the table could pick up the tension in it.
"Hello, my names Kitana and welcome to 'Fallen Angels', I'm the owner. is there anything I can help you with today ladies?" she hoped her voice matched her smile as she was still slightly nervous about dealing with new people even though she'd been doing it for two weeks.
"Hello Jarvis, its eh nice to meet you too." Kitana slowly replied, still looking over at Tony slightly quizzically. He noticed her stare and was just about to speak when the doors dinged and opened.
"Alright, since your girl might top what I got you, let's go down to party and not only show off the birthday boy but this beautiful angel here." Tony's as smooth as ever when it comes to words and they both smile bright megawatt smiles back at him and they head towards the elevator and towards the party, hoping everything goes alright and to plan.
"Alright, so let me get this straight. You've met before and he took your first kiss by dragging you to an alley way so he could hide from fans? And you didn't hit him one for it? You've got some staying power, had than have been me in your position, I'd have hit him as soon as his lips touched me." All three laughed at his words, even though they weren't that funny, it was just the image of Tony trying to drag Steve into an alley way and kiss him. It just wasn't possible. Especially since Steve could just plant his feet and nothing would be able to move him. No one really noticed due to their laughter but Steve had a slight blush on his face and curiously enough, so did Tony.
"Yes, I believe I may be able to help you, what kind of party is it? Casual, semi casual, business?" she listed off a few things, looking them both over to get their sizes and what would look good with their skin and hair colour.
Peppers voice sounded exasperated as she answered the phone. Smiling an even bigger smile, he started out very cheerful.
"Thank you for shopping here, I hope you enjoy your party and come back another time if you need anything more." she said that to just about every customer, but she made it seem like she was only saying it to them because she liked them. Her phone ringing bought her out of her thoughts as she watched them walk towards the door.
"What do you mean Kitana's coming? The same Kitana that owns the boutique we bought our dresses from? Why invite her, I know you both said you know each other but god Tony, are you that desperate to get into her pants that you invited her just so she'd get drunk and sleep with you?"
"JARVIS, ring Miss Potts for me please?" his thoughts running a mile a minute, he wanted to know if Pepper was still at the store and what she thought of it and its owner.
"That will be $1,063.99 please." she saw Natasha's eye's winded slightly at the price but before she could say anything, Pepper had already handed her a card and she swiped it through, the name 'Stark' showing up on the screen before accepting it. Nodding at them, a bright smile still on her face, she handed the card back.
By the time came around for Steve and Tony to pick Kitana up, you could barely recognise her from before. Before, she was very pretty who did it almost naturally but now, as she wore the dress and heels with nearly all of her hair piled on the top of her head in curls with two framing her face on either side and her make up done as a natural Smokey eye and thin winged eyeliner and red lipstick, she looked something more than gorgeous. Or at least, that's what Steve and Tony thought as they tried to find the ability to form words again.
"You don't have to do that for me. I was going to invite you to the party though. I know you've met Tony and now Pepper and Natasha. And an outfit for you isn't a problem. So, what do you say? Are you going to come?" he seemed so hopeful, that even if she wanted to say no, which she didn't, that she couldn't say no.
"Yes, he's my boss. I'm his secretary. Is that a problem?" Pepper challenged her with her voice and she shook her head, a fake smile on her face while she was inwardly glaring at her.
"Not in so many words. She mouthed off one too many time about me, my company and... About Kitana and she threatened to quit, so I fired her and told her she could still attend the party but come Monday morning, she needed to have everything packed up from here and her office and anything that's not will be tossed in the Junk." They both gaped at her before a small smile made its way on Kitana's face without her knowing it. she quickly stopped that thought, not wanting the others to think she's a bitch.
"Kitana! You made it! I take it the walk here wasn't as hard as you'd though It'd be?" It was Steve and he was his usual kind and charming self, teasing her with the last part, pulling her in for a hug just as long as the one she and Tony shared downstairs, if not longer.
"Pepper, how goes the dress hunting? Find anything that I'd want on my bedroom floor? And what about the lovely Natasha? Has she found anything the is more than likely going to be off her body before the end of the night?" He's only joking with her; he doesn't like Pepper that way. Natasha on the other hand, that red head he wouldn't mind trying to get with but he likes his balls exactly where they are, thank you very much.
"Sorry Peps, not going to work. You can still attend the party, and finish up any business that you were going to tonight and then you can get a head start on trying to find some place to work and probably some other place to live. Alright? Nothing's going to change my mind Pepper. I've been wanting to do this for months, but you haven't really given me any reason to until the last few days. Oh, and that woman you so carelessly insulted minutes ago? Yeh, you and she are a lot alike in many ways. Your hair, whereas yours is natural but her is dyed and looks better than yours ever has. Your eyes are both green but whereas yours are paler green, hers are like sparkling emeralds in the sunlight. Your both powerful women, but you use yours to get your head above other people, making them think there lower than you and that you are above everyone you meet just because of who you work for. Kitana doesn't. She lets people do what they want but she gives them advice on what she thinks but doesn't force her opinion on them, like you. But you are very different too. She's a way better person than you will ever be and would never slander someone or insult them as you have her in the last two days ever in her life without apologizing. Now, go to where your stuff is and start getting ready for the party. Kitana should be arriving any minute now to get ready and since her, Steve and myself are all going to be entering all at once tonight, I need to make sure everything's in place." Making a shooing motion, he turned her back on her without waiting for an answer or a reaction and started walking off towards the elevator to go wait for Kitana in the lobby. With him never turning his back, Tony never saw her glaring daggers in his back and clenching her fists in anger.
"Is everything to your liking?" she had to ask, as it was only polite, although she had a feeling that if it wasn't alright then she'd know about it by now.
"It's your birthday tomorrow? Why didn't you tell me! I need to go and find you something to give you as your present! And a card!" Her shocked voice came out louder than she expected it to and a red blush came on her face as she ducked her head from the stares she received.
"He kissed me to hide from the fans chasing after to him. Took my first kiss he did." she teased Tony about it and caught Steve's slightly shocked look. Tony noticed it too and laughed.
Kitana heard the whole conversation that Pepper had with Tony. She wasn't happy with the secretary especially with what she was trying to insinuate throughout the whole phone call, about her nor about Tony. And she didn't like how she treated him. He was her boss, payed her wage and was paying for the outfits for both her and Natasha. The least she could be doing is be a little more appreciative. When the end of the conversation came, and Pepper just hung up on him, the coat hander that was in her hands as she eavesdropped was no longer straight afterwards. Snapping out of it when they both turned to walk over to the till, she plastered a smile on her face as they both came up to the counter.
"Yes, I did want to sleep with her, but she said no and I don't sleep with anybody unwilling. I'm not that kind of guy." Pepper
All the money inside changed, and her I.D did too, to make it seem like she was a US citizen. Hearing Tony say goodbye, she closed her bag again and swung it up onto her shoulder again.
Her eyes were wide as she took all of this in. It was like her dream come true. Especially the kitchen. Even though, from a small age, she was made to cook for her relatives, she actually enjoyed doing this and there for to have a whole kitchen to her disposal was wonderful.
"That sounds perfect Steve, you don't have to worry. That sounds great. I think I'm going to wear that strapless red and black dress. The one with the red satin underlay and the black netting over the top and the red satin belt around the middle. It comes to about mid-thigh length and flared out after the belt and it's perfect for a party. What do you think?" she got lost in her own world, mentally picturing what she was going to look like in that dress and she didn't notice Steve looking at her with an indulgent smile.
A large grin came upon his face as he remembers the red headed and green-eyed girl he'd knocked into a month ago. Reading the text again, he cocked his eye brow up at some things.
"So, we have 40 minutes to get ready before Tony wants to meet you and Steve, what would you like to do first? I'd suggest makeup so if it goes wrong we don't spill it down our outfits." Natasha's voice sounded as though she'd already made up her mind and Kitana knew it, so she just smiled and nodded along agreeing with that. Magically putting her make up pack in her bag she pulled it out and set it onto the bed. Seeing this, Natasha ushered her over to the vanity table there is and made her sit down. Critically looking her over left from right and letting a small nod go, she decided that she'd be able to do what she wanted with Kitana's hair and Makeup and she knew it was gonna knock both Steve's and Tony's socks off when they saw her.
Walking at a slow pace, looking with wide eyes almost like a child would, she didn't notice what was about to hit her until it happened. A body hit hers at almost full force, knocking her down hard. Landing with a wince on her backside, she glared up and noticed a man equally as wide eyed as she'd been moments ago, only this time in shock and panic.
Ignoring those two she greeted Steve. "Hey Steve. How's your day gone then?" The smile on his face seemed contagious because she soon held one too.
He sighed as he pressed down on the non-existent wrinkles on his clothes and looked at himself once again in the mirror. He was going to be fine.
Natasha just smiled back at him. Bucky gave her nose a soft flick before leaning down again to kiss her.
“ Your grace deserves someone unsullied by others. And he is quite a handful. I don’t want his grace to be disappointed in my establishment.”
Tony looked up and saw Sam smile down at him. He clung on to her tighter and curled into her chest. He was scared.
“ Yeah our version of your Avengers. It was Tony’s idea...my Tony. I like the name Avengers better. And they were like a subdivision of SHIELD.”
Tony jumped up and ran out of the way. “ JARVIS! Prepare Mark IV for me now. We have to stop them before they destroy the tower!” At that Tony saw Steve throw Grant against the wall, leaving a Grant shaped crater.
“ How  what? How dare I? I dare because I hate it here! I’m not some fucking toy that you could do whatever you please with! I rather be rotting away with my friends than be here with you!” Tony spat.
“Better yet, love affair in the Army barracks. You know it happened Steve! Yeah it was incredibly dangerous for homosexuals during that time and you guys could pretend to sneak around and stuff. He would love it. I’m pretty sure we could help set up a mock camp in his lab. And you could probably wear your uniform, I bet it would really turn him on.” Bucky suggested.
“ I don’t know. Maybe you can convince me to  give you something a little more.” Tony said salaciously.
“ Osborne’s kid. He goes to Peters school. The brat had the nerve to chase him down and flirt with him in front of me.”
Steve immediately rolled off him and wasat his side with Grant. They both fretted over him, asking if he was alright and if he felt like he was injured anywhere.
He just shrugged. “ I’ll do whatever you tell me. You told me to sit on this chair and I didn’t fight when you tied me up right? Why would I fight you now? “
Peter nodded. He was still thinking about what happened with Wade. He had told him it was okay, but Peter felt guilty. He wanted to be with Wade in that way, he really did. He even told him so. But he just freaked out.
“ Peter, I really like you and I know this sounds cheesy, but I’ve felt this way about anyone. Please tell me what it is. I swear I’ll change.” Harry pleaded.
“ My friends and I are going to go get some coffee later today after school at this nice cafe down the street, want to come?”
Tony turned toward Coulson. “ Really? And where will I keep him? In my bathtub? What the hell? And how the hell did he get feet? Was this how he was getting around Shield? Why didn’t anyone tell me?”
“ I’m gonna fuck ya good ya know that right? Fuck you so good you won’t be able to walk for days.” He slurred. Tony watched in complete rapture as Steve bent down and nipped at a dusky colored nipple.
“ Can we stop watching this? If you guys wanted to see a sex tape I’m pretty sure I can find one with me in it on the Internet.”
“ The red dick head is going to make us clean all the fucking bathrooms at HQ if he knows that you are stalking him again.”
Bucky strode into the room when the super soldiers returned. He walked up to Sam and kissed her firmly on the lips with a smile.
Bruce looked up from his plate. It looked as if he didn’t want any part of this conversation. He looked meekly around and swallowed.
Before Steve could retort he saw Iron Man roll off the bed, his body shielding Steve, despite the fact the arrow was not aimed for him, as he dodged a familiar looking arrow.
Steve giggles and allowed Iron Man to push him back onto his back. He leaned his forehead against Steve’s.
Peter hummed as he looked up to Beck. “ Hmmm.... Sounds like that villain mastermind is tracking my every move.”
“ Please, call me Grant. That’s my middle name. I don’t want you to confuse me with this bastard.” He flicked his head toward Steve.
“ I’m doing this because I want to now come on.” He licked the cloth and nuzzled it lovingly. He undid the button and-
‘Yes,’ Tony thought, ‘ You have a fucking two by four as a cock.’ But for once he didn’t say what he was thinking.
Pepper gave him a small smile. “ Whatever you decide, I just want you to know that I support you.” Tony smiled. He didn’t know what he would do without Pepper or Rhodey.
“ Fuck that’s... yeah it would make me uncomfortable too. Consent is kinda a big thing for me and I’m pretty sure with you two guys” Clint said.
“ Jesus Christ I am out for five minutes and you two are playing hide the cannoli? You can use a bedroom you know. And why the fuck do you have to use butter for that?” Clint groaned as he rubbed his head.
Tony opened a bleary eye once he saw the familiar face, the events from yesterday came rushing back. He wanted to punch that face.
Wade just grinned. “ I wanted to see my favorite spider and deliver his care package,” he said As he held up a plastic bag from that Mexican restaurant he always went to.
“ Thank you for coming here today Director Schmidt,” the  anchor stared, “ these past few months have been a trying time for our country after the death of Anthony Stark and I know those at HYDRA have taken it hard. None more than Commander Hydra.”
Tony tucked his head and began to kiss Steve’s length.  He lapped at Iran’s began to fondle his balls. He swallowed his length and began to bob his head. Steve began to softly pant and card his hands through his hair.
“ someone put salt in his Starbucks or moved his stapler. I don’t know. Who the fuck knows at this point. The important thing is that he is pissed off and i don’t want to deal with him today.”
“ See! I’m not seeing things. There are two of  them. I wasn’t making this shit up.” Tony cried out indignantly as the two watch the soldiers pace in their individual rooms from the CCTV feed.
“ Well, I told you and I already did my job so I am leaving. Coulson wanted me to relay the message. And as for your leg, if you can get Bucky, that’s the one that bit you, to lick it it will heal immediately. If not, good luck with it because then that bite will never heal And I think that he may be a little more likely to help you now, seeing how much Steve cares about you. Now excuse me, I have a movie night with Christine.”
Geez the hell he would have raised if he new a Black woman saved his ass. He was there is his army uniform with a bouquet of wildflowers in his hand.
“ Well, his idea of grieving is not exactly conventional.” Natasha explained. “ And that statue was his idea and how he wanted to remember Tony, not exactly the most tasteful but I guess to each their own.”
All the Avengers has gathered and were watching the show below of Tony being pampered and integrated into the strange pack rituals of there resident mer-people. He watched as the blonde mermaid braid the hair of one of the brunettes. They all seemed to be involved in some form of grooming including Steve who had began to braid Buckys hair.
“ Everyone this is Tony. He is going to staying with us for a while.” Steve said as he motioned to Tony sitting down next to him.
Steve picked up a discarded cigarette and lit it. He gave it a slow drag before looking back at them.
He glared at him. “ What the fuck?! You could have put a fucking arrow into my foot! What’s the matter with you?” He yelled. Clint ignored him and notched  another arrow.
Tony smiled and told him to meet him in the theatre room as he scurried off. Steve smiled and shook his head. He was such a weird little man.
“ You Can bring your friends if you want. I’m totally cool with that. I know it kinda sucks to be at a party and not like know anyone. It is more than fine with me.”
I want you to know this as the same will happen with Steve. He is obsessed with you. And I don’t want him to kill you unless you are planning to go out that way. He is going to be crazy. I need you to know that.”
“ We like you,” Grant continued. “ we just have been feeling frustrated that’s all. You are always so busy and... we might have gone overboard. Don’t worry we will fix it.”
“ I’m not sure yet. I want to go into engineering. But more biomedical. I’m not even sure what school I would like to go to or what school I can get into.”
“ Let’s see about that smart ass.” Steve retorted back as he tried to charge forward again, Clint, Nat and Sam struggling to reel him in.
There has been numerous press conferences to discuss whether he was safe and if he would put on the Iron Man mantle permanently and not just to send kids through walls because they were picking on others.
“ Their kind tend to treat both their mates equally and often engage in sexually activities together.”
Tony was so impressed. He looked up at that clock. It was a new record of one minute and fourteen seconds. That was fourteen seconds longer than last night.
“ Just used Sams. Threw it out too, I don’t want to have the image on my mind of him cleaning his teeth with a cum covered tooth brush. “
“ So good... you like that, huh? My sweet bitch...so tight....like ya’ made for this.... gonna... treat ya’ right....”
“ I was just concerned. I wanted to know that she can actually deal with you. And dating does not include friends with benefits.”
Rhodey gave an exasperated sigh. “ Can we just go back to where you bitch about Steve and I pretend to listen?”
“ Yeah, i guess it is. My parents are out of town and I will get the house to myself for the week. So I decided what’s the harm of throwing a party or something, you know?”
“ I was just surprised they could were such things openly.” Steve tried to keep his voice calm, but he was getting more worried with the murderous look Tony was giving him.
Tony had to really hand it to himself not to roll his eyes at being told to eat properly at the table like he was some five year old. He turned to glare at Bucky and Clint who were both snickering behind their hands. Natasha and Bruce paid them no mind as they both ate their food.
“ But how do we handle him now. If he is anything like you Steve he is bound to be very possessive. And looking at you, I think it’s same to assume that he wouldn’t mind tearing down anything in his way to get to Tony.”
Tony pulled out the large erection and palmed it before kissing the tip. Steve whimpered and shifted his feet. Tony quickly swallowed him to the root.
“ Damn what the hell did you two do?” Clint asked as he walked into the kitchen to see a seething Tony sitting as far away on the kitchen table as possible from two forlorned Caps.
“ You were literally my fathers friend. Do you know how disturbing it sounds that you basically robbed the cradle and are fucking the son of your friend. That’s like the beginning of some bad porno.”
Sam walked in at that moment, “ You both look like shit. What happened to you two last night? Was it because you heard those two morons going at it like rabbits last night? Geez Stark, could you not afford sound proof walls? I will not be able to look at Loki the same way again.”
Merman, must have all the ladies going after you. Or guys if you are into that. I am not exactly versed in your culture. Buts it’s cool either way. “ the creature just tilted his head, as if he were fascinated by Tony’s nervous babble. Tony was now at his tail and saw that it was strapped on with some type of mechanical lock.
“ Look at you my boy, you look well.” Howard cooed. If this universe was not already weird, Tony would have probably keeled over by now. When did he ever coo at someone like that?
“ Tony! Talk to me are you there?” Tony saw the phone on the floor as heard Nat yelling out his name. He crawled over to it and picked it up.
Tony Gabe him a questioning look. “ You aren’t going to do like a rectal exam or something right? Because I would feel-ommf.” Tony was cut off by a tight hug. Strange held him close and carded a hand through his hair. “ You remind me a lot of him.” Strange inhaled deeply, smelling his hair. Tony stood stock still as Strange held him.
Stony fic where Tony is in love with Pepper but she grows tired of him so doesn’t allow him to court her anymore. So instead he marries Steve to make pepper jealous. Endgame stony. It’s a series. Last time I read it there were two stories. In the end of the first story Tony runs out from Steve to see Pepper and steve becomes sad  as he realizes the Tony may not love him. The second story, Tony realizes he loves Steve and becomes jealous when Bucky shows up after fighting in the military. Tony becomes upset the Steve spends so much time with him and starts a fight with steve regarding this. This is like a two part series. And at the end Steve and tony end up together.
Tony just nodded. He looked around curiously. There were a lot of books about microbiology and celular regeneration and the such. “I never  had any interest in such things,” Tony thought, “i like my robots. They are what are comfortable to me. I don’t like living things. Too much drama with living things.”
Peter giggled as he made a disgusted sound as Wade tried to kiss him. Peter finally relented and kissed Wade.
His fur was matted with blood, half of it more likely than not was Steve’s. The white wolf limped over, one of his legs cut open. Tony was frozen to the spot. Bucky stopped in front of him and looked at him, with big, soft puppy dog eyes and titled his head curiously. He whined petulantly and pawed the ground with his metal leg, as if he were expecting something.  This creature was dangerous. He brought this to the Tower. And oh god, he killed steve. This was all his fault. He killed Steve, the love of his life.
“ Well it’s pretty obvious that they have upsetted you. I don’t want them to hurt You Tony. You’ve been through more than enough pain in your life time.”
Tony ran for the fire place and grabbed a poker. “ Who are you and why the hell are you here?” He snapped.
They all made there way to the elevator and once they stepped inside Nat gently urged him to the back.
“ He’s been talking to Bucky about that since he first saw you in the conference for renewable energy. Said you looked so stressed and probably needed a massage. Did he make it weird?”
Also I am looking for a Peter x Tony fanfic. Tony starts talking dirty to him in bed and insults him. It Hurts Peters feelings but he doesn’t say anything as he doesn’t want to upset tony. Please let me know if you know the name:)
Morgan rolled his eyes.  “ I got the groceries Maria requested so I get to stay by default. I love your wife’s lasagna.”
They walked out the door and saw Nat leaning against the opposite wall. She rolled he eyes and flicked her hair back. “ Come on. We want to go home. What took you saw long.”
Tony had decided that he was no longer going to deal with Win-Steve.  That took too much time. If he had to deal with him he was going to at least reduce his hours.
Steve rolled his eyes and flipped them lever before kissing him again. Obviously he wanted to drop the subject for other things.
He followed him as he watched him travel to the buffet table of desserts.  The man looked excitedly at the display. A dark skinned man pulled him away and seemed to be reprimanding him as Tony sulked. It was probably because his last cholesterol panel was less than stellar and had the tendency to eat sweets before anything nutritious.
Bucky nodded and came closer as Tony sat down and pulled the left leg of his sweatpants up, revealing the white bandages. He undid them to expose the inflamed and bruised area where he had been bitten.
Steve repositioned himself and Tony held onto his cock, lining him up and allowing Steve to thrust into him. It was easy due to the extra slick divided by Bucky.
“ I didn’t rush you when you had your turn,” Grant snapped. Tony remembered how Steve had basically thrusted into him with minimal prep, holding him against the wall with his legs and arms wrapped around him. He had thrusted into him quickly with a hand in his hair pulling his head back as he attacked his throat. Grant was different though. He rather have Tony leaning over a table as he thrusted into him with said table roughly moving against the wall with each delivered thrust.
Tony and Winghead jolted up to look at the stairs. Tony paled at what he saw: his father, red with anger, with his mother following close behind.
Nat, and Tony walked to the gate that opened to the beach area. Winghead was already there with a tennis ball  that Tony had gotten him.  Tony smiled at him and sat down on the beach. Nat tried to sit down next to Tony but Winghead growled and crawled over quickly to the spot where she had been trying to sit. He would have knocked her over if she hadn’t jumped back in time. He growled again and adjusted himself so that his head was on Tony’s lap and his tail was straightened out leisurely put on the sand. His ball and anger were both long forgotten.
Before he knew it he was loaded up in the back of a van and they took off. He wanted to see where they were going but he was far away from any windows and forced into a corner of the van.
Tony slowly opened his eyes and gingery stood up. There in front of him, in his now destroyed living, was Thor holding Grant above the ground by his neck while Nat, Clint and Sam were holding back Steve.
“ You know that I’m just a consultant right? And I believe  I already told you my hours and I am pretty sure we are outside of those hours”
Tony undid the time of his robe and let it slip down his shoulders and off of his body. He stalked toward the bed and crawled up the bed to where they were.
Maria was rocking Tony gently, trying to further coax him into slumber. The boy really needed it. He probably would sleep for the next week.
“ I know. It was my ass. He beated it freaking black and blue. I thought Captain America was supposed to be wholesome and saint like. That spanking was not saint like. It was like sadistic dominatrix like.”
Tony stayed in the bed for a moment before putting his shirt back on and stepping out of the room. He walked out and into the living room where he saw Sam.
Grant smirked and kneeled in front of Tony. He roughly pulled down his pants and underwear and grabbed a hold of his cock. He began to stroke it as he looked up at Tony.
Sorry about the delay, I’ve been busy with school and work but none the less I appreciate everyone’s support.
“ If you want something that’s cook, let me cook or I’ll order take out. Don’t try and cook by yourself. I don’t care if you are starving never touch my kitchen again.”
Eventually my time ended and I was sent on leave. Thankfully Bucky had been call back to the Middle East a few days prior so he wasn’t up my ass. I had thought that I had finally gotten rid of him  but he ended up on my fucking sisters porch.
Steve grabbed his hand and gave it a small squeeze. “ We miss you. You have to come back to us. Come back to your family Tony.”
“ Who bought you?” Tony finally looked around the room and noticed three other people. A brunette with haze eyes sitting next to a boy with silver hair   And a man with dark brown hair and brown eyes.
Clint tried to reach for one but Steve swatted his hand away, Clint pulled back his hand with an offended squawk.
“ Of course Director, but don’t you think it’s the country’s best interest to know if there is another super powered person in our midst? Especially one who attacks school children?”
“ Nat, drop back. He’s getting upset.” The creature relaxed after a while and Tony guessed it was because Nat left. The creature lifted up and adjusted Tony to where he was sitting next to him. He purred and began to nuzzle Tony’s neck.
So I just packed my bags and left with him. We was a bit weird and awkward at first like just because he liked
Steve sighed. “We’re a possessive species. And seeing that he has made a claim, he probably thinks and will want to show Tony that he is a better mate. He still sees Tony as unattached since I haven’t given Tony a bonding mark. He will most definitely try to impress him. Him kicking my ass was just one step into showing that he is a stronger mate and can provide him protection. He made that really clear that he was stronger.”
What the actual fuck. What god damn rabbit hole did he fall down in where the Red Skull actually lowers to argue with Clint and watches Dr. Oz?
Bucky was at work and needed to be picked up soon. It was established long ago that a enhanced super Solider with anger management issues did not do well in New York City traffic. Well... it was that and the fact that the first and last time Bucky and gotten out of the car he was driving to test the steering wheel out of the car that cut him off was not really acceptable. Then the kids would have to be picked up from school.
Tony was about to comment when Bucky pawed at him with... well his hand and a very human Steve gave a very canine like whine and nuzzled Tony’s cheek in order to get his attention.
At that moment a very naked Bucky strode into the room. everyone looked at him in shock as the man sunk to his knees and placed his head on Tony’s lap, giving him a wide smile.
Tony panted as he grinded On the thing below him. He classified him as a thing as he wasn’t human, vampires were definitely not human mind you, and he was currently being a bigger pain in the ass as usually. Both figuratively and literally speaking.
Grant stood and pointed to Steve, “ Why the fuck would I trust him to take care of Tony when he let his supposed best friend fall off a train!”
Steve has continued to chastise Clint in the elevator. How he was being irresponsible and how he could have gotten injured. Tony just stared at the scene playing out before him. Steve was very much like a stern mother.
Tony felt someone put their arms around him and rock him comfortably. They murmured something against the crown of his head and seemed to be humming.
“ Again Stark, you don’t have to even do anything. You can be like a dead lay. Just lay back or bend over  and let them- ow! Damn it Nat! You don’t have to punch me.”
The man was wearing high waisted khaki pants that were held up with suspenders. His shirt was a light blue plaid button up with its sleeves pushed to his elbows. His hair was slicked back and he...
“ Tony, I’m going to stop you for a sec, please refrain from using inflammatory language as it won’t help with the therapy process and may escalate things.”
“Wolves are a bit different too. We base our attraction on smells and behaviors. Saving him was probably what started this and then he probably saw Tony’s humanitarian efforts and fell in love. Also, he might be attracted to Tony’s smell. He smells familiar and like home probably because he had visited Howard that day. He happened to me.
Peter groaned and tried to cuddle further into his pillow. The voice chuckled. Peter gasped out as he get a pair of soft lips on his neck.
Thanks for all the support so far. I hope you all continue to support my story. Also please comment as I love to hear your thoughts.
Steve blushes and spluttered, losing his balance on the bed and toppling over, grabbing Tony securely so he wouldn’t hit the floor. Tony chuckled  mischievously  and grabbed the loose book, scurry away from Steve’s reach as he looked through the sketches. Strangely enough they were all of Tony: Tony at a gala, Tony in the lab, Tony in the Iron Man suit, Tony... looking up loving at Captain America?
Peter nodded. Quentin straitened back up. He looked at Peter, his helmet still down and glared at him.
I promised my parents that I would look after my siblings since they are going out on a date this weekend.”
Morgan would always scoff. Like having a dick in your mouth is any cleaner. And then there are those people who are so unenthusiastic and make it look like it’s a chore. That would piss him off so much. He just gave them the best fucking blow job of their life, they Can at least fake being enthusiastic. It wasn’t like their knot was made out of fucking gold or something. What pricks.
“ Im fine with that. But are you? I was able to finger you open enough to do so. But I don’t want to push it. I’m fine with waiting.”
“ Get dress. I’m taking out to eat. If you are not in the common room in fifteen minutes, I’m dragging you to that restaurant.”
“ What do you mean it’s not decent? It was pretty fucking decent for you 30 minutes ago.” Tony growled. He looked pissed and if he wanted to murder Steve. “ And why shouldn’t I be dressed like this? I only dressed like this besucase I thought you would like it.”
Steve shrugged. “ The only thing he kept telling was to stay away and that Tony was his. He kept saying ‘mine, mine, mine’. He probably followed Tony because he thinks tony came seeking him out to mate.”
Tony leaned forward again and kissed him. It was pretty tame on Steve’s end. Almost as if he had never...
Tony just stared in awe. It was absolutely beautiful. Then the lab the Howard at ushered him to was like a wet dream on steroids. The beautiful machinery glistened under the bright lights and seemed to sparkle like diamonds. The holographic display was quite impressive too. Tony listened eagerly as Howard went through different projects he was working on currently. He asked Tonys opinion on what material would be best and the functionality of each design.
“ What feeling a bit lonely? Is my company not enough.” Strange tried to joke with a small smile. It faded when Tony didn’t  respond back.
Grant looked up at him with lust filled eyes and began to kiss him. Just like Steve, the kiss was definitely inexperienced. Tony led him and started slow. No use in rushing and scaring him. He let his hands travel downwards until he was at Grants ass and slowly pressed it downward so that their cocks were rubbing against each other. Grant moaned in appreciation.
“ Howard! Howard! Tony’s here! Come, come. Your father is probably in the living room already. Jarvis has already set out the brunch. He put out all your favorites.”
Tony had been so shocked that he had accidentally  dislodged Bucky from his lap, causing him to whine pitifully before clamoring back on his lap.
“ Damn! Where the hell did you find him? Can we trade schools? He is hot as hell. I would totally give him the Morgan Stark-Rogers special. So did you ride that knot yet?”
“ Ah! Found me again.” He gave her a friendly kiss on the cheek.  He should have waited until they were away from the tank.
He thinks that Tony must be in love with him since he went to go get him and that I’m too controlling of him and forcing to be with me.”
“ Then get on the bed. I didn’t bring you here to talk. I’m literally paying you to spread  your legs and shut the hell up.” Steve growled.
“ But Honeybear I wanted to have fun. I want more ice cream.”Tony opened his mouth for Rhodey to deposit more ice cream in it.
Maria cried out in excitement. “ Is it true Tony? Have you finally found someone? Is it Pepper. I adore her. She is perfect for you.”
Steve placed a plate of pouched eggs and toast in front of Tony and Sam. Steve grabbed another plate and placed food on it for Bucky. He paused in front of the man and glared at him.
Tony whirred around to face him, jabbing a finger to his chest. “ Listen asshole, I don’t care what Mr. Fucking L’Oréal cover model says, I’m not that fucking old!”  He snapped, it was just too much. Steve looked at him wide eyed and Tony felt someone grab him by the back of his coat and throw him to the side. Bucky was standing over him with a few of the other men, an array of swords and guns drawn.
“ “Well, Ms. Potts Stark was the only one capable of handling that device and he did very well and he survived. So I don’t see what the issue here is.”
Wingheads entire body including his tail had turned a bright red and  Tony felt his body suddenly become slack.
“ Holy shit, there are two of them,” Rhodey said breathlessly. They had finally taken the two super soldiers and split them in two cells while the rest of the Avengers were in the control room.
Hi everyone. This is another idea I wanted to try. I would love to hear you comments and feed back. Also if anyone can help me find this fic I’ve been looking for, I would greatly appreciate it. :)
“ Oh my god. Oh my god.” Steve and Grant chanted as they both paced inside Tony’s room. The minute they had touched down, they Ran out off the Quinjet and into Tony’s room. The rest of the Avengers looked at him questioningly. He just rolled his eyes and followed after them.
“ What is the point of having me here? I’m not apart of your team, I’m from a different universe.” Tony said.
“ He just said that it was important and we need to meet right away.” Bruce supplied. Natasha just rolled her eyes at Clint’s obvious displeasure.
“ You don’t want me either?” He whimpered, “What’s wring with me? Is it because I’m a virgin and have no experience?”
Sorry about the wait. I’ve been busy with work and school. I wanted to make a longer chapter, but I didn’t want to delay any longer than I have for updating. I hope you all like it.
“Let me grab some lube. I’ll be right back. In the meantime you two can get rid of the rest of your clothes.”
Then like everything in his life, things had to go to shit. It started with a headache then the vomiting. Then the insomnia. Then he got diarrhea. That was absolutely miserable. Steve looked at him with a pitiful expression and asked if he was ok. He just told him he had a stomach bug. Then he started to feel different. He wasn’t happy as he was before and that’s when he realized he has been off his medication for over a week.
After the bell rang Peter dashed for the front of the school, he didn’t want to be ambushed by Flash and his cronies. When he made it out the doors he saw his dad standing outside his Sprite cars, casually leaning against it and waving at him.
“ I’ll think about it. In the mean time, I think we should talk about this year’s gala for the foundation. “ tony said, wanting to get oof the subject. Winghead will not do good in meeting his parents. Or his father may have a heart attack when he meets him. Either way, it was what to avoid it at all costs.
“ And what do you mean sexual harassment? You showing up half dressed probably falls into that category too.
“ I don’t mind if all three of us walk together, if that’s fine.” Harry then looked over at Ned and he shrugged, obviously not wanting to start anything. Peter gave him a subtle glare. The traitor.
Steve gave him a soft smile and kissed him. He pulled back and had his hands on his hips, “Tony, thank you. It means the world to me that you brought Bucky back, but... I need you right now. I didn’t like seeing him with you... that close to you... touching you.” Steve gave a possessive growl before burying his face into his neck. Tony felt canines graze his neck as a tongue flickered out.
Howard glared at him. “ Maybe because every time  you call me that, I can only think of that girl you were banging in my den and who was calling you daddy!”
“ Prick said he’s busy.”  Tony said as he sipped on his milkshake. He needed to get out of the house and thankfully Rhodey had taken him out for milkshakes and a walk through Central Park. And fucking Strange. What the hell was he doing that was so important. It wasn’t like he was actively practicing medicine. He was just sitting in his freaking magical apartment going god knows what with god knows who. Seriously, what could there possibly to do in an apartment that took up all of someone’s god damn time to the point where they can’t step a foot out of it for a week straight? He had orgies before and they never lasted this long. And his orgies were awesome. Like the stuff that goes down in legends and shit. So Harry Potter has no excuse to just ignore him.
“ Are you for real,” Nat growled, “ You are mistreating him because of your homophobia? For fuck sakes Steve. He hasn’t done anything to you. He invites you to his home, shares his food and offers to upgrade your equipment and this is how you treat him? You know what? Fuck You.” With That Nat stormed away.
Steve giggles and kiss Iron Man. He pulled back when he heard his phone ring. He groaned As he threw his head back. Iron Man sighed and rolled off him so Steve could grab his phone.
Steve looked at him nervously and gulped. “ I... uh... made too much food.... and I thought that maybe you would like some... I mean...you haven’t had anything but doughnuts and I made some fried chicken and...um... I thought might want some...”
I’m looking for a fic that Tony x Bucky. X Steve. Where Bucky suddenly walks into Tony’s lab and he screams, alerting Steve who comes rushing in with his shield. Tony then has the coax the Winter soldier who is hiding behind an upturned Dum-E.  Bucky says he needs his arm repaired and they help him. I can’t remember the name of this fic and I can’t find it in my bookmarks or history. I would really appreciate if someone can tell me the name.
They were alone in the common room watching movies. The rest of the Avengers were absent from the tower, leaving the two alone.
“ So I’m going to pull out my trusty tool kit. Don’t be so huffy. See it’s nothing bad. Just a little toolkit. See it’s shiny? Want one? You can have the Phillips head. You’re not supposed to chew on it, but I guess that’s fine as well. Woah you have sharp teeth! You just bit that in half.” Tony kept narrating as he worked on the strap. It wasn’t really hard, Fury could have had one if the SHIELD scientist do it, but Fury rather lose him than a SHIELD employee.
Sam sighed. “ It’ll probably be easier to start from the beginning. Do you know the Falcon project? The one from the Air Force?”
Steve offered for Tony to take the baby. Tony know better than the argue. He took a spare Afghan on the bed (quite a few appeared on his bed after Steve and Bucky decided to sleep there) and wrapped him snuggly in one.
Steve sighed. “ Listen I fucked Up. Like all this is new to me still and I know I can’t blame it on being shocked or anything... I care for you. You mean a lot to me. I like going to the arcade with you, I like having lunches with and I like to talking to you. These past few weeks that you haven’t talk to me have been hell.”
“ Steve it’s alright. You can leave,” Tony said calmly. Steve looked at him in surprise and saw the look on his face. He nodded in understanding, getting the subtle signal. Tony will meet him later in his room. Steve nodded and backed up slowly, reaching the door and backing up and out, closing it slowly.
“ Can I put it back in sweetheart? And you do want Bucky to suck on you?” Tony whined and nodded quickly. Bucky kisses his way down To Tony’s pelvis and have no preamble as he swallows him whole. Tony gave a wordless cry as he grabbed onto the back of Bucky’s head. Steve slid easily into Tony and tony whimpered as he tried to turn his head as far back as possible so he could kiss steve. Steve chuckled and began to kiss Tony’s check and nose, purposely avoiding his mouth. Tony whined again. Steve relented and finally kissed his mouth, earning a low moan.
Steve continued to drag Clint and pushed him in front of Natasha who was sitting at the table drinking tea. Steve then retreated towards the kitchen.
“ I think I can add a little fun to your night what do you say?” Tony said as he began to lightly stroke over Steve’s clothed crotch. He didn’t know what other guys like but this seemed a good place to start.
“ They seem to be planning something. The two hate each other why would they get along now?” Nat mused as Grant seemed to be making wild gestures with his hands. Steve just looked at him and nodded as if he were agreeing with something.
“ Your happiness and safety are always a priority to me.” Tony cooed as he gently rocked Peter in his embrace.
“ Its kind of pointless. Remember last year? You guys had a lot of trouble helping us with Algebra one.” Wanda said.
Tony looked at him in disbelief. Nope he likes his parents better when they just ignored him. Yep that was so much better. He didn’t need them trying to set him up with marriage candidates.
Tony tried to fend off Howard but he grabbed his shirt collar and revealed extensive black and blue bite marks.
After about what seemed like thirty minutes. Tony pressed the housing unit of the nanites and felt it engulf his body. There were pieces missing in the armor but it should be steady enough to fly.
But the reason I’m telling you this is because the serum does something  to them. It like amplifies their personality traits. Like before the serum Bucky was  always racist and he had a possessive streak a mile wide. When he thought my uncle and my cousin were going to come and take me away from him and he heard some rumor that my cousin had assaulted me. But that all it was a rumor. He never did that.  He went to Louisiana anyway and tortured and killed them. I heard Nat say it was my whole family, but it wasn’t but it still doesn’t make it right. I saw the pictures in the paper. It was awful what he did to them. That the only reason that I don’t fight back. I don’t want him to do that to anymore of my family. Steve also said that he was also loyal to a fault. Those things got amplified with the serum and apparently when he met me and stuff like that could happen again if he feels that I was wronged by someone or if someone could potentially split us up. br />
I just handed him a gun and told him that we were breaking out. I probably should have shot him but with him being a super soldier it probably wouldn’t have done any good. Anyway while we were fighting our way out he told me he never seen a woman fight like me before. I had just ignored him at the time and told him that we were going to be picked up at the rendezvous site.
“ I threatened to harm them as they harmed my guards and I can’t have you running around hurting yourself . Once you have proven yourself trustworthy again, I’ll unchain you. But until that time, you will only be unchained at my discretion. “
Tony gives him an indignant look, “ Excuse me? Are you saying that just because I’m a nerd I am not athletic?”
“So before I was with Nat,” Tony rolled his eyes as Bucky began his speech. He knew how this was going to turn out and he glowered at Nat who was doing nothing to hide the smirk on her face behind the book she was reading. “I was with a variety of people, Some of them occasionally older. I found that it was better if they got a massage Afterwards, especially doing anal. It relaxes the muscles especially after a hard rutting.”
“ I love you Tony and I don’t want to do anything that upsets you ever. You can always talk to me.” Steve whispered as he ground his hips into him.
“ Please! Please, Steve,” Tony whined as the super soldier thrusted form behind. The cuffs had been undone and Tony had been placed on his stomach and re cuffed to the bed. Steve roughly bit at his shoulder and neck, leaving a series of bruises.
“ That’s interesting. This morning I thought you were just a rental that he was just feeling awfully clingy to since it’s been a while for him. I didn’t know he bought you. And if he actually chose you that means he you must have made an impression on him.” The read head continued.
“ When did you fall in love with him.” Tony interrupted. He had to know. The Commander just looked up at the camera, giving a pregnant pause.
“ You are a fucking ass, and you know it! Have you ever wondered why no one wants to be in a relationship with you!” Tony snarled as they were both now so close Tony could count the white hairs speckled through Strange’s hair.
Steve smiled and slightly cocked his head. “ You’re the smartest person I know. You will find a way. You will make it back to us. I believe in you.”
Harry was playing with the hem of his bottoms. Peter nodded and lifted his hips so that Harry could take them off. He gently tugged them of his legs and settled himself into the V of his leg. He began to run his hands up and down Peters sides.
“ More Like his first piece ever. He never slept with Peggy.” Tony raised an eyebrow at Nat who elaborated, “ Something of that nature might have been mentioned in their shouting match. So yeah, you’re his first.”
And the conversation began like that. He had included Ned too, which surprised Peter, but he was thankful for. However never during that time did Harry’s bright smile falter once.
“ Yeah but this one is like an exclusive trip. It’s like super high profile. And there is a bunch of like those tiny hot dogs with the croissant breading.”
Tony glared and was about to respond when Steve growled. “ What the fuck is wrong with you? I don’t want him euthanized!”
Steve and Grant blushed and looked away. Tony smirked. “ There’s two of them Nat, it takes twice as long.”
Thor just shrugged. “ He wanted to be a war prize one time and the next one of my father’s prisoners. He told me once it helped him with the bad memories he had of being a prisoner and made him feel as if I’ll be there instead and be able to love him. We both consented and it was his idea. It was kind of fun actually. We had started to laugh part way through when he accidentally tripped over the skirt of his own slave outfit.” Thor explained.
Winghead paled and look as if he saw a ghost. He let out a squeal before quickly clamoring off Tony and rushing back into the water.
“ I thought you look familiar. You do look a lot like Captain America now that I really take a good look at you.” Sam said.
Strange waved his hand and a chair appeared out of thin air. He sat down and crossed his legs, making himself comfortable.
“ Yeah not really,” a cocky voice said behind him. Peter gave a groan of frustration as he turned and took of his mask. He glared at the man who was smirking at him.
Steve quickly turned around to see Clint standing there with a box of Chex mix and a smirk on his face. “ Sorry man couldn’t help myself. You are pretty hung over Stark aren’t ya?”
“ uh huh. I may just happen to decide to clean the place right before you finish your shift. I think I can clean the kitchen table just as you walk in.” Peter said huskily.
He saw Brock on the ground, his arm twisted behind him and Tony’s foot on his back. He looked up and smiled, “ Hi Steve.”
Harry frowned a bit. “ Yeah i understand. It’s important to have some family time. I know your dad must be busy a lot.”
“ I’m just saying. I know that you aren’t very versed in athletics. So i thought I would just help.”
Beck fondly rolled his eyes, “ You are on every major news network. It’s not too hard to figure out your next move.”
Stephen Strange gave him an unimpressed look. “ Nice to see you too. I guess Mr. Banner was not lying about there being another Stark from an alternate reality.”
“ You were so perfect, my perfect little bitch.” Steve cooed as he dragged his lips along Tony’s neck.
“ Do you guys mind? I kinda have company. “ Steve motioned to the Barry conscious bodies around him.
Harry grabbed his penis and began to lick dirty strip from the base to the head. Peter reaches down and tangled his fingers in Harry’s thick locks.
Peter gave him a sheepish look. Of course he won’t text back. He had a boyfriend. “ Sorry i for busy.”
“ Well it’s kinda weird that he says he likes me and then does everything to hunt me down just to ditch me.”
Everyone loved a good run. Who didn’t? There was a great influx of endorphins or whatever their doctors called that thing that made you happy. And it was kinda sexy to be a little sweaty. And Steve knew he looked good with a little sweat from his workout. So when he asked Tony to go run with him, the little man looked at him like he grew another head and passed.
“ Really? Is that why Pietro has an ice pack over his eye? Because nothing decided he needed some natural eye shadow?”
“ GET OUT! GET THE FUCK OUT!” Tony shouted and threw the bottle of scotch at him. Steve ducked to avoid being hit. Steve looked up and saw Tony turned away, his shoulders shaking as he sobbed.
“ It’s Fine Your grace,” Tiny interrupted quickly as he sat down on a cushion. He can bed down, thank you very fucking much you fucking bastard. He just wanted to eat and didn’t want hear anymore Bitching.
“ Fuck!” Tony cried and and jumped away. The brunette had suddenly sneaked up on him and bitten him in the leg. It was gushing blood profusely. Tony raised his hand and felt it being enveloped by a gauntlet. Tony felt himself being thrown backward with a sharp hit to the chest over his arc reactor.
“ Umm...” Harry tried to come up with something but was too stunned at having Peter basically grind and rub against him.
Pepper cane walking over to him. How can this woman find him no matter where he goes. As Pepper approached him she held out a stack full of papers.
Instead of hitting the ground, he felt himself collide with something midair. “ Got ya,” Grant said as he swung through the air from a grappling hook.
“ Nat you know it’s me right?” Nat gave him an indifferent look before rolling her eyes and facing forward again.
Tony wrapped the cloth around the sole of his foot the best he could. He had decided it was a brilliant idea to run his mouth again and like last the soles of his feet were beaten and he was separated from his friends. He sighed as he threw his head back and let it hit the side of the cage. And on top of everything he was crammed in this small metal cage with wrought iron bars where he had to crawl to get in.
It’s because of Commander Rogers that I was able to be accepted into their tight knit family and adopt to my life I. this universal plane.”
Hi everyone! Here is another update! I’m happy that people actually like the fic and are leaving kudos for it! Please feel free to leave your comments and I look forward to hearing from you. Hopefully I’ll have another chapter up soon. Again thanks for your support.
Wade sat next to Peter bringing him to his chest. “ Shhh.... it’s alright babe. It can be scary the first time.”
Tony gave him an incredulous look. “ Ex-fucking-cuse me? I can so go another fucking round buddy. You’re the one who falls asleep after one round. I am so not a minute man.” Tony growled.
“ And he’s mouthy. Please tell me Frank How is this a good idea? Please tell me. I’ve been his graces assistant for a number of years. This creature will not please him.”
“ I better go down to the lab. Things to do and a company to run.” Tony said in that cheerful voice that held no mirth. It might have fooled him before when he really didn’t pay attention to him, but not now.  He got up and left the table with most of his plate left untouched.
Short chapter this week, I was busier than anticipated last week and this week. Please leave your comments. I look forward to hearing from you!:)
Tony would trade anything to get out of this situation. He would be willing to do anything. He would take a freaking golf lesson from his dad to avoid this nonsense.
He was very apologetic and kinda crazy afterward. He was like on high alert for everything, still is but was worse back then. He had even cut his hair like Reilly had it and dyed his hair dirty blonde like his so he could I guess compare to him. That was god awful. But he still occasionally cuts it like Reilly’s haircut when he feels a bit insecure I guess.
“ Jesús Barnes, loving the hospitality.”  Tiny seethed as he was man handled by said into the elevator of his own Tower. “ By the way, I love the handcuffs and all but when I usually use them, I get a happy ending. And word of advice, tie them to a bed and not behind someone’s back.”
Tony did not know why he said it, but he did. Clint looked at him, aghast that he would eat him out.
“ As you have said before. Repeatedly,” she said venously, “And why this district attorney? Is it because he formally pressed charges against a man who was wearing an Iron Man suit and had attacked school children?”
Bucky and Steve walked back into the living room.  They were in comfortable night clothes of pants and t shirts that looked one size too small.
They were arranged in a line and Tony saw a large blonde man arguing with a man with shaggy brown hair that came to his shoulders. Based on their size only, Tony knew that they had to be werewolves. His thoughts were confirmed when he saw their sharp canines.
“ Will He be able to bring them here?” Tony asked. He wanted them out of there and he missed them already.
“ Well is that it?,” Steve grabbed him roughly but he refused to wince as his sharps claws dig into his skin, “I’ll be more than happy to return you.”
“ No I’m not. That boy is nothing but trouble! I’ve heard about him during the galas. He sleeps around and just got kicked out of his last boarding school in France. I just didn’t know that he would be sent here. Let me call the bastard Osborn and tell him to make sure his son stays away from you.”
Bruce shook his head. “ That I can’t answer. I don’t know what goes on in the little blonde head of his and I don’t want to know. But he does care for you.  It doesn’t help that you look like the guy he had a crush on, but i think he does genuinely care for you. It’s just that he is terrible at flirting and anything with romance. He is geeky and kind of awkward with these things, but he does mean well.”
Hi! Please leave your comments. I’m glad there were people that liked the idea. Here’s the next chapter.
“ There we go. Don’t worry, I’ll play with you too baby,” Tony said to Grants cock, giving it a loving touch before turning back to Steve and fondeling  Grants growing erection.
He had already taken off his shirt and was kneeling on the bed when Steve came Into the room. He smiled down at Tony. “ Hi.” He said shyly.
“I think you talked enough already Cap. You made the message very clear. You don’t want to be around a fag like me.”
Tony stood there with an open silk robe that came halfway down his thighs.  He was wearing a black lace bra with matching panties. His arc reactor sat snugly over his bra, shining bright. He was also wearing a pair of black heels that he had no idea how Tony was balancing so expertly on.
“ Darling, you can’t really be thinking to fight in something so obsolete. I can at least add some Kevlar to the suit.”
“ Mr. Stark, it would be in your best interest to get your mouth shut until otherwise instructed to do so.”
Tony nodded and took off his shirt and laid on his stomach, his face turned away from Steve. He heard steve drop what ever he had in his arms on the bed and felt an added weight get in the bed. Tony stiffened when he felt Steve straddle his waist and yet again when he heard a cap open. What he didn’t expect was a warming oil to be placed in his back. He startled at the contact.
The Squadron really had to come up with a new agenda. The whole world domination thing was getting real old. It was a normal fight, nothing too strenuous.  Tony should have been able to dodge that hammer thing that Viking chick Thor knew was swinging around, but he didn’t.  And that sent he plummeting toward the asphalt.
He could basically hear Bucky’s eye roll. “ Yeah but that’s doesn’t mean you need to flash the world your Johnson.”
“ Come on Steve, it’s alright. We have to check for any damage in your teeth” Bruce said soothingly./p>
“ I was talking about the females. I specifically said females. I don’t know how his grace will feel about this.” Motioning to Tony in utter disgust.
Steve rocked against him gently. Tony let out a puff of breath.  Steve rocked against him again, this time earning a soft moan. Steve began to pick up his pace. Tony grabbed one to the shoulders of not-Steve and wrapped his legs around his tapered waist.
He sat down in the couch next to Tony and began to stroke his hair. The poor boy was so touch starved. It was like he had never received love his entire life.
“ Sam is a very capable individual with a unique skill set that is valuable to our team.” Howard huffed as he pulled out his wallet.
Came up. This time a young woman with what seems to be long brown hair.  They both submerged, only to be replaced by two more sirens this time both women one with brown hair and the other a blonde. They both went under too soon after.
“ I think it would be good for you to. Bucky says humans feel more pleasure during sex when they are happy. I think it would positively influence our mating.”
Steve man handled him until they were sitting on the couch with his legs gangling off Steve’s on one side and with his shoulder a giant his chest. Steve wrapped his arms around himself tightly, holding him close. Tony continued to struggle, kicking at him and trying to get his hands free.
The Commander scoffed. “ No. he was much too smart for that, but he knew I loved him. But I sometimes like to think that he loved me as well and in a different life I would have the honor to call him my beloved. Well then again, he probably wouldn’t want me to call him that in public-“
Steve sat in the other side of Tony. They had argued until Nat threatened them both and told them to sit on either side on Tony. Steve then followed Grant into the kitchen and helped cook as he didn’t trust him to prepare the Avengers’ food when he offered./p>
Harry separates from Peter before they left the building with promises that he would text him later after acquiring his number during lunch.
Apparently none of them had ever imagined him to be a father, but they seemed proud at how good he was at parenting.
“ uh, yes you are and I’m including you Steve because you were standing by letting Bucky get pummeled!”
Tony looked at Loki. He hair was shoulder length and still greasy as ever. He somehow looked more like a weasel than the last time he saw him.
The red head woman smiled at him. “ We might as well introduce ourselves as I feel you will be here for the foreseeable future. I’m Natasha. The idiot is Clint” Clint made and undignified noise, “ Thats Wanda and Pietro, they are twins. And that’s Scott.”
“ I’m here Maria.” Tony saw his father sitting at a small table with an assortment of pastries and drinks presented .
“ Yeah... god... fuck yeah.” Steve murmured as he watch Tony in his shower. Steve knew it was a good idea to place those covert cameras in tony’s hotel. He kept jerking him to Tony lathering his body with soap. He watched as those hands trailed his body with a body sponge as he tilt his head backwards to the spray of water.
“ Tony...” Steve gasped. He moved up his ministrations twirling his tongue around the head of Steve’s cock. He released in his mouth not too long after that.
Apparently Pepper has done nothing but raged on when she saw what Tony was up against. He was glad he brought her along. He could always count on her.
Tony looked at him confused. He didn’t bit him did he? He didn’t hurt him right? He didn’t want his friends to get hurt.
“ I thought all people like you dress like that. You know fags.” Steve wished he hand t said it the minute it came  of his mouth.
I’m looking for a Tony x Steve fanfic. Steve gets teleported into another universe where Tony is locked up after being deemed a criminal. The other universes Steve doesn’t want to interacting with their Tony. Steve has to wait until his tony can open a portal to save him. At the end Steve’s Tony opens a portal and rescues him. The other universe Avengers are wary of him. Tony was able to open the portal by using the i dirt stones and with the help of Jane Foster. At the end the other universe Captain America makes amends with the other universes Tony and it can be alluded that they try to start a relationship.
The guy roughly grabbed his jaw to have him face him. “ What the hell was that for you bitch,” he growled.
Howard broke away from Rhodey and stomped to the broken window. “ And you better not come back tonight you bastard!” Howard yelled after the fleeing man.
“ Come on, you know I have plenty of experience. Why don’t you try to do like  do a role playing thing but with like Hydra?”
“ Please let me explain. You remind me a lot of the Tony that lived in this universe. We have a scientist, a Reid Richards, you may or may not know him but he is big into the multi-verse as he calls it. He believed that there were multiple universes where there different variations of ourselves, some with small differences  and others with other major differences,  where he lead different lives based on the different choices we made. I think you are from one such universe where you are similar to our universe’s Tony but have obviously led a harder life. You are much smaller and skinner for one. You also seemed a lot sadder. Steve got worried about you and sneaked into your room last night, he said he heard you crying and that was when he called me. I thought he finally lost it, telling me there was a Tony in the penthouse crying because he is scared and sad he left his home. I thought he was nuts. He’s had a rough couple of months. He loved our Tony and he seems to live you as well. Wether it is because you remind him of someone else or if he truly loves you for you I don’t know, but either way he seems totally invested in you and wants to know more about you.  He would not have called if he did not care. All these people here would not have tried to make you comfortable if they didn’t care. If they wanted to use you they would have done so by now. They would have thrown you in the lab and made you work. Sam wouldn’t be trying to crack jokes and Nat wouldn’t be getting to defend you. I know that for a fact.
“ No he didn’t.” He really hadn’, he basically just took him back to his room and dressed him in a nice outfit and groomed him until he deems him acceptable.
Tony stands up. “ Do you mind telling me what the fuck is going on? Why you two are so chummy all of the sudden and why are you two being such fucking jerks?”
“ We should get Strange involved.” Bruce and Thor were also invited to the meeting that they were having back at Tony’s tower. “ this is his specialty. Magical creatures and the such.”
“Tony, I think it’ll be a good idea if you, Clint and I  discussed some things regarding our resident merman.”
“ How about We see each other after school today? I know it’s last minute, but I would like to get to know you better. I really like you Pete and I want to spend time with you.” He gently grabbed on to Peters hand.
“ You never mentioned this when you said you needed help.” Pepper snapped at Fury.”. You could have gotten Tony killed! “
Peter smiled as they kept walking to class. It was nice to have someone other than his family to place so much confidence in him.
Tony nipped at his lips and moaned as he opened his mouth and battled his tongue with his own. Tony pushed him back softly when he realized something.
Peter laughed. “ Be Careful or you are going to have to explain to our parents why you caught chlamydia. “
“ Jesus Christ, what were you thinking? Did you think he was going to react well to what you had said?”
Tony sighed angrily. “ I don’t have time for your musings right now Clint. As you can see I’m the primary entertainment for two super soldiers.”
Grant smirked. He turned to Tony and did something extremely shocking. He bowed and picked up his hand to bring it to his lips for a light kiss. “ Commander Hydra at you service.”
“ Well... its just that we wanted to I guess role play, but it made the both of us uncomfortable.” Steve mumbled.
“ Your friends are going at the end of the week, Bucky said it’s good for you to have people you know nearby, especially since you are older. He said that older humans have trouble acclimating. I never knew that.”
“ I-I mean I didn’t do anything with them. Sex stuff.. you know.  I-I-I want you to know that.” Steve stuttered out.
Steve sighed. “ I know that... it’s just that.... I’m was the leader and I was the strategist and I didn’t....”
Peter groaned, “ How many times I have to tell you? I wasn’t raped. We were role playing. We are in a relationship.”
Steve sighed. “ If you get back your suit. You will leave. I mean. That was the only thing keeping you here right? And I’m pretty sure it won’t take you long to figure out how to use it to get you back home if it got you here in the first place. I was enjoying spending time with you and I didn’t want to stop hanging out with you.” Steve elaborated.
Rhodey had flabbergasted when he saw the disaster zone and then he broke out laughing when he saw the table set with a bouquet of roses in the middle with a single candle.
“ Anyway, how did you get here. We didn’t really discuss that.” Tony said before Steve could retort.
He had been promised someone that looked like him.   He should have also added the stipulation that they would get their fucking mouth shut; he was not in the mood to hear any bitching.
Steve just rolled his eyes and took his place next to Schmidt as the PowerPoint on the board lit up.
Harry gave a nonchalant wave of his hand. “That’s fine. I completely understand.  He’s just looking out for your best interest. But i didn’t know you were Tony Stark’s son.”
Steve glared. “ Get the fuck up and get out.. I have company.” The man and woman shot up, scared, and grabbed their clothes as they made a bee line for the elevator.
So his attempts at courtship were probably less than stellar. He didn’t know Tony was a good fighter and how the hell he was supposed to know that it was poison ivy he grabbed. He didn’t get a reaction why would Tony get one? It just didn’t make any sense. And then there was Howard, he was the absolute worse. The man hated Steve with a passion and did nothing to hide his feelings. It was so ridiculous to think that he thinks Steve would somehow corrupt Tony. The man was bragging yesterday with Greg how he had people taken shots off of him in college. The worse Steve could do was give him a coupon collecting habit.  And why the hell did Howard think Rhodey was a better choice than him? Rhodey was decent looking but he looked nothing like Steve. And the man was not a national icon. Rhodey took orders and Steve gave them. He was a natural born leader, the apex Solider of the army. How was he a bad choice. He looked up from his book and saw Tony reading on the couch next to him off his Starkpad. He said he had wanted to review some company material for his dad. Everyone and their grandmother knew that there was a Tony from another universe living at the Tower.
Tony left out a breath he didn’t know he had been holding, “ Thank fuck. That feels a lot better. Ommpf!”
Tony turned to Peter, “ I’ll be picking you up today ok? Happy had some errands to run and won’t be able to.”
Steve seemed to panic. “ Well you see... um... Ultron was Tony’s... this universes Tony....pet project. He was designed to help us and is very good. You can test him yourself and do whatever diagnostic you need to Tony. Just please calm down. You’re scaring me. I don’t want you to hurt yourself.”
“ Maybe i should skip it so I can have an extended vacation- ow! Really Nat?” Bucky Yelped as he rubbed his shin.
“ Rhodey, I’m telling you I have not been drinking!” Tony snapped, he was exasperated that his bull headed friend wasn’t getting the message. He had been talking on the phone with him for the past fifteen minutes and this conversation wasn’t really going anywhere.
Just a short chapter. I’ll be bust coming next month and I don’t know when I’ll be able to write again. I hope everyone enjoys this new chapter.
Grant smiled and turned his attention toward Tony. Tony noticed that Grant had really beautiful eyes. And a nice smile. A very nice smile. Like he could be the cover-boy for Crest or Colgate.
Tony felt his mouth dried as he saw the familiar face of the butler he adored place ornate plates on the table.
“ And I’m telling you that you need someone. You are stressed. Even if it’s just for the night. Pick someone and I will leave you alone. Having a good romp can do wonders for the soul my friend.”
Tony gave him a questioning look.    They were finally back in Tony’s room  where the could have some more fun and this is when they decided to have a meltdown. Like really? Is this what they were going to have a panic attack about? After all the shit they have been through in their lives they chose this?
“.... just let me grab something and I’ll- What the fuck!” Tony and Steve turned to the front door and saw Rhodey with...
The siren bent his head and began to lick the wounds. He gave several laps before pulling back. Tony watch in utter fascination as the skin closed and it’s normal color returned, leaving now markings behind.
“Tony, you have a meeting back at the tower in 45 minutes, would you like to leave now?” Pepper asked.
They all laughed at that when the door opened and a servant  dressed in blue walked in. He gave them a short bow and said that their graces are requesting their presence for lunch.
Tony was going to respond back when he heard yelling. They both turned to the entrance of the gym to see Bucky and Natasha trying to restrain an old man wildly waving a cane as Steve tried to duck behind Clint.
“ So This is where you are,” a female voice said. The lights flicked on and Tony saw a beautiful red head standing at the doorway.
Tony gave him an assessing look, “ You sure? You don’t like have the need to like rule the world or anything?”
Nat has called Tony and told him to meet her back at SHIELD with Winghead. He had never been so ecstatic in his life to be going to SHIELD. It was finally a chance to get rid of Winghead. If not that he doesn’t like him, it’s just that he’s tired of finding Goldfish in his bed and someone constantly hogging up his tub and whining loudly until Tony fills it up with water. And there is also the part where he can’t really leave the penthouse as Winghead tried to follow after him. So yes he was very excited to go back to SHIELD and drop off Winghead at the same time.
Tony smiled. “ I know. He just needs some boundaries. He is very intelligent and can follow instructions. I just feel like this whole situation has been overwhelming for him. Especially the part with almost being caught by Hydra and now he is just expected to trust us. I just feel bad for him.”
“ Do you still blame me for her finding out about her family? You told me to give her a phone which I was opposed to by the way. Did you really think she wouldn’t use it to check up on her family?”
Tony nodded. He hadn’t had any alcohol in two years, but he wasn’t going to say no to a good bottle of scotch. He sat next to him and dropped two glasses on the coffee table in front of them before pouring  some of the liquid in the glasses. He put down the bottle and offered Tony a glass before taking his own and throwing it back in one go. Tony held the glass in his hands nervously.
“ Are you sure this is alright? I mean I don’t want to hurt you.” Steve asked, voice laced with concern.
“ Having friends I think will reduce the stress of you trying to get use to this place, what do you think?”
Peter ran out of there. He hated Wade. He hated his life. He hated that he was too naive to see his coming.
“ You are lucky boy that I believe that a grown man should not get spanked or I would beat your ass black and blue for the stunt you pulled today. You could have gotten hurt. And on top of that you but a kid through a wall!”
“ Guess I’ll take this stuff to her.” Greg said as he picked up the bags and headed toward the kitchen.
Steve ignored him. But Clint was right, he might have overdone it a bit on the cologne. But Tony didn’t comment on it as Steve placed the coffee in front of him and opened the doughnut box in front of him, revealing a variety of different doughnuts including the ones with the creme in the middle. Tony raised an eyebrow at Bucky who just shrugged.
Tony woke up the next morning to someone screaming. He woke up startled, and screamed as well when he saw a pair of bright blue eyes looking at him.
“ I’m glad to see that my lab is still intact. I didn’t know what to expect if I left you two alone.”
Peter gasped and grabbed onto Wade tighter. Next he felt himself falling with Wade on top of him.  Wade kissed and sucked along his neck and bit his ear when he reached it. Peter gave a soft whine. Wade licked the abused skin once before kissing it.
“ Nonsense! You are a smart and capable man with goals in life. You have to be the youngest Colonel in the air force right now. You perfectly offset Tony’s impulsiveness and I trust you to take care of him in an even that Maria and I cannot.”
But was disarmed. Bucky went to defend himself and then Nat threw a small EMP at War Machine. Steve watched helplessly as Iron Man moved out of his reach and jumped in front of the projectile. He screamed and then fell on his side with a thud.
Tony smiled. Steve seemed sweet when he wanted to be. Tony grabbed his hand and led him to the  couch. Steve sat down willingly, eyes never leaving Tony.
Don’t you think I know that?!  Everyone here is just like how I wish they were in my life. But I have a daughter. I have a family back home.” Tony snapped angrily.
Harry: there’s a gala next month according to my dad. Are you going? I think your dad is going or at least SI is. Want to hang out if you’re there? It’s so boring at these places. It would be nice to finally be able to hang out with some good company.
“ Yeah.  Some of those teachers are definitely strict. I never met a calculus teacher that  Easy or nice.”
“ Is he really though? I mean he does think you are as he calls an underachieving nobody.” Clint called out.
Tony grabbed Steve and pushed him into a closet. He had seen the super soldier earlier this morning but did not want to make a scene especially after his father took at his hunting rifle when he saw steve exit the SUV from inside the house and marched onto the porch.  He sent out a couple rounds before yelling a litany of curses and threatening to kill and maim Steve if he got close to his son. Thor had exited out of the car and had to fight Howard for the gun. For being human, the old man put up quite a fight.
“ Have you ever had a man’s cock in you before? A boy as pretty as you must be chased by all the guys. I wonder how tight that little spider ass must be.”
“ Is this really ok? I mean I don’t want Tony it feel left out,” Steve asked Sam as he helped carry the beer and the finger foods to the common area.
So when he got back home form work he was pissed off from the fact that he found out I had a tubal ligation done and then this whole anal sex thing. Se we started to argue. I called him a monster and told him I wish Reilly was still alive so that I could have married him. He just lost it. He punched me and grabbed me by my arm until it broke. He then raped me vaginally and anally. He tore me pretty bad down there. I don’t remember much and I’m thankful for that small mercy but I know at some point he was strangling me and Steve came in and pulled him off and called EMS to take me to the Hospital.
“ Yeah... I did both actually.” Sam drawled our slowly, looking a bit uncomfortable with Bruce’s behavior.
Peter rolled his eyes and looked up at him. “ Occasional villain. You mostly hep me now. You only steal when you need to pay your moms medical bills.”
Tony gave her a flirtatious smile. “ Well I’m going to tell you a little secret,” he whispered, “ Maybe I am.”
Bucky whined again and gave him a wolffish smile.  His wagged his tail and pawed the ground again. He shrunk in on himself as if to make himself non-threatening and small, but that was not going to fool Tony this creature in front of him killed his own mate. He was dangerous. Tony could only hope he would kill him too so that he could be with Steve and spare the rest of the Avengers.
The elevator doors opened and Tony stepped into the penthouse. It was great to see Rhodey again, but he needed some rest especially after being emotionally drained from the therapy session. He continued to make his way to his bedroom until he saw both Steve and Grant sitting in the common area. They both jumped up when they saw Tony.
“ Saving your ass. Do you really thing we would let you be by yourself when you are going to fool around with your boyfriend? Just because you make him a homemade Italian dinner it doesn’t mean his best friend isn’t going to kick your ass for banging his friend.” Rescue said
“ It’ll be the same as last time Stark. I will place an enchantment on us and we will go in. And remember to stay behind me. As much as I can stand you, I don’t need you getting yourself killed.” With that he did a series of hand motions and directed his spell toward Tony. When he seems satisfied he turned and the doors opened. They walked in cautiously.
He was not that fucking old! Jesus freaking Christ he was still in his 30’s! This whole week had been “ Bucky said to do this since you are older...”  or “ Bucky suggested this besucase of your age...”
“ Let me go you bastard. I can’t believe I thought about trusting a manipulative fucking piece of shot like you!” Tony seethed.
Tony noticed the table set up in the dining area. It was covered with a red table cloth and the food was neatly placed on top. The lights overhead were also dimmed so that the twin candles on the table were able to shine brightly.
He waltzed into the room and headed straight to the bathroom. He had been looking forward to trying that jacuzzi bath tub. He undid the sash to his robe and let it fall. He turned on the water and the thrusters and jumped in when it was a decent height. He floated for around for a bit, letting the little jets push him this way and that way in the water. Tony held his breath and flipped over for a quick dive.
“ Can you imagine? Me in that maid outfit you love me to wear so much. The skirt up all the way so you can see those black panties you think I look so hot in.”
“ Can you tell us your name? And maybe a little about yourself?” Bruce asked. As he released the button he turned to Thor who was sitting down always. “ Thor press that blue button right there. It will monitor his vitals to show if he’s lying.”
He threaded his fingers through the blonde locks and forced his head forward and kissed him. He attacked his mouth and used his other hand to brace himself on his shoulders. He licked his bottom lip, earning a surprised gasp and thrusted his tongue inside. He mapped out the inside and encouraged Steves own velvety appendage to play. He grabbed Steve’s hands that he saw failing in his periphery, as if he was unsure what to do with them, on his ass and encouraged him to squeeze it.
Peter sighed, “ Terrible. They somehow found me and literally crashed into Wade’s living room. I am grounded indefinitely.”
At that a tall alpha male with auburn hair strolled in with a grouchy look on his face. He had Bucky’s blue eyes and it was already apparent he was going to inherit Steve’s larger build.
“ Shit. We were hoping that they would never find them. I’m sorry Buck.” Howard leaned forward to scratch under Bucky’s Chin. He went limp under the touch and purred loudly.
“ I just want to say I know you don’t trust us.” Tony was about to speak but stopped when Rhodey raised his hand.
Not fucking now. Peter put on his best fake smile as he turned around. He had avoided Harry for most of the day. It had been made easier as he had been absent for a good part of it until apparently their last class.
“ Hmm... glad you approve, but I don’t mind giving a repeat performance.” He said sultry and he kissed Tony’s neck.
The middle of the room was what held his attention though. It seemed to be a large pit filled with blankets, pillows and furs. He guessed it was the bed. He sighed. He really wanted a mattress.
“ What now that Nat undoubtedly heard us fucking with him up my ass, you start having second thoughts. You know what? Fuck you.” Tony felt the tears started to stream down his face. Of course Steve wouldn’t want to be with him or his alternate universe counterpart. Because he was a fuck up always had been.
Steve kissed his  neck, working up to his check before kissing him I. The lips again. Tony heard the cap from the lube open and its wasn’t long before he felt Steve fingers grazing his opening. Tony gave a stuttered sigh from the touch and arched his back.
“ I am qualified to care for you. Even though I can no longer do surgeries I am still a well respected doctor.”
He was supposed to get in with their regular physician last week but he had to go out of town and has not been back since, so Bucky pretend-MD from bullshit medical school was the one giving such great advice, the bastard.
Peter sighed as he finally got a text from Ned. He had tried to look for him after first period, but apparently he was sick and was at home. There were also no new texts from Wade. He knew he was on a mission, but he still felt a bit lonely when he didn’t text him.
