A soft touch brushed against his shoulder and Tony lurched to his feet, swinging an arm wildly behind himself to ward off whatever was there. Backing away to the other side of the room, he shoved his hand into his pocket for his phone as he glared at the doorway.
Steve grimaces. “Fair.”
the rub of fine wool against his cheeks, beneath his lips. The scratch of satin under the scrape of his nails.
JARVIS said immediately. “
Bucky considered for a moment, then leans over to poke Steve in the stomach. Steve lets out an undignified yelp at the cold finger and rolls into a more upright position. Better.
Peggy’s figure morphs to that of Tony’s, dirty in his slacks and sleeveless workshop shirt.
Tony's panting turned into broken gasps and Steve knew he was almost there. He withdrew his hand from where he was feeling Tony's thudding heart and started to fondle Tony's balls. The raw shout of pleasure that reached his ears was sweeter than any honey.
He was in his bedroom at the Tower. Outside the windows, the city twinkled with the light of a quiet night. Beyond the city, the sky was fractured and broken as if inconsequential. There was a shuffling from his bed and he turned in time to see a pale muscular arm emerge from the large shape under the sheets and wrap itself around the smaller body in front of it.
“That doesn’t prove anything,” Tony pressed on. “She could've known we were together. We haven't exactly been coy about holding hands. Laser-targeted Cupid bullet. It's the twenty-first century. It’s a thing.” Look at him, arguing logic into what was increasingly likely to be hand-wavey magic.
Steve only laughed, clearly having felt Tony’s response at those words. “Right. Not your style. How could I forget.”
“Because it was my decision too!”
This was not a productive line of thought. Had anything like this even happened before between a ghost and a man? Maybe he could ask Natasha to dig the archives—
T'Challa grinned. "Wakanda can be generous, and we have resources aplenty. I won't ask you again to sign the Accords but I do implore you to not destroy more airports and cities - you will have no ally in me if anything of the sort happens. Otherwise, well met, Steve."
was standing there with his hand still outstretched. He was outlined by the doorway, with the light from the corridor glowing around him in a parody of Tony’s final moments with Steve. Tony tensed his hand on his phone but didn’t initiate the emergency protocols. He straightened and brushed his other hand down his jacket, not to smooth out the nonexistent creases, but for an excuse to look away from the man standing before him.
Somewhere, a deity was probably laughing at him and counting their unexpectedly doubled dues. It took two to fight a war. And the same two to end the war. It took one stupid wish and the payment of the one last thing he didn’t know he still had. Something he never would have given.
Tony fidgets in his seat and drums his fingers on the table but Jim waits it out. Tony does things at his own pace; Jim’s learned it the hard way.
“Raff, Tony?” the blond man said with an arched eyebrow. “Harsh thing to say about a good friend.”
Steve grins at him, hands shifting back and lower on Tony’s hips and Tony bites back a moan. Steve’s grin grows wider. “This is so much better than phone sex.”
Tony would never hesitate for this. “Yes.”
Tony sat in silence for a full minute, hand still rubbing absently along the surface of the arc reactor. The only light from the room was from the small lamp by Tony’s bed on the other side of the room, and Tony’s massaging movement was flashing the blue light of the reactor on and off like a beacon.
“Jesus Christ!” Tony shouted, and scrambled away from the voice, landing with a thud on the other side of the bed. As he tried to untangle himself from the sheets, he called for JARVIS and the suit.
“How’d this happen?” Tony said shakily, lips brushing at the skin beneath them. He felt hands rest on his back and waist. They were so warm. “How are you alive?”
Steve can’t see Tony’s expression but he sees Tony reach out slowly and take the pen and paper, writing a long message and signing it with care before handing it back.
hadn't made contact again since he’d left so abruptly the night before.
“It was still nice,” Steve continued. Subjectively nice, of course. Objectively, it had been terrible.
Tony almost bit his tongue, caught between laughing and matching the retort, and he dropped a few feet through the air.
The two PLASM agents turned back to Tony.
“On the roof of your tower in this weather? You’ll catch a cold. How about you just catch a movie with me. JARVIS has being queueing up some nice Bollywood films.”
When he was satisfied, Stark rearranged himself, legs bent at the knee, looking more like a carefree man sunning himself. He wriggled his hips then raised an eyebrow at Steve and twisted his remaining bound wrist in askance.
Steve looked down at his phone, dejected. It was just going to be him and his best friend, the internet, today.
It was Tony’s turn to laugh, eyes sparkling with mirth. Steve had known he would like the expression in those eyes of Tony’s.
Tony groaned long and loud, theatrical for his own sake, and tried and failed to not think about the softness of Steve’s skin as he reached between his legs again. This was torture.
“I’m gonna call it quits fer tonight, Buck,” Steve said, slapping his mug into Bucky’s free hand. He pressed through the crowd before Bucky could say another word and made a line towards Tony and the girl, Susan?, both already halfway up the stairs.
Tony tugged and Steve followed. They walked down the street, hand in hand, and no one was fazed by the sight.
He stepped through the bedroom door and sat on the ground with his back to the door. He heard the bathroom door open again and tried to not focus on the sounds of Tony getting dressed.
Rhodey chuckle comes through the comm, still on private. “They’ll come through. He listens to you more than most of us.”
“Well,” Bruce says, indicating his little basket, “I’m going to find everyone else. These cookies are from Laura. I’ll put them out for everyone.”
After another heated hour, Starnes left in high dudgeon and with a promise of a new shed and monetary compensation, and Murdock shook Steve’s hand, then Tony’s, and left at a more leisurely pace.
Tony only giggled harder. He was aware that he was probably freaking Steve out, so he shook his head and drew away, turning to rest his hands on the conference table, letting the hysteria subside into gurgling chokes as he tried to control his breathing. Steve stood behind him, a hand rubbing gently on Tony’s back as Tony tried to regain his sanity. Tony thrilled at the casual touch. It was something Steve would do. And now he could. He really could.
And Tony wanted to believe. He needed to believe. He launched himself forward, trusting that Steve would catch him - and he buried his face into Steve’s neck when warm arms wrapped around him, caught him.
“Tiberius Stone, CEO of Viastone – yeah the media and tech conglomerate,” Stark said woodenly. “I should rub it in his face that you know mine and not his but then he wasn’t the rich American CEO who was held in a dingy Afghan cave for three months.” Stark turned back to face Steve, fingers tapping against his own biceps, mouth thin. “Us rich kids know each other. We used to, hm, date is a strong word but we had a thing. Fell out. I hate him. He wants to hate me. We dig at each other when we see each other. It’s all good fun. You’re not going to go to the nearest journalist with
Bucky shrugs. “Doesn’t stop you from just asking over your little video calls. And emails. And instant messages. And—“
“Banner’s coming back in a few weeks,” Steve says.
“And you’ll give Tony back immediately?” Steve asked without hesitation. “Bring him to life again? Leave him? Stop draining his life?”
It was all this, and all in the way they came together again and again, in the dance of lips and tongue, the play of hands on skin and hair, so familiar yet novel. It reflected a lifetime and it spelled a future.
“—and I don’t remember any of this.”
He should have known better.
“Will you let me in? Put us both out of our misery? I want you. I’ve always wanted you, all of you, and I always will. I'll always be here for you.”
Bruce laughs along with him. “You would be right. Will you help?”
Steve clenched his teeth harder and reached towards the drone. It flitted about then positioned itself under Steve’s fingers for the sensors to read him. It beeped once, a green light flashed, and it sprung open.
“Oh, I’d pay to see that threesome in action,” Natasha says. All four of them choke on their drinks. Well done, Romanoff.
Steve turned back to the counter, keeping his head down, and started putting the fruits into the fruit bowl at the corner of the counter. Oranges. Apples. Bananas. The grapes should go in the fridge-
“Did you want to pick up my resignation in person?” Tony’s modulated voice came through the darkness.
“Am too.”
What had Thor said?
“Everyone off the ground,” Steve confirmed. “Release the Slime.”
Natasha huffs in amusement. “Sure you don’t want to come up?” she asks, indicating behind her. “You have half a minute before the fliers descend on you and then you won’t be leaving until after three meals and a party and an after party and an after party party.”
It was only after the fiasco with the Hood and the Infinity Gauntlet that Steve realized he couldn’t take it anymore. He’d raged and yelled at Tony. He’d thrown down ultimatums. He couldn’t understand how Tony could keep something like the
Steve stood silent as he let Tony absorb his words. Maybe he should have been clearer. Maybe he should have been more forward. But what he’d said was the truth and he wouldn’t withhold it anymore. Not when it might’ve avoided an entire war. Even so, he couldn’t help but tense when Tony lifted his head from his hands and the face plate came up to reveal a face of utter disbelief.
“Think about your next answer,” Steve said. He sat back into the chair and crossed one leg over the other, hands clasped, waiting.
“You’re not funny.”
"You'll break your phone if you hold it any tighter," T'Challa said, nodding at Steve's right hand.
As he closed the distance, he saw the exact moment Stark's body relaxed; Steve's silhouette must've been distinctive enough to recognize. He removed his hat and gave it a wave with a shout. As he jogged closer and closer still, he let himself take amusement from the way Stark was trying to lay himself out casually, like the man was trying to convince Steve he was out here tied to the rails like just another noon. Making his way to stand over Stark, Steve had to admit it looked almost convincing.
He twisted around and tried to find anything in the darkness that wasn’t more darkness. Wasn’t he in the Conference Room on the helicarrier? What had happened? Where was everyone?
Jim sighs. “And not one of us wants you to go through your troubles alone. You’ve got all of us now. And you could have Steve.” Jim pauses, eyeing up Tony’s reaction. He’s just digging his heels in, Jim decides and continues. “And you know, you could be kissing Steve—“
“You would have been back to your buff self in no time. Punching out grocery store robbers with ease. Wouldn’t that have been better?”
"Justice will," T'Challa answered evenly. He lowered himself to the ground beside Stark and placed his helmet between them, facing them. Two armored men; two prematurely ascended heirs to vast empires; two people who could have fallen into a downward spiral of revenge because of their vices. In another lifetime, they could have been friends. Perhaps they still could.
They’d just worked out this thing between them and then this had happened. Oh, God. He’d lost Steve. He’d had Steve.
The mottled bruises on Stark’s face and neck were expertly covered with makeup and the worst of the swelling hidden just behind the convenient fall of his hair. He held himself with the poise of a man used to concealing the sting and burn of breathing and moving with broken ribs and a body half covered in stitches. The only outward indication that Tony Stark had been physically affected by this little War at all was the fully casted arm straining the sleeves of the immaculately pressed jacket, the glove covering the hand, and a small hitch in his step.
He spun Tony around again and with a hand looped around the end of Tony's tie, he dragged Tony down until he was bent low, legs straight, hands braced on the pole, ass in the air, exposed. The game transformed. Tony was now egging Steve on, an endless stream of filth pouring from his mouth as he shivered from head to toe, the tension and heat rolling off of him with every broken plea that punctuated the filth.
Tony scoffed. “My tech doesn’t get slimed.”
Steve opened his eyes and turned to the voice. Tony was seated on the armchair like it was a throne. Legs crossed and hands draped over the armrest. He smiled when he saw Steve lift his head.
All the men and women counting on him for their lives - he’s too late to save them all.
The bombers are going to unleash their payload on the entire eastern sea board. Steve is going to fail. Steve is going to die for nothing.
He closed his eyes. “Continue Phase Two tomorrow, J,” he said in lieu of wallowing in Steve’s non-response. He was achingly hard again, his body having apparently recovered during the down time. Wallowing or no, thinking about Steve was enough to get his heart pumping hard again, not to mention the steadily more insistent fantasies of Steve clothed, Steve unclothed—
“Cutting it close, but yeah I’m good.”
And even with Pepper as his CEO, even with a team of Avengers to pick up the supervillain slack, Tony's schedule was still tight. For shorter trips, Tony liked to fold himself into an Iron Man suit and fly himself there to save time. He would show up to inspections or meetings in slightly wrinkled suits, and Steve would more often than not hear more about it from Pepper than from Tony. Steve only knew about how the wrinkled suits looked on the floor of their bedroom -- or Tony's workshop, or the kitchen -- afterwards.
Tony walked right past Maria after his thorough report, tugging a very pliant Steve along into the elevator. He couldn’t help but feel an irrational surge of pride and smugness when Steve didn’t even give Maria a single look.
“Tony,” Steve cut in, voice a rasp. He pulled off his blue helmet in one fluid movement and tore open the front of his own star spangled uniform revealing a sweat soaked chest to Tony. “Bed. Now.” He licked his lips, his darkened eyes boring into Tony's. Tony’s mouth went dry.
“Come on,” Steve said, ignoring that remark and holding out his arm, “Back home with you.”
him anything? He was
Tony flinched back from him at that and Steve felt a moment of both triumph and regret at the look of hurt on his face. The mask of indifference was back on in the next instant and Tony stepped away.
“I want you to know I'm not going to leave you after we have sex. That was never an option. I'm not with you now just to get sex. But I've also wanted you for a long time, and I'm going to keep wanting you. That’s not something I can deny."
As the boys wipe their mouths, she takes out her cell phone from her hidden pocket and places it on a dry spot on the table between them.
His muscles are tearing as he pulls and shakes against the solid grip of the cold but he can’t move. The ice in contact with him melts at his exertion but he still can’t get enough leverage to break through.
“—oh God you’re talking about proposals now—“
Tony closed his eyes against the peaceful sight before him. He didn’t know what the after-life was, but this couldn’t be it. He opened his eyes again and reached forward to wake Steve.
“You fell on me like a log and then ran off—“
“I was waiting for the right time,” he said. Right, and that wasn’t how he should have said it.
Steve definitely couldn’t take it anymore. He stood and spun Tony back around to face the desk, and he ground into Tony’s ass, letting Tony feel the sharp line of his zipper over his hard cock, his belt, the rough fabric of his pants. Tony moaned and pressed back. Steve reached down to hold his hips in place, then undid his own pants just enough to free his straining cock. He pressed his hips back to Tony’s, letting his cock settle between the cheeks of Tony’s ass, and rubbed himself into the wetness of the lubricant.
That’s—that’s Tony with his legs around Steve, pressed up against the doors to the Media Room. And. Oh Lord. That’s Steve moaning into their kiss. And—
Even as Stark had just displayed half those supposedly “unpleasant” traits, Steve had held back his instinctive gossip rag thoughts and summoned up the patience Iron Man liked to jokingly wax about.
Looked like Plan A didn’t work. Tony tapped his knuckles on the shield’s surface then reached up to remove the Tesseract from the seal of the Containment Unit. “Knock, knock. Time to feast.”
“Pretty sure,” Sam says. “Steve admitted as much to me.”
He continued his pace, now sucking hard with every stroke. Tony was quivering in his hold, letting out an endless stream of breathless moans. Steve pulled back one last time then took a deep breath and let Tony sink deep into this throat again. He pressed his tongue along the underside, rubbing the vein roughly, and he swallowed hard while teasing on the skin behind Tony's balls at the same time.
Peace in sight, T'Challa let himself smile. "I can grant you amnesty in Wakanda. And," he nodded at the Soldier, "Wakanda leads the world in the medical sciences. We can provide care both physical, and psychological."
After his nightmare of the fight with the Skull and the Cube, Steve had gone to Director Fury with a request for information regarding the Cube. The dream had been the first time Steve realized that although the Skull had been taken from the Earth, the Cube, something of such immense power, had remained. Tony hadn’t known anything about it, and neither had Clint, Bruce or Natasha, and Thor had still been away for the holidays. So he’d gone to Director Fury, who had known something but he hadn’t shared it with Steve. Steve had then asked after the Valkyrie, the bombs, his shield, his body, and Fury honestly hadn’t known anything about any of it.
) gave Tony a small, formal smile, “I had business with Colonel Fury and…” he trailed off.
“What are you planning to do once you have him?”
Tony’s ears were ringing louder and louder and his eyes were refusing to unblur, but he felt a strong beat of his heart in his numbed chest. “Will you stay with me?”
He was trying to figure out what he could do for another year of this non-life when the bathroom door finally opened to admit Tony into the bedroom.
T'Challa laughed aloud at that. There was a history between these men, alright. Steve never lost his ability for proper speech until it came to Stark these days. "If you wish to speak with him, phones work both ways."
Tony finally disentangled himself and staggered away. He found himself in a corner, cursed his sleep-addled brain, and tried to blink the grogginess from his eyes to focus ahead of himself.
“I know you miss physical contact the most,” Tony says by Steve’s ear, his breath brushing warm against the short hairs there. “You better appreciate this because I’m not usually a hugging sort of guy.”
Steve pulls back and swipes a hand over his face, rubbing away the wetness. “Sorry.”
Tony tilts his head like Peggy had, expression unnatural in its childish inquiry, eyes flashing an unnatural green. “If you let me have you, I will let you out to save them. You can die for something good. Something great. Let me have you?”
Natasha smirks and waits.
It was fitting, in the very end. He wouldn’t have wanted to live in this world without Tony anyway.
he tried to say, but his throat was closed tight and his chest was throbbing with every breath he couldn’t take.
. Really, this was the worst time to be thinking about this. This was the wrong time to pull up his memories of Steve gently kissing him in bed and turn them into a fantasy of Steve rolling on top of him to deepen the kiss, a fantasy of Steve kissing down his chest, lower and lower until—
"I'm very sorry about your father," the Soldier said, voice ringing clear despite the pain and exhaustion evident on his face. "If I had known—"
Bruce brought the Quinjet to a hover above the Library and the Colonel turned its massive head toward the noise of the engines. An angry frown formed on its burnt and pitted face and it took one step forward with a hand reaching for the jet.
Looking at the sharply dressed man he’d steadied, he realized with a pang that he recognized the tousled head of dark hair and goateed face with the handsome cheekbones. Steve had never met him in person, but there was a thick file on Tony Stark he’d gone through and he’d seen the man’s tech in action with them on the field. And there was also the internet.
“All right, FRIDAY, give us your update.”
He gritted his teeth and focused on the state of his teammates. Clint and Natasha had moved away somewhere together, their comms switched off and trackers disabled halfway towards the Quinjet. There was a burned circle of runes in the middle of the street; Thor had evidently taken off somewhere by way of Heimdall and the rainbow brick road. And Steve—
He’d been doing so well with Steve—with their little blossoming relationship. He’d been keeping his hands to himself. Keeping it above the belt.
Steve gave him a sly grin. “Cookin’ up something special again?”
As the dust settled, the entire chicken was gone, Trapped, and Tony heard Clint let out a whoop.
His need was too strong. It was everything. Every stroke of Steve’s tongue, every scrape of Steve’s teeth, and every squeeze at his hips fanned the heat brewing within him. He felt so empty. He needed to be filled. He needed to fill Steve. Anything. He gripped tighter at Steve’s hair, drawing out a low moan, and he seized the opportunity to invade Steve’s mouth and take what was always his.
me.” He flexed his wrist, his fingers plunging in and out. “I’ll be so good for you.”
Tony rolled out of the way of a giant glob of slime thrown at him and blasted forward to circle the head of the Colonel. Ectoplasm. Slime. He hated slime. Decontamination and neutralization was a horrible experience; Anti-Slime Slime smelled terrible.
“Just promise me,” Steve added quietly, after their laughter died down, “that you’ll keep yourself safe.”
“—say that he will, at the very least, consider your proposal—“
Tony almost came. “Show me your kinky side some more.”
There was a yell and a loud thud as something, someone, collided with the ground. The Fallen gave a screech of victory. Steve opened his eyes. He couldn’t see Sam anymore. He panicked.
Steve smiled. Correct. “So, agent,” he said cheerfully, “you know what I’m after. You’d do well to give it to me.”
Woah, okay! I hope that was as enjoyable as it was for me to write it! To disambiguate, I enjoyed writing it very much!
The sky continued to be blue and the drive continued to be smooth. And Stark continued to pretend that they had been anything but the best of friends and something more.
the reasonable voice I want to listen to.”
“We’re sorry, Steve,” Natasha said. She stowed her Pistols and smiled at Steve. “Everyone and everything’s been trying to kill Tony lately and we’re all a little on edge.”
This was not
Tony continued to breathe through his teeth, then glared at one of the ceiling cameras when JARVIS’s response was not forthcoming.
"Would've welcomed it," Tony mumbled.
Steve bit back his defense. For a moment, he panicked. He knew Tony didn’t have any memories of the months following Steve’s ‘death’ or of the Civil War that preceded it, but maybe there was more to it than Maria, Ms. Potts, and Rhodey had explained. Except everything they’ve said and everything Steve had needed to do to revive Tony from that brain delete pointed to Tony valuing this friendship too much to simply wipe….
Steve chuckled, letting his fingers roam in a random pattern of caresses. Tony groaned again, louder, neck baring. “We’ll try that next time,” Steve promised.
“I did not expect that,” Bruce says to Thor, calming his breathing. He reaches back to bring out his phone from his pocket. “Looks like that charity event will be just a charity event without ulterior motive.”
“Hi, Steve,” Tony says brightly.
“You’re friends with the man, if not exactly in physical contact with him“ —Steve chokes, and Sam files the response away for further digging— “but you guys click so well in the field, even when he’s never been part of any of our training sessions. Don’t you think that shows something? Other than the hours you both probably logged on the phone.”
He was holding a piece of Steve’s soul. Tony closed his eyes at the surge of emotion. He needed to bring Steve back.
“I was hoping the same,” Tony said at last.
“I can’t believe you got off on being barged in on by our friends,” Steve says, still chuckling weakly.
Tony stepped up to the single metallic door of the Containment Unit. The Soul Stone’s brother, the Tesseract, the cube Steve had talked about, the
“Sheriff the Steve!” Tony roared, raising his arms and leaning sideways onto the banister without his usual grace. “My favorite law man, how are you enjoyin’ yourself this fineee night?” He guffawed at his own joke then took one unsteady step down towards Steve.
Steve is standing in Tony’s workshop. The light is dim and he can’t see beyond five feet around him. He turns and tries to find Tony, or anyone else, and he is met with emptiness. As he weaves around the benches to where he knows the door should be, the details around him change, some features sharpening and some blurring into the haze beyond. The surroundings distort and shuffle again, and suddenly Steve is staring down at Tony working on something at his old holostation.
“You know what I mean,” Bucky mumbles, bringing his own glass to his lips.
The agent looked up, eyes widening as he caught sight of Steve just within the fringes of the yellow light. Steve knew him, had once trained with him in his previous life. He didn’t deserve a name from Steve anymore.
“You do what you have to,” Steve said flatly. “Leave me out of it.” He stared into the distance, unwilling to see Tony’s face again. Best to start this new life without more memories.
“Okay,” Jim says and gestures to the table, “dark corner, beer. Talk.”
“Okay, okay, I get it,” Steve says and then sinks further into the chair, hair mussing up in the back, shirt riding up. Bucky would have poked him in the stomach once upon a time. Sarah Rogers would never have wanted her boy sitting with bad posture.
They are standing in front of a mirror. Tony is leaning on the counter, staring into the mirror at the arc reactor that had been bared. There are sickly looking veins flared from the rim of the reactor, from where it’s implanted into Tony’s chest. Bloody scratches mar his chest, disappearing into his shirt, peeking out at the wrists. Steve takes in the details, horrified, and looks up to Tony’s face.
And back in Tony’s small room, Steve gently lowered Tony into the large bed in the loft and just sat, watching Tony breathe. Tony’s breath was steady and deep. He had a healthy set of lungs. Mostly used to needle Steve with inappropriate serenades, but Steve didn’t mind. He yelled at Tony about it but he’d never tell him to stop. Tony had a nice voice when he wasn’t being obnoxious and Steve missed the old songs from his youth.
Tony thought his heart might have stopped. He knew which one
“How’re your ribs?” Steve asked.
“Tony, you didn’t show at the shareholder’s meeting today,” Pepper says immediately. “I should have expected as much given the party last night, but if it wasn’t for Obadiah, it could have gone horribly. Don’t miss the Board of Directors meeting.” She doesn’t wait for Tony to reply before continuing, checking an item off the list in her arms as she speaks. “Jackson from MedTech needs his proposal either approved or rejected. You’re the one who hired him. He said he would only deal with you. And this is why we don’t let you hire people.” Another check. “Dahlia called again about the engine. She wants to know if you were serious about the collaboration. I told her you were. She said she wants to talk details with you. I scheduled a call for Tuesday.” Another check—
Tony sagged against the wall and let Steve support his entire dead weight. Steve’s chest heaved against his and he used the rhythm to regain his own breath. He knew he was in his right mind again; he was thinking straight, and his body had the familiar languid heaviness and sensitivity of his usual post-orgasm high. His dick wasn't hardening immediately. His dick was normal again.
Steve laughs and holds up a hand, pushing back the twinge of pain in his heart from the memories of Bucky. Small Tony is no less talkative than Adult Tony. “Bucky is definitely one of the bravest and most caring but I want to tell you about Iron Man.”
racing through his veins. And he hadn’t been drinking much at all ever since he and Steve had gotten togeth—
to do it, sure, but the same could be said for most of the men and women who had been part of the war effort. They weren’t shipping him off to sell war bonds and dance with USO girls anymore in this peaceful time but he might as well be if it would get him out of this bubble of isolation he’d found himself in.
“You operated within the law,” Steve said. “No one can say the same for me.”
He almost thought he could see Timely in the distance but he knew he was still at least five miles out, if he was reading the patches of drying bushes and grasses around the single rail line correctly. After another half a mile, the sun disappeared behind clouds and his horse still hadn't caught up to him.
Steve studied his eyes. They were the dark blue of the sea. Not the electric blue of madness.
He sat up and pushed Bruce away roughly. The workshop around them was empty. No one else was there apart from Bruce and the only other movement was from DUM-E and U’s frantic wheeling.
Tony narrowed his eyes. “Then if you know the time and day, you’ll also note that this is officially outside of consulting hours so I’m afraid you’ll need to get in line and make a date with Hill who will make a date with Fury who will make a date with Larry-what’s-his-name who will make a date with JARVIS who—“
Tony thought that they’d been doing fine with this relationship, ‘taking it slow’ as the saying went. There had been cold showers, many cold showers, and also many very long and warm showers alone, but he was happier in these few months than he probably had the right to be and he thought Steve was happy as well.
Not his pillow. Not his smells. Bed feels different.
“Steve, you didn’t even know what you gave power to.”
Bruce studies the burning Asgardian runes on the concrete in front of him for a moment then turns to head back into the building. He’ll start prepping for a dinner party and then think about maybe staying here for longer. With the family. He smiles and rolls up his sleeves. Family reunion it is, then.
When they finally catch Pietro, a full minute earlier than the last time Pietro was Target of the Day, Steve pats everyone on the back and walks back to Pietro to pass on pointers on how best to have defended against their aerial formations.
Steve gaped at him. “And?”
He’d had a plan, he’d had a whole scenario planned out for them to continue this little game, but he finally had Tony in his arms, after weeks of little to no physical contact, and he couldn’t help how it all went out the window at the feel of Tony’s skin and the sound of Tony’s voice.
His investigation of Certainty Three had fallen to the wayside in the face of Steve’s
Everyone was looking between him and Steve, expressions anticipatory, wary. Tony’s gaze landed on Fury, who was wearing his standard long-suffering expression which meant he was gearing up to say something Tony was not going to like.
And then the selfless martyr.
“Good authority, right, all of you just want me defenestrated,” Tony mumbles.
Steve swallowed hard. His heart was hammering in his chest and his legs were almost twitching to stand, to let him bury himself in Tony. Tony pushed his fingers into himself again, the sound wet and
He pulled back slowly, letting his tongue drag along the pulsing vein. He gave the tip a small suck and a kiss. More droplets of precum gathered at the tip, a lovely shine on the olive of Tony's skin. Steve grinned at the sight. He was getting there slowly, but surely. Even as he licked the droplets away, Tony continued to leak, and Steve lapped up every precious drop until Tony was moaning and shaking again.
“Nuh-uh, Stark. The last time there was a Containment Unit in the streets of New York, we had city-wide pandemonium when it failed and
This was the worst time to talk about this. Tony closed his eyes and kept his hands firmly planted on the knees of his crossed legs. He wondered where Steve’s hands were. “JARVIS said you had something to say? Is it about the others? What happened to the others? J, what happened to the others?”
He sits up with a flail and feels his elbow hit something and hears a soft “ow”. Turning around, he sees Steve, hair absolutely mussed, rubbing at his own cheek with eyes still squinted from sleep.
It was Steve’s shield. Steve was still a ghost, translucent, and he was holding his shield.
Tony gasped and squeezed his eyes shut. There was a warm feeling flooding his body, emanating from his chest, the arc reactor. As he stood, he felt a tightening, like a small pressure there and it raced long his veins in a wave of heat. His eyes shot open and he stared down at his chest, only to see Steve’s hand disappearing right through the chestplate, straight into Tony’s body underneath, into his arc reactor.
soul. That Steve had given to him.
They sat in companionable silence before Tony spoke again. “Answer me this. What would you do if you were solid? If, in the New Year, the Universe decided that you being ethereal was a crime to humanity and snapped its fingers and made you corporeal, visible to all?”
“Or the vibranium you made yesterday,” Natasha nudged Tony with her elbow. “Howard’s isotope?”
He let the soft memories of Steve spooned behind him during those comfortable nights float across his mind. “That was—that was—it was convenient at the start. I helped you, you helped me. Nightmares, be gone. There was kissing, wasn’t there? We got around to kissing. We still do that. Some petting. Some heavy petting. We go on dates! I endured art galleries for you! And it's not like you ever made a move to go further so it's not entirely
. If you’ll allow it.”
Tony wasn't ready for this conversation.
Despite all of that, there was one memory Steve had kept at the forefront of his mind every time the gossip rags had reported something inane about Tony Stark. Steve remembered the one time Iron Man had said anything positive about his boss; he had said that Stark was ‘trying to help and do the right thing even if no one wants to see it’. It had been a throwaway line, tossed out as the Avengers had been lamenting their terrible aquatic gear when battling a shoal of rogue squids alongside Atlanteans far off the coast of Florida.
"Farewell, then?" T'Challa said.
Steve looked up from Stark’s wide grin to see where his eyes were directed towards behind his probably very expensive sunglasses. There was another person standing a few feet in front of them: a well-dressed blond man and, a little ways behind him, two burly men dressed in black – obviously bodyguards.
“I’ll be callin’ on Murdock for this, Stark. You needa be knocked down a peg. Can’t buy your way out of everything.” And with that, Tony was left alone in Steve’s custody. At least until Starnes returned with Murdock as he so promised.
Tony didn’t feel an ounce of sympathy. Instead, he felt the heat of anger rise at his throat. He tried to grab for the puff but his hands met nothing. The puff glowed bright, green, at the half-contact and Tony clenched his fists. “Put him back,” Tony snarled. “Where is he? Put him back to how he was.”
calling this magic and brushing it off as inexplicable. I know all I want to do right now is to lick you all over, and honestly, that’s not far from the usual for me when it comes to you. All of that aside, I am patient zero. You are also patient zero, but I can’t access you because I might eliminate my status as patient zero by way of copulation. Did I say that I’m not going to call it
Something like a whine escaped from Steve’s throat and his hips shimmied against Tony’s making Tony gasp. Steve was fully hard again; Hallelujah, they were halfway there.
And every night, since that last night of the first month, Steve would verbally prod Tony to bed, and then either wander the city or watch one of the movies and TV shows now perpetually playing in the media room with another Avenger who was refusing to sleep, try to touch things, become angry that he couldn’t, and reappear by Tony’s side as soon as he felt a tug from his anchor signalling
Tony smiled at the workshop at large.
Egon Spengler? ”Doctor Spengler?”
There was a weak chuckle. Steve opened his eyes from his haze to glance down into Tony’s bright, happy eyes.
He quickened his pace, squeezing firmly with every upstroke. He let his palm roll smoothly over the warmth, trying to draw more of noises of pleasure from Tony, and smiling when it finally did.
“So were yours,” Tony countered.
Tony grinned. “Knew I kept you around for a reason. Hop to it, soldier.”
much like Howard do I?”
“There,” Tony said. “Now we’re equals. This is normal.” He squinted at Steve. “Friends do this kind of thing.”
Busted. “Yeah.”
Steve huffed in amusement. Tony Stark, never letting a moment go unsullied by his terrible humor. And Steve loved him for it even more.
Steve lowers his hands and looks over to Bucky with a squint.
“We promise not to hurt you,” Steve said, his calming 'Captain' voice in full effect. “You’re in safe hands with us. We want to help. If you come with us, we can—“
Steve turned back to him, eyes dull. “I wanted it to be.”
It was during the times when they parted ways that Steve knew there could have been something more between the two of them. They’d never addressed it, but Steve could feel it missing from his life like a lost limb. Every time he managed to get Tony back to his side – every time he fought against his own demons, fought against Tony’s demons – he felt that spark renew between them as if it had never dimmed and it burned brighter than it ever had. Steve took what he could, relishing the time he spent with Tony, savoring each and every one of Tony’s small touches and vowing to keep himself worthy of the trust given by a man who didn’t hand out trust so easily.
“It promised me to stay away from you.”
century culture and history, and doing whatever it was that Steve wanted to do. Steve was still unsure of what it was he had stayed for, which was puzzling to all the paranormal experts they’d consulted but they’d kept trying. Tony knew Steve wasn’t dealing well with being a fully ethereal ghost and he’d tried to confine his support to providing Steve with non-physical means of exposure to the world which mostly equated to entertainment media and sightseeing. From the increasing number of smiles on Steve’s face, Tony thought he was at least doing something helpful, even if it wasn’t to actively help move Steve on, and even if he fell asleep on the couch every other night, not even halfway through whatever it was they’d been watching.
Through his half-consciousness, he heard a familiar wheezing laugh, and saw the crooked smile of Ivan Vanko flash at him from beyond the darkness surrounding him.
Stroking gently at Steve’s hair, he ran the memory of their conversation from just before this session against the wall. Steve was an even bigger sap than he was, if those last words were anything to go by, and somehow it made Tony’s heart dance to know that his sentiment was returned. This was something he always could have had, whammy or no, and now he had a half-naked Steve between his thighs to think objectively about.
Those final words that never made it through the blood and the numbness—
“Banner think funny. Hulk save Banner.” Hulk shuffled around the street. “Hulk wait.”
His methods were sound - he had the evidence - and unlike his dad, he wasn’t going to lose Steve. The rest of the Avengers and PLASM were currently in the streets of New York, responding to the sudden outbreak of hauntings. Tony had convened with them at the helicarrier, collapsed, and then the sirens had become endless and they had left. Tony had stayed behind, here. He knew what he might have to do and no one was going to talk him out of this.
Steve felt a shiver run down his spine at the words. He’d started this, but he could never resist anything that came from Tony’s mouth. “What do you think, Mister Stark,” Steve said, voice steady. “And make it convincing.”
Steve closed his eyes and thought of the faces of all his friends, of all the people he knew. Fought with. Fought for. Laughed with. Loved.
Steve drains his can and reaches for another one. He cracks it open and then draws in a breath for another sigh—
“Watching love-sick young people singing and dancing around a tree. I didn’t peg you for that kind of guy, Cap.”
and Steve hoped Tony was feeling the same. He squeezed his hand closed again and Tony moaned high and beautiful, back arching, one hand scrambling on the seat at his hips, the other clenched by his head at Steve’s other hand.
After a long while, Tony decided that watching Steve develop a crick in his neck was going to give himself a crick in his own neck. He pulled out his pocket tools and picked himself out of the cell, then took his pillow and blankets and laid them gently on the desk then turned to the gently snoring Steve.
Tony sighed and proceeded to as Steve ordered. He’d only been catching a breather, even if the trench digging was simple work.
Steve shook his head.
As they make their way to Tony’s car, Tony slips his arm out of hers and makes his way to the front of the car where the trunk was opening. She follows him over and looks over his shoulder at the long silver case he has stored there. As she steps in place beside him, he opens the case with two clicks and a beep. The lid flips open slowly with a hiss and Natasha sees a metal arm, whole left arm, with intricate plates, nestled between the foam linings. She looks up at Tony with a quirked eyebrow in question.
“He’s not wrong, you know,” Tony says, and smiles at Steve.
” He gave one last squeeze at Tony’s wrists, then calmed himself and sat back onto the chair to enjoy the sight of Tony before him.
“Thor!”
They walk on. “So,” Bruce says, “hypothetically speaking, again, if we were to organize a charity event, and we were to have people bid for a date with any Avenger on stage, would you be keen?”
Steve turns to see a soldier in modern army gear run toward them around the tombstones. The young man comes to a halt beside Tony with an ecstatic expression and holds out a pen and paper.
Steve sits to pull on socks with his back to Sam but Sam can sense the eyes directed momentarily at the ceiling. “Sam, I’m flattered, but you know I only see you as a friend—“
It was a game Steve thrilled in playing -- shattering Tony’s control and using his toys against him. Slowly, so very slowly, he dragged his palms down the front of Tony's chest, feeling the contrast of suit, shirt, waistcoat, and skin. He stopped to pinch sharply at Tony's nipples through three layers of fabric, breathed in Tony's groan, and continued on his way down until he was undoing the front of Tony's pants and slowly pulling the fly open over the bulge of Tony's erection.
Steve shook his head. “If that’s the case, I should be long gone by now, right?”
No calls came his way, as dictated by the lockdown, but he had JARVIS read him the prodding messages from Clint and Natasha, who were still following leads with Maria on the kid. Bruce was still Hulk. Thor was still AWOL. Tony just wanted
Tony sighed. Fixing up the town, providing all the hardware, and giving back missing limbs to the townsfolk were things he took joy in. But then there was what had happened to Bucky. And maybe if he had tried harder, Bucky wouldn’t have—He shook his head. He couldn’t let death be his only legacy. He had to try harder.
“—Christ, Rhodey, so help me if you finish that description—“
“Of course. I’m completely sane and unaffected by the decomposing, disembodied limbs trying to drag you to hell.”
Steve nods slowly at his words and Sam senses the event horizon approaching. “No promises, Sam. But, yeah, I think I’ll try for it. Thanks.” He looks at Sam, smile turning a little devious. Oh shi—
And Steve didn’t even know who he was.
This was heading into a territory Tony didn’t particularly know how to articulate. He leaned back against the wall, having unconsciously moved closer to Steve from the cot while he’d been talking, and tried to think it over. When he thought he could put it to words, he opened his mouth with an answer.
Steve nodded and squeezed at Tony’s shoulders, indicating for him to continue.
Tony continued to nudge at Steve’s shoulder, punctuating each prod and poke with small nudges of his hips and kisses feathered beneath Steve's jaw. He let his hands roam like he'd always wanted to when they'd been in bed together, cataloguing all of Steve's sensitive spots, where Steve leaned into his touch, where Steve shivered at the contact. The familiar feeling of – dare he say it –
He pats Tony on the back as Tony bemoans how Steve had rejected him and they never had their movie marathon. Jim knew for certain that Tony only emailed a list of movies (compiled by FRIDAY) to Steve with only a smiley face and a “y/y?”. Steve had replied with a thanks and… apparently that had been it.
“You could,” Tony said with a small shrug.
Tony tipped his head at Steve, eyes glinting. “Clubbing?”
Tony followed along. The slime hadn’t been other dimensional so it couldn’t have skipped like Colonel Sanders had. Could it have something to do with the light Tony saw when the Trap closed? It had been sickly green and went through all his filters. He pulled out his phone and cycled through data on the visible spectra of hauntings, tapping in a command for JARVIS to perform a search at the same time.
"A big baldy with a bowler hat got to me," Stark said, conversational. "I managed to get to the Bartons before he knocked me down, tied me up, then left me here and rode on towards you. Did you see him, by chance?"
"Ravish away, Steve," Tony said, a hitch in his breath. "One minute, or you'll be owing me another favor."
There are faceless men standing behind and around Tony, forcing his shoulders back and pushing his head down again and again into a barrel of dirty water. They’re jeering at Tony, calling him a murderer, a god of death, a war profiteer, a whore, a corporate negligee. The box in Tony’s hand is sparking - a battery - and Tony is drowning.
Tony straightened from where he was lounging against the kitchen counter and sipped at what appeared to be a steaming cup of coffee. He took one last obnoxiously loud slurp then set the cup down and walked around the counter to stand in front of Steve.
“We appreciate what you’ve kindly contributed—“
Jim watches as Tony sighs and slips off his stool, moving towards at empty table further into the bar. Jim signals to the bartend before he follows.
break it with Steve? He could take the Iron Man suit to extremes but this was all on Tony the man, not Tony in the tin can, and Tony the man couldn't just make his hang-ups go away with a well placed repulsor blast? He was…waiting for the right time to broach the subject?
Stark licked his lips, a slow drag of tongue, leaving them moistened and shiny. The scales tipped towards the other hand.
“I’d forgotten, you know,” Tony said, eyes still closed. “You’re here for a reason, a purpose.”
Steve started putting away the cold foodstuffs first. Vegetables in the vegetable drawer. Meat in the freezer. Milk in the door. Butter on the tray. Eggs in the eggrack.
That startled a laughter out of Steve and he braced a hand on the seat by Tony’s head, the other still held loosely at Tony’s chest. “Moment, Tony. We’re having a moment.”
Tony bit back something that sounded almost like a moan and Steve’s hands jerked a little in surprise, pushing. Tony tipped back with the movement and he opened his eyes to stare back at Steve, equally surprised. “You can move me?”
“Boss blacks them out himself,” FRIDAY adds with a hint of frustration. "I only apply the usual protocols for his communication with the rest of you."
Steve grinned. “You bet."
“I was happy,” Steve said quietly.
“It’s the 2010s now.”
“If it helps,” Steve added, “I can feel that light in Tony’s chest,”
“Rhodey!” Tony yells as he launches himself at Jim. Jim plants his feet before Tony almost bowls him over in a hug.
Tony had startled at Steve’s movement but Steve could see him relax almost immediately. Steve could also see him narrow his eyes, thinking. A small smirk appeared on his face and Steve breathed an internal sigh of relief.
“Because I liked it.” Steve cut in quickly, hoping to forestall the panic rising in Tony’s voice. He’d never been good at these things. He steeled himself and carried on. “I think you did as well. It helped me. And I miss it. I—I want it back. What we had. I want it back. All of it.”
“Muffins. He bakes us muffins when he’s in the mood. Usually after a marathon texting session with you.”
had walked the streets to fight off a giant blob of slime. Once again, a group of middle-aged men had saved the city. Tony, finally, after the death of his parents and Jarvis, had read up all he could of the paranormal. He had hoped, maybe, to see them again.
Steve remembered the way the Iron Man gauntlet had been crushed between his fingers. There hadn’t been blood and he hadn’t heard a scream from the thrown back helmet. Steve had wanted that faceplate up, then. He had wanted to feel Tony’s flesh give way beneath his fist. He had tried to pry Tony out of his shell using his hands and his shield. Tony had always been stronger than him in the armor and Steve knew all the vulnerable points to hit. It should have made him stop, when Tony hadn’t fought back even before his armor had been battered and showing more man than machine. He hadn’t stopped. He should have.
“I don’t want anything other than an explanation of what happened back there,” Steve said with a jerk of his thumb over his shoulder. Maybe he was being selfish in wanting to find out about Stark’s personal life, but he was going to take this chance.
mischievous expression. “But if I could just make him die, I wouldn’t need permission to take him.” Its grin widened. “He is mine now.”
“It’s all I’m good for.”
“Just get a room!” Clint yelled over the shared comms, and they all laughed, Tony chuckling weakly at the implication.
Tony smiled. “It didn’t have it, because I had a piece of it, and I traded a piece of mine for it. Gave it to you. Made you whole again.” A spasm tore up Tony’s left arm, from the Stone, and Tony couldn’t help but cry out at the pain. Shit, he couldn’t keep this up. He tried to drop the Stone, but….
prove anything?” Clint asked.
Before he closes the door, he hears Tony calling out.
And there is an audible pop as Tony and Steve disengage their lips and look around in unison to where Bruce and Thor are standing in the corridor.
Tony twiddled his thumbs.
“Tony.”
Before Steve could make his predicament heard, he was tumbled sideways to the ground with Tony's thighs still clamped around his chest. He found himself staring up at the grey sky haloed around the brim of his hat on Tony's head. The taste of Tony was still on his tongue, and he was still hard and breathless, but he started guffawing in earnest. Tony gave him a devious grin and Steve couldn't help but laugh even harder. Figures he couldn’t keep Tony Stark tied down for any length of time.
“Nothing I haven’t seen before,” Steve said quickly.
“Hey, Sam,” Steve says, voice muffled in his shirt. “Good flying today.”
He broke away and rolled off the person who was not Jess, right onto the floor. He mumbled an apology into the hard wood and groped for his peas, then crawled his way out of the common area to go find his new bedroom.
Tony was still too coherent. Steve mouthed his way down the side of the shaft. He let his hair catch on the wet skin as he sucked and licked his way to the base then pulled back and took Tony right into his throat with one slide.
He ignored the searing burn of the Stone in his palm and focused on
T'Challa held up his hand. "The blame lies at Zemo's feet. He will be tried by the system and he will be found wanting. I wish to apologize for the trouble I have caused you in my grief. I was mistaken in my chase for vengeance."
“That’s him,” Tony said with a jerk of his thumb at Cap.
Sam looks up. “I’m breaking the bro code here, if I ask her out.”
Steve, not knowing what else to do, moves to sit on the bed. He doesn’t know what Tony will remember of this dream but there are so many things he’s never said out loud to Adult Tony, fearing he’d be shut down in face of the sentiment but maybe here, he can get his thoughts across. He thinks for a moment and decides to go for it. “How about a story about one of the bravest, most caring men I know?”
,” Tony said, incredulous. “My sound and camera filters have filters. Hermetically sealed and all that jazz.” He turned to Steve and thumped at his own chest, right over the arc reactor. “I’m fine. I’ll be fine. I promise.”
“I know it’s a really bad time“ –Tony snorted– "but why haven’t we had sex?”
– and he still needed more. He needed to get closer, he needed—he rocked his hips forward and realized the problem immediately.
There was silence from the speakers and Tony tried hard to listen for any sign of life from Steve and to ignore the fact that Steve had been
“Or maybe,” came the testy reply, “we were just made to feel like this physically, and our own minds decided who we want to feel it with.”
.” He wriggled in Steve’s lap and they both gasped at the feeling. “I’ve finished everything planned for the year. I’m officially on holiday.” He turned his head and nosed at Steve’s cheek. “Take me home.”
T'Challa nodded again, and strode on. The aftermath of a broken friendship was never pleasant to witness but he would do this. He was taking his first steps in correcting his mistakes and making peace with one of the largest hurdles he would be facing during his reign. He only wished he could know if his father would have approved of his actions.
bared its teeth, expression almost feral on its borrowed features. “What makes you think he can be revived?”
“I had a good time,” Steve said. “With the team, with you,” he raised another hand to cup at Tony’s cheek, “and it would have been my choice to stay, even as a ghost.”
The hand at his waist lowered to pinch at his ass and Tony yelped, leaning back to give Steve a mock scandalized look. Steve chuckled and Tony felt the vibrations run through him. This was real. Steve was real. And he was solid. And he
Steve frowns and looks around. The details are a little different; there are benches where no benches had been, and there is a distinct lack of the Iron Man armor. He looks down and sees that Tony looks different, too. His hair is curlier, longer, and his goatee is in a different style. His eyes are also bloodshot and his face is pallid from lack of sleep.
Steve shook himself back into control and pushed away with effort, earning himself a silly pout. He had plans and desperate rutting was not one of them.
They spend over an hour chatting over food and drinks and Bruce lets himself relax. He isn’t here for official Avengers business. It’s been peaceful for the past few weeks, with only the odd minor villain holding up jewelry trucks or trying to blow up a building. Small things, on the scale of peace to "robot apocalypse", as Tony puts it.
"No!" The Captain spoke up loud and quick, and even the Soldier gave him a startled look. "He—he's. He's fine. The suit's disabled. Partially disabled. He's grounded, but he can move. He's fine. He's—"
There was a long silence before Steve answered. “Same.”
“No!” the kid yelled at him and shot another round of that pink energy in his general direction.
found a puppy earlier in the day. He’d taken it right back to the flustered owner who had been walking the little fella. He’d also turned down an offer for coffee as a Valentine’s date but that was beside the point of the here and now.
Steve turned away and buried his face in the cushions.
He had an idea of how he must look. Back lit by the lights outside the window behind him, his Captain America uniform was pristine, his hair brushed just so, and everything was just right to Tony’s tastes. He crossed his gloved hands in front of him on the desk and studied Tony, face betraying nothing. He hoped he would get this right.
When he started feeling light-headed, he pulled off and fell forward to rest his forehead on Tony's heaving belly. He felt a soothing hand running through his hair as he caught his own breath. He thought he did a stellar job, all around.
. Certainty Two said anything was possible, but Tony drew a line at
Another three hours and eight explosive, yet unsatisfying, orgasms later, he had an entire library of fantasies built up in his mind for things he could do with Steve – things he could do
“Indeed,” Vision agrees.
“Right,” Tony says, “so that happened.”
Five minutes and a laughter-induced stomach ache later, Tony is wrapped around Steve, head pillowed on his ridiculously well-muscled chest.
“Nice to meet you,” Tony said without looking up. He couldn’t look. “Enjoy your stay. So. New member. I got it. Nice being updated. I’ll see you when I see you.” And he turned tail and left the room.
“I don’t want our first time to be like this,” Tony said, this time trying for something that was a little bit of the truth.
Tony made a decision and released the back of the suit, stepping out and around to face Steve in his undersuit. He circled a finger at the arc reactor and nodded at Steve. “Try it now.”
It was quivering and Tony thought it was crying.
And Steve realized then that Tony didn’t, not really. Tony might have broken Steve’s trust but Steve had also broken Tony’s: during the Civil War, multiple times, again and again refusing Tony’s hand, sometimes literally, just so he could keep his moral high ground.
“How did Steve get his shield?” Tony asked the obvious, mind unable to come up with anything else. “How did
He’d started taking up his time by tagging in on PLASM missions with the team sans Tony, mostly sitting in the Quinjet, taken the team up on Trivia Nights (he could beat Thor, if that was any consolation) for the sake of learning about the new age, learned some biophysics and psychophysiology from Bruce, and then had still spent more time than was probably healthy in Tony’s workshop with Tony.
“I did what I thought was right.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Through his cameras, Tony saw her shoot a dozen stingers onto the chicken then dash away as it roared in what was probably pain. Three of Clint’s arrows flew over the chicken and four arcs of light connected to the stingers from four arrows embedded around the chicken. The chicken squawked again and fell heavily to the ground under the proton streams. His new gear was working like a charm. Good, because the old proton packs may have worked for the original Ghostbusters but they were ghastly and impractical for people like Natasha and Clint.
“I’m in my usual spot!” Steve yelled back, feeling a beat in his chest. “I wanted to make sure you were okay. You’d never miss watching The Matrix or planning a party. And it’s not like I haven’t seen a naked man before.” He had been in the army and Tony of all people should definitely know that.
“Brucie! You’re here! We have to go play in the labs—“
"Nothing to be sorry for,” Steve murmured, a hand moving to cradle the back of Tony’s head. “It’s not all your fault. And I like it when we talk."
They walk in and Steve, through the haze, can make out a large study with two opposing walls of shelves filled with books and blueprints and other paraphernalia. The desk at the centre dominates and Howard is standing over it, plotting something out on a large map spread over the entire desk. Howard looks good for his age; he must be about sixty now and his hair is still mostly brown.
The sky was still blue and there was an unarmored Tony and himself, and only a few armed guards from their convoy. He didn’t know if he would have put this amount of trust in Tony had their positions been reversed. He could run. He could knock the guards down, easy. But he wouldn’t because he still had his honor intact.
century, even coming from someone who didn’t even know him: people have preconceived images of him. At SHIELD in his Captain America persona, all the agents fawned over him, idolized him and idealized him. They judged him and put him in a box. It was stifling and it was restrictive and Steve wanted to get away. Steve knew he wasn’t only Captain America – the title, the “Legend” – but all his meaningful interactions have been with SHIELD and the Avengers as Captain America and he really wanted to get away from fronting that persona all the time.
Steve got to work, teasing his fingers into Tony's ass one by one, eased by a minimal amount of lube. Tony let out lovely moans at each finger added as Steve took over the talking and whispered all his dirty thoughts into Tony's ear, glad that Tony couldn't see him blush through describing the many ways he was going to ruin Tony and the suit. When Steve pushed a fourth finger into Tony's loosening hole, he gave the back of Tony's neck a kiss and knelt down to check his handiwork, fingers never leaving their snug place inside Tony's body.
It was the day before Valentine’s Day and the weather had finally taken a turn for the good. PLASM had been receiving increasingly frantic calls about ‘inappropriate behavior’ out in broad daylight and the Avengers have once again been called out for a Slime containment mission.
Steve flipped the eggs. They sizzled in the pan. He took a pinch of salt and sprinkled it on. One of the yolks broke as he flipped it again and he held back a sigh.
In the end, the Stone had been taken to Asgard, and Tony had been left with uncertainties and an empty space by his side. The paranormal activities had lessened with the manifestation and stabilization of the Soul Stone and he’d taken on a more hands-off role with his consulting. He’d not gone on a mission with the Avengers and hadn’t been to a single meeting in person. He knew the others had been trying to get in contact with him but he’d passed them all on to Larry-what’s-his-name, his PA. This would be his first time facing the team in a long while and he was a fashionable twenty minutes early when he breezed into Conference Room Five with a confident smile pasted to his face.
“Say yes. Let me have
He pushes at the bed with a hand and rolls himself on top of Steve. Steve’s hands find their way to massaging at his hips and Tony takes full control of the kiss, hands rubbing up and down Steve’s neck and jaw.
It was in the way Steve caught the beginnings of ferocity of Tony’s passion, lips bitten until they were swollen, fighting and fighting until Tony had his way and Steve was left helpless in the trails of his blaze; the way Steve had to battle for control, repaying each heated stroke of tongue with an answering nip from his teeth, tempering and tempering until they found a rhythm once again.
came Barton's voice,
. “What happened to Steve? Why do you need power? What are you going to do?”
Down in Tony’s private workshop, Tony shed the suit and freed himself into the cool, filtered air. His crotch thanked him but also screamed at him for more contact. More pressure. More friction. More more more—
Tony breaks off from Steve’s lips, mouth following his fingers down Steve’s neck and to his collarbones. He looks up, taking in Steve’s red, swollen lips, and licks wetly at his own. “Round Five?”
“Nice motor control,” Steve says, sitting down on the other armchair. “New arm? Looks different.”
Tony whimpered again and Steve drank in the sound, biting down on the junction of Tony’s neck and shoulder. He dropped his hands to Tony’s thighs and rubbed to Tony’s rhythm. He let his gloved thumb brush along Tony’s cock with every movement, teasing just a little. The squeak of leather filled his ears. Steve’s uniform was going to need a thorough cleaning before it could be fit for the public again.
Tony laughed out loud, a hand thumping the bed between them. “We’ll see about that, Captain Arrogant.”
Stark snorted. “You’d be surprised what passes as gossip for the sharks.”
Bruce laughs at the string of text-groans that follow Vision's revelation. He pockets his phone and looks to the sky. It was still clear. He may still be driven to run, to get away, to not call anywhere ‘home’, but these people are starting to make him feel like he could stay here.
Tony thought he should have heeded it more.
He hears the quick patter of small feet and turns just in time to catch a young boy barreling around a corner and into his arms. Steve looks down and sees Tony’s brown eyes peering up at him through messy brown hair.
and he was not going to succumb to this
It would all be worth it.
Tony took a step forward and really studied the entity - the ghost - standing before him. It—He looked exactly like in Howard’s old pictures; the flop of his blond hair, the light blue of his eyes, the damned
He scrambled to help Steve shove his pants off his hips just enough to feel the heat of skin pressed against sweat-slick skin. It was almost harder to do than the twenty-four hours of almost-celibacy he’d endured but when his dick did finally touch Steve’s, the last little slivers of sanity left him and he gave in to the primal urge to just rut and take and take and give and give—
Steve snuffled and buried his face deeper into Tony’s hair.
He needed so much—
to trust you and tell you everything about my private life that you don’t want any part of anymore—“
There was a shuffling beneath him and it took him a few precious seconds to realize he’d fallen on top of someone who had already been laid out on the cushions. He rolled around and braced himself over the person, trying to see past his own shadow from the soft light of the kitchen behind him. He glimpsed a head of dark hair. Jess? Second surprise, but at least Jess wasn’t hard on the eyes and wasn’t a Skrull this time…
“What kind of question is that?” Steve asked right back, voice sharp. “You know I wouldn’t. Not unless it was with you.”
“And I know what
“Tony.”
He considered Steve a good friend. He trusted Steve. Certainty Three and Howard be damned.
They’d done the easiest first and visited all the graves of the people he knew whom he had left behind; people of sentimental importance. He had gone to Howard’s grave first, given his anchor to the material in Tony’s chest that had been a part of his shield. He’d visited Dum-Dum’s grave. Dernier’s grave. Jones’ grave. Morita’s grave. Falsworth’s grave. Heck, even Colonel Phillips’s grave. Bucky’s parent’s graves. He’d still visited his parent’s grave and Bucky’s grave even though they had been the ones who had left him behind, but he couldn’t bear to not see Bucky again, even if it had been as part of a granite memorial.
“Please, Ste—“
Steve lunged forward, all semblance of calm evaporating in an instant. His shoulder connected with the
Natasha sits back and narrows her eyes at Tony. Tony fidgets in his seat in a manner she will never admit out loud to be endearing.
Beyond the planet around him, Tony could see pinpricks of light from far away, at the edges of the galaxy, the universe. He screwed his eyes against the rush of distances and focused back on to Earth, to New York. As promised, the Stone stopped summoning more to the world and Tony could see many of the fainter glows vanish.
"I hurt him," the Captain said quietly as he passed. "Check if he's okay. Please." He didn't have to say it for T'Challa to know he meant more than just physically.
Tony closed the door and leaned heavily against it.
Tony rubbed at his face and tried to not yell. “I’m his son. Anthony Stark. Tony, to you, if you’re into the whole name calling shtick.”
“You went backwards with that,” Stark said. He tucked his sunglasses into his pocket and stepped towards Steve with an outstretched hand. “Anthony Stark, but you should call me Tony.”
Stark gave a half-hearted snort but made an affirmative noise. He moved in lurching motions towards his Iron Man helmet which lay in the shadows near the shield. It broke into two pieces as he picked it up and he tucked it under one arm as he bent again, with some difficulty, to pick up the shield. "Guess he made his choice," he muttered. He maneuvered the shield to his back. It clicked with a clang of metal and stuck fast. "All I've got left of his patriotic ass, now. Run off, just like all the other ducklings."
Clint activated the small explosives embedded into the tanks. The tanks blew open on the side facing the blob and spilled the yellow Anti-Slime Slime around it. The blob trembled and let out a low pitched keen.
Steve sat now, amused, while Tony spouted off about vampires and teenage girls. After a full ten minutes of watching the other man gesture increasingly wildly, it was apparent that Tony was actually serious, and Steve has to put up a hand. Surprisingly, Tony stopped talking.
“The answer’s still no, Stark.”
"Some secrets aren't his to tell," T'Challa said, ignoring all the personal landmines.
Tony looks as he does now: his hair is short and slightly waved and spiked over his forehead, a strand occasionally falling into his eyes; there is a little bit of silver at his temples; his goatee is trimmed and full; there are laugh lines at the corners of his eyes that Steve secretly adores; and there’s an arc reactor glowing in his chest which Steve can feel a pull from. Tony’s eyes are bright and there’s none of the tired lines that dominated his face in his waking hours.
Steve backhanded the agent and frowned in distaste at the four bloody gouges newly opened on the man’s face. He didn’t like the blood.
Around them, the newly opened Café Auviene is bustling with noon activity. The name is a little inaccurate and pretentious but the food is more than decent. Tourists and locals alike make their orders, talk about their day or, in the case of the occupants of the table in the corner, make plans for an “exchange” to happen tomorrow at midnight. She’ll follow up on that after this but now-
Steve grinned back and shook his head. “Nope,” he said, popping the P. “Everyone needs to get at least one bruise.”
Steve sighs pointedly and takes a drink from his newly opened can. He gives Bucky a sidelong look. Bucky doesn’t like what’s coming next, if he’s reading Steve’s expressions correctly—
“Tony.” And Steve saw right through his bullshit even if it was half true.
“I need more power. He was not whole. I could not take him all.”
The two men before him fell silent and T'Challa turned his attention away from his loss. He was greeted with two faces set in determination.
Tony looked away. “I don’t need anyone fighting my nightmares for me.”
