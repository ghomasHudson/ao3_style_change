Steve hesitated before shaking his head. He appreciated the offer, but it seemed too much like admitting he couldn’t handle the silence. He wanted the three days to be over. But he wanted to
“Cap has gone into worse situations with less intel.  He’ll agree,” Fury said with a level of confidence in his voice that could only come from being a Dom in the military talking about a lower-ranked Sub.  If Tony had ever tried to tell one of the Subs under his employ that he’d be deciding their intimate life for them, they’d have had the National Association for Submissives’ Rights on him faster than the suit could go from zero to one hundred.
they were together. Tony had never made a point of taking Steve out where they’d be noticed, had seemed to do the opposite in fact, and Steve had appreciated it at the time, although he’d never thanked Tony for it, just like all the other things he’d accepted from Tony but never acknowledged.
person Steve would ever want to scene with, his half-formed hopes of being allowed to take care of Steve that way withering and dying.)
He’d been lying on his stomach, and there were what he assumed to be bandages on his back. Which meant that …
Telling Steve that being anxious about Tony walking away was still a valid reason to use his safeword seemed almost cruel right then. So he pushed it off for later, too exhausted and just fucking unhappy to face it.
,” he says, gesturing at Steve, “so I’ll forgive you this one time.  After that, you serenaded me with music from the forties, ordered two of everything off the dine-in menu, and then eventually passed out on the bed while we were watching reruns of Gilligan’s Island.  And voila, it’s a party a second in Las Vegas!”
He waited for Tony to tell him what to do next, but Tony didn’t look up, even though he had to know Steve was there. Steve wondered if that meant Tony wanted him to leave him alone, or to continue to stand there, or if Steve had missed a cue to do something else, but he didn’t ask for clarification. He’d given up that privilege.
And following up on that thought was the realization that he relief he felt wasn’t based on the fact that Stark had stepped in, but that Stark had
Steve took off for the tree line, ignoring the voice in his head that wanted to tell Tony he didn’t need a head start. It was a remnant from the days when he’d stand his ground, no matter the odds against him, and it wasn’t necessary here. This was just training, and there was no reason he shouldn’t use the time. Tony’d be able to take him down fast according to their rules if he stood around in the meadow, and that wasn’t what Steve wanted. He wanted Tony to have to fight for it.
He felt drained—happy and weirdly calm—but so, so tired, and he didn’t fight the urge to say, “Thank you,” one more time, his voice low and scratchy. Tony laughed, gently ruffling his hair.
to say his safeword, felt … he didn’t know how he felt about Tony being in that situation actually, too many things to make sense of, but he did know he was glad Tony had stopped, that his Dom at the time had respected it, but it wasn’t the same thing. That had been something Tony had been curious about, not … not this.
“What’s your safeword?” he asked and couldn’t stop the sharp smile that bloomed on his face when Steve answered.
“Tony?” he coughed, shaking and unable to stop.  He couldn’t get control of his limbs, couldn’t get them to move or turn, but Tony was holding him, holding him and not letting go.
“Oh, is that what we’re talking about?” Bucky asks, and Steve can hear the damn smirk in his voice. “I wasn’t sure you were interested since you never responded to my text.”
Steve was panting by the time they pulled apart, and even with all the rest of it, Tony watched him with a fierce satisfaction. Steve was going to compare that kiss with everyone’s that came after, and Tony had no doubt that it’d be a long time before his would be found wanting.
*is also realistic, however, and when has this fic ever cooperated, so if we hit 100K, then we hit 100K* *sighs*
, like Dr. Stark is a steak he desperately wants to sink his teeth into, what the hell—”but my battery died,” because his soon-to-be-ex-best-friend had been playing games on it, “and I didn’t realize until it was too late.”
Or maybe it was just that he wanted to be the one taking care of Tony for a change, Steve thought as Tony carefully wiped a trail of water from his forehead before it could reach his eyes. It just always felt like Tony was the one doing things for him and not the other way around. Sure, Steve had known Subs who'd dreamed about being pampered by their Doms, but he’d never been one of them. He’d always worked hard for all the good things in his life, and he couldn’t stop the niggling feeling that if he didn’t
Tony slid his own arms around Steve at the same time, one hand spread across the middle of his back, the other clasping Steve’s opposite shoulder. He squeezed Steve, a quick pulse, and then just stood there, gently rubbing up and down Steve’s spine.
Steve nearly yells into his ear at the sensation, and Tony swears they actually rise up a bit into the air as Steve’s wings beat and flail.
Steve wasn’t the type of person to pretend or make up emotions that weren’t there, but faced with losing something good—because Tony had to believe Steve would’ve left by now if they hadn’t—
Tony tried to cover his momentary lapse with a laugh. “So what, you were in the neighborhood and decided to drop in? Why are you
As if he could erase the past six hours of suffering. As if he had any right to tell Steve to do anything anymore.
It’d even become something of a routine, Stark lingering over his drink and occasionally telling him he’d missed something, grinning unabashedly all the while.
Finally, Dr. Stark moves on to the exam itself, and it’s torture to have his hands on Steve’s neck, his back as Dr. Stark tells him what to do. He’s standing so close, and Steve shivers and presses his thighs together, trying to hide his scent as long as possible, because once he moves, it’s going to permeate the entire room.
—damn it.” He closed the distance between them and hugged him, wrapping his arms as much as he could around him as Tony expressed his frustration and sorrow, and Tony slowly quieted, letting out a few last mournful
at him, all bright baby blues and sincere smile, and if Tony had thought that having him look into his eyes would be better than having him stare everywhere else, then he’d been wrong.
Pepper kept telling him that one day when he was least expecting it, he’d turn around and wham!  There’d be the Omega for him.  And when they got married, she’d laugh and laugh and laugh.
Steve can’t help taking a quick peek at Tony’s body since they’re talking about it, and although he can’t see everything, from what he can tell, Tony has nothing to be ashamed about.
over the summer. *happy screaming* I was in the middle of a crazy move, however, and couldn’t fawn over it as much as it deserved. It’s sooooooooo good!  You guys should read it and help me convince them to continue it! Moar chapters, moar chapters! <3 We all need more Dr. Stark in our lives.
“Alright,” Tony said, pushing down the front of his pants, the material thin and loose, and Tony had been prepared. “Open your mouth,” he ordered, but it was unnecessary, because Steve was already leaning in.
“Indeed, Sir,” JARVIS said, and Steve didn’t understand how he could feel a stab of envy at the order, but he did. He would’ve made Tony coffee if he’d asked. Tony could tell him to do something, and he’d do it. He’d do anything.
So this is now a series! This installment might have a part 2, though. What do you think, guys? A little bit of porn for the end of the date? Or shall we move on to actual, actual medkink?
The thing was that Tony didn’t. He didn’t want Steve gone, and that made him one of the most masochistic Doms to ever walk the face of the earth, because the last time Steve had invaded his life, things hadn’t gone well for him.
Steve takes his time getting dressed, wiping at the inside of his thighs and his buttocks and lower back in order to get the worst of the slick off of him. He puts paper towels on the step so whoever comes in to clean will know he left a mess there and then tidies up as much as he can. His thoughts are focused on Dr. Stark the whole time. It’s not really different than usual, but what is different is
Just minutes ago, Tony had told Steve that Doms weren’t perfect, but he’d never felt the pain of that truth as much as when Steve just sat there, hiding from him, defeat etched in every line.
If Steve had been more experienced, Tony would’ve adjusted his position, moved him closer to the couch, spread his knees a little more, put his hands where he wanted them. But Steve wasn’t, so Tony was the one who shifted around, slipping his fingertips through the fine hairs at Steve’s temple, making Steve close his eyes to hide Tony sliding closer to the edge and to the side until Steve was directly in between his legs. There—hopefully—would be time for correction later. Right now, he didn’t want Steve to worry about anything except what Tony was doing to him.
There’s no one else in the room, no one else in the entire office in all likelihood, and even if there were, it’s not like Dr. Stark is shouting or even using a loud voice. But it’s still shocking to hear him discuss Steve’s condition in a public space.
“Feel free to keep picking things up, though!” Tony said, slapping him cheerfully on the arm, and Steve couldn’t think of a response—to any of it—before he was gone.
“Steve, just because you refuse to download the messaging app doesn’t mean the rest of the world is stuck in the forties.”
It was the first time Tony had touched him sexually in days, the first time Tony had touched him there specifically in over a week, and Steve knew he had no one to blame but himself, but he wanted—
For a second, it seemed like the world had become white and silent. And then sight and sound came back to him in sickening bursts.
“Oh, Steve, what have I told you before? You never need to apologize for wanting me,” Tony said, a pang running through him. “Now c’mon.” He reached around, fingers brushing Steve’s cock, not surprised when he found him still hard. Steve had always had a ridiculously fast recovery time.
Tony’s back in the shirt he’d given Steve. And yes, it’s rumpled, but all the buttons are done up and the sleeves are rolled down, and for some reason he’s wearing one of Steve’s ties and carrying one of Steve’s notebooks, and there’s something about the way he’s standing, just a tiniest bit straighter than he’d been when Steve had gone into the bathroom, his expression coolly pleasant and somewhat distant—
Now that Steve’s been split open on Tony’s cock, Tony is finally able to slide in and out with something resembling ease, and Steve’s making so much slick that he could swear that there are little splashes against his thighs with each thrust. The friction is intense enough to make him hold on to Tony for all he’s worth, and he’s nearly curled up into a ball, his knees by his ears, but even now he’s unwilling to stop kissing Tony, although he’s lost all technique at this point, just panting and making weak, helpless noises as Tony’s tongue invades his mouth.
“Now, see, this is exactly what I’m talking about,” Tony says, walking up to him. He takes Steve’s arm and slings it over his shoulders. “You shouldn’t be standing up.”
that,” Steve said, even though he was barely paying attention to what Stark was saying. He just wanted to get away, and maybe Stark realized that, because he jerked his wrist forward, and Steve found himself falling forward until he was on all fours above him, the pull on his wrist like an undertow, dragging him further and further away from the safety of the shore.
“What if he offered, though?” Steve said, leaning forward in his seat. “The next day, when everyone was leaving, Tony said I always had a place with him if I wanted it. Would he still be in breach if I didn’t take him up on it?”
So Tony had convinced himself he’d imagined it, and except for the rest of that day when Steve had been distant and cautious around him, they’d gone back to acting the same way they’d been before, walking slightly out of step while they figured out how to dull the jagged edges between them.
He looked down before Bruce could hopefully notice, and he placed his hand carefully on Bruce’s arm, leaning in to brush their mouths together. It was the lightest of touches, and even as he told himself that it was nothing, he knew he’d relive the moment again and again in the weeks to come.
“Hello, Steve. I’m Dr. Reynolds,” the man said, a Dom from his bearing, and he addressed Steve and not Stark, although he didn’t offer his hand, and neither did Steve.
“Are . . . I see,” Steve said, not sounding like he saw at all, and thank fuck. Tony could deal with confusion. Tony could happily deal with confusion all day.
“In or out,” Tony said, his voice clipped, using the dregs of his self-restraint to keep from responding to Steve the way he wanted to.  “Make up your mind.”
Steve had long arms, but the angle made it difficult, so he turned his body slightly and after hesitating for a second, lifted his right leg so his knee was on the ottoman as well, curling into a C. Then he fucked himself slowly, all too conscious of what he was doing but focused more on the silence, on the lack of sounds which hopefully meant Tony’s attention was on him.
“Tony,” he said, and damn it, he’d meant to call him Stark. He plowed on anyway. “I think everyone on this entire floor could hear you.”
“So any exciting plans for the weekend?” Steve asks as they start up a round of 6v6 PVP. “I’m heading towards B,” he says, bypassing A completely. They need to keep control of two zones to win, and it’s easier to get a fresh zone than capture a taken one.
What was the point in Tony wearing himself down? As an artist, he understood that there were times when the muse was more free with her gifts than others, and he’d spent a few nights up later than he should’ve in his time. But it had always caught up with him, made him sicker than he’d been before, more sluggish and slow. There been things he’d drawn that had seemed so perfect in the wee hours of the morning that he’d later looked at, only to realize the dimensions were off, or the shading was bad, or any number of mistakes that he hadn’t noticed, and then he’d had to spend hours fixing something that would’ve taken only minutes if he’d seen it right away.
A few more minutes, and he’d be done, he thought, noticing his breathing was coming faster but unable to stop it. He could put up with anything for a few more minutes.
“I’ve got you,” he said again, calming his thrashing, and watched the last light fade from his eyes.
“Oh no you don’t,” Steve says and picks him up.  One of Tony’s favorite games is to jump onto unsuspecting people’s heads as they pass by, and Clint has threatened to dropkick him if he does it one more time.  Steve doesn’t think he’d actually go through with it but better to be safe than sorry.  “What am I going to do with you?” he sighs as he rubs under Tony’s chin.
“You realize that you’ve taken away the one good thing that has come from this whole body-swapping fiasco, right?”
He missed Bucky. Peggy. He missed the creaky step on the staircase to his room, and the smell of fresh-baked bread from Mr. Stevens’ bakery that would waft by when the wind was just right. He missed the ubiquity of hats, and the line on the back of women’s stockings, and all the familiar sights and sounds that he’d always taken for granted but were now gone.
Steve lets out a sob when his left knee buckles, and he has to lurch forward to catch himself. The vibrator slips out, it’s buzzing getting louder as a result, but the sound doesn’t cover Steve’s breathless, “I’m sorry,” and Tony shushes him, tells him there’s nothing to be sorry for.
He found him in his lab, busy at work with a welding iron, raucous music blaring over the speakers. Tony didn’t notice him come in, and Steve stood there at a loss.
The corner of her mouth lifted in a half-smirk. “Oh, come on, Steve. There was way too much sexual tension whenever the two of you were in a room back when Loki was a threat, and then you move back to New York after you’d finally started setting down roots in D. C.?”
Before Loki, the only knowledge he’d had of the Jotun were through warriors’ accounts—that ice flowed in their veins; that they drank the blood of their enemies; that they would sooner tear off their own limbs than show mercy or kindness to another—and while he’d realized that embellishment was part of any good story, all the talebearers were in agreement that Jotun were fierce fighters, proud, and monstrous in form and power.
Maybe Tony would make it vibrate? Steve had seen discreet ads for vibrators in Submissives’ magazines back in his day, and he could admit to a being curious about them, although he’d never gone so far as to order one. Maybe Tony would—
of all people, although he could take some small solace in the knowledge that Fury couldn’t be having any fun being there either.  But since Fury was acting as their Negotiator, it was his job to stay in the room in order to make sure neither party felt threatened or coerced.  Although how that worked when Fury was technically higher in the chain of command than Steve and was trying to sell him off like some kind of mail-order bride, Tony had no idea.  SHIELD wasn’t technically under the purview of the Army, however, so maybe there wasn’t a conflict of interest, or maybe it was the fact that it was Captain fucking America, and if anyone could stand up for himself, it’d be the guy who punched Hitler in the face over two hundred times.  Who knew really?
Tony at least had looked just as surprised when they’d unmasked Steve, an expression of what Steve would’ve labeled panic passing over his face if it’d been anyone else.  He wondered if he should take any comfort in knowing Tony hadn’t meant to kill
Tony expected him to urinate into a bottle as Tony held his penis. Steve didn’t know if he’d ever been this embarrassed in his life, shame sweeping through him, and he had to resist the urge to cringe.
“You wouldn’t mind if I got the nipple clamps then, right?” Tony smiled as Steve moaned and then immediately jerked as the vibrations undoubtedly got faster.
“But it’s what you would feel like I was doing,” she said, and the corner of his lips came up in reluctant acknowledgement.
He’d wondered if Steve had noticed that neither Pepper nor Happy had been by since Steve had come back, and apparently he had. He was just glad Steve didn’t know that two of the most important people in Tony’s life both hated Steve for what his leaving had done and would do to Tony in the future. That sometimes Tony resented him for it too.
“What else am I supposed to think, Tony?” he demanded, folding his arms across his chest as if that would keep the hurt pinned inside.  “The whole point of today was to find furniture
Of course, how Steve feels is exactly what keeps getting him into trouble, so he tries to ignore it and mentally prepare himself for what’s coming. It doesn’t help, makes it worse if anything, but he does gets distracted by the discovery that it’s surprisingly nice having blankets piled on top of him. They’re actually really soft and heavier than he’d expected, the weight reassuring, and they smell …
In the meanwhile, if you guys want to read angst that gets resolved quickly (gasp), please give my fic
Steve knew exactly what it felt like to realize the world had moved on without him, but at least Tony would be able to watch Morgan grow into a woman, to be there for her first date and the first time she fell in love. Obviously it was far from perfect, but it was still
“It’s alright,” Tony said in a near wheeze as Peter lifted him into the air with the force of his hug. “I’m fine, there’s nothing to worry about anymore, I’m fine.”
“Put your hands on the back of my thighs,” Tony said, and Steve did. “If you need a break or want the chance to say your safeword, you just have to drop your hands. Do you understand?”
Of course, it had stopped being a prison soon enough, and Steve had chosen the same room when he’d come to Tony again, because the good associations had far outweighed the bad, and staying there had felt more like a continuation of what should’ve been then starting all over again. Nevertheless, when he’d first moved into Stark Tower, when he’d been angry and frustrated at everything and everyone, he’d spent hours staring at the ceiling, at the bottom left corner of the painting to his right, at the horizon outside his window, all while wondering how much longer he’d have to stay with Tony before he would finally be allowed to leave.
Her eyes crinkle as she smiles, bright and wide. They both hear a crash in the back followed by a hoarse, “Did he just—?”
“Then I’m going to train you to behave the way I want. Are you familiar with pet play at all, Steve?”
“Can we just …?” he says, trailing off miserably, humiliation prickling across his skin, and it should smother the arousal, but it really, really doesn’t.
, that hadn’t always been the case. Growing up, Steve had made his peace with it, and he didn’t give much thought to what he looked like on a daily basis, other than to make sure he was neat and put together. He knew Tony considered him good-looking, which was wonderful and not something Steve took for granted, and the thing was that … he didn’t want to give it up. Not even for a short period of time. His appearance was one of the few things he had to make Tony not regret getting rid of Steve, and even though Steve knew it wouldn’t be the deciding factor, he didn’t want to lose anything that might ensure Tony kept him.
“How far along is that? Am I going to be seeing the Stark brand in every doctor’s office next year?” he teases, wanting to see more of that expression.
“You asked me what I want. You’ve always—always wanted to know what I want,” Steve said, and Tony dropped his eyes, a surge of emotion going through him and making it nearly impossible to maintain any kind of facade. He could feel his face contorting, and he fought to keep some sliver of control.
“‘Please bite my plump titties until they’re red and swollen for you?’” Tony asked, flicking Steve’s right nipple hard enough to make him flinch, his gasp soft and shocked.
And Steve let it happen. Maybe not consciously or deliberately, but in the back of his mind, hadn’t he thought it was the least he deserved? He’d sacrificed
Steve didn’t respond right away. “I will be,” he finally said, low and scratchy, and it wasn’t the answer Tony was hoping for, but it was one he could understand.
They kept bumping into walls and tables as they made their way to his bedroom, even heard something shatter at some point, but Tony didn’t let Steve pull away, didn’t care about the collateral damage because he needed to have Steve now.
He’s sure Tony’s probably wondered about him in the past, the omega on Tony’s table who can barely keep his legs closed when he’s around. Maybe Tony had been willing to overlook it before, but he knows Tony has to be realizing just how much better he can do.
“I fucked up,” he said hoarsely, his hand twisting around the handle of his bag. Five minutes. That was no time at all. “I knew I was doing it, but I didn’t—I didn’t
It started when Tony needed his help, depending on him to keep him safe while he fixed the engine. Tony trusted him with his life. It was . . . unsettling.
But Steve can’t say any of that, so he does what’s asked of him instead, opening his eyes and staring fixedly at his legs as he maneuvers himself until his hips are as far as they can go and he’s lying in his own slick, the robe clinging to the wet spots, the smell of his arousal hanging thick in the air.
Steve stifled a moan, the memory making it that much easier to stroke his cock as it let out a spurt of precome, and he rested his hand on his throat, shuddering at how good it felt.
“And why would we do that?” Steve asked, only pausing long enough for the springs to settle before he resumed sketching.
He hadn’t had much luck with it in the past, what with people trying to take over his business and/or kill him, so yeah, maybe he did have a problem with intimacy, but he kind of thought he was justified, all things considered.  Who wanted to open up to someone and then wait to be
“What is it that you owe me?” he asked, point blank, so that Tony couldn’t play any more word games.
“No!” Tony said, turning to smile brightly at Steve. What the hell. Steve wasn’t the vindictive type. He didn’t think. And besides, in for a penny, in for a pound. He took a big bite.
“I only have so many hands,” Tony said, taking a huge bite. “Although that is a thought,” he said, turning contemplative, although it looked rather silly when he took another bite and his cheeks bulged with food. “JARVIS—”
He resolves to avoid looking at him again until they reach land and speeds up as much as he can, but it isn’t actually all that much with everything he’s carrying. Still, every little bit helps.
“Because Dr. Phil doesn’t take house calls?” She sighed. “I don’t know what you want me to say, Tony. I mean, you’re complaining that Steve was trying to be nice. Man, what an asshole.”
“I don’t know about you, but I’m in the mood for just about one of everything on the menu,” Tony said, and that was a good sign, wasn’t it? He had to be doing better if he had an appetite.
He watches as Tony gets closer, butterflies fluttering in his stomach, and it’s funny because Steve’s never had a chance to notice Tony’s shoulder to waist ratio, but … Tony has a really nice shoulder to waist ratio.
“Alright. Let me explain how this thing works. I’m going to strap you in—three times around each leg, three around each arm, and one around each shoulder—but only because I don’t want you to hurt yourself by moving too much. If you safeword, everything stops, although of course, there’s nothing here that you couldn’t break out of by yourself. As I’m sure you noticed, there’s a dildo beneath you. Once I’m finished, I’m going to secure a band around your waist and then stretch you open and put the tip of the dildo inside of you. That won’t come out until we’re finished. It’s attached to the same mechanism that the band is, and wherever you move, the dildo will go with you—assuming you don’t climb out, although I wouldn’t suggest you do that without my help. The band will be
It took a long time for Tony to make sense of the dark shape in front of him and figure out it was a pillow, longer still to realize he had no idea how he’d gotten in bed. He struggled to clear the cobwebs in his brain as he squinted at the numbers on the clock. 19:46. He didn’t know what had woken him up, but he felt like crap, headachy and heavy and like he could sleep for another twenty four hours and still be ready to take a nap afterwards.
The only reason Steve lets go of Tony’s hand is in order to turn around and lock the door. His friends have a habit of walking into his apartment without so much as knocking, and while that normally wouldn’t be a problem, he’d rather everyone had clothes on the first time they met.
“You can come whenever you want,” Tony said, winking at him, and then pushed into Steve steadily as Steve tensed and moaned, not stopping until he was as deep as he could go.
He brought his hands down to his sides, pushing off the mattress and gritting his teeth at the accompanying surge of pain that it caused. He’d been expecting it, since the painkillers would’ve worn off hours ago, but it was the pull of tape against his skin that made him freeze.
It left Tony stunned silent for a moment, that Steve would say something like that, as if he wanted Tony to still be angry with him.
It’s while Tony’s doing the last thing that his Angel flinches, and Tony jerks his tentacles away guiltily, but there’s no other reaction.
He closes his eyes as Dr. Stark touches him, trying to focus on the reassuring stream of chatter instead of his fingers, the occasional brush against Steve’s nipples, the scrape of his lab coat against his skin. Dr. Stark has always been completely professional, but it doesn’t stop Steve from wishing he wouldn’t be, that he’d rub his perfectly trimmed goatee against Steve’s chest and roll and pinch Steve’s nipples until Steve was crying from frustration.
excited anymore—mostly—but he still lets out a surge of slick that practically guarantees he’s going to owe the office a new table because even leather isn’t supposed to get this soaked.
left it at that, but there was just something about the downward tilt of Tony’s mouth that Steve had seen right before he’d turned, as if he were sad to let Steve down (even though Steve hadn’t asked!), and it had him bursting out with a, “Why not?” that came out sounding much more plaintive than he liked.
“Put your hands on the wall,” Tony said after he’d finished rinsing Steve off, and even though it was physically impossible for him to get an erection just yet, his cock throbbed all the same at the thought of what was next. “And one knee up on the bench,” he added when Steve had done as requested.
“Steve …” It took a second for Tony to compose himself before he could talk, the relief making him almost sway in his seat. Fuck. Steve wanted to stay—
“Do you … want to tell me why you … ?” He trailed off, not wanting to pressure Steve but offering him the option to talk.
start ignoring him once the novelty had passed. Nonetheless, if Steve were being fair—something he recognized he didn’t want to be, which only made it even more important that he do it—until he did, Stark’s courtesy meant he, in turn, needed to try harder. He wouldn’t kneel down, but he could be polite, could try to make the next three months bearable, could stop accusing Stark of every possible abuse under the sun just because he wasn’t the Dom Steve had wanted.
Steve had come back to New York with the idea of demanding he and Tony finish out their contract, of letting the threat of litigation—even though he would never have gone through with it—hang over Tony’s head if he didn’t comply. That plan had been thrown out the window almost immediately, because the Tony who’d greeted him would’ve fought, wouldn’t have hesitated to drag both their names through the muck rather than give in.
He certainly wasn’t going to do anything about that now, however, he decided resolutely, getting off the bed. He’d ask to spend the night, and Tony would or wouldn’t say yes, and then they’d go from there.
“We have some of the top geneticists in the country, and they’ve run the tests over and over again.  Unless either one of you have a twin that you aren’t telling us about, he’s your and Rogers’ son.”
ETA 8/9/15: I would like to apologize to all my readers about the lack of update. I had a bad fandom experience on tumblr several months ago that made me wonder why I was in fandom at all if these were the type of people who were in it with me, and while I've tried to get past it, I really haven't felt like writing very much since then. I'm not discontinuing this fic or anything, but if people are wondering, that is what is going on. (I am writing in another fandom cause my pride won't let me drop out of a big bang I've signed up for, but it's like pulling teeth. Blurgh. I'm hoping that posting it will help me get my groove back, but we'll see.)
“Great, it’ll just take me a minute.” Dr. Stark remembers to close the door this time, and Steve wants to be relieved,
He didn’t know who was more surprised, Stark or him, and he found himself staring for a second before he thought to ask, “Are you al—”
they’re foreign and clinical, but he wants everything he can get from Dr. Stark. He can’t help but think the universe is stealing something from him like this.
“Yeah, it’s really me. I guess I can’t call you ‘kid’ anymore, though, huh? You’re all grown up,” he said, his eyes turning sad and wistful, and it was just a couple of minutes later that they got him out of his cell and Peter tried to get ten years worth of hugs in all at once.
He turns both vibrators up to full speed and barely gets his hand on Steve’s cock before Steve’s coming, his voice all but broken. Tony has to brace himself so that Steve doesn’t knock them to the ground as all his weight comes to rest on Tony, but he doesn’t mind.
For a second, it’s like he can’t breathe, the pain is so great, and he has to grab onto the counter to keep steady.
He dug the fingers of his hand into his chest, as if they could claw out the pain that seemed to spike higher and higher with every shaky breath.
And Loki?  Who knew what he wanted.  Not Thor, who couldn’t understand his mercurial shifts of temper, who arrived early to their meetings, only for Loki to make him wait.  He didn’t know what it meant that Loki watched him more and smiled less as the years progressed but would stand so close that Thor could mark the passing of the minutes by his steady breaths.
The answer is no, Steve realizes, after Dr. Stark says, “Lift one leg at a time, and I’ll guide them into the stirrups,” after Steve obeys and Dr. Stark puts his firm hands on Steve’s ankles, sending a cascade of shivers down his back. His legs are spread wide, too wide almost, or at least wider than Dr. Edwards typically has them, and as a result of the extra distance between the stirrups, Steve’s thighs are bent back towards his body, which effectively puts his ass on offer.
“No,” Tony said, rubbing at his eyes. He had a headache building, he felt grimy and disgusting, and his teeth had a coating on them that told him it’d been way too long since he’d brushed them. It must have been his overwhelming animal magnetism that had made Steve proposition him. “Where did he sleep last night?”
“That smug, manipulative, son-of-a-bitch!” he whispered and weighed the likelihood that Fury thought he was just being a good Dom versus him realizing how much he’d come to care for Steve.
Or what if Stark had started thinking about what other possible reasons Steve might have had for reacting the way he did?
He’d toyed with idea of giving up killing, considered taking up, hell, knitting, or building a better spacecraft than anything NASA could put together and going to outer space, and given enough time, perhaps he would've even done it.  But then he and Pepper had gotten into a big fight, and she'd made a passing comment about his problems with intimacy, and suddenly, it'd become a thing, and he'd been driving home an hour later, still fuming.  He’d thought he’d been doing rather well actually.  He had Pepper.  And Rhodey.  And he couldn’t forget Happy.  That was three right there.  Three was more than luck or coincidence.
Tony had a hard time believing that Steve had been carrying around some secret torch for him, no matter how wistful his thoughts had been.  Nevertheless, for some reason he couldn’t put it entirely out of his mind.
Steve wasn’t sure he understood everything Nick and Tony were telling him about the Tesseract, but he did understand one thing: it was a call to war.
He’d known that Stark used to manufacture weapons, of course, that both he and Howard had made their fortune off it, but reading about all the million dollar-deals Stark Industries had signed still took him aback. Seeing how much money the company lost when Stark had pulled out of weapons manufacturing, however, made his jaw drop. He’d followed link after link, wondering how Stark Industries had survived all the upheaval, and didn’t even notice when the next few articles started to focus less on Stark the business tycoon and more on Stark the man. Before he knew it, almost two hours had passed, and he knew much more about Stark’s professional and personal life than he would’ve ever thought he cared to find out.
“Hmm, getting started without me?” Tony asked, the huskiness of his voice moving things low in Steve’s gut, and he realized with humiliation that not only had he woken Tony with all his bouncing on the mattress, but he was standing at an angle that let Tony clearly see the outline of his erection, even in the dark.
And Steve knows that Tony’s made a lot of effort to think up this scenario and set everything up, and Steve appreciates it more than he can say, wants to know what sort of things Tony would’ve done and what kind of questions he would’ve asked and exactly just how intrusive he would’ve gotten, but he can’t wait anymore.
“Oh, you must be hungry!” Tony said, extricating himself, and he ignored how empty his arms felt now that they weren’t holding Steve anymore. “Let’s see what’s in the kitchen.”
He still went on missions, and he made an effort to meet up with Sam and Bucky as much as he could, the other Avengers as well when they were nearby. He even reached out to Peter Parker, but while Peter was polite, he wasn’t interested in establishing a relationship with Steve, and Steve didn’t try to push. He understood Happy was stepping into Tony’s shoes for Peter, and he didn’t try to intrude, although he told Happy that he was available for Peter if he ever needed him.
“Do you want me to bite these delicious tits too?” Tony asked, using his nails, and Steve shuddered all over, thighs clenching together.
“Oh, Steve,” Tony said, smiling as he slid two fingers into him effortlessly.  “You can take whatever I can dish out and more.”
Hodge had been the kind of Sub who’d gone into the army thinking of personal glory and finding a higher-ranked Dom who’d take care of him.
The two at Steve’s thighs get to stay, since they’d been relatively respectful, but he assigns the three others to making sure Steve doesn’t drown. Sure, Steve apparently likes suckers on his nipples, but they hadn’t known that at the time. He replaces two of them with the ones who’d actually been doing what they were supposed to before, one tentacle per nipple to avoid fights. They immediately find their targets, and Steve jerks, his fingers digging into Tony, his hips doing something absolutely captivating as Tony’s tentacles taste and pull on his tender skin.
That’s why he’s cancelled their appointment tonight.  Rather than wait for Steve to notice he’s gotten too attached, he’s decided to end it.  Time to move on to bigger and better things.  Or if not that, then at the very least, it’s time to move on to something else.
Tony pulled his hand away with more than a little regret, especially when Steve groaned in disappointment and started turning his head towards him. Tony stopped him by squeezing down with the hand on Steve’s neck and saying, ”Don’t move.”  He liked the position Steve was in and wanted him to keep it, even if Tony wasn’t holding him in place. Maybe it’d be easier to finger him first and then rim him, but Tony hated the taste of lube. “You stay where I put you.”
He didn’t know when he’d started wanting Tony.  When he thought about it, which he did more frequently than he’d like, he couldn’t pinpoint a time or an occasion that had cemented it for him, hadn’t even realized what was happening until it’d been too late.  Maybe if he had, he could’ve guarded against it, spent less time with Tony, protected his heart better, done
He heard a hollow, popping sound and grunted at the subsequent impact, hard lines wrapping around him in mid-air, squeezing tight. It took much longer than it should have to understand that Tony had netted him, even longer to realize that he was going to fall to the ground and there was nothing he could do about it—
He tried not to get his hopes up just because Tony had let him nap in his bed. It’d obviously made more sense to leave him there than take him all the way to his own room after all, and it wasn’t as if letting him rest there was the same as inviting him to spend the night.
“Yes, a heightened interest in food and sex isn’t surprising. Your body is still adjusting to all the changes it’s been through, although I would suggest the next time you transform into a wolf, you should have—”
All right, fine, he can admit that he’s … annoyed. That Dr. Stark left him. When he’s so … when it’s obvious that Steve is … when the whole room
“No,” he says roughly, but he has to turn his head away, because he doesn’t think he can look without combusting.
The realization that he’d been wrong, that Tony was actively hurting … Steve hadn’t thought he could hate himself more, but he could. It was shocking by just how much. If he hadn’t needed to take care of Tony, he honestly didn’t know what he would’ve done, left maybe, walked away before he could add even one more transgression to the mountain of his sins, but that wasn’t an option at the moment. Tony had to come first.
how his body was reacting, he realized numbly, as the thing which had been still until that point began to move as well, slowly winding around his cock, undeterred when his cock flexed again and again at the strange sensation, until the end of it came to a rest on the head of his penis.
“Oh, well, engineering’s in my blood, so I still tinker around when I have free time. I started a small company that specializes in medical diagnostic equipment, and I’m working on a robot that could be an exam-room assistant, handing items to the doctor, testing blood samples in real-time, sterilizing tools, that kind of thing.”
He opened his mouth to say, “Hello?” but before he could get it out, he heard, “What are you doing?”
“Well, I don’t know if they’d do that either, but they’d certainly hope,” Tony said, laughing.  “Come on, Steve, you’re like a mother’s wet dream, polite, handsome, sincere.  Any girl—or guy—would be lucky to take you home to the family.”
Dr. Stark apparently has the same problem, the knuckles of his hand pressing tightly against Steve’s hole as he tries to get deeper.
It doesn’t matter how wet Steve is or how much he wants this, Tony’s so big that it requires effort for him to fit, and it feels like Steve’s lower body locks up as Tony makes a place for himself inside of him, the burn and the stretch incredible.
He closed his eyes just before he got a faceful of washcloth, too sore to dodge out of the way. “I don’t remember your aftercare being this brusque, but time does cloud memory, I suppose,” he said as he gingerly draped the cloth on his forehead.
Is it? Because all of Steve’s omega friends complain about getting their exams, about how annoying and uncomfortable they are, and not one of them has ever hinted by so much as a blush that they react the same way Steve does.
“Yes, Tony,” he said, the memory of forcing Tony to safeword because he thought Steve couldn’t still raw in his mind. He wouldn’t let that happen again.
It wasn’t hard to find a newspaper in the trash and find out the date. August 16, 1939. He’d been a kid back in 1939, a snot-nosed punk who thought the world owed him something, and he was going to go out and get it. He hadn’t even known all the shit he didn’t know and hadn’t had a single clue about what was in store for him, him
Tony,” Steve begged, his voice cracking, despairing, and Tony didn’t doubt that if he could see Steve’s face clearly, he’d find traces of tears. It made him wonder what Steve would do if he teased him for real, edged him for hours on end. Considering that temper of his, would he get angry? Or cling to Tony and weep? He’d beg, Tony knew, would beg and do it so prettily that Tony would be tempted to give in.
“Okay, I’m back,” he says after he’s plugged his microphone in again, and he focuses on killing everyone in sight.
“Keep it in mind,” Tony said and drew Steve’s head down to demand one last kiss. Had it always been this good, kissing Steve? He honestly couldn’t remember. “On your knees now, Gorgeous,” he said, his heart filled to bursting as Steve complied, automatically putting his arms behind his back.
“Hey, hey, don’t worry about it,” Tony said, startled and so relieved that he was almost giddy with it, and he didn’t need any more from Steve than that, barely knew what to do with having gotten that much from him.
He did it though, took a deep breath and then settled a little lower onto the bed, let his legs fall further open so there weren’t even shadows to offer a sliver of modesty.
Steve didn’t know if this was actually the oddest conversation he’d ever had with Tony, but it was definitely high up there in the list.
Steve hadn’t thought much about it at first. It’s a plain, silvery ring, and it sits on the fourth finger of his right hand, just a bit loose. Tony’s worn it from the first day that he’d barged into Steve’s life, bumping into him as Steve was leaving his apartment building and spilling his iced coffee over the both of them.
When her dad accepted a new job and she moved two months after they started dating, he was quiet for weeks and a long, red scar appeared down his side.  It hurt a lot  at first, pulsing red and angry, but eventually, it only bothered him when he touched it, memories of her smile and the way her lips had felt pressed against his flaring for brief seconds before fading away.
The expression on Tony’s face made it all worth it, however, pride and arousal and reverence, and Steve resolved to hold it in as long as possible.
Unfortunately, according to the clock on the wall, they’d only been in the gym for about thirty minutes, ten of which had been warming-up and another five, taping their hands, and he’d be damned if he gave up and suggested they switch to weight-lifting or the treadmill without sparring for at least a little longer.
He still didn’t understand what had caused it and had to forcibly push down the fear that Tony had been upset by his confession, that he didn’t want Steve’s love and rightly so.
Seeing how excited Steve got about the prospect of them coming over, Tony realized Steve had to be pretty lonely. As far as Tony knew, Steve hadn’t made many friends in New York before, and he’d left everyone he’d been getting to know for the past year in DC. The only support network he really had was Tony, and that was just depressing.
“What?  Yeah, no, it’s fine.  I just . . . migraines,” he said, because that was easier to say than explaining that he got headaches sometimes that came and went for no reason, sometimes weak, sometimes strong enough to knock him out, and they refused to respond to any drug, even the prescription-strength ones Doc had given him.
Steve nods, because what else can he do, but he isn’t, he isn’t ready for Dr. Stark to place the first two fingers of each hand below both of Steve’s nipples and his thumbs above them and to start squeezing and massaging. Even with the warning Dr. Stark had given him, he isn’t prepared for the shock, or for the pleasure, a line of heat connecting Steve’s nipples to his ass, which clenches with each press and pull.
After their conversation on milking, Steve hadn’t been sure what to expect afterwards, so he kept his eyes down, blinking back the last of his tears as he fixed Tony’s clothes with shaky fingers, incredibly aware of the burn in his throat and the throbbing in his lips.
Tony still hadn’t told him what to do with his hands.  And if he hadn’t, didn’t that mean Steve could do whatever he wanted with them? Especially if all he’d be doing was more of what Tony had asked for in the first place?
“Oh, yes, of course,” she said, blushing. “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to get carried away. I just wanted to tell you how grateful we are that you—that all of you—were here to save us.”
“Are you okay?” Steve asked as a sudden flare of pain made Tony wince, his hand going to his temple.  Looked like today wasn’t his lucky day after all.
“That’s what Mommy said,” she told him and then wanted to read together, and he shoved the memories down.
by him, as a way to get off, as a place to put his come, has Steve groaning and clenching around Tony’s cock again and again, as if desperate to show him how good he could be if Tony would only give him the chance.
Well, at least he doesn’t need to come anymore, Steve thinks distantly, which isn’t exactly a silver lining, but he’s no longer in danger of poisoning the room further with his stench—
to work. He’d stepped down as CEO of Stark Industries after all, and Stark had more money already than he could spend in multiple lifetimes.
“As for bathroom breaks, I’ll give you time to yourself in the bathroom every morning. There are enema kits in there, and I advise you to use one, because once the mittens go on, they don’t come off until it’s time to go to bed. That means if you have to go later in the day, I’ll be going into the bathroom with you and handling any cleanup.”
“I wasn’t really finished, though,” Tony said, but he let Steve draw him from his seat and didn’t object when Steve started walking towards the door. Tony had already drained and tossed the water bottle, and he felt confident JARVIS would shut everything down once they’d left.
Tony asked him if some movie was alright, and Steve agreed without even hearing the name. He didn’t care what they were going to see. All he cared about was getting his hands on Tony.
“That sounds good, thank you.” He looked down and then back, took one step away and then stopped. “Just . . . before you go . . . Tony, I—” He let out a huff of air and took off his cowl. This was something that was better done without any masks on his face.
close; Steve had made sure of it. He couldn’t show just how happy he was that Tony was back, not without confusing nearly everyone in the room, Tony included, and that wasn’t how he wanted to confess. Hell, he didn’t know if he was going to ever admit how he felt. It’d been easy to have feelings for a dead man. But now that Tony was alive ….
“I just … I didn’t feel like I could tell you that night, because I didn’t deserve to, not after hurting you so much. I know I still don’t,” he said, and Tony shook his head, wanting to tell  him he was wrong, but speaking was beyond him. “But I can’t keep saying nothing.”
Which was part of the problem, because Steve wanted to reciprocate—very much so, as a matter of fact—but now it felt there was even more pressure for that to happen, even if it was all in his own head. He wanted to do it—he wanted to
But then, Tony knew what about the effects of the serum; knew what Steve needed and always tried to give it to him, even when Steve hadn’t done enough to earn it.
He realizes Dr. Stark is waiting for his permission, so he nods hastily, trying to relax, and then Dr. Stark begins rolling up the cloth, higher and higher, past the tops of Steve’s thighs and his testicles, which are drawn up tight against his body. He finally sets it down across Steve’s lower abdomen, and it covers the upper half of his cock, which flexes at the proximity of Dr. Stark’s hands, completely without his permission. Steve’s gaze flicks to Dr. Stark’s face right in time to see the tip of his tongue wet his lips.
Now, Tony got his share of appreciative looks all the time, and he liked nothing more than to flirt a little to break up the tedium of the day, but there was something about this guy that was making him tense up and not in the good way; something . . .
“Alright, well let me know,” he says, his voice breathier than it should be, and then slips into the bathroom, almost closing the door on his foot in his daze.
that,” Steve said, desperately trying not to think about how it’d felt to almost literally hang off of Tony’s cock. He’d never experienced anything like it, not even close, but he didn’t think he could handle getting hard again, and he knew that if he let himself, he would.
But while two looks might be a coincidence, three was a pattern, and there had been that first training session . . .
“What about these curtains?” he asked grimly, wondering what Tony would say about them, too thin, too thick, too frilly, they didn’t fall aesthetically enough, what, what could possibly be wrong about them?
He didn’t regret his decision, although he did miss not being able to discuss things with Dr. Saunders anymore. She hadn’t been happy with his decision when he’d called to tell her he was moving, and she’d counseled against it, but his mind had been made up. He had to be in New York. There wasn’t another way.
He wonders sometimes what it is about Steve that attracts him so much.  He’s not exactly Tony’s usual type after all.  He’s a good man, but Tony’s met a lot—well, he’s met good men before.  He’s handsome, but Tony’s slept with models and movie stars, and they’ve never moved him the way Steve does.
And Tony can’t disagree. “My soulmate,” he whispers back, and he’s not actually sure what that means, but it’s a promise anyway.
And Steve hadn’t known, and even if Tony had bothered to tell him, it wouldn’t have mattered. Steve had been dead set on hightailing it out of there, and he hadn’t thought twice about leaving Tony behind.
Tony could’ve entered the Guinness Book of World Records under the Longest Amount of Time Taken to Make a Sandwich if that had been an entry as he waited for Steve to think something else at him.  But there was nothing.
“Ah, you’re asking about the rules,” he said, knowing that Steve wasn’t but refusing to give him the satisfaction of being the one to give voice to what he was really referring to. He smiled, although it was more a baring of teeth.
“Bucky…” he says warningly, but Bucky’s never been the type to take warnings well, and Steve knows it. “How do you know Tony’s bi?”
Steve,” Tony says, and he doesn’t look up, but Steve can see the smile from where he’s standing, and oh no.
“Does that mean you don’t mind?” He closed his eyes. He hadn’t actually planned on asking, hadn’t wanted to put any additional pressure on Tony after telling him they were being forced to have sex, but the words had escaped anyway.
Steve shuddered, moaning as one of Tony’s hands started stroking Steve’s cock, the other hand resting gently on his abdomen.  It had surprised him how much he enjoyed this the first time they’d done it, the pleasure so intense that it was almost painful, the shame lost in the sensations that Tony elicited from him.  Now, though, he looked forward to their sessions as much if not more than Tony, even if a part of him still wished he could give Tony what he really wanted.
He tries to calm himself as Dr. Stark listens to his heartbeat and lungs, but any progress he makes goes immediately out the window as soon as Dr. Stark tells him to lie down.
And when he got it, when Tony opened his eyes and gasped for breath, he could barely react at all, relief so deep and heavy that it was all he could do to keep himself upright.
Tony was handling it just fine after all.  He wasn’t suffering: no headaches, no barrages of painful and disorienting thoughts.  It was just like any other day.  Except that when he was within two feet of someone, he could hear everything he or she was thinking.  Same old, same old, really.
Well.  That at least explains why he asked Tony to marry him, Steve thinks, flushing so hotly that his face feels like it’s going to explode.
“Well, sure, what’s not to like?” Tony said, winking and spreading his arms. “But you should still go into work.”
This might be all he ever had, he thought, and squeezed his eyes tight, tugging Steve in even closer.
Steve didn’t hesitate, just nodded, knowing immediately how that would look but more than willing if that was what Tony wanted. It was the first time he’d been this close to Tony since this morning, so he couldn’t stop himself from glancing at Tony’s eyes as he moved into position, looking for any sign of softening or approval, for any of the reassurances that Tony had given him so freely before.
Tony almost never takes off his ring, not to do dishes, or work in his lab, or shower, or make love to Steve. He fiddles with it throughout the day, twirling it absentmindedly around his finger, and Steve’s caught him staring at it more than once, his thoughts obviously far away.
Tony had told Steve to try not to come. He hadn’t forbidden it, but he’d asked Steve to resist for as long as he could, and Steve, being the sweet, obedient boy that he was, had said he would do his best.
Steve hadn’t realized how significant it was that Stark was always around, but discovering that people were willing to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to have an hour of Stark’s time
At least with cat-Tony, Steve doesn’t have to worry about not touching him, and he doesn’t know who enjoys their petting sessions more.  It’s just really relaxing stroking Tony.  He’s soft and affectionate, and Steve kind of wants to keep him, although obviously, he wants regular Tony back more.
He listened to Tony’s gentle, “Hey, it’s okay,” in response and wondered how many more times Tony would say that before he came to the inevitable conclusion it wasn’t anymore.
“No,” Steve said, his voice low, and he had to look away, even though it wasn’t a lie. Stark hadn’t said anything wrong; it wasn’t his fault the way Steve was reacting to it.
Even when Morgan asked him one day, “Uncle Steve, when is daddy coming back?” and he stumbled through an answer that left her solemn and him hollow.
“You have to be so quiet then,” Tony said, lowering his voice to a whisper, until Steve could just hear him over the mechanical hum. “So still. Can you do that for me, baby?” he asked as the vibrations went up another notch.
Tony whined again, nuzzling into him and almost knocking him over in surprise, and Steve let out a huff of laughter. When Tony started licking his face over-enthusiastically, it turned into a real laugh.
For one incredibly long and frustrated second, Steve struggles to catch his breath and nearly demands Dr. Stark come back and finish what he’d started. But then reality comes crashing down on him.
“Well that’s no surprise considering how long it’s been since you’ve eaten,” Steve said disapprovingly, but he gave Tony the sandwiches and water.
Except Tony’s lips pull down at the corner, his expression losing some quality that Steve can’t define, and even though he says, “Oh. Yeah. Of course, I didn’t mean to keep you so long,” Steve knows he can’t leave it like this. Tony thinks he’s making up an excuse to finish their date early, completely out of the blue, and there’s a huge part of Steve that’s howling in protest.
There’s a long enough pause that Tony starts to wonder if he’d been wrong, if Steve really is going to deny him.  If so, he decides, he’s never going to try the whole honesty as a means of persuasion thing again.
He’d wanted to talk, to say something that’d bring a smile to Tony’s face and erase the strain, to sit close to him and take pride in his place at Tony’s side. But he couldn’t pretend everything was back to the way things had been before—didn’t want to go back to the days when Tony thought Steve was with him only until he could find someone to be
He kept his eyes open the whole time, gritting his teeth when orgasm finally hit, and he watched the evidence of his loneliness flush away.
Also, I came to realization that I played myself. I shot myself in the fucking foot, because I thought, angst, more angst, last bit of angst, and then resolution, and then it’s over, right? Maybe some porny epilogues, but that’s it. BUT I FORGOT ABOUT THE HEALING. I FORGOT ABOUT HOW LONG THE HEALING PROCESS IS. WE’RE NOT EVEN CLOSE TO BEING FINISHED YET BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN RESOLUTION, WHY, WHY????? FML. FMLLLLLLLLLL.
He blinked once slowly and then again, realizing Steve was waiting on some kind of response, something Tony couldn’t give him since he hadn’t heard most of what Steve had said.
Captain America’s mouth tightened, but all he said was an unenthusiastic, “Hello,” and damn it, why couldn’t he be perky?  Tony could deal with perky.
“I don’t know that I’d call it a bad thing myself,” Tony said, undoing a couple of buttons of his shirt but keeping the arc reactor hidden.  He walked forward the few steps separating them, pleased when Captain America turned towards him.  Tony kept his eyes on him as he reached out, slowly enough so that his intentions were clear.  He could see Captain America’s Adam’s apple bob as he swallowed, but he didn’t try to stop him as Tony rested his hand lightly on his cock.  “Not bad at all.  What’s your name, soldier?” he asked even though he already knew it.  Still, while he wouldn’t mind saying “Captain America” in the middle of sex, maybe for their first time—first of many if he had anything to say about it—they should stick with the tried and true.
He listened, though, to the accusing drag of Tony’s feet and the heavy slap of his hand against the bannister, and he was ready to throw himself backwards down the stairs if he needed to catch Tony.
He’d been ready a lot earlier than that, truth be told, but by 7:59am, he was standing with his forehead against his door, his hand inches away from the handle.
Of course he has a date! Steve berates himself as he respawns. He has absolutely no clue what Tony looks like–although he thinks about it a lot, when he remembers something funny Tony had said earlier that day, when he’s alone and lonely–but Tony’s sly and charming and hilarious, and even if he’s not that attractive (although a person doesn’t have to be movie-star gorgeous to be attractive, Steve knows, and what does beauty matter anyway in comparison to what’s inside?), he’s still bound to have people who want to be with him.
to—go back to the Compound and look for you.  I find myself looking to the south throughout the day, searching the skies for red and gold.  The number of times I’ve considered abandoning the others . . .
He … had to have heard Steve get on the table and the rustle of the sheet. After all, it’s not like he’s outside the room and waiting some predetermined time before knocking to check if Steve’s ready. Of course he’d turn his head at all the noise.
“Oh,” Steve says because sure, he’d been a little concerned about someone other than Dr. Edwards examining him, but that had been before he realized who’d be taking his place. And while it’s true that Steve’s on edge for many, many reasons, they all have to do with the state of his crotch, and he can’t imagine what Dr. Stark has in mind. He’s kind of backed himself into a corner, though, so he just smiles weakly and thanks him.
Funny enough, they had rarely argued when it was just the two of them, but here they were, acting like they were seconds away from going at each other’s throats. But there was something about having an audience—about having to play a
Instead of hitting the button that would take him back home, he let his arm drop, and he leaned against the side of the building, his legs unsteady.
“Fuck, it’s bright,” Tony said, lowering his sunglasses just enough to squint at the window. “After a night like that, I’m in the mood for cinnamon rolls. JARVIS, order me some from that place that I like.”
