“I’ve never been one for doing what I should,” Steve mumbled under his breath. Tony either didn’t hear or pretended not to. Instead he walked towards the penthouse, his scent wafting passed Steve, the twist of soured distress returning, horribly, under the citrusy smells. Steve had put that there, in a way. Though he knew it had more to do with Stane, more to do with this hell of a situation he yearned to break Tony free of. When he reached the door to the penthouse, Tony looked back at him from over his shoulder. “Chess?” he asked with a wane smile.
Reaching down, Peter heard his Pops voice and somebody else's voice. "Is that..Harley?!" Peter exclaimed and Tony laughed and nodded, Peter sprinting towards the kitchen. As he guessed, there sat his Pops and his dear elder brother talking to each other with a plate of mac and cheese in front. "Har!" Peter ran and Harley sat up from his seat and embraced him in a tight embrace. "Pete! How are ya little guy?" Harley greeted him while ruffling his hair, Peter squaked and batted his hands away and pulled a chair beside Harley and started digging into his mac and cheese. Soon enough, the family of four where chatting and exchanging stories with each other. Later, the family when to Natasha and Bucky's baby shower. "Hey, babe...can we stop at Scar's grave?" Tony asked and Steve smiled fondly "Sure". The boys at the back then leaned forward "Who is Scar?" Peter asked "It's auntie Tasha for you and she...she was my best friend, since
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve suddenly realized as he was watching Tony present something in front of the class. His olive skin was bathed in the early morning sun ray blinding through the class window. His eyes, those warm chocolate eyes lighting up with wonder and excitement as he gestured wildly to the class, his posture tall but not intimidating and his hair a fluffy mob of brown curls, reaching all the way to the nape of his neck. He was wearing a red band t-shirt, a black leather jacket draped on top of it and a black skin tight jeans which hugged his legs and his ass perfectly. He was trying to grow a goatee as he could see traces of course hair on around his mouth.
. Steve stood up from his seat and swooped Tony into a long kiss that left both of them breathless while Bucky walked over to Tasha and planted a light kiss on her cheek careful not to mess up her makeup. The duo then said their goodbyes and walked out of the compound driving off in Tony's Audi Spyder R8.
" JARVIS’s cool voice smoothly flowed from the ceiling. Tony choked back his tears when he heard Jarvis’s voice after five years. Not that FRIDAY is a bad AI but nothing can compare to the attitude and sass like JARVIS. “It’s good to be back, J” Tony said while still clearing the cobwebs. "
After the incident, Steve continued to ignore Tony's calls and Scar's invitations. Bucky kept asking him what was the problem but he shook his head and said it was a 'family issue'. He started hanging out with other people in his class, he started talking to Peggy, Sam, Nat and Clint. After a few cajoling, the trio didn't approach him anymore, getting the message clear as crystal. Sometimes, Steve would see those three all but laughing as they walked towards the cafeteria and wished he could be there with them but he always remembered that it was him that created the distance between them. Summer school came and went, and Steve's growth spurt finally hitting him. Growing to a full 6'2 and building up muscles, coming back to school was fun. People started to notice him, wanted to be his friends, all but Tony and Scar. He often see the duo together at the library, deep in their studies and often moved to speak to them but chicken out at the end. Steve missed Tony, missed him like a limb but there wasn't anything he could do since it was all his fault. 'Steggy' was the ship name the whole school used when Peggy and Steve got together. They were like almost the power couple of the school, Peggy being the head of the cheerleader and Steve being the captain of the football team in their school. Whenever Steve would wait for Peggy at their locker, he would sometimes get a glimpse of Tony searching through his locker, snapping his fingers when he found the object he was looking for, shut the door and lock eyes with Steve and immediately walk off without a smile. Steve sighed and hung his head, keeping his sobs to himself. Yes, he loved Peggy, but seeing the way Tony scrambling away from him really stabs a knife into his heart since the genius still has a little place in his heart.
Steve slowly opened his eyes and blinked a couple of times to adjust himself to blinding flourescent light. He wetted his lips a few times and gulped his saliva a few times before "T..Tony?" he crocked. Bruce who was sitting at a far corner reading with his Starkpad, looked up and walked over to the bed. "Hey, Steve." Bruce greeted. Steve looked up and smiled "Hey, Bruce, where's Tony?" "He is at Morristown Medical Centre." Steve instantly shot up from his bed but another wave of nausea hit him like a wall "Easy..You're just recovering from nausea" "But, Tony-" "The doctors are looking after him, he's still in surgery, once you get back to your feet, we can go see him" 'But I'm okay" Steve said while standing up only to hit the bed again. "I think from now on, let me be the judge of that. You have to rest Steve, once you are deemed alright, we can go and visit Tony" Where's Bucky?" at that Bruce's face sobered "He..he and Nat broke up." "Jesus, how?" "Bucky told about Yele- Tasha and Nat got mad that he lied...and she..left" "Can..can you call Bucky?" Bruce smiled fondly and swept a stray piece of hair from his forehead and nodded. Bruce checked his vitals one more time before exiting the room. After a few minutes, Bucky entered, his condition far worse than him. His eyes red rimmed, his hear a mess of tangles and his posture of submission all felt wrong to Steve's eyes. Bucky sat on the chair Bruce sat and finally looked up at Steve "Well, you look like shit" Steve teased but Bucky only smiled at it "Oh Bucky..." "I messed up Stevie..I just ruined the best thing that happened in my life.." "Buck, can I ask you a question?" "Yeah..sure" "Could you, if possible, still have feelings for..Tasha?" Steve asked slowly. Bucky stared at the bed linen picking at the stray piece of wool sticking out. "Buck...?" "Yeah..maybe..I dunno..it's..it's complicated" "I think you still do, if not you won't hang onto the last piece of her to get her back" Bucky sighed and nodded "Yeah..it's just the love I had for Tasha is completely different to the love I had for Nat." "In...which way?" "Its..I loved Nat not only for her beauty but of who she is in the inside, she is fearless, compassionate, caring and..she really took care of me...but not like Tasha.." Steve nodded in understanding "Tasha knew me inside and out, she knew my strength and my weaknesses, my good days and my bad days, what triggers me and what doesn't, she was my sanity back in the facility..no matter how many times they wiped my memory, she was constant, whenever they released me from the Dark Room, although I don't remember, my heart does and without thinking, I'll be there and she'll be there for me.." "Then why Nat?" Bucky huffed in a bitter laughter "Losing her was like losing a part of me...I was so lost and Nat was the one who came close enough to Tasha, I was happy, or atleast that's what I say to myself, but every time we get intimate, it's like...I'm not clean enough, too many secrets and...most of my heart still belonged to Tasha.." "So..you guys never had.." "Sex? Nope. I never felt comfortable...and then when things were going smoothly, she comes back. Tasha comes back and my stupid heart just holds..just holds onto that last piece of hope that I'll get her back...so, I didn't want to hurt Nat..so.." Bucky flailed his hands as if it explained the rest of his words. Steve exhaled and swung an arm around Bucky's shoulder "You know..for all the talk that you and Tony are not the same person, you guys have someone common" Bucky lightly smiled "Yeah..that's her, that's Tasha, she influence people in her life, whether she knows it or not" Bucky then suddenly turned to Steve sharply and stared hard at Steve "Tell me. Tell me going after Tasha is the right thing. Tell me breaking my relationship with Nat is a good choice." Steve pondered for a while "Buck, you said yourself, if Tasha is the one you're most comfortable with then go for it, but. Talk. Talk to Nat. Explain why and get in good terms, the more you let your breakup stew, the more she'll resent Tasha and..it won't be pretty" Bucky sighed in relief and slumped against Steve "Yeah...Tasha makes me...well, me". Just then, the door swung open and Bruce poked his head inside "Surgery successful, we can go see Tony."

The rest of the day goes by with Ahana finishing her tasks with the wolf on her lap and it's the end of the day. Ahana is contemplating on how to transport the wolf when her phone rings and it's her husband. "Hey, babe you done?" Bucky answers and Ahana smiles "Hey, yeah I'm done, but, babe I need your help" "You okay?" "I'm fine, I just need your help, can't say it on the phone, can you drop by o your way here?" "Uhh, I still have a few mission reports but, yeah, sure I'll be there in five?" "Yeah, sounds great, thanks" "I love you" "Love you more" she says and hangs up. Ahana is scrolling through her Instagram when the wolf starts whining and tossing in it's sleep. She immediately puts her phone down and gently places her hand on top of the wolf's head, stroking it's fur "Hey, baby boy, it's okay, your fine, your safe, it's okay" she whispers and after sometime the wolf slowly goes back to sleep. Another five minutes and the door to her office opens and her husband pokes his head into the room. "Hey, babe" he greets before coming near her and freezes at the wolf in her lap "What is that?!" he whisper-shouts, pointing at the wolf "A wolf" Ahana deadpans and Bucky rolls his eyes. "I know, but what's it doing here?" he asks and she beckons him to her side, slowly. Bucky tip toes and gingerly sits beside "I don't know where he came from, cause I found it this morning under my desk, like this." she points at the blood "caked in blood and whining. He's leg was bent so I called Bruce and he came took a look at it and cast it" she says pointing at the cast "and he said that it'll take atleast a week or two for it to heal, and I can't keep it here, so I thought about bringing it to the compound?" she finishes that sentence with a question and looks at her husband. Bucky looks at the wolf and then looks at her "Who's gonna take care of it?" "I'll do it. I found him and he isn't close to anyone else, plus if the pap knows, the next we want is pet control and this big guy in a cage" "Your work?" "I'll just work from home, babe, don't worry, I'll do it, plus" she adds mischievously "I think it'll be a great practice when we have our own kids, hm?" she says and Bucky chuckles and pecks her on the lips "Other's will get a dog, but only you, babe, will get a wolf" he says teasingly and Ahana chuckles "I'm a Stark, what do you expect?", they both laugh.
Enjoy!
” “Resulting in several suicide bombers, Pepper and the President…but what has it got to do with HYDRA?” “
By the time the recess bell rang, Tony's class had a Bucky, Natasha, Clint, Sam, Peggy, Thor, Jane, Darcy, Loki, Pietro and Wanda. He also got to know his other subject teachers, Mr. Phil Coulson, his language art teacher, Ms. Giovanni, his arts teacher, Mr.Erik, his technology teacher, Mr. Mark, his reading and writing teacher and of course Principal Fury. Tony and Scarlett rushed out of their class as soon as the bell rang and took the front most seat at the cafeteria. They were both munching the lunches their parents packed when a small voice interrupted them "Uhm, excuse me, is this table taken?" and Tony looked up and met Steve's eyes "Yeah, sure and he slid closer to Scarlett and allowed Steve to sit beside him. Then, pretty soon their table was full of their classmates- excluding Loki and the twins -chatting with each other. "So, how you guys met each other?" Darcy asked them once she swallowed her food. "We are neighbors, went to the same nursery and preschool." Tony answered "Exactly like me and Buck!" Steve answered "We were friends since we were in diapers!" Steve laughed as Bucky grumbled into himself. Tony got to know that Natasha and Clint are also childhood friends since they were at the same foster home since birth and Jane admitted that she knows no one from the class and is fairly new, same as Darcy and Bruce. Thor and Loki are step brothers and Pietro and Wanda are twins and the four met at a function during last year's Christmas.
The whole room was dead silence before both Tasha and Tony shrieked and ran to their partners, jumping into their arms and kissing them senseless. "Yes" Tasha whispered into Bucky's lips. "Yes, you big sap" Tony rasped to Steve and peppered his face with light kisses. The rest of the team celebrated in joy, jumping up and down, throwing their wishes at the newly engaged couple. And if FRIDAY took a picture, of the two couples staring at each other with love and adoration, no one has to know.
Her breathing became labored again, hitching and cracking at the end and her whole body started shaking. Her vision clouding again and faces of the doctors resurfaced back. The voice laced back into her mind. Tony and Bucky were no longer by her side and the pain shot through her again. The whirring of the machine came back, her mind muffled again. The boy and the man disappeared and it became blank, the pieces that came back dusted off again, Tasha's knees buckled and she fell to the ground, her eyes in tears.

In addition, we have used chemical vapor deposition to grow a hard carbon material known as ultrananocrystalline diamond on nanostructured surfaces. This is also for use in medical devices. We are examining the processing of many types of medical devices, including microneedles, both for drug delivery and for biosensing." Tony ended his speech with a dramatic bow and joined Tasha in the backstage. "You did great! Oh god, Tony, you were awesome out there!" "Nah, you're awesome too" Tony replied back with a shy smile. The duo later exited the building and joined their family for their celebratory dinner at their favorite diner a few blocks away from the compound. Tasha looked up from her cheeseburger and fondly smiled at the domestic scenery in front of her, Bucky then laced his fingers with her, and tugged her into a long kiss, cheese and oil and all.

Steve stood at the archway of the door that led him into their shared bedroom, eyes red rimmed for the very last time as he looked at the scene in front of him. All their friends were gathered around Tony's thin body surrounded by tubes and wires, giving their final speech. They hushed against each other and slowly one by one exited their room, patting Steve on his shoulder on their way out. Once the last of them went out, Steve entered and sat beside his husband, immediately pulling him to his side. Tony sighed in relieve and rested his cheeks against his shoulder "Don't be sad once I'm gone, don't be angry once I'm gone, look after Peter and Harley for me once I'm gone..." Tony kept talking to him, promising him to do everything that they did, without him and Steve just nodded with tears streaming down his cheeks when Harley and Peter entered the room, their eyes red rimmed too. "Hey, boys...c'mere..." Tony beckoned them with a weak voice and the boys sat near his body "Take care of your Pops for me, will ya?" the boys smiled through their tears and nodded. After a few minutes, Tony started yawning and Steve knew that this is the last of him, he tightened his grip around Tony and Tony snuggled closer.
". Tony slowly came to consciousness "All right, all right, shut the alarm, J, I'm up. It's hurting my eardrums" The suit's thrusters immediately shut off and Tony was plunging fast and deep. Hitting the ground with a loud thud, Tony groaned in pain and blinked his eyes to force his brain to come online. "J, open up the suit" the suit opened up and Tony immediately sat up only to encounter, silence. "Uhh, J, where are we? Not near New York I'm guessing" "

At Stark Towers, Steve made his way through the rubble with a heavy heart. The other Avengers came down and helped him look for Tony. Bucky walked by his side and placed his arms on his shoulder in an attempt to give some comfort. After a few hours, there was no sign of Tony's body or of his armor and Steve sat down on a piece of stray rubble and curled into himself with tears flowing down his cheeks.
" Clint says in the comms and Bucky smirks. As quick as he can he uses his metal arm and bats the gun away and grabs the back of Yelena's neck, slams her into the wall and points his gun into the small of her back, pressing himself against her. "Tell this to whoever sent you here, you wanna show who's the boss, you come after me. You touch my wife, and the next thing he's gonna get are crates full of HYDRA cadavers with a bow tied to it.

she mouths at him and chuckles at his spluttering, continues walking back to her table and clearing it when she hears a throat clearing at the back of her. Zipping her back, she turns to see the same barista, looking at her with a sheepish smile "I'm so sorry, Mrs Stark-" "It's Mrs. Barnes, actually" Ahana corrects and the barista chuckles awkwardly "I'm so sorry, Mrs. Barnes, I really didn't know that you are married I'm so sorr-" "Kid, it's okay. It happens quite alot, so no harm done" Ahana soothes him before grabbing her working bag and her handbag "I'm already late, but it's nice to meet you..." "Zane" "Zane. It's nice to meet you, bye!" Ahana greets before hurrying her way to her car.
Tony looked at him with impossibly wide eyes, wet with fear. “Go!” he hissed. “Go!”
“--Stane thinks, at least. Whether the move to expand SI’s trade partners beyond our traditional allies is patriotic or not, it isn’t something I imagine is debated in the top floors of Stark Tower much.”
Then–Red.
Steve let out a shaky breath and let himself ease in Tony’s hold. His hands were smaller than Steve’s but managed to be everywhere at once along his stomach. Steve wanted them to wander higher, or lower, or wherever Tony wanted to touch, he just didn’t want him to stop. In the small confines of their capsule they were pressed so close together there was actually room on either side. But it still didn’t seem close enough. “Don’t stop,” Steve replied.
“So you say,” Steve replied before sliding onto the broom in front of Tony. "First few rides we'll do in tandem. Now, up!” he shouted, before Tony really had a grip on what was happening. The ground under him slipped away as they hovered, just an inch, over the ground.

“Then you’ll believe me when I say it’s been awhile and I’m more than capable of coming all over your abs right now if you do that thing again with your stomach.”
Tony’s hand had gripped around the screen, his blood rushing south as his morning hard-on came roaring back to life. Just like he knew Steve expected it would.
he shouted. Nothing happened and the man wearing Tony’s own face narrowed Tony’s own eyes.
Next Wednesday came by slowly after that. He was sent on a weekend warrior mission into the jungle, a simple drop and grab of alien technology that somehow got into the wrong person's hands. Steve barely got a scratch on him, which was good because the entire time he was in uniform he stressed about what he was going to tell Tony. About Captain America, about the suppressants, about what he thought about sometimes late at night but knew he had no right to say.
Steve knew something was wrong the moment he entered the tower. For one, no one replied to his secret knock. After repeating it for the third time, he switched to normal knocking, which was finally answered by a harangued-looking sous chef Steve had never seen before. The mask affixed to Steve's face bore a new identity than the last time he’d come, which was the usual course of events, along with the secret knock and his well-known accomplices. None of the faces in the kitchen looked familiar.
Bucky’s bare waist, standing on his toes so his chin could hook over Bucky’s shoulder.
Tony chuckled under his breath, and Steve flushed but challenge still sparked in his gaze. “I wasn’t the only one who walked by the door, was I?”
Tony stepped back enough to meet his eye and smiled, small and a little worried. “Not good?”
When he caught his breath, the first thing he did was look for Tony.
Steve quirked a smile, stepping towards the couch. Steve watched for any sign of Tony tensing or flinching back from his scent or closeness, but neither happened. Tony looked thoroughly exhausted, strips of bandages wrapping along his back, tan skin tinged with bruising dotted throughout. Steve wanted to touch him, almost reaching out to, but then he realized Tony’s back wasn’t moving up and down in a steady rhythm. He was holding his breath. Steve stepped back, towards the door. “Sure,” he replied, unable to keep the soft affection from his tone and not really wanting to. “I’ll bring you all the cheeseburgers.”
Card 3137
Tony moved immediately, his hand rougher than Steve had expected, larger too and absolutely perfect as it made a few slow strokes up and down Steve’s cock. Tony caught his eye, and Steve kept their gazes locked until he closed his palm perfectly around the tip of Steve’s cock and he had to close his eyes from the pleasure.
“A. Car.”
“Min Yoongi.”
Steve swore and twisted the metal still clenched in his fist. “Because of me.”
Before he even finished aiming it at Tony, Steve was in the line of fire.
“We appreciate your assistance with this,” Namjoon said in fluent English. Next to him a man with a hat with the letters J-Hope on it beamed a sunshine smile at them, and added, “We are honored to meet you.”
The day passed in tedium, again. Steve spent countless hours watching the universe out the window. The quiet turned from tense to calm somewhere after their afternoon meal but by dinner, Steve was back to fretting.
The meeting started to come to a close, and there were no more messages, no more vibrations, just his work day and the fading fantasies Steve’s photo had elicited.
They reached the small dormitory made for one and stopped at the edge of the capsule. It was round with a mattress on the bottom, crisp linen sheets and a single pillow, large enough that one person could comfortably sleep in it, even sit up. But with two people... “This is where you say, ‘looks better than wartime conditions’ with a comforting smile.”
“For Obadiah.”
“Ready to learn how to fly?” Steve asked.
Steve didn’t like violence for violence sake but it was that thought that finally lulled him to sleep.
. Would they retract or--?
Maybe now Tony wouldn’t notice that the package he'd asked him to courier the day before still sat on the coffee table and Happy had his feet up, eating Clint's cinnamon buns instead of delivering it.
Tony locked the suit in its dock and it hissed as the pressurized metal released. A technician pulled his helmet off. The green goo that filled the armour stuck to Tony's face, sliding down his neck, but Tony ignored it, his mouth moving a mile a minute the second his face was revealed. Steve fended off memories of water sliding over his shoulders as he pushed out of the pool, the pull of his fitted suit jacket around his lean, muscular waist.. The locker room--
,” Anthony assured. “It’s gone now.”
Steve chuckled, low and fond. “Figured that out, maybe, from the dissertation you just delivered on my behalf. Which, thank you for. I do appreciate you defending my--if not my honor, then my existence?”
They gazed back over at the portal where Anthony and Steve were still standing, now looking incredibly uncomfortable while also shooting each other side long glances.
Tony pulled back, staying close but turning to look at Steve’s belongings. “I’m just trying to figure out how it even happened.”
Knowing all of this, Steve followed Tony’s pull until he was on his back, facing the curved capsule ceiling, then Tony’s face, now hanging in between him and the ceiling. Steve wanted to close his eyes again, hide from the prying and the obvious questions that painted Tony’s expression. But Steve knew a few notable facts: he was stuck in the middle of outer space with this man for months and, more importantly, the itch under his skin had blossomed into a full blown heat, fixated on the mere proximity of Tony. And the sensation only seemed to be growing. So he kept his eyes open, caught Tony’s gaze and met it dead on. “We are very close together, physically. The effect is…. surprising, and because of that I was momentarily shaken. It’s not the first time I’ve felt this way about a fellow teammate, I know how to handle it. I won’t let my...reactions interfere with our mission or team dynamics.” He nodded resolutely then curled back on his side, away from Tony.
“I’ll go. Clothes in the closet?”
“Of course I’ve thought about it.” Anthony groaned, then picked up his pace, striding ahead of Tony and leading him out a side door into a courtyard. “Have you
Tony removed the armor and slipped back into his plastic packaged sleeping clothes for the meal, and the itch under Steve’s skin sprung to life again. It was like Tony was a beacon for his attention, and Steve had no choice but to follow its call and gape at him.
“Everything okay?” Steve smirked as he accepted the drink Tony presented. “You look a little amused.” Steve’s voice had turned smooth and silky. Steve had been watching him, had been for a while now, and his gaze burned with a challenge...or was it a flirtation?
The ride over the bridge was quiet and tense. It only got worse when their cook-turned-driver asked them where they were going once they got into Brooklyn. Steve wanted to get to the hotel as soon as possible, but he didn’t want the man to know where they were heading so he led him to a cross street near the hotel.
Steve took another hit to the face then whipped his shield as hard as he could into the chitauri soldier’s gut. The alien flew across the street and into a rolled over car where both promptly lit on fire. Steve spun around to fend off the next wave, but it was all clear. Thor stood to his side, panting, but it was otherwise silent.
Steve started to thrust into the air above his hips now, spurred on by the way Tony’s neck smelled and how he tasted when Steve let his tongue run against his pulse.
“Well that's reassuring. Have I mentioned how much I like that accent on us?”
“You are. You won.”
Tony’s breath hit his neck, a gasp of something - surprise? Desire? Before Steve could think more of it, Tony’s determined hands moved up, then pulled back so that only his fingertips remained, a light tease of a touch along the edges of both his nipples. It was all Steve needed to buck in Tony’s hold, his head rolling with the ripple of pleasure onto Tony’s shoulder. Tony pinched his fingers lightly and Steve shuddered again, melted completely in Tony’s arms.
“Tony.” Steve’s heart raced at the feel of his thick cock pressing into his own pajama pants and bare stomach. It felt like hot, hard velvet, and Steve couldn’t help arching into it, adding to the pressure.
There was a beat of silence before another shout, this time by a group of people, but it seemed to originate from up in the sky, not on ground level. Before Tony could clear his mind of the confusion three people on honest to god broomsticks shot across the sky. He blinked once, twice, then reached behind his head to feel for any cracks in his skull. The broomsticks came back, this time with one rider holding a ball. He threw it out of Tony’s line of sight and there was another boom of shouting. Then a man, blond hair poking out from under his helmet, flew fast from behind them, blowing a whistle from atop a broomstick of his own.
But then there was the field. Something about the sunflowers, passing by it for miles, minute after minute, like there would never be an end in sight, it made his foot pull back from the pedal, let the van roll to a slow stop.
Even if the two of them weren’t like that. Yet.
“You’re perfect,” Steve whispered.
“So you came to me because I exist in his world too?”
There were a few people standing along the rim of the field, spectators - friends of the players, benefactors of the charity. No one would notice or care if Steve stood along the edge with them. Perfectly normal for him to keep a closer eye on his friend.
The elevator came to a stop, the doors opening to a huge open floor. On one side there were shelves with rows of paper files, and on the other side, were larger artifacts. There were several whole rooms worth of furniture, half-finished projects, and Steve was pretty sure there was a tank in the furthest end of the floor but it was so far away, and so many other objects were between him and it that it was hard to tell.
With another shout, the man hung up the phone and turned to the omega. It was like all the anger from his phone call played on his face and transferred its focus onto the omega. He grabbed his arm, jolting him away from the window so he could face him, his other hand snapping over his throat. Steve stepped forward, but before he could say anything, the man dropped his hand and pivoted towards Steve. “Can I help you?” he sneered, clearly showing what type of help he was willing to offer in the curl of his upper lip.
Steve’s stomach dropped, mind racing through all the ways Stane might have discovered their location. Breaking into a run, Steve took the stairs unable to wait for the elevator. They’d destroyed all traceable electronics right down to Tony’s watch, and even the cook that had taken them to Brooklyn hadn’t seen where they went after they’d been dropped off. The nagging reminder, like a beacon in the back of his mind, that SHIELD had the nanomask now, and here was Stane--it had to be connected.
“It connected us.”
“Wait.” Steve turned towards Tony, hand hovering near his wand. “Is that true?”
Stony + sunshine, piano, hug for saraceaser and also a bit for Mother's Day!
“Oh god, Tony--”
Steve had never seen a polo match before. When he came downstairs with a tray of refreshments, he stopped short when he saw Tony astride a horse. He was laughing at something another player had said, but everything around Tony seemed blurred to Steve.
Tony hadn’t said a word, didn’t need to say anything. When he finally stopped slack-jawed staring at Steve he began to shake his head, whether to say he wasn’t fine or to get Steve to stop talking.
“It’s hard for even a master of flirtation like me to banter after an orgasm like that, especially when you still have these toys on full blast inside me. So if you’re asking if I’d like to go to my office and have you fuck me face first over my desk, then yes. Yes, Steve, that’s exactly the type of encore these encoreless seminars usually have.”
James looked over at the ocean. “We going in?”
“What happened?” Steve whispered when Tony was close. “Only, if you want to tell me, of course. Please, maybe I can help.”
Steve crossed his arms and remembered when they were half their size, when Tony would’ve towered over him. “Maybe. A little. But that doesn’t explain all this.” Steve gestured to the camera in Tony's hands.
He stopped in his tracks, would’ve dropped his grocery bags if they weren’t clinging over his shoulder. The alpha was on the phone and had stopped as well, pacing and yelling into the speaker, bits of angry spittle catching Steve’s eye. The omega’s bond bite looked fresh and infected. There was no partner bite on the alpha’s neck.
They nodded, and Tony followed Steve into the hallway, waiting to hear the lock turn before pushing on the door to test its sturdy resistance then following the garland-lined hallway towards the source of the scream.
“Park Jimin,” Steve explained. “He’s one of the missing members. It must be a common enough occurrence for them to name it after him.”
Stuckony + chocolate, pillow, snow for betheflame
A moment of silence but finally Tony whispered, “You aren’t. You’re helping me heal.”
With every scratch of the lead across the paper, Steve remembered.
On the other side of that circle was his bedroom. Their bed was framed in the center of the circle with Steve twisted in the sheets, shirtless, just shifting out of sleep. He blinked awake, stretching, coming onto his elbows. Then it was like a flip was switched, he shuffled backwards and shouted, “Tony!”
“It’s a long day. Only noon.” The tight pressure along the base of his cock centered Tony, his whole focus now on Steve, his cock under Steve’s control. “Think you can wait? Next call ends at two and I want to see you blissed out and begging, desperate to come.
Clint pinned him with a glare. “Do it, and I’m kicking you off the sofa.”
“Anthony--” Steve cut in.
. Brown eyes fixed on his face. “You make battle look good, Cap.” Tony’s smile sharpened, a mix of something affectionate and flirtatious.
chair.”
. He may have whimpered again because Tony was spinning, brow furrowed and his eyes finally, finally lifting to meet Steve’s. They were hard, fixed and firmed, no light dancing in them any more, at least not now. Now there was steely determination, a resolution he’d made that he wasn’t going to be backing down. He looked powerful and empowered, but on the edges, in the corners of his eyes and the turn of his eyebrows there was the pain, the memory, a new sadness, a witness to things he had not seen before.
The thought followed him as he settled back behind his desk, the plug pressing into him as he sat back down, a jolt reminding him of Steve’s big hands as they wrapped around his hips. Tony took a deep breath, trying to shake the thoughts of Steve and the way he could manhandle him, as he pulled up his inbox and began answering Pepper’s latest messages.
But Steve had no idea what Tony was asking, utterly distracted by the way a series of gears twisted and unlocked to release Tony's bare arms from the armour's gauntlets. He hummed, and it was enough affirmation for Tony to continue his monologue.
The man stepped forward. “Kansas?”
“It’s a shield. Steve--my Steve--it’s his weapon of choice. Here it looks to be….”
“Someone pulled a Jimin,” the tall man with striking features teased, and the others laughed and started talking to each other in fast-paced Korean.
Tony laughed again, high pitched and happy, and figured maybe Steve had a point.
, I’ve seen you make, bang and beat into your own creation and that makes it even hotter.” He couldn’t resist pressing a kiss into the chestplate, even if he knew Tony wouldn’t feel it through the metal. “Sometimes you’re out there fighting Doom bots or alien creatures like today, and I just have to stop to marvel at how you move under it, how your body twists -” he ran a hand down the metal, gripping it’s waist “- and turns.” He clenched tight, but the armor didn’t crack or fracture. “I want you. Now. Do you want that, Tony?”
“I think I saw the cleaning crew on the fourth floor,” the woman added helpfully.
Instead, Steve tripped over his feet when he must’ve realized they passed BTS’ green room.
“It’s okay,” Tony cut him off. “You don’t have to tell me. I know some things are like, confidential, and the fact that you’re even here, and that we’re, you know,” he gestured his hand at Steve like that explained whatever he meant but Steve had no idea.
Tony narrowed his eyes at the wand that had not lowered. “Why...thank you...Professor Stark?”
The final chapter is here! It came out to be about double the size of a usual chapter so...Oops! :D
“Not a problem,” Professor Rogers said, sending him a Steve Rogers watt smile. “I’ll be right back.”
“No. Because you’re leaving!”
Steve was mumbling directions, instructions, and Tony took a step closer. He wondered what their diet was and if the shapeshifting happened amongst their own species, or maybe just around humans? He had so many--
The omega needed help, and Steve wasn’t going to keep avenues of assistance away from him, even if it meant he was overstepping.
Steve smiled. “Well, of course I am. We have the brilliant mind of not one but two Starks behind us.”
“He does his best to stay on the legal side of the line in the sand,” Rumlow replied to his phone screen.
“It’s not--You’re not the one who owes me that.” His words were harsher and harder--stronger--than Steve had hoped to hear.
Steve knocked their shoulders together as the man walked away. “Can’t let anyone gush about anyone other than you?”
There was a long pause before Tony appeared to gather all of his strength through a shaky breath and nodded. Steve draped his zip up sweater around Tony's back and let it hang loose for him to close. Then he stepped away from the cage and started to pace around the room. It was mostly empty, though Steve noticed some plates of discarded food around the edges. Probably the remains of Tony’s meals. There was a closet that Steve pulled open and immediately wished he hadn’t.
The camera flashed.
A warm weight under Steve’s arm shifted closer, back fitting against Steve’s chest and waist dragging against Steve’s hips. His body reacted, blood beginning to flow south and brain ticking to life--
Steve tried not to grip too hard, splinter the wood. There were things he needed to say, important things, that would allow Tony to understand what he was doing here, what they were doing here, how much this meant to him. “I first considered the possibility of this, of us, when you caught me admiring the cuffs that bound you to the Iron Man suitcase.”
Obadiah Stane.
His cock twitched in the ring. Would Steve leave him like this for the rest of the seminar, or would he strike at any moment? He loved to keep Tony waiting, he loved to make him work--The vibrations returned in full force again, breaking off his thoughts. It was so much, especially after the waves, building and retreating, but every time they returned, Tony was that much closer. Now they were unrelenting, and it was growing hard to keep his voice straight as he turned to his conclusion.
“We should probably do the knock and say the codeword.”
“Everyone in the Magical World knows this ring, it's one of He-Who--of Voldemort’s--it’s one of his horcruxes. The Deathly Hallows symbol is engraved across the gemstone.” The man had gone completely white and fixed Tony with an expression that spoke of fear, of horrors of days past that were routinely recalled in his mind’s eye. “Who are you?”
“We’re late,” The alpha spat over his shoulder. “This is your fault, Tony.”
Once before he had felt this urge, when Bucky had retold his Hydra ordeal to the Howling Commandos. Straps had held him down to the table, unable to move. And Steve imagined himself captive, held in that that position on the table. Helpless. He pictured Bucky leaning over him, tightening the straps. Blood had thrummed through his body then, just as it did now.
With a deep breath, he handed over the box and watched as Tony traced his hands over the wood before returning his focus to Steve. “What is it?”
Except, Tony flinched and backed away.
They were kissing.
“What?” Steve stuttered, hips jerking forward under the onslaught of stimulation. Tony pushed him back onto the seat.
“Are you sitting in the dark?” Clint wasn’t one to feel much embarrassment, but having a knife nearly stab him in the head for sneaking Nat’s desserts was almost enough to make him feel ashamed. He was definitely curious. “Are you guarding the pies? You threw a knife at me over a pastry?!”
He sat there for a long time, the half-finished sketch lying discarded in his lap.
Tony looked around the entryway of the hut. Inside, it looked like any other recreational room. There was a desk and office in the far end by the doorway Steve had walked through that presumably led to showers and a locker room. “Why doesn’t he spell himself clean?” Tony asked as he walked over to hanging sports equipment - brooms, different sized balls.
“You just said you were--” Tony shook his head and stalked over to Steve, grabbing his arm and tugging him down the ship. Steve let him, not having the fight in him to keep his feet from following in his wake. “You’re so stubborn,” Tony mumbled under his breath.
Steve took a deep breath, the citrusy smell waffling between too sour and Tony’s normal honey-sweet, but tinting with a new, heavier musk. Just the one breath made him lightheaded, and he took the invitation to stand up and look around the books as an escape. Over the last couple months of visiting Tony, he’d never been in the library before. The shelves were endless and, it seemed, categorized by genre. He was in military history, both ancient eastern and western accounts side by side. “This is...wow.”
you’ve done something. There are two of you Anthony. Two. Please tell me this is a simple doppelganger spell and not an actual clone or anything. You told me about that muggle science technology--I can’t believe you’d--”
The car came to a stop and Steve didn’t wait for the driver, he threw open his door and beelined towards the elevators. He had exactly ten minutes until his briefing, and he intended to be there right on time.
Protect. Protect.
They finished the game, Tony winning but it wasn’t a slaughter and Tony actually seemed surprised. After, Tony fixed him with an unrelenting stare and Steve shifted. “Where did you learn to play chess like that? I really don’t know much about you other than you’re a persistent artist that also works in security. Probably served, or is still on reserves.”
Steve had to take a breath to not clench his fist too hard around Tony’s too-thin waist.
Bruce and Ahana chuckle before Bruce shifts to the wolf's leg and takes a look at it. Bruce gently presses the wound and slowly lifts the leg and turns it gently left and right and hums. "How bad, Bruce?" Ahana asks worriedly "No broken bones but his ligament is a little torn up, but, don't worry no surgery needed, for now I'd recommend a cast and plenty of rest, it'll heal up in a week or two" Bruce says and Ahana sighs in relieve "Oh, thank God". After the check-up, Bruce packs his things into his bag and takes a seat beside her "So, what now? That leg will take at minimum one week to heal and you can't keep it at you office" he deadpans and Ahana sighs "I don't know, I'll just bring him to the compund" "And the rest?" "One way or another, they'll know, so, better let them know now." she says, petting the wolf, the wolf rolling over and nuzzling his muzzle into Ahana's blouse, rumbling happily. Bruce chuckles "He really loves you, huh?" "Yeah" Ahana answers with a smile. Bruce checks his watch and curses before hugging Ahana "I have to go, another appoinment with doctor but let me know if there's any discomfort, kay?" "Yeah, sure. Hey, how's the surrogacy?' "It's okay so far, they planted both mine and Thor's swimmers into Jane's egg, now its the waiting game. Today, he wants to inform whether the fertilization is succesful or not" he says. "Hmm, good luck anyways and yeah, I'll inform if anything" she says and Bruce kisses her head once before exiting her office. "Guess now it's just me and you, huh baby boy?" she says, scratching his head and the wolf whines as an answer.
Bucky peppered kisses all over her face while one digit turned into two and then three of his fingers were pumping in and out of her core, slick dripping onto the sheets below. "My baby girls’ needy, isn’t she?.." Bucky all but purred into her ears and Tasha nodded furiously, strangled chokes and moans tumbling out of her lips "I want to fill you up so bad. Fill you up with my come, load you up with my babies-" Tasha mewled loudly and gripped Bucky's hair tightly "Ohh..you like that idea, don't you baby girl? You, pregnant with my babies...god, baby girl, you'd be the most gorgeous pregnant woman anyone will ever see, pregnant with my babies" Bucky growled. "P-please. Bucky-fuck!" Tasha pleaded, tears staining her cheeks :"N-need y-your c-cock!" Tasha pleaded again. Bucky loved how responsive she was with every twist of his fingers in her "I know...shh, shh" Bucky soothed while he brought his metal arm to wipe her tears away "I can hear how wet you are baby girl." Tasha's pant and Bucky's grunt was the only sound that filled the room and the smell of sex permeated through the walls of the room "Shit, doll. You’re so tight. Relax..relax" Bucky rubbed his metal arm up and down her stomach while his other fingers were four digit deep into her, his erection painfully curved against his stomach. After a few minutes, Bucky pulled out his fingers, Tasha whimpering at the lost of his fingers but moaned when the tip of his cock brushed against her core, slowly, Bucky pushed in, the familiar warmth enveloping his cock and Bucky had to try so hard not to cum right that spot. Once he fully bottomed out, he waited until Tasha's fingers tapped a Morse code against his thighs, signalling him to go, he pulled out completely until only his tip was attached and slammed into the heat again. Tasha screamed and arched her back, almost floating off of the bed "Taking me so good, doll. Fuck just listen to you. So wet. Just for me." Tasha moaned and mewled at every hit on her G-spot "That’s right doll. Let me hear you. Wanna know how good you feel." "Fuck! Bucky! I’m coming!" Bucky was also reaching his climax, the familiar heat building at the bottom of his stomach, so he leaned near her ears and whispered "Come for me, doll..let yourself go.." and Tasha tumbled over the edge, her body convulsing with each spurt of her come, Bucky followed a minute later, his cum filling the insides of the wall. He ran both his hands up and down her sides and soothed her through her orgasm. Finally Bucky pulled out, wincing at the discomfort and landed at her side. Tasha then turned to her side, grimacing at the cum dripping down her core. She caressed her hands and kissed him soft and slow, pulling back with a soft smile "Morning, dear" "Morning, baby girl."
Steve pressed his lips back against a smile. He had noticed Tony back on earth--his style, his air, the way he drew everyone’s attention when he walked into a room, and the fact that once he had their attention he did nothing but dazzle and impress them. Except, Steve had started to wonder, somewhere between the itch under his skin and the taste of Tony’s kiss, if maybe it wasn’t everyone that noticed Tony, maybe that was a sign of how he’d felt about Tony all along. But it took putting them into each other’s arms to make him realize how deep his interest went.
“Steve, the only other option is killing him.”
He let Tony get into the capsule first. It seemed as if the other man had no qualms or hesitations when it came to sharing such a small space, just nestled up by the wall on his side in a moderately successful attempt at giving Steve some room. The sleep pants clung to his hips and his shirt rode up enough to drive Steve’s focus to the line, but not so high that Tony seemed to notice it.
Tony looked towards him but couldn’t quite get his eyes to reach the bed from his position on the sofa. He made an affirmative noise in his throat. “And we--” He shifted, and Steve was about to protest but Tony held out a hand “--I’m fine. We need to make a plan, is all. With Obie.”
“I do know everything. Take off your jeans.”
They were silent as they landed, the stone following them into the hut. He had Anthony lower it onto the desk, knew that he’d have to have Steve bleed on it soon. He only hesitated because this was his last chance, if this didn’t work...
That was fine; Steve noticed enough for both of them.
But he still felt his eye on him.
Tony turned so he was walking backwards, sending Steve a devastatingly shy smile, one he hadn’t ever seen before. This was important to him, and he wanted Steve to like it. Steve’s heart  clenched along with his stomach.
. Not about him, about us, about me.” His hands reached for Stane and he pushed him back hard. Stane keened backwards, tumbling down to the floor and hitting the side of his head with the corner of the toppled coffee table. The crack echoing around the hotel room.
“Just like that. You know you need your finishing touches before you’re ready for work.”
“Mathematically or gut feelingsy?”
He regretted it immediately. Under the chlorine and the soft, sweet honey was the barest hint of orange citrus. Only this time, it didn’t contain any of the lingering fear from when he’d first scented it in the library. Tony continued talking around a smirk, like he was thoroughly enjoying Steve’s response to him, and Steve struggled to catch up.
The armour moved like Tony, even when every inch of him was obscured. Steve followed him down the hallway, eyes latching onto the easy way the joints slid and the metal panels fit together. It really was a marvel of engineering. Steve was vaguely aware of the rest of the team peeling off towards the debrief, but he followed Iron Man all the way to the hangar bay,
“Absolutely.”
“Yeah?” Steve asked, and wanted to kick himself to stop his heart from racing as Tony moved closer to him on the bench.
Collaborator Name FestiveFerret
“I’m bleeding from multiple places and if you make a loud noise, I’ll probably jump in the shower or attack you. But if you say so.” He turned his back back to Steve, but didn’t stop talking. “Hate helps me stay upright. Obadiah Stane betrayed me and my family. He told my mother he’d look out for me, he---” Tony broke off. “I’m going to break this fucking bond.”
He couldn’t stop staring at the chain, and so many thoughts flooded his mind. Tony holding the handle of the briefcase, pulling Steve along at his leisure. Bound. As long as Tony held the briefcase, he’d have Steve near. Wanted.
Coulson nodded and kept walking down the hall. He knew, and he was going to let Steve keep it. But one thing was for certain, he couldn’t swipe any more R&D from SHIELD.
Tony and Steve walked through a hallway so narrow, they had to brush against each other as they made their way through the garland lined backstage of the arena. They looked over the sheet of paper SHIELD had given them with the information for their mission. “I still don’t understand why SHIELD is protecting pop stars,” Tony grumbled
Steve’s eyes widened. “That sounds difficult.”
One line in, and Tony's eyelids dipped, a sweet smile softening his gaze. A beautiful sight that was enough to distract, usually would, but today Steve pushed through the words. “Well...you looked up at me, and your wrist, delicate and fine, twitched in the cuff; it stopped me in my tracks.”
“What do we need to do?”
“Tony, I’m Captain America.” Crap. He hadn’t meant to say that, but the thought of lying...Silence rang out over the chess table until Tony blurted out a bark of laughter.
Bucky chuckled under his breath, soft and wistful. “Says the kid who used to freeze under a warm breeze.”
“You don’t have to--”
“You’re going to need to improve your pretending for when Steve returns.”
“Why must you ask that?” Steve had groaned. Tony just winked at him, pressed a brief kiss to his lips and sashayed his way to the elevator.
“You didn’t pick up flying, did you? Have that superpower and maybe you kept it on the downlow? Because flying, flying would be very nice right about now.”
“Us Starks are packrats.”
“Have a good day at work, dear,” Steve said sweetly. Hand dropping to press against Tony’s cock once through the pants before falling away. Steve smirked when Tony choked on his breath.
“I think my mother found the diary--wait.”
Tony shook his head and tried to keep his awe at bay. “Thank you for the tour,” he said, trying to sound natural.
“It sounded like you were a fan.”
“Truer words,” Tony agreed.  He walked over to the desk where Steve had placed the stone, crouching so he was eye level. “When I bled on it, it didn’t open the portal immediately. I think it’d be best if you drop a bead on it and leave the hut right after. Both of you.”
“No,” he cut off. “Screaming his head off big.”
Something was wrong. A part of him
Tonight, the ship told them it was time for bed long before either of them started to yawn. The overhead lights dimmed in the hallway and turned off entirely in the commissary and cockpit.They both made their way slowly to the dormitory--the cubicle barely warranted the name--Iron Man armor falling away the closer they got. Steve watched as more and more of Tony was revealed and, compounded with the impending capsule sharing, ramped up the itch under his skin that had never really subsided. Tony was a spotlight that left as much as an impression in his eyes when he looked away as a blinding light, but instead of a dark circle imprinted over his gaze it was the strip of Tony’s abdomen, where his shirt lifted as the chest piece of his armor pulled away. Long flat lines of muscle that Steve was about to be lying next to.
Tony shrugged. “That line of argument didn’t seem to persuade Obie.”
The guy blew a hiss through his teeth. “Yeah, they’ve been cracking down on that lately.” Steve blessed his luck. They stepped back, letting him have an open path to the door.
blared overhead. “The power of pop,” Tony observed.
“No.”
But when he looked up at Tony his book was promptly forgotten. The man dropped his jaw, looking just as surprised as Tony felt, to be face to face with the mirror image of himself.
Tony hummed, imagining his mother and a woman that looked vaguely like Steve watching over them. “Did she teach you any more songs?”
Steve shifted towards him, put his hands over Tony’s. “I can get you out. My apartment, or SHIELD, or a hotel, anywhere. I can keep you safe.”
As they got to the chaise, Tony broke away and Steve immediately missed his warmth. “I should go.”
“It’s pretty bad, huh?” Tony’s eyes started to shine with unshed tears and Steve watched him fight them, tuck it all away and give Steve a soft smile.
“I hear Hawkeye--” Namjoon’s face lit up and Tony cut him off not wanting to hear anyone geek out about Clint right now, or ever.
The penthouse was empty when the elevator opened onto it. This was only the second time he’d been here, and was still awed by its immense open floor plan. It smelled only of Tony because Stane summoned him to
“Come here, Professor.” Tony led him over to the stacked mats, pulling them apart to reveal the unpainted shield.
“I threw a knife in your direction over a pastry, there’s a difference.”
Time passed.
Steve’s stomach twisted. Stane had seen the library, the pool, the kitchen. It explained so horribly why Mr. Jarvis and Chef Ana were gone. In the footage, Stane would’ve seen it all. Steve wondered if he’d heard too, if the cameras had audio. Did he know that Tony wanted to leave him? It must have been obvious. Either way, it didn’t seem to matter much to Obadiah State what or who Tony wanted.
Tony must have noticed the effect he was having on Steve, but he didn’t seem to have any urgency in his explorations. His fingers wandered anywhere they liked, without pattern or rhythm. Occasionally they brushed along his straining erection, but they never showed any inclination to linger there.
There was so much Steve hadn’t expected.
The movement was enough to jar Steve from his thoughts; Tony didn’t need his pity or his futile questions. He needed first aid. Bending down, he looked under the hotel sink, grateful to find a leather box with disinfectant wipes, bandages, and cotton swabs. There weren't any supplies for stitching, but the cuts on his back didn’t look thick enough to warrant it. Grabbing the wipes he turned back to Tony, who shifted without Steve even needing to say anything. His heart wrenched as he bent down, resisting the urge to brush his fingertips against Tony’s skin, offering a comfort not asked for and probably not desired, at least not right now.
They both stared at it; neither of them mentioning it aloud. In fact, they pointedly ignored it, with Tony shrugging in the armor, and insisting it was hours before anyone needed to sleep. Steve nodded. They would take shifts or something. But even as he looked at the sleep capsule, something about it wriggled under his skin, the mere image of him and Tony in it together causing an itch to form at the base of his spine. A tingle at how, to fit in the capsule--only slightly bigger than modern day MRI machines--they’d have to lay on their sides, or one pressed up against the other.
Water fell down Tony in streams, torrents slicing from his hair over his face and neck. When he stepped onto the top step, he shook his head, a small smile accompanying the movement. The water continued its journey down, and Steve watched as it slid through the thin layer of Tony's chest hair, so different from Steve’s own. He found himself absentmindedly brushing his hand over his own chest under the surface, mimicking the trail of droplets.
“Oh, Steve!” Tony greeted with surprise, cheeks flushed with exertion. He unbuckled the helmet and slipped it from his head, running his fingers through his wet curls. “You see me out there?”
Steve remembered it perfectly. It was a sunny day, the sky so blue and the sun so high that it bounced off the line of bruises around Tony’s neck. At the time, he wasn’t Tony to Steve, he was a nameless stranger, a mop of messy brown hair, eyes cast low but chin still fighting to inch higher. From across the street, the bruises appeared to be a collar but as he moved closer, the sour scent of distressed omega made Steve look more carefully.
“You fight him everyday, in one hundred different ways. Us, right here, this is you fighting him.”
Tony hung his head, and nodded.
“Unfortunately, not.” Steve led them toward the kitchen, slow but steady.
Steve smiled and got on the train.
The next two weeks felt like a dream. Every time Steve closed his eyes, he remembered the feel of Tony against him, the taste of him mixed with his honeyed scent, undeniable proof that Tony enjoyed this new aspect of their relationship just as much as Steve.
Tony yelped, hands tightening around the broom.
Stunned, Steve gasped and Tony leaned closer, swiping his tongue along Steve’s lips. Steve moaned, mouth opening to the first taste of Tony, the first feel of his eager arms coming around to pull Steve flush against him. Their scents rolled around them, heady in bright citrus and honeyed musk. Tony gasped against his lips and Steve never wanted the kiss to end, he ran his hands over Tony’s back, into his hair, back down over his neck, touching all the places he’d wanted to touch for so long, but felt so unsure, so unable to, because Tony wasn’t his and had shown no desire to be.
“I’ve been wanting to make you come for a long time,” he murmured, picking up the pace of his hand and Steve could only watch, their cocks disappearing inside a calloused grip. Fascinated by the sight, he felt an urge to pick up the camera.
“Well if we’re going to do the whole title thing: Tony Stark aka Iron Man, aka genius, playboy--”
Outside the van, Bucky took a deep breath. Rows of gold, and Bucky knew what caught his eye about them. The color. It reminded him of Iron Man’s helmet catching in his periphery, Tony’s gold watch pulling his eye. The sunflowers reminded him of Tony.
Tony had told Steve that the penthouse hadn’t changed much since his parents had been alive. He kept their family portrait hanging above the piano in the living room and Steve shuffled and turned away from Tony’s parents' posthumous gaze. He walked instead through the apartment to the large balcony with its attached swimming pool. Tony was in it, the sun shining bright overhead, and Steve forgot how to swallow.
Tony leaned down, whispered the word, “Yeah?” into Steve’s neck before biting lightly at the skin, licking a line down the sparkling skin. Uncertainty tinged Tony’s word, one Steve was unfamiliar associating with Tony. It made him bold, tugging on Tony’s chin until he got the hint and brought their lips together again. The kiss was slow, thorough, like they had all the time in the world.
“Time to relinquish control,” Tony added, one hand running down Bucky’s chest, the other up Steve’s calf. His fingers traced over Steve’s inner thigh then wrapped around his leaking cock. “Time for us to take care of you. Just like we know how.”
They were intoxicating, able to drive Steve wild with a single touch. His hands dragged up their sides, holding them closer to him; the evidence of their matching arousals against his thighs took his breath away. He pulled back from the kiss with a gasp, growling under his breath, “You don’t have to ‘guess’ anything. You two are
“Are you ready?” Steve replied, his own voice barely above a whisper, like if they didn’t speak about it directly then they could pretend it wasn’t happening, that this was any other Wednesday. Tony looked over his shoulder, face closer than it had been since they last kissed and this time Tony didn’t drop his eye.
The vibrating on his desk pulled him away from his CFO’s presentation, and Tony let his gaze drop to his phone, heart starting to race even before he got visual confirmation that it was Steve. He flicked the message open and what a visual it was.
Anthony stepped forward, face creased with concern. “Wait, you didn’t mention this last time.” His voice turned cold. “Are you telling me the stone is going to portal Steve--”
“Did you teach him too?”
“I’m so sorry, Tony. I should’ve told you, I
Steve pushed open the doors to the large cafeteria where their company had ordered-in Korean catering, and it was like the group of suave young men transformed into absolute children, darting to the buffet line screaming, “japchae!”, “kimchi jjigae!” “gimbap!” Their leader stayed behind, nodding towards Steve and Tony. “We really do appreciate you two doing this for us. The threatening letter they’d sent was one thing, but when the shapeshifters showed up in our studios well--” he broke off looking over his group, gaze hardened from the memory. “It’s scary to think that all they need to do is get a look at one of us in the eye, and that’s it, they’d be able to take over our bodies, our lives.”
This time, it wasn’t the sight of him yelling into a cell phone on the sidewalk, it wasn’t the way he snapped at Tony or radiated anger and aggression. It was his acrid scent, enraged and determined, reeking a line straight through the hotel lobby.
"Hey" someone greeted as Scar was busy arranging her books in her locker. Scar took a deep breath, closed her eyes and opened them again. She purposely slammed the locker door and looked at him with a raised eyebrow 'What do you want?" she asked harshly and Steve winced "Just wanted to ask, where is Tony?" and Scar looked at him in a weird expression "Seriously? No, like seriously? Now you care? After like what four years of being M.I.A now you wanna know about Tony?" she asked crossing her arms. Steve shuffled his feet and fidgeted in his place "I mean...he isn't at school for more than two weeks, and that's not him at all-" Scar cut him "Oh. So you think you know him better now? You went missing for four years, you idiot! Maybe he changed! Maybe he changed and didn't want to come to school! Maybe he has issues in his house that he doesn't wanna come to school! Maybe
. She looked absolutely delicious and Bucky just wanted to peel those clothes off of her that instant. Tony was nothing short as he was stunning as ever, he was in
” Tony looked at the nearest camera and smiled fondly and took the elevator to his penthouse.
Translation -
Tony came back to school after 3 weeks and sat down at his place, the ever bubbly Tony replaced by someone quiet and withdrawn. He never talked much but always hung out with Scar and Bucky. The trio rarely have sleepovers and often like staying alone and doing their works alone. Scar and Tony became very withdrawn in class until the teachers allowed them to leave school early, since both of them always looked like they never slept last night. Steve's heart shattered to see two of the most smartest and talkative people in his class so quiet and always like to blend at the background rather than being in center stage. Tony came back and saw a piece of paper weighed down under his bottle, he took it out, saw the sender and turned back and glared at Steve before crumpling the paper and throwing it into the dustbin. Steve broke a soft sob as he saw what Tony did and rested his face on top of the desk, bringing his arms around his face and cried again. It was a note that said 'Don't worry, everything will be alright', now crumpled and waiting in the dustbin to be disposed.
Slowly, "T..T'ny..?" Tony stopped and stared at Tasha below him. "I...is that..yo..you?" she asked again. Tony's eyes filled with tears and he slowly got up from Tasha's lying body and sat back only to scramble towards her and embrace her tight. "Yes..yes..it's me..Tony..your Tony.." he rasped between hitched breaths. Tasha took a few minutes before she returned the embrace and cried. Tony took all her weight and rocked both of them back and forth, kissing every inch of skin available to him, Tasha returning every kiss. "God..Tasha..god, every day...missed you..so much.." Tony hiccuped and Tasha kissed his forehead lightly. After a few minutes, they pulled apart and stared at each other before Tasha beamed at him and placed a last kiss on top of his head. She caressed Tony's jaw, lips, ears,cheeks,hair as if to remember all those features that made Tony, well Tony. Tont huffed wetly "It's me sis, it's really me, I'm really here" "Oh, Tony....I'm so sorry-" "Hey, no apologizing, that wasn't you, that was your alter ego" Tasha looked away from Tony's eyes and looked at the ground but Tony took her chin and made her face him "It wasn't you." Tasha smiled but it didn't reach her eyes but nodded nonetheless. They hugged one more time, before Tasha's eyes traveled to the other person standing behind Tony. She looked up and gasped. Tony knew and let her go, helping her up before she fell into Bucky's arms like a broken ragdoll. Bucky automatically pulled he in and shoved his face into her hair breathing in her scent. "I'm here, doll. I'm here, I got ya, you're safe." Bucky kept repeating it as Tasha held onto him like a lifeline. Bucky kissed her head, her forehead and continued to pepper her face with light kisses, careful of the nasty bruises she was already sporting. "James..." and they kissed. Bucky kept the kiss light, memorizing her lips and the feeling of her weight against his. Reluctantly parting off, Bucky leaned his forehead against Tasha's and they stayed like that for a long while, just breathing each other's breath. "James, James...I..I love you..." Tasha rasped, her voice hitched. Bucky tightened his hold on her and pecked her lips on more time "I love you too, doll" Bucky breathed into her ears.

” “Remove the exterior skin of the handbag” “
Steve looks at Bucky as he and Natasha carry Ahana away and sighs. His attention then turn to the Iron Man suit, if Ahana wasn't in it, then there must be someone else, and the wolf is gone. Steve slowly pads towards the half bent Iron Man suit and crouches in front of it. "J? Disassemble the suit." he orders and immediately hears a distinct whimper, as the suit opens and reveals a man inside. Steve is momentarily shocked before he gently touches the man and the man's head shoots up, fear in his eyes. Steve inhales sharply and distinctively hears a curse behind him "Tony...?" he asks and the man nods "Who..you?" and Steve cries, hugging the man. The man stiffens before relaxing into his hold, burying his face into Steve's neck. Steve tightens his hold around the man and mutters into his hair. Steve lets go a while later, but keeps his arms loosely around the man "Tones..? I'm Steve, your...your friend, and they" he says as he shows the rest of them "are your family...okay?" he slowly says and Tony nods slowly "St've...?" Tony asks pointing at him and Steve nods, smiling.
" JARVIS called and when Tony didn't answer him, he started the emergency alarm immediately "
Yikes! That escalated quickly! Anyway...see you in the next chapter!
Finally! She's back!
Enjoy!
5.Tebe ne obyazatel'no eto delat', kotenok. Pozvol'te nam zabrat' vas obratno. My pomozhem vam vyzdorovet' ... -You don't have to do this, kitten. Let us take you back. We will help you recover ...
Bucky shook his head and huffed a soft laughter. He climbed out of bed, made their bed and was on his way to the bathroom, when he heard Tasha's voice flowing through the small crack of the opened door. Bucky smiled and continued his journey to the bathroom. He relieved himself, flushed the toilet, washed his hands, brushed his teeth, washed his hands again, shaved his morning stubble, washed his face and went to the kitchen. Entering the kitchen, he saw Tasha, bustling around the area, going back and forth between the island counter and the fridge, grabbing what it seems to be ingredients for a bowl of cereal. She was talking a mile a minute, was when Bucky noticed the bluetooth earpiece dangling from her right ear. "-by using sound waves and known genetic techniques, we can, for the first time, noninvasively control specific brain regions and cell types as well as the timing of when neurons are switched on or off" Tasha looked up from the various papers scattered around the island counter next to her cereal and saw Bucky. She smiled and held up her index finger in the universal sign for "gimme a minute" but Bucky waved her off and walked towards her, planting a light kiss on top of her head, pushing the cereal away from her elbow to avoid accidents and went to the coffee machine for his dose of caffeine. "While several emerging methods in neuroscience allow researchers to manipulate brain circuits, most require invasive techniques such as stereotaxic surgery, which can damage tissue and initiate a long-lasting immune response, also, conventional pharmacological approaches lack the spatial, temporal and cell-type specificity required to treat the brain, and can lead to deleterious side effects." Bucky sat opposite Tasha and sat down with a cup of black coffee and a plate of eggs and bacon. Sitting down, Tasha immediately coiled her feet around Bucky's ankle with her thumb occasional brushing the skin there. Bucky in returned reached out to her hand and played with her pinky finger. "To get around these issues, the Caltech team first injected microbubbles into mice’s blood vessels, and then zapped the bubbles with ultrasound waves at specific regions in the brain to create temporary, local openings in the blood-brain barrier. The researchers then took advantage of those openings to sneak in a viral vector carrying a gene coding for an engineered type of protein known as designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs)—in this case, a receptor that would respond to the synthetic drug clozapine-N-oxide (CNO)." Tasha walked towards the blue file that laid in the hall and returned back, flipping through the pages until she reached the page that was covered in test graphs and results. Bucky just shook his head and started recalling another fond memory, sipping his coffee.
P.S - It's all tooth-rooting fluff!
Reaching the HYDRA base, the teams seperated to their given posts. Two guards were hit by Steve's shield and two more were shot by Bucky's gun. The duo advanced to the building simultaneously killing all the HYDRA guards and agent. They finally entered the building "The metahumans were held down here and he lead Steve towards a secret tunnel. Halfway through, a loud shriek echoed from inside and Steve and Bucky halted their steps, heart beating "Tasha.." Bucky whispered to himself. They were going to wipe her memories, no, that's not gonna happen this time and the duo ran following the sound. Their hearts stopped when they saw Tasha struggling on the chair while her mind was being wiped, Steve then threw his shield and threw off several doctors and the procedure completely stopped. Bucky raced towards her and unclasped the restrains and bridal carried Tasha in his arms, tears flowing from his eyes. The heavy jostling caused Tasha to crack one of her eye and look at Bucky then her other eyes followed suit and her eyes widened "James...?" Bucky slowed his steps entering the Avenjet and pressed his forehead to hers "Yes, doll...it's me...I told you I'll come back" and the jet flew away from the now destroyed HYDRA base. Tasha's eyes was still open when they laid her on the examination table in the MedBay in the jet and she gasped. Tony squeezed her ways through the crowd and halted his steps when Tasha's eyes met his. They continue looking at each other when she suddenly reached for Tony with a shaky hand and Tony immediately grabbed her hands and pressed his forehead against hers and whispered "You're back, you're back sis, I'm not going anywhere..." Tasha cracked a small smile before passing out on the table.
Entering the class, Tony saw a piece of paper on his table, weighed down by his pencil box. He approached his table and sat, taking the paper and gasping quietly. It was a drawing- not professional but a beautiful one nonetheless -and he turned to the back and caught Steve's eyes, Steve beaming back at him as Tony mouthed a thank you. He turned back at the drawing, it was him. He was smiling widely and talking to someone on his right- most probably at Scar  -with a big smile, gap tooth and all. His curly and unruly hair and his chubby cheeks were also drawn to perfection. At the very end of the paper were words, four words that bloomed an unconditional happiness in his heart. 'Nice to meet you, Tony' the writing said and it was signed off with a 'Yours, Steve' and a goofy smiley emoji. Tony beamed at the drawing again and carefully slid it into his file, closed it and took a deep breath and waited for his next class
Hi guys! Thanks for all the kudos, hits and comment(s) *blushes*
P.S - Since Vision exists at the Avengers compound, Tony installed JARVIS at the Stark Tower to take care of his company. And I really like Riri Williams, so she is the CEO of Stark Industries.
Driving towards the venue, Tasha reached over and laced her fingers with Tony and gave a squeeze. Tony momentarily turned towards Tasha and gave a quick smile and squeezed back her hands. "Thanks for..trusting me" Tasha suddenly said in a soft voice and Tony stopped at the red light and turned towards Tasha "What do you mean, sis?" "I mean..if it wasn't for you or Bucky or Steve, I..I wouldn't have come this far in my life" "Hey..you're family..and family members stick together, no matter what" Tasha leaned over and kissed his cheeks and Tony continued driving. After a while, Tasha cleared her throat "Hey, Tones?" Tony hummed telling her to continue "How...how did you know Steve was the one?" Tasha asked in a soft voice. Tony turned towards Tasha with a knowing smirk "Why..?" "Uhh...I mean, like how did you know that it was Steve that you'll be living for the rest of your life?" Tony's smirk changed into a shock and he gripped her hands "Am I thinking what you're thinking..?" Tasha blushed and looked down at her lap. Tony then parked his car in the VIP parking and fully turned towards Tasha and used his other hand to lift Tasha's face to look at him "Hey..I think he'll say yes, I mean you guys were pretty much together for a very, very, long time, so..I think..I..I'm happy for you Tasha..you both deserve each other" Tasha looked at him with tears in her eyes and hugged him tight. "Okay, okay, my makeup is going to be ruined, let's go!" Tony and Tasha laughed and excited the car and headed to the auditorium.
Prosnis', Yelena - Wake up, Yelena
Bucky skirts his left hand to her bra hooks and deftly unhooks it and throws it, the garment landing on the floor with a muffled thud. Bucky then starts kissing down her neck ad swipes his tongue on her nipples, causing her breath to hitch and her grip to tighten against the satin sheets. Bucky expertly sucks on her tits as his other hand rolls the other nipple, Ahana's legs automatically spreading, positioning Bucky in between her legs. His right hand then slowly travels to the waistband of her panties and taps against her covered clit. "Fuck baby, you're so wet. You're drippin':" Bucky mutters as he finishes sucking her second breasts and licks his way down to her clit. Bucky rubs two fingers against her clit and Ahana whimpers "Bucky, baby....please" she begs and Bucky chuckles darkly "Please what baby?" he asks as he licks on long stripe at her covered clit and Ahana moans loudly "Please...please fuck me" she begs and Bucky hums "I'd do anythin', if you beg this pretty, kitten" Bucky teases as he mover her panties aside and slowly pushes his middle finger into her warm wet heat, groaning as her inner walls clench around his fingers.
