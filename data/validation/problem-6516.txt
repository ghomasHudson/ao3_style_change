“Where is he? What happened? Is he all right?” Steve responded, his voice laced with evident worry and alarm.
If Steve sensed or smelled something wrong he didn't point it out, choosing to hold his hand and give unspoken support. Tony was thankful for it. “You will, I promise you that. She's a hard one to let go, especially for Bucky. And she'd say the same thing we are. You look so handsome in that outfit.”
pack knew. Jarvis and Vision knew. Steve literally had numerous betas and omegas try to get his attention when they first met us and he
,” Hammer hissed, his face so close now. “You ran off and found yourself a whelp to spread your legs for like the little whore you are. Not only that, you’re now carrying a
Tony gave his friend and cockatoo a dry look. The effect probably ruined by his pinkened cheeks, but still he tried.
“You’re drooling again, Steve,” Natasha smirked with a lazy stare towards Steve’s direction. Everyone instinctively shifted their gazes to him, all of them with knowing grins on their faces and while Tony didn’t see any visible drool coming out of Steve’s mouth he did note the alpha looked like someone seconds away from doing it. He blushed and gave a shy smile.
. Where the adrenaline is almost none stop. His body goes numb. It moves on its own. Steve has no recollection of how he finally broke free of his binds, nor any recollection of what follows after, but he does recall the screams of the many alphas in the room. Many terrible, horrible screams of pain, gurgling in blood. A lot of blood. Metallic and blinding red in a sea of gray.
The alpha interrupted him, kissing his cheek then moving to his forehead and to his nose and finally stopping at his lips to peck over and over again. Tony melted at the contact, sighing as he relaxed and allowed the alpha to do as he pleased. Steve’s arms moved to wrap around his lower back, sending a tingle down his spine. He made a soft noise when one of Steve’s hands squeezed his side, holding his flab between his fingers and making Tony flush in mortification from both the action and his own body’s response to it. Heat started building in his belly and blood soon started rushing south faster than Tony could’ve attempted to stop. No amount of imagining unattractive things would’ve helped him, not when Steve tightened his hold and gave a tug to lift Tony up and straddle his thighs, prompting Tony to sit higher and change the angle of their kissing. Steve now had his head upward while Tony faced downward.
In a surprising turn Tony's face didn't turn a bright red from the comment. His mind was racing with the same thoughts of why Steve was here giving him attention and how he was apparently lucky enough for it.
He just had to get to the shacks and then this whole ordeal could finally be over. Just survive the walk back. “I’m fine. The feeling will eventually go away. If we don’t go already the sun will be gone by the time I can walk properly.”
He had doomed Bruce to suffer with him because of his carelessness. The Avengers were now going after the other omega associated with Tony. To humiliate Tony and anyone close to him. Make them all hurt.
“Keep that promise and there’ll be rolls included in your payroll. Nothing like warm sweets after a hard day's work.”
“We’re just taking a walk,” Tony managed. The rumbling the beta was making caused the hairs on the back of his neck to stand. “Something wrong with that?”
Bruce sighed in defeat, accepting the response. Jarvis switched from Tony's shoulder to Bruce’s and nipped his ear while Vision gently bumped against his leg. Wordlessly they agreed to wait until Bruce returned to a reasonable state before heading to where the Avengers were resting. It wouldn’t do to have the omega twitchy and jumping at every possible trigger with them. Tony offered his coat, hoping the familiar scent of a friend helped sooth away the anxiety. He was still wearing Steve’s coat so it wasn’t as if he needed it.
He got the feeling Bruce knew what he meant. Perhaps experiencing the same thoughts and self-doubts? Or perhaps he spent enough time with Tony and figured out how his mind worked? Either way it seemed Bruce wasn’t having any of it. “All right, but remember we’re surrounded. Blocked in on every corner,” and it was true. Both Tony and Bruce were smack in the center of the lineup. Steve was, naturally, leading the pack up front with Bucky and Natasha keeping close. Thor, Clint and Sam made the back. Loki (now back in his two legged shape) and Jan were right behind the two omegas and Hank was right in front. “Don’t think whatever it is you’re thinking about. There’s no escape.”
would I leave him when I lo -” he snapped his mouth shut, realizing at the last second what he was about to say.
He got to work on the weapons of the first two shifters mentioned. Steve’s shield was the easiest. The shape had already taken form from Tony’s constant work during the road. It was now circular in shape. Meant for offense instead of defense. However, it still couldn’t handle Steve’s strength or the power he exhorted. Not without the silver rune Tony had implemented within the metal. The rune cost little magic to use. So little that all that was required of Tony was one tap to bring the magic forward. It would fortify the shield. Make it nearly indestructible. Nothing natural or artificial would create a dent on it unless it used unnatural force.
Ben quickly went inside when they reached the building, leaving Tony and May to distract Peter and keep the secret a little longer. Peter had no idea and he was going to be in for a big surprise.
“I know,” Tony kissed him again. “I know. I forgive you, but I need you to know that you never have to worry about Rhodey or Pepper or even Happy. Rhodey is my brother and always will be. He sees me as nothing but his little brother, calls me that all the time. And Pepper is mated with Happy. The last thing she wants to do is run off with me.”
Tony quickly turned the side of his body carrying Vision away. “No, no repairs needed. I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have come in here.”
was an idea. They wanted him to recreate his gauntlets. They wanted weapons. Tony could create simple weapons easily, but it wouldn't be enough to escape. Maybe if he were to experiment. To try and improve the gauntlets further. Something could
Rhodey and Pepper… Tony wondered what the two were currently doing, and what they would say about Tony joining the Avengers pack, and their opinion of the pack in general.
Thor and Loki didn’t need any modifications from him. Both feline and serpent were very well adjusted. Hank favored his own work greatly so Tony didn’t dare to touch him. For Rhodey, Sam, Bucky, and Peggy he improved their pistols and rifles. Rhodey had taken a liking to the gatling gun he had taken from the first Hydra pack they had fought. One rune in the back of the thing had lifted much of the weight, allowing for Rhodey to easily handle it. Bruce, besides improving his armor, didn’t require much. The Hulk was already a perfect combatant. Nothing much Tony could do for him.
, he reasoned and slid his hand down to grasp the base of his member. Commonly small in omegas, but he had no one to compare averages. He gave it three strokes to get it fully erect, then thought better of his stance and kneeled down to prevent any slipping. A few more strokes and he realized the arousal was slowly disappearing. If he didn’t finish this now he was going to find himself frustrated for the rest of the day. A bit desperate he began maneuvering and twisting and stroking, even fondling his small sack, but found himself nowhere near to a climax.
Hammer gave him an infuriated look. “Yes, you’ve said this already. Come now, Omega, surely you know the Avengers won’t keep you forever. Eventually, they will tire of you. How long do you think you can satisfy the Captain? How long are they willing to let you entertain them until a refurbish is required? Youth has long abandoned you, Darling.”
Tony stirred to something moving and bumping into his side. Not wanting to open his eyes he batted a hand at it, wincing when it turned out he used his injured one and snapping his head up in a small fright when Vision let out a surprised sound. The shack was briefly illuminated by Vision’s blue eye lights and yellow rune as he let out a huff. The lights disappeared when Vision snuggled up against his hip and promptly fell asleep again. The urge to gently smack the machine again just to spite him flared up Tony’s arm but he knew not to make an enemy out of a contraption that technically didn’t require sleep.
“Got you!” Jan cheered with her tail wagging in victory. She only had a second to celebrate before Clint decided win or lose he was going to join the small pile. He tackled her and caused them both to land on Tony, who had the wind literally knocked out of him.
“Clint is enjoying Tony’s new outfit made by yours truly,” Jan answered with a flutter of her eyelashes.
In one shift Hammer was up with his hands on the seat and the roof of the carriage, keeping himself balanced as he settled one boot right over Tony’s abdomen. The location caught Tony completely off-guard. His chest was a better location to cause damage. His knees and shoulders, too. Why aimed there?
Tony’s eyes trailed to the alpha named, giving Steve’s smile a brief glance before his gaze landed on a round shield held on his back by a strap circling his right arm. That hadn’t been there either upon their first meeting. What or who had the Avengers fought against before they ran into Tony and Bruce that broke Steve’s shield? And why hadn’t Tony thought about the shield before? The Captain of the Avengers was known for always traveling with a shield. Didn’t matter if they traveled for a fight or were out in search of an individual that required a much needed rescue. Papers always wrote of the Captain with his shield.
“Soon you will lose your humanity and the beast will be released. Have you felt it? The sudden loss of control? The dragon takes over and you lose yourself completely.”
“She’s not joking,” Sam confirmed. “First few days he’s going to want to stay close. Did so with every one of us, but I get the feeling since he wants you as more than just a friend it’s going to be worse.”
“We came looking for you,” Pepper confirmed to him. “Oh, Tony… the moment we heard we immediately packed everything we needed and traveled the lands for a single clue to where you could’ve gone.”
“Seeing as I am a mere bird I hold no input in the decision. My opinion doesn’t matter. Whatever you decide I will follow.”
pack. The newly named Steve Rogers didn’t need to know he was a Stark and piece together he could possibly be related to
“You have his bite,” she pointed to her own neck in example, her bite mark - if she had one - hidden under her armor. “For as long as I've known him, Steve has never considered marking anyone.  Maybe even longer if what James says is true. Steve’s always been hesitant on the subject itself, sometimes stubborn to a fault. Seeing it on you tells me he's very serious.”
Tony was surprised, but he wasn’t as surprised as Bruce appeared as he stared dumbfounded at the prey. However, none of their reactions even came close to what each and every Avenger was expressing. All of them, including the expressionless Loki, were openly staring and gob smacked and had their mouths wide open (even the ones that had a mouth full of chewed fish,
Tony knew, everything he had ever wanted and craved while in his cycle, Steve would give it to him without question. For once in his life, he might receive the affection and praise and love he had always desired. To be held in warm arms, safe and protected, while someone whispered how perfect he was, how beautiful, how happy they were to be with him. It was a fantasy he always lost himself in under Hammer or alone in a room during his cycle.
Bruce, thankfully, didn’t give such a reaction. A month together had given him the edge of what to expect with Tony, considering he was going through the same thing. A few rabbits were hardly a proper meal. Eventually it would catch up to them and their bodies would decide it was done being given scraps and demanded proper sustenance. It was only Tony’s luck that his body decided to do so while hanging out with the Avengers.
Tony eyed the ripples the wind created on the surface of the water. “Steve took me here. On our first walk together. Said he saw something beautiful in all this, so he brought me here.”
“You already got his mark then,” she stared at the scars of his neck. He covered it out of reflex. He wasn't
Tension was built as the two alphas faced off until Tony couldn’t take it anymore. He was worried for his upcoming punishment and he was scared for the possible fight that could continue and he was absolutely terrified of the possibility of getting kicked out of the only good thing that had happened to him in years.
He scanned the area. This was to be his room. The lower level of the fort. Meaning if he was going to try and escape, he would need to go through Hammer’s entire pack. He wouldn’t be surprised if Hammer ordered betas to guard every corner of the fort. Inside and out. In the fort and in the forest.
Hammer knew of his ability, thanks to Obie, and Obie naturally knew because he helped raise him from a young age. Both alphas always looking for opportunities, they saw the potential his ability and skills had and pushed and pushed him to make rune weapons. He held back for as long as he could. He created mundane things not worth mentioning, and purposefully took weeks that extended into months to buy himself time, but eventually, he'd wear out. Old and broken he gave in and his rune gauntlets came to be. He was pushed to try something new, something never before seen, and when he presented the gauntlets to Hammer and Obie and got their approval he had felt on top of the world for the first time in years. That was until they used the gauntlets to hurt him. Hurt and betray in ways Tony hadn't believed they were capable of.
Then what did you mean by it? Were you to actually laugh but your body confused it with tears?” the serpent sneered.
Tony pushed back again, looking at Steve in confusion. “A day?” That’s… not possible. At least, not compared to his previous healthy heats he had back in his younger years and before Hammer. His heats would last at least four days minimum with the most intense of it on the first before it settled down to a simmer for the rest of his cycle. Simmer to something manageable where he was still capable of doing daily activities with only his pheromones spiking to attract mates.
“They’re frozen,” Peggy pointed at Pepper’s arm that had a water droplet sliding down. “They’re frozen and melting fast and they’re very much alive.”
Tony placed a hand on the little machine in order to keep him still, petting him when Vision gave a small whistle of annoyance that made Tony chuckle then switched it to surrender after Tony had said, “Dance all you want when you’re on the floor, otherwise I won’t walk right with you breaking my hip.”
Steve gave a reassuring smile if a little sheepish. “I’m not going to hurt myself. It’s been a while, though. I need to get used to it again.”
If that were the case then Tony was perfect, so long as Steve hadn’t planned to start a family with him. If Steve wanted the latter… then he should drop his losses and find a proper mate that could give it to him.
As Tony took a moment to stare at his pack on his knees, a thought dawned to him. The pack he had put together when he ran away from Hammer and Stane hadn’t been this close to stuffed. Far from it. The small pockets weren’t even filled and the clothing only filled halfway, the gauntlets at the bottom included. What he had now… most, if not all, were a privilege than a necessity, and they were his to choose from.
“Didn’t have enough time to see. I embarrassed myself in front of them and ran with my tail between my legs.”
Steve practically glowed. “Do you both perhaps want to spend time together then? With us, I mean. The pack and I.”
They walked down the stairs and made their way to the kitchen room without missing a beat. Bruce had been right about most of the pack already being present. The only ones still missing were Steve, Bucky and Natasha.
Tony rolled his eyes. “Unless you’re under a microscope, you’ll have better luck getting Ty’s attention.”
Rhodey, who had been in the air for seven minutes now, moved as fast as he could with his wings straining. One hydra head saw its chance and tried striking again and was inches away when a blast of cold air and icicles struck it on the side and sent it falling sideways and away from Rhodey.
A moan got stuck in his throat as Steve licked at his thighs, cleaning at the dry slick he had produced earlier. It only caused more slick to coat his skin in a new fresh layer. Steve held no quarrel licking that up, too. His thighs, his folds, every inch of skin within his reach the alpha licked and pinched. All Tony could do was remain still and remember to breathe. It was made difficult with Steve.
There was no point denying the pacing so he didn’t bother to try. “I can’t -” he started but was unable to form what he was so anxious about in words. The only thing he could come up that was close enough was “I don’t want to be left behind, Rhodey.”
Just wanted to say, thank you so much for still being here! I know my random updating schedule can be frustrating and I don't fault you for getting upset with how long it's taken me to update these recent chapters.
“Considering you raised us both, I believe you are referring to yourself, Sir,” Jarvis whistled back.
that did so and it was wrong of Tony to think anymore of it. It was pathetic, really, that he kept thinking back to that moment, wanting it desperately and imagining his life if it had happened only to feel extremely guilty afterwards because,
Tony took in the words, wondering what could have happened to the two betas for Hank to react in such a way all of a sudden. What had they seen or heard? No one was acting as if danger was nearby, so it couldn’t have been an attack. Their surroundings perhaps? But Thor had said reopened scars, so Hank must have seen something that reminding him of a horrible memory.
Hesitant, because he couldn’t bring himself to remove the warmth but it had to be done, he laid a gentle hand over the wolf’s head, petting softly and tapping a finger to encourage wakefulness. Steve stirred and the twitch of his ears were the signal that he was conscious, but instead of getting up like Tony had hoped he decided he still wanted to sleep and tucked his face inside the coat Tony was wearing and rest his snout over his side.
“Declarations of love aside, you should really go to him,” Jan suggested. “The poor fellow is going to think the worst and damage could be done if it’s not stopped soon. Don’t worry. We’ll stay down here and give you all the privacy. Just try not to break through the ceiling.”
Tony chuckled before pulling back to look at the beta still hugging him. “I swear, it was nothing like that. No one hurt my feelings or pushed me over the edge or anything. I wasn’t leaving the pack, I promise. I’m sorry for making you think that.”
On the first of the next year, however, Tony didn’t come back. He didn’t return on the second, nor the third. For the first month, Steve didn’t see his friend again. Not on the second or third month either. By the six Steve had given up. On the twelfth month, he wrote a letter again. He wrote to Santa to please bring him back his friend Tony.
“No, I don’t think so. Looks like you both are having a lot of fun there,” he said as he began stripping his boots, Steve’s blue coat that he carefully folded, and his waistcoat, leaving him with nothing but his shirt and pants.
Rhodey accepted his promise, considering it enough for now. A moment of silence passed over them. The rustling of the trees managed to soothe the tension Tony carried, letting it simmer down to a comfortable state. It was still present, but other matters took importance, such as his heat and only having Rhodey by his side as his apparently
“Desire holds importance, as does his health. If Anthony had not wanted to, and his body had not been fit to carry, then he would not enter a cycle that would cause him harm. To carry young when he himself carried no proper health, he would have faced complications that would have resulted in issues in his young and scarring in his body.”
“You didn’t even give the rest of us a chance,” Sam tsked and rolled his eyes. He decided on the tree next to Clint to lean on, dropping his own pack as well.
“The only question you asked him! About where he was hiding all along. Would you ask her that same question?”
Bucky stepped forward to stand next to Steve, arms crossed and face stern. “Seems the entire pack wants to tag along. We’ll have to plan accordingly and map out the area. Find the best cover.”
Now that he mentioned it, Tony did recall the many times in which their packmates referenced Steve’s declaration, but Tony would not have figured it out, even if they wrote it for him to read. He just never pictured Steve and the child as the same person, let alone imagined the child would actually keep his little promise.
Tony agreed. More souls were waking up as they talked and it was better he get a moved on back to the mansion before anyone realized he was gone. “Thank you, again. I promise to work hard. Y-you won’t regret it, I swear.”
“I… understand,” he was starting to. There was plenty he didn’t know about his packmates, he realized now. He had issues. They had issues. All of them had issues, but they continued on. Maybe… he was not so out of place with them. “We’re all messes, aren’t we?”
He went down the same path Steve had once taken him to watch the moon. He still remembered every step they took as if it had been yesterday. To think, all of that would lead him to today. How terrified he had been. How skittish. Now that he could look back to it, he could see how easily panicked he was. How little things that he now viewed as normal, had been so harmful to him in the past.
As expected Clint threw the armor in his arms on the bed and slapped his hands over his hears in a failed attempt at stopping the words.“No! Don’t want to hear it. Can’t hear anything. La la not a word.” He fled out the room soon after, slamming the door and singing in a sharp note all the way down the hall. Easily heard through the walls.
Bottom line of it was, every one of them brought in coin for the pack. Meanwhile here Tony was living off of in without giving anything in return. He couldn’t let it go on. He wasn’t a designer or an alchemist or a curse breaker, and small contracts and an omega didn’t exactly go together, but Tony had skill he could sell and an opportunity to start helping and even pay back. Hell, even Bruce was earning coin slowly, his doctor insight aiding and giving Hank a second opinion when identifying pains and illnesses. Tony was the only one not earning his keep and he had to do something about it soon. The guilt was impossible to ignore.
“Oh,” was all Tony would say. It was certainly a heartstopping moment, and Tony didn’t mean it romantically. Steve came out of nowhere!
“They…” Hank’s voice cracked, “they took action. Cornered me when I was alone. Didn’t hesitate or even looked back. We didn’t either when I was well enough to walk again. We weren't… well. Not many would be after that. Jan was broken. I was broken. We still are. That’s how Loki found us days later. He must have seen something in us worth helping, or probably felt sorry for us, but that’s how we joined the Avengers ourselves. Loki vouched and was the sole reason we are here today.” The beta’s gaze was toward the direction of the shifter mentioned. “I will say, we weren’t the greatest at first. I had fears, so did Jan. We were cautious, expected the worst. Every little move the others had done caused us to jump and every word spoken was an attack. Similar to how you started off, actually.”
had been the one in heat.” Tony covered his face with his hands and flopped back down on the bed. The youthful stamina in the alpha was cause for envy. If only Tony had a fraction of that stamina. Also, “I’m hungry.’
Tony interrupted them before their talked themselves hoarse. “It’s not that, I swear. I just don’t want to leave Bruce alone.”
“This is him. This is Tony,” Steve introduced with a smile and a hand on his shoulder. Pride in his stance and voice.
Two weeks after finally breaking through the rage and regaining control, Steve keeps himself locked in his old bedroom. Empty and unused after having moved in with his omega years prior. There’s only the bed with stiff and musty smelling covers. No clothes in the closet or drawers. Nothing in the bathroom except six rolls of toilet paper, his toothbrush and a now broken mirror.
Natasha agreed and took another. She was an angel. Coming and celebrating with Steve. Clint was an angel, too. A questionable one. He came and went directly for the food before nabbing one of the mugs and trying his best to keep up with Natasha. Now, Clint was passed out on the couch, mug still in hand and a bowl of chips impressively balanced on his chest for Natasha.
Sam appeared in front of them before they could take a step forward to the empty seats. Two plates filled with food in his hands. “What they mean to say is eat as much as you want, take your time and don’t worry, we’re just going to trade, not go across the land.”
Tony imagined that very scenario. Steve stubbornly swinging at death and batting her away with all his might. His sword and shield doing just enough to keep her at bay. He gave a breathy laugh at the very thought.
“I’m fine,” Steve barely managed. He had them moving before he could even get his wind back. Hulk followed after him without being told, keeping Tony firmly in his arm.
His heart was beating rapidly. His legs were trembling. He felt a chill from deep within his very being. Still, Tony kept a straight face, even if on the inside all he wanted to do was give in. Surrender and defeat were easier than resistance and valor. So
Steve shook his head. “I’m fully armored right now. You really think I’m going to be breaking records in this state?”
Steve noticed how Fury stressed the last part and quickly made the connection. They were currently in Sweden, the last location in the comics Tony Stark had traveled to with his companions. They were also talking about the Marvels comics and about bringing in new/old superhumans that would cause a PR nightmare.
Tony gasped at the feeling. The hand holding his length began moving now, lazily stroking from the base to the tip and back to the base again. He moaned as quietly as he could when the finger inside pressed in and rubbed slowly. Then moaned louder when both the stroking hand and rubbing finger were joined by a mouth kissing over his chest, a tongue tracing over his many scars. One particular scar directed down to his nipple and the tongue followed after it, leading the hot mouth over the nub and latching on to it to suck.
“They can’t regroup?” Tony said as he, too, peeked through the brushes to see for himself. Rhodey was right. Their entire pack was there, minus Rhodey, Hulk and himself, and while it was evident they had started close to each other, the Hydra packs were slowly but surely forcing them apart. Together they had a chance, but completely alone with a small army after them? Not even the Captain could survive that unscathed, and from the look of it Steve, Thor and Loki seemed to be receiving the brunt of the attacks.
“Not bad so far,” Tony stopped in order to avoid bumping into a random centaur that crossed their path. One quick look back to check on Peter and he continued forward. “Peter really knows what he’s doing. He’s been watching the races on screen nonstop.”
“What would you like?” Steve’s voice nearly caused Tony to jump. He hadn’t expected for the alpha to be so close to him when he asked the question and he certainly hadn’t expecting to see the determined face Steve had on.
Just Tony’s luck that their entire pack were present, wide awake and livelier than Jarvis when he’d found an entire, untouched tree full of nuts. They were all gathered in the common room, relaxing and dressed for the day. Every available spot to sit were taken. Every available soul in the house were present. Every available word Tony did
Tony shrugged. “One growled at me, but I don’t know which one. The leader didn’t actually react or anything. They just stood there, in the middle of walking, and stared at me. Nothing else.”
“I am aware of where you reside, Clinton. Slumber with a cautious eye,” Thor warned with his own wave of a fist.
The python hummed. “You are aware how magic works. Your wants and desires of the moment allow for a handle to manipulate.”
For one glorious moment Tony didn’t see anything but Rhodey. Under him, exposing his belly and licking him all over his face and making whines out of pure happiness. It was like old times when they were teens and ran through the forest together. Boundless energy keeping them playing for near hours and the hierarchy for alphas and omegas keeping them at odds with other teens.
Tony hummed, remaining in place and closing his eyes to rest them. He was just going to rest for five more minutes. Just five.
Tony reeled back as if struck at the mention of sterilizing. Betrayal in his heart at the very idea of his mate and packmate wanting to cause the very hurt he’d lived through for most of his life willingly. Daring to snuff out the little hope he had now.
With his heart on the verge of beating out of his chest, Tony slowed down, looked back just in case, and took shuddering and concerning breaths. He didn’t dare rest and kept going in a more sedated pace until he found Vision and Bruce. Vision was the first to reach him, beeping and worried for the evident state Tony was in. Bruce came next, kneeling down and holding Tony’s head up to examine his eyes and his neck, then his back, chest, and legs. That was how Tony found out that Bruce wasn’t just a man of science, but was also a doctor on the side.
“Figured that out, did you?” Tony wiggled a bit, unconsciously clenching on the knot and causing Steve to whimper. Not what he intended but he was happy with the outcome.
That had them all laughing, lightening the mood. Their laughter seemed to break through Steve for the alpha finally showed signs of life and unconsciously pulled Tony closer to him. Everyone noticed.
Behind Bruce the rest appeared, Clint being amongst the first and looking scandalized at the entire ordeal. “You,” he pointed an accusing finger at Tony, “I thought we were packmates for life. I thought we had something special, and then I go and wake up with you nowhere to be seen and no idea of where you could’ve gone and I never felt so betrayed in my life -”
“If you’re curious about the lights that’s Loki working on his spells,” Steve said when he noticed what Tony was looking at. “The tower works both as an arcade for him and as a library. If you’re ever on the hunt for Loki and can’t find him anywhere he’s likely to be in the tower. First place we look.”
“Just seeing where you were,” Tony whispered, receiving a noise of acknowledgement before he place the coat back down and covered Vision. He patted the lump the little machine created with his sore hand, taking notice how it didn't hurt as much as the day before. Cautiously, he wiggled it experimentally, and felt relieved when only the soreness made itself evident, before settling his head and pushing back slightly so he could come in contact with Bruce. The warmth of the other omega’s back eased him and the presence of the pack - of
Tony hesitated. If it already hurt with Hammer’s… and Steve proved to be far larger than him… would Tony survive the experience without adding new sets of scars to himself?
“I - yes, yes it’s beautiful,” he managed. The flush returned, but this time it wasn’t from misery. Still, even momentarily distracted he couldn’t stop his thoughts from returning back to his unstable emotions. “I’m sorry for - for what had happened. I don’t know why I… I -”
“Almost there then,” Steve said slowly, blinking to clear his thoughts. “That - that’s pretty strong. We have minutes, at least. Better hurry.” He offered the goblet to his lips. “Drink up.”
A shout of “They’re here!” had them all turning their heads. From somewhere in the distance of the common area there was a crowd gathering around in a circle. Obviously, the Avengers were truly there and none of the pack-less betas and omegas were going to move enough to let Tony and Bruce catch a glimpse without moving from their table.
Steve’s own hips pressed down on him, snuggled up perfectly against Tony’s ass and pushing out an undignified squeak from Tony as it grinded the alpha’s erection on him. Close enough that one small shift would put it just over his folds, but not where his body wanted it as heat pulsed and tried drawing the alpha in by sheer force. Steve gave a gentle thrust and caused his heated length to caress against Tony’s inner thigh before pushing against the skin right next to his cunt and keeping it there.
Steve paused his grooming for a moment. “I’ll escort him there. Two of you come with us to make sure no one gets tempted to make a move. The rest of you scout the area and finish up here.”
Tony took a sharp intake of breath, pulled his fingers away and took a step back, ignoring Steve’s stricken expression. “Will you stop already,” his voice trembled. “Stop all of this. I’m sorry, alright? Is that what you want to hear? I’m sorry! I didn’t mean to run into you. I didn’t know you were walking down the road, I couldn’t see you. I wasn’t trying to hurt you or your pack. I ran the moment I could to get out of your way.”
He was probably overthinking things, but with the pack traveling in a frustratingly slow pace because Bruce refused to shift and Tony refused to leave him as the only two-legged to travel (plus his wrist was still healing) what else was he to think? The ground they could’ve covered had Tony and Bruce shifted would’ve been farther. They’d be out of the forest by now, probably, if only they were walking on four instead of two. But they weren’t and the forest seemed never ending and Tony was absolutely certain the the Avengers were frustrated, tired and wanted to leave the two omegas behind.
She grins. She’s very beautiful doing so. “Just as it should be.” She went silent for a moment. Her eyes studied him, making a decision of his character. As his mate’s close friend and as someone their packmates have known longer she had every right to. Tony couldn’t help nervously twitching. He hoped with all his might she approved of him. Somehow it felt if she didn't Tony would be sent walking.
There was shuffling inside but the door remained closed. A careful turn of the knob revealed the door unlocked and he took a quick breath before opening it and stepping through. The sight he found made his heart break.
Then of course, because this was his life, his stomach decided to make itself known and growled in demand for food. And because Jarvis was sitting on his stomach he not only heard the full force of the noise, he also felt it and pecked back as retaliation. “It seems you’re hungry, Sir.”
pause to briefly stare. Even if Hammer had been present. Tony would have remembered that. Remembered
Once upon a time Tony’s fur had looked like that. Shiny and kept and the envy of many shifters. That had been when he was still his own person and his only worry was trying to look his best and not embarrass his father, back when Howard was still alive. Then Howard had to go and dig his own grave when one of his weapons backfired and leave Stane in charge of the Stark pack because Tony had been too young and inexperienced and an
“He spoke to me about this. A few days before you were taken,” Sam revealed. “I won’t say more. This is something you both have to talk about in private.”
They both panted heavily and from the way Tony’s heart felt, working rapidly, he was surprised it still continued to beat. More surprising was his three performances. Back when he could barely go through one without it feeling like an unwanted chore to suddenly rearing to go three times in the span of a short time? Surely there was something in the water.
What should have been half an hour to cross was covered in a matter of minutes. Tony was winded and short of breath by the time the Hulk slowed down upon reaching their destination and he wasn’t even the one running. They were just out of the town’s borders now from what Tony could see through his blurred eyes. He blinked a couple of times to clear his sight and found Steve already there in front of them and breathing heavily. He must have pushed to his absolute limit in order to have kept up with the Hulk. Tony couldn’t even see Hank anywhere yet.
Tony had expected for Steve to dig right in and eat his fill, but instead the alpha happily trotted over to him, grabbed hold of one of Tony’s sleeves (Steve’s coat that he was still wearing) and pulled him gently in encouragement to stand and head over to where the food was gathered. Tony awkwardly followed, already feeling his face heat up slightly. When the food was within reach Steve placed the arm he was pulling over the deers flank, tail wagging. Tony kneeled in order to lessen the strain on his back from bending over.
Bruce nodded in understanding. If anyone would know about others taking advantage and forcing you against your will, it was Bruce. “Know what? Don’t know what you’re talking about,” he repeated after Tony.
He groaned when one particular thrust combined with Steve rubbing the very tip of his dick sent him over the edge. His walls tightened, trying to encourage his alpha’s knot to pop and the idea of being knotted together again made his hips push back without his control, forcing his alpha to go deeper. He moaned from the sensation of Steve’s hot seed bursting in mixed with the pleasure of his own release and the feeling of triumph at having his alpha’s knot catch in his walls, locking them together. His nerves were on fire and it felt so good.
? He was dropped in so suddenly and unprepared. Thor probably meant well by trying to include him but what if the others didn't share the same sentiment? He was barging in on their time, disturbing their relaxation, interrupting them. He needed to excuse himself somehow without insulting them and without guilting them into staying.
“Master Rhodes, may I say how refreshing it is to see you again. Sir has already rejuvenated his tired bones from the mere sight of you. Surely a miracle.”
“Not so much, Boss,” Happy said, ears perked up. “Rhodes over there has been acting as our alpha leader during our search. Pretty sure at this point we might as well call ourselves a pack.”
Every bit of warriors the ladies were and with nothing to lose now they all silently agreed to wage war against the Hulk. The giant was rightfully scared. In a smart move he grabbed both Clint and Bucky and held them up to protect himself from all the watery projectiles. Everyone else not wanting to partake in this battle to the death, but were unlucky enough to get caught in the crossfire chose to use the Hulk’s massive bulk to hide. They screamed like wounded wolves when the ladies’ impeccable aim (especially by one Peggy Carter) landed. Laughter soon followed.
The cockatoo snorted again before nodding. “I believe you are correct, Sir, but young Vision is prone to picking up conversations during our travels.”
the territory clearly marked without thought but also shamelessly taking Tony from right under their noses and still holding him captive days later. So far, Tony had counted four days. Nearly a week. Considering the extraordinary people that made up the Avengers pack, it was no small feat to have their packmate hostage for so long. Especially when the packmate was the Captain’s omega.
“Search around. There has to be something here,” Tony said. “This is our last known connection. If we don’t find anything we’re back to square one.”
When feeling returned to his body Steve had finally pulled away, but not before giving one last kiss on his inner thigh. His alpha yanked his pants back up for him and gave his rear a tender, loving pat.
“Look,” Sam said before anyone else could add to the teasing, “I’m sure there’s a story to tell about all this, and it’s not any of our business, but right you need to decide on what to do about your heat. Are you good with taking care of it outside with the sun watching over you? Or would you prefer a bed and walls?”
“You’re leaving?” Clint asked in incredulity. The two betas who were in the middle of courting Rhodey now had frowns of heartbreak.
Steve nodded slowly. “I did, too. That entire time, in fact. Kind of rude not to stare at the person when you talk to them.”
Tony settled against his alpha’s side happily, listening to his pack. Relishing in the fact he could do this again after believing otherwise. Not having to worry. Not carrying any fear for himself or his pups. Just peace and rest, followed shortly with a quick wash in the pond when Steve finished his meal.
The sight of Rhodey with a traveling bag by his feet in the common room was a shock. Even more so when Pepper and Happy joined him with their own. Tony was left dumbfounded when Rhodey had said it was time for them to hit the road. Jarvis and Vision resting by his own feet were no better. They made noises of sorrow.
He didn’t feel that simmer. Only the satisfactory result of aching muscles and the need of post-coitus snuggles.
become unbalanced and release energy in an explosive fashion. A complete accident. It was something certainly worth considering.
. Bribe, pay off, sweet talk others into doing what many should have been smart enough not to do in self-preservation, including setting themselves up as bait for the Avengers. They would put many caught in the crossfire in harm’s way in order to obtain what they wanted. Consequences be damned for the hired, for the innocents in the middle and for Tony’s pack.
“I meant nothing by it,” Peggy said after seconds ticked by. Her gaze was now soft and careful. “All of you can relax.”
And that was when it clicked. Steve was using his coat as an excuse to make Tony seek him out. Of course he was. Steve wasn’t going to willingly hand over a costly item such as his coat as a gift to him. Sure the alpha had said he wanted to court him (something Tony still couldn’t believe he had heard. He must have imagined it. He should be waking up any minute now), but that didn’t mean he was going to gift Tony with expensive items.
“I thought we agreed you’d save your breath. I don’t want to hear it. My subconscious doesn’t want to hear it. Jarvis doesn’t want to hear it. Save it.”
Eventually Steve and Rhodey returned from their little talk and the pack could easily note the facade Steve was putting on as he walked in. He was trying to act nonchalantly, but there was a notable color shift on his face. Pasty white compared to his usual soft pink and those fingers of his were trembling. He appeared one of two possibilities. From the very stern talking to Rhodey had given him Steve was either seething from having another alpha talk down to him, or he was trembling from the fright of it.
He didn’t flinch when he felt Jarvis land on his shoulder. “Sir, please, believe us when we say you appear phenomenal. Captain Rogers will not be able to keep his eyes away. Neither will the residents.”
Tony covered up the gauntlets again and stood. “Come on. We’ve got plenty to pack and hardly anything done.”
Tony willed his fur away, feeling it recede and exposing his skin. He shivered when his uncovered skin coated in slick between his legs cooled under the temperature of the room. Awkward shuffling caused his wet skin to rub together in an uncomfortable manner. Kneeling on the bed helped lessen that sensation, but it caused the smell of his heat, his pheromones, to increase around him. Because of Steve’s close proximity, the alpha got a good whiff of it, needing him to shake his head in order to keep some control.
He woke up again some time later to the same warmth and heartbeat, but the smell that was Steve got mixed in with other scents. A dazed look around and he found all the Avengers had gotten closer, still in their shifted forms. Bucky was curled up next to Steve, the fur around their hips touching. Over Tony, curled up near Bruce, was Natasha, and besides Natasha was Clint and Sam tucked in together with their limbs disappearing within each other. Jan and Hank were no better with the disappearing limbs, in-between Clint and Sam and Thor and Loki. As for the latter, the lion was stretched out on his side, showing his belly to the world and the python was sprawled over the fuzzy surface, his head tucked and hidden inside the mane.
Tony couldn’t have stopped the blush that attacked his face in full force even if he tried to. The reasoning that maybe all this attention he was receiving was part of an elaborated prank returned in his head, but Tony was so starved for this that at that moment he didn’t care. He wanted to experience this for however long the prank would take, consequences be damned.
The heat in his belly grew with every second and as soon as Steve reached his hand down to stroke him Tony knew it wouldn’t take much now. He was going to reach his limit and from the way Steve’s thrust became erratic he knew his alpha was reaching his, too.
want to be titled as the shifter who was friends with the Avengers’ killer. There were too many eyes to try and escape that title.
In the direction the alphas vanished to, Tony caught sight of a golden dingo rushing through the trees and a coyote right on his tail. Sam was catching up with Hank by the second and right when it looked like he was going to pounce a mighty roar broke through the trees and out jumped Thor, catching the two under his paws. The canines gave shrieks of surprise before tumbling under Thor’s weight. Thor stood proud over them and rumbled in his success.
The three kids managed to knock the one on the floor and turned to look at him, frowning. One that seemed to be the self-appointed leader scoffed at him. “Stay out of this,
Steve remained quiet, still looking faint. Bucky poked him for a reaction. “Wake up, this is no time for your mind to go blank on us.”
someone normally say to that? He wasn’t used to it and never thought someone would willingly do so to him. After so many years of never expecting it he was unprepared and without a clue on how to proceed, but now Steve was looking at him with fragile hope and shouldn't Tony be the one with the easily breakable heart?
Fair enough, but still. One thing to have the mind fogged up from the heat and pleasure, another to be completely sober and focused and-
Another apology for apologizing so much was on his lips but a different growl, one that wasn’t so soft or well meant, started behind him. Rhodey pulled away to look at the one responsible and when Tony turned to see who it was he was met with Steve’s frown. No, not him,
Tony felt his stomach twist at that. “Don’t say that. Don’t talk about the big guy as if he’s some rabid mindless animal that needs to be put down. He’s you, Bruce. Anything that happens to him happens to you.”
Tony sighed and looked to the three shifters still awake. Bruce, even through his sleepy haze, chuckled at the situation he found himself in. Natasha and Bucky both looked at their leader and gave very exaggerated eye rolls respectfully, probably wondering why their leader was taking extreme measures and making a fool of himself for the sake of a joke.
There was a pause where Tony didn’t know what Natasha was going to do. She kept looking at him as if he was a strange specimen to be studied, and since she was an Avenger it was probably exactly what she was doing. She was studying him, trying to figure him out and probably trying to decipher why her pack leader suggested recruiting him. As a matter of fact, the rest of the Avengers seemed to be doing just that. It made Tony feel small and unworthy and all he wanted was to hide in his and Bruce’s shared shack, eating away his emotions with the seasoned rabbit.
Clint pushed the door further opened, revealing himself ready with his armor on, his bow on his back and a quiver hanging on his waist and strapped down in place on his thigh. In his arms he held pieces of armor. Hides and iron. Light in his hold, but no doubt heavier than it looked. “Came to give my old set. Even brought the good boots.”
For a brief moment, Tony actually thought about it and tried to imagine how the Hulk would go about in courting and mating with someone. The image was,
“I’m holding your hand,” Steve answered as if it was that simple. He even appeared confused by the question. “Unless you don’t want me to. I’m sorry, I should’ve asked first. I just wanted to…” Steve acted sheepish. “ I didn’t want them to say things without knowing what’s really going on.”
They weren’t given a chance to respond, let alone see the blond beta disappear through the green bushes, not when Rhodey started barking at them to hurry when the noises of gunfire began to grow louder in their surroundings. “Could really use the help in a few seconds, you two.”
Tony had believed washing along the alpha would have been awkward, or at least an odd experience. Not used to sharing time with others in the care of their bodies, for after a while Hammer had just ordered him to handle it and clean up on his own, Tony hadn't expected much in a sense of ‘comforting.’ Yet having Steve here lathering his own body and managing to casually sit naked behind him without even the slightest hint of it being sexual was strangely... warming. Made him experience new emotions.
Steve was in deep thought as he curled his fingers on a strand here and there. Tony took that moment to admire him. Admire his large blue eyes. His jaw and chin fit for an alpha of his stature. Hardly a single line of age in sight. If he focused hard enough he could see the fraction of a second where one eyelid blinked slower than the other. What an interesting quirk. He wondered if Steve was aware of it.
The barrel vanished from sight and a groan of pain told Tony he had struck the gun holder. Their friends quickly jumped to strike in revenge, prompting Rhodey to start shooting one bullet after another and for Tony to charge and shoot anything that moved.
Hesitantly, Tony uncurled and faced forward. All the raiders were down, unconscious, lifeless, and on top of them stood the biggest and most vicious looking omega Tony had ever
That was a very appealing thought, if it held truth. He somewhat wished it true, but after watching Steve chase after the blonde shifter he wasn’t so sure. He hadn’t seen a visible bite mark, but the blonde shifter wore traveling gear that covered her neck for protection. For all he knew it could be hidden, and Tony had no right to that knowledge.
Vision chirped before the two blue lights dimmed and disappeared. The yellow rune still glowing on his head.
“Hey, Captain, are you back to us?” Clint said, patting his arm in congratulations. “You have a busy future ahead of you. I don’t envy you both.”
Still, Steve managed a chuckle. “I am. I'm so determined to try. So determined to earn it, if only you'd stop thinking whatever it is you're always thinking that makes you doubt me.”
pack. It was the first day getting to know his pack without the situation of traveling. He had to make a proper impression. To somehow make an impact with his new pack mates and… and impress Steve for their walk together. Dirty and wrinkled clothing was not a great start, and walking around in nightclothes wasn’t any better, but, as much as he didn’t want to, it was his only available option. They were clean. He could pass it off as enjoying the lie in and going beyond. They’d understand, right?
Eventually, the standoff was interrupted by Bucky placing a hand on Peggy’s shoulder. Bucky’s tone stern when he said, “
Clint pulled away, appearing scandalized before shooting back and wrapping his arms around the beta. “You love my stink!”
” Tony moaned when his mate pressed all he could. His erection pulsed inside. The heat Steve’s body released overwhelming. This was new and his mind didn’t know how to fully process the new sensations, but the pleasure was pleasure and his body reacted accordingly. He thrust up, wanting more.
“Yes,” was all Tony managed to say before Steve claimed his lips again in a fierce and possessive kiss. His hands moved lower, cupping Tony’s ass and sending sparks to go right to his dick and cunt. With the grip Steve lifted him up as he stood to sit back on the bed, causing Tony to sit on his lap with his knees folded on the edge. His slit rested right over the alpha’s bulge, pushing his folds to rub ever so slightly and causing more slick to build and for some of it to leak out. He rubbed against the bulge, imagining the alpha already in him and causing the same pleasure that came from just having his dick stroked.
Tony grinned and sat across from him, picking up Vision after an irritating beep and placing him on the table’s surface. “Keep telling yourself that, Brucie. You won’t even give us a chance.”
Tony grew and took over the workshop. He improved upon it. Created what not even Thor nor Loki would have thought. Tony created the Iron Legion in order to keep the workshop operating and running with phenomenal numbers. Not even Odin could deny the improvements to the old shop. He patted Tony on the shoulder and offered a “Well done, Child,” upon first seeing the renovations.
Tony whined softly and began to slowly and hesitantly take steps back. He avoided eye contact with any of them. All of them were on edge, bodies tense, and ready to act. The smallest of noise would probably set them off so Tony tried his damnedest not to make a single sound as his paws got closer and closer to the grassy ground. Any second now something had to give, but it wasn’t any of them.
The beta nodded, then his eyes lost shine. He looked away, eyes going down to his hands again. The shift so obvious it had Tony worried for him. What had prompted it?
Vision was about to release the string of sounds again but Tony turned him away to face his stomach. “No, that’s enough from you, and don’t you dare, Jarvis.”
“Those attacks might have been a distraction, but they were still a very real threat. Stane and Hammer would have willingly burned down buildings if it meant getting what they wanted. They always get what they want.” A very real fact that Tony learned long ago.
“No,” Sam said, eyes narrowing. “It’s not that. It’s - it’s - just give him a minute. It’s not what you think. I promise.” Then Sam started shaking the alpha.
“Don’t be a fly then. Good to know,” Rhodey nodded and, deeming it safe, walked in the direction of the clearing and the fort. A loud gunshot had them all ducking, except for the Hulk, and scrambling to find cover. After a few moments had passed where only the sounds of fire continued, but no Hydra shifter jumped from the trees, Rhodey peeked his head out and separated leaves in order to see through to the clearing. He cursed at what he saw.
Eventually, Hammer did loosen his grip. Not release him, but allowed Tony to take in much-needed air. A finger began moving forward and back on his neck. Searching. Feeling. Belatedly, Tony realized Hammer was tracing Steve’s bite mark. His stomach churned at the sensation. Not at all how Steve made him feel when he ran his fingers over the old wound with care and love.
If teasing was now considered mistreating, Tony guessed they were. “Stop picking on Steve or I’ll put you all on cleaning duty for my forge.”
, his mate was there. He remembers not understanding why his mate didn’t move. Why his mate didn’t make a sound.
“We have water, but no food,” Steve looked pained to admit it. Jan passed a canteen over and Tony took large gulps of the water from it. “We rushed to get to you. We didn’t really pack for anything.”
“Did you come from a family pack full of blacksmiths?” Steve lifted his head and the pure joy and wonder in the alpha’s blue eyes was nearly blinding, and somehow simply learning something new about Tony was enough to make Steve appear like that.
“Trust me, he will kill me in cold blood, in front of the others. They will all smile and hold no regrets for it.”
Above the trees, a white feathery bird could be seen heading their way. Jarvis’ facial expressions were hard to distinguish on a good day, but Tony could see the umbrella cockatoo worried and frightened even from a distance. His head crest was extended. Anxious at having seen Tony within Hammer’s hold.
I'd really love to know what you're all thinking so far of this fic and what you're looking forward to. Do take a few minutes to do so please.
Tony took a deep, shuddering breath. Anger growing by the second. “What’s done is done and I can’t change anything about it. I can’t go back in time and stop my father from killing himself with his own creations. I can’t go back and stop my godfather from selling me.” Tears streamed down. Stinging, ugly and hot.
“Y-you left and I didn't know why and all that went through my head was that I had lost you again and it nearly broke me. You were only gone for a couple of hours but my whole world was nearly torn apart from just that.”
The other omega leaned in to whisper to him. “They're using you to make the Captain jealous and protective. He's defending
“Is he always like that?” Rhodey asked from his spot in the common room. To Tony’s growing shame everyone was present in the room, looking at him in a different light.
“There’s some towels here for you to use, some rags and different oils for you to pick from.” Steve pointed at everything mentioned. “Anything else you need?”
Tony gave his shoulder a smack. “The nerve of you to say that to a blacksmith. There’s always room for improvement. Never say it’s enough.”
Sam waited for them to stop before he continued. “Even if Nat wanted to kill you she'd have to get through Steve first. On Top of that I don't think killing the friend of the person you're trying to court will make a good impression.”
“Luckily for you we’re here. No need for rod making,” Clint flicked his tail and posed. Turning to Sam he said, “Whoever catches the most fish wins.”
By the time Hattan started ascending in the distance the sun had moved enough for the early souls to start making an appearance. Businesses were opening and workers were starting their trips to their professions with either obvious annoyance or forced cheeriness. No one appeared to be a morning person.
Without being invited in the door opened and inside came Bucky, his best friend with the very attractive robotic-like arm that he always claims lands him the ladies, but really he only wants to constantly remind Steve that, while Steve was the only planned supersoldier, he didn’t have the cool arm.
To think the Avengers had set up their home so close to Hattan. All those opportunities where he could’ve had the chance to meet them earlier. Maybe, if that had happened, he could’ve escaped from Hammer sooner and Steve could’ve been interested in him with less years on his back. That was if Steve still had the same interests back then.
Tony was no fool. Not when his anxiety was lacking in crippling him. He understood clues and cues and he followed Steve’s choice of words closely. He had an idea of what the alpha was implying, but the idea was so outlandish to him. For an alpha to propose a switch so willingly to him? Yes, he had heard of multiple pairs doing the very same. Tony was no stranger to talks and he listened to more than a few shameless shifters talk about their sexual exploits, but what those exploits all had in common were the orientations of the pairs.
“The Avengers,” Tony said as casually as he could without giving himself away, even though inside he was fighting to jump up and follow after the youngsters.
Tony pulled the coat away from his face and played with the sleeves, bringing one close to smell. “Are you going to join?” he repeated the earlier question.
He grabbed the very gauntlet on top. Heavier than he remembered, but already he was running alterations through his head to make them lighter yet sturdier at the same time. If he were to add a sharper edge on the surface he could shift the gauntlet to include physical combat as well. With a rune to keep it permanently sharpened and another to make it as durable as steel he could easily slice through layers of chain and leather armor without it wearing out.
The sounds of Hulk’s heavy breathing, his large claws scratching the ground and Steve and Hank’s footsteps slowly lessening accompanied him all through the run down the road.
The need and heat coursed through his body, demanding that pleasure that would make his nerves sing under Steve’s touch. He answered with a whispered “yes” and that was all Steve needed before he rolled them over, pressing Tony flat against the bed on his stomach and lifting his hips lightly. Tony half expected Steve to just thrust in, and in all honesty he wouldn’t have minded it so much. He trusted Steve. Even if he were to go rough somehow he knew his alpha wouldn’t actually hurt him. Instead, Steve continued to trail kisses all across his shoulders, holding his weight up with one arm while the other caressed along his hip and down his thigh before coming back up, repeating the motion over and over again.
Being mocked aside Tony was thankful the alpha had woken up in such a great mood, compared to the mood he had gone to bed with. No doubt the worry was still present, and the fear, but the fact that Steve had mentioned the armor without much struggle showed he was accepting it instead of fighting against it.
In the middle of the omegas was a tall alpha not yet introduced to the public, but holding himself as if he'd been part of the Avengers pack for years and was heading to yet another fight. He seemed to treat it like old hat, radiating ‘military’ every step of the way and didn't appear bothered by the idea of heading to danger one bit, having been trained for it most likely.
Tony Stark lived a very promiscuous life. Often, the first thought that came to mind at the mention of his name was his very sluttish behavior. It was no secret he had sex. It was on his title, under his resume, probably in some autobiography someone was currently writing and listed on the very top of his wiki page.
“Exceptional, Sir,” Jarvis said without even looking at him, probably annoyed from having repeated the same answer over and over. Vision had stopped whistling in agreement and instead rocked back and forth in impatience.
At least he mastered his skills of hiding behind his mask. He refused to give Hammer the satisfaction of a reaction. The alpha received plenty of those during their beginning years together and got too much enjoyment from it. Tony wasn’t going to let him enjoy it for all of twenty years.
“Well the only other thing to talk about is the pack contract. Which is work. I'd rather talk about this.” His damn second in command shrugged with that same lack of sympathy. Then his words finally caught up with Tony and he had to stop everything for a second as it sunk in.
He asked if he could stay. Promised to be of help and never be a burden. Promised them everything, just please allow him to stay.
No gauntlets. No armor. If they attempted to call for help there was no knowing what Hammer or Stane would order their pack to do to them. The idea of Pepper getting hurt because of
His ears flinched when he felt another flick, this time over his hip. He cautiously looked up when he felt a third flick and managed to catch Hank’s tail responsible. Hank didn’t say a word, but his expression said it all. Guilt, regret, hesitation. Tony hadn’t known how to react. Hank was to apologize, according to Jan, and Tony had wanted to prevent it, undeserving of it, but if he were to say something now as Hank built himself up it would seem ungrateful on his part.
Checking the time, a quarter to 2400, Steve was surprised it had gotten that late. He always lost track of time when he read the comics. He was to be scheduled for a morning departure tomorrow/today and he knew he needed to get an early night's rest but a feeling of nostalgia decided to hit him and he had this burning urge to read the comics again. He told himself it was only going to be one but one quickly turned to two and two to three and - really, there was no way he could only read one comic. It just wasn’t the same.
What Tony would give to be able to sleep like them right now. He usually could. Having Jarvis and Vision so close to him always made him feel content and he’d get knocked out the moment he closed his eyes, but after all the excitement that occurred and the conversation he had with Steve, well, it was safe to say he wasn’t sleeping for a while.
A bubbling rage from the dragon built up in Tony’s chest but he ignored it as best as he could. He needed answers and this might have been it. Clearly this hydra knew what they were and what had happened. “You know what has happened then,” it wasn’t a question.
There was only one way to get his answers and that was to walk right back to the alpha, and there was no way Tony was doing that. Never again. He was perfectly fine with never seeing the alpha or his pack again. One experience was good enough, thank you.
This was no different. If Tony tried calling for his pack, Hammer would respond accordingly by causing as much damage as he could before any of his packmates made it to them. Pepper would be hurt. Perhaps retain an injury beyond healing. Could possibly be killed in Hammer’s last stand. Tony couldn’t let Pepper get hurt because of him.
Thankfully none of them continued to tease him as they reached their (still empty) shack. He made a beeline for his pack, placed Vision next to it and adjusted his make-shift bed of blankets and his dried coat… that he was not wearing right now… he was holding his coat and wearing…
His teammates, who are doing their duty for the people, sacrificing their lives in order to stop the rampaging beast that used to be their leader. Who used to be the public’s hero. Who used to be Captain America.
Bruce quickly got the hint and looked apologetic. “Sorry, Jarvis. I wasn’t thinking. I keep forgetting you’re not actually a shifter.”
He was finished, he was tired and he was ready to take every memory tainted by Hammer, pile it together and burn to the ground for the wind to take the ashes as far away from him as possible. He let his tears fall, let the memories under Hammer’s name slide out with every drop and wiped them away harshly, erasing them to never be brought forth again. This moment was about Tony and Steve only and Tony refused to let Hammer ruin it further. He wasn’t going to compare, he wasn’t going to believe, not until he experienced it with his pack, his family, and with Steve.
Before long Jan and Hank returned with sticks in their mouth. They went back and forth from the spot they were resting to where the rest of the wood was apparently located. A fair sized camp fire was established soon enough and all they were missing was the improvised rock pans to start cooking. Those who were in their canine and lion forms quickly split the fish among the Avengers, creating piles all around, and waited patiently. When Bucky gave them the sign to go ahead they dug into the fish ravenously.
Against his will Tony imagined how that would look and felt genuine fear at the - probably exaggerated, but what if it were true? - size and became distressed for Thor’s mate.
“Aye,” Thor included, now seeming to be towering on his two legs. “Your disappearance had caused a great rift within our pride and much heartbreak for our leader. Loki, as well, had shared in our misery.”
“Did they leave without you?” Tony hadn’t meant to make it sound as if the pack had abandoned Loki, but that was essentially what they did… right?
Rhodey’s gaze bounced between the betas. “Well, how about you hold that thought for a moment. I’ve got someone who will want to hear this.”
Tony hummed. He didn’t recall Steve ever saying so, but maybe he had just forgotten? Or it was a statement said passing by?
“I brought with me the answer to our Captain’s brooding and these are the thanks I receive?” A hiss. “I thought you better, Clinton. It is rude to talk about our guests in such a manner.”
Tony smiled. “You promised to always protect those who need protecting?” It was very much like Steve to promise something along those lines. It was probably the reason for his title as The Captain.
Seeing as most of the pack was already sitting Tony guessed, if there was any particular order they sit in, they were already set and the available space that completed the circle was for them to sit in any arrangement they wanted. Still, since he and Bruce were strangers to the pack it was only polite to wait until one of the pack members invited them to take a seat, just in case they wanted them somewhere specific.
It had been Bucky that kept Steve restrained as the sedative strong enough to knock Thor out and tire the Hulk ran through Steve, eventually putting him to sleep.
Tony scrambled to stand out of respect, and was very conscious of his appearance. If he was nervous with Peggy and Sharon staring at him, he was
“Can we stop talking about my best friend and sex in the same sentence? There are things I'm perfectly fine with not knowing,” Rhodey groaned and covered his face.
The softest, fondest, smile he’d ever seen graced Steve’s lips. His blue eyes shined with so much emotion Tony feared he might burst from it. “One day,” Steve agreed. “Right now this is about you.” Without warning, he tilted his head back and drank the entire bottle in one swing. No hesitation and no worry. He had so much faith in Hank.
Loki lifted the staff high in the air and striked to the direction of the cart. The wood gave a creak and shuddered as the handles straightened out and remained perfectly horizontal to the ground. Watching the entire movement Tony could’ve sworn the wheels of the cart lost tension, lost the pressure the cart placed on them, as if somehow it had gotten lighter. Sam going higher along with it only confirmed his study.
The beta hissed in pain, “You little -” and kicked Vision with his other foot, causing the little machine to whine in pain.
That didn’t exactly give anything for Tony to go on but it didn’t appear as if the omega was going to share any more than that. For now, he decided to leave it alone. Instead, he reached out a hand to shake. If they weren’t going to introduce themselves as wolves, might as well do it in the human way. “Tony,” he paused briefly, debating on which surname to include. It had been years since the last time he presented himself as a Stark. Now, since there was no Hammer, this would be the first social step to freedom. He could do this. He
The sun was fading, the travel had been long and, according to Clint and Sam, who have been talking nonstop about wanting to bathe the moment they made it home, the Avengers’ house was minutes away and all Tony wanted to do was find something soft and just lie down on it. Didn’t matter if it was a bed or a rug, so long as it was softer than the ground Tony was going to get knocked out on it.
“We talked about what this meant. She knows it’s serious, between you and me, and she’s hurt… but -”
Steve repeated those words over and over again to the point of creating a mantra. He didn't slow down and he didn't stop trembling, not until Tony calmed enough that his heart wasn't painfully beating heavy in his chest. Steve wasn't irritated anymore, wasn't even smelling close to how he was not five minutes ago. He smelled
Steve was jealous of him. He wished he could show off his own genius, but Tony would never willingly piggyback on him. Tony wasn’t even out cold yet either. The genius was on the other side of the room, laughing and chatting with the Colonel. Both flushed and both leaning against each other to remain standing. Miss Potts was also there, sleeping soundly on a loveseat next to them. She had stopped by to personally wish them well wishes and give gifts but made the mistake of spotting the table full of drinks and snacks and there was no going back.
“You know being able to work with runes is a rare and valuable gift, right? A war pack like the Avengers would benefit greatly from it.”
“Can you promise me that, Omega? Promise me to give me what I want? I’m not asking for much. Just return what you took from me. Make it better. It’s only fair.” Hammer leered at him. The smile was still there. “My, my, I will admit, you may have embarrassed my name by leaving, but I have to give the Avengers credit where credit is due. You fill out
, was something that didn’t belong in the same sentence with Tony. He’d rather the alpha ignore him and pretend he didn't exist, no matter how hurtful it would be. False hope was the cruelest thing imaginable.
The pack was kind enough to continue without commenting on them or what was said. “So no going through the west side,” Steve concluded, “and the south is out of the question for those without Loki’s spells. How many were spotted patrolling the area?”
This was the special order Ben and May had requested. It was catered to Peter and only Peter for you see, his boy had taken an interest in carriage driving after watching it on television. Something about the sport caught his boy’s little eyes. The child couldn’t stop talking about it after.
Tony considered the words, engraved them in his mind and headed back to his room. Even though the entire interaction left him emotionally drained and even reopened a few of his old scars he found himself almost inspired, confident, and ready for something different. He had a small bounce to his steps as he reached his room.
going to help.” With a wave of his fingers, the two beta guards standing the closest moved in quick succession, grabbing Pepper by her arms and covering her mouth with a cloth. She kicked and shoved against her captors, struggling in their hold. Tony made a grab for them, ready to bite their disgusting meat hooks off her when Hammer lunged forward in an uncharacteristic move. He seized Tony’s arm harshly with one hand and held him by the neck with his other. In a panic, Tony tried yanking off the offending arm on his neck but it only served to cause him harm. No doubt creating a bruise. Hammer squeezed tighter in warning, making it worse.
“You did,” Steve shook his head. “You did. I didn’t notice what I was doing. I should have, but I didn’t. I was controlling you when I promised myself I would never -” his voice cracked. “I’m sorry.”
He appeared as calm as he could, but on the inside panic had already set in. His chest constricted. Adrenaline pulsed through his veins.
Sneaky alpha. It seemed Tony was going to indulge him after all. It was only right that Tony returned the coat, even if he didn’t have a proper answer to Steve’s question.
Somewhere in the town, the sound of a pin dropping echoes, reaching to their room. Everyone respectfully kept quiet except for Vision, who made a long drawn out note. With no response coming to mind to what was stated all Tony could do was pull the outspoken cockatoo into a much-needed hug. Both as an apology and to reassure himself. Vision joined the hug seconds after, feeling forgotten.
Jan nodded in disappointment. “We can’t risk living smack in the middle of settlements in case enemies attack us personally in our own den. We don’t want to put the citizens in danger or cause property damage, but it is a struggle.”
He had woken up groggy and disoriented like every shifter and wild animal usually tended to do. His mind didn’t catch up with his surroundings, but his memories were clear as day and he remembered the visit to town, Ben giving him work, Steve coming to his rescue and their pack congratulating him. Too good to be true so naturally he had thought it all a dream and his heart sank. That was until he heard a sniffle on top of him and he found himself nose to nose with Steve’s sleeping wolf form. Then his mind caught up and all around him were the Avengers in their shifted forms, minus Bruce.
Tony moved quickly to search for him. He didn’t know why Steve would grab the hat and he certainly hoped it wasn’t because the wild centaur suddenly grew a desire to wear cotton shirts and denim. Peter held on tight on his back. Tony was careful not to jostle him too much. Least he wanted to catch a falling child.
Loki’s lips turned upward in response. A menacing grin for sure. “Indeed. Do as I say and we will have all these canines soaring in the air from fright. Even this feline as well.”
“Tony,” Jan appeared remorseful. She held her head and ears down. “What happened back there, I’m sorry.”
“Is that… is that what you’re trying to tell me? Do you want me to go after someone else because you don’t want me to court you? Because I’ve told you before I’m serious about you. How many times do I have to say it?” There was a heavy underlayer of emotion in Steve’s voice. Emotions bordering on irritation. Even if Tony couldn’t have heard it he could’ve smelled it. Under the layers of scents that made Steve smell like Steve there was a sharp and bitter layer that Tony knew all too well to associate with irritation that eventually led to anger.
Steve took notice how the dirt sticking together created a tunnel wide enough to drive a truck through and many agents were carefully avoiding coming into contact with the dirt. He also noticed the deeper they went in the tunnel the more agents were wearing twice as much clothing in an attempt to stay warm. Puffs of smoke released from his mouth as the temperature dropped and he made a mental note to complain to Peggy about secrecy preventing a forewarning to bring something warm to a freezing location.
His searching must have caught Steve’s attention for his alpha gave a questioning look. “Something wrong?” Tony barely heard him over the loud clattering of dishes and the loud and cheery voices of their pack and friends.
“Nothing. Just tired and a little hungry,” which had been true, before he saw his mate walk out the door. Now, his hunger had gone and nausea had taken over.
A male beta standing nearby and listening in to their conversation cut in. “That one omega don’t even look like he
“Be calm, my friend. Your beloved has been watched for, but you mustn’t enter in your distressed state. You shall cause more harm than good. Come, let us -” Thor’s voice faded away as steps were taken to signal their departure.
Vision released a high sound in offense. Tony plucked the little machine from the floor, holding him easily. He patted his head in comfort. “Will you both listen if I asked you to remain with Pepper and Happy here?”
“Tony,” Tony’s heart fluttered from the way the alpha had said his name, It sounded so gentle, so soft. It calmed him. “Stop me if this is too forward, but tomorrow the pack hadn’t planned for anything. It’s our rest day. Would you like to take a walk with me? I could show you around our territory. Take you to the lake.”
He hesitated. Of course he would. He had stopped touching himself years ago after it became evident the only pleasure he was to receive came from his own hands. It was a sad thought, and one that worsened the feeling of loneliness every time he did it. To save himself from anymore unneeded heartache he stopped altogether and neither him nor his body ever gave it a second thought, until now.
So I actually tried finishing this chapter up for the 12th, but ultimately couldn't make it. Three days late isn't that bad, right?
“Were you to hold it in instead? Ah, surely that is it. You are to simply stand there and allow others to speak over you with no consequence. You are a carpet meant for others to walk on and nothing more.”
It was odd. Steve and Peggy had been nothing but friendly and courteous to each other. Steve welcoming her back like the old friend she was and Peggy naturally inserting herself into the dynamic of the pack. It had all been smiles and unity. No troubles. No mishaps. No arguments. Nothing so outlandishly different that would cause splits within packmates.
Tears were evident this time as he submerged himself in the tub. The water reached just below his chest, still exposing the scars for his eyes to see. He scrubbed at them, trying to get rid of the sensation of Steve’s tongue running over the raised surface that his mind had made up. It didn’t help.
The Hulk turned to him with eyes gleaming and a grin slowly forming. Sharp teeth shined under the light.
When the day finally came that Tony saw the real reason behind Bruce’s hesitation, well, he couldn’t really blame the guy for behaving the way he had. Tony would’ve done the same thing.
Vision went directly to where Clint and Sam had been standing a few seconds ago, but instead of the two betas standing on two legs, there was a freshly shifted jackal and coyote shaking their furs and licking each other's’ snouts. On the spot where Thor had been standing was a sight that took Tony’s breath away. There was a giant, golden lion with spots of dark on his mane. He was yawning and shaking his fur and the reason for Thor smelling odd suddenly clicked in Tony’s head. Thor was a Feline Shifter, or more specifically he was a
It was wrong of him and could only end with Steve heartbroken, the Avengers angry and Bruce disappointed, but just for a little while longer he wanted to keep experiencing joy. Already the pack had made him feel lighthearted. The most content he had been in years. For however long he could he wanted to keep experiencing it.
“Maybe to just defend our territory?” Tony gestured around them. They had reached the same body of water Steve had shown him once. The sight was still as beautiful as ever. Green, clear and healthy. “Wouldn’t you fight for this until the end?”
, leader of said pack, court him and have as a mate kept repeating in his head. He’d have to wake up any minute now. Stuff like this never happened to him.
Which was why it didn’t come as a surprise that Bruce was included to their little traveling circle and hardly put up a fight joining them when Tony decided it was time to trade shacks for another further north and located close to a city. Living in the wilds was fair and doable as a wolf, but since Bruce never shifted and absolutely
That hope grew ever slightly more with her persistence. Sooner or later she’ll run him down with it until believing her was all he’d have left.
“See that you are. Just for that, you’re getting extra hours on Vision-duty. I’m putting you in charge of Vision during my hunt and for the rest of the day.”
Tony choked when he swallowed wrong, caught off guard by the last question. Jan patted his back in sympathy. “You know Steve will sooner hide your body than allow you to bribe Tony into being your mate with your food. No matter how great it tastes.”
Because they placed most of their focus trying to throw the other off Tony managed to pull off a full minute of running and almost reached a second before he felt someone pounce on him from his left and made him roll on the ground.
Bruce and Natasha were back to talking amongst themselves, or talking as much as they managed. Natasha said a word, Bruce followed it up, silence, another word, Bruce chuckled nervously and continued rubbing his hands.
Just so happened it was his neck that gave in. He had his head on Steve’s shoulder that had a couple of inches of height on him and forced it in an upward angle, straining his neck. He pulled back just enough to level it. His movement prompted Steve to also pull back and just remain there and stare at him, eyes still a little bit red from crying and yet soft and elated. He continued staring, so much so that Tony felt himself blush from the intense gaze that wouldn’t stop.
“Perhaps. It all falls on your perspective,” Loki kept the front of his body upward. It gave him an eerie look. “During the confrontation, you stated you couldn’t have entered your cycle, and yet what we all scent says otherwise. Why did you believe so?”
Steve pulled himself to sit upright. His eyes were soft and his voice calm. “How long did your heats used to last?”
“Are you finally going to tell us what this is about? We’re being assigned to something without a single idea of what’s going on,” Bucky said with a huffed that created a large puff of smoke.
“I’ve been with them for nearly half a year now, and I still haven’t told Steve about my little problem.”
Clint openly eyed the Hulk. His eyes trailed up and down, getting every detail he could. “That is… impressive.”
“Yeah, yes I do.” He sighed again. The hesitation and fear was still present, but the smallest of hope of everything turning out just fine built up. “What am I going to say?”
“We’ll have to do it quick then. There’s no point if they all come out before we can. If they sound the alarm it’ll be all hands on deck.”
He said it softly, mostly to himself, but some of his packmates had heard him and tore their gazes from the newcomer to him.
“What did someone do to change your mind? Was it Steve? Clint? So help me if someone insulted you -”
“Then it is a good thing I know exactly where they are heading,” said a voice that was created almost of pure hissing.
It was one of the reasons why he was currently walking around the common area near the shacks on two legs. He wasn’t the only one
One of which, who had been present near the start, was making her way to him now. Pepper. Beautiful as ever and a light that couldn’t be ignored.
“Why ever not?” Jarvis looked genuinely confused and even Vision emphasized the question by repeating the tone.
He turned and followed after his family. May was no longer holding his harness, leaving Tony to follow on his own. He kept up no problem, but the crowd did pose a challenge. Human, faun and centaur often got in his way and with a carriage still strapped on him, he couldn’t easily maneuver around them. He had no choice but to stop often. This caused him to be farther than what his boy was comfortable with.
“Then it’s settled. Agents Rogers. Barnes and Carter are to be responsible for our little comic characters. I’ll let you decide among yourselves who to take.”
For this chapter, nothing but Steve and Tony appreciating each other and acting silly, but they're finally starting the contract now.
That was an insult if Tony ever heard one from Jarvis and he sneakered. Jarvis wasn’t going to outright bring out his guns since the beta, or any of the Avengers, hadn’t done anything to earn his wrath, but being a bird didn’t mean he was going to take that kind of talk sitting down. From the way the beta had his mouth opened and the others were all looking equal parts amazed and amused he figured they weren’t expecting it.
Once upon a time, he thought he had been worth all that and more, but now? Now, Tony understood the lengths needed to support the ones you love and the little white lies required to make it happen.
Accepting his fate Clint shifted, his fur breaking through the skin and his bones changing. The dirty golden jackal Tony remembered from the previous night shook his fur and gave his tail a wag. The brown dingo that was Jan ran up to him and gave a pounce. The golden lion that could only be Thor followed soon after, knocking them both down in his excitement. They looked like they were about to start a wrestling match when a large dark brown wolf appeared and barked for them to stop.
He gifted Tony a tour of his father’s Midgardian workshop. The very place where Odin created the gifts to have delivered every year.
“I would love to say he’s lying and we don’t actually get scared with his tricks, but what he lacks in running compared to us, he more than makes up for in jumping down from trees and scaring the fur clean off of us,” Clint grumbled, crossing his arms over his chest in a huff.
Tony had to hold back laughing so hard when Sam's and Clint’s extravagant attempts of the hour failed spectacularly when Rhodey completely missed the point.
Steve groaned from the sensation, encouraging Tony to try on his own and lift his hips to repeat the motion. Tony's own pants trapping his dick made it very uncomfortable and straining to move smoothly, but the fabric rubbing against his slit more than made up for the effort put. He felt a small amount of slick form and bring with it the smell of lust-filled omega into the air. Steve outright moaned at that, giving a low growl of want. He pulled away from Tony’s lips to kiss the side of Tony’s neck, nipping with his lips. Tony could practically feel the alpha strain from doing something, the body under him tensing up.
Without even waiting for a confirmation Tony grabbed hold of Steve’s face and pulled him in for a fierce kiss, pouring all his emotions into it. He was thankful, grateful, for everything and he didn’t know how to even
This was - this was his territory, too. He didn’t know how such a small thing, a simple word, could make him feel so emotional, but damn was it happening.
“The closest town is miles away from here,” Sam informed. Redwing, perched on his shoulder, seemed to nod along with this statement.
To be honest not all of them were glaring. Most of them had green faces of envy while others tried their best to show they were indifferent by very obviously turning their heads to ignore them. The ones that were staring with spite were very few, but their angered eyes made it feel as if there were twice as many.
Tony moaned and unconsciously pushed back to get more of the sensation it created, wanting that finger to go deeper. He pulled away from Steve’s marking when a second finger entered and with shaking arms held himself over the alpha, taking note of the flush on his cheeks and the blue of his eyes barely visible from the pupils blown up in lust. The sight made Tony preen.
When his stomach released another outcry and the feeling of being deprived of food after regularly feeding since joining the Avengers very discomforting it was decided he’d have to risk it. Now, how to remove the arm that felt like a binding at this point without stirring Steve up? Trying to pull at the wrist was no help as it prompted the arm to tighten even more and for Steve to pull him closer, burying his face against the back of his neck and shoulders. A smile pulled on Tony’s lips as the thought of Steve unconsciously not wanting to let him go crossed his mind. It probably wasn’t the actual reason, Tony had no way of knowing, but he could dream.
Hulk took two massive steps forward. Under direct sunlight, it was easy to note the dark fur he carried and, curiously enough, the almost greenish tint to it. Standing before them Hulk easily towered over the two, forcing them to crane their neck in order to see eye-to-eye.
The cool of the water was refreshing and helped soothe the heat in his belly momentarily. Without meaning to, he drank more than half and caught himself releasing a whine when Steve pulled the goblet away. “Easy. Don’t give yourself a stomach ache. You have to eat something, too.”
“Well, you called him an it,” surprisingly it was Steve that answered. “Last I heard, calling someone an 'it' is disrespectful and insulting.”
Jan smiled. “All the alphas are downstairs getting the plan together. Sam, Clint and Loki included because they’re just stubborn like that. Hank actually sent me to pass this along. Says I do better with conversations like this when really he has the social capability of a drunken ant.”
While Steve left lingering kisses and marks on his neck Bucky was busy actually inviting Rhodey, Pepper and Happy. “We talked about it and we agreed the three of you would make great additions to the pack. What do you say? You’ll have to put up with
, no, how would it be possible? If it had only been Bruce then it wouldn’t be a problem. Bruce would just have to only mate in human form and not get the option to spice it up in bed with his four legs. However, this was two in one body, both Bruce
In the meantime Tony was caught by surprise to see Steve… pouting. That couldn’t be. Tony blinked twice but no, that was an actual pout the leader of the Avengers was sprouting.
Tony blinked and it all vanished. Steve was there again with the same toothy smile but no missing teeth. The round face was now sharp. Eyes smaller but just as blue and staring at Tony a little puzzled.
A whine threatened to escape from his throat. It seemed Tony wasn’t the only one damaged. He didn’t know if that was a good thing or bad.
No, he shouldn’t think that way. Thinking like that was dangerous. It built up faith that would only be destroyed in the end, crumbling down in a matter of seconds after taking days to create. After years of it happening Tony had learned to never get his hopes up, and he wasn’t about to let it happen now.
The reveal didn’t seem to bother Steve. “I do. It’s a little different from what we’ve done so far, but the idea is still the same. You just lie there and I’ll do all the work for now. We’ll find what we enjoy together.”
“Easier said than done,” Tony whispered back then stopped in his tracks when one of the shifters, among the few that were glaring, dared to stand in their way.
He curled around himself. There was a rational reason why he couldn’t do a thing. Fighting against Hammer and Stane and their pack alone was not ideal without his gauntlets. Even then it was cutting it close. Hammer’s pack had no qualms firing their pistols at anything. At most Tony would be able to punch once before a bullet pierced him. Taking him and his child down.
Tony felt his smile disappear. He cleared his throat and looked away, a bit shamefaced. If he had been in his wolf form his ears would currently be down. “I ran into a pack while chasing the last rabbit. Stopped right in front of the alpha leader and rubbed noses with them.”
Tony was left stunned at the sight he was seeing. The surface of the water shined under the rays of the sun and the small waves created by the wind gave it the effect of flickering stars under the evening sky. Yellow, orange, blue and purple colored that very sky over the trees in the distance. The water reflected those colors and twinkled those stars and it was perhaps the most beautiful sight of nature Tony had seen in a long time. It was almost too beautiful to be looked at by him, but even if he tried to leave or turn away Steve was making it extremely difficult to do so.
The conversation was loud from up the stairs but hushed down to a whisper until it slowly stopped completely when Rhodey and Tony reached the meeting spot. Everyone turned to look at them. Eyes full of questions at their presence. Tony shrunk down at their gazes. Thankfully Rhodey didn’t seem bothered at all.
Tony stared dazedly at the plate of delicious smelling cakes. He just wanted to sink his teeth in it and lick up the entire plate, but even as the others stressed the welcoming he still hesitated. He couldn’t. Not until the others took the first bite.
In his and Steve’s shared room the gauntlets were the first thing he packed once he found his traveling bag. Tucked safely inside he got to work adding what he thought was required. Sets of clothing, naturally. Shirts and pants and a coat for the freezing nights and cold mornings. Of course summer was right around the corner, so while the nights weren’t torturous low temperatures, one could never be too warm.
“Not if I get to it first,” Sam countered, “and even if you somehow beat me I’m just going to push you off.”
. A chance at a child was now a possibility rather than a desperate fantasy. He had a wonderful and sweet mate, Jarvis and Vision were still with him, he had a pack with his best friends, he had a home and more.
Steve kissed his shoulder. “Stop overthinking it, Sweetheart. If you don't want us to bathe together just say so. I'm not obligating you, just asking permission.”
“Better yet,” the blond continued as the tip of Tony’s erection touched skin, “instead of sitting on my shield. How about sitting on my face?” Tony gasped and grabbed at the blankets around him blindly as a warm and tight heat slowly engulfed his dick. “Your slick smeared all over my face. Let it drip down my neck as I lick you up clean. Would you ride my face the same way you’d ride my dick?”
Sam sat up to get a view of Steve and Tony. “Ignoring Loki insulting us, I’ve been hearing the folks in Hattan spread Iron Man around. Everyone is calling you that over there. Don’t know how it started or who even made up the name, but I’m betting they got the idea thanks to your smithing skills. Working with iron probably did it.”
Belly not so full but not starving either Tony was set to join his pack for a travel for the first time. Outside they all made their way. Jarvis at one point joining him on his shoulder and Vision sitting comfortably in a bag held by Rhodey. Pepper and Happy followed them outside but didn't join them further than the front door. They waited patiently while Steve ordered everyone to double check their items, made sure everyone was well and prepared and gave a quick speech for morale sake.
straight into a pack was shock, disbelief, worry, and in Bruce’s case that involved being friends with the shifter, belated terror.
He would have remained on the bed if not for a stubborn cockatoo who was adamant on getting him up and going and a roly-poly machine who wanted to get the day started.
Contrary to Tony’s belief, he had some fond memories with his old pack. That was to say he didn’t have them
Tony suddenly got the urge to take the coat off, throw it at the nearest tree and speed-walk as far away from the Avengers as possible. Of course before he could even comprehend what the first move required to take off the coat the golden wolf with the blue eyes that could have only been Steve was right in front of him, face to face, and had a fish in his mouth somehow and held it out for him to take. Blindsided, Tony reached for it out of reflex, gaping at what was occurring. For a leader of a pack such as Steve, offering his food only ever happened to those he considered mate. In shifted form the leader always ate first, followed by second and third in command and then by alphas outside the chain, then betas and finally omegas. The leader only ever shared their meal during their turn with their mate, or mates.
And now he was going to get tainted worse than he already was. The Avengers were never going to bother with him again and Steve… Steve wasn’t going to even look at him.
. I can’t give him any children. Pups for him to dote on, to rock to sleep, for him to be a great father to,” he hadn’t meant to but the frustration slipped into his tone.
Nearly all at once everyone howled to the sky and Tony soon joined them after his second skin and his fur took full form. He howled loud and howled until all the air left his lungs and then nearly jumped in surprise when a roar accompanied their howls. The roar could have only come from Thor and the image of a lion roaring with a pack of canines was something Tony needed to see. He rounded the tree he hid himself behind and admired the view of his pack mates all facing upwards, standing tall and proud and howling and roaring together.
It was survival of the fittest. In Tony’s case especially so. He may have been old but that didn’t mean Tony wasn’t light on his feet. He wasn’t walking around with a stick and he wasn’t sitting for hours on end nursing his tired bones. He could still run, he just wasn’t the fastest compared to all these shifters with less years on their backs. He couldn't last long chasing prey with the way his chest constricted. He could still hunt, more or less. He could hunt as well as a wolf shifter could hunt on his own with his health issues, but considering he was hunting in territory occupied by dozens and dozens of young, packless shifters his chances were limited. Most would have already caught their game and scared the rest away by the time he reached hunting grounds. Tony was lucky if he managed to catch three rabbits.
Get ready for an overdue talk, lots of gross emotions, past reveals and a long-awaited character that should've been introduced a long time ago.
To the side both Sam and Loki exchanged glances, understanding each other’s pain it seemed. Tony had to wonder how long the two had been mated with the pair that were currently bickering because it appeared to be a constant occurrence they learned to ignore. At least he wondered how long Clint and Sam had been mated. Clint didn’t exactly do a good job hiding it. Thor and Loki, however, he couldn’t tell what the two were to each other. They appeared closest, but didn’t exactly show open affection besides embracing, and that was usually interpreted in many different ways.
“That’s great, Tony.” Steve sounded genuinely happy for him. His tail even wagged with excitement. “I’m sure Ben will give you reasonable work. May keeps him level headed so there’s no unfair treatment there.”
“Sir,” Jarvis said softly as he perched on one of Tony’s arms and tucked himself against his neck, comforting him.
Brown eyes locked on blue. Blue growing softer the longer they stared. Then worry etched itself around them. “Remember your promise, Tony.”
Both Tony and Bruce stopped what they were doing and looked around. They noted how the other betas and omegas were tripping over themselves trying to head to the same direction. They spoke as if someone incredible was present in the shacks, but who exactly was worth all the hype for?
, because his past wouldn’t leave him alone and because he and Pepper had the terrible luck of getting caught away from their home and from their pack. The alpha leader’s omega and a den beta alone and on their own against Hammer and his - his
Steve remained by the door, uncertain. “I know we didn’t talk about this beforehand and this is very short notice, but what would you prefer I do? I can keep watch out the door if you don’t want me here with you.”
Tony jumped, his nose picking up more than what the fire and metal had to offer. The faint scent of alpha leaked through the ashes and grease and all at once any hope he had at obtaining work disappeared in an instant. He had hoped that the blacksmith was a beta, prayed really, so he was given a chance to try. But if an alpha was in charge… what kind of alpha would even allow him near the equipment?
Peggy’s stare - it carried force. Demand. Strength. Nothing quite like the stares his packmates gave him. A soft and calm gaze that showed they meant no harm and demanded no submission. Peggy held no such qualms it seemed.
“Yours?” The Hulk said, his voice so deep with growls it echoed in Tony’s chest. He pushed his large, abnormal wolf arms forward to show Tony’s armor and clothing and gauntlets in his claws. He held them in an offer. That was awfully thoughtful of the giant wolf to pick up his items.
“Brothers and sister in pride, you hand me these victories dexterously. If this is allowed to continue I will rise with the most canines under mine name and be named champion, again.”
The Avengers exchanged glances between each other, appearing surprised for a brief moment. A pause of silent communication and they were back to grinning again at Steve’s expense.
Tony blushed the moment their hands made contact. “Nothing to apologize for. I’m just sorry you didn’t get to finish your food in peace.”
Now that they had names to their faces it would be easier to communicate and at least now he knew the shifters who were helping their leader play a prank on him.
Tony gave a whine of mortification at the idea but it did the trick and slowly the pack came closer and merged Rhodey, Pepper and Happy into their circle. One by one his pack personally introduced themselves, accepting his friends with near open arms. Loki, Bucky, Natasha and Steve held back. Loki because he naturally acted as if he didn’t care and Bucky and Natasha because they were to keep a watchful eye for potential dangers, even if the dangers claimed to be Tony’s friends. Steve… Steve didn’t look to want to make any interactions with them at all, or at least with Rhodey. He plastered himself against Tony and licked around his face, not even giving Tony a chance to add to the small talk going around.
Also walking close to them was Bruce who took up Tony’s right side and Natasha who took up Bruce’s own right. The grumpy alpha by the name of Bucky walked on Steve’s left. Both he and Natasha appeared to be keeping a watchful eye out and were searching the area every few minutes for any immediate danger. Ahead of them were the rest of the Avengers following dutifully after Sam and Clint while balancing their meals.
“We didn’t - I mean, we weren’t going to -” Bruce sputtered, rubbing his hands in a gesture Tony knew meant he was nervous.
And that shield… if he remembered correctly Steve had a history of always breaking them from usage. What if he were to integrate a rune and make it near indestructible? Somewhere in the back of the shield to keep it hidden most likely. He wondered if Steve had the tendency to lose said shield. He might know of a way to make it so the shield would return to him without hesitation. For two runes to always attract each other.
The dream more than made up for the awkwardness that came from traveling with Steve’s ex-mate, Sharon. She was fierce in battle, Tony could admit to that. She was also very beautiful and he could see why she and Steve had once been together.
Loki didn’t appear offended at all. “One thing you shall learn overtime, Anthony, is that I am never left behind. A certain fool won’t have it without a fight, and I find it most beneficial.”
Tony wondered for a moment if Bruce had finally revealed his secret to Natasha. This had sounded far too close to the big guy’s circumstances for it to be pure coincidence. He did recall Bruce telling him he’d reveal it to her soon, he just didn’t think it had already happened. Both their demeanor hadn’t changed and Bruce never mentioned anything afterwards.
“You’re finally awake, great,” Bruce started packing away his make-shift bed. “Any longer and I would’ve dragged you across to where the Avengers are staying.”
Silence fell over them. A very tension filled silence, until, “Then I’ll be returning to the shacks. Nothing else I can do. You, on the other hand, will be staying with them.”
Claiming the alpha. Dare he believe Steve belonged to him just as much as he now belonged to Steve? He could still feel a sting pulsing through his body from the bite mark on his neck with every beat of his heart. He was claimed now, his neck proudly showing what he had recently craved with all his might. No one would mistake him as a single shifter. As for Steve… he wondered if the alpha would ever allow him to leave a bite mark of his own.
In a tense moment where they waited for the hydra to make its move they were surprised and downright shocked when the beast began laughing. It had stopped growling and began laughing in a heavy and terrifying tone. Even through it's chuckles the hydra never once took its eyes off them.
Tony had a right to whine, but he understood Steve's reasoning. They were in the middle of a moon run, after all. And right on cue, as if they knew the two were talking about the run, Bucky appeared from behind the trees and gave a warning howl before going low and waiting for Steve to get ready.
Tony stared wide-eyed at the building the Avengers called home appeared through some trees. It was a grand two story mansion that had additional rooms connected on both sides, looked to extend further from the back, had what could’ve only been a tower somehow connected at the end, and even had a garden on the side.
Tony followed him with hope in his steps. If there was even the slightest chance of joining the trip Rhodey was the best choice to make it happen. It was still one opinion against nine others, however. If the chance were to even make it on the table Rhodey had to choose his words carefully.
The festivities were grand and the spirits were high on this beautiful day. The laughs and smiles were contagious and even Tony couldn’t resist joining in. While the town was small the festival was impressive. Many tourists came from all over to take part in the fun. The many centaur-themed activities present and the town’s high centaur population was enough to warrant a weekend stay and then more, bringing in much-needed revenue to the town. The main events, the races themselves, were really the entire reason the town was able to hold the fairly sized festival in the first place. Twenty-five years running now.
Everyone left while they were eating except for Steve, who decided to continue what he was doing before. He found the spot he left off and began grooming. Tony sighed upon the first contact. Delicious food while getting groomed after being supported by his entire pack? He must have been dreaming. It certainly felt like it. These things never happen to him together, if ever at all.
“I can’t feel my legs.” Clint’s face was smothered in the lion’s made and caused his voice to be muffled.
The image almost made him miss his old room in Hammer’s home. Anything was better than this pitiful sight.
Tony paused. The one thing he didn’t want to do could be the reason he wouldn’t be given the work. What blacksmith didn’t make weapons, the number one sold item that brought in the coin? No one would hire him if he were to say it, but if he didn’t he’d have no choice but to create weapons to sell… he couldn’t, not again. “I don’t build weapons.”
He had followed after Rhodey with confidence down the stairs but as they got closer to the bottom and the first set of packmates came into view that confidence disappeared. The traitor. What would their packmates say? How would they react to the idea of bringing the rest along? To be precise, the two omegas along? What did they believe of them? Were they truly just meant to be den omegas and nothing else?
“No, we’re not doing anything for the rest of the day,” Bruce answered for him, snapping him back to reality.
“What problem are you referring to?” the feathers on the cockatoo rose in agitation, already offended by Tony’s behalf.
Hammer was never one to intimidate. He had large betas guards for that. Large betas who easily created the aggressive stance Hammer had never quite been capable of doing. For Tony, however, Hammer saved the betas and chose to handle matters himself. What would it be said about an alpha who used their betas to keep the omegas in line, after all?
Tony waited for the alpha to say something simple like the sun or reflections to explain why he was glowing. Instead, Steve reached for his hand and intertwined their fingers together. “Could be because you're sitting next to me.”
attacked and overwhelmed? Do you really think we’ll escape unfazed? Five shifters against full packs, and you’ll never know about it until you come home.”
And now it'll probably be another slow update again because I got a new job! Yay. Bad thing it takes up a lot of my hours, so I'm for sure going to have less time to write for fun, but I promise to finish this! No matter how long it takes. Wait for me. <3
His fingers twitched, wanting to grab that shield and get to work. No, not even grab that shield. He could make a better one. Larger, with near perfect ratio, and balanced.
Tony did so, still concerned and now walking blindly as Steve dragged him around. A few steps forward and he heard additional footsteps that didn’t belong to him or Steve. Some from behind, which he figured were Bruce, Jan and Clint. Some in front that he guessed were the rest of their packmates.
“You smell of home,” Steve said immediately. As if having expected the question and was ready for it. “When I first met you. My nose wasn’t the greatest but when you kneeled down close to me I smelled it. You smelled of home. Mama always said your fated mate will remind you of home. Where you’re safest and happiest and where you know your loved ones will always be.”
“It was Rhodey who told us. Sent us a letter about you becoming packless and going out to search for you. We couldn’t just sit still and do nothing.”
The alpha leader released a low growl, making Tony jump a little until he realized the growl wasn’t aimed at him or Bruce and the growl wasn’t meant to be as threatening as it sounded. No, Steve was growling at Sam and the growl came out more from an annoyance than hostility.
What was it about him that had caught Steve’s attention? He had to wonder. If not an elaborate joke as Tony had originally thought, then what did Steve see in him? Couldn’t have been because of his personality. The alpha barely knew him, and three days wasn’t a substantial enough time to know a person and all their traits. Possibly his looks? For all Tony knew, Steve might have a type. Maybe older omegas was what the alpha found attractive? The wrinkles and the white and dark of his hair was what Steve looked for.
“You’re both here,” He stared at Happy, who was standing behind Pepper and letting them have their moment. The loyal beta guard who had become one of Tony’s closest and dearest friends, who protected Pepper’s business pack, most likely continued to protect her pack after Tony was taken away, and now both followed and protected Pepper to their reunion. “Get over here, Happy. I haven’t seen you in years. I’m not letting you get away without joining in.”
“Right, uhm,” the alpha shuffled his feet nervously. It was odd seeing an alpha with muscles and height acting shy. Usually, young alphas postured and puffed out their chest in confidence every chance they could, but for some reason this one was bashful. Tony wondered what the reason could possibly be. “W-would you like… to…” he continued, unable to find the words.
Tony, meanwhile, worked himself up for the run that was to occur. He might have failed giving Steve a good run, but maybe with the dingo and the jackal he'd have a chance.
Half of their pack was gone. Out clearing the north area of Hattan from raiders that had recently set up base and later making their way east towards the coast and chasing away newly docked pirates. The entire Avengers pack was not needed. Not for these hostile packs. Steve took with him the hard hitters consisting of Thor, Loki, Rhodey, Bucky, Natasha and Peggy. More than enough to handle the marauders terrorizing innocent folk.
“You were saying?” Clint said dryly, still pleasing his mate by softly biting the point where jaw met neck and nibbling, earning a soft pleased whine that turned to a grumble when Clint pulled away. “I just want to say that I am incapable. I have no power to resist. It’s all his fault,” he said before returning back to the spot of wet fur he had created.
That made Tony realized that he had been looking at Steve’s smile for who knows how long and the Avengers had been watching him. He fought down the blush that threatened to appear on his cheeks and for the most part managed to hold it off, that was until he caught Bruce motioning to something to his side. Tony hadn’t realized that Steve had placed his hand over his uninjured one resting on the table’s surface, not exactly holding it but one muscle movement away from it. It was warm and comforting and such a sweet gesture that it made Tony feel happy for a moment. His eyes snapped to the alpha in question, heart speeding up.
“And I haven’t considered courting anyone since making it official with Clint,” Sam added, saying it for both. “If he’s interested we’ll do the whole show. Compliments, flowers, walks under the moonlight and anything you three suggest to win him over and show we mean it. If he isn’t we’ll leave it alone.”
Bracing his elbows down so he could lift himself up Tony was caught off-guard when Steve nuzzled his cold nose against his jaw and trotted off to where the hunters of the morning were gathering without another word.
He remembers attacking after that. Remembers the way they scattered like insects, trying to escape. One floated above him, out of his reach. Two rolled out of his way, quick and skilled. One wasn’t so lucky. Not fast enough like the others. Steve pinned the faceless shadow down, gripping tightly on its large appendage located on its back. Refusing to let go. He remembers it screaming as he went to bite, to tear at the soft flesh of its neck. Eager to taste the blood of his prey.
Thor patted him proudly when he declared the Northern Midgardian workshop Tony’s upon his twenty-first birthday. With Odin’s blessing, of course. “Midgard is well handled with you, and there are plenty of other locations I must attend to. She is all yours, Tony. I know you will treat her well.”
“What I can say,” Steve continued, “is even from the beginning, I’ve wanted you. From the moment I saw you, I just knew.  It’s not an effort for me, it’s commitment.” The alpha leaned in to kiss his forehead. “You smell of home, of belonging. I don’t think I could’ve stayed away from you for long if you had said no to joining us from the start. Besides -” Steve gave a small huff of laughter, causing strands of Tony’s hair to dance, “I did make a promise to myself when I was younger, and I plan to keep it.”
? He wasn’t ready nor prepared. He needed at least a week to think of how he could converse and how to least embarrass himself.
Steve could guess and imagine that Tony and the gang found something at the end of the tunnel and got their answers, managed to safely end their adventure and retire with families and told stories of their encounters to their children and their grandchildren. Maybe at one point, in Steve’s head, Tony lived long enough to still be alive for him to meet in person, bed-ridden with white hair and old tired but wise eyes, and still had strength and time to tell Steve one of his greatests adventures of all.
“You do, Tony,” Rhodey said, “and you're an idiot for leaving the pack and going alone when you're starting your heat. Even if you smell awful, you should never leave your company. Solitude is the last thing you need right now.”
Steve continued grooming him well past the time he had estimated going to town and returning to the mansion. He was lying on his belly now, Steve settled next to him and licking down his shoulder. His dark fur shined under the sunlight. The parts where Steve had worked on were no longer mangled, soothed in place and running smoothly over his figure. The work was nowhere near done, but Steve had done a reasonable job with the time given to him that was signalled to a stop when Tony’s belly rumbled in hunger.
you’ll think you’re inconveniencing us for and I’m here to tell you-you're not. We needed somewhere to rest after this fight anyway.”
Tony gave a slow nod, a bit unsure. They might have lost track of time as one point, but he was sure they waited that half hour. Had they waited half an hour? What if they hadn’t?
It was Natasha who took pity on him and got up with a huff. She marched over to him, kneeled down so she could take a closer look at the sleeping alpha and
“Oh, Omega,” Hammer sighed, feinting concern. “You know I hate hurting you. You just upset me so much. What can I do? I have to discipline you. Getting yourself pregnant by another alpha is among the stupidest thing you could have ever done. It’s absolutely unforgivable. What would the neighbors say? No self-respecting omega would
,” Pepper scolded, the only reason they apparently needed. “You were gone, somewhere out there alone with no way to contact you. Of course we were going to leave in order to find you.”
No, he wasn’t. He really wasn’t, but he wanted to do this, and with Jarvis, Vision and Bruce at his side he knew he could do this. “Never and always,” Tony breathed, “Never and always.”
Bucky returned the favor and continued trying to grab hold of the coat, receiving the same results when Steve snapped his teeth at him. They went back and forth, moving around to both strike and cover different spots all around Tony. It was a slow understanding for Tony, but once he figured out that the two alphas were
“I assume he was left without feeling of his legs as well,” Thor added with a toothy grin. “We must toast in your honor.”
They pushed forward, making excellent progress as one after another enemies fell. At one point it had almost appeared as if they’ve taken down all of the Hydra patrols. They had gone a whole ten or so minutes without another soul seen besides them. It felt absolutely wrong and sent them on edge. Even Clint agreed.
He moved to get up but the hand returning on his shoulder and a new one over his hand stopped him. Sam’s soothing scent was mixed in with a more softer aroma along with a sharper one. The softer seemed to come from Hank while the sharper came from Jan. Both of them different, but no less calming than Sam’s.
The ‘bath’ made the sticky situation worse, but Tony wasn’t complaining. At least not during the session. While in the middle of their… bathing, the owner of the heat room had knocked on the door to announce her presence and leave the message and package their pack had left for them. Tony had been too distracted by Steve’s tongue and Steve had been too focused on ‘cleaning’ Tony for them to have noticed her.
Jarvis flew from Bruce’s shoulder to Tony’s, releasing a whistle and giving him a stern look. A look that seemed fitting on a parent ready to scold their child.
He shrieked when Jarvis nipped his ear and pecked just above his cheek bone and Vision began trying to swing back and forth over his hip in retaliation. “Hey, easy down there. We don’t all have skin of steel.”
Tony had his answers now, all that was missing was the why and the how. Why had Bruce been cursed and how had it happened? Was it willing, or was it forced? Was it himself or was it his old pack?
“You didn’t have to wait for me,” Tony walked through and closed his door. “You should’ve gone down and gotten a plate already.”
“Hey, Tony,” Ty said in a voice that was meant to be sultry, yet was anything but. He followed him. “Did you enjoy the race?”
, the fur around his neck. Tony couldn’t resist exposing more of the area. His tail actually wagging.
Sam shrugged. “No reason to apologize. You were making odd faces. You looked -” he paused, reconsidering what he was going to say. “Never mind. You were making funny faces Like so,” he then proceeded to make an exaggerated face that consisted of making his mouth lopsided with his bottom lip sticking out and frowning.
More porn in the beginning but finally some fighting action for the rest of the chapter! Tony, Rhodey and Bruce getting ready to show them how it's done.
“Rogers, you and I both know I’m just going to ignore everything that comes out of your mouth. Save the lecture. I’m not in the mood.”
Still, the nagging feeling that perhaps, just perhaps, their new pack mates might have been a tiny bit annoyed by them slowing down their travels wouldn’t leave him, and the urge to do what little he could to please them began rearing its ugly head. It was Hammer all over again. The desire to do everything he could to make him, or the pack, happy and failing miserably because he either didn’t do enough or he didn’t know what to do and left them all unsatisfied.
“Don’t listen to them.” Steve had appeared next to him, looking determined and scowling at every shifter standing by and chatting. “They don’t know the truth. They’re just making assumptions without all the information.”
The sudden change in diet had his stomach screaming in protest. Now that he was with child the sensation felt as if it had doubled overnight. As if that wasn’t enough, his sleep was also miserable. How could one sleep comfortably under the blanket of safety when their abductors were mere feet away? Not Tony, and it only added to his anxiety that could prove fatal to his child.
As more and more Hydra shifters broke through Clint’s defenses the realization that, perhaps, the blond beta was hard of hearing and required them to be his ears came to light. Considering Tony had known Clint for more than half a year and never once suspected the beta had a disability, the revelation was shocking, to say the least. It changed nothing of what Tony thought of the beta except gain a newfound respect for him. To fight with such a potentially fatal disability in battle and still come out on top, to be part of a war pack known for their many victories and never looked upon as a hindrance, for the very Captain to rely on him and never hesitate with the safety of the pack. It was something hardly ever seen. It was something that absolutely deserved praise and he had to wonder if Clint had ever received his due.
Tony, who would do everything to keep Steve safe, no matter if Steve saw him as an enemy and went off to break his arms and legs in an attempt to escape and kill some more.
He was fed and given water, but the rations were pitiful compared to the bountiful feasts he had with his pack. It was as before. “We have to make sure the betas are fed first. They
Tony wasn’t as fast on his paws. His muscles seemed to have grown weak simply from resting. His cycle taking a greater toll on his body than he thought. He managed to stay upright on wobbly legs with his tail remaining tucked firmly between his hind legs. One paw after another he got himself walking. In the minutes it took for him to reach this step his pack had gotten to work preparing to search the territory. Steve was given his bag that was retrieved from the spot they hid them before the attack. The Hulk was given Bruces’ bag along with Tony’s own. He stuffed Tony’s armor and clothing and gauntlets inside as best as he could with his claws.
“Bad idea,” Bruce hissed when he saw his leg bending in ways it was never meant to, looking more awake than before. “Best not get up yet until you gain full mobility.”
Hammer was never one for honeyed words. In all his time under Hammer’s care, Tony had never heard him say any endearments and actually mean them. He had only ever said them when he was displeased or disappointed with him but wouldn’t act on his feelings, restraining himself.
The Captain continued on. Their steps became nonexistent against the grass and stones and dead leaves as if they weren’t even present. When they reached a point in the forest where danger had become true Steve pulled his shield forward and stopped. That was the cue everyone needed to pull their choice of weapon as well. Both Natasha and Bucky moved in perfect sync to the Captain with Natasha choosing her gun over the two batons attached to her back and Bucky holding his long-barreled firearm meant to snipe targets without being seen carefully.
The alpha whined softly, concerned, no doubt taking notice of Tony’s tear-stricken face. An entirely different kind of humiliation, the kind that happened when one was caught, took over. And to be caught by none other than Steve?
He had been doing so well. Steve had actually appeared impressed and even had him help with a strike together. He had helped make a difference and turn the outcome in their favor and Steve - his alpha had appeared so
The start of that realization had come from Steve. As his alpha, Steve was the main source in comparing Hammer’s previous actions. From the good to the bad. He was the first to begin helping Tony truly understand the environment he had been led to believe was normal. To reveal the true extent of it all, his Rhodey was the one to sit him down and layout the work.
“I believe you did, Sir,” Jarvis said with a whistle and a flap of his wings, smacking Tony on the side of his head and causing his hair to bounce.
? I knew you were going to reach great heights, Tones, but joining the top of the foodchain pack? Didn’t know you had it in you.”
That prompted many of them to quicken their steps. Pepper dug her heels in an attempt to slow them down but one of the betas eventually grew tired of her struggles and lifted her up effortlessly. This did not slow her as she began to kick wildly at anyone who got within reach of her legs. Tony held back a smile. That was his Pepper. Happy and their packmates would be so proud, if not for the fact she and he were being taken away from them all.
admirer. Yes, he had also admired the Avenger long before he personally met them and mated with one, but the Avengers were fairly new in comparison to the legends before him. The Howling Commandos have been active longer, had grown their name in the fastest movement ever witnessed and their story of banding together was the stuff of legends.
It was a shield designed just for Steve and Tony had to admit he was impressed with his own handy work. Their pack and even the Howling Commandos agreed. They had sung their praise, commented on his skills and let Steve know that he had “picked a good one!”
He regretted uttering those words the moment he let them out. Steve looked gutted, eyes expressing hurt from the obvious guilt. “No, she hasn’t.”
They were in the middle of Tony explaining a tale that involved oil, Vision covered with it and Jarvis’ loose feathers when many of the betas and omegas hanging around the common area began to move and point and started talking excitedly amongst themselves.
Hank lifted a hand to stop him. “Just listen for now. You need to know something and I need to get it all out. I fear if you interrupt it might stop me and you can’t misunderstand this. It’s not an excuse, but maybe listening to my story will help you accept everything.” He took a breath. “You’re smart. You’ve probably figured out what I implicated earlier. Jan and I shared heats before. Years ago. A heat amongst betas is difficult to prompt, as you know, and we were doing it with purpose. We wanted a child, and we almost had one.”
Steve waved his offers away. “No, thank you. I’ve got those covered already. Nice of you to offer, though. Sam, since you’re busy keeping a watchful eye on the cart you have pulling duty.”
It was - it was almost suffocating how many times Steve was always present and near him. His scent was everywhere. Tony wasn’t able to escape it. Every intake he took of his alpha musk always left him warm and content and he loved every second of it. The protective suffocation included. All the touches the alpha gave, all the kisses, the hand holding, the grooming, Tony cherished every moment of it. It was everything he had always imagined for himself, all brought forth by the Captain, leader of the Avengers, by Steve Rogers. The alpha was slowly winning his old, tired, and broken heart. What little of it was left.
He remembers waking up to his mate’s voice. To Tony telling him, “it’s okay. Steve, Honey. Come back to me.”
Tony, Bruce, Jarvis and even Vision jumped an inch in the air and backed away from the figure slithering down from a nearby tree branch. A giant python that was the pure color of black, so black that it had blue streaks painting the scales at certain angles. It dangled its head down while the rest of its body circled around the thick branch.
He was oversensitive from his body pushing farther than ever before and he was thankful when Steve pulled his tongue away in favor of smacking his lips. He lifted his head high enough for Tony to see his chin smeared with his slick and the alpha gazed lovingly at him. The fond expression Steve showed had him looking sweet and innocent but the bottom half of his face glossed with evidence of what he had done just a couple of seconds ago said otherwise. The imagery was both arousing and mortifying. Arousing because that was Tony’s slick decorating Steve’s face, like a mark not meant to be seen in public. Mortifying because that was
. Now he was going to be made a fool of and Bruce was going to go through unnecessary discomfort and probably think spending time with Tony was more trouble than it was worth and ditch him, all because he wasn’t paying attention to where he was going.
He almost felt like crying from the frustration. Soon the Avengers would grow tired of him and his internally conflicting nature and Steve would boot him out of the pack because he could neither satisfy nor benefit them, or him. And just like before he’d end up packless again and living in the shacks alone with Jarvis and Vision because, while they would happily kick him out, they’d keep Bruce thanks to Natasha’s insistence. Maybe to save the cockatoo and little machine from suffering for their owner’s incompetence Tony should ask Bruce if he would take them in. They already liked the other omega, and unlike Tony, Bruce would still have a pack.
A bit stiff from lying on the hard ground they walked back to the mansion with Tony wrapping Steve’s coat, that he decided to wear for their walk, tighter on his body and Steve with an arm around his shoulders, pulling him close. When the building came into view Tony spotted one of the windows of the tower attached at the back glowing a faint green. Curiosity and questions filled his head, but he had an idea of what the source of the lighting could’ve been. After all he had seen it earlier that day when Loki had casted a spell on the cart.
“If I may, Young Vision and I are beyond the age of being considered infants. If you are to address us, do so as adults.”
“I think we need to renegotiate the deal we made together to include telling each other where the other will go alone to.” Bruce kneeled down and gently tapped Tony’s nose. “You are not allowed to do that again, Mister.”
He had never been so thankful for Clint’s blunt personality than he was at that moment when the beta trotted over, stood suspiciously close to Rhodey and said, “Our great leader has spoken and I’m taking full advantage of your stay with us. You’ve got stories about puppy Tony? I need to know every embarrassing detail there is.”
“You don’t have to stay if you don’t want to,” Sam reassured him, a spark of understanding in his eyes. Tony felt a spike of fear from it. Had the beta pieced it together? Had he realized what Tony had been doing, even though Tony didn’t mean to? “Tony, you’re
