He was worried. Panicked, sometimes. He woke up suddenly several nights from a dream that Tony had done it, he’d killed himself, he was holding him dead, unseeing and bleeding in his arms, and he hadn’t been able to stop it. It filled him so completely with dread, and he was grateful to Jarvis for reassuring him that Tony was alive and safe in the tower. Though he still worried about what Tony was doing, what was going through his mind, whether he really was getting better – or getting worse, without anyone knowing it.
“But they don’t fit,” Tony’s voice cracked, and he blinked his eyes a few times. “I mean, this is only gonna get worse a-and-”
Tony’s emotions were usually in a mess in the control centre. Today was not much different, apart from the fact that there were now multiple warning signs beeping all around them, and thus sparked a new wave of panic.
Problem is, Steve can’t stop thinking of Tony’s waist, especially as his slightly short long-sleeved top barely reaches his hips. Not that that’s his fault.
Tony noticed that his therapist was very thorough. Well, he paid for it. Someone who didn’t have other priorities. Could do long appointment sessions. Who knew
Steve thought he might faint when he first heard the high-pitched cry. Their baby was born healthily, and Tony was tired and recovering from the procedure, which would take some time. Right now he was enjoying time with the feel of his baby cuddling up to him, letting out cries every now and then, and had been fed with bottled-formula milk.
of it, to find meaning and to find love maybe, to be apart of something, not grieving over what could have been.”
He could hear Steve’s moaning breath from behind. The room was dark, it was late, and they had both been stressed lately.
Tony walked away, and Steve felt like the hole inside him since he had woken up in the new century was just getting deeper.
Tony was still starting to sniffle, for a different reason. He twisted around in Steve’s hold and buried his head in Steve’s neck.
– planned. Why does this have to happen to me? God, why is it…” Tony let out a blub and he shook his head and leant down in his hands.
“Shut up,” Tony breathed heavily, and looked up at him, now looking like a crying puppy who’d been bloody shot, “Shit, Steve, you didn’t do anything. Can’t have that on your conscience. No. I’m just going into labour.”
Steve only saw out of the corner of his eye, thankful for his expert perception, that Tony swayed when he got up from the sofa, and his knees fell to the floor with a groan.
Steve feels the weight of the gun in his hand, and deliberately begins to crush the nozzle and the middle of it with his hands. He walks next to Tony, who he realises is a bit smaller than he had thought. He thrusts the gun high and sees it travelling through the air, as Tony concentrates his gauntlet to target the flying object and fires, splitting the gun into pieces of fire and ash, and the bits fall into the water to fade away.
God, Steve was bad at this flirting thing. Maybe he could be more direct. Maybe not. Maybe he should just help and be a good person; not do it for any reason other to help and be friendly, which Tony deserved. Yea. That, he could do. Maybe.
“Yea, I’m fine,” Tony called out. But Steve couldn’t help remember the last time he was here, in a similar situation, and Tony was certainly not okay. But he didn’t want to intrude. So, he sat down heavily on the floor, leaning against the wall, in case Tony had another nightmare.
“No,” Tony said right away. “Of course not, I totally got this. If you’re here to mock me, then don’t bother.”
“Sorry,” Natasha said, eyebrows pulled together, her hair blowing slightly in the wind. She looked wary. Steve realised he was tense.
, you can come too, don’t wanna be missing out on the action,” Tony said somewhat bitterly, “Be nice for us all to get away for a bit, wouldn’t it.”
“It’s not a massive deal, I just,” Bruce said, a little awkwardly, “I just think we should keep a small eye on him, I mean, I know what’s it like to – to just not to talk to anyone and pretend things are fine and – they’re not.”
“Tony? Iron Man, come in!” Steve called wildly, looking around but not being able to find anything. They were outside the rogue enemy building that had been mainly subdued before the bombs exploded, and now, outside the other end of the building, there were bits flying everywhere, raining down the destruction caused.
Steve took a picture of them one day, as they were talking, with the Avengers HQ and surrounding trees in the background. They didn’t know. He felt a bit bad about it, as he didn’t tell them about it, and was keeping it hidden. Oh well. It was for art’s sake.
, I’m sure,” Tony said sardonically raising his eyebrows at him as he crossed his chest and leaned back against the kitchen counter. Steve sighed.
Unfortunately, fate, or Steve, had other ideas as only the next day they were in the training room going through drills, and Tony ended up pinned on his front on the ground with Steve on top of him, clearly showing his superior fighting skills and Tony just grunted.
“Thank you, Tony,” Steve smiled back, looking at him a strange way, but nice. His blue eyes were all soft and smiley.
The others were watching the new island being formed. Its main stature was of Steve and Tony with their arms around each other, kissing. “Aww,” Fear said. “It’s a romance island, guys!”
Joy cocked her head, then looked back to the other meddling emotions. Joy scowled, “Fine. But you know, he can take care of himself. He’s a superhero. He has the best, most impressive suit of armour I’ve ever seen.”
Steve had only gone to get some coffee, and was talking with Happy, who was here with Rhodey, when machines from inside Tony’s room was beeping where a doctor was already monitoring him. The doctor snapped to attention and called for his team, and before they knew what was happening they were being ushered out of the way as multiple staff went in Tony’s room and swarmed him with machines, and they couldn’t see what was happening. Happy was shouting at some staff, asking them worriedly what was going on, and Rhodey was trying to get a peek in the window. Steve just stood there, frozen to the spot, his heart feeling like it had stopped, as he watched them carefully do their jobs. Most of what they were saying was lost on him, but he still listened.
Steve followed him, as they fought with more of the troops guarding the collection of bombs they had illegally been keeping (and making).
information. And of course, had accreditation from his personal doctor, Michaels, who referred her. He liked to call her Sandy, never mind what her real name was.
“Steve,” his voice was still small, which annoyed him. “Eheh,” he cleared his throat, tapping his chest. “Um, I er, this might be a bit awkward, but…I heard what you said. Well, some things anyway.”
Steve went back to his training schedule, and then hit the books again. He was currently reading about the ‘revolution of the mobile phone’. He thought it was pretty interesting. And he definitely needed to read about modern diseases and medicine, just to reassure himself once again.
“I can confirm, Dr Banner. The alien has made Tony’s body hospitable for recreation, most likely with some kind of alien concoction or chemical that we are not aware of.”
Steve and Tony had agreed to a date. A proper date, just them two, no interruptions, no world that needs saving.
“I don't like to feel I've made you uncomfortable, please tell me if I do. But I want to make sure you’re okay. That you get through this. I
Tony was looking worried now. They both were. Bruce put a hand on Tony’s shoulder to steady him, and Tony nodded, running a hand through his hair.
“Oh, really? So you ‘body-guarding’ me is nothing to do with the fact that you get a kick out of continuing your heroism, huh?” Steve scoffs, but Tony goes on, “Making me stop working and to ‘relax’, heroic deed of the day, completed.”
Tony coughed, sitting up and aiming towards the ground when he was sick. What came out was nightmarish. Tony felt how it looked like.
“Tony, you’re self-destructive,” Steve says bluntly, “You’re in a low, low place. The actions you’re displaying, like those cuts on your arms, show that you don’t care much about yourself at this point. So, I want to care as much for the both of us.”
Steve was glad that Tony also wanted to see him again. He kissed him again, and Tony smiled, gratefully received. And a little voice in his head kept telling him to wrap it up, cause boy this woody ain’t going down any time soon. So he said goodnight, and Tony said goodnight, with a goodnight kiss, which only made matters worse, and high-tailed it out of there as fast as he could without raising suspicion.
Steve went over to his very pregnant boyfriend who was sitting agitatedly on a chair, and he helped him put his shoes on, since it was hard to bend down at this point.
Who showed him his detailed drawings with a bashful, hopeful smile. Tony couldn’t help but turn up a lip. They were great drawings, it would sell impressively at a charity auction. Why was that his first thought? But it wasn’t really. His first thought was that this is just a young man trying to achieve something, doing something he loves. And the first person he went to was Tony. And ok, he wasn’t
“You know, I think I've been having an existential crisis lately,” Steve said, looking into the distance, “Like, thinking about my purpose now, and what I want, and I realise that you are a big part of that,” he looked towards Tony, “That I have a team, that I can help people again – it's made me feel more like a home, and even though it might not fill the hole inside me-” he points to his gut to make a point, “-of everyone that I left behind, that life - I can’t go back. I can’t change it. This is my life now, and I realised I need to make the
Steve looked confused. “I am pleased, Tony, of course I am, it’s just, you don’t…look too ecstatic about it,” he finished when he saw Tony’s expectant face. Tony sighed.
“Oh yea,” Tony said, looking up at him. Steve concentrated as Tony put his hand over his as well, and he felt a slight movement from inside.
Tony buried his head in Steve’s neck to take in the fresh, cottony smell of his blue wings. The tips of them then tickled the bottom of Tony’s back, and he flinched a bit, mock-hitting him as Steve giggled, and it vibrated through him, making him smile. Tony pushed Steve’s hair back with the tip of his own wing, and Steve stroked the feathers gently, looking Tony in the eye in the dimness of their bedroom. Tony’s wings settled down, compacting behind his back comfortably.
I don't pretend to be a perfect writer. I just want it to be real. I'd love to hear what people think of it.
“Steve, look, calm down,” Tony reassures him, “It’s not – I'm fine!” Which totally sounded true. Mm-hm. Convincing. “Look, this is just a gun I happen to have, and it’s, y’know, an American’s right so... You know, normal civilians don’t get fancy weapons, do they? Huh.”
Steve sighed and steadily stood up from where he had been doing sit-ups on the mat. They were going to meet the obstetrician to check on Tony’s progress, inside the tower of course, because Tony didn’t go out anymore, and wouldn’t until the bump went down after the baby was born.
It didn’t take long to settle in. Bruce and Natasha took a room on one side of the villa – which was really not so little – so it made sense for Tony and Steve to take rooms in the opposite wing.
He drifted in and out of consciousness, which was really annoying, because he could finally be able to understand what people in the room were talking about, and then things would become fuzzy, and quieter, and then he’d be out like a light, and had no clue how to tell how much time had passed by the next time he ‘woke up’ which was different to them to what it meant to him.
“Uh, yea, you know I think I’d prefer to – to skip the talking thing. How about we do that negative thought exercise you were going on about.”
Tony saw Friday trying to read the signature on the bombs, which were in the next room, he could see through his infrared. They were too late for most of them. But the most explosive one, the radioactive one, that was the real catastrophe if it got blown up with the others. Tony had to deactivate it.
Basically, well – she was probably right. But she had reassured him, that whatever his problems, whatever labels or medication ascribed to him, it would get better, and it was always worth the chance to explore deeper into his mentality, now that he was able to open up a bit.
“As much as I would love to see you drunk, I don’t think the experimental levels of alcohol I could brew up in my lab would be good for anyone’s health.”
“Ok…” Tony says suspiciously, “…I think that’s a bit too much caring. If I’m honest. You might break.”
“Oh, er, I know. Can we talk for a second?” Steve gestured to a sitting area. Sandy checked her watch while holding her bag and nodded at him. He smiled gratefully and took her over to a quieter area. Not that there were many people around.
“These are my favourite jeans,” Tony said, raising his eyebrows in the mirror as he saw Steve turn around and look, “And they – they just don’t fit. It’s not – I can’t button them-” Tony tried, but it really wouldn’t reach.
Tony looked annoyed, and tired, but agreed begrudgingly, as Steve led him to their room, and Steve decided to stay with him on the sofa, while Tony slept it off, and Steve just held him gently.
“I – I was worried, initially, because – erm – the – my lovely attackers, they said an offhand comment about you – probably just to taunt me…” Tony said, “I just, I had hoped it wasn’t true – not that you were gay or anything, oh my god, no, I'm not - it was just – they were being creepy about it, I was stressed out and I didn’t want to think about
“I can’t do it without you,” Steve admitted, his blue doe-eyes woefully worried. “No one can. We need you. I do. And -” Tony was about to interrupt, but he wouldn’t have it, “It’s not just that we need you, we
Tony blushed when he realised Steve had caught on, and hid his wings behind his back, in a defensive way.
“I’m on it,” Tony said and made a dash for his special cupboard, “And I’ll have yours because they don’t have an effect on you.”
When Tony shooed his ‘man’ to the elevator and saw him off, only then did Steve notice. Huh. They all knew that one of Tony’s wing was long damaged and he had repaired, or mostly replaced it with one he built himself, with fairly good resemblance to the other beaming red-feathered wing, but always had a shinier glow to it, as it clearly wasn’t the same natural material, as it was mechanically made.
“Ooh, watch this,” Tony puts down his fork and shows his watch. He double taps it, and the watch folds out, and then grows, the metallic red and silver structure fitting around Tony’s hand, and he stretches out to show it.
But, it doesn’t change the fact that it would be easier if he would just die, so he didn’t have to actively kill himself. Again, this seems difficult. He feels pain. Deep inside him, in his heart – he’s even thinking he has a soul, only because it hurts so damn much, this pain that he can’t rip out of him this time. The emotions are overwhelming, seemingly made worse by the calm, warm environment of the sea he’s in. He feels like he wants to cry.
Just like Tony’s Iron Man suit, the tip of his feathered outstretched wing was now golden yellow, and it looked great on him. But they weren’t there before. Steve’s white-tipped wings weren’t there before yesterday either. Which meant…oh, please, let it means what he thinks.
“You will be worth saving every time and er…” Steve tried to regain his voice, swallowing thickly, taking a deep breath. “And I really...I just wish you could hear me now, hell, maybe you can, but I need you to know that. And I know this sounds like I’m a teenage boy pining, but…for some reason, I don’t think I can do this without…No. I don’t think I
“That’s you, Steve, and your other superhero-friends,” she said amusedly, “I shouldn't really be saying this, but... He trusts you. Don’t break that trust. He’s safest with you, and in good company,” Sandy smiled at him, then stood up to leave. “Here’s my number. It’s for emergencies only.”
“You-you saved me…” Steve looked into his earnest eyes. “Only temporarily. You need to hold on Tony,” Steve said, worry lines creasing his forehead.
“We think it will be a caesarean,” Bruce explained, “And as I said, we don’t know how exactly it’s going to play out, but it does seem to be progressing as ‘normal’ as a pregnancy can be, yea.”
“No, it’s fine, it’s just…God, I’ve never seen a beach without…” his voice was far away. “It’s so peaceful. Not like it was before.”
Steve had to be removed during the procedure by Thor, as Bruce, who was helping, said he was distracting in that he was almost sick due to seeing Tony’s insides being cut open, and the blood.
One of them was of when he caught him and Natasha talking, and just thought it was a good angle. He had to say, Steve did a great job on both of them, and the colours were magnificent, accentuating the orange sunset and the green trees around them, filling in their personal details very accurately as well. Tony felt a bit self-conscious in being drew of. His sad smile only made Steve more down. Now he was pulling down those around him. Great.
The emotions inside Tony’s head kept flipping between shouting and arguing chaotically and just letting the function run automatically, all sense of hope for cooperation forgone.
Initially, it’s the scariest thing he can imagine. In new York, and several other times, he thought it was a possibility, and then afterwards just came up with new ways to protect himself while still being able to do his job and save people when need be, to do some good. So, thinking about killing himself is pretty hard. It’s like the opposite meaning of life. Shit, how did he end up thinking about philosophy? No. no.
“I - no, I wasn’t going to – I was just -” Steve stopped and sighed, and went up to lightly pinch Tony’s t-shirt. “Just, please come down. Let me help.”
“That baby’s gonna grow up with two superheroes who saved the world. Don’t put too much pressure on her, now.”
“Tony, I’m just worried about you – I’ll go-” Steve said hastily, seeing the look of daggers on Tony’s face. Yes, he may have been a bit annoying lately, but he was only trying to look out for him. But that did take Tony a lot of getting used to, and Steve was aware he liked his alone time. He was sometimes self-conscious, thinking that Tony found him too annoying. He left Tony to his own devices, where he was doing work with Friday, but it wasn’t excessive, and he seemed on top of it and more content doing work than being with people at the moment.
“Wow. I am sensing some serious tension here,” Clint motioned with his hands between the two of them, grinning childishly.
Steve happily complied, and generously helped Tony out of his top as well, so their bare skin could be touching, like electricity coursing to each other, but then a pleasurable warmth settles, and it tickles their nerves, wrapped up in each other’s strong iron hold, but soft, endearing.
Tony’s legs dangled freely as Steve came from the side and latched his arms around Tony’s hips securely.
Bruce spread the gel over Tony’s stomach while he held his shirt up and started rubbing the transducer over his stomach. Tony held his breath, suddenly more scared than he thought, and he wanted Steve.
“Uh. Yea.” Steve rolled off him, and Tony stretched and slowly stood back up, checking his wing. “D-did I hurt you? Your wing? I know it’s, er, mechanically built but-”
Tony, however, was very much conscious. Just not in the way Steve would know. He wished he could squeeze his hand back, or ask him, rather, why the
Steve’s heart was beating hard in his chest, which meant adrenaline, which meant he could grab the gun in time before Tony could use it – but he didn’t want to have to force it. He didn’t want to wrestle him to the ground or anything. But he would.
“Ughh!” Tony moaned, “I can’t believe you’re making me do work. That, I consider work. You really are like a mean old teacher.”
“Decided on a name yet?” Natasha asked out of nowhere, slowly sitting on the bed and leaning over to hold the baby’s tiny hand.
“I mean, don’t get me wrong – even without the actual giving birth, pregnancy is really, like, tricky, and sometimes just uncomfortable, and confusing, I mean you really
“OK, guys, I know this is a lot to take in but one thing at a time,” Steve said authoritatively, protectively holding Tony and clenching his teeth, “Thor has gone to find out about this alien and what he did to Tony as much as he can.”
“There is no chance! Don’t you get that?” Anger said incredulously. Joy looked around all the emotions.
“I know, I know. Look, I’m sorry, Stevie,” he said, shoulders heaving a little, stroking Steve’s hair. “Really. I’ve just been tired lately – more than usual. I’ll try and work less and make for time for us. I thought you would be busy as well, and I was in a bad mood, I don’t know…” He leaned his forehead to Steve’s, and shuffled down, getting comfy sitting in Steve’s muscled lap, eyes level.
“Now, I was eighteen, and it was a very, very weird time in my life psychologically and sexually, experimentally lets say, but I kinda had a love-hate relationship at the mention of ‘Captain America’ and a mainly ‘hate’ relationship with my father, so I rebelled in every way possible.”
One of the photo’s he decided on using was just perfect. The way Natasha’s shoulder-length hair flowed into the wind, as she looked up at Tony, whose posture was nervous, and looked out to the world, thinking about something. Maybe they were having a deep conversation. Steve didn’t know. But this was a colour design, and he really wanted to get it right, to capture the moment. He was spending a lot of free time on it.
to see that,” he smirked, and then went under the small roof of the boat to start the engine up, as he slowly pulled away from the shore. Steve probably would have liked to gone with him.
“Something’s…bothering you. Look, I didn’t mean to go behind your back, though I know it might look that way.”
“Your hormones are changing,” Bruce said, typing something into the expert machines of the medical lab, designed mostly by Tony, with Friday decoding all the data for them, “Tony, I have no idea what this is. Your
“A new core memory is being created!” Sadness said. They all followed where it was going, but Joy stayed at the control table, in bliss, as the kiss went deeper.
“Oh, um,” Steve blushed, scratching behind his ear cutely, “I didn’t mean anything by that – I just, you know, er…”
The next day, Steve found himself sitting on the beach, drowning in the memories of the war, of what it was like, with bloodied bodies on the beaches, scratching itches as they looked on at the guts floating in the dark waves next to them in the boats. Suddenly he was pulled out of his reverie as Natasha startled him, and flinched, and wiped at his eyes, surprised.
Trusting and confiding in others, apart from his therapist who he had on good authority had sworn secrecy, was just something he didn’t
“N-nothing,” Tony said, taking Steve’s hands and caressing them. He leaned in to kiss Steve, and they made out for a good, long while (Joy was having a great time). Mouths colliding, tongues exploring and quick breathes, and then Steve sighed.
Tony looked at the sick he had produced on the floor, feeling nauseated, threatening to heave again. The suit’s cool metal arm slapping him on his back was not very helpful, and he batted the hand away. Dum-E started coming over, beeping as he got his dust-pan and brush out, but not before Tony was sick again, adding to the pile, unable to stop the bile and sickly contents that retched out, and was still finding it hard to breathe. His face felt tight.
“It’s ok,” Steve said, and was back on the comms again, “Guys, where are you, we need you to land here
Tony could tell something was on his mind, and while he couldn’t really be bothered, he reluctantly asked, “Something up, C-Steve?”
Time was running out. Steve grabbed Tony’s wrist, and just looked at Tony in fear, and shaking his head in disbelief.
“Tony? Hang on,” Steve said desperately, holding him more firmly in his arms, as Tony made croaky sounds and struggled. “Tony, it’s me, please, calm down,” Steve wrestled to calm Tony, and it seemed to work. Steve took a deep breath and thrust back into his abdomen again. A harrowing cough came from Tony, and he was bent over, spitting things out.
“I know,” Tony looked at him condescendingly, “Doesn’t mean you aren’t. You do a great job at being the team mom.”
Steve kisses back gently and experimentally at first, and then just can’t help putting it all into it, taking a breath and connecting with Tony’s luscious lips passionately, as his other hand took hold of Tony’s waist, so Tony was wrapped warmly in his arms.
“Never busy for you,” Steve says quietly. Tony strokes his face, and Steve shuts his eyes blissfully, and then he bares his neck as Tony sucked under his jaw, and he squeezes Tony’s butt, biting his lips in want.
The next day, Tony decided to fuck it. He’s in the sun, it’s warm – so why not do some sunbathing? There was a beautiful little cove with palm trees next to his lounger where he was on the beach. Natasha came wordlessly to join him, wearing a tankini with a thin dress over the top. She said she burns easily.
to do it without you. I mean, being love with you ain’t easy you know, so, er, come back to me. When you can. So we can talk and you can make fun of me or…But know that I’m here. And I sure as hell ain’t going anywhere, not as long as you need someone to remind you how much you’re needed, wanted,
“So, in conclusion,” Tony said, putting down his wine on the table, “The world is still shitty, but at least now everyone knows more about its shittiness, so people are more aware and are trying to do something about it.”
“Tony! Come on, please,” he said worriedly, and put his head to his chest where he kept his thermal under-suit on. He thought he could hear a faint heartbeat. He then put his face close to Tony’s, but he couldn’t feel breath there. He waited. He wasn’t breathing.
Ok, now he just sounded creepy, or objectifying him. Or reassuring his anxiety? Why in the world was this so hard to figure out?
“Yea, well, you know me. Specially made ultrasounds just for times like these,” Tony smiled sarcastically, and Bruce pursed his lips.
“Aw, I knew you were a softie at heart,” Tony said, and laughed a bit to break the tension, as he patted Steve on the back.
“Now, Clint, what do you think of that hiking trip I was telling Hill about?” Steve turned towards him.
“Hey, Cap,” Tony said in a friendly way, then realised he was waving his hand around a bit. With. A gun. Which Steve saw. Which. Wasn’t. Good.
Tony nodded, then sighed. He felt a slight contraction every now and then, which was his body preparing, or at least trying to prepare, for the birth.
Steve let out a little huff and smiled at Natasha. “No, really. I just wanna stay in case he wakes up.”
“Tell me, Cap’n,” Tony whispered seductively, his eyes hooded looking up to Steve’s which were only a few inches above his, as he smoothed Tony’s back. “Does this feel…bad to you?”
like you. You could be my best friend, if you were open to it, though I knew you – well, you resented me,” Steve said sadly, looking down. He knew Tony was looking at him, listening pensively.
“You are not coming. You’re on leave as Iron Man. How could you think coming with us to fight robots is a good idea right now?”
“Not that I’m complaining but – we haven’t exactly done this in a while and now you just – do you just want to...?” He looked at Tony questioningly.
,’” he mimics, “Pull yourself together, Stark.” He shakes his head. “I think I can cry if I want to. Not hurting anyone, is it?” He turns around, looking for anyone to ‘object’. “No? Good. Because not only am I never
“He means he wants you too, you dumbass!” Rhodey said, “You two have serious communication issues. Honestly,” Rhodey turned to the others, who laughed as he rolled his eyes, and then they filtered away to give them some privacy as Tony glared at them.
Maybe it’s because of the slight estrangement lately that makes things more desperate, but not rushed, just sensual, hot, and
The new core memory was one of acceptance, and relief that he kissed back, mostly of joy, with only a touch of the other emotions. Overall, a good result.
“Wait, no – I don’t want the whole world,” Steve protested, getting up, and Tony sighed. “I just want you.”
“It would probably be a good idea,” Bruce said, his face a sympathetic gesture, “He’s gonna find out eventually, especially if this is serious, which it likely is.”
“It’s not fair how he’s been treated, don’t you see, Joy? He deserves this, he deserves happiness, to be treated right, and dammit I will treat him right!”
that had been knocked down furiously, with slightly dysfunctional coping mechanisms. One of the things Sandy had said to him while explaining why he was feeling the way he was feeling. Oh, she’s like, a psychiatrist or psychologist as well as a therapist apparently, Tony wasn’t really listening, but boy she knew her stuff. She had explained that he wasn’t a narcissist, but it was a front he had put on over the course of his life to disguise his inner self doubt, etcetera etcetera, and now he was stripped bare and vulnerable and not knowing who to trust.
Tony felt better since he had Jarvis set up a mini radar on his phone and any other devices he wants, so he would know if anyone was approaching, so he wouldn’t get caught unexpected. He kept flinching, and it was beginning to really annoy him. He’d rather avoid any surprises where he can.
“No. I’m going. Teach him the ways of the world, I trust you. I think,” she smiles and gets up, taking her towel with her.
“I might have to go,” she says, almost reluctantly, as if she doesn’t want to leave, or feels she has to stay.
“Really...” Steve stopped what he was doing and considered this. Tony smirked, and went back to tidying up.

Some things may be drawn from.experiences.but . i try. and if you like this, or just want to share your thoughts and feelings, please comment. it would help. thanks. :)
“Yes sir,” Tony replied mockingly, as he let go of the shelf and immediately put his hands around Steve’s head and shoulders for support, his fingers inadvertently blocking Steve’s eyes.
“Even if some of what you’re saying is true – this ‘complex’ I have,” Steve decided to roll with it, “Is that so bad? Doesn’t everyone do that from time to time? Do some good deed,
“No, Tony…” Steve rubbed his back, supporting most of Tony’s weight, “Don’t…It’s gonna be okay.” Tears were forming in his eyes, and he couldn’t even help it.
“It may help…to get things off your chest. There are no expectations here, though. I want you to know that. I want to help combat your negative thought patterns, in order for you to gain more control in your life. I know it will take time. But it gets better.”
He supposed he saw the point of the activity. Feeling he was less alone. She talked about how his feelings were normal, and that his feelings could never not be normal, because they’re his own, even if some are irrational, which is common.
“We did it,” Tony smiled down at their daughter and back at Steve, who had to sit down next to Tony on the bed due to the sheer shock of relief, and of wanting to be close to them both.
Steve considered this for a moment. Tony had Rhodey, Happy, Pepper…and he supposed if there was no one else, the Avengers were the next closest thing they had, and besides, those three didn’t know the truth of what had happened.
It wasn’t too difficult to lift the boat off its hinges and drag it along the beach, even without help. Tony was complaining a small amount about not really needing any help, but he looked happy soon enough as he put his sunglasses on and clamoured in the boat. He was exploring it, making sure everything was in its place and still working. He hadn’t been down here at the beach in a while, after all.
UPDATE 2021 - I am not going to properly continue this fic, so am marking it almost complete (4/5). I am thinking of adding another (probably final) chapter to show headcanons/bullet points of my ideas of what happened next :)
. They both get naked soon enough, and the room is dark, and Tony is climbing all over Steve, whispering in a rush about needing more lube, and Steve is all over it, he just slathers it over his dick, moaning weakly, and smooths it inside Tony’s ass, most common sense having gone out the window. Tony still kisses him ferociously and mercilessly, and Steve’s a hell of a competitor too, but Tony has to remind himself to breathe since oxygen is something he still needs, apparently. Tony props himself on top of Steve, he’s ready for the burn, welcoming it, relishing the feeling of Steve inside of him, steadying himself on Steve’s
“Tony-” Steve’s voice was muffled by Tony’s body. Which he dreamt of happening, but in a much different way.
“No, it’s too risky!” Steve said indignantly, retrieving his shield, as he shoved down the door and stared at the complicated mechanics on the wall. There were no civilians in the near vicinity, but the other avengers were around here somewhere. As long as they could stop the one, their mission would be completed. He approached forward.
“Is it not just a Tony island? I feel like it’s a Tony island,” Disgust theorised, “Like, specifically for him. If not, he definitely needs his own island.”
His therapist showed him several stories of people dealing with different things. One person talks about how people didn’t believe him when he confessed that he was kidnapped and tortured, humiliated. It just ‘doesn’t happen’ to normal people. Tony huffed at that. People had an easy enough time believing
“So…” Tony started. He didn’t really know what to say now. Usually the arguing goes on for a lot longer, or the other person just storms away, too fed up.
Steve had a semi-steady job. The Avengers HQ is where he normally works or trains when he’s not on a mission, and he usually stays at the tower, which is pretty much now his permanent place of residence, preparing missions, reading or also training. He works and sometimes socialises with other agents or employees, goes out occasionally with Sam but not that often because he doesn’t any longer enjoy those kind of ‘normal’ social outings. But he has those he can trust. He’s getting used to life in this century. Even though it still hurts, all of what he's lost, and the challenges of this new life.
“Well, you're probably not too far off, but I am working on it. I am sorry, Tony. About all of this.”
“I don’t wanna do that!” He says loudly as she walks away, where Clint is walking towards her. Luckily, Tony was wise enough to wear knee length shorts and a t-shirt, not one for showing off the bod lately…But it was enough to top up the tan. If he was going in a casket, he wanted to look damn
“Tony, it’s ok, it’s gonna be ok,” Steve said solemnly, holding onto him as he went into a coughing fit again, his face scrunched up, in pain, discomfort, fear.
“No, not really,” Tony answered, looking down. “It did at first. I mean, my whole wing was…it was coming off. Installing a new one just took a bit of getting used to. Once I calibrated it with the same velocity and core power of my other wing, everything became much easier.” Tony now had his natural wing curled around his front, where he was nervously picking at some of his feathers, which Steve noticed he sometimes did as a habit. He was stroking where the red became yellow, and had a fond look of pride in his eyes, and Steve loved it more than anything in the world.
A nurse and a doctor came in and slowly removed the tube from his throat. Steve had to move out of the way for them to do their thing, to make sure he was okay.
Steve rubbed his thumb along Tony’s ear, and Tony let out a small little sound, and held onto Steve’s shirt, angling his head for a better position.
“Do I have something on me?” Tony eyed Steve sceptically, looking for the truth. Then he looked down at his top, wiped at it, and looked at his three-quarter length sleeves, see if there was any dirt anywhere. Maybe he just didn’t look that good, and nobody wanted to mention it.
“Farewell, son of Athena,” Tony said in a more genuine tone, not really wanting to move, watching Steve as he turned his back to him. “I hope our paths cross again."
“My reputation does, and as you know, you can’t hurt me, Athenian," Tony said, letting out a groan as he was pushed back, pushing Steve with his hands. “You can’t win against me in a battle.”
Tony could feel his heart racing; it couldn’t be true, right? His feelings for Steve were taking over him, and to hear that the other man felt the same way made him panic, all in a good way. Nothing before seemed to be going well for Tony Stark, but that man showed up to change everything.
Steve wrapped his arms around himself tightly. “I would’ve liked to think otherwise, so far I seem to be hoping that that will be the truth,” he said, “but alas I seem to be mistaken yet again.”
Tony ducked as he saw Steve’s fists coming towards him, targeting a soldier behind them who tried to attack Tony when he leaned down to help Steve.
Giving pep talks wasn't his forte, in fact, he never thought that he would give one, but there he was, standing in front of his own grave giving a pep talk, heart to heart, to Captain America of all people.
The looks they were giving to each other were nothing but hateful, the tension being at it’s peak as soon as they started circling each other.
“That’s big coming from you, you know. That’s for thinking that you would give yourself to anyone else but me..”, he said in his more possessive tone, his hands moving to rub Steve’s back, glad to be finally acknowledged.
Steve kissed Tony just as deeply, feeling the intense emotion that he was putting into the kiss, their tongues moving together. The moment that Tony kissed him, he took the time to re-open his eyes to admire Tony’s face, his leg movements slowing down as Tony's kiss calmed him a little.
“We call this, Operation Rebirth. We are planning to take veteran soldiers like you who were injured in battle and give them what they lost back, but only better.”
It seemed stupid to him sometimes, but he could really see a future, a life with Steve. He was close to marrying others before and was deprived of that chance, but if Steve said yes.. He sure hoped that he would, Tony even thought of the perfect chance to propose one day, of where they would live, of how they would organise their life. That thought made him smile as he was sitting alone at the office, spinning his chair and looking outside the huge glass window. He built a name for himself, he formed the Avengers, he was the Invincible Iron Man. Despite that, he failed too many times in his life before, he fell low, he was constantly battling alcoholism, but one person was always there; Steve. He owed him so much, he couldn’t even thank him enough for everything that he gave to him, and this was one of the reasons why everything that Steve did, every little thing meant do much to Tony. A simple smile or a touch of their hands together could mean so much more to him, and even if Steve never said those words in return, Tony kept repeating them. He didn’t do it because he wanted to hear them back, he did it because that’s how he felt, because Steve deserved to know.
“I was torn too,” Steve said. “I tried to be a God and I watched her... I watched her live without me. I pushed her away for my own duties and I lost her. I would never wish that fate upon anyone, Tony. It was at that moment that I wished I was human, just that once.”  He smiled very faintly, almost sadly. “Perhaps, I have been summoned here by the fates to help you become human.”
It’s not like Tony didn’t know that he had to do that, it was reckless and plain stupid to reject the advice, or rather, order that he was given, wondering if keeping his helmet on could be an option. Steve hardly saw him shirtless, he normally wore gym appropriate clothes when training together. And it wasn’t like Steve gawked at his body (or did he??) to remember how he was shaped like under his clothes.
Tony did the same, and it was then when their hands brushed against each other, both of them pulling away quickly. It couldn’t be, was Steve actually..
For a few moments, neither of them said anything. Steve eventually lifted his own arms, wrapping them around Tony’s waist. It was comforting, even though no words were being said.
“So, how long have you been out here for?”, Steve asked, having to shout to be heard through the storm and the loud noises of both the helicopters and the people trying to get everything in order.
“It’s Christmas Eve tomorrow, we need something more..special. I think I pretty much got it, why don’t you let me handle tomorrow’s one?”
“I love my people... Tony... But I try and do everything I can for them, I just... Perhaps I need to be away, to think,” he said. “To be with you.”
The flight wasn’t stable, Steve had to try his hardest to stay on track as he was flying out the city and towards the facility that he had been to for the past couple of days. He could hear people screaming or taking pictures, but didn’t care; his priority was to get there as soon as possible and make everyone who was involved in this pay. He tried really hard not to think of Tony’s reaction; he did feel bad, he most likely wasn’t behind this, just like he had sworn, but that seemed like a personal battle, he had to deal with those people who used them alone. Then again, he also knew that Tony would take it personally just as much, they used his name and money to fund this sickening operation when Stark only wanted to do something good for a change. Maybe he was too harsh, but it had to wait, his priorities rested elsewhere.
Steve gasped loudly, chest rising against Tony's mouth, and he looked down at Tony with his brow furrowed. He'd never felt that before.
Once he had secured the other, they slowly moved down, placing Steve on the ground and testing the rope for ascension. Hard, but feasible.
Steve tilted his head, eager to meet Tony’s lips since he was comfortable with kissing, and he traced the other man's lips with his tongue before locking their lips together.
Steve smiled, but he was really mocking him. Tony’s reply satisfied him, only adding to his previous statements. He looked around, like he was searching for an approval ad he turned down to him again. “Always showing off, having a way out”, he said.
Steve moved from one to the other eventually, sucking at Tony’s body, taking his time in tasting how sweet it was.  He gazed up at Tony for his reaction, licking his lips as he continued to kiss down Tony’s beautifully shaped body, along his olive skin.
Steve raised his head and looked at Tony, biting his lip. “Tony, this is, It’s...” He said at a loss for words.
“I’m going after him”, Tony replied, quickly putting his helmet back on and heading for the opening.
“I’m getting you some dry clothes and food, just ask if you need anything else, okay? No need to feel shy”
“And you think that you and whatever men you have creeping around can stop Captain America? Really, Obi? I feel sorry for you”, Tony laughed, receiving a menacing smile from Stane.
“If this isn't a joke… then you must be one of those shapeshifter guys. Yes, that must be it…”, Tony mumbled as he leaned against the glass.
“Zola and... Zola and Tarleton staged the whole thing, this project isn’t real! The accidents.. the candidates, they are all behind them, they are the ones who took your legs away from you, they planned it so you would end joining this project, that they would experiment on you the way they wanted, that they would get those new super soldiers the hard way-”
Steve’s beamed at him, wrapped his arms around Tony tightly. “And for you saying that, I am eternally grateful.”
He had what many would call a crash landing, falling on the nearby road and getting himself together; he was going to do it, he was going to make them pay. As he walked towards the door and kicked it open, he felt a sharp pain on his legs, falling down and screaming as the pain moved on the back of his pain.
“That’s what you say; I think you’ve done a lot more than you can possibly imagine;" Tony corrected him.
“Don’t die,” Steve said, kissing Tony softly to hide how much he wished his next words would be true. “I need you to save my people.”
“Thanks”, he replied as he took them, following Tony’s directions and heading into the bathroom to change into the dry clothes. He came out a few minutes later, seeing Tony already in his new clothes and with a pizza box in front of him, sitting on the couch.
Tony opened his mouth to reply, but he stopped, trying to consider his answer. What did he want, really? Whatever it was that he wanted needed to be shared with Steve, but he didn’t want to force Steve to do anything, or even be here against his will. “Do you? I’m not saying that I don’t, but you need to be clear with me, Athenian. Why do you keep doing this? Why are you touching me, kissing him in such intimate ways?”
Tony rubbed the back of his head and avoided to look straight at him. “I can’t say for sure what happened to your little apartment, pal. Or the state you would find it in to. But I’ll find a way to get you there if that’s what you really want”
“I’m not doing this to get anything out of it other than the chance to inspire others. I don’t want anything else out of it.”
Tony dragged his tongue down the centre of Steve's chest, hands rubbing Steve's waist gently as he breathed heavily against Steve’s skin. “Steve...” he murmured.
“I’m here, Steve, everything is okay, I can stop any time,” Tony said slowly, stopping the pressure when he felt Steve tightening around him. “Just relax. Breathe,” he said, kissing Steve's tensed back.
“Nothing?”, Bruce asked as he looked up from his screen as soon as Steve and Thor walked inside, back from yet another scouting mission at the other side of the country.
It was impressive, Steve had to hold himself back from whistling as he looked around at the paintings and furniture.
Tony was taken off guard by the man’s words, not having realised that he was in fact going through the same dilemmas and worries. “And that’s because you’ve changed me, you showed me the way, a different path! That’s how you made me fall in love with you, you took me out of this dark pit full of war and killing," Tony yelled in return, avoiding a wave of arrows aimed at them.
Steve looked at him carefully yet again, sighing. He knew exactly what Tony was referring to; Bucky’s death. He just attended the funeral himself, but he knew something, that his friend was indeed alive, something that he wasn’t allowed to let Tony know. Still, he could so visibly tell that the billionaire was concerned and he didn’t just come all the way down here just to hand in his repaired Steve. He wanted to actually talk, something that they did a lot, more frequently back in the day. It took them some time to open up to each other again after everything that they went through.
“You don’t have to deal with this, I got it”, Steve replied, sounding agitated. “I think it’s better for you to get some sleep now”
“So.. is that what love should feel like? Softening each other’s harsh lives? What if I can make it all better for you?”, Steve said after a long pause.
“If you were alive, what stories would you tell?”, Tony asked the body, arms crossed as he leaned a bit closer, the man’s eyelashes resting peacefully.
If he'd only managed to express his thoughts in a different way than the one he'd always known, maybe Steve would be there still, discussing all kinds of things while eating their black broth, Tony laughing as the Athenian grimaced at the smell.
Steve swallowed again, this time much more audibly. He leaned back on the table, letting his lower back rest on the cold steel surface which sent shivers down his spine. He’d always secretly had a thing for Tony’s suits. Initially it started as a fear, then it evolved into a fascination the more he worked with him and the more he saw and then finally it turned into a love for them. Always admiring the intricate detailing and the small quirks that would be installed, always a mystery that he wanted to know more about. Tony even created a suit for him, the Iron Patriot, but it had been stolen, still that didn’t stop Tony from trying to build him a new one. His eyes couldn’t focus on the suits face and he kept his head turned, his blush now forming over his cheeks.
“Aha, so you do like my company”, Tony said with a softer smile. “Well, I can’t be Tony much, but I really enjoy it now. I enjoyed myself when we were watching that play, when we talk... What about you? I like Steve more than the guy hitting me with his shield back in Sparta.”
“Them…?”, Steve asked, resisting the urge to gasp loudly when he was faced with yet another horrific sight, straight out of a sick and twisted horror movie.
“Oh shut up, will ya?”, Tony’s voice was heard from the door, holding what it seemed to look like a gun and shooting an energy beam towards the scientists. Zola shrieked, his controller falling on the ground and starting to scream orders to the armed soldiers.
“I’m sure she was as beautiful as the photo makes her”, Tony said softly, in a way making sure that Steve was staying with him in reality, not to be lost in his memories again. Sure, he understood how overwhelming it felt, but he needed to a grip, just in case. It almost shocked him that the soldier didn’t break down, not even when they stood in front of Peggy’s grave, so he was being careful.
“Tony, Captain America might not be here now but.. I hope that Steve Rogers is good enough for you..”, he said softly.
“Here we are. If you need anything, let me know”, she announced, lightly pushing Steve outside the elevator.
Tony seemed as though he was keen to protect Steve's people, which Steve loved, and the man was determined, smart and charismatic, all magnetising qualities that drew Steve closer and closer each time he spoke.
He didn’t even blink when he felt the large, wet tongue against his cheek, Steve’s way of kissing him now, careful not to leave any slober on him. He smiled; he was cute, he would give him that, cute to see how much of an effort Steve was putting into still being that same boyfriend.
“I can’t help it..”, he mumbled. “I told you before.. and I do remember this very clearly. I care about you more than you think..”
That night, he was sitting near the bar, his chin resting on his hands as he was inspecting the regulars, making sure that his girls were doing their job and that everyone was pleased in general. Of course they were, the music was loud enough, the girls’ laugh was echoing, drinks were being served and the games of poker in the back seemed to go well. He sat up properly, fixing his dark red waistcoat and pushed his gelled hair back, casually walking over to the bar and getting a glass of whiskey for himself. He knew that people were talking about his alcoholism, but he thought that he damn deserved a break, and drinking did make him happy in the end of the day. He wasn’t really paying attention to the conversations, but something in particular raised his interest.
“Oh yeah, they turn invisible, don’t worry. And yes, I can eat and drink”, Tony confirmed. “We just..need to be careful with this, my boss mustn’t know about this, not at all.. He’s huge and hard as a rock.. But it will work”, he finally replied, smiling at the thought.
“O-on top of the Tower! Last floor, just outside..!”, the man stuttered, falling on the ground and crawling towards the exit as Steve let him fall, adjusting his shield and running towards the staircase.
The way the man pronounced his name sent a shiver down Steve’s back, rubbing the back of his head as he walked down to his desk again. That night could be quite eventful the way he saw it.
“Hey.. we all make mistakes, I don’t think that I would trust myself, to be honest.. But I have an idea of where to go after this. But, I need your help.”
“Breaking news! Well known industrialist billionaire Tony Stark has been missing from his privates quarters in New York earlier this morning. Personal assistant Pepper Potts says that signs of struggle were observed in the scene, and police forces are doing their hardest to invest a case of kidnapping, similar to the events of two years ago”, she said.
“Steve Rogers would be more than just good enough.. maybe even better than Cap”, Tony replied with a faint smile.
“And I'm sure that he’ll try. I can save my own skin. And I've got Rhodey on my back. Not to mention the Avengers.”
Tony felt the heat rising in his own cheeks as Steve seemed astonished by his actions, but the fact that he asked to reciprocate surprised him in such a pleasant way. “Yes,” he nodded sitting still as he kept his eyes on Steve's beautiful, heart shaped lips; the lips he'd just kissed. “Yes you can.”
Tony’s chest felt heavy; this might not have been him, but to think that he died in this universe really was a shock. “And why should I trust you then? If you got him killed, you’ll do the same to me, won’t you? I can look after my own self just fine!”
“This was your second chance, and you once more let your superiority complex lead you. Perhaps the man that I had met in Thebes was just... A façade.”
Steve pulled back to let Tony see the basic image. “What do you think it is supposed to be?” he asked.
“I can imagine you doing that, it sounds like you”, Steve said as he turned his attention to the screen.
Her voice was dripping poison, and under her mask there was without a doubt the most sadistic smile. There was no guarantee that she would let them go out unharmed if he handed her the artifact, but his options were limited, and to be honest, he didn’t fancy being shot at and left for dead in a random cave in Argentina.
He gazed at the card and nodded, placing it down along with the now empty bottle of water, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand and grabbing a towel to dab around his neck and forehead, brushing away strands of hair that had managed to escape his always perfectly curtained style.
“I’m here no matter what, got it?” he told Steve again, wanting to make sure that he was serious about that.
“But you don’t have Ares as your father, it’s....different. He doesn’t follow logic, not when I try to reason with him," Tony tried to explain. “I’m not allowed to be myself around him, or any Spartan. And never mind, I thought that I could learn some things from you, and you from me. Teaching each other, just like you suggested. I don’t know about you, but I want to stick close to people, and they always seem to... disappear. I don’t know if it’s our blood, but they tend to vanish.”
“Just keep Steve around and I’m sure he’ll follow,” Tony nodded, enjoying the gentle touches, and enjoying such delicacy from Steve. He wasn't used to such affection.
“You have proven that you pride yourself in violence, and once more that you feed on fear,” Steve said with a stern glare. “There is not much more to it. You were only willing to accept once you had broken me down; I don’t need pity from you.”
His morning routine involved him putting on a neutral face and wheeling into the main sitting area, conversing with the others, especially with another soldier around his age who was missing an arm. He seemed to be more accepting of his disability, then again, Steve would remind himself, he could walk. His daily life didn’t change to such an extreme level, but he sworn that the guy, James, offered to stay longer in the hospital to be closer to the people he befriended.
“Rhodey”, Tony said, stepping in front of him and Steve. “This is..Steve Rogers, codename, Captain America.. but we’re trying to keep it low, his request was to-”
Steve nodded, almost boyishly, his arms reaching up and holding Tony to his chest lightly. “I would like that,” he said, “and you can teach me your people's ways.”
“I.. I saved you”, Steve said as he got up, holding Tony, both of them battered up but close to each other. “I’m pretty sure you’re safe now..”
“I’m no common siren, Athenian. I’m trying to help you and you don’t want my help, you want to give up and die like a hero, but you know what? Knowing what is going to happen and not trying to change it doesn’t make you a hero. A hero is born when he defeats all odds and does his best to change what’s written in stone, and that’s what I’m going to go. You might choose to run back to Athens and mourn what’s not even lost, but I’m going to fight,” he said as he let go. “With or without you.”
“Hm..”, Steve said, unable to take something that serious so lightly like Tony did. He wanted to hope that the billionaire was indeed careful and not as carefree as he claimed to be, especially when he knew that people wouldn’t hesitate to plot against him.
“I waited forever for this, I think I can handle 10 more minutes”, Tony said with a nod, letting Steve rest by his side as he carried on rubbing his back, so pleased and eager to see what else was in store for them that night whilst Steve shut his eyes, gently relaxing, feeling looked after and thinking that perhaps he should’ve done this sooner, but good things come to those who wait, and swallowing his pride for once bore great results indeed. Though there was this nagging thought that he’d had all along that brought a small smirk to his lips as he recuperated his energy;
“Come on, you can’t be serious?! An Irish man who doesn’t drink? What kind of person is that?” Tony asked surprised.
“That changes not the fate of my people, this plight is pointless,” Steve said, “Love is something I know nothing of, nor can I teach you about such things.”
“Is that all, then?” Tony asked, not sure if he wanted to hear the answer. “When you look at me, you see nothing but a fake interest and disappointment?”
Steve pursed his lips before he spoke, always truthful and honest. “You’re protecting my people. You said that you would if you allowed me to learn from you and you learn from me,” he said, “I thought that was our deal?”
Tony wrapped his arms around Steve and held him close, tilting his head to give Steve better access, his fingers later moving up to Steve's head and into his hair as he let out soft whimpers of satisfaction.
“I was kidnapped and tortured a few years back. Was doing a tour, demonstrating a new missile that I created. Terrorists knew how valuable I was, how much people would pay for me, but of course, you can guess why they hated me so much. They might have wanted me alive, but nobody clarified how..alive they needed me to be. It..it wasn’t pretty. it still isn’t pretty..”
“Fits of great distemper and ceaseless frustration. Only a beautiful maiden or lad –young healers of some expertise – wielding the…” –Tony coughs– “golden rod can cleanse such torturous afflictions from the pharaoh’s body and mind, returning him to placidity and good cheer, bringing peace and prosperity to the land.”
“You’re welcome.” Steve collects himself and stands, offering the man a hand up. “Now maybe you could wash up a little. I don’t know what else will be attracted to the scent of blood.”
Tony goes to sit between his father and his new fiancé, placing a dart gun from the glove compartment on the table in front of him. “Good, because I was about to tranq you both if you couldn’t behave,” he says rather cheerfully, his face alight with mischief and good cheer.
“It’s from Britannia,” Antony says. “The shape is more like that of a hoplomachus shield though it be sized like that of a secutor, but I thought considering your history, perhaps you’d feel more at home with something like this.”
And there’s really not much to say about that, except: “I will ensure your family receives your earnings. You have my word.” Stefanus raises the tip of his sword to the base of the defeated man’s neck.
“No can do, Private First Class Dum Dum,” Tony says brightly. He waves at a gaggle of girls passing by. One of them, a striking redhead named Sunset, is younger than most, but at twenty, the graduate student is still two years his senior. They had had a passing flirtation Tony’s sophomore year until she realized just how young he was and told him to look her up when he turned eighteen. Tony had planned to, but by the time his birthday rolled around, he had heard disturbing rumors about how she had suckered that rube Justin Hammer out of some early prototypes. None of what she stole had been functional of course, but it was the thought that counted.
“Of course it’s not the gold itself, my good man, but perhaps if the device contained beneficial fungi or had something of medicinal value growing on the surface, and scientists are able to isolate and propagate it… why, can you imagine how many people could be helped with such a discovery?”
Bacchus swallows his apprehension. “It seems it is our turn in the arena,” he announces resolutely, turning to face Stefanus. “Let’s put on a good showing, yeah?”
In all, Stark is gentler than what Steve had expected of the Mandalorian. His touches are needy and spread like fire across Steve’s skin, hot and electrifying, but when he takes him from behind, he presses slow but firm into Steve, causing him to gasp, to nearly squirm at the foreign intrusion.
“They’re stainless steel. Rust-proof and nonperishable. Home Depot used to sell them, and I can’t imagine they were the first things that flew off the shelves when the apocalypse hit.”
Tony ignores him, sweeping the flashlight from side to side across the wall of the burial chambers to read the hieroglyphics contained within.
The other boy is more serious than Suibne has ever seen him as he helps him fold the toga in the fashion of the freeborn, with the excess at one end flung over his shoulder. He completes the look with the pendant, but when Suibne goes to remove it, the other boy stays his hand.
“Really? I have the same thing, except mine are superheroes,” Tony shows Steve his set-up. “Welcome to Stark-tropolis, home of the Avengers.” He picks up each minifigure, excitedly introducing them to Steve in turn. He holds up a red-head wearing black. “This is ex-KGB assassin Natasha Romanov, named after that princess who went missing after the commies killed her family…” then a man wearing glasses and a lab coat “and this is Bruce Banner. He’s a super smart biologist, but he has anger issues and transforms into a big unstoppable green monster when upset.” He picks up a minifigure he scavenged from a rare Norse mythology set he got in Norway – “And this is Thor, God of Thunder, maybe you’ve heard of him; he was kicked out of Asgard by his dad for being too much of a smart-ass” – followed by another he had taken from an old limited-edition Robin Hood set. He had painted this figure purple as it used to be his favorite color, but now he has regrets considering the poor guy no longer blended into Sherwood Forest. “And this is Hawkeye. He’s an expert marksman and spy. He talks constantly, never shuts up really.”
And so Tony relents, “Then find me a new assistant, and remember: No beauties. That means no models, no actresses, no cigarette girls, no damn wolves in silk stockings.” He didn’t need another Gialetta, his last long-term assistant and lover turned Nazi sympathizer.
The shield Tony gifts Steve is based on the Wandsworth Shield, a round Celtic bronze shield from the Iron Age. Yes, it might have been part of a larger oblong shield, but let’s pretend it’s not, okay?
“Yeah. Yeah, I’m staying.” He sits down with the proffered art supplies, sketching out the outline of a large, muscular man.
He lifts his head to meet Steve’s lips once again, a hand snaking into Steve’s pants, tracing the outline of his generous erection. Tony hasn’t been with anyone in months, not since he’s gotten sober, and he wonders how much he’ll have to stretch to accommodate Steve.
The Stark Energizer satellite should maintain Purple Man’s hold on Stark, like it has the Avengers and the general populace, but still, Purple Man never leaves his side. He can feel it sometimes, Stark testing the bounds of his mental captivity, tapping at the purple ties that bind them together in his mind. He’s not strong enough, will never be strong enough, not at this range.
Tony practically deflates. “Aw… can’t you let me off early this one time?” he tries to wheedle. “Bruce and I are working on a robotics project that will knock your socks off.”
And then Afghanistan happened, and he wasn’t sure his heart could take it. Literally. That was followed by the whole palladium situation. Who could think of children when one was dying? His body had become hostile territory. And then by the time he got that sorted out and Dr. Cho fixed his heart, giving him a mostly-clean bill of health, well… Tony was 42, and his window had passed. It was too late. Perhaps it had all been for the best, he had thought. He would have made a terrible parent.
“We must be scrapping the bottom of the barrel if we’re accepting the likes of you.” Hodge, the star pupil of the Savrip Clan and son of a Senator, had taken one look at Steve in his grubby shift and lack of proper belongings and decided his (lack of) worth. He had even pushed Steve’s cot closer to the latrines, declaring he smelled like he belonged there.
Tony had thought of summers as mother-son bonding time, a time for them to catch up without class or his father’s interference…
“You give yourself to me because you must, but you would freely choose Bacchus if you could,” he murmurs, reaching down to lightly cup Stefanus’s cock. “Do you use this when you’re with him?” Antony gives him a stroke, but Stefanus is cold to it, pointedly looking away from the man standing before him violating his body. Antony must find his response unsatisfactory because he reaches around, grabbing the meat of his ass. “Or does he get to touch you here?” Stefanus holds still, stubbornly refusing the react.
There is something wrong with them, with each clone having been compromised at exactly the same moment to turn on Steve and Master Phillips.
“Shhh…” he breathes, lips and tongue dancing along his tense back, his strong arms tightly locked over Steve’s chest. “Let me take care of you. You trust me to take care of you, don’t you?”
“You saw the state of the bodies back there. It’s been at least a year, and the roof is mostly holding. No food. No rain. Any that are left have probably dried up to nothing.”
Stark grimaces and pops the lid, inspiring a fresh shudder from Rogers. The man’s muscles tense up, and his body looks much too stiff for this to be comfortable, but Captain America is no stranger to pain. Still…
Bacchus shrugs and returns to his meal. “Rich men are fickle. Accept his favor for as long as it lasts along with any tokens of appreciation he may bestow on you, but do not expect it to amount to much more than that.” He points his spoon at his friend. “And do
And maybe it’s the praise or the breathy quality in Stark’s voice or the fact that Steve’s never done this before, never felt so good, but when Stark reaches up to manually turn Steve’s head to capture his lips, Steve comes with a groan, his body slipping down as he shudders and nearly flops down, lax and sated. He barely even registers the way Stark comes shortly after in a burst of wetness spilling over his thighs, but he does notice when the mattress dips as the man slips off.
Tiberius had been older than Antony, having already dedicated his toga praetexta and bulla to Lares two years prior and graduated to the white toga virilis of manhood. He had come with his family to visit the nearby Servilia family monument and had slipped away during the ritual offering.
It apparently isn’t, because Dr. Ferguson persists undeterred. “Mr. Stevens, what do you feel is wrong in your life?”
He doesn’t know what to expect from the man, and so he is surprised when he later learns (by way of a complaint from a regular) that Stefanus is off-limits. Apparently, Antony had negotiated an exclusive contract for his services with Priscus until the end of the election season, being not one to ‘share.’
But Antony only shakes his head. “Quite the contrary. It would please me greatly to please you, so I think tonight I would like your company instead. With our clothes on, of course.” Stefanus must look perplexed, because he explains, “I paid for the night, and you will stay the night, but I think I would much prefer to dine with you and hear more about your travels. That is an unusual accent you have; from where do you hail, Stefanus? How did you become a gladiator? I am all ears.”
Stefanus does grow. Whether due to hearty food, exercise, or simply by virtue of a late growth spurt or some combination of the above, he lengthens and fills out until Fidelis decides he is large enough and strong enough to train as a full-fledged retiarius wearing the loincloth, galerus, and manica of his brethren. His enhanced musculature has other advantages as well. Priscus loses sexual interest in him once he outgrows his boyish proportions with the toga praetexta looking all the more ridiculous on his adult frame. That doesn’t stop his dominus from prostituting him out for more discreet liaisons with men of less socially-acceptable taste. Though it is Stefanus’s understanding that a healthy Roman man does not lust after other adult men, his clientele doesn’t decrease as he matures past his youthful prime though the interested parties do change. Most prefer his mouth, but his ass remains fairly popular despite his undesirable body hair.
“He’s a willful one,” the slaver divulges. When the buyer goes for Suibne’s mouth, he warns him, “and he bites.” The fingers pause. “But his teeth are good. He has the full set, except at the very back. Those haven’t come in yet. He’s likely fairly young, and his beard may take years to come in.”
Stark is finishing bolting on the new external shielding when Rhodey arrives, looking somber and a touch troubled.
), who has trouble relating to his much-older peers who seem to all be into cars and swapping spit with the first girl who might let them touch her boob after three months of going steady or whatever. Tony doesn’t get the appeal, but that’s not the point. The point is that he only has one shot at a good first impression, and he needs to make it count.
“That usually doesn’t apply to one’s honeymoon.” She reaches out, her thumb rubbing a circle in the space between Steve’s thumb and forefinger.
The doctores retiarii, an ex-gladiator named Fidelis, hadn’t been impressed with ‘Stefanus,’ loudly complaining to the doctores secutorum about the quality of the men assigned to his stable.
“What you always wanted to do,” he corrects him. “Why lie to yourself? It was a team effort. The desire was in you. I just facilitated it. You’re welcome, by the by.”
His breath shallows in the claustrophobic space of his helmet, the exertion and underlying fear shortening the effort further.
“I think you should take this… honeymoon more seriously, sweetheart,” Steve grits out. “Need I remind you of the
Tony stands, pushes Steve back down in his seat by his shoulders, then spins around to deliver a mean right hook straight across the interloper’s jaw.
And if he and his team thought about it too hard, if they gave more consideration to the people the zombies had been rather than the reality of what they are now–
The antechamber is full of various treasures stacked upon each other – chariots, linen boxes inlaid with gold and lapis, other belongings and small figurines representing servants and vassals to serve the pharaoh in the afterlife strewn across fine tables carved into stylized animals – and a doorway to their right leading to the burial chamber flanked by life-size statues of his personal bodyguards.
“Pack it up, men,” James is telling the others. “Unless we can convince Stevie to play the banker, he will surely bankrupt us all save one in three throws.”
Master Phillips had. A strong pull, a hook, a tantalizing itch in his subconscious screams at him. There is a source radiating raw Force energy nearby, beckoning him closer.
. It saddens his friend that he would choose to be alone, as if Steve himself hasn’t made the self-same choice, granted without the fun of actual sex.
Steve looks happy but uncertain, like a man who has gotten everything he’s ever wanted but knows better than to trust it. There’s a moment of hesitation and then: “I– I’d like that.”
“I have charm,” Stark replies, ignoring Steve’s snort, “but I wouldn’t have to work half as hard if I looked like you.”
Tony decides to focus on the part of the apartment that does look more or less permanent. “At least you have a real bed, winghead. It sure looks comfortable.”
“Fuck you,” Antony says as he leaves Tiberius pained and breathless on the floor, grasping his sorry cock with both hands.
“Mr. Stark, I’m sure you can appreciate that though fertility declines in your early forties, it’s not entirely out of the range of possibility, and the blood test is fairly conclus–”
“We don’t have to do this if you don’t want to,” Steve tells Tony for the second time, his fist wrapped around Tony’s half-hard member. He had been trying to get Tony to rise to the occasion for the last fifteen minutes, and his failure to do so was starting to make him question whether Tony had changed his mind somewhere between the bungalow and their pool villa. “You can back out. No hard feel– I mean, I won’t hold it against you.”
In this story, Howard’s name is Marcus Staius Hadrianus, but he is popularly addressed as Hadrianus. Antonius Staius (Antony) is his only child. In real life, the Staia gens were a plebian (commoner) family in Ancient Rome. After the Conflict of Orders, the power of the patricians (aristocrats) declined, allowing plebians into government. Plebian senators were just as rich as their patrician counterparts (or sometimes more so) but were of a lower class, and there was no way for a plebian to rise to the level of a patrician, but in the later Roman period, they could marry into the patrician class and their children would become patricians. Essentially, Howard is extremely wealthy and has a seat in the Senate, but he’s new money, and he really wants Tony to marry up. Tony is not having that.
Dum Dum chuckles at that, but it falls flat. “Your parents are taking care of the arrangements, and he’s staying at the Mansion after, so… there’s that at least.”
Munera were also extremely expensive, and Augustus capped the cost of a praetor’s munus at 120 gladiators costing 25,000 denarii for an ‘economical’ munus while an imperial munus cost a minimum of 180,000 denarii.
I couldn’t figure out how to work this in, but one of my favorite ancient graffito (in addition to the examples from the last chapter) that was actually found in the gladiator barracks at Pompeii is: “Floronius benefac miles leg VII hic fuit neque mulieres scierunt nisi paucae et seserunt,” which means “Floronius, privileged soldier of the 7th legion, was here. The women did not know of his presence. Only six women came to know, too few for such a stallion.”
Dracula must have come to the same conclusion. “Perhaps I have been a touch… hasty. You will protect Anthony?” he inquires.
“It’s not a clam; it’s a helmet,” Tony protests. “He built this cool high-tech armor to fight crime. That’s how he got his name: Iron Man.”
“And the Saxons wished to not be impaled upon stakes while I dined below them,” he replies coolly. “Tell me, Steven. From where do your people hail?”
“The ink isn’t even dry, and we’re already suffering from a dead bedroom,” he laments, delicately holding up a crumpled flower, turning it this way and that in contemplation. “What happened to the man I married? Where’s your sense of adventure? Of passion and romance?”
But that was before he had come across the location of the tomb of Pharaoh Ramesses VIII, the final resting place of the Golden Rod of Destiny. Passed down from his father, the storied Ramesses III, the last great monarch of the New Kingdom, legend had it that the Golden Rod could cure all matter of ailments (except, of course, assassination). It was a long-shot, but the pull of yet another healing artifact proved too great for Tony to ignore. And so, he had phoned his long-time friend and former temporary assistant, James Rhodes, shortly after the man had settled into his role heading the Paris branch of Stark Industries.
“You’re about to lose one of the pair!” he shouts, his fingers already going for the eye gouge that Dum Dum deftly blocks. There’s a scuffle where Dum Dum takes Percival down, who sweeps out his legs then tries to kick him in the throat. Dum Dum pounces on his opponent as they roll towards the fire, knocking down and scattering the kindling as Bucky stands then advances, pulling the two apart with the help of the other four.
“I need to take off your helmet,” Steve says, reaching to lift it so he can see the extent of the damage. Perhaps he can even repair–
“Fat fuckin’ chance o’ that happenin’.” Tony hugs his pillow, angrily rolling himself into a burrito with his sheets to face the opposite direction as he mutters, “I hope yer balls shrivel up into raisins, ya asshole cocktease sonovabitch.”
“If it’s taking you an hour, then you should see a doctor,” he hollers, checking his watch for what has to be the tenth time.
Once J.A.R.V.I.S. confirms Steve’s descent down the elevator, Tony finally gets up and staggers, naked and heaving, to the en suite master bathroom.
Steve retrieves his undershirt, pulling it over his head, then bends down to pick up his button-up. “I don’t know how much longer I can do this,” he confesses, threading his arms through the sleeves before going to work on the fasteners.
“…I’m not buying you a villa,” Antony declares. “Hadrianus would have a fit, and as amusing as that would be–”
“And horny,” Steve adds, further reasoning, “You don’t gotta play coy with me. The ad asked for a male assistant, and you routed any applicants through your man in Paris ‘stead of using your own name local. Far as I can tell, you’re not sick; you don’t actually need a caretaker, so I can only think of one reason why you’d ask for a male companion so discreetly.” The insinuation is clear as day. “And then fixin’ the sleepin’ arrangements so we’d end up in the same suite? Not ‘xactly subtle, you know.”
Stark is still shaking his head, his blood now flooding over his beskar chest plate and pooling on the ground behind.
Growing up, Antony had always been envious of the other children, the ones with mothers who doted on them, taught and cared for them. In contrast, Antony had been tended to by a rotation of slaves and servants under the direction of his father. Hadrianus himself rarely spent time with his son, only deigning to grace him with his presence during the evening and morning meal when he wasn’t busy entertaining business contacts and political connections. Antony had coveted his father’s attention and couldn’t quite comprehend the reason for his near estrangement. But by the time he was seven, he thought he had it figured out. Hadrianus must blame him for his mother’s death during childbirth. The resentment, the guilt, had eaten at him, making him alternately defiant at times and desperate for approval at others.
And now Dum Dum sounds uncertain, even though he had achieved his desired result. “You sure? Stevie didn’t want to interrupt your studies. Your program is very competitive; cut-throat, he says.”
Stefanus knows the man doesn’t like to see his stable of well-trained retiarii shrink, but still. His former doctores could at least pretend to be happy he survived. “Nice to see you, too, Fidelis.”
Antony’s arm tightens around him, his tone a touch strained. “Stefanus, have you ever… that is before me, did you like sex?”
Steve simply stares at him from the opposite end of the couch. “…You went for the throat,” he points out, his tone incredulous.
“Yeah, about that,” Tony says, trying to smooth out his hair. “It’s been fun, but I’m trying this new thing where I don’t sleep with my assistants.”
Suddenly, Bacchus throws the net, ensnaring Stefanus under its weighted web. His weapons too tangled to be of much use, he scuttles backwards, trying to put more distance between himself and Bacchus’s trident until he can free himself. He blindly blocks Bacchus’s next strike and his next, shrinking behind the rounded shield and placing his padded leg forward to protect the other as he tries to use his sword to slice through the net. He succeeds in the effort just as Bacchus manages to hook his trident in the ruined net and sword, pulling both out of Stefanus’s hand, until all Stefanus has is his shield.
Tony swallowed hard when he heard that question. Steve might not understand if he explained. “I didn’t sleep with them in the way that you think. We didn’t. Do anything together; they were just in my bed. I hate sleeping alone.”
“I know guys with none of that worth ten you”, Steve continued, the same confident and poisonous spark in his eyes.
“For using it without just cause,” he said, “I shed blood, even though I said I wouldn’t. So if I am to be hurt without it, that is the weapon's will and it is what I deserve.”
Tony was busy, flicking through his notebook, looking at differents notes and sketches. To a different person, they hardly made any sense, but to Tony, they were everything. Scribbles, drawings, everything there was extremely valuable, and even if Steve went through it, he couldn’t really know what to believe when he saw them.
“I...I am flying”, he repeated, trying to test the functions, sending a bit more boost on the jets, getting a bit higher.
There was a certain, subtle tone of sadness in his voice, and it made Tony’s chest feel heavy, feeling sorry for him. He was thinking too much of his own well being and how the Captain’s presence would affect him, that he kept forgetting that the one with the most issues was in fact, Steve. Seventy years passed from the moment that Steve was lost in the sea, and Tony didn’t want to bring his hopes down, telling him that most likely those friends wouldn’t be alive. He nodded though, offering his help was the least he could do.
“It looks like I got nothing else to teach you, Mister Stark”, he smiled, cheeks flushed red as he pushed back that blonde mane of his.
It was hard to say no to Steve, and even harder when he would give him that softer look that he reserved for Tony alone.
“I’ll take care of those tomorrow morning, let me shut an eye tonight, okay? It’s hard to sleep around snow, you know, especially when you’re woken up every ten minutes or so”, Tony replied to her, the red head nodding to him before giving Steve another curious look, heading to the elevator and shutting the doors behind her.
Tony started to feel warmer and the way Steve was treating him, in such a gentle, delicate way, did help. He didn’t know exactly what his feelings were, or what he even meant to Steve, but they'd already moved past the boundaries people usually set between them.
Taking a last look at himself in the mirror, he opened the door. It was strange to think that this would most likely be the last time that he would look at himself from that viewpoint, that he wouldn’t need to wheel himself outside anymore.
An overwhelming feeling took over him, and he was sure that Tony was talking in the background, probably asking if he was all right, but all he could hear was a very distant voice. He walked further inside, his hands trailing the dusty coffee table and the couch, staring at the shut door of where his bedroom used to be. Taking a deep breath, he pushed the door open, making the same creaking sound it used to do back in the day, remembering how he kept forgetting to ask the landlord if he was able to fix it.
“What...? Was everything alright..?”, Steve asked, his voice rough, realising that he didn’t speak for so long.
“What the hell??”, Tony shouted, as Hulk’s growl made everyone jump. “What just happened? I hope nobody tried to kiss me”
“You committed a genocide, Anthony. You killed off an entire planet, an entire world. Thousands of innocents, millions, billions… All dead. Just because you couldn't wait, you convinced yourselves that you were the true saviours. I tried to stop you, and what did you do? You took me out. Just like you did to those innocent souls.”
He found Reed waiting in his lab, pacing around nervously. Steve wasn't good dealing with those scientist minds and he hated the way some of them would look down to him, forgetting that he was just as smart. The man had horrible black circles under his eyes, which instinctively cause Steve to rub his own eyes; he knew that it was pointless, his own black circles and slightly red eyes were too obvious.
Steve looked away, looked down and reached to play with a small tuft of grass, being sure to keep his eyes on it as his cheeks reddened. “It was just, pleasant,” he said. “I’ve never had a dream like it before.”
“Are you sure…?” Steve asked, and Tony’s eyes said it all. With a nod, he got himself comfortable, sitting on the edge of the bed, focusing on Tony again.
It felt so nice to lie down next to Steve, of all people, and Tony enjoyed Steve's company and comfort more than anyone else's in his life. It was so strange that he'd come to like him so much, how he wanted him there to feel more encouraged to follow his heart, and maybe Steve was the cause of it, maybe his presence did make him more human like in the end. “Steve?” he asked again.
He was stopped by a red gloved hand against his neck; the soldier looked way scarier and more intimidating now, just like the war movies made him out to be, as he pulled Tony closer and inspected the crew men, their faces hidden behind the masks and headgear.
“All of them, that is correct”, Tony made a mental note to save the footage at the corner of his database for future reference.
“I will not kill you, Athenian. I don’t believe in what the Fates see, I’m not letting anything happen to you" he said in the same tone.
Steve saw no harm in continuing with the loving motions, as long as he refused to admit that his heart was warming to the Spartan that was destined to kill him. And he refused to admit, too, that he saw more than a killer; he saw a man who needed to be taught and needed to have company.
“It was.. something.. but I’d rather hear you talking”, Steve said as he pushed back his hair and crossed his arms, unsure on how to act but keeping his calm nevertheless.
Steve took a deep breath. “Because of…me… you and me… I mean, my Tony, we had a huge argument. He erased my memories so I couldn't stop him and the rest of his other team from destroying an Earth to save our own. The secret was out, I got angry, I yelled, we fought, I told him that I'm over him… He took it to himself to fix this, to prove me wrong and…”, he trailed off.
Their voices were raising, this was getting nowhere, it was just another argument that none of them could win, but Tony was right in Steve’s mind, even though he would hate to admit that. Maybe in a sick twisted way, saving this Tony would make up for being responsible for every other Tony’s death. Not, it wasn't right, saving one soul while sacrificing many shouldn't be a solution, that was exactly what he preached to Tony and the Illuminati, and right now, he was becoming just like them, proving them right.
The blonde didn’t seem to particularly react, maybe he was in shock and still processing the details, but he just stared at the billionaire.
“It’s easy to make copies in our day, you know.. and I located your apartment before we planned to come here, got someone to make those keys, I doubted that you had a pair on your own or that you would want to kick your door down..”, Tony replied.
Steve let out a sigh, knowing that he had to take this decision. Suddenly the guilt from their previous argument on board filled him in. Tony was proving him wrong, right here, right now, and he couldn’t even apologise to him.
“I don’t think the places I may stay would appreciate me bringing another man to lie with,” he said, “but we could go back to Sparta, take the chariot.”
Both of them carefully walked inside, to the other side of the room and opened the window to see a large crowd under the Tower, all of them cheering and throwing their fists in the air.
“He’s not slowing down”, Thor said with concern, ready to fly up to Tony’s rescue. Before they knew it, Hulk arrived down to their level, with a rather beaten up Tony on his hands. They both ran up to him, throwing the helmet to the side, examining Tony’s state.
Tony returned the smile and ran his fingers through the blonde’s hair. “Hey, that’s what I do”, he replied with a soft chuckle.
“I appreciate that offer, I’ll keep it in mind, thank you,” Tony replied with a chuckle. “What about you? What was your training? Did you go to Socrates’ school or something?”
“Thank you very much, Herr Stark, that is the last thing that we want Herr Rogers to know”, Zola half joked, even though the bitterness was strong in his tone.
“Wait right there," he ordered as he walked towards the door. “At least get some rest and supplies before you go back. If you can’t talk about the differences in our mind-sets, you can at least vouch for Spartan hospitality.”
“I wouldn’t say that I’m bitter,” Tony said with a shake of his head. “Just don’t judge a book by its cover. I may not be the man you thought I was.”
Steve looked at him with a hopeful expression. “So you will save my people? You’ll prevent yours from invading?”
Steve probably agreed since he remained silent. He didn’t do anything to be proud of, not really, ever since he woke up. He was working on adjusting to this new century and life, but that was about it. It wasn’t even his mourning stage, at least that’s what he thought, but sitting down holding on all those memories sounded like that period of his life. He nodded and picked up one of the comics, flicking through it, and then he noticed a box in the back of the closet, a larger one that the one he was holding on to.
Tony smiled widely at the prospect of being the only one worthy to witness that beauty, and then quickly shook his head, trying to dismiss the thought. “You don’t have to worry about that, there’s nothing wrong with it.”
“For the last time, I’m not setting a trap for you,” Tony sighed. “I can see why you can’t trust me, but would you deny the knowledge that you came here intending to give us? Would you deny giving it to someone who really cares? I’m asking you as a friend, Steve. A friend who wants to know more.”
Tony let go of Steve and approached the telescope, patting it gently. “This? I made it myself, I saw some before and I sat down to make it. I can take it with me and show you tonight if you want to see what it does?”
“I trusted you once, Anthony, I really did. I thought that you changed, after the War, I thought that you would anything, anything in your power to make things right, to avoid casualties at all cost. But no, you killed off more people than that Registration Act of yours ever did. You… all of you… Murderers… We could have saved them, both them and ourselves! Look around you now, Tony! Is this the Avengers World that we were building together? Is it?!”
“That’s not even one of my code names, get it right!”, Steve said as he held his trusty shield close to his chest, calculating each and every move. As soon as they started to close in, he threw his shield, and before they could even realise what happened, the vibranium disk made a complete turn, knocking most of them out almost instantly, before returning into Steve’s hand.
This wasn't what he wanted to hear; his failures, his inability to save Tony, to hear that their argument was the reason why all this was happening was killing him, little by little.
Steve nodded; nobody he knew was as well informed about the different universes that existed as well as Reed did.
They belonged together in a way, two lost souls, lost boys who had been alone for so long and had finally found someone else to share everything with. Maybe Steve didn’t think of them as exactly that, but it was enough for Tony; he would hold on what he had and appreciate, the way he never had before.
In the centre of the room, a mannequin with his first outfit he wore as Captain America was standing, next to his first shield, battered up but still in a relatively good state. Even though he spoke so harshly to Tony when he made reference to his Captain status, he couldn’t help but walk closer, admiring his old uniform. He could see everything, threads that were sticking out, some of the marks bullets and blood left on it, the stench of war still present, at least to the person who wore that uniform for years. His hands reached for the shield, caressing it and feeling just like the first time he picked it up; it felt like it belonged to him from day one, that he was a natural with it, as he proved later on.
“I find that hard to believe”, Steve replied, crossing his arms and looking at them again. There was something eerie, almost suspicious about them but he couldn’t tell what exactly.
He decided to move, to go on another trip, to go and spread his teachings of peace and law. But who really needed him? He looked at his map and decided that Thebes should be his next adventure.
The smile on the scientists’ faces seemed fake, eerie, but the firm handshake and approval that he received from Tony looked genuine enough to him.
He pulled up slightly; placing soft kisses on Steve’s back, not saying a word just yet just to enjoy the quiet, powerful moment they shared.
Tony looked at the temple overlooking them and nodded. “I understand. You don’t have anywhere else to stay?” he asked. “Amongst friends or anything similar?”
“You don’t know a thing about me, do you understand? Don’t talk like you know me and what I really think,” Tony hissed as he stopped in front of the door. “I’m not going to let this war happen, I won’t kill you or your people just like that”
Looking at the technological equipment in the room, Steve decided to find more about it later, but for now, maybe getting under the hot water could help him relax a tiny bit, just escape his thoughts and keep himself warm. Tony didn’t pass by to give him clothes or a towel, but exploring the floor could be a good idea, since he hated to stay somewhere he wasn’t familiar with.
Steve didn’t reply, but something told him that this was quite the touchy subject. He coughed. “I don’t like this, he gave up way too easily”, he noticed, pointing at Loki with a shake of his head.
“Save your breath, Blondie. I'm not going to sit around and be your lab rat, that’s your job”, Tony said, pointing at Steve.
“I know exactly what it meant," Tony rushed to say. “But you can’t expect me to march back into Sparta and suggest change, do you? Me, the son of Ares, not talking about war? That’s blasphemy.”
“Steve… I had to, we had no choice, we could either save ourselves or have both our worlds disappearing, we couldn't-“
“Then not really, I mean, I have an inquisitive mind,” Steve said, “Especially with modern cultures and customs.”
Tony nodded and ran inside, watching the fight through the glass door, trying to think of a way to help Steve. He was right there, fighting for him, to save him and for the first time in his life, he was seeing Captain America, the true Captain America in action. It was thrilling and exciting, but at the same time he was worrying himself to death, worried about Steve’s safety.
Their casual, friendly conversation carried on until a woman walked in with a bag in her hand, and Tony looked excited to bring it over to the small table, kneeling in front of it and taking out the packages. It was such a nice distraction for Steve, spending time with Tony and learning about all kinds of new things proved to be quite therapeutic.
After all, he was trusted with many duties, and negotiating was one of them. The man in front of him seemed so devoted to his cause and, if the circumstances were different, perhaps he could have learned a couple of things from him. But still, when the Greeks were fighting amongst them, just like the Trojans did before, there was no time for empathy, and surely not for the enemy. The Peloponnesian alliance was relying on them, and there was no way he could back down now.
Steve tilted his head to the side, trying his hardest to keep his eyes open despite Tony's actions, making a soft murmur the moment he was placed down. He breathed deeply, through his heart raced, and the sound roared in his ears.
Tony found himself torn. He wanted to learn more, keep Steve there, but was lying to him worth it? No, his teaching said that it wasn’t acceptable, and he had to show Steve that he had learned from it. “Your debt is repaid, yes. I will do everything in my power to save your people," he nodded.
“Uh..Captain..Nobody leaves in Brooklyn anymore”, Tony said slowly. “The government has gone bankrupt a while back, and even though we’re doing way better now.. the pollution level in those areas are still high, so they avoided to rebuild and fix everything there.. Your house is still there, I’m sure, but I don’t know if you can actually go there anymore.. I doubt it..”
“I mean, you and Iron Man are never in the same place..kind of weird for an employee to never meet his employer, right?”, Steve pointed out, still unable to take his eyes off him.
“A hero? Like you? You’re a laboratory experiment, Rogers”. In Tony’s mind, that sounded fair. He just became who he was in the easiest way possible, at least that’s what he knew. “Everything special about you came out of a bottle”. Maybe he was being too harsh but then again maybe he wasn’t. Tony firmly believed the latter.
Those were their first words to each other, and Steve tried to approach him a bit friendlier inside the jet, while Loki being held hostage was eyeing them.
“And I’m sure that we’ll be able to revert this soon enough. You’ll be furless soon, don’t worry, even though I might feel a bit colder at night”, he joked.
“I...I think I feel the same, you know,” Tony nodded, his heart racing. “It’s different. It feels so real, when you touch me, when you talk to me. It’s all different from anything I’ve felt before, about anyone. And if you decide to let me in, I promise I’ll give you nothing but the best - fitting for a proper demigod."
“No, you’re the one going down, Stane!”, Steve shouted as he hit the ground with his shield, the trembling becoming louder as the floor started to collapse beneath Stane, and before he knew it, he was trying to grab on to anything to keep himself up, his large fingers slipping, his fall following with a loud cry.
“This is not the only reason why I came here”, Tony said, rubbing the back of his head and feeling Steve’s gaze upon him. “You didn’t really talk about it so I figured out that.. if you want to vent in a way.. feel free to do it”, he finally added, hoping that Steve would get the hint.
But then, as soon as he announced the future project of Stark Resilient that was back to is feet to rebuild Asgard, she came. The daughter of one of Steve’s mortal enemies, Sin, threatened their world yet again. They couldn’t really catch a break, especially after the Siege of Asgard, but everything seemed to have taken a different turn when Captain America was killed. Tony himself had just come back from Paris and didn’t really take the subject well, but he knew that there was one person sitting in the corner that couldn’t deal with this alone. Steve was deep in thought and Tony approached him, but knew from experience that he wouldn’t take much out of him, and their duty called. He didn’t have time to mourn the loss of his friend again; they had their world to save. Before he could say anything at all, Tony started talking with Steve and Thor, planning yet again and Tony parted ways, requesting help from Odin, but not before seeing his Captain taking the mantle again.
“Warned?”, Tony huffed. “Let me guess, is he complaining about the money he lost the other day? Can’t help it when the old man gets stumped every time he gets a card in his hands”, he chuckled lightly.
Steve stood by the door, arms over his chest, pouting at Tony with a bright red blush over his face. “I...” he stuttered. “Is that what friends do? None of my friends in the past had ever...”
When Tony tried to mention Steve’s nightmares to him one morning, he only managed to get Steve slightly annoyed as he refused everything.
“I’m more cultured than you make me out to be, Athenian," Tony said as he sat down properly, looking around the amphitheatre and the stage, waiting for the show to start. “And you can really walk in and see any play… just like that?”
“Where am I?”, the blonde asked again as he raised his eyes to meet up Tony’s. “Don’t sugar coat it and explain the details, what is going on here? Why am I not dead?”, he said in a growl.
“Oh," Tony said as he stayed in place. “So you’re saying that... I shouldn’t tag along? You know, the Sphinx is gone, no need to take her place. Just answer me this, do you want me along?”
Steve was waiting for Tony the next day bright and early; this was something that he wanted to do for a while, but didn't have the heart to do. Maybe he was scared of doing it alone, but opening up to this Tony did help him a lot. In a strange way, it felt like communicating with his Tony, and the visit that he was about to make was so important, especially after their talk the previous day.
His tunic indicated some sort of power even though his looks didn’t remind him of a normal Athenian. He seemed to in contrast with Tony’s olive skin and dark hair with his paler body and straight, blonde hair, though they both had the same, bright blue spark in their eyes.
“You know, Spartan,” Steve said, placing his hand under Tony’s chin, “I am grateful for you letting me stay here, for showing me this.”
Tony watched the way that Steve knelt down for a moment before he was doing the same, taking off his sandals. He wet his lips, unsure of what to do. Whatever he decided, he certainly didn’t want to leave.
Living on his own again hurt a lot. He didn’t trust himself alone with his thoughts, but he needed time to think about his position in the new future he found himself trapped in. That was his first mistake, he had to stop thinking that he was trapped, but try and adjust. Tony was making that process easier for him, and part of him was calling himself a true idiot for declining his offer to stay at the Tower while he made up his mind. The man seemed to have true and humble intentions, he wanted him to be there with him, but Steve turned him down, not wanting to be just another burden. Of course, if he dared to tell Tony that, he would get reassurance and tell him how wrong he was.
“Looks like it to me.. I don’t believe in Heaven, but.. this, right here and now with you? This is Heaven”, Tony said, and Steve didn’t hesitate to reply to that with another gentle kiss.
Steve smiled at the kiss, giving him a lazy smile instead, quite visibly tired. “Loved,” he was relieved to admit, reaching for Tony’s hand to hold.
Tony hissed at Steve’s words, not having any intentions of turning around and not watching his beautiful face like he had never seen him before, in such a defenceless and helpless state, even though he was trying to regain that sense of pride of his now that he knew that Tony was there.
Steve nodded against Tony’s skin, keeping their cheeks placed together. “Yes,” he said. “I am happy too.”
All alone left with his memores. All alone in an empty room with nobody else to be there for him. Alone.
Steve scratched the back of his head, confused. “I enjoy it, yes, but our deal...” he said, not knowing how to respond. “I have a promise to my mother too, but my duty to protect my home comes first. I would give myself up for my people, if that is what you wish.”
They finally had time to breathe only when they got on board Tony’s plane, glad to be leaving Buenos Aires. Truth to be told, he was worried about Whitney’s status, but Tony seemed to be more casual.
The car ride was relatively quiet, and the closer they seemed to be to Brooklyn, the more tensed Steve was getting.
“Of course, I was stuck in my ways and in my perceptions about Spartans until I met you. Of course, you are most unlike the man I had expected, and nothing like the man I said you were.”
That proud smile was so contagious, and Tony found himself returning it, pulling his boyfriend down for a praising kiss. It tasted extra sweet, tasting the melt candy, licking his lips when they finally pulled away from each other. Before he could say anything, the loud clock was heard in the distance, signaling that it was midnight - Christmas was upon them.
Tony’s chest felt heavy to be the one to deliver the news to him, but he knew that he had to be used to this, especially if he was going to act as his guide to this new age. A reminder, he had to actually make that suggestion, the other man would probably want to spend as much time as he could alone, or at least that seemed like the logical thing to do. Tony knew that he did that when his parents passed away, not because he was mourning, but because it felt like the weight of the world was on his shoulders, and it really was. Trying to rebuild the company from where his father had left it, to give the people more hope was a hard task and- no, that was it.
Steve took a couple of deep breaths and placed the key in the hole, before turning it around and opening the door slightly, before pushing it completely open.
“They perform - What? You don’t have them in Sparta? But what do you do for entertainment?” Steve asked.
Tony shook his head, unsure of how to express himself. “I don’t think it is a custom anywhere but...no, I don’t think it’s rude unless you want to? I mean, do you like me as well?”
Steve's eyes closed, his head tilting back, eyebrows twitching and furrowing in an almost confused way, feeling this sensation for the first time. His legs moved restlessly, rubbing his feet together, his shoulders tensing up straight away, which didn’t go unnoticed by Tony.
“You’re risking the ship’s safety, Stark, no offence, Dr. Banner”, Steve apologised with a nod of his head.
Steve’s pushed at the fabric of Tony’s tunic, wanting to feel more of his skin down his back. After a while, Steve pulled back from the kiss and nodded slowly, feeling a strong bond between them that he had never felt before.
“Makes it easier to know that I had a soft spot for the same person all along. Tony Stark and Iron Man..Tony Stark, the Iron Man..”
Tony could tell that he was going to get an earful later, but at that moment, Steve was all that counted. He ordered the suit to pull the gloves off, his own hands finally touching Steve’s hips, massaging and rubbing the soft flesh on his own time, unable to stop as he was finally touching him.
Rhodey looked at them both, almost like he was trying to get more of an explanation, but he got none, other than a look from Tony that said that he would explain things to him once they were alone.
“Oh trust me, it was,” Steve said, picking up his shield again with the strap he had made, tying it to back to leave the armoury with Tony. “I wish not for you to witness that.”
“No...” Steve protested quickly, “I-I want to...” He looked down at Tony and trying to smile, but his nervousness was quite obviously shining through.
“I’m doing what Mr. Stark programmed me to do, sir. He merely wanted me to entertain you while he was away”, he said, nodding slightly.
“We were assigned to do other things, and I’m sticking with that”, Steve said, looking down at him while they were standing opposite from each other.
“It’s not completely raw, don’t worry about it”, Tony laughed. “Do you like it?”, he said, taking another piece for himself with ease.
Everyone knew who he was. Steve Rogers, a good soldier, a good man. He had that unique leadership trait that rallied up the rest of the troops in his squad, he was affectionately called “Captain” by a lot. Some even joked and called him the Captain of America, but Steve dismissed that nickname, he felt that he didn’t deserve it. When the incident took place, it didn’t just shake him, it shook everyone who knew him. They all came to see him, but nobody knew exactly what to say to him. They would offer their condolences, say that it didn’t matter that he couldn’t be in the battlefield anymore, that he could get a good paying office job in the Ministry of Defence. Steve put his stoic face on and nodded to every comment, to every General that came in and offered him a job, but so far he turned everything down. He spent a few weeks in that hospital, struggling to find a purpose in life.
“Hey”, Tony said, and Steve turned to him, his palms on his legs. “It will be all right, trust me.. and if not, I’m here to help”, he said with that reassuring smile on his face. He wanted to do more, maybe hold his hand, but that was enough for now.
“I respect privacy,” Steve said, “And I would much rather not risk my life or engage in another argument.”  A strand of hair blew in his face as he raised still occupied hands, trying to brush it back using the back of his knuckles.
Stane looked at them both, shaking his head. “You’re missing out.. so much, both of you. You don’t see it now, do you? Super soldier suppliers, kings of the market! But no, your morality gets in the way. Tell me, Tony, since when have you been like that? Last time I checked you weren’t afraid to get your hands dirty and build missiles in order. In bulk. But now? Why this?”
The building stood tall, if people were walking around, he would be convinced that some residents were in fact, still inside. It looked dirty, and the old newspapers thrown around still had quite recent dates written on them.
With Master Phillips’s back to the trees, Steve parries a clone then flips over him to slice through the first before taking out the next three closest clones. There are too many and more coming, so the two Jedi draw closer together, backing up towards the jungle behind them. “Care to elaborate?”
Stefanus shifts, turning to face Antony as his hands find his chin, his wet cheeks. “Then let me take care of you,” he says as he gently kisses the corner of his mouth. “Let me take care of you, Antony.”
Purple Man cants his head. “This is about the captain, isn’t it?” A flicker of guilt, of regret, flashes across Stark’s face. Purple Man can only chuckle at how small-minded, how human this so-called ‘futurist’ had turned out to be. “Is that why you rebelled? Because you couldn’t stomach what you had done?”
Before the situation can devolve further, Stefanus gently grasps Antony’s elbow. “Antony… you have a meeting with the city planners this afternoon, and there is much to prepare. It would be a shame to keep them waiting.”
“Master Erskine has transcended this life and returned to the Force. That is my fate, as it is yours and the fate of everything living,” Master Phillips interjects. “But in the meantime, have patience.”
Dracula chuckles, the sound wheezy and crackling like dry leaves. “Always the clever little rapscallion and a brilliant problem-solver,” he says, giving Tony a pat and firm side hug. “Oh how I love you, son.”
Steve doesn’t see it that way. “There are so many people who care about you, who rely on you, and you’re not even going to try? Really?” he’s flabbergasted, borderline horrified. “For all you know, they feel the same way. You don’t have to literally die of embarrassment!”
He is about to say as much when Director Fury’s door swings open. “Ladies, if you both would stop arguing over whose hair is prettier and step into my office…”
“I knew you couldn’t stay away,” Pepper tells him as Tony loads her footlocker atop his and Steve’s bags to be taken onto the transatlantic steamship. “This is your second failed retirement, is it not?”
It had started out small. They’re in the lobby the morning after when Steve gets the distinct sensation that people are staring. They’re not the arms dealers he and Tony are after, as Steve can hear snippets of whispered conversations.
By the look on Steve’s face, he probably doesn’t have to; the man has eyes and is smart enough to put two and two together.
Stark cants his head to the side before a certain understanding seems to alight his face. “Oh that. Yeah, sorry about waking you up. Steve overestimated and… well, sometimes he doesn’t know his own limits, but he’ll be alright. His bed on the other hand… what can I say? Casualty of his own hubris.” He takes a sip of coffee, entirely too nonchalant considering what he had revealed.
It is a rarity, something that occurred in one in ten gladiators, if that, and as a result, their right-handed opponents often anticipated blows from the wrong side when matched up against someone who favored their left. It was a small but significant advantage in a profession where such miniscule differences were the difference between life and death. Ignatius wouldn’t even have to kill Stefanus outright. Should Stefanus lose his match, Hadrianus will order his death as editor, no matter how well the man fought.
And so, by the time he has dressed and stretched a bit to work out his sore muscles, he exits the ship’s sleeping quarters to find Stark, who is already situated in the common area of the ship discussing something with Rhodey in hushed tones.
Stefanus stops him outside the cosmetics stands. “You are too kind, but do not feel you have to adorn me in… all matters of finery.” Before, back when he had been lean and lithe, his clients used to paint his face white in the matter of women and prostitutes then perfume his hair to cover up the noxious smell of such beauty treatments.
In an ill-advised attempt to fit in, Tony had attended an off-campus frat party. Dressed in an MIT sweatshirt with the hood up and sporting patchy facial hair, Tony had passed as a regular freshman. It had helped that the party was dark and everyone else was already wasted.
“The mission is a bust. It’s been six days, and no one has approached us. Perhaps Fury’s intel isn’t as good as he thinks, but I’ve got only a couple years left, tops – not all of them good, mind you – and I’m not going to spend it feeling sorry for myself. It’s one of the few luxuries I can ill-afford.”
Dr. Pym sighs, steeples fingers against his temples as if to stave off a migraine, which might not be far from the truth considering the blaring sirens and flashing warning lights. “That’s detention, Mr. Rogers. I’ll see you after class.”
Steve withdraws them immediately, but Tony’s cough doesn’t abate. It grows louder and fiercer, wracking his entire frame. Steve turns him around only to be pushed off by Tony.
“I must admit I do not understand it myself. It makes me… uneasy.” The work is not difficult per se, but Stefanus can’t be complacent – he can’t afford to – and if he doesn’t understand what Antony wants, then how can he hope to be satisfactory in his role and remain in his favor?
“What? It’s only polite to ask, and if we’re sharing,” he looks past Steve at Bucky. “I call dibs on Steve as my sandwich buddy. No offense, but I don’t know where you’ve been.”
Tony agrees, and after the adults leave, the other boy shoves his hands in his pockets. “The name’s Steve.”
“Not really, no,” Bacchus looks up in consideration, “but I think I would like to travel, to go someplace far from here.”
Steve sets a tray of fried eggs, sausage, and the pancakes he just finished in front of him along with a mug of coffee. “I said I’d bring you breakfast in bed,” he tells him gently as he finishes the presentation with a miniature gravy boat of warmed syrup.
It’s a hard line for Tony, one of the few dealbreakers he’s had in all his liaisons, no matter how fucked up he got.
Steve cocks his head. “You almost sound vaguely disappointed. This isn’t the talkies, Tony. In real life, when we’re severely outnumbered and one of us is injured, we call for backup.”
Tony wakes up the morning after, bleary-eyed and aching with a stale taste in his mouth. He looks over and sees that yes, Cap is snoring along right beside him, his face disarmingly handsome and sleep-soft.
“What are you talking about? Sam is right there.” Steve hooks a thumb back to where Natasha, Clint, and the man in question lie in wait. What is Sam then? Chopped liver?
It’s worth it to see Steve blush, because this – whatever this is – is one of the best dates he’s had in a while. That’s what makes the end of it so much harder. Usually, Tony would invite a potential hook-up back to his place for a drink, to test out their chemistry and willingness to spend the night, but he can’t because (A) he doesn’t drink anymore, and (B) this is Steve. Steve may have been interested. Once. But that time has long passed. Tony can’t risk their rekindled friendship over a–
This way, when the other boys finally get their first kisses, they won’t be able to compare it to Tony’s ‘experience.’
After the burial when everyone (including Bucky) has left, Tony hangs out in Steve’s room. He tells him about his suspension, about President Wiesner’s car and securing his spot in the annals of MIT history. The timing had been coincidental, he claims.
But Antony steps between them, drawing the man’s attention if not his ire. “Why? Do you need advice on how to please a partner? Though considering your past performance, maybe you are in dire need of a lesson or three.”
Clint gives a morbid half-grin as he pairs off with Sam. “No smooching in the lumber department, you two.”
Tony shrinks in on himself. “I wanted… well, I just wanted to be a regular student. Have the normal college experience, you know. Besides, I wasn’t that bad at it. Cindy was really into me.” Five minutes longer and he’s sure he could have gotten her number.
Now that’s just lazy and most importantly, “It doesn’t fit into the Avengers universe at all!” Tony complains, utterly frustrated. He takes a deep breath, summoning the combined knowledge of eleven years of pre-K programming and after-school specials. Based on everything he’s ever seen on the topic, friendship is about compromise, and so he suggests, “Okay, how about this: He was frozen in a block of ice for like forty years, and the Avengers defrosted him and invited him to join the team. He agreed because he’s too
with men, and it just became legal in Massachusetts, so is anyone really going to be surprised you jumped on the chance to elope with some muscle-bound Brad Pitt look-alike so soon after your last failed engagement? Look, I’m no expert in what gets you going, but Captain Rogers is considered easy on the eyes. He’s exactly your type.”
“You rarely are,” Cap retorts, his brow drawn together as if he had witnessed something deeply unpleasant. “What was that about heartbeats? Two? As in you and…” he can’t even say it.
“Yeah.” Steve sits on the chair closest to his bed, his fingers interlacing with Tony’s, careful of his IV.
“Captain America,” Steve states with no hesitation, not even a hint of doubt as to the pertinence of such a name.
“It is not about desire but about necessity,” Hadrianus counters, his arms crossed. “I will put a stop to your dalliances for your own good.”
Later, when Rhodey rings up Tony about the interview, Tony can hear the near-naked glee in the man’s tone as he asks, “So… what did you think of Mr. Rogers?”
Stefanus can only returns the gesture. He then scratches the back of his neck, a touch nervous, and walks over to join Antony and the mystery woman.
Or barring that perfect scenario, then perhaps before prom, if Steve ever gathered the courage to talk to the guy. It’s not like he thought about it… much.
Stefanus’s breath is short and erratic, his heart pounding, exacerbated by a sense of heightened alertness coursing through his veins and the sun baking him inside a shell of heavy linen and scaled metal. He can feel the aching strain of his muscles, smell the musky sweat and blood of other men and beasts that had fought and died before them on these very sands.
“The golden rod is a very important find, culturally-speaking,” he insists. “On a completely-unrelated note, did you know that humanity has remained unchanged for hundreds of thousands of years. If you were to pluck a child of Ancient Egypt and raise him in today’s world, he would be virtually identical to modern man, with the same foibles and vulnerabilities, the same thought processes and… and
“and I couldn’t risk it, losing you too. But maybe if you can’t accept me as I am, maybe I never had you in my corner to begin with.”
“You need to be more careful, Tony. You could get very sick doing what you do,” Steve says softly, looking down at his hands. “Did you know that guy’s last name? Did you even use protection?” He surreptitiously peers over at the room trash can to see if he can find the spent condom without digging through the contents.
“For the sixth time,” Rhodey points out. He pinches the bridge of his nose. “Listen Tones, there are no magic words or phrases that will make every woman say yes. You just need practice.”
“Tony,” Steve says softly from the doorway. He’s still wearing his black suit, his hair neatly styled for the occasion as he crosses the room to stand near Tony as a warm presence at his elbow.
my bed chambers,” Antony takes out his coin purse, weighing it in one hand then placing it on the table, the clink of many coins unmistakable, “to ward off assassination attempts, you understand.”
“I guess, but that doesn’t mean your dick stops working. I can totally get you laid, so you can forget all about she-who-shall-not-be-named.” A good fuck usually lifted Tony’s mood, helped him gloss over all sorts of disappointments and things that could never be. Tony isn’t quite sure if it works the same with grief, but it might distract Steve for a little while.
Hypogeum: Underground area at the Colosseum comprised of interconnected corridors and tunnels where they stored set pieces, caged animals, and had gladiators await for their turn in the arena. The structure we call the Colosseum today wasn’t built until 70 AD, but even before then, there were hundreds of amphitheaters built for the same purpose, so I’m using this phrase to indicate a general underground staging area.
Stefanus has his doubts about the veracity of that claim. Antony will pay for the privilege of what? Watching him to eat and drink while he listens to a stilted conversation of half-truths?
He switches the radio back on. S-A-F-E / P-L-A-C-E, a pause, T-E-L-L / Y-O-U / T-O-M-O-R-R-O-W / H-O-P-E / O-K / N-O-W
Tony is moderately impressed with himself. Six months ago, Steve was a dinosaur, a fossil of another era. He liked vinyl records and baseball and boxing. He considered Sunday pot roast with a side of vegetables boiled to within an inch of their lives to be the height of fine dining, especially when accompanied by canned fruit cocktail topped with whipped cream for dessert, and he couldn’t for the life of him figure out how to use a computer, much less a modern telephone.
And with that, Stark crouches down to lift up the hatch. “Your carriage awaits,” he tells Steve with a flourish.
“If a Mandalorian removes their helmet in front of another living being, we are no longer permitted to wear it. No one is permitted to see our faces,” Stark recites. “This is the Way.”
Tony measures up the man at a glance. Steve didn’t stand a chance even if he had been sober. He can see it now: Steve’s body would make such a small splash in the darkened waters below, barely noticeable in the wake of the steamship. “Gentleman, I’m sure we can resolve this misunderstanding amicably–”
Steve sets off in the direction of the screams, breaking the tree line into a clearing so bright he reflexively brings up his arms and recoils at the light, but when his eyes adjust, he is horrified to see Bucky, his teeth grit, eyes closed, his neck warping and lengthening as his nose and mouth shrink and elongate into a snout that blackens into the dark beak of a swan. Five other swans surround him, clumsy in their forms, some tipped over onto the ground, their webbed feet kicking air, while others flap their wings inartfully, nearly toppling over in their haste. Maces and swords, a bow and even a small axe are strewn upon the ground, confirming the identities of these other fowl as his missing retinue.
But Antony isn’t looking at his face anymore, his gaze lowered to the four purple bruises on either side of his pale hips in the shape of fingers. They appear almost black in the low light.
Its source turns out to be a small youngling, a boy of approximately six. Short and nearly skin and bones, he doesn’t stand a chance against the larger child he is pitted against. Still, he holds his arms up in an untrained attack formation.
Steve swallows on nothing and stands up immediately. “I– I’m going to refill the canteens,” he says, before stalking off.
Steven looks at his feet. “Figures. Brock says I’m too old for a family. He says they’ll sell me for spare parts if I don’t get big enough to leave on my own.”
Real life is not a romantic comedy where Steve is his best gal and they don’t say anything to each other for years out of a mutual desire not to ruin what they have. For one thing: Steve is a boy and straight, so it’s not like there’s any sexual tension there, and secondly, Tony hates rom coms. They’re just so contrived, so unrealistic, and everything would be resolved in five minutes if the two parties could just be honest and talk to each other about what is really on their mind.
The Captain was breaking down, little by little. It didn't show, but anyone who was friends with him for years could tell. The time he spent in Dimension Z, the loss of Ian and Sharon was still terrorising him. Tony has been his backbone, his rudder. Building this new, Avengers World was what kept his sane, and to realise that all this was a lie hurt more than anything else. And right now, the one man that lied to him was dead, gone forever, because of him. Another person that lost his life because of him. He had more blood in his hands than he could ever want to imagine, and no matter how hard he scrubbed his hands clean, they would only get redder.
Tony sighed as he kept himself close to Steve, his hands lowering so he could hold him around his waist. “Yes, I’ve decided. I like you.”
“Pleasure”, Steve simply said as he firmly shook his hands and stepped inside the car, not really having the time to admire the interior and the fine leather sits they were sitting on. Tony’s voice was heard in a distance as he was left alone with his thoughts yet again, the car starting to drive through the loud city. He didn’t pay much attention, but the sights made him even sicker in the stomach; everything looked strange and different, it was nothing like the city he once lived in and knew exactly how to navigate. It felt like this was a strange new place he didn’t belong in, and every time they passed a shop, a new house, the large screens advertising all kind of things reassured him that this was true.
“Think that you can fly again and not land us in a pool if I do that midair?”, Tony asked him after that long pause,
Was that what he really wanted in life? To die with honour when there was so much more to offer to everyone? Was Steve right, was fighting a bad call? But he couldn’t just stop. He had responsibilities as the son of Ares. His father was the god of war; his people trusted him, and all he did was lead them to battle after battle. At what cost? Just to die in honour? Honour didn’t seem to matter much when you were dead, he thought to himself, and it wasn't cowardice that made him want to live; he wanted to see the world, and to offer something other than weapons to it.
Steve shook his head. “Is there any other room I may go to?” he asked, looking for another room quite frantically.
“I made you proud?” Steve asked. “How?” He rubbed his hand down Tony’s chest to his stomach, appreciating the definition of the muscles there.
Tony was enjoying the loud cries that came out of Steve’s throat, but he was hardly getting the pleasure, he needed to feel him himself, and Steve insisting on calling him Iron Man, taking the credit for the work he was doing himself. Yes, it boosted his ego at any other time. But this was Steve; he was his, nobody else’s. Steve belonged to Tony; Captain America belonged to Iron Man, that’s how he saw it. How was he even getting jealous over a suit, something that he was commanding on his own? He groaned louder when he felt Steve reaching for him, frustrated as he was, turning off the mute command by mistake. “Steve, come on...” he said between gritted teeth.
Tony nodded; of course, being unconscious for so many decades would have its toll on Steve, and since he suffered from a selective case of insomnia, he could somewhat relate.
“I’m...fine, I think?”, he mumbled, fanning himself and sitting down, doing his best to cover his chest, the reactor being a giveaway of who he really was, but Steve seemed too preoccupied to save them both from burning up to notice. Now, that wasn’t really a crime, a teammate finding out who he really was, and someone like Captain America himself would definitely keep a secret if he was asked to do so.
“Now you see, that’s where you’re wrong, Rogers, don’t you get it?”, Tony snapped. “You tried to talk me into how important is that people talk about their problems when they are into a committed relationship, lectured me so much when I was hiding things from you and right now you think you can make me forget all about that. You’re not going anywhere, you’re going to talk to me about the nightmares. We’re supposed to help each other, how am I supposed to feel good when you’re not letting me pay you back for all the good you’ve done? You’re not a soldier when it’s just us, Steve. You don’t have to do all this alone, I’ll help”. He sat down, next to Steve, looking at him in a way that would force an answer out of him.
“I think I can manage to see past where you were born, Steve," Tony said with a soft chuckle, enjoying how cheerful Steve seemed to be.
“I uh.. after my mother passed away I had to look for someone else to live.. managed to get this place.. not that I could spend a lot of time here anyway, being Cap meant that I was just spending much time in the battlefield”, he explained. “I did come back before that one mission where I..”, he trailed off.
Tony smiled at him. “Thank you,” he said with a nod. “That means a lot coming from you. I hope I’m not going to disappoint you any further.”
Tony stayed quiet too, not really knowing how to act around Steve. He was afraid that every time that he tried to make a nice gesture, he was messing it up again. “Where do you live back home?” he asked eventually, with genuine interest. “What's it like?”
Steve looked up, opening his mouth and trying to speak again. A few noises came out again, and Tony encouraged him to carry on.
The son of Zeus stepped up to Tony, giving him a passing warning glare, always one to uphold the rules. And then he was leaving with the son of Cupid alongside him, practically being dragged out by the demigod with a hammer.
Tony nodded and pulled away, getting out of the bath to covering himself with the tunic from earlier before turning around to give Steve the sense of privacy he needed.
He wasn't just facing one body, he was facing at least five of them, all resting on tables, all of them battered up and covered in dried blood. The nearest body of Tony Stark had a large bullet wound on the centre of his forehead, another one had red marks all around his neck.
“I don’t think any of you understand what this means for the company, for the world”, Stane said, his patronising tone dropping now, trying to be more menacing, but it was clear that Steve would take none of that.
Steve sat back too, watching the play. He particularly enjoyed taking in all of the masks, drawing them in his spare time, but he laughed along with the play too as he noticed Tony doing the same. In fact, Tony seemed like a completely different person when he was with him; he seemed happy, light-hearted. Steve couldn’t help but look at him from time to time, watching how he smiled and how he would stroke his beard pensively whenever anything required thought. His rare bright blue eyes sparkled in contrast to his dark hair, and that stood out even more when he smiled. It was nice to see this positive side, and Steve found himself thinking that perhaps his initial judgement hadn't been wrong.
He wasn't sure he wanted to tell Steve all of this, but Steve was a fellow demigod. He'd allowed Tony to see him like this; it only seemed fair that Tony should give him something in return.
The blonde was taking deep breaths, trying to calm himself, but it wasn’t until he saw the grave of someone from his past in this new age that it made him realise what was happening. It felt so surreal; there he was, looking like the man from the 40’s, in a new century standing by the grave of someone who held dear in his heart. There was no way of him going back to that era, of undoing what had been done, and that killed him.
“Leave him be!” Falcon yelled back, trying to be the guardian that he was meant to be, his large red wax wings, similar to those of Icarus’, shielding Steve as he ushered him out of the building quickly, Steve hiding his face in shame.
“No, not really,” Steve said. “It takes time for others to master it, though.” He took another brush and made a quick mess of shapes, trying to form a structure from his mind to render Tony from the waist up.
Steve looked up at Tony. “Together... I promise...” he said, “I’ll wait for you...” His grip was loose over Tony’s hand and still he tried gently to stroke it, to feel Tony's warmth again.
“Interesting? Why?” He asked before rolling his eyes, “Let me guess, it’s due to my reputation of being unable to age...”
“That’s what global warming does to you, huh?”, Tony huffed once they stepped inside again, only to be interrupted moments later.
Falling asleep wasn’t easy, not when they were so close to their destination and a discovery that would shake their world. Finding the Infinity Gauntlet, that one legendary artifact that wasn’t meant to exist, was all the excitement that Tony ever needed in his life. He had promised so many people that this was his last adventure, but he knew very well how hard it would be to keep such a promise.
Tony frowned. “Should I excuse myself for taking that for granted and just getting undressed?” he asked.
“He had those in his jacket”, Fury said, tossing a couple of bloody trading cards towards Steve. “I guess he never got them signed”
Tony blinked at what he thought that was a compliment. It sure felt like it, and for a reason he couldn’t explain, he held on to it a lot more than he thought he would.
