Here it comes.
for cooking,” Steve said, ushering Tony to one of the barstools. “Now sit your ass down and enjoy it.”
Tony’s fingers pause momentarily. “Do you want me to talk about something else, then?”
Steve never liked it when he drank anyway.
The gifts continue, until one afternoon where Pepper goes to Tony’s office to inform him that all of Tony’s evening plans were cancelled for a dinner reservation at Tony’s favorite restaurant: a little hole-in-the-wall trattoria in Little Italy.
"What the hell is goin’ on?” Rhodey mumbles from his bed, still half-asleep.
Steve frowned. “I never said that.  I would
“Childhood best friend?” Peggy supplies, a playful smile on her lips. “It’s nice to finally meet you, Tony.”
“Just dandy,” Tony replied.  “I appreciate you seating us together, by the way.  It made conversation over dinner very… interesting.”
"Of course, I am.
“Do you want to go to the movies with me?”
Tony swallows. “I… I think you should go, Ty.”
Tony gives him a look of deep and utter gratitude. “Thank you,” he says sincerely. “I don’t even… I can’t imagine how difficult things must have been…”
“I’m guessing this wasn’t supposed to be part of our team bonding today?” Natasha remarked. “Where the hell is the Fantastic Four?  Or that Spider kid?” she asked, jumping back just in time to avoid the Wrecker’s crowbar.  Clint took the opportunity to jump over him and kick him in the face.
They’ve talked about marriage a few times in passing over the course of the five years they’ve been together, but it’s always been
She looks thoughtful. “So you like this attention?”
“Okay, I’m ready,” Tony says a few moments later, ignoring the way his heart is still hammering in his chest.
“Yeah,” Tony admitted guiltily.  He must’ve been pretty out of it if his date that he’d only known for less than an hour could see right through him. “Feel free to call me ‘Tony,’ by the way.”
“I know,” Natasha said with a grimace. “It isn’t exactly the most comforting statement.”
Steve raised an eyebrow. “Jim did that?”
"Tony?"
Pepper ignores him, grabbing his wrist instead and pulling him through the throngs of people.
“Dinner?” Tony repeats, perplexed.  "Like a date?“
“You’re telling me,” Steve muttered. “I can barely flirt—let alone tell when anyone is flirting with
“We’re just helping her out.”
looks good. “Yeah, handsome,” he says with a grin. “You look good.”
“I do.”  Steve presses a kiss to his nose. “I love everything about you.”
Tony sighs. “I guess I’m just a little… I don’t know.  Overwhelmed?”
“Aw, don’t be like that,” Steve whines, and then brushes Tony’s hair back from his forehead in what’s supposed to be a comforting gesture. “You should smile.  I like when you smile.” He props his chin in his hand, elbow on the table, and uses his other hand to continue petting Tony’s head, fingers carding through his hair. “I like it when you’re working, though, too.  When you’re focusing.  Oh!  And when you talk with DUM-E and the other bots, even though they don’t talk back.  It’s cute.”
Tony looked away from her imploring gaze. “We aren’t together,” he informed. “He isn’t interested.”
“I promise it’ll be worth it,” Ty says before leaning in for a kiss.
“Is that why you left?” Tony found himself asking, staring hard at the curve of Steve’s bicep and unable to look up further. “Because I overestimated my abilities?” He tried to laugh, the sound shaky to his own ears. “I mean, we both know you’re way out of my league after all.  It’s a wonder we stayed together for as long as we did, really.”
It wasn’t until Steve went away that Tony realized how much he had come to depend on Steve in the few months they were together–and no, he wasn’t talking financially, but rather just… well, Steve’s presence.  Tony loved being around him; he loved getting phone calls and text messages from him; loved waking up with him and loved falling asleep in his arms every night.
“Don’t be ridiculous,” Tony said, cutting him off with a chaste kiss. “Of course I had fun.”
Tony falls silent after the remark, but Steve’s too preoccupied with his bladder to think twice about it.
Peggy schedules an interview with Vanity Fair at Steve’s six-bedroom-eight-bathroom “cabin” in Colorado.  Tony tags along because he hasn’t seen Steve in almost a week and he figures at least being in the same house with Steve is better than not seeing him at all.
“JARVIS doesn’t lie, Tony,” Steve said, sounding a little too pleased for Tony’s liking. “Anyway, I asked him if you had seen any musicals lately, and he said you haven’t been to the theatre since you were a teenager.”
“You’re cruel,” Steve mutters.
Steve smiles wryly. “I’ve been told on multiple occasions that I can be a bit stubborn.”
It only took another minute before Steve came down Tony’s throat, one hand clutching the cover beneath him and other grasping lightly at Tony’s hair.  Tony hummed around him gently as Steve rode the aftershocks of his orgasm, stroking his thumb over the jut of Steve’s hip.  He had barely gotten Steve’s cock out of his mouth before Steve pulled him up for a kiss.
A week.
"Steve?"
“You ruin all the fun.”  Okay, so maybe he still needed a lesson on extravagance, but this was Pepper’s wedding, and he just wanted her to have the absolute best.
“You aren’t like any of the people Steve has ever dated,” Bucky says. “I was convinced for the longest time that you were after something–his money, fame, whatever.  Even after the others warmed up to you, I was still convinced that you weren’t good enough for him.”
“What’s
Thor nodded and then looked at Tony expectantly.
Steve’s
“No,” Steve said almost instantaneously.  He couldn’t be mad at Tony even if he wanted to. “I just—
“I know you like it better on your back,” Tony says, better positioning himself on top of Steve.  “I know you like it when I kiss your neck like this.”
“My apologies.”
Tony looks the man in the eye. “Just go, Ty.”
“It got you, didn’t it?” Steve countered, rolling his hips again and pleased to find his lover just as aroused as he was.  His fingers slipped under the material of Tony’s shirt, sending a shiver down the man’s spine.
Tony eventually accepts (if his screams of ‘

“You’re breaking up with me,” Steve said, his voice flat despite the numbness in his chest.
“Don’t wanna,” Tony replied. “I wanna talk to you.”
“Sure, Tony.  Can’t say I was much of a help though,” Steve said in a poor attempt to lighten mood, but Tony was looking anywhere but at him.
“Yeah, well, y’know I have that huge project due.”
“I want us to
They fuck on the down cover of a $3,000 a night hotel room, and again in the backseat of the limo. She leaves him with lipstick stains on his collar and a very generous tip which leaves Steve able to pay off a good amount of his mother’s hospital bills.
They act perfectly normal in class, and in public settings in general, but every night, one of them texts the other asking him to come over, and they sleep together again.
Okay, so it seemed like Steve didn’t have the same reservations that Tony did.
Tony to have a genuinely good time—not to be bored out of his mind.  Steve had learned a lot about dating over the course of the past couple of months, but he had also learned quite a bit about Tony himself.
Tony’s jaw clenched, Steve’s words echoing in his mind as he watched as the blonde tossed the torn log onto the growing pile.
“Then wash it,” Tony snapped.
Tony rinsed off and stepped out of the shower, wrapping a towel around his waist before returning to his bedroom.  He rifled through one of his drawers for a pair of sweatpants and a tshirt.  He slipped them on and dried off his hair, before grabbing his tablet and walking down the hall to Steve’s room.
.  He feels light, like he has no care in the world.  It’s easy to lean into Tony’s space and drape an arm over Tony’s chair.
He nudged Steve’s shoulder. “I meant what I said before:
Steve looked over and realized that Tony had come over to stand next to him.  He glanced back at the photo, trying to formulate a response.
They lay there silently for a few minutes before Tony speaks again: “I miss this.”
“I… I’m sorry, Ty.”  He really is, because Ty is charming and very handsome, and Tony is very much attracted to him, but: “I just… I don’t think I’m up for anything more tonight.”
~ ~ ~
to let you go. If he ever hurts you, I will not hesitate to kill him.”
It took a surprising amount of energy for Tony not to dwell on Steve’s statement. “You’ve destroyed five motorcycles ever since we started this whole team shtick.”
“Well, someone’s gotta be there now, right?” Tony asks.  He knows very well that he
“No, it’s another genius-billionaire-playboy-philanthropist that lives here.”
Steve digs into his pocket, takes out the handful of hundreds that Tony had given him earlier, and slips them into Tony’s hand.  He leaves a lingering kiss on the corner of the man’s mouth and tells him to call if he’s ever in need of Steve’s services again.
Later that week, while restoring an old Mustang, Dummy brings him a wrench with yet another note attached to it.
“You’re right.  It really is a lot better when we don’t have to worry about waking up the others,” Steve joked when they parted, earning him a chuckle from the other man.  He blindly reached for the quilt on the ground and wiped off the mess on his hand and Tony’s stomach.  Steve laid back down once they were both decent, his chest pressed to Tony’s back.
“Why didn’t ya get her number?”
“I like them.”
“Accept,” Tony commanded.  He fell back in his chair just as Pepper’s face materialized on a hologram. “Hey, Pep.  What’s wrong?”
“Mr. Stark and Mr. Rogers?” the woman called out as she approached.  She shook both of their hands. “My name is Vanessa Marianna.  It’s a pleasure to meet you.”
Tony’s gaze snapped back to Steve’s face. “That’s not—I—”
Tony shook his head. “How you managed to smooth-talk
Tony eyed her skeptically. “Why?”
“You’re an idiot.”
Tony can still remember the night Steve showed up at his door.  He can still remember the scratch of Steve’s beard as he kissed him, and the bruises on his wrists from being held down on the bed.
It wasn’t slow. It wasn’t romantic. Not this time. It couldn’t be. Steve’s hands dug into Tony’s thigh and hip, grounding Tony like an anchor as they began to rock together into Tony’s fist. The rain made their movements slicker, easier.
Talking to Steve was easy.  Listening to Steve was easy.  Sharing space with Steve, eating meals with him, watching television with him, leading the team with him—it was all so second nature that Tony felt like he had been doing it his entire life.
True to his word, Steve doesn’t take long.  After only a couple minutes, Steve grabs Tony’s hips again and fucks into him good and hard a few more times before he’s shouting Tony’s name as his orgasm is punched out him.
’ when you avoid responsibilities and neglect to take care of yourself,” Rhodey corrected. “I didn’t come to New York so I could hang out with Thor and Sam while my best friend was holed up in his office.”
Tony whistles lowly. “Um… wow?  Surprised you came out of that alive.”
They talk and take turns sipping the cheap whiskey, and eventually they find themselves kissing. In the grand scheme of things, they barely know each other—having only met a couple of months prior because of a mutual friend.  Steve thinks it’s just fine because he likes this guy, and he’s pretty sure the feeling is mutual.
to see me?”
“C’mon, Tony.  You’ll have a—”
“So, this was… interesting,” Steve says, putting his beer down next to the rest of the empty bottles on the coffee table.
“None of that now,” Steve chided, pulling Tony into an embrace. “Stop feeling guilty.  You’re up—
“You’re ridiculous,” Tony said, shaking his head. “I can’t believe I married such a sap.”
look good?
“You might want to practice doing that without looking like a fool,” Tony said, walking past him.
“No, he’s not.”
Tony swears he feels his already weak heart stop when he hears the admission.
“Natasha and Clint have been on a mission since Thursday,” Steve informed.
into going to bed with you, I’ll never know.”
“Oh, don’t worry.  We have a very professional staff here, Mr. Rogers,” Vanessa guaranteed.
Tony never gets the time to think about it, but that’s only because he gets distracted by a letter in the mail informing him of yet
“It was child’s play,” she says, as if breaking into a highly guarded military base was a normal occurrence.
He wants to finish this argument and kick Steve out of his workshop once and for all so that he could find someone who would be more deserving of the love and devotion that Steve has to offer, but Steve’s next words only make him freeze in place.
That’s also when the portal back to his time materializes next to them.
“You couldn’t afford me,” Tony retorted, taking a seat next to Steve.
Tony sputters. “
He made a mental note to overnight a half-dozen pairs of Louboutins to her apartment later.
“We’re practically dating anyway,” Tony states.  “We’d just be labeling it.”
“You better be careful, Rogers, or people might start thinking you actually have a sense of humor.”
Tony sounded so sincere—so different from the usual sarcasm and witticisms that he normally spoke, and Steve didn’t know how to handle it.
"Incredible cliche."
turned on.
“Do either of them have names?”
“Did you keep trying again and again with the same exact parts and specifications?”
It’s awkward.  It’s fast and sloppy and not at all like the movies had said it would be.
“Well, that went about as well as I thought it would,” Tony says when they’re in Steve’s hotel room—they had wanted to go back to school, but realized it was a lost cause when they saw the dozens ofreporters waiting outside their dormitory.
“Probably also sulking.”
, he was meant to end up here.
“So, ah,” he says, frantically trying to get things back on track, “How’s that contract look?”
“Tony has to run an errand for Pepper and he needs someone to go with him,” Bruce explained.
“Do you?” Tony challenged.  Sometimes, it was still hard to believe that he and Steve were friends—that Steve had seen parts of Tony that no one ever had, and that Tony had
“Fine.”
“But you
,” Pepper cut in.
Steve hadn’t taken it personally until he found out Thor was granted access with his own code.
Sweet, but not cloying.   It tastes like honey, spiced with something that Steve can’t quite identify.
"You like it anyway."
,” Tony responds, as if that makes all the difference.  He breaks off the bottom of the cupcake and places it on top of the frosting, like a sandwich, and then proceeds to eat half of the concoction in one bite.
“I know
“Sure.”  Steve smiles at him, and Tony gets that familiar fluttery feeling in his chest again.
Steve looked up from almost demolished plate of pancakes. “Yes?” “Just between us… you
, but he isn’t blind by any means, so he can understand why someone who looks like
Of course, Steve knew that Tony was an outgoing and eccentric person, but over the past eight weeks, Steve had realized that Tony enjoyed other, simpler things too.
,” Steve added before Tony could make a smart comment.
“Because he isn’t interested in me.”
“Sure thing, fellas,” she said, her cheeks rosy red, no doubt from Tony’s comment. “I’ll be right back.”
Tony's lost in the pleasure of it all.  Steve's worshiping Tony's body like a temple; he's putting Tony's needs before his own, and that's when Tony realizes that what they’re doing
“Your track record says otherwise.” Tony started up the car. “Of the two of us, who flew a plane into the ocean?”
Tony knew that Pepper had a point, but this was
Steve grabbed a t-shirt from the pile of clean clothes on his chair and slipped it on. “What secret?” “Natasha’s right.  You’re a terrible liar.”
ask stupid questions?” Steve asks. “Lower?”
,” Tony cursed, before hightailing it out of the room.
Tony swallows, or tries to anyway—it feels like there’s a rock in his throat.
“You ask about potatoes when you’re trying to figure out what you’re doing for dinner,” Steve says, rolling his eyes. “Besides, we’ve been talking for the past ten minutes.”
…and Tony’s reminded of that magazine cover he saw at the drug store over five years ago.
lives—making you happy.  As happy as you’ve made me.”  Tony kisses his hair again. “I promise.”
It isn’t Steve’s first time in this new world.  He’s gone on plenty of dates since his defrosting (thanks to Natasha), and may have had a few intimate encounters on particularly long missions (also thanks to Natasha), so while he isn’t inexperienced per se, he still can’t help but be nervous about his first time with
The next few hours of Steve’s life is a blur: he remembers Reed counting down the seconds before sending Steve back.  He remembers finding himself in the middle of Times Square, about half a block from where the accident had happened, and then he remembers running.  He remembers diverting Tony away from the villain, remembers the confusion in Tony’s face when he looks back where he was standing in time to see the bomb detonate.

“I’d only ever ask because I wanted to, Tony; because I want

Then came the war.
For a moment, he forgets that he’s still supposed to be working as an illustrator.
already said that you’re free, right?”
JARVIS supplied.
They click from the beginning: work together, fight alongside each other flawlessly, and finish each other’s sentences.  Steve knows how to comfort Tony after particularly difficult missions that end in terrible casualties; knows what to say when he seeks him out after his tech is stolen again; knows how to make him feel better about yet another rebuild.
“Or are freaking out about kids even though you two have been married for almost
“Relax.  He already knows I’m not nice,” Tony said with a grin.  He gave Steve a casual onceover. “On the other hand, it looks like

any specifics right now, it’s obvious you’re going to be living a hell of a lot longer than I am.”

“You really
wanted to break up with you
“Sure, you’re not.”
“Do you like this music?” The question throws Tony off guard, and in an uncharacteristic move, he stumbles and steps on
Bruce feels his face heat up and scrambles back to the elevator, furiously pressing the button for his own lab.
“Nothing,” he says, but Steve still looks skeptical. "I just… I like this,” Tony adds. “Just being with you is more than enough.”
“I’m glad.”  Tony continues massaging him in silence for a few minutes before asking: “What do you think of going away?”
“Bulldozer’s down, too” Steve replied. “Someone try to get in touch with Spider-Man again.”
“I care about you,” Steve says earnestly.
“As much fun as this was, Cap, I’m kind of beat.  I doubt I’ll be able to stay up for another movie.”
Up until recently, Tony had always found friends pretty hard to come by.  He’d lucked out on his first day at MIT when he’d found Rhodey was his roommate.  He wouldn’t have met Pepper if any of his first three personal assistants had been remotely competent; and if he hadn’t gotten into that bar fight in Austin over fifteen years ago, he would never have met Happy (who was kind enough to drive him to the emergency room).
“I have fought against the Chitauri and faced an entire army of frost giants,” Thor said gravely. “I have looked Death in the eye more times than I could count, but never in my life have I ever encountered anything as terrible as this.”
“The uh, Italian supermodel…”
and perfect.
"I love you, too,” Steve says.
“No, Tony, it’s not,” Steve interjects. “It’s not okay.  This isn’t—” He scrubs his hand in his hair and mutters something unintelligible under his breath.
Based on his track record, Tony was surprised he and Pepper lasted as long as they did, and that’s what scared him the most.  Pepper was definitely not like any of the people that Tony had previously dated, and for a while, he had honestly thought they would last.
“Funny story actually,” Tony said nervously. “This is my room too.”
They were so immersed in the kiss that they failed to hear JARVIS tell them they finally arrived at the communal floor of the tower; failed to notice the elevator doors open, or Clint and Thor waiting outside the doors with devious smirks on their faces.
Tony looked at Steve curiously. “Maybe what?” “Never mind,” Steve insisted. “Forget I said anything.” “Out with it, Rogers,” Tony ordered.
Tony narrows his eyes. “He’s
“Did I do the
He hisses when he touches a particularly sensitive spot on his collarbone.
Steve smiles at that.  “If you do… you know you can tell me, right?"
“Maybe.”  Steve glanced at Tony again, but immediately looked away when he realized Tony was staring at him intently. “You really don’t think this is a little over the top?” Steve asked, changing the topic.
sleep, so you have no right to talk.”
.  I know now that nothing could have prepared me for you—for loving you so much that everything else seems insignificant.  I can’t imagine my life without you in it, so Tony Stark, will you marry me?”
“So what?”
Tony knew this was a bad idea, but he ignored the little voice in his head telling him to stop.  It had been a long time for Tony, and Steve was
Steve came awake slowly, groggy and disoriented.  It took him a few long minutes to process that he was in his own room, and that he was no longer wearing his dirty, bloodied uniform.  He tried sitting up, but fell back on the bed when he felt a sharp pain his side.
Tony swallowed thickly. “Be careful, Cap, or someone might start taking those rumors seriously.”
Tony had gotten so used to the quiet and easily flustered Steve he had been “dating” that he only ever assumed he’d be the same way in the bedroom.
“And I love you,” Tony replied before kissing him tenderly. “I love you.  I’m sorry.”
“You’re quote-unquote
“Fuck,” Tony breathed.  It had been three months, but Steve’s touch was still achingly familiar.  Steve leaned forward with a smirk, pressing a kiss to the damp skin of Tony’s hip.
“He’s awake,” Natasha says, breathless. “Sam just called me.”
“Flirting?”
“What’s wrong with the—Oh.” Natasha blinks and reads the top of the paper again. “Oh, wow. Oooookay,” she drawls, “I guess you’re allowed to freak out a bit.
“Gee, thanks,” Steve says sarcastically.
He wasn’t drunk, but he was definitely getting there.  What had scared Steve the most, however, was how
“And a few years ago, I didn’t think I’d ever love anyone like I love you.”
It turned out that on the days that Steve was home, and Tony wasn’t working, the two of them actually got along swimmingly.
“I’m tense because I’m trying really hard not to come in the next five seconds,” Steve retorted.
Sure, they didn’t get off on the right foot, and while Loki’s staff was partly to blame, Steve knew that he could’ve tried a little harder to get to know the other man first.
“Yep.”
"I can fix it.”
Clint.  It deeper, yet somehow softer, and sounded a lot like— “
Okay, so that was kind of a low blow, but Tony understood where he was coming from.  It wasn’t often that Rhodey could take leave and visit, and Tony had only seen him for a grand total of twenty minutes since he arrived. “I have a lot of work to do,” he said lamely.
Tony shrugs. “I’ve just had a lot of customers lately, y’know how it gets around this time of year… I’m behind schedule on everything.”
“I’m dating
Tony desperately wanted to continue, but he also really needed to
“Do they get along?” Tony asked, his gaze shifting from the cat to the dog, and back again.
“Cute’s an understatement,” Clint said. “They’re fucking
“How do you mean?”
One morning, Tony walks into the kitchen and finds a giant bouquet of flowers at his seat at the table.  To the delight of Steve, as well as the other Avengers, Tony actually
solely dedicated to
Natasha’s gaze suddenly becomes too much for him, so he stares at the panel next to her instead, watching the light move from one number to the next as they ascend to the top floor.  “So what if I am?”
“Our tips have increased by over 500% ever since he started coming here,” Pepper points out.
Tony watches him for a few moments before leaning forward to kiss his forehead.  He turns off the light and slips into the hallway, but not before stealing another glance at the man and murmuring an “I love you, too.”
“You slept with Steve,” Rhodey repeated. “Okay, so if you slept together, that means that he’s gotta be interested in you… right?  Or maybe not,” he added when Tony remained silent. “Wait, if he isn’t interested, then how did you sleep together in the first place?”
that no matter what happens, Steve will have his back, and Steve’s never done anything to make him doubt that.  Tony relishes every single touch, every hand on his shoulder, and every embrace.  Eventually he starts seeking out the warmth he feels when their knees touch while sitting on the couch and watching television.
“I don’t see what the big deal is, Steve.” Natasha remarks, examining the document she’s holding. “You guys are married, after all.”
“As utterly adorable as you two look,” Sarah says from the doorway, “I’m afraid we are going to be late for our reservations if we don’t head over there now.”
“I can do that.”
“What do you mean you ‘
“They slept together,” Sam supplied, making Thor spit out his drink.
Steve is vaguely aware of his lips moving, but his throat feels drier than a desert. His hands are shaking, and the lights above them feel a hundred times brighter than before.
Tony’s never done the whole meet-your-boyfriend’s-parents thing for two reasons: 1) he hasn’t even done the meet-your-best-friend’s-parents thing and 2) he’s never been in a relationship…
"Don’t you see?” Tony says desperately. “That’s exactly it: you’re my best friend, and no matter what I do, you can’t see me as anything more than that.  And I keep telling myself I’m fine with it—that I’m fine with us just being friends—but it just gets worse every day and—"
,” Steve warns, but Tony ignores him.
"I’ll be free,” Tony answers quickly. “What did you have in mind?"
Everyone at the funeral comes up to Tony to personally give him their condolences.  Distant relatives whom Tony had never even met before envelop him in hugs and kiss him on the cheek, and it’s such a foreign feeling to be so close to people that Tony doesn’t know how to react.
This guy smells like expensive cigars and cologne, and the coffee they’ve been drinking hasn’t done much to mask the taste of alcohol on his tongue.
“I was running out of new music to listen to, so I asked JARVIS for the names of your favorite albums,” Steve explained. “Did you know that you’ve listened to the
at the camera—and he sets it as his phone background.
“I bet,” Steve said, stealing a slice and devouring half of it in one bite. “You took up the entire bed.”
God, he sounded pathetic.  If Bucky were here, he’d be laughing in Steve’s face.
“Go back t’sleep,” Tony mumbles, burying his face into Steve’s neck.
“Your majesty,” Tony greets whilst bowing his head.  He doesn’t actually know the guidelines for meeting a King and Queen, but he hopes he isn’t making a huge fool of himself.
It’s the morning after Tony and Steve’s six-month anniversary when Tony finds himself in the kitchen making brunch for him and Steve.  The celebrations the night before had been nothing short of
Steve got off the bed, moving carefully so as not to wake Tony—the man barely slept enough as it was, and he was probably even more tired after last night.
“Yeah, and you’ve been trying to p-prove that to me ever since we started dating," Tony retorted, resisting the urge to fuck up into Steve's hand.  He wanted this to last.  "Did I tell you how much I enjoyed our session in the pool last night, by the way?”
When he comes to, Steve’s kissing his face and gently carding his fingers through his hair, whispering the phrase against Tony’s skin like a mantra.
“Tell me,” the other man urged, setting a slow but steady pace with his hand. “It’s just us.  There’s no one around to hear us,” he added.  He pressed a kiss to the side of Steve’s mouth.  “It’s just us,” he repeated. “Just you and me.”
“The coatroom?”
Tony squeezes his eyes shut and pinches the bridge of his nose.  He slowly counts to ten before looking at the receptionist again.  “I’m Tony

“And I don’t have time for one myself,” Steve finishes.
“You think?” Natasha said sarcastically, crossing her arms. “Tony’s going to kill you.”
“You’re like a giant octopus when
“I see that.  Thank you.”
It’s pretty ridiculous actually, because in the photo, Steve is wearing an open flannel button-down over a ratty band t-shirt, shorts, flip flops, and a backwards hat—and he looks like the guys that make fun of Tony in his classes (the ones who drive their new Audis to school and go drinking at their parents’ beach houses in the Hamptons)—so he reminds Tony of the guys he
Prompt: Tony has a colourful sexual past. No emotions involved. Steve knows this, so he doesn't take Tony's flirting with him seriously. He laughs when Tony gives him gifts or asks him to dinner; thinking this is just Tony being Tony. But what he doesn't realize is that Tony genuinely has feelings for him and is attempting to court him. Every time Steve laughs, shakes his head and shakes his head and walks away from Tony it's like a dagger to his heart.
food.”
“What are you doing here?” Natasha asks instead. “They told me you were causing a scene.”
, honey bear.”
Steve stole a glance at the bot as it tried to put all of the fallen items back on the table.
. “You’re just trying to look out for him.”
It felt like hours later before they parted, their lips swollen and cheeks flushed, but Steve knew logically that it had only been a couple minutes. He was already breathing hard, which wasn’t necessarily a surprise.  It didn’t matter how long he and Tony had been together because Tony always had that effect on him, and Steve knew, deep down, that he always would.
“Like you?”
They don’t say anything as Steve fixes their coffee—the only sound in the room being the occasional
So the first time they sleep together, Tony doesn’t even hesitate to bottom.  In fact, he’s the one that rolls them over on the bed, spreads his knees and positions Steve in between them, silently pleading to just take him already.  But Steve is slow and tender; so painstakingly attentive and unlike any other person Tony’s gone to bed with.  When Steve finally enters him, Tony feels like he’s coming out of his own skin. Steve kisses him gently, hands touching every inch of skin on Tony’s body.  It isn’t rushed in the slightest, but Tony’s never felt more worn out than he is now from Steve’s languid movements.
“Hey, you okay?”
“Tomorrow,” Tony informed. “We’re going to
Clint is amazed that Steve hasn’t already noticed his presence in the entryway; after all, it isn’t very easy to distract a man with heightened senses.
“I can do that,” he replies, before capturing Tony’s lips in a kiss.
“Where is everyone anyway?” Tony asked. “I know Bruce is away visiting Betty, but I haven’t seen anyone all weekend.”
The calls come in regularly after that.  Steve’s lucky he’s in such high demand that he can afford to be more selective, and Hill doesn’t care so long as she gets her fair share of the profits.
“Why does that come as a surprise to you?” she asks.
“Night, Steve.”
“It’s just… I never expected our life to be like this… I mean, you’ve always been in my plans–ever since I met you, I knew I’d do whatever it took to keep you for the rest of my life–but I know this isn’t… This can’t be what you expected.”
The next morning, as Steve sets a stack of pancakes on the table, he kisses Tony square on the mouth in front of their friends and teammates because Steve is
Tony woke up a good ten hours later in his and Steve’s bed, with the first rays of sunlight just starting to peak over the city skyline.  He spotted Steve leaning against the railing on the balcony, wearing nothing but a t-shirt and a pair of threadbare pajama pants.  Tony put on a sweatshirt and grabbed a blanket before stepping out into the chilly November air.
Steve rolls his eyes.  “Have you tried fighting off aliens with only one arm?”
“Yeah?”
Huh.  Interesting.
“Thanks for coming along, by the way.”
“Which one?”
“What’s wrong with your room?”
“And you think breaking up with me
“Maybe I think you’re worth it,” Tony said sincerely. “You’re my friend, and I want you to be happy.”
“So… not too much?” Tony asked when they pulled away.
“I’ve heard Primarina’s singing before, they’re very beautiful to hear.” Bruce comments smiling at the ball of blue happiness.
“Tony, you got on everyone’s uh, case when we each moved in.” Bruce fielded, looking a little shy about bringing it up. Tony would cross his arms if it wasn’t for the fact there was a Seal patting his face in them already.
“It’s more fun this way.” She replies as Noch, her Umbreon appears out of the ball, looking every bit as graceful and dangerous as her owner. “Mean look.” Nock lifts her chin then looks down her black nose at the Klefki and slowly grins, the Pokemon shudders then looked helplessly at his own trainer. Tony smirked, he knew that Noch was the Pokemon was Natasha’s best Pokemon, the rest of her team helped her do her job, but Noch was with her from the start and was quick to strike. Steve frowns at the Mean Look’s blocking Voluer’s chances of being returned, the tiny Pokemon didn’t have much left in him and Natasha knew that, better to officially remove a competitor than have them come back at the wrong time. It was a good strategy.
And then.
to all the Avengers Teams.
“No wonder they had you kissing babies, you’re strangely adorable doing it.” Tony comments which caused Steve to give a bashful smile, which looked even more appealing than being cute with a small Pokemon. Tony knew this feeling and chose to ignore it. For… Now anyway.
“Noch’s already taken Dazzling Gleam.” Bruce nods, agreeing because obviously he was there and saw it. “Dark types are weak to Fairy and fighting.” Bruce blinks at the statement.
“Don’t quit your day job. I’m Ready.”
When the pair regain themselves Tony and Pepper approaches Steve, Pepper, holding a small dark would gloss box.
“Genetically matching the guy who helped him buff up doesn’t mean I know anything.” His response causes Natasha to give him a sly smirk.
To say Steve was bewildered when he woke up it was one hell of an understatement. He woke up in a bland room in Unova, the radio playing in the background, that was the first thing that confused him, the baseball game that was playing he had been to that game, before the war. The second thing that had him confused was only made more obvious when a young woman in kitten heels walked into the room. He sat up then looked around the room then at her.
“Really?” Tony sounded unimpressed. “Not now, Magnet Shield!” You sighed and started to spark again slowly lifting off the ground and hanging there, safe from ground attacks which had been part of Steve’s plan.
Tony watched as Steve and his Audino, Sister, rebonded clinging tight to each other, he focuses on Coulson as the tears of joy and relief start to form at the corner of Steve’s eye, Tony opting to give him at least that much privacy. Coulson nods to both him and Pepper.
“I’ll do it.” is all he says before standing up and leaving for his workshop. He can feel the others watching him as Pepper follows behind him on silent feet to the lift that takes them both to the expansive workshop and laboratory that sat in right in the centre of gravity for the building, to account for explosions, and Hulk-outs while still keeping the building standing. Unsurprisingly, Bruce was already in there, both his Pokemon and several of Tony’s watching him with great interest as he mixed some chemicals. “You know, they’ll all go back in their balls if you order it, right?”
“The extra eyes are helpful. Someone might see something I don’t. Besides, they’re helpful.”
“Good to know you aren’t going easy on me.” As she looks at Tony smirking more, rolling his eyes Tony doesn’t say anything, he knows she’s figured out why she is proving less of a challenge to Steve than Tony was, that much is obvious, he knows it’s just to tease him.
“Not by himself, but if I can’t retrieve data from what he can do it means I have to upgrade something.”
“Slappy.” Steve said solemnly as Sister stroked his cheek and spoke reassurances humans couldn’t understand. “But the others are safe?”
“How long have you had, Nach?”
“Laur- Oh, Lola. How can’t you remember that.”
“Well, it was either get your own apartment and pull shift work by staying in the tower half the day like a firefighter. Or moving in and always being on call like most good doctors.” It was a big tower anyway so it’s not like Tony was worried about how much space there would be for everyone.
“Out. Where? The training fields? I thought I passed all the testing.” He asks as he follows behind the agent.
“He does as he’s told and that’s all that’s asked of him.” He says a little roughly, feeling a little protective as his Pokemon are all he has.
“This isn’t at all creepy.” He looks at Pepper for a translation and she quietly rubs the back of her head and looks at the floor somewhere off to the right. He sighs, getting the meaning they see Howard in him. “Tony Stark, C.E.O of Stark Industries and son of Howard Stark.” He explains looking at all of them in turn, this history books and Howards had mentioned all of them, except one, a Shieldon who had been trying to take on Happy along with a Klefki that Tony was pretty sure that its name was Voluer. There was a curious moment as to how close to Steve’s demise had the little dinosaur Pokemon had been apart of his team. But then he looked to the others, a female Unfesant was with the Symbol of Captian Unova Justice in trying to stop Dum-E from doing anything to them. The large eagle upon realising it was safe became aloof and lost interest in the other Pokemon and simply took in the room.
“I don’t know about that. It looks like I’m a little rusty.”
“Match start!” Bruce declares and again both Natasha and Steve throw their first balls at the same time.
As the pair continue to watch, Jammira, the Vulpix Tony adopted after Yinsen’s passing rubbed against his leg before reaching up to his knees, which has the desired effect  oof Tony absently picking the cuddly Pokemon up to snuggle into his chest before joining in the watching.
“Test them later, after he’s used to this decade.” Natasha says as her Pokemon finish healing. Tony sulks at her but she is long immune to it. “We should get lunch. Give him some space. I’m thinking the Johto Resturant on 8
“Rogers’ Klefki is unable to battle.” Bruce announces “This is getting really exciting, don’t you think?” He asks as an aside to Tony as Steve recalls the Klefki, then seemed to contemplate bringing Sister back out or the third Pokemon he had chosen.
“You have, beyond flying colours I might add. Commander Fury wants you to meet a selection of new individuals. With hopes of you becoming their leader to deal with any troubles that a team with your skill sets could best overcome.” He hands steve a file as they walk, and steve looks through it.  An ex-soviet spy turned S.H.I.E.L.D agent, the agent who flipped her, a scientist with an interesting way of expressing his displeasure and an amazingly talented engineer with the last name Stark. The name obviously stuck with Steve, Howard was listed as having a son but Steve hadn’t gotten around to looking up the names of the children of those from his past just yet. The photo wasn’t any help it was just of a dark haired man with a goatee and large purple framed glasses.
After the small reunion, Tony shows Steve around the tower, the bedroom floor, the gym floor, the communal areas and only makes reference to the workshop not taking him there due to Bruce working on things that are time sensitive and shouldn’t be interfered with.
“Double team.” Natasha says quietly, and in seconds there are now a total of twelve Frostlass on the field all drifting around Sister, who looks like she finds the whole scene unnerving.
So very far removed from Steve right now.
“It was only for a few years a long time ago.” Tony said dismissively, despite being a solid challenge to trainers looking for badges, Tony hardly took the role seriously.
“Dazzling Gleam.” Once again the prismatic light began to swirl around Voleur and the room as he shoots towards the Umbreon she jumps up slightly taking the hit but on her own terms, she lands on her paws and slides back looking unaffected, she had certainly taken damage she was obviously very good at hiding it.
“They were wrong.” Steve says. “Let’s go.” He says to Justice who watches him start to leave, then ruffles his feathers before hopping off the bar and going into a slow glide behind his trainer. Leaving Bruce, Tony, and Natasha on the Pokemon floor.
“Good to know that you can be civil when you want to be.” Tony doesn’t look at him for the comment.
As he and Captain grew, Tony had shown he was quite adept at training Pokemon and had easily beaten every gym leader and the elite four before he had a chance to reach eleven. Though he didn’t bother hanging around long to be the country's champion, instead he studied instead, Pokemon battles might have been easy for him, but engineering was always what got his curiosity fired up. When he turned 15 he learnt all he could and earned a degree in both engineering and robotics which all got put on the backburner when the Gym Leader for Castelia city retired, his past history as the youngest challenger got him an invitation to be the next Castelia gym leader and for two years he was the leader of a steel based gym. Captain always present but not part of the challenge line up.
“Oh! A Rufflet…. How. Very Howard.” Maria said, if Tony hadn’t been so distracted he would have caught the tone she used which usually got used when she figured out someone’s plan.
Steve isn’t entirely sure what to do with this information, other than store it for later and see if it works. After all, he worked with some difficult people during the war, including Howard. Tony Stark shouldn’t be too different.
“The first person to have all three Pokemon unable to battle will end the match. Trainer Rogers, are you ready?”
“And is also where Natasha is right now.” The Gardevoir was a much stronger psychic type compared to Pascal, but she never seemed to be interested in using her abilities outside of Natasha’s requests. “Actually where is she?”
“Not as happy family as we were lead to believe, huh?” Tony asks also looking at Justice, who keeps trying to groom the toxic matter out of his feathers but finds the goo to be far too distasteful but clearly has no plans to ask for help. Steve frowns at Tony’s words.
“Until he feels safe around us at least.” She adds.
Tony takes the moment to change subjects.
“Dum-E’s helpful?” Both men look at the Metagross who raises his forearms and flexed his little silver claws which he has used to prove time and again he’s useless as grabbing anything let alone something delicate and the room goes silent for a beat.
“Give me a Zing Zap.” Tony said simply as You waggled his tail sparking viciously as he summoned a flood of electrical charge into the bird who let go of him instantly falling along with the electric steel type.
“Sister, use psychic to cover her in the snow.”
“So. This is some big news.” Natasha announces as she comes in, looking at Happy but not even looking surprised before she walks up to Tony and cuddles Jammira’s face as the little fox coos at the affection.
“Natasha’s a spy, not really a long shot to think she could have ghost and dark types.” Tony answers, with normal type Pokemon completely resistant to ghost moves Tony has a feeling it cuts out half of her move pool while also limiting any shots strategies that would take out Sisters health over time. Meaning the Frostlass could have one hell of a time against the unassuming Audino, which are a regular sight in Unova Pokemon centres as they help the nursing staff heal Pokemon.
“Nice save.” Is all Tony says as he picks up an empty Pokeball off a shelf. “Happy, need you.” The Empoleon takes careful steps out of the Banner watching group and waddles over to Tony, puffing up his chest before settling himself, his own little penguin way of letting Tony know he’s ready and waiting. Tony puts the Pokeball down on a table in an unused area then points at it. “Think you can freeze this solid? I’m talking about extended Arctic period kind of solid.” The steel penguin blinks at the request then wobbles his head back and forth slowly as it contemplates it before nodding and subjecting the ball to ice beam.
“Who?” Is all Steve can get out.
“And some beautiful tourist islands at that. It’s one of the few places I’ve never had to go on mission to.” Clint answers Steve first. “Nat’s picking up a Pokemon. Got a call last night saying the egg would hatch any day now and she wanted to be there for it.”
“Stark.” He repeats “Howard’s son?”
Both he and Coulson were quiet on the way up to the elevator, and he certainly didn’t expect to hear what he did as he stepped out of the elevator.
She blinks but just stares at him. “Not making sense?” She shakes her head. “I’ve spent this whole time trying to open Pokeballs of different ages, thinking that it’s the ball I had to fix.” Pepper continues to stare causing Tony gives up on her. “Happy! Freeze three balls.” Then he turns back to the Lucario. “I need a Heal ball, a luxury ball, and a great ball… And coffee, what’s the time?” Pepper points to the time on the tv screen indicating that it’s past lunch. “And lunch?” he looks at her imploringly and she sighs as she gets up to follow his orders.
“Need any more help?” Clicker holds out her little hands at the question chittering excitedly. And obviously good question, the three of them walk to the S.H.E.I.L.D staff car and peered in. Clicker jumped in wasting no time in picking up a backpack too large for her to easily carry but she was more determined than she was defeated and stumbled her way to the tower with the bag as Clint picks up both unopened pillows with a shrug of his own and Steve picks up a bag with clothes in it as Tony closes the trunk door.
He became a hero in his own right, having high points and low points just like characters in the comics he had read as a child.
“Who said I was going to?”
After three weeks of working with Pokeballs that Happy froze he still wasn’t able to open them without corrupting the test data inside. Tony let out a frustrated noise as the screen flashes a notification about data corruption and rubbed at his face, Happy makes a baleful apologetic noise.
“Well, everything I have left is important.” Steve starts as Pepper strides past with a military duffle then can be heard ordering Dum-E around inside. As strong and powerful as Dum-E was, he was a hopeless creature unless someone gave him a direct order. If simply asked he would just waft about doing things in his own time. Which Tony didn’t mind for the most part, but it was funny to see how it would grate Pepper’s nerves. “I’m sure there’s nothing in there he can break at least. Thanks. For letting me stay.”
“We have a project for you.” Maria Hill announces as she drops a manila folder in front of him, Tony looks at it with a strong disinterest and drinks from his coffee instead. He might have agreed to work with S.H.I.E.L.D with their little Avengers initiative project, he even elected to let those chosen for the initiative to live in his business tower. It didn’t mean that he was going to jump at anything they tried to make him do outside of saving the city or the world.
“I forfeit!” Steve announces with a hand up in the air. “Voleur has nothing to wake him up.” Tony wasn’t going to begrudge him that, had Steve’s Shieldon been the same level as Butterfingers, then he would have been at a disadvantage, he only had brute strength left while Butterfingers was strong his attacks weren’t accurate so he was Tony’s wildcard.
“But there’s no type disadvantage here?”
“If you insist. See you on Friday for training.” Lola and Coulson both nod and walk to the elevator together.
Tony shrugged as he watched Happy and Pascal pull out some flat pack boxes. While Tony had been fine with paying for Steve’s furniture as part of the moving in deal, after learning of IKEA, Steve had insisted on getting everything he wanted from there he had a feeling it would help him settle down quicker if he had more of a direct involvement with what was bought for him. Tony wasn’t going to argue.
“I don’t ignore my Pokemon.” His sentence is punctuated by a very obvious throat clearing from Pepper. “On purpose.” She gives a disdainful sniff, crossing her arms pointedly in the corner of his eye.
Pascal’s psychic ability made short work of the awkward to handle flat packs as Happy and Butterfingers, Tony’s Bisharp both carried a box each also containing things from IKEA.
“Wasn’t Laurel, bringing things in too?” Tony asked, realising he hadn’t seen the Lopunny in Steve’s room.
Several of those from the 107th who fought at Steve’s side, The Howling Commandos, had passed away long ago and the few that remained were old men, either in care homes or living out their days with their families. That had been at least something to lighten Steve’s heart, everyone had had families, raised children, dogs, cats, all finding jobs in some form or another after the war not being lost to the front even when at home having no one to relate to.
Steve had sent out Voleur.
“Where is she?” He asked calmly, after all, if everything was fine and normal then she should be here fussing over him.
It was also fun to watch Maria’s jaw tighten every time he didn’t follow her orders, she couldn’t be more a part of the system if she tried, and Tony imagined that she had in fact tried.
“Blizzard.” As if the Frostlass knew it would be Natasha’s next command the Pokemon was already building up the snow before her trainer finished speaking.Snow whipped through the air in the blizzard, blanketing the arena ground, getting thicker and thicker until it was up to Sister’s waist causing her to shiver.
“But brown means he’s special.” His mother says, running well-manicured fingers through her worrying boy's hair. “He’s just like you.”
“We are going to have a three on three single battle standard rules.” Bruce once again announces from the judging platform, now with Tony sitting next to him.
“Hey, testing boundaries is healthy, you know where to stand.” He says as his defence.
“Dino?” She clearly asks, causing the other four Pokemon to stop and turn to look at Tony.
“I’m not going to do anything with him. Like always.”
“Romanov’s Frostlass is unable to battle.” A red X goes over the Pokemon's icon. Natasha doesn’t seem to be concerned. She simply throws out her next ball, which reveals Tsvetok, her Gardevoir. The Pokemon moves gracefully, curtsying to her opponent, Sister curtsies back looking like she thought it would be rude not to. Not that she gets to do anything against Tsvetok as Steve returns her right away and brings out Voleur, his Klefki.
“Rogers’ Braviary is unable to battle.” Bruce announced when Justice hit the ground with a solid thud, being steel, the Togedemaru didn’t bounce when he hit the ground but clearly having done this move before he rolled with the force almost bumping into Tony’s foot before running out of speed. Steve really only had one Pokemon left to work with, he didn’t have an awakening or berries so he had no way to make sure Voleur would wake up and be good to battle.While sister was his strongest Pokemon, he didn’t want to use her unless he really had to because she didn’t at all enjoy fighting. But remembering what he saw when he moved in, he took a chance with this throw.
“Ex-Gym Leader Stark, Are you ready?”
Tony can hear Clint talking but isn’t taking any of it in. The frozen Pokeball is weird in, and there is a heal ball waiting to receive the data. He hits ‘Begin’ then stands back and looks at the screen, he can feel everyone looking too.
“Guessing bringing up his past is off-limits.” Bruce says after he hears the Elevator moving, Natasha nods and puts Noch in her ball before heading to the Pokemon revival station.
“You know, you’re too into this.” Tony says quietly to Bruce who simply shushes at him eager to see who are the first picks for this battle. Tony rests an elbow on the table to cradle his face with a deliberately lazy interest. As Sister, Steve’s Audino and Natasha’s Frostlass, Snezhinka who gives Sister an aloof look.
“Smack down.” Steve declared which had the Shieldon to jump up and slam You into the ground, causing his Iron Barbs to stick into both White Shield and the ground, Tony called for him to use Thunder and while it did hit White Sheild and hard he was able to shrug it off. Tony had You return to the ball, sending out Butterfingers, The Bisharp looked a little bemused at the situation but ready.
“Nice to meet you, little guy.”
“We actually came up here for a reason.” Steve started as Feya and Jammira got off their respective laps to play with Star and You. “I was doing some reading and I read that you used to be a gym leader.” He finished focusing on Tony.
“Tsvetok’s psychic.” Clint points out as if Tony had forgotten.
“So try to keep the explosions and roughhousing to a minimum while he gets used to living here. Even I know better than to ask for more than that.”Coulson just gives them both a mild look, Tony feels a little like he didn’t in boarding school.
“Popplio, His name is Feya.” Natasha supplies. Steve smiles at Feya and crouches down putting his hand out to the Popplio who gives him a low flipper.
“Isn’t that nothing but tourist Islands?” Steve asks, Tony could only imagine what he’s heard about Alola without ever having been there.
His mother sounded pleased when it broke free from its egg, Tony made a dismayed sound.
Tony would never know if Howard gave him the Rufflet egg because of his obvious adoration for Captain Unova, who himself in the old films and posters had a Braviary called Justice, or to use the symbol of Unova and freedom, both bird and man, to encourage Tony to be as fantastic and good as the Captain. It was among many things Tony never got to ask him.
“This is unexpected.” is all she says which prompts Tony to snatch the papers from Clint and read them for himself as Maria answers them.
Tony knows it’s a good move, while both Pokemon share the fairy type, Klefki is also a steel which can deal out strong attacks to fairy types. Natasha knows she has to react fast and calls out her attack, Steve also doing so at the same time.
“But I’m not 10.”
“You can say that.” Tony says watching the lethal and seemingly emotionless assassin dote on his Pokemon if he hadn’t already lived with her for 6 months and seen her regularly in the company of Jammira cuddling her regularly.
“Well, I don’t exactly plan to let him in the workshop when explosions happen.”
“Other than keep his name a secret.” Tony gives Clint a scowl that both of them know is more flash than anything else.
“I have the decency to at least wait until 5, you know.” Before opening the folder Bruce looks at his watch. He sniffs at the mid-morning time and then opens the folder and reads.
“Where are they?” he asks.
“We are going to have a three on three single battle standard rules.” Bruce announces from the judging platform on the Pokemon level. While it was a good place for the Pokemon to relax and socialise away from their trainers the place was still easily big enough to contain a gym sized battle arena with bleachers for at least twenty people to watch. “The first person to have all three Pokemon unable to battle will end the match. Trainer Rogers, are you ready?”
“Star knows sing, she makes sure I sleep. Besides I don’t ignore my Pokemon when they push the issue.” Bruce answers in a low voice, while normally Bruce has a clear easily heard voice, when concentrating on other things, specifically reading, he speaks low not giving his clarity the attention it needs while he absorbs the information.
“Thunder.” Sister charges up and summons an incredible bolt of lightning into the snow mound, due to the arena lights combined with the snow being moved about so much in order to trap the Frostlass has caused enough of the snow to melt to make everything far more conductive. The snow didn’t move at all until Natasha called Snezhinka back into her ball, clearly fainted. The snow caves in now the body inside is gone.
The history of the last seventy odd years, while objectively equally as fascinating with how fast technology exploded onto the scene and became so advanced in the blink of an eye. Emotionally it was very soul crushing.
“Daddy thinks you’re ready for the responsibility of looking after your first Pokemon, honey.” His mother, Maria, said warmly to her son, watching him fondly as his fingers only just touch as his arms curl around the widest part of the egg so he doesn’t drop it as he carries it around.
White Star had been found by Dugan and given to Steve, because he was a Shieldon so his head was a shield, Steve threw shields. It was obvious to say that being as drunk as Dum Dum Dugan had been when he offered up the Pokemon so he found the whole thing hilarious. As such White Star wasn’t the strongest on the team just yet he was a baby when he was found and knew only two moves.
“That’s a Popplio.” Tony said as he looked at the excitable little water type clapped who at him for being correct.
“Giga Impact!” Despite his size, Voleur was strong enough and the beam that shot out from his little key crest on his head hit Happy hard enough to knock him back several feet. As the light faded it was obvious that the Klefki was out like a light, Happy regained his composure and rolled his shoulders.
“There are worse names you could have given that Bravairy.” Coulson answers, obviously figuring out who they were talking about easily enough.
“But Justice is a flyi- Superpower.” Tony just nods at the realisation, the move that took out his Empoleon was going to take out Natasha’s last Pokemon too.Natasha seemed to come to the same conclusion as she frowned at the choice. Steve really was a strong strategist.
“Because he never says her name around me, she just knows what he wants to be done and does it.” Tony replies, finding it a little too creepy.
With Steve’s Pokemon all healed up, it was time to take on Natasha’s team.
“Ready.” Steve answers Bruce’s question looking more focused than he was with Tony.
“Thank you, Mr Stark.” He isn’t surprised that Steve knew who he was there were photos and files and news reports about him after all, he was a little curious as to why he didn’t look at him like Sister had like he was Howard. He dismisses the thought soon enough, after all, Sister probably has far more of Roger’s attention that Tony’s face does.
“And they say you see everything.”
Also,
“Sky drop.” The words barely leave Steve’s mouth as the bird drops down and grips roughly onto the other Pokemon hoisting her up into the air before he plummets towards the ground slamming her into the dirt before changing his own angle at the last moment and swoops past and around Steve. Noch gets up wobbling faintly
“It’s. Brown.” Tony says exactly what’s on his mind as the happy little brown Rufflet chirupped at everyone and snuggled into Tony. Tony can only see the brown colour as his failing somewhere, he knew Rufflet were meant to be a blue colour but he was sure he had done everything right. His lip started to shake.
“Ye of little faith.”
“Your Poliwrath.”
“Stark’s Empoleon is unable to battle.” Bruce announces, a red X going over Happy’s icon on the screen behind Tony. Tony didn’t like the idea of having the first Pokemon of the match unable to battle, but at the same time he wasn’t surprised, Justice was a bird of war and wasn’t one to mess around. Not wanting to let the Bravairy dominate the battle he sent out his next Pokemon.
Bruce and Steve come in after a while with Bruce’s Clefairy Star who had You on her head, they both ran to Feya when they saw him to say hello.
Three days later Natasha returned to the tower. Tony was in the common area on a couch reading from his tablet, Jammira dozing his in lap as he strokes her head, they only look up when they hear a lyrical sounding bark. While Noch, her Umbreon, was by Natasha’s side more faithful to her than her own actual shadow, in her arm’s was the Pokemon she had obviously gone to pick up.
“Snezhinka, Avoid the snow!” Natasha calls back, a little unsure of what Steve was planning as the next move. However as fast as the Frostlass was, the Audino’s persistence seemed key and she managed to trap the Ghost and Ice Pokemon in the snow.
“Keep your focus, Sister. Disarming Voice!” Watching the Pokemon that surround her, Sister nods and inhales deeply crying out loudly as she turns, the shadow Frostlass disappear as Snezhinkahugs herself sadly at the sound. From the look of it even Feya in Natasha’s arms looks unhappy about the call.
“You really think it’s going to be an issue?” Natasha asks.
“Are you sure that Happy will be able to replicate the conditions?”
“Good match.” Tony says when they meet in the middle of the arena to shake hands as Bruce declares ‘Ex-Gym Leader Stark’ the winner. “Really, if this was a full team match I might have been in trouble.”
“You mean other than being smarter than everyone else?” He grins at his mother, who just shakes her head at him.
Tony almost looks disbelievingly at her, before picking up his Rufflet and heads to his computer with him, typing in shiny Braviary and the first image is a nature photograph of one such shiny Pokemon.
“There was a lot of damage done to the balls.” Tony starts with a business like tone. “And I almost managed to get everyone back.” Pepper opens the box to reveal five luxury balls. And one cracked Pokeball. Steve stared at the box, Sister just kept her face against his chest, she already knew and didn’t want to think about it.
“Moonlight. Then Toxic.” With a roll of her shoulders, the Umbreon took on a faint pink glow as she healed half of her health, then she ran towards Voluer before spitting the toxic purple goo all over him, he immediately drooped to the ground shuttering, Steve clenches his teeth muttering to the Pokemon that he could do it. He called out an attack but the little keyring Pokemon only looked at him balefully, clearly doubting the strength it had to continue. “Noch, Shadow Ball.” The Pokemon summoned the dark sphere in front of its face then it shot towards the Klefki, knocking it to the ground where it didn’t move.
“You know, I never noticed how creepy it was with how in-sync they are until you pointed it out.” Clint remarked after the doors had closed.
“What’s today’s plans?” Steve asks, not wanting to acknowledge that he had clearly been so spaced out he never heard Coulson knock before coming in to get his attention.
Bruce finishes reading then looks up at Happy, who is still using his ice beam on the Pokeball while slowly moving around the table to get an even freezing.
street.”
“He’s good moral support.”
If Tony was going to come at his flying type with an electric, he’d challenge the electric with rock.
“You’re lying.” He stands slowly, which causes her to take her own step back, the room must have been watched as the next second the doorway had armed men pour in, weapons trained on him. Steve ruled out the door as a point of exit, so he went through the wall, and ended up going much farther than he intended as the wall he went through was nothing more than painted plywood and struts. He just continued through the building, knocking down guards or taking sudden turns all the while heading down every chance he could get, he only stopped running when he got outside and saw everything around him, he knew that fountain it looked just like the one in Castelia Park before he became a part of project rebirth. But none of the buildings around it was remotely familiar, tall and nothing but steel and glass sterility.
“Why a Popplio?”
“War does make it hard to challenge gyms after all. At least that’s what I hear.” Which was true on a few levels, not only was being on the front lines incredibly inconvenient when it came to going to your region's gyms, more often than not Gym Leaders themselves would enlist and would have to either close their gyms or put one of their juniors in their place. “Better heal up. Because I was just playing around.” They look at Natasha who was sitting at the judge’s desk with Bruce, her Pokeballs in front of her, while Feya was nestled in her arms. She had some intelligence on Steve’s Pokemon so now it was time for her to plan.
“If I can’t get his Pokeballs working you can kiss that integration goodbye.”
“Happy, Yawn.” Tony announced who obeyed easily enough, the large bird put his flipper to his mouth and gave a large yawn that Voleur couldn’t help but yawn back. Steve frowned, Tony was known as an offensive player both in matches and as Iron Man, so an attack that would cause sleep quickly wasn’t expected, so Steve had to pull out the big guns early.
“I promise you that this is no joke. Captain Steve Rogers has not only been found but found alive.”
“There is a floor just for you all to play in, and you want to start a house party in the New Guy’s room?” Tony asks getting all the Pokemon's attention. You, Tony’s Togedemaru waved his tiny forepaws excitedly sparking at the cheeks at the idea of a party while he stood on Steve’s Shieldon's frill. Tony just picks up the sparking ball of steel wool and shakes his head. “Everyone, out of the pool. Come on.” With the exception of Steve’s Pokemon who had ever right to be there, all the others slowly filed out Even Pepper looked sad about it as she had been apparently making fast friends with Sister.
“But still, your Pokemon would be a challenge.” Tony raised an eyebrow, it might have been a long time ago but Tony still new a battle request when he heard one. Then Steve looked at Natasha again. “I’d like to challenge you both to battles.” They exchanged a look with each other then Tony looked at Bruce silently asking if he was challenged too, Bruce shook his head.
When Tony gets his first Pokemon he thinks there's something wrong with it.
“You just want them to throw eggs at me over the Hibachi.” Tony says sourly.
“Sweetheart, most boys your age are excitedly watching Pokemon matches or chasing girls with Venepide to make them scream. They aren’t trying to build their own car engine.” She delicately takes the egg from him and hands it to her Gothitelle who examines it as she pulls her son up into her lap.
“Sky drop.” The bird swooped and grabbed the ball of joy up roughly, losing its grip after the Iron Barbs
“Still, saving my team and giving me a place to stay is a big ask for someone who doesn’t know me.”
“Steel wing.” Tony commanded and immediately Steve called out for Justice to use protect which he used fast enough to block Happy’s attack.
“I’ve called him, Feya.” She says as she sits down on the couch next to Tony, Jammira turns in Tony’s lap to get a look at him, he blows a bubble at her from his nose and as if compelled by an outside source, the Vulpix lifts a paw and pops the bubble, they both seem to find this very amusing.
“This is a Captain Unova’s in S.H.I.E.L.D custody and wanting to know where his Pokemon are thing.”
“I was four. He’s a great Pokemon but really. It’s in the history books that Dad and Steve worked together. It’s a good thing only a handful of people know his name.” Tony says as they walk out of the elevator and onto the common floor, where Phil Coulson and Lola were waiting for them by the window.
“Most of the time. Fire is the problem and I have Happy around when it gets out of hand. Short of pulling out the cotton wool, I think he’s going to me more than safe physically and mentally.” Tony replies which just gets a look from Coulson that suggests he doesn’t agree with the assessment but doesn’t plan to rile up Tony over it.
“More than that, they’re fighting fit and looking forward to seeing you again. Their balls weren’t salvageable, and I thought with all they’ve been through putting them in luxury balls was the least I can do.”
“They’re probably upstairs waiting to tell you not to upset our new septuagenarian. Or he has a job for me. Who knows.” The pair and their Pokemon get in the elevator and ride it up to the next level. “The real question is. What are you going to do with Captain?”
When Tony had managed to release the Pokemon from Steve’s damaged Pokeballs, they were obviously still in their warring mindsets, making Tony glad that Dum-E, Happy and Pepper had been with him as these Pokemon's first instincts had been to strike out at the person releasing them who obviously wasn’t Steve. The Audino, was the one who got the others to stop once she had caught a proper look at Tony, she had ignored Pepper’s shouts for them all to stop once she locked eyes onto him, using protect on herself as she stared at him, tilting her head slightly.
That was all Tony had needed, a small shot of confidence from his mother something that even at this young age Tony had come to rely on his mother to help him navigate his father.
“Mr Stark implied that you weren’t one to play around.” Steve grins peaceably towards her, clearly missing who he intended target was. “But if we’re playing too rough…” His voice playfully trails off, Natasha brushes the hair out of her face before throwing her last ball into the arena.
“I hope nothing in that box is important.” Tony says to Steve as Dum-E hovers past him and into the building. Steve watches the Metagross stare hard at the box as he went through the automatic door.
“Well, after 200 shows you learn to have a certain way with kids and Pokemon I guess.”
“How is she?” He asks sounding concerned.
“It’s okay by me.” Natasha says looking over to the Pokemon and finding that Feya was balancing You’s round body on his nose to the delight of Jammira and Star.
“It is a good look on you, Steve.” Natasha adds Tony, knows this isn’t the first time they met. She had been brought in to assess how he would take on a female attacker. She was pleased to see while he was holding back, it was because he naturally seemed to hold back when sparing but it didn’t mean she left the assessment bruise free in the slightest. Steve continues to look bashful as he thanks her for the comment but managed to rein in his boy-next-door ways and looked between Natasha and Tony.
“Thanks, J—Hey!  Dummy, stop it!  Don’t put that there, that’s—!” Tony was abruptly cut off when half of the objects on the workbench fell to the floor.
Rhodey mutes the television again and looks at Tony pointedly.  “Do you have any idea how it feels to find out that my best friend has been dating someone through a gossip talk show?”
Steve gives him a smile that mirrors his own before closing the distance between them.  He gently tilts Tony’s head before slotting their mouths together in a kiss.
Steve shook his head. “I wouldn’t hide something like that from you guys, especially if it could affect the team.”
,” Natasha said, closing the door before Tony could even get a word in.
“Yeah, okay,” Tony grumbled, admittedly too tired to continue the senseless arguing. “Shut the lights when we leave, J?”
“She was?”
"I just found out that
Tony looks at him imploringly. “What missions could they possibly have without SHIELD on their asses every day?”
“Hey, if you’re all gonna be living under my roof, you better get used to my rules,” Tony proclaims, making the other three look at him with bewildered expressions on their faces.
“I don’t work with anyone
Tony frowns. “What is it?” he asks, brushing the hair away from his eyes.  ”Are you okay?  Thor warned me that you might feel a little drunk, but I didn’t think it’d be this bad.”
“There’s nothing wrong with wanting to be close to someone,” Natasha says slowly. “It’s perfectly normal to depend on others.”

“Yeah?”
“I’m gonna fuck up,” he answers. “Again.  Steve’s going to need me, and I won’t be there because I’m gonna fuck it up again like I did with Pepper.”
“A mistake, right?” Steve snapped, wrenching his arm out of Tony’s hold. “Tony, we can’t just
“I am not,” Thor confirmed before striking the Wrecker with lightning. “The Wrecker and Thunderball are subdued for now,” he announced when the former fell to the ground in a heap.

“By the time I’m through with you, you won’t be able to string any words together to form a coherent sentence,” Steve said with a smirk.
“Our waitress was blatantly flirting with you, and you didn’t flirt back,” Tony informed as he inspected a piece of pepperoni on his pizza.

“You didn’t ruin anything,” Rumiko assured. “In fact, I’m glad we got the chance to just talk.
“Anyone who says you’re a shy, innocent boy scout obviously doesn’t know a damn thing about you,” Tony states.
He let go of Tony’s hand and Tony flexed his fingers.
“That’s ridiculous.  None of you have to pay me back.”
“Just shut up and take the damn thing already,” Steve interjected, ignoring the other man’s protests and draping it over his shoulders.

“My suit is ruined.”

After a few years, the touches begin to linger.  Tony can’t recall an exact point in time when it starts, but he revels in it all the same.  It becomes second nature, and eventually, Tony expects it when Steve seeks him out to go to lunch.  He finds himself leaning towards Steve before he even reaches out to touch him.  The attention turns into actual affection, and Tony starts to

“Uh… Tony?”
"Will you be moving into the castle after you graduate?"
“Steve’s there.”
“Yeah, okay.  Bye.” Tony pocketed his phone and turned his attention to Steve. “Your fixation on this car is getting a little unhealthy,” he remarked as he approached the taller man.
“Don’t be silly, sweetheart.  You could never hurt me.”  Steve visibly relaxes then, so Tony figures he’s said the right thing.  “Just lie back and enjoy the show.”
“Yeah, yeah,” Tony says. “Although, I’ve gotta say they took the news pretty well.”
“I had a good night’s sleep,” Tony replied.  He turned off the stove, removing the sizzling bacon in the pan and transferring it to a plate.
“You’re ridiculous.”
Tony felt Pepper’s expectant gaze on him, so he just shrugged in response before busying himself with the coffee maker, resisting the urge to snicker when he heard her sigh.  He knew he was being childish, but a small part of him kind of missed getting Pepper worked up over these things.
Man, his life is weird.
Steve laughs. “You’re only saying that because I don’t step on your feet anymore.”
“Hi, honey,” Tony greeted lamely. “I take it your meeting with SHIELD went well?”
“No, really.  I mean, I knew I wasn’t your first, but to hear it from your

“Yeah?” Steve asks. “
“Peggy Carter did.”
“What changed recently?” Tony questioned.
“…you know, the night’s still young,” he said, gently pushing Tony onto the bed.
Tony just rolled his eyes and took another swig from the bottle.
Tony sets his mug down on the worktable. “What happened?”
Steve scoured the cabinets for a pan to fry some eggs in, but stumbled upon a waffle iron instead.  “Hey, JARVIS, do we have any waffle mix?”
“You love me,” Tony says.
“You have no right to talk,” Steve retorts.  “You’d spend every waking moment with your armor if you could.”

“Was that really necessary?”
“What’s wrong with that?  I can’t imagine Captain America wanting to get drunk enough to strip and dance around the tower.”

“I don’t think so.”

Sam nods. “Will do.”
.  Tied to the vase is a note indicating that the arrangement is from a “secret admirer.”  Tony brushes it off like it’s nothing, gulps down a shot of espresso, and grabs a bagel before heading to his office.
Steve smiled a bit at that. “Impossible.  I could never get tired of you.”
Tony can feel his entire body thrumming with energy; can hear the blood pulsing through his veins.  Kissing Steve always made him feel like this: so happy, so carefree, so…
Steve shrugs and takes one for himself: so what if he already ate over a dozen while baking them only a few hours prior?  They were still delicious.
“You want to date me,” Tony said incredulously, getting a nod in return. “That is a terrible idea.” “
Then again, Steve’s could probably make something like stealing candy from babies look adorable.

Tony pulled off abruptly, lips slick and red. “Why?  You can go again, can’t you?”
Tony laughs bitterly. “If I had a nickel for every time I heard that–”
Tony touches their foreheads together. “You gave me a home too, y’know,” he says quietly.  Steve swears he can hear Tony’s voice break a little, but he doesn’t comment on it.
“I’m sorry, Mr. Stark,” the older woman says, and she does actually sound a little apologetic, “but unless you are on the approved list of visitors, I cannot allow you to go upstairs.”
“Take me to what?” Steve asked.
Tony scrutinized her. “Natasha called you.”

Tony looks at him disbelievingly. “Still doesn’t change the fact that you have a very strange obsession with your shield.”
“Mine’s dirty,” Clint said.
Pepper said without further explanation.
Steve shook his head. “I’m sorry, I have to—I can’t do this right now,” he said before walking out of the room.

“I don’t want to leave you,” Tony whispered. “I can’t even bear to think—”
“I love you, too, by the way.”

He had rented out the entire restaurant for their first date, an action that somehow inspired Steve to give a five-minute lecture on extravagance and being wasteful.  The man probably would’ve rambled on for much longer if Tony hadn’t told the owner to open up the dining room to other patrons.
“What are you two talking about?” Steve asks when he returns.
"Trust me, they aren’t," Pepper assures.
He shakes his head.  “No, it’s not… I don’t…”
Steve huffed a response as he grabbed a mug from the cupboard and poured himself a cup of coffee.  He knew the caffeine wouldn’t really have an effect on him, but he still found comfort in the drink.  It was a reminder of Sunday mornings spent at the diner with Bucky after Mr. and Mrs. Barnes dragged them to Sunday mass.
"So..."
Steve grabbed a couple plates from the cupboard and some silverware from the drawer before setting them on the counter. “I try not to ask any questions.”
Steve blinked in confusion. “Mom and—”
“I hate you so much right now,” Steve grumbled.
Tony turns to Steve for clarification, but he looks just as confused as Tony is.
“That... that blows, man,” Sam said apologetically. “I’m sorry.  I don’t know what to say.”
“Told you, s’not the medicine,” Steve says indignantly. “S’you.  I’m happy ‘cause of you."
Bucky sighs and leans back in his chair. “I’ll admit I had my…
He and Steve had called a truce after Loki was sent back to Asgard, but it wasn’t until after the Mandarin fiasco, and after Steve and his ragtag team burned SHIELD to the ground, that the two of them had actually spoken in person again.  Tony had visited Steve in the hospital after fishing his shield out of the Potomac and then invited him—and the other Avengers—to live in the tower, figuring that they could all try to give the whole team shtick another try, especially since there was no one there to boss them all around anymore.

of the spoon against the mug as Steve stirs in the milk and sugar.  It probably should’ve been awkward, but Tony’s glad to find that it isn’t in the slightest.
Tony swears his heart rate increases the closer they get to the top floor, and he’s afraid that he’s going to faint again once the doors finally slid open, but Phil just ushers him out of the elevator and practically pushes him through the foyer and into the sitting room.  Phil leaves Tony there without word and shuts the door behind him.
“You’re a goddamn idiot!” Steve scolds, glowering at him.

"The one and only," Steve replies with a grin.  "Shall we?" he asks, gesturing to the chair he's pulled out for him.

The sheets are still rumpled from the night before, and the pillow under his head faintly smells of soap and gunmetal.

“I don’t know what crap Natasha’s been telling you, but Tony and I are not together.”
He’s memorized the coordinates of every single star he’s ever dedicated to him—made sure to be able to memorize their location from anywhere on a clear night.

Literally.

“C’mon, Tony.  You’ll have a—”
Tony looks at him expectantly. “So what?”
He manages to utter a broken “I miss him” before falling to his knees and surrendering to the tears.  The room immediately falls silent, save for Steve’s sobs.  Captain America, their nation’s icon, breaks on live television: it’s a sight that no one had ever thought they’d see, let alone be possible.
Steve smiles. “I’m glad.  I’d like to take you out tomorrow, if you’re free.”
“That’s different,” Tony says with a shrug as he scrubs the last of the caked-on chocolate off the plate in his hand.  He rinses it off under the hot water before turning off the faucet and drying his hands with another towel. “I don’t know why I put up with all of you and your shenanigans.”

“Sam went down to DC for the weekend, and Thor was visiting Jane, but he should be back anytime now.”

“According to this, she’d still be CEO,” Natasha informs. “You’d just assume Tony’s role as President. Makes everything a lot easier for any children you guys might have—”
"Mr. Stark, are you really the Prince’s long-lost lover?"
Steve is, even though the picture is somewhat blurry from being taken so far away.
“No, she wants me to help her pick out a new paint color for her room.”
“Go away.”
“Okay.”
Oh. Well, that… That isn’t what Tony expected. “How are you so sure that it’s for me?”
She laughs, a beautiful, melodic sound that echoes down the hallway. “It’s kind of difficult not to,” she says.
“Or Thor and the balloon animal guy in Central Park,” Hill said. “The sugar is fine,” she added, after tasting the batter.  “I think it needs more vanilla, though.”

Regular missionary sex, Tony can deal with.  Of course, it would be fun to switch things up every now and then, but that involves relinquishing some control, and Tony doesn’t like the idea of being left in such vulnerable positions.  In fact, he can count the number of times he’s ever bottomed on one hand because it’s just entirely too much trust to put in someone.
Tony rolled his eyes. “You know what I mean.”
It only spurred another wave of arousal to course through Tony’s veins.
Steve turned his head and found Tony’s face inches away from his.  However, he wasn’t fazed in the slightest—he had long ago grown accustomed to Tony invading his personal space. “That’s not very nice.”
“Is this really necessary?” Bruce asked, warily eyeing the painting on the wall.
“Still, you probably didn’t expect to spend your evening playing therapist.”
“What do you mean by that?” Tony asked dubiously. “How do you accidentally adopt a dog?”
“Uh… I
“Oh.”
“Shut the hell up,” Sam grumbled.
He sits up, the sheets pooling at his waist, and stretches before getting to his feet and walking over to the expansive floor-to-ceiling windows in his suite.  He’s completely bare, and he shivers slightly from the air conditioning in the room.  For a split-second, he regrets leaving the warmth of his bed, but the city is just so beautiful this late… or maybe it’s early, who really knows anymore?
Reed’s mouth sets into a hard line, but he motions for Steve to enter the machine once the levels are steady. "I’m sending you back to exactly two minutes the incident.  I’m not sure how long it will be until we can get you back, given the limited amount of time we’ve had to set this up,” he informs.  "There’s no guarantee that you can change the events, and even if you do, we have no idea what other else could transpire because of it.  I can’t guarantee that everything will turn out okay, but Bruce is right: the world needs Tony in this time, and I believe it’s still a risk worth taking.  We just have to prepare for the worst.  Do you understand me, Captain?“

“A few times, but I wouldn’t mind if you said it again,” Steve replies.
“Enjoy your night!" Thor calls out after the retreating couple. "May it be pleasurable, and the orgasms plentiful!”
“Do you remember the days when we weren’t dating?” Tony asked.
“A few years ago, I didn’t even know you were Iron Man,” Steve supplied.
Tony tries taking a sip of the caffeinated drink in his hand and almost burns his mouth in the process–Bucky,of course, takes a huge gulp without flinching at the scalding temperature.
“It’s my money.”
Steve looked at Thor questioningly.  “What?”
The woman had gotten so upset with Tony’s inability to spare time for her that she had stolen his car and crashed it into a tree.
“Then how the hell did someone get a hold of—”
“It’s nice,” Tony replies when he’s righted up again.  He’s still seriously baffled by the abrupt change in topic, but he presses on anyway: “I used to hate this kind of stuff when I was kid. It reminded me of the dance lessons my mom forced me to take when I was younger.  But I actually like this jazzy, big band stuff a lot now,” he admits.
“Complicated?” Sam offers. “Yeah, I get it.  You look like you have something else you wanna tell me, though.”
“Is that an appropriate dress to be wearing to a ball?” Tony asks coolly.  He has the tendency to fidget when under pressure, so he busies himself by twirling the olives in his martini.
worry about you, especially since you seem to have an affinity for jumping out of planes and facing off against armies of drones by yourself.”
“She’s… pleasant,” Tony says as the blonde walks away.
Steve shrugs because the others are already murmuring in agreement.
“What about Venice?” Tony suggests.  The last time he had been there was over thirty years ago with his mother. “We could go in September.  It’s supposed to be really nice that time of year.”

And another.
“What is it, then?”
The place is extremely crowded, and it takes Tony almost twenty minutes to find Steve, who’s chatting with a bunch of kids Tony recognizes from around campus.  Steve sees him and immediately makes his way over.
“I’m sorry, Steve.”
Steve looked back just in time to see Tony rub his eyes.
It never goes the way he expects it to: it’s always too rushed, too rough, and it hurts him more than he’ll ever admit.  He’s been told that it’s normal for it to feel a little uncomfortable at first, but even by the end of it, he doesn’t feel right.  His partners always seek their own pleasure first, and by the time they remember to help him out, Tony’s too tense and apprehensive to enjoy it, and he makes them get it over with as quickly as possible.  Afterwards, Tony’s left feeling sick to his stomach at the thought that he actually
“I didn’t think I’d have to.  He was
“Tony, I—"
“Well,” Steve says, glancing down, hands slipping into his jeans’ pockets, “you haven’t seen all of me yet.”
“You,” Steve replied.  He shoved Tony’s sweatpants down just far enough to grasp his cock.  “I want
Steve tucks his hands under his head and looks up at him leisurely. “You want to date me.”
“I don’t know why you all think I have such a fascination with Buzzfeed.”
Steve closes his eyes and exhales. “Tell me about your day.”
enjoy.”
“Don’t worry about it,” Steve said. “I know you didn’t exactly come here for a vacation.”  The invitation had come out of left-field—going to Paris together wasn’t exactly normal, not for two friends anyway—but Tony hadn’t wanted to go alone, and the team had assured Steve over and over that they could take care of things on their end for a week.
“Not on your life,” Natasha interrupted. “Pretty sure you can count Sam out too considering he’s already gotten sick three times this morning.”
Bucky shot a nervous glance in Tony’s direction. “He isn’t… What does he want from you?”
.  The workshop is where they fell in love, and Steve wouldn’t have it any other way.
Tony is married to the only man he’s ever been this crazy about, and all he can think is: “I must have done something spectacular in my past life because there’s no other logical explanation for you ending up with
It was hard to believe that the other day, Steve had looked like every bit of the ninety-eight years he was supposed to be, but now…
“I love you,” Tony says in response, and he feels Steve hug him tighter. “I really,
“Oh, that’s rich coming from you,” Steve responded.
“I highly doubt that Steve—
The first thought that came to Steve’s mind when he woke up was that he was warm.
“What are you doing?” Steve asked, flopping down on the bed next to Tony.

“You’re wrong.”
“I just… I haven’t—Nevermind.  It’s stupid.”
Steve rolls them back over, capturing Tony’s lips in a sweet kiss.  He tries to reciprocate the feelings that Steve pours into the kiss, but it’s so overwhelming that Tony can’t do anything but ground himself by holding onto Steve’s shoulders.  Tony falls asleep with Steve’s arms wrapped around him protectively, both of them boneless and utterly spent.
, Mr. Stark,” Rumiko said playfully. “I saw the way you were looking at him.  My father used to look at my mother the same way.”
“Albie is cuter than ‘Einstein,’” Tony explained. “I call that one ‘Chewie’ because it’s short for Chewbacca… aaaaand because that little guy may or may not have chewed up your favorite pair of running shoes.”
Tony couldn’t help it.  What started out as a snicker turned into full-blown laughter.  Why did he always find himself in such ridiculous situations?
“I guess we’re both pretty stupid then.”
“They’re not the same.”
me,” Tony says when they pull apart a moment later. “You can’t expect me to not have a reaction.”
“Then why didn’t you tell me?  Why all the lies and the secrets?”
“And you’re being awfully rude to the royal family’s guest,” another woman—a brunette in a stunning red silk gown—cuts in.  There’s an air of elegance around her that Tony is both intimidated and captivated by. “It’s nice to see you again, Marie.”
“Is the Hulk, yeah.” Tony paused and looked up from his work. “Still too much?”
“Then I don’t see what the problem is,” Steve countered.  “Do you not want everyone to know?  Because that’s fine, really.  I know you want to protect me, and I get it.  I shouldn’t have brought it up.  But I don’t see why we need to end this—”
“Funny.  I was about to say the same about you,” Steve says.  He leans in for a kiss, but is interrupted when a grape hits him square on the nose.  Steve and Tony look towards the kitchen and find Clint, Natasha and Sam sitting at the table.
Tony drops his coffee when he hears someone yell his name.  He looks towards the entrance of the cafeteria and sees Natasha running towards him.  She looks relieved, like a weight has been lifted off her shoulders.  It’s as if—
—Oh, god,
fucked, and the advantages and disadvantages of various positions.
“You’re here,” Steve breathes out, looking at him in amazement, like he can’t believe Tony had even bothered to fly down and see him.
“Oh.” Tony looked away. “Well, I wouldn’t blame you if you were.”
“You could’ve,” Tony mutters. “Just as easily as anyone else.  You aren’t invincible.”
Tony’s hand closes over it, the brilliant luster a sharp contrast to the horrible ache in his chest.
“I’m fine!” he shouted, feeling a twist in his side and an ache in his gut. He was fine. He was! So what if he wanted to cry? It wasn’t like he wasn’t allowed to, but he just didn’t want to do it in front of Steve.
They abruptly pull apart at the sound of Natasha’s voice, and look towards the doorway to find her and Sam with smug looks on their faces.
“Extravagant,” Steve finished.
Steve made his way to the opposite wall, examining the single photo that had now taken the mural’s place: it was taken Christmas morning, with all of the Avengers piled on a large arm chair.  They were still in their pajamas and wearing ridiculous themed hats, wrapping paper strewn at their feet.  Jane, who had been visiting, insisted that the team take a photo of their first Christmas together.  Clint, who was perched on the back of the chair, and Thor, who was standing behind it, were giving each other bunny ears.  Natasha was seated on one of the arms; her feet dangling off the edge.  Bruce was sitting on the floor trying to clean up the mess of paper.  Steve sat in the middle with Tony on his lap.
…come to think of a it, a sex tape with Tony sounds like a pretty interesting project.
"Are you sure she’s fixable?” Steve asks.  "No offense or anything, but if you can’t fix it, I can try somewhere else.“

He broke the kiss and peered down at Steve, eyes wild with arousal as he unzipped the fly of Steve’s jeans and teased the his cock out with a couple of lazy strokes strokes. He smirked when Steve threw his head back in relief.
“Great,” Tony answered. “Pepper’s going to love it.  I already signed the contract.” “That’s great.”

Steve shrugs. “It could’ve gone worse.”
Tony freezes just in front of the elevator when Steve calls his name.
“Cap here used to draw for the comics,” Tony chimed in.  Steve glanced over at Tony to see that the other man wasn’t even looking at him. “He even helped write the stories of his own comic book during the war.”

It certainly wouldn’t be the first time anyone accused him of being a masochist.

Steve turned over to find Natasha sitting on the edge of his bed. “Things may not have gone as I had planned,” he admitted.
“It was a nice surprise,” Tony admitted. “We’re calling the cat 'Captain Kirk.’”
Steve just shuts him up by pulling him down for a kiss.
“Couldn’t sleep,” Tony replies, propping the shield up against the wall.
Tony tilted his head. “You make it sound so simple.”
thinking about taking you out somewhere proper—dinner, maybe even dancing, but I think this works too,” Steve said. “Marry me?”
"Oh, my fucking God.”  Tony gapes because there, on the television, is a photo of him and Steve from the night before, walking around the city.
He closes his eyes and takes a few deep, calming breaths to try to collect himself.
Tony rips the covers off of the bed. “C’mon, we need to get ready.  Pepper’s going to have my head if I’m late again.”
“Well, we’re pretty sure he hired someone else to do it.”

“No!” Tony answered firmly. “What could have possibly given you that idea in the first place?”
Tony scowls. “Well, that’s just rude.”

Tony looks down at his hands. “It’s not that simple.”
for 2016's 12 Days of Stony.
Steve must have noticed his predicament too, because he took one hand off of Tony’s rear and took hold of Tony’s length, stroking it in time with his thrusts.  Tony met Steve halfway on every thrust, clenching down on Steve’s cock.
Natasha stole a glance at Clint before asking: “You guys
“But it’s true!” Tony shot back. “You’re worth it to me, Steve.  Even if you and I never speak again, it would be worth it.  You deserve the world, and I’m going to do my damn best to give it to you.”
Pepper said levelly,
Steve takes both of Tony’s hands in his own. “To be fair, I wasn’t planning on telling you.”
Tony found Steve waiting in their room.

He gets his first job only three days later attending some charity function with a woman a good ten to fifteen years older than he is.  She’s in the middle of a very messy divorce with her husband who spends more time in the bottle than he does with their kids.
“So what?  He just gave it to you?  Tony, he’s…”
“I think I’ll need some convincing before I accept."
Pepper countered.
, Steve wanted to say, but he bit his tongue.  Howard hadn’t been a bad person when Steve knew him—a bit of an ass sometimes, but then again, who wasn’t?  But learning about this entirely different side of Howard and the kind of person he had become to neglect his own child—to neglect someone as wonderful as
"Thank you," Tony says when they get to the communal floor of the tower. "No one’s ever…" He ducks his head a little. "Tonight was great.  I had a really nice time."
Thor blinked. “I was going to say ‘be ecstatic about your rapid recovery,’ but yes, he will probably do that too.”
Tony loved Steve.
“You’re sure.”
“From my mug,” Tony said.
Frigga shook her head. “No, I know for a fact that he was talking about

Tony’s friends worry about his attachment to the star athlete, but Tony just shrugs it off and goes on a date with someone from his computer science class just to prove a point.
“A bit.”
“It’s Natasha’s birthday this weekend, but she’s going on a mission tomorrow, so I’m throwing her a party tonight at eight,” Tony explained. “Both of you are obviously invited.”
“Why did you do it?” she asked. “Was it because you had something to prove?  To him?  To
Steve just grabs Tony by the arms, practically pulling Tony on top of him.  Steve hides his face in the material of Tony’s shirt. “M’okay now,” Steve says, hugging Tony even tighter. “‘m very happy.”
He moves to follow the two spies into the kitchen, but bumps into the coffee table and almost knocks over a vase.  The noise makes Tony stir, but the man just snuggles closer to Steve and falls back asleep.
“Ridiculous,” Steve repeats, trying to wipe off some of the frosting on his face.
“What happened between you and Pepper
The workshop is where Steve sees Tony at his happiest, and his most somber.  It’s where Tony feels the most accomplished, but at times, dejected.  It’s where Tony can be the most vulnerable—the most

.  “I don’t understand how you can even look at me right now.  None of this would’ve happened if you hadn’t gotten involved with me.”
.  Maybe it was the romanticism of the city, or maybe it was just the fact that the two of them were sitting on a hotel bed together wearing next to nothing—but Tony recognized an opportunity when he saw one, and he knew this could be his first and final chance with Steve.
“Who else would it be, Pepper?”
Pepper stated, and Tony could practically hear her rolling her eyes at him all the way from the Pacific.
Tony narrows his eyes. “Y’know, your snark was cute at first, but now it’s just annoying.
Steve pulls him in closer and kisses his hair. “We both will.”
“Well, not
Tony had to agree: he didn’t know how long he would’ve lasted in the superhero business if he didn’t have the rest of the team at his side.  The last thing Tony wanted was to go back to those days when he worked alone.
Despite the fact that Tony had no more interest in the party scene, there were some occasions that still required his presence.  After all, hosting parties and playing nice with absurdly rich investors was part of the job description for one of the most prominent businessmen in the world.
“What’s wrong?”

“Aha!  So you
Tony puts his soldering iron down, strips off his gloves and goggles, and makes his way over to Steve.  He wraps his arms around the blond’s torso, and Steve buries his face into the crook of Tony’s neck, inhaling the scent of metal and a hint of ivory soap.
“You’re very passionate about cupcakes,” Steve observes.
“So who was it?” Tony asked, going back to the matter at hand.
Tony had tagged along because it was a Friday night and he had nothing better to do, but Bucky had side-eyed him the entire time. At one point, Tony had heard him mutter something like: “What the hell are you doing with a
Steve groaned and clawed pathetically at Tony’s shirt. “C’mon, Tony.  This is ridiculous. I love you, you know that,” he said. “I love everything about you.”
“I need to pee,” Steve announces.
Tony nervously cleared his throat. “Uh, thanks?”

It turned out that the police

“The rest of us have plans, but
He startled when Steve picked up another log and tore it in half with his bare hands.
Prompt: Steve/Tony + "grab"
“Do you really want to do this now?” Steve asked tiredly, stepping around Tony to dump the logs inside the shed. Thunder cracked, and Tony watched Steve’s profile as the blonde tipped his face up towards the sky. They were both silent for a moment before Steve’s voice cut through the air again. “It was because of Bucky.”
Steve blinked, slow and languid, and pulled off Tony’s cock with a slightly-obscene pop. He ran his thumb below his own lower lip and smirked up at Tony. “I thought you were doing just fine on your own,” he replied, voice promising pleasure with every curl of his tongue. Tony stared at him for a moment, dazed at the sound of it, before he dropped onto Steve’s lap and pushed him onto the muddy grass.

impulsive, but he was a man of his word, and he was going to follow through with it.
Tony grinned. “So our little assassin is secretly a thespian.  Who knew?”  He polished off the rest of his waffle. “JARVIS?”
So he goes back to school and does what he can to forget about it all: he drinks more, tries more drugs, and gets in bed with more people than he can remember.  He falls into the wrong crowd, but still manages to keep up a friendship with Rhodey (he’s the sole reason why Tony makes it out alive in the first place).
Tony swallows. “You have every right to be mad at me, Steve.”
“Yeah, you’re right,” Tony said, making his way over to the en suite. “I’ll see you tonight for dinner?  I should be done around five.”
“I’m not an invalid,” Tony muttered.  He continued his bitching even as he slipped his arms through the sleeves to better protect himself from the wind—he hated seeing the smug smile on Steve’s face whenever the man was right about anything. “Thank you, by the way.” “It’s just a jacket.”
Tony eyed the offending four-legged creature warily, taking a cautious step back when it tried to jump out of Steve’s arms.
things to my ego.”
“Alex,” Steve corrected. “And that was a blind date too.  Courtesy of Sam.”
However, he wasskeptical as to how to go about the process.  It wasn’t as if he had been very active in the dating pool himself: he and Pepper didn’t exactly get together under conventional circumstances, and none of his relationships before that didn’t exactly end well.

Steve shook his head. “The dog was at the shelter for over six months, and the cat was there for more than a year.”
He was in love with Tony, and there was no denying it now.
“Steve, you don’t
“Yes, we are,” Tony announced, playing along and tugging Steve out of the elevator. “And did our lovely children behave while we were gone?”
“Don’t thank me just yet,” Tony said.  “Wait ‘til you see your honeymoon suite upstairs.”  He let
Tony was ready for the paparazzi.  He was ready for the stares he’d get while walking down the street, and the murmurs of the other kids in his classes.  He was ready to deal with being photographed while out in public with Steve, and ready to answer the ridiculous questions from prying reporters.
good for something though: dramatic entrances.
“I already did.”
Steve sighs, walking around the table so he can stand next to Tony. “Don’t you think I should dictate who I want in my life?” he asks. “Who I want to be with? You can’t just say things like that—say that you aren’t ‘good enough’ to be with me, because I’m not anything special, Tony.”
“All right,” Tony said, sitting back up in his chair.  He clasped his hands together and looked at
“I…I think… No, I do.  Want to,” Tony said, a faint blush on his cheeks again.  “Marry you, that is.”
“I tried calling you,” Tony replies.  “It’s not my fault you jetted off to God only knows where.”
What they were doing at that moment was already so different from the frantic desperation of their first time.
“No shit,” Steve replies fervently, and then blushes at the laughter that his swearing garners.
“Oh. That’s… that’s good.”  He smiled wryly. “I’m sorry, I’m just having a difficult time processing all of this.”
“Oh.  That… sounds good.  Great, actually.”  Tony leaned forward in his seat, resting his chin on his hand. “Did you have anything in mind?”
“I know,” Steve murmured, kissing Tony’s jaw. “I love you.  I know.”  Without further warning, he twisted his wrist, and Tony cried out in release.  Steve would never get tired of watching Tony come: the look of pure ecstasy on his lover’s face forever engrained in his mind.  Steve thrust forward a few more times before tumbling over the edge himself.
“Do you really have to go all the way to Japan?”  Tony is most definitely not whining.  Nope. He is a grown man that most definitely does not whine.
Tony didn’t know if he wanted to laugh at the irony, or kick himself for wasting so much time that they could’ve spent moving their relationship forward.
Of course, Tony had had plenty of experience kissing others—he’d also had plenty of experience having
Steve just smiled, not bothering to dignify Tony with a response and instead fixing his attention out the window, and the two fell into companionable silence.
“Tony…” she calls out, her tone much softer than before.
“Oh, God.  I called you, didn’t I?” Tony says mortified.
“He’s chasing after Loki,” Tony corrected.
Tony frowned. “Don’t you?”
Tony abruptly sat up again. “You’re awake?”
Tony nodded, standing his ground. “We made a deal: twenty years of my life in exchange for twenty more for you.”
“Are you sure there isn’t something I can do?” Tony said—he was not begging, but he had a feeling it was something very close to that.
“Great job, Thor,” Clint said when Thor arrived to help him and Natasha, “because what three unarmed Avengers need are even angrier superhumans enchanted by Asgardian magic.”
“I thought you said that we were going to a charity auction in Manhattan,” Tony says as the car pulls up to a seaside country club.
The design on the mug was starting to fade now, and there was a small chip in the handle, but Tony always insisted on using it.
“Look,” Steve starts, “Up until a few months ago, I didn’t think I’d ever fall in lo—feel this way,” he corrects himself, but it’s too late, because Tony’s already heard it.  “I was… content with my relationships, because they helped fill the void—if only temporarily.  But
“Touché, so thank you for buying the food
get a cat.”  Steve set the dog on the floor and it quickly scurried over to Tony’s feet.
“No one wanted them?” Tony asked.  Both of the animals looked young, particularly the beagle who looked to be no more than a year old.  He couldn’t imagine why anyone wouldn’t want the two loveable creatures in their home.
Thor turned his attention to the photos in his hand. “These are magnificent.”
“Well, you’re not exactly giving me a very positive response here,” Steve replies anxiously.
“Move, please.”
Tony shook his head. “Too good,” he replied. “I’m not gonna last if you keep that up.  Not all of us were blessed with a super-soldier sex drive.”

that seemed even remotely interesting.  He had to admit that events such as this also bored him to tears, but as team leader, he couldn’t let that show.  While Thor was still telling battle stories, Natasha, Clint and Bruce appeared to be in deep conversation.  Tony was, of course, at the center of the room surrounded by throngs of people; his voice a perfect accompaniment to the live jazz band playing on stage.

He hears Clint fall out of his chair.
Steve can still feel Tony’s gaze boring into his skull, but the last thing he wants to do is look him in the eye.  He doesn’t know if he’ll be able to handle the rejec—
And just like that, he’s done it.  He’s been told it would feel like having a huge weight lifted off his shoulders, but he just feels like he’s going to go into cardiac arrest at any moment.
“You love it,” Tony counters, taking Steve’s hand and sucking the frosting off of his fingers. “And I love you,” he adds, kissing his nose.
“No, I didn’t, but the night isn’t over yet,” Rumiko pointed out. “C’mon, I think you owe me at least one dance before this boring party ends.”
Steve knew something was off the moment he stepped out of the elevator.
—grabbed a couple of pillows off of it and tossed them onto the floor.  At the very least, it wasn’t hardwood, and the carpet felt pretty plush beneath Tony’s feet.
“Tony…
Tony’s eyes widened in shock. “No,” he said, jerking away from Steve’s reach.  He abruptly stood up and took a step back. “You don’t—you don’t want to marry me, Steve.”
Steve feels his face practically burst into flames.  “
“You wanna get married?” Steve asked.
“It appears to be from your secret admirer, Sir,” Jarvis says, glancing knowingly at Steve.
with others—but this one simple kiss with Steve was so novel and made all of his past experience seem laughably inadequate.  Tony had kissed plenty of people in his lifetime, an act practically second-nature to him, but with Steve, Tony could barely keep up.
“Hey, don’t get us wrong,” Clint says. “We don’t give a fuck what you guys do; we’d just appreciate it if you kept it behind closed doors.”
“Tony, we don’t have anything.  I don’t want to h—”
“And men,” Thor interjects.
“Steve,” Tony whispered. “Hey, Steve.”
“At the end of the year.”

“Could you please talk a little quieter?” he asks.

“You were the only one that didn’t crash on the first try,” Tony recalls.  “It was very impressive.  Are you still…?”
Steve felt his right eye twitch.  He wasn’t ashamed about his sexual proclivities by any means, but he had never been the type to broadcast anything about his personal life. “Both of them.”
“I didn’t
“Damn right,” Steve agrees, kissing Tony again.
Tony gripped the sheets as Steve set a punishing pace, riding him good and hard.  Tony could feel something deep in him stir, and he muttered a curse when he realized that his cock was hardening again.

Tony rolls his eyes. “Oh, shut up.  You know you’re amazing.”

But being on the Avengers had given Tony the opportunity for so much more.  They were a group of people that Tony genuinely cared about—a group of people he didn’t even
Tony’s eyes widened comically before grabbing a handful of napkins and dabbing at his mouth.
“Steve?” Tony called out softly.  He placed his hand on Steve’s arm, and that’s when he realized that Steve was shaking. “Steve, babe, what’s wrong?”
By the time Tony looks back up, Steve’s gone.
“Steve,” she repeats, and then her eyes widen.  “
“No, you’re right.”

Literally.
“Are you
“Speak for yourself,” Tony retorted. “You won’t heal any faster if you don’t sleep.”
“I don’t know whether to feel embarrassed that yet another portrait of me exists, or offended that you didn’t ask for our permission first,” Steve said, looking at the painting with a critical eye.  He could appreciate a fine piece of art, of course, and it
“Stop being so hard on yourself.”
Within seconds he’s experiencing cataclysmic internal combustion.  He slams the briefcase shut with a crack and every eye in the room turns to look at him.  Pepper’s eyes narrow with murderous intent.
“Great,” Steve said in turn.  He went over to the cart and poured a cup of coffee for himself before taking a seat on the edge of the bed.
“I can take it down if you guys really don’t like it,” Tony said, his tone defeated.  The others made non-committal noises, but Steve saw that he was frowning slightly. “I was trying to figure out a way to make this place more home-y, but we can definitely find something else.”
Steve didn’t bother waiting for a response before ducking outside.

Tony’s lips ghosted along Steve’s neck. “Do you need my hand?” he murmured.

“I’m gonna fuck up, Steve,” Tony said. “I mean, look at us!  I already did—” “That was just a misunderstanding, Tony,” Steve reasoned.
Steve looked physically
The interviewer asks Tony if he’d like to answer questions too, but Tony declines as politely as he can and gets back to doing his own work—he knows he’ll probably have to do these things at some point, but he isn’t ready. Not yet.
“No, I should be sorry,” Steve said. “I shouldn’t have brought it up—”
“Of course not,” Tony replied, mildly insulted. “That’d be a waste of time.”
Steve had lost count of how many times he’d found Tony passed out in his lab from pure exhaustion.
talk?” Tony asked, and the look on his face almost made Steve want to oblige, but Steve knew they couldn’t put this off.
, was intoxicating.  He relaxed his mouth, taking Steve as far down as he could go.
Steve just closed his eyes and leaned back on the bed, trying to block out the bright lights of the room. “Oh, how the tables have turned,” he mumbled.
Tony gaped, pausing mid-step. “Was that—were you
He wandered around the building and eventually found himself in the hotel gardens.  He took a seat on one of the stone benches overlooking the pond and had just begun to relax when his phone alerted him of a new text message.
“I don’t think
Steve had been the easiest to convince and, within a few weeks, all of the Avengers had taken residence on their assigned floors.  It wasn’t very often that they were all home at the same time since they all seemed to split their time between multiple places, but knowing
“Hey,” Tony greeted, stopping just a few feet from him. “You feeling better?”
“I think it’s best if we ended things now, before I get the chance to hurt you,” Tony says with a shaky breath, and he may as well have just punched Steve in the gut with the look he was giving him.
“Tony.”
“The typical work day involves a break every now and then too,” Steve chided. “Besides, just because this is far from your worst doesn’t mean I won’t worry.  I know you’re important and have a million and five things to do, but you still need to take care of yourself.”
Steve tripped over his own feet in his rush to get to open the door.
But now, as they walked the crowded city streets, Steve’s attention was zeroed in on Tony and Tony alone.
“Whoa,” Tony said, cutting him off.  “Who said anything about this being a bad idea?”
“I didn’t blow them off,” Steve countered. “I called them.”
“So you revoked my access codes because you

Steve nods. “I do.  I have… for a long time.  I just didn’t think you felt the same way—”

“I should’ve told you,” Tony says, defeated. “I
Steve turns his head and looks up at him. “Away?”
As smoothly as Tony thought they could be for him and Steve, anyways.
The miracle is that no one bothers Steve about it.  Sure, his phone is ringing off the hook, and the team’s secretary is struggling to keep up with all of the messages, but none of them are trying to pry.  I mean, there weren’t many bad messages to begin with after Tony died (only a couple idiotic ones about him being a war profiteer or whatever, but they were obviously baseless since it’s been YEARS since any of that happened), but the media keeps asking for quotes from the team members, especially Steve.
