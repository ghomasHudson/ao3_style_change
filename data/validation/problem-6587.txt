he thinks, vision hazy, and head swimming in an impossible vortex. He’s trying to look around, but despite the pathetically sheer blindfold that covers his eyes, it’s still difficult to see anything in what he thinks is a dark, barren room. There are no smells he recognizes, and no sound either. It’s quiet.
Steve closed his eyes, suppressing the heat and sting growing behind his eyelids. He padded silently away from the door. The only sound he emitted was a soft clank of metal against metal as the vibranium circle suspended on a delicate chain swung side-to-side upon his chest.
I regret all that I’ve done. He didn’t deserve this end. I keep thinking about it, about the shock, the fear, the loneliness he must have endured at the end. Pain so formidable even the great Tony Stark couldn’t survive. Tony, a man with a silver tongue, breath forced from his body as his lungs were crushed and he was beaten to a pulp. In the end, even his words couldn’t save him. He had so much to live for, and it was stolen from him.
His room was dark and cold, and felt emptier than anything he’d ever experienced before. A stifling weight set heavy on his chest as he surveyed the room that felt so foreign, he was almost sure it couldn’t be his.
He didn’t want to ask it, but like the wind, it could not be contained and slipped from his unwilling lips. “What did he do with his ring?”
“It comes up, from time to time, with just about anyone who’s willing to talk about it. But, honestly, not a lot of people really care much these days.” Steve thought about how few people in his life he’d been able to have these conversations with. When he was young, he only shared his thoughts with the stars he wished upon. It brought an easy comfort to know Tony was someone he could confide in. “You think you’ll ever figure it out?”
He discovers the cave affords plenty of room to walk about, and is only mostly enclosed. A large portion is exposed, revealing a waterfall flowing from overhead, and a breathtaking view overlooking a lush valley of trees. He turns to see Nomad stagger in, blood still flowing from his head, and he tumbles to the ground. It’s clear he’s suffering, and Tony drops to his knees beside him to assess his injury.
It’s all he needs to hear before he covers Steve’s mouth with his own, kissing him with all of the force that three years of thinking one’s lover is dead will amount to. There’s the coppery taste of blood, but he doesn’t care, it’s Steve, it’s
JARVIS plays something else. It’s new, soothing, eerie. The raspy voice sings in Spanish, and Tony starts to piece most of the words together, awkwardly deciphering the meaning in his mind. It’s a macabre story, but the melodic tune allows for the song to be still palatable.
“Bruce, so you’re sure this will get rid of any Chitauri tech, if there is any?” Steve asked in a more hushed tone, even though he knew everyone in the room could hear him.
“But remember, you’re healing, yeah? After each mission you need to be grounded. Allow me to take care of you.”
Tony was so full of life. I still think of the nights we were together...I feel him on my skin and taste him in my mouth and hear his voice softly in my ear as if it happened yesterday. I always have, and I suspect I always will. He was so physical, but not in the way I had come to expect. He was expressive, and free, so free with me unlike his disingenuous, flirtatious, smart-ass persona he loved to flaunt. Most of all, on those nights when the whole world faded away and only we remained, Tony was sincere. I don’t know how I managed to lose what we had. I don’t know how someone bursting forth with energy and excitement and passion can just vanish from this world. It’s a paradox my mind can’t begin to comprehend. I feel myself slipping further and further into this unsolvable abyss.
Something jerked away from his hand, and as the world slowly began to come into focus, he realized the face of a horrified Tony Stark was staring intensely at him, lost somewhere in confusion.
“I love them. They’re perfect.” Tony punctuated his statement by placing a kiss on Steve’s cheek, standing on tip-toe to reach the perfect spot. “Your place looks great. You’re still comfortable here? Do you need anything else?”
“So...you wanna know why I brought you up here?” The brunet was smiling back, and shuffled his feet coyly to distract from his obvious insecurity.
The words flowed from him, and he began to feel the tension in Tony’s muscles ease under his hands. Familiar warmth filled him, dropping lower and lower in his core. Suddenly, there was too much fabric between their bodies. God, why was he still wearing so many clothes?
It was a grueling battle, the culmination of days of work tracking down Loki, and the team could feel stability slipping through their fingers.
“I don’t think this is really going to work,” Tony mused, pressing his fingertips to his mouth to conceal the involuntary smile that pulled at his lips.
Song lyrics are in italics, and hyperlinks to full lyrics are in the song titles. Most of the translation for the songs in languages other than English is courtesy of Google, but hopefully my vague knowledge helped ensure it's not totally incorrect (feel free to let me know if it's wrong!).
The words suddenly don’t matter. The sentiment is a confusing reminder of the invasion and of the Captain all the same.
“I want this,” Tony pressed the words into Steve’s lips. He sounded sure. Steve knew better than to argue. He wanted this, too.
When Tony finally pulled away for respite, Steve dropped his forehead to meet Tony’s. Skin touching, sharing one breath, Tony felt warm and rapturous. A sadness tugged at the back of his mind, but there was hope so blinding it was easy to know he was safe, and so was Steve.
His eyes burst open abruptly, vision obscured by white - white was all he could see. Panting, dizzy, incoherent, he rolled his head to the side, he was forgetting something over there, he knew he was, but what was it -
. Darkness filled his mind. He felt it growing and filling every space, sucking and consuming everything it encountered. He missed the warmth, he missed the light, he missed Tony. He couldn't breathe, his chest was clenched with an impossibly tight hold constricting his ability to breathe.
The smell of burning shook a jolt through his core whenever he thought he smelled it. If he heard heavy machinery, he turned the other way.
And yet, words unspoken still charged the atmosphere, regrets sat heavy in his throat, and pain threatened to break the thin thread of niceties that barely existed. There now existed a tiny ball of heat in his chest so volatile that Steve believed it might spontaneously combust without a moment’s notice. It hadn’t even been five minutes, and he already felt raw and exposed in Tony’s presence.
“No way I can top that. What poor person is out there eating increasingly spicier foods while naked with each of their partners?”
Steve closed the distance with four swift paces and gave a quick brush of his lips to that insatiable grin. Tony replied with a contented groan as Steve was nearly out the door.
Steve looked around. They were in a rooftop garden, and for it being the center of New York, it was surprisingly quiet and peaceful. The sun shone warmly across crisp blue skies, views of the beautiful city sharp and clear. “This is amazing, Tony. I didn’t know you had a garden up here.”
Tony shifted and brought their lips together, kissing him with the unflappable confidence that Steve so cherished about his boyfriend.
Tony said nothing, eyes still blown wide, body rigid, until he started to pace a bit. “What are you doing here, Freud? You wanna talk about my mom next?”
was starting to feel like a whisper from the man on his shoulder, only he couldn’t tell which side was speaking.
A bright smile formed across his face, fueled by a warmth blooming inside of his core. He knew Tony could have always asked JARVIS to pass along the message, or even ask one of the other Avengers to do it, too, but Tony knew him so well. The physical paper requesting his presence was simple, but Steve cherished the thought Tony had put into its execution. He realized he was becoming overwhelmed by a piece of paper, when he was being summoned to see something even more meaningful than a note from the man he loved.
“You like it?” Steve questioned, finally turning his attention to the brunette, who was casually sitting in a tired chair. His first destination after returning from the difficult mission was to climb to the roof of the compound, where Tony almost certainly spent most of his days amongst papers and books, no matter the hour. “You have no taste, sweetheart.” His tone was an attempt at a light jest, but it still came out rough.
“What do I do? How do I fix this? How do I get him back?” His tone was biting as Steve’s watery eyes implored up at Natasha, but as quickly as he caught her focus, he averted his gaze again.
Steve gave a half-hearted eye roll, contemplating his assured tardiness, then immediately chastised himself for his reaction. Tony was exhausted, alone in their shared bed, and asking only for a brief acknowledgement before he was to leave him for at least the next 20 hours, if not longer. Tony was kind and patient, and open, so open for him. He followed Steve across foreign continents, undoubtedly risking his own world to do so.
“What you feel is real, Tony, it is, you have to trust yourself, trust me, I feel it too-” Steve tried to refute, to change his course of thinking, but Tony was gone, so far gone in his conviction.
am I listening to Pink Floyd?” Steve dispatches the attacker and leaps forward, on to the next target.
So, they must know each other somehow, as he clearly has reason to conceal his identity. Tony contemplates the familiar tone, but his head is still rushing all the while and it’s a challenge to focus. He must indicate as such, because he feels the man stop and set him down again. “Drink,” he says, low and soft. Something cool and smooth comes to his lips, and he accepts slow sips of water. The hydration is pure and refreshing, and without control over the container he greedily leans forward for more, gulping loudly as he swallows. He feels the bottle move away and he gasps for air, suddenly aware of how parched he’s been. After his breath steadies, he feels the rim of the container return to his lips, and he hastily accepts more.
He heard the low hum of the voices of dining guests grow a little louder, and sensed the atmosphere shift. Turning around to see what had changed, he saw something he never thought he’d see.
“I love you, too.” Tony’s gasping voice was so raw sounded almost foreign. Steve pushed up and caught Tony’s gaze. The emotion was palpable, and as he came down from his orgasm, Steve could feel the trust radiating from Tony’s heart.
,” Steve relaxed his arms and walked to Tony, wrapping him in a secure embrace. “I get it. You’ve been through so much.
.” Steve turned back to see Tony holding out something small and metal, catching the sun in a bright glittering glow. Tentatively, he took it from the inventor’s hand. Shiny, polished silver wrapped in an endless loop, rolling at the edges in a rounded curve, such that the place where the metal ended didn’t even so much appear to be a defined edge, but an inviting slope continuing in its movement. The detailed craftsmanship was mesmerizing, but there was a soft turquoise glow emitting from the inside loop. Steve examined it closer, and gasped.
“God, Tony, you look so good,” he moaned as he trailed kisses and alluring caresses across his skin.
“The music you played, it really helped boost morale.” Steve’s shoulders are more relaxed, and he starts to shift on his feet a bit. “Thank you for bringing the team together in such an unconventional way.”
“Just like always. And then, you’ll have an incredibly stylish, one-of-a-kind piece of artisan jewelry, from yours truly.” Tony turned away from the shield to shoot a wink to Steve. “I’m putting my heart into this for you,” his tone quickly turned serious, determined brown eyes burning into his own unwavering gaze.
might.” Tony motioned for Steve to follow, and led him through the crowded room toward a vacant table in the corner, a sign with the word “reserved” displayed squarely in the middle. “Come on, let’s sit and you can tell me where exactly you ended up.”
appropriate,” Tony purrs. Steve is relieved his face is obscured by rubble as he pushes forward against the invaders so no one can see his blush.
“C’mon, Cap.” Tony shot a mischievous look over his shoulder as he trailed off to a vacant sitting room. Steve followed close behind.
“Alright, Stark, I think I’ve got it. You both feeling ok? In your right minds? Cause it’s not like I don’t support a good marriage, but something’s not adding up for me here.” Fury’s expression was unreadable as always, giving nothing about his intentions away.
“But I don’t know that I really believed myself when I said it. I just...kept saying it and saying it, when shit was too hard, when I didn’t think we could come back from it, and I guess somehow I believed our time would expire, we’d be done, and I could live out my days telling myself there was time to fix it with you, even if it was a lie.” He paused, allowing for a protest, but none came, so he forced himself to finish what he had started. “I wouldn’t have to own up to what I’d done to you, or acknowledge the unchangeable fact of you being stuck with me as your soulmate when you inevitably left me. But you never left.”
“You’re Tony Stark.” His name sounds seductive on his tongue in such a way that his stomach churns. “Brilliant scientist. Former Avenger. Last of the Stark name. Delectable in every imaginable way.”
There is so much out there, the burden of his newfound knowledge begins to stifle his breath, his head dizzy, he’s falling again, until -
He never noticed how frequently his left thumb brushed against the calloused underside of his third finger. The movement met no resistance, and with each subtle caress the tired hollowness ached in his heart.
I never should have fought him, started a crusade against him. I know now what my ego has cost me, cost us all. I should have talked to him, been honest, broken down the walls that grew so thick between us over all these years.
Tony starts to feel better and better with every new shade of blush that colors the Captain’s cheeks. “Sure, Cap, you know, I actually wasn’t sure what that thing could do until I put it on this very morning. I was as surprised as you that it could fly. I suspect it runs on some form of electricity.”
Bruce followed the blunt instruction and returned with his supplies. He placed an IV for Steve first, and then repeated for Tony. “Alright, first, you’ll be sedated and will go to sleep. Then, we’ll introduce the toxin. You’ll wake up in less than an hour and be able to recover here in about that much time. So, uh, see you soon, boys.”
The juxtaposition of a deep, rough voice contrasting soothing alto-soprano singing airily is almost enough to distract Steve from the irreverent words. “This is hardly appropriate right now, Tony,” Steve complains.
“You’re so handsome,” he started, barely breathing the words he spoke. He watched auburn eyes carefully as he continued his praise. “You look good. And smell good. But it’s more than that. Your heart is good. As is your mind." Steve leaned closer to whisper darkly in Tony's ear. "I bet you taste good, too. God, look what you do to me. I can’t help it when I’m around you.”
Steve holds Tony tightly, pressing his lips into his hair. A pang of worry strikes him, threatening his newfound serenity.
He walked with a determined pace, looping around the back to a secluded garden. A brunette was standing against a sleek railing, looking out upon the city.
Those words had called out to him when he first heard them. He read SHIELD’s files, he knew Howard Stark's son was Tony, and Tony was Iron Man. Since learning about Tony, he’d wondered what a flying man would look like against a clear sky. And now, he's fighting alongside him, and gets to see this miracle first hand.
As Steve was about to concur, the song started to become more clear, and it was growing more and more familiar with each note. He glanced up to the tower, to find the team hanging out of an open window - he didn’t know any of the windows actually opened - Natasha with a large speaker in hand.
It feels wrong, none of this feels right. Something deep within me tells me it should be me in his place, I should have died for these choices. I would give anything to take his place.
His stomach sinks, heavy and metallic as if filled with lead, but then, he realizes what Iron Man is doing about it.
“I never stopped loving you, Steve,” he whispers back before he’s kissing him again, long and slow, savoring every taste, every sensation of the intimacy for which he’s longed.
And now, Steve sat tensely on the edge of an oversized couch, eyes darting around to observe every stimulus. His expression was neutral, but Tony knew there was immense suffering hiding behind his furtive eyes.
Tony tries not to stare at how gorgeous Steve looks, slumped over his food, eyelids heavy and pink lips slightly parted. A song he’s never heard plays on a single speaker somewhere in the corner of the small restaurant. The words are sung in Turkish, maybe? Probably.
Tony.” Steve paused, strategizing carefully with how to proceed. He began to sway Tony gently as he continued to make his case. “I’ll always be here with you. You’ll
“For putting on the suit,” he huffed. “Well, it could be used for that. Or maybe I Indulge in wishful thinking from time to time.”
“I heard those agents talking. They said there was no way you could have known about me yet. Why am I
When Steve came out of the ice, after SHIELD first attempted to hide the truth from him, they corrected their course of action and instead provided an incredibly comprehensive assimilation training. They covered major historical events, language and colloquialisms, current culture, political status, even insofar as to discuss the kinds of food he should expect to eat. Most anything of major significance that would aid in his understanding of this new era was addressed. As the instruction commenced, Steve realized there was one thing he still had questions about.
“I-” Steve’s voice falters, and to Tony’s utter surprise, he stutters a bit before continuing on to answer the question Tony posed. “I wanted to thank you. You were really impressive out there,” Steve’s voice is as stiff as his posture now, Tony observes as his vision starts to focus again. “I- I mean, I was impressed. I mean, I didn’t know the suit could do that, that you made something that could fly. Well, I knew it could
A few weeks passed and every time Tony saw Steve he would make sure to try not to mention their relationship or his undying love. He made sure to stay a few feet away from him or else Tony would hug him and never let go. He was afraid this might scare Steve so he avoided eye contact and stuff like that. His friends tried to be supportive, but Tony chose to avoid human contact.
Steve felt like utter shit. He made Tony upset, he disappointed everyone, he lied to his friends. All the emotions that were pent up inside were slowly bubbling up to the surface and threatening to spill out.
“It’ll be okay,” a voice said from behind him. Sandy was staring out towards the horizon. “You’ll make up. He’s just afraid.”
! We’ll talk about this later. Please.” Natasha’s voice was sharp and her eyes were piercing the back of Tony’s scalp.
“Tony, you know that we are worried about you. I’m sorry I can’t be here for you more often. Please know that if you need to talk, call me. I’ll always pick up even though you don’t always pick up my calls.”
“Tony, you can’t be mad at that. We are all a little stressed right now. It was completely understandable and Steve will see that once he gets his memories back.”
“I guess I just got overwhelmed is all. It’s nothing. I’m okay now.” Tony let go of Steve and went to go sit on the grass. Steve didn’t understand what had just happened. First, Tony holds his hand on the beach, they don’t see each other for days, Tony shows up as a human, they don’t even slightly talk about what had happened and have become really awkward, and now Tony was hugging him like his life depended on it. Steve silently cursed life for being so complicated.
“Well, first things first, I’m Tony Stark. I’m a merman, if you couldn’t tell. I guess I decided to throw caution to the wave and expose myself to you.” Steve snickered at Tony’s funny way of talking. “What? What’s funny?”
Hi everyone. Just a heads up but some of the stuff I'm writing about was not included in the AU on my Instagram. It honestly makes for a better story if I add stuff so yeah! Have fun reading!
The next morning Steve woke up around 6:30 to the sun barely shining into his room. He was still jet lagged from the time difference and sat up bitterly. Steve trudged into the kitchen to see Peggy making herself toaster waffles.
Steve sat, listening to the waves for a few more moments before hearing a small gasp. Steve’s eyes shot open and he scanned the area for other people.
Steve rubbed the sleep out of his eyes and grabbed the empty mug from when Peggy had come to talk to him. He put on the coffee pot and threw some pop-tarts in the toaster. Anything more complicated and Steve would have to use his reserve energy to explain it.
Steve was quick to come up with an idea, “I can keep it for you. I’ll bring it to you when you want. Or maybe…” Steve trailed off, but thought of an idea. “Are there any underwater caves around here that you know of?”
Wanda tried to comfort Steve, “We understand, Steve. Stay here. Try to see if you can remember anything.”
Steve put down his glass and said, “Probably going into town like you suggested and getting a feel for the local customs and stuff.”
“Me? No way. I’ve always got my head in the bubbles and no one wants to hear me ramble about humans. My dad keeps trying to set me up with some mermaids, but every one he picks is so… boring.” Tony was staring at a sea crab making its way down the beach. “How about you?”
The one person Steve could never forget was Tony. Tony this, Tony that, Tony all the time. It was all he could think about in the morning, at night. Steve pushed down every impulse and feeling until he could hold no more. Tony equally had been avoiding him which made it really hard to decide whether to speak up or hold everything back.
The shallow water came up pretty high into the cove, but there was still room to walk around. The water was clear and turquoise and made Steve feel happy. He didn’t know why, but something put his mind at peace.
Steve began to spend most of his day working out, boxing, doing some sort of physical activity to stimulate his brain. The more he worked the more he remembered anger, disappointment, sadness, loss. As the negative emotions came flooding in, he cut himself off, became cold, and spent all day boxing to feel something. There were days were Steve would punch the bag so hard it flew off the chain. More often than not Steve would break down crying until someone heard him and came to his rescue.
Tony’s face lit up and he threw the book open. “Steve! This is amazing! Ahh!” Steve blushed and stared at his lap. Tony continued his excitement, “I don’t even know what these are, but they are soooo cool!”
The boys sat in silence. The waves lapped lazily over them. Steve had been zoning out when he felt something: soft fingers laced their way through his own and gripped his hand. Steve’s head shot down to where he saw Tony’s hand intertwined with his own. He felt a small tingle creep it’s way up his arm and into his whole body. He looked up to meet Tony’s golden eyes. Steve tried saying something a few times, but words wouldn’t come out of his mouth.
Peggy was flailing her arms and Steve was laughing at her. She flicked water at him to make him stop and continued, “He got knocked down! And was lost at sea for five days. When they finally found him he had washed up on the beach completely unharmed except for bruised pride. They asked him how he was alive and he said, ‘It was the mermaid’s kiss that did it.’”
Steve picked up the book and flipped through a couple pages. It seemed interesting enough (not like Steve could understand any of it), so he moved over to the art section.
Bucky laughed, "Wow. Real smooth. Steve, this is Anthony Stark. He owns Stark Industries and built this complex for us. He also has a tendency to blow things up."
“Steve,” Tony put a hand on Steve’s arm. Electricity sparked where their skin touched, and his heart was beating one hundred miles per hour, “Don’t worry. I want to come see your art. If it’s anything like that drawing you left me, it sounds amazing. I’ll see what I can work out.”
Finally, Steve was done after lots of intensive labor. His phone said it was already 6:30. The auction would be starting in half an hour which meant that Tony didn’t have much time left either.
Steve almost turned around, but something told him to keep going. Steve sighed and checked his phone; he was still early. Steve landed in the sand and sat on his rock. The sun was still high in the sky and wouldn’t set for another hour or so. Steve waited and watched hoping for something to happen. He checked phone a few more times until it was finally 6:30.
“I’m sorry guys.” Steve’s head hung in shame. His chest felt tight. Steve willed tears not to fall. “I know I’m probably letting the team down, but I can’t trust that I’ll be safe. I’m going to be completely honest, I’m terrified to go outside by myself these days,” this was a true fact. Steve hadn’t been outside in a month, “I may have been some strong Captain before, but that’s not who I am anymore.”
Next thing Tony knows, slick fingers are parting his cheeks, slipping over his opening. Is that what Steve had been doing in his nightstand? He moans as Steve presses one finger in all the way, one big hand holding his cheeks apart as he sets about stretching  Tony open.
It’s the surprise of it that really caused Tony to cry out, and the same which has him whipping his head around to stare at Steve, still buried inside him.
, slow and heavy. His cock ached in the best way, pulsing dollops of clear fluid with each perfect thrust of Bucky’s thick cock, the fingers still there, still inside, holding Tony open and vulnerable in the best way possible.
When someone makes the grave mistake of yanking his head back with brutal fingers to show his bruised and bleeding face to the camera broadcasting their lover to them, his hands bound behind him with biting handcuffs that are slowly leaking blood to the concrete floor his chair is bolted to. When they are forced to watch him cry and scream as he is slapped and beaten and electrocuted all for information he would rather die than give.
. I went about this all wrong. I just felt like you deserved to know I saw you that night. And I know you would never ask me to do something I was uncomfortable with. Of course I know that, you are the most generous and kind partner I could ask for, that’s not what this is about at all.”
Bucky pushed in again and Tony felt weightless, the fingers finally slipping almost easily as he began begging.
And Tony does, because he may be embarrassed, but Steve and Bucky seem to love it when he gets overwhelmed like this, though it doesn't happen often, and Tony is flying so high right now, so bright and shining, like a star being born, and he wants to be good for his Doms, he wants to be so good…
but in this state he’s not sure how Steve would take that, so instead, he just bites his lips and nods, pushing his backside into the caress of Steve’s hands.
That startled a chuckle out of Steve, and with a shaking sigh he crumpled forward, smooshing Tony into the mattress.  Tony wrapped him in his arms. “If you changed your mind about this, that’s okay. It doesn’t have to be tonight, it doesn’t ever have to happen if you don’t want to.”
“Hey, sweetheart,” Steve whispered, pulling Tony closer to him so he could tilt Tony’s head back for a soft kiss. “You look gorgeous.” And he did, wearing a black robe Steve hadn’t seen before, satiny and soft beneath his fingers. The edges were trimmed in a delicate lace and Steve let his fingers slip over it, nudging it back so he could bare more skin to his touch.
There's a split second of wondering if perhaps Tony is with someone else, but it's discarded as soon as it appears.  Steve knows Tony can be trusted.
Maybe he can surprise Tony in a different way than he was originally planning. Steve slips through the rooms silently, approaching the slightly ajar bedroom door where he draws up short. For a moment he's not sure exactly what he's seeing.
,” Tony gasped, his breath heavy and humid, pressed into the curve of Steve's neck. Behind him Bucky thrust again, so sweet, so deep, before he let out a groan so rough it vibrated through Tony to settle in the casing of the arc reactor.
Even with Steve not actively trying to get Tony off, Tony's own pleasure is a bed of coals, stoked slowly hotter, slow to warm but sure to be all the more blistering in its heat because of it.
So sue him. You would lose anyway. All he would need to do was line up the Avengers and present them to the judge.
Steve makes a sound of approval and leans back, his hands going to caress and squeeze the derriere he's suddenly become so possessive about.  And
So, Tony was nervous as well. Of course he was. This was something people who had supposedly cared about Tony had mocked and belittled him for, had told him something was wrong with him for wanting. The fact that Tony had been hurt badly, but was still willing to share this with Steve, even after Steve had watched Tony without his knowledge...
Still, he's intrigued. Both of them have high sex drives, Steve even more so since the serum. It's not really rare for one or the other to discover and join in on a moment of solo sex.
Tony flexes his shoulders, rolling out tension from a long day, and Steve matches it to the way Tony threw back his head as he grasped his own ankles.
“No, babydoll,” Bucky answered, though Tony wasn't sure he had spoken that aloud, he hadn't meant to, anyway. “You are
It's not that Tony doesn't know how fast Steve is - he has to calculate that all the time on the field when he needs Steve to be somewhere or needs to know where Steve is going to be and when.
The omega blinks, slowing down the movement of his hips as he watches Tony lick his lips and glance down at where his hands circle Steve's cock. It's large, especially for an omega, and Tony is staring at it with a strange look on his face.
“Can I Tony? I want to feel you,” Steve whispered in between kisses. Tony's arms went around him, fingers tangling in his hair as Steve nipped lower, sucking and tugging on his hardening nipples until Tony whimpered, kissing around the casing of the reactor as he moved between them, tugging slightly with his teeth to hear the way his alpha's breath hitched.
And when Steve crawls up his body, worship in his eyes and mouth, care in his hands and touches as he cleans Tony up and lays him back in a clean bed, Tony smiles at him, and says,
“That's it,” Steve continued, smiling up at him as he gently wiped at Tony's cheeks. “So good, aren't you sweetheart? So good for us, letting us have you like this. You don't even know how much we wanted, how much we dreamed about this. Me and Buck, imagining our Sub, gorgeous and gracious, who’d let us have them like this, who’d give themselves so perfect like this.”
"I should be thanking you," Steve says. And that's not enough, not near enough to encompass what Tony has given him. "For your trust in me, to let me share this part of you."
"Steve!" he whines, only to be ignored. But when he feels Steve slip down the waist of his pants to pull out his own hard cock, Tony changes his mind and instead drops his head back down as Steve slowly works his way inside, adding more lube as he goes.
Tony’s cock twitches and Steve can scent the slick slipping down his own legs. Tony looks half drugged, his eyes fluttering when Steve rubs his fingers on the alpha's prostate, testing and coaxing, cataloging what makes Tony twitch and shiver, what makes him flex and groan. Steve’s usual desire to be filled is completely absent, and suddenly all he can focus on is how Tony will look wrapped around his cock. How his soft little hole will spread wide open for Steve, engulf him, how it will feel that have this newly coveted piece of Tony all for himself.
And then he follows exactly none of that, and like an idiot blurts out over date night dinner, “I saw you the other night.”
What if he messed up? What if he couldn’t give Tony what he needed? What if after all this, he failed somehow?
Fury has it razed to the ground after three seasoned shield agents run out to empty their stomachs from the sights that greeted them upon entry. He's seen some shit, but what was inside there will haunt even his dreams.
For a few moments, Tony just sits there, saying nothing. Then he looks up, and Steve can see his eyes are wet, though not spilling over.
He feels his eyes flutter, roll back and suddenly pleasure, molten and burning washes over, through, around him. It engulfs him even as he chokes on it, so intense black edges his vision as he hears both Steve and Bucky crying out his name, pulsing inside as he feels his body grip them, squeeze them, pulse around them to drag them along in his own rush of euphoria.
All sorts of images flashed through Tony's mind. Straining bodies, bulging muscles, hot, sweaty men pinning each other to the mats in the gym…He might be dating a gorgeous specimen of a human, but he wasn't blind to the appeal of his other teammates.
“Shh, baby, shh. We got you,” Bucky says, breathless against Tony skin as his arms hold Tony tightly to Bucky’s chest, his mouth sucking bruises into his shoulder as Steve is shifting beneath them, wriggling a little as he's also telling Tony, “I know what you need sweetheart, I know. Easy, easy, holy
“Yeah, that’s right,” Steve croons, pushing in as deep as he can, giving Tony what he wanted, what he begged for. “Come on, sweetheart, give your Omega that pretty knot, I want it. Want to watch you pop that beautiful knot while I fuck you like you need.”
His alpha is bad about getting something in his head and torturing himself with it until he spills out what's really bothering him. Because of this tendency, Steve has to be careful that Tony isn't just going along with whatever in an effort to make the people he loves happy. They've had a few conversations about it since they started dating several months ago and it's still something they need to work on. Even so, Steve loves how generous his alpha is when he knows Tony is offering this to him, even through his own discomfort.
with Tony’s hole slick and soft stretching on his fingers, he’s burning up with it, heating from the inside like molten metal.
And his body opens more, softening, and Steve marvels at the way it lets him in. He feels powerful and heady with desire, having to work for this acceptance of his flesh into Tony’s body, some kind of challenge he never knew to want before. A benediction and a prize. He wants it now. Well, he knew he wanted it, but
Steve jerks back from the door, his heart pounding and his cock throbbing. He’s pretty sure he's wet as well, but he needs to give Tony some privacy.
good, but there's an edge of something new tonight, something that Tony didn’t think Steve would ever really want, and he’s praying it’s not just because Steve is a bit intoxicated. Tony feels heavy and hot, a little fuzzy, as his lover carves out a place for himself inside Tony’s body, still spewing filth as he settles in.
The flight was an early morning one and Steve hadn’t slept much the night before or on the plane. Exhaustion had set in and Steve felt like passing out. Steve changed into sweatpants and flopped onto his bed. After a few minutes of mindlessly scrolling through Instagram, Steve fell asleep.
Tony got to work. He didn't sleep, he didn't eat unless Pepper forced him to. He barely even left the workshop unless they had a mission or something needed to be fixed around the compound.
“This looks like a present from a mermaid. Stories say that when you get noticed by a mermaid, they like to leave little presents like shells and things. Did you leave anything back?’
. Though Bucky claimed that he had known Steve the longest there must have been something different with Tony
Tony nodded and off the boys went to the pier. Tony still had a slight frown to his face despite the happy morning they were having together. Plus, Tony didn’t even know what Steve had planned for the night.
Wednesday came and Steve was beyond nervous. He not only had the art show that Sandy was counting on him to deliver on, but he promised Bucky and Natasha that he would reveal his true feelings for Tony. It was going to be a stressful day.
Tony calls after him when he spots him in SHIELD’s hallway, running to catch up to him, and Steve hears how Tony begged before he came, invoking Steve's name, unaware Steve was watching.
“Holy shit!” Tony yelps when Steve just pushes a little farther, pulsing and nudging as deep as he can possibly go. “Yes! Anything, anything. Honey, you gotta move, you gotta-” Tony cuts off with a gasp when Steve does just that. Rolling into him with measured strokes, linking his fingers with Tony’s and pressing him back into the bed.
In answer, Tony just locks his legs around Steve’s waist, his own hips rising up, thrusting his body on Steve’s cock. Steve pulls back farther, sitting up and trading his grip on Tony’s hands for a grip on his hips. He lifts him, angling him until Tony starts making those high sounds Steve has wanted to hear for weeks. He looks down at his alpha’s cock, baring his own teeth at what he sees. That hadn’t happened even when Steve had watched Tony come on his toy.
Fingers tangled in his hair, wrench his head back, and Steve allows it, afraid he’s said too much. But beneath him, Tony is looking at him in awe, and his voice is rough when he says, “And you think I’m not the same? That the way I feel about you doesn’t terrify me sometimes? Steve, you have to know...You have to. It’s the same for me. I would give you everything. If it’s you, I’ll let you take everything. I just want the same in return.”
Tony's flying, soaring, listening to every glorious, filthy word Steve is panting out between thrusts. His orgasm has been building through each one of Steve's, stacking like a jenga tower until there's only one conclusion left. Every muscle in his body feels like it tightens, his arms are reaching up and over his head, grasping and clawing at broad shoulders, tugging at damp, sweaty hair.
But Tony's not quite ready yet, and honestly, Steve's not quite done exploring this himself. He hooks his fingers, purposeful and searching. He finds that bundle of nerves even alpha's have here, hidden in such an intimate place, and when he plays with it Tony makes one of those noises Steve has only heard that night he unwittingly spied on him.
Of course, all of them are capable of it, perhaps even Tony more than any of them.Because Tony knows violence, and he knows whether he's on his knees worshipping and being worshiped by his bonded, or on his feet fighting with them side by side, though they are surely all capable of it, the thing they all share...
Time gets fuzzy for a bit, and by the time Steve comes back, he realizes he’s squashed Tony into the mattress again. He tries to shift up, but Tony is clinging like a limpet.
Bucky is panting into his neck and Steve is staring up at him like he's a vision from the heavens, sweat beading on his forehead and glistening on his pink flushed chest.
Date night starts with homemade lasagna - Tony’s grandmother’s recipe no less - progressed happily through dessert, and finally into the bedroom where other appetites are begging to be satisfied.
“You think you saw me there? But that’s not possible. I was home the whole time. Or are you saying you think something screwy is going on, like alternate universe me or time travel or something?”
There's a breath of hot, humid air over Tony's dripping hole and he makes some kind of questioning noise, since words are beyond his reach right now.
He pulls his fingers away, searching for the bottle of lubricant so he can prepare his cock as well, but he can't see where it went. Tony is whining, making desperate little begging sounds, and Steve doesn’t want to make him wait while he searches for the bottle, so he slips his hand down, gathering plenty of his own slick and uses it instead. He presses the head of his cock to Tony’s entrance, and Tony makes a wounded little noise. Steve looks up worried something is wrong, but Tony is just staring at him, mouth open, fangs on full display.
“Sweetheart?,” Steve gasps, reaching to wipe his face again, “baby, is it so good you're crying?” Tony just nods, gasping a sob for real now. “Yeah, baby, go on, cry if you need to...
His Alpha. All his. No one else was ever going to get a chance to have this from Tony again, because he was
And then Tony sparks like tinder catching, Steve holding all of his weight, cradling him against his body where he can feel every heave of breath. Growling in his ear like a dirty fantasy Tony never knew he wanted.
He smiles at them both, still a little floaty, but not so much that he can't put a husky tone in his voice when he says, “We are so doing that again.”
Tony wants to respond, he really does, maybe to beg for exactly what Steve is saying, or to ask if Steve has been replaced by an alien, but the only thing currently running through his brain is
"Mmhm," Steve hummed, noncommittal, as he stood next to the bed and poked around in his nightstand. Tony watched him from the corner of his eye, not sure what his lover was doing exactly. And then Steve said, "The movies were okay, but after we drank, we wrestled a bit, I think Thor misses having his friends to do that with."
He floats, suspended in blue nets of light that turn him, tickle him soft and sweet til he giggles and purrs. He sways in their grip, blanketed in the warm glow that stripes down his skin in firm brushes. He sighs and hears his name from far off. Beloved voices beckoning, and the blue light fizzles out on his skin, whispers of kisses as it releases him to hands warm and full of tender care.
Steve presses a kiss to smiling lips before pulling back and carefully slipping his softening cock from Tony’s body. He can’t resist the urge to watch the way the rosy skin pulses a little, heat crawling up his spine when he watches a dribble of his own slick and come leak out. Gently, he catches it on his finger and pushes it back in, enraptured by how soft Tony feels here now, knowing only moments ago he had been there, nestled inside him, and even now there is evidence of his claim.
“Do that again, Buck,” Steve husked out. Bucky did, and Tony cries out again, the wet sounds of a filthy kiss right by his ear sending a shiver down his exposed nape.
It's not violence when Bruce grips Tony's hair. When the tangled curls are wrapped around his fingers tight enough to pull a few strands free as he guides his cock into the wet, open, and eager mouth currently whining in need.
“You gonna pop a knot for me, Alpha?” Steve purrs, all omega satisfaction. “Am I fucking you so good you're gonna give me that pretty knot? Huh?”
Beneath him, Tony moved, his eyes now full of worry instead of his own nerves. Calloused, capable hands covered Steve’s own as Tony reached for him.
It's not violence when Thor pushes thick finger in his used hole, the sounds soft and wet and squelching making Tony struggle to hide his face as Thor is touching the tip of his hard cock with a single finger. It's not violence when he denies Tony's attempts to hide before he lets an arc of his power connect his finger in Tony's ass to his fingers on the plump head of Tony's cock, listening as Tony screams and trusting Bucky and Steve to hold their lover while he writhes in exquisite agony. It's not violence for Thor to wrap their cocks together in one huge hand, stroking and shocking until they both tumble over into completion, coating Tony from chin to navel in pearly spend.
It feels like there's a short between Tony's brain and his nervous system. Steve's mouth is hot and open, kissing at the damage he's wrought and lapping it up with groans of ecstasy.
Inside, Tony is only lit by the blue glow of the reactor, the light revealing him to be straddling what looks like a sybian saddle. Upon closer scrutiny, it's obviously something custom made, which isn't surprising considering Tony. The lines of the object are graceful and slick, calling to mind the flow of the armor Tony fights in.
A couple weeks passed by before Steve returned to the cove. He had been quite busy with Peggy and Peter and Sandy. Peggy took him places like Knott’s Berry Farm and Disneyland while Peter insisted they play on the beach and Sandy wanted Steve to work on his art for the festival. He barely had time to see if anyone left something for him in return. Though he was grateful for all the adventures and memories, Steve still thought about the face and the boy.
Steve felt a hand on his shoulder, “Hey, Steve. It’s really been great and all but I really think I should go.”
Every day it was always Bucky or Sam or Natasha. Once they noticed the pattern, like clockwork they would find him right as he had his breakdown. They would comfort him and try to soothe him and take him upstairs to his room. But today wasn’t like every other day. This time Steve saw a flash of something in his head. A memory? A dream? A hallucination? Steve couldn’t tell, but he tried to ignore it and punch harder. The flashes kept coming until they began to play like some sort of movie. This scared Steve but he kept punching harder and harder. Steve could see himself and Tony and Thor and Bruce and Natasha and some tall man with an eyepatch. They were talking and Steve’s heart started beating fast. Suddenly, the bag broke and flew off in front of him. His paused, whatever was happening stopped. But for the first time, he remembered what he had seen. Steve stood in the middle of the gym. Frozen. He couldn’t move.
It had been weeks since the crash and Steve still couldn’t remember anything. His “friends” showed him pictures and videos, but he drew a blank. They told him about his life, his powers, his responsibility as an Avenger. The words that came out of their mouths were meaningless. At meals, Steve sat solemnly in the corner watching his friends laugh and smile. Most days Steve would either roam around the compound silently or would work out in the gym to keep in shape. Sometimes the other Avengers had missions, but Steve couldn’t join them in fear of hurting his head more. He was left alone. At those times he would put on classical music and sit near a window and just watch the clouds change shapes and lazily role by.
Everyone sat in silence, the movie continuing in the background. They had no way to comfort Tony.  They finished watching the movie. Tony cried at the end when the little boy got adopted and the movie finally came full circle.
He couldn’t help the urge to see if Tony was around or any sign that he had been. The waves had washed away any prints the boys left, but before Steve went on his run, he made sure to check to see if he still had the blurry photo of the two of them. Steve sighed a huge sigh of relief when he saw that it was still on his phone.
Steve was stopped in his tracks and the blood drained from his face. It wasn’t that he didn’t want Bucky there, it was the fact that now he also had a mermaid friend that he couldn’t tell Bucky about and the whole situation would become ten times more complicated than it already was.
“He probably does to. I promise I’ll try to talk to him. He’s been open with me lately so we’ll see what I can get.” Natasha looked at Tony with a sad smile. “I’m going to leave, but I’d suggest you watch that. I think it’ll help you feel better.”
Steve tried calling after him, but didn’t know what to say or how to get his attention. Confusion hung over Steve as he tried to decide whether he had really seen that boy or whether he was just a figment of Steve’s imagination. The phone in Steve’s pocket started buzzing and Steve saw his mom’s picture on the screen.
Steve picked up what looked like a little scroll and unrolled it. It read, “18:30, 06/16”Steve realized it was in military time and that the date was today’s date. He smiled and shoved the note into his pocket. He would finally get to meet the face.
Pepper squeezed him tighter. Tony’s close friends all knew that Tony had self esteem and self worth issues and shouldn’t be left alone with them. Tony felt so small in Pepper’s arms. There was a pit in his stomach and all he could see was Steve’s face after Tony had gotten mad.
Peter grabbed Steve’s hand and led him out of the museum claiming that it was lame. Peter took him right next door into what looked like a tourist trap mixed with an antique store. There were all items imaginable but with mermaids on them. Peggy hadn’t been kidding when she said the town really liked mermaids. Peter picked up a light blue hat with a mermaid on it and handed it to Steve.
Steve looked him up and down. Tony looked small and frightened like a mouse. His cheeks were tinged pink. Though his eyes were soft, Steve could see the red rings like Tony had been crying. Steve had a sudden impulse to comfort Tony, to wrap him up in his arms and never let go. Steve was taken aback by this sudden feeling and turned away from Tony.
played aimlessly in the background as Steve imagined what it would be like to cuddle with Tony. He had to stop himself a few times from laughing out loud thinking about cuddling with Tony while he had a tail. One thing that made him feel better was the fact that he could stare at Tony as he slept without any judgement. He conceded to studying the curves of his face, noting his
Steve moved sluggishly through the throngs of people in shorts and flip flops to the pick up area outside. He glanced at his phone to see that it was 8:45 am. He scanned the crowds a bit before seeing a short brunette with bright red lipstick and a sign with his name scribbled on it with a smiley face.
again: for his friends, when he stubbed his toe, when something didn’t work out in his favor, when there was a problem he couldn’t solve. Steve finally had gotten used to it and actually enjoyed it because it made him feel human again.
"Steve!" Tony wails, feeling come finally starting to drip down, his body no longer able to contain it all. He's still not there, though he is definitely on the way, and now Steve is fucking up into him with purpose angling him just so, fucking him just right. This is Steve on a mission.
Violence is the best his kidnappers can pray for when his lovers see Tony spit red into the head thug’s face as he smiles through tears, snot, and blood, his voice wrecked but steady as he says, “You're so dead. You're all dead, every last one of you.”
“No, no Tony, I’m not leaving you!” Steve moves towards Tony slowly, taking his hand when he gets close enough and drawing him into his arms. Tony is shaking. “That’s not what this is about.
“Fine, but you can’t expect me to play nice when he isn’t being cooperative either. He barely trusts anyone except Sam and Bucky...” The voices faded away and Steve felt sick to his stomach.
Tony sighed and picked up the bag of chocolate chip cookies and grabbed one. He took a big bite and turned to face the water again. After a few seconds of chewing, Tony scooted back over to Steve. His face was still pink with the blush.
Bucky lightly punched Steve in the arm, “To see you of course. You haven’t forgotten our deal have you?”
“What are you doing here?” Steve asked gruffly. He realized that he was feeling something even though he wasn’t punching a bag or running on a treadmill.
Steve hopped off his own swing and moved to be behind Tony. He gently placed his hands on Tony’s back and pushed him forward with all of his weight. Steve sighed to himself as he watched the adorable figure try to stay balanced as the swing flew forward and back. Tony finally gained momentum. Steve kept pushing until he thought Tony was going high enough to be independent.
Tony freezes for a second, his eyes going wide. And then he smiles, full and dazzling. He kisses Steve clumsily, his mouth still pulled into an ecstatic grin.
For a moment, he's soft and gentle, pressing kisses into the curve of Tony's neck, and then his voice goes rough once again, demanding, and he bites into Tony's shoulder before hauling him back against his chest, one hand slipping under Tony's thigh, bracing his weight like it's nothing.
As he watches, Tony cries out, another sound Steve hasn't heard, desperate and reedy. Tony leans back, his spine curving into a delicious arch as he grabs his ankles, head thrown back, long line of his throat glowing with sweat in the blue starlight from his heart. By some wordless command, the toy thrusts faster and Tony makes guttural noises deep in his chest, his cock bobbing and dribbling, crystals of delicate blue light caught in clear beads on the tip of his cock.
There's this compatibility because of which people stay with each other. No matter how much you love each other, if you can't fit into each others lives or atleast try to, it gets tiring at one point to be together. People often ignore this fact and rush headfirst into relationships.
"It's nice how you did this for Steve even when you knew that you'll have to talk about Howard if people ask.", Natasha turned around in her seat, watching Steve and Thor talk to another little kid who was probably someone's grandchild.
It was probably because he finally got to see his pal William in uniform. Steve had met the old man at the Central Park when he went for his morning runs at god-awful hours. He had talked about it over decaf with a sleepy Tony after a workshop binge.
Tony cursed as he saw the red spot beeping in the Tower structure displayed on the HUD. "Well, tell him he'll be a great dad. Don't let him fall. Love you, Pep." The call ended abruptly as he zoomed into the gut-wrenchingly dark hole counting seconds left.
Thor took off Thor-knows-where but Dr. Banner, Clint, Tony and Natasha stayed back. After a horrifyingly slow pile up in the car and the slow lulling movements of driving them back to the safehouse assigned, which drove them half-asleep, it took quite possibly what felt like a decade to reach there.
When Tony made a confused noise, Steve continued, "Martha there, asked me to have some sense and go dance with my sweetheart. I'm just hoping I accidentally know how to dance from all the time we spent trying to make my two left feet know how to." Expectant blue eyes with a glimmer of fear held Tony in his place.
He slipped away to the kitchen grinning at himself lazily as he gathered the food and carried it back to the couch, switching on a reality TV show obnoxiously loud and letting them both have their moment of peace,
"God, I love you so much.", Bucky continued as if in a haste to get it all out before he spontaneously combusted. Running his hands through her locks, he looked disbelievingly at Tony who grinned wide pointing at himself mouthing '
He could care less about being decent by dancing half a foot away so he leaned his entire tired body on Steve and let Steve direct him in gentle waves.
Tony looked back at her, eyes narrowing in an assumption that she understood, "Look, something's happening in that SHIELD-HYDRA mumbo-jumbo, something worse. I will absolutely not compromise the safety of this tower. And seeing those agents, I can bet they're on the skull-y octopus-y side of things. This will be the last time SHIELD got in here."
"Guess Rhodey gets to be the godfather in my place. Please let the little munchkin know I loved them already." He tried to get the message across calmly as he stared towards the approaching Stark Tower.
"Try Ms.Potts. Might as well.", Tony interrupted in a haste, watching Pepper's photo pop in the corner of his HUD.
And probably more seconds later, just after Tony was feeling too good over how exactly what he predicted had happened but was still afraid of Bucky's response, the aforementioned man shot up straight half-screaming as if it just hit him, "We're gonna be parents? Together?"
Steve dropped his head on Tony's shoulder, groaning and chuckling at the same time, "I won't ever drink Asgardian mead again. I don't want to know how you got that drawing."
Pepper had relaxed completely and Tony could feel that she understood. He could feel that she had let it go for now hoping this was gonna be okay. He had his fears but he believed in both of them. Had for a long time.
Steve's familiar curvy handwriting on the note with a little blotch of paint sent a wave of overwhelming love through Tony's entire being.
The tiniest burst of happiness quickly dried away as he realized that Stark was falling. "He's not slowing down.", Thor said, swinging his hammer ready to catch Stark.
"He won't be there for long, Widow. Just cover up for me when we're out for shawarma, you're good at that.", Tony responded with his back turned, toying with the bottom of the bar to open a stash of tech.
This felt like the horrifyingly calm one, slipping away. He could feel himself dusting away. Shaking. So hard that his bones rattled. He felt cold. And distant. And dead. And he could hear whispers of 'its okay' echoing through him. Increasing slowly as he fell out of himself more.
Steve pressed a kiss on Tony's forehead, digging his fingers a little deeper where they held Tony's waist absentmindedly, "Sure Tony, keep going."
"Close it.", he said weakly. "Close it.", he repeated again to assure himself, hearing a thundering noise as the blue light pulsing with power, which held the wormhole open, collapsed. In the second following, the hole started collapsing on itself. He averted his eyes knowing he couldn't watch it anymore.
The aforementioned Ms. Martin is also an original character just like the other tons of OC I'm writing up in this fic.
"I swear if you pull one of those Expo things trying to die on me-" She didn't let herself finish the sentence as she chose another way. "He's in the tower, you know. James."
A smile tugged on her face, "Oh, I want him very much alive. Tony, still. Even though he knows that he's not in their clutches anymore, he still has that massive burden of guilt he likes shouldering on his own. He is waiting for the day when someone will barge in and take him away. Those HYDRA men or the law."
"I've been sitting here for an hour, wishing you'd just look up on your own and find it. I didn't want to upset DUM-E by ruining his plan.", Steve's voice filled in.
Thor turned the suit, ripping away the mask as Steve bent to hear, desperately hoping that Stark was still breathing. Pulling away when he heard nothing, his hand slid on the armor's chest towards the blue light which had gone off. The
"Please tell me you won't abandon me after this. Or give away my godfather position to Rhodey-bear. I'll grovel all my life.", he tried joking but her shaky breaths were what broke him. His heart thudded as he gathered Pepper in his arms apologizing again and again.
But he was happy. There was a point in that day several hours ago, he felt like he had lost all of his family and he had never loved being this wrong. He felt grateful for being a part of this happiness.
Steve because god-knows that that man needed all of this more than Tony did, that was no one's business but his.
I don't think I've ever felt this satisfied after writing a chapter. This was an amazing emotional rollercoaster.
He had been radiant under the gleaming lights all night. His eyes crinkling as he smiled at the people telling him stories from back in their day. His hands holding the sentimental old souls while his words held them enamoured.
He felt far from chaotic. He had imagined what death would be like after some close calls; he had imagined it to be chaotic and all-fighting because that would be how Tony Stark would go. He had never imagined a calm death or for-fucks-sake a content death because it felt foolish to dream of it.
I can't, for the life of me, bear to romanticise mental health. There's more to life than romance. But there's not much in life if you can't bear to live in your own head.
He could hear Pepper let out small whimpers, letting her lose herself completely because she knew Bucky would take care of her without a doubt. He walked back to the mini bar getting himself a drink as the exhaustion hit him like a freight train.
Steve hummed as his eyes slipped close, their foreheads touching while they still moved under their comforting muted sways.
"Great.", Tony muttered as he stood up walking towards the counter to talk to the lady who was looking a little dazed, while whipping out his phone and tapping out god-knows-what fast. Which was more frightening since he didn't crash into anything on the way.
By now, he hoped Pepper would understand that everything she feared over was nothing. Tony hoped that he'd be enough to protect them and that kid and everyone, knowing that the buzz of paranoia would stay under his skin until he made sure he could keep them safe and the acknowledgement that he won't be sleeping properly for a long time.
His voice is shaking, but it's okay, because so is Tony's when he answers, "There's no one I would trust more. I love you so much it scares me a little."
A chuckle from behind and below him and Bucky turned Tony's head where it rested on his shoulder, metal finger tracing his jaw and tracing his lips. Tony lapped at them, soft and hot little strokes of his tongue as he tried to invite them inside. Bucky was smiling at him, full of adoration as he kissed him slow and languid, possessive and sensuous.
Steve is fast. He's superhuman, so it really goes without saying, but it doesn't change the fact that it's never been something Tony needed to calculate in the bedroom. That's why it catches him completely off-guard when, between one heartbeat and the next, he goes from leaning back in the bed against his nice comfy wedge pillow, to being draped over it in its new position, ass in the air and Steve behind him, pressing him down into the mattress with his bulk.
