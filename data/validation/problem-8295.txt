“I almost asked my father to have it torn down. I wanted to help do it too. Take it apart, stone by stone.” Steve opens the door and leads Tony inside. “But a week after everything with that bastard Rumlow and Pierce, I found myself coming here during the day.” They walk to the stairs and Steve sighs. “I'd go upstairs and sit on the bed where I’d slept for so long and then, one day, my mother found me there.”
Blinding light fills the room and when it starts to dim, both Tony and Steve gasp. They can both see the way Steve’s silvery blue strings twine together with Tony’s red and gold and they can only stare in amazement.
Tugging on Steve’s hair until he looks up, Bucky knows he needs to consider his words carefully. “While I cannot speak for Tony, if there’s one thing I do know,” He chuckles, “Tony has feelings for you, Stevie. When he’s not working on some project you are the first person he seeks out. He always wants your opinion on things and takes what you say seriously.”
The last flower Tony points at is another pink one, but different from the first. Steve steps into the grass and picks both flowers. He brings them to Tony and adds them to the daisy in his hand.
“Is this where they came from?”
"If you wanted a clue, you should have tried to make a break for it and find Clint. Natasha is sitting on him in our rooms to keep him from talking."
Tony sits up, wiggling a little in anticipation. “Okay?”
“How will he know?”
“Beg a little more, baby. Love when you beg me.”
“I’m not just saying it.” Steve reaches over the board and pulls Tony’s hands away from his face. “I’ve watched you come up with some of your greatest inventions when you were rambling. It’s,” Steve pauses, stopping himself before he tells Tony how beautiful it is to watch him. “It’s incredible to see. You know how my mother feels about lying, even little fibs, you know I’m not lying to you.”
Once he’s dressed, and given Roth enough details to share with the other servants, he goes down and finds both Bucky and Sam waiting for him. The grins he’s greeted with are all too satisfied and he rolls his eyes. Steve is thinking of changing direction and going somewhere else when Bucky appears at his side and takes his arm.
“His royal highness did seem to think that would be the case.” He looks at the cravat in his hand and decides Tony does not need it. A picnic is not a formal occasion after all.
Another thing that had been very clear when Tony arrived was that Steve did not expect any sort of favors from his harem. He wanted them to be happy and he would do whatever he could to ensure they were. When his best friend, Bucky, had formed an attachment with two people in the harem, Steve had embraced them and made sure they had their own suite for some privacy. Carol had also begun a relationship of her own with Tony’s guard, Rhodey and when they had gone to Steve to tell him, he had wished them well and let Carol move into Rhodey’s quarters.
Jarvis holds Tony by the shoulders. “I have been with you since the day you were born, sir. I have watched you grow and learn and regardless of everything you have been through, you have the kindest and most generous heart I have ever seen. When we came here, you blossomed and came into yourself and stopped hiding who you were. It is easy to be confident in you when you have proven time and again to be deserving of such confidence.”
“Thank you, Steve.” There are still flowers leftover, so Tony picks them up and begins wrapping them just like Steve had shown him. “Help me make one for you?”
Steve strokes Tony’s chest and thighs and kisses his neck. “Made for me, Tony. My Tony. My baby.”
“Yours.” Tony knows there are going to bruises along his hips and he can’t wait. “Yours. Your Tony.”
“There’s really not much to tell,” he says with a shrug, dropping his cufflinks in a little dish in the wardrobe.
Steve swoops in and kisses him, enjoying the taste of blueberry. “Had to have your favorites didn’t I?”
“Hmm? No reason.” He does a little twirl and winks at Steve. “What do you think, Charming? Do I clean up well?”
“Savory please, sir.”
“Have you ever made a flower crown?”
Tony clenches around Steve and kisses him hard. “Fuck me like you mean it, Captain.”
Natasha takes a seat next to Tony and takes his hand. “Your feelings for our prince have grown stronger. It is no longer just on the surface.”
Steve reluctantly lets himself be led to the sitting room, but he’s not truly listening to a single word Bruce and Bucky are saying. He looks over his shoulder, hoping that maybe, just maybe, whatever signal Bruce and Bucky are waiting for will happen before they get too far. When that is not the case, he takes a seat when he feels Bucky push on his shoulder and his foot bounces as he peeks up at the clock.
“Look at my boys.” Steve gets closer and smiles as Tony makes grabby hands toward him. “Come on, let me see our little insomniac.”
Last chapter! A short little epilogue and a very special gift from Tony.
As Tony moves the razor in precise strokes, his thoughts shift back to Steve. It’s not a new occurrence. His thoughts shift to Steve pretty often, but lately, those thoughts seem to be constant. He wants this to work out. Everyone keeps saying Steve has feelings for him and Tony hopes they’re right. He wants them to be right. He doesn't know what he would do if his feelings turned out to be one-sided. Steve would let him down kindly, but Tony's not sure he would be able to handle the heartbreak.
“Hmph, sure Tony.” Steve snorts. His voice is laced with sarcasm when he speaks next. “Extra challenge. I’ll still kick your ass. Even going second.”
Together, they begin planning. A key part of the plan involves Steven insisting that he be allowed to bring his own knights on the trip. Rumlow tries many times to convince him they would not need extra protection, teasing that he would be more than enough, but his objections are ignored. Steven is adamant that his men, Sir Samuel Wilson, and Sir James Bucky Barnes travel with them. When no amount of cajoling will change Steven’s mind, Rumlow is forced to acquiesce. What Rumlow does not know was that Sam and Bucky were also Steven’s closest and most trusted friends.
News spread quickly about what Tony and Clint had done and soon everyone was showing off their various scars and telling the stories of how they’d gotten them. Some stories featured battles or moments of clumsiness, and some stories were similar to Bruce’s. After those stories, everyone would gather close and offer whatever comfort they could, usually in the form of a giant cuddle pile in the main room. The biggest gesture came a few days after most stories had been told and it had come from Steve. He came to visit everyone as they were relaxing after dinner and took Bruce aside. Later that night, Bruce revealed to Tony that Steve had wanted to show Bruce his own scars and reassure him that the only way Bruce would leave the harem would be if he chose to leave. It still took some time before Bruce felt totally comfortable showing some skin but watching him walk confidently to the big pool warmed Tony’s heart.
“I love you, Tony.”
Amiyusesha, I hope you enjoyed this fic! It was a lot of fun to write and Steve and Tony were both very happy to let me know what they wanted in parts
The way Tony turns the word into a question makes Steve laugh. He plucks the flowers from his hands and begins wrapping the stems around each other to bind them together. He plucks a bloom from nearby and adds it to the crown. He lifts his head to look up at Tony and is entranced by how focused he is. He’s watching Steve with rapt attention, eyes following his hands as they wrap each stem around another to secure the crown.
“I can’t believe it’s still here. I would have thought you’d have it torn down. Why didn’t you?”
“Good, Tony. Safeword?”
“May I?” He asks, looking over his shoulder.
“Yeah.”
Clint was probably Tony’s third favorite person after Steve and Bruce. If anyone else asked, Tony would bat his eyelashes and smile as he proclaimed they were all equal after Steve.
He remembers the glimpse he’d gotten of the strings connecting them. His own had been blue with a silver glow, bright and cool. Tony’s had been a deep scarlet with a golden glow around them. They had reminded Steve of a hearth fire. Warm and inviting, providing heat and comfort to anyone who was close. That was who Tony was too. Whoever he was with always seemed to smile more when he was near and he was always doing what he could to ensure others had what they needed.
“Fifteen minutes.” Steve’s eyes sparkle and he kisses Tony’s forehead. “I’d say I’d leave our picnic lunch out here to wait for us, but-”
Taking the ring from Steve, Sarah studies it with a soft smile. “A good choice, dearest. Do you want different stones? We can take some from another piece of jewelry if you’d like.”
“It was the same for me.” Steve hugs Tony close, burying his nose in dark hair that has gotten long enough to start to curl over his ears. “I very nearly tossed you over my shoulder and brought you back to the castle then and there.”
Steve takes Tony’s mouth, hand reaching between them to wrap around his cock. “And then I’m going to fuck you. Let you think of nothing but my cock holding you open, deep inside.” He strokes Tony’s cock slowly. “Moving in and out of you until we’re both unable to take it anymore.”
“I will be paying a visit to the kitchens as soon as you leave here, sir.”
“Mhmm.” Steve grins and steps into Tony’s space. “And if I were to ask Jarvis if you’ve eaten today?”
“I’d like that.” He starts to reach for the blindfold and Tony turns away. “Sweetheart?”
The bright sound of Steve’s laughter echoes through the forge. “You’re right, I won’t.”
Margaret watched mother and child for a moment and moved to the center of the room. She’d been feeling the vision wanting to burst forth, but she had tried to hold it back, wanting to see the prince for herself first. As soon as she stopped walking, the vision refused to be held back any longer. Her head fell forward, shoulders slumping as she called her power. When her head did lift, her eyes had turned white and a slight glow emanated from her body.
Yes, the chapter count has gone up, but that's due to my own error of mis-numbering the chapters as I wrote lol
“Where what came from?”
Tony preens. “Of course you can’t! You love and adore me too much.”
Instead, he pulls away gently, and, like Steve had just moments before, he presses his lips to his knuckles. "Goodnight, my prince."
“What did Steve have to do to get you out of the forge this time?”
“Fuck.” Tony’s hips move with Steve’s strokes. “Please, sir. Please. I want it. Want your cock. Want you fucking me.”
“Jarvis, play some music. Something soft and instrumental.” Chopin comes over the speakers and Steve feels his shoulders relax. “Perfect.”
Bucky holds a hand up. “Because I convinced her that talking to her Antoshka was more important than coming up here and interrogating you about your intentions.”
He takes her hands and lets her pull him into the seat next to her. “Hello, mama. Good afternoon?”
“Hmm?” She pauses at a fresh bouquet and leans in to smell the fresh blooms. “I’m sure I have no idea what you are talking about. Perhaps, I let slip what your schedule was like for this week. And maybe I mentioned a few food pairings you enjoy, but the rest was all Anthony.”
“Thank you, mama.” He follows her to where she keeps the jewelry most precious to her and watches as she pulls out a few boxes. “I am glad you love Tony too.”
Tony rolls his eyes. “I can never say no to those puppy eyes he gives me.” He watches Bruce float over, and when he holds out his hand, Tony passes the soap over. “The guilt was also very effective.”
While things had never become romantic between them, (they kissed once and both realized it was too much like kissing family), there had been more than a few nights where Tony had crawled into Clint’s bed and Clint had crawled into Tony’s. Sometimes they just needed someone close who would put an arm around them and let them whisper their worries into the dark. They were both happy to listen and offer whatever comfort they could, and on rare occasions, they just listened and comfort came from knowing someone had heard them.
Tony’s shoulders relax and he pulls Steve’s chair out. “Good. Have a seat.” He waits for Steve to sit and then sits in his own chair. “Sorry about all the subterfuge, but I needed time to get this all set up. Did Bucky give anything away?”
Tony’s head drops. “Mean.”
One last coat of paint goes on the star at the center of Steve's shield and Tony feels his chest swell with pride. In this forge, with his own hands, he's been able to create and build. The list of his creations is long and Tony is proud of even the smallest thing. There have been arrowheads, horseshoes, nails, pipes, but this, this shield, it's different. He closes his eyes and lets himself imagine how Steve will react when he presents his courting gift. There will be astonishment and smiles and, if Tony is lucky, Steve will give him the best smile of all. The soft sweet smile that doesn't hide how touched he is. He’ll hold the shield in one hand and reach for Tony with the other. He'll pull him close and then...Tony shakes himself. It's time to think of other things.
“You have to tell me something. Give me a clue? A hint? An interpretive dance?”
70 Years Later…
“I know.”
“Haha. Please don’t guess. I’ll let Buck and Sam be responsible for spreading the gossip.” He looks out at the field where the people of his guard are sparring with one another. “You’ve got everything well in hand here. Best not to keep my mother waiting.”
Eyes wet, Tony throws his arms around Jarvis. “Thank you. I’m still so glad you came with me to this place.”
Steve pouts. "Fine." He looks up at the clock again, disappointed that neither hand seems to have moved. "If Clint is that excited, it must be good. I can be patient. I can wait."
“There’s more.” He lets go of Bucky and drags his hand down his face. “I want to hold his hand. I want to hold him. I want him at my side, asking his opinion about things going on in court. I want to share secret smiles like I’ve seen you do with Clint and Natasha. The same smiles Carol and Rhodey share when they think they’re alone. I want, oh! Buck, I want-” Steve blushes and looks away.
Margaret looked at her queen and offered a comforting smile. “Come here, darling. Hold your son. Feel how strong he is.”
When Tony hears the knock on the door, he half expects Steve to just burst into the room without waiting for Tony to say anything. When he doesn’t, Tony is confused. These are Steve's rooms, Tony really didn't think he'd wait to come in. Maybe it’s not Steve? He calls out and fidgets where he stands. There's no response and he frowns.
While Tony looks through the paintings, Steve begins setting up their picnic. He spreads out the blanket he brought in a sunny spot and frowns. Something is missing. His eyes land on the small sofa he’d brought into the room and he jogs over to it with a grin. He grabs the cushions and brings them over, creating a cozy, intimate space for them.
Steve laughs. One of his favorite things is when Tony rambles like this. He’s tempted to keep quiet and see how long he’ll keep going but, one look at Tony and his very visible nerves has him deciding against it. “Tony. It all looks wonderful.”
Tony looks at the strip of cloth and blushes. “Because it has your shield on it?”
“Stand, Tony.” Tony stands and lists to the side since one leg fell asleep. Steve stands and holds him steady. “Wake it up, sweetheart. Do we need to walk a little? Work Out the pins and needles?”
Sarah looked over at the crib where her son was sleeping peacefully. Margaret was right. They would do everything in their power to ensure Steven would be prepared for whatever danger comes his way. She would talk to Joseph, tell him about the vision and decide how to help their son become the warrior he was destined to become.
Clint and Tony bonding, or more accurately, Clint and Tony gossiping
“Spark?”
Tony takes the blueberry gently and pops it in his teeth. He moans as the tart juice hits his tongue and shuffles on his pillow. “Blueberries!”
Steve sits up and pouts. “Not little. Not anymore.”
Looking up, there are tears in Tony’s eyes. “It’s all me.”
Sarah took Steven and stroked one soft cheek with her finger. His mouth opened in a yawn and his eyes began to droop and she smiled. Whenever she or Joseph held him, he watched them intently, eyes tracking them and their mouths when they spoke. Steve was small, but the way he watched them with such intensity made Sarah believe he was strong and would grow up to follow in his father’s footsteps.
“You heard me, Stevie. And I think it’s important. Do you want to kiss him?”
The final win goes to Steve and he fights hard for it. His strategy was sound, but so was Tony’s. When he can finally declare, "checkmate," there were only a few pieces left on the board. Tony had had a pawn a square away from winning back one of his own pieces when Steve had finally managed to corner his king and get the checkmate.
Tony focuses on Steve’s cock, pretending not to hear the question.
When Steve’s adds a third finger, it’s Tony’s hips jerking and Steve grins. “So close, baby. Just a little more. You’re always so right and I love it.”
Blindfolds have been a limit for Tony for a while now, but he trusts Steve and Steve’s promised to keep the lights on and to stay close. Tony knows that all he has to do is utter the word, “newton,” and the blindfold will come off.
Tony walks them out of the forge and blinks a little in the late afternoon sun. “In fact, I think I’ll go and pay a visit to the baths.” He looks at his nails and laughs. “There’s no saving my nails, but I can try and get the rest of this soot and grease off.”
Tony moans into the kiss, hands coming up to grab at Steve. “Please, sir. I want it. I want it all.”
"I like that."
“You are beautiful.”
Grateful to find his bedclothes left out, Steve changes and splashes some water on his face. He’d hoped the cool water would shock his thoughts onto a different path, but instead, he circles right back to a slightly crooked smile and a pair of dark brown eyes that have begun appearing in his dreams.
Slowly, Tony feels Steve enter him. “Fuck. Feels so good, sir. Fill me so good.”
“You’re going to leave the forge regardless,” Steve comments, leveling a stare at Tony. “We’re going on a picnic.”
Everything fades away as Tony brings the shield forward. His entire focus is on Steve and he wouldn’t have it any other way. “Steve. My love, my prince, you do so much for all of us. You have given us more than just a home. You’ve given us safety and care and a place where we can be ourselves without fear. When I began making this for you, it was to thank you for all you do for us, but," Tony's throat feels thick and tears fill his eyes. "But as I worked the metal and it began taking shape, I realized what this really was. This was my declaration to you. A declaration that I love you and want to stand at your side for the rest of our days. I made this in the hopes that, should you ever need it, you will be protected. Just as you have always protected us all.”
Steve’s fingers move over Tony’s back and sides in soothing circles. “I think that can be arranged. You’ve got a bit of a strength kink I don’t mind indulging.”
Tony steps into the room, arms crossed over his stomach. Steve frowns. He doesn’t want Tony feeling self-conscious and insecure.
“Tones? That you?”
“They are the best moments.” Tony leans over to kiss Peter’s head. “He’s ours, Steve. Our baby. Our Peter.”
“Talk, Stevie. Tell us everything.”
“You’ll see me,” Tony promises.
“A surprise!” Tony’s feet carry him to Steve and he tries to sneak a peek. “What is it? Come on, Steve. Tell me? Please? I’ll leave the forge if you tell me.”
Closing the distance between them, he gathers Tony close. “Tony. Sweetheart. I’m going to ask you a question and there is no wrong answer. Do you want a shirt?”
A week after the celebrations had ended, the queen sent for her seer. Seemingly both aged and ageless, Margaret had also been her mother’s seer. Sarah remembered when she’d first seen the seer and how her mother had sent her away, promising her time with Margaret would come soon. Though her visions could be vague, Margaret would do what she could to offer whatever insights she was able to. She took her job very seriously and made sure to do whatever she could to help those in her care. In the past, when Sarah was being courted by princes from the surrounding kingdoms, it had been Margaret who had shined a light on a kind prince from a smaller kingdom.
“Fuck.”
“Of course it was Clint!” He pushes Steve toward the chairs set in front of the fireplace and takes a seat. “You know how close he is with Tony. Nat is sneaking down to his room as we speak.”
Completely entranced, Tony follows Steve up the stairs. Steve has always been the epitome of bravery to Tony, so he’s not surprised to find out he was brave enough to come back to the place where he’d been cursed. It’s on the tip of his tongue to ask if the bed is still up there, but he realizes how suggestive that sounds and stops himself before he does.
“What did Clint tell you?”
“How did you know about that?”
Steve brings his hand to his face, brow furrowing. There’s a little soot on it, but nothing a quick wipe down won’t fix. “What’s wrong with it?”
The silk slides over his skin and he tries not to moan. He runs a hand through his hair and takes a look in the mirror. “Breathe, Stark. Steve is going to take care of you. He always does. We can trust him and we know that.”
A healthy belch comes from Peter and Steve feels something wet and warm on his back. Tony tilts his head and tries not to laugh. “You still sure?”
Steve bites his lip and looks away. “I-”
The fact that Tony came to visit his mother for help makes Steve very happy. When the harem had first begun taking shape, the people he invited had been scared to approach the queen in fear it would be seen as overstepping. Sarah had quickly fixed that by coming to see them instead and since then, she frequently had visitors from everyone in the harem. Tony had always been one of her favorites and he had come to her for help courting Steve. It was endearing and sweet and Steve was glad Tony knew his mother not only approved of what he was doing but that she was also happy to offer her help.
Words continue spilling from Margaret’s mouth as though she did not hear Sarah’s question.
“I’m sorry,” Bucky pretends to clean out his ears. “Are you saying you’ve felt the pull since you saw him? When he was fighting with his guardian about becoming betrothed. That moment?”
“Sorry, honey bear.” It’s not a surprise there was a bet on them, Tony’s just a little disappointed he never got the chance to get in on it. “Steve started it if that helps my case at all.”
The blush on Steve’s cheeks is the clearest indicator that he’s being modest. Tony starts walking over to the easel and notices the canvases stacked behind it. There are a few blank ones waiting for paint, but most are covered in splashes of color. A tilt of the head is all it takes for Tony to start seeing what Steve has actually painted. The first painting is a landscape of the castle, the canvas behind it is a stunning depiction of the yards, and a third canvas features his forge. Getting closer, he sees a hint of what looks like the queen’s hair and reaches out to touch and stops.
Steve walks Peter to the bedroom and finds that Tony is, in fact, in bed, waiting for them. He’s dressed in one of Steve’s t-shirts and a pair of loose sweats reading on his tablet. When he sees them, he happily sets the tablet aside and reaches for his son.
“I couldn’t very well send you on your own, now could I?” Jarvis pushes Tony back and begins brushing his clothes again, trying to remove the wrinkles. “I needed to be sure the prince was going to take care of you.”
“I’m glad you see that, sir.” One last look is all Jarvis needs and he turns Tony, pointing him to the door. “You are ready, Tony. Now, go give your prince his surprise.”
“I already did.” Genuinely confused, Steve wants to know what Bucky is getting at. “I told you that. Remember?”
Releasing Tony, Steve runs a hand through his hair, cheeks red. “Yes. Chess. Gonna let me have the first choice or try and give yourself the edge by choosing first?”
“Marry you?” Tony moves closer, eyes locked on the ring. “You want to marry me?”
Steve keeps talking and it doesn’t take much more for Tony to follow him over that cliff. He comes hard over his fist and stomach, barely managing to hold back the moan begging to fall from his lips.
There’s a pause as Steve selects something and when Steve’s hand is close, Tony can smell cheese. “Open.”
“Hush, darling. Don’t wanna wake Peter.” Tony covers Steve’s mouth and arches up into his husband, already desperate for more.
“I'm not going far, dearest.” He brings Steve’s hand to his lips and winks. “I’ll be right back.”
“Lead the way then, dear prince.”
Tony takes his time showering, letting the hot water soothe sore and tight muscles. He does as he’s told and uses Steve’s shampoo and conditioner and body wash. It feels nice and he can imagine Steve under the water with him, hands roving over wet skin, whispering all sorts of praise and sweet words.
Tony opens his mouth and his hips buck as he realizes it’s Steve’s fingers. He sucks on the digits, tongue moving over them and collecting every stray bit of honey. He wants more. He wants his sir’s cock. Wants to feel the weight of it on his tongue and have Steve’s hand in his hair setting the pace. He sucks harder on Steve’s fingers, hoping he’ll get the message.
“I am not sure, your majesty. I could not see a face nor a name, but they were hungry for power and your son is a threat to that desire. Do not fret, I will help where I can. Your son will not be left knowing nothing.”
“I’m glad.” Steve moves in and takes Tony’s mouth. He licks at the seam of Tony’s mouth and when Tony opens, he sweeps inside and lets Tony experience the kiss with all his other senses.
Once they’re dressed, Clint takes Tony’s hand and gives it a squeeze. They continue chatting as they walk out of the baths and when they emerge, Clint leaves Tony at the stairs with a wink and a kiss on the cheek. Bucky and Natasha are should be waiting for him. They’d been on a scouting mission the past few days and Clint was more than a little eager to see them. Tony watches him go and finds himself hoping that he can have that someday. Hopefully with Steve.
“Good boy, Tony. Lean on me and we’ll try and keep it quick.”
Tony rolls his eyes. “Sure, sure.” His stomach growls and he laughs. “Okay, new topic. Where are you taking me for this picnic?”
Steve levels an expectant look at Bucky’s hand that is still holding his wrist. “Buck?”
“You know he still does his own thing like half the time, right?”
Steve pulls Tony close again, not quite ready to lose the feel of him. Tony’s heart sings that Steve isn’t letting go and between blinks, he’d swear he catches a glimpse of red and blue strings connecting them both.
“He never made me feel as though it was wrong for me to enjoy the flowers. Just helped me put them in some water.”
Don't worry, I have not forgotten about the shield. Epilogue will be posted on Monday and Tony will have a very special gift for his Prince Charming.
“Hmm?” Tony’s eyes wanted to close, but he blinks a few times to try and stay awake. “Dinner, probably.”
“Do you want to kiss him?”
The longer he stares into Steve's eyes, the more he wonders if he should push up on his toes and press his lips to Steve's. He starts to and then stops. There's a look in Steve's eyes that tells him he needs to wait. While they have made progress, they are not quite at that place yet. Tony wants their first kiss to be special and if it happens when Steve isn't ready, Tony knows they'll both regret it.
It takes some tugging for Steve to start walking again. The imprint of Tony’s lips on his cheek is still tingling and he feels absolutely giddy. He leads them into what looks like a small copse of trees and, just as he expected, he hears a gasp as they enter the clearing.
“What did she say?” Relieved he’d been able to ask a useful question, Tony squeezes Steve’s hand.
The question startles Tony, who had grown used to the sounds of the forge and his own thoughts. He lets out a shout, and drops the heavy file in his hand, narrowly missing his foot. When he lifts his head to see who has managed to sneak up on him, he's not surprised about who he sees. He grins and takes a step to the side to hide his work.
It has been three years since Tony accepted Steve’s offer to join his harem, and he has never been happier. Coming to the kingdom of Brooklyn was like coming home and Tony never wanted to leave.
Sarah holds Tony’s face in her hands. “Yes, Anthony, you are.”
“So, he’s okay?”
“Mhmm, sure,” Tony murmurs. When the bottle is empty, Peter pushes it away and Tony laughs. “Okay, okay. No more bottle. Looks like papa wants the honor of spit-up down his back, tonight.”
It all comes to a head a few days later when Pierce doubles his efforts to try and woo Steven to his side. When Steven once again rebuffs his suit, Pierce decides enough is enough. After Steven goes back to his rooms, he sends a few of his knights to quietly take Sam and Bucky to the dungeons. The next day he summons both Steven and Rumlow to his chambers.
Tony cleans up the remnants of their lunch and moves the basket out of the way. Steve watches him, curious what he is going to do next. When Tony begins arranging the pillows, Steve finally understands and waits for Tony to finish.
Tony blows out a breath and glares at Steve. He doesn’t understand why Steve is so okay with this. “I got you all dirty.”
“The young Lord Stark had them sent up for tonight.”
“No, they’re really not.” Steve watches Tony, overjoyed that he’s not panicking. “They’re beautiful. Red and gold suits you so well.”
He doesn’t expect to see Jarvis waiting for him when he’s done, but he’s grateful that his valet is there with a fresh set of clothes.
Tony blushes. “Thank you, Jarvis.” His hands smooth down the deep scarlet and gold of his waistcoat and he feels more confident. “I think I have everything. And Happy said they’d be sending the food up?”
“He’s fine, punk.” Bucky squeezes Steve’s wrist. “Take a breath.” Steve does as he’s told and Bucky grins. “Good. You’re just going to spend some time here with me and Bruce until we get the signal.”
Grabbing the soap made especially for him to cut through even the toughest dirt and grime, Tony begins scrubbing. It doesn't take long for his skin to make an appearance and he finds he’s especially grateful for whoever made this soap. If he didn’t have it, he’d be stuck in this tub for hours using bar after bar of soap trying to get clean. And even with all that, there would still some grease and dirt left.
“Collar first.” Steve lets his voice drop low and rumbling. “Kneel for me, Tony.”
“Don’t even think about it, Stevie. You promised.”
“I finally picked a shape!” Tony ducks under the water and rinses out the soap. “I made some good progress once I had that figured out.”
Steve snorts at the pout on Tony’s face. “You want my cock, baby? Want it in your mouth. Down your throat?”
The blindfold comes over Tony’s eyes and his whole body tenses.
On a night where Steve is dining with his mother and not the harem, Tony finds a small bouquet of daisies on his plate. He brings the daisies to his nose first, enjoying the light happy scent of them, the card under them going unnoticed. He knows they’re from Steve. There's no one else they could be from. He’d mentioned casually one day how they were his favorites, and he’s not surprised Steve remembered. Tony blushes when he catches Clint watching and sets the flowers aside to read the card. Like the note he’d slipped Steve a few days earlier, it’s light and a little silly. He's included a short accounting of his day and mentions Tony's note, saying he will be ransoming off the sketch on the back. Tony laughs and doesn't care who ends up looking at him. He'd forgotten he'd written his note on the back of one of his sketches. There is one line that resonates with him though. It’s simple, just Steve saying how he’d seen the daisies and wanted Tony to have them. It means a lot to Tony, though. It means he's in Steve's thoughts as much as Steve is in his own.
“We are?”
They’re both breathing hard and Steve is peppering Tony’s face with kisses when Peter begins to wail over the monitor. Laughing, Steve carefully pulls out. “So much for the afterglow.”
The courting begins!
“Yes, yes. But still a kiss. Especially when it's our prince. I have never seen him kiss anyone but his mother before.” She takes his arm and leads him to the wardrobe. “Now tell me what happened in your words, while I act as your valet. My hawk was too excited to give me details.”
Steve frowns. “I feel a pull with Tony. Happy?”
“Not hungry.” Tony shifts from foot to foot wanting to get to the good stuff.
“Are you okay?”
“So you say, Tony.”
“Oh, kotenok. Have you not seen how our prince looks at you? Whenever you are holed up in your forge, he gets so sad. And the longer he doesn’t see you, the more snappish he gets. Even when you argue, he comes back looking flushed and eager. He seeks you out so often, Anthony. Maybe he feels the same pull you do.”
Unable to let him continue doubting himself, Natasha leaves the window and moves into his path. “Anthony. Look at me.”
He fixes a bottle and gets it warming, eyes fixed on the microwave as the bottle turns. Peter continues wailing and Steve winces as the volume increases. “I’m coming, honey. I’m coming.”
“I can do that.” The shield is so close to being finished, so it should be a simple matter to make sure he is around more when Steve is looking for him. “Do you really think he feels the same for me, Nat?”
Steve stands and pours himself another glass of whiskey. He holds out the bottle so Bucky can see. “More?”
“I want to kiss Tony.”
“I’m happy too.” He tips his head up and smiles at Steve. “So very happy.”
“Jarvis! Please, I beg of you, no more. You and Ana are like family to me. I am glad you and Ana are still so in love, but there are things I do not need to think about.”
“Not worried about Bruce giving anything away?”
All of the jewelry is beautiful, but there is one piece that his eye keeps drifting back to. He picks up a ring that is made of golden strands made to look like vines intertwining and overlapping one another. There are small rubies dotted along the band and when Steve slips it over one of his fingers, he likes how flat it lays against his skin. He wouldn’t expect Tony to wear it while smithing, but if he chose to, it wouldn’t be too much in the way.
“Yes. Yours.” Steve snaps his hips up and Tony keens and writhes against him.
“I know, I’m just suddenly very aware that-”
Draping the burping cloth over his shoulder, Steve presses his lips to Tony’s cheeks. “You’re the best. Peter and I already agreed.”
“Oh my god.”
“Should have seen that coming,” Steve mutters.
"No! Please, Tones," Clint asks with a grimace. "I love you, but your poetry is not one of your many talents." Tony sticks his tongue out at him and Clint shrugs. “What about if you waited in a chair and just talked to him?”
“And if I have?” Steve is looking at the ground now. He hadn’t expected to make the admission, but it’s the truth. Lifting his head, he forces himself to meet Tony’s gaze. “Tony?”
Tony rubs at his eyes with the heels of his hands. It's obvious why she’s here. She has some idea what happened earlier. Clint has never been good at keeping secrets, and Tony knows he would have had to told both Bucky and Natasha the moment he saw them.
The pace Steve sets is hard and fast and all Tony can do is take it. He feels himself on the edge but he needs just a little more. He starts to reach for his cock and Steve grabs his wrist. “You know better, Tony.”
“And then?”
Glad the blindfold hides the fact that he’s rolling his eyes, Tony sucks on the tip and lets himself play a little. He uses his tongue to tease along the underside of the length in his mouth and moans when Steve’s finger breaches him.
Once he has the food spread out, he calls out, “Tony?” There’s no response, so he calls out again. “Tony!”
So sorry for not posting yesterday. Between dog sitting and babysitting, everything else just kind of fell out of my head.
“I know you do.” He kisses Tony’s cheek and brings the blindfold up. “You’re gonna get to look all you want after. Promise.”
“That he is, your highness.” Roth brushes down Steve’s jacket one last time and stands back. “You’re ready.”
“You won’t though.”
As Steve begins fucking him in earnest, Tony gets a hand on his cock and uses every trick he knows to get off. He uses his heels to urge Steve on. He’s close to the edge, and he just needs a little more to tip over.
Burying his face in Tony’s neck, Steve comes, hips jerking, legs shaking. “Tony, Tony, Tony. Fuck, I love you.” He manages to find Tony’s mouth and he smiles into the kiss. “Your turn, sweetheart. You know I love to see you.”
Could it be something as simple as dinner? Or maybe, it’s some grand declaration? Steve doesn't know that he's ready for that, but, no matter what it is, Steve knows Tony will have put a lot of thought and care into it. Steve stops midstep as another possibility makes itself known. What if Tony wants to tell him he doesn't feel the same and he wants Steve to stop courting him? Shaking his head, he rolls his shoulders back and takes a deep breath. He can’t let himself imagine it’s bad. Tony wouldn’t have given Roth this boutonniere if he was going to be telling Steve something bad.
“I’m glad.” There’s really no rush to get to their destination so Steve takes a seat amongst the flowers. “Sit with me, Tony. I want to make you something.”
“I’m ready. Get over here.”
Bruce steps forward, one hand held out. When he speaks, his voice is low and calm. “Tony is fine, Steve. We’re just a distraction so he can get everything ready.”
“Oh. My. God.”
“More information?” He waves away the bottle, his now attention fully on Steve. “Yes, I’d like that very much. Stop stalling.”
The room falls quiet and Tony smiles. “As well all know, our dear prince and I are engaged.”
Sarah scoffs. Her son has been head over heels for the young Stark since he brought him home. Their courtship began the day they met. Steven may not be aware of it, and the same goes for Anthony, but Sarah had watched the two of them and she'd known. The look on her son's face when he spoke of Anthony was the same one she'd had for his father.
It's all come down to this. Steve's surprise and our Happily Ever After (as if it could end any other way)
Hands skimming over Tony’s ribs, Steve digs his fingers in a little until he feels Tony flinch and start to giggle. “Please, sweetheart?” Tony says no again and Steve kisses him, still tickling him. “How about a hint? Just a little one?”
Unsure what Steve is up to, Tony sits and leans into him. “What’re we making?”
“Why did I do that?” Tony paces around the room, thankful he has it to himself for the moment. Hopefully, Bruce is taking a nice, long moonlit walk with Betty that will keep him from the room for a few hours.
“Yeah, you can.”
It’s just as Bucky had said and Steve’s heart feels full. “I love you so much, sweetheart. Can we try something?” Tony nods and Steve breathes deep to calm his nerves. “I want to kiss you. On the lips.”
At his door, Tony reluctantly slides his arm free of Steve’s and feels a slight tug from his chest, right over his heart. It’s a familiar feeling. One Tony has long since grown used to. When he’s with Steve, it’s barely there, but the further they’re apart, the harder, and more insistent, the tugging is.
Unsure what to say, Tony just tightens his hold. Steve means so much to him and even the slightest inkling that Steve could feel the same fills Tony with warmth. He also feels something that he thinks could be love, but he's not sure he's ready to declare it so just yet.
“Yes,” Steve says with a roll of his eyes.
Bruce strips off his shirt without hesitation as he walks toward the big pool and Tony wants to cheer. One of the very first things Tony had learned about his roommate was that he didn’t like baring skin in front of anyone. Since Tony had a tendency to say whatever thought popped into his head, he’d asked Bruce why. Bruce had been taken aback at first, but it was clear to him that Tony wasn’t trying to make fun of him or be rude, he genuinely wanted to know. Bruce confessed that he had been worried that the scars he’d gotten from his father would put people off. He knew Steve wouldn’t send him away, but the idea of the others being disgusted by what they saw had been a little too much to deal with. It had been Tony and Clint, another harem member, who had taken it upon themselves to show off their own scars so that Bruce could start feeling a little more comfortable.
“What am I going to do?” Bucky motions for Steve to go on, thinking he already has an idea. Instead, Steve feels his mind empty of any and all thoughts. “What am I going to do? Oh my god, Buck, what am I going to do? I’ve never done this before? How do I tell him?”
She crosses the room to her son and rests a hand on his shoulder, squeezing gently. They both watch as Tony pulls the shield out and brings it over. Steve gets a look at what Tony is holding and he looks away from Tony to his mother and then back again.
“Yes, Steve.” Tony’s whole body feels taut and ready for whatever order comes out of Steve’s mouth next.
Coulson, who had been standing with him, smirks. “Do I dare guess what the queen wants to talk about? Or is it too easy?”
When he leaves the pool, he stops at a cabinet to get a towel and choose a different soap. This one is gentler and is scented. Tony brings the bar of soap to his nose and catches the scent of bergamot and jasmine. It reminds him of his mother and Jarvis and Ana in the kitchens making tea. He brings it with him to the large pool and finds Bruce seated on a ledge, leaning against the wall, the hot water lapping at his chest. His eyes are closed, and he’s smiling as Clint tells him about his day. Tony waves to Clint and steps into the warm water with a happy sigh. Once Tony gets settled, Clint moves toward him, the corners of his mouth curving up in a sly grin.
Tony pulls away and takes the note from his pocket. He hands it over, knowing Rhodey won’t read it, and smiles. “Thanks.”
“I’m glad you’re happy here.” Steve suddenly feels the need to touch Tony. He’s so close and it would be so easy to reach out and pull him into his arms and not let go. Instead, he clenches his fists at his sides and clears his throat. “Since you’ve quenched it, does that mean we will actually see you at dinner tonight?”
“I do as well, little one.”
It takes some effort, but Tony manages to leave Steve’s arms and race to the baths. He gets as clean as he can, rushing just a little and scrubbing as hard as he can until some skin becomes visible. Some spots are going to require a longer soak, but by the time he’s done, he feels as though he could touch Steve again, and not ruin his clothes or mark him with soot and grease.
Steve pauses and kisses his neck. “Breathe with me. In for five. And then out.” Tony’s breathing settles and Steve ties the blindfold. “Good, baby. So good for me. I won’t be far from you. You’ll always be able to reach out and touch.”
Steve's turn to get ready.
“What are you doing here?”
I know I keep adding more tags, but I keep remembering things I'd forgotten to add when I first posted.
“Would have loved to have seen Obie’s face if you had.”
Tony nods and leans in, but stopping just short of kissing Steve. Steve grins, knowing Tony wants these kisses to be in his control to start. He pulls Tony closer until they’re pressed together from chest to hips and tries his best to suppress a groan. He'd never thought having someone this close would make him feel as much as this does. He's excited and nervous, yet he's also eager and ready to kiss Tony again and again. Their second kiss is slower and they both enjoy just sinking into it. They take their time mapping each other’s mouths, learning the shape and taste of one another.
When Steve’s birthday arrives, it is filled with celebrations. The kingdom itself feasts and hosts party after party in the streets. The air is full of cheers and toasts to their prince. Everyone wishing him and his betrothed good health. In every street, the air is heavy with the scents of cooking food. Shopkeepers and show off their wares and bakers and butchers hand out treats to anyone and everyone that walks by. Wanting a glimpse of the various parties, Tony and Steve sneak into town to enjoy some of the feasts. Their pockets are full of pockets and candies to hand out to their people, eager to join in the fun and spread a little joy themselves.
“Of course he did.” Steve is touched by the gesture and just barely manages to keep from reaching up and touching the delicate petals. “He is thoughtful like that.”
He's trying to think of ways to try and get Bucky and Bruce to give him something when the clock begins to chime the hour. He's hopeful that is the signal, but when neither Bruce nor Bucky move, he sinks back into the cushions. It's not a minute later when the door opens, admitting Jarvis.
“Sorry, sir. Sorry.” He tries to meet Steve’s thrusts and he turns his face into Steve’s neck. “Please, sir. Please let me touch. Wanna come. Please.”
“Always, Steve.”
“Are you about to ask me what I think you’re about to ask me?”
Tony watches where the knight ends up and brings a finger to his lips, tapping gently. It’s a rare occurrence he gets a plan past Steve and tonight is a night where Steve is on to him quickly. His whole body floods with happiness knowing the cookies were well received. He’d agonized for a while trying to figure out what he wanted to give, but kept coming back to the cookies and knew that it was fruitless to keep arguing with himself.
When the apple touches Tony’s lips, he feels something drip down his chin. The texture tells him it’s honey and he can’t help but grin. “Honey. I like it. Gonna clean me up, sir? Hopefully with your tongue?”
Cheeks flaring hot, Tony looks down at the floor. “Jarvis!”
“Will I see you tomorrow, Tony?”
“First, you take a deep breath.” Once Steve has done that, Bucky pushes him into a chair. “Good. Now, I think you should court him. Make your intentions known. Give him little gifts to show you’re thinking of him. Bring him a treat when he’s working in the forge. Those sorts of things.”
“Not sure yet.” Bruce looks down at the water and then back at Tony. “You’ve got quite the ring around you.”
A gentle tug on Tony’s hand is all it takes for him to move closer and Steve lets go so he can wrap his arms around him. Tony burrows into his embrace, his own arms going around Steve’s waist.
Steve had been in the kitchen preparing a platter of food to feed Tony when he hears the water stop. He bounces a little on the balls of his feet and brings the food into the living room to wait for Tony.
“I have been too, Tony.” He takes Tony’s hand in his own and brings it to his lips. “It’s all felt so right. I was nervous at first, but I care for you, Tony. Deeply.”
Now, Tony, is the one laughing. He moves even closer to Steve and pokes him in the stomach, enjoying the way Steve flinches. “You could.” He swipes at the sweat on his forehead, grimacing because he knows he just left a streak of soot. “But you won’t.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Very good, baby.”
“To us. And this wonderful dinner.”
He’s almost at the door when he turns back around and runs to Jarvis. He wraps his arms around the older man and hugs him tight. “Thank you, Jarvis.”
Bruce chuckles. “Probably a good idea.”
“Steve? Are you alright?”
All the feelings Steve has for Tony are threatening to bubble up and he has to bite his tongue to keep them from spilling out. Ever since the night of Tony’s surprise dinner, Steve has wanted to get on one knee and propose. If he hadn’t needed to wait for the ring to be sized, he probably would have proposed sooner, but the moment he’d seen the ring, he knew the moment needed to be special. Having to wait had also allowed him time to consider just how he wanted to propose. With Bucky's help, they'd come up with a plan and Steve couldn't wait to see it all come to fruition.
Tony lets himself be moved as Steve wants and tries to thrust into his fist. “Wanna come with you.”
“No! Nothing wrong. Promise. Just want to do this.” He stands on his toes and kisses Steve on the cheek. “Okay, we can go now.”
“You do?”
Steve drops his hand, but he can’t help but look at the spot again and finds himself curious what it would be like if his lips were to brush over that same spot. Would Tony like it? Would he blush? Was he ticklish elsewhere? Once his mind starts down that path, it can’t help but continue further. To other things. Things Steve doesn’t usually think about. Things like Tony in his bed with little to nothing on. Things like what it would be like to be inside Tony, their eyes locked together, Tony’s legs around his waist as he begs for more. Things he’s never thought about with anyone, not even Rumlow.
Once he's changed, he enacts his next plan. It took some time, and many meetings, for Tony to come up with a plan that would enable him to sneak the shield into the great hall, and tonight it is being put to the test. Bucky, Clint, and Sam are the key to making sure it all goes off without a hitch. They each take turns distracting Steve and keeping his attention on them. Their goal is to keep him away from Tony just long enough so he can hide the shield with the queen. Just as Tony hoped, the only thing Steve manages to see is his mother kissing Tony on the cheek after she tucks the shield behind her chair.
Steve brings his hand up to his face and studies his knuckles again. They are littered with little nicks and scars and there is still no physical mark from Tony’s lips. Steve still feels it anyway. They had been slightly dry and chapped from being out in the forge for days at a time, but still plush and pink when Tony pulled away.
Steven refuses to be used and ducks away from Pierce, ready to fight. Thankfully, while Steven kept Pierce talking, both Sam and Bucky had been able to free themselves from the dungeons. A few words from the servants let them know where Steven was and they rushed to join the fray. They engage Rumlow and Steven advances on Pierce. Anger fuels his every step and when he gets Pierce into a corner, he is determined to end this once and for all.
Dressed in just a pair of comfortable trousers, he finds a mirror and a razor to clean up his goatee. He’d tried the full beard once and hated how itchy it was. He’d also hated how long it took to go from patchy to actually covering his face. Rhodey had been the one to suggest just a goatee and it had been Tony’s own imagination that had pushed him to try different designs and styles. After some laughs from his friends and even Steve, he managed to settle on a style he liked and wasn't too difficult to clean up when needed.
“Is this a special dinner, your highness?” Tony is grinning when he asks, tongue darting out to lick his lips.
Caught in the honeyed gold of Tony’s gaze, Steve has a hard time turning away. He runs a hand through his hair and tries to get himself back under control. He really has missed Tony. Since the beginning, he’s tried to sit next to a different person at dinner each night, but lately, he’s found himself drifting to the chair next to Tony more and more often. Usually, when Tony is engrossed in a project, Steve will sit with the others and talk to them, but this past week it’s been harder than usual. He frequently found himself listening for the sound of Tony’s voice more than once.
“Yes. Yes, sir.”
Steve holds out his free hand and waits for Tony to take it. Steve only gets a moment to enjoy holding Tony’s hand, though. Before he can start leading him out of the forge, Tony pulls away, eyes wide, face pale.
An eye roll is the only response Tony gets and Rhodey gives him a quick hug. “I am happy for you, Tones.”
While Pierce continues spilling his guts, Steven edges closer, hand moving slowly for the dagger hidden in his sleeve. Unfortunately, Pierce is paying closer attention than Steven realized and before he can pull his dagger, Pierce has a blade at his throat. In his free hand, he holds a small vial and there is a darkness in his eyes when he tells Steven that all it will take is a swallow and Steven will just be a pretty, empty-headed doll for him to play with.
“Please, sir. I need to come. Pl-”
Reaching between them, Steve gets a hand on Tony’s cock and strokes him in time with his thrusts. “Too long. Shit, sweetheart, I’m close.”
Tony tries to keep a straight face, but can’t help the giggles that escape. “Of course. It was only logical.”
“You’re definitely the better choice.” Before he sits, he finds another glass and pours some more whiskey. “I trust that woman with my life, but when she’s feeling protective, she terrifies me.”
Moving back into Steve’s lap, Tony spreads out over him. “I trust you, Steve. With everything. You show me over and over how you take care of me and I was happy to do this with you.”
“It was the best day. I’ve been very happy here.” Tony scuffs his toe against the dirt and lifts his head to look Steve in the eye. “Happier than I’ve ever been.”
Feeling impatient, Steve holds Tony’s hips and he pulls him down until he’s fully sheathed inside him.
Unimpressed, Tony rolls his eyes. “You’re not funny.”
After a few minutes, he's still nervous but feels more settled. Tony finishes dressing and leaves the baths. He goes straight to his room and, after a quick search, finds his chess set and sets it on the bed while he calls for Jarvis.
He hears Steve laugh and then there’s the sting of Steve’s hand coming down on his skin again. “I asked you a question, Tony.”
When they stand, Tony goes to give Steve a playful shove and ends up tripping over his own feet. Steve lurches forward and catches him, tucking him into his side and holding him close.
As he waits for Steve, Tony’s thoughts, as usual, wander back to his forge. Instead of the long list of projects he tends to think about, he can only focus on one. Steve’s shield is so close to being finished. He has each piece ready now, and all he has to do now is put them together and add some paint. Steve’s colors are always well-stocked, so that part should not be too difficult as long as Tony doesn't take too long choosing the design. Before his thoughts can wander too far down the path of shield design, he hears the familiar sound of Steve’s boots on the stairs. Tony starts to turn, but freezes and refuses to move. If he continues facing forward, he can pretend that it’s not that big of a deal that he can recognize the sound of Steve’s boots.
The kingdom celebrates its awakening with almost a week’s worth of festivities. When things begin to settle, Rumlow goes to the king and queen and asks if he can bring Steven to his liege in order to gain approval for their marriage. The queen is hesitant, but her son smiles and bats his eyelashes at his knight, seemingly in love with Rumlow now, so she gives her consent, her husband following her lead.
The rustling near him lets Tony know Steve is sitting up. He can hear a tray moving on the coffee table and his mouth waters at the thought of food. “Sweet or savory?”
Kneeling in front of Tony, Steve locks eyes with Tony. “My beautiful baby. You’re doing so well. It’s going to be an easy night. Gonna feed you some treats. Let you suck my cock.” He leans in and takes Tony’s mouth in a fierce kiss. “And if you’re real good, I’ll fuck you.”
“Deal.”
He begins massaging Tony’s prostate, not letting up until Tony begins fucking himself on his fingers.
A knock at the door pulls him from the fantasy and he finally gets out of bed. Opening the door, he knows he shouldn’t be surprised to see Bucky standing there, but somehow he is.
Fingers fumbling on the pawn he was reaching for, Tony feels his cheeks heat. He manages to get it to the square he was moving it to and drops his head into his hands. “You’re not just saying that, right? Even Bruce can only take so much.”
“It’s the same for me, sweetheart. I’ve never wanted like I do when I’m with you.”
It’s easy to picture and Steve laughs. “That’s not a surprise. Go down to breakfast. I’ll get dressed and meet you. I promise you will get all the details as soon as I’m down. Deal?”
“Hey, there, Petey Pie. Look what papa’s got for you.” Steve holds the bottle over Peter and the big brown eyes Steve loves, open and focus on him. Peter takes a few gasping breaths and reaches tiny arms toward his papa. Steve knows he could also be reaching for the bottle, but he chooses to believe his son wants him more.
“I don’t mind the grease,” Steve teases. If he were honest with himself, he’d admit just how true those words are. He loves seeing Tony in his element. When he’s covered in grease and grime, forge glowing behind him, Tony is incandescent. “So long as you’re sitting next to me at dinnertime, I’ll be happy.”
Tony loves what they have. He never doubts that Steve is in charge, and he likes it that way. He likes having these times where all he has to focus on are Steve’s orders and pleasing him.
Steve laughs from above him. “Use that tongue, sweetheart. You know what I like. I wanna get a finger in you, first.”
“Talk as you eat. I know how much food Tony had brought up. You cannot be that starved, and I will not have Clint come prancing out with that grin he gets when he knows something I don’t.”
“Yes! Alright? I almost dropped to my knees when I first felt it. I swear I think I saw it too. Strands that glowed gold and red connecting me to Tony. It eased when I took Tony’s hand and made him the offer, but lately,” He rubs at his chest. “Lately, whenever I’m not with him, there’s this constant ache. When I went to see him in his forge, it was like I could breathe again. And then he smiled and it was like the sun came out.”
Tony tries to ignore the way he is blushing from Steve’s kiss, but he knows it’s useless. He’ll be blushing all through his bath and will probably keep his blush until they meet up again. Damn Steve for being so sweet to him.
The hot water does a lot to soothe the soreness Tony is feeling in his arms. While he was working, he didn't notice how tense and sore they were, but now that he's stopped, he can feel the way his muscles are aching. He leans against Clint and lets out a sigh of relief. Tucked away in the smithy, he’d let himself focus on nothing but his project. Now that he’s here with his friends, though, he realizes how much he craves their company.
Cheers erupt throughout the room with Clint being one of the most vocal in his support. Tony laughs, heart full at how much everyone is happy for them.
“Not with Rumlow, no.”
Lifting his head, he looks at Steve and waits for him to get comfortable before resting his head on his shoulder. He keeps his attention on Peter and strokes his cheek with one finger, marveling at how velvety soft his skin always is.
Tony yelps st the sting from Steve’s smack. “Yes, sir. Hand in my hair?”
“Oh.” The word falls from Tony’s mouth and he fidgets more. “I…I want that. I’ll be good, sir.”
“I do.” She stands and holds her hand out for Tony. “Now, let me finish acting as your valet. I know you won’t sleep, but you should at least be comfortable.”
“Hand it over.”
“You really can’t, but I’m glad you think so.” Getting his fingers under Tony’s chin, Steve tips his face up and presses a gentle kiss to his lips. “I want you to go and shower for me. Nice and thorough. And since I’m feelin’ a little possessive, use my things. Want you smellin’ like me. I’m going to set out what I want you to wear and then you will come and find me in the living room. Got it?”
“Okay.”
“Preachin’ to the choir, Stevie.” The whiskey is smooth as Bucky swallows and it warms him through. “She’s always had a soft spot for Tony too. I thought it was because he and Clint were so close, but she just scoffed when I suggested it.” He takes another sip and frowns. “Didn’t even tell me the real reason.”
Tony giggles. “You did. What’s next?”
Rumlow escorts Steven to Pierce and once the doors close, Pierce stalks toward Steven. The look in his eyes makes it clear he believes he will still be able to accomplish his goals. He promises Steven everything he can think of from power to wealth and Steven is disgusted. He pulls his hand free, and states, once again that he is devoted to the one who woke him from his slumber, batting his eyelashes and acting as though he is in love. Pierce just laughs and begins revealing everything about Steven’s true love.
Steve holds Tony in place and grinds up into him. “You need to come, huh?” He traces the length of Tony’s cock with a finger. “Who said you get to decide what you need? I think I get to do that, don’t you?”
Tony removes his waistcoat himself and flops back on his bed. “The truth is that I was an idiot. Steve walked me back to my room after dinner and I took his hand and kissed it. I don’t know what came over me, Nat! I can usually keep my feelings in check! But lately,” he sits up and rubs at his chest.
Bucky smiles. “There’s more, isn't there?”
He tries not to rush through his bath, but he still ends up scrubbing as fast as he can. Feeling clean enough, he hurries to his rooms to dress. His valet is patient as always. Like Jarvis, Roth knows his employer well. When Steve begins to fidget, he smiles and does what he can to hide the wrinkles that crop up. He leaves the prince for a moment to fetch the boutonniere and does his best not to laugh when the prince's eyes go wide when he sees the daisies.
Giggles bubble out from Tony's lips and he feels absolutely giddy. He points at the top of his head again. “Just right here. Real quick.”
Leaning back in the tub, Steve twirls Tony’s note in his hands, trying his hardest to keep it from getting wet. It’s not like Tony's other notes. This one is short and cryptic and Steve finds himself very curious about what is going to happen when he follows Tony's instructions and goes down to the harem's quarters. Even though he has the note memorized, Steve reads it again. Three lines. That’s all Tony wrote. The card is also remarkably bereft of Tony’s usual doodles and sketches and Steve finds he misses them.
“Steve kissed me today.”
Happy it's an easy question to answer, Tony tells Steve most of what transpired in the baths. He makes sure to leave out any talk of kisses or courting, focusing more on Clint and Bruce. He starts rambling about the arrows he wants to work on for Clint when he feels his arm sliding through Steve’s.
Steve moves the shield around, amazed at how light it is. He looks into Tony’s eyes and holds out his hand. Tony takes it and gasps when he finds himself pulled into Steve’s chest. Steve lifts the shield and is delighted to find that it's big enough to cover them both and give them a semblance of privacy. Before he says a word, Steve kisses Tony. He pours everything he feels into the kiss and he knows Tony understands when he kisses back just as fiercely.
“I’ve really enjoyed these past few weeks.”
Biding his time, the prince continues acting as though he is unaware of Rumlow’s act. When they arrive, he plays innocent and naive, looking around with wide eyes and remarking on the splendor. Rumlow is satisfied that his act is still working and wastes no time bringing Steven straight to the king.
“You’re right, I won’t.” Tony opens his hand and laughs at the frown on Steve’s face when the white piece is revealed. “Aw, don’t pout. Just think of the extra challenge.”
Muttering to himself about putting a bell on Steve, Tony drapes a cloth over his project and shoos him away from the table. “No.”
“Good point. You want to go clean up while I start a bottle and collect our son?” Steve can’t help but smile as he says those words. The past couple of months have been a bit rough since Peter hasn’t been sleeping, but Steve wouldn’t give up that little boy for the world.
Ducking out from under Bucky’s arm, Steve takes a large swallow of his whiskey and sets the glass aside. He knows there’s no getting away from Bucky’s questions. His best friend is nothing if not persistent when he wants to know something and if Steve doesn’t answer him, he’ll rope Sam into the questioning as well and Steve will never get any peace.
“You’re wonderful, sweetheart. I know you were nervous about using a blindfold, but you’ve done so well. I love having your trust in this.”
“I’m perfect, sweetheart.” He reaches into the basket and pulls out the box. “There’s actually something I want to ask you.”
He ducks into the room and closes the door before Steve can stop him or say a single word. He slides down against the door until he's sitting and forces himself to take a few deep breaths. Did he actually just do that? He kissed Steve’s hand. No one’s ever done that.
Tony takes Steve’s hand and stands. Before they start walking, he says, “Steve. Wait.”
“We are. But that’s not the surprise.”
And Tony and Jarvis have a moment.
Peter rubs his face on the burping cloth and Steve begins patting his back. “I know, Petey. Don’t worry, those nasty gas bubbles will be gone soon.” He looks over at Tony and smiles. “Pretty sure the burping cloth will protect my back.”
Nerves make Tony fidget even more and he spreads his arms out toward the food. “A gesture? Bigger than what I’ve done this week, but I thought it could be a bit of a beginning? I didn’t actually cook, promise. Happy did all of that. Only kicked me out of the kitchen once.” One of Steve's eyebrows goes up and Tony laughs. “Okay, okay, it was twice.” Steve continues to stare and Tony rolls his eyes. "Fine, it was three times. I wanted it all to be perfect."
“Are you sure you know? Or are you just sayin’ you know?”
“Chess?”
He watches with bated breath as the door finally opens. When he catches sight of a bright smile and golden hair, he is finally able to relax a little.
“Yeah, I mean, yes. I’m fine, Charming. Just tickled a little is all.”
Tony lets go of the dish and watches as Steve serves them both. Steve's hands are steady as he serves and Tony swallows hard. It’s when Steve isn’t acting like a prince that Tony is reminded that Steve is, in fact, the prince. Other royals would expect to be served, but Steve has always believed that if he expects to be served, he must also do what he can to serve his people. Once their plates are filled, Steve pours them each a glass of wine and raises his glass.
Tony scrapes his teeth over Steve’s fingers before going over the spot with his tongue. Steve chuckles and backs off Tony’s cock.
“It’s okay, Stevie. Breathe. With me.” Steve’s breathing slows even further, but he’s still trembling. “In and out, Stevie. I know it’s scary. You’ve never wanted that with anyone before. Of course, it’s making you nervous. You know Tony would never push you, though, right? You could take it slow with each other and he wouldn’t make fun or make you feel bad.”
“I’ve been really happy lately, Steve.”
Tony traces Steve’s lips with his finger, marveling at how swollen and red they are. “Are your lips tingling too?”
They get the board set up and Tony makes his first move. The game starts slowly, with both Tony and Steve watching each other to try and make out what strategy the other is going for. Tony always tries to make his choices seem random and without thinking, hoping to keep Steve guessing. He has a strategy, but he hopes Steve doesn't pick up on it until it's too late. Steve, on the other hand, is much more controlled and focused. He watches every move Tony makes and chooses his strategy from there.
“This one.”
Steven knew what was coming. During the night, Sam’s falcon, Redwing, had come to his window with a message letting him know they were being taken to the dungeons. Steven was a little happy things were finally progressing, and he knew it wouldn’t take long for Sam and Bucky to free themselves. The whole time they’d been here, they’d been making friends with everyone who worked in the castle. They were all happy to do whatever they could to help. Pierce was a cruel and unjust king who let his knights do whatever they wanted without consequences.
“Hey, sweetheart. Thank you for coming up when I asked.” He holds his hand out to Tony and waits. Tony doesn’t have to take it, but when he does, Steve smiles and reels him in.
With everything in its place, Tony peeks outside and does a happy dance. He’s managed to finish early, and if he hurries, he will have plenty of time to really scrub at his skin and try and make himself look nice. Leaving the forge, he notices Rhodey up ahead and jogs to catch up with him. "Rhodey!"
What Tony wants is to swallow Steve’s cock, but his leg is headed toward the painful kind of asleep so he nods. “I’d like that, sir.”
When the offer did come, Tony didn’t hesitate to accept. He took the prince’s hand and brought it to his lips. He's not sure why he did it, but it felt like the right thing at the time. He tried to remember everything he'd been taught about speaking with royalty, but as he tripped over his words, he did manage to get out that it would be the greatest honor to join the harem. If he also felt a slight pull from his chest whenever the prince was near, he decided not to mention it, believing it was just the excitement of what was happening.
As soon as they were feeling calmer, Joseph summoned every doctor, healer, and wizard he could find to make sure his wife and child stayed healthy. Of everyone he summoned, only one, a wizard named Zola, was sent away after he made the queen uncomfortable. Even with all of that, it had all still culminated in a difficult birth. But, when her precious Steven had been laid on her chest, Sarah had wept tears of joy, amazed at the tiny being in her arms. She didn’t care that he was small and sickly. All that concerned her was that he was here and she would make sure to give him everything he needed.
A sound at the door pulls him from the memory and he goes to open it. He has an idea who it might be and is surprised he didn't show up sooner. Just as he expected, Bucky is waiting on the other side with a knowing smile on his face. Steve stares at him and tilts his head. “What’s that look about?”
The whole kingdom was invited to come and share in the joy of the prince’s long-awaited birth. The queen smiled beautifully as her people came and wished her newborn son well. She accepted their gifts and kind words, heart swelling as her people welcomed their prince with open arms.
“One more time? I seem to be having a hard time hearing you.”
“I think I can manage that.”
A blush spreads over Steve’s cheeks. “Alright, alright. Your little one.”
Steve looks at himself in the mirror and twists and turns to get a good look. The waistcoat Roth picked out is a beautiful sapphire with a little light embroidery done in shimmering threads. He looks good and he hopes Tony thinks so as well. “I'm ready.”
Once the shock wears off at the suggestion, Tony burrows as close as he can to Steve. With his head on Steve’s chest, Tony can hear the strong, steady beat of his heart and he already feels at ease. “You have the best ideas, charming.”
Steve gets a hand on the nape of Tony’s neck and pulls him close. His fingers brush the ends of Tony's hair and he takes a deep breath. Closing the final distance between them, Steve keeps this initial press of their lips soft. It's mostly chaste, just a barely-there kiss. It's perfect and yet, Steve knows he wants more.
“And you’ve done that, Stevie. I still remember how cagey Clint was when you first brought him here. He was constantly jumping at shadows and he told me it took weeks before he stopped worrying someone would come and toss him in a cell. We all remember how Bruce flinched at loud noises, and even Tony tried to figure out what would make him useful enough so he wouldn’t be asked to leave. Remember how Carol thought she had to sneak into guard training?”
When the flower crown settles on Steve’s head, he can’t stop smiling. He’d enjoyed helping Tony make it, his fingers moving with Tony’s as they twined the flower stems together. The first time Tony did it on his own, he gleefully showed Steve and did a delighted little shimmy. Their words flowed easily as they worked, and Steve told Tony how his favorite flowers were sunflowers because when he was young his father had brought a bouquet for his mother, but also had a smaller one for him too.
“Yeah, it was.” He still inside Tony and it feels good. Steve knows Tony will get sensitive soon, so he’s gonna take what he can. “You’re so amazing, Tony.”
Tony squirms and Steve eases him off his lap. He doesn’t go far, just curls into Steve’s side. “We’re doing this again, yes?”
Steve’s hand moves up and down Tony’s back. “But you can’t help but worry?”
“I’d love to.”
A doctor is sent for and after a few, very tense hours, Steven and Sam are informed that Bucky will live, but his arm cannot be saved. Pierce's blade had been poisoned and in order to save Bucky, they have to take his arm and the source of the poison. Once the procedure is over, they take over Pierce’s suite of rooms, placing Bucky on the indulgently large bed to recover. While they watch to see if he develops a fever, Steven writes a letter to his parents apprising them of what happened. Sam sends the letter home with his falcon, Redwing, and as soon as Bucky is well enough, they travel home.
Steve grins and licks Tony’s palm as he angles his hips so his cock drags over Tony’s prostate.
Sword raised, Steven prepares to end this once and for all. The icy blue of Pierce’s eyes bore into his own and Steven falters for just a moment. The moment is all Pierce needs. He pulls a sword from behind his throne and lunges at Steven. Bucky gets there first and it’s like time speeds up. Before Steven even realizes what’s going on, his sword is through Pierce's heart and Bucky is on the ground with Sam at his side.
“What are you going to do?”
That question is one Steve has asked himself more times than he can count, even as recently as a few months ago. For the most part, he’s moved on from the curse and Rumlow's betrayal, but the dreams still come sometimes.  They always put him right back in Pierce’s throne room and all Steve can do is watch him smirk and boast about how easy it was to fool Steve. The dreams have come less and less since he and Tony had begun courting.
“I do not see how the prince will be able to deny you, young sir.” Jarvis brings a brush over Tony’s jacket, removing any lingering lint. “I have been with you a long time, sir. I know how much you care for the prince and I have seen how much he cares for you. You will spend an enjoyable evening together. And I am confident the prince will turn away from you when you tell him how you feel.”
“Now, it is my turn to give my own engagement present.”
Steve kisses him on the cheek. “Pick me some flowers? Just pick whatever you like. I always like it when there's a variety.”
Steve’s fingers trace designs over Tony’s back. “I think that can be arranged. Thank you for answering honestly. I’m proud of you. Ready to begin?”
It never fails to astound Tony how Steve seems to notice when he’s in his own head. No one has ever been able to catch Tony lost in his thoughts better than Steve. And instead of being angry or annoyed, he’s always curious to know what path Tony’s thoughts have taken.
Everyone knew about the royal harem. As Prince Steven selected more people, stories spread across the land about how much thought went into every choice and how well they were treated. There were a few who rejected the offer, and Steven took it in stride. From the beginning, he made sure it was clear that there was no obligation to accept. He held no grudges and if there came a time that they needed help, he would be there.
Things like how Steve will be able to carry this shield proudly should he ever need to take it into battle. Things like how he will breathe easier knowing his prince, his love, is protected by something he, himself has put his blood, sweat, and tears into. Steve will wield the shield with grace and power and use it to protect himself and others. He’ll come home with it on his arm and Tony will be waiting for him. They'll run to each other Steve will let Tony look him over for injuries, kissing him all over before asking Steve to take them somewhere more private. Realizing his thoughts have once again begun to wander where they shouldn't, Tony takes a deep breath and looks down at the shield again.
“I remember that last time Rhodey came to fetch you.” Clint gets out of the bath before Tony can make a grab for him. “Didn’t that end with you over his shoulder?”
The Brooklyn is seeping into Steve’s voice and Tony feels his body heat. “Simple? I can do simple.”
“What’s that?”
“I remember. She chopped her hair off and borrowed some clothes from the laundry.” Eyes closed, Steve can still remember the shock on her face when she saw Steve was sparring with his men. “She was ready to bolt before you tossed her a staff and told her to face off with you.”
“For you.”
“Still with me, Steve? Seems like we’re both a little out of sorts, tonight.” The words are soft, caring and Tony tips his head up to get a good look at Steve. He’s never seen such a far-off look on his face. “Should we take a moment for ourselves before we enter?”
“Something wrong?”
“How come?” Tony nuzzles into Steve’s neck, pressing a quick kiss to the soft skin under his jaw.
“I care for you too, Steve. So much.”
“No!” Clint is almost beside himself. Steve had never withheld affection from any of them, but what he gave was always more in the realm of encouraging words, or hugs and cuddles. Never kisses. “He’ll give us a hug or let us sleep on him, but he’s never kissed any of us. What kind of head kiss?”
“Good. I’m glad. Gonna let me take you to bed for cuddles, now?”
Natasha smiles. “That our prince kissed you.”
“Not that long. Barely an hour.” Sarah starts another row and says, “21 years. That’s how long I’ll have with my son. Who would want to curse a child, though?”
Tony takes a few deep breaths. “Are you sure?”
Steve chuckles and pushes away from the post he’d been leaning on. He walks deeper into the forge, the heat from the coals turning his cheeks red. “Lots and lots of practice.” His eyes flick over to the beaten circle of metal on the table. “You gonna tell me what you’re makin’?”
“That your way of trying to get me to move on?”
When Tony finally calms enough to stand, he takes a deep breath. Since Steve isn’t banging on the door or trying to come in, it can’t be all that bad. Right?
“You, sir. I’m yours. Completely.”
Blushing, he looks over at Steve. “Thank you. Will you tell me about your day? I feel like I’ve been doing all the talking. Tell me what our dear prince gets up to when we’re all busy.”
“I’m filthy, Steve!” He holds up his hands as evidence. “Oh my god, look at your hand!”
“Mercy! Mercy! I’ll give you a hint!” Steve lets up and Tony has to catch his breath. “It’s a good thing you’re so pretty, sleeping beauty.” He steals another kiss and pokes Steve in the side. “Okay, your hint. It’s round.”
The workshop is littered with scraps of whatever paper Tony could get his hands on. They’re filled with sketches of shields of all different shapes, sizes, and varying designs. He’d been frustrated and annoyed that he couldn’t solve such a simple problem when the solution hit him. Simplicity. Steve has never been a royal who demanded his armor and weapons be extravagant and ostentatious. Tony had asked one night why Steve didn’t just ask for plain armor and when Steve explained that he wanted some adornment to draw the enemy to him and away from his people, he’d just found himself loving Steve all the more.
“They are.” He kisses the tip of Tony’s finger and starts to lean in to continue what they’ve started. Before they can get far, their stomachs growl and they both snicker. Steve sighs and settles for kissing the corner of Tony’s mouth. “Maybe we should eat.”
“That’s right.” Steve lets go and takes the abused bud in his mouth, sucking and licking until Tony is panting. He moves to the other and reaches behind to smack Tony’s ass. “I want you taking all of me, got it? We both know you’ve got nothing on tomorrow, and I want to hear you a little hoarse.”
Peeking over Tony’s shoulder, Steve tries to get another look at Tony's secret project. Whatever it is, he knows it will be incredible. Tony’s creations are almost always amazing, and even the few, quirkier, things have still turned out to be useful.
Sam leans over in front of Steve and arches an eyebrow. “Can’t you just do that thing where you-”
Tony gasps, but Steve doesn’t let go. “You are! You’re in charge, sir.”
“Good.” Tony kisses Steve’s chest and sighs. “I’m ready now.”
Tony lets Natasha’s words sink into his mind and finds himself smiling. “I really need to finish the shield then, don’t I? It’s the perfect courting gift.”
“You make me so beautiful.”
Tony rubs Peter’s back, still amazed that this tiny little thing is their son. “I do too.” He brushes a chaste kiss over Steve’s lips. “You hold him, I’ll get the bassinet.”
Roth comes in as Bucky leaves and even he has a knowing look on his face. It's a look that means Steve will be talking about the night before with a lot of people.
“Thinking about it.” Steve dips his fingers in the honey and brings them to Tony’s lips, watching as it drops onto his chest. “No biting. Just tongue.”
Tony plucks a daisy and brings it to his nose. “The flowers you’ve brought me. Started with just daisies, but you started adding more. Like that one.” Tony points at a pink flower. “And that one.”
“Mhmm.”
Tony raises an eyebrow and snorts. “Come on, Steve. I know I’m good-looking, but," He points to the sketch on the open page, "nothing like this.”
“It is. But do not forget to also set aside time for Steven. He has never been one to put more stock in what we give him. What he enjoys most is being with you and spending time with you.”
Tony laughs and lets Jarvis dress him. “I’m happy he did. I forgot to stop and get clean clothes.”
“Would have been pure shock. I’m glad I reined myself in though.”
Tony presses into Steve’s touch. “I don’t know., Charming Might be nice having you carry me everywhere.”
“It is.” Steve lets Tony stare at the tower for a little longer before walking them closer. “Some of the old magic has lingered since I was woken." He feels the familiar itch under his skin from the magic in the air and gives Tony's hand a squeeze. "The most useful thing has been that tower stays hidden until you walk through the trees.”
“You really should have, dear Steven.”
Since it’s just the two of them, Clint takes the opportunity to poke Tony in the ribs. “C’mon, Tones. Lean against me. You've been in your forge forever. Close your eyes and sleep a little. I won’t let you drown.”
Steve does his best not to panic and Bucky is there to knock some sense into him.
“Mmmkay,” Tony says, face still mashed into Steve’s chest. He feels Steve laughing and lifts his head so he can look him in the eye. “Fifteen minutes.”
A sound comes over the baby monitor and they both freeze. Tony’s fingers dig into Steve’s back and it feels like ages before they’re both assured that Peter is still asleep. Peter has had a lot of trouble sleeping this past month and Steve and Tony’s nights have been filled with walking him, singing to him, and trying every trick in the book to try to get him to sleep.
Bruce lingers a little longer, talking and joking with them before leaving to meet Betty for dinner. Before he goes, he stops and makes Tony promise to take more breaks from his work, telling him it’s not just Steve who misses him. Tony promises to take more breaks and he and Clint wish him luck. Just like Tony, Bruce has been pining for one of the queen’s ladies' maids, Lady Elizabeth Ross. Steve has given his blessing for the match, even offering to help set things up, but Bruce is still hesitant about making an offer for Betty. Tony and Clint do what they can to encourage Bruce, but they both know if they were to push too hard, Bruce would end up pulling away rather than going for what he wants.
Bruce works the soap into Tony’s hair and shares a knowing look with Clint. Tony’s feelings for Steve are a frequent topic of conversation for everyone in the harem. It’s not just Tony’s feelings they gossip about either. For a while now, Steve’s increasingly obvious attraction to Tony has also been part of the conversation. Rhodey and Bucky have suggested locking them in a closet together while Bruce and Sam are more of the mind to give them time to figure themselves out.
Tony nods quickly and rests his head on Steve’s knee. “I have, sir.”
The game progresses and Steve manages to get the win by a very narrow margin. They play again, Tony managing to get the win. They both know it’s getting late, but neither of them is quite ready for the night to end.
He reaches for a dish to begin serving and his eyes go wide when Steve takes it from him. “Let me. Please?”
“‘M fine, oh dear prince,” he mumbles into Steve’s chest. He clings a little longer before slowly forcing himself to let go. “You’re always there to catch me if I fall.”
“You make a good point.” The water around has changed color and Tony grimaces. “See you in the big pool?”
Tony splashes him. “Just because that worked for you and Bucky doesn’t mean it would work with me and Steve. He’s never shown interest in any of us that way and I don’t want him to think that’s all I want. He’s more like Nat. I need a subtler approach. He deserves to be wooed and courted. Maybe I could try some poetry?”
Steve buckles the collar around Tony’s neck and circles his shield inlaid into the leather. “Who do you belong to?”
There’s something about the way she says those words that starts the wheels turning in Steve’s head. “Mama, did you have anything to do with last night?”
“Because you beat me to proposing.”
Steve’s smile is slightly crooked and he tucks the basket behind his legs. “A surprise.”
After breakfast, and even more questions, they go out to train and Steve is not out there long before a footman comes looking for him. He passes along a message from the queen and Steve groans.
In the end, all the training paid off. In his sixteenth year, Steven lost his small sickly frame and grew almost a full foot in height. It was a mystery how it happened, but no one was more excited than Steven. When he arrived in the training yard and his father caught sight of him, he was glad he’d woken up late just so he could see the stunned look on his face.
(See the end of the chapter for
The hug lasts half a minute longer, Tony squeezing Jarvis tight before finally letting go. He doesn’t say anything else, just holds Jarvis’s gaze before turning and dashing to the door.
Peter is already starting to drift off on Steve’s shoulder and he knows if he moves now, they’re in for a long night with a fussy baby. “Shut up.” Tony starts to laugh and Steve shoves him. Tony keeps laughing and flops back on the pillows. “Help me. Please? Peter’s already out.”
Opening his eyes, Tony looks up at Steve’s face and smiles. “Hi.”
Tony smiles against Steve’s skin. “Yes, please.”
On the night when it’s going to happen, Steve and Tony have both decided to keep any surprises or changes to a minimum.
“Steve,” Tony pants, pulling away. “Steve. It’s never, I’ve never.” He looks at Steve and sees a matching desire in his eyes.
“I miss him.”
“Oh my dearest boy, of course, I do. He is a good man and you always light up when he is near.” She beckons him closer. “Now come. Pick something out.” She points to a couple of boxes. “I think these would suit Anthony quite well and shouldn’t impede with his work, but get a good look and pick what you feel is right.”
“Pretty sure time just goes faster when we're together, Charming." He doesn't let go of Steve's hand and takes a deep breath. "I know it’s gotten a little late since we did end up talking a good while, but I brought my chess set up. Play a game? Or two?” He winks. “I’ll even let you win one.”
Before stepping into his room, Tony takes Steve’s hand. Feeling brave, he lifts it to his lips and presses a kiss to Steve’s knuckles. “I’m sure I will have good dreams tonight. Sleep well, my prince.”
He’d just settled into one of the larger tubs and was resting his eyes for a few minutes when he hears his name being called.
Kissing along Tony’s jaw, Steve lifts him and lets him drop back onto his cock. “That’s right, baby. You’re mine. All mine. My baby. My sweetheart. My Tony.”
“You were too formal for a picnic, sir.” He drapes the waistcoat over his arm and reaches to undo a couple of buttons at Tony’s throat. “I also believe the prince will enjoy a bit of skin.”
“What do you think?” Tony can’t help but be a little nervous. He’s worked so hard and so long on this.
Steve grabs Bucky by the shoulders and looks him in the eye. He doesn’t know how he didn’t see it before. He’s always known the way he feels about Tony is different from everyone else, but he never clued into the fact that those were romantic feelings.
Tony takes a step closer, unsure what Jarvis is talking about. Jarvis begins unbuttoning his waistcoat and bites his lower lip. “Jarvis?”
“Maybe.” Tony licks his lips and reaches out for Steve. He finds his leg and slips his hand under the cuff of his pants. “You know how much I like having something in my mouth.” His hand trails up Steve’s calf. “Especially when it’s big. And thick.”
When Lady Natasha Romanoff agreed to the offer, more than a few wondered if it was all a plot to infiltrate the kingdom. It was well known that girls from her kingdom were plucked from their families as children to be trained as spies. The truth of the matter was that Lady Romanoff was one of those children. She had been sent as an applicant for the harem and upon meeting Steve and getting to know him, she knew she couldn't betray him. When her handlers discovered this, they took her away in the night and Steve could not let that stand. He rescued her from the cell she'd been imprisoned in and brought her back to Brooklyn. Now she, alongside Steve’s spymaster, had eyes and ears looking for those who would try and harm the kingdom.
“Of course.” Steve laughs. “It’s not all that exciting. Honestly. It’s a lot of meetings with advisors and writing letters while finding the little moments when I can come and find my favorite people.” Steve holds Tony’s gaze as he says the last bit, a shy smile on his face.
"We have not even exchanged a proper kiss yet. Save the wedding planning. Please.” Steve leans his head on her shoulder. “I care about him so much. Did you feel this way with papa?”
A shy smile appears on Steve’s face. “That was a good day.”
A little light seeps through the fabric of the blindfold but other than that, Tony can see nothing. He’s reliant on his hearing and other senses to know where Steve is.
Bucky’s heart breaks for his best friend. He’d give his other arm to kill Rumlow again if it meant he could erase these doubts from Steve’s mind and heart.
Knowing there’s no avoiding it, Steve looks into his glass and sighs. “I don’t know what came over me, Buck. I was walking him to the baths and next thing I know, I’m kissing the top of his head. It felt so natural. I’ve never felt the urge to do that with anyone else. Hell, I didn’t even realize I’d done it til I was dressing for dinner.” He closes his eyes and leans his head back against the chair. “The purpose of this harem was to give people a place where they could be safe and know they had a home. I never wanted any of them to feel they owed me anything or had to pay me back. I wasn't looking for love or marriage.”
Steve’s eyes look deep into Tony’s as he switches the pawns in his hands around and around until he’s not sure which one is where. He holds them out and chuckles as Steve taps his left hand. Steve always goes left when he has to pick anything. Tony’s not sure Steve even realizes he does it, but Tony loves that little quirk.
Tony gasps and a little whine escapes his lips. “Yours. All yours, sir.”
Tony giggles. “We are.” His arms go around Steve’s neck and he holds onto him. “Though, I should be mad at you.”
“It is. He made it himself.”
“Steve would do that,” Tony whispers. “He’s always so caring and observant about these things.”
“For me?”
“Hmm?” Steve is pulled from his thoughts and finally notices Bucky leaning against Tony’s door with Bruce. “What are you two doing here? Where’s Tony? Is he okay?”
The queen is in her solarium this time of day and when Steve comes in, she sends her ladies away and beckons him closer. Her hair is more silver than the blonde it used to be and there are laugh lines around her mouth, but to Steve, she’s still the most beautiful woman he’s ever seen.
“What do you want, Stevie?”
“Probably a good idea.”
The rest of the week has both Steve and Tony finding sneakier and more elaborate ways to pass more notes to one another as well as leave more little gifts. When Steve finds a new belt in his saddlebags, he shakes his head. Tony really is outdoing himself. The leather is thick and when Steve looks closer, he can see that there are roses burned into the belt. Not only are roses some of Steve's favorite flowers, but Brooklyn itself is known for its roses. Reaching back in the saddlebag, Steve finds Tony's note. It's another scrap of paper, but there are no sketches on the back this time. Instead, Tony has included his own crude drawing of a rose and added the name of the artist who made the belt.
“Hmm?” He looks down and laughs. “Oh, right.” He lets go of Steve’s wrist and shoos him off. “Go on, Stevie. Go get your man.”
The next time she felt the first stirrings within her, she kept quiet until she was sure it was real. When a few months passed, and she was sure as she could be, she ran to her husband and threw her arms around him, tears flowing freely down her face. Joseph had held his wife close to his chest, his own tears falling silently into her hair. He had seen the way Sarah had wilted a little more with each month that passed without conceiving. Before she came to him, he’d even begun thinking of suggesting they adopt a child. He was well aware of his duty to provide an heir, but like his wife, he wanted more than just an heir. He wanted a child to love and teach and provide for. What would it have mattered if they were of their blood or not?
Tony opens his eyes and turns his head toward the sound. “It’s me. Planning on joining me, Bruce, or just standing and watching?”
“Just remembering the day you came and made me an offer I couldn’t refuse.”
“That's the surprise.” Steve picks up the picnic basket and begins walking, tugging on Tony’s hand until he follows. “But it’s worth it. Promise.”
Tony enjoys the baths with Clint and Bruce.
“Lately?”
Shaken from his trance, Tony smiles. “I’ve missed you too.” The words are earnest and Tony takes a step closer to Steve. “I’ll be there. At dinner. Promise.”
Tony’s hand falls away and Steve nips at his jaw. “Thought we needed to be quiet.”
Doubt still filters into Tony’s mind and try as he might to hide from it in Steve’s chest, it still whispers in his ear. “I know you do. I promise you. I know that. But-”
“That everyone knows about you and Tony having a private dinner last night?” Sam asks, appearing on Steve’s other side.
“Stop talking. Please.” Steve’s fork clatters to the table and he groans. “I’ll tell you. Just, please. No more.”
Steve nods, heart in his throat. The only people who have seen his work have been his parents. The portrait of his father currently hanging in his mother’s chambers is his work. He’d asked her to not tell anyone he’d painted it and up until now, he’d been happy keeping his painting to himself. It had become his preferred way of dealing with his emotions when it felt like there were too many or they were becoming too complicated. When he’d begun planning this picnic, he’d gone back and forth about showing this to Tony, but he'd known this would be the perfect time to show Tony this part of him.
It’s on the tip of Steve’s tongue to say he’s fine and they can go in, but he knows it’s not the truth. “A moment would be nice, actually. How were the baths?”
Unfortunately, all of their preparations were for naught. As evening approached, it was Sarah who noticed how quiet it had become. The birds were silent and even the wind had died. She ran for her husband and together they began searching for Steven. They searched the castle and when they could not find him, they feared the worst. Their search moved outdoors and they quickly found his retinue of guards and knew they’d failed in their efforts to prevent their son’s fate. Before they could continue their search, a thick red fog rolled across the ground, rendering everyone it touched into an enchanted sleep. The same sleep which had enchanted their prince in a tower surrounded by roses and thorns in the woods...
He’s still a little self-conscious about the scars on his chest. Steve has spent hours kissing them and telling Tony how beautiful he finds them, but they still bother Tony sometimes. He takes a deep breath, he can do this.
Pierce is not without his tricks, though. He backs further into the fireplace and doesn’t hesitate to toss some ash into Steven’s eyes. Keeping his eyes locked on Steven, he stands and doesn’t notice Sam and Bucky have finished with Rumlow and are now coming up behind him. They keep silent and disarm Pierce, pushing him to his knees. Once Steven can see again, he smiles and accepts the sword Bucky hands him. Pierce tries to plead for his life, but Steven knows that if he were to leave him alive, it would only be a matter of time before he tried something again. It is not an easy choice, but one that has to be made. Not only for his own safety but for the safety of his kingdom and the people in it.
“Still think it would work if you just waited for him in his bed,” Clint says with a smirk.
Bruce snorts. “Sorry, Steve. Tony swore us to secrecy.”
All Bucky can do is stare. Does Steve not hear the way he talks about Tony? He shakes his head and laughs to himself. Of course, Steve doesn’t hear it. Steve is not going to make the connection that his feelings are romantic right away. His interest in other people has always been more friendly and familial rather than romantic. When Bucky and Sam were sneaking kisses with other maids, and each other once, Steve always told them the idea just never interested him.
“Just as silver and blue suits you. And look how well they go together.” Finally pulling his gaze away from the strings, Tony stares into Steve’s eyes. “When did you first feel the pull?”
Steve takes a seat next to him and nods. “It is.”
Steve pulls back. “Why?”
Steve beams and takes Tony’s hand. “You do.” He looks Tony up and down slowly. Red really is Tony's color. “Though, you missed a spot.”
Tony leans against her and nods. “Steve is my best friend, but he's also become more than that. I think about him all the time. I dream about him! And not nice, frolicking in meadow-type dreams." He turns his face into her shoulder and groans. "Dreams that take place in darkened rooms and in bed. Steve has always made it clear he doesn't expect that, or even really want it, but I can't stop thinking about it. Is that how it is for you? With Clint and Bucky.”
“You’d get sick of me being that close all the time.”
Steve rolls his shoulders back and gets a handful of Tony’s ass. “Naked first.” He lets Tony strip and begins touching Tony all over. “Good, baby. So gorgeous. All hard and eager for me.”
A flush spreads over Tony’s body. “Yes, sir.”
After that, dinner seems to pass in a whirl. Tony knows he listened to Steve and they talked and ate, but it all seems to come to an end too quickly. Before he’s even aware, Steve is pushing out of his chair and holding out his arm.
There is something comforting about having a plan and as Steve listens to Bucky’s ideas, he feels more settled. He can do this. He can court Tony. Tony has to feel the pull too. Steve has noticed him rubbing at his chest more than a few times and he wonders if he was feeling the same things Steve was.
Tony can feel himself sinking into that calm settled place of submission and he swallows. “Yes, sir.”
When evening comes, Tony and Steve walk back to the castle for the feast that awaits them there. Steve keeps hold of Tony’s hand the whole time, overjoyed to be sharing this with his betrothed. Whenever he spies a secluded spot, he pulls Tony aside and takes the chance to kiss him again and again. Tony returns the favor a few times himself, loving the way Steve happily lets himself be led somewhere they won't be seen. By the time they actually arrive back at the castle, their cheeks are flushed and their lips are swollen.
“I know, baby. You’re gorgeous. I wanna draw you like this one day. Let you float while I get every last line of you on paper.”
“Will you tell me what it is?”
Instead, Steve collects the stray bits of honey and lets Tony enjoy his fingers a little longer. The moment Steve’s foot comes between his legs and brushes his cock, though, Tony almost bites down. He manages not to and groans around Steve’s fingers as his foot continues tormenting him through silk.
“Because I didn’t want you to hate me. I would have been essentially kidnapping you. And regardless of invisible strings and prophecies, I did not want that as the only reason we were together.” He starts rubbing Tony’s back and closes his eyes. “Can I tell you something, Tony?”
The nerves Tony feels are familiar to Jarvis. He remembers being just as nervous before he asked Ana to marry him. “I am sure, young sir. You are going to have a wonderful time with the prince. I know for a fact, he was speaking with Happy about packing some of your favorites in his picnic basket.”
A plate appears in front of Steve and he avoids the question by taking a bite of sausage. “Let me eat for god’s sake.”
The queen watched from the doorway; heart in her throat, fearing Margaret would tell her her son would not live to see his first birthday. Steven was strong, she knew he was, even if he didn’t look it.
Steve helps Tony stand and they walk to the bathroom together. Steve does a quick clean up and steals one last kiss before putting on some pajama pants and moving into the kitchen.
The question was not what Tony had expected and, he tried to come up with an answer he felt would please Steve the most. Steve wasn’t having it though. He took Tony's hand in his and shook his head. He repeated the question and added, "you, Tony. Not what you think I want to hear, but what do you love doing?"
“Is that?”
They stay on their floor for the scene. Steve wants them somewhere comfortable. Somewhere Tony feels safe. Their playroom is also a safe place, but it also comes with other expectations for different kinds of play and Steve wants the night to be about them and Tony’s trust in him when it comes to the blindfold.
“Aw, thanks, Rhodey bear.” Tony leans into the embrace. “If I give you a note can you give it to Steve? I was going to pass it to one of the footmen, but since you’re here…”
It’s quiet for a moment and then Bucky narrows his eyes at Steve. “Nice try distractin’ me with Nat, but you’re not gettin’ out of tellin’ me about what happened with Tony.”
Bucky is ecstatic that Steve has accepted that he has feelings for Tony. Now, the question is if he’s going to do anything about it.
Speechless, Tony goes still and stares. Steve blushes, but no part of him regrets the kiss. “I’ll see you at dinner, Tony. And don’t think I won’t send Rhodey to come and find you.”
“But you never cared for Rumlow.”
Tony lifts his hand and finds Steve’s cheek. “Little bit of stubble there, sir.” He smiles. “I like it.”
Such a simple endearment shouldn’t make Tony feel as much as he does, but his heart races as he holds tighter onto Steve. His head is on Steve’s chest and he can hear the steady beat of his prince's heart and it’s one of the best sounds he’s ever heard.
The sound of Steve’s voice startles Tony from his thoughts and he idly wonders if he's somehow summoned him with his thoughts. He checks on the shield one more time, wanting to be sure it's securely on the shelf and won't be seen.
Looking down at his puckered fingertips, Tony laughs. “That is probably a good idea. Steve also threatened to send Rhodey if I was late.”
“On my cock, baby.”
Lifting Peter from the crib, Steve settles him in his arms and pops the nipple in Peter’s mouth. “Should we go find daddy? I’m sure he’s waiting up just so he can see you.”
“Again?”
“We’ve each won one.” Steve smiles and it’s the lopsided, slightly crooked smile Tony especially loves. “A tie-breaker is required.”
Shaking himself, Tony tilts his head to the side and offers a smile. “Steve?”
Time freezes and it’s as if the breath has been stolen from his lungs. Steve’s touch is so soft, almost barely there, but Tony is already craving more. He wants to know what those fingers would feel like on his chest, his stomach, and...Tony clears his throat and turns his head, dislodging Steve’s fingers.
“Tony?”
“I’m glad we’ve both taken this step,” There’s a pause and Steve adds, “sweetheart.”
He sees Tony peek around the corner and grins. “Come on in, sweetheart. Let me see you.”
“Okay, yes. That’s good.” Eyes locking with Jarvis’s, Tony takes a deep breath. “It’s going to go well, right?”
For the next five years, Sarah and Joseph tried to teach Steven anything and everything he might need to know. Alongside his work with the knights, there were lessons in diplomacy, geography, languages, and history. As word of Steven's victories spread, it did not take long for nearby kingdoms to begin sending portraits of their sons and daughters in hopes the prince would choose one of them to wed.
Sarah gasps as a crown made of stars appears on Steven’s forehead. She never would have imagined her son would be so important. Brooklyn is still a small kingdom, almost inconsequential amongst the rest. How could her son be so important? She looks over to Margaret and the glow around her gets brighter until she has to close her eyes against the light.
The cravat drops to the floor and Natasha tips Tony’s face down with her fingers. “We both know you'd never send Jarvis away. Just as we both know there is so much for you to tell me. Now talk.”
“Tony? Are you alright?”
After this pronouncement, both the king and queen look to the other and share a few knowing looks. This knight’s crowing is overly loud, boisterous, and grating, and he is certainly not the type of person they imagined for their son. The queen looks over at Steven and frowns when she sees the strain around his eyes and the way he seems to be forcing himself to remain quiet. She wants to hope that it is due to being awakened in a whole new world but makes a vow to herself to keep a watchful eye on him.
“I love them.”
“Stevie!”
“I may have, your highness.”
“I believe our prince wants that with you too.”
“I’m here, Steve.” He steps into the forge, the heat immediately making his face flush. “Sorry, I was putting something away.” There’s a basket on Steve’s arm and Tony tips his head to the side. “What’s that?”
“Okay.”
Steve turns, ready to start searching for Tony but stops when he feels Bucky grab his wrist. “Buck? What are you doing? We need to find Tony.”
Tony had initially planned on waiting until the end of the night to give Steve his gift, but as dinner continues, he realizes he doesn't want to wait that long. He wants to see Steve’s face when he brings out the shield. He does manage to wait until the plates are cleared. As soon as he can, he kisses Steve on the cheek and pushes back from the table.
Moving from around Steve, Tony gets his first look at the place where his prince slept for 70 years. The room, itself, is bright and airy and Tony’s jaw drops as he looks around. He can see how a place like this would lead someone, especially someone like Steve, to come back again and again.
“No.” Steve shakes his head. “The rubies are perfect.”
Opening his eyes, Steve grins. “Amazing. You’re amazing. So good, Tony. My Tony.”
Tony’s laughter joins Steve’s and he leans up for one last kiss. “At least we both got to come this time.”
He makes another circuit of the room, hands pulling at his hair. “Why did I kiss Steve’s hand? I'm smarter than that.”
Steve laughs. “No. Real one.”
“Can I walk you to your room?”
Steve smiles to himself. He feels so content with Tony in his arms like this, knowing they have a bright future ahead of them.
Steve smiles, shoulders relaxing. "Goodnight, my Tony."
Steeling himself, he lifts his hand and knocks. He knows he could just go in since they are his rooms after all, but it just feels right to knock.
“Oh my god. Is this?”
Rhodey stops to let his friend catch up. “You’re really going for it, Tones?”
“I can do that. I know Tony. I know what he likes and what he hates,” Steve chuckles, “I even know about the sweets he charms the cooks into setting aside for him.”
Tony notices the tears in Steve's eyes and finds himself at a loss for words. Instead, he gets as close as he can without getting in Steve's lap and slips his arm through Steve's. He tangles their fingers together and leans his head on Steve's shoulder. He wishes he knew what to say to offer more comfort, but he hopes just sharing this moment and this space with Steve helps.
“Good boy.” Sarah stands and takes his hand. “Now, come with me. I think you need to pick something out to give to Anthony. A piece of jewelry to let him know your intentions are serious. Tell me what you are planning next. His idea for a quiet dinner just the two of you was quite inspired.”
“Good.”
There’s something more to Steve’s words and Bucky has never been one to let something go. Especially when it comes to his best friend. “Spill it, Stevie. You’re not tellin’ me something.”
“Yes, he is.” Jarvis takes a step to the side and gives Tony a nudge. “And you should not keep him waiting.”
She lasted another minute before the question she’d been holding back, burst forth. “Please, Margaret. Tell me. Am I going to lose him?”
Steve’s hand pets his hair and Tony squirms a little. “Another time, sweetheart. Promise.”
Restless, Steve paces for a minute before going and pouring himself a glass of whiskey. He doesn’t drink though. Not right away at least. He moves to the fireplace and watches the way the flames dance. An ember falls to the ground and he remembers the time an ember had managed to get under Tony’s gloves. Steve had been with him in the forge that day watching him work. He'd heard Tony make a pained sound and had quickly removed the glove and brought him over to the water pump as quickly as he could. The burn itself had not been bad, but Steve had sent someone for Bruce anyway. As soon as it had healed, Tony had come to find him and showed him how Steve had saved him from another scar.
“Mhmm,” Steve hums, eyes sparkling as he offers Tony a warm smile. “More like I’ll be letting you win one.”
When those fingers finally sink into his hair, Tony moans at the little pinpricks of pain that come from Steve pulling.
As another week comes to an end, Tony decides it's time to put his next plan into action. He's made a lot of progress on the shield. Instead of just an assortment of rings, the three main rings are welded together and the center portion has been fitted with a star. He covers the pieces and begins cleaning up. He's eager to put his plan in motion. It's a big step, but he's ready to take it.
It always amazes Tony how Natasha just seems to know that he wants his cufflinks off first once his jacket is gone. He holds out one arm and then the other and accepts the cufflinks from her when she’s finished.
Before they are to depart, the queen cannot erase the feeling that something is wrong. Taking her son aside, she takes his hands in her and asks him if this knight truly makes him happy. Steven has never been able to lie to his mother, and this time is no different. He confesses to her that he has suspected something was not right about the knight’s story, since he never felt the tug of those invisible strings the seer Margaret had spoken of so long ago. Before his mother can say another word, he adds that he is hoping that by accompanying Rumlow to his king, he will be able to discover the truth of what is going on.
“You always have such confidence in me, Jarvis.”
He takes a step forward and calls out again. “Steve?”
“I trust you, Steve. So much. I know you won’t let anything happen.” They’ve just about made it back to the couch and Tony squeezes Steve’s hand. “Leg’s awake too. How do you want me, sir?”
Quickly losing track of time, it’s Clint who notices they’re both getting pruny and nudges Tony with his arm. “Come on, dinner should be soon and we’re all wrinkly. Let’s get out and get dressed.”
Steve’s hand is on the back of his head and Tony opens his mouth and lets Steve guide him back onto his cock. “Suck, Tony.”
The words are a little muffled, but Steve drifts off happily, knowing he heard Tony say, “I love you too, Steve.”
Steve’s words are so earnest and heartfelt that Tony has to kiss him. “Yes, Steve. My prince charming. My darling. My beloved. I will marry you. I would love to marry you. I want to be the best partner to you and stand by your side and help our people.”
One more breath and Tony walks out the door.
“Always will, Tony.”
“Stevie?”
“I’m not trying to be.”
“I can do this.”
Steven had hoped that once this was all over he’d feel jubilant or excited or even eager for the future. Instead, he’s angry and worried, and heartbroken. The last one is a surprise to him. While he’d always known Rumlow was not his True Love, there had still been a small part of him that had hoped. Steven wanted to be loved. His mother had told him about the Seer, Margaret’s, words when he was a child. How there was someone out there who would stand at his side and rule a happy and united kingdom with him. He wanted that. He wanted it so badly. He knew it would be like what his mother and father share and a love like that seemed like paradise. Now, though, it's different. He doesn't care anymore if he ever feels the pull of those so-called “invisible strings”. All he wants is to go home and learn how to take care of his people and take care of his kingdom.
Tony’s fingers trail over the strings connecting them. “Not so invisible right now.”
After a few minutes, he suddenly realizes Tony isn’t holding his hand anymore. Afraid he’s walked too far and left Tony behind, he whirls around and begins looking for him. Thankfully, Tony has not fallen behind but is instead standing in a patch of flowers, a bright smile on his face.
This continues for a couple of weeks more. The treats and gifts stay small, and the notes get longer. Tony is astounded by how poetic Steve can be even with the most mundane things. Tony tries his best, but cringes more often than not at the things he writes. Almost every single one of his notes starts including dark blots from where he's tried to scratch out his attempts.
“I’m glad. I thought of having something else waiting for you, but I know how much you enjoy Happy’s lemon shortbread. And he’d just gotten a fresh batch of lemons in, so they’d be sweet, but still tart, and…” The words trail off and Tony blushes. “And I’m rambling.”
One of Tony’s very favorite things about the land of Brooklyn is the natural hot springs. When Steve’s ancestors had settled on the land, they’d smartly taken advantage of the springs and built over them to keep the castle warm during the frigid winters. Regular access to hot water was an additional reward that everyone in the castle enjoyed. As the years passed, another of Steve’s relatives had had the idea to build a bath over a section of the springs and Tony had no problem reaping the benefits of their forethought.
“Why is she-”
A little flustered, Tony forgets his speech for a moment and has to lean down and kiss Steve. He doesn’t care that everyone is watching, he needs to do this.
