His head had started to get dizzy as he moaned into the kiss, hands clinging onto the older teen’s sides as the two of them continued to press against each other. When they had finally broke apart Tony was all flushed out as he panted against Bucky’s face, lidded brown eyes going wide at the realization that the bedroom door had actually been open.
Steve didn’t seem all that comfortable as Tony did since he had been very silent and was sweating a bit..well maybe that’s what he gets for wearing a jacket on a hot day. Tony decided to take the lead and started rambling about some projects he was doing at school making the blond gape at him with wide eyes. Half way through though Steve hd admitted he didn’t understand much of what the brunette was talking about which made Tony giggle before going silent as he didn’t know what else to talk about. Fortunately thanks to his rambling Steve had began looking more comfortable and even took his jacket and cap off. Tony suppressed a chuckle at Steve’s messy hair as he decided to lean closer and comb the blond’s hair with his fingers, ignoring the way Steve had stared at him with his blue gaze.
Yes, Tony IS his now..and would forever be bound to him as they both began chanting the ancient prayers that would bound Tony to him eternally. He felt his heart skip a beat when he saw Tony blush a bit while saying the lines ‘my body and soul for his to keep’. Not a hint of his facial expression telling Steve that he was afraid of him.
But Steve was always okay with it. Even seeming to enjoy it! He thinks with a sigh. what if Steve actually found his soulmate? Would it still be okay for Tony to be clingy then? Would they even still live together? He’s sure the two would probably want to find a place of their own to start a family.
“O-oh,” he guessed Sam had a point. He had to take care of his heat and he could either do it out in nature as his ancestors used to do, allow the whole world to see his bare ass, or he could be selfish and ask for a heat room and have some moderate privacy.
Steve broke out a grin before kissing him again in goodnight and waiting on Tony to enter his room before walking away. Tony remained in his room for a total of five minutes before venturing outside again and walking down to Bruce’s door. He pressed his ear next to it, listening in on Bruce’s soft snoring and nothing else. The other omega had gotten the duty of watching over his cockatoo and machine while he took his walk with Steve and if he were to guess from what he was hearing he’d say Jarvis and Vision were also asleep. Not having the heart to disturb any of them and not exactly wanting to sleep alone on his bed yet he wandered away and headed further down the hall. With no clear destination in mind and no clue where certain doors or corridors led he continued his quiet walk blindly, being careful not to wake up any of the others.
shifted, but the ratio of wolves to humans was large in numbers so he counted himself as being unique for walking on his two feet. Then again, it was currently early in the morning and the land still hadn’t been warmed up to a reasonable temperature yet. That probably played a part in why there were more wolves. Fur was always better in keeping out the cold. Still, he considered himself unique. He'd take any opportunity to think so with open arms.
Suddenly his hand shot out and grabbed Tony’s throat in a tight hold. It was so fast and unexpected that Tony choked, trying to catch his breath.
Bucky huffed, making Tony instinctively lower his eyes and his head. Tony had no right to make eye contact with him. His second in command was about to berate him for what he had done, ensue his punishment, or at least he was meant to, but a growl from Rhodey put it all at a stand still and before he knew it Rhodey had moved in front of him, making himself a barrier. Rhodey lifted his front leg over Tony, making his chest cover his entire front and continued growling. The display made Steve growl back and he took a paw forward.
Tony blinked. “Why would he knock you to the ground?” What reason was there for Steve to fight if they managed to insult him?
Rhodey went silent for a moment, taking in what he had said. “What do you mean by ‘stench of the deceased?’”
Tony perked up. “Everyone, this is the Hulk. Hulk, this is everyone.” Hulk grunted as a show of hello when Tony lifted a paw to gesture towards him. “He may look grumpy and scary but don’t let that fool you. He’s a softy on the inside.”
Breakfast was a small affair between them both. To prepare for the long trip and to avoid overindulging that would result in a slower pace and less stamina they ate a small share of fruits, bread and cheese and rationed any extras. Tony made sure to sneak a few more for Jarvis.
Tony watched him storm off, admiring the view that were Steve's strong legs pushing on the ground and the muscle flexing. Bucky rushed off after the alpha with speed that Tony would never be able to reach. Once again he cursed the youth the alphas carried and their unfairly fit bodies.
“A mighty fine family name indeed,” Thor complimented. “Strong, unyielding, a grand title for those determined to move forward.”
“We’re not cruel, Tony,” Steve continued, growing fond. “We’d never pretend to like you in order to play some cruel prank. Heck, once we got over our initial shock of you appearing out of nowhere we didn’t give it much thought afterwards. We were too focused on finding you. Or, well, I was.” A blush appeared on the pale skin. “When I saw you I wasn’t exactly sure, but I had this feeling that I needed to find you again to see. It’s hard to explain, but please know that me asking you to join the Avengers is genuine. We’d really like to include you.”
Ty stopped. He clearly understood that implication. “Ooh,” he grinned, “well maybe your taste runs more toward,” Ty looked back, “
The floor was there and he was already lying on it and Steve was already back from making a quick trip to the kitchen and in his mouth he carefully held a plate of cooked ham slathered with delicious juice and placed it carefully in front of him on the floor. All he had to do was reach out and bite into it and while he was doing that Steve was circling around him with his tail wagging before he curled around, tucked his front legs under Tony’s side and his head on Tony’s shoulder. Jan, bless her, brought a small bowl filled with nuts and fruits for Jarvis.
Rhodey gestured at Pepper and Happy. “Figured it was time for us to go. We came looking for Tony and now that we know he’s safe we can rest easy tonight on the road. We’ll get out of your fur.”
Tony tried pushing down the embarrassment that flooded his chest and gave his cheeks a pink coloring. “Right,” he mumbled to Bruce. He was starting to learn, oh so slowly, that, Steve and the Avengers weren't  anything like Hammer or his pack. When they teased they were including him on the teasing, not outright mocking him. And he had to somehow engrave in his head that Steve was really interested in him. It was a hard thing to do since he couldn’t help the doubt that bubbled  up from the thought of alpha in his prime and with a body to match it and leading a famous pack Steve Rogers wanting… him.
Tony had heard the difficulty betas went through in order to trigger one or the other. The ‘balance’ they carried that allowed for both options also proved to be the reason for their difficulty. The sudden influx of hormones caused problems, took time and was not recommended until the season for pup rearing came upon them for the health of the betas in question. Female alphas and male omegas also struggled with this if they went opposite of what their orientation assigned. Female alpha pregnancies were on the difficult and careful side while male omegas trying to sire have a hard time even planting roots in their partners.
His body responded accordingly as it always seemed to do when Steve touched him, but it wasn’t the time for it. Not when their pack was getting ready and most were already waiting downstairs for them.
It was good to feel good. He shouted this and many of their teammates agreed. All together they held up a mug given to them by Thor and drank.
“Don’t listen to him,” Sam countered. “Some of us still have modesty. Sort of. Whatever this idiot tells you don’t believe every single word, especially when he’s teaming up with this one.” He pointed at Jan, who waved innocently to them. “We’re not as scary as they make us sound to be. And we don’t do whatever they say we do. Not until we get permission first, at least.” The beta winked, making everyone laugh again except for Steve and Natasha.
Peter grabbed for the reins when it was all set and ready. Like on the television, he began to crack them, saying words ranging from ‘mush’ to ‘giddy-up.’ All in vain to get Tony moving. He didn’t budge until Ben gave him the go-ahead.
“You don’t mean…” Bucky looked to be holding back from asking the obvious question in both his and Steve’s mind.
’ to foul the place. The gesture meant more to him than Jan would ever realize, even if he had already gone through the sorrow long ago. It was comforting and gave him hope.
“That depends,” Prior released a growl, “are you both leaving for other shacks, or are you leaving because you got invited to join a pack?”
He wasn’t the only one to notice. “Easy,” Sam said, “you know I wouldn’t do that to you, Cap. None of us would, but you gotta give us leeway here. It’s finally happening after all this time? We’re going to tease you, and you’re going to deal with it.”
“Fine,” Bruce shrugged. He appeared to mean it. “I am, really. I might not be running, but I am scaring and that’s just as fun. In fact I managed to get Clint, Hank, Thor and even Natasha.”
Blood and heat rushed south faster than Tony could’ve tried mentally stopping it. Not that he believed he could put a stop to it. Not with the way his body just pulsed in anticipation and memories and the pleasurable sensation he had experienced hours prior raced in his mind and through his nerves. A need grew within him. A need only his alpha could’ve filled.
“Leave the imbecile alone,” Loki’s voice attributed. When they searched for him they saw Loki’s tail following the curve of the road and slither away behind the trees “He is not worth the effort.”
“Give it to Hawkeye. We can’t afford to miss. Half of you stay outside or close to the wall. He’s going to attack when he’s hit. Don’t let him grab hold of you.”
Natasha was now standing besides Bruce, blocking him from view from the locals. “Would you care for company, Звездный свет?”
“Ever picture yourself living the family pack life?” Tony asked, steering the conversation towards another direction.
Tony sighed and gripped his best friend’s shirt. “Tell them something… please.” The words of an alpha were stronger than an omega.
“Brock dumped him!” Nat answered his questioning look. “What?…that dick!” Bruce gasped as he stared at their singing friend. “Always was…” Nat yelled as a few people started to sing along the drunk blond. “What was the reason? I mean wasn’t he the one who asked Clint out first?” Bruce asked as he tried to ignore Thor climbing on the table and joining the other blond. “Said he found his soulmate…” Nat rolled her eyes as she took another beer.
“Pep..come on in…Steve here was just helping me relax..” Tony managed to say through soft moans. “he’s been so busy lately that i couldn’t help but lend a hand. After all…we wouldn’t want a worn out ironman on the battlefield. Would we?..” Steve smiled sickeningly sweet at the red head beta.
“Steve...Steve..come on now, were all friends here..Thor just needs a place to stay for a while okay?” The brunette promised as he tried to calm the angry hybrid that was holding too tight. Steve merely glanced at him before glaring back at the other blond hybrid. Well so much for  trying to talk with him. Honestly Tony should of seen it coming, this wasn’t really the first time Steve had shown his possessiveness towards the brunette. Even when he was a skinny thing back then he had bit one of Tony’s dates ears when the guy had tried to give Tony a kiss. Even one of his client’s had ran out the door when Steve suddenly attacked him when he attempted to pin Tony against the wall. It should of been frustrating since Tony hadn’t been able to find a date since then but honestly seeing his tiny hybrid get so possessive and territorial was just too adorable for the brunette to get upset about. He had always thought it was due to Steve not really trusting anyone but him back then. The hybrid use to be so weary around other people. That all change how ever when he had decided to take had a little stroll around the park with the more muscular Steve , who unexpectedly scratched a hybrid on the face when he had gotten too close to Tony, Purring contently when the engineer had petted him. The two unaware Unaware of a fuming muscular Steve behind them as they interacted. The little stunt his now Supposed to be friendlier hybrid had done had perplex Tony since Steve hadn’t shown any aggression towards other’s since he’d been with him for six months.
“I know you’ve killed before. I know there’s a lot bodies on your ledger but…if you can promise me that you won’t kill anyone anymore, then I think I can be with you,” Peter explained. “Otherwise, we need to end this right now before we fall into this too deep.”
“What should I say, Tony??” Steve demanded, his voice grating under the emotion welling up in it. “I ask time and time again for you to look at Wade in a different light but you keep shooting me down. How many more times do I have to pick myself up until you give in? Or are my opinions really
“Oh, I don’t know. I forgot his name. You know, I don’t know what I had for breakfast this morning,” Tony replied to her.
Tony suddenly started coughing up his coffee. Steve lightly pat his back and, between coughs, he gasped, “I’m fine…Went down…the wrong hole…”
This was a side of Harry Steve had never seen. He was quiet, scared, and looked as white as a ghost. It was nothing like the loud and bouncy kid who played with his son. Steve gently touched the boy’s shoulder and whispered, “It’s okay, we got it from here.”
“Yes, I’m positive,” Bucky stated. "It...It's the closest thing Steve has for a final resting place and I want to go there to say goodbye. No, I need to go there, Tony. I need to be with him one last time, even if it's just his spirit..."
Yensen was the first person that came to mind as he usually did when he thought back to the arrogant man he used to be. The guilt from his death had lessened but, as soon as he reflected on that, the fresher sense of guilt burned into his heart and he dropped his head.
Tony stiffened in surprise but, strangely enough, his first thoughts were Steve’s serum was gone and he was tiny again.
Maybe if Tony took his time, Steve would think the gesture was nothing and they could go back to pretending. Tony wouldn’t even chance a glance at Steve's magnificent ass the rest of the night.
in the flesh. God…he missed her. How many months had it been for him? And how much time had passed for her? A week?
The Iron Patriot stood off to the side, out of the way, and silently watched as people busily prepared the plane. Steve glanced at him, wanting to talk, but the President moved deeper into the plane and Steve followed him.
Bucky looked at her hand and then her face, and now looked at her as if she were the insane one and not Tony. Oh, Tony was going to have a great time with these two.
Venom screeched and expanded its body, trying to find a way to break free. No matter how far it stretched nor how sharp it made its tendrils, it could not break free from Wanda’s magic.
Steve’s heart convulsed slightly from the rendition. Yes, whenever that happened he did crave a person to call his own...
“I cannot watch this hounding any longer!” Thor growled, “I shall fly swiftly to his side and aide him!” Thor lifted his hammer and shot out of the room. The glass shattered as Thor flew through it and it went flying in all directions.
Tony caught the eye of a trio of kids and decided to be as stereotypical as possible and tipped his head and called out, “Howdy!”
Bucky slowly swallowed his food and his eyes flicker up to the flowers then back down to his plate. He whispered, “I read online about the language of flowers…and purple hyacinths mean: sorrow and I am sorry.” His eyes flickered up and brushed over Natasha then fell down to her plate. Bucky whispered, “And ‘Please forgive me.’”
"Of course, Dad,” Peter replied with an aspirated groan. “But I don’t know about Aunt May. I will text you later after I ask her.”
He called Fury and yelled, “What is this about a tranquilizer?? He’s not a fugitive! Just use me! He knows me! He trusts me! I’m your best bet!!”
He sat on a bench and unloaded his heart, telling her how he didn't mean to treat her that way and how much he loved her. He never really told his aunt how he truly felt but he felt the need to do it now. He never got the chance with his parents nor Uncle Ben. Aunt May was the most important person in his life and he wanted her to know that, knowing neither of them would know what tomorrow may bring.
He wasn’t too surprised to read the initial report from the psychiatrist an hour later, to see that the Captain was suffering from a number of mental ailments, the foremost being depression. It was up for review by the higher ups to determine the Captain’s release and Coulson prayed they’d let the man go. With Stark, he’d most likely been happy. Denying him Stark would only make things much worse.
“Steve?” Tony countered, tipping his head to the side with a coy smile despite his earlier reservations. He was a little tipsy but a little flirting never hurt anyone, right?
It took Tony only a few seconds to see how broken Wade had become and, he bitterly admitted to himself, it was because of Peter and Wade’s close relationship, a relationship Tony had been trying to deny…
Iron Man’s gazed flashed and then it blasted into the air and flew toward the front of the company where the fighting looked to be worse.
Tony wrapped his arm around Steve’s shoulder and Steve continued, “B-But just now I dreamed about you, about today, and-and you had died, really died and it was so much worse – Bucky died because of me and I couldn’t live with myself if you had died because of me too!”
Well...not completely alone Pepper was there and Rhodey would’ve been there too if he wasn’t kicking Hydra butt at the moment and Tony wasn’t going to dissuade him from that particular mission.
“Round two of testing,” he announced and then flicked the paperclip. It bounced off Peter’s nose and their experiment didn’t so much as twitch.
Tony eventually ran out of leg and Steve’s slacks and boxer briefs slid off feet and onto the floor. Tony quickly took off Steve’s socks leaving Steve was as bare as the day he was born.
Steve shifted his stance slightly. The President of the United States was only a fallback?? It was incredulous. Steve asked, “And your primary target?”
Tony lay himself against him, pressing his body flush to Steve’s. They simultaneously groaned as their hard cocks pressed against each other. His erection strained against his trousers and made all the more sensitive to any touch and Tony was probably feeling the same in his jeans.
Uncle Thor cursed something under his breath in Asgardian. The curse was directed at the Tower and Peter was glad it was not because of his slip in strength. The Norse God probably did not even notice Peter’s squeezing him tighter than necessary.
And SHIELD! How were they going to react to this?? They had no idea he was Spider-Man, nonetheless Tony Stark’s only child!
,” Wade replied ominously, wiggling his fingers against Peter’s skin and then he made eerie, “OooooOOOoooing” noises like a ghost.
“Pepper?” He asked, groggily lifting his head and opening his eyes. He was in a dark room and several feet to his right Pepper was strapped in a gurney wearing only a sports bra and yoga pants. Her skin was glowing slightly.
“It was more erotic than simply nice,” Tony teased, scooping water up to cover his arms. Steve cupped more water behind him and help pour some over Tony's back. His eyes trailed over Tony’s back, taking in the bruises left by his fingers.
“What did you think would happen?” Tony retorted angrily on his behalf. He had been just as worried and devastated as Steve had been when they got the alert.
Howard wanted to know why but, for once in his life, he didn’t demand answers. He could see Tony was in a delicate space and he whispered, “…Alright.”
with Steve, Tony decided to take a risk: he would drink at the Tower with Steve in the building. He held off on drinking all day and spent all his time with Steve. By the end of the night, Tony slipped away and told Steve to go to bed without him. Steve did but told him to not spend all night in the lab.
The doors opened to their apartment and he could hear Wade and Peter’s soft murmurs down the hall. Tony smiled to himself and let Steve lead him into their home and in the direction of the rest of their family.
Wade cupped Peter’s cheek and murmured, “You’d really be okay with it. After everything they’d already put you through? They’ll be even more focused on you once they find out about me. How will you keep Spider-Man a secret?”
Going on a hiatus again as I decide what to post next! I want to do another Soulmate AU  but I’m between doing another Stony or diving into some Spideypool....we'll see which ship prevails :D
“He’s too precious for this world,” Wade countered with his subconscious. “…My little Spidey- cinnamon-roll.” He smiled to himself and reminded himself, “He’s mine.”
Peter looked at Pepper with horror and gasped, “What happened?! Did one of the compounds we were working on explode?!”
They spent the rest of the night cuddling and sharing gentle kisses as they recalled that content feeling each other gave to the other. Tony’s worry lessened with every sweet touch.
He held Steve’s hands so tightly that his knuckles turned white and his muscles trembled. Tony gasped, “I-I love y-you.”
Bucky walked away before Bruce could say anything else. He went straight to Steve and met his gaze with eyes that were filled with turmoil.
They only stayed together for a year. Tony found out she was cheating on him and broke it off. He was devastated and Steve knew she was the cause of it as soon as they returned to a dark and dreary landscape.
Tony was snickering as he read the explanation but he stopped when his eye caught sight of the final image tucked into the corner of the fold out. It was meant to be a joke on the magazine’s part but it affected Tony all the same. The picture was of Steve and Tony standing close, both of them were wearing tuxes and Tony recognized it was from the gala they went to last month to support the city’s firefighters. He could not take his eyes off the blond that night. It was rare to see Steve in a tuxedo and looked so handsome in it.
Steve couldn’t help but chuckle, making Tony’s brows raise even higher and, with it, Tony’s facial expression also shifted. He was no longer looking at Steve with distrust and suspicion. He studied Steve like he was a puzzle that was hard to crack.
The rest of the week had been difficult. Natasha had accepted she would learn about James in stages as his memories slowly returned. But his unknown history as an American unnerved her. Her deepest darkest fear was that one day James would remember everything, remember becoming the Winter Solider was never his choice, and he’d realize that he hated her for what she was: an agent of the Academy, the organization that dehumanized him.
! What happened?” They pulled away from each other and Mary’s gaze fell and she appeared disheartened. Ben asked, “Mary?”
Peter pet the side of Wade's face, also smiling lightly at him. He whispered, “You get to go to my birthday today.”
Bucky distracted him by asking about his past. They went over the basics at first but Bucky was able to coax him into talking about their funnier escapades. He got Steve to laugh, drawing the first true grin he had seen from Bucky since the 1940s.
“Okay, make it ‘roar,’” Tony said. “The sonic vibrations from the ‘roar’ was probably what woke Steve.” Under his breath, Tony mumbled, “
“He is?!” Peter gasped excitedly, his shy nature toward Bucky totally evaporated and he looked to Steve with unabashed joy. Peter grabbed Steve’s dog-tags through his shirt and bounced in his arms. “When he coming home??”
The thought involuntarily struck him and Steve bit down on his lip. He should not be thinking about this right now. Peter needed all his concentration. That was all that mattered at that moment...but he could not help but feel dishonorable as he buckled Peter in.
He ran his fingers over the smooth stone. It was cold, nothing like Steve's warmth. Tony whispered, "There were a lot of things we both wished for between us but we didn’t get any of it so I guess that’s just the curse of our relationship…”
Thor nodded and Natasha directed the large man to carefully lift the unconscious man. In the moments they took to maneuver Barnes carefully, Tony took the time to share a private moment with his soulmate.
The dream was fading from his mind but he reflected on the desire he’d felt and flushed. Why does he keep dreaming this? It wasn’t right…He and Tony were friends, nothing more…
“My fiddling must have done something to it,” Tony murmured. His gaze flickered away and he added, “I…I just wanted to help out and
Once free of the armor, he leapt into the Audi and sped out of the garage. He calmly adjusted the gears as he went faster and, through the car’s audio system, he asked Jarvis, “You still have an eye on his guy?”
Tony obliged and turned his camera back on. They pressed closer to each other and Tony snapped a photo as they both smiled at the screen. Steve moved in, kissed his cheek, and Tony snapped another photo. Steve grasped the side of his face and drew his mouth to his prompting Tony to take another picture. As their kissing progressed, Tony was able to snap a few more photos before he dropped his phone and devoted his full attention to Steve.
Steve reached down and tentatively touched himself. Closing his eyes, he imagined Tony had done more than kiss him. He imagined it was not his hand rubbing himself but Tony’s hand and arousal vibrated through him in a powerful shudder as his hand copied what he imagined.
“You’re going to be a great hero, Peter,” Pops whispered into his ear. Peter grinned and looked past Pops’ shoulder to his other father.
Happy was waiting for him in one Tony’s cars and opened the door for him. Steve slid inside and released a deep sigh as he settled into the seat. His arm felt abnormally light and he felt exposed and weaker without the shield in his possession. He checked his phone but had no alerts and the communicator in his ear had been silent since he left.
Coulson paused, the paperwork in his hands suddenly feeling heavier and he wondered at the secrets he held and the hundreds more Fury kept from him. No, the work up was not all they wanted from the Captain. Any fool would be able to guess they wanted more. He was the world’s only perfect super soldier and they were the strongest defense organization. Of course they wanted him to work for them.
He walked a few rooms down to where Captain Rogers was sleeping. Like all the other rooms in the ICU, the Captain’s had a large window for one to easily look into.
He held out his hand to his son and Peter looked at it and then gradually slid his hand into Tony’s. Tony pulled him up and, together, they went downstairs.
Steve pushed himself up and peered down at himself. He was naked and his skin was the same ugly red and pink mesh from when he was last burned badly yet this time it seemed to cover his entire body. His flesh was tender and hurt but he easily ignored it in favor of the shock of coming back to life…again.
Ignoring Steve, Bucky leaned forward, towards Tony and murmured, “Now onto the subject of Steve’s virtue…”
James drew back to cup Natasha’s jaw and he stared into her gorgeous green eyes. He vowed, “Yes, there’s no one else I’d rather be with.”
Bruce, Scott, and Eddie Brock sat on the other couch, both of them were nursing drinks the ladies had made for them and discussing Venom’s physiology. Bruce was drinking what looked like a bright pink virgin margarita with five different variations of fruit sticking out of it, Scott had a Pina Colada with several large pineapple slices, whip, and a cherry on top, and Eddie had a multicolored daiquiri with a quarter of an orange skewered with an umbrella.
All his doubts disappeared as she pressed her lips against his. Her arms wrapped around his head and pulled him in deeper. He responded by curling his hand into her hair at the back of her head and drawing his other arm around her back to press her closer to him.
With a defeated expression, Peter climbed out of the pool and helped Steve pick Bucky up. Steve took the majority of his friend’s weight and Peter unhappily held his uncle’s feet. His friend could be out anywhere from a few minutes to an hour so he took him inside.
Internally, Tony’s mind was screaming with the truth. It was so very tempting to tell them.  To help them escape the horrors that awaited them. Because, it was one thing to read about the tragic heroes of the Howling Commandos, but…it’s a whole other to meet these
“And Wade, as for unhealthy things, I like hot Cheetos,” Tony said, grinning at Wade’s stunned expression.
Tony shook his head and said, “You look fine, Cap. Heck, you look like the dads they use to pose with the kids in the magazines!”
It was never a coincidence that his runs always led him past Tony’s house. He never approached the gates or paused across the street. He just ran by, making sure the Goblin wasn’t in sight and…and, a small part of him hoped he’d see Tony outside – even if it was just a passing glance.
Steve awkwardly ran his hand through his blond hair, dirty from dust and sweat from all the work he had been doing, and he said, “Tony…when you say you want us to be ‘casual,’ what does that mean?”
! Petey wasn’t this bold yesterday! Not that Wade was complaining…Wade gasped, “Keep moving like that baby boy and I won't be able to stop.” He already had Peter’s shirt half off with the first shift of Peter’s hips against his. One hand was already stroking one of Peter’s nipples and the other was fingering at the waistband of Peter’s jeans.
Tony laughed again and grasped the collar of Steve’s robe to give his assent and draw him into another kiss.
Loki paled as Hulk’s rage focused on him. He straightened his overcoat and whispered, “I believe I saw enough. I think I shall move on, brother.”
The only way they could feed was if Venom was in control. But Venom was a symbiote. He was supposed to only provide his host with the additional strength of his dark body. In return, his host was supposed to feed him. By taking control, Venom was depleting strength that was never supposed to be used.
Steve’s intense gaze raked down his body and focused on where his hips were obscured beneath the water.
Venom turned to the source of the voice. A massive, green beast stood at one end of the sewer. For a moment, Venom thought it was the Hulk, returned to attack him again, but then he noticed the beast’s eyes glowed red not green.
He took off the bandages on his head next and blinked open his left eye. His vision was watery and blurred at first but returned to normal after a few blinks.
Steve lifted his head and met Tony’s eyes. Tony held his gaze as he lowered his head and lightly sucked at the head of hic cock. Steve bit down on his fist to muffle his groan but he kept his eyes connected with Tony. With his mouth still on Steve’s prick, Tony smirked and, without any warning, swallowed Steve whole. Steve shuddered and he moaned loudly, unable to muffle it this time. He almost threw his head back again from the sensation and bucked his hips but Tony placed his hand on Steve abdomen to control his movements. Steve kept his eyes latched onto Tony’s dark gaze and felt trapped in its wicked attention.
Bruce smirked and asked, “Remember the codename Hydra gave Peter? Well I think he is going to be more than alright. In fact, when he’s older and wants to join the Avengers, I think it would be more than appropriate for him to use that old codename and call himself ‘Spiderman’…”
Bucky and Gabe were waiting outside and, as soon as he appeared, Gabe went back in, to keep an eye on Tony.
Pepper picked up on the second ring, her face filling his screen. Her mouth was downturned in a frown and her eyes narrowed as soon as they focused on him. Behind her was the Manhattan cityscape, by its position, Tony knew she was in her office. Without a greeting, Pepper stated, “Tony, why did you let them take a picture of you two when Steve was in that state?? Is he okay?”
They both chuckled but then Tony turned back to him and said, “My dad is looking for you. Your picture is all over his study…I never really noticed until I looked through his old scrapbook.”
“Tell me everything you remember. Then tell me what you want to ask her and I will do it,” Steve promised, leaning forward with excitement. This was nothing like he had expected their conversation to go. They both felt similarly and there was no heartache between them.
The man had shot Steve in the spine, paralyzing him but not killing him. Steve was still aware when he fell and had heard the horror in Tony’s voice when he called out to him. He also knew they knocked out Tony and Schmidt told his men to leave Tony and Bucky behind. Schmidt had said something about his soldier needing to complete a mission and Steve feared for his soulmate.
But Bucky hit it again and the blue light flickered for a second and Howard paused in reaching out to him. With his heart in his throat, Bucky hit it again and the light returned.
“Are you Captain America!?” Her boy gasped. His eyes twinkled with excitement and reminded Steve of Peter.
Steve put his hands on his hips, wearing a frown Tony was starting to become oh-too familiar with in the weeks since he met Steve, and his mate stated, “You’re wearing an undershirt as protection for your torso? Where are the gloves? The fire-retardant clothing?”
Steve chuckled lightly and shook the debris off of the comforter as Tony began to remove his armor. Steve said, “I knew there was a reason you insisted on sleeping with me.”
“Hem hem,” broke Peter free from his haze. He looked to the front of the car where a red-faced Happy was watching them from the car’s middle mirror. With Peter’s attention on him, Happy asked, “Where to Sirs?”
Fury was a man of information. He needed to know everything in order to properly do his job. It was for the good of his country and the world at large that he is kept informed. So when he was told a consultant, known to be hostile and belligerent, was knowingly hiding a super soldier from him, it made Fury suspicious.
“You are an awesome friend,” Tony whispered. With a voice he fought hard to keep steady but failed miserably at, Tony whispered, “I-I think I need some alone time with him.”
Tony’s fingers dug into the flesh of his arm. He couldn’t imagine hurting Steve the way this man did his own soulmate. Natasha’s neck was swollen and was the grisly colors of black and blue.
Later that night, in the ruins of the Tower, Tony snapped the sheets to their bed, trying to get off the debris that had settled there. He already patched up the hole in the ceiling but the building was going to need a lot more tender, loving care to get back to her former glory.
The flash drive Fury had entrusted to Steve was hidden at the hospital he had died in and they went there first. During the flight over, Steve told Tony how Fury broke into his place late last night and alluded that there were listening devices in his place and that there was something wrong at SHIELD before he’d been shot. Steve went after the assassin but was unable to catch him.
He felt like he was overreaching. Natasha was enough. He shouldn’t have Steve’s friendship nor be given a home. He did not deserve it.
He was soon completely enclosed in a cocoon. Light was still leaking through as the shield was opaque enough in some places. Peter stated, “I think it’s encasing me in an all-encompassing shield for better protection...”
Her onetime teacher was a man of little words. He did not lament his soulmate trying to kill him. Nor did he demand reasoning to her actions. He too crouched into a stance and then propelled himself forward with the knife raised.
He gently pulled Steve away from the door and whispered, “The most marvelous man in existence invited me into his bed and is looking at like I am the answer to everything…and I still can't believe this is real.”
Steve had flown to Washington D.C. on a red eye and got a few hours of sleep before meeting the President after Ellis’s brunch with a local senator. Thanks to the serum, he barely felt the effect of his lapse in sleep.
One by one, he went up to each group, thanking them and saying goodnight. Some of the last he saw were his parents. Both men hugged him and his dad held him in an especially long embrace. Peter returned it with just as much feeling his dad put into it. Usually, he would be embarrassed by his dad’s over-emotional reaction but today was different. Just two days ago, he’d wondered if he’d make it to his birthday.
Steve went through the flames and was moving so fast he felt nothing, no heat or pain. The ground was racing up to meet him. The countless falling drills he practiced with Natasha raced through his mind and he tried to angle his body for the best hit.
Whenever he came across someone, he’d ask if he was going in the right direction. Most didn’t know where Tony lived but then he came across an older man, with a dark aviator glasses and a baseball cap with the word Excelsior! on it, watering his flowers, and he was able to point Steve in the right direction. Steve rounded a corner and stumbled to a halt when he saw the structure in the distance. It was nestled between cliffs and practically right on the ocean. No one was around the house as it was on a piece of land with high cliffs and no coastal access but that was it, it was Tony’s home.
“Yeah,” Steve whispered. Pepper had already warned him of the extreme reaction he should expect from the press. It was going to be so much more different from the laid back press junkets he was used to during World War II.
Years ago, their roles were reversed. She was the one holding the gun and about to kill him. She raised her hands like he had and begged, “Please, James. Fight it. I know you don’t want this. You want me –
“Why are they doing that?” Peter whispered to Bucky, drawing Steve back to the situation. Bucky affectionately rubbed the top of Peter’s head as Steve and Tony separated.
Tony hummed in agreement and his own hands made their way up Steve’s chest and then he cupped Steve’s jaw as he brought him level for another kiss.
Tony frowned, no longer in a joking mood. He ran his tongue over the back of his teeth as he regarded Pepper. She was the only one who knew everything about him with the exception of his true feelings toward Steve.
Peter stupidly wondered why his Spidey-Sense did not go off as his mind dizzily spun and his hold on the symbiote slipped. Venom hovered over him and hissed, “Separation means death and death will be the only thing to part us.”
Steve surged forward and kissed him again. Tony staggered a little under the push but he readily wrapped his arms around Steve and returned the kiss.
“Yes! Bruce! This is Peter and Peter this is Dr. Bruce Banner,” Tony gasped excitedly, glad to have something to say.
Steve inhaled a long, deep, calming breath and then replied, “I’m fine, Jarvis. It’s just a nightmare.”
Tony paused and he smiled suddenly as he flushed from his praise. Tony said, “It’s no problem, Cap.”
It was a constant fear for Peter…but, after Venom, hiding his identity didn’t seem so important. What was important was what’d he lose in his obsession in keeping his identity secret, whether it was losing himself to Venom’s control or losing Wade because he worried more over his identity than their relationship.
Steve was watching the President walk up the stairs to Air Force One when the Iron Patriot finally arrived. His heart lurched slightly as he looked upon the suit’s familiar design. If it weren’t for the gun mounted on the back and the patriotic paint job, the suit could pass for Iron Man. He may have been upset with Tony for doing this alone but he still missed him and he hated that the last time he saw him was after Steve told him he had willingly kissed Bucky.
The sunset played out before them and the city lights blinked on, one by one. Even though there were barely any clouds out, the stars were few. The city was bright enough to obstruct the light of the night sky. It was still warm as the cool of night had yet to blanket the city but Peter found himself leaning into the other man’s side.
“How come you never told us? Told me?” Steve asked. He sat down heavily on one of the remaining barstools at the counter. His healing fractured legs could not no longer support him but he was so shocked by this new development he would not have been able to stand as it was.
“Sir is having a similar reaction,” Jarvis dryly commented and Steve grinned at the ceiling where the voice emitted.
Natasha smirked and nodded before looking out the window one last time and then slipping back out. She was probably going to do a perimeter sweep or meet up with Clint. Steve did not question her actions as he was more distracted by the man bleeding by his side.
. This beast, he and his host inherently knew to be the source of all their hunger and hurts. For a moment, Venom was tempted only to kill, not just to consume but just to end the beast’s life.
He gulped back the sick feeling and reminded himself this was why he was in this era, to save Peter and all the others lost to the dusting.
Steve remembered Tony moaning after taking a bite of a sinfully good burger and the memory of noise tipped Steve over the edge.
As he thought on it, he realized months had passed since they’d move into the Tower. Peter’s third birthday would be in another two months. His boy was growing up.
“The cameras in this section have been purposely turned off,” Jarvis informed him. The suit let go of him and Jarvis inspected his wound. “Tissue damage only. No organ, bone, or vessel damage. I estimate three stiches needed.”
Peter laughed and slipped out of bed. Wade was going to ask him what he was doing when all of a sudden…
Edwards had been the last name Tony used in the past and now Steve would adopt it for his own. It was almost appropriate as he was going to marry the man one day and most married people share a last name...they never had the chance to discuss what they were going to do. If they'd only been engaged more than a couple of hours before all of this, then they may had found the time to discuss it...
“No,” Steve replied and Tony’s relieved smile fell. Steve quickly explained, “That thing down there, it’s called Venom, and Peter is trapped inside it. It’s trying to become one with him! We need to separate them before it’s too late!”
Steve brushed back Tony’s hair one more time and whispered to him alone, “I love you.” He drew his hand back then jumped to his feet and turned to Natasha. He stated, “Help Clint. The Goblin hasn’t fought with you yet so he does not know your weaknesses. I will help Thor.”
“It works, Pete…” Steve sighed. He sat down on the couch and grasped Peter’s hands, pulling his son closer to him. His eyes couldn’t help but fall down on Peter’s exposed soul implant and had to force himself to hold back his smile. Peter had less than seven years until he met his soulmate. He’d still be a teenager when he got to meet his soulmate. It was nothing like the amount of time he and Tony had to wait until they could meet and he was so happy for his child.
Peter glanced down at his glassware, feeling a wave of gratitude toward Eddie. He looked back to his friend and said, “I’m good, unless you need a break?”
“Alright, Avengers, move out!” Steve yelled. He and Tony ran to his lab where Tony’s suit was and Steve’s uniform and shield were. Bruce went to the elevator and was already beginning to look green.
Tony closed the distance between them in a few steps and fell to his knees in front of him. He wrapped his arms around Steve’s waist and lay his head on his lap. Steve put one hand on his head and the other grasped Tony’s shoulder tightly.
A flurry of clicks were made by the reporters’ cameras and Tony continued, “He came to me to help him start a new life. His upmost fear was that he would be spirited away and experimented on. Sadly, his fears became true and this morning he was forcibly removed from my home by a government agency by the name of SHIELD.
They did not stay in the community room all day however. Steve continued to take Peter out daily, mostly to Central Park, but he also took him to places like Cooney Island or along the piers. They would always walk to these places and Peter would marvel at the skyscrapers towering over them. He loved them most of all and would always build a mini city out of his blocks.
“Tony is in pain and is throwing himself at the Mandarin so he can escape it through anger,” Steve hissed. “He is not thinking about the risk. He’s a danger to himself right now!”
Natasha’s eyes fell on him and she studied him for a moment before saying, “They want their Captain back and the world’s only perfect super soldier to be under their control and out of enemy hands.”
Tony was the odd man out, floating above it all. The new fighters didn’t notice him as none of them thought to look up.
“Oh, Stars and Stripes,” Tony gasped, his fingers dug into Steve’s scalp as his hot mouth engulfed Tony’s cock. When Tony gasped, Steve’s only response was to suck him off harder.
Tony released a deep sigh and nearly face-planted into the pancakes. Okay, he can do that too. He'd rather pretend the kiss never happened than lose his friendship with Steve.
Steve expected an ambush, even booby-traps. He was tense and battle ready. Everything was so quiet and his heart was hammering so loudly in his ears that it seemed as if it was drowning out all other sound.
Tony moaned from Bruce’s jostling which was a good sign. Natasha watched Bruce as he pulled apart the suit. Jarvis was directing him how to via the communicator.
The other woman stepped beside his mom then knelt in front of Peter to his level. She began to unscrew the cylinder and all of Peter’s senses were screaming at him to run away as fast as he could.
Peter’s entire chest jerked like it was impacted by a sharp javelin. He gripped Wade’s hand tighter and Wade did the same.
The gun fire stopped again and was followed by a long pause. The three of them shifted nervously and James darkly wondered what was coming next.
Steve murmured, “I’m sure whatever is going through that big, glorious brain of yours is absolutely right, dear.”
“I know…” Steve sighed, casting his gaze back to Tony.  Beginning from the moment he met him, Tony had fascinated him. The man was smart, funny, handsome, and…without even trying, he gave Steve something he never even knew he wanted.
Peter nodded and Pepper worriedly eyed him before pressing a light kiss onto his forehead, collecting the papers, and leaving him alone.
“Holy shit,” Peter gasped, instantly awake. He sat up sharply and dug his fingers into Wade's scalp.
Hundreds of miles from where Steve Rogers was learning about the new century he found himself in, Tony was learning about a whole new world.
The monster was already responsible for over a dozen deaths. If they or SHIELD could not contain him then the only other option was to destroy him.
Tony groaned and carded his hands into Steve’s scalp. He thrust his hips into Steve’s chest, enjoying the additional friction. Steve eye’s look up to him and, from his position so close to Tony’s waist, Tony could easily imagine what Steve would look like sucking him off.
“Ste—?” Was all Tony was able to get out before Steve bent his neck and silenced him with a kiss. He lightly traced his fingers up his throat and Tony’s Adam’s apple bobbed beneath his touch as he gulped. Tony readily returned the kiss, spurred on by his excitement for their son.
Tony's heart seized as his powerful emotions built up to quickly for him. This was his son. He was a young man now and missed out on
He was suddenly pushed forward at a higher rate with the boost and, once he was close enough, he turned the thrusters on Steve’s opponent. The sand beast screamed and turned on Tony with a roar. Steve was released with the Sandman’s change of direction, and he fell to his knees as he gasped for air.
As Tony settled back onto the bed and looked up at his super soldier, he realized from now on, when Tony woke in the morning, Steve would be by his side. He'd wake up to this man every morning, smiling in a way that practically radiated with his love for him. The very thought made Tony smile.
He only lost the momentum when he was able to see the balcony through the glass and…and then see him.
On one of those night, Tony asked him about sex and Steve, somewhat mortified to be talking about it, told Tony all he knew, which wasn’t much. Oral sex was the furthest he’d ever gone with a girl and she’d been the one doing all the work…He basically was still a virgin, which he haltingly revealed to Tony.
“I’m going to be a super villain from now on!” Tony growled as soon as Pepper appeared from the elevator. As she hit the security latch on the back of neck, and as Tony sat up, he hissed, “My first mission as a villain will be to take SHIELD down.”
Tony hummed in agreement then stopped rubbing his cock against Steve’s as he pulled back. He slowly trailed kisses down his thighs and murmured, "It'll be easier on you if I take you from behind. You should turn around."
The only thing he could save was the machine that would take him home and there was no way he was going to let a younger, less seasoned version of his father poke around in it.
Steve sat at the middle of the table and lawyers sat on both sides of him and a few stood behind him as if they were creating a protective barrier around him. Strangely, it was comforting to have these people around him.
Peter nodded and stepped onto the tops of his dad’s feet and then wound his arms around his neck. Tony wrapped a single arm around Peter’s torso and then murmured, “Ready?”
Which was why he had been looking for a good picture of them…he wanted to present it to Peter when he – well, he…
Steve returned the pen to the cup and then looked questionably at the woman then to Tony. Tony looked to the women and raised his brows in question.
“I’ll be sure to remember that next time you exhaustedly fuck me flat into the floor,” Tony replied dryly. Steve grinned and kept rubbing at his back and kneading the muscles. Tony leaned into the touch with a groan. His muscles were melting under Steve’s deft hands.
She pulled away from her gun and sat up. She pulled out her phone and her thumb hovered over Coulson’s number but she paused.
“D-Da-a-ad?” The mangled word passed through those elongated fangs but Tony had been able to understand it and, by the shocked silence from the team, everyone else seemed to understand it too. Even Bruce, froze in his search and looked up at the screens with shocked eyes.
Tony crossed his arms over his chest and stubbornly stated, “The future is not written in stone. Despite all our precautions, my presence is changing it as we speak. For all we know, it’s already changed. Maybe when I get back to the future, Captain Steve Rogers will be the first man in line to marry his partner when it gets legalized in New York.”
“That was actually why I came here. I couldn’t really talk to you about it because I was wondering how’d you like to join us on the patrol but Howard was here. Do you want to go as an ordinary soldier? Or Iron Man?”
Neither one of his fathers knew what the colors represented to Peter, and he did not plan on telling him anytime in the near future. They probably would have demanded he take the black off. As it was, he had no idea how Pops was going to react to his mask, it took him ages to convince Dad to let him include it in the design.
“I hope he can sleep through the rest of the night…” Steve sighed, dragging the both of them to the bed. Tony leaned into Steve and let the super soldier practically carry him.
,” Tony teased. “And I didn’t plan for it to happen that way…I would have never done that had I known we were being watched.”
“What’s up?” Clint asked. He looked from the open cell to Tony’s open Iron Man suit in question. Behind him, Natasha’s eyes were latched onto the open door.
Peter continued to smile at him but Wade swore he could see Peter’s eyes glow with more love at his words. Peter leaned in and Wade met him halfway to share a kiss that was as strong with love as he had seen in Peter’s gaze.
when you finally have kids, and later grandkids, never let him sit alone because he will think of me and it will make him sad…”
He thrust his fingers into him a few more times then added a forth. Steve thrust fervently into Tony’s hand, wanting more.
“You promised to be nice to each other today!” Peter stated, tears forming in his eyes. Harry stood behind him and was shooting glares at everyone involved in the fight.
Tony groaned and the sky above them became pitch black, like the blackness Steve experienced when Tony was awake…the same blackness he’d lived with for years before he met Tony. What did it mean?? Tony couldn't be -!
“The power that came with it…not just the defensive ability…but the power it gave you too,” Eddie whispered, staring down at the moving world stories beneath them. “I felt like I could do anything…”
Tony sighed in relief and Steve grasped his hand. Tony turned to his soulmate with a smile. Steve smiled back and then turned and stated to everyone, “And next to fall will be Hydra, but first…can someone find me some proper pants?”
Tony grumbled indignantly again and Steve could have sworn he heard something about AC/DC but Tony’s pillow stayed firmly beneath his head. Steve cuddled up to him and sighed contently before letting himself relax back into sleep.
They pulled back just enough so Peter’s hand remained on Tony’s chest and Tony grinned at his son. Tony quickly glanced up at Steve through his dark eye lashes and Steve’s heart flipped in his chest. His breath caught in his throat and he gulped it back.
After that exchange, Tony acted like nothing ever happened and had even hopped into Steve’s bed their first night back in the Tower. He had not known Peter was in the bed with him but rolled with it. The three of them slept through the night with Peter nestled between them and Steve and Tony connected by their pressed foreheads and interlocked hands resting on Peter’s belly.
“Harry!” Tony called out to the boy as several holograms appeared in front of him. He asked, “What does she do for your father?”
Tony smirked, ran the tips of his fingers down Steve’s arm, and whispered as sensuously as he could, “Stuff.”
With Natasha, the Soldier began to learn the meaning of peace. He’d grown used to a ridged, routine life and always being on his guard. He was not used to having someone he could trust to have his back. He found it relaxed the muscles in his upper back from their usual tense tightness and helped him sleep easier.
Tony sent Jarvis to work searching the city’s cameras for Steve’s uniform or the Winter Soldier’s metal arm. It was reminiscent of the time Tony had fruitlessly searched for the shield.
It was so sudden and normal that Peter actually laughed aloud. Hanging out and playing video games sounded like something he used to do on the weekends with his friends. A quick glance at the TV console told him Wade had only the best and was probably an avid gamer.
“Yes, Sir,” Jarvis replied and Iron Man’s arm lifted and pointed its repulsor at the bullet wound in his chest. Tony bit down on his lip and Jarvis fired a blast from the repulsor. Tony strangled his immediate scream in his throat so Steve wouldn’t hear it.
Stark had been harassing SHIELD for weeks for documentation on Project Rebirth. Fury had just assumed Stark was using it to annoy him but now he could not help but wonder if he had ulterior motives.
Howard bit down on his lip and then carefully turned the reactor until it clicked free. As he slowly pulled it out of Tony’s chest a tiny puff of smoke escaped drawing a curse from Jim. The smoke was coming from the reactor again Howard’s fingers shook slightly as he turned it over and released the Palladium core.
He stepped out of the elevator and immediately pinpointed the sound of Stark and Potts whispering urgently to each other in the other room. His eyes quickly ran over the penthouse, looking for changes since he was last there. All the ceiling lights were installed and working now, a couch sat where particle board was once stacked, and there was a large pair of sneakers sitting by the elevator doors.
Tony gently laid Peter next to Steve and the toddler mumbled something in his sleep. Steve’s gaze was immediately drawn to his boy and he gently wrapped an arm around Peter, drawing him into his side. Tony placed a hand on Steve’s arm and Steve flinched.
Peter dropped his package and grasped his shirt as forcefully as he could, pulling it tightly across the back of his neck. He broke himself from the man’s hold and slammed himself into the glass to escape. He heard it crack behind him but he didn’t notice as he was too busy staring at the man in horror.
Peter, still catching his breath, turned to the others and gasped, “It’s protecting itself! Go! When it feels safe it’ll back down!”
They’d already gone over what to expect but Steve was still blown away by the response to his appearance on stage. People screamed and cheered and when he meekly waved they only grew louder. They quieted only once he started to speak. He briefly explained how he came to New York (SHIELD was going to release a more detailed statement later that day) and thanked the city for its exuberance. He didn’t take any questions from reporters but as he left the stage they tried to get a comment. Because all of them were yelling at once, he could not understand any of them and was unable to answer.
Steve went to the beach. He stuck his feet under the hot sand and sat down to watch the tide. His eyes were ultimately drawn north and he saw the familiar shape of the cliff Tony’s home was situated on. He smiled at it bitterly but made no move to get any closer to it.
Steve and Tony waited off stage as the host was teasing the audience with the coming of surprise guests. Makeup artists swooped in and put some last minute touches on both of them. Tony talked and teased both women with ease. Steve fidgeted like he was having a seizure and was too nervous to even make polite conversation.
“Yes! Let’s go save Petey!” The stranger held up his hand with a large looking clock face on it and hit it.
As soon as their gazes met, Steve’s eyes were searching his, for what, Tony could only guess at…because, before he could find whatever it was he was looking for, Bucky butted in.
Her eyes became glassy with unshed tears but she had the largest smile on her face as she wrapped her arms behind his head and kissed him. He picked her up and led her to the bedroom feeling like the happiest and luckiest man alive.
“True, it would break the internet!” Tony chuckled. He pressed into Steve and thought back to his statements to the press. His mood darkened with threat of the trial looming over Steve. What if Steve was charged guilty? What kind of future would he have then? He whispered, “I want to be with you, Steve…I will always stay by your side…no matter what.”
The medical examiner’s jaw dropped and he stared at the photo Marcel held with shock. Marcel continued, “We do not have an exact date for the ‘rape’ nor do we have any video from Captain Rogers’ private rooms but Mr. Stark has surveillance of the rest of the buildings. He also has video of Ms. Tyler entering and leaving his Tower wearing her uniform throughout her entire employment. We also have surveillance of Ms. Tyler putting the Avengers’ trash into her vehicle, including Captain Rogers’ trash. She could have easily attained his sample through there. So, in your expert opinion, is it sufficive to say Ms. Tyler most likely took a sample of Captain Rogers’ DNA, after he had consensual sex with his partner and had thrown away the excess DNA? Could she have put that same sample on one of her dresses and cried rape?”
Other versions of the robot were crawling over his parents’ half of the car. Steve pushed Tony behind him and then punched out one of the robots. Tony wouldn’t be able to join in the fight because the suit he had in this car was underneath the seat Peter was sitting on.
Across the field, the Norman Osborn sat up with an angry huff. He’d lost consciousness for only a few seconds and the goblin formula was already wearing off because of it. He was in his puny human shell again. He only had one more canister of the formula left. He needed to make it last and count...but even with the formula, he knew he was no match for two of the strongest members of the Avengers.
He tentatively touched Wade’s tongue with his own. The merc hummed happily and sucked Peter’s tongue into his mouth. Peter squeaked in surprise but moaned when Wade’s tongue caressed his.
“Onnneeeee,” Venom reminded him with a hiss and stalked toward the cage. The boy made no objections but watched his father with a hungry gaze through their shared eyes.
Barnes’ fingers twitched and, for a moment, Tony thought he was going to do it, he was going to tell them. But then his dark blue eyes snapped up and he whispered to Tony, “Hail, Hydra.”
With a hard expression, he turned around and strode out of the elevator. Pepper, Tony, and a few of his lawyers stood near the main desk. Partitions had been raised in front of the windows blocking their view of the outside to keep the reporters from looking in. He could hear them however, their clangor was loud and constant since he stepped out of the elevator.
Wade’s stomach gurgled in his ear and Peter chuckled. He pulled back and looked up to Wade. He said, “Let’s get out of here and get something to eat.”
“So am I to call you Stripper-Man instead of Spider-Man?” Dad teased and Peter’s face flushed bright red.
“No delays,” Tony replied. “I’ll be done by next week. Can we get approval from the city for an early connection?”
Bucky suddenly laughed, throwing back his head from the mirth. He looked back to Tony and murmured, “For a mad scientist, you are alright.”
“I suddenly have the strangest urge to complain about morning sickness,” Tony chuckled, raising his phone.
Tony nodded and whispered, “Coulson says he’s been missing too long. He says we need to involve the local government agencies in the search now…As it is, people know something major is up with everything I have in the air around the city…The news organizations are going crazy with their theories…But Coulson thinks it will help.”
He smiled warmly one last time at that marble face and then walked to where Natasha and Bucky were standing by the water.
Steve broke the kiss and murmured, “Now what was this thing about super soldiers snuggling with billionaire geniuses?”
Tony beefed up security around the Tower and the metal shudders on the floors they all lived in had not risen since the initial attack. Steve no longer took Peter outside on the balcony and his boy soon complained about wanting to go outside.
Peter glanced down at his hands with a flush. He had wrapped both his hands around one of Wade’s unconsciously and locked them together with doubly carded fingers. He didn’t let go of Wade and Wade lightly squeezed his hand and smiled sweetly at Peter. Peter smiled back, knowing his face was an open book, portraying to MJ how much he loved this man.
Her trembling stopped and then she punched Schmidt again. Steve winced but Natasha spun on her heel and left Schmidt hanging uselessly in Hulk’s arms. She returned to Thor’s side and lightly touched Barnes’ head. Tony’s fists tingled and he wanted to get a shot in but Steve squeezed his side. One look at his soulmate and Tony knew he wouldn’t leave his side or he’d fall without his aide.
All the local street kids knew breaking into his place meant a bucket load of pain so who was the idiot doing it? Wade picked up his bucket of knives and went to find the intruder.
The pleasant feeling from his ejaculation continued to linger and Steve’s confliction grew. How could something wrong feel so good?
“Then could you ask him if he would like to join me and Peter for an outing? We could sneak past the reporters.”
grade photo album and was thoroughly embarrassing him. He was a hotdog for Halloween that year apparently…”
Tony’s chest deflated and he closed the hologram he just opened. He should have expected this moment. Sighing heavily, he ran his hand through his hair and whispered, “…Yeah, you did…”
Eddie bit down on his lip with a conflicted expression and then said, “I just…I just wanted to apologize for everything on behalf of me and…and Venom.”
Tony jerked and nearly dropped his phone but there was no use in hiding it. Peter was awake and he had seen it, seen Steve.
“Sir?” Jarvis called out from his phone speakers. Tony pulled it out of his pocket and Jarvis stated, “Both instances created shockwaves, invisible to the human eye, and with abnormal power signatures. I noted both occurrences in the logs though, at the time, I thought them no more than the usual seismic events of the planet.”
“Schmidt is here,” Steve gasped over the communicators. Steve had fallen into the opposite wall and he was staring at him like he was a ghoul.
“I think you need to go back to the press barricades and report on the attack, not gossip,” Steve retorted sharply. The young man in his arms grunted in agreement.
“Thank God,” Tony sighed. Upon Joe’s scared expression, Tony explained, “I am an American who was brought here against my will. I’m on your side. Okay, my countrymen! Stand down, I got this!”
Everything was frozen together in the concave of his shield. He dug it all out and, even with the protection of his thermal gloves, the cold bit into his skin and numbed his fingers painfully.
Steve jogged to his bedroom and as soon as he left the room he overheard Pepper begin to question Tony in harsh whispers.
“Just create the lather for me before I back out!” Tony said and sat down stubbornly at the desk. He set up the mirror in front of him and stared at the reflection of his beautiful goatee for the last time. He was a little embarrassed by his lack of knowledge but more uneasy at the thought of actually shaving off all of his facial hair. It'd been decades since he was last bare faced.
“Do you think he has another time machine out there?” Steve asked nervously. Schmidt could do a lot of damage if he had the ability to change time.
Tony laughed and grabbed Steve’s chin, putting a stop to his kisses. Tony teased, “Not that I don’t love the compliments, but your kiss will do for now, beloved.”
Bucky clenched his fists but clenched down on his frustrated words too to keep Howard’s attention on the core. It felt like it took an eternity for Howard connect the welder and the core and even longer for him to begin fusing the metal.
Steve’s eyes fell on the mark and knew he shouldn’t but he could not help but he aroused by it. He peered at it possessively and licked his lips as he remembered the salty tang of Tony’s skin.
Wade grasped Peter’s jaw and drew him into one more lasting kiss before he broke away. Almost frantically, he opened and dug into his bedside table. Peter lazily kissed along his neck and his fingers trailed under his shirt. It was an amazingly, horrible distraction.
“Good morning, beloved,” Tony whispered, his voice still scratchy with sleep. Steve opened his eyes and found Tony propped up by his elbow and gazing down at him. Tony continued, “Or rather, I should say, good afternoon.”
Dum Dum was the last to arrive, adjusting his favorite bowler hat and smiling apologetically. The team was quick to move out once he was there. Steve had Tony keep close to him to make sure he really could handle the gun and to better help him understand how their team worked out on the field. He and Tony walked side-by-side whereas the rest of the team took their usual combing formation, stretching out and putting a large gap between each member but still staying within sight of one another.
Steve stepped away from the grill and looked at them anxiously. Tony’s face was hard but he looked like he was ready for a battle.
Tony had seen him naked numerous times but every time he treated Steve as if he was a precious piece of art. The way he was looking at him right made Steve’s toes curl and his breathing shallow.
Steve bit down on the inside of his lip as he remembered his fiancé. He asked, “So…We’re in the past now? Tony…Tony is alive in this era?”
Rogers stared blankly at him for a few seconds as if he could not comprehend Peter was sitting there. He leaned forward and gripped this coffee cup tightly.
Steve tightened his hold on Peter and his right shoulder twinged with a burning pain that flared with the sudden moment and his head spun from the slight movement. He still had bullets in his flesh. He gritted his teeth as his wounds reopened and his head began to pound more furiously. Tony’s frown deepened when he saw Steve’s pain.
. His fingers trailed against his warm skin and Steve’s breathing became more shallow as his fingers came within centimeters of his sex.
Steve picked up is son to comfort him and a millisecond later pain flared on the back of his arm and shoulder that held Peter. If Steve had not reached out to him Peter would have been hit. Steve fell forward and cradled Peter to his chest in a protective cocoon of his arms.
Pepper was in charge of protecting Tony, Steve, and now Peter’s public images. In other words, she was supposed to know anything vital that may draw public attention.
Peter replied to Wade’s statement incoherently with a noise that was comprised of a combined grumble and moan.
Schmidt drew a knife from his side and held Steve’s left arm tightly as he stated, “Soul implants are extremely hard to remove but…”
mission on the directive. What if he really was not interested in the fact that they were soulmates? What if this was only a mission?
Next week: Ch. 7 Tyler the Liar (the preliminary hearing occurs and the Avengers finally meet the woman who started all of this)
Steve laughed until Tony’s hands wrapped around Steve’s. They jerked each other off together and Steve leaned in to continue kissing him until they unraveled. Tony came first and Steve quickly followed with a few quick jerks.
Steve pushed himself forward, expecting to run straight at the villains in a surprise assault. Instead, he sprinted a yard before his eyes caught up with his feet and, as a result, tripped over his own feet. Natasha skidded to a halt and raised her weapon. Steve sensed more than saw the others stop and felt them wait for his command.
Peter grinned at them and, at that moment, for the first time, in a long, long time, all the depression and pain disappeared. Peter felt safe and
” Tony whispered and then kissed him gently. Steve melted into his embrace and cupped Tony’s face to better kiss him.
Steve could feel his eyes heating as he stared down at this frail version of the man he so loved. What was worse though was he did not know where the upset was coming from. Was it because Tony was wasting away or that he had let Bucky die?...Or maybe it was both...
“Which you clearly want to be a part of,” Natasha observed silently. She did not look up from her plate and calmly asked, “Shall I punch you in the face like James or threaten your manhood like Stark?”
But, on the other hand, was Tony. A man out of time whose future was now tied with theirs in more ways than one. Steve had been so obviously attracted to the man that, when Tony showed interest, Bucky practically shoved Steve in his direction because his best friend deserved to love and be loved in return at least once in his life.
In that year, Steve and Tony lived like any other couple, they laughed, they fought, they cried, they loved…in other words, they lived and grew closer.
“…Then what the fuck did he do? Why are you so quiet? Why do you look like somebody killed a cute, baby bunny in front of you?” Tony growled. He was not looking at Steve but was glaring straight ahead at nothing in particular. Steve gulped. Tony read him like a book. He knew something happened.
– Oh, my God,” Steve gasped, his arms shaking now to hold him up in his half sitting up position. Tony grinned, loving the way his lover was losing his composure at his stroking touch.
Steve parted from Peggy without another word and ran to Howard’s tent. He was happy no one else was hovering by. Word was already spreading throughout the camp that Tony had been inflicted with a mysterious injury. Jacques and Dum Dum had already inquired with him about Tony’s condition and he knew the remaining Commandos were not going to be far behind.
“The state of your clothes and the way your scarfing down that food are good indicators,” he replied with a smirk. He held out his hand and said, “Folks around here call me Solo.”
After he finished loading the dishes in the washer, Steve picked up his son and they walked Ben downstairs to the garage.
from me.” He looked back to her, his dark eyes revealed a storm of emotions that seemed to be overwhelming him.
“It’s not your fault,” Tony whispered to him, his thumb rubbing small circles into his back. “The Goblin took her there, he meant to hurt her, and he put her in danger. You were only trying to save her…There’s only so much we can do. We’re superheroes, Peter. We’ve saved so many lives that we have lost count. But it’s the lives that we could not save are the lives that affect us. What you experienced was worse…Gwen was not just another person to be saved. She was someone you clearly loved."
Steve squeezed Tony’s arms and then murmured, “Let me help you out of those clothes and we can snuggle up and get warm in the bed. Then maybe in the dream world we can imagine somewhere nice to go, maybe that tropical beach you went to in the second year of college?”
“You definitely got to see the Iron Man suit,” Peter whispered to his best friend. “But you also have to see
If he was remembering last night correctly, the pressure on his other arm was where Natasha was sleeping; Bruce was sleeping snuggled up to his mate, Betty, on one end of the couch; Clint was laying on the other end of the couch by Steve, with Steve’s tie wrapped around his head, which was currently tickling Steve’s forehead; and, last but not least, the mighty Thor was curled into a happy ball in the space between Steve and Natasha’s legs.
Tony turned toward her voice and, instead of seeing his aunt, he saw the blurred butt of a rifle butt coming straight at him. Tony instinctively fell back but he still got hit against his cheekbone. He felt like his face crumbled and he fell to his knees with a pained shout.
Steve turned his head to look down at his mate and murmured, "You are so bad at following the rules." He sighed, "Just one quick one."
“Can I speak now?” Steve asked in a whisper. Tony nodded, his gaze still cast downward. Steve hated it. He hated seeing Tony so weak and vulnerable but he hated more how Tony viewed himself. He never knew he harbored these feelings but then again this was just like Tony to hide this from him…Tony always hide his true feelings behind a joke or a smile and it was hard for him to open up about himself.
Pepper nodded and murmured, “Our stock prices dropped slightly but not as much as I thought it would.”
Steve clenched his fists and his own fear from self-preservation made him waver for just a moment…but he remembered this was for the man who taught him to love and his decision was easy.
Osborn was wearing the time glove and he fiddled with the dial until he was satisfied and then turned back to the front doors. He yelled out, “Have fun dying alone, Stark!”
“Pops said Hydra only wanted me,” Peter explained with a frown. He did not like talking about the subject.
. Doc managed to end up preventing his Wild West lover from plummeting to her death and not change the future much other than changing the name of a gorge.
“Steve and Peter are both in the Tower. Steve is in the office, speaking with Agent Coulson, and Peter is in the intern labs.”
“…I’m going to go talk to Stark,” Steve announced and started walking toward the tower with a renew purpose. The only people he ever trusted with his life were Bucky, Peggy, and Howard. Being Howard’s son, Anthony was the closest thing Steve had in connection to his late friend. Solo was great in helping Steve learn but he didn’t know the truth and Steve desperately wanted to find someone he could trust with it. There was a very good chance he could share that with Howard’s son.
That was why their encounters left Tony feeling confused and out of place. Steven’s tone had always been…been of someone who cared? Was he connecting this right?
Tony solved the Pepper and Steve problem by staying at the Tower and gifting Steve with a two day trip to Los Angeles to go to Dodgers’ Stadium and watch a game. In the 1940s, the team had belonged to Brooklyn and had been Steve’s team. Steve ecstatically accepted the gift (a rarity when it came to Steve who usually hated lavish gifts) but he was not too happy to hear that Tony would not be joining him.
After ignoring several calls from Fury all day, Tony finally gave in and answered with a grumble, “We don’t want any.”
He stared at his screen for a moment and then typed out, ‘Do you still want to do something tonight?’
He placed the plate of eggs and a fork in front of Tony and sat down at the counter with his own. Tony sarcastically said, “Har har har, you’re lucky I have coffee right now.”
Tony was instantly wary. The AI was hesitant and that could only mean he had sensitive information that his master needed to hear but he most likely did not want to know. Tony’s thoughts instantly went to Peter and he feared him dead.
“Good. Now that we’ve got all of that squared away,” Stark began. Stark stepped up to him and held out two earpieces. He explained, “They’re Steve’s. One is for him and the second is his spare. He’d want you to have it.”
Peter had to have misheard him. It had to be his mind playing tricks on him because his father wouldn’t –
Father Michael smiled warmly at Steve and murmured, “I know you by your deeds. You have helped many more than I have and did it without ever meeting most. What I’m doing pales in comparison,” Father Michael said, getting to his feet. “I’ll handle everything. You get some proper sleep and then we’ll get you to your friend.”
Steve rolled his eyes but let Tony drag him over to where he’d been standing moments before and he reopened all of his windows with a wave of his hand. Tony demanded, “Help me!”
“Some water will probably help and food to settle your stomach…Pepper?” Tony turned to her, hoping she’d know what to get him.
Steve's hold on Tony's hand tightened for a moment as the use of “beloved” made Steve's heart soar and then he lay his head on top of Tony's. Steve whispered more to himself than Tony, “Now, more than ever, I wish it was different…”
Within a few minutes, Steve was done. Tony sat up and accepted the towel Steve handed him. He rubbed the excess lather from his face and then looked at the mirror he had left on the desk.
Looking worse for wear, Peggy did as he asked and drew back. She went back to Howard’s side and whispered, “I’m going to be with the rest of the Commandos. We’re…We’re holding a ceremony for Steve and Bucky to – to remember them by…”
Tony looked away from the papers and to Steve. His stomach twisted disagreeably as he watched the Super Soldier’s expression become paler and more unpleasantly, unreadable.
He could tell by the tone of his father’s voice that he was bummed by the prospect. He wanted to tell the world Peter was his son but he was willing to deny it if Peter wanted to keep up the charade.
Eddie didn’t look too good. He was pale and there were bags under his eyes. It looked like he was sick. Had he gotten much sleep since Venom?
The gun fired and tiny shards of ice and metal bounced off his cheek. After a pause, Steve cracked open his eyes.
Yawning heavily, Steve locked the door behind him and went straight to the wood-burning stove, kicking off his shoes as he did. There was a small stack of wood next to it and he tossed a fresh piece in and poked at the embers to get a fire started and the room warmed up.
Everyone had left and gone back to the Tower, except for Tony and Peter. As Steve practiced his walking Tony and Peter watched with hooded eyes, heavy from lack of sleep. Peter sat on Tony’s lap and watched curiously while Tony watched him with a frown.
And Steve spent most of that time trying to help Tony. Whether it was checking in on his health with Gabe or discussing materials with Howard that he would need, he was always thinking about what he could do for the man.
…It’s all I wanted, Steve…” Tony’s voice broke and he buried his face into Steve’s chest. He repeated with tight voice, “
Hello! I live! Thank you for your patience! It's been over a month since my last posting! (This is literally the longest I have ever gone between posting chapters! O_o)
Tony fell into Steve’s side and leaned heavily against him. Steve wrapped his arm around him and held him in place. He pressed a quick kiss to Tony’s forehead and held Tony a little tighter.
Steve pushed himself up and met Tony square in the eye. Two could play at this teasing game and Steve was no longer the blushing virgin he was when he first met Tony.
“Many of you are here today because certain pictures were posted online. Steve and I are here today to confirm what most of you are asking: yes, we are in a romantic relationship and have been for two years.” A chorus of questions were instantly shouted out by the gathered reporters but Tony held up a hand and waited until they silenced. Tony continued, once it was quiet enough, “We kept the relationship a secret because we still felt the need to hide it. Steve had grown up in an era that had labeled who he was as criminal and a sin. We wanted to come out on our own terms, when Steve was ready. Tyler is not only falsely accusing my boyfriend but, because of her actions, she also indirectly took our choice away. Steve and I
“Look, Steve,” Tony started, trying his hardest to not stare at the blue of the alpha’s eyes but failing, “I’m honored, truly honored,”
For Sam to be serious was one thing, for Clint it was another story entirely. It meant they were speaking the truth. The two honestly wanted a relationship with his Rhodey and Tony realized, after living together for months and getting to know the two betas, he approved of the pair. Rhodey would compliment their personalities and balance them out and the two would give Rhodey a funny bone or ten. Maybe finally make him lighten up.
Then there was Steve Rogers. Captain America himself. America’s golden boy. Howard’s obsession. Mister sensibility and preacher of ‘self-respect’ and “have you no shame, Stark?” No, Tony couldn’t say he had any shame. Plenty of self-respect, but in order to survive life under the limelight one couldn’t afford shame. It would destroy you on the inside otherwise. Tony had learned this early on. Rogers, clearly, had not.
Seeing as his word was going to be overruled, no matter what Thor said, Thor surrendered and announced Tony’s permanent residence.
As if somehow he set off an explosive of some sort everyone slowed down an amount to a near stop. It was almost sad how upset they appeared to be and Tony not knowing why. Was he somehow rude to them without meaning to?
His Brucie was the first one to reach them and the stern glare he gave Tony was every bit as comforting as Steve’s hug.
“Tony I need you to be honest, all right?” Steve said in a tone that was an edge away from pleading. “You have to tell me if you feel uncomfortable, even if it’s small.”
From the way Sam explained it that actually sounded nice. Tony almost couldn’t wait for his first trip to Hattan and enjoy the sights. He remembered the town of Hattan. He had liked the town. Hammer had done plenty of business with the surrounding areas that required having to pass through Hattan. The place reminded him of his childhood hometown and the few good memories he had in it.
The conversations continued, ranging from other hunting stories to some of their traveling and their fights against idiot raiders that didn’t realize who they were attacking in the middle of the night.
Happy chuckled and shook his head fondly, joining them nonetheless. He took up Tony’s other side and needed to lower his head down in order to properly hug. He stood taller than Tony by two inches, something unfairly done if Tony were to say so, which he did. “I don’t remember you being that tall.”
Realization also appeared in Clint’s eyes and he nodded. “Sit your behinds down already. You’re making me nervous standing there.”
Tony’s heart clenched. Had he somehow forgotten Steve? Was he a horrible mate to have misplaced his memories of his alpha? Now he felt shameful. What did that say about him if he couldn’t even remember his mate?
“I suspected it,” Loki revealed, “but I could not confirm it. I saw your magic gathering near your core most. That could be for many reasons, pregnancy included, but unless it was inspected,” he shrugged.
So here they were. The carriage was customized to allow Peter to reach the reins properly. Of course, the reins were really superficial since Tony would be in charge in all manner of speaking, but it gave Peter the official feeling he wanted.
Jarvis whistled in agreement while Vision made his body turn slowly in order to mimic a sensual stance. “Truly, Sir. None will be able to resist gazing.”
They all congratulated Steve and reaffirmed their happiness for finally ‘settling down’ and each, interestingly enough, thanked Tony for managing to ‘wrangle’ the alpha’s free spirit. Tony had half a mind to correct their statements. If anyone had done any wrangling, it was Steve. Sweet and patient Steve, who took every broken piece of Tony in stride. Who made sure to show Tony how much the alpha cared for him and had tried and was still trying to painstakingly erase all the damage Hammer and Obie and Howard had previously done to him. One little slow step at a time.
“Really,” Clint moved forward, and maybe Tony was imagining things but he could’ve sworn Clint was purposely standing with his hind legs out, posing and showing them off. “We should get together sometime to go over it with you. We’ll give you all the juicy details.”
“Not even close,” she flicked her hand, offended. “With Pepper not competing I’m going up against foals. Honestly, it’s not even worth trying anymore. Why did she leave me!”
While he had been busy with his internal monologue Clint had finished removing his armor and was down to a simple shirt and breeches. The shirt was gone before long and revealed a toned torso that had Tony gaping a little. It had been a long time since he was allowed to look at someone else without repercussion. Whenever one member of Hammer’s pack stripped down in order to shift Tony had always looked away. Hammer hated it when he stared at someone other than himself and always reminded him of what would happen if he caught him gazing at any of their pack-mates. Tony had always been careful not to. Ironically enough. It wasn’t as if any of them had anything to drool over. They were business shifters after all. They were mostly pasty with bulges for stomachs and hardly any inch of muscle. However, the betas Hammer added for security measures, now
do. Counting the hours and keeping his eyes open for landmarks to inform him of their location. The few stops through the journey were quick and efficient, stopping to water the horses and allowing Tony to do his own business, but as the long days continued and the grime and sweat became evident and intolerable, Tony’s determination began to dwindle.
than even Rhodey - was here with him, hugging him, holding him, saying his name, was close enough for him to smell her familiar scent mixed with the scent of travel, and was solid and real.
Pepper came running to greet Tony and Rhodey first. Happy came in shortly after. The saints that they were, they had dinner ready for them with rolls fresh out of May’s kitchen. Tony’s mouth was watering from just the thought but found the scent different when they finally entered their home after so long. When he expected to smell something warm and sweet he found it smelled… odd. Pungent. Which wasn’t right. May’s rolls were always delicious and sugary. The smell of them had never once been off in all the times Tony had bought from her.
“I’ll take you,” Natasha said and together the pair left. Tony didn’t even get a chance to get back at the omega since he walked away without once looking at him. Bruce knew.
The reasoning was sound, Tony guessed, and it was true that Bruce had his own secret to keep. Besides, it wasn’t as if Bruce was going to ask him to make rune weapons or anything. He sighed and reached out to pet Vision. “The last people who knew about my skill wanted me to make weapons. Used what they could to force me. I really don’t want others to know, not again.”
Tony nodded before pulling up the equations Natasha managed to locate on his tablet, but something was amiss; he had never seen such a mathematical construction before, well not in real life. It was obvious that they were dealing with something out of the ordinary.
"Steve, please!” Tony jumped up from his chair, spinning around, before walking a few paces away from the kitchen into the living room. At this point, Tony was close to a full-on cry and couldn’t look at Steve without bursting into tears.
Tony glanced around the space until he spotted Rhodey and Pepper speaking to one another with a board member on the opposite end. He shrugged before grabbing a glass of water off a nearby server’s tray. As he made his way over to Pepper and Rhodey, Tony turned around again to make sure Steve wasn’t around, feeling himself relax a bit more.
“I really care about Steve…a lot. I feel terrible that he got hurt because of me…I-I just…” But Tony couldn’t continue; something about talking about Steve out loud like this was debilitating.
“Remember when,” Pepper began again, “I told you to talk things through whenever you can? You should be having that conversation with Steve right now instead of parsing through something that’s really nothing….”
Tony leaned backward in his chair as he considered the thought of his friends discussing his personal life behind his back. Was he upset by it? No, not really. Actually, it was kind of nice that his closest friends were looking out for him on a daily basis. He was only a little irritated with himself for being so obvious again.
“Loki!” Thor shouted. Steve tried to grab Thor, but he yanked away as he marched into the middle of the room, shoving a table out of the way before grabbing Loki by the collar of his shirt.
“Bucky,” Tony stepped forward, now inwardly agonizing over learning about Steve’s current emotional state, but too annoyed with Bucky’s overly protective behavior to address it, “we all know that you and Steve have an inseparable bond forged in childhood, but I think I may know him a
Tony wagged a finger at Loki before exiting the room. “I’ve seen him angry and it’s not pretty.” He then opened to the door out into the hallway to find Steve calmly talking to Thor. Natasha was still on the phone, but then she hung up as soon as Tony appeared.
Tony chuckled as he went back to work. “It’s fine. A friend of mine is watching him tonight.” Tony figured he didn’t need to elaborate on who the “friend” was. Besides, would Steve even care? They were just having dinner at his place like how Tony had been daydreaming about all day.
Tony grimaced as he walked toward the console. “Uh, just up to the penthouse. I had lunch with Steve.”
Bucky laughed as he patted Steve on the back a few times. “Yeah, but you’re better at other things, like I wouldn’t survive if you didn’t cook for us. And you’re a great artist and shit.” He shrugged with a grin.
“Tony, it’s okay,” Steve shook his head as he tightened his grasp on Tony’s thigh, “I’m glad you asked me to go.”
Steve nodded meekly as he did what he was told. He felt Tony rub his shoulders with both hands before one hand travelled down his body, taking its time before Steve felt Tony gently squeeze his ass.
The hand Steve had underneath Tony was now rubbing the inside of his hip as the other free hand slowly traced its way up Tony’s side to meet his shoulder. Steve started out rubbing Tony lightly then firmly, which elicited a quiet moan from Tony who kept pushing backward into Steve’s body.
They stared awkwardly at each other before Steve coughed uncomfortably. “We’re planning to visit him in the hospital later if you would like to join us?” He offered.
After clearing bystanders away from the building, the team watched as the blast radiated from the precinct, indicating that the failsafe had detonated successfully. The terrifying, yet nearly silent, implosion collapsed the precinct, taking some of the surrounding buildings with it.
Tony looked to be considering the proposal, but then he shook his head again. “As appealing as that sounds, it’s totally okay, Rogers. Thank you though.”
“Okay, so let’s scan what’s in here, then we can order something to eat.” Tony called from the room.
The final quip made everyone laugh before they finally dispersed, leaving Tony and Steve alone: Tony was trying not to look so awkward and Steve appeared to be waiting for him.
Steve nodded as he waited for Tony to give him the input information from the solved equations while Shuri and Bruce carefully packed up their equipment. As soon as the Synergy device began generating the detonator, Tony motioned again for everyone to slowly follow him out of the conference room.
Tony rolled his eyes. “Yeah, I know, J.A.R.V.I.S.” He groaned again as he leaned back into his chair.
Steve nodded without a word as he followed Tony to the basement, using building plans that had been uploaded to his tablet. Tony tapped a few times on his earpiece before decreasing his pacing.
years of my life. I would have killed to hear him say he screwed up, not muse about the possibilities over twenty fucking years later in a fucking diary, Steve!”
Tony shook his head a few times. “No. Everyone else is also unaware. Even Fury. Banner and I are the only ones…”
Steve nodded slowly as he motioned for Tony to come inside. Tony walked into the apartment, waiting for Steve to close the door. Tony looked around the space as he felt Steve rub his back before walking ahead of him.
“You didn’t have to do that. What if it were a letter of regret?” Steve rolled his eyes as he accepted a full plastic glass from Sam, who was still grinning ridiculously.
“Of course! They demoted Pluto a while back.” Tony explained out loud as he let Peter put the mask on his face.
Thor laughed heartedly. Tony looked over at Steve who was smiling, seemingly fine at the mentioning of the party.
Tony walked further into the space, glancing around again before spotting Shuri. She waved at him as he walked toward her. She gave him a hug before introducing him to some of her friends, but Tony’s attention was divided: from his vantage point he could still see Steve with Bucky and Sam and Steve was still glancing in his direction from time to time.
Steve blushed before he finally waved back awkwardly. They waited a bit before the backstage manager motioned for them to exit the stage. Steve and Tony hustled off as the lights in the auditorium dimmed. A film reel began to play, showing the Synergy team’s work with the device up until that point.
Tony held Steve still by squeezing his waist; he then licked up and down Steve before ending at the tip, taking his time to taste that very bit of Steve. Steve moved his hands slowly along Tony’s shoulders, moaning softly until one hand was running through Tony’s hair. Tony moaned with Steve in his mouth, squeezing even tighter with one hand on Steve’s cock and the other on Steve’s chest. Steve pushed Tony down onto himself as the sensation grew even more intense.
Tony walked up to the counter, signing in on the hospital visitor list before making his way to Steve’s room. He waved at some of the nurses he had gotten to know while visiting Steve before entering the room. Tony hesitated near the door, watching Steve sleep; the machines hooked up to Steve were humming quietly. Tony sighed as he walked up to Steve’s bed, placing a tote bag on a bedside table before sitting down on the edge of the bed.
“I’m too old for this!” Tony cried as he rolled onto his back, holding his arm that Dr. Strange had to reconstruct after the Roosevelt Island explosion.
“Will do. I’ll see you both tonight.” Rhodey stopped short before exiting the office. He put his hand on the door and turned slightly to look back at Tony.
Steve nodded as he sipped out of his glass. “Oh, that’s nice. You really do have a great group of friends helping you out, Tony.”
Steve closed the diary as he felt his stomach summersault a few times. He placed the diary next to him on the bed as he tried to process what he should do next. Being in the house was affecting Tony more than he could comprehend so Steve told himself that they would need to unpack boxes as quickly as possible so they could leave before Tony had another emotional breakdown.
Bruce shrugged as the pair went back to work for some time, but Tony had trouble focusing. All he could think about was seeing Steve again and how he could figure out some way to show him that he still cared about him and maybe they could start over.
Steve laughed quietly before taking his time turning around to exit the office. He lingered a bit before closing the door. Tony let out another groan as soon as he was left alone, clenching his chest, trying to tell himself to be calm.
Steve turned the chip around in the palm of his hand. “Okay, thank you for the confidence, Tony.” He smiled to convey that he was sincere.
Pepper took another deep breath. “And, Tony. You never really discussed your relationship with your father with me. I know that it causes you stress to talk about it, but I don’t feel like you were ever really open with me…” Tony looked up to see Pepper looking downward across the table. Although her head was turned slightly, Tony could sense that his lack of vulnerability hurt her the most.
The last couple weeks with Steve hanging around with him and Peter had been amazing; Tony had never felt this way toward someone who was also great with his kid. But unfortunately, as Tony mulled over his insecurities, it made him wish he had a better relationship with his father.
“Great!” Mr. Beck scribbled a number down on the pad before handing it to Steve, “I’m sorry to rush you along, but I have a faculty meeting in a few minutes.”
Obadiah gathered up his lunch plate before rising from the table to throw the trash away. He then walked over to Tony who was now sitting, before sitting on the edge of the table.
“I’m really thankful that Tony knew my brother well and was more than willing to take Peter in…he’s really the best thing that’s happened to Peter, honestly…,” May laughed quietly, “actually Peter tells me all the time how happy he is with Tony…I just wish Tony had more faith in himself…”
He handed the student the card with the notebook. The student looked like she had just been entrusted with the holy grail.
Tony nodded his head as he walked over to a console. “I know. J.A.R.V.I.S., show me the coordinates to this shindig.”
Steve watched him leave with anticipation; he had forgotten about Peter which he mentally kicked himself for. He reminded himself to keep that in mind for the next time.
“Why don’t you stop being weird and just go over there?” Tony blinked a few times as Bruce stepped in front of him to obstruct his view of Steve.
“Is this because of Synergy? Tony, you don’t have to do this. I’m disappointed that the government didn’t pick up the program, but that doesn’t matter—”
Tony yawned as he looked around the room before turning to look directly at Steve, placing a hand on his chest as he moved inward for a kiss.
Steve smirked. Tony’s reaction wasn’t entirely annoying like when his friends teased him about his lack of experience with technology.
“I can’t leave him like that! I have to see he’s okay.” Tony struggled against Steve, but Steve still managed to hold him in one place.
“—if you keep moving back and forth like this you might end up scratching the car,” Steve waved Tony off to finish his statement, “we’ll show you what to do.” He then lightly caressed Tony’s arm to get him to relax.
Instead of responding verbally, Obadiah eyed Fury as if he were suspicious of his answer, but Fury held firm in his position. After a moment of intense staring between the two men, Obadiah threw his hands up as he walked back to the front of the room.
Natasha reached over to pinch him one last time, grinning in the process. Clint yelped as he nearly jumped out of his chair.
“Apparently there are some unfortunate company politics going on at Stark Industries. One of the people who hired me, Obadiah Stane, is giving Tony a hard time. I don’t know more than that obviously, but I can tell it’s really bothering Tony.”
Tony pointed toward Steve as he rushed past. “Rogers. You’re with me.” He continued walking to exit the lab, never looking back at Bruce and Steve.
“I’m sure there are better ways to pay me a compliment.” Steve returned to massaging Tony’s shoulders.
Tony slapped Bruce a little too hard in the chest with a backhand, hardcore rolling his eyes. However, Bruce barely flinched.
Tony twisted his neck to glare at Steve. He was already annoyed that he was right that his employees, and possibly Obadiah, were trying to sabotage Synergy, but for some reason his annoyance and Steve’s otherwise innocent statement reminded him of the argument over the failsafe.
“Uh, Synergy has the ability to reprimand—replicate! Ugh, sorry…any material possible due to its vibranium core.” Steve managed to add as he watched the hologram simulate creating items.
Bucky’s eyes became equally as wide as Steve’s before he suddenly burst into a fit of hysterical laughter. Steve rolled his eyes as he watched his friend double over, laughing for what seemed like several long minutes, before straightening up and letting out a satisfied, “whooo!”.
Steve nodded as he felt Tony rub his body a bit longer before trying again. Feeling Tony inside of him like this was more than Steve had ever experienced. He told himself to relax as Tony stayed put, rubbing his ass and spreading him further apart, whispering how much he cared about him and how beautiful he thought he was.
“As I was saying before, Stark Industries is teaming up with a government division called S.H.I.E.L.D. to test new technology that will assist the populace on the ground. No longer will the average citizen have to wade through bureaucratic tape to see change.”
Bruce readjusted his eyeglasses before crossing his arms with a shrug. “I think if we keep it on lock for a few weeks, maybe a month—tops—is fine.”
He took a minute before continuing. “I don’t really like talking about whatever is going on between me and Tony because…well…I’m not entirely sure if he’s really interested…”
Bruce and Shuri looked at each other before facing Tony again. After a moment they reluctantly agreed with him before Tony dictated some more instructions.
P.S. this may sound a little goofy, but I absolutely love writing the friendships between Tony, Bruce, and Rhodey and Steve, Bucky, Sam. They're all super unique and act accordingly to which ever relationship I'm working on. I just love them all so much. :)
He clenched his jaw to keep his frantic emotions from alerting the AI. He stared into his reflection’s gaze and hardened his heart. It didn’t matter what others would define him as…Eddie was in this for himself.
“It hurts knowing you’d keep this from me,” Tony murmured. “We’re not holding back anymore, remember? It’s just not physically. We need to be open with each other.”
“Yup,” Tony said. He turned off the car, leaned back in his seat, and turned his head toward Steve. “So you sure you want to talk to them? We could just do some reconnaissance right now…”
Bucky jolted to a stop at the foot of his bed. He looked back and forth between Tony to Steve with large eyes and his brows increasing in height with every passing second. Finally, he stuttered, “You promised you’d
“Yes, you are my mission. You are one of the best recruits the Academy has seen in years. My master was asked to provide my experience in order to make you even greater,” he stated almost as if he was reciting what his master had said to the word.
let any of them sleep over!” Bucky looked over to the door. It was only open just a crack and no one would’ve been able to see in but Bucky ran over to it, cursing, “Christ!”
Another bout of tears threatened to spill from his eyes and he strangled Peter’s comforter in his hands. He forced himself to breathe and, after a number of gulps, he was able to prevent himself from any crying more. His limbs began to shake and he drew Peter’s blanket to his chest and pretended it was his son he was holding.
Steve rolled his eyes at his teammates antics but was quickly distracted by the fire commissioner and the mayor coming up to Tony and him. Clint and Nat slipped away snickering at their expense.
Peter willed Venom to throw it back at her. He imagined it like a counter move and could easily see her dodging it. But Venom threw the baton back at Natasha with inhuman speed, hitting her square in the stomach. Venom had thrown it with such ferocity that Natasha was thrown off her feet and pitched into the opposite wall with such force that the reinforced wall cracked.
As they made their way into the main hall, Peter spotted a few other plainclothes superheroes milling around in the crowd. There were probably more but Peter didn’t know their secret identity just as they wouldn’t know his. But his father and Steve had collected many friends who entrusted their identities with them and Peter knew they had to have been given invites too.
“You’re as handsome as the day I met you,” Steve promised and lightly pecked his pouty lips. He added, “Minus an appendage.”
“I’ll be ready for him, Pep…” He put his hand on the glass and repeated in a whisper, “I’ll be ready…”
The Howard he remembered was a cold, calculating man and, as a child, he seemed he wanted to be rid of Tony, so much so, that Howard's happiest day was probably when he sent Tony off to boarding school.
"If you are not here by oh-seven-hundred hours, then I am going to march out of here in nothing but my skivvies and probably hurt myself in the process," Steve threatened.
“Welcome to Project Winterwidow Part 5, Petey!” Tony exclaimed, reaching across the table to high-five Peter. Peter stood on his chair and reached out to slap Tony’s hand. Peter then held his hand out to Bucky and Bucky leaned forward to lightly tap Peter’s hand with his metal fist.
“No promises,” Clint replied but Steve took it him saying he will try since he did not use any expletives.
Bruce placed his hand a pad beside the elevator. There was a flash of light on the pad as it read his palm then the elevator dinged open. They stepped inside and the doors closed behind them.
“I have shrapnel in my bloodstream. The reactor keeps the metal from getting any closer to my heart or doing further damage,” Tony stated.
“The witnesses for the defense, yourself included, are ready and the documentation on Ms. Tyler, Ms. Potts collected for us, has been inputted as evidence. We are as ready as we’ll ever be,” the man promptly retorted.
Tony said they had needed practice but he made no more moves to touch him. Steve was nervous. All day he had surprised by Tony’s touches, not yet ready for the charade, and now because of their folly Tony wanted to…to practice?
“I have a photo of him if you want to see,” Tony offered. Steve glanced up to his friend and thanked him with a grateful smile. Tony nodded and pulled his phone out of his pocket. Without any urging from the Parkers he held out the tablet with Peter’s image on it.
But when he saw the name on the screen, his throat tightened up and he felt like he was about to topple over.
“Somehow, ‘fruit’ evolves into ‘gay’ in the future, if that ain’t funny, then call me Mucky,” Bucky retorted, strolling over to the door with the same swagger Tony’s father had joked about in his stories. When he reached the door, he waved over his shoulder, and said, “See ya at breakfast, gay boys!”
"I mean it, Wade," Peter whispered, lightly kissing the side of his cheek. "I haven't felt this way in years but you -
“I have no idea,” Steve replied. “I woke up in this room with Hydra agents and I’ve been running to you ever since…”
Steve laughed and said, “Yes, sir.” He pressed his mouth into Tony’s again and Tony hummed with approval.
“Cap, we’re two minutes from your location. Whatever shot you are talking about was not ours,” Natasha informed him.
Steve planned to simply see Tony one last time. However, when he saw him, the plan revealed itself to be foolhardy.
That night they went to bed later than usual. Steve and Tony were exhausted and, as soon as they wrapped their arms around each other they were asleep.
Deadpool threw back his head and laughed. Logan waited for the man to stop, watching him with a dry expression.
The man wanted Steve to thrust his son into a highly emotional situation. Peter dreamed of meeting his mother and Mary was unsuspecting, not knowing she would be meeting him. She did not know they were there and she might not even know Peter lived, if she remembered anything from that horrible experience in the first place…
Venom had access to his mind so he had an idea what Peter always imagined his costume to be. It only took the symbiote a few seconds to create it but it took them a few minutes to find a reflective surface for Peter to look at it.
His shield, gloves, and the top half of his uniform were still on the outskirts of camp, unnoticed by the others.
James took a large gulp of his concoction just to show her she was wrong, only to instantly clutch his mouth to keep from upchucking the contents. He ran to the sink, muffling his heaving as his breakfast threatened to come up, and Natasha laughed at his expense. He spit it out and gagged until every little bit was out.
The agent in front of him snapped his arm up and pointed his gun at Tony’s head with his safety off and his finger on the trigger. Grinning, the man hissed, “Hail Hydra.”
“Yes, through that and bank records, medical history, voting patterns, emails, phone calls, your damn SAT scores: Zola’s algorithm evaluates people’s pasts to predict their future,” Sitwell stated and shakily got to his feet.
“Where’s your shirt?” Clint asked Tony, taken aback. He came to a halt but Natasha kept moving. His eyes shot to Steve and widened. He gasped, “And
Howard looked pissed and looked like he wanted to argue further but Tony murmured, “Let’s just get down to why we are here in the first place and get it over with…”
The place was a little messy, a close reflection to the chaos in Wade’s mind, but it was homey. The front door had a small entry way that opened up to a kitchen living room combo with three more doors on the opposite walls leading elsewhere into the house. Peter’s smile quirked back up when he spotted a wanted poster on the wall of Deadpool in the living room. It was written in an Asian language Peter could not pinpoint but he had an inkling that it was real.
“Sir, we’re going to have to take the Captain into the courtroom now,” the lone female in the group of lawyers interceded.
“Not if you are watching to see what’s going to happen,” Tony stated, bumping his arm lightly with the puffy, red glove. “She’s going to know something’s up if you are watching her like a hawk! C’mon fight me.”
He protected Tony from the fall as best as he could by curling around him. Tony lay under him and Steve pushed himself up as he groaned, “Sorry, I’m a little uncoordinated right now…”
Gasping for breath, Howard shakily sat himself up. the first thing he saw was the smoke rising from the car’s vents, then he saw the broken windows, and then and only then when he sat up did he feel the pull in his chest and he knew he broke several ribs.
He stiffly nodded and she planted a quick kiss against his lips. He leaned into the kiss, letting the glorious sensation distract him for a few seconds.
“Oh God, why’d you put those images in my head?” Bucky groaned, now imagining Zola’s face on the body of one of his exes in Brooklyn.
“I know…and that scares me,” Steve replied, burying his face into Tony’s shoulder. Tony’s brows shot together and Steve continued, “I don’t want to tie you down…”
Wade looked at the floor where his mask was laying and felt the urge to don it and hid behind the safety of the fabric.
Eddie let him go and looked… lost. He clutched his wrist and murmured, “…That’s why Venom liked you more…you’re stronger…”
Mary smile thinly then said, “Where are my manners? Ben meet my partner, Dr. Susan Calvin. Dr. Calvin, this is my brother-in-law, Ben Parker.”
Bruce had been mildly surprised but informed Steve he was perfectly fine with whatever Steve preferred. Bruce was a man of science and he confessed to Steve that the politics of sexual preference was bizarre to him. He and Steve talked about the oddity and discussed what might happen if Steve came out to the world. Otherwise, his only major interest was if he planned to have more children. Steve reply was to only shrug. He was fine with just Peter right now. Bruce was somewhat disappointed. After some prodding on Steve's part, Bruce bashfully revealed he wanted to compare blood specimens of a super soldier’s gamma-radiated and non-gamma-radiated children. He was totally unaffected by the fact Steve was attracted to men but his scientist side could not help but wonder at the differences. Steve was more amused than offended. This was where Bruce and Tony were most alike. They both were extremely passionate about their work. It may hinder the social skills sometimes but it certainly improved their science.
How could he keep a straight face when his friends eventually began to joke about his father’s death?
“The Iron Patriot should be joining us as well,” Ellis said with an excited grin. “I got word that he is flying over right now!” Steve blinked in surprise and the Iron Man toy hidden in his bomber jacket suddenly felt heavier and more noticeable. He had yet to change into his uniform and had kept Peter’s toy on his person.
Tony’s eyes widened dramatically and he renewed his struggles in Bucky’s grip. Bucky had a pretty good hold on him despite one hand being on his mouth and the other holding the syringe. His arms caged Tony and held him fast. Being a super soldier just made holding Tony all the easier for him.
The next hour, Tony and Steve fawned over Peter and quietly spoke about the Mandarin, both giving each other their side of the story.
“Works with my dad,” Peter replied vaguely and leaned forward to peer at what he was working on to indirectly show that topic was over and he was not going to delve into Wade’s background anymore. He directed his eyes at the beakers in front of him and picked up his thermometer to measure their temperature for the third time.
“Natasha?” Clint hissed. The Avengers watched her with shocked expressions. None of them had ever seen her so compromised. They didn’t know James was the Winter Soldier. They didn’t know this man was her soulmate, back from the dead.
Steve knew the first step to accepting himself was to stop lying…and he wanted to stop lying to his friends first.
“It’s going to be alright in the end,” Tony whispered. Steve’s eyes rose and met Tony’s gaze. Tony was tense and he smiled diminutively at him. He continued, “There’s no way the U.S. government is going to let Captain
Steve lay back down and collected Tony closer to him, entangling their legs and tucking their faces together. He lightly kissed the top of Tony’s nose before tucking his nose along his making Tony chuckle.
“I’m so sorry,” he apologized again as guilt coursed through his system… He could not imagine what Tony went through. He cupped Tony’s face and kissed him deeply. He explained, “I went to Brooklyn. I went to the old apartment me and Bucky shared…I hoped Bucky would show himself if I was alone.”
Bucky and Natasha were locked together in a deadly embrace on the floor. Natasha had her legs wrapped around Bucky’s neck and had a white knuckle grip on a thick knife that skewered Bucky’s metal hand. Bucky had his flesh hand wrapped around her neck. They both were trying to strangle each other and were glaring at the other with a fiery hatred. Clint had wrapped his arms around Natasha’s waist and was trying to pull her off Bucky and Thor had a hand on Bucky and Natasha’s chests trying to push them apart.
Steve grasped both of Tony’s hands and pulled him toward the tub, whispering, “We’ve gone through enough heartbreak in our lifetime to last each other three lifetimes over.”
“No,” he whispered and shook his head as a smile played on his lips. He pressed his face into her damp, wavy, red hair and she grasped his hand and threaded her fingers through his.
Tony chuckled. He wrapped his arms behind Steve’s neck and kissed him in a way that made his toes tingle.
“I killed people,” Peter said and the cultured age in Peter’s eyes shone through. Tony’s already broken heart crumbled a little more.
“She…If she's a good girl, she wouldn't mind…” He managed to reply despite the conflicting emotions growing within him.
Steve all but whimpered when Tony went lower, leaving his abused nipples behind. He did not want him to stop. Tony left a trail of kisses down his torso and murmured in between them, “You’re so beautiful.
As soon as Tony fell asleep, Steve slipped out of his arms and tucked him in. He took the vodka and chugged the contents down the sink. It was a hapless effort, Tony could easily get more but Steve felt better for doing it.
Steve smiled gratefully at the agent and they changed the subject to the public relations nightmare Steve was going to have to face.
“…Gwen,” Peter whispered, his heart constricted when he voiced out her name. The day of their graduation felt like it was ages ago. He was so naïve back then…
She should not risk it but…but she felt a particular tug in her chest that pulled her in the direction of the boy.
“Nothing!?” Cable shoved the photo back in his hands and pointed at Steve’s hand in the photo and hissed, “You telling me this isn’t a change??”
Peter wrapped his arms around Wade, wishing he could share everything he felt in his heart with the mercenary to make him understand how much he cared for and needed him.
“No,” Natasha growled from her balancing beam as soon as Steve entered the gym with Peter on his hip. His son played with the dog tag on his wrist. Steve left it with him and probably was not going to take it back.
“I’ll call Clint, he’ll join you. And once you know…Please, let me know,” Coulson said and his voice grew lighter from sorrow.
And Tony had no way of knowing how long the media would drag out their obsession of their relationship. If they became the “It” couple then they could be in the spotlight for
When the other two left, Steve watched Tony work and wanted to help him but was at a loss on how to…eventually, he stepped next to him and wrapped an arm around his waist. Tony leaned heavily into his side and confessed, “I have no idea how they did this.”
The Soldier glared at Tony and then pushed Steve back and charged toward Tony. Steve grabbed the man by his legs and pulled him to the ground with him.
But he’d never kissed anyone without meaning to, he’d never pursued romantic entanglements with friends without thinking on it for a long time, and he’d certainly never done this with a man.
“Lots of gossip about the trial and examining your lives for any information on your relationship,” Natasha replied.
“I…” Tony paused and Peter looked up at him. “I’m sorry for restricting the computer without talking about it with you first. It was stupid of me…”
“It’s alright, big guy,” Tony replied. “It comes with the job. We need a bigger fridge anyways. You and Steve are eating machines.”
A second later his soulmate flew into the room. All of Steve’s hurt and worry disappeared as soon as he saw Tony and he saw the same reflected in Tony’s eyes.
They tortured him, cut off his goddamn arm, they broke him, and he doesn’t even remember his damn name Because. Of!
When the man spotted him, he stumbled over his feet in his jogging. He came to a stop and, despite the hat and glasses, Tony could see the war in his expression as he probably considered whether or not he should run.
Steve found the cafeteria and then asked the ladies begin the counter what they thought would be best to feed a child of his age. After they fawned over Steve and Peter for a few minutes, they eventually debated the babe’s age and determined to give Steve both applesauce and formula. Three of the four women were mothers and told him Peter looked like he was right on the cusp of starting eating solid foods. One of the women had to step aside to prepare the formula and Steve showered them with so much praise that they were all glowing when they returned the work.
Tony rested his hand beside Steve’s and Steve lightly touched his hand with his pinky. He whispered to Tony, “I missed you today.”
The next morning he was still restless. He looked at his phone, hoping to see the photos he and Tony strived to create but was disappointed to see only more speculation. Tony was right, they didn’t get the pictures. He checked all the major news sites just to be sure, but those who weren’t speculating who his Significant Other was were discussing the rape charges against him. Either way, his mood soured.
“I love it when you fucking curse,” Tony hissed then pulled himself out partially and thrust back into Steve. Steve threw his head back with a mighty moan and ripped a baseball sized chunk out of the mattress.
Steve grinned at his husband and whispered, “With the moves Natasha is teaching Peter, I think she would beg to differ.”
“That's the Winter Soldier,” Natasha informed them all grimly but Steve recognized Fury’s killer as soon as he stood.
That being said, for the next month, I will be backpacking southeast Asia! So I probably won't be posting until I'm back! XD
The suit slumped forward as soon as the men disappeared outside. All the systems turned off and Tony gasped, “J??”
.” Bucky hissed the last word like it was acid burning his tongue. He sharply pulled his hands from Steve and curled his fingers into the flesh of his thighs.
Steve continued to sleep with his feet propped up with the recliner portion of the couch and a blanket wrapped around him. Tony pushed himself out of his own blanket and guessed something outside had probably woken him. The city never slept. It was very plausible something outside made a noise loud enough to wake him.
Wade’s answering smile genuinely made Peter ponder his statement. He’d said it to get a rise out of the other intern but he didn’t even pause to see Eddie’s reaction. Wade and his smile was all he saw. Wade was actually interested in him. This wasn’t a game or some fun flirtation.
…” Tony picked up his head, his eyes red and dripping with tears, and he whispered, “I thought, once I was your age, I would find you, and save you, and we…we could…”
him! Tony made him a better man, he made Steve be true to himself, he made him feel things he never thought he could feel, he was one of the best things to happen to Steve since he woke from the ice!
“No problem, Petey,” Steve murmured warmly upon his son's request and knelt down next to the foliage. The leaves were green and lush. It was a nice, warm, summer day and Steve thought it was the perfect day to introduce his son to the outside world.
to go home. He needed to be home yesterday. Peter needed to be looked at by Bruce as soon as possible. But Coulson did not need to know any of that. The agent liked to keep his secrets and Steve liked to keep his, especially from SHIELD. Coulson was a great man but he was also SHIELD’s new director…
He reviewed the footage of that damning day countless times. Venom devoured the robot, spit it out in two pieces, eventually the Captain woke and, for some reason, he gave it tools to fix itself. The robot was quick to fix itself and was even quicker to get out of the tower and out of Norman’s reach.
He stumbled out of bed and paused in from of his mirror. No trace of the cut remained on his forehead, he was safe. He licked his thumb and rubbed the area for good measure. What little blood that had remained was wiped away and he felt safe enough to venture outside his room. He went straight to the kitchen and found his aunt cleaning the stove.
Tony wanted the others to delay the detectives and get in their way to keep Steve out of their hands for as long as possible but Steve would have none of it.
He sat across from Tony and Bucky sat beside Steve. Tony had paperwork beside his plate with mathematical notes and rough sketches of machinery. Steve saw an image of an Iron Man peeking out and he lightly pulled the paper to him to see it better. It wasn't Sneaky exactly but it looked pretty close. He stated, “This is good. I didn't know you can draw.”
“Looks like I am Mary Parker,” Mary joked dryly. She sighed then looked down at her hands as she rubbed her pierced finger.
Steve glanced around and spotted more of his friends. Natasha was talking with a nurse over by one of the check-in windows. Bucky was leaning into her side looking the part of someone needing to be check-in to the ER and he probably was not faking the sick look on his face. Bruce was mascaraing as a doctor and was looking at a chart. Even Sam Wilson was there and he and Clint sat next to each other in the waiting room, both wore sweaters like Steve’s with their hoods low but were keeping an eye on Steve.
“What is that?” Steve gasped, all thoughts of his embarrassment left him as he gazed at the complicated machinery inside a seemingly simple object. Tony shoved all the wires back into place and closed the hatch. He grinned slyly at Steve and got to his feet.
He had no warning. One moment, he was watching TV, and the next, he was clutching the wall as something ran through the room barreling through one wall and out the other.
“I love you too, Pops,” Tony retorted with a sly smile. He grasped Steve’s bicep and said, “Let’s go back to the party and open that present!”
“Jarvis,” Tony answered icily. “Because apparently my best friend and my husband are in cahoots when trying to freaking break my heart.”
“He wants to be with you again,” Steve stated with a flinch. “And we all think you might want to be with him too.”
Bucky buried his face in Steve’s neck and Steve tensed, aware of the eyes on them and aware of the wrongness of this feeling so right.
"I used up all the juice in the bracelet. I-uh-had to redo some moves to make sure I got everything right. So we had to find another way home."
The bartender quickly looked at his ID and his eyes flickered up from it to him in quick section before he nodded and asked, “What do you want?”
Bucky made no move to follow them back inside so Steve turned back to him and motioned for the nurses to give them some privacy. Steve demanded, "When?"
He lifted both his hands and pointed it at the thrashing symbiote. His repulsors gave off a high pitched whine as they charged to full blast.
Tony slammed his fists on the table again. “Just tell us where you stashed the damn weapon, Thanos.”
He thought about maybe saying something about their breakup himself, but told himself that that was probably not a good idea, especially while they were working on the new Synergy device. Tony thought maybe he should save that conversation after they had worked together for some time.
“Uh,” Tony shuffled around in his chair after they ordered some appetizers, “do you remember the first time we worked on the device together?—But, I think I might have blown the vibe by freaking out on you during that first simulation with the group…” He mentally berated himself for starting with that in order to avoid talking about something serious.
The elevator door opened to reveal the penthouse; they stepped out of the elevator car into the space, looking around aimlessly, amazed at the grandeur of it.
Rhodey smiled back but his face turned solemn again. “I’m sorry I can’t go with you to the house…you know I would if I didn’t have to be in D.C.—”
“Hey, Cap!” And almost instantaneously, Sam had appeared with Bucky in tow. Both were giving their friend the most annoying grins.
“I should have given these to you this morning before going in, but I was…distracted…” He never looked up at Steve as he handed him the tablet.
“Steve! Steve!” Peter had appeared suddenly in the room, waving around a few dozen sheets of paper that comprised his comic. He ran up to Steve, tugging on his sweatpants.
Natasha had been shuffling around a bit to get Clint to give her some space, but for some reason Clint was too unaware or preoccupied with the size of the room to notice that he was smothering his friend. Steve watched Natasha glance toward the other side of the room in between shuffles. He turned slightly to see that she was watching Bruce, who looked extremely uncomfortable. Steve thought maybe he could finally ask Tony what was going on between those two; he felt that he had gotten close enough with his lab mate to discuss more personal subjects along with their favorite things.
Clint slapped Steve on the back, but not too hard. “You’re going to fit in nicely, Rogers. I can tell Nat and Fury like you and they don’t like anyone.”
Tony had to prevent his face from expressing how confused he felt on the inside. Here they were, having not established any boundaries with the status of their relationship and Steve was fine with him being around Pepper. He had never been in a situation like this before, but something about it felt strangely comforting.
“We don’t know who else is involved and it might go to the top. If it does, we’re only making it worst without coming up with a plan first.”
Tony followed, removing his shoes before laying down next to Steve. Steve waited before laying down, making sure to stay near the edge, wondering to himself if this was the right moment to talk to Tony about their relationship.
Sam sighed, but he smiled at Bucky. “You know how Steve is. He cares about the people closest to him, but I think he would like it better if you told him what was up instead of being weird around Tony.”
“Oh, you know what?” Tony had stopped abruptly as he walked toward the bathroom, snapping his fingers before pointing at Steve. “There is
“Don’t worry about that,” the scientist chuckled to himself which unnerved his colleagues, “the school’s planning a trip to Venice for the kiss-ups…” he turned around to face away from the group and at the object.
Happy had driven Steve and Tony back to the Tower. Tony had been completely silent in the car, and he continued to be equally silent in the elevator. Steve could tell something was bothering him, but he wasn’t sure how to approach it without upsetting Tony even more.
Bruce shrugged. “If you’re trying to get me to say that Steve will look good in one, I’m not falling for it.”
Steve made a face, but he looked away from Bucky, turning red from the insinuation. “There’s nothing going on, Buck,” he then faced Bucky, “Tony and I are just friends. Besides this is mostly for Peter than anything else.”
Tony used his clicker to stop the image from spinning; he then panned to the vibranium core. The holographic image was programmed to simulate a glow similar to the one experienced when the device generated specs to be replicated.
T’Challa smiled slightly. “It’s more than all right. I set aside some space for the team to work whenever you get a moment.”
Tony let relief and self-gratification with his new invention wash over him, but before he could really appreciate how well Steve took to dancing and how well the device seemed to work, his lips were meet instantly with Steve’s. Tony had to prevent his eyes from widening with shock as Steve squeezed his body as he kissed him.
Natasha shrugged as she crossed her arms. “Barton only said that he might have seen another person in the lab next door. I’ll follow up on it after we clean the footage.”
“Not to sound paranoid, but is there a possibility that these buyers might be a front for someone else?” Steve asked.
Tony shrugged as if it weren’t a big deal. He really liked Sam and could tell he was a straight shooter, but he was really trying to win points with Steve.
“Then,” Tony turned to Steve with a broad smile, “I’ll have you come out and give a little spiel about the device. Like the vibranium core and how it replicates material or whatever.”
“Okay, Banner…” Tony motioned for Bruce, “where do you think would be the best place to hide an unstable weapon?”
Steve turned his head to look slightly away from Tony before addressing him again. “I think we would be doing a disservice if we stop the project.”
Another reporter managed to wedge herself past Happy’s waist, awkwardly holding up her tape recorder but with fortitude.
“You know, Rhodey has a friend who works closely with the folks over at the Pentagon. Maybe we could use his connection as an ‘in’.” Tony watched Steve nod, but could tell that work was becoming a tired topic of conversation. He mentally berated himself for bringing up business in an intimate setting like this.
The morning after hadn’t been any kinder to Steve. He spent the whole night tossing and turning in his bed, thinking about Obadiah’s accusation. He figured maybe mentioning something to Sam in the morning would alleviate his concerns. Besides, it was probably time to come clean about his growing feelings toward Tony.
Steve let out a ragged sigh. “…the last time I was with another guy…I was in college…so needless to say I don’t have much experience…” The words had sorely dragged out of Steve’s mouth.
Bruce walked up to the conference table as if he were about to interject, but Tony waved him off. As he crossed his arms, Tony’s face hardened before he broke out into a bizarre, quiet laugh. He then rested his hands on his hips, knowing he was on the verge: not only did the fucking device he was saddled with not work like it should, he knew he was near the precipice of getting into with Steve.
Tony nodded as he thought back to his interaction with Tiberius. “…Pep, I’m afraid I’m going to lose Steve…” He sighed loudly once more, “…I ran into Ty at the fucking event…” He let out before placing his head into his hands again.
Thor shook his head as he reached out a hand across the table to stop Loki from leaving. “Then help us. If you fear for your safety—” Loki groaned, but Thor pressed on, “the best thing you can do is help us track Thanos down before he
Steve’s remained steady; he only gently freed himself before patting Tony on the knee. He swiveled around in his chair to slide over to his usual console. Tony watched him for a brief moment before rising out of his chair to walk to his console.
Tony nodded as he motioned for Steve to come further into his office as he stayed near the window. Steve took two steps forward, remaining closer toward the door.
Tony laughed quietly as he sensed that Steve was trying to ease the conversation as much as possible. He took a hold of Steve’s hand on his chest.
Bruce knew Tony well from working closely with him at Stark Industries, and it was obvious that the two mirrored the other in their love of science and all things nerdy. Steve could tell from their constant banter that they were probably best friends.
Steve watched his friend turn his sketch around a few times as Sam read each notation. Steve smiled as he thought back to the lab and the rest of the tour of Stark Industries.
Tony laughed quietly. He looked downward before responding to Steve. “One of my meetings got canceled at the last minute,” Tony peeked upward at Steve through his eyelashes, “so you’re stuck with me the rest of the day, unfortunately. Sorry.”
As more of his senses returned, he could smell smoke and fire. The moment felt too surreal; he tried to orient himself by turning toward the opposite end of the corridor toward his lab.
Tony nodded quickly. “Thanks, Bucky. I really appreciate it.” He tried to smile but felt too overwhelmed in the moment to do so without grimacing. Tony said goodbye to Bucky before hurrying out of the building to get back to his car before Steve came back to the apartment.
“That’s why we need to stop it before he deploys this weapon at the expo…I have a plan…” Gamora then pulled out a mini tablet from her back pocket, tapping on it to show her sister the list of sequences.
“I’m sorry,” Tony began motioning for Steve to come in, “Obie was just in here being an asshole per usual.”
Tony groaned, slapping a hand to his forehead before attempting to end the call. But before he could, the phone stopped ringing to indicate that Steve had picked up.
“I can shower in the guest room bathroom next to my parents’ room and you can take the one in here.” Tony fished out an outfit and grabbed a towel before heading to the bedroom door.
"Tony, I'm not saying I won't spend night," Steve laughed nervously, "just that we probably need some space…I think I've been here for too long and we probably just need a break…"
Tony kissed him, aware that Steve was trying to ask him to fuck him again. He laughed but managed to do so without frustrating Steve.
Natasha patted her on the back before turning to face Clint. She crossed her arms to prevent herself from clamming up at the sight of her friend lying in the bed hooked up to machines.
“…and I thank my lucky stars that you are who you are…” Bruce started singing along with Tony, but way too loudly. Natasha nudged him in the arm to take it easy, smiling as she got him to sway with her to the music.
He sat there for quite some time before rising to get back down to the lobby and the reception. As he arrived in the lobby, he found Bucky waiting for him.
Obadiah squinted with another quiet laugh before leaning backward in his chair. He looked at Steve before looking down at his desk, shuffling around a few things before he continued.
Steve nodded again before earnestly reminding himself that J.A.R.V.I.S. couldn’t see him nodding before heading toward the office. He walked slowly, trying to regain his balance. His head hurt a little, but he didn’t feel sick from Thor’s Jörmungandr. His queasiness was now contributed to passing out in Tony’s bed, having a sexy dream about him, and then waking up to rubbing himself against Tony’s mattress.
Steve spotted Tony out of the corner of his eye, excusing himself from his conversation to greet Tony with a smile.
Steve awkwardly hugged and kissed Tony back, but his guilt was crushing his composure. As soon as Tony released himself from the hug, Steve quickly walked over to the table he usually used to store his things. He took his time opening his work bag, finding Howard’s diary sitting on top of his notebooks and writing instruments.
“Thanks for fitting me into your schedules,” he began lightheartedly, “I wanted to disclose to you all a close relationship I have with one of the members of Synergy…” Tony inhaled once more as everyone intently waited for him to finish.
“I want to keep you in the loop with everything that’s happening with the device. It’s only right since you’re the one who works with it the most.”
Having Steve agree to dinner with him had begun to subside any weird feeling he had about Steve practically rejecting him over the weekend, but now Tony was even more baffled than before with how Steve was currently acting. Tony told himself to push through it in order not to make a scene.
Steve dragged his feet to the kitchen, finding Sam sitting at the table, reading on a tablet, and drinking a cup of coffee. Ever since moving in with Shuri and receiving new responsibilities at work, Steve and Bucky rarely saw Sam. It wasn’t until recently that Sam had taken the effort to catch up with his friends at their old apartment. He still had a copy of the keys so he would drop by whenever. Steve appreciated seeing Sam more, but the fight with Tony was dragging his spirits down.
Tony shuffled so that he was lying directly on top of Steve again. He looked downward at him sweetly, stroking the back of his neck.
As the test finished, the equations that had been previously incorrect were now operating normally. Tony’s face hardened as he tried to mentally resolve why the numbers had been wrong in the first place. It was a small enough anomaly but considering all the shit that had gone down when the device blew up the precinct, Tony figured he should take the device up to the penthouse to tinker with before getting ready for dinner.
Tony groaned even louder. He slapped a hand to his face to cover his eyes, taking a moment. “Speaking of which, are you still able to go with me to the house in the Hamptons?
Thor eventually nodded but he made sure to visually communicate that he was not pleased with the situation.
“Of course, Tony. I’m all yours.” Tony grimaced a little. He stayed with his back facing Steve so the latter wouldn’t see his expression.
Steve nodded again as Tony kissed him. He eased as he kissed Tony back, repositioning them back onto the bed.
“Sir.” Agent Hill appeared suddenly in the room, “you need to see this.” She vaguely explained, yet sternly without acknowledging Loki who was struggling in his chair.
Steve had never been in the presence of such a diverse group of people. The project was becoming more of a reality, but that didn’t intimidate him at all.
Steve could tell that he was attempting a joke, but he wouldn’t give Tony the satisfaction of finding it funny.
“…the first time I ever did this…” Tony began, “…the person I was with hurt me and I don’t ever want to do that to you, Steve.”
J.A.R.V.I.S. shuffled through a few playlists until the computer landed on one that Tony played the most frequently. Tony sat in silence, brooding over his misery.
The last few weeks had taken their toil and the team was feeling the burn, so to speak. Their huge board presentation was coming up the following week to simulate the Synergy device and no one was looking forward to it. However, to preserve everyone’s sanity and rebuild morale, Thor had invited the team and their significant others and friends over to his place for quite a lively party.
Tony shook his head as he heard the bedroom door close, but he refused to turn around. He was so angry with himself and Steve that he couldn’t even articulate a coherent thought.
Tony turned over on his side, staring at the side of the bed Steve usually slept on whenever he spent the night. Tony sighed loudly, wishing Steve was with him now. He turned over on his other side, remembering to check his messages. He peered at his phone which was facing downward on the bedside table, turning it over to find a message from Steve sent a while back.
“It looks like something’s eating you up, Cap.” Tony observed, still grinning with his arms crossed as Steve finally joined him at the elevator.
Tony licked Steve slowly one last time, getting him to the point where he knew Steve was close before straddling his body. He smiled downward at Steve, rubbing his hands along his chest before leaning downward.
Rhodey glanced at Tony before shaking his head. He leaned forward so that his forearms were on his thighs, hands crossed.
Tony chuckled as he shuffled around to face Steve who was clenching his chest from being surprised by J.A.R.V.I.S.’s presence.
“J.A.R.V.I.S., could you lower the volume please.” Tony continued to watch Steve walk toward him. His expression was reserved.
I got it.” Steve continued to input the last set which was, of course, correct. Tony stopped struggling as the device began generating specs for the remote replication. Steve heard his lab partner scoff before standing up straight. Tony then flung the tablet he was holding onto one of the simulated couches.
“Am I allowed to say that this is really fucking hot?” Tony murmured as the elevator shot up to the penthouse.
“…I know we just started seeing each other,” Tony started; he looked downward before looking up at Steve, “…and I know we sort of already talked about this...but how are you so cool about me having dinner with an ex? I would be freaking out right now.” Steve could tell that Tony was only teasing, but something about the question seemed odd.
As soon as Tony approached the lab, he slowed down, straightening himself out before entering. Upon entering, he found Bruce standing next to a console, patiently waiting for him.
Steve followed in suit, fumbling as he dressed. He followed Tony down the hallway at a ways away until Tony knocked on Peter’s bedroom door.
“Okay, team.” Tony clapped his hands together. “Even though the device is on lock, let’s not let that stop us. We have that promotional thing coming up, but I need you all to keep working on your individual tasks.”
Tony nodded as he swallowed that weird lump in his throat again; he had been hoping to talk directly to Steve or to find no one at home at the very least. For some odd reason, Tony dreaded speaking to Bucky; although they only interacted on occasion, Tony could tell that Bucky was suspicious of him. It bothered him, especially after giving Steve such a hard time about their friendship.
Agents at S.H.I.E.L.D. questioned Dr. Selvig on any other possible employee conspirators, but besides implicating Loki, the scientist was reluctant to provide any other details, especially whoever was giving them orders to sabotage Synergy.
I can save humanity by destroying it and rebuilding it again. It must be done. Humans are selfish, so they must be destroyed."
Steve recoiled somewhat at the sudden change in Tony’s tone. He waited before responding again, thinking of ways to deescalate the conversation.
Tony nodded timidly, but he was smiling. “Based on this and everything else you’ve told me in the past, you’re such a hopeless romantic, Rogers.”
Steve sighed as he looked downward before looking directly at Tony. “To be honest…I kind of wished you had said something earlier…”
“…we’ll get through this, okay?” Steve said quietly, but Tony wasn’t sure if Steve was referring to Synergy or their relationship.
Tony had stayed in the hospital the day and a half Steve was in surgery while Peter stayed with May. Sam and Bucky were also at the hospital: Sam talked with Tony while Bucky ignored them, clearly upset that his best friend was in the hospital. Tony had missed work to wait for news at the hospital, but eventually Bruce managed to convince him to go home until Steve was stable enough to receive visitors. However, Tony couldn’t rest at home; all he could think about was being the reason why Steve was in the hospital.
“Steve…” Tony waited a moment as he thought about Steve writing him that letter, “I should apologize for what I said to you…I wish I could take it back…” he paused, “…I do trust you, Steve. You’re my lab partner.” He managed to joke which prompted a restrained laugh from Steve.
“Mr. Stark,” Peter’s teacher greeted Tony right away as soon as he opened the door to the classroom, “nice to see you again.” He gestured for Tony to take a seat in front of his desk.
“…I…uh…” Steve laughed again, rubbing a hand through his hair before he settled again, “…I...love you, Tony.”
“You may not get to see the device today, but you will see the device in action during our scheduled simulation presentation.” Fury reminded everyone.
“I was distracted the last time…personal issues…you know the deal.” Tony nearly mumbled as he looked down at the device in his hands. He turned it around a few times as he heard Bruce sigh.
“Rogers,” he began in a low whisper, practically dragging Steve down the hallway again, “you need to relax. They’re arms dealers. They’re not people persons.” He tried lightheartedly, but the joke fell completely flat with Steve.
“Or, we’re using the vibranium to stabilize the core of the Synergy device, but yes.” Tony corrected as pedantically as possible.
Tony flinched as Steve drew nearer; he had trouble trying to reconcile Steve’s current behavior and the situation they had stumbled into.
Steve nodded with a grin; he was amazed with how comfortable he was becoming with Tony’s sense of humor.
Tony nodded before looking away, feeling his face turn even more red as he could feel Steve staring down at him.
Tony looked grim as he glared back at Steve, too angry to respond verbally. Steve reciprocated the expression, obviously too angry to clarify. To both, it felt as if they were the only people in room, but of course the entire team was still witnessing their exceedingly tensed argument.
“It just happened this past week, Tony. Why? Is this going to affect Sam’s security clearance?” He joked.
Tony blinked a few times. His mouth popped open and shut close a few times as he struggled to figure out what to say. Sam only chuckled, but he was kind about it.
Omg, over 100 kudos! And over 200 hits since the last update! You all are making my day. Thank you so much for reading and I hope you continue to enjoy the story.
And to add to his weird mix of emotions, also about a month ago, Steve had started seeing someone new, Sharon Carter; a fellow lawyer stationed at the main public defender’s office in Manhattan. They had only been out to dinner a few times; nothing physical had happened between the two considering Steve was still trying to get over Tony. Even still, spending time with Sharon was a nice respite from brooding over Tony. However, and even though Steve would never say it out loud to anyone, he sorely missed Tony.
Tony coughed once more before spinning around to walk down the hallway. “Come on, Rogers. We have work to do.” He tried without sounding awkward, but he was sure he did.
“Yeah, Buck!” Sam called back as he walked toward his seat next to Bucky, “just don’t get too crazy. We have several days to get through.
Steve panicked, looking around the living room quickly before rushing toward the foyer to get to the elevator.
Steve nodded as he scissored his fingers inside of Tony. Tony squirmed on Steve’s fingers, amazed with how great Steve had become at fingering. Steve kissed Tony’s neck, and Tony gasped with every single movement, whining quietly from the feeling.
Tony nodded. “He’s supposed to be speaking to the press at Stark Tower. I radioed Pepper and Rhodey before coming out here…I don’t want to spook him and have him end up doing something drastic.”
Mr. Beck smiled and waved. “Your robot looks great, Peter and Ned! I’m excited to see what it does.”
invite him over. But he also seemed to be unwilling to talk about what had happened after Thor’s party. He also nearly lost his shit the morning after. Was he playing a game? Tony would be shocked—shocked!—to find out that Steve Rogers, Mr. Traditional, would be playing mind games with him. There was no way.
Tony stopped swiveling. “Steve, are you serious? Remember when you fell out of the bed? Face first?”
“I’ll keep a look out for your guys’ project.” He gave the boys a thumbs up before walking over to another project stand.
Tony, who was standing next to Bruce and Thor on one side of the conference room, shrugged before answering.
“…do you think you would ever try to make things work with Ms. Potts again?” Something about Steve’s question seemed pained, which caught Tony off guard again.
Tony winced as he crossed his arms. He really had no idea where his relationship, or whatever it was, with Steve was now headed. Tony always looked forward to having Steve over whenever Peter was with his aunt, and although Steve seemed really into him, they hadn’t gone further than the occasional make out session or a night of heavy petting. Tony had admitted to himself that he was nervous to push it any further; he wanted to take his time and let Steve know that he wasn’t in it just for the sex.
Tony untangled himself from Steve to turn and face him directly. Steve was smiling, albeit his expression was reserved.
Nebula scrunched up her face before looking back toward Obadiah’s direction. “Fine…” she slowly turned to face her sister, “but you’re the one who’s going to tell father that you didn’t follow through.”
Steve lingered in the threshold of the bathroom door as Tony looked up at him with a smile. “You gonna come in, Rogers?”
“Oh hey!” Bucky was standing in the threshold of the kitchen to the living room, “it looks like I’m missing a party.”
“Don’t make it too obvious.” Steve added. At first his tone was lighthearted, but then it regressed.
“Okay, now this next one is tricky, so please be mindful of your answer before giving it.” Tony bounced the rubber ball against the wall.
“Tony, oh my god.” Steve let out as he tightened his hold on Tony. Tony held on, grinding downward, gasping and moaning.
“How’s your first day?” Steve sensed Natasha standing next to him. She leaned up against the table beside him.
Steve stopped touching Tony as he propped himself up. He sighed, removing his hand on Tony to rub through his hair.
Bucky was standing on top of the portable airstairs to one of T’Challa’s private planes, calling down to Sam and Steve as they walked toward the aircraft.
The staffer stayed at the entrance to the room, watching Obadiah round the table. “Will, uh, Mr. Stark be here also? I know he has a super busy schedule…”
Tony laughed as he continued against Steve, grinding faster and harder until he couldn’t last any longer. He groaned loudly as he released himself all over Steve’s chest. Steve came soon after, holding onto Tony as he touched himself.
“I asked you over here, Tony, because I know you have trouble sleeping.” Steve turned around to look directly at Tony, “you know me…why…why would you
Steve let out a small contained laugh, looking away before facing Tony again. Tony cocked his head to the side as he watched Steve’s expression change.
hottest, I quite enjoyed this one.” Tony teased as his voice lowered. He straightened himself out as Steve finally let go of his face.
Sam shook his head as he patted Steve on the back again. “Steve, it’s okay. I’m glad I have you guys here to support me. It means a lot. Also, I don’t mind giving you relationship advice.” He winked at Steve.
As soon as he reached the lab, Loki looked around and through the glass façade; he could see the Synergy device sitting on top a console.
Tony smiled back as he let her take his hand. He could feel her sincerity. “Okay, then. Now you gotta get Rhodey to force Bruce to discuss his personal life.” He joked, hoping it would mask how he felt on the inside.
Tony nodded again before leaning forward. “We are too—uh,” He pulled out his phone to check any new messages from Steve, reading a message that Steve was still running late, “my husband should be here in thirty minutes or so.” Tony quickly added before putting his phone away.
Pepper smiled as she took Tony’s hand before caressing it. “Tony, it’ll be okay. Just talk things through, like I said.”
“Well…I just figured…” Tony looked down at his shoes before looking back up at Steve, “…when we last spoke, I just figured you would have brought her along or something—” he stopped himself as he waved his hands around, “which is totally fine with me, by the way!” Tony ended by looking everywhere except at Steve as he could feel his face becoming flush with embarrassment.
Tony appreciated the gesture, not really caring or realizing that such a move might appear more intimate than they usually let on. Tony was too distressed that his team members were now in danger because of this damn Synergy project.
“Well, maybe…” He tried. He thought maybe he should clarify this terribly awkward situation, but then he thought about how apprehensive Tony acted around him last night, which seemed unusual to Steve; he was used to Tony flirting more and instigating it.
“I’m going to stay late and try out somethings…then probably help Shuri and Banner…” Tony said quietly.
Tony shook his head. He reached out to rub Steve’s shoulder. “I don’t know, but whoever we’re dealing with is more dangerous than I thought…”
“Okay, then I believe you when you say that you’re not sleeping with Tony.” Sam continued to smile as he tried to return to eating his sandwich, but he looked apprehensive as Steve continued to stare at him in disbelief.
Tony sighed again as he stopped what he was doing to rest his hands on his hips. He surveyed the kitchen before looking at Steve.
“Steve…” Tony began again. He sighed as he placed his hands on hips, keeping his back toward Steve. “…it has nothing to do with Synergy…”
Steve nodded in Natasha’s direction which was returned with a steady nod, but it was accompanied with a kind smile that was a bit on the sly side.
Steve’s face flushed as he jogged to the front of the store, but Bucky took his time following him, laughing all the way up to the register, out the store, and back to their apartment, while also giving Steve flack for keeping him in the dark about his evolving sex life.
Bucky laughed again as he patted Steve on the shoulder. “But I’m glad to know that you’re taking care of yourself. As long as you do that, you can have all the fun you want.”
Pepper reached out a hand which Tony accepted after taking a moment. “Steve’s allowed to be close to other people. You’re close with your friends. You’re close with me and we used to date. Is Steve weird about that?”
Pepper made a sour face before pulling out her phone. She tapped on it a few times before handing it to Tony. Tony looked perplexed as he accepted the phone.
Natasha sighed as she rested her hands on her hips. “It took some work; whoever’s been doctoring the security footage did one hell of a job.”
Steve sighed. “I’m trying to do that more, and I want you to be able to talk to me. I…can tell it’s difficult…and believe me, it took me a while to open up…especially after I left the military…”
Bucky’s facial expression had barely changed, but Tony could feel the unmistakable tension between the two of them as they stared each other down.
Steve then took a firm hold of Tony before flipping them over so that Tony was now lying on his back. Tony scooted around in the bed so that they were lying lengthwise, wrestling with his shirt before yanking Steve’s off his body.
Pepper laughed, but she was kind about it. “Rhodey might have mentioned something. We’re just looking out for you, Tony.”
Steve scooted to the middle of the bed. “Tony, come on. You know that’s not what I meant.” He watched Tony walk to the end of the bed.
The intern watched Tony leave before looking at Steve. Steve sighed before marching out of the room in the opposite direction of Tony.
The guard then motioned for his colleague to escort the carrier through security then to the elevator bank and up to Obadiah’s office. As soon as they arrived at the office, the guard knocked on the door.
“…I guess I got caught up in the moment…just playing the part like we agreed, right?” Steve added, attempting a half shrug coupled with a weak smile.
Tony frowned at the monitor before checking the time on his wall clock. He had scheduled a meeting with the former Synergy team later that day at Stark Enterprises and Tony needed most of the day to psyche himself up before seeing Steve again.
“Project Synergy. Nice to meet you, Mr. Rogers. Please turn left and follow the hallway all the way down to the conference room. The meeting will begin promptly at 8am.” Steve nodded as he followed the receptionist’s directions.
“Okay, so now that everyone knows what to do in the interim, outside of this damn promotional tour, let’s try to keep a low profile. I don’t want to get back on the board’s radar unless we’ve saved some people from a burning building or stopped a bullet or whatever.” Tony waved a hand about as he concluded.
Unfortunately, the mood at the party was a bit somber; after learning about Loki’s arrest, the team was now doubly anxious to protect the Synergy device. As a precaution, Fury had some of the team stay behind in case there was another incident.
Peter continued to express how excited he was to see Steve again by rapidly listing all the experiments he planned to show him. Tony continued laughed as Peter followed him into the kitchen. Tony waited a moment as he leaned up against the island, watching Peter bounce around with joy.
Tony laughed as he stretched. “I can sleep it off later.” He smiled at Steve who reciprocated the expression although he was also exhausted from the night before.
Steve felt an aching drop in the pit of his stomach. “Th-that was…real? I thought that was a dream...”
Bruce grumbled at Tony, but then noticed Steve in lab. He patted Tony on the shoulder. “You’ll be fine.” He grinned before heading toward his own lab.
Tony laughed before posing thoughtfully. “Yet, I was right, wasn’t I?” He reached over to mess up Peter’s hair, causing Peter to groan again.
Steve shook his head. “No, but I’ve been checking on him before coming to see you since you’ve been here. Actually, Peter stayed over at my place last night and we played board games with Bucky all night.”
Steve watch Tony slowly rock back and forth on his heels. Steve could hear him breathing deeply as if he were doing breathing exercises.
“I got the idea from my dad…” Tony added, “he made a comment once about wanting to be able to download memories…”
Tony looked ahead of himself as he suddenly remembered what Steve was referring to. He then burst out laughing from the memory.
Steve was enjoying the moment, but now he was angry with himself; he was upset that he had been so brazen, even if Tony sounded like he hadn’t been turned off by it.
Tony chuckled. “Thanks, Cap.” He ruffled Peter’s hair once more with a grin before motioning for Steve to follow him to the fridge.
Bruce’s face flushed from the attention. “Ah, well, Shuri mostly figured out the mechanics behind it.” He tapped on the tablet again, showing Tony a projection mimicking a scenario for the separate reactor, “it’s scalable, so any situation isn’t too big or small for it.”
Tony hesitated before reaching out to touch Steve. Steve remained still has Tony lightly touched his hands, grazing his skin as gently as possible before taking a hold of both of Steve’s hands, much like he had in the restaurant. He took his time looking upward at Steve who looked incredibly sad. Tony cursed himself for making him look so melancholy.
“Rogers, I know you’re fast, but I left the meeting before you.” Tony tried for as casually as possible, hoping Steve wasn’t weird about that fact that he had been ignoring him all day.
Bruce shuffled back and forth on his feet; Steve could tell that Tony’s decision to bring him instead bothered him also.
Steve saluted Peter back. “At ease, private.” He answered before squatting to be at eye level with Peter.
Steve turned to Tony who looked despondent. “Tony, it’s not that bad. Like, Mr. Beck said, everyone could use some therapy and that’s better than Peter failing the class.”
Both Gamora and Nebula looked at each other, both signaling to the other that they had wished their father had sent them an email instead of calling them to his office to only remain coy concerning any concrete information for their plans.
“Good, I’m glad.” Tony responded, exhaling with relief, looking slightly at Peter before focusing on the road.
Tony sighed once more, looking downward and away before looking up at Steve. “Just…just be honest with me…please…”
“I’m going to make breakfast.” Steve walked to the door, opening it to relieve an excitable teenager.
“I know what you’re all thinking…” Tony started as he looked out into the crowd, “how can anyone change their genetic makeup?”
Tony nodded as he kept his back facing Steve, finding two clean glasses before pouring water into them. He closed his eyes tightly, counting to three. He then turned around to walk the glasses over to Steve, holding out a glass for Steve who accepted it with a half-smile.
Tony shuffled around a few times, choosing to just come out with it. “I…after…we…broke up…I, uh…” Tony stopped to rub the back of his head before he continued, “…I had some issues…”
Tony shook his head. “You gotta do the basics first before trying to run, Steve. Otherwise you’ll wind up in the hospital again. Also, Fury said he won’t sign off on you rejoining the team unless you go to therapy. And, I don’t think I need to remind you that you were in a lab explosion not too long ago.”
“I think everyone should trust what our team is capable of,” Steve glanced at Tony before looking directly at the pool, “I know I do.”
Tony expressed confusion, but then tried to mask it quickly. Of course, he wasn’t going to remember every single employee, but he pretended to be interested given the situation.
the benefit of the doubt. He was way out of line.” The two paid for their snacks before entering the theater. They sat down somewhere in the middle.
Tony held his phone above his head as he stared at the last message to Rhodey. He saved it as a draft, deciding, or really forcing himself, to get Steve to be honest with him, but figured he could do so when they got back to New York; he needed some time to figure out how to broach the subject calmly, which was something a therapist told him he needed to work on.
“Tony, you should have called me. I called you so many times…I left you so many messages…you should have called me, especially since this was happening.”
“If it doesn’t fit, I’ll fix it—but that’s only if you want it of course. I don’t expect you to say yes, of course, considering all the shit we’ve been through…” Tony looked up at Steve, “but I just wanted to say that I love you so much, Steve, and there’s no other way for me to express it besides throwing you a huge-ass party,” Tony chuckled to indicate that he was joking before taking a moment as he looked away from Steve, “…well actually I’m showing it by opening up to you more like we talked about…” he sighed as looked directly at Steve again, “I had prepared better for this, I prom—”
He rolled his eyes. “I know this is a setback, but we have the schematics. And I’m sure your father can bid for a reasonable price on vibranium. God knows the Wakandans have an immense supply of it…”
“On another tangentially related note…” Tony walked back to his desk, “and this is probably messed up to say, but I’m looking forward to using your recovery as an excuse not to go to this investor event.” Tony sat down in his desk before swiveling back and forth in his chair, “I usually use Peter to get out of these things, but I think folks are starting to catch on.”
“Morning.” Tony answered back, rocking his hips forward, lingering before titling his head upward to press his lips against Steve’s, placing both hands on his hips, now controlling the movement of Steve’s rocking motion. Steve kissed Tony back, moaning slightly as he let Tony grip his body tighter.
Tony tried to look away from Steve but was failing miserably. He gave his tousled lab partner the once over, remarking to himself how hot Steve looked.
Steve leaned forward in his chair. “You think Loki will be in the mood to go to one of these things after having been arrested?”
Tony sighed deeply as he turned to face Steve. “…I’m thinking about suspending Synergy indefinitely, just until we figure out how to keep everyone safe…”
Tony managed to contain much of his excitement for his friend to himself as he listened to Rhodey have an incredibly boring conversation with a board member who still didn’t understand Synergy's purpose.
Tony laughed at Steve, waving a hand before turning to face the console. “I can’t work unless I’m listening to music, just trust me on this, Rogers.”
“I love hearing from Sam, but it would be nice to hear updates about Steve Rogers from the man himself.” He motioned toward Steve with his beer before drinking out of it.
Tony winced, waving Bruce off. “Steve isn’t going to want to deal with me blubbering over my lost childhood.”
The machines continued to hum quietly as Tony looked at Steve before looking behind himself at the window to make sure no one was coming into the room.
Nebula rolled her eyes again. “My only is opinion is that we finish the job we came here to do in the first place, Gamora.”
Tony sank into his chair as he watched Steve run off to the restrooms, much like he had the morning after the party.
“Do they?” Obadiah questioned intently. His expression was beginning to make Tony more uncomfortable than he had already been.
They all piled into the helicopter before Natasha effortlessly maneuvered them up and away from the island. Tony joined her in the cockpit, pointing out toward the island as they rose into the air.
