They never talked about all the rancid-smelling corpses accumulating in the open air while walking in London before, perhaps because they both knew they would be uncomfortable to mention it, and realize how indifferent they came to feel about this situation. That city made them live near things they wouldn’t have stood to see in normal circumstances. Who knew where it could escalate? They could be the next people to be buried in the overflowed cemeteries in a month or a week. This constant fear had been a part of their daily lives from a long time, but Steve deeply feels in his bones that both of them deserve better. And now, it’s the right moment to make some real change.
“My daddy does that too.”
“I don’t know about this,” Steve said. He looked over the collection of fine silks and silver and gold woven muslins laid out by the dressmaker’s assistant. The fanciest dress he’d owned to this point had been a fetching sprigged muslin he’d bought his last time in the capital city. But admittedly, Steve was weak for blues, reds and whites and the dressmaker had brought a variety of hues.
Is it even possible for two Omegas to forge a romantic bond as strong as one between an Alpha and Omega? Furthermore, the need for an Alpha is so overwhelming for people of his kind, especially during heats, it’s almost impossible to deny it or live without it. Betas paired with Omegas are rare for a reason. Unless his teachers had biased opinions on that matter and had taught him wrong for whatever reason. Tony realizes he had learnt as much from his companions as from the education his family provides for him. For, there was a time he heard crude gossips from his group of friends, during an afternoon tea session. They had chatted excitedly about that embarrassing situation where two Omegas, acquaintances of theirs, were rumoured to have been caught in the middle of the night, almost naked and locked in a passionate embrace. Needless to say, no matter how true or false these accusations were, it had ruined their reputation for good. Tony never heard of them again. He wondered at times where they could be.
Steve blushed as the dressmaker and her assistant held up fabrics against his skin. Out of the corner of his eye, he caught Tony daring to sneak looks as Natasha and Steve talked about which fabric would be best for the ball.
Take care people, and may you find many treasures on your own personal Stony road!
Jarvis doesn’t say anything when Tony stays in his father's workshop to spend his few and precious hours of building, dismantling rifles and pistols, instead of saluting Mr Rogers and his Alpha partner when they deliver the usual bags of flour, sugar, stacks of eggs, and bottles of milk. Jarvis keeps his mouth shut as well when Tony draws the curtains closed so he wouldn’t see the blonde Omega's tired and resigned face outside the windows. And Jarvis doesn’t utter a single word when he finds the young master crying in the library one night, but he does bring a cover to warm him, some sheets of paper and drawing tools he could use to make progress in the schematics of new vessels he recently imagined.
“As well as can be expected,” Tony muttered.
“Now or never, Rogers,” he muttered to himself as he dialed Matt Murdock, Esquire’s phone number.
“Potato potahto, you’re missing the point. The thing is, Rogers, even though you are the very image of a modern major general, and while you know that my respect for you on the field as an athlete is
said Clint, but his tone was tempered by admiration as he inspected the wad of gauze before jamming it between his back teeth.
,” Peter mumbled under his breath.
“Ten bucks says they call the county truancy officer,” said Bruce.
They all looked. Some three feet above the door, there was a rusty, folded fire escape that zigzagged up the side of the building. Scott Lang squinted at it. “Ah, shit.”
“The fuck, Barton?” Tony muttered.
“Uhh…. thanks?” said Steve, because he wasn’t sure what else to say to that.
“Didn’t see the—didn’t see the
“Sounds big,” muttered Steve distractedly, reading the same explanation of molar weight for the third time with no appreciable meaning seeping into his brain. Giving up, he tossed the textbook aside. “How’s the projector going?”
“Nope. Egg salad,” Stephen Strange said.
I was rubbing off on you,” Barton said with smug equanimity, floating on his back like an otter and spitting a high streamer of water in the air. They let him float, mainly because it was funny to watch his eyes widen when he realized that the yell of “Cannonball!” coming closer was Thor, and furthermore that it was far too late to get out of the way.
me call some people I can interc—”
“Pull over, I got the shawarma shits.”
“It’s not pessimism, just facts,” said Bruce. “The pessimism comes in your outlook on death.”
The shocked group leapt into action, grabbing Tony by the shoulders and wrists to pry him away from Barnes as Steve threw his body between the two.
“He killed my mom,” said Tony.
“To own one, yeah. If it works like a taser.”
“No. Stark! No. Really?”
Natasha tilted her head quizzically to the side, and he struggled to think of a way to make himself understood, struggled in a way Natasha clearly didn’t need to. Why would she ever struggle, when she walked around the world in a body that was like a poem? In the end, he settled on a word in Italian that he hoped she knew.
“Why aren’t there any windows?” asked Peter.
Steve looked guilt-stricken. “Guys. I’m so sorry. I had no idea you would follow me. I wouldn’t have left so… suddenly. If I’d known.” He made eye contact with Tony, who flushed warm from collarbone to hairline. “You don’t have to go with me to Delaware. I’m sure you’re already in a lot of trouble as it is, and if you want to go back to SHIELD—”
“Right?”
Everyone in the back of the van looked at Thor until he hunched defensively. “It was for Loki’s own good. We sent him to a lesser country, it’s not as though we sent him into space.”
“Shut up,” Steve grumbled, aware that his cheeks were heating further even as he spoke.
“Let’s get one thing straight,” said Tony. “I don’t care how long you were in that coma, you’re not getting top bunk. I get off up there, it’s convenient and private and I don’t have to worry about getting ogled by our friendly resident RA-slash-tyrant overlord,
you one. You
“This guy?” Clint replied. “Yeah, I’m not thinking it’s a problem.”
“Sorry,” Steve said. “Stealth’s a hard habit to overcome.”
“Tony, I swear to God, you offer me that taser one more time I’mma jam it up your ass,” Lang responded. “Now, shut up so I can concentrate. Make yourself useful.”
were his passenger. Sealed record because you were a juvenile, a
“I’m sorry, I know it’s past curfew,” said Steve. “I went for a jog, hurt my foot. Decided not to run back.”
“That’s a state park,” Peter Parker observed.
“They are medically rare,” Bruce admitted. “Though, apparently, not in our friend group.”
Thor, grimacing as he rose from the ground, wiped the small, sharp pebbles from his hands. “Aye, I am sure you did,” he said graciously to Barton. “Would you like to loosen the others before I begin on them?”
A tiny knot of Barton, Thor, Peter, Bruce, Tony and Sam formed around him, looked. All nodded in unison.
“Five years in the circus,” Barton said, not looking at Tony as he turned the ignition and threw the clutch in. “Had my CDL at sixteen.”
What Tony did was straddle Steve’s chest, pressing him into the mattress. “No you’re not,” he said, conversationally, feeding the finished ends of the ropes into the ends of their knots and snugging Steve’s wrists more firmly against the slats. “But that’s okay. You’re all tense, you haven’t been properly fucked in ages, no wonder you’ve been acting like a total bitch.”
“Because coma patients don’t care if it’s light,” said Bruce, and everyone turned to stare at him.
“BAM, anticipated. Anticipated! I’ve already called the X-Men, they’re happy to take point for a few days. NEXT OBJECTION.”
“Is that a fact,” said Steve.
Steve said warningly. Barton’s posture was relaxed, his shoulders loose, but his eyes were rock-steady, fixed on Stark—Steve thought that of all the people he would very much like
“Friend Tony, quit this!”
“All right, everybody get your stuff in the Jeeps,” Happy yelled from behind them, puffing under an armload of luggage and already reddening in the Mediterranean sun. “We got limited daylight and the roads aren’t great on this island.”
As the group piled in, Steve sidled up next to Tony. In an undertone, he said, “I really won’t blame you if you wanna get them back to campus. They shouldn’t be paying for my choice.”
you get here so fast, anyway?” Tony said.
“And to think they put other people’s kids in this,” Scott Lang said virtuously, as Thor stepped forward and wrapped both meaty hands around the iron’s handles. Straining slightly, he tugged—and the nut gave way immediately, dropping him to the gravel.
“You are the worst Ultimate Frisbee player ever to be amazing at Ultimate Frisbee.”
“The Unabomber?” Clint suggested.
“That’s not a road, it’s a river!”
Maria handed over the clipboard wordlessly, and Steve could swear he almost saw the trace of a smile hiding in her lips.
Two hours later, with three of the group helplessly entangled in a thick morass of greenbrier, Clint spoke again: “I want it on record that I hated this fucking forest the first time.”
“His butler,” Steve said, eyebrows raised. “Isn’t that… a little old-fashioned?”
“This is NOT what New Haven is supposed to be like,” said Tony ten minutes later, as they all studiously avoided eye contact with the low-slung turbo next to them, where the ratio of passenger to Adam’s-apple tattoo was 1:1.
“Alright,” said Tony. “Well, if you wanna talk, you’re gonna have to follow me to the can. Is this one of the Sheetz with nachos?”
“I can help dig for records,” said Sam.
“That’s all I gotta do? Listen to you and then go on my way?”
“Wow, that’s a lot of deflection from someone who’s just stolen a van to chase down his boyfriend,” said Scott Lang.
Steve could have sworn he heard a tiny puff of breath—a snort, almost—from where Natasha was bent over her linoleum. Nah. Couldn’t have been. Natasha didn’t understand English.
Natasha stepped up to Thor’s broad shoulders and drew a line with her fingers to the crest of each shoulder. Then, quick as a flash, she was standing and balancing on his back, graceful as a circus dancer; she reached up, found purchase on the rusty ladder rails, and pulled the entire clattering apparatus down to the level of the loading dock, stepping lightly from Thor’s shoulders to the ladder at the moment it landed. She wiped her hands with an expectant look at Tony. “Are we climbing or talking?” she said innocently.
“You know, for someone who just learned English, like,
“This
“Huh?” Steve said, and then he saw the rope Tony was holding.
Of course, then Steve kissed him, big nose nudging Tony’s out of the way, big hands moving to cup Tony’s skull, and it got way more than
“Because it’s a discussion that occurs with surprising regularity,” said Tony. “Pep gets on one of her health kicks, Thor brings home a new girlfriend, not to be sexist or in any way imply that the ladies in our life like to litigate the amount of kale we eat,” he added as Pepper walked by their pool, visibly rolling her eyes but continuing on her way. “But it’s surprisingly handy to have an all-purpose definition of what constitutes salad for whenever one’s health credentials are questioned. Speaking of which,” he said, watching Happy lower himself gingerly into the hot tub containing May, among others, “Shouldn’t someone tell Happy that men with high cholesterol shouldn’t be in hot tubs?”
“I did,” said Bruce. “Hope you don’t mind purple.”
“You a weird little dude, you know that?”
“A line if ever I heard one,” Tony said, but crawled in next to Steve, who arranged the covers over them both. “Did you used to use that with the boys in the Army?”
“Dear God,” said Tony. “Please, someone find me a point of entry.”
“Yeah, well, as it turns out, he couldn’t,” Tony griped, following Sam through the door of the convenience store.
“Six ways from Sunday, I know. What kind of a moron would go skinny dipping in that? Why even bother putting security cameras on it?” Steve was about to protest farther, but then Tony, still trotting backwards up the hill, pulled his sweatshirt over his head and the words died in Steve’s mouth. Tony’s skin was pale and his frame was kind of wiry, but he was sleek and muscled as an otter, and the line of fur heading down into his jeans was dark and—
“So once we get to this quasi-military school,” said Bruce. “Do you think they’re just gonna let us in the gate?”
Things like: “I wanna take you to my parents’ vacation home in the Hamptons.”
“Just talented that way,” said Tony. “Hey, has anyone seen Thor?”
“Ooookay,” said Tony. “Anyone wanna bet if this place takes American Express?”
Tony woke up next to the most gorgeous man he’d ever seen, and had a solid twenty minutes of making out before he had to slip downstairs to the suite where he and Pepper were staying. Not that he was ashamed, or anything—he just didn’t necessarily feel like explaining the finer points of their arrangement to, say, Thor. Not at eleven o’clock in the morning with a hangover.
“I don’t know,” said Tony. “I think we went the wrong way on the Yellow Brick Road.”
, Barton?”
“Have some hope, Banner, haven’t you ever done anything really awesome and gotten away with it?” Tony said.
“You could’ve had me without playing Ultimate,” Steve pointed out. “I could still be maintaining my illusions of greatness.”
“That was a Tivo, Tony, this is your
“I will keep that in mind,” said Shuri, grinning. “Really, you should have seen the begging I had to do to get my brother to agree to this vacation. He is such a workaholic. I had to bribe him.”
“Wh—Barton!” Steve sprung up, running a hand through his hair and stepping away from the bunk, feeling himself turn bright red.  Looking curiously at Steve, Tony curled up from the bunk as lightly and gracefully as he did everything else. “Hey, Barton,” he said, as if nothing out of the ordinary was going on, “What can I do you for?”
“I’m not ashamed to be seen kissing you,” Steve told him. “I’m not in the closet or anything like it. I just didn’t know if you were ready to, you know. Be public with me.”
Not the type of serious with feelings. The type of serious with
Steve gave him a rueful look, then nudged past Tony and reached shoulder-deep into the thicket of pale, hairy-looking canes. He rummaged around for a moment, then withdrew a fistful of berries, glowing red as cold-water tuna. He popped one in his mouth—Tony watched the berry disappear—and offered the fistful to Tony. “Want one?”
“Oo could ry,” said Barton around the gauze as Steve let himself out the infirmary door and into the hallway. There was music—muffled, faint music, but music—still coming from the ballet studio. Someone was dancing, this late at night? Steve wavered, weighing the possibility of running into Hill against the terrible awkwardness of going back into a room with a pissed-off Tony Stark. It didn’t take much weighing.
“Sir yes sir,” said Barton, darting out of his chair (damnit—Steve had just gotten the corner of the desk where he wanted it) and out the classroom door. None of the other teachers would let Barton out of class, because Barton would never come back to their classes. He’d get found three hours later, climbing the stacks in the library or the ivy on the outside wall of the Academy or a cheerleader named Bobbi. But Coulson always sent him on errands, and Barton always came back to Coulson’s class.
Tony looked around. Everyone else was vaguely trying to look as though they were busy keeping watch. The administrative building was completely deserted, Sunday-quiet. Occasionally, the A/C would click on with a soft whirr. Tony hated the soft administrative Xerox-scent of this building—something about it went right up his ass. “Does this feel weird?” he asked Steve, who was standing next to him, ams folded. “Being back here like this?”
“I’m an independent freelance masseuse and personal therapist specializing in romantic issues,” said Carol, and grinned around a forkful of cherry pie.
“Not Clint and his really big magnet?” came Sam’s voice from somewhere on the stairs behind them.
“You,” Tony said. “You need to relax. I mean it. And I am focused on the game, that’s why I’m saying this. You’re stressed and not sleeping and not relaxing. And I need my team captain rested. So you,” said Tony, climbing back into the bed and straddling Steve. “Are gonna let me tie you to this bedframe. And you’re gonna let me do whatever feels good to your body, for as long as it feels good.”
“Oh, then we’re definitely in trouble,” said Bruce.
—” at this, Steve cracked a smile—“And like, do situps and shit.”
“Well then, I can think of nowhere better for her to sit than next to you, Barton,” responded Mr. Coulson kindly. “She’ll hear plenty of it. Rogers, budge up a seat.” Steve did, and Natasha slid behind him, hunching her shoulders to hide behind Steve’s back. Once she was back there, Steve didn’t hear a peep out of her for the rest of class period. He guessed that his days of getting emulsified by desk-rattle were over.
“I’m not made of gold,” Tony muttered. “I mean, I have gold but not enough for a human mill.”
Steve had no idea why there needed to be hats, or why they needed to be matching, or why MJ was involved, but he let his brain rest on the idea that he affected Tony the same way Tony affected him.
At the moment, Steve was waiting for all the students to be ready to finish washing up from lunch so they could start arts and crafts time. They were going to be making hats for themselves that day, since they had just read Caps for Sale that morning and Steve could not wait to see what his class came up with. He was already sure that MJ would want something that could sit on top of her hair and not have to contain it, but he also knew it wouldn’t be a tiara. Nebula - he had so many questions for her parents about that name - would make a space helmet, Harley would make a hard hat, but he didn’t know what Peter would create.
Natasha kindly saw to removing Tony’s things without letting Steve know what was left behind. Steve knew he’d be hurt if he saw any of it.
Steve sighed. “Tony won’t be staying long.”
“You should rest a bit,” she says with a concerned frown. “You don’t look so well.”
“What about him?” Steve flushes, his whole body and voice tense like a bowstring, on the defensive, ready to launch some arrows.
“An Omega, you refused to mention to us, is the reason why you felt so troubled you had to isolate yourself. From me. From your father,” she states in a low voice, detaching each word methodically. Yet, fear and uncertainty are showing in her posture, her shoulders and back straightened, her neck rigid. Tony can smell something sour in her usually sweet and honeyed Omega scent.
“Another dance then?”
“A ball. Hosting a party would be good for you,” Natasha pointed out. “Weird recluse is not a good look, Steve.”
Tony and Steve are finally where they want to be and things start to heat up <3
Steve gives the handkerchief back to her, forming sentences in his mind and hoping they could spark an interesting conversation for the both of them, but the sound of the ticking clock warns him he has to rush. So, he returns to his task regretfully. She nods at him politely, then takes an admirative glance at the golden flowers he’s embroidering.
“Nope,” Tony sighed. “Walken’s gonna hold it up. Mysogynistic dingabat.”
“I’m sorry to disturb you, sir. I wanted to inquire of anything you may need.”
“I’ve been busy,” he said.
"Hey, Steve! It's okay! You don't have to justify yourself. You did nothing wrong," Tony says in a pleading tone. "I've had my share of scumbags. I know how it is to have an itch to scratch, and sometimes the only option you got is something coming from the trash can."
There were other times the conversations were about nothing at all… until they were about something.
“Can I have your email, buddy?”
Tony waved off his concerns. “They know I was on a business trip and will not be expecting me. I am trying to contact them so they will come for me.”
,” Matt reassured him.
Of course you do, Steve bit back a smirk. He adored MJ and would basically punch anyone who dulled her inner fire later on in her life. “Ah, so then Peter is your consort.”
He hadn’t heard about the fair folk since he left for sea. Even though he kept the ways his ma had taught him and had the kitchen maid leave out milk and fresh baked bread.
“Do you think we can get your dad to come with us?” Steve whispered conspiratorially to Peter.
“I never thought I’d say this,” Steve addressed the air, “but I feel bad for the guy.”
He tugged on the unfamiliar jacket. Tony had decided to attend the ball as if he was human. Complete with carriage, giant human size, and silly human clothes. Though he had to admit that the jacket and formal breeches were more comfortable than his usual fairy clothes. And the gold embroidery on the jacket lapels and tails added a very nice touch.
Tony looks at the fountain so he won’t meet her gaze directly. He lets the silence linger on a bit longer to gather his courage.
“Do you want to play Uno with me before they come back?” Steve asks louder, his arms standing rigid by his sides as if he could snap at any moment to slap someone’s face.
Tony however seemed determined to work all day and all night on whatever he was building. Steve had no idea where the grease marks on his face and arms came from or the burn marks on his clothes. He was working on a variety of contraptions made of metal gears, wooden levers, and glass bits. It all resembled clockworks more than anything else.
(See the end of the chapter for
The night will be long.
An ancient memory prompted,
The music started up again, and Steve suddenly appeared next to Tony with an expectant and hopeful smile on his face. Tony melted and offered his hand for the next dance.
“You’re still reminiscing about the Alpha who hurt you?” she inquires with a worried glance at her son.
“I had the whole staff protecting me!” Tony stands up and starts to pace, rising his arms in aggravation. “I’m not a child who always needs to be watched for every minor thing! Besides, he was an Omega! He's one of the most gentle and brave souls I ever encountered. He would have never hurt me…”
His partner was clearly no match for Steve’s elegance.
Tony had to focus. He had a simple routine. He woke, tried his wings, got annoyed when his wings weren’t better, worked on signaling Rhodey or Pepper, made plans for how to stop the mill, talked with Steve, had dinner with Steve’s friends, and went to bed.
“I know what you’re going to say.” He rolls his eyes to the ceiling.
Steve hid a smile behind a gloved hand. He offered his arm to Tony. “Ready for dinner, Mr. Stark?” he said.
“I haven’t been to any events since I retired. So I haven’t needed anything.”
They met one year ago. Since that fateful day, Steve had always disliked him no matter what he did, and Tony had mournfully accepted it. There are some things you can't change or ignore, like the laws of physics, the limited resources of their planet, or the scorching picture which is ingrained in his mind-
“I was lucky to buy this estate -- a friend of a friend told me it was available and I was able to secure it for less money than expected.”
“Pastries and coffee?” Tony asked, seizing the opportunity.
“Hmm, I hope so.” She nods languidly. “I thought of growing mulberry trees for next year. Its berries are very good for sore throats.”
Just like the melody the blond played before, everything is on the right tune, no strident note, no interruption. They both speak in a very harmonious tone like they're both flowing on the same peaceful river. Tony had felt the strong potential of their connection since the day his mark appeared, right after he met Steve, and he is ecstatic he can finally see a glimpse of it.
Steve has no doubt Bucky will succeed.
“We cannot tell people that is how we met.”
Tony was good for Steve. That was all that Steve needed to say to people. He was eager to show off Tony at gatherings at the capital. He’d already confirmed a visit with Bucky and Sam over the holidays with Tony’s enthusiastic agreement.
Just maybe, just once, it’d be nice to get something he deeply wanted. It just wasn't meant to be with Tony.
“Hi kiddo,” Steve said, placing a kiss to the top of Peter’s forehead. In the two months since he’d said yes to the party, Steve’s entire world had gotten simultaneously more complicated and more wonderful.
At the same time as Steve was having his mind blown, Tony was wrestling to keep his anger under control.
“Never came up.”
“How long is he staying here?”
Despite Tony’s statements, he deigned to join them at dinner. Steve fussed about setting up a table and chair, as promised. Tony had brought with him a device that amplified his voice. Steve smiled proudly as Tony demonstrated the small machine to Steve’s friends.
“Yes.” Steve sighs in relief. “I’ll take anything, as long as I won’t need to stay inside the city. I’d feel safer if you could come with me.”
Besides, Steve was still human. Fairies and humans didn’t get along in the best of times. Tony lifted his wings, and felt immediately the unnatural tug on his right. He had to get better soon to get back to his mission and before he did something stupid like fall for the giant human.
“Fairy code?” Steve asked, a touch of skepticism seeping into his voice.
“I’ve heard much of your mill and wished to see if it would be a good investment.”
to relax in our gardens by your side. It was quite a bore to read, I can assure you…"
“Get me paper and I’ll make a list.”
“He’s not cutting down the part where we live. He could do better with the river powering his mill. He hates nature and would tear down the hills if he could.”
After five dances, they took a break from the crowded room and headed out to the gardens and the cool evening air. Many of the other ball attendees also had the same idea. Steve walked to the edge of the garden hedge. The full moon shone brightly above them. Steve’s jewelry sparkled in the moonlight and Tony longed to kiss him. He shouldn’t -- he wasn’t planning to stay and Natasha’s warning echoed in his ear.
“He did, yes.” Tony blushes.
Steve dug his fingernails into his skin, as his dizziness grew and his mouth ran dry. The slightest breeze on his skin made him almost groan.
In the company of thirty other Omegas separated into three groups, sweating through the new clothes their wealthy masters have bestowed on them for they were considered old-fashioned or too small for their sizes, Steve is actively sewing at one of the overloaded tables. Rich fabrics, frills, ribbons are passed from hand to hand, all covered in blisters and pointed needle cuts for the most inexperienced ones. As they struggle to repair some used stays and petticoats, Steve is working on a more complicated piece: embroidered silks for a formal gown. He has the keenest artistic sense in the entire group. That’s why he’s chosen most of the time to achieve the most sophisticated tasks by following patterns, though it stresses him to finish something so beautiful on a tight schedule. He has to be more efficient. Pearls of sweat pile up at the base of his hair, threatening to flow on his face. Steve is about to mop his brow with his hand when a handkerchief given by the coworker on his left crops up in his field of view. It is Angela, a beautiful blonde Omega. Steve gives her a bashful smile. Her name had marked him unlike the others for she has been very amicable with him since he started to work here, and people who aren't scornful towards him because of his scrawny and lanky figure are extremely rare. Even if he’s slow to reach for the handkerchief, she smiles gently at him.
Matt laughed in return.
What is the cause of these new and intense feelings?
Steve stares at him, his eyes wide open in bewilderment as if the sky has just torn itself in two to reveal a rain of falling stars.
Tony’s soulmark sends tingles all over his inner thigh, igniting a small fire in his belly, and sparks in his soft member. He coughs and rearranges himself to be more comfortable on his chair, but also to hide the evidence of his growing arousal. Steve fiddles with the hem of his shirt, lost in thought.
He was stuck here for the duration. Contrary to what humans thought, not all fairies were magical. Tony was an engineer and scientist fairy. Which made it hard for him as a fairy. His father had been particularly disappointed that Tony wasn’t keen on going into the family magic business.
Tony taps on the paper with his pencil, his mouth twisting in opposite lines, but Jarvis makes no move to leave. Tony bites his lips in frustration, then turns around to reach for Lady Virginia Potts’ letter. At the corner of his eyes, he can see a glimpse of a very personal portrait he never showed to anyone before, hidden between the pages of a sketchbook. He’s not talented at all to draw human figures. Enginery is the only thing which has an appeal to him in picturing except Mr Rogers. It’s just a silhouette with two bright blue dots on a barely sketched face. Yet, the value Tony attaches to it is very strong. His eyes well up in tears as he pushes the sketch further away, so he doesn’t see it anymore. Then, he opens Lady Virginia Potts’ letter with shaking fingers.
Thank you for the people supporting me through comments, kudos and likes U/////U I'm truly grateful and I hope you're having or had a good day!
“I could set up your own table and chair. My friends have been keen to meet you formally.” Steve smiled gently at Tony, hoping to persuade him. From their interactions he found Tony to be interesting and of substance. His friends would agree.
Tony and Steve have to move to a better location, more suitable to their needs UwU
“Because,” Peter said matter-of-factly as he ate his after school snack of peanut butter on apple slices, “Mr. Steve seems lonely and you seem lonely and I want you to have someone like I have MJ and Ned.”
“You’d better scrub that knot clean, Bucky! I swear to God - you had but one thing to do!”
When he was tired out by Tony’s love and his heat was spent, Steve stretched out and smiled tiredly at Tony. “Thank you for coming for me. Thank you for coming back.”
But back to Steve.
“I know I’ve been clumsy with you and you find me really annoying - Pepper keeps telling me I’m a hot mess - I didn’t mean to piss you off. I never wanted that-”
“Oh, Stevalicious,” Tony giggled. “Amateur mistake.”
Same warning once again :
Sam frowned slightly. “Do you think that’s wise, housing an alpha fairy in your dressing room? Is he attached?”
Tony considered his options while the human went off in search of breakfast. Wings, useless. He had a set of tools in his doublet but nothing to work on. Pepper wasn’t expecting him back for another week. Rhodey would likely consider sending out a search team, but they’re never going to find him in this place. Especially since he wasn’t supposed to be within miles of this estate.
“Dear Christ,” muttered Tony. “Lang, are we hot-wiring this thing or are we buying it a nice steak dinner? Get a fucking move on!”
Steve flushed, stumbling out of his jeans and into the fountain, where he had to catch himself against the SHIELD sign to keep from slipping. “Hey. It’s warm.”
“Hey, we’re all geniuses,” said Scott Lang soothingly. “Hey, look, a pawn shop! Think they have old-school Nintendo cartridges?”
“No,” said Natasha.
“Right,” Steve said to no one. “Good talk.”
“Jesus,” said Bruce, snatching the map. “OK, this isn’t terrible. We just missed the turnoff for 287… about an hour ago.”
“Why?”
Steve allowed himself to relax into the current of the lecture, a smooth river punctuated by little eddies of laughter and the occasional question—Mr. Coulson didn’t try to trip people up, but he wanted opinions, and he liked to take polls. Today’s poll asked if they believed monarchy could ever be a just system of government. And Steve was just about to get in a pretty significant argument over the issue with Carter the Brit, when the door to the classroom opened. Barton stepped inside, his arm around a tiny, huddled teenage girl dressed all in black, red hair falling across her face.
“Friends, it has occurred to me that we are all going to cause our parents much distress by disappearing in this manner.”
Peter shrugged. “Sort of, I guess?”
“No, I mean what’s his name
“You are
“OK, so this is all terrible,” said Bruce. Around him in the parking lot, seven SHIELD students sat, clutching various small injuries. Clint had what appeared to be a busted nose. Sam and Scott both had twisted ankles. Tony was clutching his eye and refusing to let Natasha, who had a flashlight, pry his eyelid open to take a look. “Who knew the forest was so full of things that are trying to kill you?”
A most convenient place to be in heat. Speaking of which, his skin has started to prickle since yesterday as if a thousand warm ants are running under it. Tomorrow, he will start to leak and become a desperate moaning mess once again, for his utmost embarrassment. Thank God, Bucky was in a too much similar state to make fun of him in these situations. Steve turns his head on the pillow to the sound of something clicking in the doorknob. He stands on his elbows, not wanting to rise from the comfortable bed, especially not to welcome his Alpha friend who must have taken a detour to reach him.
“It’s not your fault, Peter,” Steve smiled at the young boy, afraid Peter would get a complex due to his father’s irresponsibility.
She keeps smiling but there is a pained edge in the tone of her voice.
“Petey pie, we talked about secrets, remember? And that’s a big one,” Tony Stark said in a slightly strange tone as he scooped up his son and planted a bunch of kisses all over his face and head.
“Shut it, Buck,” Steve mumbles with a tired smile on his face.
“I came back in to use the restroom - “
He stands up with the tissue in his arms once the other Omegas have ceased to stick to him, aligning themselves so it looks like Steve is walking in the middle of a royal alley with nobles surrounding him on each side. Once he’s close enough to a window, he opens his arms as wide as he can to display all the patterns on the silks. Light pinks, blues and greens are shining, interwoven in different flower shapes on the creamy base. The whole ensemble glows peacefully under the sun. Some Omegas have stopped in their motions to stare wistfully at the cloth Steve is showing delicately, like a precious treasure only reserved for the gazes of a selected few.
“Oh.” Steve’s face reddens significantly before wincing. “Yeah. I’m sorry too. He insisted we do it outside. I didn’t know anyone would come that early. I thought we were completely alone.” Steve peers at Tony from under his eyelashes.
Tony rests his head on his mother’s shoulder for a moment, then he makes a decision. He grabs the flowers, the book, and pats his mother’s joined hands in a clap.
His mother nods, her lips set in a grim line. She crosses her arms and rises to stand in front of him, gripping her elbows tightly as if she has to refrain herself to hold him in fear she would crumble under the weight of his admission. Tony thinks he couldn't bear it if she touches him.
“Isn’t it the fourth time she offered courting gifts?” his phlegmatic father asks, turning one page after the other. "I lost track of the count." He swipes away nonchalantly the crumbs out of his book before closing it, completely at odds with the chaos disrupting his son’s mind.
(See the end of the chapter for
And it's a wrap, folks!
“Time to get that happily ever after, baby,” Steve whispered and threaded his fingers through Tony’s. “And my answer is yes.”
“What’s the cover, exactly?”
“Dad had a big meeting today with Auntie Pepper and Grandma Peggy. He had to fly all the way to Washington and yell at the people in the big round house,” Peter continued. “He told me all about it last night. Dummy went, too.”
Matt corrected himself and Steve could hear a smile in his voice,
“No problem," Tony says in a stilted voice, annoyed at hearing Steve admitting he enjoyed what Rumlow did to him. "It happened to me many times before. I don't want you to be embarrassed about it, that’s all.”
“No, she doesn’t,” Steve whispered into their kiss.
“Come on, Stevie. Close your eyes and think of Mr Stark.”
“He asked me if Mr. Steve could come to his party,” Tony said. “Would Mr. Steve like to come and meet Grandma Peggy and Auntie Pepper and Uncle Matt and Uncle Rhodey?”
Steve’s head whipped up from his phone to see Peter standing in front of his desk. The kids were all supposed to be outside for recess, though, so…
“Well, are you going to lug me in? I don’t want Bucky to eat all the good cookies."
Squiggles? Does he mean wrinkles?
“I will be hosting a ball in six weeks.”
A small pause hangs in the air like an invisible hatchet ready to fall and sever Tony's head from the rest of his body.
, Tony. Do you want it to go into anti-theft mode eight miles down the road?”
"Sooooo, you got it bad,” Sam Wilson observed, lazily twirling a Frisbee on his middle finger and looking sideways at Steve.
“Don’t forget brilliant Ultimate Frisbee player,” said Tony, whose team had administered Steve’s a rather sound drubbing earlier in the day.
echoed some voice from deep inside Steve, in a calm clear tone like a great iron bell. It was a deep, placid, resonant certainty—a truth, impossible to ignore. And yet Steve wasn’t afraid—because underneath that thought, there was another note, ringing, chiming out, creating harmony with the first thought:
Baxter Country Day. Hydra’s not till August.”
“Sure is. I brought wine.”
“Thanks. It’s not Michael Bolton’s den of sin, but it’ll do,” said Tony, and Steve looked confused. “Nevermind, it’s not important. Come on, let me show you the room you want.” He lead Steve to the second floor and far out the left wing of the building until they came to the last door on the inside of the curve. Letting it swing open, he gestured for Steve to pass through first. Ducking under the low threshold, Steve sucked a breath in. “Tony…”
“Ah, young love,” came a voice from above the table, and everyone was startled to see Tony Stark standing there. Even Barton, fist tangled in Lang’s hair, strained to look over his shoulder. “Tony? That you?”
me? Coulson, it’s always been Coulson, Barton’s been carrying a torch since shortly before the continents separated. It’s kind of sweet but mainly frustrating,
,” Tony said, swirling his thumb over the tip of Steve’s cock.
“You stole it with me, that’s conspiracy, shut your face hole,” Tony warned, and Lang beamed.
“It was an accident,” said Steve.
“Fair point.”
The boy’s voice was a creak. “That’s right.”
“I can’t believe this.”
“…Does it count if you have a driver?”
“Seriously, man. Uncool. We are a team. Leave no man behind.”
. He couldn’t have waited until we were in the building.” With that, he hoisted himself over the edge of the roof’s ledge and jogged across the wide tar-paper expanse, heading to a small shack that stuck out of its center. Leaning on the handle, he muttered, “Please be an unlocked door, please be an unlocked door, please be an unlocked door—yay!” as it swung open beneath him. Heading down the darkened stairs within, Tony dug in his pockets for his cell phone. “Siri, launch flashlight app.” The white light illuminated a narrow staircase littered with cigarette butts and scratch-off tickets, then a door marked “Access to 4
“Don’t mention it,” said Tony, already backing out of the room. “It’s been here for you since you joined the team.”
“Oh, now then, we’re going to have a problem, Wilson,” said Tony, voice dropping down into rippling threat.
“Christ, and I thought
“She’s not gonna like the girlie packaging.”
Tony snorted. “No might about it. That Ross guy is an Acme dynamite kit.”
those work out, anyway?”
“Yeah. Um. That’s. Yeah. Really good to hear.” Tony’s eyes were scanning Steve a mile a minute, like Steve’s face was written in very small print.
Steve’s grin didn’t budge. In fact, it got bigger as his eyes stayed steady on the horizon, until it was a mischievous moon, splitting his whole face in half. “I’d like that,” he said.
“He’s never been on a private jet before,” Hope Van Dyne added helpfully. “He agonized the whole way over about how much you were supposed to tip the flight crew.”
“Woah, I’m sorry, I’ll leave,” said Steve, putting his hands up and backing towards the door. “Please. Don’t stop on my account.”
“No sir,” he whispered, so faint even he could barely hear it.
“Yeah,” said Bucky, “As long as you steer.”
“What,” Steve said to the bird. Right on cue, thunder rumbled overhead, and a clump of rhododendrons overhanging the driveway decided to dump its cold leaf-load of rainwater right down the back of Steve’s neck. “Yeaaargh,” he said, shaking the water out of his sweatshirt. Then he looked up at the white, flat sky. “Alright, alright, you made your point.”
“Stop talking,” Steve told him, and then they were kissing, and oh God, he was kissing Tony Stark who was his roommate and a spoiled trust fund delinquent and kind of a dick, if Steve was honest about it, and… it was spectacular, was the thing, black fireworks were going off behind his eyelids and Tony’s warm, dense body was crowding up against him the same way Tony’s tongue was in his mouth—insistent, demanding. A lot like Tony, actually.
“No. You, is OK,” she said, and then pointed at the auditorium benches. Then she placed her finger over her lips.
“I gotta get me one of those,” Tony muttered as the sleek craft descended. “Hey Lang, think you could hotwire a Wakandan aircraft?”
“Only if you haven’t been underneath it,” said Scott. “I’m really surprised they transport kids in this thing.”
“Didn’t mean to disturb,” said Steve. “Just wanted to see who was dancing.”
“Uhhhhh, I can’t tell if you’re mad at me for that, so, uh, depending on that, no?”
“Isn’t that guy a little old to be Steve’s ex?” asked Scott, and was promptly elbowed in the ribs by Bruce. “Ow! What was that for?”
“Just one of us, actually,” Steve said, stepping aside so the nurse could see Bruce’s arm.
“I don’t think you’re in danger now, but I agree,” said Bruce. “It’s possible you may have encountered a hallucinogen when you fell into the well. Maybe a pocket of natural gas trapped underground that you disturbed when you fell, a fungus, some kind of spore…”
that,” Strange huffed as he dropped into the waiting limo. “I was going to use Carelli's Spell of Forced Mortal Astral Extraction upon him.”
“Like a charm that never happened,” said Barton. “But this one’s not for me. I need a taser. For Tasha.”
“Wh-heeyyyy,” said Tony, aiming for casual and falling short. “Hey Sam, what’re you up to today?”
“Bet I could find a way to make us fit,” Tony said, nipping at the underside of Steve’s chin, pulling a high-pitched whine out of him.
“You’re… ahh—you’re gonna get us expelled.”
“Don’t embarrass him over it, it’s kinda sweet,” said Bruce. “Or, you know, would be. If any of us were in relationships.” Everyone quietly noted how Bruce’s eyes flicked involuntarily to Natasha at the end of that sentence.
“And he just, happened to pick yours?” said Bruce.
was dark,” said Clint.
“Sort of,” Steve admitted. “I won’t make that mistake with your tech again.”
“Good boy,” Tony said, lightly, almost casually, all the threat gone out of his voice as his gaze flitted up Steve’s arms to the spot where Steve’s traitorous hands—completely without his permission—had begun to wind themselves around the slats of the bed. “Eager, are we?”
“Why would you write that into the bylaws?” asked Peter.
Thor announced.
“I’m never having sex in the dorms again,” said Steve flatly. “It’s nothing but camping from here on out.”
Tony winced. “I’ve got three exes on crew.”
of coma patients?”
“Simple. Just find some exposed skin and zap. I haven’t gotten it to go through cloth yet.” Tony sniffed. “That’s coming. Oh, and don’t put it on someone’s eyeball unless they really piss you off.”
“Maybe not,” Steve said sheepishly, and Carol wiggled her fingers at him in the universal gesture for ‘give’.
“Pit stop!” Tony announced, making a too-sharp right turn into the Sheetz gas station. “Who’s hungry?”
“Sir, when did tofu become such a thing?” Steve asked on his way out the door.
“No sweat,” said Clint, nasally. “’Snot like it’s the first time. Heh. Snot.”
“They called you but you were swimming,” Steve points out. “They asked me if I wanted to join them, but I preferred staying to make some salad for dinner,” he shifts to touch the piano keys reverently. “I don’t regret it. I played with that old guy for a bit.”
Why did he behave in such an impulsive and lewd way that night? He flushes in mortification as he recalls how aroused he had smelt and the wetness dripping on his skin. Mr Rogers had only touched his face yet managed to reduce him to this state! His teachers would have baulked at his tasteless behaviour. Smelling aroused in public is the most embarrassing situation to be in, adults tolerate it when it happens by accident in the early stages of adolescence but he is twenty years old; he should know how to control himself! Jarvis is the one who should have taken care of Mr Rogers wounds. He even volunteered, but Tony had immediately interfered to do it in his stead, rushing to the Omega’ side into such close physical proximity that his mother, who always encourages him to be nurturing and kind to Omegas, would have disapproved. At first, Tony thought he acted out of compassion because he couldn’t bear the sight of an Omega in pain, but he has since realized that an unhealthy dose of dishonesty had clouded his judgment and his morals. He had enjoyed touching Mr Rogers. He had taken advantage of the situation so he could share a private moment with him, regardless of the consequences.
“It’s not magic!” Tony insisted. “It’s all science and natural philosophy. No magic needed. I save my magic for special occasions.” He sorted his papers together. “There’s nothing worse than technology used badly.”
Being inferior to him, serving him every day to finally see him being courted, married to someone else because that's how it will happen. Steve feels his blood runs cold just at the mere idea. He regrets not having the time to know him better when his family was a client of the bakery he was fired from. Steve still longs for the potential moments they could have shared together, all the conversations which will never take place, especially after what happened in the library. Yet, his practical sense dictates him it's preferable that Mr Stark remains a fantasy, if he wants to keep his feelings out of harm.
Stark’s phone must have rung at that point, because he stopped, looked at the device and sighed heavily.
“I don’t want --” Steve started. “I could see the capital but not the Baths.” He wasn’t keen on revisiting his past with other retired officers.
Mr Stark would crawl naked on the bed and lounge there, waiting for Steve to come to him with bated breath. Steve would first caress him, his firm thighs, his arms, then the curve of his bottom, with feather-like touches only because he thinks Mr Stark craves the softest sensations. He would peck his erected nipples before sucking them, rolling his tongue on the light chestnut buds, eliciting moans the brunet Omega couldn't contain even if he wished to. Then, after Steve finishes to mark his collarbone, Mr Stark's red lips would open like an invitation, begging for more kisses, a distorted picture of the night they found themselves in the library. Steve would provide for him because he wants to be tender with the lovely Omega but not too much or he would be too greedy about it. So, he would refrain from kissing his swollen lips after the third time. Mr Stark would complain, wouldn't he? Who is Steve to deny him such pleasure when he offers himself so generously? It's only when he's on the brink of tears that Steve would gently spread his thighs to reveal his leaking cunt, hidden behind brown curls. What a glorious sight it would be.
But Steve had been born under a lucky star. He’d had a most fortunate life as a navy officer, wildly successful in battles, given his country’s hightest recognition and awards, and amassed a large and significant fortune wisely invested. His one indulgence was purchasing a small remote estate. He now had independence, respect and the freedom to do as he pleased when he pleased.
“Captain Rogers, to what do I owe the pleasure of your visit?” Rumlow said. True to his nature, he ignored Sam as a beta not worthy of his alpha attention.
“A ball?” Bucky asked skeptically.
Steve was particularly fetching today, his hair tied up in a blue ribbon matching his dark blue spencer. His lovely rose and sandalwood scent added to the enticing picture. Tony pinched himself. He had a mission and he couldn’t get distracted.
NSFW really starts here people!
"Yup. You can say that again," Steve sighs dejectedly. He blushes while grimacing. "Sorry, we made a show of ourselves. I mean - it felt good but still, we should have been more careful."
Thank you Swisstae for having cheer-reading me and correcting my mistakes :3 <3 You're always so helpful! Have a nice day folks! I hope you'll enjoy the story as we go deeper into it!
After a few days, when the heat is completely over and the pair is ready to leave the tavern, the blonde Omega decides it’s time to confess something.
“What happens when there’s a drought, Captain? The mill won’t work then.”
A quick assessment of the mill room yielded no tools like a hammer or an axe. Steve could do a lot of damage with an axe. Maybe that plank over there.
Tony looked at him with a blush across his cheeks. “I’m sorry, they just kinda-”
Natasha shared a look with Bucky and Sam because that was the signal that she had convinced Steve. “We can plan that out tomorrow.”
"Your mother and I cannot guarantee your financial security if anything bad happens to us both. Our estate, our house, it will all belong to your cousin. Unless you wish to depend on his unreliable charity for the rest of your days, I’d strongly advise you to find a suitable mate this year, as soon as possible."
“Do you miss flying?” Steve asked. He’d gotten too used to Tony being around. Maybe too used to seeing the fairy at breakfast, tea and dinner, talking about books, art, gardens, waterworks, whatever crossed Tony’s brilliant mind.
Tony's eyes prickle with tears when he sees it. On Steve’s back, very low on his left hip, so low it’s impossible to see it when Steve wears shorts or swim trucks, there is the twin of his soulmark. When Tony grazes it smoothly, they both come together.
“Don’t get to see your overly protective side that often,” Bucky replied.
Fan, you great owl, I hope these last pages of your prize satisfied you. It was a pleasure to make this for you :3
See you next week, for the last page <3 Once the comic is fully done, I'll make a post on Twitter with all the pages together with a few corrections on the panels (yes, I'm nitpicky).
Natasha pushed a plum slice towards Tony. “Tony’s right, Steve. Do you own any jewelry?”
After Tony watched them play cards in the drawing room, Steve brought him back to the dressing room. For the first time, Steve was reluctant to say goodnight, wanting to keep the evening going, to hear more of Tony’s intriguing stories and hear his laugh.
He hears Steve speaking some bits of broken sentences between their kissing, they're like the last missing pieces of an engine Tony had struggled to put together for so long: “You drove me crazy!”, "I hated it when you teased me so much.", “I panic every time you’re near.”, “Bucky kept telling me I’m scary when I’m too focused on something.”, “Tony, you feel so good.”. Steve sighs blissfully when Tony grasps his hard member through his beige shorts. They rut against each other, groaning, moaning in abandon. Steve grits his teeth in frustration, he opens his own shirt and throws it on the ground carelessly. Tony doesn't waste a second, he ensnares Steve's bony waist, catching his skin between his teeth. He leaves a trail of blooming, purple marks on his rosy neck, then he bites, and sucks hard on a spot right under his red ear. It’s the most delicious thing he’s ever tasted.
“Yeah, I heard. It’s beautiful.” Tony sighs with a smile.
-There is a mention of an attempted rape.
EDIT : Be attentive of the tags, I've added new ones and corrected a paragraph inside the story.
Within the hour, Steve had outfitted himself in a dark jacket, ascot, trousers and boots, his hair carefully combed. He looked every inch the naval hero he was, and an alpha to anyone sparing him a glance. He was a bit flushed, but one could chalk that up to exercise in the summer.
“I need to check on the food. I’ll be back, Tony,” Steve said.
The lube is actually taken from a real flavored lube (even though in real life that brand is used for handjobs/blowjobs) only here you go U_U : http://www.betterthanthehand.com/2017/03/16/flavored-lube/
It was far more than he could have expected as an omega born into limited resources with a father who died too young.
“It left my notice but I swear I will-”
Tony couldn’t find anything to counter her words. All the fights and fear slowly evaporate from him. Nothing happened as he expected. She guessed everything by herself, didn't soothe his worries but exacerbate them and he has been unable to hide his feelings correctly. The least he can do is admit she is right. He faces her, his heart pounding against his ribcage.
Sam, Natasha and Bucky had declined to follow Steve into retirement. Sam and Bucky kept a house in the capital and were happy with the occasional work they did for the government. Natasha traveled in her circles, clearly still engaged in the spy life. Steve had extracted a promise that they would visit when the estate renovations were complete.
“You will?” His mother asks, her whole stance filled with fragile hope. “I didn’t have the time to make better acquaintances with her but she seemed quite...proper, didn’t she?”
“Mr. Stark, Captain,” Tony said. He picked the last name out of the blue but it fit.
“The plan endures,” Tony commented and then took a breath and Steve turned his head to see Tony staring directly at him. “He’s officially in first grade? Right? You’re absolutely not his teacher anymore?”
“Time to be dads?”
“I don' wish to bond, Tony. I have more important matters in mind.”
“He set fire to your table,” Bucky replied, narrowing his eyes.
“Mr. Stark, nice to see you,” Sam said.
“I’ll drink water later,” he answers as he taps his forehead until it’s dry. “Here, thank you.”
Tony goes back inside the house after he finishes swimming laps in the pool. As he's creeping inside the kitchen, he stops at the faint sound of a melody ringing in the air, coming from the old piano. Aside from droplets dripping from his body to the floor, he stands motionless. When he hears Steve’s voice, humming, Tony feels like his body and his mind are slowly disconnecting from each other, nerve by nerve. He walks with discrete steps, so as not to break the spell the music has cast on the house. The melody hypnotizes him, inciting his muscles to relax to the point of feeling like they’re made of a gelatinous texture. He thinks he recognizes the composer’s name who made the music Steve's playing, but he’s not sure - Jean Sibelius, maybe? The walls and the creaking wood under his feet exude a softness that was never there in the first place. The soulmark he had tried to hide with concealer since summer started burns bright on his inner thigh, pulling him towards Steve like a beacon.
Steve almost rolled his eyes. Rumlow was the worst.
The brunet snaps out of his reverie. Steve has finished playing for a few minutes. Fuck. What can he say so he doesn’t look like a complete moron, planted as a piquet in the middle of the room, and only wearing his wet swim trunks? Quick, brain! Find something!
-Don't repost that art elsewhere without my authorization. If you want to see more of my art, go to @kappamairi on Twitter!
Steve comes hard with the culmination of Bucky’s hitting his sweet spot just right where it should, and the imaginary vision of Mr Stark’s gorgeous features strained by intense pleasure, sobbing unabashedly as Steve licks and eats his cunt. The echoes of his voice dissolve into the night when Steve and Bucky’s arousal peak drop down. After they wiped away their mutual dried fluids from their bodies, Steve rolls on Bucky's side.
“Her what?”
“We can talk about that more, Captain. I can see the wisdom.”
Tony linked his arm in Steve’s. “Gladly, Captain Rogers."
On the other side of the cloud was Steve’s cozy and private nest in his home. “How did you know, Tony?” Steve gasped.
“Peter,” Steve said softly, upon finding Peter curled into a corner of the coat closet during free play hour. “What’s wrong, kiddo?”
“I’m taking those to the laundry, then I'll run a bath for you, but don’t take too much time. Your mother is expecting you.”
He should return back to the house for cards with his friends. The sun was finally setting behind the trees, and the slight breeze was delicious on his skin. The breeze could turn cold shortly and he hadn’t brought a wrap with him.
“No,” Steve said because that had been a clear directive from the principle. No glitter on things that went home with the kids. There had been complaints.
Steve snaked his hand around the back of Tony’s neck and brought him in for a kiss. Steve’s tongue pressed along the seam of Tony’s lips and Tony braced himself for teeth and tongue and longing and instead, he got tenderness. When Steve pulled away, he pressed their foreheads together.
Thank you for your patience, folks. I chose to draw a bonus page with a bit of color on it as a gift for all the comments, kudos and gentleness you gave me through this comic. I'm happy you enjoyed it and expressed how much you loved it <3 <3 It was great to share this with all of you <3
“So, why did you avoid me?”
“But that was a big risk to take, Peter,” Tony said, realizing that being mad at his kid wasn’t going to get them anywhere. “How could you know that Mr. Steve would be a good secret keeper?”
“England,” Steve gently corrected and Peter nodded.
Tony laughed. “We’ll figure something out.”
Jarvis walks inside with a platter full of small cakes and a cup of tea. He puts it on the part of Tony’s desk which has not been assailed by any paper.
Sam walked up to Steve and looked down at the nest. “I’d been taught to leave out sweets and water for them to keep them out of the barn, but I’ve never seen one in person.”
“How is it going?”
Except that Tony did remember how lovely Steve’s chest had been, even if he did smack into it and Steve when flying at top speed.
-Anal sex
Tony wets his lips. What he will say will change what she thinks of him. Either he lies, pretends his attraction is almost gone. They could fool each other until they got tired of this new superficial relationship they built out of comfort or he finishes to reveal everything to the cost of putting a strain on their bond. How foolish he has been to think he would feel lighter by the end of this conversation.
“PETER,” Steve called, “CAN YOU PLEASE BE A LITTLE CAREFUL?”
Then he caught sight of a small bobbing light nearby. It was too early for lightning bugs. He turned to follow the bobbing light. He didn’t see it again. He turned around and something small and hard smacked him right in the chest. The small thing slipped down his chest and became entangled in the bodice of his dress.
“Invitations?”
“Having a potential mate can set one off early,” Natasha said teasingly.
After he wins two times and Steve gets his revenge for the third round, Tony thinks it’s the perfect moment to speak about what he saw and apologize for it. Who knows if he will get the chance to have a light and peaceful conversation ever again after this one. He scratches his arms and folds them over his chest, bending over the table, closer to Steve.
Instead Tony, returned to fairy size, flew from the dressing room under his own power.
“But he’s beautiful, Rhodey -- I can’t help it.”
Tony scribbles furiously on a large paper. His desk is a mess of drafts, shortened pencils, rules, compasses, and mathematical calculations regarding speed, displacement, and length. The rain pours outside of the window, the dark sky a stark contrast to the warm light of the candlelights. The rhythm of the raindrops soothes Tony’s mind so his focus is sharper than usual. He has been drawing and redrawing the schematics of an important merchant ship the whole day. Three large and strong masts, over 1700 tons burthen, much more than a regular Indiaman, heavily armed against privateers, pirates and potential ill-intentioned rival merchants.
This whole inheritance mess is the result of a mistake from his paternal grandfather, the late Edmund Stark, who put an entail to his estate.
“Tony,” Steve shoved his elbow playfully into Tony’s side and the other man still didn’t move. That’s when Steve turned to Tony and realized he was crying.
Tony kissed Steve and pulled him close. “I should not have left. I regretted it within minutes.”
Steve pinched the bridge of his nose. “It’s not like I have a choice now, do I?”
I hope you will enjoy this UwU <3
“Only if you think you can find doll furniture. Bucky’s good at whittling …” Steve looked up at a very skeptical Sam. “I’m responsible for him being here. If he hadn’t flown into me --”
The worst possible time for his heat to kick in. Now, Steve had worked missions before while in heat. But he and Sam were not armed, and there were likely to be civil consequences should Steve knock out Rumlow, not least of which would be a failure to close the mill.
Nat was right. He should hold a ball for the neighbors soon, when they left the hot streets of the capitol city to seek the cool of the countryside in the summer. Show off his renovated estate and make the important connections in the neighborhood. Captain Steve Rogers at your service, see my gardens and house.
Steve picked up the drawer. “Not with that wing.”
“An Omega.”
Grumbling, Tony crawled up and over the drawer lip onto the table. He had no way to signal Rhodey to come and get him. So he was stuck until his wing unsprained itself. Once on the table, he found that someone left him a dish filled with preserved and fresh fruit, bread, crackers, and candy with cups of milk and water.
When they arrived at the mill’s business offices, Sam asked Steve as they left the carriage, “Do you have any more of a plan now?”
“Can I do anything for you?”
The next day, his mother takes him to a morbid place in London. Tony blanches when he learns that it was there that two low-class Omegas were beaten, then hanged publicly, for they were caught having sex in a brothel. Alphas knotting one another receive the same treatment. As a Great Britain’s citizen, you can escape a brutal sentence thanks to your social standing, but nothing can save you from being exiled. During the entire trip back to the manor, Tony’s mother has grasped his hand and hasn’t let go when she mentions how a couple of Omegas in the countryside had tried to marry, by pretending one of them was an Alpha. The ruse didn’t last long, and they were forced to divorce. Some said they left the country; others claimed they were shipped away against their volition to an unknown place. No one had wasted their time to look for them. They were forgotten. Tony has crushed his mother’s fingers in petty retaliation. She isn’t responsible for any of this, but by God, he never felt so angry before! It’s as if someone has ripped a blindfold he wore his entire life without knowing it, and he was forced to see the truth even if it’s painful for his sight. Everything is ugly now. As the carriage follows its track offhandedly, Tony glares at the streets, glares at the buildings, and the strangers attending to their daily lives.

I started this story with something much shorter in mind but once I started diving into research for this era, I just couldn't stop @_@;
. Having two Alpha sons had made his grandfather immensely proud, yet he favoured Howard over Edward. As he grew older, he refused to divide his property, so Tony’s father inherited the whole estate. Edward received a house in the countryside he could live in comfortably thanks to Howard, but his rank in society had lowered significantly. Fortunately, he was good-natured, he never harboured any resentment towards Howard who always supported him financially and encouraged him in his military career. His fate turned brighter when he married the heiress of a wealthy commercial family and soon regained his prestigious social status. Years went by, but none of the brothers managed to break their father’s entail for they found themselves in a delicate situation: Howard and Maria had trouble to conceive an heir. Since the two brothers were courteous men and wished to respect their father’s wishes, they vowed that the first Alpha child born from one of them will inherit their estates and the manors they possessed. Edward and his wife soon gave birth to Gregory. Yet, a surprise disturbed their carefully-laid plans a few years later: Maria almost lost her life when she finally succeeded to deliver a son to Howard. It changed everything.
“I don’t know and I didn’t ask. I didn’t realize he was even an alpha until I got a slight whiff of his scent when I held him up to the window.”
The afternoon shadows grew long and Steve knew he had to return to the house for dinner. As he packed up his basket, he felt like he was being watched. His head snapped up as he surveyed his surroundings. It was an old feeling back from when he was in the Navy -- knowing when he was being watched. His first thought was that it was a fox or possibly a hawk.
Tony watched Steve make his way through the crowd and then turned to see Natasha’s sharp eyes on him. “Don’t hurt him,” Natasha said bluntly. “I’ve been looking out for him for years and Steve deserves an alpha that will understand him.”
When Tony asked him if he would ever want his hand in marriage, Rhodey had shaken his head and ruffled his hair.
“At least take Sam with you,” Bucky insisted while Steve waited for his carriage. “He’s reasonable.”
“Never said you weren’t, Anthony,” Steve replied. “Just remarked that you were.”
-Bites
“Hello?” the large human said.
Steve blinked at his phone and then stared towards the horizon where the Starks’ car had disappeared to. He wasn’t quite sure how long he stood there, but the sun was a little lower than it had been. He wandered back inside his classroom, gathered his things, and then headed to his car in a daze.
Yes, I have a headcanon of Thor being very sensitive and feeling when two people are having the best time of their life in bed UwU He's not the god of fertility for nothing <3
(See the end of the chapter for
"The nerve of this man!" His mother flushes in anger. "What did you answer him?"
“You should come to the capital for the fall season,” Bucky said. “We can make up the guestroom on the second floor of the house -- you’ve always liked that room.”
Rumlow immediately perked up at the hint of money. “Please step this way.”
“I don’t need -- fine, if you all think it’s a good idea.” Admittedly, Sam had a way of getting Steve out of situations that Steve felt his fists could resolve faster. He was on private business, not the King’s. Steve’s temper did add to the alpha illusion and a calming beta would help as well.
“Sure, let’s play!”
Sam asked about Tony’s friends. “Will they be looking for you?”
Steve was as angry as anyone else at the terrible situation for omegas in America. They’d once enjoyed quite a few more freedoms, but the 1980s brought a rise to power of a faction of incredibly conservative alphas who decided that omegas were not to be trusted as anything else but wombs. As a particularly small boned omega who’d had a lot of health problems growing up, Steve’s womb was pretty much closed for business and he resented that that fact meant he was useless in a lot of people’s eyes. He went to marches and signed petitions and canvassed for progressive candidates, but….
“But we never see them and when we do, it’s always about work and you get those squiggles in your face that mean you’re sad.”
“When I want to,” Tony said. At least standing with Steve’s friends would ward off any competition for Steve’s attention.
Steve Rogers did not play favorites. He’d been one of the kindergarten teachers at Allensville Academy since he got out of graduate school and that was one of his key pedagogical beliefs - no playing favorites.
“Are you okay?” the human said again.
On the second day, Tony’s wings still had not improved and he had ventured out into Steve’s bedroom as far as the sitting area. He had breakfast with Steve, drinking all the coffee offered, but barely looked at or talked to Steve. Then he retreated to the dressing room to work on some device through the day and into the night.
“Of course we would have! You’re an Omega. What if that stranger was ill-intentioned? Yes, he did save you, but he could have used this opportunity to attack you or steal anything in our home!” His mother retorts in an outburst of indignation.
“Clever,” Sam said.
No small victory for a kid who spent elementary school getting folded into cubby holes.
“Yes, sir would very much like to,” Natasha said.
“Lumber mill, I think. Not grist.”
Now that Tony was more fully awake and fortified with coffee, he got a better look at built-like-a-brick-house Steve. Designed by someone who liked their omegas large, muscular, attractive and endowed. “Tony,” he replied, holding out the thimble again.
Peter furrowed his brow. “Okay, Daddy. I’m sorry.”
“Right. Getting right on it.”
“Thanks, kid. Now, let’s get started on homework. What did Mr. Steve send you home with today?”
He stops. This is the hardest part. His mother folds her hands carefully on her knees.
“I don’t think so. He doesn’t seem to like humans very much.”
For Steve, heats are always a blurry and frantic mess of heightened sensations, lubrification mixed with sweat, Bucky’s dick sliding in and out, and short breaks for Steve’s fragile heart to rest because its beating was either too fast or too slow for no reason during the day. Sex, unfortunately, tends to increase the symptoms. Bucky intervenes immediately at the first signs, his calming pheromones appeasing him rapidly. It does the trick. Steve would say it’s even quite helpful at some times because it forces Bucky to slow down and to take his time for Steve’s pleasure, his hips rolling more seductively against Steve’s thinner ones, plunging his dick in his cunt slower. As Steve rolls on his back for Bucky to take him from behind, something wicked sparkles in the Alpha’s eyes. Steve should feel a bit alarmed by that - unwittingly aroused too - his friend can be such a trickster in bed when he feels like it but he lowers his defences when Bucky limits himself to caress his bony hips. He leaves a trail of kisses from his pointed shoulder blades to his neck where his bonding gland is pulsating, and then he dares to murmur:
“Jarvis, please. We both know this kind of speech is quite outdated.” Tony chuckles.
“I mean-” Tony interrupts himself.
“Dark and quiet, as best I can tell.”
Tony’s face told Steve all he had to know. His face felt red as he remembered his fond thoughts and unspoken hope. “I understand,” Steve said briskly. “You are a fairy on a mission and now that you are healed, you need to get to your work.”
“It’s fine, mother. Thank you for bringing Lady Virginia Potts’ gifts to me, I’ll answer her.” Tony says, rising from his chair.
Tony had run away the moment he fell upon that scene. Suffice to say, it had been a catastrophic way to start the holidays. He couldn't even remember if Steve had called his name or not while he fled. Everything had felt blurry and hazy for two weeks, a painful and brutal mix of hot and cold sensations, especially at night, when Tony was alone, sprawled sluggishly on his bed with the same thoughts running in circle in his mind. His mark kept burning like it never did since he had been wearing it. Tony couldn’t help scratching it when no one could see him.
“You mean…” Steve’s voice trembles and Tony is astounded at that because Steve hardly trembles, the rare times he does it’s because there is something he fears in front of him. And yet, he has never backed down to not confront it.
The thing that mystified him most was that this bundle of absolute joy came from their city’s most notorious alpha - Tony Stark.
Sam pushed Steve out the door and into the carriage, just as Steve’s knees turned to jelly. Settling hard into the carriage bench, Steve muttered, “It’s never been this bad, Sam.”
“It’s not enough for you.”
~~~~~
-Thrusting
“Yes, but there is… there is something else. Someone I met...No. I already knew him, no, saw him sometimes. But just for a bit of time. Well, this person protected me from the assault, the one Mrs Woodward mentioned in her letters and...” Tony stammers while rubbing his hands. “We shared a close time in the library because I tended to his wounds. And I… kept thinking about him.”
The bird’s wings flapped and flailed its little arms. Arms? Birds didn’t have arms. Steve’s hand curled around the small being and pulled it out. He opened his hand to reveal a small figure of a man with wings and in rich but old-fashioned clothes in gold and red.
“Hope you feel better soon,” Steve said to the fairy.
Tony told Steve he was going to barricade himself in the wood shed so he could avoid all humans. While Steve would have appreciated having Tony there, he couldn’t blame the fairy. All his neighbors and then some had accepted Steve’s invites and the house would be full of humans. Not a safe environment for an injured fairy.
“A list of things we can and can’t do -- not getting mixed up with humans or human business covers most of it.” Tony pointedly looked at the scrap of paper in Steve’s hand. “I’m wondering where my stuff is.”
Steve is very thorough when it comes to prep Tony for what's to come UwU The butt loving continues <3 <3 !
"It was a very entertaining evening," he says, stirring his spoon inside his coffee before taking a long sip. "People were exceedingly nice to me."
“Hmm, we’ll need to work on that,” Natasha mused. “We’d have to go to the capital.”
“So can good food and regular exercise,” Steve countered. “Sam, do you think that there is enough room for the musicians?”
“I...I don’t know where to start. I’ve been restless...” Tony answers bashfully.
“- and I saw you going bright red when you looked at your phone. My daddy does that too and when I ask him why he says it’s because Mr. Steve said something funny. So are you red right now because Daddy said something funny?”
If Tony didn’t have manners, he would have stopped dead in his tracks, drooling and staring at Steve gracefully taking his turn in the dance.
“You’ve dreamed of a full dress gown for years, Steve. You keep looking at that muslin embroidered with the spangles like a starved person looks at food.”
“That was quite the ceremony,” Tony remarked to Steve as Peter ran off briefly to go hug one of the classroom moms.
“You might meet someone -- a nice alpha or beta from the area, settle down for once.”
“Yes, that’s the word, Peter,” Steve affirmed and Peter nodded.
Not that he let that stop him now. His wardrobes and chests were filled with an appropriate wardrobe for a young-ish omega of means. He could order art supplies he’d only dreamt of while he was served in the Navy. He stocked his library with the latest in historical and scientific works.
Stark men are made of iron. He will find a way to get better if Steve doesn't want him back. He inhales.
“It’s real, honey,” Tony kissed Steve. “It’s real. Pep doesn’t lie.”
"Mother!"
Ned’s face fell, but he quickly brightened. “Can I put lots of dots on paper so it looks like glitter?”
Tony's butt is getting some passionate love tonight <3 <3 <3
Steve knew immediately why Tony had been so deeply offended at the mill. Overly estimating his engineering ability, Rumlow had designed his lumber mill in the least efficient way possible, clear even to Steve and Sam’s uneducated eyes.
Jarvis goes to the corner to sit on the chair, staring defiantly at Tony.
“I - I know you found a really good job. Mine’s good too but-”
“A crown,” Peter said solemnly. “Because MJ wants to be the queen and so I told her I’d be her helper person but we didn’t know what kind of hat they had and MJ said I could still have a crown.”
“I’d like to play with you later,” Tony said with a slight growl to his voice.
Steve exhaled through his nose. Sometimes Peter said things like this and it made Steve want to punch Stark. Who wouldn’t love everything Peter does? Why would Peter doubt that his father would love his crown?
He went around from child to child until he finally got to Peter. “Hey kiddo, whatcha making?”
Steve - gorgeous, gasping, blushing Steve - letting Rumlow having his way with him, sensually on display under the gazebo, the both of them hidden behind the large pines' shadows.
Tony, he thought with a smile on his face. Steve remembered the touch of Tony’s lips on his gloved knuckles. So different in intention than when he would take Tony from room to room in the mansion. Maybe -- maybe there was something there. Steve had not been in love before -- it had been too risky for his career to let anything progress beyond a slight infatuation. But now, he had nothing to fear.
“Sir. I would never allow myself to-” Jarvis claims in an offended tone.
Then, he noticed that the fairy looked worse for wear as well, with his tousled dark brown hair and slow blinking eyes. “Oh, you don’t look good at all,” Steve said to the fairy. The man had to be a fairy with those wings and his size. And Steve had a lot of experience identifying men with concussions.
So by the time it was 4pm and Peter was still waiting for his ride, Steve felt pretty snappy. Stark had notified the office that he would be late and that all his other rides had fallen through, but Steve was unsympathetic. What was more important than picking up his son?
Even though he had been dismissive of the ball when Steve first mentioned it, Tony had given into his ingrained curiosity. The constant discussion and planning had convinced Tony that it could be fun, especially the dancing. A small investment in magic usage and glamor spells and here he was in the crowd descending on the manse.
Tony cut him off with a longer, sloppier kiss. When he pulled away. “I’m in this and you know that. They don’t matter. They make money off of other people’s pain or distract themselves with it, depending on who ‘they’ are. Peter loves you, I love you, and hell, Pegs is about ready to adopt you.”
“Aye, aye, captain.” Bucky mocks him, putting his body even more on display to rankle the aroused Omega.
Steve nearly growled. “I’m not your buddy, and you have my email.”
Tony fiddles nervously with the buttons of his left sleeve. He didn’t spend any time with his parents when they came back from their travels two weeks ago. He retreated in his bedroom and refused to speak to anyone, except for Jarvis so he could rest alone. He can still recall the shock caused by the assault finally catching up to him, his body shaken to the core for days, remnants of fear and frustrated desire looping in his head. It seemed a better idea at the time than holding any conversation. Jarvis chided him for his attitude of course but Tony can be relentless when it comes to protecting his privacy, especially in times of duress. Unwittingly, the face of Mr Rogers comes to his mind once more. His soft touch, his smell, his hair, his voice-
“Hmm, I should rig a tent or something to make it darker,” Steve said, rubbing his chin.
He had full command of his house again and had come down for breakfast with Sam, Bucky and Natasha. He refused to talk about Tony.
“Now, do you wish to speak to me?” she asks gently.
Steve handed the list over to Sam. “There’s got to be a sewing basket around here. What do you think about the furniture?”
“Tony?” Steve says in a dazed voice.
“Same here. Any ideas?”
“It is true,” Jarvis sighs, then straightens himself. “Master Anthony, if I may, won’t you please honour the promise you made to your mother and answer Lady Potts?”
“Help me get these clothes off.”
Steve walked over to the window to look at the river rushing by. “The roads are good,” he said, as he pondered his next move.
I hope you'll appreciate this new chapter :3
“What you need to do is throw a ball,” Natasha said as they lingered in the dining room with the last of the dessert and glasses of wine. The last of the day’s sunlight streamed through the open windows.
"Of course. You aged well, my dear; your looks are much more refined now." His mother gently puts the gifts near his plate as if to bring proof of his beauty and its effects on others. "It was just a matter of time before our friends and neighbours would notice it."
Tony soon proves to be extremely clever, pragmatic and sensible in learning how to attend to the estate’s economic affairs. He knows how to rule a house and its staff; people enjoy to gravitate around him in social gatherings. Gregory is popular as well but he’s much lazier and complacent in comparison; unlike Tony, he hardly takes any interest in the Stark industry and in learning how to deal with the economic issues he may face in the future. Even Edward, who had spoiled Gregory since he was a child, laments over his son’s careless nature, and how he wishes him to be more like his nephew. Therefore, his father and uncle tacitly agreed that the best option would be for Tony to marry a wealthy Alpha. It would bring him stability but also power to intervene if his cousin manages the family’s propriety in the worst possible ways.
“I see you have been extremely productive today, sir.” Jarvis nods in approval.
“Captain Rogers? I am sorry that I’m late,” Tony announced from the doorway.
Steve wandered into the dressing room to find Tony hard at work on something. “I’m making a signalling device,” Tony explained. He was dressed in a loose linen shift and rough pants, all samples of Steve’s barely adequate sewing.
Tony came in his human form, dressed in dark, somber clothes. “I wish we’d met under better circumstances, Mr. Rumlow,” Tony said, leveling the alpha with a confident stare. “The Captain and I have been discussing matters with your bankers and expected a more formal meeting. But Captain Rogers was excited to check our his new property.”
When Steve bought his estate, he expected to live a mostly solitary life. Despite his wealth, military service and reknown, and acknowledged attractiveness, Steve had no marriage prospects. He had long reconciled himself that he was destined to be the old bachelor with a home open to his friends and their families for holidays and summers and whenever his friends’ children wanted to visit Uncle Steve. He had the influence to introduce friends at court and launch them in their careers. Loneliness was his portion in life.
I hope you will enjoy this new page UwU/
She breathes through her nose slowly to calm herself.
Peter shook his head and MJ piped in. “If he was a king then I wouldn’t be in charge. I wanna be in charge.”
“Mr. Steve?”
Steve moved on at that point and so did the day. Before long, it was 3:30 and time for the students to get picked up. Steve was one of the staff on the schedule that day to make sure all the students got in the right cars or on the right busses and he loathed carpool duty. No one followed the rules exactly, parents stopped to chat with each other instead of driving in an orderly fashion…
“I mean, if you don’t want to speak about it, I won’t pry or-” Tony backpedals immediately, afraid he made another mistake to get on Steve's nerves.
“Huh. Hey! Where are the others? You saw them?” Tony asks hoarsely after an awkward pause.
-Shots of butts and come
Like the vivid brown eyes, Steve can’t get out of his head each time he goes to sleep.
An impulse induced by the danger Mr Rogers and Tony both endured when they were facing that Alpha? Did it spark some sort of temporary bonding between them, triggering their biologies in unsettling ways? It can be. Yet, Tony has no concrete proof to support that. For this hypothesis to be true, he would have to face danger again, in different settings, and in the company of different Omegas to be sure of this. It could be a really interesting experiment, but he fears it wouldn't be approved by society at large, which is quite unfortunate if people ask him.
“Mr Hammer,” Tony says, feeling sick just by mentioning his name.
“Right.” Tony side-eyed the plate again.
“My moms fight about who’s in charge,” Ned chimed in.
“The sunglasses hid those tears pretty well,” Steve smirked and hip checked Tony, who snorted.
Same warnings apply for this chapter, folks UwU/ It's still NSFW and this time, rimming is portrayed! So advert your eyes and close the tab if you don't want to look at it or if it makes you uncomfortable <3
The only thing that moved faster than Peter’s mouth was his brain, but he was also sweet as candy, kind to the other students, and helpful whenever it was asked of him. Peter was a sensitive kid, who tended to cry easily and whenever he was frustrated - which was also frequently. He got frustrated when things weren’t fair, when he was bored, when he was confused, and whenever someone picked on his best friend MJ for having ‘crazy hair’.
“Excuse me?” Rumlow said, flummoxed by the arrival of an alpha and the news he bore.
Steve rattled it off, skeptically, as Tony typed into his phone. “There, that should explain everything. Say goodbye to Mr. Rogers, Peter, we gotta get to Auntie Pep’s.”
“Petey Pie, love of my life, apple of my eye,” Tony said, making sure to keep his voice calm. “Why did you tell Mr. Steve?”
“Steve.”
Standing next to Steve, Sam leaned forward to see what Steve was jotting down on a separate piece of paper. “Where are we going to get half of these things? Clothes?”
“I caught those words,” Steve replied. “And I do, too.”
Tony Stark was an Alphahole. This was public knowledge. He’d been an Alphahole since he finished at Allensville when he was 13 - even before he presented as an alpha. This was…
“Mrs Woodward didn’t say your protector stayed at our place. With you.” His mother frowns.
When they arrive at their home, he can't help but wonder why he had been so naïve and ignorant for so long, why he had expected anything different, from the government, from the people. It brings the two young faces of the Omegas he used to know in the forefront of his mind. Were they forced apart from their respective families as well? Shunned away in some foreign country? In France, Spain or farther away? Was there any hope for them, for him?
“Relax, Stevie,” Bucky says with a swagger in his walk as he bends low to pour water from a pitcher in a porcelain basin on the floor Steve had previously brought. He takes one of the bar of soap on the dresser. “We just kissed and rutted against each other for a bit, that’s all. No clothes off. It’s not my fault if I can’t get rid of her scent.”
Now Tony didn’t understand human manners and dances all that well, but he did pick up that perhaps dancing each dance with Steve was not proper. But he couldn’t resist. Steve was gorgeous and easy to talk to as they waited to take their turns.
“What’s that?” Sam asked as Steve sat with Tony’s tiny list and a magnifying glass.
“Tony, your wings!” Steve said excitedly, sincerely glad that Tony had healed.
“You had to save the forest.”
“About what?” Natasha asked. She had settled in a upholstered chair near Tony’s table. Tony had expanded his work area across the console table that Steve had brought in when Tony complained about not having enough space to work. No doubt to sneak Tony snacks as the fairy worked on his building plans.
“Not the king?”
“Please.”
Steve wasn’t sure what alternate dimension he’d slipped into, but Tony Stark was an alpha. Everyone knew that. Plus, he smelled like one.
about it.
“Things Tony needs while he stays and recuperates.”
He fluffed up the napkins as best he could and lined the drawer. He laid the fairy in the linen nest, hoping he didn’t hurt the injured wing more. “He might have had a concussion.”
“The lot of you! Can’t you see he’s busy?” Angela hisses.
No, Steve was a man of great sense and practicality. Fairies couldn’t be the answer. He picked up the basket and blanket. He glanced back to his picnic spot, in case he caught sight of the fox. But left with the uneasy feeling of still being watched.
I’m red right now because your Daddy asked me about cock rings.
He had known at that moment what to do.
Peter dropped his voice to a stage whisper. “You’re my second favorite omega in the whole wide world.”
“Stevie,” James says, clearly disturbed by the conversation, the wavering tone of his voice betraying him. “You've got to be blind not to see how rotten it becomes, but not everything is so horrible. We have auditoriums to go to, gardens, some exhibitions you like to see, even friends! And jobs! Where else do you want to find one? There’s almost none in the countryside. They're all taken!”
“I understand you needed to be on your own for a while, after what happened to you. Perhaps, you were repulsed by having an Alpha around with your father coming back,” She pats his cheek. “But I thought...Oh. That’s silly of me, but I thought we would…I guess I just wanted to talk to you. To hear your voice. I was so scared for you.”
Sam clapped Steve on his shoulder. “Town is not a far ride -- I’ll rope in Bucky and we’ll be back by dinner. Will Tony be joining us?”
Steve moans in abandon when he imagines the beautiful Omega in his mind. His hands would be much softer than Bucky because he doesn’t have to work as hard as they do. It would be delightful to feel them on his skin, how they would be caressing every part they could reach. Steve hides his blushing face in the pillows so Bucky won't see his expression but stirs his buttocks up to convey how aroused and needy he feels. And so, Bucky delivers with deeper thrusts.
“We are?”
“He’s a fairy, Steve, maybe leave him here and he’ll get up and go,” Bucky suggested.
Steve suddenly felt lighter and smaller. Then Tony gathered him up in his arms. “This won’t hurt a bit, darling.” He murmured a few words and Steve was whisked away into a swirling cloud.
Steve had heard Peter talk about ‘Dummy’ a lot and assumed it was a pet of some kind. “Why would your dad bring your dog to a meeting?”
“Yes, it’s not. Tomorrow, I’ll take you with me to London. There is something you need to know.”
Tony sighs. He brushes his forehead against his mother’s while he untangles his arms to embrace her by the waist and lets his scent rushing on the outside of his body to assuage her sadness. His mother sniffs, she wipes a few tears away before they roll on her red cheeks and ruin her makeup. Tony closes his eyes to smell if she feels slightly better now. He startles when she cradles his face. Her scent is full of relief and tenderness. It mollifies his hard resolve to hide at all cost what he felt and thought of Mr Rogers since that fateful night. His mother would understand. She could help him.
“Steve --”
Steve followed up with, “What about using water power?”
Tony rises abruptly on his elbows. He runs his hands through his hair in annoyance, then covers his eyes, hoping it would chase away this uncomfortably arousing picture. Today, he promises himself he will stop going in circles, thinking again and again about this Omega, scrutinizing what he may or may not feel for him in a dozen different angles without any satisfying conclusion.
Steve beams gratefully at Angela, and she beams back at him. They work silently for a moment, sharing some shy smiles from time to time, but they’re disturbed by a couple of Omegas passing by behind them, chatting loudly, then interrupting themselves when they glance at Steve’s craft. Before he can say anything to stop them, he finds himself pressed against the table as they push his back forward to take a closer look, bumping into Angela at the same time. She throws a hard scowl in their direction.
“The fucking Omega Protection Law says that unbonded omegas can’t pass down property to their children unless that child is an alpha,” Steve growled.
Sex with Mr Stark wouldn’t be a rushed affair like it is at the moment; it wouldn’t feel like masturbating with a partner. No, they would both be languid about it, sharing sweet kisses after sweet kisses as if they have all the time in the world with no one who would dare to interrupt them. Mr Stark would coyly disrobe himself in front of him, his long eyelashes fluttering at Steve, shadowing him with his fuller, taller figure. Steve never saw him naked, of course, but thanks to an extensive staring from a while ago he guessed the shape of his strong limbs through his clothing, his slender waist leaving no room for imagination.
"The usual politeness but no proposition to invite him here. He's insufferable but we must concede he does have a point." His father’s steady gaze roams from his mother back to him. It feels like a long needle piercing through his skull.
Steve restrained himself from patting Tony’s head or rubbing his back reassuringly. Such a gesture would have been undignified and definitely untoward from an omega. Tony was still an alpha after all, even at such a tiny size.
Oh. That was not part of his day’s planning.
“Stop your nonsense!” Steve sputters, his cheeks all red. “He doesn’t need anyone else in his staff! It’s already full!”
“I’M BEING CAREFUL AND YOU’RE NOT EVEN WATCHING YOU’RE BEING GROSS.”
“Humans can’t use magic like fairies.”
~~~~~
And they both came together UwU There were sparkles everywhere <3 <3
Uno Game
It was sweet that they left food for him, but these humans were going to kill him if this is what they thought he ate. He’d have to fix that soon.
Steve stares angrily at the ceiling, his arms crossed behind his head. Bucky is late. They recently found a decent tavern in town, two weeks ago. They chose to rent a room there tonight for a good price, so they could release some tension and joyously mate in the best and most comfortable conditions. Thankfully it was on the borders of London, far from the slums, closer to the countryside with a clear river not too far away, so they can get water to clean themselves a bit after their frolicking. Steve feels extremely grateful he met Bucky when they were children, for he is the safest partner he could find around. In London, there are some houses lower classes Omegas and Alphas may use when they wish to mate privately, instead of doing it in some disgusting alleys, late at night, because they don’t have a place to live in. Bucky and Steve could have gone there since it’s free but it’s rampant with randy - on the borders of threatening - Alphas in a rut. There was a time Steve was frightened one of them would force his way into his room to assault him right after Bucky left to take a piss outside. Fortunately, he came back at the right moment to chase him away. He still has goosebumps when he thinks about it. He had only been seventeen. Steve loathes these houses so much.
Why yes, Steve was aware of the woman that Forbes had ranked as the country’s most powerful female alpha. Steve rolled his eyes as he said, “I’ve heard of her, yes.”
“Do you just wanna wait it out in here?”
“Right.”
Tony leaned forward and then caught himself. They were among people who could see them. He settled for lifting Steve’s hand and kissing his knuckles. “Thank you for a wonderful evening,” he said.
“Look at him,” Sam said.
“I hadn’t pegged you as a Navy man,” Tony said.
~~~~~
“Is Tony a real fairy name?”
“Antonio. Please, stay still. I don’t need anything.”
Then, she stays silent for a few but long minutes. Tony grips his breeches, his thigh jolting up and down. Why did she stop talking? Didn’t she have something to say to him? He’s feeling tense as the silence grows. No. That won’t do.
It has now been edited so it makes more sense chronogically speaking !
To make the matter worse, hygiene was very low. Well, it was low everywhere in the streets, but somehow, probably because of promiscuity, it was even worse there. Steve always felt it was an open field where diseases seemed to spread fast. He knows barely anything about medicine but if there is one thing he’s good at is making connections. He noticed his health was slightly better and more stable when he takes a regular washing. Bucky follows his example for he has faith in his practical judgement. Steve has enough health problems on his own, he doesn’t need his life to be more complicated because he wandered in the wrong kind of places. The small tavern’s room feels like a manor in comparison to where they used to sleep.
Sam sighed. “I should rescue him or else we’ll end up with another carriage.”
If you feel uncomfortable with reading it, please close the tab and open a new one.
Two days after the ball, Steve was still setting his house back to rights. Chairs and dinnerware to be returned to neighbors, linens packed up and stored, and food to be finished off. He had a full slate of business to attend to.
“Mr. Steve would like to be anywhere Tony and Peter are,” Steve confessed and the pinkies turned into full hands.
“I understand. Let’s see. If you work for another family in the countryside, but not too far away from London so I can keep an eye on you, you’d be happier?”
Rhodey had looked outside the window with an indecipherable expression. Tony had wondered what he may be thinking about, so he did the same thing as his friend. The view of the garden, its trees and walls, had ignited a spark in Tony's chest. There is a landscape behind those walls. There will always be something ahead of him.
It baffles him, in retrospect, how he had denied the reality of these harmless and fun experiences done behind closed doors. He mocked his friends for their credulousness, told them these stories may as well just be tales to dissuade curious or bored Omegas to try the same thing. This way, they won’t diverge from their predictive storylines which are: being attracted to an Alpha, eloping or bonding with an Alpha during a gorgeous ceremony, being cuckolded or unfaithful to their partner, and eventually, on rarer cases, falling in love with a Beta. Their romantic lives are so finely crafted that the peculiar narrative of Omegas supporting and loving each other is a ludicrous idea no one dares to speak about it. Tony himself cannot picture how it could be, though he can agree now that something sexual may spark between two Omegas.
“He’s an early prototype of the kind of robots that Daddy and Grandma Peggy think could help people who can’t move right by themselves. Auntie Pepper’s in a wheelchair, did you know that, Mr. Steve, and she sometimes can’t reach things on high shelves and so Daddy wants to make things for Auntie Pepper to go shopping better.”
“My mother,” Steve says incisively, immediately regretting how he sounded. He already feels tears coming to his eyes. She has just asked a simple question. He has no reason to feel so annoyed at her, he can’t expect her to know- “She’s the one who taught me. I - Sorry, I don’t wish to talk about it.”
-Butt fondling
The voice on the other end of the phone was pleasant, which Steve had not been expecting.

Steve is undisturbed by Tony’s presence coming closer and closer to him. The melody takes a completely different turn, changing the living-room's atmosphere. The rhythm is more intense now. Tony opens his mouth in wonder. He has never seen Steve with such an open and radiant expression before. The small blond is always frowning at him, sighing in exasperation when Tony tries to poke fun at him, cracks a joke or two. Tony had hoped he would succeed in charming Steve with his sass and bragging attitude, that he could get a reaction out of him, or simply light up his mood a bit when he had one of his bad days. It had been a complete failure so far.
He fetched some punch for Steve, as they decided to sit out the next dance. Natasha and Sam stood with them. “You can change into human form?” Sam asked.
“Let’s talk business, Rumlow. I want the mill. I have money and you need my money,” Tony flatly stated. He patted Steve’s arm. “If you return to the carriage, we can head home as soon as I am done here, Captain Rogers and Mr. Wilson.”
Tony flushes with pride at the mention of the king but he deflates rapidly. The king is too busy with that Jacobite rebellion to meet him and his father. This sounds like something his Majesty could have said in passing without any serious intent behind it. Besides, Tony sneers at the idea of being surrounded by the courtiers, who would listen to them, enraptured, but who would fail ultimately to understand or to challenge their ideas. As an Omega, he would just serve as a new form of entertainment. His father’s company takes most of the credit of the ships’ commissions anyway. His name doesn’t appear on any paper. He’s known only by reputation because noble Omegas are not supposed to work.
But Steve was already out the door and on his way. Work would be the best healing for him. And he didn’t want to poison his last sweet memories of Tony from the ball or from the other lovely times that they had together.
“Oh no Jarvis, it’s fine. But please, come in.” Tony invites him to a chair close to the wall with a motion of his hand.
Steve laughed. “So I’m not the only one not related to him who would basically die for him.”
Tony startled from his work. “It’s not like I’m not going to fly again, Steve. It’d be handier right now. But I couldn’t ask for a better lugger-around than you.”
Tony adds bitterly in his mind when he remembers two or three Alphas too forward in their advances, but he refrains himself to mention it so he won’t spoil his mother’s joy.
Steve said he would, and hung up the call. For the next several hours, he read every word of the NDAs - wondering for the first time what life must be like for Tony.
“I could say the same about you.” Steve chuckles. “I know you had lots of sexual experiments, so I was surprised you were so...weird about it. I only fucked with Brock that one time. I just needed some relief, but you've been looking at me as if I did something very horrible, and it just confuses me.”
“It’s okay. Mine died too.” She shrugs with a despondent smile. Steve raises his head abruptly. He guesses she must have recognized the reason behind his attitude by the sour smell of his grief. “I understand if you don’t want to share anything about her."
“I will check in with you before dinner. If you need me, ring the bell. I will be working on invitations in my study.”
Dinners with his friends had turned into planning for the ball. Steve and Natasha would be spending the rest of the day writing out invitations and Steve was not looking forward to it.
Now that spring was just blossoming, Steve was pleased to hear voices in the halls when he returned from his morning ride and the laughter in the drawing room in the evenings. Tonight he was spending a pleasant dinner with his friends gathered around his table, praising his food, furniture and house.
