cook, of course, and did occasionally when it was just him around the Tower.  But given the amount of ingredients laid out on the table, Tony looked to be making enough food for ten people.  That meant something was wrong.
Steve immediately backed off and Tony missed the warmth against his cheek and the calming caress against his thoughts.  He thought of walls, cold and steel reaching as high as the cavern ceiling.  Then he picked up his helmet and walked towards the gate.
"Yes, my friend.  Jane often listens to a song that advises to do just that, and its words would have guided me to fare far better in my past dalliances," Thor replied.
"I... don't sulk for two weeks," Steve said.  Rhodey didn't even grace that with an answer.  "And what do you mean about my drawings?"
Natasha and Thor burst through the door, followed closely by... Tony closed his eyes, hunching over.  He was still dreaming.  He had to be.
That startled a laugh out of him and he was able to set the photo down, though not out of sight.  With a trembling hand, he picked up the next article: "America's Fallen Son."  Tony wanted to laugh.  Whatever was actually going wrong with the universe, Steve was still dead.  He couldn't win.  He felt numb again, only feeling the prevailing ache that left a gaping hole where Steve should be.
That kicked the anger right out of him.  "I'm sorry to hear that," he said, feeling at a loss.  The rags talked about cheating all the time from what he'd seen, but not really about a break-up.  He wondered how they hushed that up.  And why.  "But I still don't think the favor Ms. Castillo owed you was for sex."
The former won out because he'd end up giving more away if he had to listen to the details.  "I'm fine," he repeated with a shrug.
.  And every time I've told you or one of the others, I fail again."  Tony's voice cracked on the last word, and he didn't look up.
Tony.  Steve didn't look up, because he wasn't sure his eyes were dry.  He also didn't trust his voice.  But Tony sounded rattled, so Steve nodded.
"You can put me down now," Viper said.  "You should return soon if you wish to get back before dark."
Steve remembered when Tony used to make him feel like that, all tongue-tied and shy.  To be young again...  He supposed it was only a matter of code, if Tony's transformation to a younger version of himself was anything to go by.  It was an odd feeling to know that age really was just a number.
He apparently shifted a little too much, because suddenly his hand was cold and he was staring at the hand print on Rhodey's face and trying not to laugh as the other man yawned.
Steve matched the expression, keeping his face very serious even as he fought off a smile.  "Trying to start again on the right foot.  Ya gotta better way to get to know a new friend?"
Tony actually managed to laugh at that.  He was shaking and the laugh made him feel more nauseated, and how horrible was he to laugh when Steve was dead?  But some of the wariness left Thor's eyes at the sound, so it couldn't be too bad of a thing.
"I...  Okay, that's...." Iron Man said, sounding both angry and distressed.  "Is it because of Mr. Stark?  You don't have to keep putting up with him, especially not if he's making you feel like that."
So much for sitting this one out.  Steve forced himself to his feet and threw his shield, stumbling as close to them as he could.  The shield bounced off the energy field Kang had, but Steve caught it on the rebound and threw himself into a close quarters attack.  Unfortunately he also bounced off the energy field and was thrown back again.  He groaned in pain, once again forcing himself up to one knee to see Iron Man still struggling to break the grip on his neck.
For a moment, Steve thought he was going to pull away.  Then Tony crumpled against him.  Steve could feel the small, shallow breaths against his neck as Tony's fingers curled into his shirt.  Steve was torn between anger and sympathy, the latter only winning out with whispered half-apologies against his chest as Tony trembled and gasped.  Steve held him tighter, helplessness replacing the anger.
It didn't help that she was looking at him like he was a particular breed of adorable puppy who had the flu.  "I understand you're looking for a meeting with Mr. Stark," she said, finally taking pity on him.
Steve immediately went to grab the first aid kit which they left in the kitchen (Clint was an enthusiastic - if not very careful - cook), searching for the antiseptic.  Tony
Steve laid down on the dais and Tony sat against him.  It didn't take long for them to fall into their usual positions with Steve's wing covering them and his head in Tony's lap.  Steve was still shivering lightly, but not too badly.
"Because I was a bully.  You were trying to stop the fight, but I kept pushing," Steve said, instead of admitting because it hurt Iron Man.  He felt the blood rush to his face at that.  It sounded stupid when he put it like that, but that was the core of it.  The staff had turned him into the thing he hated the most.
Steve stared at the plans, committing them to memory as much as he could.  "I'll leave the cookies here," he said awkwardly, leaving Tony to his work.
"Guess that's true," Rhodey said quietly, realizing he'd touched on something deeper.  "I heard you found out about Iron Man."
"Is Captain America honestly suggesting we make nice with a super villain?" Tony asked incredulously.
So he paced in the waiting room with his shield strapped to his back as his only comfort.  He couldn't...  Tony wasn't dead.  The fact that the nurses avoided him didn't faze him, but people walking quickly past and ignoring his questions did.  It left him more irritated, which he welcomed, because being angry didn't leave room for thinking about how Steve had never been able to find a pulse.  Tony had never gone cold like the dead did, but he hadn't moved.
"Are none of my concern," Viper said dismissively.  She shut the panel of the heart pump with a click, and under any other circumstances, Tony would have been amazed at the first person who looked at his chest without disgust.  Her scar was much more visible than a chest pump that could be covered. All she had to do was open it back up and pull, and Tony would be dead in a matter of seconds.  But she didn't.  He met her eyes and there was an understanding there he hadn't seen from anyone else who knew about the pump.  It made his skin crawl.
Steve looked like he'd been slapped, but Tony didn't back down.  Everything that happened in that underground city was Tony's fault and Steve was just going to forget all of that?  The War was still going on and Tony was here, taking advantage of someone who hadn't even been human for a week.  He was disgusted with himself.
Knowing he wasn't going to win that one, Tony picked up the conversation and reminded Steve of the other thing he had to put a stop to immediately.  "We'll return everything she steals, don't worry, Cap.  I've already made the mind control device that we'll plant on her when she turns good again."
Tony grunted in pain as his ass hit the floor.  He blinked up at the ceiling, Steve sprawled on top of him.  He could
"Like hell," Tony said, pushing away from Steve to get to his armor.  The repulsors should still work.  He could still fight.  He had to.
Tony had worked with metal all his life and never felt afraid of it.  Right now though, he was starting to understand Steve's distrust of it.
By late afternoon he found himself outside a large cave.  He had a quick lunch from what he'd stolen from the basket, then lit the moss lamp and started in.  The cave was dark and smooth, possibly too smooth to be natural.  It was big enough for dragons to enter comfortably three abreast and Tony could feel the sweat drying uncomfortably on his brow.  He wiped it away the best he could with his non-gauntleted sleeve.  There were no murals down here, and he could see why  the dragons didn't come here unless they had to.  It very quickly got bitterly cold, and he found himself wishing he had brought the armor just for the extra cover.
"Your walls are higher," Steve said, bending down as if to rub his cheek, but then stopping uncertainly.  "You do that when you're upset."
"Would be if you could point me in the direction of the ground since I don't think I'm brave enough to try dragon bathrooms," Tony replied as he bent down to pick up his guns and put on the holster.
Tony went still for a second, then tried to press forward, but Steve only licked lazily into Tony's mouth, mapping it with a thoroughness that could only be achieved through a slow and steady approach.  It took a moment, but Tony finally whined softly, stopping his fight to push it harder and faster.
Steve pulled away but caught hold of Tony's wrist.  "It's an order now.  You're zoning out too much."
He ducked out to grab a towel, then approached the mini-fabric war zone.  "What's going on here?" he asked, trying not to step on anything that looked important.  Or any pins.  Even with shoes, he frowned at the number of pins lying around.  It wasn't safe.
"You don't like when I spend money on you."  Tony knew that.  He did.  That's why he assumed Steve didn't like most of the things he did.
He told some of his adventures at dinner, as dragons valued stories and art.  It was interesting, retelling his own stories rather than letting Virgil or Pepper do it.  He was no wordsmith, but he could tell a tale well enough, and the dragons that joined them ("Dum-dum isn't really a name," Tony said as Peggy introduced him.  "It suits him," Peggy said as she went on to introduce Gabe.) seemed to enjoy the telling.
"I believe you should take that, Captain," the AI said, a hint of ice in his tone.  "And I would not recommend following through on the threat you were about to make."
Closing his eyes, Steve forced himself not to crumple up the paper no matter how much he wanted to.  He set his pencil down and focused on breathing.  He might as well hit the gym at this rate.  He was getting no-
"No one is becoming a super-villain," Steve said, making sure his voice carried as his hand went to Tony's shoulder.  While he had the greatest respect for T'Challa and his capabilities, he was also not saving Tony and Tony was
Tony didn't know how to respond to that.  Instead he leaned against Steve's flank to give the dragon what warmth he could.  He clutched the crystal against him, tracing Steve's star crest with his free hand.
Tony woke up feeling warm, which was definitely an improvement over his last wake-up call.  It was warm and the lights were muted, but not off, and when he managed to open his eyes, Pepper and Rhodey were both sitting at his bed side.  Pepper was on her tablet, frowning down at it with a frustrated expression and her feet in Rhodey's lap.  Rhodey had a book in hand and an exhausted look in his eyes as he absently rubbed Pepper's feet.
Mem: And there you have it.  It's not quite as polished as I would like it to be since I was running out of time, but hopefully it works well enough.  It's so loooooooooong.
how I heard it," Rhodey said with a laugh.  "And as awesome as it is to be called 'sir' by Captain America - and trust me, I was a big fan as a kid - Steve Rogers can get rid of the formalities.  Jim or Rhodey both work."
He looked up at Tony's offended noise, finding himself on the end of a glare that was dangerously close to a pout. "Steve, money is not a problem. You know that, right? I'm pretty sure I have programs and scholarships that help artists to afford this kind of thing somewhere. Pepper's big on art."
The shot surprised all of them, and the knife Kor'la'vin was holding fell to the floor, followed shortly by her body.  There was a bullet hole in the middle of her forehead.
"Alright," Leo said, barely above a whisper.  "I'll be down in the gym in a bit.  Just... give me some time."
Tony sighed, looking down at the table dejectedly.  "I'm going to have to rebuild it entirely tonight.  So much for normal sleep schedules."
She was surprised when his code popped up in front of her, and she looked up at him before touching it.  At his nod, she took a closer look.  She couldn't help the small laugh when she realized the code he unlocked for her was his fingernail colors.
Tony felt his chest go all warm and tingly at the Hulk’s admittance whilst his head sorted through shock, confusion and surprise before finally settling on acceptance. Acceptance that he too felt the same way about the Hulk. About Bruce. About Thor. About Natasha. About Clint.
“I could have told you that,” Bruce muttered darkly, his brain conjuring the unwanted memories of his drunk father’s lack of coordination when inebriated. Unfortunately though his father didn’t have any issues with coordination when laying a hand on someone else.
Unknown to Steve, Tony’s nose turned up as he remembered the overly sweet smell of Irene’s perfume. He had always hated that smell and Irene knew it, yet she continued to use it since it was a perfect way to reel in her targets. It was just another reminder of why things between them hadn’t worked out.
Steve could see the similarities between Holmes and Tony there with how both tried to confuse and lead people away from seeing how much a comment or action affected them. He wished that Tony didn’t feel the need to hide from people how much certain things hurt him on an emotional level, imaging times when he could just hold Tony in his arms as the mechanic laid his soul bare. Especially since his imagination was the closest he was ever going to get to the real thing now.
Steve smiled inwardly, proud that Tony wouldn’t compromise his values and morals for these men. No, Steve could tell that Tony was doing it for the girls murdered and the common people that were unfortunately put into harms way.
“At the fact that you admitted that you didn’t quite understand what he wanted. By what we’ve seen so far I would have assumed that you would have used that moment as an opportunity to preen.” Natasha made her point and watched as Tony rolled his neck slightly in agitation before sighing.
Steve closed his eyes at the barrage of noises, his mind finding it slightly overwhelming. Feeling a warm hand on his shoulder, he opened them and smiled at Tony to signal that he was okay. Tony made to move his hand away but Steve shook his head. Tony just shrugged and made no further move to remove the hand.
"How the hell did you survive a ship running over you?!” Clint demanded, trying to get his heart to slow down from all the commotion on the screen.
It wasn’t the first time that Tony had considered his condition to be a result of magic since he wasn't able to remember his first life so anything was possible. Although he had never really pursued that avenue as he had always been a man of science and up until a year ago had never seen magic exist. To have Thor who was essentially a magical being say that he could possibly find out Tony’s condition made Tony feel slightly conflicted. He wanted to know why he went through life like this and why he had never met anyone else like him but after not having answers for so long, the idea of knowing scared him. What if it turned out that he had done something to deserve this?
Blackwood's execution arrives but he has a few words for Holmes before he goes. Some concerns are raised within the team for different reasons and Clint really hates Blackwood.
“I would not have wished him a good trip Friend Tony,” Thor began as the time jerked in surprise before remembering that the Prince had the power of All Speak. “Although I have bad feelings about that man and urge you to make your get away as soon as possible.”
“You two are like an old married couple,” Clint teased to both Tony and Steve. He knew that it would rile Steve up to hear it but Clint was finding the whole thing too amusing to stop. It was clear to anyone that Tony and Watson were best friends, brothers really and that their relationship was one of friendship and nothing more. Tony laughed in response to Clint’s teasing whilst Steve glared at him. Clint only grinned in return and raised an eyebrow which caused Steve to turn around and ignore him.
“I thank Franklin for that one,” Tony recalled absently, his eyes slightly unfocused as he remembered something the team were not privy to. Natasha shared a concerned glance with the team and wondered how the film was taking a toll on Tony. They had no idea what the man was thinking as he watched this since he was capable of fooling everyone.
“Like there was any doubt that he was going to help,” commented Natasha, her tone laced with fondness at the sight of the two men. It was comforting to know that there was indeed someone Tony could rely on.
Thank you for all the comments and kudos, it really means a lot to know that people are enjoying this :)
“You need to get up Tony, all you need to do is get up and out the way,” Steve pleaded in desperation, missing the way that Tony looked at him with a soft, adoring expression.
“I personally do not find the smell of putrefaction pleasant and I’m finding it difficult to understand how you do Friend Tony.” Thor’s nose was wrinkled as he witnessed how easy Tony found it to breathe in the presence of such a stench.
Hulk lays it out simply for Tony and Holmes and Watson trade words at they wait out their prison stay.
Tony observed the change of expressions on Thor’s face, as they confirmed a hunch he had developed after the Battle of New York. The Battle has proven that magic existed due to the revelation of Asgard’s existence as well as all of Loki’s little shows. He hadn’t believed back then that the book had been capable of changing the course of history like the Order had as he had gone through Lord Rotheram’s records of the Order after the conclusion of the case. His findings had concluded that what had happened in the past had not been due to their rituals but had been a case of careful planning and scheming in the right places. Their belief that they had steered history was because they had whispered in the ears of the right people, not because of magic or their book.
Yet here he was standing in the middle of the communal floor with the other five Avengers in a loose semi-circle around him looking surprised.
She wouldn’t say anything about it yet though instead waiting for when Tony was ready to acknowledge it.
“Because back then Lord’s had a higher social standing than most and were therefore seen to be better than the common criminal. The fact that the murders were committed by him made the case a lot more intriguing although because he was a Lord most of the attention was on him afterward and not the women that he murdered.” Tony replied bitterly at the memory, feeling angry for the women who were forgotten, to be associated with a killer in the history books.
“She’s laying it on a bit thick isn’t she?” stated Natasha as she studied the woman who she assumed was trying to make a good impression.
The Avengers let out a collective gasp as it was confirmed that Blackwood was indeed no longer dead. Natasha noticed that the man in the coffin looked oddly familiar but she couldn't quite place where she had seen him before.
“I would say that you’re becoming childish and avoiding the subject at hand,” Steve noted, trying not to smile at the affronted look on Tony’s face.
“Good old protesters,” Clint commented in approval at the sight of the people who were shouting horrible things about Blackwood.
“What a coincidence,” drawled Thor, repeating the same words that Watson had earlier said but unlike Watson, he actually meant the words.
Natasha smiled at the Thunder God’s innocence at certain things. “That may be Thor but they couldn't afford the luxury of waiting for the men to face their fear on their own. They needed to know what was going on there and then.”
“Well Cap, that man looks like me because he is me. I’m Sherlock Holmes although I haven’t gone by that name in over a hundred years.”
Tony’s face became clouded with anger at the appearance of Irene’s boss, his lip curled in a snarl as he his fingers twitched with the need to wrap around someone's neck.
“Back then my observation skills were unparalleled. By noticing a few tiny details, I was able to calculate the odds of a situation and predict the most likely outcome.” Tony explains, not thinking anything extraordinary of it.
“Yeah, because that doesn’t sound shady at all,” Clint grumbled, wishing he could reach through the screen and punch the smug look off the two-faced politician.
True to Natasha’s observation, instead of the expected smashing, the Hulk carefully manoeuvred the wide-eyed genius onto his lap, keeping the genius within eye sight of the team.
Tony didn’t really sleep that night, it was rather tossing and turning, overthinking and then finally falling asleep for about an hour before a notification on his mobile woke him again. Groaning, he dragged himself out of bed. Now that he was awake, he might as well get up and get some work done. Sleep was for the weak, after all. When he made it to the kitchen, he stopped dead in his tracks. Of course Steve was awake already, how did Tony not consider this? For a second he thought about just going back to his room, Steve didn’t seem to have noticed him yet. But then again, they were roommates, they wouldn’t be able to avoid each other forever. And maybe, just maybe, Steve wasn’t even mad, maybe he hadn’t even noticed what almost happened yesterday.
“As I told you therapy is working and it’s true. I know you’re just caring, but I’m getting better. But I’m kinda worried about you.”
“Did you guys break it off?” She asked as if Tony didn’t even say anything. Looking at her bewildered, brows raised, he had actually no clue what she was talking about. Maybe he should have gone to sleep about 15 hours ago, but somehow he was sure, he still wouldn’t get what she was on about. So maybe it could have been worse than meeting Black Widow in the kitchen, but it definitely could have been better as well. And she definitely was in Black Widow mode right now.
The last thing he saw was Tony's eyes widening before he pulled him in for a hug. Holding him tight, he whispered, "I missed you, Tony. Of course I still want this. Want you."
They were watching yet another Disney movie. Everyone kept complaining whenever it was Clint’s turn, because he always picked Disney movies, but Steve knew that they secretly loved them just as much as he did. His favorite so far had been Beauty and the Beast and it was unlikely that any of his choices could change that, but Frozen wasn’t too bad thus far. Other than them being good movies, Steve took advantage of the circumstance that they didn’t need his full attention. Instead of concentrating on Anne, Kristof and Sven searching for Else, he repeatedly took a peak at Tony who was sitting next to him on the couch. Whenever his lips curled into a soft smile or he chuckled at something, Steve had to force himself to look away, the urge to lean over and just kiss Tony too strong. Which was the exact reason why he needed to talk to Tony, but made it even harder.
Tony watched him for a moment before he got rid of his own shoes and pants and crawled onto the bed and on top of Steve. He braced his elbows on either side of his head, leaning down for another kiss, opening Steve’s lips with his tongue. His tongue darted out, meeting Tony’s halfway, his hands moving up and down Tony’s back. They stayed like this for a few minutes, licking and nibbling at their lips until Tony broke the kiss, shifting back until he sat on Steve’s shins. He leaned forward and bit the skin just above the waistband of his boxers before he tugged at them. Steve lifted his hips, letting Tony pull them down to his knees. He was hard already and Tony enjoyed the sight for a moment, even though he was trying not to stare. He slowly licked along the length of Steve’s cock from base to top, causing Steve to pant for air. Tony watched him. “Want me to go slow?”
“I could’ve even flown us here.. which would have actually been kinda cool. But the point is, you don’t just walk to events like this, Cap.”
“Well that’s not news. If that would be all?” He tried his best to sound conciliatory, because he felt guilty for being rude. No matter how hard it was when she got your head straight, she only ever wanted the best for everyone. She certainly didn’t deserve to be yelled at.
He had wanted nothing more than to stay in bed, put his arm around Tony, hold him tight and never leave. Or maybe if he would have to leave eventually, it was something he would want to come back to. Fall asleep with him in his arms, wake up to the sight of Tony still sleeping peacefully, stroke his hair that would be still messy from the night, place a kiss right there and reluctantly leave for his morning run. When he would come back, he’d prepare coffee he’d place at Tony’s nightstand before slipping back under the covers to cuddle some more.
Narrowing his eyes, Steve tried to follow, until he finally realized what he was talking about. "It's not about that. I didn't mind what you said the other day. I knew you didn't mean it. It's okay."
Without so much as looking at the couch, Steve made his way to the bedroom. Kneeling on the bed, he tried to gently place Tony down, but he didn’t even think about loosening the grip around Steve’s neck and waist. Instead, when he laid on the bed, he tugged until Steve was pressed on top of him, which earned him a soft chuckle. As he slid his hands into Steve’s hair, he reached up to bring their lips together. They took their time exchanging soft kisses, exploring their mouths while their hands scouted their bodys. Steve’s skin was warm against Tony’s fingers that tried to reach as much of it as possible without breaking the kiss. However, Steve had different plans when he let go of Tony’s lips in order to place kisses to his jaw and neck once again. He gently nibbled at Tony’s collarbone, before he continued to touch his lips to as much of the skin beneath him as possible. Moaning softly at the treatment, Tony’s hand kept tracing Steve’s back while the other loosely gripped his hair. This time however Steve didn’t stop at his chest, but continued his way over Tony’s abdomen until he licked circles around his bellybutton. When Steve crawled back a little, he gently bit Tony’s hipbone before kissing down his left thigh to his knee until he kissed his way up the right one. Tony’s eyes were closed, enjoying the sensation of Steve’s mouth on every inch of his body.
This time there was no hesitation.  The wall started to move, uncovering a row of Iron Man armors behind glass displays. Steve recognized a few of them, including the one he had fought along side of for the Battle of New York.  It had been restored to a better condition, no longer banged up and dented and now with a full paint job.  He walked over to it, fingers tracing along the words Mark VIII.
Forcing himself not to interrupt, Steve set down the tray and watched Tony step back from the camera Dummy was holding, motioning for it to turn on.
It wasn't the worst way to wake up, Tony reflected.  In fact, it was rather pleasant.  Carefully, he started to pet Steve's head.  Steve didn't wake, but there was a low grumbling sound that wasn't unlike a purr.
Leo laughed, finally losing the bitterness that clung to him since he'd been rescued.  His breath hitched, but he smiled at her.  "Still a crybaby," he said, gripping her hand tighter.
Hospitals were terrible places.  The inoffensively painted walls and the pastel green of the chair made for a terrible work environment.  Add to the fact that nurses, doctors, and patients alike had a tendency to stop and stare at celebrities who randomly sat outside a hospital room, it was amazing Tony could concentrate at all.  But he plugged in his earphones and blocked out anything but Steve's monitors with hard rock as he meticulously went line by line through JARVIS's code.
"Sorry," Steve said, rubbing Tony's shoulders.  "Didn't really think you guys would actually be that interested in my art."
"'I'm shipping out tomorrow' usually means faster relationships," Steve replied, though Tony had a point.  Steve
Iron Man went completely still, and Steve's heart fell.  "I can't feel that, ya know," he said, a hesitance to the mechanized voice that Steve didn't hear very often.
"I am Viper, leader of the Serpent Society," she answered.  "And you walked right into my trap, Tony Stark."
Tony looked out over Steve's wing at the dragon crystals that hung over the buildings.  They lit up the houses below, but the city itself was quiet.  Too quiet.  There were always songs and music till late at night with the dragons flying to and fro over head to visit.  Most times Tony was lulled to sleep by the soft hum of the city.
"Jealousy," Tony said.  Naming the emotion really didn't help his mood.  "Don't dragons feel it too?"
Loyalty was one of the reasons he loved Iron Man, Steve reminded himself firmly as he watched Iron Man gesture animatedly.  He forced a smile on his face, even as the ache grew.  He couldn't fault Shellhead for that, not when he valued that trait so highly.
Tony dried the tears that hadn't quite spilled from her eyes.  "You are to us.  Now come on, kiddo.  Take a shower and I'll make some of this 26th century travesty they call food into lasagna for dinner.  You'll feel better with food."
The microwave beeped and he pulled out the muffins, sliding one over to Tony.  "So what do you like to do in your free time?" Steve asked.
"You're white as a sheet," Pepper said, touching his forehead to check his temperature before running a hand through his hair.  "What's wrong?"
"What are you saying?" Leon asked, bitterness returning.  "It's okay to stop fighting?  I can just give up and everything's fine?"
Steve's hands twitched at his sides as his earlier anger found new release.  "I'm not spying for you to find out who Iron Man is."
She automatically raised the spoon to her lips, the taste of strawberry soothing something she couldn't quite name in her chest.
He fisted his hands.  "Right," Tony said, trying to detangle himself from Steve's limbs.  "I'll go-"
at least rendered Tony off guard, and it took him a minute to regroup.  "We need to work on your deflection skills, Cap, cause that's the definition of sucky.  You-"
Steve's face lit up in a smile Tony had seen once before in the old news reels, but never in this time.  It looked right out of that old video they played in the museums, but
"Monica Chang is the second in command of security.  She works with Maria," Tony babbled, gesturing absently with his free hand.
Fear settled between them and Tony couldn't tell if it was him or Steve.  He fought for breath against the pain, words lost to the empty rasps echoing through the cavern.
He didn't stay for the stories that night, heading to the roof automatically.  It wasn't until he realized how cold it was without the moss's light that he remembered he needed to make a shelter on the ground.
There was none he could give her, unfortunately.  But there was something he could do, and Steve was going to be very,
Tony laughed, shaking his head and turning away.  "Yeah, and I'm sure you'll be happy not to use that time machine you've found too."
Except Kor'la'vin wasn't there and she overshot the train, banking hard to pull up as Kor'la'vin laughed.  Susan shot a repulsor only to have Kor'la'vin disappear again.  Susan swore, hearing a low whistle from Tony as she did.
Steve made up his mind.  He pulled a startled Tony into a tight hug from behind, his arms wrapping firmly around Tony's waist.
Iron Man waved him off.  He was almost pressed against the bushes, cutting off as much of the view of himself as he could.  "Necessary if I want to eat at all.  I don't mind.  I've got the suit on alert in case anyone gets close."
Steve groaned inwardly as he caught his shield and sliced it through another robot.  He wasn't going to live that one down any time soon.
Brown eyes widened fractionally as they met Steve's, lost and broken in ways that terrified him.  There was an open pain to them that Tony had been hiding, raw and empty in a way that spoke of grief and loss.
He woke up coughing wetly, gentle claws tilting his head so that the liquid in his lungs came out on the ground.  He heaved once, then spit the rest of the blood out.
Steve raised his head to rub Tony's cheek.  "We'll change it.  You'll find away.  You're the genius, right?"
"No problem, Cap."  His voice didn't break, but it was a near thing, and he couldn't help the disappointment when Steve pulled away.
"Ms.Potts," he said pleasantly, carrying a large box of parts out of the hanger.  "I'm on forced vacation from the military, but that doesn't mean there's not more work to do back home."
Steve only made things worse when he tried to scramble off Tony.  "Damn it, sorry.  Balancing without my tail is - Ouf!"
Tony hesitated, then lowered the mental wall he constructed, just a little.  He didn't know if Steve was listening, but he pictured the stars as well as he could.  The North Star, ursa minor, Orion, Andromeda, and Draco, just for kicks.  He pictured them on a clear night in Lucerne from before the War.  Rhodey and Virgil fixing a meal while Giulietta curled against his side on the terrace as he told her about the constellations.  He should take Pepper there when the War ended.  She wouldn't be impressed, but she deserved to be pampered a little after all the grief he'd put her through.  When the War ended...
Right now though she didn’t seem to care about either Tony or Steve, probably trying not to give away that they had just talked about them. But Tony’s sometimes too fast brain was already done making plans: if they wanted rumors they would get rumors. Not that it would be a smart choice considering his kind-of-crush, but he would let Steve in on it and if he was game it maybe was a chance to at least pretend there was something between the two of them. It was a bit selfish and usually Tony couldn’t care less about being egoistic, but then again this was Steve. He still didn’t want to miss the chance to at least have fake something, anything, with him.
“No wait. Hear me out. I’m sorry, I didn’t notice anything, but I should have. This whole.. thing we had was probably pretty hard for you. And this might be a new low even for me, not noticing one of my best friends falling for me,
“Her name is Shannon,” Steve started with a sigh, but was immediately interrupted by Tony, “so you already went on a date with her? Why didn’t you tell me? I’m disappointed.”
Anyway, they didn’t even fight since they made it to the farm. Up until this afternoon at least. When Tony had joined Steve chopping wood, it took only a few minutes until they started arguing. He didn’t even really know how it started. He might have been a little distracted, subtly staring at Tony and how his muscles were showing each time he swung the ax. And maybe he briefly thought about how his muscles would move during.. other activities. Who wouldn’t, right?
But seeing Steve leave had been the last thing he wanted nevertheless. Sometimes he really hated himself for the way he treated his boyfriend and he wondered how long it would take until he ruined their relationship enough that he wouldn’t even be able to call him just that anymore.
“For you it might just be fun..,” Steve paused and sighed before he continued, “but I’d say the others took the bait like ten minutes after we started this. I’m sure that at this point they’re convinced we’re.. together. There’s no need to keep this up.”
There had been no awkward silence, they had seemed to get along right from the start, Lincoln was polite and funny and smart. But still, now half an hour into the date, Steve wondered why he didn’t think of this seemingly perfect man as perfect.
Tony had only wanted to have company. But not just anyone, he had wanted to have Steve there. They had spent so much time together the last few months and Tony was used to having him around. He would also distract Tony from how much he hated those events and he would distract everyone from Tony, because he was Captain fucking America. Additionally he would be smoking hot in a suit. Which would cause the biggest distraction, at least for Tony. He had seen him dressed up a few years back when they hadn’t really gotten along yet, but that hadn’t changed the way Tony tried to get a good look at Steve whenever possible. Only because you didn’t agree with everything, or maybe even anything, someone says didn’t mean you can’t find that person attractive. And that was exactly the problem, Tony did find Steve attractive. That time he had worn the suit, when he wore his uniform, when he wore sweatpants, always. And thinking back at just how amazing he had looked in his smoking, Tony didn’t think he would be able to take his eyes off of him even for a second tonight. Only this time he wouldn’t admire him from afar, this time Steve would be at his side for the whole night. He didn’t know anyone at the gala and he sure as hell wasn’t going to slumming. How would Tony manage to survive the night without letting on that he had a crush on Steve?
“Tony, please don’t. This is not your fault, I just need some time. Besides, I wasn’t lying, I meant when I said I’ll be back. Probably sooner rather than later.”
Of course Steve was already there when Tony arrived, even though he tried to be on time for once. Steve was trying to take cover under a small ledge, but didn’t seem very successful since he had to share the space with outdoor furniture of the restaurant next to Puzzles. When he spotted Tony he took a step forward, but then halted again, waiting for him.
“No, I.. Why would I?” Steve’s cheeks heated and he finally pushed himself off the tree, trying to bring a bit of distance between it and himself.
“Aww, you’re such a charmer,” Tony sneered because, well, even if it was kind of true, Tony just wasn’t good at accepting compliments, never had been, especially not from Steve. Thankfully, he knew the procedure and didn’t argue.
After only a few seconds Tony felt Steve’s arm around his waist and his other hand on the back of his head, sliding into his hair. He even pulled Tony closer, as his lips gently moved against Tony’s.
He smoothed his hands over the collar he was still holding. “I’m not sure if you’d believe my words, we both know I don’t have the best reputation. But I’d be glad to show you that this is not a one-time thing for me.”
Wise decision not to leave the room when Nat, who always slept with one eye open and Clint, who probably would kill everyone as much as looking at his family, were next door. Even though Steve had to admit that a nightcap or a little snack did sound good. Not that Scotch would help him in any way, but having a distraction, even if it was just a small one, sometimes helped him stop thinking. But for obvious reasons there was only one option.
When they parted they stared at each other, catching their breaths, trying to process what just happened.
Technically Tony shouldn’t even wonder that she knew, it was kind of in her job description, but then again it had happened only a few times and he didn’t think anyone would pay enough attention to notice. Or did Steve.. unlikely. Tony just couldn’t imagine Steve casually telling Natasha about them fucking.
“I’m sorry, Tony. I really am. But you know I gotta do this. I couldn’t forgive myself, if..,” Steve trailed off. He didn’t even want to think about it.
The first thing Steve had noticed about him was his height. Which wasn’t surprising since he was probably about four inch taller than Steve and he wouldn’t consider himself small.
Once he was home and slightly drenched, because of course it had started to rain as soon as he left the restaurant, Tony stood in the middle of the living room, wondering what he was going to do. He had rushed back home because he knew he had to do
When he entered the café, Steve instantly jumped out of his chair. He had been sitting as far away from Tiffany as possible and seemed to have counted the seconds to Tony’s arrival.
It was the first time they really shared a lingering, chaste kiss without any kind of urgency or intention to take it further. It was soft and sweet and in a way it was their first
Tony sighed. Assuming she was right, because honestly you don’t just doubt Natasha, there was still this other thing she said. What, assuming she was right again, would mean that Tony also had feelings for Steve. Which, honestly, wouldn’t even be far-fetched, because have you met this guy? He was gorgeous, seriously. Not only because of his abs or America’s Ass (even though Tony would argue that his own butt was a very close second if not the real winner), but his deep, blue eyes that were so damn expressive among many other things. On top of that he was just the kindest, most thoughtful person with a great sense of humor. And he was able to keep up with Tony through banter, sarcasm and whatnot. Which was kind of impressive. They were friends, of course he liked him. He liked having him around and missed him whenever he wasn’t. He liked talking to him as much as sitting in comfortable silence. He liked shooting the shit with him and laugh about stupid stuff. And apparently he also liked to kiss him and sleep with him.
Steve grinned at him and started talking when he was still a few meters away. “So, there's a lot of barriers and a sign saying Central Park is closed today. You don't happen to know anything about that, do you?”
Knowing that she wouldn't receive any more bickering from the two men in the kitchen, Tony watched as Natasha went back to her breakfast. The last time that Tony had sparred with Nat resulted in him being unable to walk properly for three days for reasons which he would never divulge to anyone.
Natasha took the armchair on Tony’s left with the only free space left in the room being on the couch with Tony. Glaring at Natasha who only smiled innocently in response, Tony watched at Steve took his place next to him, leaving barely any space between the two men since Steve wasn't a small guy by any means.
“Wait so you guys are fully on-board the whole Tony’s lived hundreds of past lives train?” Tony interjected wanting to make sure that they really understood what he was saying.
“What?” Natasha snapped, not impressed with their staring. Thor worked up the courage to ask the question on everyone’s minds.
“I, uh, oh what the hell, I’m just going to say it.” Tony turned to Steve, briefly catching the super soldier’s eyes before dropping his gaze. “Steve, I’ve loved you since that day when you came up to me and apologised about the things said on the Heli-carrier, even though neither of us were at fault. The way that you scuffed your feet on the floor as you stumbled through the apology and the way that you smiled at me after and I invited you to hang out in the lab. The way that you treat the bots as though they are my children and the way that you accept my flaws as part of me such as workshop binges and the way that you take me around New York to try new food places and how you light up in awe of the world around you. I love you Steve.”
Tony felt his heart freeze at those words even as he fought to keep a smile on his face. It would do no good for the team to see how much those five words hurt him. “It’s not a crush,’ growled Steve, although his still blushing cheeks and avoidance of anyone’s eyes caused no one to believe him.
"Never asked where they get the large ones to be honest.  They're not the same as the ones on the cavern's ceiling," Tony said, thinking back to the crystals and the gravitational devices that kept them aloft.  He never did have the proper time to study them, but they gave off a pale light at night that reminded Tony of the moon reflected on a lake.  They were comforting.  "Those keep the monsters at bay?"
Dread started to take over the pit in his stomach.  Steve forced down the protein bar and prepared for either a dressing-down or an argument that Tony would likely hear about.  And Tony...
"The others are from all over," Steve said, looking away as he fidgeted. "But we're still fighting together.  Except for Wanda.  She... she comes and goes when she's needed.  She still has some strong powers, but it's personal for her.  She won't say anything, but I think she has family in one of those concentration camps I saw in your memories.  Or had."
with the butterfly, lacking any of his normal polish around women.  Steve was completely and utterly charmed, even if the butterfly wasn't.  He stood there, not wanting to interrupt the moment.
"Well, are you going to walk?" Sharon asked proudly.  Peggy wrapped her tail around Sharon's, beaming at her sister.
"To guard your sorrow and happiness so well that only a few may know it...  I can't claim to understand it, nor do I think I could live like that.  Why do it?" Wanda asked.
"Kestrel refused to change the code without a switch to revert back," Steve said, rocking them softly.  Tony only just kept the hope at Steve's words from turning around to face him.  "I'm still angry with you, ya know."
He should have known that a fella like Iron Man would be out of his league.  Steve didn't even belong in this century, after all, and Iron Man was a man of the future.  It wasn't easy, like it'd been falling in love with Peggy.
"You okay, Steve?" Iron Man asked, coming around the desk to put a hand on Steve's shoulder.  It was comforting, but Steve didn't know if he deserved it.
Tony nodded, unhooking the helmet from his side.  With one more small smile for Steve, he put it on.
"Tony, you have to dismantle it now!" Steve said, not letting himself be moved when Tony's face fell.
He just needed to know where to start.  Though JARVIS was indefinitely helpful to Steve as he adjusted to the new century, he doubted the AI would be inclined to setting up a meeting if Stark was set against it.
"Intervention?" Steve asked, trying to think if the others had complained about his sulking lately.  But Tony had managed two lunches this week and a movie to try to distract him from Bucky and Sam, so he didn't think it was that.
he in love with Tony?  The idea seemed preposterous, but the more he thought about it, the more Steve started accidentally drawing Tony's eyes.
Tony nodded, slipping past the gate to where he had stored his armor as he used the moss lamp the dragons gave him to see.  It was closer to where he'd been working to get free.  Not so near that it could be crushed should something happen while he was away, but close enough he didn't have to go very far once he put the suit on, and after the last time he'd just taken to getting out of it before he went to lunch, contortions be damned.
Fury barked a laugh, shaking his head.  "I forget you're from the Depression era.  You drive a hard bargain," he said.  "I don't want this one online."
"Careful, Miss," the second voice said.  "We don't want to bring the rocks down on top of the boss."
"What?  Oh!" Pepper said, reaching up to grab the face plate.  It didn't come down.  "I'm still not used to all of this... JARVIS, could you-?"  The face plate slid down easily, and Steve was a little unnerved without the visual evidence that it was Pepper in the suit.  "Thank you, JARVIS.  Tony says it's easy when you're not thinking and it worked fine earlier, but now it's-"
Steve went quiet after that, and Tony struggled to stay conscious on his own.  A clap of thunder helped, sending a spike of adrenaline through his system. If it was Thor, he wished the Asgardian would make it a bit warmer instead of bringing thunder and lightning.
His eyebrows went up, and Stark nodded, before seemingly remembering he wasn't on video call.  "Okay, I'll give you that.  Seriously though, you okay?"
They landed in the far north of the great cavern on a secluded ledge that lead to a small hall.  "What is this place?" he asked as they stepped inside.  This cave was warm, almost too warm for his liking.
Steve was chilled, thinking of the Battle of New York.  Tony was Iron Man, and without Iron Man, the city would have been destroyed by the WSC.  Trust Tony to figure out how to do that instead of how to survive.
"Course ya are, Sheriff," Stark said, leading them away from the crowd.  Steve didn't pay much attention to where they went, but he recognized the Stark Enterprise shop even from the back entrance.  He'd dragged a drunken Tony to it often enough, not that the man had much dignity to be spared by going in the front.  It was a bit of a shock to be on the other end of the leading this time.
"Unless you're suddenly an expert on highly advanced robots that even Mr. Stark is having trouble with, then yes.  You want to be petty and jealous, fine, but I'm going with his orders at the moment.  Bye," Iron Man said, clicking off the com audibly.
"Because Fury is refusing to do anything, citing international incidents.  He also said that if I got on a plane, it would be shot down.  And he's blocking my passport for commercial flights," Steve said, continuing his assault on the bag.  He jabbed and followed through with a vicious uppercut that sent the bag to a sixty degree angle Iron Man had to avoid.
"Yup.  Even Reed won't find fault in it.  Don't worry, I've taken out the parts that will make it work, but Sue's promised to release a statement on Reed's behalf saying the control was absolute and none of it was Jan's fault," Tony said casually, as if he hadn't just admitted to creating a fully functional mind control device.  "They'll be begging for movie rights."
He realized his mistake the moment he walked out and heard a loud roar.  He didn't even have a chance to fire this time, finding himself being pinned to the ground with a giant claw being pressed against the thin metal next to his throat.  "Where is Tony Stark?" Steve demanded, his voice sounding farther away than he was.  Tony was surprised to hear more worry than suspicion in Steve's mental voice.
Steve huffed, feeling warmed by the words.  He might be the one who potentially destroys the world, but if Iron Man said he had a place by his side, then Steve was willing to work for it.
"Hey, Cap.  Escaping the party already?"  Tony leaned over, critically taking one of the irises between his fingers as if he were looking for imperfections and not hiding his embarrassment.
Steve felt Tony push him down and he went with it, rolling to break their fall and keeping Tony on top of him to save him from the worst of the gravel.  He hit the ground hard as a flash of electricity nearly blinded him and he blanked out for a moment when his head hit.
He took off the helmet, resisting the urge to run a hand through his messy hair.  The gauntlets only made it worse and he had it on good authority disheveled was a good look on him.  "I do try to be, Miss, but humanity has gone down hill in recent years.  And yourself?"
"You'll figure something out," Steve said, giving one particular knot an extra bit of attention.  Tony groaned, leaning back to get more of the touch.
"Yeah, good luck with that," Clint said, not looking up from his phone.  He was texting someone, but the name was only listed as L and the phone was turned away from Steve before he could read more.  "If Natasha was kept away, he's one tough shell to crack.  But I'll talk to her and see what she can do.  She should still have an in with Potts."
Clint handed Steve his phone, and Steve recognized YouTube well enough.  He pressed play, watching the five women on screen laugh and sing.  It took a while to get to the actual song, but Steve found himself nodding with the beat once it did.
She narrowed her eyes, but nodded.  "Play nice, Mr. Stark.  I'll be in my office if you need anything."
Iron Man was kneeling beside him.  Steve realized the other gauntlet was under his knees, like Iron Man had been about to pick him up into a bridal carry.  The thought set his stomach fluttering.
After a brief message from Thor saying Jane was looking over the schematics, Steve went to the gym.  He blinked six hours later when JARVIS was politely suggesting he eat, wondering where the time had gone.
"We had two leads," Clint continued.  "And he got stuck on the false one.  Then he had to stick around and mop up over there, because the Hydra base there wasn't anything to sneeze at either.  But he should be back soon."
"Please don't take offense when I say this, Captain Rogers, but you're a terrible liar.  You don't have any of Tony's charm when it comes to deflecting things either," she said kindly.  "I'd appreciate the truth."
"It's rude to look at your phone while talking to someone," Steve replied as he punched in his unlock code.  Tony would only make fun of him more if he didn't.
He hadn't been planning on coming down to the workshop, certainly not without Tony in it, but it was a place where both Tony and Iron Man coexisted.  Tony made the armor in the workshop.  He might have only seen Tony down here, but he'd always assumed Iron Man also hung around.  He never realized how right he'd been.
Tony was probably trembling himself, but he didn't care.  Instead, he kissed every bit of Steve's neck and collar chastely to remind them both they weren't alone.  The lights were bright and the power was back on.  That was all that mattered.
"Could have slept with her before Pepper," Stark said appallingly.  Steve was almost blinded with anger as the man played his own devil's advocate
"So I do," Tony said, not denying what he'd said earlier.  He didn't believe in shame when his body could actually blush, and he wasn't about to bother now that it was too cold to do so.  Though admittedly, blushing would actually warm him up a little, so he wasn't as opposed to it as he usually was.  It wasn't like Steve didn't know anyway.
"Was specifically aimed to hurt me in every way you've learned since we met to get me to do what you asked me politely to do at the start of this," Steve said, despite how much that stung to admit.  Even when Tony wasn't hurling insults, he was still one of the most infuriating men Steve had ever met.  Bucky would have said they were meant for each other.
Steve froze.  Tony couldn't have guessed what he was down here for!  He hadn't spoken any of his plans aloud either, so JARVIS couldn't have reported it.  Steve flushed, wondering where he had gone wrong.  "I wasn't-"
Tony felt the fight drain out of him in the face of Steve's love, but the guilt remained.  Steve's arms tightened around him as Tony shook his head.  "I can't...  Steve, you're emotionally compromised right now.  You've only been human for a week."
He heard Tony shift around and sigh softly. Smiling to himself, Steve took a few deep breaths, before he heard some more rustling until Tony’s hand was gone. As much as he tried, Steve couldn't help but feel disappointed at the loss of contact. Not that it had meant anything. Steve had acted out of impulse and Tony had probably been too confused to pull back his hand.
After Tony showered and changed, Steve was waiting for him outside the gym. His expression was illegible and he wasn’t his usual smiley self, so Tony decided to be cautious and not say anything for now.
Since most of the Avengers lived in the same building, the next opportunity to spread more rumors arrived the next morning over breakfast. Steve was rather hesitant, which was to be expected. Tony on the other hand seemed to touch and watch Steve as much as possible. Every now and then he put his hand on Steve’s shoulder or arm just for the sake of touching him. He especially enjoyed that he was able to look at Steve as much as he wanted without having to police himself to not be too obvious. He didn’t go full-on, but he wouldn’t be surprised if he wore the heart-eyes Natasha had talked about.
“First of all her name is Lilian, thank you very much.” Steve looked at him pointedly and Tony had the decency to look apologetic at least. “Uuhm, sorry. Lilian, Laura.. I knew it was something with an L. But she
“You should do that. Come on, I’ll escort you to the elevator,” Steve offered with a little chuckle, making Tony laugh as well and made his way to the door.
Steve took a deep breath before answering, apparently he wasn’t as sure as Tony was. “Yeah, but you..”
“Tony,” Steve tried, but he knew he wouldn’t get any reaction the way Tony seemed to be almost in tears laughing, his body slightly bent forward, shaking with laughter.
Still trying to calm his breathing, he heard the sheets rustling until some kind of fabric landed on his stomach. “Might be your shirt. Don’t know, don’t care,” Tony told him before he stifled a yawn. Chuckling, Steve took the cloth and roughly cleaned himself before throwing it to the floor and pulled his underwear and then blanked back up.
“Tony? Are you alright?” Steve’s voice sounded alert, even though he slurred a little as if he’d been asleep. A glance at his tablet told Tony that it was two in the morning and maybe he should have felt guilty for calling Steve in the middle of the night, but he was still angry and wanted answers. So he didn’t beat around the bush, before he asked, “Did you mean it?”
In what? Did she really just say in love? As in Steve loved him? And did she just imply that Tony loved Steve as well?
But the other reason why he shouldn’t have done that was that now Tony knew what Steve’s ass felt like under his hand. And damn it was buff. Even before he tensed, probably in surprise, Tony could feel the defined muscles. If he hadn’t been surprised by his own action and therefore withdrawn his hand pretty fast, he probably would’ve never let go, because the feeling of touching Steve was just too good.
Letting his hand run over the bulge in Steve’s boxers, Tony hummed, "I see I'm not the only one affected by all that sex talk."
“Tiffany.. She’s..” Steve paused and seemed to retain himself from saying something impolite. “She’s very.. straight forward and hands on. She’s.. it’s horrible, Tony.”
After Steve got off the elevator on his floor and they said goodnight, he went straight into the shower, taking his time washing up and enjoying the warmth of the water in hopes of becoming tired.
“So you got nothing as well,” Steve teased and unfortunately he was right. That’s really not a question Tony had paid much mind to up until now. He wouldn’t admit that of course. Instead he did the only reasonable thing in this situation: he made a face and stuck his tongue out at Steve, who just laughed and shook his head at him. And because with Steve Tony didn’t even need to pretend to be an adult, he then pouted at Steve, making him laugh even more.
He didn’t think anyone had noticed his nocturnal visits to the communal area, but it somehow made sense since Tony often worked until early mornings or didn’t sleep at all. But Steve knew there was actually a question in his statement, so he suggested, "well.. I just can't seem to stop thinking."
“Not anymore. Not since you made me stop drinking, that is.” He wasn’t serious, he knew he could do whatever he wanted to do, he was a grown up after all. But most of the time he couldn’t help himself, he just loved teasing Steve.
He heard Steve laugh just as much as he felt it the way his upper body moved with the sound. “Of course I did, I’m Captain America!”
So he tried to avoid Tony next, but living in the same building wasn’t really helping. The more he wanted to not meet him, the more they bumped into each other as it seemed.
of the elevator that indicated that Steve had reached the penthouse. Unsure what to do Tony hurried over to the counter and leaned against it, hoping to appear nonchalant and not as anxious as he actually felt.
The only thing he was semi looking forward to was his lunch date with Natasha. He loved to spend time with her and maybe she could distract him from the clusterfuck that was his current situation, but then again, she was Steve’s best friend. So she would also be a constant reminder of him and she would probably want to know what had happened. Because Tony wasn’t sure if there was any chance she would have gotten an answer out of Steve regarding this topic.
“I’m sure, Tony.” She rolled her eyes. “You can’t even imagine how often I heard about it the past few days.”
He didn’t really know where this impuls had come from, but Steve had looked so miserable and he had the urge to stand up for him. Somehow he had thought it unfair that she had gotten the chance to go out with Steve of all people and all she had done was make him uncomfortable. He really deserved better.
Strolling into the communal kitchen he was relieved to find it empty, with the temporary failure of his work he
“You’re such a sap, you know that? Now get out of those pants and into the shower. I wanna get rid of all that sweat and dirt.”
Steve didn't need him to say more. "It's fine. I.. Like I said, I just wanted to be honest and all."
They both raised their hands in an attempt to get a hold of each other and drag the other one forward. With a laugh on their lips, their mouths finally met in a kiss.
When they broke apart, Steve planted kisses along Tony’s jaw until he reached his ear and stopped to nibble at his lobe. In a swift move, Steve turned them and crowded Tony between the wall and himself, before he kissed his jaw once more. When he reached the spot behind his ear, Tony moaned softly, causing Steve to fondly smile at him even though Tony couldn’t see because his eyes were closed, his head leaned back against the wall. Once Steve continued gently biting Tony’s neck, he raised his hands to loosely hug Steve, his fingers slowly tracing up and down his back.
Minutes after she had already left, Tony still stared in the direction where she just stood. When he finally snapped out of his trance, he shook his head in an attempt to clear his mind. What the hell? Did this really happen or was he maybe sleep deprived enough to have imagined the conversation? Nope, no way, he decided. No matter what state he was in, this was not something his brain could just make up, that much he knew. He groaned and grabbed his mug. Instead of sipping on it, he gulped down the already chilled beverage, hoping it would magically help him understand what was going on. Logically, Tony knew that not even coffee had
When their lips parted, they stayed completely still otherwise, enjoying the closeness, until Steve took Tony’s hand, pulling him with him. “C’mere.”
The mission wasn’t too demanding. Apparently a few Chitauri had somehow survived and were about to paint the town. Nothing indicated that there would be more of them or that they had caused any bigger problem. Not that the battlefield was a fitting location to talk about what had happened, but it didn’t stop Tony from trying to pull Steve aside. But of course they wouldn’t even be undisturbed during an ongoing battle against some alien species. Figured.
didn't want to talk to anyone right now. But of course he was out of luck when only shortly after him Natasha approached. But then again, she usually knew when not to talk to him, so it could've been worse, he guessed.
Three days after he had received the letter he already knew the words by heart, but still couldn’t stop reading them over and over. Like he still needed to find the hidden message. And even though he had read many things in between the lines, he wasn’t sure if they really were there or if he just wanted them to be.
He barely noticed how Tony’s eyes went a little wide before he turned around and walked inside. The sound of footsteps and the closing of the door told him that Tony was following him.
When they finally made it to Tony’s floor, he led Steve into the living room, gesturing to the couch, but Steve just stopped in the middle of the room, apparently waiting for Tony to close the door and catch up to him. When he did, they stood there awkwardly for a few moments, the elevator-situation all over again. Another moment that would be romantic in every damn movie. Standing opposite of your crush, not much space left, tension in the whole room. Unfortunately for Tony it was just tension, not
“I didn’t. And you didn’t,” Steve argued, darting a pointed look at him, but not without a small smirk.
Abruptly he got up, he needed to get out of there. “I’ll just.. go then,” he said a little breathless even though he tried really hard to sound casual. Without looking at Tony again he turned and made his way to the door.
Yes, he texted Steve to meet him in front of a bar at three in the afternoon. It was halfway between them and where they first met. And yes, he also texted him to ‘drop everything now’. So he was a little romantic and even more dramatic, sue him.
Steve rolled his eyes now that Tony was looking at him again, but his voice was soft when he said, “Tony, you should take a break.”
“Oh come on, Tony. He’s my best friend. I didn’t wanna say something, but he told me what happened, he’s miserable. He feels so bad about how uncomfortable he made you. Even though I didn’t even know that was possible,” she tried to joke, but all that Tony heard was how woeful Steve was and that it was Tony’s fault.
“Yeah, that’s what I sa..,” Steve was cut off when Tony took his face into his hands, pulled him down a little and just kissed him.
Tony stared at the phone, then looked up to watch Steve who wasn’t paying attention to him and then gazed back at the phone. Did he just imagine Natasha texting Steve advice on how to make a move at Tony? This was the only explanation, right? This couldn’t be real. He took another look at Steve. Could Steve Rogers really be interested in Tony? How? When? Why? Tony’s mind was racing. Could it really be possible that Steve had reciprocated his feelings all this time without them knowing that they were into each other? Could they really be that dense? Tony wouldn’t really put it past them, but he decided to try and do something about it. Maybe if he would be more outright tonight he would get a reaction out of Steve. If not he could always try to talk to him about it. Even though talking had never been Tony’s strong point and therefore was rather a stopgap.
“Capsicle, hey. Come on in. How’s it going? What brings you here?” Tony rambled. Well, that sounded suspiciously like sleep deprivation.
“Yeah, still.. That’s just so.. I don’t know.” By far, this wasn’t the first strange answer they had heard on that show, but it still confused, yet still amused, Tony to no end.
Actually leaving had been way harder than just thinking about it. The Avengers were his family and he had missed them as soon as he’d left the tower behind. But as tough as it was, it was what he needed right now. He stayed in an apartment in Brooklyn because where else would he go? It belonged to a man he once met in a vet support group before he became a good friend. Since he shared his time between New York and Detroit he had been happy to help out without even asking any questions.
This time there was a pause, filling the small space between them with silence. This was probably the moment they would decide to forget that they had ever talked about this. At least that’s what Steve thought until Tony started speaking, “so.. uhm.. Does the offer still stand?" Tony sounded sheepish, even though his voice was a little rough and the realization of what that meant sent a shiver down Steve’s spine. Clearing his throat and attempting to sound casual he said, "yeah.. okay. Sure."
“When hugging a tree, the hormones Serotonin and Dopamine make you feel happier. It also increases the level of Oxytocin,” Steve quoted what he once read about it as best as he could remember. “I don’t think I have to tell you that Oxytocin is responsible for feeling calm.”
Steve handed him his phone wordlessly. He really was too trusting. He didn’t even ask why Tony didn’t use his own. But he wasn’t complaining and just took it. He opened the messaging app just in time with a new message popping up. Tony didn’t want to read it. He really didn’t, but his eyes registered his name and there went his intention. The message was from Natasha and read ‘You know how Tony is. Just get him drunk and he’ll lie at your feet.’. Another one followed ‘Uhm, that came out wrong’ and then ‘Eeeew’ and ‘Anyway, just have fun’.
Two weeks and he already missed the team and even though he could barely admit it to himself let alone to anybody else, he missed Steve. Tony had even considered going back, because surely they would have welcomed him just like the family they were, but he couldn’t. He had yelled at them when his anger was actually directed at Steve, but he didn’t care right there right then. He had told them they wouldn’t get by without him, that he didn’t need them. Both of which were obvious lies. He had known right away after the words left his mouth, but he felt it even more when he was all alone back at the tower. He was lonely and miserable and not even Pepper could cheer him up. Not that she had much time to, she was a CEO and someone that had their life together after all.
“I should.. I need to.. go,” Steve stammered, while from the corner of his eye he saw that Tony was watching him lazily. He didn't wait for an answer before he left the bedroom, practically running for the elevator even though it was actually the last thing he wanted to do.
That was until Tony walked into the communal kitchen on day five or six. The world could’ve stopped and Steve wouldn’t have noticed because all he could see was Tony. The way his hair looked even messier than usual, his shoulders sagged and his eyes, his beautiful brown eyes seemed tired and.. kind of sad?
After Steve had paid and they had left the café Lincoln was the first to speak. “So, you want to do this again sometime?”
“No. You’re an idiot, because you really didn’t realise that you were right. Steve wants to be in a relationship.
The whole scenario kind of reminded Steve of his days in the Army. When you shared barracks with eleven other men or crouched in foxholes with your comrade pressed against you for hours, privacy was a very rare luxury. Since living like sardines in a tin wasn’t exactly new, it hadn’t taken long for Steve to get used to the confined spaces. What had been a little more awkward at first was finding out that nobody cared about the lack of privacy. Walking in on someone jerking off the first time, Steve had thought it was an accident, but it didn’t take long to realize that it was rather the opposite. In the shower, in the bed or foxhole next to you, wherever you looked it had felt like you always found someone getting off. No matter if they had too much time and therefore needed entertainment or if they were in the field and someone squeezed in a quick combat jack. Occasionally, and that had been the strangest for Steve, some soldiers even gave hand jobs to each other. To Steve it hadn’t been weird because he was opposed to the fact that it was to men in sexual contact, he didn’t mind one bit, he just wasn’t used to it. Being openly homosexual wasn’t something you wanted to be in the 40’s, but Steve never thought about it that way. In his mind liking men or women or both had never really been important, because what mattered was the person you liked, not their gender. Admittedly it was also about attraction and he definitely had been attracted to one man or another. Anyway after his initial astonishment he had to agree that sometimes, after being away from home too long, it was a welcome change to feel another hand on your dick than your own.
Pepper had been quiet, she probably knew that Tony needed a minute, but when she continued she spoke just as gentle as before. “Tony, you need to trust him. You know he wouldn’t hurt you. But you know how much he cares about his best friend and Bucky has been in a dark place. Steve is worried about him. He lost him once. What do you think would happen if he’d lose him again?”
“That’s true. Don’t tell me you never noticed how they gaze into each other's eyes for like hours whenever they’re in the same room.” Oh, so Banner was in on this, too.
“Oh, that’s a good one. Five bucks someone’s gonna say ‘penis’.” Steve burst out only seconds later.
“What was that about?” Steve leaned on the workbench next to the door, his eyes still on Tony, probably trying to figure out what was going on.
Of course he would know that there was more to it, he had been an open book to Bucky since they were kids. There was no need to try and hide anything from him.
“I just need.. some time. I’m feeling a little exhausted right now and want to take a step back. Recharge my batteries and come back stronger, so to speak.”
Steve snorted. "As if you didn't wait for me to enter the elevator for the past ten minutes. But still, hello JARVIS."
Closing his mask, Tony grabbed Steve by the waist and before anyone knew what was happening they hovered over the street. “Sorry, guys. We’re outta here,” Tony announced before he flew off, taking Steve with him.
“Mornin’,” Steve finally mumbled. “I’m going for a run, coffee’s ready.” With that he left the kitchen, faster than Tony’s whispered ‘thanks’ could even leave his mouth. And Tony just stood there, unable to move, repeating the most awkward encounter they had ever had in his mind over and over again. Until Steve apparently left the flat, the slam of the door rousing Tony from his trance-like state. Shaking his head in order to get rid of the thoughts he made his way over to the coffee maker. If he wanted to make it through the day, coffee was more than essential.
A mild squeeze on his shoulder suggested that Tony wanted him to sit down on the bed, so he sat down and after Tony swiftly got rid of Steve’s shirt, he instantly followed him. Straddling his lap, knees to both sides of Steve’s hip, he brought their lips together again. Tony slowly grazed his bottom lip with his tongue before gently pushing into his mouth just in time with shifting his weight forward. Steve obeyed the silent order and let himself fall back to the bed, taking Tony with him without breaking the kiss.
“No, he didn’t. But I know him well enough and to be honest, everyone with at least one eye can see that you two are in love.”
There was a roar in the distance, one Tony had heard in the vision.  The hydra!  He screamed as he felt teeth tearing into his wing -
"That doesn't surprise me," Tony said.  He'd seen how many reprimands Steve had in his folder and Tony was pretty sure Steve wasn't sorry for any of them.  Still, he'd like to talk to Wanda and the others when he got the chance.  He owed them a lot.  "I take it you've already seen the stars?"
Jarvis snorted, the awkwardness leaving now that he'd said his piece.  "You've never been subtle, Tony."
"You guys looking for me?" Steve asked as he put the weight back on the bar.  His arms burned at the motion, making Steve wonder if he'd lost track of time again.
While Steve was fairly adaptable and good at expecting the unexpected outcomes in battle, to say he was surprised to see Nick Fury leaning against the wall as he walked out was an understatement.  He nearly dropped the sandwiches, but he caught them just in time.  What was Fury doing at the Tower unannounced?  "Director Fury.  I thought the debriefing was tomorrow?"
Another flush crept up Steve's face.  "Peggy's never let me forget it.  It's a good thing you don't remember," Steve muttered.
"Sell?" Steve raised his head and tilted it to the side in a motion that was almost human.  "Oh, I see.  We don't really 'sell' anything here.  I draw because I like to make my friends happy."
He was drawing the Scarlet Pooch and Black Widowbird holding hands when he got the message. Steve went straight to the gym, taking out the punching bag and decimating it within five minutes.
try to push you away, especially since you knew Howard.  If you want that olive branch, Captain, you're going to have to be willing to hold it out for a long time."
He borrowed some clothes when he finished since his were somewhere on the quinjet and that probably needed an escort to get.  The airmen were very entertained by it all, but Steve figured there wasn't anything in the rules against wearing shirts from another military branch and he really didn't mind that much.  Thankfully he was only asked for a few photos, but he made a mental note to properly visit with the troops here before they left.  It was different now that he was more than just a propaganda piece, and while he wouldn't do another show, he could still do some good and raise morale.  And he could drag Tony along, because it'd do him some good to get out of that hospital room.
"She thinks embarrassing Rhodey about his childhood hero-worship will get him to wake up.  Either that or his jealousy for her meeting you first," Tony said, smiling into his cup.
He walked past the suit, going towards where he was working, ignoring the fact that Jarvis would have a fit if he knew Tony didn't even have a hard hat on.  He put a hand on one of the bigger rocks, looking up at what he still had left to clear.  The War was going on up there.  He wasn't fool enough to think the world depended on his contributions, but if he could make a difference...
Steve drew a quick picture of Vision and Wanda. Vision wasn't quite right, but Wanda had come out pretty well. He hadn't gotten the hang of coloring on the tablet yet, which might be what was off about Vision.
It finally opened up to a big cavern room that the moss lantern only barely lit.  Tony could see maybe five feet from the lantern, the rest of the cavern dark and unwelcoming.  He shivered despite the warmth.  "Wanda?" he asked, unsure of the path.  He didn't move closer to her, though he wanted to.  His last few memories of dark caves were not pleasant no matter how warm this one was, and he could feel Steve's discomfort as well.
"I should call Darcy again as well," Thor said thoughtfully.  He was smiling absently, with a glow in his eyes he only ever got when talking about Jane.  "Jane's enthusiasm also makes her forget the needs of her body."
"Ah, you mean your posts on Tumblr and DeviantArt," Vision said. "We have been following them with great amusement. Wanda particularly liked one of the profile picture you did of her using her powers."
It took Steve a moment to realize what Tony was referring to.  The anger hadn't really left, but it had simmered and dimmed, especially with the long flight.  But if Tony was actually apologizing for what he said...
“Well he tried to use the glow stick of destiny on me and then proceeded to throw me out of a window so I would the yay on the touching.” Tony replied.
Tony let Clint continue his rant knowing that the archer needed to vent his disbelief. This wasn't the first time that he had told somebody but it was definitely going better than the previous times.
Tony exited his bedroom and made his way to the elevator that would take him to the communal floor, JARVIS already having the door open without Tony’s prompting. He was just going to go down, show everyone that he was alive and steal some coffee. He wasn't in the mood for socialising today and just wanted to be left alone for a couple of hours with some heavy metal pounding down his ears.
At Natasha’s words Tony’s mouth snapped shut with an audible snap, a blush rising on his face as he watched Steve duck his head away shyly at the comment. The team knew about Tony’s feelings about Steve, he’d had to endure endless teasing from Clint about the playboy being unable to muster up the courage to ask Steve out. The only one who seemed to be unable to figure it out was the buff blond himself and Tony suspected that it was because he was from the 1940’s and therefore the idea of Tony liking Steve had never occurred to him. Alas another reason why Tony had to keep his feelings to himself.
“I believe you too, I mean I turn into a giant green rage monster so for me anything is possible. I would like to do some tests with you if that was okay, maybe another pair of eyes could prove useful.”
Tony started talking before any of the Avengers could ask since it didn’t take a genius to know what they wanted to know. “So, in conjunction with being able to notice the small details and predict outcomes, I’m also able to use said small details to conclude how they came about.”
Tony sighed. “She was clever, intelligent and beautiful which she wasn't afraid to use. She could have easily settled down and had a great life but instead she was a criminal. She would marry men and divorce them for riches or to gain information.”
Cheeks blushing in slight mortification at being put to bed like a child by his crush, he mumbled out a no whilst shuffling to the bathroom. He would have honestly thought that after a year of living with the man that he would have been able to shake off the attraction that he felt towards the super soldier. Instead the attraction had grown into something more, something which Tony didn’t want to put a name too because he knew that his feelings wouldn’t be reciprocated.
Natasha tilted her head in contemplation. There was something different about this fight. There was no planning of the moves ahead as they had previously seen.
Steve’s comment jolted a snort from Tony, who instead of explaining his reaction just gestured back to the screen.
I know that some people will not be happy to hear about this extended hiatus but please bear in mind that I am a human being who is currently grieving for someone who was very special and was taken too soon.
Tony sagged in relief, not knowing why he had ever doubted that his friends would accept for who he was. He also felt as though a weight had been lifted off his chest, not quite realising until that moment how keeping a part of him secret had damaged him.
“I watch it as the big guy likes the colours and costumes and to no one’s surprise, he really likes the costumes that are green like him,” Bruce stated with a wry smile and feigned exasperation.
“Actually, JARVIS does a lot in a battle, I’d wager that he does more than I do. Wouldn't you agree buddy?”
“Let it be known that the best fish and chips will always be in England,” Tony pointed out, his stomach giving a slight rumble at the thought of battered fish. Maybe once the film was finished he could take a quick trip to London to satisfy his cravings.
Natasha thought back on what history she could recall of the top of her head. “Any criminals that we would know of?”
“Mainly the direction of the scuffs and the amount of imprints in the area,” answers Tony, remembering feeling impressed that Watson had been the one to point out the fault. “Also there were several shoe prints in the area that corresponded to the officer’s shoes and due to the amount, any evidence that once laid there was erased.”
Bruce couldn't blame the men for not rushing to go into the tomb. Even he would be hesitant to go into a dark tomb that may or may not hold the body of a man who was a serial killer and used magic to accomplish such killings.
“What do you mean husbands?” Thor asked, not believing that the fair maiden flitted around from man to man as suggested in the film.
Clint snickered into his palm at the expression gracing Tony’s face, even Natasha found it difficult in containing her amusement.
“Nice dig ‘Tasha,” Tony snorted. “Now that we’ve established that Nat’s a long lost Princess, how about we get back to the film and then air out all our dirty laundry.”
“Indeed,” Thor agreed. “Although I am at a loss at to why it was your last case together when you both work well with each other.”
Tony pondered the idea for a moment before agreeing, his mind doing a happy dance at being able to teach the master assassins a thing or two about fighting.
“That’s one way to put it,” Steve mused, although he found it slightly creepy how silent the jail was without its occupants.
Thor grumbled a few Asgardian curses in response, accepting Natasha’s explanation but obviously not happy with it.
Bruce was confused to put it lightly. It was obvious that this version of Tony had a different perspective of everything, likely caused by a hyperactive mind that needed much stimulation. What he didn't understand was why it would be the last sane though. Was it that Tony would go mad from not being able to do anything to save those people? Did his mind become over stimulated? Were the three people important too him, causing him to lose himself in grief? There were so many things that he wanted to clarify with Tony but one look at the man in question caused Bruce to keep his lips locked tight. Tony’s breathing had picked up slightly, the man shaking visibly before he stilled as Steve put a hand on his knee to calm the engineer.
Instead of the usual worry that would accompany an action like that, the team felt a sense of humour at the sight of the bag going over Tony’s head, as they saw that the man hadn’t looked worried when it happened. For some reason that they couldn’t explain, they knew that things weren’t going to play the way out the way they were supposed to.
Tony patted Hulk’s arm gently. “I understand you buddy. I feel the same way and I promise you that I will never leave you or Bruce and that you will always have a place here for as long as you want. No one can break that up.” Hulk smiled as he heard the honesty and love in Tony’s voice, his grip tightening as he brought his other arm around to hug the inventor closer to him. Tony reciprocated the action and clung tightly for a few seconds as the team watched fondly, patiently waiting for the future where they too could declare how Tony had helped them become a family.
“So you use the details to deduce how the details were created? Like how you saw the detail of the stain and were able to figure out the most reasonable way it was made?” Clint clarified, his face twisted in slight confusion at Tony’s explanation that relaxed when Tony beamed at him in response.
Steve breathed in awe at the sight before him. “It’s amazing,” he whispered at the sight of history, receiving a puzzled glance from Tony.
“You better not be meaning that as a double euphemism,” Tony muttered, ignoring the chuckles of his team mates around him.
Hulk decided that it was time to return puny Banner. He felt much calmer than he did earlier and believed that he had given enough to Tin Man right now that it was time for Banner to show that they needed Tin Man to stay safe. Hulk gave one last squeeze to Tin Man before reaching inside for Banner.
"We need him back in New York," Ms. Potts said, her words reluctant.  "I know it hasn't been long, but Dr. Banner said there were new readings and he's worried the Tachyon particles could become dangerous.  R&D need Tony to look over a few things as well.  I've contacted Jeanette already and she's ready to come out while Tony and I look in on Roberta to make sure she's doing alright.  Not that she'll let us forget she can get by on her own - she's been feeling better."
"Then if what he's saying is true, I'll have to stand down," Steve said, even when every inch of him was screaming against it.  What would Steve Rogers be without the fight?  He didn't know.  He should have gone down with the last Great War, because this century had no place for him, not if he was going to destroy it.
The sun shone through the window of the airship and onto Tony's bed, but what warmth the sun's rays gave him slowly left as he turned over and closed his eyes against the prickling feeling.  A dream.  His breath hitched as he curled up around his pillow.  That was worse than the nightmares.
Steve laughed.  Even as a computer-generated body, his husband was insatiable sometimes.  Sex was... interesting as an AI.  It wasn't an imperative like it had been when he'd had a real body, but it was still fun.  "Then I have a request," Steve said as Tony straddled him.
"They will," Steve said, an arm sneaking around Tony's waist possessively.   Tony fought back a wince.
"Why is the coffee downstairs better than the one in here?" Steve asked, a little unnerved by Tony's silence.
"I think it was thunder," Steve said, sounding unsure.  "It sounded like thunder.  It was really close too."
No Natasha, but if he hadn't been out that long, then she might still be interrogating.  She liked interrogating when one of her team was down.  Tony knew how she got when she was fretting, and giving her something to do helped.
Tony snorted, then made a few more swipes at his phone. "I've bought you the current best recommended version of Photoshop and a proper tablet, and I'm sending you some YouTube tutorials. Much better than drawing on a napkin when you're out and about, I promise. Just have FRIDAY set it up for you when you get back. She can also help you find a site to post your art to if you want to share it with the rest of the world."
"Could I?" Steve prompted when Bruce trailed off.  He didn't know how much help he could be off the field.
"What?" Steve asked, feeling like this went even more over his head than it had been before.  He understood the terminology, of course, because even Captain America couldn't escape the hell that is TV tropes (he blames Clint entirely), but how did Carol factor into this now?
Steve was going to look into sulking less obviously.  "Respectfully, sir, that's none of your business."
Tony woke up, surprised by the lack of pain that usually accompanied such self-sacrificial stunts.  Then he remembered he didn't have a body.  Unexpected plus, that.  Having a physical body was definitely overrated.
Natasha tisked.  "For someone who lectures Steve about high metabolisms, you should maybe listen to them yourself once and a while."
"Doesn't mean you can't take care of it," Steve said, ignoring Tony's hiss at the antiseptic's sting and opening a Band-aid.
Tony hesitated.  He was falling and falling hard.  And Steve was compromised.  He had just nearly died - twice over - and remembered all the events of his past life all within a very short time.  Even if Tony wanted to make a move, he'd only be taking advantage.
He closed his eyes, just letting the scent of the flowers cleanse away the smell of Mrs. Fairfax's horrible perfume.  He could just stay out here.  Clint would probably find him and drag him back to suffer with the rest of them eventually, and he did believe in the cause, but he could pretend for just a little while that he didn't have to...
The relief that rushed through Steve was almost painful.  A wave of Tony's own relief flooded through him.  The city was safe.  He hadn't ruined everything.  He was safe too, and so were the others.  And with Steve curled around him, he could relax. He was just about to let himself pass out from the exhaustion when the ground shook violently, jerking him awake and shooting adrenaline through his system.
Steve growled, causing the voice to laugh.  That was nice.  He had half a thought of how that person needed to laugh more, because it was a nice laugh.  The voice seemed to be going away though, and Steve started drifting to some familiar and comforting noises in the background.  He knew those sounds, but he was too sleepy to place them.  Definitely not threatening, so he let it slide so he could get more sleep.
"Tony!"  There were hands gripping his shoulders, forcing him to sit back down on the bed.  His hand tightened around the card.
Iron Man had said something similar about Coulson.  Steve wondered at the similarity, but pushed it aside to think about later.  "Does he have any family?" Steve asked instead.
He'd been buried for another hour when the need to struggle, to scream, won over again.  He gasped in pain as his leg felt more pressure, enough to stop him from thrashing as he gasped for breath and listened to the falling rocks.  He had to stay
"What are you-" Tony asked, looking at him frantically as he tried to keep Steve down.  "Don't move, sweetheart.  You have to start healing."
Steve followed his gaze to the tablet.  "Are you on a break through?  We can order in.  I know how it's been frustrating you lately."
Natasha nodded.  "Latveria's defenses aren't anything to sneeze at.  Not something either of us can do without backup."
"Take it easy, man.  You nearly died out there," Sam said, then looked to Steve.  "Same goes to you, though your wounds weren't as bad.  That's twice we've had to do some intensive healing on you and even you can't bounce back from that.  The others got this."
"Works for me," Tony said, frowning at the burnt eggs as he returned his attention to his phone.  He threw the eggs into the trash then made for the dishwasher.  "JARVIS, call Pepper.  We've got good news."
A gasp drew Steve's eyes away from the reactor to Tony's face.  Brown eyes were now wide open, and Tony's chest started to rise and fall.  Relief hit him so hard that Steve's knees felt weak, and he leaned into the chair to keep up right.
"This is weird," Tony said, looking away almost immediately, but Steve couldn't stop staring.  "Is this weird?  Shit, this was a bad idea.  I can leave or-"
People said that Steve's disapproving frown was terrible, but Steve privately thought Bruce had the worst one. Or maybe that was just because Bruce was also immune to Steve's 'kicked puppy look' as Natasha called it.  "That's not enough.  Now eat," Bruce said.
His clothes dried quickly in the heat, and soon enough even Jarvis would consider him presentable.  He brushed himself off, looked in the water-mirror one last time as he tried to comb his hair into something manageable, then left the bath.
"I'll let you escort me where ever you like, baby," she said, her hand this time going down for Steve's crotch.  Steve neatly side-stepped her.
"A kid from Brooklyn who is also a movie star in his own right," Natasha pointed out.  "Didn't you ever meet any movie stars when you were on the screen?"
"Steve was there," Tony corrected, not meeting Jarvis's eyes as he puzzled over who 'Captain Rogers' was.  "He was..."
"That's enough," Cap said, his voice thundering through the room.  "I've known plenty of people who have fought with disabilities, but self-pity won't get you back in fighting shape."
"So I'm sneaking aboard the plane?" he asked, rushing to the kitchen to grab a few protein bars and MREs.  It was going to be a long flight, and he had to be ready for anything when he got there.
Tony was expecting the anger, but the disappointment was new.  And it hurt.  Steve's disappointment was almost worse than the anger, and it made him feel so small.
"Tony, Steve died before you went down, remember?" Rhodey said, keeping a tight grip on Tony, who once again started to struggle.
"If you two boys are finished, we can have lunch while you patch up so the human can stop fretting," Peggy said as she started to set out the basket she had brought with her.
Tony took his hand off Wanda's flank like he'd been burned.  He was breathing heavily as his heart pounded, blinking back the emotion of the vision.
Steve had been standing guard non-stop for the past few days.  There had been only once Tony looked out and didn't see the familiar blue bulk, but Peggy had been there, looking bemused as she shrugged off Steve's paranoia.
The glass still had the cracked spider's web that he'd put there, along with several small pieces of glass littering the floor and the hole he'd created.  Steve flushed as the guilt crept up.  He hadn't exactly been thinking clearly after he'd heard Tony was going to kill himself.  Then he flushed for an entirely different reason as he remembered the kisses they'd shared.
Tony couldn't break eye contact, though he wanted to.  Steve's eyes were full of stubborn will and a touch of uncertainty as he spoke.  "Great," Tony forced himself to say.  "You can go back to Sharon then."
