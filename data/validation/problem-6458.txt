Bruce smirked as he pretended to take the question into serious consideration “Hm,I think we should speed walk”
Steve smiled as he nodded.Thor returned the smile before looking to Willow and saying his goodbyes.She watched as the god left before turning her gaze to Steve for a moment.She smiled as soon as she saw him “Hi”
She slowly walked backwards to the door holding the flash drive to her chest.She mouthed the words:Trust me and she opened the door in one swift movement to avoid it from creaking.She slipped through the small opening in the door,and quietly closed it,leaving a confused group of avengers and a clueless Nick Fury.
He did his best media smile “Yeah no need to worry about it captain,It happens to people” It happens to you more than most, His mind whispered almost making his smile falter “So what brings you here?”
“You came at just the right time to ask questions,She just woke up” The nurse quickly opened the door making sure not to make to much noise “Although I do have to warn you,She hasn't spoken to any of the medical staff so far”.
Willow just smiled in response,Allowing Tony and pepper to take control of the discussion once again “I’ll fill you in one what you've missed on they way back to the tower” Tony added motioning for pepper to walk with him.
He almost forgotten that pepper was in a different country in a very important conference,And he probably should later on call her,He hasn't done so in a while.He sighed What was with his thought process lately?Thinking about what he shouldn't be thinking about and completely forgetting the things he should be focused on.
“You gotta be more careful than that tony! This is no time to zone out on us” Steve said as he caught his shield.
Bruce and Natasha exchanged Glances before looking back at Steve.Natasha stayed dead silent quickly motioned for them to follow her.She walked into a large room,In the middle of the room was a large black table with multiple seats around it,the room was used for multiple purposes.Sometimes it was used for debrief,Other times it was just used for meetings in general.
Tony walked to the doorway without a second thought “Whatever you say cap” He mumbled before tapping on the door frame,The young girl's attention quickly drawn to the door.Tony waved to the girl before speaking “Hey kiddo,it's good to see you again”.The girl stared at him for a few moments before realizing who it was and smiling brightly. She returned the wave enthusiastically making tony chuckle as he entered the room motioning for Natasha to join him “You remember Natasha right?”.The girl nodded before looking towards Natasha and waving.
They each agreed to watch Willow for 45 minutes so that when one person was watching her the others got to relax for the rest of the day.It was also agreed that they each could bring her to any location in the tower as long as it wasn't off limits although they were all pretty sure she had already gotten into most of the restricted areas of the tower and they just didn't know it yet.
Natasha quietly chuckled “I think she wants you to take the mask off,Tony” She faced Natasha and nodded indicating that she was correct.
“Hey you ok Tony?” Steve stopped walking and looked back at Tony,Concern written all over his face “You seem out of it”
He chuckled as she handed it to him “Thanks kiddo” He smiled as she waved to him,Steve and Clint giving her room so she was able to exit the door.She was probably going to go back to floor 66 or maybe to meet up with the woman she always called Ms.Smith.Who knows,With how sully and sneaky that girl is,there's no telling where in the tower she will will go next.
“Greetings son of Barton!I am here to watch over the one known as willow!” Thor boomed walking up to the small group.Willow smiled up at the god who returned the smile “Greetings young one I am Thor,son of Odin!”
He was cut off when,Surprisingly she shoved a cookie into his mouth earning choked laugh from Bruce who just happened to see what had happened from the couch “Hush child,Don't question it,and enjoy the cookie” She said Clint bursting into laughter at the scene that had just taken place,The others going quiet.
“I know!” He yelled “Jarvis send the recording to my phone cause right now I can't tell how funny that actually was.You-” He pointed to Willow “-I'm inviting you to my next meeting and you gotta use that trick”
She just smirked “Oh you know me,doing things I shouldn't,And I took it off the table during your meeting” Her grin grew even wider as she pointed in the direction if the table “And they did nothing to stop me”
Natasha playfully rolled her eyes “I can think of someone like that” Willow giggled as they spoke smiling at the exchange of words “What is life like here?”
Natasha sighed not knowing if she should be amused or annoyed “That still doesn't explain how you got past all the towers defenses and When did you get in here anyway?”
She was sitting on the desk a smirk in place.She held what looked to be files in her hand,Not looking up to acknowledge the 3 shocked avengers that stood before her.Steve glanced back at the door then to her unable to express his confusion,but in his complete loss of words was only able to sum up his thoughts in one question: “How?”
Tony groaned as he walked down the hallway debrief was horrible.As soon as fury saw the bandage he went on to ask about it and to say the least it ended with everyone nagging Tony to get it stitched up.And of course he wasn't going to listen to them.He was many things and one of them was stubborn as hell.
They all fell silent at the sound of her name Steve shifted on his feet anxiously “Have any of you noticed a….change in tony?”
Tony took a moment to glance at Natasha who was smiling at the scene in front of them and shot a amused look at Steve who returned the same gesture.Fury stared down at her for a long moment before hesitantly (More like awkwardly) Wrapping her in a tight (loose*) embrace.After a few moments he pulled away from a very happy Willow (Even Though the hug wasn't really that good) “Alright,Consider the job done Mr.Fury!”
“About a minute away Legolas, but enough about me, Jarvis says you’ll be there in 5 if traffics not to bad” He joked, smiling in satisfaction when he heard a dry chuckle from the other end of the comms.
Steve shook his head “No,no it's fine and-” He took a moment to think about his answer “-I'm not sure what I'm drawing if I'm being honest.I just can't really think of anything right now”
“Yeah that was a good plan kid” Tony admitted smirking as he did so “But I'm still gonna get you back” He said playfully.
He shouldn't be dead.But Tony on the other hand,He really should be.After those months in captivity the only things keeping him together where the thought of pepper and rhodey and also….him.But now he was dead,His body in a cave that was blown to pieces,the only remaining pieces of him will be bones,and the reminder in his chest of what he had done.
“This is gonna be a long day” Tony mumbled to himself as he entered in the code to his workshop lazily.
“I don't think we have enough time” Bruce said through gritted teeth earning a determined glance from her.
At first Steve looked shocked at the rude response,And then for a split second he just glared at Tony before walking off.Tony let out a sigh of relief.
“Did you guys upload whatever is on this thing to the system yet or what?”Bruce asked changing the topic from why was it found to what it was exactly that they found.
“I’ve been also meaning to ask you-” She looked back up to face him waiting for his question “-What did nick fury ask you when we were in the hospital?” She remained quiet for a moment looking at Tony blankly as if she didn't see him at all before smiling again “You mean the man with the eye patch?” Tony nodded “He didn't ask much,Just if I saw anything,Like a person on creature of some sort.He also asked what was it that had hurt me” She focused her attention back on the power source sighing as she did so.
Steve nodded in agreement “he seems like he's out of it most of the time now,and he's actually a lot nicer than he usually is”
I'm sorry!!! Trying to fix my writing scedual is more difficult then I thought and like last time if you want to call me out for it in the comments you can.I hope your having a good day and I hope you like the chapter!
Tony looked over to Natasha not expecting the sudden question “Don't know,What person,Or thing,did this.You think one of those things did that her?” Tony motioned to the girl “Damn,That had to hurt like hell” Tony mumbled quietly to himself.
He looked down at a sideways reception desk, noting how it was riddled with bullet holes and couldn't help but imagine someone using it to hide. Behind it laid a chair which had fallen on its side, most likely in a struggle or in the rush to evacuate the building. He swiftly made his way towards a corridor on the left side of what used to be the front entrance, following a trail of debris and bullet shells (The amount made him think it was possibly from an automatic gun of sorts) that made its way towards a door at the far end of the hallway. As he continued on he couldn't help but wonder why he couldn't spot any blood. Maybe it really was an act of terror and they were just shooting randomly into the building, he thought as he leaned down to pick up a bullet that wasn't used. The only way for this bullet to have ended up like this was if someone has reloaded and pulled back the slide to make sure they had ammo. But, If they were shooting randomly then why did they go through the effort of double checking to make sure their gun was loaded? He studied the small bullet, his experience with metals and (regretfully) weapons told him it was made of lead. It was a soft point bullet.
“Well,Given the multiple breaks in the numbers and symbols we can make the assumption that it isn't any type of code,and since their is constant repetition of multiple numbers,We can also assume that this is some sort of coded message….” Willow trailed off “Did I say something?”
She giggled “Yeah you're right” She paused for a moment as she gently grabbed Tony’s hand as if she was looking at something.
He prepared himself for the possibility of seeing another dead body today as he passed the threshold of the door and into the other room. He took in the sight of the band room before him, once again, he noticed how painfully ordinary the building was. The room was filled with nothing but cubicles, and nothing was out of place, well except for the papers and folders that were scattered about but that was excusable (Read: Evacuation). The only thing worth further examination was maybe, just maybe, the room (Office?) located at the back of the workspace.
Clint cleared his throat loudly in an attempt to ease the tension in the room but to no avail.Tony looked at him for a few more moments,before quickly turning away so no one could see his growing blush.He mumbled his goodbye as he walked-No more like ran out of the room.
She put her figure over her lips as an indication for them to remain silent and pointed to fury as if to tell them to act like she wasn't even there.She pulled a pen out of her pocket tightly holding it in her hand for a moment,But quickly threw it to the left of the clueless agent.
She smiled “Alright,I'm also guessing I can stay in the workshop without adult supervision or else you’ll never hear the end of it from Mr.Fury”
“Or a prize.” Clint said finishing his sentence for him.He smirked “I think we can win this game of gamble,Right Stark”
At this the man looked at him, his glare replaced with a more somber and considerate look “Don't worry” He soothed “It's not for you”. Before Tony could question him further he had already raised the gun to his friends head and without any hesitation pulled the trigger. Tony stared dumbly at where she stood, gaze lowering to where she landed quickly after.
Tony took a moment to think “a little bit of both but mostly panic” He paused for a moment “Speaking or panic,Willow,Why are you so calm now? I mean I'm not complaining but weren't you freaking out just a minute ago?”
“Kidding,kidding I’ll go put it on” Tony stood up from his seat and headed towards the exit.Just as tony was closing the door he swore he heard Steve mumble something “Such an asshole”.
Steve chuckled “You and Willow,What else would I be smiling about? You're a good duo you two,I can't wait to see what girl you help her grow up to be”
“You know I don't think it's a good thing to read S.H.E.I.L.D files,not only does It put you in danger but I don't think people appreciate you reading about them” He stated as he flipped through the pages of the file and closing it abruptly.
Standing right behind Fury was,You guessed it,The tree herself smiling because she was either proud of herself for sneaking up on the director of S.H.I.E.L.D himself or just because it was part of her nature.Tony guessed it was both.
“Definitely can't stay alone” Natasha quickly added.They all remained silent for a moment “Go get the others I'll take first watch” Bruce quickly said as he took the files off the desk and putting them in the correct spot.
The memory of men yelling in a language he didn't understand as they tore open his chest,unable to do anything but scream as he watched them rip out his bones.The image of the dead soldier that had left the van to protect him only to be left dead in a pool of his own blood.
From what he could see it looked like she clicked the very top floor that you could go on with that elevator,So that would be floor 78.He chuckled to himself as he sped up the stairs ignoring yells of complaint people gave him as he nearly bumped into them.Well everyone thought he was was an asshole might as well worsen his reputation,right?
Steve cleared his throat,A smirk on his face.Willow smiled at the gesture “You're right Steve-” Tony raised a brow at the unspoken agreement “-The way Clint,Natasha,Bruce and Tony were laughing-” She nodded in steve’s direction “-Nearly blew my cover”
Tony nodded “Probably,I need to see it though” As if a signal Willow handed the laptop to Clint who turned the screen towards Tony and pushed it to him.He scanned the screen in an attempt the make sense of what was written on it.
Her confused expression remained in place “Who?” Bruce put his pen down frowning slightly at the question,Turning in his chair to meet her gaze.
But he couldn't fall, Not now. He had people to save, to help. So IronMan was flying, flying above his city, flying above everything he swore to protect. He flew higher and faster, but he knew it only meant he would fall farther and farther.
“Oh nothing just wanted to get some fresh air” He winced at how tired he sounded “Wait when did you get here?”
Tony walked up to one of the counters leaning up against it to focused on his question to notice what was on the table “That’s great and all but,recent findings on what?”
“Thanks captain” Tony quietly mumbled under his breath reaching his hand up to face to press along where he felt a stinging pain,But quickly withdrew it,The pain increasing significantly when his hand made contact with his cheek “Ow fuck..” He hissed quietly to himself.
He bet Deus ex machina was making these goddamn things cause they looked like they came out of a horror movie.
“Stark,suit up.If your theory Is true then there could be a possibility that whoever did this is still trying to ‘get rid’ of her” Steve commanded.
Steve walked into the living room greeted by the loud noise of Thor’s voice “And that's when i-” He paused when he finally noticed Steve “Hello Stephen! Is it your time to watch over…” Thor took a moment to think.
Tony chuckled as he walked away from the room leaving the door slightly open “right back at you captain” He said silently to himself,knowing that Steve would still hear it “Right back at you”
Sometimes he wondered if he hated Steve rogers with his life or if he had fallen in love with the hero he believed only existed in fairy tales.
Tony choked violently on the water he had been drinking while the others laughed at the statement but quickly went silent when Fury shot a quick glare at them.He flashed a smirk at Willow as he took the water bottle “uh...Thank you” She nodded as she took an empty seat glancing at the laptop to signal she was ready to answer their questions but not before asking one of her own “What's that beeping noise?”
“I don't know stark you sounded a lot like a mother” Steve chimed in.Before Tony could come up with a reply he was quickly interrupted by the sound of the patient room door opening.Fury quickly walked out of the room,He seemed unsettled which was very odd,since he was just talking to a girl that was probably in her preteens and since he was Nick fury.
She glanced up at him,smiling “Hi Tony” She smiled absently as she returned back to sewing some sort of fabric together.He chuckled to himself as he took note of how calm everyone was.He smiled to himself as he noticed how Willow seemed to take a long moment to think before jumping up as if she was surprised,And quickly motioned for Tony to come closer “What is it kiddo?”
“Come young one,I have many tales of which I can tell” Willow stood as Thor began to walk out,telling her the beginning of a story.She looked back at Clint and Natasha and waved her goodbye quickly running after the god to keep up with him.
I live I promise and I'm back from vacation! I'm so happy I have WiFi XD but thus chapter is a little longer then the rest since I was gone for so long and I hope you enjoy!!!
He stopped as he came face to face with the door, able to take in the full extent of the damage done to it. At this distance he could clearly see the bullet holes, though they didn't see to be that anymore, they were... something. Despite the fact that they were the same size as a bullet, they were too neat to have actually been made by one. They lacked any splinters and looked as though someone had taken the time to smooth them out.
“Well I'm sure she's alright” Willow quickly blurted out in an attempt to pass the tense moment “Projects take long amounts of time to finish right? And we did just get this days ago.Also I like her last name it's pretty.I wonder what her first name is,Dr.Myers,Hey what doctor do you think she is? Probably something to do with biology or maybe technology but would you be called doctor if you only dealt with technology? Also I think she might be from America I think I read somewhere That it's it's a really common surname for Americans but then again I could be wrong” She continuously rambled earning a chuckle from Tony and Natasha.
2.I'm very sorry I have no updated in so long,I have got a major case of art block and have lost inspiration to write anything including my own personal stories but I hope that now I can go back to writing.
“Rogers!” Tony took both Bruce and Steve off guard.Tony never used steve’s last name at least not usually.He took a breath “Like I said,I appreciate the concern,but I'm fine I’ll just wrap bandage or something like that around it.Now come on we have to go meet up with fury” He was fucking exhausted and he felt like total shit.No need to make him feel even worse with stitches.
Both Tony and Steve shared confused and shocked expressions.Steve stared at the sketchbook in hand “Do you think that was…” As if reading his mind Tony quickly nodded.He seemed to stare into space for a moment before he began to walk away. “Where are you going?” Steve watched as tony paused mid step not turning to face him. “I'm going to find out when she got here and where they put her,captain” He continued walking wondering why he wasn't informed on the topic,Hell,he didn't even know if she was alive!
“Like Mr.Fury said,None of the other agents were able to hack into the system.It's because the system only gives you the opportunity to get past the firewall during a cretin time period,A second set of inscriptions if you will.This way,it is made sure that when you attempt to hack into the system,You’ll be sent on a wild chase that involves getting through pointless codes that will lead to nothing unless you're lucky and manage to actually be hacking into the system at the correct time.After that,It's actually really easy to get into” By this point Willow had pursed her lips into a thin line as she focused intensely on the computer screen,Studying the numbers and symbols “This was the case for one of Mr.Fury’s but they ran out of time and were blocked out”
It was nice to see her again.And by see her again he didn't mean in a hospital bed he ment good and well.Hopefully it'll stay that way.
“Tony are you alright?” The soldier couldn't help but ask again seeing as this was way out of character.
“Alright,We need to get back on track with the conversation!” Fury yelled silencing all of them.He sighed as he glanced at Willow “Now what I want to know is how did you manage to hack into this” Fury held up the flash drive before placing down calmly onto the table.
Steve sighed “I don't approve,She should stay in the city,for all we know her family is looking for her”
Bruce took first watch,Natasha was second,Clint was third,Thor was fourth,and Steve was last.Steve excluded Tony since he had been put in a rather stressful situation,and besides they would only watch her until Ms.Smith would show up so not much time was needed.
Ok so now that this is cleared up I wanted to create a vote on whether or not I should do a rewrite for the story.If I do have a rewrite I will include little bonus stories and what if's that just sit in my docs.If I don't do a rewrite then I will just continue the series as it is.Please tell me what you think I should do in the comments and I will do my best to make this the best story I can make it to be.
Bruce nodded,Giving Willow a look of confusion as she quickly ran up to the exit “I'm gonna go get some water for everyone!”
The noise began to get louder, or more likely, closer. The footsteps, as Tony soon chalked them up to be, were coming from the exact door he was heading towards. He raised his repulsors and got into a defensive position, the quiet whir echoing off the walls.
Tony turned around to the source of the voice only to smile at the familiar face “You have no idea willow” He sighed
“Jeez we go into war zones each day,You'd think we wouldn't want any at home” Tony said in his usual sarcastic tone,The room going completely silent “Oh also,Willow made sure to bring water bottles for everyone”
He sighed as he saw a few more ahead of him sniffing around in some rubble for something,but they didn't get far in their search as tony quickly shot them down “How many more of these things are on our radar?” Tony asked not turning his attention away from the task at hand.
She looked back to face Tony motioning for him to come closer to the hospital bed.Tony made no objections as he did what was wanted of him walking up to her hospital bed,slightly surprised when she tapped twice on his faceplate.
She giggled again “You get it back if you can catch me!” She quickly ran out almost bumping into a developer who had managed to stop in time and let her pass before him.Tony smirked as he watched her run off before chasing after her knocking  down some paperwork off one of the tables “My bad!” He yelled not stopping.He could apologize more formally later.
“Oh come on you relic, it can't be that bad” His sentence was punctuated by the sharp twist of the doorknob and the anxious scraping of the door being shoved open. Tony could hear their voices clearly as one of them, he was guessing the man, held the door open, casting a look over his shoulder and toward his counterpart who was right behind him. “Things will cool down after a while I'm sure,” He turned away from her and, when faced with Tony, stopped immediately in his tracks.
“So when someone asks Which one of you is my favorite don't be surprised when I say I hate you all equally”
She looked down to the blanket that covered her and rolled a small section of it up before unrolling it and repeated the process all over again “Your name is Tony right?”
She was much more….Humble,Than he thought she would be and instead of treating them like heroes and almost fainting like some people steve has met,She treated them more like human beings which,at times,Can be a very good thing.
He pulled out his phone and wrote something,Clicking a button and putting his phone back into his pocket.Pepper soon took her phone out of her pocket as she felt it buzz as an indication that something was sent to her.She looked at it smirking as she put it away again “Excuse me I have to go,I have important business to deal with” With those final words the crowd finally allowed her to leave.Tony tapped Willow on the shoulder gently indicating for her to follow him.
Steve stared at him worry written all over his face “Tony you need some medical attention,If you don't your arm will get even worse” He argued.
She continued to smile still holding the water out for him to grab “Bruce said you guys were arguing over how to read the code on the screen,and when people yell other people start yelling as well”
Willow smiled “It's good that you like where you are,How did you all even afford this place?” Natasha quickly glanced at Clint who shared the confused expression before looking back to Willow “Actually this used to be Tony’s tower,But when we became the avengers he made us our own floors to live in”
This time willow was the one to answer him “Yep,Sure some people disagree with it,but it's completely fine”
That took longer than expected,or at least longer than what Tony expected.They had all managed to complete the mission without too much damage to the area but there were still civilians who weren't evacuated yet Which proved to be a pain in the ass.It was the same weird mutant robot things or whatever the hell they were,and if Tony was being honest it was starting to get annoying.
“It's good you two got her here in time,Any longer and i don't think she would be alive” The doctor stated as looked into the room.The doctor seemed to be a young man,Maybe in his twenties or early thirties.He had brown hair and had worn both blue pants and a blue t-shirt along with a mask and gloves to match.In his hand he held a clipboard that seemed to have some sort of information on it.
“Excuse me sir” For a moment Tony had almost forgotten who’s voice that was but quickly remember “What is it Jarvis?” Tony looked over to Willow to see her with a slightly confused expression before simply shrugging. “I'm sorry to interrupt,but doctor banner requests your presence at his lab” Tony sighed “Tell him I will be there In a moment.Well I have to go deal with something” Willow slightly frowned but quickly smiled to cover up her disappointment “Ok!” Tony smirked “But don't worry,I'll make sure to come back tomorrow so I can give you more tips on how to sneak around” She nodded in agreement as she waved goodbye to him.Tony returned the wave,As he began walking away.
Bruce shrugged “He just wanted to know if Tony got the necessary medical treatment” Both Steve and Bruce turned to Natasha waiting for her own explanation “He wanted to know details on some missions”
Fuck,fuck,fuck,fuck.If he kept this up then Steve would want to know why.And that would just hurt both of them.
Bruce chuckled at the polite manner in which she spoke “Please just call me bruce and Fury still wants answers as to how you hacked that system while all of his highly trained agents couldn't”
“Tony behind you!” He heard someone,maybe Steve,Yell through the comms.He quickly turned around “Oh for the love of-” was all he managed to say before he was tackled to the ground,the creature biting violently at his suit,In an attempt to get through the metal.He swore under his breath as its teeth wrapped his helmet,Somehow getting a hold of his face plate and ripping it off violently,Tossing it to the side and going straight for his face.He hissed in pain as something sharp scrapped violently against cheek.He quickly took a hold of it's upper jaw shoving it up violently earning a loud yelp from the misshapen creature.He quickly shot at its jaw a loud snap sounding out,Causing the creature to growl menacingly to him.

“Yeah,I was Born there I remember I lived in this cute home for a while before we moved to Maine.Have you been there?” She tilted her head to the side when she asked her question as if by default.
Tony lightly chuckled startling even himself with the small gesture “Sure you were” Before anyone else could respond he handed the very confused soldier a water bottle and slid one over to Natasha who was watching the entire exchanged from her seat on the other side of the table,Looking to Willow who gave her a thumbs up.
“Not a thing” She explained still smirking.He looked over at the group shooting them a look:We’ll talk about this later.
Fury shot a gaze that tony couldn't read towards him before his eyes scanned the computer screen “How the hell did you get in when my agents couldn't?”
Hey guys! It's me and no I'm not dead. I've finally got my inspiration back but I will be rewriting all the chapters and will move this story to a different place. I'm so glad for all of your patience and support and I'm really happy to have such a supportive group of people helping me through this process. The revised version of chapter one will be up later on but I just can't give a specific time to when, wheather it be today or like a year from now.You can find the new version of the story in my works.
Willow shrugged again “Something about fury moving around agents or somthing like that.I’m really sorry I have to cut this conversation short but I really have to go now,I hope you have a good rest of your day!” She quickly ran off far to focused on the task at hand to hear Natasha saying her goodbye.
“We don't know,It started a while back,Probably something with the computer,It's fine,Happens a lot around here” Bruce said “It also sort of fueled the argument” After the statement they all sat there in an awkward silence.
He smiled as he spotted the young girl watching as one of Tony’s newest inventions was being put to the test,Not being spotted by any of the scientist or engineers who were to focused on their job to pay her any attention.Both a good and bad sign.He walked towards her casually “Hey kiddo” She nearly jumped at the sound of his voice before turning her head to quickly look at him smiling fondly. “Oh,hi!” She paused for a moment “I'm sorry I shouldn't be in here should I?”
“Not a clue” Tony leaned back in his chair tapping his figure on the table “That reminds me,did you guys tell him about the girl?”
Willow shrugged “Dunno just not make deal out of it I guess or maybe it just depends on what the fights about” She seemed to think about something for a moment “Oh shoot,I'm late, Ms.Smith is gonna be so mad”
She stepped away from the door “I will be in the nurses station if you need anything.And if you can,please make this as quick as possible we want to run some tests on her before she can sleep again”
“Willow!” Her eyes shot to a women that had been standing by the exit “We need to leave!” She stayed quiet for a few moments as if pondering her choices before calling back to her “Coming Ms.Smith!” She quickly apologized to Steve once more before running to the exit clutching the clipboard tightly.Both she and the women seemed to briefly discuss something before the women allowed the younger of the two to exit soon following quickly behind her.
Steve still seemed skeptical “Are you sure-”                     Willow quickly hushed him “Dude it's fine,You can be the most gayest piece of garbage you want to be and no one can stop you”
She crossed her arms over her chest “Careful captain for a second there it almost sounded like you were getting attached”
“Maybe,who knows?” Natasha seemed to get lost in thought for a moment,quickly answering her own question before Tony could “No one yet”.
Willow smirked as she waved,knowing a proper goodbye was not necessary since she knew she would see him again.
She giggled “Thank you for mentioning that because I was just about to tell you-” She walked out of the room,Allowing Fury to glare at the now silent avengers.They snapped back to reality when they heard the loud thump of something slam against the table.A open laptop (Where the hell did she get that?) Was now on the table facing in the direction of Fury,Willow rocked back and forth on her heels “I got you in”
Bruce paused for a moment “Recent findings on those unidentified creatures you guys fought….Fury did tell you he wanted me to study them,right?” He looked up to Tony waiting for his response.
Tony would have made some sort of snarky comment to damage the soldier's pride but seeing as he really didn't want to be left alone with his thoughts he let it slide “Help with what?”
“Why me?!” He quickly asked attempting to gain Control of the conversation “I'm not even the oldest in here!”
She turned to him her expression blank as If she didn't recognize him for a moment but offered a tired smile “Oh sorry…” She turned to gaze at the chair in front of her letting her smile drop completely as she set her gaze downward and Resting her head in her hand,similar to a gesture Tony found himself doing when a negotiation wasn't going the way he wanted it to.She didn't look like her usual joyful self,She looked tired,Stressed,she looked like him…..
Willow stopped running but Dum-E payed no attention to this as he continued going forward “Yeah!” She enthusiastically answered never taking notice of how close Dum-E was.He chuckled as Dum-E poked Willow in her side making noises of victory
Steve tapped his foot on the ground unsure of how to react in this situation “So,you're telling me that out of sheer boredom you snuck into the avengers HQ”
She rested her head in her arms a dopey smile in place “Yeah I know,which is why I only read the random details at the bottom of every file,Ya know the weird facts you know for some reason and usually don't have much significance”
Willow for a long moment stared at the computer screen,Smirking as she did so “This should’ve been improved…..” She mumbled,Her eyes reflecting the blue background of the computer screen.Before anyone could question her statement she smiled and faced Bruce “Mr.Fury is probably gonna disprove of this but usually I watch the S.H.I.E.L.D agents while they work,so I guess I just observed when they did and didn't try to infiltrate the system”
Tony sighed as he walked out of the jet,subconsciously Stopping mid way as he quickly got lost in thought.
“Hey where are you going?” Tony asked with a playful tone as he allowed the tower door to close once Pepper entered.
She nodded but she seemed doubtful “Ok..what do your teammates do for a living other than the regular hero stuff?”
Willow chuckled piecing together his actions and his words just as she had done with Tony “But it ended up as a full blown heated debate?”
Natasha watched blankly as the girl waved to her a smile tugging at the corner of her lips “Nice to see your doing well”
He was surprised to hear that almost every night she had snuck out of her room and went exploring or at least that's what the staff thinks.They usually only see her on the security cameras once or twice,It was almost like the kid knew exactly where each and everyone of them where.She wasn't even supposed to be able to get into floor 65 in fact,but somehow she just manages to get past every single form of security.
Tony shook his head “No it just hurts like a bitch in general-” He was quickly cut off when Steve,To everyone's surprise,casually whacked Tony in the head.
“Yeah,yeah I'm fine.Damn..” Tony half mumbled to himself as he grabbed his right arm tightly in an attempt to stop the bleeding wincing as he did so “Those things are stronger than they look,Didn't think they'd be able to get through my suit” He sighed as he looked down at the broken metal that covered his arm “This is gonna be a blast to fix” He mumbled angrily to himself.
He quickly glanced at Natasha and Clint,And then over to bruce who was on the other side of the table,giving them a questioning look.Bruce just smiled as he picked up the flash drive as if he were examining it,and discretely pointed to fury.Tony nearly gasped,biting his lip before the sound could escape from his lips.
“Welcome back to America pepper” Tony greeted with a smile,as a lovely woman walked off of the plane and to Tony.
After Tony is hurt there's only one person who can convince him to get stitches,But to everyone's surprise she's already one step ahead of them
She giggled as he tugged at her shirt playfully “Yeah,He did” Her attention turned to Tony,her eyes going to the papers in the desk for a split moment “So what are you making?
Pushing the coincidence to the side for later investigation, he lazily pushed open the door. He looked to the left and wasn't surprised when met with the sight of an oval-shaped conference table, surrounded by black chairs (Oh, looks like they were the ones that spun, he loves those ones). And to his right there was-
“Men work in confusing ways” Thor stated to no one in particular,making,In his own way a valid argument.
Tony nearly jumped at the voice and quickly looked behind him relieved to see it was only Steve,He had been wearing his captain American armor with his shield in his hand.How the hell did he always suit up so quickly for missions?He quickly snapped out of his thoughts remembering he had a question to answer.
After ten minutes past Fury ended up scolding the avengers because they ended up losing the flash drive,repeatedly asking them ‘how could they lose a vital piece of information like that?!’ and how ‘They just had it!’
“Holy shit!” Steve was way shocked to even make his normal comment about watching her language “Steve rogers has a crush on Tony flipping Stark!” As soon as she spoke those final lines the loud thump of something falling to the floor could be heard in the other room.
I'm not dead I promise! I just had some end of the year tests and I lost some of my inspiration for this series but I'm back on track and also HAPPY BIRTHDAY MY STARK SON!!!! But as always I hope you guys enjoy this chapter and I hop you have a good day!
“All we know about the well being of the civilians is that most, if not all, have evacuated the immediate area” Fury growled. “So don't expect much of a commotion but don't be surprised if you find someone who doesn't exactly fit under the threat category”.
Tony allowed himself to believe the concern in Steve's voice was for him and not for the mission before he responded “Make sure you keep your guard up, these people have soft point bullets”
Tony shook his head amused “Well,I don't even know your age so I don't know if you are short or not”
“Ok,Ok that's fine,Back to the coded crap on the laptop,and Mr.Fury tell no one I wanna see your agents reactions” She picked up her seat and placed it back down as if nothing happened before sitting down and looking at the computer screen again “Next sentence!”
“Sir,Captain Rogers is outside” Jarvis suddenly said,taking Willow off guard.Tony laughed as she jumped,Letting out a high pitched squeak,before responding to Jarvis “Let him in Jarvis”
Ok…..now this was weird and kind of scary….but it was also pretty damn funny.Mostly funny if he was gonna be honest.
It was only after he tore his eyes away from the blood, which had now reached his suit, did he notice Jarvis' frantic requests for him to speak. He took a steadying breath “I'm okay J, I'm okay”. He allowed himself a minute to gather his bearings “Captain?” He hesitantly asked, having not yet fully recovered from the inner turmoil of confusion and disgust which had settled in his gut.
“And that means?” Thor asked his voice somewhat strained as if he had just finished lifting something heavy.
“From the looks of it this could be a new type of organization like the rising tide,But this one seems to be set on an entirely different goal” Fury stated,earning a nervous glance from Natasha but she said nothing.
“Yeah,Fury says he wants to hold a meeting with us” Steve smiled as he took note of how Willow allowed them to speak,without interruption “Hello Willow”
Steve nearly jumped out of his seat the voice startling him out of his thoughts.Willow stared at him for only a few moments before chuckling quietly “I'm sorry I didn't mean to scare you,I should have known better”
“We’ll ask her more about herself later” Clint finally said leaning back in his seat,Looking away from Natasha.
Due to some events the each of the avengers end up watching Willow for a while,but it actually isn't as bad as they thought.
“Ever since I found out that Willow likes to sneak around the tower.I wanna see how far she gets” He smirked “I'm gonna be very surprised if she even gets outside this door if I'm being honest”
Tony chuckled at the quick response the AI knowing him so well already,The door closing as he and Bruce walked out of his workshop “So do you think we should let her win or should we run?”
She grinned “Whatever you say” She looked back down to the needle in hand as he walked towards the exit “Going to your workshop?”
Fury nodded in approval “She will stay in the hospital for as long as she needs to but as soon as this girl recovers she will be placed in the avengers tower so if you see her don't be surprised”
She sighed “Look,all I'm saying Is that these guys tread lightly,and in my opinion this doesn't look like a regular slip up”
He felt like total shit.But of course he wasn't going to admit that,he would just have to deal with it or maybe grab another coffee later on,the last thing anyone needed was Tony falling asleep on the job.
Tony thought for a moment “Well there's Steve he's a very good artist,There’s bruce he's a very intelligent scientist and doctor-”
He placed his hand on his chin pretending to be analyzing the situation “Hmm,I'm pretty sure,4 feet is short for your age”
He closed his eyes for a moment before sighing and opening them again.He looked back to steve and clint again who still wore the same shocked expression from before except this time instead of standing there like total idiots with their mouths hanging open they actually said something “Ok,so-” Clint looked back at the door Willow had just used to exit “-At first it was just a joke but now I really do think you're a mom”
Steve shook his head “nothing,it's nothing” He seemed to get lost in memories as he smiled fondly “You just reminded me a little bit of Howard that's all” Tony quickly stiffened at the name and for a second it felt like his heart stopped as he gritted his teeth together,trying to keep the demons in his mind at bay “Oh”.If he had said anything else he was sure he would have fallen apart right in front of steve.Which would be bad,very bad. Steve frowned “Tony,are you alright?”
“Tony!” He heard someone yell but he was far to focused on not having his suit ripped to shreds to care.The loud noise of metal hitting metal rang in his ears as he felt the pressure that was pressed down on him quickly leave his presence. “Tony are you alright?!” Before Tony knew it he was quickly being hauled up to his feet,vaguely aware of the screech that was followed by multiple gunshots.
Everyone stayed quiet for a moment trading confused glances with each other. “We just went over some details of the mission” Natasha said breaking the silence.
Tony seemed to ponder the topic for a moment and sighed “She can just stay in my and pepper’s living quarters,Sure I'll have to call pepper and make sure she's alright with it but it's something I can do”
quickly wandered back to his original worries,might as well tell her now.Tony turned his gaze away from Willow “Hey Willow,um I wanted to give you the heads up that at 6:00 I'm gonna have to head out so I can go pick up a friend…” He waited in silence for her reaction.
“Well you two can sort that out later” Bruce motioned to the table Tony had been leaning on “The specimen is right behind you if you wanna take a look at it”. Tony stood up fully,No longer leaning on the table and turned around.
“Good idea Stark. Natasha, go meet up with Tony and Clint hold your position. Bruce remains on standby. If you happen to bump into any hostiles use your partner as a distraction while the other takes them out from behind” Steve ordered. A string of affirmatives followed the captain's order from everyone but Tony.
Steve’s blush grew even darker (If that was even possible).He turned to Willow who wore a bashful expression “oops sorry,I guess they heard me” Steve would have responded,but before he could he felt a slight pressure on his hand,and before he knew it he was being dragged back to the living room “Wait what are you doing?” He asked through gritted teeth.The soldier knew very well he could withstand Willow’s tugs,but in his mind it didn't seem right.
Natasha frowned in confusion “These guys obviously don't want to be found so why now?They leave no trace of who they could be but leave us a hard drive?”
“Language!” Steve quickly stated causing the room to erupt into pure chaos. After a few moments of incoherent sentences and yells Tony was first to attempt to silence them “Ok,Ok,Shh,Shut up,Shut up,Calm down!”
Tony couldn't keep a smile off his face as he glanced up from his work,Watching Willow run from the right side of the room,Dum-E following after,and soon run back to the other side again laughing as Dum-E made beeps of protest.Tony sighed as he looked at the clock,It was 5:30 and he had to pick Pepper up from the airport at 7:00.He really didn't want to cut this fun moment for Willow short.
Tony rolled his eyes in response but there was a smiling tugging at the corner of his lips “Yeah,I suppose I did,but I'm getting you back”
“Coming!” Tony quickly grabbed his jacket as he ran out of the room,Laughter being the only thing he heard as he ran out.
Tony sighed as he placed Willow back down on the floor “Yeah,what is it cap?” He turned to look back at the two men who exchanged Glances with each other.
Steve sighed as he walked up to the pair “I was just looking for fury,Have you seen him by any chance?”
She stared at them for a long time with a painfully neutral expression,Before suddenly standing up,Her chair falling to its side from the force.She let out a loud groan of annoyance “How the hell are you supposed to be the hero's of the world if you can't tell me sex is! And trust me I know,Like really ‘we don't know’? That's a shit excuse!”
The door, which was lined with bullet holes, was propped open slightly (Maybe this was the room they were in?). Tony didn't give it much thought as he made his way towards the door, casting quick glances at the nick-nacks and photos scattered about on the desks he could see. Once again it seemed like an ordinary building with ordinary people working in it. (He winced slightly as he noticed a broken picture frame of a family on the floor, and hoped whoever it belonged to made it back home.)
“Had to be done or not, doesn't change the fact that the boss is gonna be pissed off” She chuckled again “When the crowds come for you with pitchforks and torches I'm not gonna cover for you”.
Bruce glanced at Tony who shared the same surprised expression as he did “How did you figure out it was timed?”
“Ya know for a professional archer you really missed the target on that one,Katniss” She quipped although her words held no bite,only amusement.
Fury gave him a cold stare but other then that he moved on to the next topic “Speaking of ‘Those creatures’-” Fury shot another glare at Tony “-It's becoming obvious to see that they could be looking for something,So next mission I advise it would be wisest to at least attempt to find the source.Understood?”
Tony's eyes widened as he went to look at her again “Yeah,if you want although I don't think we'll do much”
Pepper returned the smile “It's good to be back Tony” Her gaze drifted slightly to the side “You must be Willow”.
He smiled as he met her proud gaze,What did this kid ever see in him? “Always” He was glad that she accepted him,And it made it much easier to live with the fact that most people didn't.
Bruce quickly walked up to them “Seeing that both of you seem to be arguing I'm guessing your talking about Tony’s arm.I can stitch it up for you if you want Tony,I know you're not the biggest fan of hospitals although We’ll probably miss debrief”
Just another day,Some questions are answered but Tony soon realizes just how much information they don't have
She shrugged “About an hour ago,That relocation meeting or whatever it's called got cut short,And Ms.Smith had to go somewhere which left me here with a bunch of locked doors-Never leave me with a bunch of locked doors around me by the way”
“Caught you!” He quickly picked her up with ease as she giggled and squirmed “No fair you're faster than me!”
In the hurry to take action, Fury had personally told them they would be going in completely blind. The few bits of information they had been able to get a hold of had been provided by one officer Garcia. Before contact was lost the last few things he reported was that first responders were attempting to create a perimeter and that the attack was being carried out by a group of heavily armed masked individuals. That gives Tony a who but not a why. It could have been an act of terrorism, but that doesn't explain why they stopped (seeing as terrorist want to cause, y' know terror), nor does it explain the craters in the ground. The officer had only described them being heavily armed with guns. Only guns. Maybe they did have something like a huge drill and he didn't see them, which would be very fucking unlikely seeing as it would have needed to have been a really big drill, but still.
“Ok so you're telling me that-” He pointed to the animal “-Is supposed to be a fox?What the hell does that to a fox?”
Bruce chuckled “She is weird but in a good,and funny way.She’ll add some joy to this place,Honestly some of those S.H.I.E.L.D agents need to smile before they break their faces”
She shrugged “She's a popular topic among the people around here,Just recently they were just saying something about how she has so much to handle and that some guy is probably super rude and selfish and that it must be hard to work for him.Who do you think this guy was?”
“It will take me a while but yeah I think I can do it….Have any idea what I’m looking at right now?” Tony asked expecting someone to answer him,just not this certain someone.
Steve walked into the HQ sighing as he did so,He had hoped that he could find fury here to tell him that the ‘relocation’ of Willow was no longer necessary.He sighed again,He didn't want to put Tony through all that trouble but it was sweet in a way,Giving a girl he barely knew a home.That went against all Tony Stark's Sarcasm,Or maybe Tony was just nice to kids,Who knows.
“.....Having an argument like conversation” Steve finished,Finally finding the words to (Kinda) describe the situation accurately.
“Whatever you say captain” He half said to himself.He turned around to face Willow who was waving at Steve and Clint who smiled and waved back at her “Well,I gotta deal with something kid”
Bruce took a moment to stare at her slightly taken back by her question “No I haven't considered that yet” She said nothing as he took back the clipboard examining it himself.
He sighed as he took a seat opening his sketchbook to a new page The two soon fell into a comfortable silence the only noise being the scraping of steve’s pencil against paper and the tapping of raindrops that began to fall outside.After a while the soldier took a quick glance towards Willow,To his surprise was staring out the window,her head resting in her hand as she watched the outside world quietly.Steve allowed himself to look outside the window as if trying to see what she found so interesting before he looked back down to his half drawn picture flipping to a new page.
Everyone went dead silent,Even the director of S.H.I.E.L.D himself who was obviously trying to avoid her gaze by looking down.
He couldn't help but smirk,Getting the reference from that stupid whale movie “Oh come on, what's wrong willy,Don't like my new nickname for you?” He chuckled “That's your new name,I'm calling you willy from now on”
Tony bit the inside of his lip in an attempt to stifle another laugh from escaping his mouth “No sir,Not at all” He glanced at the others knowingly his urge to laugh growing.
Before Tony could speak Willow spoke for him,maybe a little too eagerly “No,no it's fine,It's clear to see you need us for something important” She cast a quick glance at Tony “We can continue our discussion later.So,Dr.Banner what was it you needed us for?”
Willow chuckled “No?,Then what was with that moment between you two? You don't just gaze into someone's eyes like that”
Tony opened his mouth to say something in his normal rude and sarcastic way but quickly closed it.Let's try to not be a smart ass for once.Tony looked behind him and motioned to Willow “Actually she got me here to get my arm fixed so no need plan anything”
“Well whatever it is-” Steve started but paused,the loud bang of his shield against something could be heard “-It's definitely a problem”
Willow giggled but took a step away from tony ending the hug and looked away embarrassed “I would but everyone always says I'm short for my age”
Fury sighed already angry with them “Why didn't anyone care to tell me about this earlier?”.When no answered Fury opened his mouth to say something else but was interrupted before he could.
In the end he told Steve that he had three options either keep keep an agent from being transferred to the tower,Find an area in the city to put her in,Or,As fury said it, Find another damn place in the tower to keep her in.This was going to be a difficult job.He didn't want to drag anyone else into his own problem but due to his lack of knowledge for the twentieth century he might just have to do so.And that person just might have to to be tony.
Steve rocked back and forth on his heels the same way a child would which Tony found,for some reason,To be cute “Well,Fury says he wants to relocate Willow and I'm trying to find a way to keep her in new York since her family could be looking for her” Steve left out the part that she also seemed to make the genius happier.
Tony slid the flash drive to bruce,who he noticed was trying to get a better look at it “Possibly-” He stopped speaking and frowned in slight confusion when he heard Clint chuckle or at least he thought.They all turned their attention to him,He wore a deathly serious expression that was way to forced to be normal.
“If you know what's good for you, I suggest you put down your weapons and come with me” Tony cautioned, watching intently as they looked at each other. This continued for a few more seconds before the shorter of the two, the women, hesitantly nodded. As if on cue the man reached behind him, taking out a small and sleek handgun. Tony had already been prepared to fire, the small glow emanating from the middle of his hand growing brighter in a quiet threat.
Steve chuckled,While bruce and Clint burst out laughing at the new nickname for the genius.Natasha smirked “You had it coming Tony”
He rested his head on his hand “No no it isn't a bad thing,I'm just a little surprised you haven't heard about him.We caused a lot of destruction that the news just whent crazy about” He gave her a sideways glance taking note of how she looked down.
When IronMan flew, it was a sight to behold. The people on the world below him would look up in awe, and wonder. They would think "What an amazing person he is".
Fury closed the door to the hospital room “No,She claims to not have seen anything but,I still want to monitor her,She's a...interesting child”
Steve seemed to think for a moment,As if choosing the best way to handle this situation “Tony and Natasha,I think it's best if you two go in first since she would recognize you”.
1.I have not abandoned this series and I have no intention of doing that anytime soon in fact have many plans for this story
Steve frowned “Hey” He gently called “just call me Steve,and I'm sure it wouldn't hurt to hang out a little while more”
IM SO SORRY!!! Life has caught up with me,in a very,very bad way so this chapter is very late.I'm probably going to attempt to write the chapter I missed last week on the weekand before next tusday.If you want to call me out for it in the comments you can.
Steve looked at him for a moment,Studying his expression,a frown replacing his usual carefree smile.He reached out a hand towards Tony and placing it gently on his cheek.He bit his lip as Steve traced the outline of what seemed to be a large cut “Damn Tony that thing got you good….” He mumbled sympathetically,The softness of his voice taking the genius off guard.When he withdrew his hand a large trail of blood ran down his gloves,The dark shade of red contrasting from there blue color “Common,I think that was the last of them,we'll ask bruce to patch you up…” He motioned for Tony to follow him as he walked away.
“Yep!” Willow threw a jacket at him (More specifically his jacket which was also gonna ask how she got that too) it landing on his head “Common tin man we gotta move!” He couldn't help but chuckle at the nick name.
The drive back to the tower was calm,the conversation was comprised of mostly Tony answering peppers questions to the best of his ability and filling her in on what she had missed along with questions of how happy and how Rhodey were doing (Rhodey had been on an overseas mission while happy was on vacation)
Oh that hurt a little,Knowing someone was talking shit behind his back but oh well it can't be helped.Besides it's been a long time since stark industries has had some job openings.
Bruce and Clint chuckled at Tony's response,While Thor and Natasha didn't respond because,Thor most likely didn't get it and Natasha is well,She's Natasha.
He shook his head in amusement “Try to avoid the video cameras next time” She giggled “Isn't this your tower” She covered her mouth with her hand in an attempt to contain her laughter “Why are you giving me tips on how to sneak around you tower?”
“Are you alright?” Bruce swiftly walked to the spot on the ground where Willow had fallen,already picking herself off the ground “I'm fine,I'm just clumsy-” She took the hand that bruce offered to her,Helping her off the ground “In fact the first day I saw your friend again I accidentally bumped into him”
“Homicide then suicide” Tony corrected, taking the silence over the line as a cue to elaborate “He turned the gun on his partner, then used it on himself when I tried to apprehend them. I suggest sneaking up on them, either that or create some kind of distraction, since I don't think the traditional capture method is going to go over well we these people”.
“The workers here talk,Besides it's so easy to find files of people here,Like way too easy” Willow admitted earning a disapproving look from fury.
“Knock,knock you called me doc?” Tony tapped on the black counter top of one of the many tables that filled the room.
But since you have worked so hard to get this message I’ll make sure your hard work was not all for nothing......
Willow smiled as she began talking on about how some of the scientist in stark industries had some major conflict between them.
“Oh,how rude of me” He quickly removed his mask revealing his face “Sorry about that,I should have taken it off sooner” He smirked as she rolled her eyes playfully,Still smiling.
She lifted her head back up,Obviously uncomfortable with the situation but better from when he asked the last question “Oh,you mean Ms.Smith?She was the lady assigned to take care of me”
Willow said nothing as she happily followed behind them,Her smile growing every time she heard Tony laugh.
If only Tony wasn't facing away from him, then maybe he would have noticed Steve’s worried expression.
Tony couldn't help but frown remembering how different she looked now from when she in that abandoned building,bleeding,and on the verge of death “Hey kid,what was it that hurt you?” He noticed how she quickly stiffened,her gaze becoming blank.She quickly shifted her gaze to floor remaining completely silent.
“So what equation are you working on?” She asked taking bruce by surprise.He eyed her warily for a few moments before turning his gaze back to the slip of paper he had written on “I'm just trying to figure out what mutations could have occurred in a animal based on elements that were found” The scientist explained or at least he explained what he was sure he could even share on the topic.
As if reading his mind Willow quickly spoke “Hey,Ton Ton it's alright! It wasn't your fault at all,She just made me a little uncomfortable that's all…..I also don't really approve of how she reacted”
She remained silent for a moment as if she was thinking if she should answer the question or not “Willow,my names Willow”
Tony smirked as he shrugged “Because I wanna see how far you can get past the towers defenses.Then when you get past them all I get to nag fury” She burst out laughing making sure to keep her voice at a low level so she didn't disturb the working of the developers.
“Sure,but only under one condition” She got up as he finished her sentence,walking up the the director of S.H.I.E.L.D himself “I’ll only do it if I get a hug from Mister Fury” they looked at the poor director expectantly,Tony holding in a laugh.
He glanced at pepper,who hadn't known Willow for long,but even she could see this was not the same girl she had ment nearly 30 minutes ago.
“And your pupils dilated when you were looking into lover boy's eyes,That's literally saying I'm into this person plus you have like a million drawings of him in your sketchbook”
Bruce sighed,as if he was remembering something annoying,And Tony could already tell it was whatever conversation occurred between them all “Well,It started out as a normal conversation but….”
“Well thanks Jarvis but I think it's already a little too late to be telling me that” He said in his usual snarky tone.
Tony took a moment to think before changing the subject “Who was that women that you were with earlier today?”
“Hey kiddo” Tony greeted as he saw Willow  in the living room.Over the little time she was here she adapted quickly to the new space and they adapted to her presence.She usually spent most of her time in the living quarters,but was also found just wondering around the area,Which was exactly like her.In the end she was polite,and never really asked anything of them,if anything she helped them in a way.
Tony was quick to reply “So Fury wants Willow for an explanation and he wants me so I can try and crack the code?”
Willow began to rock back and forth on her heels and lowered her hold on the water bottle ever so slightly,Most likely a result of her arms becoming tired “Well,Bruce told me their was an argument so that means people are yelling and Ms.Smith says you yell alot”
“Which brings me to my next question” Fury stated gaining everyone's attention once more “Do we have any idea who or what the cause of this incident was?”
“Where is stark?” Fury looked to the group that sat in front of him waiting patiently for someone to answer.
“Tony? What's wrong?” Steve questioned more sternly,as it became more obvious somthing was in fact wrong.The biggest hint being Tony’s lack of responce.Before Steve could get the chance to question further he was bumped into by somone and based on how hard Steve was hit he could tell they where in a hurry.Steve dropped his sketchbook and at the same time they both heard a yelp of suprize then a loud thump.They both looked down to the floor to see a female slightly dazed before realizing what happened. “Oh,I'm so sorry!” She quickly picked up the sketchbook and a clipboard she had most likely been holding.Steve sighed “No it's fine,i should have payed more attention to my surroundings” He removed his hand from tony’s shoulder,to focused on the women on the ground to hear tony’s breath of relief.He offered her a hand but she politely waved it away as she stood up handing the sketchbook back to Steve.She had been wearing a dark brown skirt with a cream colored button up shirt.On top of the shirt was a unbuttoned brown cardigan sweater which had pink bows embedded into the sleeves. “I’m so sorry i should have been more careful” She smiled as she looked up to face Steve but quickly froze once she did so.
“Nice to finally get to know you're name Willow,Now some of the people I know want to ask you some questions,is that alright?” Tony said choosing his words carefully.She pondered the question for a moment before nodding.He smiled at her before he walked away from the hospital bed and to the doorway exiting the room. “Fury you can go ask your questions now” Tony watched as he entered the room asking Natasha to leave probably so she didn't hear questions on some information they don't even know about.
Tony stared at Steve blankly for a moment “Whatever happened she's not willing to talk,which is expected,But I'm sure we'll find whatever or whoever did that to her”
He and Bruce looked at each other before laughing and picking up two water bottles each,Willow insisting that they leave her with the other three.Tony winced as he opened up the door,A very loud debate becoming very obvious as he opened up the door.
But that was Tony Stark's problem to deal with. And right now he was IronMan. And he had a job to do.
Just as soon as she finished her sentence the door to the workshop quickly opened making them both smile as they recognized the other scientist.Bruce stood by the door,smiling, as he motioned for them to walk over to him “Sorry to interrupt,Should I come back a little later?”
Tony sighed he knew exactly what a slip up like that could do,He would die.But did it really fucking matter? “Yeah,yeah I know I should always have my guard up so I don't get my throat ripped out by those creatures,blah,blah,blah,I learned my lesson”
“This organization is exactly like Tony and his one night stands.” The archer thought out loud taking everyone by surprise at the immediate change in topic “Like do you guys see how similar this is to having sex with no strings tied-OW hey what the hell was that for?!” He suddenly yelled when Natasha smacked him in the back of the neck.She cleared her throat and tilted her head in the direction of Willow who was watching curiously from the head of the table.
After some angry phone calls to fury and some talking with other S.H.I.E.L.D agents he had found out when willow had arrived she apparently came to the tower 8 days ago and because she was still sore from the hospital she didn't leave her room much which explains why he hadn't seen her around here before.What he did not find out was where she was being kept which annoyed the hell out of him.Fury said that it was on a “need to know basis” which was total bullshit.He was glad when he found out was where she usually was in the tower.He had learned that she had usually gone to floor 66,one of the many floors that had been dedicated to R&D.
Steve gave him a skeptical look but nodded “Alright,if you say so.Have a good rest of your day stark” Steve turned his back to him,walking away,Giving himself a moment to think about what just happened.Tony sighed as he placed a hand on the arc reactor blocking out the blue light.
“The employee's here love to gossip,and soon I just found out everyone's name which is good” She smirked “Goodness I have so much gossip”
“Oh ok” Not thinking much of the drawing,To Steve’s relief.She handed him back his sketchbook glancing at the clock,slightly frowning as she did so “Oh...Forty five minutes have passed,I guess that means you don't have to watch me anymore” She paused “Thank you for this wonderful evening Mr.Rogers” She stood to leave.
Bruce handed one to Clint and kept the other for himself,Seeing as willow was already handing one to Thor and Tony.She grabbed the last bottle with both her hands before turning around and holding out towards fury who had been standing patiently throughout the whole process “I got one for you too Mr.Fury!”
“Thanks” He quickly said as the beast fell to the ground “Where the hell do you think these things are coming from?” Tony asked not particularly to anyone as he walked around,Waiting for something else to come charging at him.
Instead of the same doctor from Before a nurse had led them to the room.Whether the doctor was on his break or off his shift he couldn't care less.
“We’re shocked at the fact that she's younger than us but swears like a sailor!” Steve yelled “Plus she was pulling our leg with the sex thing!”
About a while ago Tony asked Bruce if he could leave the lab since he had something important to do.Bruce said it was fine and let him leave although he did feel a little guilty about leaving him to finish their little investigation all alone.But then again he did have somewhere to be.
“Sex is….” Clint started off hesitantly drawing Willows attention to him “....We don't know what sex is.” He finished Earning an eye roll from Tony.
Pepper offered him a sad smile “Don't overthink it Tony,I'm sure you'll find who did this,but for now take care of her the best you can.You're changing this girl's life”
“I think you understand our motives but if you do not more fun for us.I know you are probably annoyed that this is not any information but since you have worked so hard to get this message I’ll make sure your hard work was not all for nothing……” She continued trailing of at the end just to start at the screen in shock.
“Yeah its it's a thing I do sometimes,I usually think faster than my mouth can move, Either that or my mouth moves faster than my thoughts” She stated resting her head on the table “Either that or I'm stuttering and if I'm not voicing my thoughts than I'm over thinking,And if I'm not over thinking that I'm just regular thinking.It’s a chain.I think you get my point.You know in Brooklyn I don't think I've ever ment someone with the last name Myers there and my last last name is bonnet,So that's saying a lot”
Tony sighed “Yeah I know,I know.Kiddo have you ever thought about making a quote? Cause if you did I bet it would become famous”
“Please when you were showing me your sketchbook don't think I didn't notice that move you pulled,not showing me certain pages” She teased.
Tony watched as she left before turning his gaze to Steve,Who was just smiling.He swore his heart stopped in his chest and had to quickly look away so he wouldn't see his blush “Uh,What are you smiling at cap?”
“Tony?” A voice sounded from door.Both Tony and Willow both looked towards the source of the noise to see Steve and Clint who seemed surprised-no scratch that who seemed astonished.
“Why does this always happen?” Natasha mumbled bitterly.They both stopped their arguing when they heard….Laughing?They turned their attention to Willow who had her hand over her mouth in an failed attempt to muffle her laughter “You-You two bicker like an old married couple” She quickly fell to the ground with a loud thump and for a moment everyone was concerned.That is until she continued laughing.
“Just get it over with Tony” Steve stated earning a groan from the scientist.He stared at Willow for a long moment before starting “Ok so sex is…..” He paused for a long moment “Something I used to do a lot”
He paused for a moment “I promise” She seemed to beam with happiness as she smiled “Oh almost forgot!” She held out Tony's phone “Your phone as promised”
She smirked “You're younger then you look” She happily replied laughing as tony sarcastically gasped offended.
“It means that these bullets expand on impact. If they were to hit a bone it would shatter and I don't know about you but I don't think anyone here would want to get benched for missions” He finished. Wait, would bullets even hurt Thor? Or what if they do but Asgardians just heal quickly? He would have to ask later.
Tony rolled his eyes at Rogers’ 'I’m-Captain-America-and-I'm-disappointed-in-you voice’. He didn't bother to respond as he arrived at his destination, taken off guard by the eerie silence even if he was expecting it.
Her tone was sarcastic yet teasing as she quickly opened the door and walked,More like ran out,Of the car leaving a confused Pepper and Tony.
Tony returned the smirk as he slightly nudged the young girl gently.He didn't know when he zoned out it was just something that happened he guessed,Although it wasn't difficult to not get lost in thought at least not for him,Especially since he had he had so much on his mind (Most thoughts about Willow and others about the creature's.His arm may have healed rather quickly but the gash in his cheek was still a constant reminder) He mugged her a few times before she shot up in a shutting position,making him flinch back in surprise.
Bruce closed the door behind them crossing his arms over his chest “Well kinda,Like yesterday he just let that entire fight between you two go so easily.And the fact that he let me fix his arm was also out of character too”
“try to keep up old man!” She giggled as she ran into the room without a second thought closing the door behind her.
Tony chuckled “I thought you didn't know much about us,You did say you didn't really know much about the news and such”
They all stayed in an odd silence before Clint sighed “So Willow do you have any family you look forward to seeing again?” They both took note of how she stiffened before smiling “Well I'm looking forward to seeing my mom and my baby sister,I'm gonna tell them so many stories when I get back”
They turned their attention back to fury who was once again pacing around the room “Stark,do you think there's something you can do with the flash drive?”
I'm so sorry I took so long to update! I took the feedback that some of you guys gave me and used it to hopefully create a chapter that you all will enjoy.I will attempt to create each chapter in a week but just in case be prepared to have to wait longer then a week for a chapter.Anyway I hope you enjoy!!! P.s.I'm sorry for being bad at summaries
“Clint, Tony” Natasha growled, “The mission if you would”. Clint muttered a quick apology while Tony grumbled a swift ‘yes yes I know’. As he continued down the narrow corridor it became more and more apparent that there was a strange noise (tapping?), Probably muddled from the buildings weird acoustics, being made somewhere deeper inside of the structure. Tony stopped for a moment, to see if it was him making the noise, but as the tapping continued he realized it couldn't have been him.
Here he was once again in the same hospital,and in the same suit.The only thing that was different was that instead of just Natasha being here it was now Natasha,steve,Clint and Fury with a couple of his agents that were here and instead of waiting for doctors to tell him the condition of the girl he was now waiting for doctors to allow them to speak to the her.
“Oh,I'm sorry….” Tony truly didn't know what to say,He should though,He hated himself even more for not being able to provide Willow comfort.
“Well hopefully she isn't done with those projects” Willow mumbled her eyes focusing back on the screen “We must destroy all those who are not proven loyal.Well if she's doing the projects we can assume that she's loyal,Well unless….” an unanswered question burned it's way into their conversation.
Tony gave him a dismissive wave of his hand “Yeah,Why not,you have enough work to do,So I'll just handle this situation,Go have fun,Do whatever it is super soldiers do on their free time” Tony was being sincere.
Steve stared at her for a moment before exchanging glances with bruce and Natasha “She can't stay alone”
“Do you think she might have saw something?” Tony suddenly thought aloud taking everyone off guard “Like Natasha said,she was hurt pretty badly.So is there a possibility that her injuries were result of a attempt to get rid of a witness?” They all remained silent as they took his proposition into consideration.
Just in case y'all didn't hear, this is getting re-written and I just posted the first chapter, so yeah. I also renamed it to "To the times I was human". So that's also a thing.
Steve chuckled “You two seem to be getting along well” He stayed silent for a moment his smile turning into a deathly serious expression “What do you think ever happened to her?”
Steve looked at her for a few moments confused at the expression before realizing something nearly dropping his sketchbook again “Hey aren't you that girl from-” Before he could continue he was interrupted but his question,in a way,was still answered.
She looked at the laptop for a second more before giggling quietly “I got it from one of the S.H.I.E.L.D supply closets or at least that's what I think it's called.That's why there's a stark industries logo on it”
Tony was gradually surprised when he realized the elevator had gotten to this floor at the exact same time as him,Was he really going that fast or was the elevator going slow...Eh he’ll look into it later.He snapped out of his thoughts when he saw a small figure dash out of the now open elevator doors.
“Like I said the files are so easy to gain access too,and if I'm being totally honest-” She banged her elbow against the table,Making them jump slightly in surprise,Especially when they heard something hit the ground.She leaned to the side taking a glance of the floor underneath the table smirking as she swiftly got out of her seat and picked something up “Pfft,This is where I put all the files I don't finish” She howled with laughter as Fury shot her a disapproving look and took the file away from her,More gently than Tony thought he would.
In a few long strides, he made it to the door, opening it quickly so it wouldn't make the loud grating noise it had just a few moments ago.
She continued staring down at the blanket for a moment before looking back up to Tony “Thank you Mr.Stark for helping me, it was a delight seeing you and Natasha again”
“It true” Tony mumbled placing a hand where the once large wound was,All that remained of it being a scar.
Willow chuckled “You know if Mr.Fury finds out you gave me advice to sneak around the tower he's probably going to get mad”
“That's the issue, Nothing's here,”  He thought for a moment “I'm going to search the area, I suggest you do the same as soon as you land” He stated before heading into the supposed targeted tower he had been examining from before.
“We have,but the information is blocked” Fury walked paced back and forth in front of them “We've made no progress so far in accessing the files”
“Something they said makes me think there's someone here who might need help.” The tense silence that followed did nothing to ebb Tony's growing anxiety at his own inaction. “Look, I would love to follow the order but I need to check if there's anyone here first.”
It had been a long night.Neither he nor Bruce got the sleep they should have but they did find out that whatever made the animal the way it was,wasn't an accident.They also found out that it was done with a lot of surgery,machinery,chemicals and like Bruce said there was a shit ton of radiation.
“S.H.I.E.L.D supplied me with some money,it was nice of them to do that,But I'm gonna go get some now.You too can go fun off the the others I'll make sure to get their quickly!”
Tony sighed with a hint of annoyance in his voice “I appreciate the offer bruce but I'm sure I'll be fine,besides I rather not make it so we get paperwork” He gently stated despite how annoyed he actually was.Like he said he appreciate the concern but he just didn't need it right now.
Tony opened his mouth to respond but quickly shut it again taking a few moments to think “I do not have not have mom instincts”
“You know like turn into the-” He took a breath obviously uncomfortable in the situation “Turn into the hulk”
She sighed as she opened her mouth to say something but closed it as they both heard a loud scream of joy “OH MY GOSH ARE YOU THE PEPPER POTTS?! Can I get a photo with you?! Also can you tell me what Tony's like,You're sooo lucky to know him personally!” Tony glanced in the direction of the voice cursing under his breath as he saw a small crowd form around Pepper.He looked to Willow who watched the small group form,Frowning sympathetically and nervously.
She shrugged “I don't know,and if I wanted to sound like an old person wouldn't I start speaking like him?” She pointed at Tony who just playfully rolled his eyes.
“Stark, Me and Thor are gonna search within the police perimeter to see if that brings up any answers, Natasha’s going to search in the opposite direction of you, Bruce will be on standby, and Clint's going top side” Tony mumbled a quick ‘Roger that Rogers’ just for the fun of knowing it would probably piss the captain off. He walked further into the building without bothering to wait for a go-ahead, Already knowing he simply wouldn't get one.
He chuckled “Who are you calling old” He yelled back in response as he quickly opened the office door.
Steve just smiled “Common Tony,let's go” His voice was soft as he stood and walked to the door.After a few moments Tony collected himself and stood,Walking over to join Steve,as Jarvis turned off all the power in the workshop closing the door as they exited.
“Think she's alright?” Steve asked his concern being obvious even though he made a failed attempt to hide it.
“How did you de escalate the situation like that,Stark isn't usually one to just laugh off a fight he had with someone so easily”
After willow had left with Ms.Smith they continued their regular routine to ,Tony's surprise,unaffected by the news that they would soon have someone else wondering around in the living quarters but then again who was he to assume?
“Well in my defence sir I had already informed you but you didn't seem to acknowledge me” The AI paused “It has also come to my attention that your heart rate is at dangerously high levels”
Tony stared at her for a moment “So then why did you say all that and seem like you were about to die of anxiety?”
“Oh hush” He walked passed them and to the door “Besides if anything calling me a mom would be a compliment” He walked out of the room confused gazes watching his every move.
“I was taking off my suit” Tony responded blankly,Trying to rid his mind of why that damn suit was even made,The fucking piece of metal in his damn chest,And how it was even put there in the first place.He sighed as he placed his hand on his arm gripping it tightly “so what did I miss?”
Steve returned the glare “You don't swear when there's a child right there!” He pointed to Willow who watched the dispute unravel.
“It's fine.Tony why were you running out like that? Is something wrong?” Steve questioned his voice filled with concern.
“Fine” She pouted “I'm 14 or no wait is it 13….Well I think my birthday was a while ago so yeah I think about 14 maybe?” Tony didn't like the uncertainty in her voice.A kid should know their age but maybe it was just being forgetful,Some kids are like that.He’ll ask about it later.
Her smile turned to a devious smirk “Cause it was the only way you'd get your stitches” Everyone seemed to stare at her for a moment.
“I'm not sure Pep…” He answered quietly not wanting to wake or even stir the young girl from sleep “S.H.I.E.L.D is trying to find them but….” He sighed as he met peppers gaze “...I don't think it's gonna end out to happily for this girl,How do we even know her parents aren't the ones who did this to her?”
“I’ll tell you later,It's a process” She laughed looking at the screen “Ok so the first sentence says,Eliminate Dr.Myers as soon as she had contributed all that she can to the projects.Oh,Poor Dr.Myers”
He smirked watching as Willow joyfully rocked back and forth on her heals “You seem happier than usual today,anything good happen today?”
“I did and we're getting off topic” Fury stated gaining their attention once again “Also...Are you telling us that you can read it?” He finally asked.
Bruce looked at Willow for a moment “So is this the famous Willow I've heard so much about?” He smiled “Nice to meet you,I'm bruce” She smiled as she waved to him.
Honestly what the hell was the motive here?Sending things out on new York that didn't really attack the civilians what so ever.Sure some people reported that they growled at them but other then that they just scared people off.If anything they were the only people these things had ever attacked.It was strange.
“Late for relocation meeting or something along those lines,They want me to choose a place to go” She explained,focused on something else.
“Tony you do it,You're the oldest” Natasha quickly blurted out earning a shocked look from him with a hint of anger in it.
Tony stared at her for a while before turning to face Steve “Remind me to bump up security please” He made a move to to turn around but didn't get far in his actions.
“She was born in Haiti.My grandparents on her side are nice!” She chirped earning a smile from everyone in the room (Including Fury even though he would never admit it)
He calmly placed the flash drive back down on the desk “They're trying to see what we're capable of,And they've made it into some sort of game.Three times they've sent these things lose of the city and each time we've managed to successfully complete the mission,So this-” He motioned to the flash drive “Is either another test or-”
“You're right on time,I wanted to give you an update on some of my recent findings” Bruce stated blankly too focused on his research.
