Tony squared his shoulders and pompously crossed his arms across his chest. He stated, “It is a title I wear proudly.”
Steve sighed heavily, running his hand through his hair and murmured, “That could have gone better…”
Steve continued to avoid looking at him but Tony refused to look away. Tony silently vowed to never ignore what was happening between them.
As Steve's head cleared, a new guilt washed over him. He had fallen asleep and spent the night. Everyone must have been worried sick about him, Peter especially. His stomach clenched painfully as he thought about his son. Peter must have been distraught. By trying to get better for him, he may have hurt him more than he meant to. His only conciliation was that it had worked, his best friend's presence brought him comfort and Bucky took all his grief without complaint and shouldered the burden with him. Steve knew he could face the world now.
Tony dropped his hands and fell to his knees. Venom continued to melt off Peter, revealing more of his skeletal frame.
Last night both of them wordlessly held each other tighter when falling asleep. Saturday night had been…horrible and not just because of what had happened between Peter and Tony. It had also been the first time in the five years in their relationship that they slept in separate rooms.
break your nose too!” She paused then reaffirmed him with her gaze and stated, “This is going to stop now. This is not high school. We are all adults and you three need to start acting like it. What is going on between me and James will be handled by the two of us. Do you understand me, Steve? I need to hear that you understand me because I know you are a man of your word. You need to promise me this will stop.”
Cable nodded and activated the glove. He disappeared in a flash of bright light that had a short delay of a loud, explosive sound akin to lightning.
“Jarvis has been watching all of the city’s cameras,” Tony replied. Steve’s eyes flickered up and easily found one of the glass black domes which concealed one of the hospital’s cameras. Of course, how could he forget about Jarvis?
Steve clenched his jaw but did not break his eyes away from Tony’s accusing gaze. He stated, “And I will regret that for years to come…”
“But once the judge hears our testimony, he’ll have to admit the prosecution is in the wrong!” Tony interceded angrily.
Steve snorted, remembering not ten minutes ago Tony making a similar exclamation about them not being married.
“Yes, but you are going to need a SHIELD liaison to monitor you and make sure you are no danger to the public and, we want you to know, the offer is still on the table. The initiative is waiting.”
He had wrestled with his insecurities throughout his workout and was finally able to harden his heart against the silly notion that had been born from his short liaison with Tony. He went to bed with his body tired and his mind resolved yet sleep was hard to attain and he tossed and turned all night.
“Hm? Oh, nothing,” Wade murmured noncommittally. He smiled warmly at Peter and gave Peter’s shoulders a squeeze as he said, “I was just thinking of the snuggle time I’ll be getting with my baby boy.”
Peter cleared his throat as he broke his gaze away from Tony and went over to the closest couch. He sunk into the plush cushions and peered down at his feet.
The robot finally lifted its gaze and met Steve’s eyes. Without breaking contact, it murmured, “Lead the way.”
Steve accepted the wrench and twirled it between his fingers thoughtfully. Steve considered the letters the little guy couldn’t pronounce yet and the general sound. He doubted this boy was named pony or boney, but maybe…
Clint, Laura, and their children were huddled together. Her partner was fretting over his family as they held one another. He continuously pressed a kiss onto Laura’s forehead and held both her and his children whenever they gave him the chance.
Steve must have been awakened by his movement because he suddenly ran his fingers through Tony’s hair and sleepily murmured, “Can’t sleep?”
The other Avengers called out quick greetings but, once they all had their say, his dad butted in and announced, “Pete, you should conveniently join us. Friday can direct you to our location.”
“It is! I’m sorry! I was only trying to help!” Wade squeaked franticly, misinterpreting his exclamation.
Steve threw back his head with a heavy sigh then looked down to Tony with a small smile. He lifted his fists and whispered, “If Bucky dies in front of my son I am seriously going to reevaluate my decision about teaching you these moves
“I am done being that man’s puppet,” he hissed. He pushed himself back, further from the door and the pull of Schmidt’s voice. It hurt even more. His body was trembling from the pain. He kept telling himself it was all in his head, that the pain was not real but his body did not seem to understand.
Steve poked him and Tony chuckled. They both settled down and Tony fell asleep dreaming of the Howling Commandos.
Coulson’s eyes went back to the chair and his emotions churned within him fear, excitement, and apprehension all collided without any change to his outward appearance.
Loki turned around, folding Peter safely into his elbow. Steve allowed himself to relax just a tad. Peter may no longer dangling hundreds of stories from the ground but he was not out of the woods just yet.
Thor had invited Jane Foster, Lady Sif, and the Warriors three and they entered the room with loud exclamations of congratulations and excitement. Peter hid shyly behind Steve’s leg as the warriors introduced themselves.
Peter hadn’t dated anyone since Gwen died. It’d been years but his heart still clenched as he remembered the loss. Peter had thrown himself into school and Spider-Man and gave himself no time for relationships…not that he even considered something with Wade…or any other “males” in general.
“It was less than five minutes,” Steve hissed. “You couldn’t be civil with the man for less than five minutes.”
Tony was not listening too closely to Jarvis, instead he was listening to the dialect of the people around him, who now had soldiers streaming into the room with weapons at the ready. But most importantly they were
One of Steve’s hands reached behind Tony and under the towel and it unknoted from his waist, making it fall to the ground. He pulled Tony tight to him, loving the feel of his naked body against his.
Wade could feel him shaking. He ran his hands over Peter’s flesh and whispered, “You’re close, aren’t you?”
“GET OUT NOW!” Howard exclaimed, pushing one more out. He pointed at the Commandos and said, “Not you, you guys get in here right now and make sure no one comes in!”
They grew up together in the 1940s where even thinking of a homosexual relationship was frowned upon and the actual relationship was illegal. Steve always assumed his feelings were one-sided.
Because holy hell, what a nightmare…opening up with the obvious trauma of his childhood neglect and then diving into the shit storm that he was headed toward with no warning.
She pulled out of his embrace and then punched his arm as she said, “I still can’t believe you didn’t tell me who your
Tony thought he was going to be the first to shock all of these people but Steve had to go and steal his thunder. In the background, he could already hear their audience going crazy.
Steve growled, “You have five seconds to start explaining yourself or I am going to forcibly remove you from the property and into the hands of SHIELD.”
He was tempted to ask Peter when they adopted him. Wanting to know when he’d become a father but but down on his tongue, knowing Peter would probably not tell him anyways.
Peter’s face sunk with his mood change and then he sunk into Wade’s arms. Wade worriedly looked down at his boyfriend and wondered what was going through his mind. Peter had adamantly steered away from any conversation about last night all morning.
“Okay,” Steve murmured and let Tony pull him closer while at the same time trying to hide the fact that he was getting hard from that single, chaste kiss. If that did not proclaim his true feelings to the man he did not know what else could other than saying them aloud!
Peter and his dad exchanged knowing grins. They hugged again and his dad motioned him to the door he came through. He murmured, “Go through there and the rest of us will go out the back way. I’ll see you again later tonight once all these well-wishers go away?”
“Are you patronizing me or buttering me up?” Tony asked. He let Steve pull him for half a second and then picked up the pace to walk beside him.
And Peter suddenly found the draw to his amazing shield lessened as he imagined Wade in his underwear, rocking against Peter, and panting heavily.
Steve smirked, already liking Tony’s eccentric manner, and replied, “Of course, I’m not from the Stone Ages.”
Tony fell onto the couch beside Peter and said, “I deny all the rumors. I did not fly into that building. It was all CGI and photoshop. You can ask Steve. He’d vouch for me. Steve!”
Steve woke slowly. The back of his neck felt like a heavy 2-ton weight was pushing down on him and crushing him. The crushing pain radiated throughout his body and burned all the nerves under his skin.
He expected one of the Guardians or Dr. Strange to do it. Not one of the Avengers, certainly not Bucky.
Steve should have felt nervous. He should have been dreading this half of the trial but… the media, his friends, and complete strangers figuratively sat by his side and heard all the truths that he had. There were still some naysayers, there would always be, but the majority of the country was on his side again. Steve felt like he was floating on cloud nine.
Peter walked up to the door shaking his head but paused before it. He quickly slipped off his glasses, shoving them in his pocket. He ran his hands through his hair and adjusted his shirt. He stood up straighter and then knocked on the door.
Both Steve and Tony stiffened upon Jarvis's words. Tony stared at the ceiling and refused to drop his gaze and meet Steve’s eyes. The sound of the water leaving the showerhead sounded like a roar in his ears.
“I have no idea what they are seeing, I clearly have a more refined jawbone,” Tony retorted, running his fingers down said bone.
“Don’t worry about it,” Bruce interjected. “We’re happy to see you too but, given the situation, perhaps we will give you two some alone time now?”
Peter jumped off the wall and onto the rumble on the floor. He checked his pocket to make sure his phone was still there then, after looking at the remains of the room and deciding enough time had passed, he asked Jarvis, “Have they decided who’s picking me up?”
They were followed by reporters from the moment they left the Tower. Their vans were like an unconventional escort that shadowed their every move. When they reached the courthouse, they saw that police had to set up a barricades to make a walkway for them to the building.
“We are one,” Venom reminded them both in a growl and came to a stop a few feet from the father. He finally spotted the piece of himself he had been following. He stared greedily at the mass on the father’s back.
He watched her entranced. Her lips were redder from kissing his and her hair was slightly rustled from its usual perfect appearance.  Her pale green eyes flickered up and focused on him. She stated, “If you want to kiss me again you need to finish cleaning those guns and then eat all your proteins.”
Steve went bright red and sputtered nonsense. Natasha grinned when she saw she had guessed correctly.
“Remember only the mission. Anything else is only a distraction and thereby detrimental to the mission,” Bucky stated monotonously, still circling him.
Wade pulled off his mask and lightly kissed Peter’s forehead. He pressed his forehead against Peter’s and hazel eyes met blue.
He could hear the media outside. It was louder now that he was on the same level as them. They were a constant murmur of voices. Sometimes he could pick out a word or a phrase, but, mostly it was a buzz, like that of a busy hive.
He felt Tony's lips twitch into a smile against his neck and he began to focus more of his attention on Steve’s chest.
Bucky extracted his hand from his scalp and smiled gratefully at Steve. The smile was small and nothing like the ones Bucky used to present him but it was there, tentative and weak, but the fact that Bucky was smiling made Steve’s heart swell with excitement.
“Jarvis!” Tony yelled. Distracted by Tony’s sudden call, both Steve and Ross turned toward Tony’s voice. They had both forgotten he was there.
The caller paused then whispered, “I’m so sorry. What I did was selfish and stupid and I won’t do it again…Once I take care of the Mandarin I promise I will come home and not just to the Tower but to you too. You’re my home, Steve.” Tony Stark paused then, before hanging up, whispered, “I love you.”
She turned her attention back to the matter at hand. Thor and Bruce waited for her orders. She was Cap’s second. Long ago, they decided if he ever went down in a fight she would be the next to lead. She never thought that moment would ever come…
“Tony,” he gasped as he stumbled forward. Steve fell to his knees when he reached Tony. He gasped again, “
Peggy nodded with a pinched expression and Gabe followed but he looked between Steve and Tony in confusion. He clearly was the only one who had yet to grasp the level of their relationship yet. The Commando whispered to Peggy, “Wha-What is going on??”
“When we get to the past it’ll stop fading until Tony’s future is altered by the Goblin. When the Goblin steals the reactor, it’ll start to fade again. We’ll use it to determine if we fixed the future or to see if any of our actions alter the future.”
"Edwards," Tony replied without beating an eye. He reached across Steve's chest and held out his hand to Peggy, stating, "Second Lieutenant Tony Edwards, ma'am."
Steve slowly closed the distance between them and sat beside his friend. They stared at each other and silence began to fester again.
So he turned to his pet project: recreating the super soldier serum. Over the years, he had dabbled with the same gamma-radiation that had perfected the boy. He had not been looking to create a Super Soldier from pregnancy this time however. He was trying to make one from a perfectly normal human, like himself (though Norman was in no way normal, his vast intellect put him way above the inane populace). He originally was going to test it on his son but his boy had no intelligence. It would have been wasteful on him.
He sat up sharply, gasping to air. Bucky, Sam, and Peter all leapt to their feet and surrounded his bedside in seconds. Peter lunged forward and embraced him. Steve returned the embrace with one arm and hissed when he went to move the other. He fell back onto the angled bed and saw his entire left side was bandaged.
Tony was called to testify before Steve. He kept up the lie of being with Steve for two years but everything else he told was the absolute truth. He testified to having carnal knowledge that Steve was only attracted to males and did so with such a lecherous grin that made it Steve blush. His lawyers asked him about their relationship and about Steve. Tony got a wistful expression on his face and he said, “Steve is the most caring and nicest person I know. He would never do this. He wouldn’t even
“He’s a busy guy, just like his dad,” Tony joked huskily, when he saw the image. Steve's eyes broke away from the images and he looked down to Tony. Tony tried to clear his throat but he couldn't stop the moisture in his eyes from gathering. He smiled reassuringly to his boyfriend and then purposely looked back to the wall. His eyes fell on another picture and he drew Steve’s attention to it.
Wanda scrambled to her feet with a pale parlor, gasping apologies and raised her hands to perform her magic but her entire body jerked as her eyes focused on something behind Wade. Raising her hands defensively she whispered, “
“I thought he’d stop once he got his soulmate but it looks like he isn’t done sleeping around. He probably is missing
Now that he was next to him, Steve could see the blood was from a rough split along Tony’s cheekbone. It was already swollen red and looked very painful. Steve could’ve knocked himself over the head for his assumption. Head wounds always bled badly.
Tony didn’t let himself dwell on it and got right down to business, stating, “Alright, any hypothesizes you can come up with to help?”
The suit began to close around Tony, but he gasped, “Wait!” The moving pieces froze and a shallowly panting Tony looked at each one of them, even Howard, and then gasped, “Thank you…I won’t forget this.”
Peter's arms snaked their way around his neck and held Wade firmly. Their eyes were still locked as Peter whispered, "I love your taco breath."
Wade continued to lean into Peter’s side but looked like he wanted to embrace him and never let go…it mirrored Tony’s own feelings.
The memories affected him so much that he could not eat any solid foods. They reminded Peter of the feedings and he retched up whatever it was he was trying to eat. He got most of his nutrition from IVs and soup. With time, he would probably be able to eat solid foods again but he doubted he would ever eat meat again.
“I can go three days without any sleep and can probably go longer if I continue not to do any strenuous labor,” Bucky stated without looking away from the screen.
Natasha glared accusingly at them and hissed, “What? Did you think the U.S.S.R. would be satisfied with one malfunctioning super soldier?” She motioned to Bucky then dropped her hand, clenching her fist at her side. She turned around so all they could see was her back. Her shoulders shook and Steve knew she was trying to compose herself.
Tony, Sam, and Rhodes had the prime spot on the couch to watch the event and they were all analyzing the android’s flight path and while drinking. Tony was enjoying a club soda while the other two were drinking beer.
Tony sat up, dragging Steve with him. Steve groaned but the weight of sleep was starting to release its pressure. He was waking up.
“I remember you telling me that I couldn’t have kids with a man,” Steve retorted dryly, making Bucky chuckle.
Logan smirked at the other mutant. The invitation said to not speak a word of it, even to whoever he chose to be his plus one.
Steve tensed and imagined dozens of scenarios of the meeting. In most, he saw Mary yelling horrible accusations at Steve in front of his son and them leaving with Peter never looking at him the same way again.
Steve raced to his son but as he did his eyes were drawn to the television where a circular hole was cratered the middle of the screen with minute fractures spreading out from it in a halo. His gut hallowed upon seeing it.
“You get him to the time machine and tell him I want him to do a few things for me. Firstly, I want him to live. He needs to fix his reactor and live to be a really old man. Secondly, he needs to be at city hall for the first gay marriage in New York for me and congratulate those fellas because I won’t be able to.”
Eddie was distracted by Venom as he imagined several tops for himself. Peter covered the watch with the sleeve of his shirt, feeling…strange. He trusted Eddie so his abnormal thoughts of pushing Eddie away weren’t…right. But, this was Venom. Venom was going to protect Peter’s identity. He
“Everyone is going so it might be odd if our newest member stays behind,” Steve stated. “But Jarvis…”
“I want to make love to you,” Steve whispered. His hand was still on Tony’s crotch and was slowly rubbing it. Steve’s body moved with his hand, like a wave being pulled by the tide…and apparently Tony’s dick was the moon.
He showed Steve to a small guest room and Steve fell unconscious as soon as he hit the mattress. The train was terribly uncomfortable and he was on alert for Hydra so he didn’t get much sleep.
“Why are you so perfect?” Wade whispered. Wade’s eyes were sparkling with love and Peter’s heart felt more fuller than it ever had in his life.
“Tell me, does it feel surreal? After living in the Avenger’s Tower for over a year, do you think you’ve adjusted yet?” Sophie, the TV host, asked with an excited smile.
Mary had found the metal object as she was reconstructing herself after being torn in two. She thought it scrap metal until she read Rogers’ name on it and realized it was his dog tag. She instantly recalled from her data that the boy wore always his father’s duplicate. Rogers’ dog tag was reportedly warped from a fight involving a lot of fire so this pristine tag had to be Peter’s. When Venom took him the dog tag was torn from him just like his clothes and would have probably been lost had Mary not found it.
“Yeah and your face is ugly,” Peter retorted instantly. He felt shocked by the words. Before Venom they had come to him so easily…he didn’t know he could still do it…
Steve flush grew deeper and he peered down at the counter. He thought back to the years he had known Tony and asked, “You always felt this way toward me?”
The second theory was what made him turn it off because it was that he was a wannabe celebrity. He said they purposely release his identity to get Peter thrown into the "it" scene. He said Peter wanted this and was enjoying it. He described Peter’s personality as being shallow and vain and started to cite examples and Peter turned off the video.
, Princess Glitter Fingers,” Wade laughed, smiling at the girl with what must had been a gross, bloody grin but his elation was so strong that he couldn’t help but smile.
Eventually, his friend came undone in his arms by their kisses and thrusts alone. Steve shuddered against him and came with a gasping moan. Tony pulled back with a pleased smirk as Steve slowly resurfaced. Glassy blue eyes focused on Tony and his blush returned.
Steve leaned heavily into Tony and he burrowed his face into the crook of his neck with a heavy sigh. Steve’s breath was hot against his skin and his head felt heavier than usual. Tony petted his hair for a few moments, trying to physically comfort his boyfriend the best he could, until he was suddenly inspired.
“Thanks for that,” Steve grumbled, turning back to him. He crossed the few steps that separated them and then wrapped his arms around his chest as he stared at Tony.
Steve heart twisted within his chest, wishing what Tony’s fevered mind believed to be true. He knew Tony had told the suit to stay in France until it was May, a few weeks away… As it was, he wouldn’t have been able to do it without risking the future.
Uncle Tony was a part of his family just as much as Pops was…Peter loved him, he would never deny that, Uncle Tony knew that…right? When Peter said he wanted his family, he meant adding his mother to it, not excluding Uncle Tony. Uncle Tony was a part of his family for as long as Peter could remember. The man raised him, helped him learn to read, and taught Peter the difference between a Phillips-head and a flathead screwdriver by the time he was three.
Howard put the core on the ground and began to curse under his breath as he lowered the sharp flame to it.
close to a smile. She so desperately wanted to see it again. He hadn’t smiled since before he “died” and she missed it dearly.
Tony’s hold on him tightened and Steve continued, “But, you can’t stay in that suit 24/7. You need to sleep in a bed, you need to eat, and you need to get some sun…and you need a bath.”
Steve had been embarrassingly apologetic and loving to his soulmate. Tony did not know why and did not take advantage but Steve remembered him whispering about teasing Steve later. They both cuddled in the back of the limo and were more touchy than they usually were.
“I have a feeling they’re no longer disbanded, J,” Tony said grimly. “And Steve was responsible for their party’s downfall. Fuck, find me the fastest route to Steve!”
“Get your shield now!” Tony exclaimed and he ran to the closet where he had a panel with an emergency suit.
Mary Parker was avoiding the others and was staring at Steve with a concentrated gaze. Why was she here? Had she volunteered to come too? Or –…his thoughts trailed to a stop as he noticed the small form Mary supported on her arm.
The Soldier clenched his fists but nodded all the same. He turned and leapt over the edge of the brownstone, disappearing from view. As soon as he was gone, Natasha leapt over the other side to where Steve was. She cursed lightly under her breath when she saw the crater in his chest and checked his pulse.
Bucky knew Steve was street smart but Steve also was willing to overlook certain things to see the good in people. Steve knew what it meant to be a fruit. He knew people thought it was wrong. But he was acting like it was something he could live with! Bucky studied him for a moment and realized Steve
Tony knew how Bucky was going to die. He must have known all along. Bucky had been his friend but he let him die.
Steve, the devil, was still drawing circles right over Tony's sensitive spot and he was using all of his willpower not to jump on Steve in front of Pepper. But, damn, his skin was tingling and heating up under Steve's fingertips.
I can't believe I was able to post this by Friday! The same day I posted the teaser for this chapter on my tumblr, my computer broke and I lost all the work I had done for this chapter and then some! I got a new computer and started working again and everything was working fine until I finished writing this chapter and Word randomly decided to not save the last three pages! GAH D:
“I’m sorry,” Bucky whispered. “I hated the guy but only because he had you. I would have never wished this on him…or you.”
The lawyers came in a few moments later. They welcomed them in a chorus of various greetings as they settled into the remaining
Pepper sighed heavily and sat beside him on the bench. She whispered fiercely, “Tony you can love. You have the biggest heart I know.” She lightly placed her hand on Tony’s chest, just above where his arc reactor was hidden beneath his dirty shirt, and whispered, “You love him. I can see it in your eyes whenever you look at him and I can see it in your eyes now… You desperately miss him.” She pressed her hand harder into his chest and she stated, “If you keep Steve at arm’s length, he’s going to eventually step back. He’s going to leave you. Do you want that?”
He did not move but his eyes slowly spanned the room and then focused back on her face. He asked, “Schmidt?”
. Right after Bucky’s death, he had fought the Red Skull, crashed the plane, woke in the future, and had been struggling to find a purpose until he found Tony. He never got a chance to mourn for him until…now.
He went deep into the warehouse in case someone ducked their head in to see why the alarm had gone off. There were rows and rows of shelving units and he chose one at random to go down. He kicked some boxes off the shelves and they mostly fell out together. One opened and spilled out its contents but Cable ignored it in order to lay the Captain on the row of relatively level boxes. Cable then reached into Cap’s pocket to pull out the folded-up photo.
“Oh Bucky, you did not have to!” Steve gasped. Bucky gone out for the first time last week by himself. Steve had assumed that he was ready but he must have gotten Peter something. It must have been nerve-wracking to him.
Wade smiled and his eyes crinkled with his joy as he murmured, “Alright, baby boy. Whatever you want…”
Steve was inside the house, standing in front of a closet door. Behind the closed door, he could hear sniffling.
Steve’s head shot up and he smiled as soon as he saw Tony. A light flush brought about by joy burnished Steve’s cheeks was instantly mirrored on Tony’s face. Bucky's little glib went unnoticed by the others but Bucky was now looking between the two of them particularly. Tony pretended not to notice.
He closed his eyes, thought of his collective family’s bravery, and tried to take as much courage as he could from that. He was the son of superheroes. He could do something as simple as saying “hello” to his mom.
He scooted back on the cot, making room for Steve and pulled on their connected hands, commanding, “Join me.”
Steve looked to Peter as Cable put his hand on his shoulder and didn’t look away as the time traveler stated, “It’s going to get bumpy.”
He recognized the large tunnel he lay in as being a part of the sewers Venom had dragged them through as they hunted. Overhead, a sewer grate cast light down on him and he could hear the hustle and bustle of a normal city day going on.
. Peter Parker,” Tony replied, suddenly feeling self-conscious. “What if we came out to the press and told the world you were my son?”
Natasha made no move to stop him. His brainwashing was so deep that he couldn’t help it even if he personally did not want to.
Tony shook his head and said, “She hates me. She shouldn’t hear it from me and you were unconscious so…She and Wade get along…and Wade volunteered to go tell her personally.” Steve looked to Queens and saw a red dot, indicating Wade’s location. Tony continued, “Friday will contact the authorities as soon as he reaches her…”
Natasha looked up to him, her eyes wet. He’d never seen her cry before and he cupped her face worriedly. She cupped his cheek too and whispered, “You promise we’ll be together until the end?”
They lightly kissed and Steve gently ran his fingers through Tony’s hair. As they pulled apart, Steve murmured, “This is your yearly reminder that I love you.”
“When did the Man of Iron become a father?” Thor asked excitedly and Tony made a noise that sounded like a combination of a groan and an over exaggerated sigh.
Behind him, he heard Tony’s espresso hit the ground and splash all over the floor. Steve spun around and his eyes focused on the back of Tony’s head. The other person in front of his boyfriend was shorter than him and pressed into Tony’s personal space, making him or her virtually impossible for Steve to see.
Tony covered his ears and groaned, “Please stop, Pep! It’s not like that! He’s my friend and nothing more!”
Steve allowed Tony’s lawyers to take control and trusted in their abilities. They were in there for a little over three hours, in which, the detectives asked him hundreds of questions and a good chunk of them were the same question repeated or asked a different way, which was: “Did you rape Susan Tyler?”
“Oh gay and narrow then! I don’t know! However else you would spin that!” Steve replied with a heavy sigh. To himself, he murmured, “Can never have a serious conversation with these two, they always find a way to twist my words…”
Natasha’s expression became solemn and she whispered, “I understand. I have the same relationship with my partner in SHIELD and everyone seems to think there’s something between us too.”
He glanced at Tony and knew the man had caught on to what Steve was implying by the way he flushed. Tony murmured, “
Dad would not let him go and he doubted any of the other Avengers would either. But…Peter gripped the dog-tag tightly – but there was still someone who might be willing to help…
Steve fixed Tony’s tie again and his fiancé quirked an eyebrow at him. Steve paused and placed his hand on Tony’s chest, over his heart. He admired the ring Tony gave him against the navy blue color of Tony’s tie. Steve owned the tiny piece of jewelry a little less than 24 hours and had been staring at it every chance he could but he still could not stop looking at it.
Steve looked over his shoulder, praying it was not Kilian. It was one of Tony’s suits. What he saw was actually a relief until he heard Tony.
Peter had excelled in nearly all forms of science but his heart was set on biological science and had been ever since he was a boy. With it, he wanted to make the world a better place. Originally, he had wanted to cure cancer, like his first father, Richard Parker, but, after becoming Spider-Man and fighting with the Avengers, Peter’s wants evolved.
“It’s simple!” Tony announced, waving his arms to garner both Pepper and Coulson’s attention. When their heads both snapped in his direction, he stated, “I don’t go.”
For the time being, the only room he and Peter used was Steve’s bedroom. Peter slept with Steve every night. Neither one of them were ready to let Peter sleep by himself yet.
“I feel dead,” Steve groaned. He only had cracked open his right eye, his left eye still inoperable, and peered at Tony. He had a glow around him from the fire burn all round him it reminded him of the religious paintings he studied in art school. He whispered, “You look like an angel.”
His target rubbed her throat with a wince and huskily replied, “I thought they did. They shot him in the base of his skull. But he’s a super soldier, he must have survived…”
The corporal saluted him and then reported, “Sir, the base is secure but you won’t believe what we found.”
Tony put down his food and slowly drew his foot up Steve’s thigh. The super soldier’s tired eyes widened and he sat up straighter. Tony grinned slyly at Steve and then stood as he said, “I’ve got to take a piss.”
When he learned Steve was going to be gone for a while he regarded Steve with a pout and commanded, “Don’ go.”
Pieces could be recovered but, he’d never be whole. From what he remembered, he loved her enough that he did not want her to be tied down to a fractured soulmate…it’d be too heartbreaking.
Howard’s eyes narrowed and he assessed Steve with an inquiring gaze. After a short pause, he said, “I haven’t said anything, but I’ve got eyes and ears. Let’s be frank, there’s something more than friendship or camaraderie going on between you and my son, isn’t there?”
“Steve,” Natasha broke him out of his morbid revelry with a hand to his shoulder. She had covered his six to Tony’s side and he did not even notice. Natasha continued, “I called in a SHIELD medic team, they’ll be here in a few minutes.”
“I think he might want to be with me too,” Tony replied hopefully and Pepper’s expression softened. She put down her papers and leaned forward, closer to the screen.
He turned around, holding their coffee cups, and nearly dropped them when he saw Steve laying on the bed. Tony hurriedly put the mugs on the counter and ran over to Steve, gasping, “
“Jarvis, we need subtitles!” Tony hissed and everyone leaned forward, even Bruce, who looked quite sheepish as he did it.
The Russian’s eyes widened and he pulled a small tube out of his pocket and held it up to Steve’s eyes, flashing a bright light into his vision. He murmured, “Can you tell me where we are?”
“If he was fine with calling you Pops, I think he'll be fine with having you officially becoming one of his dads,” Tony replied.
As soon as Happy was out of sight, Peter pounced onto Wade’s lap. He grinned wiley at his boyfriend and Wade’s smile mirrored his. Wade’s hands clasped his thighs and he began to rub them. His thumbs grew close to his crotch with every pass. Peter surged into his touch and caught Wade’s startled gasp with his mouth.
The two had instantly connected and Peter felt comfortable enough to remove his mask in front of the other man within the hour.
Sudden understanding washed over him and Steve lightly nudged his husband’s arm with the back of his fist to comfort him slightly without Peter’s notice. When Steve and Tony got married, Tony signed adoption papers in addition to their marriage license. In the eyes of the law, he was Peter’s father but to Peter he was still “Uncle Tony.” Tony had helped Steve raise Peter over the years and was as much Peter’s father as Steve was but Tony had only been his adoptive father almost a year and his son still did not see Tony any differently.
“What do you mean?” Steve murmured, his heart already feeling heavy from all of Bucky’s observations. He fell into the wooden door at Bucky’s side and faced the same direction as him so he wouldn’t have to meet his friend’s piercing gaze anymore. He and Tony could never be permanent…but they could share something – a small something, but something nonetheless.
Steve dug his fingers deep into Tony's flesh, pulling them flush together, as he stated, “But this…I don’t need to adjust to this. We’re back together like nothing happened.”
The team looked at him like he was insane but listened and back away. Tony had to be pulled back by Steve but he moved back without much fuss but never tore his gaze from Peter. Steve ordered the rest of the team away. They listened grudgingly though all of them looked like they were ready to fight Venom…to fight Peter.
He opened the files he made himself not too long ago. He had nothing to remember his time in the past but there were old photos of Steve and Bucky and the rest of the team archived. He had saved some of his favorites to his personal files. Most of were of Steve but there were quite a few of the others as well. Steve and Bucky took most of their photos together.
“Ten feet behind you,” Jarvis replied. “If you cannot compress it then another option is to sear it shut.”
The audience applauded and screamed and Tony felt his excitement double with the audience’s jubilation. Tony and Steve traded happy glances and then Tony continued, “Yesterday, I proposed to this handsome man and he said, yes.”
Steve stopped listening to the detective’s testimony at that point and instead focused on his own breathing. It was a meditative technique he had learned from Bruce. Steve ironically wondered if he and Bruce were doing the exercises together in separate rooms.
“Shit,” Peter cursed, finally recognizing its voice and now noticing a familiarity to its build. It was fucking Ultron.
“No,” his mate replied smartly. He grinned at Steve and happily sang, “Oh knee! Oh knee, oh knee, oh knee.”
“Do monkeys even make out?” Peter teased, wrapping his arms behind Wade’s neck. The flowers brushed against the side of Wade’s face, drawing out the joy in his smile.
Most nights, the dreamscape was created by Tony, depicting a landscape he craved. Mostly, it was ocean scenery or of his own home in Malibu.
They were both backed into a corner with Iron Man and the Falcon hovering overhead and the Winter Soldier and the Black Widow standing in front of them with guns trained on them.
Wade’s entire body sizzled with the words and his hands grabbed onto Peter’s upper thighs like he was preventing him from flying away or changing his mind. Peter’s fingers trailed back to his chest and followed the channels of his muscles. Wade wanted to physically reciprocate but he didn’t want to deter Peter, who looked like he wanted to say more on the subject.
The entire plane was coated with ice and snow just like the cockpit. It was quiet and his footsteps reverberated through the body of the aircraft like loud drumbeats. Within the main body, the smaller planes and their bombs which were going to be used to destroy major American cities were also frozen over, most were on their sides and had broken open. They were burned black by fires long ago burnt out. Enough time had passed that the smoke no longer lingered and ice had slicked over the metal that had melted.
His first thoughts were of palladium poisoning. The box was made of the same material that used to hold the old chips that used to burn up in Tony’s reactor. It was big enough to hold at least three and fit in Tony’s pocket. Had he been carrying them around like a pillbox? After all these years, could his new reactor be poisoning him now too?
Steve went to the kitchen and straight to the pantry. He pulled the Animal Crackers from their usual spot and returned to Peter. Peter sat on the blanket and was trying to get the action figure to sit too.
They had to run to the car and Tony pressed their driver to speed. The rest of the team had already driven ahead to get to the court in time so they were alone in the back for once. The spontaneously pressed into each other as soon as the vehicle started to move and wrapped their arms around each other. Steve’s chest felt bulbous with a happy warmth and he couldn’t stop smiling.
They shared a pot of coffee and laughter together and, by the way they looked at each other, no one would have questioned the validity of their relationship.
. He thought instantly. If Tony was kindhearted to him he knew he would break. He did not want that to happen. It would be so humiliating. He had just met Tony Stark, he was practically a stranger to him.
He helped his friend with his usual missives as leader of the Howling Commandos and worked with Peggy in Steve’s stead to figure out the best route for the Commandos to use when in Switzerland.
“This is so cruel!” Tony hissed and then hissed again when Steve experimentally licked his nipple. Steve glanced up at him questionably and Tony growled, “It’s crueler to stop!” Steve grinned and sucked his nipple into his mouth.
He added another finger, making Steve’s breath hitch. His hooded gaze met Tony’s eyes and he hissed, “We are
He held onto Bucky until the man fell asleep. Peter also began to nod off. They both were probably awake all night worrying over Steve.
Howard’s grip on the clipboard became white and Bucky grasped Steve’s arm and tried again, “Steve, the future –!”
“I’ve loved you for years,” Tony whispered. “But you never noticed…and I thought if I threw myself into other relationships…I would stop loving you but…but I can’t. What happened with Francesca proves it! I wasn’t upset that she cheated on me! I was actually relieved! Our relationship was based on lust…not like our relationship…”
Tony grinded onto Steve, following the beat to the music and humped his hips into Steve’s leg. He dug his hands into Steve’s hips and, being the quick learner that he was, Steve grabbed Tony’s torso and pulled Tony’s body to meet his in his own gyrations.
Peter put down his phone with a smile and then rolled onto his back to stare up at his ceiling. He thought back to the prior night and the kisses they shared. He lightly touched his lips as he remembered the soft feel of Wade’s. He thought he would feel weird about kissing Wade, he was a man after all, but…the thought hadn’t even crossed his mind in the moment. Peter wanted to kiss him again and he wanted to do it properly, with no masks, but he didn’t know how he was going to do that without bringing him to the Tower and he didn’t think he was ready to reveal to the team, nonetheless his father, that he was dating the infamous Merc with a Mouth.
They were at war. Why would his country deploy half of its army for one measly soldier? This man didn’t know he was Captain America…right?
“This is all my fault,” his dad reasoned. “I’m just trying to help you the best I can. But…well, Steve says I can be
Steve jumped slightly from the sudden exclamation. Tony dropped his hand and his eyes latched onto Steve’s focus.
“The rest of the Avengers will be here in a few minutes and I don’t think Iron Man or Captain America would like to see you breathing the same air as their son nonetheless within arm’s length of him. Just go, Brock,” Wade snapped. “Peter will be out soon. We don’t need your help.”
Tony walked ahead of Steve and kicked a piece of rubble out of his path as he surveilled the damage that was done. He sighed heavily and dropped his head. Steve went up to him from behind and wound his arms around Tony. Steve had ripped off Tony's helmet earlier but Tony still wore his thick armor and he leaned back into Steve, making him use more of his strength than usual to help support him.
“General!” Steve yelled, diverting Ross’s attention from Peter. “You have to get past me to get to my son!”
Tony was insanely jealous but, at the same time, he was worried. Steve never knew the other side to the paparazzi. He saw them as
“Oh God, yes,” Tony gasped, interrupting him. Tony thrust his hips against Steve, pressing his own erection into Steve’s ass.
Luckily, there was another explosion and they both clutched each other to protect themselves again. Tony stopped moving and hopefully assumed Steve had commanded him to stop because of Hydra. As it was, Steve tried to keep his mind on the battle to keep his body from reacting to Tony’s anymore.
The statue stood fifteen feet high and was of Steve in full Cap regalia. He had one hand rested on his infamous shield, which was imbedded in the ground in front of him, and his other hand was pointed toward the distant Atlantic, his final resting place. The statue’s gaze was serious, and its jaws clenched as if he saw something dangerous on the distant horizon.
“No! I’m the real one! It’s me! It’s me, I’m Steve!” The imposter, who could have been his identical twin, gasped with Steve’s voice. The man looked just like Steve. He had Steve’s uniform, shield, and even the same dimples which Tony gushed over. Was the imposter a clone?
Steve met his eyes and his bottom lip wobbled a little and his eyes were red and glassy with unshed tears but he smiled so brightly at Tony that he felt like he was nearly knock off his feet. He’d never smiled at Tony like that before and the term “breathless” suddenly came to mind because that was what Tony felt when he saw Steve’s unabashed joy.
They were uncovering the motherload of all coverups. The Winter Solider was only a tiny, tiny piece of the pie.
His hand shot away from the comforter and he internally flinched away from the train of thought. If he never let Bucky do those things to him in the first place this would have never happened! Tony would still be alive!
Tony quirked an eyebrow at the hologram of Fury and then crossed his arms over his chest before he countered, “More serious than me helping my friend heal?”
Reflecting, he realized he had and murmured, “I didn’t mean to…” He paused as he reassessed his dream.
“I do not know what you are referring to…” Iron Man retorted, “The files in my memory are spotted, but the last thing I am able to access was leaving this very base in a convoy. I do not know how I came back to this location or how you progressed into this condition without my noticing.”
“Baby, no!” Steve gasped, desperately cupping the side of Tony’s face. “Please, sweetie, hold on! We have a date remember! And - And we're going to get married! Adopt Peter! Grow old together! Please, hold on!”
They had kissed before but this was different. This wasn’t brought about by lust but by their hearts. Steve’s heart was so full of wonder and joy that it made him want to kiss Tony. Even the kiss was different. Their lips were gentle as they brushed together in a soft caress and they held each other like they were made of glass.
“You probably won’t get in too much trouble if you join me on the bed,” Tony said, patting the spot beside him. “We can argue I cannot sleep without my super soldier and I doubt no nurse or doctor would dare ask you of all people to leave, you are Captain America after all.”
She had tried to hail both Steve and Tony but neither were answering their comms. The hour deadline had long passed and SHIELD was not answering their hails for help either. Something big was happening at HQ. They had gotten a few calls of distress and then nothing, just radio silence.
“N-no,” Steve gasped. He lost his ability to breathe properly as Tony’s fingers crawled over his crotch. He bit down on his lip and threw back his head. Steve gasped, “Pants are too tight…”
Tony grumbled to the nanorobots to go away and then he pressed his flesh cheek into Steve’s gloved hand and assured him, “I’m fine, Beloved…”
Steve nodded unable to voice his goodbyes. The rest of the team followed her lead and all stood together and presented Steve with saddened but honorable looks then quickly left before Venom was totally able to regain control.
“Being superheroes is not just about saving the world. It is also about sacrifice,” Tony whispered. “You don’t have to do this. You can go back to being an ordinary kid.”
“We’ll get you set up in the medical wing at the base and I’ll have access to more supplies. I might be able to find something more to help you,” Gabe said.
Tony parked ahead of him in a pull-off for tourists to park and take pictures of the ocean. No one was there so Tony found it to be the perfect place to confront the Enigma.
Just a few minutes ago, Logan had two katanas skewering him and Wade was gutted. The madman had finally stopped making bowties with his own intestines and shoved them back inside him. He was holding his belly with both hands to keep his insides from falling out as his skin knitted itself together.
“Okay, we’ll even make popcorn,” Tony replied. But his attention was already being averted. He opened up the security feed for their quarters on Earth and watched with wide eyes as their younger selves peered at their collage of family pictures.
It felt like ages since he last kissed Steve in bed. The normalcy from it felt near orgasmic and he moaned into Steve’s mouth. He pressed his mouth harder into the other’s, wanting more but Steve broke it with a smirk. He whispered, “Your son and probable future son-in-law are in the room right now, Honey.”
“Now that he’s alone you can properly apologize,” Peggy stated smartly,pulling him off to the side to make their conversation more private.
“What are you doing?” Steve asked. His heart was racing at a quicker pace from Tony’s sudden move. He had expected his friend to sulk.
For a moment, he saw a flicker of hesitation within Tony. Tony’s gaze fell to his soul implant. The sleeves of his shirt were drawn back and the implant was just peeking out. He contemplatively ran his finger over the blank surface of his implant, not meeting Steve’s eyes. Tony clasped his hand over the implant, obliterating it from sight, and murmured, “I’ve waited decades for this day…and now that I have you…I’m
Bucky froze in place and his cursing came to an immediate stop as the projection expanded to accompany the new figure into the memory.
Tony was leaning against his folded arm and running his fingers down Steve’s side. With half lidded eyes and a small, lazy smile gracing his lips. Tony did not notice Steve was awake as he watched his own fingers as they trailed patterns down Steve's side.
Steve bust out laughing but Tony ignored him in favor of cooing to their son about how handsome he’d look.
“I never noticed before, but you look a lot like him. You should grow out some facial hair. You’d be a dead ringer.”
“I need to go, Dad,” Peter stated. He pushed himself up and he reasoned, “If you can go with broken bones then I can go too.”
“You promised me that there was nothing between you. You said we were going to be together,” Tony whispered into the speaker, his voice to low Steve almost could not make it out.
A muscle ticked in his jaw and he glared at her. She raised her eyebrows and held out her hand. Her other hand tightened on the edge of the roof as she prepared herself for the moment she would need to push herself away. She hoped her outlandish theory was right and that the Soldier had been waiting for her because, if she was wrong, then she was dead.
“Captain Steven G. Rogers,” she admonished. “I thought the word ‘can’t’ was not a part of your vocabulary.”
The rest of its body opened and the human stepped out. Steve watched the entire process, dumbstruck. The man rubbed at his flattened, dirty hair until it unruffled. His entire body was grimy like he hadn’t washed in days and he was barefoot wearing only old jeans and a thin undershirt.
He was engulfed in a hug and he only needed to see that red hair to know who held him. His arms snapped around her and he buried his face in her hair and he just cried. He missed her so much and he had needed her in his grief and now here she finally was.
“Steve,” Tony repeated and his insides did a little flip. He was now on a first name basis with the Captain America. His inner child was about to faint.
“What the hell??” Tony hissed, jumping in alarm. He grabbed onto Steve’s bicep with both hands. Tony was already on edge about traveling through time
The source of the problem was found, an hour later, in an USB embedded into one of the secretaries’ computers at the front desk. It had leaked a virus into the Tower’s system that rebooted the Tower’s AI every five minutes. Tower-Jarvis tried to rebuild its systems every time but it took too long and by the time the five minutes were up, Jarvis was unable to send out a distress signal and was rebooted again. Power was lost to the Tower without Jarvis’s direction, as were the security systems and all the camera footage. The Jarvis unit in Tony’s suit received no distress signal so thought nothing was wrong and the virus projected a signal, mimicking an active Tower-Jarvis. The Suit-Jarvis thought nothing was wrong so gave no warnings to Tony.
“We were together, Steve,” Bucky murmured. “It was her kiss I was comparing yours to. I loved her and I did not get the chance to fall out of love like all the others…like with you…They wiped my mind and froze me before I could even fathom it, not that I wanted to fathom it…We were happy together. I was the Soldier and for the first time as that monster I saw a future that was not covered in blood…I just don’t understand, why she is so upset…I don’t think I did anything wrong…I mean I had no choice whenever I was frozen or my mind was wiped…I don’t understand why she is so angry.” He hesitantly explained at first but the words seemed to come out faster as more came out. He griped his head tightly with his metal hand and hissed, “I wish I can remember everything.”
My brother and I are doing well, and I should be able to start posting regularly again. Thank you for your patience! Now enjoy the new chapter! :)
“I’ve forgiven you, you stupid bag of bolts,” Tony stated. Steve reached under the table and grasped Tony’s hand. Tony grasped it in return and smiled warmly at him. Steve or Tony did not need to say anything. With their eyes they silently reaffirmed their love. Steve still felt guilty about it but, to Tony, it was all in the past.
Wade sighed heavily and embraced Peter tightly, drawing him closer to him. when Peter began to cry, he did not draw attention to it and lightly ran his hands through Peter’s hair, constantly whispering, “
Five days later, Steve was probably an expert in the history between his and Tony’s eras and also proficient in Norman Osborn.
Closer, Tony could see Steve’s entire body was tense and his hands were strangling the blanket with a white knuckle grip.
The older man lightly touched Peter’s face which was so tightly pinched that it was beginning to turn red. Peter leaned into his touch and relaxed his muscles, releasing his tears. He hiccupped as the salty water flowed from his eyes.
He stumbled to his feet, his footing uneven because of his broken leg and the fact that his boots were beginning to melt. He charged forward, leaning forward so momentum would lead him other than his legs. His steps were wild and he faltered several times as his leg collapsed and broke more but he did not stop until he felt cool air. It took him only a few seconds to escape but it felt like a lifetime.
He and Harry got into one of their usual competitive banters and whatever tensions there were between them vanished.
“Then it’s a date,” Wade replied. “…But now I will have to do some crazy cleaning and remodeling before you get here…”
“Come to my lab,” Bruce whispered. Steve nodded and carefully slipped out of Tony’s arms, making sure not to wake him. He paused to pull a blanket off the back off the couch and draped it over him. Steve lightly kissed his forehead before following Bruce out.
Steve breathlessly followed but Tony broke their kiss and whispered, “But if I survive this, and you’ll be damn sure I will fight my way out with my every breath, you can’t push me away again, promise me this, please?”
Steve cupped both of Peter’s cheeks and kissed his forehead. Hulk cautiously drew back and let go of Venom. Venom did not move but neither did Peter. It seemed Venom only freed him to speak.
Peter rolled Wade’s mask up and Wade continued to caress him as he did. He was smiling and looked happy despite the fact that half of his face was still hidden to Peter. Peter stood on the tips of his toes to reach the taller man and Wade’s smile grew brighter as Peter kissed him.
Steve stood to look at the scans closely and then turned back around mirroring the bewildered expression on Tony’s face.
Tony’s body was overtaxed by the emotional bout and he fell back asleep in minutes. Steve spent the remaining time staring at him, trying to ingrain his façade into his mind’s eye so he could take the visage of Tony with him at least…
Eddie took a long drink from his water and Peter took a quick initial sip and then ran his fingertips around the rim of the glass.
“If you are going to fight with us then you need to learn to work with us! You almost killed Clint!” Steve yelled.
Sneaky raised his hands and did something weird with his fingers, creating a V from the space between his middle and ring fingers. The robot sarcastically intoned with a flat voice, “I come in peace.”
“S-Sorry,” Steve replied with a flush. He scrambled to his feet and hurriedly tied his knapsack back on. His stomach growled like an angry, caged wolf and Steve’s flush deepened.
He found Steve first by following his nose. The super soldier was preparing their meal in the kitchen. It was going to be a simple meal, cooked mainly on the grill outside. They were going to have hot dogs, grilled corn on the cob, and vegetables.
“No, let me finish,” Bucky hissed, his voice full of raw emotion. Steve snapped his mouth shut and silently waited. His heart was beginning to beat faster and he became acutely aware of his hand in Bucky’s grasp. Bucky sighed and whispered, “I never felt that way toward anyone before but, from what I remember, I did not peg you for a fruit… so I did not act on my feelings.” Bucky scrunched his face and asked hopefully, “Did we ever…give it a shot?”
“How?” Wade chuckled, “Well when two boys, who like each other very much, get some lube and naked, they fuck each other like wild –.”
Jarvis displayed them without his having to answer. Images were projected from one of Jarvis’s cameras on to the wall opposite where they were sitting. All of the images were from the graduation and all of them centered on a single person. Tony gripped Steve’s hand harder as he saw his son for the first time in his life. He was pale and lanky like Tony and had Tony’s dark hair and Tony’s hazel eyes and Tony’s sly grin.
He had to stop him. He would not let them take control again. He charged Natasha and ripped the gun from her hands and then leapt into the hallway before she could stop him.
Bruce explained, “It happened last night. SHIELD sent me footage maybe an hour ago.” He opened another tab and a black rectangular box appeared with the sideways triangular symbol for play waiting to be pressed. Bruce pressed it without pause.
“I’ve got a year…probably less if I keep using my suit,” Tony explained, his voice sounding far away. He touched his reactor and ironically said, “The very thing that’s keeping me alive is killing me…”
All thoughts about the frequency faded as Tony looked down at his son and heard the ingrained upset in his voice. The walls Tony had been building ever since he woke crumbled upon the single word his son muttered. Tears collected in his eyes and he gathered Peter in his arms. Peter had a similar reaction and began to weep as soon as Tony collected him in his embrace.
“Dad and I are going to go to Uncle Bruce now. Are you alright staying with Uncle Clint?” Peter nodded sullenly and Steve ran his hand through his hair. He murmured, “I promise Peter, it will be soon…” He and Tony stepped back into the elevator.
“We got information that he was hiding in Switzerland,” Steve confirmed, turning slightly on the cot to face him.
Bucky’s eyes became glassy as his gaze turned inward and he said, “Just yesterday, I remember shooting a man in front of his daughter then I waited for the mother to come home and shot her as well. I left the little girl there, alive and sitting in her parents’ blood.” Bucky paused as pain flashed through his eyes and he whispered, “Sometimes I slip back into him. I become the Soldier and lose all my emotions...I lose my soul. It can happen without warning, like today… I-I did not mean to hurt you.”
“…Jarvis,” Tony whispered, his voice hoarse and barely distinguishable. Tears started to leak from his sealed eyes and began to run down his cheeks but he refused to open his eyes to make his crying easier. The tears was going to damage some of the circuitry in his mask but he did not care in the slightest. Tony gasped, “Bruce’s experiments showed that the symbiote could not stand heat…H-How hot did it get until it jumped off Steve? …Can my repulsors handle it?”
Tony took a quick shower and swallowed a mouthful of coffee before he followed Steve out into the city.
Peter looked for the faces of his Pops and Dad in the reflection but they were not proudly standing behind him like he had always imagined.
“Th-Then yes,” Steve gasped. The words were heavy and hard to push after so many years of rebuffing them. Yet as the words came out, they would not stop. It felt amazing. He stated, “Yes, please…A dinner date. Yes, I want it.”
Tony bent down and took all of Steve into his mouth in one gulp drawing a strangled cry from Steve’s throat and his hands dug into Tony’s scalp.
Steve could not help but fear that May and Ben Parker would fight for custody of Peter. Merely living with Steve was putting him in a dangerous environment. Any court of law would see that and grant custody to the safer family member. The Parkers may not be related to Peter via blood but they were related through marriage they technically were Peter's closest relatives after Steve.
Bruce nodded and closed the hologram. He turned to Scott and Scott got to his feet stating, “I’ll get it. You got medical covered?”
“Used Cable’s Time Glove and grabbed the half-naked, 2009 version of me and Steve and brought them to our era?” Tony guessed.
The week went by quickly as Steve was immersed in studies on how to adapt to the new century. Unsurprisingly, his studies focused on America’s military history and the new technological advancements.
“Yes!” He gasped and hugged both his uncle and pops as he bounced on his feet. He squeezed Pops with all his strength, not needing to hold back, and his pops picked him up. Kicking his feet wildly with his unbridled energy Peter leaned forward in his father’s hold and asked, “What’s she like?”
His suspicions were confirmed when Coulson wanted to know how Tony found out about the soldier in the first place and demanded that he tell him if Tony was targeted. After some teasing, Tony assured Coulson that he wasn’t next on the Winter Soldier’s hit list but was doing research on the differences between timelines.
She hadn’t been on the phone but had been talking to Bucky and she continued, not noticing Tony at first, “–better yet, it’s a really tough material, like military grade tough. So you’ll have to work hard to rip it.” She spotted Tony gaping at them and said, “Good news! I got Bucky more clothes!”
“Jarvis said you ordered it last night. Apparently, there are new clothes in here for Bucky, which, by the way, is clearly not enough for a proper wardrobe if it can all fit in this box!”
Tony gulped and focused his eyes on Steve’s right shoulder. The smooth skin and muscle made his cock twitch. Lovely, a hard-on will definitely cajole Steve right now. Steve’s own dick was flaccid and any form of sex was probably the furthest thing from his mind.
Steve stared at Tony, waiting to hear him chuckle at his inane joke but he didn’t. He really could do it. He really could help Steve.
"...No, I wasn't lying about that," Tony replied. Despite the situation, a smile tugged at his lips for Bucky's obsession with his hair.
Steve typed out the text and, when the reply came in, he grimly turned the phone to Clint, showing him a photo. Tony caught a glimpse of it and felt his stomach churn. Clint’s son and daughter were tied up and gagged and obviously crying in the photo.
Coulson looked over the names with a pinched brow and then demanded, “How did you get these names?? These are government agents whose names are –.”
Tony called the rest of the Avengers back to the Tower and they hunkered down in the community room. Unsurprisingly, none of them elected to turn on the television.
“Hey, guys!” Steve and Tony both turned to the sound of Natasha’s voice but kept their arms wrapped around each other.
“Shut up,” Peter said, elbowing him embarrassedly. “My dad wants me back by midnight, I have to go back to the Tower soon…”
He was so quiet. Tony felt unnerved by a quiet Bucky…but, then again, with everything he had been through, he was lucky Bucky was even able to function.
Peter really only noticed the difference when he left their workstation to collect materials. The others openly stared at him, making Peter feel like he was being singled out and examined like one of the samples he would stare at on his petri dish.
“Stop,” Peter whispered. His smile grew larger but the light chuckle that ran through him was painful. Peter grinned through it all and roughly teased, “You’re making me blush…”
They parked behind the stage and had yet to be noted by anyone. Steve looked outside the tinted windows and thought back fondly on the fake name Tony had created for him. He could have lived out a quiet life, gone to art school, and sketched for the rest of his days.
“I’d do it all again,” Steve replied, wishing they were close enough that he could reach out and touch him. He still half believed this was a dream and wouldn’t fully believe he was there until he touched him.
Mary was waiting for them on the same stool she sat on as she sat on as she spoke with Ben. She was wearing the same lab coat and was frowning as soon as they walked in.
Bucky smiled like Steve had never seen before, so full of hope and excitement. Natasha had not called him boss in such a long time Steve had wondered if he had ever really heard it. Bucky reacted like it was more than a term of endearment. He quickly took Peter’s spot and his son sat on the edge of the mat, watching his aunt and uncle with a serious focus.
When the horn sounded for the morning's first watch, Steve knew he couldn't let Tony sleep anymore. They only had so long until Colonel Phillips called everyone out and Steve would be expected at the head of the charge.
Steve nodded and rubbed Peter’s shoulder, murmuring, “We knew it would happen. We just didn’t know exactly when.”
“We don’t have to worry about Stark until he needs the reactor. The Goblin is a twisted fuck which is why he went back to the future with the reactor. He probably wanted you and Peter to watch while Stark begged for his life or just for you two to see him die. He
Thor sat outside, in the pouring rain created by his turbulent emotions. Lightening flashed and seemed to be attracted to his hammer as it almost always hit it. The thunder roared and made loose, lightweight objects in the room vibrate.
Her face was blank but her eyes were calculating. Finally, she stated, “Stark did not keep Peter longer just to talk.”
All of the blood in Steve’s body torpedoed to his cock and he nervously gulped. Tony’s eyes flashed with hot desire and he bit down on his bottom lip.
Steve response was to smile with a large and genuine grin. The man was an open book to Tony and he could tell the super soldier found absolute pleasure in providing for him.
“Going-Going-Go-,” Tony was cut off with a grunt. The house collapsed further and loud bangs and explosions sounded over the phone’s speakers. Tony grunted, yelped, and then moaned painfully.
Tony threw himself into expanding his father’s business of making weapons as an additional distractor. This, combined with his affairs and other vices, made the public’s view of him change. He was no longer seen as the amazing man who brought soulmates together. He was gaining a reputation of being a playboy, a drunk, and a war monger and Tony did not care.
“Grab a plate and bring it outside,” Steve replied picking up two large plates of hot dogs. Peter picked up a huge platter of corn on the cob and then nodded to the plate of sliced up peppers, onions, and whatnot for Wade to pick up. Wade did just that and followed his boyfriend out in a sort of daze.
He put on brave airs, but he was still scared. He still wasn’t ready for this. He still wanted to live. He wanted Tony. He wanted to be with Tony right now so badly.
different. Wade leaned into it sucking on Peter’s bottom lip and then moving to his top while their tongues met in the changeover. They both grinned and Peter whispered, “Let’s go before somebody sees us.”
Steve raised his hand for everyone to silently stop. Natasha came close to his back and he heard the light click of her safety being clicked off.
The port’s busy summer months had come to a close and August was ushering in the beginning of fall and the eventual total freeze of winter. Everyday Coulson got a little closer to the Captain but the retracing of his footsteps was slow and they were still weeks behind him.
He shifted in his bed, wanting to doze a little longer. The fact that he could hear birds and that he was laying on the same pillow he used since a kid told him he was at his Aunt May’s. Soon, he’d hear her moving in the kitchen and preparing breakfast for the both of them.
Tony studied Steve. He truly did appear worried. What did he think would happen? It wasn’t like it was…
His legs shook and he fell to his knees. His anger gave way to despair again and he pressed his face into the coffin, begging, “Wake me up, Steve.
Tony was thinking about wanting to ingrain the image in his mind forever when he thought of his phone. Tony stopped breathing for just a second and then slowly pulled out of Steve’s arms just enough to reach for his phone sitting on the bedside table.
Wade’s heart seized in his chest at the mention of “love” passing through Peter’s lips and then Peter flushed bright red as he realized what was said between their exchange. Neither one of them addressed Logan's statement about their "love" yesterday. Wade pressed his forehead to Peter's and searched his eyes, fearfully wondering what was hidden within those hazel depths.
Tony ran the back of his fingers over Steve’s cheek and said, “We should go inside…You need to get cleaned up and I will make us some coffee and see what the vultures said about your little jog…then maybe we can find a nice couch to sit on and talk about stuff.”
Steve smiled at Tony and cautiously stepped up to him and slyly teased, “It seems you are more of the stalker here.”
“Our son,” Steve reminded him as he also patted down Tony’s suit. Tony’s hands stilled against him then he smiled warmly at Steve.
He was shaking slightly so Tony knew the super solider needed a moment to regain his composure. He wound his arms around Steve and rested his head on top of his. He closed his eyes and was forced to consider the other implications the palladium poisoning meant, namely what it meant for his future.
“When Osborn crushed the reactor, he destroyed the only thing that had saved Stark’s life all those years ago and unraveled everything Stark had done…He’s created a paradox that very well may unravel time as we know it.” Cable stated. “Which is why we’re going back to fix it.”
“We do not have a relationship like that, Tony,” Steve whispered, stepping back. Tony moved with him, never letting any distance come between them.
Tony smirked and crooked an eyebrow as he bantered, “I think I got that vibe after I caught you checking out my ass for the second time.”
Still smiling to himself, Peter snuggled back into Wade's embrace. With his face inches from Wade's, and their noses just barely touching. Peter gently traced the side of Wade’s face with his finger, feeling out the shape of his jaw under the rough, pitted skin. He stared into Wade’s relaxed and closed eyes and felt blessed by the fact that he was one of the rare few who got to see him like this.
Steve scowled and stared into Coulson’s unflinching eyes. Steve saw he was resolute in his declaration. Steve thrust his shield into the wooden desk, skewering it into the furniture.
“…Then we will face that hurdle when it is presented to us,” Steve whispered, not knowing how else to answer.
He grasped Tony’s cock and jerked him off in time with his thrusts, making his soulmate unravel quickly. Steve let himself give over to the pleasure so he could come with Tony and then he collapsed beside his soulmate, turning so he’d be facing him. Tony turned to him and Steve reached out and touched the strange mark again. Tony looked down and Steve said, “It’s coming from your reactor. Is it an infection?”
The figure jerked and Tony could have sworn he saw a flash of red in one of the bulky man’s eyes. But Tony’s vision was fading and Pepper was calling out to him, her voice a distant echo. He knew he was about to pass out so he gasped, “Is he –?”
A little life returned to Bucky’s face. He was clearly eager for the arm. Bucky got to his feet, but Tony waved for him to sit down and said, “It’ll be easier for me to put this on you if you’re not towering over me.”
Peter smirked and took a sip of his coffee. The coffee slid down his throat, leaving behind its rich, bitter taste and Peter lingered on the taste as he ran over what he wanted to talk about. The Captain’s last comment was encouraging. He was happy to see he was not a stickler and had some humor. He also didn't seem to hold a grudge even though Peter had made him upset with his prior phone call.
“I’m liking you already, Wade,” MJ said, leaning back into the couch and poking Wade’s legs with her knees. Her expression lost its teasing tilt and softened as she asked, “But seriously, tell me about you two. I want to know everything about the guy who my best friend literally can’t let go of.”
“Uh, hi?” Peter replied. He glanced nervously over his shoulder and asked, “Should I be concealing my identity too?”
They ignored him and Steve yelled, “You believed her too! And you let Peter go to her during the battle even though we both were suspicious!”
Steve seemingly forgot that they were ‘dancing’ and pressed Tony into the nearest wall, pushed his mouth to his, and plunged his tongue down Tony’s throat. Tony groaned and wrapped his limbs around Steve to draw him closer.
“The future is falling into place,” Tony stated, staring blankly at Steve’s neck. “And he had listed off several more weird sounding enemies…they better not mess with my tower…what do you think about improving the defense systems to this place. How extreme is too extreme?” His gaze finally flickered up to Steve’s and he quirked an eyebrow at him.
The door sealed and the elevator began to move to the team locker room just above Bruce and Tony’s labs.
Days since his waking, when the Americans finally arrived, it was almost like someone had declared it was the Fourth of July. The entire camp was bustling and everyone wanted to watch the ‘Sno-Cat’ as it approached, kicking up mounds of dirt and snow. The Sno-Cat was a dark orange vehicle with the same tracks as a tank and a huge, bulky, square body on top.
They dropped the subject. They soon lapsed into talking about nothing important and were only talking to talk. It was subdued and sometimes forced. They both felt the need to fill the oppressive silence.
Wade’s curiosity died with the first thrust of Peter’s hips. Any suspicions that may have developed were obliterated with the strength of their combined lusts.
[NooOOOooo!! We could have gotten into his pants! We could have sucked on his tarantula ginormous dick and made him come all over us!]
“Master Barton is following protocol and is bringing him down to the sublevels,” Jarvis replied. “The tower’s outer defense system has kept them out of the building so far.”
Wade hovered in the background. He didn't belong with the Avengers. No one spoke to him and he didn't think a few even noticed he was there. He wasn't one of them but Peter was so all of the Avengers had assembled.
Playing along with Tony, Steve stated, “I advise you to go all in on this investment, Mr. Stark. I hear Rogers is a sure thing!”
“Yeah, about that, you’re from the future!” Bucky stated, turning it around to that glaringly obvious fact. “And a light bulb is in your chest keeping you alive?
Pepper cupped his cheek and Tony reluctantly met her blue-grey eyes. With a rougher voice, Pepper stated, “He will always be your friend. He is the most loyal person I have ever met…but, what you two are doing right now will not last. He’s going to stop sleeping with you but you will keep loving him and stubbornly denying it. And then, eventually, Steve will give his heart to another and you will be crushed.” She begged, “Don’t do this to yourself. You’d be happy with him. Stop pushing him away!”
Steve instinctly reached out and grasped Peter. Peter rarely spoke of his time with Hydra but when he did he called them the “mean people.”
“My master he -,” the man stopped speaking and his gaze zeroed in on her. Natasha tightened her hold on her gun and shifted uneasily on her knees. He gasped, “You are my soulmate?” Natasha nodded and his eyes greedily took in her form. He whispered to himself, “I have a soulmate…”
“Your birthfather,” Tony stated, wondering how much he knew. His fingers dug into the chair arms and he asked, “Did anyone tell you about him?”
The robot chuckled and Steve flushed, feeling like he said something stupid. Iron Man affirmed, “It is
“I’m glad we are in agreement,” Tony stated and reached between Steve’s legs. He dipped the towel under the water and cupped his balls. Steve threw his head back with a groan and tightly gripped the rims of the tub. Tony lingered down there, rolling his balls in his hand then paying particular attention to each testicle stroking each as if he was polishing fine silver. He took his time and it drove Steve to the edge.
“That…That's why I'm here now. The thought of being away from you again…I…I don't want to be separated from you again so soon after…if I’m able, I'd rather be here.”
Tony drew his caress back up and Steve had to adjust his step to keep from staggering. Steve was going to launch himself at Tony if he didn’t do something more. Tony’s fingers eventually paused and grasped the robe over Steve’s shoulder. Steve held his breath as the rest of the robe fell away with the pull. Steve shivered as a rush of cold air gusted over his skin.
Upon entering the lab, Tony slipped from Steve and fretfully fluttered about. He shooed away Dummy, cleared off the couch, and commanded Jarvis to play some music.
Tony stepped out of the suit control holograms and turned over to a private channel. To Steve alone, he whispered, “We…our past selves are looking at the pictures.”
Steve collected him into his embrace automatically. It was second nature to him now. This time they didn’t spoon but faced each other. Tony tucked his face into the crook of his shoulder and breathed warm air onto his chest. Steve sighed again as his muscles relaxed into Tony’s familiar form and their collected warmth chased away the chill under the blankets.
It was a hot summer day so Steve walked into the city. He dried off fairly quickly and marveled at the sights as he walked. The buildings, the people, and even the cars had changed in the decades since he had last been home. Yet little things still remained whether it was an old building that was still standing or a tree that had grown, Steve smiled whenever he saw them.
They let go of each other and stepped back. Steve went inside and Tony remained where he was standing in the dark, watching Steve until he was gone.
Tony heartedly groaned, the sound shaking his chest as Steve entered him and skewered him right on his prostrate. Tony bit down on his lip and Steve grinned wickedly at him, knowing exactly what was wrong. Tony tightened his ass muscles and that wicked gleam left Steve’s eyes only to be replaced by shock and passion. With that Tony began to move and it was Steve’s turn to bite down on his lip.
“I…I just never met another kid like me,” the boy replied and held out his arm with his sleeve drawn up to Steve, displaying the zeroed implant on his own arm.
All Wade could do to keep it together was to breathe shallowly and hold onto Peter. He wouldn’t be able to hold on much longer and he didn’t want to come before Peter was inside him so he gasped, “I’m ready.”
“Oh, you’re so cute,” Pepper cooed at the little boy being carried off screen. The screen flickered again as a few shorter takes quickly filtered through his father stumbling through his lines.
Tony concluded Steve’s account by stating, “Well you’ve traveled far…and now here we are.” Steve placed the pizza boxes down and Tony continued, “So you don’t want to fight a war you are not a part of which is understandable. The army has been requesting my tech ever since Iron Man first appeared and there’s
Steve did the only thing he could do and lay beside him for it all. He turned Tony’s head so he could see Steve and those hazy, begging eyes never once looked away from him.
“I am sorry, Sir. I am unable to connect to the server. Suit systems are returning to optimum function, but outside communication is very limited. I cannot get a reading on
Clint was the next one Coulson called and he was not too happy about having to omit the truth to his boss…especially when he had evidence he was going to have to hand him that clearly showed where Rogers was.
“That’s Jarvis, my AI,” Tony explained upon seeing Peter’s confused expression. He probably hadn't realized the other voice in the video that was sent to him was an AI. He probably just assumed it was another person like Tony's butler or something. Tony cleared his throat and looked particularly at Peter. He asked, “That all depends on Peter. Are you still going to go?”
Steve laughed and kissed him deeply. They drew apart, all smiles, and hands tracing each other’s bodies. Steve pressed his forehead to Tony’s and whispered, “I’ve never been happier than right now.”
Steve reached out to him but fell before he could make contact. His shield fell from his grasp and clanged loudly as it fell to the level below.
“Tony?” Steve gasped, hating that he could not be there to help him and hating that he could only listen to Tony struggle and not know what was happening.
Tony couldn’t stop himself. He reached out and grasped Steve’s hand, curling his fingers into Steve’s. Steve’s hands were larger than his and warmer. The hold was so much more intimate than when they last touched to check if they were soulmates. He felt Steve hesitate for a moment and he stared at Tony as if he were trying to evaluate his actions. But, slowly but surely, he curled his fingers around Tony’s.
“Ben!” She gasped, taking a step toward him, then stopping herself. She looked torn between running to Ben to running away.
Tyler was being unusually silent. She never once interrupted the proceedings but her eyes were always angry.
“Yes,” Steve replied breathlessly. Tony pushed himself up and kissed Steve tenderly. Steve closed his eyes and returned the kiss with a happy sigh. He heard some of the phones around them click as they took their picture but Steve didn't care. He didn't even care if he and Tony were the topic of scrutiny for years to come.
Tony grabbed onto the bedframe and held tight but his feet slid back from the pressure of the shockwave. He managed to mostly keep upright and keep his eyes on Steve.
“Tony…” He turned to her and she cupped his face as she whispered, “Everything we do in our lives have consequences. And those consequences affect other people in our lives for better or for worse. We have no control of that just as you didn’t have control in the past.”
Peter dropped again and when he caught himself he looked down. He was probably halfway down the tower.
future. I’m limited by the technology of my time, but one day, you’ll figure this out and when you do…you’ll have changed the world. If never get the chance to tell you this…I wanted you to know in my past, present, and future, what is and will always be, my greatest creation…is you.”
They pulled away from each other slowly but their hands only tightened on each other as if fearing the other would pull totally away.
“What? You want alone time with him? And when he starts kissing you, then what? You’ll let him because it makes him feel better?”
Peter turned to Steve and, when their eyes met, Peter saw Steve’s gaze hone immediately on the fear in Peter’s.
“Oh my god,” Peter gasped, taking a step back. He pointed at Tony and gasped, “You had the surgery to remove the reactor when I was a baby. And Pops –
. And he wanted to know that his boyfriend and father could coexist and maybe even like each other. He wanted to know that what he thought impossible was now possible…but mostly, he must’ve wanted to know if this was really happening.
Peter nodded furiously and Wade grinned. He slid his hand over the back of Peter’s head and pulled him down, whispering, “Let’s come together.”
Tony pricked an eyebrow and lightly grasped Steve’s hips as he asked, “Want to join me for a quick shower?”
“We’d be trending on the taco thread,” Wade pointed out with a grin. “I bet we’d even be in the top post section for the taco tag for the rest of Instagram’s existence.”
Howard’s finger circled around the star-spangled drawing of Tony’s shield and remembered all the designs Howard had gone through before settling on the classic design that was now immortalized in history as being synonymous with Captain America. The Vibranium was a bitch to get so he had been so nervous etching the design on it…
The other two agents already had their guns up and fired at him. The suit grabbed him across his chest twisted Tony behind it while returning fire from the blasters. Tony hissed when a bullet clipped him just above his hip but the agents weren’t so lucky. All were wearing matching burns to their heads and chests from where Jarvis hit him.
That knife of betrayal not only twisted inside of Tony but also gutted him and then felt like it proceeded to viciously stab him in the chest as Obadiah walked away from him with the arc reactor in hand.
The first booming sound made Steve almost trip over his own feet and he immediately spun around to look to the building he’d just ran by. The relative peace of the area made him complacent. He’d grown used to it and was completely thrown by the noise.
Steve had included Mary’s picture in with the rest of them. It had seemed appropriate, if it were not for her sacrifice none of this would have been possible. Steve would have never had Peter, he would have never moved into the tower, he and Tony would not have gotten closer and eventually started dating. She was a part of their family even though Steve nor Peter had never met her.
Drinking a fresh cup of coffee, Steve watched them both discreetly through a gap in the curtains to the windows that looked into the infirmary.
He stared at her outstretched hand as she spoke. His gaze was unreadable. For all she knew, he was calculating the best way to kill her.
She closed her eyes, listened to the sounds of Peter’s breathing, and waited. In short time, Peter’s breathing grew even and Mary knew he fell back asleep.
“Nah, little trick I learned when restoring cars,” Tony said. “It’s easy on the metal but gets the rust and other contaminants off good. It’ll do for now…can you open that can for me?”
He and Eddie looked up from the beaker at the same time and locked eyes. The room was silent. Everyone had stopped what they were doing to watch the scientific miracle that had just occurred.
“You looked very serious just now,” Bucky commented. Voicing one of his fears, he whispered, “…Is it about Zola? Will we…will we not catch him?”
Peter glanced down at himself and didn’t note a difference. Now that he thought about it, when had he last eaten? The last few hours had been spent as Spidey but he didn’t remember grabbing a bite to eat…with all the excitement over Venom, Peter had been skipping out on meals while he was out swinging…but that couldn’t affect him so drastically and so soon!
Peter hugged his Iron Man toy to his chest and nodded. A small smile curled the edges of his lips and he whispered, “Cause he is ah superhero, like you.”
“Please don’t tell me that’s all you’ve been consuming today,” Steve sighed, pressing his forehead to Tony’s.
Tony was so shocked that he could not think for the span of a few seconds before he finally garbled, “E-Escaped?
He explained his ailments and she grinned. She cupped his arm and murmured, “I think you are happy here, with me.”
“We kept it a secret to protect the timeline and discourage anyone from attempting to time travel,” Steve added into the comms.
Steve couldn’t stop his eyes from tearing as he got closer to the property. He couldn’t even run anymore and jogged weirdly as he randomly laughed and cried like a crazy person.
“You thought right,” Natasha replied. “You know...being a single-dad is a turn on for a lot of women and I know quite a few women who would—.”
Wow. If it would take two hours to get to Malibu by car then running was probably only going to take an hour. He blazed on ahead, energized by the notion and only stopped when he reached the ocean. He took a deep breath of the salty air and then released all the smog and car exhaust he’d been breathing in, in one big exhale.
Tony tightened his hold on him and whispered vehemently, “Don’t give up just yet, Steve! We can fight this!”
Bucky sighed heavily, being the last to exit the tent, he tied off the flaps and said, “It’s a damn long, gay story, but I’ll try ta fill ya all in…”
When did Steve die? How long had they been living in the same era without knowing it? How much time did he miss out on with him?
“No,” Peter whimpered, his small hands knotted tightly into Tony’s shirt. Bruce glanced at his friend and was glad to see that Tony continued to sleep. Tony was Bruce’s best friend but he would not understand and most likely would not approve of what he was about to tell his son.
On a side note, since I started writing this I kept telling myself to start posting things to tumblr and now I am finally going to start! I'm mostly going to be posting small excerpts from future chapters before actually posting them here (keep in mind I am writing two fics right now so there will be content from both of them [the other fic being Steve/Bucky]). If you want to follow me on tumblr you can find me
Steve fell and he heard explanations of alarm and fear. Moments later, clothed hands were turning him over and they were talking to him.
Before Peter could respond, Steve stepped in and said, “Bruce, he just got here. Please, refrain from taking scientific samples until the fifth visit.”
Bucky entered the tent and secured it shut. He walked over to Steve and whispered, “How was he through the night?”
“New York-Presbyterian Hospital,” Jarvis replied and the crawling of his skin turned into a full on shudder. It may have been Steve’s body he was watching but he knew it was Venom who was guiding him. He was not walking through a hospital, he was walking through hunting grounds.
At this point, all the civilians gone and Bucky tucked Peter into his chest, stepping away from Steve as he did. He spared Steve one last desolate look then ran, disappearing behind the double swinging doors to the main hub of the hospital, leaving just Steve, his teammates, and the symbiote alone in the huge room.
Friday directed him to Steve, who was waiting for him in their living room. He was no longer on the phone with Coulson and, as soon as his eyes landed on Tony, his blue gaze became alight with joy.
That superiority he always prized was slipping out of his fingers. Suddenly, Hydra’s success was not that important…but destroying the Captain and every shred of his humanity was...
“That’s all I can tell you. A lot happens in the future, the coming year especially…and I can’t risk either of you changing it,” Tony stated seriously.
Steve was instantly distracted by the gravity in the AI’s voice and the Goblin was able to punch him across the face.
He took it over to the couch and sat down, placing the album on his lap. He slowly opened it. The first picture was of his parents laughing and wearing green, foam crowns with the statue of liberty in the background. Peter sighed and turned the page. There were more photos of his parents. Some were just of them, some were taken with people he did not know, some were with his Aunt May or Uncle Ben. He kept turning the pages until he came across the photo he was looking for. With every page, his guilt grew. He could not believe he was doing this.
“Where’s Tony?” Peter asked, his father’s name felt odd on his tongue. Tony was “Dad” and he hadn’t been on a first name basis with him for years.
That was right. Cable was a time traveler too and he was wearing the glove again. He must’ve gotten it back from the Goblin! They could go back –
He tried to be silent, but he kept exhaling in sobs and it woke Tony. One look at Steve and Tony reached out to him.
Wade’s utter confusion made Peter jerk back. He stared into the man’s conflicted eyes and slowly replied, “You turned me on…”
He knew he was somewhere in the arctic and north would just have more snow and less life so Steve easily deduced he should head south. He was confident he could go in the right direction using only the sun and stars as his directors.
Steve’s shoulders slumped and his eyes got big and glassy like a sad puppy. It took all of Tony’s willpower not to hug him. Instead, he clasped his shoulder and promised, “She is not going to get away with this! It’s going to get nasty. People are going to look at you differently. But know that me and the rest of the Avengers know the truth and we’re going to be with you throughout it! Better yet, I come with a pack of lawyers who are going to tear this woman apart!”
There were hundreds of questions he could have asked: This was supposedly Howard’s son, from the future, stepping out of an amazing robotic suit with untold potential.  The man was clearly placing his trust in Steve and may have revealed more about the future or Steve should have done something to confirm he was who he said he was.
“Sorry, baby boy, I had to stop it before it dragged us too far,” Wade gasped, the blood dripping from his mouth muddled his words. He looked over his shoulder and couldn’t even see May’s home anymore but Iron Man was limping over to them.
Thor was laughing as he stepped back into their realm. As soon as his eyes fell on Heimdall, he boasted, “Another great battle and worthy victory!”
All his life, Peter imagined himself growing up to be like his fathers. He always envisioned himself becoming a superhero just like them.
“Don’t you dare say ‘I’m sorry’ again, I have heard it enough to last a lifetime…and I…right now I just want to hold you, Steve…”
Steve parked his bike and walked up to the building where he and Bucky lived in together. When they lived in the building it had been crumbing and looked like it would not stand for much longer. Since then, it had been retrofitted. The building still looked fairly old but it no longer appeared it was on the verge of collapse. It was only three stories and the top two stories looked like they were apartments. The bottom floor was an Italian deli.
Hours later, Steve finally followed him down and he announced his presence by stating, "He's heading back to Queens."
Tony stepped out of the Iron Man suit and, without any hesitation, took Steve into his warm embrace.
Tony hovered by his side as they escorted him to the lab technician. The young man stared star-struck at him and shook a little as he swabbed the inside of Steve’s cheek with an elongated q-tip. He plucked a few hairs from his head with just as much nervousness.
is a big unit, it'll take us awhile to collectively move out but, once we’re all moving, it’ll go by faster.”
“Ughhhh,” the other moaned back. He scrunched his face as if to escape the new day by tightening his eyes.
was the sound of your soulmate being executed, Stark,” Schmidt stated, grinning madly as Tony felt like the world around him was crumbling. “I think I
Tony smirked. He felt like he had won some kind of test. He pulled Steve onward and whispered, “We’re almost there.”
The detectives on the case were called to the stand first and they gave their testimony on the investigation. It was odd to hear how they viewed Steve. With the belief that he was a rapist, they twisted his reactions from their interview to make Steve seem more callous and unfeeling. Steve couldn’t look at them as they demolished his character.
They slowly went through them. Bucky never said a word, but Tony provided commentary as the photos reminded him of happier times.
Tony had his hand open and waiting and Steve regarded it a moment before sliding his hand into Tony’s. Tony’s palm was warm and calloused from all the work he had done in the lab over the years. His fingers curled around Steve’s hand then, one by one he carded his fingers between Steve’s. Tony’s thumb, however, began to caress circles into Steve’s palm. The caress tickled and made him shiver.
One by one, the rest of the Commandos woke and packed up. They sat around their fire and boiled water for their rations of instant coffee. When it was done, they wordlessly shared the hot water and passed it along the group. Each man filled up his own mug and their freeze-dried, powdered beans turned into a cup of joe. Steve missed the fresh coffee from the Hydra kitchens already...
He could not wipe the grin off his face and, for the first time since entering Steve’s apartment, Tony began to feel at ease. Steve had to go out of his way to print this and he purposely printed one of them clearly as a couple. Steve liked to see them together and he woke up to this image every morning.
He always knew this, but it had always felt like a faraway future…and he always assumed he’d see him off…not die.
“No, don’t be – I – Well, I forgot about that…” The cuddling was so nice and relaxing that the kiss jarred him back into reality. He had forgotten why they were there and got lost in the moment. Steve mumbled. “… I – Sorry.”
Gabe’s brows pinched together in confusion and he looked from Tony’s face and back to his chest and confirmed, “
It was a piece of himself he thought lost but it had survived without the host. Venom was intrigued but wary. How had that lost piece survived?
“To infinity and beyond,” Tony said with an exhausted smile and an air-high-five in Steve’s direction.
Peter was napping on Bucky’s chest and Bucky was laid out across the couch, seemingly napping himself. The Winter Soldier opened one eye as soon as Tony entered the room and glared at Tony, as if daring him to wake the small child.
Steve stopped, huffing from the effort, and looked at him impatiently. Tony continued, needing to get this out there before it was too late. He gasped, “Just so you know, I don’t
He was almost immediately introduced to the Avenger Initiative and through it met Natasha, Clint, and Bruce. Tony was only a consultant as Fury found him to be too violate, self-obsessed, and containing no good teamwork or people skills. Though the others told him he was practically an Avenger and it’d be a matter of time before Fury and Tony accepted it.
“He’d be so embarrassed by this,” Bucky chuckled. “Hell, that plaque over there could be considered a novel and it mostly says what a good soldier he is…he was…” Bucky paused, all good nature leaving his expression, and then he hissed, “He was so much more than a good soldier.”
Steve and Tony quickly slipped on their black shirts as the plane landed. Steve had to do a double take on Tony when the shirt was on. The reactor shined through the fabric and he’d grown so used to helping him smother the light that it felt odd to see it through his shirt out in the open like this.
Wade barked out a laugh and leaned onto his hand with sparkling eyes as he smirked at Peter. He replied, “Let’s just say I’m a coworker that he tolerates. You?”
He turned back to the mirror as both of his parents chuckled and peered at his costume full on. Peter designed it himself but drawing it and wearing it were two completely different things. He and his dad worked together in making it, using near-indestructible material that Peter just now realized was completely formfitting.
From the restaurant, they walked to the pier next, hand-in-hand, praising the good food and groaning over their full bellies
“Don’t worry, we won’t stay too long. We just want to ask where Mary is,” Steve tried to assure the nervous looking boy.
“Yes, it originally was supposed to contain Hulk if he got out of control. SHILED made half a dozen just in case.”
“Woah, there. Only people on the list can enter,” the beefier of the two stated. Neither had a clipboard so whatever list they were talking about was nowhere in sight.
When their lips separated, they stared at each other a few moments and Tony whispered, “I missed that…I missed you…”
Steve smiled at Tony but his eyes slipped from his boyfriend and were drawn to his own reflection of the mirror behind Tony. He had a fine layer of hair growing on his scalp and a growing stubble of light blonde hair highlighting his jaw. His entire head was red like his hands except for his left side which splotchy red, pink, and white. It was glossy as if wet and Steve’s eyes flickered down as his stomach churned unpleasantly at the sight.
When the plane plummeted from the sky, Steve placed his hand over his zeroed out implant and he wondered if he had a soulmate waiting for him in heaven standing beside Bucky and his mate. They would be happy and smiling and he would finally be complete.
Tony buried his face into Steve’s hair and whispered, “I…I am fine but I thought…I thought you’d be dead. When I heard those shots –!”
His usually expressionless lawyers all shared looks of shock and extreme bafflement before fixing their faces back to their neutral expressions.
Steve let go of Tony's hand and shoved his left hand into the Iron Man gauntlet he had taken off Tony. He took a steadying breath and then whispered, “Whether it be 1940, 2009, today…or to infinity, wherever you go, I go.”
“Yes, Uncle Phil,” Peter droned with a roll of his eyes. Coulson nodded then spared Mary a measured but threatening stare before departing.
All he was able to feel and think of was pain. It took him a few minutes to feel more than the hurt and comprehend he was conscious. In addition to the pain, his mind was foggy and befuddled. He could barely tell right from left nonetheless tell what had happened.
Steve could have pulled away, instead, he leaned in and returned the kiss, mirroring Tony’s lazy caress. Tony wrapped a hand around Steve’s back to keep his balance and Steve also wound his arm around him but only to draw him closer.
The judge knocked his gavel loudly upon the wood and the noise reverberated through Steve. He stared blankly at the judge’s podium as the information slowly trickled into his brain. Behind him, Tony angrily yelled at the judge but his voice was muffled and echoed. Steve did not have enough brain function to understand what he was saying.
A moment later, there was pounding on the door and Fury demanding, “Stark?? Rogers?? What the hell is going on in there??”
With no food, Venom fed off Peter instead, draining him of energy. He had lost all his body fat and looked like he had not eaten in weeks. Hell, he felt like he had not eaten in weeks.
Peter glanced up from under his lashes and saw Tony leaning toward him. His interest gave him the courage he needed and he replied, “It was alright…I…I like my coffee black and Steve had said you do too.”
Peter had hustled his way into Natasha’s arms and was excitedly telling her about his birthday so far. Natasha listened to his son with a small, peaceful smile.
Mary sat down at her desk. The monitor was already on and, just as she predicted, the Goblin did not look pleased.
“You need to heal just as fast to be there for him,” Bruce countered. “And you’re not going to do that as well by laying here.”
Venom cocked his head to the side upon hearing his voice. It then threw itself at the nearest wall with a screech, hitting the wall with a loud thud.
That elicited an emotional response from the Winter Soldier. The man rose a single brow and dryly repeated, “Jerk?”
“You’re lucky. The judge isn’t looking to showboat and drag this out,” Marcel commented dryly as he collected his papers.
The robot nodded and murmured, “I am going to do a fly around. Maybe I’ll come across the Red Skull.”
Tony finally broke eye contact with Steve to meet the gaze of the approaching Commando. The others jogged over to see how Tony was doing. Tony grinned at all of them and replied, “I’m good! A little banged up but Dr. Jones here fixed me up!”
Tony’s phone pinged lightly and he picked it up as he snickered to Steve’s reply. His chuckles stopped as he looked at the screen and the smile fell off his face.
Tony paused when he saw him and wondered if he should leave Steve alone. When he saw the trembling in his shoulders, Tony was reminded of that night he had woken Steve from his nightmare and Tony separated the distance between them in a few quick strides.
Tony cracked open his eyes and stiffly turned his neck to peer at the body curled into his side. It took him a moment to recognize his son.
When they returned to the dreamworld, Steve was still on the verge of losing everything but Tony looked…fine. He was tired and the glow was back in his chest but he’d clearly been through the ringer.
“I feel somewhat responsible. He remembered me first,” Steve tried to explain. Internally, he was flinching again. Natasha had been upset with Steve as well. The main reason she was upset with Bucky was because he remembered Steve over Natasha twice. She was upset with Steve because, when Bucky pursued Steve, Steve had wavered. Old feelings from the past compromised Steve and it almost destroyed his relationship with Tony. As both their friends, she had felt hurt by Steve’s near-betrayal too.
Pepper slid next to him on the couch, lightly touched his arm, finally drawing his full attention. Her eyes searched his and she whispered, “You’ve been very quiet the last few days and look…sad. What’s going on?”
He retained Venom’s height but Venom shaped them with a slicker body similar to Peter’s. He had a full body suit that did not expose an inch of skin and was Venom’s pure black hide. A white spider clutched his chest, marking Peter with the symbol he always associated his powers with. The only other color in his black suit was the white of his oval, glass eyes. He looked like an adult, like the superhero he always thought he would grow up to be.
As he spoke, Mary’s expression revealed nothing and, whenever she spoke, her voice was always soft, almost a whisper.
Steve transferred Peter from his arms to Ben’s. Peter went with only a murmur of discomfort as the dog-tags were pulled out of his hold. Ben handled Peter tenderly and whispered to him, “Are you sure you do not want any ice cream? I bet there’s some rocky road left in the freezer.”
How could he tell Tony that he was right, and Steve would be nothing without him, without giving Tony hope?
Steve assured him he had everything in control and promised a meal would be ready for all of them tonight and for Peter not to worry about any of it. He even promised to have a word with his dad. Peter had slipped away before Tony woke but he could already imagine him grumbling and harrumphing under his breath.
Something had changed since he last tried to kill Natasha. Tony had assumed he remembered Steve and wanted to help him more than wanting to kill Natasha but…maybe he had remembered his soulmate too…
“No, you said the next time we go together you would make sure the paparazzi were there!” Steve retorted angrily.
It took him a moment to note the tender pain in his chest and then another moment to comprehend that meant the surgery was done.
“Tyler recanted the date. She says the trauma altered her memory and she cannot pinpoint it. Now put down the shield or I will use force.”
The team was waiting for him by the entrance to the Tower. His sense of relief evolved into joy. He was back with his friends again.
“It was me, not Bruce,” Steve quickly explained on behalf of their friend. “We think Venom might be able to bond with me too and he might leave Peter if I were a more willing host.”
Steve was going to kiss him and there was no way in hell Tony was going to pretend it didn’t happen. Not again. Why would Steve pretend like nothing was happening between them??
The address was for an old warehouse that looked like it hadn’t been used in over a decade. They scanned the building as they flew over it but they were unable to get any sort of reading inside.
Steve pushed his tiny form out of the trash with a groan. The trash bag had split and he was covered in day old spaghetti. He gagged as he picked the slimy pasta out of his hair.
They both leaned into each other’s sides as Cable approached. Cable had a metal arm like Bucky but also one of his eyes were glowing red and Steve could see more robotic flesh on his neck. He wondered if Hydra had a hand in that just like they did with Bucky, but he knew he couldn’t ask because of ramifications to the future.
Steve didn’t have to break the bars as Vision merely had to reach through and then pull Peter through like he was nothing more than a ghost.
Steve froze upon his words. He gently laid his arm back over Tony and pulled him in tightly for a snug embrace.
“…Good.” Peter closed his eyes and inhaled deeply. He tried to make himself calm down but his heart continued to race. Originally, it was because of his fear of the attack, now, it was because of his apprehension of meeting his mother.
Steve’s stomach clenched unpleasantly as he wondered the questions himself. He replied, “That can’t happen. Mary said Venom rejected me.”
To distract himself while he waited for Pepper to get the information, Tony finished updating the Mark III. He kept the color scheme from the Mark II, loving the way the gold-titanium paired with the hot-rod red.
Tony did not notice him at first. He was bent over a piece of his Iron Man suit. Steve could not see his hands, they were buried in the machinery, and sparks were flying up from what he was working on.
He woke up with Aunt May wishing him a happy birthday and had a platter of his favorite blueberry pancakes for breakfast. He went out, saying he was meeting up with some friends, but in actuality he patrolled the city as Spider-Man. He did that until dinner. He came back home and had dinner with Aunt May, some neighbors, and a couple of childhood friends from the neighborhood.
Finally, the judge announced, “Given the evidence, I cannot confidently dismiss this case. The trial will take place a month to this day. We are adjourned.”
Within seconds, she drew her fist back as far as she could and punched him across the jaw. Bucky was thrown back and made no move to catch himself. He stumbled back and landed painfully on his tailbone but showed no outward signs of pain.
Steve pressed a kiss onto Tony’s head and lightly caressed circles into his back. Tony took a long, settling breath and then whispered, “I love you so much…”
This chapter is the darkest out of them all and there are trigger warnings for depression and loss...
“I do, J,” Tony said quickly, not ready to hear it said aloud just yet, especially from the soothing, familiar voice of his AI. He repeated breathlessly, “I do…”
And, as with the last chapter, more events from The Winter Soldier here but there is a lot of canon divergence as I will continue to play with timelines, plot, characters, and the boys' emotions! :D
Steve pressed his face into Bucky’s warm shoulder and felt his very alive heart beating madly against Steve’s chest. He gasped, “How is this possible? How are you alive and here?? You died, Bucky! I saw you die!”
Tony cracked open the door and, as soon as he saw it was him, he opened the door for him. He was clean and, with his hair wet, Steve realized how poofy it had been when dry. Steve’s large clothes also sagged on Tony’s thin frame and the arc reactor was peeking out from behind the collar of the undershirt. Steve tried not to stare but the mechanism was beautiful with its glow and linear flower-like design. His fingers itched to sketch it.
“You two can continue later,” Peter waved it off and sat next to Wade, leaning into his side and grasping his hand.
Tony was at his side in seconds and hovering worriedly around him, clearly wanting to touch him but too afraid to do so in fear of hurting him further.
The Iron Patriot lunged at Steve and the repulsors in his feet shot him into Steve with an extreme driving force. Steve had no time to comprehend what the Mandarin wanted with him over the President of the United States as they hit the wall and it collapsed, spilling them both into the other room.
was busily regrouping, collecting what information they could from this Hydra site, and preparing to leave it all at once. They had a few more days there before moving onto the next possible Hydra compound. Tony was wary and excited about going with the Commandos. Excited because, hello, it was the Commandos. Who wouldn’t be excited? And Steve would be going so, of course Tony would follow.
“Yum,” Tony moaned, not looking forward to the freeze-dried food. He sarcastically added, “And good luck with creating the impossible.”
Steve’s head snapped up and he looked up to where the voice emanated with trepidation. He had forgotten about the AI. Jarvis was absolutely loyal to Tony, would he warn him of Steve’s intentions before he had the chance to slip away?
To Tony, they’d only been reunited less than an hour ago and he’d found out that Steve had come back to life only a few days ago. He still wasn’t over the fact that Steve had survived the impossible and they would be spending the rest of their lives together.
His dad always told him to never underestimate the organization and would always quote the lame-ass saying: “Cut off one head and two more will take its place.”
Steve’s words tangled on his tongue as a redheaded woman strolled into the room, wearing a tight black body suit and carrying a long bag over her shoulder. Steve jumped out his and Tony’s embrace and the woman said, “Hello, Stark.”
Steve scrambled back to his feet and ran to Tony, watching with horror as the man ripped off the rest of Tony’s helmet.
“We’ve been together for three years!” Steve gasped. “How many times have you done this behind my back?!”
“Oh my God. Forget everything I just said about Mandarin orange. I am leaving now just to glory in your reaction to banana hammocks.
This sucked. The only good thing that happened that day was his work with his shield and, at that moment, he so badly wanted to go back to his lab. At least there he’d be isolated and would only have to think about the shield.
Steve excitedly dove into the food as he finished his account. Tony ordered pizzas and, just as Steve was wrapping up his story, they arrived.
Peter felt his shirt collar pull back and his neck and his Spider-Man uniform be exposed to the cool air of the store.
Steve merely adjusted and tightened his hold on Tony, wordlessly letting Tony know where he wanted to be.
He was hurting too. Every time Tony winced or he saw the marks, or he contemplated how much longer they had…he felt like someone was trying to rip his heart out of his chest.
“Yes, Tony,” she sighed. “After the statement is released, you and Steve need to do a press conference. You need to show your faces and show the world you are together: share a kiss, hold hands,
Tony flew them to a platform where Rhodes was waiting. Steve stared at the golden faceplate, wishing it would rise and reveal Tony. He could not believe it was him until he actually saw him. Tony landed and gently placed Steve down next to him.
Steve trailed his kisses upward as he replied, “Frozen mostly. Dead to the world until…” He paused in his kissing and leveled himself with Tony so he could look at him properly in the eyes. He whispered, “I was dead inside until I met you. You saved me, Tony.”
Tony stretched with a light moan then stood and let the blanket fall. There was no need for modesty when the only eyes watching him were that of his robots and they’d seen him in worse conditions. He strolled over to his workbench and another smile tugged at his lips when he saw his clothes had been picked up and neatly folded into a pile. A small container of aspirin and a full water bottle also sat next to the attire.
When Cable didn’t reply, Steve looked up to the seasoned time traveled and saw him staring at Tony with a hard expression.
Peter shot his webshooter at the opposite building and swung away, breaking their kiss. Wade grinned and waved wildly as he flew away.
The toddler years seemed to have passed in the blink of an eye and grew skinny child with gangly limbs and a fierce intelligence.
He didn't want to leave. He wanted to keep kissing Wade and exploring these new feelings growing within him...but he knew his father was already worrying and it'd be a matter of time before he started looking for Peter. Peter was not ready for Wade to meet the parents just yet.
Coulson refocused all his senses to pick this person out and walked into the other room, following the sound of Stark’s whining.
They soon went back to small talk with Steve and Bucky quickly adopting their old Brooklyn accents and 40s slang like they always did when they were in each other’s presence.
Natasha took the Chameleon to SHIELD. Bucky drove back in the team’s car and Tony flew Steve back with him to the nearby Tower. They landed on the balcony to their apartment and Steve let go of Tony, shaking the cold out of his limbs. The flight was short and was not high enough for ice but the wind chill was still freezing. He didn’t know how Sam flew with his face exposed all the time!
Eventually, they pulled back and properly looked at each other. Pepper cupped his face and looked deeply into his eyes. She whispered, “You’ve been put through the ringer…”
Steve brows immediately rose in surprise. He’d seen the other shield but he had assumed he used it on his other arm like a second weapon due to its smaller size. He repeated in question, “My old shield?”
Steve was going on a genuine date. He'd never been on one before…His eyes met Tony and his heart skipped a beat. Not only was he stepping out but he was doing it with one handsome fella too.
He fell back onto his bed, staring at the number. His heart was beating wildly in his chest and considering what Wade wanted made him feel enthusiastic and wary…but an excited wary, like what one felt when you were about to board a rollercoaster.
Their eyes locked and Bucky’s gaze bore into his, digging deep into his soul. He felt as if everything he was, was bared for Bucky to see, including all the fantasies Steve ever had about him. All the blood left Steve’s face and he felt his mouth dry.
Steve rolled his eyes and murmured, "I hope not...I did plenty of that during the War and don’t want to repeat that in this century."
A high-pitched sound pierced his ears and was so painful he fell to his knees. On the ground, he was then assaulted with a bright light that stole his vision and, once the spots disappeared, he was finally able to focus on the machine and saw that his son was gone.
Steve wobbled over to Tony’s side and probably was only able to stay upright due to the way the other man’s gaze never broke from his.
When they finally went down for bed, Steve carefully wrapped his arms around Tony but Tony still grunted painfully from his touch. Steve instantly flinched back feeling horrible for causing him more pain. He scooted back, planning to give Tony as much room as possible as he slept.
Steve’s breathing had evened out and Tony took it as a sign that he’d fallen asleep and was waiting for him in their dreams. Tony smiled and willed his body to do the same.
“He almost saw my Spidey uniform!” Peter hissed, clutching his shirt tighter to his chest. “And it can happen again! Next time the person might be pulling on my shirt for a comment or a picture or even an
Tears were falling from his eyes again but he was so used to doing it he did not even notice it. He nodded madly to Steve’s statement and Steve drew him into his embrace.
Steve slipped behind the servers’ corridor for a breather. None of the staff bothered him as they were quite busy, though most openly stared. Steve stepped back into an alcove where a forgotten sink sat. It obscured him from the staff and he leaned against the small counter with a heavy sigh in private.
Their arm pinches they shared started to feel as intimate as their kisses. Steve felt a light flush creep into his cheeks again and he whispered, “Yeah, I’ll – I’ll see you later…”
“If you hadn’t seen Steve in years…If you thought he was dead and suddenly he was just there…would you just stand aside and avoid him because you might get hurt? Even when you’re the only one who could help him?”
Images from the reports and scenes from movies replayed in Tony’s mind as he remembered both men were not expected to live much longer. Barnes would go first and then, less than a week later, Rogers would die. It was clear both would die for the other or…be willing to change the future to save the other and Tony couldn’t risk it.
The stranger turned when he heard the impact and then threw back his head and laughed when he saw Tony sprawled on the floor. Tony grit his teeth in frustration, wanting to sock this guy in the face and rip his reactor out of his hands.
“Oh, this guy gets better and better,” Tony replied with glee. For three years, Tony had been alone in the “superhero” arena but, with the chance appearance of aliens, this eccentric “Thor” with an honest to God bright red, superman cape just stepped out of nowhere and made his day.
The picture he was looking for was a professional one of his father in a suit. It was a large photo and it must have been 8 x10 inches. It was the clearest out of all the photos in the album with its high quality and it was the closest thing Peter had to actually looking at him.
Steve was already turned on by Tony sitting on him but, with those words, Steve’s fingers dug into Tony’s thighs and, with heat starting to pool madly in his belly, Steve breathlessly gasped,
He could see Pepper hurrying down beyond the glass so he quickly said, “Tell Fury I’ll get back to him and opaque the glass before he has his agents come peek in at me.”
Steve ran his fingers through Tony’s hair and lightly pressed a kiss onto the top of his forehead. He replied, “Love you too…”
She pulled out some batons for herself and replied, “And you are my soulmate. How many more times must I remind you of this?” She turned to him with a teasing smile and he felt his lips twitch in return.
He needed to stop thinking about this now so he got off his ass and went to see how he could help Steve in the kitchen. When Tony offered his help, Steve smiled knowingly at him but directed him to mix the ingredients either way. Tony dutifully got to work and leaned into Steve’s side as his husband began to talk about his mother's recipe.
“Oh thank God,” Tony moaned with delight. He snuggled against Steve and the lights dimmed. He asked with a yawn, “Why did I clear it? Is it National Pancake day or something?”
“Master Parker has wakened, Master Rogers,” Jarvis interrupted just as Steve felt the prickly ends of Tony’s goatee against his lips. Steve shot back and Tony groaned and dropped his head onto Steve’s shoulder.
“He would’ve survived that blast, he did so before,” Cable countered. “Your little act of heroism has changed nothing. Stark is alive, but your photo is still blank. The future is still undecided. We’re missing something.”
They eventually took the trip to D.C. a week after Bucky asked. Pepper requested the time, hoping SHIELD would have a better hold of itself in the time. SHIELD did use the time wisely. Hydra was pretty much devastated by the time they left California and the only remaining agents were on the run and being hunted down.
Tony wound his arms behind Steve’s head and forced him back down to kiss him some more. Steve chuckled but obliged and Tony wrapped his legs around Steve’s hips.
It was one last bite from the dead beast and Tony had gotten to close. He should have listened to his father.
In the back of his mind, his more rational side was calling his bluff but his cock to precedent in his mind at the moment so he did not hear it.
Steve was there in an instant. He worriedly cupped Tony’s face and asked, “Are you okay?? What’s wrong??”
Peter leaned onto his hand, placing himself even closer to the mercenary and he whispered, “Hit me with your best shot.”
“Just a fashionable new chest piece,” Tony murmured, nuzzling his face into Steve’s neck. Steve released a long sigh and then pulled Tony into his embrace.
“Get down, Mr. President!” The agent opposite him jumped over the desk and shoved him underneath. Steve removed his shield and stepped in front of the desk. The gunshots grew louder as the intruder came closer. Steve waited, peeking over his shield, his body tensed and ready to fight.
bedroom. The building had its own arc reactor and would be able to be powered for centuries. The island itself was a small blotch of land and Steve wouldn’t get a proper run on it but Tony planned to make the younger man so exhausted from other activities that he wouldn’t need to run.
Angry at Norman then, and with good reason. Did he blackmail her, threaten her, or something worse? Steve’s stomach bubbled unpleasantly as he thought of the man. He never liked Norman but was he more than a mean person? Could he have locked Mary away against her will?
“Would you like me to list out everything Pepper disallowed from your birthday party?” Tony asked, his voice strained and his eyes worried.
He let himself get lost in his passion and forgot all about why he and Tony were kissing. He let himself believe that it was all about them, that when Tony told him his body was excited to touch him it was because he not only wanted Steve…but he wanted
Steve never before had experienced the all-encompassing pain he was in...it was even worse than his plane crash in the Arctic.
Tony started to move slowly and Steve cursed under his breath and gripped his hands more tightly. Tony let go of one of his hands and grasped the bouncing cock between them. Steve inhaled sharply and and started to move his hips more sharply with Tony's thrusts.
"You'll never know unless you try," Steve whispered. When Tony said nothing, Steve murmured, "This is the part where you throw back your head and reluctantly agree with me."
She began monotonously, talking about her cleaning duties at the Tower but then she got more emotional and her eyes got a faraway look as she spoke of the attack and described it in great detail.
They shared a shower, got dressed together, used the same mirror as they brushed their teeth, and then Tony latched onto Steve’s side as they lay down for bed.
upset Aunt Tasha,” Bucky pushed on. “And I remembered that I loved her too late. I hurt her, your Pops, and Uncle Tony in the process.”
His vision dipped into darkness for a second and, in that moment, he remembered the first time his son smiled at him. It had been tentative and uncertain but it had been directed solely at Tony. It was the first sign to him that Peter was willing to make a connection and place his cautious trust in his birthfather.
Once they finally were out of the main hall and cleared away from the majority of the mass that had exited it, Peter turned to Wade and said, “I’ve got a scheduled appointment right now to annihilate Hawkeye at pool…Would you like to join me?”
Steve bit the inside of his cheek then decided to go with his gut feeling. He asked, “Do you still have Mary’s blood sample?”
In the last five minutes on his tablet, Tony had seen at least ten different versions of his and Steve’s parting in pictures, video, and gifs. Their kiss was examined, grieved, and pitied by the masses.
Peter gasped, “I’m sorry! I didn’t mean to make it sound like you weren’t a part of my family! You’ve always been my family!
Secondly, and most importantly, her timer was about to run out. Ever since she was given the timer, she’d been training for the moment it would reach its end. Once she killed her soulmate, she would be fully inducted into the Black Widow program and can go on real missions.
Thor landed softly beside him and stated, “There has been no movement since your transport has landed. If we are surrounded, they are not making themselves obvious.”
Steve’s heart dropped when he saw his son. Peter had transformed overnight and looked like he was just skin and bones. His eyes were sunken in and dark, his skin was tight and dry, and his once thick brown hair was thin. Peter trembled where he fell and the tendrils of Venom which were still attached to him shook his body all the more.
“…Beings of home will try to separate us,” Venom hissed. Peter cringed under his anger and ducked his head to try to make himself smaller.
“I don’t still love Bucky,” Steve interrupted. He flushed guiltily and said, “…I mean I did love him, now…I don’t know what I feel toward him. Heck, I don’t even know if he is alive…”
