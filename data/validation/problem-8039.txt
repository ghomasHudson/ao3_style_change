“It is not a bowl,” Bucky said, far too gleefully. Steve shot him an exasperated look.
He loved the feeling of being so full of Steve’s cock that the pressure and fullness seemed to be in every part of his body and then still having to take more.  Being knotted went beyond pleasure or pain, beyond orgasm or sex, it was deeply intimate, giving and receiving on a fundamental level.  They were tethered together in an act that spanned thousands of years, that made both Alpha and Omega vulnerable for a time, and yet, was required for procreation.  It seemed to make no sense, and hadn’t to Tony for a long time, but then, there was Steve, and being with Steve like this…having Steve be his in this way, it was, well…it was breathtaking.
He would go wherever Steve went, of course, but that was different. Steve was Alpha. And Steve was...Steve. Steve was everything. He blinked up at Steve. He remembered Steve standing between him and Tyber and the other Clan men. He remembered the carved lion. He remembered that Steve loved the things Tony made, like his spear-thrower and his trapes. He remembered Pleasures. He remembered the roar Steve let out when he charged at the man who called Tony an abomination. He remembered that Steve said he was good.
“What?  No. No, God, no,” Tony rushed out. “No, it’s—it’s not you.  Shit. That sounds—okay, can we just forget I said anything?”
“You had something else in mind?” Tony asked as he clicked a few shots on the camera, checking the digital display after each one.  “Friday, lower the lighting five percent.”
“Speaking of, did you really…” Steve let the question hang in the air.
He blinked, adjusting to the light as the door shut behind him with a soft thud. The room was small, and softly lit by a domed light overhead, instead of the harsh glow from the hallway. Wood paneling covered all four walls. A large, plush rug ran the length of the room. To one side, a door opened to a tiny bathroom with just a toilet and one of those pedestal sinks. Out of the corner of his eye, he could see the edge of his reflection caught in the simple mirror hanging over the sink, though he didn’t feel like looking at himself very long.
There were a lot of rules about how to treat the King in public, it turned out. Tony had gamely wagered that Steve would manage to keep to them for no more than a day.  Don’t touch him, Steve reminded himself, though, now that he could see Tony, Steve thought he might truly not be capable of not touching him.  He wanted to throw himself at Tony, prostrate himself at Tony’s feet and beg for release, wrap himself in Tony’s arms and collapse, he didn’t know.  All of them. None of them. The world was reduced to a flat plain of nothing, an endless, still sea, except Tony and the need to feel him, to cling to him, to be enveloped by him, in his words, his touch, his gaze.

Stone was tall, blond, and broad shouldered, fair of face with a ready smile.  Steve supposed there was some superficial resemblance, enough, apparently for Sitwell to think Steve might be of interest to the King.
“You aren't going to believe this,” Tony started, breathing heavily as he took the stairs. “But, I just got cockblocked by Justice is Blind.”
There was a trap in those words, Steve knew. Hiding underneath them, covered in sand, perhaps, lay a pit for him to fall into, and ask, again, for something Tony could not—or would not—give him.
“Captain America is coming,” Tony managed.  No.  Wait. That wasn’t right.  Something—the thought was gone before he could even begin to chase it.
And now here he was, in some kind of Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous beach day setting that Tony had apparently put together.  For him.  He’d just been telling himself not to read too much into swimming trunks, and now this.  He honestly didn’t know what to think.
“I can get out here,” Steve offered.  He wrapped a hand around his backpack and started to twist towards the door.
a won-ton. I couldn't even get one of those packets of crappy soy sauce, and Barnes had like twenty of them,” Rhodey protested. “I know because he counted them out into little piles of five, the bastard. Not to mention, okay, sure, a nineteen year old with zero experience with money blowing his wad, I can buy. But...it's off, somehow. The whole thing. You see it, too, but you don't want to admit it because that's going to open a can of worms. Not just any worms. I'm talking Hebert-level sandworms. And please, “Oh, the Stark tech is so shiny and pretty and awesome! Did you build that with your giant, brilliant mind, Tony?” Good Lord. Thought Barnes was going to whittle his chopsticks into shivs and take you out. Which, begs the question, what the hell, am I right?”
Stane straightened his suit jacket and made to walk out, stopping as he brushed past Tony.  “You have no idea the mistake you are making here, Tony, my boy.  I’ve always tried to look out for you.  Even when you were your own worst enemy.”
“That’s good. What’d you talk about?” Rhodey asked.
“You like the pretty light, huh?  How about this?” Tony said, holding the gauntlet out in front of him and powering it up just enough to make it glow blue and spark.   “Not a magical, glowing bridge through space, but not bad, right?”
“Look, I get that Howard screwed you both over.  Probably you more than Tony, which, I gotta tell you, was probably an unintentional oversight on his part,” Rhodey went on.  “And I know your head has got to be spinning with all this.  But, I had to watch this man try to get over you once, and I’m telling you, I’m not going through that again.  I’m just not.  He doesn’t deserve that.”
Blue light, everywhere, engulfing him, swallowing him, drinking him down, and he was flying, flying into the night under a blood-red moon.  Come to me.  Come to me. Come to--
“Yes, Tony,” Steve added after a moment.  He licked his lips and looked at the strap again.  It filled his vision, crystal clear, while everything else went hazy at the edges.
Tony followed Coulson to the elevator and stepped inside, watching Coulson hit the button for the nineteenth floor before the doors slid shut.  A few floors later, the doors opened, and two impossibly large Alphas stepped in, chatting about something to do with fibers from forensics.
They lay like that for long minutes, until Steve could feel their clammy bodies starting to congeal.  He heard Tony let out a long sigh, then he gamely rolled off of Steve, climbed out of the bed and padded over to what Steve assumed was the bathroom.  The sound of running water seemed to confirm that, and sure enough, Tony returned with a towel around his waist and a warm, damp towel in his hand that he used to wipe Steve down.
“It’ll be easier, at least the first time we try this,” Tony promised, nudging at Steve’s hip.
Tony looked back down at the broken lance laying in the dirt. Steve couldn’t quite tell if he was angry or something else.  Steve had, admittedly, overstepped. He knew that. The thought that Tony might punish him washed over him, tying his stomach in knots and sending a pulse of need down his cock, pooling heat and pressure there with a steady drumbeat.  Finally, Tony looked back up at Steve, then just nodded and walked slowly off the dais and back into the castle. Steve had no choice but to follow. The guards and Cam trailed behind, though as soon as they reached the chamber Tony was using, he waved them off.
“Trampolining. Pogo-stick contests.  Bunny Hop dance-off. Jumpstyle competitions,” Tony rattled off.
“Did the Taliban wave your grunge phase in your face before they tried to blow you up?  Then, no, not the same,” Tony quipped, giving Steve a small, wan smile.  “We could go away.  Just us. I’ve got a place. In Malibu.  Private. Get away until things blow over a bit.”
“Fine,” Tony breathed out in defeat.  “I’m not getting on that thing, though,” he said, pointing at the stretcher.  He let Steve help him to his feet, and sure, he may have swayed a bit, but who cared, when he got to faceplant into Steve’s chest?  “I’ll get on this thing,” he suggested, then grinned up at Steve.
“I’ll get lunch ready, if you want to start opening the boxes,” Steve suggested with as much enthusiasm as he could muster in the face of Tony’s decided lack of it.  Still, it was
“Actually,” Stark said, making Steve pause mid-turn. “I might be able to help you locate this wayward boyfriend of yours.”  He  pushed himself off the railing and took a few steps towards Steve, bringing him in the light.  Steve had the absurd thought that he was shorter than he looked on TV, though he didn’t voice it.
Steve.  Not really.  But, he had not-fishing and chess, debates and discussions, his garage and his sketch of Maria.  He had laughter.  He had that warm feeling in his chest whenever Steve walked into a room.  He had that swooping, diving thing his stomach did when he wondered about things.  He had the way Steve smiled at him, all soft-eyed and bright.  He had his tin can hotline and DUM-E and U.  He had Steve listening while he rambled over long afternoons in the garage until Steve’s bottom lip had a dusting of graphite on it.
“The universe is vast, Tony, I’m sure--” Steve began.
“Of course,” Tony said, smiling and sliding his sunglasses out of his pocket. He had no such thing, of course, but if he could miniaturize an arc reactor, he was pretty sure that hacking the  county clerk’s office was probably not going to present nearly the issue that dealing with Pepper’s wrath was likely to produce. “You’ll have it on your desk by morning,” Tony promised. “Signed, sealed and delivered.”
“I don’t know. Coffee mugs, pillows, couple of throw blankets,” Tony mumbled without looking up.
“I like you,” Steve told him.
Tony nodded and maneuvered the Audi towards State Route 18, which lauded itself as scenic.
“So…” Tony began, drawing out the word.  “Thank you for being a total dick to my Dad.  That was pretty awesome.”  Steve didn’t respond, just stood there, a muscle in Steve’s jaw ticking off the seconds in time with Tony’s watch.  “I feel like you kind of want to say that they started it, but you’re thinking that sounds too childish.  If so, let me remind you my Dad just literally greeted you by polishing his cue stick.”
“You want me to be Tony,” Tony murmured, voice soft and filled with something wondrous that Steve couldn’t name, but made warmth bloom in his chest and his throat tighten.
Harder now.  Faster.  Rougher.  There would be callouses on Tony’s hand from his work, Steve well knew.  They would scrape along the delicate skin there.  He could almost feel it on his own cock, which jutted out insistently between his legs as Steve’s eyes tracked Tony’s hand while he stroked himself.  Small pants of air sounded in the quiet of the room.  Another groan.  A broken-off curse.  Tony’s body slumped, then bowed, and he cried out, harsh and guttural.
“Thanks again for...whatever you did,” Steve added, handing Stark back his phone. “That was a lot faster than me trying to figure out this place, apparently.  We’re having--or trying to have, I guess--this romantic weekend thing, and, well...so, anyway, thanks.”
“I’m to be a scribe, not a soldier,” Cam protested. He sounded affronted.  Steve let out a low laugh that was mostly caught behind his veil, though he heard Peran grunt approvingly.
“He’s still kind of ticked about the press conference,” Tony explained with a grimace.  “I should’ve told him.  Before I did that, I mean.  Not like I don’t get where he’s coming from.  He’s SI’s Air Force liaison.  Kind of a big deal if we cut off production in the middle of contracts, not to mention what’s in the pipeline.  He says the lawyers already called him, told him not to talk to me.”
Tony nodded. “I think so.”
things, Steve wanted to protest, though he didn’t actually know that.  It felt wrong though, all of it. Fury’s calm acceptance, his easy explanation, it all felt wrong.  Steve wondered if maybe he was the thing that was wrong. “Whatever they’ve said about him, I don’t care.  I would still like to ask to Court him formally.”
at Steve while Thor rattled on, shooting pointed looks at Tony.  Steve just frowned at him.  Bucky grinned and nudged Natasha, then jerked his head in Tony’s direction in the least subtle way possible.
“Mine,” Mark Twenty-Six repeated as Steve gave it an exasperated grimace.
“You’re weird,” Steve observed, scrunching his face up, then sighing with heavy exaggeration.  “But, don’t worry.  I guess you’re
His mind was still half abed, his body warm and teetering between the need to stretch and move and an indolent desire to do little to nothing, as if all it would take was stilling himself for a moment to recapture whatever haze it was that had ruled his body and mind during the night.  He could almost see it, hovering just out of reach, but so close, and if he but stopped…turned around, returned, he could find it again…though he didn’t.  He never did.  He wondered if that was enough, not to let himself go back, or if now that he’d gorged himself, freeing himself from the fairy folk was as illusory as his mother’s tales claimed.
“I did not cheat,” Steve ground out.
“Hey, in my defense, I took that back!” Tony said, holding up his index finger in a sign of protest.  “Besides, I just suggested you find someone else so that you wouldn’t leave me, which, yeah, I know how messed up that sounds, but believe it or not, it made sense in my head at the time,” Tony broke in with a self-deprecating grimace and accompany eye roll.
“Hey, there’s a tracker in my phone!” Tony said brightly, holding up the tiny piece of tech that he’d pulled out of the insides of the phone.  “Where’d you get this?  Steve? Steve?” Tony repeated blankly, then looked down at the pieces of his phone. “Oh. Whoops.”
“Tony, I don’t hate you. I could never hate you,” Steve replied. He reached out and stroked a hand down the side of Tony’s face, cupping his jaw and then tipping his chin up so Tony was forced to look at him. “I love you.  You know that, it’s just…”
“Pepper, you’re brilliant,” Tony announced clapping his hands together and standing up in one swift motion, sending the chair rocking on its back legs.  “The Met!  Steve likes the Met.”
of the helicopter’s approach and feel the wind pick up.  He watched the black speck get larger, studiously trying to ignore the warmth emanating from the man next to him. It wasn’t long before a sleek, black chopper emblazoned with Stark’s name on the side touched down on the rooftop helipad.  It resembled one of the military craft he was familiar with, but had clearly had a number of modifications done. A man Steve assumed must be the co-pilot opened the door and waved them in, greeting Tony with an easy welcome before sliding back into the chair next to the pilot.
Tony thought he might understand that more, now.
Steve took a deep breath.  “Brock,” he began.
“Smells good,” Tony remarked.
“Which worked, by the way, and I seem to recall you jumping on top of it,” Tony shot back. “What were you even going to do?” Tony demanded in exasperation, then rolled his eyes, because, well, that had been one of his less well thought out plans, and Steve’s reaction had made him feel the tiniest bit guilty. He was all the alien had, after all. “Fine, I take your point, but still. A head’s up next time? For the sake of my newly healthy heart that we should probably not road test like that?”
Steve thought back to the bright burst of joy that lit his chest when he opened the door and saw Tony waiting.  He was always going to say yes, wasn’t he?  He let Tony be the one to push.  Easier that way, maybe.  Cowardly.  But, easier.  For a while, at least, until it got him here, with no way out of this for either of them.
Not that it had gone badly.  The opposite, really.  Steve’s lack of anger over the garage, his delight at the idea of Tony’s ‘bots, his disinterest in, well…Tony, all these were good things, as far as Tony was concerned, but since when did he get to have nice things?
With an exaggerated groan, Tony swung his legs over the side of the bed, got up and headed for the bathroom.  By the time the shower finally warmed up, his head was full of biocontainment filtration systems.  He washed his nest of hair as he worked through the pros and cons of internal air filtration system designs for biohazard suits.  Really a suit is only going to be as good as the filter, when you got down to brass tacks, he decided.
that is folly, but this?  Us? Tell me that you don’t feel this,” Tony husked out, his voice raw and urgent.
He stared at the ceiling, watching the lights of the city move and shift as time crept by.
“Don’t be ridiculous, of course it isn’t, and you know it,” Tony shot back, then flattened his mouth and ran a hand through his hair, leaving it in tufts.  “Steve...all I’m saying is that sex is a part of life, and one that has been traded in one way or another since time immemorial. For food, protection, security, money, status, whatever the case may be. Your only experience with the harem was a poor one, I’ll grant you, but you’ll find that, while yes, some are sold or captives from war, many people choose to enter the training houses as a way out of a life that offers very little.  And even in the other cases, it might be a more preferable fate that any other. Maybe none of this is ideal to you, but is trading your lot for a soldier’s truly life so much better?”
“What?” Steve cut in sharply.
“You could just tell him, you know.  I know, I know, the Circle of Secrecy, but come on, man.  It’s Captain America.  He’s not going to out you,” Rhodey said.
The thing in his ass started to, well, inflate, was the best word Tony could manage to dig up from the dregs of his brain.  Grow. Definitely was getting bigger. Slowly, but he could feel the pressure building, the burning stretch of it as his walls were forced open.  The cylinder around his cock started pumping him in earnest, the suction wrapping around him, surrounding his cock on all sides, massaging and stroking and sucking all at once.  God, it felt amazing. Fantastic. Overwhelming. It was too much, all the sensation, way too much, it had to be, but it wasn’t. It was perfect.
, Steve thought again.
“Maybe,” Tony admitted through half a yawn.
“I didn’t,” Tony continued.  “Then, I mean. Because I was twenty-one, going on asshole, and Dad was my favorite proving ground.”
Tony. It was perfect, Steve thought.  Beautiful and perfect and given to him to say.  A shibboleth, Steve thought. The good kind. I didn’t know those existed.
Pinching the base of his cock until he winced, Tony pumped his hips again, harder this time, lifting himself up and slamming back down hard enough to send a jolt of pleasure bursting through his groin, whiting out his vision.  Error.  The thought came fully formed, bright and beautiful into the front of his mind. Error processing.  Oh, fuck, yes.  That’s the ticket, Tony thought, eyes snapping open and mouth agape.  He pushed himself up again, then back down, snapping his hips in quick, short bursts that sent the head of Steve’s cock brushing against his prostate.  Not commands. Errors.  That’s all the feedback loop needed.  Errors.  Simple.
“I—“ Tony began, then broke off. There wasn’t a good answer here.  The time for good answers, careful words, all that was gone.  His mouth opened, but no sound came out.  In his ears, his heartrate spiked, swooped then started pounding, tick-tock, like a countdown.
“Well, me and Bucky, we—we kind of thought someone ought to do something about that kind of thing,” Steve said.
“So, I should…” she said, pointing down at her tablet.
“You call them Flatheads,” Tony said. “But, to them, they are Clan. They took me in when I was hurt as a child and raised me as--as one of their own.”
“The slope of the armor on top will help deflect the impact of projectiles,” Steve said in slow, halting words.
“You’re a hopeless romantic with delusions of grandeur,” Tony said.  “Glass Slipper?  Really?  I’m the son of an erstwhile-billionaire, give or take a few Federal charges, who likes to fuck strangers for money and emotional avoidance, not exactly Cinder-fucking-ella, here.”
“Well, stop them! Look, not to overdramatize, but this is a matter of life and death, Matt. If the government gets its hands on the tech, they’ll weaponize it, you know they will. And that’s the good scenario. You know what I told you about Stane, Pierce and the rest of them,” Tony reminded him.
“No, it isn’t,” Steve countered softly.  “I lost someone.  A—ah.  A buddy of mine,” Steve said, walking slowly towards where Tony stood just outside the front door.  “No.  Not a buddy.  He was…he was my best friend.”
He wasn’t proud of it, but he would’ve run then, if he could’ve gotten free of Steve’s grip.
.  But, I think you are someone who understands what it is like to be powerless, and maybe...maybe we need more of that.”
“I don’t think he likes me much,” Steve said.
“I’m still sorry,” Tony sighed.
The Tower’s garage door opened automatically for him, and Steve parked his bike in its usual spot, then took the elevator all the way up to the living quarters. From the elevator vestibule, he could hear the party in full swing in the living room, with occasional bursts of laughter filtering through.
“And this is the friend you went off to the Army with, right?” Tony asked.  Steve nodded. “He out, too?”
“Fine, so that was one for me.  Now, your turn.  It’s a plant this time.  Yes, you can eat it.  Is it from Star Trek?  Now, Steve, do you really think I’d—okay, fine, yes, it’s from Star Trek, but we never said we were restricted to terrestrial choices.  Let me point out that you picked an animal that doesn’t actually exist in nature, so I think Kaferian apples are fair game—hey,” Tony cut himself off abruptly, sitting up so fast the room spun for a moment before righting itself.  There had been a…a twitch.  Something.  He was almost sure. “Steve?  Steve, can you—can you do that again?”
, he thought quietly.  Not like this is your first time meeting an Omega.  Though quite rare, if you were in Tony’s sphere, brokers practically threw them at you.  Being introduced was one thing.  An Omega at a party was a coup, after all, and he did throw the best parties.  They were beautiful, sure.  Tending to the smaller side, long, graceful limbs, always attracting a crowd just wanting to be in their presence.  He supposed, if you thought about it, which he certainly had not spent a ton of time doing, nope, but if one did think about these things, then maybe it made some kind of crazy sense, what Erskine had done.  Omegas naturally drew people to them, Alphas and Betas sought out their presence like sirens, everyone seemingly happy just to be around them.  Throw in some serum and vita-rays, and you have yourself a charismatic leader.
Which was why he’d planned to tell Tony when he could do so without the man flying off the handle about it.  Instead, Tony gets to find out in the worst possible way.   Because of course, this was his life, he thought with a heavy sigh.
The battle had gone well enough, no major injuries and Tony assured him the damage was mostly to retro collections trying to make the eighties come back and wasn’t any real loss. Tony grabbed him to fly back to the Tower, wrapping metal arms tightly around him as they took off into the air, and Steve spent the ride back thinking about where the more vulnerable suit joints were located.  When Tony dropped him back on the Tower’s platform, suggesting they raid the fridge for leftovers, Steve had really had about all he could handle.  He shoved Tony back against the wall, pinning him with his body and driving his tongue down Tony’s throat as deeply as he could, catching Tony’s groan as he did, and God, that was good, better than good, it was warm and wet and tasted of scotch and Tony and Steve really would feel badly about coming all over the uniform, but there probably wasn’t going to be any help for it if they did this much---
the car.”
Steve looked down at the rug for a moment, it’s mosaic pattern blurring as he tried to focus.  “No,” he said, looking back up at Tony.  “Not you.  I know that.  I do.  Zola, though—he said, there are punishments--"
“Five?” Tony guessed.
“A bit risky,” Stane warned, his eyes dancing with a threat.
“Yeah,” Steve nodded.  “Ready to head back?  I guess I should try on whatever suits might be delivered.”  Brock nodded and finished his drink in one, long swallow, then they weaved their way through the flow of people and towards the casino doors.
He checked his reflection in the mirror and adjusted his tie, then smoothed down the soft fabric of the jacket.  It was entirely possible this suit cost more than he had ever had in his bank account at once in his life.  He figured he was probably doomed to spill something on it.
“What kind of strange?” Bruce asked.
Tony Stark was on the balcony.
“Did he now?” the King asked, and Cam nodded. Steve could feel the weight of the King’s gaze on him, different now, though no less assessing.  “Go. Off with you now.  Tell the fat man, who is probably yelling about sauces, to give you something called chocolate that he is hiding in his private stash that he thinks I don’t know about,” the King urged, clapping a hand on Cam’s shoulder and sending him scooting out of the workshop.  With another sly, if somewhat apologetic, glance at Steve, the elated boy practically ran out of the room, off to raid the kitchens again.
“What the hell am I going to do about you?” Tony asked, getting no answer other than the tips of Steve’s fingers scratching at his beard where water still clung to it.  Tony wasn’t sure when it had turned from what was the team going to do to what was he going to do, but he had three bags of baby paraphernalia and pee-strained pants that said it was currently his problem.  He wasn’t even sure what he was asking at this point.  Thor was going to fix this, and then…and then everything could go back to the way it had been before, when Steve didn’t talk to him unless he had to, and then, everything was so strained with what they weren’t saying that Tony wasn’t even sure which conversation they were having.  The one about how Clint needed longer range arrows or the one about how Tony had nearly fucked everything up and left the why of it unsaid.  Or the one about what happened on the farm, which they
“You are a lot. I…like a lot.  I’m not having second thoughts, Tony,” Steve said, steadying his gaze on Tony and raising his chin a little.   He huffed out a deprecating laugh and swiped a hand over his mouth, giving Tony a wan smile. “I’m having…whatever the opposite of second thoughts are, I guess,” he laughed lowly, shaking his head.
“You didn’t have to do this, but…” Steve began, eyes glistening as he looked down at Tony.  “I’m glad you did.”
“Hi,” Steve said, blinking at Shellhead as he felt a flush creep over his skin.
“How long have you two been Bonded?” Tony asked curiously.
“No—No, I—no,” Tony stuttered as his eyes scanned the bolded paragraph headings. Anticipatory Forfeiture of Spousal Support. Waiver of Alimony. Waiver of Community Property and/or Equitable Distribution Rights. Waiver and Assignment of Patent, Trademark and Intellectual Property Rights. It went on, but the gist of it was easy enough to gather.
Steve gurgled happily and promptly spit up on the front of Tony’s suit, otherwise seemingly unfazed by the flurry of activity around him. Well, that’s a giant, fucking metaphor, Tony thought, resisting the urge to roll his eyes.
He looked back up at Bruce, who was clearly alternating between wanting to be anywhere else and ask a hundred different questions. “It doesn’t matter,” Tony heard himself say, the words sitting warm and fluid in his chest. It was true. It didn’t matter. He had been searching for something he’d already found, and almost lost it in the looking.
“Ah, right.  Dinner.  I could maybe, ah—“ Tony started, looking around behind him like the answer would magically appear.
“I have no doubt that you can do pretty much anything you put your mind to,” Steve agreed.  He was tapping at his bottom lip with the pad of his thumb, and Tony found his eyes drawn to the movement.  Tap-tap-tap.  Finger against lip.  Tony wondered what it would be like to feel Steve’s thumb slide along his lip, push inside, Tony’s mouth closing around it, sucking gently while Steve watched him.  There was an answering pull in his belly at the thought, deep and low, sending a warm pressure arching down between his legs to the tip of his cock.
Hooking the reactor up to the ship took some doing, but it worked.  The oxygen system was first. Hearing it whir to life was about the best sound he could imagine other than helicopter blades over an endless desert.
It took awhile for him to come back to himself, felt his body still trembling as if trying to reassemble itself into the proper form.  Tony’s head was bowed, forehead leaning against Steve’s thigh, mouth wrenched in a pained grimace.
“Want to?” Tony asked Steve, cocking his brow in challenge.  “Promise, I’ll stay ten miles under the speed limit at all times.”
“Is it offensive that I kind of want to study you in a lab?” Tony asked.
“When you leave here?” Steve asked with a confused frown.
Nothing about that was an explanation Steve wanted to give, so he kept silent under Fury’s steady gaze.  Something about the way Fury asked the question made Steve bristle, though. The feigned nonchalance of it, maybe, Steve thought.  As if everything since he’d woken up wasn’t some kind of orchestrated maneuver.
Everyone was trying desperately not to stare at him, except for Barnes, who was probably working out the pattern for his Tony Stark voodoo doll because he’d upset Steve, which, why was Steve even upset about any of this?  Guilt?  Well, karma with a side of payback is a bitch to choke down, Tony supposed, and if Steve wanted to play the woe-is-me victim card around his friends, then fine, but it wasn’t like Tony had to just sit back and take it.   Which, he supposed, was probably Rhodey’s point.  Or, one of them, anyway.
“Yes, I did this.  As I said, I thought I was doing you a service,” Tony acknowledged, his voice tinged with a regret even Steve could hear.  “And you are here so that I may
Tony’s lips were soft.  Steve remembered that from the kiss at the police station.  That
Brock grabbed for Steve’s hand and pulled him towards the doors.  “A million bucks,” Brock said, shaking his head and laughing up at the night sky, giving it a whoop.  “Can you fucking imagine that?  A million dollars in one night. Just to sleep with Tony Stark.  Bet there’s a fuckton of guys who’d be all over that.  Crazy shit, huh?  Vegas, man.  Fucking Vegas. Can you believe it?”
Things, Steve said, just things, he repeated, his face heating up.  Then he slammed his jaw shut and shook his head.  And that was that.  Honestly, the man could be incredibly stubborn sometimes, and apparently, talking to Tony about naughty pictures the guys had passed around along with hoards of cigarettes and chocolate during the war was the hill Steve wanted to die on as far as over-sharing reminiscences with Tony.
“Oh, no, don’t pull me into this...whatever it is,” Bruce protested, holding his hands up in front of him.  “I’m just here to stock my medicine cabinet, Tony, not argue the innate nature of mankind with you. Steve, for what it’s worth, Tony’s not nearly as cynical as he likes people to think he is, okay?  He has a soft heart under all that prickly exterior, and he only argues with people he likes and thinks might be,
“I’m telling Steve there wasn’t a reservation. He’ll probably write a letter of apology,” Barnes called out over shoulder.
“Well, good luck to you both,” she called out as she slung the towel around her neck.  “Hope it all works out, planned or not.”
Tony did a double-take, eyes widening, then threw his head back and let out a whoop of laughter.  “God, you’re--” he cut himself off, wiping his hand over his mouth and looking away.  Steve watched him seem to stop and start a couple of times, his throat bobbing as he seemed to swallow the words, then his expression grew solemn and he seemed to quiet in Steve’s arms, almost...deflating, Steve thought, if that was the right word.
“You have no idea.  What you’re capable of.  Who you really are. You’re—God, Tony, you’re the bravest man I’ve ever met,” Steve said, his voice going soft and urgent.
“Ms. Potts told me. That’s wonderful, Mr. Stark!  And it’s so nice to meet you, Captain.  Huge fan,” Happy said, reaching out a hand in greeting.
like this, about being
“Fine,” Steve replied, raising his voice enough to be heard over the engines.
For a second, Tony was back in Boston, laughing over Barnes’ haul of stuff he considered fair game that he would share with Steve, ketchup packets, round little containers of salad dressings, napkins, plasticware, even huge spools of toilet tissue that some less than stellar employee had left on top of the back of the toilet instead of locking onto the holder.  Suckers, Tony thought with the ghost of remembered laughter.
“Ninja turtles and a futon?  You definitely aren’t getting laid,” Kirk replied flatly.  “More’s the pity.”
“You’ve managed to cause me a fair bit of problems in a short amount of time,” Stane observed, looking at Steve over his shoulder while his finger traced over the spines of various books that were ordered in a row on the low credenza.  Once, the books had held images and texts that made Steve’s ears go red just thinking about.  Now, they were treatises on art, history, military and philosophy, tomes that Tony had provided because he thought Steve might like them.
“Ah, come on, Howard.  DoD doesn’t give two shits if he likes Harry or Harriet, if the product’s there,” Stane pointed out with a shrug.  “Sure, we don’t advertise it or anything, but,” he shrugged.  “Not like they didn’t look the other way with Oppenheimer and that thing with his student, right?  Smart enough, good enough, quiet enough, they don’t care.”
“James. Come on, man, we’re practically related by marriage,” Rhodey said.  “Which is why you and I need to have a conversation.  Buckle up.”
The thing in his ass moved again, lengthening within him.  Tony let out a stuttering groan. The alien glanced down, then back at Tony, a look of what Tony took as concern crossing his features for a moment before it was gone and replaced with a knowing smile as Tony’s mouth went slack.  He thought he might be drooling, not that he cared. He couldn’t really seem to care about anything. Caring was too hard, too
“The Union Club,” Tony said suddenly, snapping his gaze up to Steve’s.  “Obie’s a member.  He’s having dinner there with a Senator now.  That was on the judge’s profile that Pepper put together.  He’s a member, too.  God, I’m an idiot.”
“What sort of thing?” Steve pressed.  He tried to keep his voice steady. It took some effort.  As always, when it came to this kind of wordplay, the conversations that hid inside others, he found himself off-kilter.  He could feel his hands curl into fists around the chair handles. Fury’s eye glanced down surreptitiously, catching the motion, and Steve forced himself to relax.
.  Damn.  He’d forgotten that one, finding himself reddening even as he sat in his own apartment.  Because coffee meant something else nowadays, as Natasha had very sternly told him after one of the guys from the boxing ring downtown he liked to go from time to time when he needed to get out of the Tower had asked him if he wanted to get a coffee, which he’d mentioned to Natasha in passing as odd because it was July in New York and he’d just spent an hour pounding bags with his fists, so coffee seemed an odd choice, under the circumstances.  She had enlightened him.
It was surprisingly easy with Shellhead’s help, Steve quickly realized.  Water splashed into the boat as she tossed against the waves at the break point, but with Shellhead propelling them, it didn’t take much in the way of contribution from Steve to get them past the rock-strewn underwater ledge that broke the waves as they roared in towards shore and into open water, where things calmed enough for the boat to bob along fairly steadily.
He didn’t quite know where that from, but a well of pain and frustrated, impotent anger came on its heels. It wasn’t aimed at Steve, exactly, but it wasn’t not aimed at him, either.  Tony had just enough time to think, ‘fuck, too far,’ before Steve drew back like he’d been slapped.  Tony opened his mouth to apologize, but couldn’t get any sounds to come out.
“Yes,” Tony said, darting a look at his father.  He rubbed his hands up and down his arms, then seemed to consciously stop the movement and crossed them in front of his chest instead.  He looked so small there, sitting in the middle of a pile of adults, with his sock-covered feet hanging above the floor, one leg bouncing with a nervous tell. Smaller even in some ways than he had in the last video, though Steve couldn’t say exactly why.
“Boss was up early this morning,” Happy reported. “Haven’t seen him up and about like that for awhile.  Has some project going.  Something big, he said.  Sometimes, when he gets some idea in his head, he’ll forget everything that isn’t those machines a’his.  Well.  Most everything,” Happy clarified, giving Steve a quick glance in the rearview mirror.  “Used to do that all the time.  Been awhile, you know?  Since he’s been all excited about something, I mean.  Afghanistan,” Happy said at Steve’s questioning look, as if that word explained everything, and Steve supposed maybe it did.
“Didn’t seem to,” Steve answered quietly.  His hands were fisted on the tops of his thighs, rubbing up and down like he was trying to push them through the fabric and into the skin there.  If they were a couple, this was the point when Tony would do something solicitous like lean over, run a hand across Steve’s back and ask him what was wrong, because he hadn’t been like this with Stern, so it couldn’t just be about someone knowing what he did for a living.  Hell, Steve had turned the tables on Stern so fast, the guy hadn’t known what hit him.  Well, technically, he’d known that Tony hit him, but metaphors, whatever.
Steve gave him a long look, but didn't argue, just nodded slowly. “Yeah,” he breathed out. “Yeah, it was. I'm—I'm sorry. For runnin' out. I shouldn't have just left like that. I just—I wasn't expecting to see you again, and then you were here , and everyone was eating and trying to, you know...” he trailed off, waving a hand in the air.
It didn’t take long to get the lunch packed.  He’d ordered one of those wicker baskets like he wanted, and it was now stuffed to the brim with sandwiches, sodas, chips, cookies, and napkins.   Tony never commented on how much Steve ate, but he couldn’t help feeling slightly self-conscious about it. He grabbed a cheery-looking, red-checked blanket from the closet. It was still in the plastic packaging where he had ordered it and never opened it.  He got his sketchbook, too, the one with the Metropolis sketch he was working on, and a few charcoal pencils, and threw Tony’s computer tablet into the basket as well.  He couldn’t imagine Tony wanting to fish for very long, but he hoped the tablet would give him something to do, so he would want to stay a bit longer.
“He’s not a duckling, Tony.  He didn’t imprint on you or something,” Clint said with a laugh.  “Babies are surprisingly perceptive.  They know who they like, who’s gonna take care of them, give ‘em food and all that stuff.”
To be fair, it had been a plan destined to fail, Tony figured a couple of hours later as he tore the multi-spectral targeting system from the belly of the drone and turned it over in his hand.  The laser rangefinder was something from the Dark Ages.  Or Windows ’98.  So, basically the same thing.  Probably needed an exorcism to get it to work properly.
“Good, Steve. That’s good. You’re doing so well for me,” Tony told him, voice warm and almost unspeakably tender.  It was like a balm, warm and soothing atop everything else.  He was good.  He was good for Tony.  He was doing well.  Nothing else mattered.  There had been something, but it was behind him now, and he hovered.  Everything below was small. Insignificant.
“Ah. Right,” Steve said.  “Observatory.”
“If you listen closely, you can hear it mocking the English.  Anyway, fair point on the club.  Rhodey.  All his fault.  Okay, maybe, like twelve percent my fault, but, honestly, mostly on Rhodey,” Tony said, bobbing his head with a nod.  “And, thankfully so, of course,” he finished, tipping his glass in Steve’s direction.  “He’d heard things.  About the club and who is a frequent visitor there.  Stern, for instance. Some other players in this whole military industrial cesspool.  The club’s owned by a shell company that’s owned by a single-entity LLC, that’s owned by another, et cetera, et cetera.  But, if you work your way up the chain, you get to a company called AIM, which, if I’m not mistaken, is using a network of these seemingly legit enterprises, like your club, to launder ill-gotten gains from all kinds of black market deals.”
“Steve, you’re adorable.  Clueless sometimes, but adorable,” Bucky said fondly, using his arm around Steve’s shoulders to steer him into the building.
life. Their life together, his and Brock’s. He could do this.  It wasn’t like he hadn’t done worse, and it was only sex, and it didn’t really matter because Brock was fine with it, so it wasn’t cheating, not really…even if he couldn’t squelch the feeling that he was doing something wrong.
“Just like old times, Sir,” a disembodied British voice said from Tony’s phone.
“The King already had him,” Hammer said, his face pulling in surprise.
“Oh, yes.  Very, er…hard,” Tony grinned, then reached up to cup a hand around Steve’s cheek.  His thumb traced the seam of Steve’s mouth, then back again, stopping in the middle and giving Steve’s lip a slight tug down.  Steve’s mouth opened on a question, and Tony’s thumb slid inside, over Steve’s tongue, then out again to wet Steve’s lips.  Steve was so startled, he just stared dumbly for a moment, mouth agape, and Tony pushed his thumb back in, past the edge of Steve’s teeth, and held it there on Steve’s tongue. Not deep enough to be uncomfortable, but deep enough that it was almost uncomfortable, and the threat of it, the closeness to it, made the heat in Steve’s gut coil, tightening like a spring.
I'm sabrecmc on twitter, tumblr and discord.
“Not so much his later stuff, no,” Steve admitted, casting a quick glance down at the table. Tony followed his gaze to the Cap mug, still nearly full of too-sweet lemonade.  “But, I am familiar with his earlier work.”
He should have insisted on a Courtship. Even back in Steve’s day, a Bonding without a Courtship was frowned upon.  It usually meant either the couple was very, very rich or they’d, well, gotten to know each other a bit too much. That’s how his mother put it in her own delicate way when Steve was little.  Those two were too friendly with each other, she’d say. It had taken an embarrassing number of years for Steve to understand what she meant. Bucky had really taken the Mickey out of him for that one, Steve remembered with a wistful, deprecating smile.
“No kidding,” Kirk assured him.
Tony pushed the chair away from the desk.  Too hard. It wheeled backwards and banged against the wall, not that Tony seemed to much care, just frowned down at the chair with a sort of bemused surprise, as if only just realizing the chair was on wheels, but finding it delightful.
“Of course,” Steve agreed, drawing out the words.
“You look very fine, as well,” Steve replied, glancing up quickly at Tony and then down again, his stomach twisting.  He had never been good at this, not the way Bucky had been, all easy charm and glib tongue, at least until he got around Natasha.  He didn’t have Tony’s ease with words or comfort in saying them, but he knew how good he felt when Tony told him that he was beautiful, even though he shouldn’t care.  He did. He liked it. A lot. He wanted Tony to feel that way, too.
“Did you care when you agreed to have me Bonded to someone you’d never even met?” Tony demanded, the words hissing out through his teeth.
“That’s it.  Done. Settled. Come on, Kato, get your stuff, let’s go,” Tony announced, standing up and reaching for his phone.
“I’m just saying, he seems like a stand-up guy, Tony.  Not your run-of-the-mill good guy, either, but like one of those
“No, I don’t think we really need that,” Steve said in a flat tone, then slumped back in his seat and turned to gaze out the window with half-lidded eyes.  Tony looked away, biting his lip.
, Tony heard Jarvis’s voice echo in his head.
The praise flowed warm, like sunlight, dappling Steve’s skin, like Tony’s words always did.  A deep contentment stirred in his chest, easing away everything else except the vague sense of remembered pleasure, hazy and bright at the same time.
“Thank you--wait. I don’t recall giving you my name,” Steve said, frowning in confusion as a disquieting certainty that he had not trickled down his spine.
Tony pulled the belt tight around his waist, then paused, half-turning back towards where Steve watched him from the bed. “In the morning, we will continue as if this conversation never happened. I will forget it. So shall you. We will never speak of this again. It will be as it was.” Steve opened his mouth, words failing him, though he supposed he shouldn’t be so surprised. “I will give you this chance—this
Of course, Steve noticed him.  The universe wasn’t nearly kind enough to let an opportunity like that pass it by.
“Tony—” Steve started, stretching out a hand, reaching for Tony, for something, he didn’t know.
, any more.  The guy we were supposed to find and who found us, instead.  You’d just be a customer. Some guy who wanted to look at me, just like everyone else there.  No big deal.  I thought it would, maybe--I don’t know---change things or something.  Maybe I’d look back at it all, and it would be different, then.  It’s stupid. I know.”
“Yes, Your Highness,” Steve said slowly, keeping his eyes on Tony.  In his head, he had meant it as a jest, to remind Tony of what he said earlier, but it failed to come out that way.  Instead, he heard his voice sound rough, husky, and filled with the absolute certainty that he loved this man more than anything.  “Yes, Tony. Please.”
“James is fine,” Natasha assured him, as if peering into his mind.   “He has his own path to follow, Steve.  It may not always be yours.  But, he’ll always find his way back.  You know that, right?”
“Right, that’s what I—anyway, she’s one of those dancers over at Le Reve. Fantastic show, you should see it.  Really classy,” Hammer went on. “Steve, you ever think about doing one of those types of shows? Guess you don’t have to now, am I right or am I right?  Got one on the hook and reeled him in, not that I don’t get it,” he said, pantomiming a fishing motion with his hands. “Now, my mom, God rest her soul, she always said, don’t buy the cow when you can get the milk for free.  Or, a lot less than community property, anyway,” he laughed. “Sometimes the milk’s so good, you just wanna take that cow home with you, though, huh? Not that I don’t get it. I am out of likes on YouTube, you know what I mean? Right? Right?  I mean, hey. No judgment. I get it, I get it. Tony and me, we’re the same, see?”
“You wrote the chemical equation down on a cocktail napkin,” Coulson said.
“I did hear something about that a time or eight,” Tony called out from the dressing room.
Probably a rule about that, though.
“There was…I was…the ship I was on, it sank.  I almost went down with it, but somehow…somehow, I didn’t, and then…Next thing I remember, I was on some raider ship, shoved into a hold with more people than I could count,” Steve told him.  He didn’t tell him that when someone got sick, they dropped them overboard and how you could hear the splash, and how your stomach said that was a little more food for you.  He didn’t tell him about the sounds from the deck above, when the crew would take some of their captives upstairs, or what they looked like when they were returned, if they were, all hollow-eyed and broken.  Today was the day for half-truths and kind lies, he thought with a fissure of disgust curdling his stomach.  “We ended up at the port. The overseer from the slaver station there, he found me.  Then Sitwell came.”
Pepper, bless her, had arranged to have clothes sent over for them before they arrived yesterday, so they changed quickly and packed their clothes from the evening before into the bags.  Steve took a handful of the toiletries, which he swore were for the red-headed security guard at the club. Tony stuffed the two robes into his bag, which the little sign dangling from the hanger assured him he could do for the bargain price of $250 each, and threw in one of the towels for good measure, because reasons, he supposed.  He didn’t want to examine the impulse too closely, or he’d do something truly crazy like have an emotion or three.
Ross’ face pinched just slightly, but he nodded and smiled in greeting. It didn’t reach his eyes. “Of course. No harm will come to him, I assure you, my King,” Ross said, then looked over at Steve. “Even down here, we’ve heard of the King’s Prize. An honor to have you join us, Raj’Inama. If my men or I can assist you in any way, your attendant need only ask.”
A few buildings were still occupied, though, and the one he wanted turned out to have a nondescript, mostly windowless exterior. A metal door stood off-center on one side of the building. Above it hung a lightbulb inside a metal grate, humming lowly, and next to it—utterly out of place—was a security keypad, similar to the one outside Tony’s workshop.
“But you did! You did listen, Tony. Out there, when you were a prisoner and had no reason to trust any of us, you listened. You believed us, or believed us enough to know that something was wrong. Besides, I’ve been told I’m rather stubborn when it comes to things I believe in. What makes you so certain I would not have pressed my case until you heard it?” Steve demanded, attempting to find humor, but coming away lacking.
He’s dating, Tony thought numbly, running his thumb up and down over the stack of chips in front of him, feeling the ridges rub against his skin.  He asked Nat to set him up.  Barely a day after breaking it off with Tony.  Moving on awfully quickly there, Cap, Tony accused silently.  Anne from R&D…Anne from R&D…Anne from R&D needed to get a big new project.  At the Shanghai facility.  He looked up guiltily at the thought, though no one except Rhodey was paying him any mind.  Rhodey was watching him with a sharp, fierce look that held something too close to pity for Tony to return.
Maybe it was selfish, but he wanted to talk to Tony about it.  How scared he was.  How he nodded at what the doctors said, but didn’t really take it in because he just wanted to shove the reports at them and tell them it was their problem to deal with, they were doctors after all.  How he was maybe a little made at his mom for cutting across the street instead of waiting for the crosswalk, though he knew that wasn’t fair and he’d done it tons of times in New York himself and that he felt horribly guilty sometimes for the moments after the accident when he’d thought, as the doctors explained about traumatic brain injury, that it would’ve been easier if she’d died.  He needed someone to talk to about these things, and more than anything, he wanted it to be Tony.  But he also knew, deep down in his bones, that telling Tony about his mom’s situation was going to hurt Tony deeply.  He wasn’t sure how to explain it in a way that didn’t make Tony feel like he’d somehow taken advantage.  He needed time to think about the best way to tell him, and with the clean energy presentation before the SI Board coming up, Tony definitely did not need the distraction.  After, Steve thought.  After the dinner, I’ll tell him.  Let him get through the presentation and then…we’ll sit down and have a real talk.  About everything.  About how he felt, which he’d given up pretending wasn’t what it was, and what he wanted out of this.  That was just a few days away, and it would give him time to think through the least offensive way to talk to Tony about it.  The last thing he wanted was Tony feeling guilty about anything.  He had nothing to feel guilty about.  This whole thing had been Steve’s idea.  He’d gone into it willingly, at least where Tony was concerned.
an order.
“Yeah, you,” Steve replied, voice going soft.  He reached out and traced his fingertip down Tony’s cheek.  “You’re everything to me, you know that.  Keeping you safe, it’s—I have to do it, Tony.  And all those people out there, each of them, they’re someone’s you.  I couldn’t just keep turning a blind eye, waiting for someone else to fix it.  I never wanted you to be caught up in it, though.  I kept telling myself, with all the stories out there, they’d leave you alone. No one would dare. I was—it was selfish.  I’m sorry. I should have told you a long time ago.”
“I could look at you like this all day, every day, and never grow tired of it, I think,” Tony murmured.  “Mine,” he said, almost to himself, then started gently wiping the mess off Steve’s face.  “You’ll not come again tonight,” Tony told him as he cleaned Steve’s chest.  “Tomorrow, I think I should make good on keeping you in bed all day, what do you think, hmmm?” Tony asked idly, not seeming to expect an answer.  “Not to rest, mind you.  If you’re good, perhaps I’ll allow you to come when I’m done with you.  Would you like that?”
“If it means doing what’s right,” Steve said.  “I don’t…I don’t know about your politics here, or the costs of something like this but I do know Hydra.  I know what’s out there. This is the right thing to do.”
“Yes,” the alien replied.  “Mate is life.”
“Mom…” Tony breathed out, momentarily stunned.
He tried to get as much of his weight on the balls of his feet as he could.  The shackles at his ankles kept his legs splayed and the way they wrapped the thick chain around the metal rung in the ceiling kept him just far enough off the ground so he couldn’t quite get flat-footed.  Couldn’t move, other than to barely sway, not that it did anything except make his muscles burn.  Couldn’t quite stand.  He could get his toes under him, sometimes, but he had learned that made it worse, when his calves buckled and he couldn’t hold it, pulling his arms taut while he swung.  He was naked, save for the thin metal collar that circled his throat and marked his status. Lines of sweat trailed down his neck and back.
“They test us at the club,” Steve told him.  “Every two weeks. Just had mine. I’m clean, too. And…well. I haven’t since before my last deployment, to be honest,” Steve admitted.
“No reason to go. Unless you want to. I can have Happy drive you, if you do,” Tony said. He   tossed the towel aside and looked out towards the window where the faint lights of the Strip glowed from below, then dropped his gaze to his lap before looking up at Steve again. Steve stared at him in surprise, opened his mouth to say something and then closed it when no words of inspiration appeared in his head.
“Anthony’s always been so creative, hasn’t he, dear?  I think he gets that from me,” Maria said, finally breaking the heavy silence.
“Absolutely!  After New York, the demand for licensed merchandise has been huge.  The factories can’t keep up.  I mean, don’t get me wrong, you’re no Elsa costume, but still.  This stuff is a goldmine.  And fantastic goodwill for SI,” she finished.
His cock throbbed as he slipped his fingers out of his mouth.  He wanted to touch himself. Just a little. It wouldn’t take much and he could come.  A couple of strokes, that’s all, and he would be there.
Christ.  He
He looked down at the list again. Not because he needed to, really, but he liked seeing Tony’s scrawl there.  Soap, laundry detergent and socks.  Objectively, Steve could understand that he was being ridiculous, putting so much worry into getting the right things.  If Tony had really cared about any of that, he would have been specific.
he thought, but he said, “I’m going by tomorrow.  Sundays, that’s usually when I see her.”
On impulse, he grabbed his sketchbook and his box of charcoals, just on the off-chance that Tony needed to work.  He’d spent some time after their dinners sitting down in Tony’s workshop with him while he puttered, or, you know, invented world-changing technologies, whatever.  Mostly, Steve played with the bots or read on the tablet that appeared on the arm of the sofa the second night they’d found themselves down there.  But, he could always try sketching again, if inspiration struck Tony.  He hadn’t even opened the damn thing since New York, but almost as soon as he picked it up, his head started to fill with the images he could draw, careful hands soldering metal, wide, full lips curved into a rakish grin, a forehead creased with concentration, dark, intense eyes illuminated by the glow of the tablet.
Steve stared at him a moment longer, then some of the tension ebbed almost imperceptibly out of his shoulders. “Very well. But, if ever you wish to change your mind--”
“Thanks for destroying my car, by the way,” Tony said after a beat, waiting until Steve turned away from the window to face him.  “That’s like Lloyd Dobler-boombox-outside-your-window levels of some crazy romantic bullshit.”  Tony grinned, a wide, shit-eating smile that broke into a low laugh, tinged with a little bit of leftover amazement.
“What?” Steve said, instantly looking around the restaurant.
The physical feelings, yes, that, obviously, but also...without the worry that he would do something wrong or that he would humiliate himself and come too soon...with the thought that it might be okay, even
“I should really get going.  I need to coordinate with hotel security, go over the set up with their tech people—yes, I’m having our people double check it, don’t make the face,” she scolded lightly.  “Will that be all, Mr. Stark?” Pepper asked primly as she stood up.
“Of course not!  That would be—oh.  Yeah, I see what you did there,” Tony grimaced, recalling the whole completely reasonable and mature discussion of future offspring they’d had last night.  While he was knotted inside Steve.  Which some might question the validity of, big ticket item partner-discussion-wise, but it just made Steve so darn reasonable.   He remembered reading in a magazine article that being knotted brought clarity to the otherwise overly emotional Omega.  He looked down at Steve glaring up at him.  He strongly suspected that was probably not the correct answer here.
“I couldn’t…even then, I couldn’t let that go.  That was the place I’d been the happiest in my whole misbegotten life, and even if it was all a lie, I still couldn’t—they were putting in granite!  Granite, Steve. Can you imagine? Mass hysteria, I’m telling you,” Tony groused, looking down at his plate and feeling a bit abashed about the whole thing.
Steve came with a strangled cry. His body shuddered with the waves of pleasure as long, thick rope of his seed splattered the carpet. His breath came in heaves as the aftershocks crested through him. Tony’s tongue worked his hole as he shook, until finally he stopped shaking and his breath slowly steadied.
“Yes,” Tony cut him off, holding his fingers up to Steve’s mouth to silence him.  “I will give you one each day, and perhaps you shall know my regard for you as well as my people do.”
“As my beautiful, mysterious, yet completely silent concubine?” Tony asked with a laugh. Steve shot him a disgruntled look, making Tony’s smile go all the wider. “If only they knew,” he muttered, eyes twinkling.  “Yes, you can attend. I only kept you from joining me back at the Castle because of all the matter with Zola and Obie. Out here, they don’t exactly observe rules of Court anyway, and besides, who would gainsay me? But, tonight, as much as I would enjoy your presence, it would please me more if you rested.  Rand is just going to talk my ear off about more naval support for the guild ships, anyway. Which is fine, if he wants to add some additional taxes to our coffers to support it, but he complains bitterly about his portion as it is.”
“No, it’s—” Steve started, then grimaced and closed his eyes.  When he opened them, Tony’s gaze was darting over his face with clear concern, so he tried to shake off the malaise.  “I was looking at the men pushing the wheel. Thinking that it could have been me. That I could have just as easily ended up there,” Steve said in a flat voice.  He saw Tony wince and look away, blinking quickly and flattening his mouth into a thin line. “I was looking at the wheel, and then, I was in a battle. An ambush, really.  It was—bad,” Steve managed to choke out. “It was like I was there. I could see it. Smell it. Taste the smoke in my throat. Feel the blood on my hands. And then…then he was there, and I wasn’t fast enough.  I wasn’t fast enough,
The guards fell into step around them, Peran and Josiah among the retinue.  Steve quieted. Crossing the threshold of their chambers changed things. They could be different in there, in their rooms, but out here… out here, Tony was the King and Steve his concubine.  There were rules. Protocols. Steve chafed at the restrictions, and he thought Tony likely did, too, though Tony wore the trappings of it all far better than Steve thought he ever could. It wasn’t so hard, of course, to put on a show for the world out here.  The problem was, out here was an awfully big place, Steve thought with a sigh as they passed several servants who curtsied and bowed to their King and watched Steve with surreptitious gazes as he passed.
“Oh, leave it on,” Tony ordered, a grin spreading across his face.
“I know.  I know, and I’m so sorry, Tony,” Steve rushed out.  “I should have told you a long time ago. I didn’t know how to say it, and then…”
“Hey Happy!” Tony waved at his driver. “This is Steve.  He’s my Omega.  We’re bonded.”
The glittering hotels of the Strip slowly faded into the distance, and, seemingly, along with it, everything that set Vegas apart from any other post-Depression city, except that it had a parched, bland look that maybe only a desert landscape could pull off.  Neutral-colored houses and half-rented strip malls boasting the ubiquitous nail salon and dry cleaners sprang up next to the kind of gas stations where the key to the restroom came on the end of a chain attached to a brick or something, Tony guessed.
He needed to get out of here. He needed to get out of here before he did something he'd regret, like deciding not to care. He'd tried that with Steve already today, and playing Groundhog Day: Rejection Edition was getting old.
It’s more than that, isn’t it, a sinister voice deep inside his head hissed.  You
Tony tapped at the app, the drone spinning around Steve in a wide circle, then swooping closer, bobbing and dipping in the air in front of him.
“How romantic,” Steve deadpanned.”
“If anyone finds this recording, which, yeah, I know is fairly impossible, but, ah, anyway. Just in case.  Get it to Pepper Potts and James Rhodes for me, will you? Tell them...I want to tell them, don’t feel bad, okay?  Part of the journey is the end, right? Wish it was a different end, but, all in all, this--this life, this chance,
The door finally opened, just a crack.  Not so much open as not closed anymore.  Tony hesitantly peeked in, a sudden fear settling in his gut that he was going to find something terrible, but it was just Steve, somehow folded into the tiny space that passed for a bathroom.  He leaning over the small sink with one hand braced on the white ceramic edge.  The other was fisted against the wall, next to a crack that rand down from the ceiling in a light brown color against the white paint.  The door to the mirrored medicine cabinet was open, and an orange plastic bottle was in the sink next to the showerhead with the hose wrapped around it.  The white cap and a scattering of pills littered the floor next to the drain.
She smiled, wide and knowing.  “I think you’ve been fighting against everything they put in front of you since you got back, and you hate it.  You hate everything about all of this, but you can’t figure out if you hate yourself more.  Fighting for someone is a pretty good look on you, though.  You might try that more often.”
I hope you enjoy the chapter!
“Aw, honey, we have a song,” Tony said, tossing a smirk over his shoulder at Steve.
Except Tony was almost certain it was for his benefit.  He didn’t know why, except that it was Tesla, and Tony had brought it up, but this was the hill Sisyphus there across the table from him decided to push his rock up, so whatever.
than the rest of us, if I know Calvin--but she isn’t
“This is from Metropolis,” Tony recognized the iconic robot immediately.  “Did you…did you draw this?”
“I do,” Steve replied.  “I know… exactly what you’re saying.”
“Of course,” General Rhodes nodded, then jerked his head to one side to indicate that the others should disperse.  “I’ll see you then.”
“Threatening an officer. I know.  It was fantastic,” Tony grinned.  Rhodey smiled in return, for a moment, then the joviality faded from his face.
“You’re really bonded? Wow, that’s…I mean, that’s great, obviously.  I just never thought…but, wow.  Just wow, Tony.  I’m…happy for you.  Both of you.  We’ll have a proper ceremony and everything once you’re home,” Pepper said, sounding genuinely pleased.  Pepper was really very smart and thoughtful.  He didn’t give her the credit she deserved.  Brilliant, perceptive, wonderful Pepper.
But Captain America had changed that. In addition to what he accomplished on the battlefield, had done a lot to change perceptions about the role of Omegas in society.  Even with the serum and newfound strength and agility, the serum hadn’t altered his innate personality.  Until then, until him, it would never have crossed the minds of most Alphas and Betas that an Omega would ever be able to lead, to command, to be daring and courageous and all those other traits the Captain had exemplified in spades.  It would be too simplistic, Tony knew, to say that Captain America had been responsible for the shift in perceptions about Omegas that had occurred over the seventy or so years since then, but he had certainly gone a long way to making those changes a possibility instead of a pipe dream.
“Right,” Steve agreed after a moment, though he could hear the way his voice wavered.  “Right, that’s…yeah.”
“I’d pay good money to see it go down, though, not gonna lie,” Bucky sighed forlornly as he leaned against the outside of a bus stop shelter.
“I heard that,” Steve chimed in, turning his head enough to smile fondly at Tony.  “Those fish are dinner one day.”
“Who forges marriage certificates,” Steve reminded him.
He slid out of the booth and stood, following Steve outside into the low light of the evening. Stores had turned on their lighted signs, sending a strange, oddly beautiful rainbow of colors reflected on the pavement and pools of water. Or maybe he was just waxing poetic because of reasons.
“One moment,” the voice said, and music clicked on in Steve’s ear while he waited.  He was fairly certain she had just put him on hold and wasn’t actually checking with anyone at this point.  He figured he’d called enough times, they probably had his number memorized.
His plans for the rest of the evening had been totally shot by his detour to Marketing.  Fury was probably going to give him a hard time for missing the intelligence briefing, but he couldn’t bring himself to care.  Pulling out his sketchbook and pencils, Steve began sketching, hesitantly at first, then with firmer and more confident strokes. This time, this one time, he was going to get it right.  Capture whatever that was that made Tony into the person Steve saw.  Maybe it was the knowledge that if he didn’t do it right, someone else would get the job, Steve had never shied from competition, or maybe it was just the desire to show Deirdre and everyone else what they had been missing, too distracted by shiny armor, that it was Tony himself that was the superhero.  No armor had made the call to haul a nuke into space on one Hulk fly-ball save from a one-way trip.  Just a man.  An amazing, incredible, obnoxious, brilliant, annoying, funny and never dull man, but just a man nonetheless.
“Really?” Cam asked, wide-eyed. “What is it?”
signed anything,” Brock harrumphed, shrugging his shoulders.  “You're the one with the fancy legal thing, ‘cause you got the money.  I looked it up.  Has to be, what’d they call it?  Big legal word.  Consideration, that’s it,” he said, snapping his fingers.  “And I didn’t get any, so,” he shrugged again, lifting his hands.
Tony turned off the engine and glanced over at Steve, who sat still for a moment, like he was girding himself for something, then he reached for the car door.  A blast of chilled, evening wind, damp from the plump clouds that hovered near the tops of the mountains, hit Tony in the face as Steve climbed out of the Audi and slammed the door behind him.
“You sure?” Rollins asked.
,” Steve reiterated, catching Tony’s expression.  “Really. I’m actually pretty good at that part, you know,” he chuckled lowly, then paused and looked down at his hands.  “I’m sorry I wasn’t here, Tony. I shouldn’t have left. I got a few blocks away and figured that out, but…anyway, I’m sorry.”
“You’re back!” an excited voice shouted from one of the rooms to Steve’s left.  He turned and immediately felt himself relax as Cam half ran into the room.  “Isn’t it great?  Can you believe this?  Even the chamberpot is gold!”
“It’s you. Isn’t it?  Iron Man,” Steve breathed out, reaching out for Tony before he quite realized what he was doing.  “Oh, God. It was always you. Tony...Tony, I--”
“When did this turn into a block party, anyway?” Tony asked rhetorically while Rhodey unloaded the bags onto the kitchen counter.   The tenant/neighbor was nonchalantly holding onto another bag with a jar of peanut butter, a container of ramen noodles and what looked like a year’s worth of paprika pressed against the plastic by the bulk of the other items that were stuffed into it.  Well, Tony thought, with a bit of a grin at the young man’s boldness.  At least he knew where his change had gone.
“---really sticking it to the Army in all kinds of ways---“
He stared up at the imposing façade, with its eagle symbol and cordon of concrete posts that protected the entrance.  It wasn’t that long ago that he’d walked through the doors with his parents in tow, wearing a wrinkled suit and a layer of anxiety that vibrated through him until he thought he would come apart.  Not all at once.  Just a piece here and a piece there, until someone finally noticed there wasn’t anything left of him.
“Coulson’s on his way,” Steve told him in that same amiable manner.
Steve breathed out, wide eyes roaming over the armor as his cock rose to stand against the curve of his stomach. Steve stepped forward on somewhat wobbly legs and wrapped his arms around Tony, burying his head in the crook of Tony’s shoulder. “When I first saw you, you were like this,” Steve whispered. “Shiny,” Steve huffed out a low laugh. “I thought you were beautiful. Wanted you then. Wanted to touch you, feel you. Wanted to be yours.”
He would make Tony happy, or, at least, he
“Should I…should I go now?” Steve asked, finally turning back to the King when there was only silence.
“Oh, God, you’re not seriously going to…you love my gadgets.  Come on, tell me how much you love it.  I know you do,” Tony said with more confidence than he felt.  “Look, your recorder is broken anyway,” Tony pointed out.
Tony could feel his face heat with embarrassment as Steve frowned down at his phone.
“Aw, you read the footnotes!” Tony said, pleased at Fury’s attention to detail.
“Howard’s study is just off the billiards room,” she reminded him, though he had already looked at the mansion’s layout, so he knew where every room was located. Knew the security measures.  Knew the exits. Knew where they would likely have guards stationed to usher guests away from private areas. Knew where the safe was. Knew its lock and how to bypass it, at least if what the pencil-thin man in the white coat at SHIELD said was true.  “He got squirrely about things after SHIELD took the Tesseract away, you know. Not that I blame him. National Security. I’ve heard that before,” she harrumphed. “If they exist, whatever plans or notes Howard had for the prototype should be in there. As soon as you have them, find me, and I’ll make my excuses.  Obadiah knows I hate these things, anyway.”
“Pretty sure I’m actually early,” Steve said, drinking in the sight of the man before him. He had thought he could call Tony’s image up in his mind at will, but now, seeing the man this close, he realized he had never even managed to come close. Looking at Tony was a bit like waking up from a deep sleep to find the sun directly overhead, almost leaving him glare-blind in its intensity, startling every part of him to a kind of awareness he hadn’t known he was lacking. Steve stayed as he was, both because Tony had once told him he was not to kneel to him and because he wasn’t sure if he could get up again if he did.
She had been the one to latch onto Steve right away, always following him around with her big, silent eyes, watching everything he was doing and not missing a single step.  It had been Lizzie he supposed he was thinking of the most that day when Angie’s husband showed up with a couple of his kinfolk and friends.  They had all gone on home a bit later and hadn’t come back, and Steve put away the shield for good, burying it and his armor, his sword, and the memories that went with them in the back field, by the well, under that big oak.  He missed it sometimes. Especially now.  He missed a lot of things, though, and some things were best left buried.
“It isn’t easy to find these people, and sometimes, where we find them can surprise even me.  Places we weren’t even really looking.  Not for that, anyway.  But, I find that sometimes, all someone needs to be great is someone to believe they can be,” Fury said.
“Tony, what--” Steve started.
“How…how did he die?” Tony asked carefully.  He toed at the flecks of gravel under his shoe and watched the sand and dust float through the car’s headlights.  “I’m sorry. I shouldn’t…it isn’t my business.  You don’t have to talk about it.”
“Tony,” Steve interrupted.  “Slow down.  Hey, it’s okay,” Steve soothed.  “You think I don’t know you work a lot or get ideas in the middle of the night?  Or the, ah…middle of other things?”
Steve’s words burst through Tony with a physical force that was almost painful.  His eyes stung and his vision blurred.  There was a lump in his throat that he couldn’t swallow past, but it didn’t matter.  Steve.
Steve’s own words, reflected back to him.  God, what a mess, he thought, feeling his chin dip down to his chest and his eyes drift shut.    “It wasn’t your fault,” Steve said.
“You’re easy to talk to, you know that, Shellhead?  I was never very good at just talking to most people.  Didn’t know what to say, I guess. In the War, it seemed like all we talked about was home at first and then...we just sort of stopped talking.  I don’t know,” Steve said, drifting a bit as he looked out at the sunrise.
“If you asked it of me?  You mean…like if we were sparring?” Steve asked, frowning at Tony in confusion.
He wasn’t sure why Steve’s lack of acknowledgment rankled so much.  He should probably be glad of it, all things considered.  They had ended things on good enough terms, he supposed, though it had been hard to tell exactly how things were going to fall since Tony had spent the three days until the call came in about Loki living off takeout and caffeine in the workshop building the Mark…whatever the fuck it was he was on now.
“You make things better, and I destroy them. Life and death,” Steve said flatly.
“There were men here. I didn’t know them.  I should have realized then, I suppose. I thought they were my father’s friends, come to pay their respects or—I don’t know.  I didn’t think,” Tony told Steve, who watched him with the same impassive frown.  “He gave me something to drink.  Obie, I mean. I don’t know what was in it. I guess I should probably be grateful for it, though,” Tony said, mouth twisting into a grimace.  He closed his eyes and breathed out.  Laughter filled his mind, though not the kind that held any real mirth, just a shared cruelty.  Flashes of other things would come sometimes, but it was the laughter he remembered above all of it.  They had laughed.  It wasn’t the worst of it, he supposed, but he couldn’t quite seem to forget how it had sounded to be laughed at like that, when he was terrified and powerless, and it had all amounted to nothing but a jest for them.
“Remember, be nice.  Smile for him.  Tell him how excited you are.  Show him what a good boy you are, how polite.  Let him talk.  They like it when  you listen.  Be impressed.  Tell him what an honor this is that he’s picked you,” his mother was saying, though he’d heard it enough times over the past couple of days he could have recited it backwards.
“No fucking kidding with that, Jesus, talk about committment,” Tony retorted, then grimaced. “Sorry, I’m just...just trying to wrap my head around this, you know?”  He stopped, scrubbed both hands over his face, then walked forward a few stops and leaned against one of the darkened consoles. “So...if you were in cryo, how did you find me?”
“Uh-huh,” Bruce said noncommittally, but he was watching Tony with a sharp, keen gaze.
That’s what Sam had asked, and Steve...he hadn’t been able to come up with a good answer.  That’s what had set Bucky off. This time.  Which, okay, yeah, he should have an answer for that.
his mind screamed with an almost overwhelming insistence
Tony tossed the cloth away, but kept a hand on Steve’s lower back where it curved.  The weight was nice.  Like being held, Steve thought.
“Just think about that when you’re on your way back,” Tony said with a grin.  Steve had no doubt he would be.
Mitchell guffawed and grabbed Griff by the shoulders, giving him a shake.  “Aww, Griffy, remember Kamdesh?  You went through your water ration in like six hours, man.  And that was one fucked up mission.”
“Yes, I did. I do,” Steve said.  “Enough for what? Tony, if there is some power here, that’s all the more reason we shouldn’t be here, don’t you see, this place, it’s--”
So not alone.
“Covi, you’re up,” Tony grinned and announced to the drone, which dutifully sparked to life and, free of the ties that had held it down, floated into the air on four sets of small, spinning blades on each of its arms.  “Don’t let me down, girl,” Tony bent down and whispered encouragingly to the drone, earning an eye roll from Rhodey.
Maybe these were the things those Omegas, with their shadowed eyes and dark lips, had been doing.  Had they felt this way, too?  Getting made up, sliding into those garments, hoping they looked beautiful, putting themselves on display like that?  Half embarrassment, half longing, all mingled together in some kind of haze?  Tony licked his lips.  His heart was pounding in his chest.  His cock was throbbing it’s own rhythm, straining against the wet panties.  Slick leaked out of his ass, dampening the strip of lace that was tucked between his cheeks until it spread out at the top and arched high over his thighs.  If he moved just so, the wet strip of lace rubbed over his hole, almost painfully, though the good side of pain.  His hips jerked.  Another spurt of slick coated the crevasse of his ass, then dripped down onto his thighs, just above where the stockings stopped.
Technically, if you wanted to be really, incredibly, hyper-technical about things...technically, Tony had just spent God knows how much of Steve's money on things for himself without so much as consulting Steve about it. People who were not quite as reasonable as, well, no one in existence who wasn't either a Buddhist monk or possibly Ben Wyatt, might be a tad upset about that. Might find that a bit off-putting from their shiny, new Omega.
“Stane’s dirty,” Tony said, interrupting Steve’s thoughts and apparently ignoring his attempt at a neutral topic of conversation.  “If who I think is at the top of this is involved, then he’s even worse.   The really bad kind of worse, and this coming from someone Stane has already tried to kill once,” Tony told him, dark eyes intent on Steve.  “I’ve known him my whole life.  There were times he was more of a father to me than my old man, truth be told.  Or I thought he was.  Hell, I rode on his shoulders when I was a kid, for Christ’s sake.  That’s the kind of man we’re dealing with.  If you were smart, you’d take what I assure you would be the world’s best alimony deal and run.”
“Tony,” Steve said, drawing out the word in a gentle sigh.  “I’m just…I’m saying I’ve taken care of that.  You.  I should’ve mentioned it before, but. Well.  I didn’t.  I don’t know why.  It didn’t come up, or—I didn’t want to talk about it, I guess.  That—I’m trying not to do that.  Not talk about things.  It’s hard sometimes, but…anyway, look, if anything happens to me, you’ll have enough money to do what you want, if you’re careful, without going back to your parents.  Technically, they can’t make you, now that you’ve been Bonded.  If you wanted to Bond again, well.  That’d be up to you.  But, only if you wanted to.  You don’t need to worry about that, okay?”
“At least you’ll know,” Tony said, the words coming out husky and dry, and when had the room gotten that quiet and still, where he could hear his heart beating in his ears and practically feel the blood rushing through his body?
“Hi,” Steve said with a bright grin.
“Ah!  Yes!” Cam rushed out excitedly and waved to get the baker’s attention.  One of the guards escorted her forward, and Cam dumped a small mountain of coins in her hand, explaining Steve’s request.  She grinned at Steve, a gap-toothed, yellow smile that still managed to take years off and soften her face to something that might have been lovely once, and bowed her head, thanking him effusively as she turned back to the crowd and held her basket open, motioning the children forward.
Eventually, he stopped feeling the pain.  He thought that might be worse, in some ways.  His tongue had grown thick in his mouth.  He kept stumbling, finally going to a knee in the dirt and then jerked forward on his elbows in the mud as the wagon ground to a halt.
Except tonight, when he was apparently going to just watch the train wreck happen.
“Don’t know about that. Got the shit kicked out of me a lot,” Steve admitted.  “That time, let’s see…fat lip.  Bloody nose.  The works. Bucky—he kind of saved me.   Happened a lot, actually.  Hip pulling me out of trouble. We’ve sort of known each other forever.  Buck says I woke him up coughing in the hospital nursery. Says he’s been hollering at me ever since.  That’s not--he’s actually a little over a year older, not that it—I mean.  Anyway.  He showed up.  Gave the guy a what-for.   I used to think he had some sixth sense for when I was in trouble, but he swears it was just pretty much going to be a given, so law of probabilities and all that.  Got into a lot of fights,” Steve explained with a grimace and another shrug that was trying for nonchalant and failing spectacularly.
“Going to need words, Steve,” Tony urged.
“That does sound like a good plan.  Doesn’t it?  What do you think?” another voice said, this one a lot deeper and steadier than the other two.
How he was supposed to act probably involved getting his ass out of bed and making something at least semi-edible for his Alpha prior to lunch, which was on his list of Things He Wanted to Do somewhere below waxing and day-long self-help seminars.
His cock was almost fully hard now, aching to be touched, straining at the denial.  His hands twitched across his stomach, skimming over the skin, the temptation digging a pit of liquid fire in his belly.  He wanted to touch himself more than he would have thought possible a moment ago. He craved it. It was, all of a sudden, all he could think about.  What it would feel like to glide his hand over his shaft. The burn of skin on skin, too hard, too rough, maybe he could use spit, something, anything, but just touch there.  Rub the head, the way he liked. Stretch the foreskin out a bit, just until he could feel it. The images filled his head, one after the other, the knowledge of how it would feel, the ecstasy of it, the demand for release, all pounded through him, crackling under his skin, like lightning crystalizing the sand into bursts of brilliant energy held forever stagnant.
“Nah, me and Pepper, we’re good. I mean, it didn’t work out, us together.  For a lot of reasons.  Mostly on me,” Tony said as they strolled.  He took another bite of cheesecake from the box and made a happy, humming sound that turned into a laugh as he caught Steve watching him with a sort of dazed intentness.  Soldier boy was into him, no doubt about it, he thought, holding the fork between his lips and slide it out slowly, then grinned wickedly at Steve, who blinked and shook his head a bit, letting out a short of shaky, deprecating chuckle.
“Tony, please,” Steve said.  “You don’t know what it looked like from this side.” Tony sighed, flattening his mouth and giving Steve a disgruntled look.
Freedom demanded the highest measure of devotion, and it did not promise happiness in its wake.  Only the possibility.  But, it was the only place where that possibility truly existed.
“See? See?  He’s fine.  And it wasn’t even our fault, really.  Like he said, he tripped and all.  And we weren’t going to hurt him or nothing, no Sir.  Fake gun, see?” Dominic stammered in an urgent, pleading tone that seemed to run the words together into one long, supercalifrageilistic sentence.
“Steve, you see?  You see what he’s like? Why do I put up with this?” Tony asked with a wide grin. He looked back at Steve again, his face softening slightly.
“You wrote an equation on my chest,” Steve reminded him. “In permanent marker. It wouldn’t come off for like a week and a half.”
“Pepper said I couldn’t fire him until I did,” Tony shrugged.
“Yeah, that’s a hard no, gotcha,” Tony agreed, squelching up his face with a look of regret.  The elevator slid open, and they both stepped in, though Steve did manage one last look at Bucky, who mimed an obscene gesture with his hand and tongue, then gave Steve a thumbs’ up sign.  Steve sighed and flattened his mouth into a line as the doors closed, and he was alone with Tony again.
“Donwanna talk,” Tony mumbled petulantly. “No talking.  Or we’ll talk later.  Much, much later.  Want…you.  I want you.  You, just like this.  You’re great. Fantastic.  Amazing.  Perfect.  Can we just—.  And wait, there are no options.  No, no options.  None. We don’t need to talk about them because there aren’t any,” Tony said, and he could hear the pitch of his voice approaching panic because now Steve was talking about options and by ‘options’ he meant ways that Steve could leave Tony, but that wasn’t possible, ergo there were no options.  That was just logic, really.
Thank you to my wonderful readers, who have waited so long for an update.  I hope in the middle of all this craziness, you are doing well and this gives you a tiny pick-up.
“Knock yourself out,” Tony called out over his shoulder as he disappeared through the French doors.
“How...how long have you been looking for them?” Tony asked
“Mud,” Steve replied.  “I’ve seen those get stuck more times than I can count, and under that weight,” Steve said, nodding at the parchment, “The wheels will sink.”
“No one told me we were having game night,” Tony objected, sauntering over to the table.  Obviously, the group had also been concerned about Steve, too.  Not that game night was an unheard of event, just that this was pretty clearly an attempt to make sure Steve wasn’t being left to his own devices.  Which was good.  It wasn’t like it had to just be him to worry about Steve.  Certainly, they were all going to try their best to help him adjust, which helped explain why Steve hadn’t sought him out.  Or, it could explain that, anyway.  You know, we’ll just say it explains it, Tony decided.   Still, pretty rude of them not to even--
“Tonight,” Tony conceded with a soft sigh.
“Mr. Stark,” the boxman said in greeting when Tony sidled up to the table.  He picked up a stack of chips and placed them on the ‘Pass’ line.The stickman pushed the dice boat with six dice towards Tony, and Tony selected two, then shook them a bit in his fist and held his hand up to Steve.
The growth up here was thick and old.  Fallen logs were hollowed out and half reclaimed by the forest.  Moss gathered in patches on the ground and covered the trunks of trees like a strange grass.  It made him think of his mother’s tales of the forest folk who could enter the trees through the moss and would follow you home if you cut them down.
methods.  But, we need you.  The world needs you.  Now, it’s damn near past time for you to get with that program, Cap.  You want Stark and your little cabin or whatever? Fine. The world’s going to give you that, because we need you.  You get my drift?”
Steve ducked his head and rubbed at the stinging warmth on his cheek with the ball of his wrist. “It’s--” he broke off, lifting his eyes to Tony’s.  “Tony, wh--what are you doing here?” he asked again instead.
“My Alpha’s got a mile-wide impulsive streak and goes for the big gesture when, you know, words or perhaps a demonstrative hand gesture would’ve been fine,” Tony sniped good-naturedly, sending a small smile over his shoulder at Steve, who canted his head to one side with a half-grin and shrugged. “Car’s totaled.  Not my fault.”
“Got to see a man about a divorce,” Rhodey responded, clapping his hands together in front of him.  “Figured we’d celebrate Tony’s re-newfound freedom in style tonight.”
“Well, then.  Seems you have a decision to make, my boy,” Obie smirked.  “Is your little pet project worth risking that?”
“No,” Maria cut in.  Peggy’s mouth fell shut and she craned her head away, looking out over the lake.
“They took you from me.  They took you, and I couldn’t find you,” Steve husked out.  The hand on Tony’s neck flexed, not hard, not really, but hard enough Tony could feel the power there.  He leaned into it, feeling Steve’s thumb rub soothingly against the pulse point there.  “Three months.  Three months.  I couldn’t eat.  I couldn’t sleep.  All I could think about was if you were hurt.  Or scared.  Or—“ he stopped, looked away.  One hand dropped to his leg, rubbing at the top of his thigh.  Tony covered Steve’s hand with his own, stilling the motion, then locking his fingers between Steve’s.
. Never for me.”
Steve nodded, then went to his room to change.  Bucky was holed up on the bed amidst a stack of pillows that almost looked like a fort and an ice bucket full of some kind of fancy import beer he’d probably ordered from room service courtesy of Tony.   He was currently watching a Spanish language home shopping channel on the room’s flatscreen with a disturbing amount of interest.
“What...ah, what was that with the--with the finger, there, huh?”  Tony managed. “Wait, that sounded wrong, what--where--who?” Tony paused, regrouped, and gave the alien what he hoped was a pointed look. “Okay, so, I have questions.”
Someone was walking through the crowd selling roasted nuts and small squares of gingerbread.  The scents wafted through his nose as they passed, making him think, for a moment, of home, where chestnuts popping over the flames meant boughs of pine strung over doors and empty shoes left in front of the hearth in the hopes that Sanniklaus would leave gifts behind, if you had been good.  Steve caught Cam’s eye and nodded towards the woman with her basket of goodies.
Tony breathed out a laugh, half relief and half something else, something warm filling him, pooling in his stomach.  “That thought has occurred to me from time to time.”
“He wants the company, not me.  Who can blame him? So.  So, we’re going to do that.  The company.  I can do that for hi—us.  Not exactly what I want, but since when do I get what I want?  I can’t make him…you know, feel the same, can I?” Tony replied numbly, looking down at this desk.  “Besides, he…maybe, he,” Tony stammered, brain flatlining as he tried to pick out words he desperately didn’t want to say.  “I think maybe he,” Tony began, sucking in a deep, bracing breath that went down cold into his chest like it might freeze his heart if he didn’t exhale.  “Maybe, there might be someone else.  I don’t know.  He doesn’t…you know. With me.  We don’t, I mean. We haven’t. So,” Tony stopped, clearing his throat roughly and keeping his gaze fixed on his computer screen, where a brightly-colored pop-art version of Neil DeGrasse Tyson provided the occasional quote of wisdom.  “There’s that.”
“So,” Steve said, totally unsure now what he had done and trying to regroup before Tony fled from his presence for whatever reason, “I just thought that the poster, I mean, well, it should be you, right?  Because you are Iron Man.  You, I mean, not the suit,” and now he was just rambling, but he couldn’t seem to stop himself.  “And I just thought it would be better, you know, if people understood that…that someone who doesn’t have powers or serum or whatever can be a hero with just smarts and guts can be so brave, and…” and oh God, he was just making it worse, wasn’t he?  By the look on Tony’s face, that was a definite yes.  Unable to help himself and trying desperately to explain, Steve went on, “And, I don’t know, it just seemed wrong to only show the suit, but then I figured I should really talk to you and not just Deirdre because maybe you wanted it that way---“ and for Pete’s sake just stop Rogers.  He clamped his jaw shut on whatever other words his brain wanted to supply.
It wouldn’t be long now, he knew. Tony had already gotten Steve’s text.  Steve would be home soon, and Tony would be…well, like
.  What was happening that was worth capturing on precious film.  He thought he understood that better, now, too.  If he had a picture of Yinsen, he’d want one of him playing their makeshift backgammon or working with the few precious tools they had been given.
“I…” Steve started, then let out a long breath.  “I know.” He shook his head and squeezed his eyes shut for a quick moment.
“Oh, God, fuck me, that’s gorgeous, baby, yeah, let it happen, there you go,” Tony chanted as he thrust.  As his climax faded, Steve felt like his body seemed to go boneless. Tony let go of Steve’s cock, and hefted one of Steve’s knees up, balancing it on his shoulder as he pounded hard into Steve’s body.  Steve felt open, taken,
“Fine,” Tony said, glancing quickly at Rhodes before looking back at Steve.  “We’re fine. Just not used to being up this high.”
It was possible he was reading too much into the placement of swimming trunks.  He mentally sighed and took the proffered trunks, quickly shucking off his shoes and leaving his clothes in a pile.  He’d gotten over whatever embarrassment he might have had around Tony by now.  In fact, he rather enjoyed the way Tony’s eyes went dark and he got all still and quiet as he watched Steve undress.  This was Tony’s home and he was here on Tony’s dime, so to speak, and there was always some strange undercurrent there where everything flowed from Tony, but here, in the bedroom, when it was just the two of them, it was like everything reversed itself.
He kept measuring things by some entirely different scale, probably because he wanted to see more in these gestures than was really there.  To make all this something it wasn’t.  To make him something he wasn’t.
“He didn’t move in.  We had dinner.  We were talking and then…my back, and Tony…he helped,” Steve explained.  “Am I fired?”
“And why, exactly, should it be me?  Hmmm?  Do tell,” Natasha asked, coming to stand in front of Tony with her arms crossed over her chest.
“Steve said you and Nat had your wedding up there,” Tony said.  “He seemed…he seemed to like that.  The whole farm thing.  Said it was nice.”
“Rhodey, hon, have you been testing the Air Force’s high altitude breathing equipment again?” Tony asked in confusion.  “You literally just saw him the other night at the club.   And then apparently later, when you arranged a little private party for me.  Thanks again for the thought by the way.  Admittedly, ot the best timing ever, but I’m not holding that against you.”
“Fine,” Tony replied.  “Why wouldn’t everything be fine?”  Tony smiled, but it didn’t reach his eyes.  Steve was suddenly reminded of something he and Clint had watched on the Discovery Channel.  A shark’s smile with dead pools for eyes.  Ok, so Tony didn’t want to talk about it, at least not with Steve.
It wasn’t going to be okay.  It wasn’t going to be okay at all.  He’d lost Steve the moment those weapons were used to kill the people in Steve’s unit.  He lost Steve as soon as Barnes’ lost an arm to something stamped with Tony’s name. It was just that he was only now getting the chance to realize it, like some telegram that arrives months after a calamity delivering terrible news of a grief that had already been there without anyone knowing it.  It was what he deserved, if he was honest with himself. How many people had died because of him? Could he really begrudge it if the universe wanted to dangle this with Steve in front of him only to yank it away? Seemed more than fair, really, given what everyone else he touched in this debacle had lost.   The soldiers in the convoy, the people in Gulmira, countless, faceless others.
“I can imagine you want to do that a lot,” Steve said, half-apologetically.
“I’m not hungry,” Tony replied.  “Water is fine.”  Mostly, he just wanted something to hold in his hands, but his throat was parched, and he kept having to clear it, and drinking gave him something to do that wasn’t talking.  Always a plus for his interpersonal relations, as pretty much anyone could attest.  Rogers picked up a bottle off the credenza and carried it around the table, holding it out in front of him towards Tony.
“How much longer until we get there?” Cam asked, glancing out the window again as Steve chewed.
Absently, Steve stroked one hand over his nipple, sucking in a breath at the sudden sensation. With the other hand he reached up and gave the other peak a light twist.  His cock twitched, angling upward, a line of fluid trailing from the tip. Steve hissed out a breath.
Calm.
“Time Magazine’s Man of the Year is known throughout the world as a genius inventor, a billionaire playboy who will tell you he is most proud of his philanthropic efforts, which are as varied as his company’s investments…” Jarvis intoned over the room’s speakers.
“Yes.  Yes, well, you understand that we have a reputation to uphold with our clients. They expect to have the evening we promise them and we can’t have our people making their own deals at the last minute.  It’s bad for business, Steve,” Ms. Romanov said tersely.
“Where are we going?” Steve asked, unable to resist any longer.
“I don’t…I don’t follow,” Steve said, utterly confused.
what Tony fantasized about?  About…Steve.  Like…this?  He still couldn’t wrap his head around what he was witnessing.
“No, no, of course not, but,” Steve broke off, glancing again towards the room. “Will someone… I mean… is someone going to...”
It went on like that for a few paragraphs, sharing meaningless details of Army life that amounted to little more than a glimpse of what it must have been like, before it ended with Steve’s scrawled signature at the bottom. Clearly written because he had to, though Tony couldn’t help a slight, wavering grin at the tank thing.
“On your knees, then,” Tony told him.  He was breathing hard, too, Steve noted.  His eyes were dark pools, and curl stuck to his forehead where it had dampened.  Steve managed to sit up and then stared dumbly at Tony for a moment, until Tony smiled, soft and tremulous, and wrapped an arm around Steve’s waist to help him to his knees and get him turned around.  Then, Tony was tearing open the ties of his breeches and pulling his cock out, dark red with strain and leaking a path of fluid from the head.  He shimmied over to the table by the bed and applied oil to himself, then laid down on the bed and lazily stroked a hand up and down his cock as Steve’s eyes tracked the movement.
“Ha! I knew you were into me,” Tony said, snapping his fingers at Steve in triumph.  “You, with your disapproving face that I may or may not have found also sort of insanely hot.  You thought I was an entitled ass. Admittedly, not totally off the mark on that one, I think we can all agree.  But, you were totally into me.  I knew it.  Rhodey owes me a dollar. Can I call him?  I want to call him.  He said not to interrupt him while he was meeting with the base CO, but I feel like this should fall under some kind of emergency exception.”
“Centuries ago, so the story goes, some ancestor of mine had a concubine whom he favored above all others. So overcome by his devotion, the king took his own heart, wrapped it in gold and placed it around the concubine’s neck,” Tony began in a low rasp.  Steve tried to find Tony’s face in the dark, but couldn’t see anything except a maw of darkness.  He thought that might be by design.  “No one, you see, save the king, could speak the concubine’s name, so they called the concubine Raj’Inama.  The King’s Prize.  No one was allowed to look upon the concubine’s face unveiled, or suffer blinding, and to touch meant the loss of the hand.  An old story,” he continued, voice rising a bit in the telling.  “Romanticized over time, no doubt. Probably very little of it true, and certainly, even if some of it carried truth, we are not so barbaric today.  But…you are mine.  You—you please me.  In a way that I did not expect to ever find.   I thought I had, once before, long ago, when I was a stupid boy.  I’ve no doubt that’s why Zola chose you, though he had little idea what he was giving me.”
The King made a small sound that felt like disdain, the pushed his chair back and got up from the table, kicking one of the miniature knights that had fallen to the floor out of the way as he walked over to stand in front of where Steve knelt.  Fingers ghosted over Steve’s cheek, then settled under his chin and lifted with a firm, insistent pressure.  Steve looked up.
“Three times. Okay,” Steve nodded, sucking in a sharp breath. He was really doing this. Somehow, the whole…
Steve sighed and shrugged on the robe, then glanced over to where Tony was climbing up a ladder that extended down into the water from the platform that held the bellows.  One of the slaves hurried forward to assist with removing the helmet, revealing Tony’s grinning face.  He waved at Steve and Cam, then held up a netted bag full of shells and rocks and whatever struck his fancy while he plodded across the seafloor.  It wasn’t really about those things, of course, just being able to do the impossible.  To look at some wall everyone else accepted as the way of things and find a path around it.  Or, through it, Steve mentally corrected.  That was Tony.  Always looking to what could be done and ignoring the notion that anything could not. Steve watched him undo the buckles that held the leather suit in place, then shimmy out of it, abandoning it to be dried out for the next time he decided to thumb his nose at the way things were meant to be.
The rest of the room, at least what he could see of it, was just as strange.  Dark blue walls surrounded him in an oval. They shimmered, almost like they were reflective, but he couldn’t see any shapes moving across them.  He seemed to be elevated, on some kind of table made of the not-gel, at least from what he could see of it from his prone position, though the whole thing seemed encased by an edging of some type of metal or other hard surface that raised up just slightly above the not-gel blanket and tilted at angles. Screens, Tony thought, and for some reason, that thought disturbed him almost as much as anything else about this.
“Right, because you’re all about honesty, Rogers.  I’ve seen your service record.  The thing practically glowed red, white and blue,” Tony ground out as his head appeared over the edge of the bunk above Steve’s, dark hair close-cropped now, face clean shaven.  Steve could still remember the man who had shown up that first day, impeccably trimmed goatee and perfectly styled hair, looking bewildered and hiding his utter terror behind a grin and too many fast words.
“Nothing to fear, Small Hands,” Tony said.  “They have done this for centuries, isn’t that true, Wendell?”
“Right. Not my point. A, ‘Hey, I’m about to jump into thin air, can I get an assist?’ is a thing that normal people say. Normal people say this, and then they jump,” Tony argued, following in Steve’s wake out of the airlock.
Steve’s hands were already on his uniform, all but tearing the top part off and tossing it to the side, then opening the fly and pulling his cock out.  Tony’s mouth watered at the sight of it.  Thick and long, a deep purpled-red, the long vein on the underside pulsing as the tip leaked shiny rivulets of fluid.  He’d never thought of cocks being beautiful, but Steve’s was, and the knothead at the end, all bulbous and rounded, so different from Tony’s own.  It would fill him and keep him full, the way only an Alpha could, claim him in a way that went beyond just sex. When they were like that, they were together in such a deep, visceral, ancient sort of way, part of something far larger and older than either of them.  I am his and he is mine, Tony thought, staring at Steve’s cock.  He licked his lips and caught Steve’s eyes track the movement, then deliberately spread his knees, offering himself up.
Tony was pressing quick kisses down the line of his spine while his fingers did things to Steve’s body that Steve’s mind couldn’t comprehend and he could hear him murmuring things, good things, but he couldn’t focus enough to understand what it was, just that it was good, Steve was good, and it was all just too much, but when he didn’t think he could take anymore, Tony’s fingers were gone and he felt empty and incomplete and felt himself press his hips upward and spread his knees wider and knew, God he knew what he must look like and what Tony must think of him and what he was, and it wasn’t like that was going to be a shock for Tony considering, but Steve couldn’t help the rush of shame he felt any more than he could stop himself from letting the words tumble from his lips in quick, stuttering gasps, “please, Tony, please,” he repeated, beyond caring what he sounded like.
“I—no?” Steve replied with a frown.
There was.  Far more than even the two of them could eat, even when he ate more than he should have simply because it was all so delicious, and Cam kept pointing at things and insisting he try it, declaring each dish to be some version of divine providence, even better than the last.
“Yes,” Steve said, smiling widely as he lay down next to Tony.
Tony ignored the question and walked over to stand behind Steve’s chair, bracing his hands along the edge of the back as if he could keep Steve in place, keep the focus on the team and talk of tactics and pretend the gulf between them was distance and a roster of names.
“Met a lot of other Omegas.  They had a whole room for us.  Snacks, drinks, TV, the works.  Kind of nice, just being able to hang out,” Tony added.  “Talk.  Mostly.”
