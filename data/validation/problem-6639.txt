“What are you gonna do? Stark’s like twenty times richer than you and has better contacts, plus his party is bigger. How are you gonna beat him when he’s your biggest rival?”
“Fuck. You.” He interjects every word with giving Sam a hard long look at his middle finger as his best friend cackles to death in the chair. “Go fuck yourself, you asshole.”
“Because talking about my emotions- my… feelings- got kicked out of me by Howard by the age of about seven. I didn’t trust anybody with my heart, Steve, not even Pepper for a long time afterwards. How could I say: yeah hi, I know you’ve just confessed your undying love to me, but compassion and care is something I’ve never been given so you sort of scared me half to fucking death when you broke down my walls.”
He couldn’t just barge into Steve’s office and announce he’d made a mistake, could he? Steve was gonna think he’d just changed his mind and wouldn’t believe him. What if he threw him out? Tony had realised that life without Steve was shit. After the whirlwind of traumatic horror that was his childhood, followed by the trouble-induced chaos of his adolescence, Steve was safety. Maybe that’s what had freaked him out?
“Yeah,” he croaks after a short while. “I loved him.” Loved, not love. He wasn’t Pepper; he didn’t have the right to use the present tense anymore.
“Get out,” the words were nothing more than exhalations from Tony’s mouth but they were deafeningly clear to Steve. “Please, Steve just- leave, now.”
The car pulls up outside the doors not a moment later and the duo rush out straight into the warmth of the vehicle. They tumble into the back laughing when the driver pulls away much more sharply than strictly necessary.
No, Tony reasons, as the car finally pulled up to a plush office complex in New Jersey… he was just being weird.
There’s a hand sliding into his and as he looks up in surprise, Steve’s smiling with glassy eyes that make his heart clench. Steve glides his thumb in soft circles over his wrist bones.
Bruce sighs over the speakers and it crackles like excruciating white noise. “Both. Pep, and the kid.”
“Oh, baby.” Tony whispers as his tears bubble to the surface again. He tiptoes forwards to graze his fingertips over Steve’s knuckles, not knowing whether he was too fragile to touch or not.
“I’ve gotta say,” Pepper murmurs and swishes her red Versace dress around her ankles like a Kate Bush music video. Tony sighs heavily into his champagne flute and wills his imminent death. “When you invited me to this evening, I wasn’t expecting… this.”
The shrill whine of his phone ringing makes him jump, his nerves settling into a fiery burn at being forced back into action. He assumes that it would be Rhodey, or Pepper’s Mom checking up on them, so reaches across to pick it up without giving it a second thought.
A week later, the doctors decide to bring Steve out of the coma. They tell Tony that he requires more surgery, which apparently goes as well as it can when your internal organs have been terrorised by a small flying missile. After the last surgery, Tony sits by Steve for hours, waiting for him to wake up. Flowers and cards adorn his bedside table; from Pepper, Rhodey, Sam, Bucky and the others. Tony hadn’t been able to bear staying in the same room when Sam and Bucky visited Steve the first time; the state of their eyes when they’d left told him he had been right.
“You deserve the Presidency, honestly. You were the better candidate at the end and I screwed up so…”
“Can’t I go with him?” He cries in reply and helplessly looks on as they start to stretcher Steve down the stairs.
“I’ll miss this bed.” Steve murmurs as Tony’s helping him pull a hoodie over his stitching and many bandages. Tony does a visible double-take; a smirk forming over his lips.
“You better, Cap. I’m gonna need my husband by my side if I’m running this clusterfuck of a country.”
“The last few days have been really tough,” Steve continues, to give Tony a minute to collect himself and deal with the pulsing ball of heat in his lungs. “Tony’s been having vivid nightmares since the accident.”
His voice catches so he steels himself. Don’t let him know you care, Stark. He swallows tightly as Steve looks away with a grimace.
“We need to get you home as soon as possible.” The older man states very slowly; a deathly sheen of nausea white matted to his skin.
“You don’t have an allowance.” Steve chuckles pointedly and gestures to the door rigidly. “Fuck off, please, and go and do something useful.”
The car screeches to a halt. Tony exits with shaking legs and peers up at Steve’s building. Once he arrives at the right floor, after he’d nearly bottled it on the way up, the elevator doors slide open.
Tony observes as Dr Beech throws some questions at Steve about if he was in pain (he wasn’t) and if he remembered what had happened (the haunted cloud over his eyes and his sharp nod broke Tony’s heart). Satisfied that he was out of the woods, Dr Beech leaves Tony and Steve together alone.
Tony doesn’t miss the look that passes between Vision and Nat when their gazes meet and he wants to throw himself out of the car.
“Yes,” Steve growls and pushes through the small gap between Tony and the door frame to slam the door behind himself. “You fucking can.”
The crutches groan under Steve’s weight as he takes a few tentative steps forward; Tony’s spine ram-rod straight as he searches Steve’s posture for any signs of pain. He seems okay and the tension rushes out of Tony’s body in one fell swoop.
“I’m fine thank you, Dr Banner.” She nods with a polite smile and Tony gestures to the door with a sigh.
The hospital sheets look stark white against the natural tan of Steve’s skin, even though he had clearly lost a lot of it to the month of rehabilitation he’d spent in hospital. Tony had made it imperatively clear that he would not have Steve home until the man was on no more than five different medications and could walk independently with his pelvis brace and two crutches. If Steve was so determined for Tony to go back to his job (y’know, the small responsibility of being President) then he was gonna be home alone for long periods of time and god forbid if the man didn’t have enough strength to keep himself alive after having a bullet smashed through his organs.
“I’m really sorry.” Tony can’t help but say and Steve squeezes his eyes shut; drops his head to gently knock their foreheads together. It takes three seconds for the gut-wrenching, agonising sobs that Tony had held for so long to batter his broken body. Steve follows him embarrassingly soon after until they are two thirty-somethings in expensive suits holding each other on a lifeboat as the world rips them apart one particle at a time.
“As much as I’ll miss the bullet that was wedged into my hipbone for an evening,” he replies with a sarcastic jaunty shake of his hand in a pirate movement. “I did ask Dr Beech to put it in a pot for me but apparently she couldn’t understand me through the anaesthetic…”
He wets his lower lip and allows himself to remember, for a split second, what it was like when he’d watched Tony stop breathing. “Am I fuck.”
Then, she looks up at them both and throws her hands in the air. A small “yay!” escapes her mouth and she looks so pleased with herself, like she hadn’t just broken two adult hearts.
“I’ve gotta be somewhere, and you shouldn’t be here.” He blurts out and removes himself from Steve’s grasp to re-dress himself whilst throwing Steve’s clothes at his head to get him moving. There’s no hiding the surprise and disappointment that clouds Steve’s features.
“Yeah,” Rhodey nods simultaneously and reaches forwards to brush his knuckles along Steve’s forearm. “Thank fuck.”
“Yeah? Well- oh, oh fuck…” Steve licks a long stripe up behind his ear. Tony’s trails off into a breathy moan before turning his head to explosively slot their lips together. “Let me show you just how much.”
“I’m gonna go and make some tea, okay? Stay here.” His campaign manager orders but Tony can’t feel his legs anyway. Seconds trickle by as he waits for Pepper and desperately tries to not stare at the framed picture sitting in his desk: Pepper, Happy and him at a college party, laughing, drunk and carefree.
“Politics has ruined our relationship from the start.” Tony nods hoarsely and Steve can’t help but look away as his stomach drops. “I tried to put my career first when we first got together and when I received the Presidency-”
Two and a half years. That’s how long it had been since they’d had their first physical fight and Steve had packed his bags and left. He’d left Captain America, he’d left the team and he’d left Tony.
“Fucking hell, here we go.” Steve mutters irately and drops his hand from Tony to run it through his hair.
Steve raises his eyebrows at Tony’s pathetic scramble for the right word to describe a woman he’s never met who’s fucking his ex-boyfriend.
“You,” Clint says a few weeks later and throws some files down on the desk Steve’s falling asleep at with a grimace. “Look like shit.”
His husband pushes the laptop further down the marble and rises from the stool to pad slowly towards Tony, whose façade is about to implode. Steve’s jaw keeps visibly tightening and Tony knows what that means. He winds his strong arms around Tony’s waist and crosses them at the base of his back to rub two comforting hands up and down his spine. Tony wanted to push him away and remind him about everything they’d discussed but Steve was blinking really fast now and- oh god.
“The kid? Yeah, I’m with him now. The medics want to take him to hospital to check him over but he’s being as stubborn as you which isn’t surprising. Bruce is with Nat, she’s okay.”
Bucky’s standing next to a plant pot whilst chatting to a young woman with tousled auburn hair. He looks up to see Tony as his eyebrows jump to his hairline.
“No one is as good as me.” She replies and arches her gaze up from Steve’s bandages pointedly, Tony masking his features with a blank smile. Steve bites back his urge to snort loudly.
“I probably shouldn’t be holding you like this then.” He sighs. Tony shrugs and moves his hands to cup Steve’s elbows; two weights firmly anchoring them both to the ground. Politics had a funny way of sweeping people up like a tornado and spitting them back out with no pride and no energy. Tony hated how much he understood that now, even after all this time.
The aggravated dragon sitting on Tony’s chest stops blowing flames and dissipates into a resigned ache of fatigue. He appreciates Matilda’s thought-process and starts to mentally thank Bucky for recommending the therapist- even if he did have cartons of milk older than her.
“Persephone Gelder.” One particularly memorable young woman introduces herself to Tony with a flourish of her fur coat and Tony just blinks at her blankly.
The trees are just beginning to turn, huge plumes of burnt orange and blood red. Green clings onto the vegetation like mould as a reminder of last season’s beauty. It’s something Steve wants to hang onto with both hands to force summer into the present. He yearns to strip the trees of the rust and replace them with vibrant shades of green and pink blossom. He yearns for the sweet smell of honey nectar and sun. Tony loved the sun; any excuse to whip out those godawful red sunglasses. That man always saw the world through rose-tinted glasses, even when Steve had broken his heart, when Nat died, when Thanos roared.
“I don’t have massive crushes on them. I just admire them for their bravery and good hair respectively. Anyway, this article isn’t great. The only reason I clicked on it was because it came up on my feed and my other option was the rising numbers of Hanahaki Disease fatalities, which you know? No thanks.”
The thing about New York streets was that they were always so incredibly crowded and that if someone was smart about it then they were the perfect place to kidnap someone in plain sight. Tony knew that both from growing up far too rich in such a big city and from his own line of work. One didn’t write all the kinds of articles that he did without attracting enough attention to warrant self awareness.
“Hmm...well if they decide to let us bid on art then maybe I’ll get it. It has its own charm to it.”
It made Tony want to cough. Cough harder than he had in ages and when he hacked up a bunch of bloody petals, his eyes widened. Up until this moment he had been able to ignore the painful part of his feelings for the Captain. He’d been able to just bask in the man’s attentions and let the flowers think they were going to be accepted soon but now in this dark room he knew that he couldn’t do that anymore.
But the thing was that Steve wasn’t sure how Tony would take it so he kept it to himself. Probably longer than he should’ve in hindsight.
Still there were days when Steve felt like maybe his time with Tony waas running out. Days where it seemed like Tony was looking at Steve with an almost bittersweet finality when he thought that Steve wasn’t looking.
Despite that though Tony had made his way across the room to where Steve was standing beside the paintings he had submitted for the display.
There would be no saving Tony from this, not when he hadn’t even been able to give the Captain a call.
“As much as it pains me to admit it, Bucky’s right, you need to lighten up Steve. We’re finally heading back stateside and it’s high time. I’m in desperate need of a shitty burger and fries. It’s not like the grease is going to go to my hips anytime soon.” Sam cut in from where he stood at the kitchen’s doorway, clearly coming back with snacks for him and Bucky, and Steve rolled his eyes briefly.
Coffee creamer acquired, he shook it before pouring a generous amount into his mug and swirling it around with a long spoon. He sipped it carefully before frowning and adding more creamer. Was today just not a good coffee day? The additional dollop of creamer did the trick and Tony hummed happily before sipping his drink while leaning against his kitchen counter to listen to Rhodey.
“I still think it’s for the best. She’ll be happy now. She doesn’t need love,” Tony said only to be scoffed at.
He chugged down the coffee, very used to the slight burn of his throat from drinking too hot coffee for years, and reached for the carafe to fill up his mug again. Refreshing.
Sometimes Tony skipped a class to go with Steve on a march or Steve was invited to an art thing and the engineering major would set aside time in his busy schedule to go with Steve. They were sacrifices that Steve was both aware of and very appreciative of. Ones that Tony never wanted Steve to make for him in return. The one time they’d talked about it had been enough to stop Steve from insisting on it ever again.
“Steve. Steve Rogers. Pleasure to meet you. You’re Tony Stark right?” And Steve watched Tony look away from the painting with a small sigh. Up until this point their entire conversation had taken place more to the painting than to each other but now Tony seemed put off by it.
“You’re ridiculous Tony. You’re really chasing after the Quartet? To write on their equipment of all things? You know how stupid that sounds right?” Rhodey scolds over the phone and Tony shrugged as best as he could with his phone trapped between his ear and shoulder as he tried to sleepily put together a cup of coffee in his kitchen. Why Tony bothered explaining to his non-writer best friend what he wanted to write on was a mystery.
Tony was constantly in awe of the man’s caffeine intake because it was a fucking miracle he hadn’t had a stroke from all the caffeine.
“I would tell someone if I had flowers for them because at that point I’ve already put myself in the position of waiting for them to decide my fate.”
The Captain slipped the shield onto his back and held out a hand to her. She took it and stood quickly. They both look down on the mercenary, who from the looks of it, now that they had more time to look, really did look more desperate and poor than evil.
Except somehow around their friends they were still very close. When they were around the others it was like coming home. Tony would be the considerate present boyfriend and Steve would feel like before. Before he had started to notice that maybe he didn’t know Tony as well as he thought and before he had noticed that Tony didn’t really seem to want Steve around for the things that mattered to him. Instead Tony would be extra thoughtful and would pay extra attention to Steve.
Day by day Steve was weakening and Tony found himself growing more desperate. He didn’t want him to disappear in a breathless flutter of flower petals. Whether he liked him as a friend or more had nothing to do with it. He’d simply become attached to the sort of person that Steve was and now it seemed impossible to think of a world without him.
“I’d really stop now while you’re ahead.” Came an impassive female voice from above in the rafters (really how had no one noticed that the knitting shop had a whole warehouse behind it equipped with high ceilings and perchable rafters) and Tony looked up to see the Widow looking down at them. Her green eyes visible over the edges of her mask.
To talk to his boyfriend about why they seemed like they weren’t really boyfriends anymore. How could they be when they hardly even spent time together.
"I don't think I can do that." Because when he thought about it and realized that would mean staying away from the Captain? Tony couldn't bring himself to do it either.
“Got it. So you’re the one to watch out for. Got it. So you’re Steve and that’s Bucky.” Sam nodded as he saved the information for later.
Tony sighs and thinks quickly about what he actually has to present for this meeting and quickly realizes that he really wasn’t ready for this meeting. But that’s also been Tony Stark’s brand ever since he started at The Avenger and he always just thinks on his feet till he lands somewhere and figures it out.
"Are you sure? You're like some of the most high tech people in New York right now and we have Stark Industries based here. I would know. I was basically grown and raised in the tower."
Steve turned to look at the same painting and raised an eyebrow at his work. This piece was ridiculous. It had started out as a sketch of Bucky and Sam being stupid in their dorm room and had somehow become into some abstract collection of colors and shapes. His roommates called it his “clown painting”.
"Hello Captain. So good of you to answer so quickly. I just wanted to be the one to tell you that the reporter has been taken and if you know what's good for you and him? Then you'll stop looking into Hydra's work in New York." The Red Skull's cool voice was unmistakable.
Tony now understood why so many patients had been willing to wait it out. To continue to live in hope that something would happen and something besides pain and heartache would come from their flowers. It was a rather vain hope but one that he was now clinging onto himself.
It worried Steve because he didn’t want to be the sort of boyfriend who didn’t know anything about his partner.
“Do you ever think about how well you know Natasha?” Steve asked Bucky one night. They were hanging out just the two of them for the first time in ages.
They’re waiting in a ridiculous Starbucks line that’s more on the street than in the store. Still every other coffee shop in the area was too overpriced for the quality of their coffee. So somehow they’d ended up in the local Starbucks.
So Tony being Tony just shrugged and chugged the refilled mug of coffee while dancing away from Steve who was now attempting to steal the coffee carafe back.
“You’re right Stark, it’s stupid to chase after them. But I do agree that you’ll definitely sell papers if you go after this story. Just try not to get killed. I still expect all your other stories to be ready for editing and publishing by the end of tomorrow before you can start. Otherwise you’re off the story. Clear?”
Keeping his own flowers a secret was becoming harder by the day because not only were they rare flowers, flowers that no current patient was suffering from, they were also seemingly triggered by Steve’s own. Getting away from Steve would mean admitting to his own flowers and giving up the precious time he had left with him. And regardless of how much it was physically paining Tony, he wouldn’t give Steve up for anything in the world.
The coffee machine was finally doing what Tony wanted. Maybe he wouldn’t spend his weekend taking it apart after all. He turned his focus back to Rhodey ranting on the other side of the phone.
“So you noticed that too! Every time I think about it, I remember that you remind me of Superman a lot. Costume aside though because yours isn’t as bright and loud as his.”
“That’s what it’s supposed to do though. It’s supposed to give Carol the ability to breathe easy whether s
"Oh it's your reporter-in-distress calling. Here." Bucky said while tossing Steve his phone. Steve caught the phone while continuing to look at the screen he'd been examining with Natasha.
Steve swallowed and looked away from Tony. He hadn’t ever expected their relationship to end like that. In some sort of ill-fated imitation of Pride and Prejudice. Except his Mr. Darcy wasn’t going to come running back later because Tony was a resolute sort of person. Once he made a decision he stuck to it no matter how much it hurt. It was a quality that Steve admired about Tony.
Rhodey knocked on the door before entering the room with Tony trailing after. Inside a handsome young man around their age sat in the bed. His eyes a sparkling blue that contrasted nicely with his golden hair and fit in with his symmetrical features and chiseled jaw. He was certainly the kind of man that would capture Tony’s attention. What Rhodey would easily classify as Tony’s type despite Tony’s insistence that he didn’t have a type.
gets brought up Carol doesn’t have anything to say. It’s so sad,” Rhodey told Tony as they rode the elevator down after a shift of work. They were down to three patients since Carol had been discharged but that didn’t change how often Rhodey saw her. They’d become steady friends through the ordeal. Tony still believed it to be a ticking time bomb but it was Rhodey’s decision not his.
Tony was there with his parents cutting a dashing figure in a perfectly tailored mahogany tuxedo. On anyone else Steve would’ve scoffed but seeing it on Tony? Well, it was perfect. Thinking back on it maybe the tuxedo was the first thing that drew Steve to Tony like a moth to a flame. The other man just looked so beautiful and when those warm brown eyes had met Steve’s eyes across the room, Steve’s heart had stuttered. Tony had given him a bright smile and Steve had tried to get his own face to make the motion but he had a feeling it hadn’t worked when Tony’s face had fallen.
“You do know Stevie, you should just move in together. He already has his own apartment that he doesn’t share with anyone.”
Tony could smell it from his seat on the other side of the break room and don’t get him wrong, while he loved himself a good strong cup of coffee, the shit that Strange drank was pungent and
You’d think the reporters would’ve written a catchier headline. This is so awkward.” Tony complains to Pepper while they wait for their coffees.
“You okay?” Comes from the Winter Soldier standing just to the right of the Captain and Tony breaks eye contact with the Captain to nod.
After the fifth time before the Captain disappears into the shadows again after saving him from a group of trigger happy mobsters, he hands Tony a phone with a look that clearly says Tony isn’t meant to use the phone without good reason.
“You’re not serious. We’re going out the window? But you came in through the door!” Tony complained.
“I’d imagined going home at some point, but not this soon, and not for this.” Steve replied and locked the tablet as they arrived in the main room. The other two super soldiers were waiting for them there.
“Steve please, you’re going to be taking care of me for the foreseeable future. There’s no reason for us to stand on ceremony when you’ll probably be watching me cough up countless flower petals.” The blonde interrupted Tony and he nodded before opening his mouth again to start the usual spiel again.
He had already been dying on the inside anyway. The flowers had just come along to serve as a reminder of that pain.
But back to his impending future death. He’d thought about how it would happen many times and never once had he expected it to be dramatic in this way. Had he expected gunfire? On the low? Yeah. But Hanahaki Disease along with the gunfire? No, no he had not expected that to be on the table. To be fair, he had never expected to fall in love with someone who did not love him back. Tony knew he could be charming and he’d always figured that his charm would find him a partner who was just as in love with him as he was with them.
The man rushed him, a wickedly sharp blade clutched in one hand, and the stolen flash drive in the other. The man was fast, but obviously not used to fighting in such close combat-- his movements more panicked than practiced. The Captain brings the shield down in front of him before the man can get a quick stab in and pushes the man back with a forceful shove. His opponent stumbles back but doesn’t fall. Still this fight had gone on long enough.
and I know that there’s no hope.” Carol answered and for the first time since Tony had met her, he saw the tears well up in the warm chocolate brown eyes.
“Actually it’s acts of service first and foremost. I like doing things for the people I love. But also yes, I do love spoiling you with gifts. It’s what you deserve.”
“Tony get out!” The Captain called and Tony shook his head before pulling the rest of his body out of the window. Tony jumped down into the grass below and rolled on the ground as he landed to try to minimize the bruises he would be waking up with tomorrow.
He rose from his seat and made his way over to the espresso machine he’d brought for the office and made himself a new drink. If he was going to spend so much time here then he’d be damned if he didn’t have proper coffee. He looked at the other two men as he waited for his drink.
raised better than that. Anyway don't change the subject, I still need to know more about this phone thing. Maybe we can meet somewhere and you can explain it to me in person?” Tony asked before he realized what he was doing.
Tony often wondered how he would die. It was just one of those things that he couldn’t help but think about. In the way that after a decision was made one usually found themselves wondering what would’ve happened if the other path had been chosen. It was just one of those things. So it wasn’t the weirdest thing for Tony to think about. Or well at least he thought so.
“Everyone wants to know what makes them tick but that doesn’t mean you should be the one to figure it out. We have government people trying to answer that question. People who make it possible for you to get the knowledge without putting yourself into an excessive amount of danger.”
The door closed with the quiet hiss of the security system that Bucky had fitted the place with when they’d moved in. Steve looked down at the tablet that Natasha was holding out to him as soon as he walked into the hideout.  They’d been making use of it for a few weeks but the sight of that familiar tablet only meant one thing: it was time to go.
The others just groaned and mumbled at the display of affection and went back to what they'd been doing. Tony smiled against Steve's lips.
The time seemed to go by without Tony taking too much notice. He had become accustomed to keeping track based on how often Steve had an episode. Good days were two to three episodes and bad days were six to seven episodes. It was painful to watch and awfully familiar to watch someone Tony could admit to caring about get sicker by the day.
After all, there could be no denying that his job brought him more anguish than it rightfully should. Watching most of his patients choose to die had a way of breaking Tony slowly, little by little. Rarely did he admit to the weakness but now that he spent time with Steve he found himself opening up to the blond. He let him know the thoughts that plagued him after a particularly trying day via text message.
It sometimes felt like Tony knew everything about Steve while Steve didn’t know nearly as much about Tony. It was something that Steve hadn’t noticed right away because he
Tony though, well he loved with his whole fucking heart and everything else that mattered. It was why he’d always been so afraid to really get attached to someone else after his romance with Pepper had fizzled out. They had managed to come out of that friends but only through actual hard work had they managed to salvage their relationship. To still maintain that affection that they had started out with before they’d gotten lost in their romance. Their relationship had burned to the ground with the same intensity and passion that had brought them together in the first place. They had been a fiery couple. A couple that didn’t compromise and gave themselves everything they wanted.
“I’m honestly surprised Fury hasn’t called you yet to put you on the story. Seems right up your alley: tech and crime? That has Tony Stark written all over it.” Pepper says while taking Tony’s phone to skim through the article he had mad fun of.
Tony looked up with a shudder to see the shadow of a man just on the edge of the cell’s line of vision. He could just make out a red mask on the man’s face and his heart dropped.
Tony’s plan was very simple: seek out crime, actual crime, the kind of stuff that would attract defenders of justice and virtue out of hiding, and then go from there. He just needed a situation where The Quartet would have no choice but to come to the people’s aid. The Captain was definitely the most justice driven of the group based on the situations he most often appeared at. The plan wouldn’t require a lot on his part and sometimes simplicity really was the best solution. The saying after all goes if it ain’t broken then why fix it.
"Anyway I’m sure you think I'm not taking this seriously enough and are resigning yourself to sending someone to watch over me. But Rhodey bear? Believe me when I say that I’ve thought about it and I think it’s gonna be alright. I have a plan.”
“Speaking from experience, there’s nothing like looking at that other person and feeling absolutely nothing at all for them.” Loki murmured before raising his mug in farewell and leaving the breakroom to sip his tea in peace.
Then Tony woke up a few days later with the urge to cough. It was just strong enough to rouse him from sleep. He let up a series of coughs up and then fell back asleep.
“I made dinner and kept it in the oven for you two. I figured you’d be hungry when you got here.” Steve answered as he walked into the living room. He was carrying a sketchbook and his trusty pencil case.
Tony had smiled up at the Captain at that while feeling his cheeks heat up with a small blush. The compliment was unexpected but incredibly welcome.
Between writing his articles, hearing Hanahaki statistics from Stephen, trying to look for more trouble and spending time with Captain, Tony was busy. Sure the blue flower petals became more frequent but not often enough to be genuinely concerning.
“Don’t worry Steve, we’ll get him back.” Sam said as he appeared in Steve’s doorway already dressed up in his suit.
“And how was your trip? Did you find anything?” Natasha asked from the couch as Bucky and Sam walked through the apartment door. They were dirty and clearly exhausted but still tensed up like they were ready to fight at the drop of a dime. The serum did that to all of them: gave them the super senses and fortitude to survive any mission but also the intense crashes of having more energy than they knew what to do with when a fight ended too early.
“Oh? You guys childhood friends?” Sam asked as he pulled the chair from his desk out to take a seat.
“Well, then we should go meet with Carol before the others. Our newest addition can wait because he’s definitely not as far gone as Carol. God, why she won’t listen is beyond me.” Rhodey said, the last bit likely not intended for Tony to hear. The words however did confirm some of Tony’s suspicions, those being that Rhodey did indeed care about Carol a little more than the average patient. Tony knew how that would end: Rhodey with teary eyes as Carol coughed up bloody petals and tried to gasp for breath and fail to do so. Making friends with these patients was an awful idea and Tony knew it first-hand. He hadn’t ever forgotten the deep sadness after Pepper had died on him. That was the first and last time he’d let himself get truly attached to a patient in any real way.
Tony Stark was everything that he’d heard he was from around campus and absolutely nothing like it at the same time. He was glamorous and eye-catching and so gorgeous that it almost hurt to look at the brunet.  But Tony was also so sweet and down to earth for someone who had the entire world at his feet, willingly at that because everyone seemed to be in love with Tony, and Steve wasn’t immune by any means.
The urge to cough woke Tony up from his slumber. He didn’t know how long he had been asleep for but it had definitely been a hot second. It had certainly been days since he’d been taken because the flowers growing in his lungs had noticeably gotten worse. The way that they only did when they were progressing to the next stage. The pretty blue petals weren’t coming out as individual petals anymore. In their place Tony was now coughing up small buds instead. He tried not to think about what that meant.
“I wonder who he grew flowers for.” Tony couldn’t help but wonder aloud. Stephen just slurped his coffee while he leaned against the counter.
“I’m Sam. I got here first so I claimed the bunk with the desk underneath. Sorry not sorry.” Sam’s snarky tone immediately made Steve want to laugh.
Sometimes Steve wondered what he had done to earn the love of someone like Tony because the other man was just so
“Hmm. I’m a bit busy right now but I can meet you later. You work for the Avenger right? We can meet on the roof of the Avenger building in three hours.”
It was quick but the Captain met his eyes and gave him a small smile before turning his attention back to the motorcycles that were disappearing three streets down and one right turn out of view.
"Breakfast by Brucie Bear? Oh my god. Jarvis take notes of my coffee bot idea while I head down to the common floor. So I was thinking of including an espresso machine--"
"Nah. I meant what I said. Grown and raised in the tower. I always figured I was an experiment of my parents that got out of hand. I somehow got out and now I'm causing havoc all over New York."
"Then we'll burn them to the ground sooner than we originally planned." Natasha promised and Steve nodded. Now wasn't the time to lose his cool no matter how much he wanted to.
“You really had to ask didn’t you?” She continued in that deadpan way of hers before leaping at the thug and quickly engaging him despite the gun he so clearly was trying to use against her. While she was occupied by the thug, the sound of others arriving behind Tony and the other hostages becomes clear.
“I feel like you’re not taking this as seriously as you should be. You're not Superman.” Rhodey muttered in the tone that meant he’d given up for the time being on being Tony’s voice of reason.
“Well as her boyfriend you probably do know things about her that I don't because you’re her boyfriend. You know there’s always stuff that people know about their partners that other friends don’t know.” Steve continued. He was definitely asking this in the awkward way possible but he had no other way of asking.
“Right well, I am finishing up the set of articles on the War Machine armour that the US military is beginning to put into production. I’m thinking that Musk is starting to regret making it for the government. Rumor has it he’s working on a new version of the suit. Which honestly? Embarrassing at this point but anyway I was actually thinking of going outside of my usual tech material. The Quartet’s equipment is definitely high tech and probably very illegal. I want to find out what tech they’re working with and how they got it. I think the people would love to know. I know its probably stupid to chase after them but I want to.”
"If I let it bother me all the time then I would never get anything done. I have better things to do with my time. Like spending my free time with you and the rest of my time with my work. That's worth it. They're not."
“Carol is different now. I want to say she’s happier but at the same time, I don’t know. Every time s
Tony’s body was limp and his eyes were half open but hazy. Clearly he hadn’t been doing so well in the cell and no one had bothered to give him any medical attention. Steve looked around at the flowers again and couldn’t help but get upset at the idea of Tony being in love with someone. Because it couldn’t be Steve after all. Tony knew nothing about Steve Rogers. He only knew the Captain and that was going to haunt Steve forever. He knelt down and gently lifted Tony into his arms. The other man mumbled but settled against his chest. The reporter’s movements served as a comfort that Tony was still alive and Steve hadn’t been too late in saving him.
“Awww Rhodey, it’s cute that you think I’m going to give up this story just because there are other people who are also trying to figure out the same thing that I’m going to be working on figuring out. Like it or not, I will be writing this story and I’m going to do whatever it takes to get it done.”
“It’s fine. Steve and I have practically been sharing bunks since diapers anyway.” Bucky responded and proceeded to toss his backpack onto the top bunk.
“Tony, what are you saying?” Because this conversation was never going to be a good one but now it seemed like it was going to end on a worse note than Steve had been mentally preparing himself for.
"You're not actually going to do that. I know for a fact you had more than enough caffeine yesterday." Steve said while setting down the wooden spatula in his hand with a quiet tap on the marble counter. The blond turned, hip against the counter to try to stare down his partner. Steve looked far too good in his blue sleep pants and tight white t-shirt but coffee? Coffee was better than sleep ruffled Steve Rogers in the mornings.
“It’s a good story and people will read it. Plus I want to know what they’re packing. They’ve been single handedly protecting New York way better than anyone else has in the past few months and that’s something worth trying to understand better. Don’t you want to know what makes them tick?”
Carol gave them a bright smile as they entered the room and Tony could almost believe for a second that she wasn’t choking on her petals half the time. She could pretend that the petals neatly stacked by her bedside were just petals that had fallen from the artfully arranged yellow chrysanthemums sitting in the glass vase innocently. It was believable until she started looking strained, no doubt trying to hold in her cough.  It seemed she was attached to Rhodey and Tony themselves too considering she always tried to look like she wasn’t in pain in their presence, but Tony couldn’t pretend like Carol.
"Ugh fine fine. Is everyone downstairs Jarvis?" Tony asked as he ran a hand through his sleep tousled hair while sliding out of bed. He grabbed a dark red robe that he'd tossed on a chair the last time he'd decided it was time for sleep and slid it on as he left his bedroom.
“Okay,” Steve nodded and turned to look back at Tony. “Okay. Just promise me that that’s the only reason for this. That there isn’t someone else--”
Steve’s ability to fight was rapidly diminishing day by day and the cannula helping him breathe simply wasn’t enough anymore. He was in pain. The thorns tearing at his insides as the roses viciously tried to grow their way out of him entirely. It was hard to watch and after a particularly bad episode, Tony would always find himself making excuses to get out of the room. He’d find himself in the bathroom holding onto a sink for dear life as he released his own set of blossoms.
Tony tossed the horrifying vine of bloody blossoms in the trash and gasping for breath made his way to his room to lay in bed. There wheezing for breath, he looked up the meaning of wisteria on his laptop. Wisteria had always been one of his favorite flowers despite everything and once he’d gotten his job he’d stopped looking into the detailed meanings of flowers unless he absolutely had to. It had been easier and better that way.
Tony could not believe it. Hanahaki Disease was horrible but it was curable. Was it humiliating and nerve wracking to seek out the solution to the illness? Yes but it was still an option. Hanahaki wasn’t cancer. It wasn’t incurable but so many people made it akin to cancer. Made it sound like there was no real escape and maybe in some ways that was true. You had to either get the feelings returned or have the flowers along with the feelings surgically removed. But you could still live to see another day, live to meet someone else who would return your feelings and live a fulfilling life. It wasn’t quite the death sentence people made it out to be.
“I’m going to wait it out,” he answered before he began coughing up pink rose petals. The petals were few but still a good enough reminder of why Steve was here in this room with Tony.
“I can get you an IV. It’ll give you what you need and won’t require you to eat. Keep in mind it’s not a permanent solution but it’ll help for the meantime.” As he prepared to leave the room Steve’s quiet voice called him back.
“Very well. We’ll make note of it and leave you alone to rest. If there’s anything you need from us, please let us know,” Rhodey said as he jotted down the time of his coughing fit after a glance at the clock on the wall. He returned the chart to its place on the footboard before nodding to their patient and exiting the room.
It was just another morning in the Tower. Jarvis had woken him up with a report that all was well and
The reply left Tony hanging because of course to some extent it was his fault. He’d failed in keeping his patient alive and as a nurse that was his main priority. Being a Hanahaki nurse was different but first and foremost Tony was just a nurse. Someone trained in keeping people alive, not comfortable while they waited to choke on their unrequited love flowers.
"Gotta go. Watch your surroundings next time." The Captain said and coming from anyone else Tony would have been offended at the advice but for some reason Tony couldn't get offended. The Captain seemed like he was just genuinely asking Tony to pay more attention.
They were making dinner and Steve caught staring almost wistfully at Tony while he set the table for their dinner.
Steve was an idiot. That much was fucking clear from the way the other three couldn’t help but judge him. He knew he was but he didn’t need the constant reminder from the other three because he could dwell on it enough on his own. He knew he had fucked up and that he shouldn’t have continued to keep his secret from Tony.
"Maybe you should be more careful and not spend so much time with him." Pepper had advised over coffee one day in the office and Tony had thought about it.
And like before Tony wouldn’t really invite or expect Steve to go to the same things that he was going to. Steve had never gone to a Stark Expo and very rarely was invited to family dinners. It hadn’t bothered Steve before but now that it was becoming harder to ignore that he and Steve were not spending as much time together well it was different. Steve felt like he was alone and he couldn’t even get Tony to stay around long enough to ask about it.
And while Steve had still felt like there was an imbalance in their relationship he had kept it to himself. It just hadn’t seemed worth making a bigger deal out of.
“While that seems like a very helicopter mom thing to do, I can see why he’s doing it. It did take you an almost unacceptable amount of time to get the Iron Man articles done.”
“Hey Rogers, you barely live here bro. We may as well start charging Nat the rent and not you,” Sam called from the kitchen and Steve had bitten his lip in frustration.
Steve spent most of his time working on his art. He wanted to make something beautiful and useful. Something that could have more than artistic value. If anyone could find a way to make art about social justice without losing sight of the beauty of the art itself then it definitely had to be Steven Grant Rogers. Bucky and Sam loved to joke that Steve was the only serious art major in their entire school and if Steve was honest they probably weren’t wrong. He made art for classes, he made art for shows, he made art for nonprofits, and charity auctions. Whatever needed another submission to get it going and it helped a little that his art was pretty good. People liked it and kept liking it enough to want more of it. So Steve made more and more and that’s how he met Tony.
And that had been the start. Sometimes Steve thinks back on it and wishes he hadn’t made a point to keep Tony amused. It would’ve saved them both so much pain.
The vigilantes just shrug and shake their heads while they turn their gazes away from Tony to look at the Widow single handedly disarming and beginning to take down her opponents. The longer Tony watched the more obvious it became to him that not only was she toying with the thugs but she seemed to be enjoying drawing out the fight. He could see why the others didn’t seem too bothered about her fighting alone.
There wasn’t much left to say. There wasn’t much left that Steve could say without bursting into an ugly pile of tears. So he grabbed his jacket on his way out of the front door of Tony’s apartment because that’s what it was ultimately. It had been theirs for a while but it was about to be just Tony’s again.
Tony pulled down his favorite black coffee mug from the cabinet and got a small kick as the heat of the coffee made a shiny Cap shield appear on the side of the mug. It had been a secret santa gift from a few years back when the team had just been getting to know each other and he and Steve were more often than not at each other's throats for unsexy reasons.
“We all tell ourselves that but in that moment it’s probably different. I’m not entirely sure that I would tell them. I’d be reluctant to do so.”
“The Avenger has good reporting and when you’re a vigilante you end up spending a decent amount of time seeing what the press has to say on. It’s important to keep a low profile. Well as much as you can in such a busy city like New York.”
It was stupid for Tony to be so in love with a man that he didn’t even really know. Frankly it was kind of embarrassing how easily it had happened and how it had come about. He didn’t know what the man looked like under his cowl and he didn’t know the man’s real name. He just knew the sound of his deep voice and that his eyes were the prettiest deep blue he had ever seen. He knew that the Captain firmly believed in protecting those who needed it and believed in justice despite the fact he was a vigilante.
The only problem with Tony’s ingenious simple plan was that it had worked. It had worked too well if he was being completely honest with himself. You know given that he was currently tied to a chair along with a few other hostages in what was obviously a drug deal gone incredibly awry. Who knew the local knitting shop was a drug front? That had honestly been a happy accident sort of discovery on Tony’s part.
"Ah." And it sounds like the Captain had been expecting to hear this from Tony at some point because he doesn't sound surprised, if anything he sounds amused.
“Oh sorry for asking. And what are yours? Gifts and more gifts? Because you do spoil me a lot sweetheart.” Steve teased as he  leaned down to press a kiss to Tony’s forehead. The other smiled softly at him before rolling his eyes in amusement.
Tony learns that the Captain likes to draw. The Captain learns that Tony likes to build small things in his free time. Tony learns that the Captain is from Brooklyn when his accent slips out one day while he’s telling him a story about his childhood. The Captain learns that in another life Tony would have been an engineer but he’d gotten side tracked during college and that’s how he’d become a reporter instead. Tony learns that the Captain’s favorite color is blue and that his favorite food is shepherd’s pie and that he reads Tony’s articles.
“You will.” Natasha promised as she appeared behind Sam and Steve nodded as he grabbed his shield from its place by his bedside and made his way to the door.
The petals burst from her mouth in a seemingly endless flurry of yellow. It was just her luck that the flowers that had chosen to grow in her lungs produced so many tiny petals. Tony imagined that made everything even more problematic. The small petals attached themselves far more easily to her windpipe and kept her from breathing in tiny increments. Carol Danvers was truly dying of an incredibly slow chokehold.
So Hanahaki had never crossed his mind. Not to mention the fact that it was such a rare thing to catch because most people didn’t fall in love deeply enough for it to actually mean something real. Because despite the dramatics that Hollywood would have people believe, Hanahaki wasn’t actually the kind of thing that was easy to catch. Which on a practical pragmatic level made a lot of sense. You had to be so in love with this other person that you would genuinely be willing to die for them. That wasn't the sort of love most people held for their significant others, even those in long term relationships, because it was asking for a lot. A lot more than most people were genuinely willing or able to give.
Then again all their patients were admirable for braving the Hanahaki disease and choosing the pain over the loss. Tony certainly wouldn’t do the same. This sort of pain was self-inflicted beyond the initial flower and while love was a beautiful thing that didn’t mean it was worth dying for in this way. That had always been Tony’s way of thinking and as the time went by and more patients of his chose to take death over their feelings it cemented his way of thinking.
And then everything went to shit as so often does in Steve’s life because he was apparently unable to ever catch a break. The universe hated Steve.
He wanted someone who would stand up for what was right and what mattered. He wanted someone who would be there for him when it mattered most and would back him up. He wanted someone who looked at him like there was no one else in the room even when there was. He wanted someone who made him feel alive and who made him feel like there was still so much to see and do. Of course Tony knew that but it was something that he sometimes found himself forgetting when he got caught up in his work. It was easy to get stagnant and not even really notice. So, he wanted someone who could remind him there was more to life than his work and the articles he worked so hard on.
“Technology is the way of the future Pepper. What am I supposed to do? Ignore that I’m a futurist? That’s just not possible. Plus, honestly? Someone had to put Elon Musk in his place. He’s not a superhero.”
“What about you Stark? Anything Hanahaki related in the tech beat?” Stephen asked to draw Tony into the conversation. Apparently Tony could only be the quiet lurker in the break room for so long.
Hospitals, especially those that housed Hanahaki wards, were equipped with databases of flowers and the meanings that were attached to them, including differences based on color. The rose was symbolic of love. It was one of the most well-known symbols of love and the pink rose was more than that. Steve’s particular hue was symbolic of healing. Ironic that what was usually gifted to someone in recovery was actually killing Steve and not even going about it slowly.
Sophomore year came and went in a whirlwind of stolen moments and warm smiles. Junior year was ten- minute dates in between busy schedules and Steve finally getting to go to engineering events when he had the time. It was Tony parading Steve around like he was the real prize and not the engineering genius put to life in different robots and AI. It was two years of Steve and Tony becoming so used to being around each other and living with each other in almost every sense of the word.
Steve was used to being overlooked. Growing up skinny and sickly quickly forced Steve to become accustomed to not being anyone’s first choice. It was just the sort of thing that was relegated to pretty people. People like Bucky who always attracted at least three different gazes when he stepped into a room. Steve knew he could never be one of those people so he just had to get used to the idea that he would be but background decoration. Over the years it became easier for him to do just that. The older he grew the less he cared about being overlooked. Who cared if more people paid attention to all the people around him? Steve had Bucky and Bucky was as loyal as they came. That was honestly all Steve needed most days.
Because with every new day that blurred into the previous one with Tony being absent it became harder for Steve to forget.
“I’m one buzz away if you need anything,” Tony assured him and was met with another smile, this one genuine and grateful, before he was out of the room.
So he was going to die in this fucking cell and never get a chance to tell the other man about the latest stupid thing he’d done. At least they’d save money on funeral flowers when the authorities eventually found his body, that is if Hydra let his body be found.
“I mean I guess. Why do you think that you don’t know Tony that well? Because honestly I’ve never seen two people more in love and so obnoxious. You know him well. Trust me.”
"I'm not the tech guy of the group. I honestly wouldn't really be able to give you a good answer. Not one that would satisfy the scientist in you anyway." At that answer Tony squints his eyes in suspicion despite the fact that the other man can't see him.
“Oh? And how did that go over?” Tony said, turning back to look at the painting. An amused smile graced his lips and Steve felt at peace once more that the other man wasn’t going to walk away.
Tony looked at Steve like he had hung the stars and it was the best feeling in the world. Tony showed his affection so obviously to remind Steve that he was loved. He showed it in the smallest gestures and in the grand ones too. Steve found himself learning to be more like Tony. To show his affection in small sketches and whispered
“Alright let’s make this quick people, we don’t have all day! Let’s get started-- Entertainment, start pitching.” Fury said while leaning back in his chair, it was surprising to Tony that the other man still hadn’t managed to fall backwards.
Despite his moment of revelation Tony still continued to talk to Steve in the same manner. It was hard to break their routine and when he was with him, he hardly noticed how bad the situation really was. It seemed as if Steve never had to struggle with his roses when Tony was with him. Apart from the time they met Steve had never coughed or vomited up any petals in his presence but that by no means meant he was getting better.
He was their nurse. He was there to ease the pain until it couldn’t be endured further. He didn’t have to agree with their decisions. All he had to do was his job and provide them with their limited options until there wasn’t one left. He was entirely used to this after a few years much like Rhodey was.
After Carol’s breakdown, Tony and Rhodey completed their rounds of Charles and Clint before they were faced with meeting their new patient. Carol had been whisked off to get rid of her flowers and the other two still firmly believed in their love no matter how unrequited. Charles especially refused to cave despite how his time was running out.
“Well if I’m Superman, does this make you my Lois Lane?” Steve had found himself asking and the smirk on Tony’s face had been worth it.
“It means that you show your love, your affection, by spending time with people and reminding them how much they mean to you with your words. It’s pretty self-explanatory honey.”
Later on when he was more awake he would realize that he’d coughed up some blue flower petals that were now clinging messily to his pillowcase.
. I’ll feed you.” Natasha responds and stands up to go get him a big serving of shepherd’s pie. Ordinarily on any given day, she wouldn’t indulge her partner like this, but this mission had been long, and she knew it had been difficult on her boys. It was the least she could do for them.
“You’re needlessly putting yourself into danger! You realize who these people are constantly fighting right?”
"I'll give you that but what about this time Tony?" The cuffs made a clicking noise as they unlocked and fell to the ground. Tony immediately rubbed at his wrists while the Captain went to peer out the door of Tony's holding room before turning to the meagre window.
When girls had decided that they wanted to look at Bucky and Steve with appraising gazes, Steve had been wary. Steve loves Bucky like a brother and could easily admit that the other boy was the sort of person who attracted attention. He was just like that. People wanted to be around Bucky, he was charismatic and handsome. It made sense. Steve on the other hand was skinny and small for his age and had inherited all the Irish paleness of his ancestors. He looked sickly often. It was hardly any wonder why Bucky was always drawing pleased gazes and why when Steve was standing right next to him he seemed to receive even more appraising gazes. As if being next to the ugly duckling somehow enhanced Bucky’s attractiveness.
“Shouldn’t one of you guys help her?” Tony asks as they continue to watch her disarm and immobilize the remaining thugs.
Steve didn’t know what he had expected when he had received that initial call from Tony but it hadn’t been the eventual meetings they would have on the rooftop of his workplace. It often reminded Steve of how superheroes would always secretly meet up with their contacts like this to avoid being overheard by the villains. He’d mentioned it to Tony in passing and the other man had laughed, his warm brown eyes sparkling with mirth.
“The articles were so brutal you almost got fired for being too controversial and you write for the tech beat more than anything else.”
“I’m not allowed on any new stories till I submit the ones I have already. Something about holding me accountable and keeping me on track or whatever. Blah blah blah. Like I’m not working twice as many stories as anyone else in the office. And as if I wasn’t gonna go on a writing binge soon to send a whole shit load of stories to be torn apart and vetted for publishing.” The brunet complains quietly, taking his phone back after Pepper has finished scrolling through the article.
“Stevie is definitely the one we gotta watch out for. He may be small but he is scary.  I hope you’re a clean person Sam because otherwise, this is going to be one long fucking year,” Bucky murmured and Sam started laughing.
“You’d really let yourself die for them? Without even considering the possibility that they might return the feelings?”
“I think we might need space. We aren’t working anymore. I just,” Tony took a deep breath and turned to look at Steve. Steve looked away from the tv to meet his boyfriend’s eyes. “I need to do my part. My parents worked so hard to make my life a good one despite the stereotypes of the rich and the public scrutiny that comes with the amount of wealth we have.”
“Now Mr. Rogers we need to go through procedure and—” Tony began only to be cut off by his new patient.
The delicious smell of coffee was enough to make Tony feel alive as he exited the elevator and crossed the common room to reach the kitchen where his fellow teammates were waiting on food or making it. Bruce was hard at work making what looked like the perfect eggs for each of them. Thor was quietly munching on poptarts while he watched the others go about the process of making food. Clint was throwing coveting glances at the chocolate chips in a small glass bowl Natasha was casually guarding while mixing something. Steve was measuring out different ingredients for what no doubt would be pancakes.
“You don’t actually think I’d cheat on you? With who? I’ve been in love with you for so long Steve. Don’t be stupid.”
A few minutes later the Captain jumped out through the tiny window and Tony smiled at him. At least they were both safe now.
“I’ve been thinking that maybe we need to talk about what’s been going on,” Tony whispered while they sat on the couch watching some ridiculous athletics competition. It was mindless but they both thought it was amusing so they’d made it a nightly ritual.
It was cruel of fate to make Steve’s flower a rose and a rose of a medium pink hue. What Steve had done to deserve such a cruel fate when he’d never been anything but utterly sweet as far as Tony knew was one of life’s biggest mysteries. After the episode that had resulted in Tony tossing out a whole rose, he’d quickly made use of his work computer to look up the meaning.
“Nah. Widow can handle a few thugs easily.” Comes from above as the Falcon lands on the other side of the Captain, the man turns to report. “The area is secure, took care of the stragglers. We should be good to go now.”
“Affirmative Widow. Should just be you two and the prisoners in the cells.” Bucky confirmed and the comms went silent again.
No, Steve couldn’t be certain, that was why he needed to get Tony back safe and sound. He had to make sure Tony was safe and then he’d tell him his secret. Hopefully the other man would be understanding. Wouldn’t hate Steve for keeping such a big thing from him for so long. But that would have to wait until Steve got Tony back.
Facing that would mean having to face his feelings and what they meant. Admitting to any feelings would mean opening himself to a world of hurt that he’d done his very best to avoid. Up until now, he hadn’t coughed up a single petal in his life so he liked to think he was safe. Then again when the first flower began growing the petals didn’t immediately try to escape the lungs. It took some time and that was a terrifying prospect.
"Kick. Kick your ass. That's what I meant." Steve stuttered, blushing redder than a tomato as he backtracked. Of course his supersoldier boyfriend couldn't say that in front of the others without getting incredibly embarassed.
"It was the promise of coffee. Steve's coffee." Tony responded and easily manuevored around the others to get to the coffee machine, where sure enough was a pot of Rogers home brewed goodness. Maybe he should model his robot's coffee making technique after how Steve did it because the Captain was talented beyond measure when it came to making coffee.
“I want the surgery. I can’t do this anymore. I thought that I’d be able to last until the end. That I could be brave enough to die for it but I can’t. I can’t. I’m a coward. I can’t.” Carol broke down into sobs and Tony left the room to immediately go get a theater prepared for Carol.
“Okay,” he admits and leans forward to press a feathered kiss to Steve’s lips. Steve’s hands slide up into his hair as he cradles his head for a moment, dwelling in the fact that they were here; they were together. “Whatever you want. You’re the boss.”
“You’re beautiful. Fuck, Tony… sweetheart, you’re the most exquisite person I’ve ever met. You’re an asshole seventy percent of the time, yes, and my god does Pepper deserve a pay rise but Tony- I love you.”
He turns to find Steve’s sleep-warm, sated body curled up in the sheets with one hand fisted in the pillows like someone was going to rip them away. Tony reaches out to smooth a hand through his hair but thinks better of it and rolls over onto his back to count the shadows displayed on the ceiling; his heart lurching about in a storm under his ribs.
Tony didn’t really know how Pepper had managed to shove him into a car to speed him across the state to Steve so quickly, but here he was. His hands were tightly entwined on his lap, constantly twisting and contorting.
The growl that erupts from Tony’s chest bounces around the room and smacks straight into Steve’s chest. Tension pours through the vents like smoke and it chokes them both unforgivingly.
Steve pales in a second. He inhales sharply at the way Tony’s shivering under his clothes and shakes his head. “I didn’t say that.”
Steve can only blink at the other man in disbelief. “Jumping to my defence is what I pay you for, Barnes.”
“Do you have your phone on you?” He asks quietly after a few minutes of silence and Pepper raises her eyebrows.
Looking back, Tony couldn’t be sure whether it was the irritation that he had been disturbed, the realisation that he would never see Happy again, or the memory of Rogers’ nasty scowl as he mentioned Thor that made him say what he did.
“My beautiful, courageous warrior.” Steve mutters into Tony’s skin, the other man sliding his head onto Steve’s shoulder to twist his fingers into his hoodie. “I love you so fucking much.”
She had pulled back to fix her gaze firmly on his; her eyes wet with hurt and red blotches dotted around her cheekbones.
Bile rises up into Steve’s throat as he surveys his husband, his broken, shattered husband, and grits his jaw to exhale quickly through his nose.
Tony’s phone rings exactly ten minutes after his first public speech as President had been made. He excuses himself swiftly from an obligatory conversation with Pepper and one of the more influential attendees (whose name he had forgotten in half a second) and manages to find an empty hallway to hide in.
Tony watches Steve clench his grip harder on the side of the kitchen counter, his muscular back a tense line of irritation facing Tony in a silent fuck-you, and goes to bite his tongue as Steve sighs for the fiftieth time that morning.
He notices that the main bulk of the speech was essentially done, so just tells some anecdotes and throws in a few more promises to fill up the time before marching off the stage with a massive exhale of relief. Huh- he didn’t need to mention Steve then.
“Come on then, soldier.” He grabs their coats and holds the door open for Steve to hobble through; glancing back at the damned room one last time to finally put this sorry nightmare to bed.
The couple shuffle to the adjacent room and make themselves comfortable opposite Matilda who gives them a beaming smile. Tony’s waiver, the NDA he had asked the therapist to sign, lay neatly on the floor.
With a pained whimper, Tony throws his head back and clenches his eyes shut. “Why does God hate me?”
Steve opens his mouth to scream back at him when out of nowhere, five gun-wielding strangers dressed head-to-toe in bike leathers explode through the elevator like something out of a shitty superhero movie.
“Nice speech.” Steve tells him as soon as he’s accepted the call and Tony snorts loudly into the phone. Members of his party filter past the hallway as a shortcut to the main arena from the smoking areas and suddenly Tony’s itching to have a glass of something strong in his hand.
Bucky purses his lips and drops down into a chair next to Sam, where the smaller man is rubbing the red marks stamped across his neck and muttering complaints to himself.
“Then you should close your eyes.” He tells Steve hollowly with a firm nod. “Nothing about me is pretty.”
“The surgery we have just performed on Mr Rogers was able to successfully remove the bullet from his pelvis. We also managed to stem the internal bleeding for now, but he will need further operations to repair the damage done to his right side ribs and liver lining.”
“Doesn’t surprise me.” Nat fires back and eventually puts her phone down to smile at her boss gently. They ride in silence for a couple more hours; broken occasionally by Vision commentating on the winter hue clouding the landscape stretching out from the roads. Snow threatens the air outside and ices up the windows in tiny lattices of white but there’s another kind of tension clenching the air that has Tony’s legs tapping the seat in steady rhythm. He could sense Nat watching him with a worried expression but he knows she was anxious for no good reason, after all: didn’t everyone get nervous for important meetings with people who could bleed you dry within hours? The issue was that Tony didn’t normally get apprehensive about meeting with the investors, in fact, they just pissed him off. Maybe it was the Presidency that was making everything scarier than normal?
Tony sidles further around a corner to escape from a particularly rowdy looking bunch of young martyrs rallying past the quiet hallway. None of them spare Tony a single glance but his hackles rise all the same.
Clearly, it’s exactly what Pepper had expected to hear. Her face twists into understanding when she nods seriously.
what she’s thinking, because that’s what her four-year-old brain has convinced her happened to her Daddy. “Do you like my wellies?”
“Mr Rogers,” he smiles politely and holds his hand out, which the other man shakes with quiet confusion. “Tony Stark, leader of The Avengers.”
“Steve Rogers? He was brought in about two minutes ago, shot wound?” He yells at the receptionist, who takes one look at Tony, blinks, and scrabbles around to find his mouse. Two agonising clicks later, he stands up to point them both through some double doors.
“He-he had the nerve to accuse me of extortion and I just…” Steve fumes to a bored looking Bucky and knocks back a shot of tequila with a grimace. His best friend just raises his eyebrows sarcastically.
A slightly shorter but just as muscly man standing to Rogers’ right nudges him on the shoulder to focus his attention towards Tony. Up even closer, Rogers’ eyes had flecks of forest green marring the planes of blue and Tony revelled in finding a flaw so early on.
“Hey!” Tony grunts, hurt. She blanks him and goes to return to her office when the elevator doors open and Steve comes striding out, tension perched in his temples.
“Vis-?” Nat stops halfway through her sentence and Tony looks up from his seatbelt in alarm. He follows Nat’s panicked gaze to his bodyguard’s face.
“Yeah… the LGBT bit?” Steve sounds small and nervous so Tony swallows his annoyance and forces his voice to sound even.
As expected, the street outside the venue was heaving with various news anchors itching to start smear campaigns against paralytic politicians. They manage to avoid the many cameras by slipping around the corner and into a grimy backstreet, where a sleek Mercedes is inconspicuously parked. The driver window rolls down to reveal Sam’s grinning face, the harsh light of the streetlamps shadowing his contours. He jerks his head at them as they quickly pile into the backseats in case any of the journalists had spotted them sneaking away.
“Well right now, my career takes priority.” Tony bites back and immediately regrets it, Steve’s expression shuttering off into one of offence.
“It’s a fucking travesty,” he scoffs and shakes his head. Steve drops his head in a shy giggle so Tony places a finger under Steve’s chin to direct his gaze upwards. “You’re still the hottest man on earth, Steve Rogers.” Tony eloquently projects every word right into Steve’s eyes so that he understands and remembers it.
“Uh-” Steve seems taken aback by the question and immediately Tony’s chest goes into overprotective mode. “I’m good, thank you. It’s hard to get out of bed some days, physically and mentally, but just being with Tony again is helping loads.”
“What, two hours outside of New York?” Steve scoffs, confused, and it’s blatantly obvious that he’s just trying to act normal. He’s failing miserably though, because Tony knows him too well not to pick up on how quickly his eyes are darting around the market and how he’s clearly gnawing at the inside of his cheek. His eyes light up into a display of understanding before he’s crossing his arms to tilt his head lightly to the side. “Wait, are you planning to
Matilda nods, her expression carefully guarded. She offers Steve a small smile and continues with: “I’m glad to hear it. I have to check in with trauma patients before any appointment just to check everyone’s in the right mind-set to do this.”
Around eleven, a raucous knock at the door interrupts him from his sleepy stupor as he’s halfway through an episode of Dynasty. He groans loudly and pushes himself up from the sofa to politely tell the unwanted visitors to go the fuck away.
Pepper shakes her head and tucks her hair behind her ears to grab her oldest confidant by the shoulders. “Honey, you’d just be in the way. He knows you’ll be right by his side when you can, okay?”
“He’s on crutches,” the words somersault out of Tony’s mouth in a verbal vomit as the car speeds along the highways and Vision makes call after call to his entire team. “If someone’s got to him, he can’t defend himself he- fucking hell!” A scream tears its way through his chest as his whole body shudders against the leather, Nat placing a steady hand on his shoulder to stop the vibrations racking through his bones.
“What exactly are you scared of?” Matilda’s eyes seem like pools of sympathy and Tony wants to throw up.
“Please excuse me but I have some more people to converse with.” He winks at Rogers and Barnes and moves to walk away when Rogers shouts over his shoulder:
“You were shot,” Tony grumbles and crosses his arms over his suit defiantly. “Excuse me for being wary.”
“Stay here!” Steve suddenly shouts over the deafening crescendo of guns firing and screaming to point at the window. “I’m gonna smash the glass to alert people down below.”
“Tony!” Pepper’s running towards him, dried blood around her temple and a shock blanket covering her shoulders. She shrugs it off and grabs onto his trembling hand.
Matilda smooths her hair back behind her right ear with a soft smirk that borders on concern. Her white converses cross at her ankles under her chair; her legs were so long, she had to bend them back under her weight and it looked entirely awkward. Tony opens his mouth to offer her another seat when she clears her throat and looks Steve dead in the eyes.
Tony swallows so heavily, he was fairly sure his organs were trying to crawl up his throat. “It was so real- I… I watched you die, again. Again, Steve, it’s happening again.”
He can see the young girl consider the possibility for a moment, before she concludes that Steve was worth saving with tiny flowers and reaches up to stick one behind his right ear. It tickles the sensitive skin at his cheekbone, but the broad smile he’s got plastered to his face is worth it.
“Avengers Tower: the HQ of President Stark’s political party in downtown New York was attacked this afternoon by five masked gunmen.” The reporter tells them seriously, images of the shattered glass and huddles of emergency services playing behind her. “The only casualty presently seems to be President Stark’s husband, the politician Steve Rogers, who was apparently shot, according to witnesses. An Avengers source has informed us that Mr Rogers is receiving urgent medical treatment, and the President is reportedly at his bedside. All five intruders have reportedly been arrested. Sophia Powell has more information from the CIA for us- Sophia-”
Tony whirls on his husband, his expression alarmingly thunderous, and jabs his fingers into Steve’s personal space with every snapped word: “Really? Because it really fucking seemed like I was to blame when you were dying in hospital after some gunmen tried to murder me because of my job, right?”
Tony repeats his thanks over and over and loses count of how many times he had to be interested in someone in the first few minutes.
“She’s shaken and has a few cuts and bruises, but otherwise she was okay when I left her. Bruce and I took her back to Bruce’s to clean her up. We had Peter as well but then his aunt picked him up to take him to their local clinic so Nat got some sleep.”
Steve deposits their many empty glasses on a passing tray with a snort and jabs Bucky in the back to get him moving. They float past the lifeless corpses of New York’s highest society with matching shit-eating grins. He catches a glimpse of Stark chatting to a pretty redhead as they leave and sends him a mock salute, to which Stark just clenches his jaw at and promptly ignores him.
“No!” Tony almost shouts, his body language bordering on hysterical. He shifts closer to Steve’s knees and lifts their conjoined hands to press his lips against the fragile skin on Steve’s inner wrist. “Listen to me, for once. Nothing- not one goddamn thing- is more important than you.”
“You’re alive.” Is all Tony can grit out; the vice crushing his chest ramming into his arteries like bullets.
“He was drunk last night and stepped out into a road… a motorbike was nearby, and it was dark and- she just didn’t see him, and they couldn’t restart his heart-”
“You finally found somebody who makes you happy, happier than I ever made you, and you freaked out. That’s okay, you’re allowed to freak out, but Tony sweetie-” Pepper drops to her knees in front of her best friend to run her fingers through his unruly hair. “You can’t throw a bond like that away.”
“No amount of bruising or stitching or lost muscle toning is going to mean I stop finding you insanely sexy.”
The blonde man had muscles that were bulging out of his suit. Yes, he had a blinding smile and oceanic eyes that seemed to look right into someone’s soul, but the stranger was toned and ripped simultaneously, and Tony was fidgety, drunk and horny.
The raucous knock at the door startles Tony from his sleepy stupor. He pauses the movie with a groan and drags his body to the front hallway.
“No,” Tony whines in something that represents encouragement and lifts a hand to sweep away some collecting tears on Steve’s lower lashes. “Don’t say that. I’m okay, we’ll be okay…”
“Fine!” The President cries and throws his hands up. Steve raises his eyebrows expectedly. “I’ll go to the shitty meeting. But if you fall over your crutches and crack your head open, I’ll exploit my allowance of the phrase ‘I told you so’.”
“How?” Steve doesn’t take his eyes off the finger that Tony’s jabbed dangerously close to his nose. “We loathed each other, Tony. We nearly killed each other the night I left, for fucks sake. Do you really think we could’ve just carried on with The Avengers after that?”
She nods in understanding and shows them through some more double doors; the kind receptionist giving them an encouraging smile as they go.
“But the Presidency-” Steve tries again but was swiftly cut off by the older man: heartbroken and lost.
“Hey, no, it’s okay. Don’t do that, you’re okay.” Steve soothes but his voice keeps cracking with every emphasis and Tony’s heart breaks because he’s putting them through more shit… he was the cause of the trauma, again. Steve was the one who was shot, yet Tony was falling apart like the weak piece of shit Howard so lovingly reminded him he was every day since he could talk.
Pepper’s eyes are glassy with unshed tears when she turns to face him again. “Steve.” That one word carried so much pity and sadness. She seemed physically pained to say it, but then it hurt Steve in a million ways to stare at her and little Morgan and comprehend what they had lost. “I was well aware when I got with Tony that I was sharing him with you.”
“Daddy used to tell me stories. He tol’ me all about Iron Man, and Captain ‘Merica, and Hulk.” Her small arms bow into right angles as she shows off her muscles and Steve forces himself to chuckle. “I think that he is brave. He was really, really clever, even cleverer than Momma!”
Tony raises his chin a fraction to look at Pepper properly for the first time in ages. The breakup with Steve had been- well, fucking awful- and he had said loads of shit he didn’t mean. God, Howard really had fucked him up. The redhead looks exhausted and Tony’s stomach flips with guilt.
Matilda smiles, broad and pleased, as Steve leans forward to knock their foreheads together comfortingly.
“You don’t need to tell me that,” Nat fires back and thanks Tony when he helps her shrug on her coat. “Vision’s just gone to tell the driver to pick us from the main entrance so we don’t have to stand freezing to death in the car lot.”
“We thought we’d walk to the lake, if that’s okay with you?” Pepper says quietly, her voice breaking on every other vowel. There isn’t a single sign of exhaustion etching her features and Steve envies her wholeheartedly. Sleep was fleeting, nowadays. His bed was huge and cold. It wasn’t empty because he was in it, but every night it felt like a continent and Steve was drifting through the ocean like Titanic all alone.
“No, you said I should take responsibility for nearly ruining our relationship multiple times. That’s exactly what you said, Steve.”
“You- you-” Steve stammers, his eyes looking decidedly glassy. Tony tenses and tilts his head tiredly. “You’ve never told me any of that-”
The headline across The Washington Post branded huge, capital letters into Tony’s eyes. Each word was an ugly reminder of Tony’s loss of temper, of hating Steve Rogers, of losing Happy.
“Alannah is a teacher in Ireland. I don’t worry every damn day that she’s gonna die saving the world.” Steve carries on, his voice low and uncomfortable. “The worst thing I worry about is that some close-minded asshole is gonna say some shit to her.”
“Sorry.” A hot ball of guilt sits in Tony’s stomach. What was he doing? He and Rogers were supposed to be political rivals; not fucking in every available hour they had. What if the media found out? It would be the sure end of their careers.
Something odd flickers through Tony’s gaze before he’s dropping his head to fixate on the floor. “Appreciated.”
“I’ll ramp up the security.” Pepper murmurs and smooths the creases in her dress. “They won’t know you’re here.”
“I’d like to take this moment to thank my brilliant party from the bottom of my heart, and especially my world-class team at the Avengers Tower. This would not have been possible without you.”
“You need to let the past go.” Matilda chimes in softly, her fingers yearning to reach for Tony and wipe away the tears collecting at his waterline. Never in her few precious years as a certified therapist had she seen such pain in two individuals. She had never seen the effect of childhood trauma as explicitly as the anxiety slicing through the President sitting a foot away from her shoes. “Sir, you have a damn lot to be thankful for, and you must not jeopardise the good things by allowing the bad to continue kicking you up the ass.”
Pepper locks the door behind her with a jolt and gives Morgan the go-ahead to set off. She throws herself off of the porch and disappears past her outdoor tent, still erected with Tony’s spirit laughing carefree on that miniscule plastic chair, and down into the dense trees. The adults watch her go silently and Steve’s lips quirk up into a small smile.
“You love me.” Tony mutters dumbly with wide eyes, pupils blown wide with disbelief. Steve’s mouth drops open in shock before he’s nodding vigorously and moving closer to the trembling man.
Pain clenches down on Steve’s chest like a vice. He visualises Tony reaching into his torso and pulling out his heart with one tanned hand and it throbs like a motherfucker.
Agonisingly, those captivating eyes become clearer until two pools of ocean blue are visible- drowsy and unfocused but alive.
Nat dives for cover under Tony’s desk when one of the bastards fires his gun at her, narrowly missing her head and instead shattering an expensive painting mounted on the wall next to a filing cabinet full of alcohol and forgotten dinner invites. Steve- his hero complex still as big as his ego- tackles Tony to the ground behind some drawers as bullets squeal past their temples. There’s a scuffle as Pepper manages to grab a metal paperweight to chuck at one of the gunmen when he turns his back to point a gun at Peter, the object clanging off of his skull to send him crumbling into a pile of limbs on the floor.
“I’ve given my excuse.” Tony holds up the ingredients with a frown. “What about you? A source said they’d seen you in Ireland a few years back, but we’ve heard nothing since?”
Steve waits as Pepper whispers praise into her daughter’s wild hair. It feels too intimate and like Steve shouldn’t be there. The sun begins to properly set, casting looming shadows into the water.
“I was- I am scared that Steve’s gonna get hurt again because of me and my job,” he says very slowly, aware that Matilda’s nodding along with him and Steve’s starting to breathe quite deeply. “I can’t watch him die again. It broke me.”
“What in the actual hell, are you doing here?” Steve asks and claps Tony on the shoulder before he can drop his shopping in exhaustion. Standing face to face with the 6’2” blonde brick wall that broke his heart stirs too many painful memories for Tony to handle, so he settles with chuckling nervously and running a hand along the back of his own neck.
“Fine,” Steve sighs and drops his focus to study the very intriguing sight of his left fingernails. “The fake threat has shaken Tony as much as the shooting did because now he’s in constant fear that I’m gonna get hurt again. People hate him, boys, like really loathe him and he doesn’t trust anyone not to try and kill me.”
He doesn’t look back as he runs out of the door. The panic is enough, swelling in his throat to choke his airways. But his love isn’t enough. He isn’t enough.
“My legs are open twenty-four hours like 7-Eleven?” Steve roars, pushing Tony in the chest so that he stumbles backwards under Steve’s strength. It throws him off for a heartbeat before he’s squaring up to the taller man with gritted teeth. Ah yes, his interview that day had been an interesting one.
“Tony,” Steve uses his grasp on the marble to shift his body weight round with a focused grimace to give his restless husband a pointed look. “Please, for the love of god, go to work.”
Tony loosens his tie with one hand to give the aching ball of anxiety nestled in his throat some room.
Three days later, Tony gets his own back by alluding to a secret relationship between Rogers and Barnes in a press conference; this earns him an actual visit from his rival to his office that ends in them nearly punching each other through the windows.
“So,” Sam begins mildly and raises his eyebrows at them in the rear-view mirror. “On a scale of one to ten?”
“Good,” Tony rocks forwards onto his toes to place a gentle kiss to Steve’s lips. He whines breathlessly when Steve attempts to deepen it and pulls back to swat him on the chest. “Down, boy.”
Bucky bites down the temptation to throw a euphemism at Sam and instead tilts his head to the side at Steve staring emptily out the window.
Surprisingly, Nat nods in understanding. “It’s like you’ve got too much to say, but when you open your mouth, neither of you can find the right words?”
“He’ll live.” She says absentmindedly and pockets her stethoscope to write something down on a form, Steve sending a wide-eyed glace at Tony who just crosses his arms with a smile.
“Assholes.” Tony fumes when they exit the office in a flurry of coats and briefcases with Nat hot on his heels and a haughty frown perched on her face. “Miserable, boring assholes.”
Steve’s complexion was grey. Immediately, Tony’s mind sub-consciously constructs similarities with a corpse and the pressure already smothering his chest goes into overload.
It seemed that they were even more difficult to cope with after he’d won the Presidency and expected more of him- probing Nat over and over again for statistics that she and Pepper just didn’t have.
“I said, don’t.” Tony hisses and Steve’s eyes widen. He feels exhausted from crying, exhausted from not sleeping, exhausted from worrying about a life without Steve. It wasn’t his fault.
“I didn’t even know it was there until I was halfway through the sentence.” He replies and scuffs the back of his shoe against the wall. “According to Pep, it was the sponsors. It was outta my league, it was- yeah. Not you, don’t worry.”
“I told Natasha to include it, Tony. The sponsors asked that it had to be a factor of the speech, apparently they wanted to do some PR damage control of their own.”
“I really fucked this up.” He whispers hoarsely; Pepper letting out a little whine as tears bubbled up in her eyes.
“Fucking hell Tony, oh my god that son of a- I thought he was flying to LA?” He yells. Tony sniffs into his fist.
Alannah grins, showing off a set of sharp white teeth (a bit like a shark) and holds her hand out for Tony to shake.
“I don’t fucking care.” Tony grits through his teeth and clenches his husband’s hand harder. “I don’t give a fucking shit about the bastard Presidency. The stupid job just caused you to be shot.”
“It’s okay. I didn’t want you to hurt yourself.” Steve replies, his voice getting lost in the shadows until it sounds faraway and shaky. “I’ll always protect you.”
Steve slowly starts to shake his head and then opens his arms in a display of arrogance. His mouth twists up into a dangerous smirk that screams hurt and destruction.
He hated the countryside. He hated Steve and he hated the perfect life his ex-boyfriend had managed to achieve with Alannah. Most of all, he hated himself for not being strong enough to tell the son of a bitch exactly where to go.
“This is bit different from our first dance.” Steve jokes hoarsely and Tony has to roll his eyes at the heated glint shining in his husband’s eyes.
“You already abandoned us,” Tony continues, desperately not wanting to be in the market any longer. “You already abandoned me. I can’t do it to the family too.”
He trails off with a breathy exhale that has Steve gathering Tony’s forwards to his chest in order to press his lips against his hairline.
The door swings open to reveal Dr Beech, looking more tired than ever, but positively beaming with a clipboard vandalised with hurried blurts under her arm. Tony slams back down to his heels in sheepish alarm and schools his expression into one of stoic professionalism. He gestures to Steve with raised eyebrows and a knowing smirk to indicate his innocence; it’s a look that Dr Beech chuckles at with mirth.
“In one gesture, Barnes, I need you to point where Steve is.” Tony garbles quickly and disappears through some glass doors when Bucky wordlessly points to his left, still clearly in shock.
“Don’t be ridiculous,” Pepper snorts, like Steve’s flippant brush-off of a dynamic that fired his soul for the best part of his life is stupid. “I was the ‘other woman’, Steve. He loved me and Morgan, I know that. He was my husband, the father of my child, I know I was loved. But, you? He loved you in a different way. It was still fierce, and unrelenting, even when you drove each other to the brink many times- just… different.”
She was tall, curvaceous and annoyingly pretty. Funnily enough, she looked stereotypically Irish, with tousled curls of stunning red hair and sun beam freckles littered across her nose. The woman looked carefree, like she actually slept at night instead of having nocturnal Star Wars marathons, and she was heading straight for Steve.
“Glad to hear it. I assume that’s why we are such worthy opponents?” He questions with a light tilt of his head that increases the puppy dog nature. However, with the dangerous glint in his eyes, he looks a bit more like a hyena. Tony shivers.
“Clint-?” Steve starts and Bucky growls loudly and jumps from the counter to launch himself at Sam who just screams through laughter and attempts to fend off Bucky’s savage slaps.
behind Pepper and she turns to the noise with raised eyebrows. Morgan comes barrelling around the corner like a small brunette bullet and very nearly collides with Steve’s legs. She stops at his feet and looks up at him through her lashes with a wide grin. Her neck has to crick almost all the way backwards for her to be able to properly engage with Steve, so he reverses down a few steps so they’re almost at matching eye-level.
Bucky drops his gaze for a heartbeat before he’s out of his chair and disappearing into the nearby office. The remaining men watch him go in tight confusion.
He nods and she leaves swiftly, closing the door behind her with a thump as she disappears past the glass. Steve’s heart monitor beeps monotonously but it’s the most comforting sound Tony has ever heard. Beeps mean his husband is alive.
“Steve?!” His hoarse voice laced with panic bounces off the walls when he screams his husband’s name; going to yell again when he was met with a wall of nothing. “Bab-”
They sit for a while longer on the rocks as the setting sun bounces off the water surface and back into the forest, dappling the dying leaves with rays of golden hope. Morgan happily scurries around the lakeshore and picks some wild bluebells. She spends an age threading them into Pepper’s hair until droplets of vibrant blue cascade down the waterfall of auburn.
Ignoring Pepper’s hissed shouts for him to stop being so goddamn dumb, he sidles closer to his sworn opposition and plasters a smirk onto his face. Steve Rogers’ political party- The Associates- was a newer foundation than The Avengers but had strikingly similar policies concerning welfare and the economy. The only glaring differences seemed to be America’s military and border defences, which had become hot topics within the media. Tony talked shit about Rogers’ party all the time but had never bothered to discover the man behind his darkest enemy, and now it was all coming back to bite him on the ass.
He knows Steve is pushing down the urge to drag the same old fight up- he can see how tightly he’s pursed his lips together which was usually a gateway for exploding.
The man unconscious in the bed was not Steve. It wasn’t his husband. Tubes ballooned into his wrists with various IV lines and painkillers seeping into his system. His body was covered in sterile bandages that wrapped tightly around his abs and were clearly designed to cover the blood seeping through the wounds; they failed. Swelling marred his chest and armpits, as well as his face which made him look like a cartoon. Against the beeping machines that littered the room, his six foot two love looked absolutely pathetic. It wasn’t his Steve, it couldn’t be his Steve.
Tony blinks in quick succession at the sight and immediately his heart lurches to his throat. He screams for Steve but his feet are weighted to the ground by blocks of concrete with The Avengers’ party colours slashed into the side.
It’s a true statement, but that doesn’t mean it hurts any less. Steve did deserve somebody who loves him back, and the fact that it isn’t Tony aches; hot and pulsing and unrelenting.
The question catches Steve off guard. He whirls around to face Pepper and jams his hands into his pockets awkwardly. She doesn’t retract the enquiry. She just waits patiently for him to blurt something out as they slowly traipse down the woodland paths in Morgan’s racing dust.
It takes a second of suffocating tension, but suddenly Tony is nodding back and opening his arms with a smug smirk. Steve’s chest constricts with excitement at this beautiful, complicated… whirlwind of a man. They stare at each other silently before Tony bites his lower lip and looks up at Steve shyly through his eyelashes.
Her vigorous body language as she made her speech brings a grudging smile to balance on Tony’s lips. He lets his eyes slide from Matilda to his husband and finally- finally, goddamnit- allows himself to breathe.
“I would’ve carried on with my day still thinking that you could be dead.” Tony counteracts carefully, not wanting any apprehensive emotion to bleed into his voice. “At least I know you’re alive. And, that you’re ha-happy.”
Steve sighs into the wood and cracks his neck to flit his eyes upwards. He gets an upside-down frown from Clint that screams pity so closes them again in acceptance.
“Thank fuck,” Tony moans and blows hot air into his hands. “It was so cold in that damn meeting room, I’m fairly sure the investors’ hearts actually froze up.”
Pepper raises her eyebrows slowly at his stammering. Steve takes a huge breath, and marvels at the mosaic of individual lights projecting onto the ripples of the lake.
“Oh, thank god for that!” Bucky’s demeanour does a one-eighty in less than a second as his eyes light up into a relieved grin. “I genuinely thought I was gonna have to have, ‘Here lies Bucky Barnes-Steve Rogers killed him with boredom’, on my gravestone.”
She throws her hands up silently and he shakes his head with a snort. “You are one confusing woman, Romanoff.”
Morgan stares up at him, entirely too trusting and too sceptical all at once. Tony radiates through her and Steve has to swallow heavily.
Bruce flicks his eyes between the young woman and Tony, completely ignoring the pitying look in Steve’s eyes, and bows out of the room with a pained grin. The door slams behind him and the three bodies hear his muffled curse after the loud noise.
They watch Steve for a little while longer and have a pleasant conversation with one of the nurses who comes to check his vitals; her eyes constantly diverting to Tony’s tear-tracked cheeks.
Tony told Fallon exactly what he thought about Rogers. Needless to say, the excited tinge to her demeanour when she hung up should’ve warned him really.
“When I heard all the commotion, I knew it was the building. I just knew Tony, there- there was this ball of nausea in my gut and I thought ‘please god not him’. I just kept repeating to myself as I ran over ‘don’t let it be Tones’.”
“You only wanted to come to salivate over Thor.” Tony retorts with a snort and quickly cowers back when Pepper fixes him with a deadly side-eye.
It was safe to say that the bottom falls out of Tony’s world in one shattering second. Steve was getting married… oh god, Steve was getting married to
Pepper hides a smirk and smooths her dress down for the hundredth time that evening- or maybe for that hour- as Tony’s brain was melting through the boredom.
Steve nods slowly but refuses to make eye contact. Instead, he clears his throat and watches the steady stream of people ambling by.
“I’m fine. Not a scratch.” He replies wearily but Steve’s shaking his head, his breaths shallow and unfocused.
The other man rolls his eyes and pushes his shoulder so Steve has no choice but to sit up with a groan. He can see four of Clint as he desperately blinks to ward off the distorted shapes of dizziness that clouds his vision. All four Clints give him an unimpressed huff.
“No honey,” she leans forward to wrap him up in a hug as he clings onto her waist to press his nose into her hair. “Not yet- you can still fix it.”
“Look, I’m kinda fucking tired of this conversation.” Tony says honestly and grabs his shopping to show his finality. Steve sighs in resignation but doesn’t argue. “I’ve got some big-ass mushrooms to find. Congrats on the wedding, Steve- honestly. I’m glad you’re happy. I won’t tell the others the good news, because I feel like it’s time for you to be a fucking man and give them a call.”
“You called him the worst thing to happen to US politics since the Depression!” She shouts and Tony closes his eyes in remorse. “The Depression, Tony, you stupid son of a bitch!”
“Pep, my darling,” he groans and presses his palms over his face to block out the jarring light. “Please, don’t. I know, okay? I know how this looks.”
Then, the heavens open, and floodlights scorch down on the building from around four helicopters as dozens of SWAT officers swarm the floor to pounce on the gunmen about five seconds too late. It takes Tony a heartbeat to realise that the splitting screaming he can still hear is coming from his mouth.
He holds Morgan tight around her midriff and feels her bony thighs shuffle about on his legs as she tries to make herself comfy. It takes a few minutes for her to fall still, and suddenly she’s fast asleep curled up to a man she’s never really known like a limpet. Night had enclosed the space quickly and now it was a free astrology show. The sky was a carpet of twinkling stars, and Steve wonders which one is Tony.
The seconds trickle by like water: impatient, swift and impossible to catch. Matilda bites at her lip as a wave of emotion cascades through her lungs, but she realises how important her guard is and inhales it deep into her nerves. Something that Tony had mentioned pops into her head and it makes her smile slightly.
“Oh thank god, you’re alive!” Rhodey garbles before Tony can say anything, sounding absolutely wrecked. “You asshole, you weren’t answering your phone and I thought-”
“I don’t doubt it.” Steve shakes his head sadly, wondering how on earth they’d managed to get to this. Never, in over a decade, had their show rivalry filtered into their marriage. Steve knew that this was entirely his fault. Trying to lighten the mood, he rolls his eyes sarcastically and ghosts his fingertips over the bulging muscle by Tony’s right collarbone. “The Avengers business is your business only, sweetheart.”
Paramedic after paramedic sprint into the office and surround Steve with gloved hands and needles. One of them gently removes Tony’s hands from his body and softly pulls him away. Confused, Tony downright refuses and gallantly tries to get back to his husband.
“Give her a kiss from me.” Bruce tells him over hands-free as he speeds down the windy country roads.
He awakes with a start, shuddering and hyperventilating and with glassy sheens of cold sweat seeping into his skin. Steve’s on his haunches in front of him with wide panicked eyes and his hands clamped around Tony’s wrists. It takes Tony a minute to realise that he was attacking out to some imaginary baddie in his nightmare because there’s a harsh scratch down the side of his husband’s neck that wasn’t there when they eventually went to bed a few hours ago. This causes Tony to whimper loudly and cower away into himself.
“No!” All at once, Tony boiled over. It was like somebody had flicked a switch; suddenly, Tony could feel and it hurt, so much. “Listen here one goddamn minute. You’re insane to be involved with me at all Steve, let alone lo-… have romantic feelings. We’re political rivals, arch enemies. Whatever golden bubble you’re in right now, it won’t last. It won’t. We’ll loathe each other by the end of it, believe me.” He crosses his arms adamantly as Steve exhales heavily and drops his head.
“Rhodes, stop. I’m okay pal, so is Steve.” He finds himself soothing the other man, rubbing a hand up and down Rhodey’s back to quell the vicious shivers racking his frame. Rhodey sighs extremely heavily into Tony’s shoulder and Tony slips his eyes closed for two of Steve heartbeats.
“Agreed,” Dr Beech knocks into Steve’s shoulder teasingly and turns back to Tony with a low voice. “He’s a lovely man, but if I heard him rattle on about politics one more time, I would’ve swapped his painkillers for tranquilisers to have some peace.”
Pepper squeezes her eyes shut as a sob vibrates through her skin. It killed her, to see Tony so broken. She smooths a hand down the back of his neck and pulls back to gaze deeply into his eyes.
“We haven’t really spoken to each other since the conference.” He shrugs honestly and looks down to fiddle with his phone case. “It’s… I don’t know, I guess it’s hard for the both of us.”
“Well, if you’ll excuse me…” Tony knocks back the rest of his champagne in one to grin at Pepper with double thumbs up. She starts shaking her head frantically as he starts edging closer to Rogers and his group of attractive cronies with another drink in hand. “I’m going to go and introduce myself to my new best friend.”
“Uh no, it means T’Challa is getting better at writing speeches,” Steve chuckles back as an uneasy silence falls on them both. “Or is it Nat?”
“We had great sex after that.” Tony pointedly doesn’t answer Steve and instead hides behind humour to shatter the frozen panic on Matilda’s features. “Then we were married the following year.”
“When will you get it into your stupid, overly-egotistical head,” Steve grinds out with all the attitude of Pepper at her most frustrated. “That I don’t see Tony Stark, Bullshitter Extraordinaire. I don’t see the cocky, selfish and rude dickhead that the world sees- well, at least not all the time. I don’t see the broken man who was painfully let down by his father. I don’t see all those people Tony-”
“Right,” Matilda sighs and shuffles forwards so she’s sat on the edge of her chair. “Tony, I don’t blame you for being tense about the security breach. After what you’ve both been through, it’s to be expected. We need to make sure that going forward, you’ve both got ways to cope with the stress that’s undoubtedly been forced on you and then we’ll try and do something to help those nightmares. Is that okay for the both of you?”
“Everyone here is so old,” she complains and pokes Tony to get his attention; his focus firmly stolen by a pretty blonde commandeering a large crowd by chatting about nuclear physics. “How are we supposed to further our political agenda with these dinosaurs? They’ll all be dead by the time you’re President.”
“As you wish.” Tony whispers and knocks their foreheads together in a breathy exhale. Steve nods happily, his face spreading into the widest smile Tony had seen in weeks. “Love you, baby.”
It’s a fair point and Steve’s features quirk up into a fond smirk. The red rings etched around his eyes sort of dampen his ethereal beauty, but Tony doesn’t mind. His husband doesn’t hate him. They have a chance at be okay.
Steve hadn’t been happy that Tony was prepared to keep him in hospital after waking up from the coma. He didn’t understand the meaning of ‘hospital observation’ or “baby, I can’t help you recover by myself” or even “you’ve just had major surgery you stubborn asshole so lie the fuck back down or I’ll reduce your painkiller dose”.
Convincing Tony to at least give Matilda a chance had been the hardest thing Steve had had to do in what felt like years. At first he was adamant that he didn’t need therapy, but then one particularly awful nightmare had nearly stopped his breathing as he thrashed about in the sheets and Steve was done. He was over watching his husband fight demons in his sleep every night and he was over watching a zombie version of Tony try and run the country every day.
“Pull yourself together Stark.” He mutters to himself and digs his fingernails into the fragile skin on his palms. “This is the man you love, and hate for a job. He won’t kick you out or laugh in your face…” Out of nowhere, something his Mom had always said about him slipped into his mind and his heart nearly burst. “He… he has your heart.”
“As the first openly LGBTQ+ President in US history…” he trails off, painfully aware that people were glancing slyly at each other in the audience. Did this really need to be said? “I will strive to present America as the welcoming and forward-thinking country I know it can be.”
“He’ll be okay.” She nods but Tony doesn’t believe her any more than the paramedic. “I’ll drive you, we’ll follow the ambulance.”
“Fuck knows, the speech comes to me- I read it out loud and hope to god I’m not pleading my undying alliance to you or anything as I go.” He scoffs, painfully aware that he’d been gone too long. Pepper was gonna come searching for him at any minute.
In one swift movement, Steve leaps from the floor to crack one of the heavy folders into the face of the shortest gunmen, who makes a throaty squelching noise that Peter almost gags at as he catapults backwards. In a fleeting moment of horror, Tony eyes up one of the remaining attackers circling round to point his rifle at Steve’s head before Tony reaches out to grab Steve by the ankle and yank him back down behind the oak drawers. A stray bullet pings off the corner nearest to Peter; wood splintering around like chips of gold and Peter’s jaw tightens. Pepper bellows with fright as the gunmen she was attempting to fend off jams his elbow into the side of her neck and her fingers go lax but Nat gets to her just in time and together they manage to push him out of her office with the legs of a chair.
It was clearly a story to make Tony feel shitter than before, but also a story to warn him about further interactions with journalists. The awful thing about the whole situation, was that Tony didn’t regret voicing his exact thoughts to Fallon. He hated putting the party and Pepper through his mistakes- he knew Happy would’ve disapproved- but there was a huge part of Tony that rejoiced in getting Rogers back for his awful behaviour at Thor’s event.
“I didn’t say anything!” Tony suddenly yells out of nowhere, the pent-up anger he’d been experiencing for weeks erupting from his façade in spurts of lava. Steve recoils as if Tony had kicked him.
“Open your eyes, handsome.” Tony breathes, his fingers laced with Steve’s. Dr Beech shoots him a sad look from where she’s injecting something into Steve’s veins.
Still complaining under his breath, Tony gathers up the last of his things and stomps up to Steve with a pout. He slides his hands round the amused man’s ribs in a feather-light touch as to not put any pressure on Steve’s scars and impressive Tate Modern display of bruises.
Pepper’s phone vibrates and she checks it with a frown; her features melting when she reads the text message. “It’s Rhodey- he’s just pulling up the hospital. I’ll go and get him and then I’ll ring Vision and get the whole security team over here.”
“Fucking Clint?” Sam murmurs under his breath and Steve chokes on his own saliva to laugh uncontrollably. Bucky’s features twist into a murderous rage as he points his index finger at Sam dangerously.
“I don’t have the energy…” He admits with a strained laugh and shoves his hands into his suit pockets to clench and unclench his fingers in the fabric. Vision chuckles from where he’s holding the car door open but his fingertips are gripping onto the metal too tightly.
Not again, not Steve. His husband had already been targeted; there was no way it was going to happen again…
Steve straightens out his palms and points them towards Tony. It’s a show of placation and vulnerability, but it sort-of makes Tony hate him a bit more. “Then leave. Take your freedom and just go.”
Luckily, nobody here seemed to be recognising him. Well, nobody was trying to make conversation if they did identify him which was a bit of a blessing. The country way, he mulled over and continued to weave through the lazy crowds whilst peering over people’s shoulders at the fresh produce, seemed to be minding your own business and not doing a double take when Iron Man crashed your fresh fruit stall. Small mercies, hey.
Tony was painfully aware of how serious his best friend was being. He knew how much he was hurting his party.
“Tony,” Steve says, and winds an arm around the woman’s waist when they finally reach other. “This is Alannah, my fiancé.”
“I won’t be offended if you don’t want this, or even chuck me out of the house,” Bucky starts and goosebumps begin to ravage Steve’s forearms. “But it might help.”
Steve’s resolve breaks and within half a second, he’s got Tony wrapped up in his arms like a child. He whispers soothing nonsense into Tony’s hair as the broken man just hangs on for dear life and cries into Steve’s shoulder.
“You do know you’ve managed to pick three of the most beautiful people in twenty-first century Hollywood?” Steve points out and taps the lid of his pen on the table. Bucky shrugs and points at Sam aggressively.
“Actually yes,” the soft tone from Fallon’s voice disappears. “We have some intel that you had a rather heated discussion with Steve Rogers at an event a few weeks ago. The paper is running the story, so do you have any comments on the situation? Why Mr Rogers made you so annoyed, perhaps?”
“Shitting hell,” Steve mutters, his hands gliding large circles over Tony’s shuddering back. “Fuck, sweetheart, take a deep breath for me.”
“Well, I certainly wasn’t expecting this when I woke up yesterday morning.” Tony chuckles easily from the beautiful marble lectern and the whole room laughs good-naturedly with him. Tension floods through his veins but he has to pretend- he must pretend- that his first Presidency speech is only being made to the 500 or so people sat before him, and not beamed around the globe from the countless cameras pointing their empty black mouths directly at his face. His eyes scan back down to Nat’s carefully constructed speech and with a deep breath, he continues.
“You can see him now, sir that should be fine. I have to warn you though; he won’t look like the Mr Rogers you know at the moment. There’s some bad swelling, and he’s under heavy sedation which means numerous machines.”
Even though they both slip into the same bed that night, their bodies were continents apart with heartache and confusion swirling into the Egyptian cotton sheets between them like cyanide. Insomnia crippled Tony into a state of hysterical worrying as his mind constantly spun into tornados of muddled thinking- nothing made sense, not one tableau projected into his head gave him answers.
“You’re finally off then?” She jokes and moves round to Tony’s side to check that Steve’s dressings were still in place and that he hadn’t pulled any stitches when pulling that hoodie on with a slightly worried maternal expression.
Tony falters and re-reads the sentence to himself again just to make sure the words swimming on the page were actually the ones he needed to say.
The media never normally dared to ring Tony’s office- he paid people to deal with these sorts of phone calls. How this woman had managed to reach his office line was something he needed to take up with the team, and not politely.
“Well done, Morgan.” Steve basically whines and drags the back of his sleeve against his eyes. Tears pools against his lower lash line but he blinks them back with every facial muscle he has. “I know your Dad is real proud.”
“Not a soul.” Steve confirms with a soft nod and sighs heavily into Tony’s temple. “Bucky was here earlier to check that I was okay but he left after lunch- after that, nobody was here. I’m fine, Tony. Nobody got to me. I’m safe.”
Steve’s eyes widen in shock, his whole expression dropping into one of utter disappointment. Detachment shines in the baby blues as his pupils study Tony with increasing concern. Tony remembers when those eyes stared at him with joy, pride and love. Guilt clenches his heart like a whipping. It hurts just as much as the punch Steve had given him when they’d broken up.
The next day, Rogers- no, Steve- copies one of Tony’s speeches word for word on a Fox interview. For his troubles, he gets a lapful of an angry and horny Tony to drive him over the edge.
“No,” Steve berates and slides his warm hands into Tony’s hair. “This isn’t like last time. I won’t let it. You’re exhausted from looking after me, you’re exhausted because you’re the fucking President, you’re exhausted because that false security breach has plagued your mind ever since it happened and you’re exhausted because you love me.”
“I know,” Tony presses the heels of his palms into his eye sockets until luminescent spots in the shape of heartrates cloud his vision. “He was in surgery for the best part of five hours- something about internal bleeding? The bullet hit his liver and got lodged in his pelvis or something, I’m not sure. I stopped listening after I realised he was alive. Apparently he was lucky for it to have missed his pancreas or something… what do I know? He’s not exactly ‘lucky’ is he? Look at him.”
“Two.” Bucky complains and cracks his neck with a pleased groan. “It was beyond boring, Thor Odinson has really lost his edge. The only thing that made it a little more bearable was Tony Stark going full arrogant-asshole on Steve’s sorry ass.”
Pepper had entered his office with her complexion void of any colour. Immediately, Tony was jumping out of his chair to pull the shuddering young woman into his arms.
And that- that causes all of the heartache Steve had suppressed over the last fortnight to overflow and ignite his veins in fireworks. He slaps a hand to his mouth and breaks down into heaving, ugly sobs that rack his body pathetically. Morgan doesn’t blink. She just crawls into Steve’s space and arranges herself on his lap like this is normality. Her arms wind around Steve’s waist as far as they’ll go and she rests her head against his heart, feeling the erratic but gentle thumping under her skin. Steve throws away any control he’s got left and rests his chin atop the girl’s crown to sniffle into her hair. Pepper surveys all of this with her own tears erupting down her cheekbones but doesn’t touch either of them.
Tony growls in irritation and tightens his grip on Steve’s hand. His husband watches him with dark eyes.
In reality, the smile screams loss and pleads for help. It makes Tony close his eyes in desperation as the room begins to spin.
“Thor certainly knows how to throw a party, but if there’s one thing about me, I never stop working.”
“No, no- fuck, Vision no-” he demands and claws at his throat in desperation to make it allow him to breathe again. Nat inhales sharply and whips out her phone to call Steve. He doesn’t answer.
“I do.” Steve repeats as a grin blossoms on his face at Tony’s realisation. “I’m a madman, apparently, but yeah- I do.”
“I talk to her when things get... complicated.” Bucky explains when Steve looks up in blank misperception.
Suddenly, Pepper appears from deep inside the swell of the sprawling house and opens the door. She fixes Steve with a friendly smile that borders on pity. Steve suppresses the urge to run.
Tony opens his mouth to inform his husband that the entire SWAT team and CIA would be up at any moment- the perks of having security fit for a President, you know- when Steve dashes from behind the cabinet to barrel into a gunmen who had clattered into the second office four seconds previously. He swears he can see the mouth of the scum twist upwards into a sadistic smirk before the gun is being pointed at Steve’s chest and everything goes into slow motion.
“I see you.” The younger man moves to cup Tony’s jaw with both hands and slide his thumbs up to his temples; the sunglasses perched on Tony’s face slide off with Steve’s fingers. Tony slips his eyes closed to catch the tears pooling in his lashes. “I just see you.”
The induced coma had taken all of the tension out of Steve’s body, and for the first time in ten years, he looked relaxed. Tony hates this with his entire being.
“He needs surgery and then he needs you to have a clear head.” She corrects and grabs her car keys from a drawer that didn’t get blown to pieces as they pile into the elevator and ride in tense, thrumming silence to the car park.
“When, in over a decade of being together, have we not done things the hard way? When have we not been destructive?”
“Why aren’t you at the airport?” Tony can’t help but complain and Nat shrinks down in the chair, her eyes flicking between the two alpha males in quick succession. Steve narrows his eyebrows and crosses his arms in agitation.
Tony lets his eyes slip closed and holds his breath, waiting for the nightmare to slam back into his sub-conscious. It doesn’t, and all he can feel are Steve’s trembling fingers warm against his scalp.
Tony remembers the panic alarm attached to his phone after he’s pulled Peter down next to them to escape more bullets as Nat karate kicks one of the intruders in the balls (“hope you feel that in your throat, fucker!”) so buries his face in Steve’s chest whilst his husband grabs a folder to beat them off with and unlocks his phone to send an alert to the building’s security.
It doesn’t take them long to catch up with Morgan. She’s sat on a log prodding at a caterpillar when they come silently around the corner and jumps up brightly when she spots them. Pepper lifts her arm to allow the child to burrow into her warm side as they wander further down the embankment. The trees become more and more sparse as they emerge out onto the lakefront until Steve is drinking in the mottled blue when he tips his head up to breathe through the atmosphere.
“I’ll make sure the courts throw the book at them. Don’t worry.” She clears her throat and kisses his cheek before gesturing at Steve. “He remains to be your top priority.”
Steve scoffs but swipes a thumb under Tony’s eyes to collect the waterfalls still sadly flowing. “Go back to your job.”
“Our wedding night would’ve been a bit different if you’d had that.” Tony taps the straps on the pelvis brace securing Steve’s right leg into position.
“Thank you.” He replies politely, his tone already giving way to a tsunami of heartbreak. “You gifted me a very difficult and very commendable political race.”
Whilst talking, she manages to surround them both by attendees of the live speech; all wanting a chance to congratulate the new President.
, felt abandoned. But I- Tony, I can’t be sorry for running away to Ireland. Being a coward meant I met Alannah and well… I’m happy. Honestly, T, I’m happy and I’ve not been that in a really long time.”
. He’d waited nearly three years to hear that all his effort hadn’t been a complete waste of time. Steve had wanted the same thing, he-
“Not likely!” Pepper singsongs back and Morgan giggles. Her laugh sounds like icicles breaking and it’s beautiful.
So, this is it. After many months, many (many) hours of writing and re-writing snippets, this little bundle of joy is finished. When I first started this, I never thought that it would reach the length that it has, nor did I think it would inspire/excite/make cry this amount of people. You're all amazing and I'm so grateful for the support.
Tony nods in understanding and goes to turn to Vision with a fragile smile. He’d already expressed his gratitude to the team when his stomach hadn’t been somersaulting like a trapeze artist.
“Go and shamelessly flirt with your supporters.” He sighs and reads Tony’s mind in one fell swoop. “Just be thankful I’m not there to be jealous.” It’s a line that old Steve would say, not the confusing robot he was currently married to.
“Through those doors, and then round to the right, follow the red line on the floor and it will take you to the resus reception. Ask there and they’ll be able to tell you if he’s in surgery yet.”
Steve blinks at Tony in slow motion, his captivating blue eyes still melting into liquid every second.
They mingle with the huge swarm of Armani suits and diamonds for a little while longer before the restless glint in Pepper’s eyes becomes blinding.
“She’s a sweetheart.” He rasps. A crescendo of catastrophic evil explodes in his ears and he knows he’s outwardly wincing. And, fuck, Pepper notices it too because her expression shutters off into a complete void of sympathy and Steve wants to scream.
There’s a pause before Tony’s shaking his head slowly and forcing his eyes open to stare blankly at the wall. Steve exhales sharply out of his nose and continues the gentle pressure in his husband’s hair.
I’m happy now that I’m not with you, is what Tony hears, even though its clearly not what Steve meant.
“Thank you for letting me have him.” He states very slowly and nearly breaks when Pep’s eyes soften. “Even just for a little bit. It was enough. He was enough.”
He’s just settled on making chicken tikka masala skewers when a hand settles on his shoulder. His muscles automatically tense under the intruder’s flexing fingers, but he doesn’t jump a mile and whirl around to the smack the person between the eyebrows. No, because- oh, why goddamnit was this his life? Here? Now?
“Glad to see you back with us, Mr Rogers.” Dr Beech greets with a low voice. Steve just blinks at her and then back to Tony, who just smiles at Steve’s obvious confusion. “You’ve been in a coma for just over a week and you’ve had a few major surgeries so try to remain still for me, okay? I’m gonna need to ask you some questions.”
Nat shoots him a worried look before they’re opening the doors to be swallowed up in the hungry sea of predators.
“I don’t know what to say.” Sam admits softly and runs a hand through his hair. Steve gives him a soft smile and nods.
Tony Stark’s Mom had helped him to realise that Steve had his heart. Now, as she surveyed the two grown men finding starved solace in each other after worlds of undeserved pain, a gentle realisation settled in the room which lifted the atmosphere from black to gold. She at long last saw the future, and knew that Tony Stark was finally going to be okay.
“We transferred him straight to the ICU. It was thought best to place him in an induced coma for the next few hours, just to see how he copes with breathing on his own at this present time. He is alive, however, I cannot stress to you the importance of the next twenty-four hours and how critical he is right now.”
“You ready?” Nat’s wavering voice splinters Tony’s daydream. He shivers involuntarily when Vision opens the door for him so he reverts back to his President Tony Stark, Bullshitter Extraordinaire expression with a raised eyebrow and a nod. Time to work.
Why, the actual fuck, did he think cooking for a God, a couple of assassins and Earth’s most dangerous supernaturally-enhanced weapons would
“There’s being wary, and there’s waiting outside the door when I have a piss in case I ‘can’t get myself back up’, Tony.”
“Hi Captain ‘Merica.” She almost-whispers like she was too afraid he was an apparition that would suddenly disappear. It takes Steve a moment to realise that’s
“You won’t.” Pepper tells him with so much conviction, Tony believes her. She drops a kiss against his collarbone. “He’s strong as fuck, honey. You know that.”
Sam and Bucky’s eyes meet in the mirror as they share a worried glance. The Associates were still building their mark on society whilst The Avengers had already recruited most of their members. If one thing was for sure, Stark and Steve were going to have to keep their personal hatred out of their political rivalry, or everything was going to go drastically wrong.
“Good morning Mr Stark.” A posh and slightly Australian sounding voice melts through the speaker as Tony frowns to himself in confusion. It was a voice he didn’t recognise. “This is Fallon from The Washington Post, how are you today?”
“Extremely productive, actually.” Rogers lifts his chin in defiance and it almost makes Tony laugh. “Although, from what you’ve been saying about my party to the press, I think you’re aware of that.”
Steve sighs and contemplates whether he should save his best friend from the angry wrath of his used-to-train-with-the-military boydyguard. Decision made, he shrugs fondly and watches as Bucky puts Sam into a headlock.
It’s a low blow, not to mention a childish one. Steve grits his jaw, but softens it to gently nudge Alannah in the ribs. They talk in low voices for a heartbeat and Tony stands there feeling more out of place than ever. After a few hushed sentences, Alannah gives him a small wave and meanders off back through the market with a meaningful glance at Steve over her shoulder.
A loud car horn reverberates through the house and Tony pulls back with a frustrated groan. He gives Steve another apology kiss goodbye and races out the door to jump in the sleek Audi; Nat sat in the back and already frantically composing messages on her phone.
“Oh god, um… I don’t know! I’d marry Liz and I’d probably fuck Tyler because that man is smokin’… but then Taron can sing- oh this is shit and ridiculous. Buck, let me do you.”
Tony runs his tongue along the seam of his upper lip to wet it before nodding. She passes it over and immediately he pulls up the contacts and dials Rhodey.
“Don’t start!” Pepper warns him sternly and grabs his hand to pull him from the wings and onto the main floor where voices of bigoted millionaires filtered through the velvet curtains. “They insisted and they have the money. What was I going to do? Tell them to shove their extra billions up their asses?”
“You’re an animal.” He breathes into Tony’s neck; Tony laughing in surprise at the fondness dripping through his voice. Out of nowhere, Tony clenches his thigh muscles around the jutting bones of Steve’s hips in warning, their crotches pressing together heatedly.
“Tony?” Nat calls after him when he’s taken two steps- he drags his torso round to face her and tries to hide how his throat is closing up. She grins and salutes him with a gloved hand. “Congratulations, Mr President.”
“Daddy isn’t here now. I wish he was,” her expression clouds over and Pepper’s breathing hitches. “I miss playing outside with him, and I miss when we would sing Lion King. I miss his special stir fry and his hugs. I miss when he would sneak me popsicles when Momma wasn’t looking…” She trails off, losing interest. Her attention turns to scuffing her boots against the ground, drawing patterns in the mud. “He made Momma and me happy.”
“I’m not going to ask how you know that.” She raises her eyebrows and Tony shrugs. It was probably good etiquette not to discuss people he’d fucked with his ex-girlfriend.
“Did Nat tell you she was going to write the gay bit?” He accuses sharply and Pepper’s expression immediately falls into her professional one.
Pepper taps her daughter on the cheek with a dark red nail etched in bronze lightly. “What about Steve?”
Swarms of questions barrelled through Tony’s head, making his headache worse. After a while, he was sub-consciously aware of how close they were to Steve which just increased the nausea.
Tony makes a pained noise as Steve turns away and reaches out with desperate grabby hands to get his attention. Steve frowns and sighs heavily enough to sound like even looking at Tony causes him physical hurt. “No, no I’m sorry- Steve, don’t go, please. I didn’t mean to sound so… bitchy. I’m happy for both you and Alannah. She seems… nice.”
“That was nothing.” Rogers instantly dialled up to high alert at Tony’s revelation. “Fury’s an idiot.”
Resus is eerily empty when they burst through the doors to the reception, making the woman sat at the desk jump out of her skin.
Matilda nods in agreements, her hair bouncing around her jaw. “We can both do our best to help you cope with the nightmares, but we will not stand back and watch them ravage you because you assume that they should just happen.”
“Tony,” Matilda leans forward over her knees and places a solid hand on his shuddering thigh- present and comforting and promising. “Why did you agree to this session?”
For old times sake, let me know what you thought of this last bit- if that's not possible, smash it a Kudos as anything is appreciated.
Tony stumbles backwards in shock and blinks at Steve rapidly as his heart starts to go into overdrive. Steve shrugs his shoulders like he hasn’t just dropped the biggest bombshell in the world with an apologetic grimace.
“…was the burglar alarm, which went off by accident. The alarms are monitored, you know that, and I was contacted to say that one of the wires had tripped in the security system and to not worry about it. There wasn’t a security breach and I was- I am- absolutely fine.” Steve tells him slowly and carefully; being cautious to keep his tone as gentle as possible as to not spook his fragile lover. Tony just slides his eyes shut in utter relief.
“Okay, ‘Fuck, Marry, Kill’.” Bucky crows and slides onto the kitchen counter, his sock-clad feet bouncing off the cabinets in a steady rhythm. “Uh, Tyler Hoechlin, Taron Egerton and… Liz Gillies.”
“Slave? Oh, you’ll be lucky.” Tony chuckles and swats Steve on the ass as he hands him the crutches. The younger man had categorically refused to use a wheelchair unless it was adamant that he had to for his safety. Apparently, it made him feel a burden. Tony downright disagreed with that which had caused some pretty explosive arguments. Pepper hadn’t been happy that they’d managed to get a noise complaint in a bloody hospital.
“You’re an idiot.” She tells Tony, who pinches the bridge of the nose to relieve pressure on his head. He swivels on his chair away from his desk to take in Pepper’s flagging posture.
“I have been,” Steve replies carefully and pulls his shirt further down his abdomen. “But we decided to have a small vacation.”
Tony inwardly laughs at her greeting, because did she know who he was? Was she aware that he was the guy Steve had been fucking three years prior to their break up? Did she know that Tony had hidden an engagement ring in his underwear drawer from the moment they got together to the moment Steve had run away? Fuck that, did she know that said engagement ring was still buried under his motherfucking Calvin Kleins?
Bile rises in Tony’s throat but he swallows it down with only a small wince at the burning that scratches down his flesh.
Heartbreakingly sluggishly, Steve lifts his shaking head to look directly into Tony’s eyes. They look broken; destroyed with pain and tears. His eyes- his husband’s beautiful eyes- weren’t blue anymore but instead a pathetic grey that were metal dull.
Pepper pulls him down onto a rock pile and they make themselves comfortable. Morgan pulls out a piece of notepad paper complete with yellow butterfly borders from her coat pocket and stands facing them. Even though she was only four, the small girl oozed confidence. Defiance shined in her eyes and Steve couldn’t help but feel like he was looking straight at Tony.
“Yes! We talked about this, Steve. Space would give us time to focus on ourselves before we heal together. I thought you understood!”
“Will do, buddy.” Steve replies with a nod, even though his friend can’t see him. It’s a sub-conscious reaction now, to nod and shake his head to himself when he’s on the phone. Bucky told him it’s because he isn’t using his words properly to express himself so he’s back to relying on visible gestures. Buck’s completely right, and that hurts like a motherfucker.
The night in question slams back into Tony consciousness with a breathy gasp. Blurry images of Steve yelling and crying at him swim into his vision and fuck nope, Tony had worked too hard to bury those memories for them to come and haunt him now. He shrugs and refuses to make eye contact with the other man, instead settling for a muttered: “You shouldn’t have left at all.”
Three days later- three fucking days, Pep- after Tony had fussed around Steve like Dr Beech and her stethoscope of icy death (“Steve, stop exaggerating, it wasn’t that bad!”) Steve had finally snapped and called Pepper in a huff to get Tony out the house.
She’s not angry. A fond smile sticks to her lips as she speaks, like she’s recounting the complicated relationships of somebody else and not the man she had loved more than anything.
He parks the car just behind Tony’s favourite Audi, the sleek black spaceship glinting under the setting Midas gold. Knowing that he would never see Tony screech that thing right up to his shoes and lean out of the window with a smug grin causes a pulsing ache to lodge itself in Steve’s throat. An image of the war-torn battlefield that represented what was left of the compound catapults into his mind and he steels himself with a cough. This isn’t about him. This is about the people left behind, and
Tony had also done rather well for being bored out of his mind and had convinced a handsome man called T’Challa to join their party. Regardless to what Pepper thought, it was because the man was impressively intelligent, and not because Tony found him very fuckable.
“Stevie people aren’t all equally disgustingly thoughtful. It doesn’t make you a bad person. But if you feel weird about it then maybe just talk to Tony.”
The thing about Tony’s job was that it had cemented certain preconceptions in his mind. Especially when it came to love. Gone were the days when Tony believed that love was pure and beautiful and worth any and all pain. These days Tony was well aware of how painful and cruel love could be, he saw it every day after all. He didn’t let himself fall for the illusion of happily-ever-afters, true love, and soul mates. There were far more people suffering from unrequited love than the general public liked to believe and Tony was unable to look past their suffering. If only for the selfish reason that he didn’t want to suffer from it too.
So yeah, he’d spent more than late night wondering how he would die and he had never imagined that it would be like this. Dying alone, in some god forsaken decrepit condemned warehouse building, choking on the literal bunches of forget-me-nots that were growing in his lungs. The irony of his chosen flower wasn’t lost on Tony either and while he found he wanted to laugh, he couldn’t because it would hurt even more than breathing already did.
And while his romance with Pepper had fallen apart, that was the only instance in which Tony could envision himself being on the verge of catching Hanahaki. No one else in his life had come close to drawing him in and keeping him so enthralled. And no one had managed to be so engaging after Pepper until now with the Captain.
Steve didn’t talk to Tony about his frustrations though and they disappeared overtime but then Steve started to notice that Tony would do a lot of things without him. Steve would invite Tony to things and where once Tony would have agreed to go now he wouldn’t. He’d mention something he had to do for a class or he’d mention a Stark Industries thing that his father wanted him to help with. So Tony would be gone and Steve would find himself alone or spending more time in his old apartment with Bucky, Sam and Natasha.
The line moved forward and they were finally through the doors to the busy shop. Tony could make out the baristas running back and forth to fill the midmorning coffee rush that had their line perpetually out the door.
"Yes sir. I do believe Dr. Banner is making breakfast for the team with Captain Rogers and Ms. Romanoff."
“Tony, do you ever think about the future? What we’ll do together?” Steve asked as he placed down their stir fry.
"Jarvis actually got you out of bed?" Clint muttered trying to reach for the chocolate chips that Natasha was folding into what was undoubtedly waffle mix.
