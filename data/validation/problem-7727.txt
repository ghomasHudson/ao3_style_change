“You better tell that to Steve,” Tony said, his voice still tight with anger.
“No, old man, the internet isn’t finite,” he teased, then set a very large, very frothy drink in front of Steve, with Steve’s name written on the cup in neat block lettering.
“And I was able to save your entire hard drive, see? It’s all right here,” Tony said as he tapped a key, and the screen changed and there were all of his desktop icons where they belonged, with a new wallpaper that made Steve smile like an idiot. It was that selfie that Tony took of the two of them on the couch, both of them looking stupidly happy. Steve looked at Tony in awe, then launched himself at him and hugged him like an octopus.
Steve looked up at Tony, who studiously kept his back towards Steve, scrubbing mugs and banging espresso grounds into the trash. Steve couldn’t believe that there was any way Tony felt the same, but it had to be true. The lingering touches, the excuses to make conversation, the drinks, the art, the laptop…
“Green,” he mumbled roughly, trying to pull himself up to his unsteady feet, realizing distantly that he’d lost his shoes somehow. “Green, green, green, neon green….” He didn’t get fully upright before Steve yanked him back by the collar of his jacket, pushing Tony face down on the ground and holding him there with a knee in the small of his back, and ripped-
“It’s not that bad, it’s just old,” he said, frowning.
“So how come last time I got hit on an op, you didn’t pretend to be my husband and hold hands with me and kiss me tenderly and tell me everything would be all right while you cried into your Cheerios?” Sam asked mildly. Natasha slapped him on the arm. Tony squeezed Steve’s hand and Steve jutted his chin defiantly.
“We didn’t want to be public yet. Didn’t want to affect the team dynamic. Didn’t want to damage the public perception of the Avengers. We, um-“
“Now I wasn’t under the impression that you designed this pool for swimming,” Steve said in a husky purr, using both hands to push Tony’s swim trunks down, and Tony grinned wickedly, catching one of Steve’s hands and drawing it forward to touch him. Steve obliged, and Tony thrilled to be in his arms, to be so reverently explored.
But Steve was decidedly
“Definitely the most serious. The bullet nicked the carotid artery, which supplies blood to the brain. His CT came back clean, so I’m confident that we were able to fix it before it could cause irreversible brain damage, although he may be a little fuzzy-headed for awhile, and probably won’t remember much of the incident. The blood loss was significant, and combined with a mild concussion and the broken tibia, he’s going to be laying in bed for quite awhile healing up.” Dr. Cho gave Steve a small, reassuring smile and squeezed his shoulder. “I know it sounds bad, but I really do think that soon enough the worst thing he’ll be dealing with is the abject boredom of bed rest,” she said.
“Helen,
“Yeah, yeah, just… trying to write a scene in my head and got distracted.”
“See? It has a new HD display that is better than anything on the market. It has a liquid-state hard drive that I have a half dozen patents on, and more terabytes than even NASA could use. Every media port you could possibly need is here, and it has retrofit capabilities so I can add more as they’re invented. I can’t wait for you to try the writing software, it’s so good it even makes
Steve couldn’t help an explosion of laughter, his heart feeling even happier when Tony seemed pleased that his joke made Steve laugh.
“All right. But just you.” She looked around Steve at the others, offering a sympathetic smile. “You can all wait out here. When he’s stable enough to be moved to a private room, you can see him then.” She opened the door to let Steve rush in first, following him and shutting the door behind her.
“Go the fuck upstairs. Wait for me in the living room. I cannot believe how you acted tonight, the way you pretended I was just some hired escort and not your fucking husband. Do you know how embarrassing that is? Jesus, Tony,” Steve said, his voice growing hard, and Tony’s heart really did skip a couple beats, it was so believable.
“I love you, Tony,” Steve finally whispered, leaning in to kiss Tony. Tony closed his eyes, breathing him in, treasuring each warm touch.
“At least three more times,” he said, so sweetly, so gently, that Tony lowered himself until their chests were flush.
Tony always had more than one kind of armor. One was a gold-titanium suit, and the other was a bespoke gabardine three-piece with sunglasses that matched the tint of his tie, and a dazzling smile that enchanted reporters so much that they never quite noticed that it didn’t meet his eyes. But at their wedding, Tony had stripped away all his armor for Steve.
“Whoa!” Tony said, leaning back in the chair that he’d just slid into. “What, did I yank you out of Narnia, or something?”
“Is he…?” Steve breathed, his fists clenched, and Dr. Cho nodded.
Steve said softly, with not a little desperation. “He's my
“I knew it!” Natasha and Rhodey gloated simultaneously, and Sam rolled his eyes.
“Oh. Uh… Tony. Can I call you Tony? Of course I can, I call you Tony all the time… um, I didn’t mean to- I hope I didn’t cross a line, I- sometimes I just stare off into space when I have writer’s block and I-“ Steve was positively drowning in his verbal diarrhea, and Tony just leaned back in his chair and nodded along like an asshole, but Steve would have let Tony step on him if he wanted, for no other reason than because he was so gorgeous. Finally Steve slumped, defeated.
Before they left, Steve had Tony pinned, hidden behind an artfully draped curtain and a few large potted plants, slammed against the wall with one hand around Tony’s throat and the other over his mouth to keep him from moaning, as Steve scolded him in a dangerous hiss about how embarrassed he was by Tony’s constant flirting with everyone, and how he needed to get his ass to the car now because Steve was tired of his shit. Tony gripped Steve’s wrist with both hands and could have cum right there in his tux pants, his eyes fluttering and face heating at the thrilling risk of being caught or heard, but they were far enough away from the crowd that they could have their play. Either way, Tony couldn’t mumble his red-faced apologies to their friends fast enough, making a hasty exit with Steve on his heels, the two of them laughing in high, thready, adrenaline-laced tones as they dragged each other in turns to the car.
Steve glanced up sideways, hoping to spend a few moments staring at the unfairly gorgeous barista who made him his black coffee every day, and made fun of him good-naturedly when Steve loaded it with as much cream and sugar as the cup would hold.
“Green,” he whispered back, and Steve huffed a pleased sound, then whispered a promise to be right back. The next Tony heard was the hard finality of the steel door slamming shut, and he stayed where he was, limp and curled naked against the cold wall, hands tied above him, covered in cum and spit and tears and apparently blood, although it felt like his nose had stopped bleeding a long time ago. His breathing began to slow, his heartbeat evening out, but his shivering ramped up as the sweat on his body cooled, and the heat of the intense pain gradually dissipated. He still floated in a hazy, indistinct headspace, and the wait for Steve’s return felt like both seconds and an eternity. Tony settled into it, letting the passage of time become nonexistent, his thought patterns quietly fragmented and comfortably veiled. He would come out of it when Steve brought him out of it.
“Like what you’re writing?” Tony prompted, amused.
“Mm, I’m starting to realize that,” Steve said, tapping his fingers idly on the cushion between them. He would be okay with Tony taking his hand. But he didn’t want to seem to eager. Tony looked at him with that perceptive gaze over the rim of his coffee cup, then rested it on his knee.
“How. Fucking.
When Tony lowered their hands, Steve rested his on Tony’s arc reactor. It was protective, the way he covered the light, tracing the edges with his fingertips, his body pressed close.
“This is fear shrieking and running around waving its stringy arms in the air.”

“Apparently Tony Stark.”
He took himself a little more fully in hand and did his best to draw out the act to a respectable length before he came. But pleasure, love, and vanity were his favorite cocktail, and it wasn’t long before he was gasping Steve’s name like a plea.
“Are you fucking serious?”
“It’s a machine.”
Tony followed Steve to check up on him. “You ok?”
“Are you kidding? She figured it out before I did. We’re friends, Steve. Fuck buddies. I know you don’t ‘get’ that stuff but not everyone in the world gets angry and jealous when someone they care about is happy.”
Clint wiggled happily in his chair. “Aw, that’s so great. It’s great that you could be honest and it was ok. That’s a great feeling.” He glanced at the ceiling and his smile became sly again. “Bucky and I did. Wanna know where?”
“So…” Tony rolled his eyes towards the ceiling. “Tell me about why you’re still so worried.” He added a Barbara Walters lilt to the last word for funsies.
Tony beamed. “Great. That means all we need is a tux for you, which you
Warnings: body dysphoria, masturbation.
He got up and rummaged swiftly in the bedside drawer. The harness was elastic, to run under garments without shifting, but Tony managed to add an insert piece that was a rod sensor. It was a higher tech version of a censor that transmitted to Steve what the dildo was feeling.
“Just because I’m Irish doesn’t mean I’m a wimp when it comes to spicy foods.”
Jarvis was right, at least about the first part. Steve needed someone to talk to, a human someone.
“And yet you love me anyway.”
“Depends on what it is.”
“I guess fate put that together for you because of this. Otherwise, it’d have just been Nat, Wade, Cable, and Domino. And we wouldn’t have been able to find you as quickly as we did.”
Tony could feel the little divot between his eyebrows getting tighter. How could he explain to this guy what it does to your sense of self when playgirl magazine does a piece on you when you’re sixteen that includes a day-counter for how long until you’re legal, prompting a flood of fan mail more creepy than almost anything else from men and women twice your age? He shook his head and sighed again.
“Can’t even call me by my name now?”
“Yeah, but I don’t like rhetorical questions. I don’t get to hear myself talk.” He put his arm around Steve and kissed the part in his hair. “Anyway, we should probably stop. You’re about to out-schmaltz the claymation reindeer.”
“But I’m not exactly ‘young’ either. I’m 30.”
“Tony.” Steve gasped. “You’re fuck-ing amazing. Beautiful.”
“Yeah, it’s a great house. Was in kinda bad shape when I picked it up, but the location.” He stopped, not wanting to get bogged down in small talk.
Tony nodded gravely and tried not to look too happy that for once it wasn’t him. “Wanna talk about it?”
“How is it I own nothing that works for this!?” Steve said as he rummaged through his pile of clothing he’d dumped on the floor.
“And the bravery reveals itself yet again.” Natasha said with a smirk. “And remember, I’ll also be at the gala, so you can search me out if you need to.”
Tony’s voice had gotten pretty rough after he’d had an hour to rest and calm down. He hadn’t realized how much he must have been yelling at some point. Or maybe it was smoke inhalation. He hoped it was smoke inhalation. He managed a smile for Steve, though, and croaked as he came close,
Tony leered lovingly at Steve. “I was thinking tails. Would that be too much do you think, Luce? He’s got such a great behind and long waist, I kinda want to make the public work for it.”
to say anything to their Soulmate. All the stories you hear, it’s like everyone figures it out at the same time and it’s like getting hit by a truck. Bucky didn’t even flinch or seem like he noticed anything. So, yeah, I’ve been feeling a little stressed out and bitter about the whole concept. And then you get this absolute Prince Snarking out of nowhere, falling all over himself to woo you and I guess I felt like… well ok, like a jealous jagoff. But you get it, right?”
Clint rolled his eyes. “Gee I don’t know. Because you’re in love with an incredibly handsome billionaire and cohabitating with him and he’s obviously into you and you’re both adults? Not like you have to, but I’m not crazy to ask. Sheez.”
“Heart murmur, several cases of the flu, asthma, scoliosis, scarlet fever, deafness in my left ear from an infection, horrible vision, but I don’t even know if I named them all.” He hadn’t, but the last one would wait for a while.
Tony smirked, but not unkindly. “Whatever it is that’s blocking up your head right now. It’s two in the afternoon, I haven’t done anything to warrant a hangover, but I feel like my brain isn’t working. I assume that’s coming from you.”
Warning: car crash and graphic depiction of injuries.
“Not sure. I’m pretty sure there’s one lady who dropped a car off this morning that was prodding me for information about who was around. But if she’s press it means they haven’t zeroed in on you as the most likely suspect yet. They’re just sniffing.”
Steve frowned a bit. There were two times he came out: to Bucky and Natasha, and to his mom when she was sick. He tried not to think about the second one so much, but Tony did ask. He took a deep breath.
“I’m not a homophobe considering I am gay!”
“Worried about what?”
Warning: mentions of past sexism and death.
Well, at least Tony gets laid at the end of the night.
Bucky sighed heavily into the receiver. “Steve,” It came out as a reflex, and he grumbled in his throat at the slip. “Man, why do you do this to yourself? Are you making up your mind about him or do you think he’s making up his mind about you based on this? Because if you think it’s important to him, and you’ve already told him your history, that’s all you can do. He’s gonna make his mind up however he does, and if my experience means anything, it’s not gonna have a whole lot to do with some number. If you’re making up your mind about him, well, you just gotta do that. You gotta decide what matters. Would you like him if the number was a million? Or zero?”
Clint smiled warmly and nudged Steve’s shin with his toe. “It’s ok. I’m just glad the last month’s craziness is settling out a little. And all for the better it seems like. I mean, Bucky’s still a little… Bucky, about stuff, but I think being confused about being with me is easier on him than being confused in a completely random and overwhelming way.”
“Thanks Buck, that… that actually helps.”
“Excellent Monsieur.” Tony laid out Steve’s order primly and left the churros on the table between them. He dipped one in his coffee and leaned in. “So tell me this impossible skin care secret so I can pine in envy forever.”
Tony nodded, “Yeah. Except yours was so good I feel like I should have gone bigger. It’s Barnes’ fault, really.”
Tony sighed. “The usual. Weapons. Tech. Everyone likes the guy with the toys.”

“Well… catching Clint and Bucky making out on the couch certainly shocked me.”
Pepina nodded and murmured something as she took his coat and laid it out on a table. She looked back at him and said,
“Nice eyes, yes.”
Steve shrugged. “I wanted to join the army when I was 18, and get deployed with Bucky, but they said I had too many health issues to be enlisted. Art was more of a second option.”
“Yeah, it’s been really quiet, which I guess is good. How was it for you?”
Steve sat down on the bed with a sigh. Even though Bucky was his Platonic Soulmate, he was probably right. Tony had made the effort after just seeing his sketches and a phone call, so there was probably hope. He looked down what he was wearing at the moment, sweats and a blue hoodie. Okay, he could put on the ripped skinny jeans with the hoodie and it could look cool but also laid back.
Tony cracked his knuckles nervously and leaned his elbows on his knees. “I just think you need to know… that you don’t know. I mean, I know you’re smart. I don’t think you’re naive. But there’s just… you really don’t know what you’re getting into. It’s… I mean…” He dropped his head into his hands and sighed.
Steve groaned playfully. “That’s even worse.”
Steve rolled his eyes and went to the fridge. He hoped the jokes weren’t going to be a regular thing. Steve reheated the lasagna and sat at the breakfast bar to eat.
Tony hugged him back, sighing audibly. “I don’t wanna let go. But I’m gonna.” He demonstrated, taking a couple meandering steps backwards. “See this is me. Respectful. And I’m gonna call you tomorrow. Because that’s the kind of guy I am. Now. Apparently.”
“Thanks for this. I don’t think I’ll look at store-bought gelato the same.”
(See the end of the chapter for
He held Steve a little closer and spun them around. “I gotta be me, I guess. Our press agent played it off as a joke, because I was in there with a girl as well as another guy. So the shots of me lip-locking him were passed off as a big embarrassing ‘oops! No homo!’ thing. But then the next time I was asked in person… I just… said it.”
“No robotic swans flying on cue. That’s where I draw the line.”
“Going in my contacts will definitely help me look better.”
“Can you sit on the bed for a minute? There’s something I want to talk to you about.”
Surprisingly Bucky grinned at that rather than shooting Clint a dirty look, which was their usual routine. He looked sheepishly at Steve.
“Good. Then, that.”
“It happens sometimes.” Steve took out his phone and checked his reflection. Sure enough, there was a smudge near his right temple. “I should take a shower after this, anyway.”
“I tend to assume they’re telling me because they want me to know. Usually when they want me to know, it’s because they think I might be trying to make up my mind. Usually I’m not.”
Tony walked sheepishly towards Bruce’s door, but the screw-head in him couldn’t help affecting a nasal tone as he called out, “Doctor Banner? I’m with the Daily Chatter…”
“Well sure. I know it’s perfect. You’re a brilliant designer.”
“That the universe is completely random.”
Tony nodded. “A zeppelin, probably. I’ve never gotten that far.”
Steve put the dishes in the dishwasher. “Three more days apparently.” He wiped his hands on a towel. “At this rate I’ll go through Tony’s entire Netflix queue before those days are up.”
When Tony handed Steve the harness, Steve immediately went to the bathroom and tried to be as quick as possible with switching everything out. He managed to get his shoe covered feet out of his pants and boxers without tripping. Then he put the packer over the rod sensor, and put the harness on itself. Since Tony had tinkered with it, he could feel that there was an air flow as soon as it was put into place. He got on his boxers, but put the packer through the front fly, and exited the bathroom.
“No…” Steve held Tony’s shaking hand. “No, you’d still have something he doesn’t: a heart.”
“You haven’t even seen the ring yet.”
“And Stane’s done. For good.”
Tony’s smile tipped up high on one side like a rocket being raised on the launch pad. He hooked his arm through Steve’s and began strolling them towards the hallway.
(See the end of the chapter for
Natasha nodded in approval. “There isn’t anything shield-related at the Gala, so that works. Just make sure to tell Tony before the Gala so you have that system in place.”
Tony softened a little and leaned forward with his forearms on the table. “That’s fair. If you’re not prepared to trust me, I get that there’s not a lot I can say that you wouldn’t just take as some kind of line, though. And to be honest this is my first time doing this highly specific kind of weirdness myself, so anything I try to tell you about how I am with a Romantic Soulmate would be me talking out my ass anyway. But lemme ask you. Do you really think that’s what’s gonna happen here? I mean, I’m not gonna walk if the answer is yes, I just wanna know what I’m starting from. Do you think that’s what I’m gonna do?”
Steve didn’t exactly know what to say… so he just nodded his thanks and went upstairs to the apartment. He went inside and sure enough, there was a thin wooden crate leaning against the breakfast bar, and Bucky was on the couch eating a sandwich.
Tony sucked on his lower lip. “So pick which one you want to wear to the gala so Lucinda can tailor your pants properly.”
“I’m not asking about people. I’m asking about you. Does my being a massive slut make you uncomfortable to be around me?”
“Do you want to look at my sketches?” He asked as he held the small sketchbook up. “It’s usually a good ice breaker.”
Tony shook his head. “I’m sorry, I don’t understand what that means well enough to speak with authority. I realize I’m being a total engineer right now but… no. I’ve never arranged my life like that and I have… “ He stopped himself and took a moment to figure out if it would be a disaster to be honest. “I’ve tended to avoid people that do. For their sake as well as my own. Because I don’t understand why it bothers you all, I just know that it does and for some reason it’s my fault.”

Steve ran his hand through Tony’s hair with a groan. “And you know I use it with clothes on. So get the - mm -
“I know people who have had lots of sex. It really doesn’t bother me.”
Steve sighed. “Ok fair point.”
“Outstanding.” Tony laid a colorful and fragrant plate in front of Steve with a flourish. “Things have been going ok with running the media gauntlet. After the tabloids have had their fun this weekend and made everything seem implausible, I’ve got a quick sit-down with an entertainment reporter. Just a quick ‘yes I’m in love, yes it’s serious, no we’re not ready to face the crowds, love to all my fans, you’ll be the first to know’ kind of thing.”
Steve moved over to his drafting desk and sat down. He had no clue if he could even respond after this. What exactly could he do as a thank you? Or what did people normally do when big billionaires bought them famous paintings? He was just a guy from Brooklyn, he barely had money to his name apart from student loans, and he was sick too often. Romantic Soulmate aside, this was too much too soon. He couldn’t exactly keep the painting, but he also didn’t know what to do with it either.
Lucinda looked at Steve, who was still a bit unsure. “Steve, Tony called in ahead of time about it, I don’t sell out my clients and I won’t judge. You have my word.”
Make sure to follow me on twitter and Instagram. Both are under the user @roryqpotter
Tony laughed. “Well, ok, I guess we can do it like that, then. Yeah, yeah absolutely I’m going to marry the shit out of you. But one condition.”
Steve took a deep breath. “Just not used to people ogling my ass.”
have your work separated from your home life.”
Tony nodded. “I will. But promise me you’ll try to.”
“Should I wear my contacts? Maybe bring a sketchbook?”
“Want me to go fetch?”
Tony kissed him on the side of his thumb, then his wrist, then pulled him into a hug.
“Are you str-etched yet?” Steve gasped.
“Not plotting,” Tony grinned. “Just needed a voice of reason. I have this tendency to go overboard.”
“Oh fuck, you feel so good. If I beg will you let me suck you?” Tony gave his best coquettish bossy-sub smile.
“Was I being negative?” Clint blinked innocently.
, because you referred to yourself as that a few times when you were drunk. It was a bit too perfect to pass up.”
Bucky sat down on the low dresser next to where Clint had perched himself. “Look, you just spent a week agonizing over how you didn’t want him to think he could buy you. And he can’t. You gotta keep up that mindset. You don’t gotta live up to his world. You don’t gotta pay him back for anything. Anybody that’s out with you, your presence is paying for itself, you got me? Anything else is just going to make you miserable.”
“I remember when I came out. Well, the second time. The first time, I came out to my dad, figured I’d get the worst over with first. He said it would be better for everyone if I went back in. So I did. I’m not real proud of that, but I look at kids who are the age I was then, and I blame myself less.”
"God knows. Certainly not me."
Tony only brought it up to his mom once; he'd come home from school exhausted and tear-stung. "Mom?"
She gave him a pointed look. "I'm just expressing my outside perspective. To me, it seems like you're concerned you'll have hurt him by attempting suicide, so instead of being honest, you're choosing to keep it from him."
Howard inclined his head. "Yes, it's nice to meet you all. Hopefully I'll be seeing more of the three of you - it isn't often this house gets visitors." He was looking awkward again and he nodded to himself. "Just call you mother or I if you need anything, Anthony." He turned to leave the room, but paused in the doorframe, one hand wrapped around the jamb, as if having second thoughts.
Her exclamation took Tony by such surprise that he lifted his head and stared at her with widened tired eyes. Maria sighed and shook her head.
"But you have feelings for him."
"Afraid mine isn't looking too good, either. Becca had some friends over last night and they're probably still hanging around, so unless anyone's looking to get a teen-girl makeover." Becca was James' younger sister by three years - Tony had met her only a handful of times and her protectiveness over her older brother had been quick to make itself apparent. Her straight dark hair and intensely dark eyes were startlingly resemblant of James' and their aching similar stubborn nature was nothing short of impressive, if not irritating as all hell at times.
" Irritation bled freely into his tone. His shoulder hunched up to his ears, muscles coiled tensely, like a defensive animal ready to attack or flee at any given moment.
"Well?" His father was resting his fingertips together in front of him. "Jarvis said you had something to share, Anthony. Better get on with it."
"My mom won't be home until late. We can crash at mine." Tony's voice broke through the still air of the car, leaving thickening silence in its wake; he had always avoided bringing the group back to the Stark mansion, for fear of something happening, or his dad appearing and making a fuss.
“And revoke her credentials to enter my shop.”
Bucky took his sandwich down to the shop.
Natasha shrugged. “I guess that’s just the effect of having a Soulmate.”
Tony’s face had slowly tightened at the top and gone slack around the jaw until he was genuinely gaping. “Jeez. That’s… wow. I know dating in New York is hard but that guy sounds like a prank show.”
Steve smiled shyly and held out his hand. “Steve Rogers, pleasure to meet you.”
“I do not have an ‘aw-shucks’ smile.”
Steve sighed. “I don’t know how else to phrase it… so… how many one night stands has Tony had?”
Tony knows who's been out to get him now, and he's not surprised. Steve and Nat take some advice from Wade, and the X-Men save the day.
“And do you forget that this is one of the best bakeries in the city? And I usually can’t afford  even one of those cannolis?”
Tony heaved a deep sigh. “He’s just told me some stuff about his life. Stuff that nobody should care about but could get him eaten alive.”
Steve raised an eyebrow. “What are you thinking?”
“I’ll also recommend he lock his office door and classroom doors so no reporters try to get clever.”
“Like crazy.”
“I must if I’ve put up with you for so long.” Steve gave Tony a peck on the cheek.
Steve rolled his eyes. “Usually I don’t have an entire kitchen’s worth of food to cook with.”
“It’s okay, we just finished eating anyway.” Steve said as they walked in. “At least you guys are meeting without me sick in bed this time.”
Lucinda nodded approvingly as Steve got back up on the riser. “Very nice. I like a man who is secure in his masculinity.”
“I feel like he’s worth it.”
“You know if Clint ever gets too mouthy with his over-share, you could always shut him up by letting him know where the sensor tech in his gear-daddy’s spanking hand got it’s alpha testing.”
Clint clapped him on the back. He sighed and pulled out his phone. “Ok ok. But if he asks why I’m sending him this you better admit that you told me to.” To Steve’s surprise, he didn’t actually take a picture of his marks, just pushed a few buttons with a widening smile and muttered. “Aaaaand send…”
“Then I think we’ll be fine.”
Steve blushed, but smiled timidly. Usually he hated being called cute, it felt diminutive due to his size. But somehow coming from Tony, it felt genuine.
Steve groaned a little louder as Tony started to move back and forth on his dick. He could actually feel Tony’s tongue shift around on him, the sucking sensation, all of it. He started to minutely thrust in time with Tony’s movements, and could hear Tony moan from fucking himself with his fingers. The vibration of his moans were almost too much.
For a moment, Steve just stilled inside of Tony and enjoyed the sensations. He was hot, wet, and tight, and Steve could feel every bit of it. He lightly pulled at one of Tony’s ass cheeks and pulled out painfully slow.
“No more questions.” Natasha cut in and ushered Tony into the building, meanwhile the reporters tried to get more questions in.
by the judgement on display here.”
Upon hearing Bucky’s words, Steve gently put the painting back into the crate, safely encased in it’s paper shreddings.
He was fluent in PR and was telling the truth but he slowly coasted to a stop and felt the urge to say something crazy. It was too soon, and wildly unfair when he basically had Steve under a form of house arrest, but he couldn’t help wondering how Steve would react if he just dropped the press-packet explanation to admit
Tony gave a laugh that was almost a caw. “I’d never ask you to promise that.”
“They figured out they’re Soulmates, simple as that, unless you want gratuitous details, in which case, I’ll have to pass.”
Tony already had his pants off and his shirt open and sat on the bed. He gave a soft appreciative moan at the sight of Steve, shoulders back and head high, as he came out of the bathroom. Tony beckoned him over,
“Yeah, let’s hope.” Steve placed a gentle kiss on Tony’s forehead and sat next to him on the hospital bed. “Definitely one of the more eventful Christmases of my life.”
“I’ve dealt with criticism like that my whole life. I’ve been told by every person imaginable that I’m not who I believe I am, or that I’m going to hell for who I date. I’ve been called every name possible for someone like me, before and after I transitioned. So you need to believe me when I tell you I don’t care about them, and that you are worth it.”
Both are @roryqpotter
Steve opened the door with a smile. “What brings you back so early?”
Tony grinned. “Well we’ve got that in common. I think my overall mutual-satisfaction rate has been a little higher, but I’m not exactly worn out on actual dating.” He shrugged.
For several long moments, there was silence. Tony could easily read through his fathers words, through the uncomfortable insecurity, to understand Howard Stark had been encouraging him to have his friends over more often, because maybe, just maybe, he wanted to get to know them better.
"My mom and Dad were arguing about it."
. And since I've been back home, it's as if someone took his already icy temperament and made it Antarctic." Tony sighed and wiped his hand down his face. "The only times we've spoken, it's been of some benefit to him."
"I know you do," he didn't even bother trying to keep the grin off his lips. "And I love you, too."
Howard Stark was yet to make an appearance, but Tony figured the night was still young and there was plenty of time for his dad to come striding in, all arrogance and permanently-furrowed eyebrows. Even though he knew his dad's judgement and approval wasn't everything, part of him was desperate for Howard to meet Steve, because Steve was basically everything Tony wasn't. And everything Tony wasn't, was exactly what his father had wanted in a son.
"Woah, hey. Don't apologise, you're not
Tony gave her the most innocent look he could muster. "And if I am?"
"Any time you boys are done disgracing that corner of my kitchen, dinner will be ready." Maria's light teasing tone drew Tony back into the moment and he eased himself down off his tiptoes; he was almost glad to see the flaming blush he felt spreading over his cheeks was mirrored across Steve's.
and I'm
Tony snorted. "You're telling me."
what you wanted me to hear?" The unrelenting malice in his voice was undeniable, no matter how much Tony told himself it was just his imagination. "Do you
"My therapist thinks I should join the local teen support group for mental health."
Jarvis must have lurking in one of the front rooms, because by the time Tony had closed the door and turned around, Jarvis was already standing in the hall, his hands clasped professionally behind his back, looking at the group with a playful expectancy dancing in his eyes.
The brown-haired teen sighed. "Yep. Dad hates the whole idea of it - the support group, I mean. Says he doesn't want anyone outside of the house knowing I'm fucked up, because it'll bring shame on the family name, or something like that. So basically, he doesn't want my issues creating bad shit for him." After a moment, he added, "he'd refusing to let Jarvis drive me to the Youth Centre, but also won't let me drive my car, still."
Tony nodded slowly; he could feel the eyes of his friends burning into him, expectantly. "Uhm, thanks." Refusing to let his father's contagious discomfort infect him, he added "this is Steve, James and Clint, by the way." He gestured to them in turn and in his peripheral vision, he saw Steve flash his father one of his winning golden smiles.
Somehow, 'taking a walk' turned into Tony sitting on Steve's lap in the backseat of his Camaro, his shins pressed into the leather-upholstered seat either side of his boyfriend's heavily muscled thighs, straddling them. His arms were wrapped comfortably around Steve's neck, his chin hooked over his shoulder. Steve's arms looped around him, his hands cupped at Tony's lower back, the side of his face pressed against the top of Tony's head.
"I'll just pop some toast in, shall I? Not much point cooking anything big up." She said, as if he hadn't spoken at all.
The teenager dug his teeth into his lower lip. He hoped that questions was rhetorical because it was one he really didn't want to have to give an answer to.
"Her name is Bethany. She's quite nice, actually." Steve said mildly.
The blonde looked at him with cautious but calm eyes; he didn't look like he was on the edge of a freak-out, or about to flip out, which calmed Tony's flighty nerves at least a little.
"I think you should eat something." Maria turned away from him and busied herself clicking open cabinets and restlessly shuffling spare cutlery about on the marble.
"Alright, where to?" Steve addressed the whole car, half twisted in his seat behind the wheel to face Tony and peer over his shoulder at the two in the back. "Anyone got a free house?"
"So, your attempt has made her feel guilty and worried, which in turn has made you feel guilty?"
The sudden sharp screech of chair legs on linoleum sent his head jerking up painfully. The greasy blonde guy had shoved his chair back violently and was stalking out of the room, shoulders hunched and fists clenched.
"The report said you ingested 14 zoloft and 40 paxil, Tony. You must have been planning this for some time."
Looking back on it, it was almost amusing how he hadn't noticed as his hours of sleep had trickled off. At one point, he'd regularly been getting ten hours, but then, somehow, it'd become two. God forbid you ask him what he did in those extra eight hours, 'cause
The dark haired teen shrugged nonchalantly. "I mean, he's probably at home, but that's not really an issue. He doesn't come out his workshop or office much and he doesn't really yell at me much anymore. He actually said something the other day about letting me have my car back soon, so I'm sure things are fine on the Howard Stark front."
A second floor window would be best, he decided.
*     *     *     *
The dark hair teenager sat back on his heels for a moment, then surged forwards to kiss the face in before him. Steve's hands suddenly spread against his lower back, splayed fingers stretching out over his tee shirt clad skin, pulling his body in towards his own.
"I can make a pretty mean steak, amongst other things."
"Don't be ridiculous. I'll drive you."
. The teenage boy's eyes widened impossibly. His father slammed his hand down on the white cloth clad table, forcibly enough to rattle the silver-plated cutlery against the delicately painted china plates. This time, Tony could not supress the flinch that wracked his muscles.
"D'you have any condoms in here?" Tony spoke between pants of pleasure as he picked his thrust rhythm back up again. Even though he knew they were both clean, condoms would at least mean he wouldn't have to go back inside to clean up; lube was less of an issue, as, though it wasn't the most comfortable thing in the world, saliva could make-do.
Steve gave him a look that said
Silence settled over them. "You know, sometimes I really think your father could do with some therapy himself." Steve mused.
"What about Steve?"
them to think you're a pansy? Do you
"Who found you?"
The dark haired teen gestured gestured to the butler. "This is Jarvis, our family butler." He glanced at the suit-clad gentleman. "Jarvis, this is James Barnes and Clint Barton." The inclusion of their last names felt odd in his mouth, like licking felt, but it had always been Jarvis' preference to address those he spoke to by their last name - Tony wasn't sure if it was generationally or occupationally related.
"Are you doing okay, Tony? Be honest with me."
Steve laughed softly. "Thanks. I know how highly you think of her, so her approval really means a lot to me." Before he could think twice about it, Tony stretched up and pressed a kiss against Steve's warmth-flushed lips. The accompanying affection that swelled in his chest was comfortable in a way that would have once frightened Tony and made him want to push his boyfriend away, but now it felt empowering.
To be fair, when he looked back on his childhood, Tony considered it a happy one. Images of picnics out in the (at the time) small, neatly trimmed garden with his mom, perched delicately on the blanket, leaning back on her palms, a syrup-sweet smile on her face. His father would wander out of the cramped workshop, his suspenders hanging loosely about his narrow hips like withered vines and wiping his grease-ingrained hands on a rag. He would slip his top few buttons free, airing the sweat-slicked skin of his chest, before easing himself with youthful grace onto the blanket beside his mother. They would sit and sip something sour and bubbly while he roared about the grass, pretending to be some car or plane.
A boy sitting a few seats to the right of where Clint had been seated cleared his throat discreetly. "Uh, I'm Bruce. I'm here because I have severe anxiety and intermittent explosive disorder. I lost control and nearly killed someone."
James gave a low whistle. "Fucking
. But now, hearing the musical laughter of himself, his boyfriend and his mom, it was hard to imagine the heaviness of the house had ever existed at all.
After his attempt, there had been a mutual agreement between Tony's parents to lock away the alcohol in the house, which, although irritating, was understandable. As his therapist had began to report back his improvement, his mom had started to allow some low-level drinking with dinner, on occasion. But having Steve over for dinner had obviously seemed like a significant enough milestone to let him have cocktails for the first time since the attempt. Not only that, but it was the first time Tony had been allowed to physically handle the alcohol, instead of Maria portioning it herself. It made him feel a little like he was a kid again, being given approval for sips of his mom's wine or his dad's dark pints of beer. As he stood at the counter, above which the spirits cupboard resided, he was reminded of being fourteen and his mom standing at his shoulder, carefully showing him how to make margaritas, martinis and sidecars. His hands had been carelessly steady then, but now he had to focus - almost uncomfortably so - to stop the tremor in his hands from spilling vodka down the side of the delicate shot glass.
Quick measured footsteps down the hall beside the dinning room yanked Tony sharply out of the moment.
"Your mother has informed me you are to see a therapist, which I have reluctantly agreed to only on the basis that it may quieten her woes. I do not expect to see your grades slip any lower than they already have, nor hear that you have been using this stunt as any kind of excuse for laziness, do you hear me?" His stern tone retained a commanding quality that ricocheted around inside Tony's skull like a ping pong ball.
" The moan slid willingly past his lips and he felt the hand around his cock slow to milk it gently.
*     *     *     *
"Uh-" His heart was thudding so violently in his chest, it was bruising his sternum.
Tony refused to be embarrassed about the sheer size of the Stark mansion as he thumbed passcode into the keypad set into the expansive stone wall beside the front door (he could have just knocked and Jarvis would have answered the door, but that had just seemed a little much, really). The cutting remarks from James and Clint had been mercifully light and low in numbers; he wasn't sure if they were deliberately holding back, but to be honest, he didn't really care to know. Finally, the keypad beeped cheerily at him and the celebratory green light flashed as a soft low-pitched
"You're not asking me, I'm telling you."
"What? No. I can't ask you to do that."
His mom had met James and Clint once before when Steve had dropped him off after they'd spent an afternoon hanging out and faffing about at a local park. Tony figured she'd been too overjoyed by the fact he actually had friends and let her meet them, to be too bothered by James' cryptically dark aura or Clint's urban dialect and awful potty mouth. To be fair to the guy, it was what he had grown up with; not that Tony had much of an insight into Clint's childhood, but from what him, Steve and James had hinted at, it had been filled with abuse of all flavours, shitty parents and foster homes.
As Maria turned to the stove to begin mixing a pot of cooked and drained pasta into another of thick creamy sauce, Tony turned to look at Steve expectantly. "And you?"
"So, where will it be?" The ease of Steve's tone was genuine, despite his obvious concern.
Tony sighed tiredly. "I know, I know, I should have learnt by now. I should be used to his incompetence and unreliability." Tony tipped his head back against Steve's arm, which was extended along the back of the sofa behind him. "I just hoped that once,
At school, all the kids would clamour endlessly about the latest bit of tech from Stark industries. Their juice-sticky hands would tug over and over at his shirt sleeves, demanding to know about the new StarkPhone and what it was like to live to be the son of an inventor such as he.
It had been a little while since they'd parked the only noise had been the rustling of takeaway bags and muffled crunching of burgers and crispy skin-on fries.
"You alright, Clint?"
His father cleared his throat a little, clearly uncomfortable. "Anthony-" He swallowed, adjusted his shirt and tried again. "Anthony, your mother and I have decided to go out for dinner. She suggested you and your friends ordering pizza, if you so wish." His hand rubbed each other unsurely as he spoke, before he pushed them deep into the pockets of his suit trousers. "Jarvis, er- said I would find you in here."
"It's better for both of us that way!" Tony burst out, his forehead creasing with an exasperated frown. "He doesn't get hurt and won't have to worry about me all the time, like mom is. And I don't have to feel guilty about it."
His mom inhaled sharply, as if she'd just caught herself on the pointed edge of something. Without looking at him, she said "we are very lucky to have your father supporting our family like this. A lot of families are not nearly as lucky as us. Your father loves us dearly."
He looked up expectantly at the doorway, just in time to see his father striding past without a thought to even glance in at them. An icy jolt of frustration burst through Tony; there was no way his dad wouldn't have heard them. The door was open and the corridor was pretty damn long - long enough that he would have heard the voices for a good several paces before he came upon the door.
*     *     *     *
Steve grinned from under him. "You know I am." God that smile could make him melt any day, and right now it could probably make him cum without needed for Steve to touch him. His hips stuttered out of rhythm as the other boy threaded his hands under his shirt, grasping around his back and drawing him back in.
Steve sighed again, but softly this time, more like a gentle exhale than one of exasperation. "Tony, I'm not going to let you walk to the damn Youth Centre and back, okay? That's at least forty minutes that I could do easily in ten or fifteen. It's only once a week and it's really not that big of a deal." He stopped and wet his lips uncomfortably before speaking again. "Also, I think James might end up going there, at some point."
"Mansion de Stark."
The first time had been the day Tony had come home from the hospital; his dad had co-incidentally been stalking, stony-faced, out of his mahogany-doored office as Tony had been stood in the front all of their oversized house, peeling off his coat and handing it to Jarvis.
Feather-light fingertips ghosted over his bicep and Tony jumped; Steve was at his side, an amused half-smile tweaking the corners of his mouth. "You alright?"
Tony nodded and turned back to his fries, dipping them in one of the little individual portion ketchup packets that had come from the diner.
Nauseating guilt welled in his stomach and Tony struggled to swallow back the sour bile that rose up inside. "I don't want it to reflect bad on Dad."
Eventually, they settled in front of the TV with Steve and Tony on the sofa, the dark haired boy's back pressed up against his boyfriend's chest as he sat snuggly between his spread thighs. On the floor, James and Clint had taken over one of the immense bean bags, with James sitting upright and Clint draped messily across his lap, like a weird fleshy blanket. Halo Multiplayer mode flickered across the television screen in bright colours and intense gunfire; their remotes clicked and vibrated aggressively under their rapid thumbs. It didn't take long for their competitive nature to make itself well-known, as Tony and James stalked each other across the maps, shooting each other mercilessly, regardless of their respective teams.
The butler inclined his head once. "Would you like me to inform Mister Stark of your arrival?"
"Do their reactions make you regret your attempt?"
Steve nodded slowly then glanced over his shoulder at the pair behind him. "That sound okay to you two?" After the nods and noises of confirmation came back to him, the muscular blonde teenager turned himself fully around in the seat and fired up the engine of his car.
"Oh." Tony fumbled for the right words, "I've invited Steve - my boyfriend - over for dinner this evening and I was wondering if you would join us and mom." He stumbled over himself slightly in the middle but refused to let himself be ashamed of admitting having a same-sex partner to his dad.
"Tony-" Maria's voice fell futilely against his deaf ears. In a blink he was half out into the hall, his legs working faster than his mind. He didn't know what he would say if he caught up to his father, but he was sure the right words would come when they needed to. The wet anger bubbling up into his throat was assuring him of that.
Steve's other hand, which had been holding his drink, freed itself and snaked around Tony's middle and squeezed him gently, before retreating a little to rub soothingly up and down his upper arm.
Gently, he teased his hand up and down Steve's cock, steadily picking up speed until he could feel the blonde's muscles tensing beneath him. Steve moaned breathily against his ear, kissing him sloppily and fervently, his eyes screwed closed and his mouth hanging half open; a face of pure fucking pleasure. As he approached the edge of orgasm, Tony slowed the rate of his jerks and Steve blinked open his eyes to frown at him. The dark haired teen knew his boyfriend wasn't truly annoyed at him, despite the edging.
"Yep. It's been only Jarvis for a few years though, now. We had a live-in cook and maid when I was a kid, but Mom let them go during freshman year because she wanted things to do around the house. Now there's just a maid who visits, like, once or twice a week, I think."
sounded out through the stagnant air.
"I'm sorry." Tony forced the sour words through his numb and unresponsive lips; they made nausea ripple through his stomach and his eyes itch.
Instead of answering, his mom took a generous swallow from her three-quarters-full wine glass and drifted her gaze over to their butler Jarvis.
Tony hadn't realised how much he'd withdrawn either until he dragged himself into the kitchen for the first day back to school after fall break in his freshman year and his mother had looked at him as if she'd never seen him before. A smile that didn't quite reach her eyes stretched against the tired lines webbing her face.
Tony felt his chest tighten and unconsciously pressed his lips into a thin white line. "What about him?" He replied, trying to keep any emotion from leaking into his tone.
"That's fine. I just want you."
. Steve. Faster, I'm gonna cum."
The rest of the evening felt misaligned and disjointed, like he was stuck on delay. Maria's mouth seemed permanently twisted into a pained pucker, as if her cocktail had been replaced with lemon juice.
Beside him, his mother uncapped the white wine and emptied the remaining dregs into her now-empty glass with trembling hands.
His mom smiled gently at him, her eyes finally allowing the warmth of it to seep into them. "I'll ring the doctor's practise when you've gone to school, okay?" She glanced over her shoulder. "I think your toast may have gone cold, though."
"But it's so
At that, he sat back on his heels and pulled the waistband of Steve's boxers down, tucking the hem of his shirt out the way. The inside of his underwear and the head of his swollen cock were sticky with pre-cum and Tony's cock twitched at the sight. Spitting into the palm of his hand, he grasped the shaft of his boyfriend's prick and slowly stroked upward, revelling as the boy under him moaned throatily in response.
"Good afternoon, Mister Stark." Jarvis had greeted him and Howard Stark had nodded formerly back to him, before sliding his focus onto his son. His eyes hardened with something that made Tony uncomfortable to think about.
shut softly behind him, Tony approached the large glossy mahogany desk that squatted in the centre of the office, surrounded by award and book littered shelves of the same rich wood. Howard Stark was sat dressed in a deep royal blue suit behind his desk, ink fountain pen in his hand, pouring over sheaves of documents and elegantly swirling out his curled signature at the bottom of each one. Somehow, Tony had failed to inherit legible handwriting from either of his parents; though, he supposed, he'd only ever really seen his father's signature and supposedly, the more intelligent you are the messier your handwriting, so there was still hope.
"Tony, I'm so
"Hopefully I didn't get any of that on the seats." Tony mumbled.
- to get out of there. To get away. Because, in all honesty, anywhere was better than home.
"No." A tightening sensation he hadn't even been aware of until that very moment suddenly seemed to release - like a breath he hadn't been aware he was holding. Gone.
The door swung forth and Howard Stark stepped cautiously through the frame, his usual confidence seemingly lacking. Tony's eyes widened in pure and untamed surprise - there was no way he could cover that one up.
Steve sighed. "Tony, look. I know you're used to doing things independently, but sometimes you've got to let other people help you."
Steve gentle tipped his head sideways to bump it carefully against Tony's. "Clint okay?"
He shook his head. "No, thanks. Not hungry." Setting his bag down on the kitchen island, he sifted through the many loose sheets of paper rammed in amongst his exercise and textbooks, double-checking he'd picked up his Physics homework. It was still an odd feeling to see his mom standing at one of the impossible lengths of pale glinting marble countertop, despite the fact she'd let their cook go at least three months prior; with Howard spending so much of his time locked away alone in his office, she had declared her interest in doing much of the housework herself (though, Tony was sure neither she or his father would openly admit that to anyone outside of the family).
"Deal."
"What about your dad?" The therapist's tone was deliberately measured and even: cautious but not fearful.
There was something about her tone, something he couldn't quite name, that made him want to tell her everything: the insomnia, the forgetfulness, the low moods and the numb self-hatred that had bled in unabated with them, the constant aches that wracked his muscles, no matter how much or how little he stretched, the disassociated detachment he felt from
Tony nodded. He knew Maria meant well, but there were only so many 'check-ins' and cups of 'wellbeing tea' he could take before it started getting on his nerves. The few times he had gotten overwhelmed and snapped at her, the stifling guilt had come sweeping back with vengeance as her skin had paled and she'd scurried back out the room, eyes watering, with raspy apologies and shaking hands.
As he pried his sweat-slicked palms away from his face, he was relieved to see that, at least, she wasn't gloating at him or smirking one of those little I-told-you-so smirks. Instead, that unopinionated soothing look was back, gentle and radiating ease.
Heavy-footed steps echoed down the polished hall and Tony flinched upright in his seat, his thundering pulse soaring as the oxygen to his lungs suddenly seemed to restrict. As Howard Stark entered the room, the first thing Tony noticed was the expression of unfiltered annoyance that was set bone-deep into his already exhaustion-lined features. Any resemblance of confidence drained from the teenager's entire being, his shoulders hunching up to his jaw as anxiety flooded his veins, so strong he could taste its bitter slick coating his mouth like bile.
Sitting on the concrete curb outside the house, it didn't take long for Steve's Chevrolet Camaro '69 rumble down the street and pull up smoothly beside him.
Against his better judgement, Tony stood suddenly, knocking his chair back to swing wildly on its two back legs; the frustration had spiked horribly into something he didn't quite want to think about. Something as bitter as bile and slick like a coiling snake in his stomach, ready to strike.
Rolling off his boyfriend's lap for a moment, Tony undid his own jeans and wriggled them off his legs as best he could, leaving them in an untidy heap, inside out, in the footwell of the backseat with his shoes. As soon as Steve's bare thighs were exposed, he took his seat back up again, his cock already aching almost painfully. Lurching forward, he thrust their boxer-clad crotches together again and moaned as the euphoria laced his veins.
Tony stilled. James was Steve's best friend and had been since childhood; the guy had longish dark hair and hauntingly dark eyes. He was quiet a lot of the time and had a heavy kind of energy to him - closed off and fucked up in ways Tony had no idea how to unravel. It was abundantly clear that James had deep-set issues, whether diagnosed or not; Tony had seen him flip out and lose control enough times to know that therapy would definitely be beneficial.
, and those were only the things he was sure weren't usual. God only knows what other shit was going on that wasn't supposed to be. Shit he had continually brushed off because it was fine.
"I mean, of course, me growin' up in poverty and you like this has an impact, on that." Tony knew the other boy's unbothered tone was hiding the harboured feelings of imposition that boiled beneath the surface, but decided not to comment on it; Clint was all about keeping up appearances.
"Well, when you put it like that, it makes me sound like a dickhead."
"No. Haven't gotten around to picking any up yet. Sorry." Steve sounded genuinely apologetic, but Tony just shrugged nonchalantly.
His light-hearted tone seemed to shatter the atmosphere like ice, and Clint surged forwards to give his boyfriend a hand, while Tony choose to sidle up to Steve on the sofa. He was busy fiddling the TV remote, his lap full of Xbox controllers, their lights glowing luminous blue, green and white.
Once the circle was over half-full, Holly clapped her hands together with a wide smile. "Right. Let's get started." She looked around the circle for a moment. "Looks like we've got some new faces here, so I think an introductions would be a good idea. I'll start, shall I?" She paused for a moment, then continued when she realised no one was going to say anything. "My name is Holly and I'm the Social Worker for this teen support group." She gestured to the girl sitting one seat to her left.
Eventually, Steve had returned with two grease-spotted brown paper bags clutched in one hand and two bottles of coke in the other. Dumping the feverishly hot packages onto Tony's lap, Steve had left the parking lot heading away from the city. Living in the suburbs meant it hadn't taken too long to reach a hiking area, where they'd pulled off down the side of a service road and parked with the bonnet of the car pointing into the dense treeline of a small forest.
"Not yet, but I think he might soon." Steve pinched the bridge of his nose and exhaled slowly. "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to make this about James. "
It wasn't like Tony didn't want to bring Steve home to meet his parents - in all honesty, he had looked forward to his mom getting to meet Steve for a long time - but the thing was, a part of him was holding back. Despite the fact Howard Stark had been absent in so many areas of his life, Tony still found himself holding out hope, hope that his dad might actually want to meet his son's significant other. So he'd waited and waited for the 'right' moment to ask him, until James Barnes, his mom and even goddamn Clint Barton, had just told him to go for it and ask his dad.
“Hey Jarvis.” He called to the air.
Tony nodded, his face serious. “I know. I know you’re tough. But I promise you, you haven’t been called everything you might be called. And you haven’t been used as a metaphor for gross sex acts by Jay Leno five nights a week for a month. I know we’ll survive it, because we can survive anything, I do believe that, I’m just saying, I can’t drag you through this if your eyes aren’t open.
Tony nodded, and tried his best not to be ridiculous, although it did make him a little jealous. With a smile of self-satire he growled,
“Yeah. Tell me about it. I could sell everything I own and still not be able to pay the taxes if you declared this.”
“Yeah, totally, be right back.” Tony scythed through the crowd to the counter and over-ordered only slightly before he headed back to the table and sat down. “They’ll call. When it’s ready.”
Tony leaned on his elbows. “Yeah. I should do that. I should. You’re right. I guess I just-”
“He’ll think I’m one of those stuck up hipsters.”
Steve couldn’t help but kiss him in that moment. Somehow, the word ‘amazing’ kept replaying in his head as he kissed him. Because that’s what Tony was, amazing and handsome as hell. He pulled back and said,
“I internally cringed when I said it, I was demonstrating how much of an asshole Patrick was.”
“Still, thanks for being so great. I know it’s not easy on you. I’m trying to get it sorted out as fast as I can.” He gazed at Steve’s sweet clear face, and didn’t especially care that he was probably looking sappy.
“If you don’t tell him, I’m gonna. And my version is getting less flattering to you by the second.”
“Anything in particular you’re smiling about?”
“Possibly, but I doubt it.”
“Most of them did. And were terrified that they’d have every bone broken if they kept talking to me like that.”
Tony begrudgingly fixes the arc reactor, Steve makes a friend out of catcalling weirdo, and they finally make contact.
Bucky flicked his scowl up from the floor, but checked himself before saying anything too reflexively protective. “Does that seem… smart?”
“Well shit,” Tony nodded, not looking up. “I’d say that’s a good thing. If you happened to be as good at war as you are at drawing, there’d probably be too many dead people in the world.”
Tony smiled at his own tremoring hand. “That would be good, Better if he’s willing to take me up on the offer of a job. But, yeah, I don’t feel like I did anything wrong changing direction. I feel like maybe this happened because I didn’t change fast enough. I don’t know. It’s not logical. Just that Stane asked me what I would be if I weren’t rich and gifted and famous, and all I keep thinking is that I’d be just like him. And that scares the shit out of me. Like I made him happen somehow.”
Natasha, of course, had noticed Tony’s change in attitude. She also kept track of all of his calls, so she knew he was doing a bit of stalking about the painting (which she of course told Clint about, but not Bucky because then he’d tell Steve). She hadn’t thought it was good to say that the painting was a bad idea since Tony didn’t ask, and from the way Bucky sounded on the phone, she had been right. She went down to the workshop to do her usual check-up on Tony and saw probably five different half built machines that hadn’t been there a week before. Well, she couldn’t stay quiet now, Tony was worrying enough to come up with things that didn’t even matter. And was that a
Bruce looked red faced and his posture said he was about to break something. And given that there was some broken glass near his bookcase which looked like the remnants of a cup, he’d probably done that already. Tony tried to keep an up energy, the better to let Bruce vent at him.
Tony hugged him back in silence. He’d been slightly terrified that it would be too much again, or too soon, or too creepy, like he was trying to tailor Steve’s body to his own tastes. He was really bad at gauging that kind of thing in casual situations, and lost his sense of scale completely where Steve was concerned. The relief alone rendered him speechless.
call me first.”
“It’s okay.”
“He’d do better letting them sit through his lectures. They bore easier than they scare.” Tony sighed. “I hope Steve’s doing ok. I know I shouldn’t call during the day but honestly, I feel like I’m going through withdrawal, you know?”
Steve didn’t say anything for a moment, just gathered his thoughts the best he could.
“It’s not what
Steve lead them inside and shut the door. “Filled with physics equations I barely understand, but also sketches I could easily do.”
“But you’re assuming the worst. You won’t know what he’ll think about this until you ask and he probably has some idea considering where he is right now.”
Bruce sat up and leaned his elbows on his desk. “What’s changed between when the audio was first released and when you saw Steve last night?”
Steve swore he couldn’t breathe for a moment. That was just… he didn’t know what it was, but it was nothing he’d ever heard before. He couldn’t exactly think of anything else to say but,
Tony sighed and didn’t let go as the song cycled to the next. “I’m sorry.”
“He stressed-out a little yesterday morning, but there were no hallucinations or panic spikes, which his doc says is actually a good sign, that there’s some room there between having an intense reaction and having a full episode. We handled it. He couldn’t…” He grinned at his hands. “He couldn’t get why he was still feeling so unsettled and weird if you were doing ok. And I finally stopped being a dipshit and realized he was having feelings, he just wasn’t trusting them or showing them. And it was stressing him out. So I bit the bullet and told him what I thought it was.”
Clint rolled his eyes. “Because I never heard of anyone actually
Knowing how Steve and Bucky met, it kind of made sense that he couldn’t pick it up. “Buck thought I was his Romantic Soulmate when we met, so it makes sense why he didn’t notice.”
“What? Ask Thor. Rich people get up to all kinds of weird shit.”
“Does it bother you to talk about it? Before, I mean?”
Bucky grabbed the heavy-duty stapler off the table and used it to hammer the lid of the crate back down like he was sealing the ark of the covenant.
“I guess you could say that the goal was to have one part of my life without a goal. Your turn. Does that make you uncomfortable?”
Clint sat down opposite him. “Hey, congratulations, man. That’s a big step.”
“And… they won’t mind about the whole… y’know.”
“Stevadore?”
Natasha had already contacted the major networks and promised them each a different sort of exclusive access to the story at a later date, in exchange for pulling Banner’s audio off the recording and transcripts as they ran with it. No one else had to be dragged into this mess because of Stane, and Natasha would keep it that way.
“Hey, Steve. Tony. Stark.”
“It’s just… I needed someone to talk to.”
Tony winced. “I hear you. I hear what you’re saying. Problem is… I mean, what if he decides to go through with this? He really doesn’t understand how bad it can be. Like, he’s been through stuff, he’s not naive, but you know how it is. It’s one thing to look at the water and another thing when you’re in it.” Bruce opened his mouth to reply again but Tony plowed on. “And if he decides not to, if he decides he can’t handle it, or doesn’t want to… I just… I mean that’s it. I’m kind of a package deal at this point in my life.”
Tony shrugged. “Stuff. Dirty stuff. And the quantifiable properties of Soulmate sex. We could get a grant and everything.”
Sam’s eyebrows lifted and he pursed his lips in appraisal. He nodded slowly. “Well, can’t argue with a feeling like that.”
Christmas is here, and Steve gets to meet Tony's platonic Soulmates. But it seems that someone is out to get them, and they'll need help.
“Well… I have thought about it. And I know that if I want to date you I have to deal with the media too. But… I think you’re worth the trouble.” Steve smiled. “Even if I have to hide out every now and again.”
“It’s called vibranium. Fun stuff. On the inside it just says ‘My Hero’. Because you are.” He pivoted to turn Steve’s embrace into an impromptu dance as the rest of the room took the cue to start acting normal again, and the sound of a lot of champagne corks came from somewhere Steve wasn’t looking.
, which was what he was worried about.”
Tony put his arms gingerly around Steve and murmured into the scent of his hair, “Yeah. We’re safe.”
“I figured that’d be a given.”

“You know what? He’s your Soulmate. Whatever you think is right probably is.” He headed to the kitchen to make a sandwich.

How everyone copes with the audio being released.
Tony felt his smile go all lopsided as he tried to figure out how to stop the pleasant smalltalk and get down to the heavy stuff considering he didn’t want to do either. He sighed.
“Ok, fair. Do I get to ask for something?”
“Ok, well it sounds like you guys have some stuff to talk about so I’ll get out of here.” He glanced at Steve. “See you this weekend, Steve.” He made a couple second’s significant eye-contact with Tony and let himself out.
“I’ve only dated three guys. One kept me as a dirty secret, the other slept with me once then left. Then I wanted to actually wait with the third guy, and he got tired of waiting so he slept with a woman. It’s stupid, but I think there’s this deep-seated fear that it’ll happen every time I find someone even remotely attractive. And in between those exes I’ve only been on first dates, rarely ever make it to the second date, so…”
Tony grinned a little wistfully. “Yeah, I figured. I just wanted to hear you laugh again. Have you ever heard you laugh? It’s amazing.”
Warnings: past mentions of homophobia, transphobia, and overall asshole exes.
He was absolutely
Tony was practically vibrating with excitement. He loved a guy in formal wear, and Steve’s long silhouette seemed to have been made by the god of couture for a black tux.
His smile grew exponentially. “Great.”
Bucky nodded as he got up, his voice gloomy but trying. “Yeah, I’m glad he’s taking this seriously.” He patted Steve on the back on his way past. “I got some work to do. Congrats, man.”
“And who would be the angry jealous one in this situation?”
“Mr. Stark! Does the audio released mean you have a Romantic Soulmate or is this another fling?” One reporter asked.
“Yeah but look at you dude. The criticism hasn’t even happened yet and you’re already sweating.”
Tony laughed. “There’s a non-perverse way to look at pudding?”
“So what about you? I just aired out my relationships, what about yours?”
“Ok… and when you have, call Bucky.”
Warning: torture, violence, and death.
Steve was taken aback. Everything Tony had said made it seem like he slept around like the tabloids suggested. He never would have guessed that he’d… had a healthy amount of partners.
Steve smiled. “Then never call me Stevearino again and we’ll get along fine.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve followed Tony to the kitchen and started wrapping up his steak dinner. It wouldn’t be as good as it was now after being refrigerated, but he wasn’t going to pass up the opportunity to eat with Tony. He got himself a glass of soda, some forks and spoons, and sat down at the table.
Tony lit up. “Can I see?”
think Steve will leave you? Or is this fear talking?”
He… hadn’t really thought about that. Tony had told him about possibly being kind of an icon for the LGBT community by being in a public relationship, but could he handle hiding out when there was something big like this? Would he have to hide again when the media found out who he is? But Tony… he was just so energetic and happy when they were together. He made Steve smile just by being himself, and that didn’t happen often with people. It may have been early in the relationship, but Steve felt he was worth it.
Tony finally sees the design, and his whole world is flipped upside down from what it means.
Steve smiled and nodded at Bucky. Once Bucky had left the apartment, it left Steve with Clint, who was on his phone. Which meant Steve could do some interrogating like a good friend does.
They walked into the shop, and there was an older but obviously fashionable woman behind the front counter with long brown hair, a white blouse with a tape measure hanging from her neck, and black dress pants. She looked up from her book and beamed at Tony. Then she walked out from behind the desk and opened her arms.
He immediately picked up.
“Am I allowed to make phone calls?”

Lucinda nodded and called towards the back room. “Ay, Pepina!”
“Well apparently celebrities do this a lot. When the news cycle gets too aggressive, they hide out until it blows over. Tony just didn’t want me tracked by paparazzi, and Bucky… I’m just thankful nothing has triggered an episode yet. Not to mention Tony made sure he couldn’t access the cameras no matter what. He just doesn’t want me hounded by the press.”
Tony nodded, relieved. “Ok, good. I just… “ He sighed. “I haven’t always been the pillar of wokeness you see before you. And every mistake I’ve ever made is on film somewhere. And if you go digging,” He looked down. “I’ve been an asshole before. And I don’t want you to give me your blessing on that, I just… didn’t want you to be shocked. Not that I think there’s much that can actually shock you.”
Tony huffed. “I was getting to that part. You have to say yes first.”
Tony took Sam’s hand with a moment of trepidation, unsure whether he was the kind of guy to get into macho-hand-crush stuff with the new boyfriend, but Sam’s handshake was just firm and assured. Tony nodded.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Sorry, but my asthma would act up if I did that.”
“What is it? If it’s a painting of him it’s staying behind the sofa.”
The sensation of being jarred and filled and stimulated and shaken to his core swept up through him. He dug his fingers into the covers and squeezed Steve by the wrist, matching his already-escalating thrusts and shifting on his knees to get it right where he wanted it.
By the time the second night rolled around, Steve got half of his homework done for his next week of classes. It was definitely difficult to do Physics without Dr. Banner’s help, but he managed (with some help from Jarvis). He had just finished making dinner for himself when Jarvis announced,
“If you say my bed I’m burning it by the tire pile.”
“Give me… a minute.” Steve slid his hand down Tony’s front and lightly gripped his hard cock. “Not done yet.”
Bucky frowned. But fair was fair. “You eat?”
Steve immediately went to the hospital after Nat told him where Tony was being taken. He didn’t even need to ask which room he was in, he just followed the Soulmate bond straight to him. By the time he got there, Tony was being bandaged up for what looked like electrical burns and Steve’s heart broke. Tony looked like he’d been to hell and back with burns, cuts, bruises, even a black eye. Maybe he’d take up Natasha’s offer on killing Stane after all.
“How about Stevaroni?”
Tony gave a heavy sigh. “I give you a pop quiz and have to stand for the pop bar exam, ok…” He sat back and thought for a while. “Well, where relationships are concerned, I guess there have been about four? Not counting you?” He felt like a weenie for being so unsure, but he’d been an ethical slut for so long the definitions most people used took some thinking to apply.
“Yeah. I’d like that. But, listen, you should know about me, right up front, if you didn’t already, I’m kind of a pretentious asshole. Like, I practically re-invented the form for my generation. I get all antsy in public. People get touchy and stuff. So, if it wouldn’t make you feel too, I dunno, bribed or whatever, would you let me take you for coffee my way? No strings, gold or otherwise, I swear to god. I just want to have a snowball’s chance of acting like myself.”
“I don’t know how Tony does it. This already seems like a lot.”
Tony pulled Steve in for a stiff business-bro hug that quickly melted into something altogether different. Instead of popping Steve on the shoulder blades with a firm no-homo pat, he found himself just holding him, like a friend just home from war. And oh god, how could anyone real smell like that?
Tony pulled back with a sigh. “So, brass tacks, there’s a benefit coming up. It’s an annual memorial charity ball in my mom’s name. Pepper thinks it’ll be the best time to make our big splash, and I think she’s right. Would you be my date?”
There was a small plastic pop and Steve could feel the way Tony’s lips went soft and quivery as he started to prep himself. Tony rocked slowly with his own touch, and his breath got warmer and ran deeper. He turned his head, eyes closed, to run his open mouth down the side of Steve’s shaft to his head, describing the motion of his fingers with the tip of his tongue, prodding and rolling.
Steve took a bite of his gelato, and had to stop himself from moaning at the absolutely amazing texture and taste in his mouth. “I’m waiting for if we do another date, and another date after that.”
“How does that not surprise me?”
Jarvis seemed to take a thoughtful pause.
“Pepper and Nat would tell you the same thing and you know it.”
“That’s good, I guess. So listen, call me tonight if they let you. I worry.”
“You should still probably move in. Just to be safe.”
Steve sighed. “He’s not on cocaine, end of discussion.” He said as he got up and went to the door.
“I wasn’t sure how spicy you like it, so I got kind of an assortment. It’s all still a little on the spicy side, though.”
Steve was so happy to be looking at his apartment again. It was nice to have a bit of a vacation, but he missed home a lot. It was also a day when the shop was closed. So Steve went upstairs, and was shocked by what he saw when he walked into the apartment.
“Nothing, I just really like looking at you. You’ve got a little smudge of charcoal at your hairline and it’s the cutest thing.”
It is time for the Mariah Stark Gala... but someone crashes the event and causes a scene.
“Well if I had enlisted, I wouldn’t have met you, so there’s that.”
Steve loved Sam, he really did, but the teasing was a bit much at times. However it was cancelled out by Steve being happy that he had company for once. Talking on the phone and talking to Jarvis only worked for so long.
“People can do whatever they want.”
“Glad you have that failsafe in there.” Steve kissed his cheek and laid his head on Tony’s shoulder. “Thank you.”
Sam gave him a sincere, wistful smile. Then, as if to cut the tension he grinned and asked. “Are you sure he’s not just on cocaine? I hear you gotta test these rich dudes.”
“I said I could handle the
“Yeah, I’d love to. But tell me what you want and I’ll go order first. The food takes forever here but I promise it’s worth the wait.”
Obligatory Steve gets sick chapter. And a second date ensues.
Steve held on tight and kissed Tony’s cheek. “But I can’t promise I won’t smash a few cameras on occasion.”
“Then take some migraine medicine before you get there.” Natasha countered.
“I’m not mad at you, I just… I’d heard you did that for other people and…” What the fuck was he trying to say? Goddammit, Rogers, get it together. “In terms of making a first impression, buying someone an extremely expensive painting isn’t the way to go.”
“Well it’d be impossible for you, so no luck there.”
Tony smiled and looked at his scarred hand and how it had stopped trembling. “Thank you,” He murmured. “It’s perfect. I have a confession, though.”
He leaned over the car, pulled a wire from one port and plugged it into another. Lights shone up from the chassis as the lights in the room dimmed, and a disco ball lowered through the ceiling as music started to play from inside the car, just a little grainy for authenticity, some old slow dance from the second world war.
As they got into the elevator, Natasha got a text. “Bruce is apparently being harassed at work. He’s already scared three reporters off.”
Tony got up off the desk and sat down heavily in a chair. “If I say I’m starting to think he’s too good for this evil evil world will you laugh?”
Tony laughed, “Clearly we need a wedding big enough to be covered by the international press. Just to make sure he sees.”
Steve shivered in anticipation… and suddenly stopped regretting wearing the 4 in 1 packer to the party instead of his usual. They also kept the harness and insert in Tony’s room for special occasions.
Steve ran his cock over Tony’s cheek, and relished in the realistic sensation of Tony’s skin against the head. “And you’ll fuck yourself on your fingers, so you’re halfway there when I’m ready.”
Tony thought he had done a good job with his selection of a gift. Sophisticated, tasteful, maybe a little over-the-top but that was really just truth in advertising, he figured. So when Steve didn’t call, it started to eat at him from all sides. He triple-checked with the auction house and the security company that the crate had been delivered. He might have sortakinda taken a peek at call data to the garage, just to make sure their phones were working and someone was there. When nothing helped to solve the mystery, he decided to plow his nervous energy into building something in his lab.
“Like you read my mind.”
Tony gave a look of sympathy and concern, and turned away to pack things up. They left the store, and decided to grab a bite to eat before Steve’s first dance lesson. Again, Steve had to keep himself from having a heart attack over the prices of this Manhattan cafe. He sat awkwardly in his seat across from Tony, and warily looked around.
Tony grinned. “What did you do?”
“Here,” Bucky put his sandwich down and wiped his hand on his jeans. “I feel like I should do the honors. I’ve been here guarding it for two hours.”
“That’s not exactly what I wanted to talk about.” Steve gripped a bit tightly onto the velvet box behind his back. “Tony, you are probably the most amazing man I have ever met. You’re kind, you’re a genius, you find solutions rather than focus on problems too long. When I first drew that sketch of the paint job you wanted… I was scared shitless because I thought some random Stark Industries rep was my Soulmate. Then Bucky told me it was you, and I almost thought about ignoring it. Then we made our mistakes, and we finally met.
“We both can now!” Nat called from the other side of the room.
“My mom actually taught me to start out, but I go to NYU. I’m finishing my last year, actually.”
“It makes you seem like you’re bored of everything and not taking coming out seriously. And you can’t risk looking like that this time.” Nat explained.
Tony braced and felt a hot tingle rush up his back at the sweet satisfying pressure and fullness of feeling his boyfriend, the
Tony sighed. “Look, when I’m dragging you through my world, it makes sense for me to furnish the trip. You’re doing me a favor by being willing to navigate this nonsense, and I appreciate it. But I wasn’t kidding when I said this was training wheels day. This is as gentle as the embarrassment and objectification is gonna get. Still think you can handle it?”
The conversation flowed easily after that. It turned out Tony and Steve liked the same baseball team, Tony pranked his friend Rhodey at MIT, and Steve confessed that he’d never been out of New York City apart from field trips. The baked goods were amazing as well, and all in all, it was a great first date. About two hours later, the two of them wormed through the crowd and onto an empty part of the sidewalk.
Tony moaned with mingled torment and delight. He loved the way Steve teased him, loved finding out which of them would start to press for a rhythm first. It felt good to let go of everything and just dive deep into how much he
Steve let out a breath when the door shut behind him. “Honestly, I was afraid he was going to try intimidation on you. The fact that he didn’t is a good sign.”
Tony held out his right hand. “Hey, you must be Steve. Actually-” He dropped his hand and opened his arms. “Do you hug? I’m kind of a hugger. Except when I’m not. For you, I’m thinking definitely a hugger.”
“Well that’s good to hear.” He wiped his eyes with a dirty hand and cleared his throat. “I’d really like you to keep the painting. I’d rather live in a world where it’s with you. My friend Pepper showed it to me and it was like it belonged to you in my head. I’ve already had my lawyer do the paperwork, you won’t have to pay a cent in taxes or anything. And if you’re worried about keeping it in good condition you could always lend it to a gallery. I just want you to have it. As a thank you. Because it’s like you reached right into my heart and pulled out exactly the piece of artwork I wanted and couldn’t do for myself, and there’s no paying for that, you know? I didn’t know what else to do.”
“He chose to stay with you even after the media released the audio. He’s stayed at that location because he knows you’ll handle it, that you both can handle it. He’s capable of saying no to the Gala, but he’ll feel like he’s being forced if you don’t ask at all. Communicating these fears to him would be the best thing to do so that you can avoid them.”
“Ok, I know for a fact that’s impossible.” Steve teased. “But Clint, weren’t you dating Natasha?”
“Making people feel like less of an idiot is my specialty.”

“You need to worry less, is all,” Clint called after him. “it only makes people try to fix things.”
“Sure. But it’s actually good animation for the time it was made.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“So after this, then what? I mean, is this a new normal you’re prepared to shoulder? Because I don’t think your boy’s getting unfamous any time soon.”
He gathered a tray with two cups of gelato, two cannoli, one latte, one hot chocolate, and a packet of mini-churros. He pirouetted his way back to the table through the crowd and set it down with a flair.
“That has to be a reproduction or something. That - this can’t be what it looks like. That would be insane. Tony Stark is known to have a sense of humor, right?”
Steve looked at the box, intrigue showing clearly on his face. “Did you buy me some new shirts or something?”
He didn’t really want to go into it, how he was just too used to feeling things that weren’t real, how easily stress could cross his wires and leave him thinking he was feeling something when nothing was happening. So he just gave Steve a pleading look and asked,
Clint laughed. “Gay bashing! Gay bashing! I’m being bashed!”
The elevator opened to Tony’s waiting room, and they went to his office. “Let’s be glad he has a terrifying temper that scares people. It’s great reporter repellant.”
Tony stepped up and moved to give Steve a little kiss on the cheek. “You’re too good to me. So how’s your day been?”
“I guess I stopped being a jerk?”
Steve shrugged. “He said I could know anything I wanted, it’s just the first thing I could think of.”
“So you didn’t usually buy all those people dinner before you took them to bed?”
“Well next time you tell him if any weirdo is gonna over-do a romantic overture at you in public it’s gonna be me. Unless he’s clearly helping you out of a bad situation in which case I guess I’d be a massive schmuck for begrudging him that. Little hero moment.”
Steve chuckled. “I think I can determine that for myself when we meet. Then you should know about me that I’m incredibly stubborn and if I see someone doing something to someone else, I’ll always try to step in. That usually results in some bruises and the occasional broken nose, so I hope you’re ready for getting calls from an ER every now and again.”
Tony shrugged and winced. “Annoying reindeer it is.”
Steve laughed. “Did you basically just ask me to a dance?”
Steve went over to the coffee table and picked up his school sketchbook. He opened it to the page of rough sketches, mainly of the arc reactor. His instructor wanted him to draw something mechanical and complicated, so it made sense to use Tony’s invention. And Jarvis was a great help projecting file photos of the plant. He handed the sketches to Tony.
“Wow, I gotta say, I was all prepared to be really impressed no matter what you handed me because I just like you that much, but now I’m a little intimidated. These are great.”
“Depends on how determined I am or how much pride I base it on.”
Steve let out a breath. “I guess I’ll be okay.”
Steve chuckled and took Tony’s hand as he got up. “I’m too small to lead, I don’t mind.” He wrapped his arms around Tony’s neck and laid his head on his shoulder. “I also don’t mind being taken care of every now and again, for all of my stubbornness.”
Tony nodded. “I can worry as often as you want. And we’re gonna have lots of moments, so I guess we can practice that too.” He tossed his phone on the table and kissed Steve again.
Tony picked up his torque wrench, hefted it a few times to try and remember what he’d been doing before she’d interrupted him, and slung it across the floor to skid into the wall. He was in no mood to be told what he had to do as if he hadn’t been working at it as sincerely as his own insecurities would let him at every opportunity. He was definitely in no mood to let his assistant treat him like his whole world getting thrown up in the air was something that was happening to her, and like he ought to curate his confusion to better suit his employee. He was aware as anyone of what a pain in the ass he was, probably moreso, and even he didn’t think he had deserved that level of disrespect.
Natasha was at Steve’s apartment, and they had a week until the Gala. She had decided that Steve needed some lessons on how to deal with reporters and photographers at the Gala. And she wasn’t surprised that the advice wasn’t going over too well with Steve.
Warning: mentions of a hookup with graphic descriptions, transphobia, and homophobia.
“I am taking it seriously, that’s why I’m asking these questions. So again: what do your fears in regard to Steve being disproved tell you?”
Okay, apparently they weren’t going to talk about this, that was fine. Steve shrugged.
“How long have you been seeing this person?” Another asked.
“Who knows if I did at this point.”
Tony put down the remote that betrayed the shake in his hand. “Right this second, yeah, I think I’m ok. In general, no. I feel like… I don’t know. Like I did something wrong. Like it was me that did this.”
Tony sighed. “I know you’re right, I just don’t want it to be over before it’s really had a chance.”
“Damn, I think you came
Steve strode confidently over to Tony and kissed him full on the mouth. He tended to be more dominant when he had the harness and packer on, probably because he became more confident with it, and pushed Tony onto his back then settled between his legs.
“Then… how does he have a reputation of sleeping around?”
Bucky’s shop-voice was a welcome sound. “H’lo? Barnes Bodyworks.”
“C’mere. Let me get you warmed up.”
Steve smiled, glad that Tony didn’t react badly to Wade’s part of the story. In actuality, he’d found out who the guy was and friended him on Facebook. He had more pop culture references on his timeline than Steve had ever seen, and was actually pretty funny. So Steve picked up a menu and looked at the selections.
Tony held the sketches and looked up at Steve with hopeful interest. He scooted over a little on the sofa to conspicuously make room for Steve to sit with him. Steve easily took the spot next to him, and waited in anticipation for a reaction. Tony leaned back and regarded the sketches seriously one at a time. He nodded slowly.
Tony bristled. Natasha rarely got angry, but that didn’t leave him feeling any more inclined to being pushed or bullied in his own sanctum.
Tony leaned into Steve’s side and went on scrolling through his music. “I was just thinking. Wondering really. If you liked to dance.”
“If you’re sure.”
Tony sighed and hung his head. “I get the feeling I’m Toby. Hold that thought. I’ll be right back, and I love a challenge.”
Warning: kidnapping and Wade being an annoying jerk.
“Tony, stop.” Steve scooted closer and took Tony’s hands in his. “I don’t care about what they write about me. Or what they think of you for dating me. They’re just trying to make a quick buck. You’re more important than any of that to me, so… just teach me how to deal with them, and I’m sure I’ll catch on quickly.”
“So…” Tony took a deep breath and mustered up his sincerity in a deep effort to drop his facade far enough that Steve might trust him. “I’m used to not needing to worry about money. And I get that that’s not everyone’s life, and there’s this big social dominance bullshit about money but, seriously, it would cost me far more to start trying to worry about money than it costs me to just pay for things, you know? Anyway, you got us this great table. You know what that’s worth in this town?”
“Ok, I ask because, well, I wanted to know how many partners Tony’s had, and apparently it’s way too many. And, I don’t know, it makes me feel… intimidated? And we both know sex is usually how my exes decided to end it.”
Tony snapped his fingers. “Right! Yeah! Sam, isn’t it?”
Clint poked his phone. “Almost noon.”
Steve laughed. “Thank you for having the reaction I wanted to have. Now I feel like less of an idiot.”
Steve backed up and wiped his eyes on his hand. “How are you on good terms with Professor Xavier anyway?”
She just looked unimpressed. “And who the hell needs a toothbrush robot, or whatever that thing with the toothbrush is?”
“These are for me? You got these all for me?”
Tony nodded. “Honestly I think I got things on this end if you wanna go help run interference for Bruce. I feel so bad that he’s mixed up in this.”
“My vagina is still wet too, Tony. And those khakis are the nice ones you bought me.”
Tony sighed. “Ok so we don’t publish. Maybe I just like having sex in a lab coat.”
“Do you think he’s trying to impress me with his money? I heard he does that.”
Steve nodded, doing his best to understand. “Then let’s just do who you felt romantically attached to. Does that make it easier?”
“I can’t really explain it, but there’s just something… magnetic about him. He has so many talents and passions, and an enthusiasm about them that I haven’t seen in a long time. And the things he creates that aren’t weapons, they could change the world. There are times where I think fate might have made a mistake pairing us up, but then we have moments of just being around each other and I never want them to end. He’s amazing, no matter what the tabloids say.”
“Know what I love most about the serum?” Steve grunted as he pounded Tony relentlessly. “I love not having a refractory period. I love that I’m gonna pump you full of my cum for hours, until you’re raw, until you’re too out of it to even beg me to stop, and then I’m gonna keep fucking you until you learn your fucking place. Then you can sit down here and rot, covered in sweat and cum until I decide to allow you to crawl back upstairs and beg for food and a shower.”
“You’re kind of an asshole,” Steve said with a big, crooked grin, and Tony winked as he got up.
“I never want it to end,” he murmured, captivated, a hand pressed to Steve’s chest, and he could hear Steve’s heart as clearly as he could feel it, echoing through his fingertips. Steve stilled, his eyes closed as though entranced. Tony moved again, unhurriedly. Deliberately.
“Ah, Mon Capitan, it
“C’mon man, let’s get you washed up,” Sam said gently as he pushed open the stall door, and Steve jumped a little, not even having heard him follow him in. Steve got to his feet unsteadily, letting Sam hold him firm with a strong, warm hand on his back. He let warm water run over his hands, watching rivulets tinted with red swirl down the drain. His mind was like static. Too much noise. But not enough to cover the what-ifs that shouted him down.
“Can I get a small cup of black coffee, please?” he said, smiling happily at Tony, and just like that, Tony’s smile lit up the entire planet.
“Well when you say it all like that, I guess I would have followed me, too,” he said, giving her a small smile as his irritation began to dissipate. “Just don’t shoot him, okay? You better talk to him, I guarantee you he feels like the worst person in the world right now and is second guessing everything he’s ever done in his life.” Natasha chuckled, and Tony squeezed her hand. “I’m grateful to have a friend like you Nat. Someone who cares enough about me to follow me and rescue me from my kind, adoring, beloved, and sexually gifted husband. But don’t do it again.”
“So why the secret?” Natasha asked, expression almost offended, and Steve could guess it was because they hid it right under her nose and she never suspected. Steve shrugged a shoulder, his cheeks pink.
“Things…” Steve finally just dropped his red face into his hand with a defeated sigh. “I’m a novelist. I don’t want to talk about it,” he said. Tony held up his hands in a disarming gesture.
Tony drifted in and out of sleep the whole time, never speaking, but squeezing Steve’s hand when he was coherent enough to do so. Steve glanced up now and then, and there was always at least one of their friends watching through the window, concerned, but quick to flash a thumbs up and a smile when Steve caught their eye.
“We really gonna do this? You’ve been teasing me for weeks, don’t go letting me down now, Rogers,” Tony said, and Steve squeezed his hand, laughing softly.
He didn’t know what he’d do if Tony had died. It wouldn’t have been pretty.
“Right. Sooooo I’m gonna guess you’re a writer? Like as your day job?” Tony asked again, leaning forward with interest, his chin in his hand. Steve cringed at the dreaded question.
“Captain, you can come back in,” the nurse said, poking his head into the waiting area. Steve Stood so fast he almost knocked Sam on his ass, and muttered an apology as he rushed back into the ICU, the others trailing behind him to watch from the window. Steve nearly bowled over a nurse and at least two equipment carts to make it to Tony’s side, only to find him unchanged. He bent and kissed his forehead again.
Tony reached across the gearshift and laced his fingers with Steve’s as he sped back towards midtown in his obnoxious and beloved orange Audi, grinning at Steve sideways. If Tony had been standing, he’d be bouncing on his toes in excitement.
“Right. Um. You just, uh… bring it by tomorrow and I’ll get it fixed right up,” Tony said, his tone a little dazed. This time, Steve turned his hand under Tony’s so he could hold hands with him, however hesitantly. Tony stared at their hands, while Steve stared at Tony.
“Please,” Steve whispered again, a sugared plea that almost finished them. But Tony didn’t relent; they had minutes, hours, eons, eternity, to finish. To dance with the end was to be immortal, and in this moment, they were like the stars, without end.
“You-“ Steve started, his complete inability to talk to guys (or girls for that matter) getting the best of him. “Uh, thanks.” He picked up the drink and sipped, and couldn’t stop himself from an inappropriate moan.
“Because I’m not married to you,” he said, and there was an immediate commotion.
“Please?” Tony said so sweetly, and Steve’s resolve immediately crumpled. He ducked his head.
“Luuh,” Tony breathed roughly. Steve’s hand fluttered over Tony’s forehead.
“You’re. Duct tape. You’re using duct tape,” Tony said, picking at the mess of star-printed duct tape on one corner. “And here I was stupid enough to think it was decoration,” he said, grinning up at Steve with both awe and amusement.
“No, this is your computer. I built it. From scratch. For you. Because I wanted to, okay? You don’t owe me anything and since I built it, I couldn’t even tell you the price. C’mon, look! Look at it!” Tony took the laptop and set it on the table, opening it up to show off the features. Steve just stood there in shock.
Sam waited patiently as Steve cleaned the blood off, rinsed his mouth, and washed his face. And when he returned to see that Rhodey had joined them, he was grateful that the others didn’t comment on his red eyes. Instead, his friends lingered comfortingly close to him, all of them fretting in their own ways. Steve sat rigid in the chair with his face in his hands, while they waited for Tony to come out of surgery.
“I’m all green over here, Rogers. Thought you were gonna be rough? I was told you were a super soldier, but so far I still think Pepper could lay me out better than you,” he said with a sneer, letting his tone become acerbic, and at that, Steve wrapped a hand around Tony’s throat, and fucking
“Tony, I don’t- thank you, thank you so much, this is just- I don’t know, one of the kindest things anyone has ever done for me, I mean, I really mean it, you’re saving my-“ Steve mumbled against Tony’s shoulder, only trailing off when Tony’s arms wrapped around him tightly, and he kissed Steve’s temple lightly.
Tony laid back, and it was just them again, riding another high, and Tony smiled, spread his thighs, and reached out, an invitation for Steve. Steve reverently kissed him, and when he slid into Tony slowly, their breaths hitching in harmony, it was quiet and intense and utterly molten. Tony arched quietly into Steve, wrapping his legs around him, and as rough and harsh as they were earlier, that was how tender and indulgent and unhurried they were now. Steve caressed Tony from the inside, whispering endearments into this collarbone, pressing kisses of promises and love and beautiful praise into Tony’s warm skin, until they imprinted on his soul and filled the cracks with molten gold to make him whole.
Tony barked a loud laugh, attracting the attention of several seated customers.
But Steve seemed to sense it, or was already ahead of Tony, because he pulled out, scooping up a few fat drips of cum that slid down Tony’s inner thighs, and wiped it on Tony’s cheek. Tony collapsed, completely limp, and attempted to curl on himself as best he could with his hands tied over his head, every part of him quivering.
“What?” Steve mumbled, tapping the keys, then hitting the power button, then banging the side of the computer, growing ever more frantic.
“Hey, I made some oatmeal,” Steve murmured as he entered the bedroom, and Tony cracked his eyes open to see bright light streaming in the window and Steve’s gentle smile. Tony groaned and shifted more upright in the bed with a wince.
Steve squeezed Tony’s hand in his, stroking his thumb over Tony’s knuckles.
“You know, I was just thinking the other day how unfair it is how nice you are,” he mumbled. “And pretty. It’s unfair.” Tony was quiet, and Steve was sure he’d crossed a line.
The trust that Tony had in Steve to do this, and do it right, safely, respectfully, was immense. It wasn’t even until they’d been together quite a while that Tony felt comfortable enough to be tied up or held down, to give up complete control. He’d never trusted anyone else enough to allow that before. Of course, once that bridge of trust had been built, Tony realized he loved it. He loved letting Steve decide for him, loved letting Steve lavish him with pleasure (and the occasional delight of pain) while Tony was helpless to do anything else but moan and lose himself in the hazy indulgence of being the sole focus of every atom of Steve’s radiant love for him.
Steve was humbled as Natasha and Sam nodded their agreement, and he felt an overwhelming surge of emotion.
“Shoot.”
Tony just gave him that look again. Not piercing, but definitely perceptive.
“He’s in ICU. He had a lot of blood loss though, and the bullets hit some vital organs. He is stable, but still in very critical condition. You can all come with me to the ICU waiting area,” she said, opening another door and gesturing for them to enter. Steve positively sagged, making an almost inaudible noise of relief.
One day when Steve came in the shop, Tony beamed at him like a kid at Christmas, and Steve was unable to hold himself back from giving Tony a warm hug as a greeting, letting Tony’s infectious smile brighten his own face.
“Oh! Yeah, um, I’m sorry, I get- I get dumb around people, and I forget stupid things like-“
Steve patted Tony’s cheek a little too hard, leaving a smear of blood against his unnervingly white skin, but Tony’s eyes blurred and rolled up. Steve’s breath came too fast, his heart racing too loud, adrenaline making him shaky as the panic poured over him like icy water.
“Well, just because it’s your job doesn’t mean you like it. Besides. All you do is frown at your keyboard. You don’t like it.” Tony said. Steve huffed, smirking as he picked at a burr on his jeans.
The finality of Steve’s words and tone had Tony gasping a shaky, uneven breath, tears starting to pool on his lashes.
Steve stared at the screen of his beat-up laptop like it had done him wrong. His brow furrowed and his lips turned down and his long, graceful fingers hovered over the keyboard expectantly, but nothing came to him.
But falling helplessly, hopelessly, head-over-heels in love for Tony was something entirely different.
“Stories.” Tony said, his eyebrows raised expectantly. “Stories about…?”
Steve had growled when Tony gasped slightly too loudly, and Tony had almost fallen to the ground when Steve let him go. When he emerged from the corridor, he looked a little rumpled and flushed and had to tuck his boner in his waistband, but Steve was all laughs at a table, toasting a glass of champagne with a SHIELD agent in a lovely blue dress that fit her like a gossamer second skin. Steve shot Tony a possessive, undressing look at Tony over his champagne glass, and Tony thought maybe Natasha was giving them a look, but she was whispering in Thor’s ear and hiding a smile behind a wine glass when Tony glanced over.
It was hours. Steve didn’t move a muscle the whole time. Dr. Cho finally came out well after the windows had gone black with night. She wore a grim expression, and Steve’s heart skipped a beat as he shot out of his chair, his stiff back popping like firecrackers. The others were close behind.
“Hurry up in there, I have things to do,” Tony said to the nanites, and Steve shushed him, swatting his hand away.
Steve must have been riding the edge the whole time, because his rhythm was already stuttering, and Tony’s defeated sobs mingled with Steve’s moan as he came so hard that Tony could feel the spurts filling him. Steve’s rhythm slowed, but he didn’t pull out. Tony could feel warmth leaking down his inner thighs, but couldn’t even look at Steve with the blindfold on. He tugged at his wrists, trying to get himself into a more stable position, but all it did was strain his shoulders.
