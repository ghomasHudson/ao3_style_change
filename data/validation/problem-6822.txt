He finds Thor still up, in conversation with Vision, who is still wearing his black suit. “Good morning,” Steve says, even though it’s still dark out.
“You want to give up,” Nebula scoffs. “You want to go back to your planet and curl up in a bed and weep – “
So when Sarah arrives, promptly, she can see Tony is agitated. It’s not that his hands are shaking more than usual, but he’s distracted enough that he keeps missing the ball. Mosely, at least, has a good time. Sarah is a good throw, and he loves bounding off into the snow, disappearing, and then shoving his head out, tongue wagging, ear flopping, ball held victoriously in his mouth.
“Yeah, no shit,” Peter scoffs. His nose is bleeding, slightly, his eyes ringed with dark circles. He buffs it away, leaves a red smear on his upper lip. “Strange Dumbledore’d him. I’m not – I’m not stupid,” he says, and his voice has that frail defiance that comes with youth, “I know you all think – oh, he’s a kid, whatever, but I know enough to know – that wasn’t right. It wasn’t right.”
“That’s really good, Tony,” and his voice is so warm, “I am very, very glad to hear that, you understand? It means a lot to me.”
Steve quietly keeps up his long touches to Tony's face. Gently, he leans down, fingers fumbling with the straps of the spreader bar. He lets it fall to the ground, takes Tony's shoulders, carefully pulling him forward. "What do you say we go upstairs and... take some time."
Sarah nods, because she understands. “Okay,” she says “okay. Be ready to leave after the session. Bring Mosely, if you want.”
“Well, I do,” Steve says shortly. He twists, pushes Tony off of his lip. “Hope I helped. Go get some rest.”
Dead. And gone. Snuffed out, lying, broken, at the bottom of a crater in the Amazon, where no one will find his body, murdered by Gus, Gus who Tony had trusted, this is Tony’s fault and Steve is dead, oh God, oh God, Steve is dead, he can’t, he won’t—
Nick stands laboriously, snatches the uneaten bowl from under his nose. “I think it’s time you went to bed, don’t you?”
One of the nurses delivers coffee on a tray. She smiles when she sees Tony. “Good to see you looking so well Mr Stark,” she hums. “I like the beard.”
Tony looks up at him, eyes wide, a loose smile on his face. "I try so hard." He says "I try so hard to be good."
He slips his arm out from under the sheets to wrap around Tony’s shoulders, turns his head to face him, eyes shut, brow slightly furrowed. Tony just observes. That strong nose, those pink lips. Stubble and scars, bruises. But all of him so blisteringly
Steve opens his mouth. Closes it. “I’m sure it’s around here somewhere,” he says. “I’ll figure it out.”
He spins in his chair, sighing. What time is it? Eight? Morning or night? Night. Brilliant. There’s still a few hours left before spending the whole day in the workshop becomes socially inadequate.
He hates him for being so good. Understanding, and pure. He genuinely wants the best for me, Tony thinks. He wants me to be comfortable. He doesn’t want to
Tony sits up abruptly, wiping his tears. “What would you do?” He asks, drying his face on the hem of his shirt. “C’mon, tell me. If you had the gauntlet, what would do?”
She’s sobbing still, but gently. For Steve, tears don’t come. He thinks, maybe she expected this, maybe she’s always expected it. Always prepared.
Tony has to go to Washington to sign off on the documents granting him his assets. He has to press. It’s Natasha who is helpful, who sorts out a tailor, and has new clothes bulk bought and shipped to the house. She arranges the plane tickets, and the interviews, and gives Tony lines to learn.
“I love you,” Tony says again, and his fingers trace Steve’s cheek. Touch him, really touch him. For just a second, Steve is there, in a golden hall, drinking, dancing. His friends cheer, and air is warm, soft against skin. Tony is smiling, his eyes are laughing. “I’ll see you on the other side,” he whispers against Steve’s lips, and pushes him away.
“I can’t believe it’s been three days. I can’t believe you’ve just – not told me. Or anyone. Is he pain? How bad?” Tony feels himself fretting, keeps him clamped down.
“You’re good with them,” a man says, approvingly. “All that choice, hmm? It’s just stopped you from doing what you love.”
He sighs, puts his scotch on the table and rolls onto his knees, kneeling up on the couch. “I’m not,” he says again. “When have I ever – “
the crazy one. All the years Tony’s been on this earth and not a single person ever did the decent thing – the right thing, to demand reparations in his name. Steve would have demanded blood. He would have taken it, if he had been there, and Tony had been his. This isn’t insanity, this is nature, this is the most natural thing. Richards is only getting what he’s owed.
Steve gently wipes the soft cotton against his eyes. “Keep them shut,” he says quietly. “Head back. That’s it.” He pushes the pad against his skin, drags it slowly. And again. Repetitive motion.
“You ready?” Steve asks, and his face is kind. Tony tries to smile, but the back of his neck is sweating, he wants to vomit. He wipes his shaking palms against his pants, tries to breathe slowly, doesn’t want to show anyone how nerve-racking this is for him, and yet –
But then he also asks for Steve sometimes. He asks if he’s coming back. He asks if he can go home, because Mosely is waiting for him. He asks if Mosely can come here. He thinks even Steve could stop HYDRA from hurting him.
“But you do remember,” Steve points out, “because otherwise, you wouldn’t have spent the night looking like you just shit your pants.”
“Well, he’s old fashioned. I’ll take care of it, Tony. I’ll handle it. I’m begging you – don’t worry. When I take charge, things tend to go well, don’t they?”
There are other things I can't say. Things I'm not allowed to say. What I will say is this: there is a world you don't know about, Tony. And it's a world your father will do anything and everything to keep you out of. We are inherently selfish people; if continuing to build missiles is what allows you to have a straight, clean, easy life, then Howard will ensure that this is what you do. I can't believe I've written all of this. I've sat on it for so long, but you should know. And I'll have this delivered as part of my will.
The rain is heavier now. The grass is turning to mud, and the flag on Tony’s coffin is soaked. Steve will need to speak soon. Quick, what does he say. What were his lines again? Heroism, sacrifice, home, this is really simple Steve, it’s three minutes and then you’re done.
“I don’t know, kid. We’ll see. But hey, now that Natasha and St— “ He coughs, clears his throat. “Steve know who you are — you don’t need me. Not really.” He passes the device back to him, awkward. “There you go. Good as new.”
“You’re such a jealous bitch,” Tony sighs, wiping an errant tear from Steve’s cheekbone with his thumb. “You shouldn’t have left,” he says, carefully, stepping his fingers up the side of Steve’s head. “If it mattered so much to you.”
Tony watches Fury purse his lips, stubbornly. He’s not happy. He doesn’t like that Ross has given away that information. “My name, huh,” Tony says, flatly.
Tony’s smile cracks just slightly. “I didn’t want to bother them,” he manages, straightening. “I thought — I just wanted to let you know that, I know I’m not easy, and I’ve been real rough on you lately. Rough on everyone. But I just wanted to let you know that — I appreciate you, and everything you’ve done for me, and — I’m trying to get better. I am trying.”
I would LOVE to hear how you think Natasha is being played out as well as Diana? I just wanted to forget the guys for a while because Natasha Romanoff is literally one of my faves ever.
love them more than that, in an aching, desperate sort of way. “It’s different,” Tony explains, or tries to. “When you’re rich.”
Something clicks in his hindbrain, and he buries his head in Tony’s shoulder. “I wanna go home,” he says, miserably, plaintive. “God, I wanna go home.”
Steve grabs him. Hooks an arm around his waist and pulls him free. He sits up on the ground, slaps his back until he vomits slimy green water and pushes his hair – now sticky with dirt and other things – free from his brow. Tony is shivering so hard, even his parka is cold, and he’s filthy, smelling like pond water. “I’m sorry,” he chatters, teeth grinding. “That was st-stupid. I want – I wanted – “
He shrugs a shoulder, forgets Steve can’t see. “I don’t know,” he mumbles, “I guess it’s like – taboo, maybe. Or, it means I can trust you, I think. If you can be vulnerable, it means, you trust me. It means you’re not always scary.”
“Because it’s – it’s – it is,” Tony insists, although now he’s not sure how, and he can’t work out if maybe he’s angry at himself for crossing a line, or treating Steve like shit, or just being caught out.
Tony feels embarrassed to be allowing it. Pierce won’t know how being touched on his throat makes him, but Tony does; he shouldn’t be using him this way, it’s pathetic.
Steve gently rests his hand on the small of Tony’s back and helps lead him through the sitting room. “Everyone,” he says carefully “Tony’s feeling a bit better so he’s joining us today.”
They’ve moved cots down into what used to be the throne room, so they can be together. Ostensibly so if there’s a threat – there won’t be, half the universe is dead – they have strength of numbers.
“Uh. No. I mean – it’s just an expression, you know? That’s kinda what you’re dealing with, with me, Steve.” He leans forward, kisses his nose. “I’m old blood. Going back far enough, my ancestors would have warmed the beds of kings.”
“Might as well have, for the all damage you did. I’m not saying he didn’t deserve it, just that one day – what if you get it wrong? And what if you act too quickly, your head gets filled with all that… fight? What would happen then, Steve?”
Is it defiance or masochism that makes Tony say nothing? Steve laughs, but it’s mocking. “If you’d ever been disciplined properly, you’d have said no,” he says, drawing Tony’s back to his chest, and steering him from the nape.
“No,” Tony says quietly, letting him cup his cheek, “I like it, though. Sometimes. When you say, bred for this, I like to think – maybe I was. That it’s where I belong, to just be with you. Made for you. There’s a lot of security in that, Steve.”
Steve claps a hand over his mouth. His shoulders are heaving, his eyes are blank. He presses his nose to Tony flesh. Digs his nails into his skin.
But he can barely open his eyes, swollen to slits, and his throat is full of blood, charred. He rasps. His lips mumble, but words don’t come clear.
Tony is silent for a long time. Or not silent, just – quiet, as if building up to what he has to say. Steve expects more. In the end, all he says is this:
He climbs onto the covers, snuggles on-top of the sheets still wrapped in his towel, the way you do as a child after a bubble bath. Steve passes him a bottle, capped, still cold from the mini-bar. He’s pulled on briefs, which is a shame, but Tony can’t have everything he wants.
So Tony is wrapped in the gown Sarah got him for his birthday, and his matching slippers, gratefully accepting the coffee she’s passing around, balking slightly under her warning eye. Natasha is sitting, legs crossed, flicking through one of Sarah’s albums. Peter is fidgeting.
Here’s how it is: Steve and Rhodes take the front. Peter and Thor behind. Fury and Nebula, because it was supposed to be Clint, but he had squeezed her arm and shook his head and said, I would like it to be you, Tony would want you, and, you deserve it.
“Go away? I can’t, Mr Stark. This is limbo now. I’m not even dead. I wish I was dead, though. It’s so cold here. I’m so lonely – “
Steve calmly puts down his ladle, pats his hands down on his apron. “Excuse me,” he says quietly to the woman at the end of the table, and she takes over his spot.
“No,” Tony gasps, and when he looks up, his eyes are full of tears “fuck, no, you’re lying, you’re—”
There are scents he doesn’t recognise. New voices, too. They’re shouting over him, talking over him, things he can’t understand because words don’t sound real. He can hear an awful keening, like a wounded animal. He tries to move, but he’s strapped down, brow and shoulders and chest and arms and legs.
“How’s that possible? You were fucking, you ‘shared a bed’, how could have not been there all the time?”
Steve thinks, they went to college together, didn’t they? Tony and Rhodes. They had known each other longer than anyone here. Pepper’s fingers are tearing at the kid’s armour, her nails digging into his chest, knees tucked beneath her. Jesus, the daughter. She’s going to have to tell Morgan. And what will she say?
Rhodes blinks furiously. He pushes his fingers against Steve’s chest. Looks like he’s about to rip Steve a new one.
Steve had remained calm, because that’s what he does. Tony was ill, and he knew that come morning he would regret everything he’d said. But when he failed to get a reaction out of Steve (that’s what it always came down to, a reaction, attention, something) he turned to Bucky instead.
Tony shivers, pitches forward. He thinks – he doesn’t think. He’s not thinking, at all, exhausted, and shut off. And Pierce is stroking his neck. “I think he’s dangerous, Tony. Do you trust me?”
Tony would be silent, but he’d stroke Steve’s hair anyway. Sometimes, if Steve was really bad, he’d tell him that, if he could, he would reach back in time and give Steve everything he wanted and more, and Steve would sleep with that fantasy in his head, a world where he has Tony and Bucky and Peggy and all his friends.
There’s a seat left empty for Natasha. When Pepper speaks, Morgan sits with Rhodey; she’s fiddling with a rubix cube, legs swinging, too short to reach the ground. “Poor thing,” Sam murmurs, “she doesn’t understand.”
Tony’s eyes droop. He strokes his throat. “Next week,” he says, “I’ll be at yours, as soon as the gala’s finished. I expect the red carpet, Steven.”
per usual, i love comments, whatever u can! a few ppl asked abt the omega story from the snippets and i should have a chapter out soon, but i've rewritten it, like, completely,
He doesn’t sound angry, just genuinely curious. Tony knows Steve has been with other people, a few at least. And Tony…
So I hope, one day, that we may be able to reconcile. Whether that be here, on this earth, or in the eyes of God.
Pierce holds up his hands. “Tony, I – don’t want you coerced into something you wouldn’t do if you didn’t feel responsible. You have no reason to. He knew the risks going in, we all did, it’s not your job to suffer the consequences.”
Steve grunts, doesn’t look at him. “Why’d you need to take off your watch?” He asks. “Was it really important, for what you were doing?”
“Oh, God,” Steve tries to roll out of the bed, “I’m so sorry. I’m so sorry, Tony.” What a fool he is, a selfish fool, bringing that home for Tony to smell. He should have showered. Is he stupid? What did he think, how did he think Tony would react when he brought home to smell of his rapist into his
“Stark, if you don’t want to, that’s fine,” Pierce tells him again. “We’ll find someone else. We have Os on retainer for this exact situation of course, but – he’s so strong. And they won’t have suits.” Pierce sighs. “But I suppose, needs must. We’ll try our best, make sure they don’t come in harms way. We’ll try.”
Tony hadn’t — expected it. The nurse told him he had a guest, and so he had shuffled down to the lounge. And he’d searched the room for someone he recognised, and hadn’t even noticed her, because it had been so long since he’d seen her face and she’d dyed her hair. He turned to go, assuming it was a mistake, and that’s when she gently put her hand on his arm and asked “Tony?”
Steve curls his hand. Catches Tony’s wrist. “Do you want me to finish the job?” He asks, voice low. Earnest.
Tony brings it closer to his nostrils and inhales. “Huh,” he says, blood thumping in his ears. “That’s – what, some kind of perfume…”
Steve’s hands on his shoulders. Tony’s back against the lockers; he grunts. “Ouch,” he says, pointedly.
Pierce makes his apologies, tells him he’ll find him before he leaves. Tells him, he doesn’t recommend the food, and it’s an open bar. Tony helps himself, tips generously, and lets people crawl over him for the next four and a half hours.
With steady fingers, he unbuttons Steve’s pants, pulls down the zip. He hooks two thumbs beneath the waistband of Steve’s briefs and carefully drags them over his cock, tucking them beneath his balls. “Captain,” he says quietly, and then he leans forward and presses kisses, lips barely ghosting skin, against the line of Steve’s cock.
“You know what it is, Steve?” He murmurs, letting his head rest fully against his chest, “I am… instrumental.”
“No, I have,” he swears softly. “Not just – the things I didn’t see. I don’t know. You shouldn’t have been tortured, Tony, not for me.”
and so Steve took and took. He doesn’t think Tony’s spoken so truthfully about it to anyone. He considers it an honour.
After Insight, after HYDRA, after the fall of the helicarriers and crumbling of the Triskelion, it had been the good days.
Tony thinks, dreamily. Steve doesn’t stop his stroking. Tony wonders if he could come like this, just on the words and simple touch.
Steve doesn’t want to think about what he said. It can’t be repeated. He respects Bucky’s ability to just take it up to a point, but doesn’t really blame him when turns around and throws it right back in Tony’s face.
That’s strange, but Tony doesn’t question it. “Sure,” he says, “but it’s not as good as when you do it.”
He just fucks him and fucks him until Tony’s eyes are rolling back in his head. He stops caring about the grip of the metal pressing into his stomach, or that he’s bent over naked in a stairwell with a very-clothed Steve fucking him like it’s all he’s there for. Steve’s hand shifts, moves from his mouth to his throat and tightens just slightly. Without the gag, Tony is free to listen to his own moaning, huffing, and occasional pleads for more, harder, c’mon Captain, more now, please, don’t leave me hanging –
“Children, mostly. Mostly children. You’d smuggle them out before the vampires or the Nazis could get to them.”
A silence. Natasha starts. “Honestly? I’m selfish, Tony. I’d go back to the start. All the way to start. I’d – make sure the Soviet Union never existed.”
Steve is chewing his bottom lip, which would be sweet under other circumstances. “There were things in there,” he says, “about after you first – “
And Steve is forced to admit, no, he hadn’t. He had known Tony was mentally ill. He hadn’t known he was insane.
They’re pasting over it. Three men, levered up the side of the building, replacing it with white. They cover up the left side of Tony’s face, and then the centre, and by the time they block out his eyes entirely Steve’s traffic is starting to move.
It hurts to have his hair pulled, Steve steering him like he can’t waste the words on instructions, tugging him back off the railing, pulling him down to his knees. “Is the floor cold, sweetheart?” He mocks, kicking apart Tony’s bent knees with his boot.
“You want to do more than kiss me,” Pierce tells him, voice kind, and warm. “You want to feel safe. You know that only I can make you safe. Only I can protect you.”
“You’re not the first monster I’ve met, Diana,” Tony says, laying himself on the table. “You’re not shocking me, here.”
Steve grasps him, squeezes. He sighs slightly, leaning back into the chair. “I think – to at least start repaying me,” he clarifies, “you should open those pretty lips.”
The whole thing feels very sad. It’s more than Rogers being too pure for his own good – he’s not just helping them out of the goodness of his heart, although that probably plays a role. He’s there because he’s lonely, or desperate, or both. Because he’s not adjusting, or whatever.
“Sure,” Tony says, resting his hand on his chin, wincing slightly when he fucks more into his wall than his channel. He thinks this was probably a mistake. He thinks, his therapist is going to kill him.
Tony’s passed out on his side of the bed and he’s stolen most of the sheets. “That’s thieving, you know,” Steve says, lowly.
Tony shuts his eyes. There’s blood in his mouth, and the muzzle means he can’t spit it out. The soldier is standing behind him, right behind him, close enough that Tony can feel the brush of his Kevlar against his hair. He thinks about the soldier’s hands, and the taste of his lips.
And then she pales. Tony pales, too, because that’s worrying. But then she presses a hand to her chest, laughs. “Oh my God,” she says “you’re the Colonel. I thought you were — is that so? No no, I’m his — friend. Yes, we live together. Ha, no, just friends thank you. No no, you boys talk away. Oh, thank God, it’s really you. Green Roots? Sure, that’s only ten minutes away, Tony was — there. No, here, he’s still here.” She hands back the phone, mouths ‘sorry’, and makes a face. Tony grins.
“Yeah. Anything below… probably flats. It’s already got built in office space, and it’s the first building to run off arc powered — “ Steve halts. Will any other building ever run off arc reactor technology? Or has humanity’s advancement come to a halt, a sudden plateau, just like that, hit a wall, because now Tony is dead.
Tony blinks; has it really been two years since they went to war? Peter is taller, he thinks. He’s filled out, his voice is deeper. Tony blinks again, and sees that there’s stubble on his jaw. Huh? What? Even Natasha looks like she’s aged. When did that happen? How?
For awhile, there's just the clink of cutlery and the rasp of knife over toast. Tony bites into the bread with a crunch, the flavour bursting over his tongue. "So," he says, wiping his fingers "last night."
“We still can,” Steve says urgently, moving to stop Tony from picking up the shards with his bare hands. “Didn’t you hear me? Listen, Tony, listen, I love you. I never stopped, please understand I never stopped. And — and what happened with Barnes had to happen. Would you have done the same for Rhodey? Answer me honestly, if you had a choice, and I wasn’t listening, would you have saved Rhodey? No matter how much you loved me?”
“No! I – Jesus, Stark,” Steve looks bewildered, “I’m not saying he’s a bad man, but even good men – make mistakes. Misread things, do things they shouldn’t. Even if you asked… he should have known better.”
but the words don’t come out, for some reason. He wants to cover his nose – the scent of Ty’s breath is making him want to hurl.
Rhodey flew out to help get him home, although ‘home’ is a loose word – stateside is better. He’d spent a few more weeks in a rehab clinic in Houston where they taught him how to chew and swallow without drooling and aggravating the burns.
“More than my time,” Steve says, easily, but he’s not joking. His hand tightens on Tony’s waist. “You okay, honey?”
He thinks, back to the in-between times. An ‘off’ in the on-and-off that was Pepper and Tony’s relationship. He looks at the sinew of Tony’s neck, and remembers resting his head there once, listening to his pulse.
Tony blinks sluggishly. “I don’t know why you’re doing this to me,” he mutters, feverishly, “I’m just an omega.”
“Oh, I don’t know about that,” Tony smiles, softly. “I was sure bred to be something. Do I remind you of home, Steve? Is that what it is?” He sees the tight, awkward look on his face. “No no,” he soothes, “don’t worry, it’s fine. It’s fine if I do, it’s normal. You remind me of – we all have types.”
Tony is crying again, but he doesn’t know why. He doesn’t even realise it until the pillow beneath him is wet. It’s just – it’s really important to him, that he gets all their names out there. “I’m always pretty,” he says, “I never wanted any of them, though. I wanted to build cars. And I begged Dad not to send me away. He was sixty-four, and I didn’t want it. I wished I was ugly, because he never would have seen me at that party and asked Dad to have me. But then I got sloppy. I relied on it. And now what? Now I have nothing. I’m nothing now.”
(He leaves his records. All of them, packed away in a box. Steve takes them out some nights, leafs through them, fingers their delicate casing. Bits of Tony he can’t throw away.)
Cut the crap, the first voice says. She never loved you, Tony. Money money money, look what you did for her! Secretary to CEO, you practically bought her everything she owns! There’s only one thing Pepper ever wanted, Tony, and it wasn’t you with your ugly face. She found you just as irritating as the rest of them did –
Tony blinks, tries to steel himself. Steve, he wants to say, but the sharp noise has turned into ringing in his ears. Steve is doubling in and out of his vision, and he groans again, feeling his eyes roll back into his head. He hears them fiddling with the catches of his armour, dragging it off his body, but he can't really do anything about it. He's aware, distantly, that he's wearing the undersuit and being cradled in Steve arms, head pillowed by his thighs.
You agree, don’t you, Steve? You have my back on this? Because I think we need to start now. Build this team, ground up, I know what you’re thinking, ‘who’s this crazy guy, why’s he asking me to live with him, I’ve known him five minutes,” Tony laughs uneasily, “but this isn’t going to stop. They know us, now. We have a big fat target on the back of our – “
So Tony sighs, can’t help it, really. Could you blame him? He can feel himself, hard and wet. “Asshole,” he breathes.
Nick pushes back a seat with his foot, jerks his chin in its direction. “Go on,” he says. “You probably have questions.”
She unclips her earring, rests it on the counter. She’s still wearing her evening gown, but has swapped the heels for soft moleskin slippers.
he murmurs, head held in hands, curled on what was once Drax's bunk. “Strange. Pepper, Rhodey, Bruce, Happy. Natasha. Thor. Clint.” A beat, a hanging silence. “Steve.”
Okay, so, first of all a massive thank you if you're still reading this! Also, thanks to EVERYONE who has commented, kudosed, etc, you are the reason I'm still writing it!
Steve is worrying his lip. It’s kinda cute. “I guess I’m asking if – someone organised that so you could convince him to sell.”
He strokes the soft skin behind his good ear, wraps his arms around his shoulders so he’s held safe and tight, tucked properly into the warmth of his body. “It’s okay,” he tells him, like that means something. “You’re alright, sweetheart.” His lips brush Tony’s brow.
He knows he finds Steve, because he remembers blood, and panic, and thinking he was hurt, smelling it all over him. He remembers, maybe,
Tony considers. “I don’t know,” he says. “I think… if I hadn’t spent time in the hospital like I did, I think I would have forgiven you.”
Tony accepts this without protest. He withdraws his hand. Steve helps him to bed; takes off his shoes, socks. He tries to take the coat and sweater but Tony complains that he’s cold, too cold, and he wants to wear them. Steve tells him he knows the sheets will warm him up fast, and they can always turn up the heating. Tony asks him what the problem is, he just wants to wear the parka, what’s the problem? He’s not hurting himself, Steve doesn’t have to dictate his every action, and Steve relents quickly, eases off fast, and leaves a glass of water next to Tony’s bed that he knows he won’t be able to drink without spilling it first.
shivering from cold, he tells himself a whiskey will warm him up. He’s still wearing the clothes he left in last night. He wants to shower, wash off all the filth, but he doesn’t want to see himself. He knows there’ll be marks, and fluids, and other things he doesn’t want to think about.
Tony realises he's leaned forward. His head is now resting on Natasha's shoulder. It feels heavy, like he can't support it on his shoulders, so Natasha has to push him back up to sitting. She sighs. "I hope you're okay." She says.
Tony exhales. He stubs the cigarette on the concrete, out of habit, and flicks it down into the water.
“No. It was built for his structure. Look, I really can’t be giving away this kind of information over an insecure line – please. Don’t wait around, just take a suit. Helicarrier, I’m having coordinates patched over now.”
Tony kisses him. It’s harsh, and his fingers are digging into Steve’s chest, possessive, painful. It’s over in less than a handful of seconds, and then he’s pushing Steve away, collapsing so fast Steve has to hold him up. “It’s not the same,” he breathes, and then his face starts to screw up. “Oh God, it’s not the same, it’s not — “
He has to obey, right now. He turns his head, opens his eyes, looks at a point past Steve’s head. “It’s awful,” he agrees, dully. “I’m awful.”
Steve’s throat feels thick. “Well, it was my pleasure, darlin’. Don’t need to thank me for it, just doing my duty.”
Steve manages to push Tony's head between his knees just as he vomits. Nothing really comes up; it's just his stomach reacting to the vertigo as he gags onto the floor. The sudden movement probably doesn't help, though. When Steve tips Tony back, his eyes roll into his head and he groans.
Gus blinks. “That’s not my name,” he gasps “fuck, stop touching it.” He says, batting away Steve’s hand.
“I know,” he says smoothly. “It’s why I tried to kill myself. Wouldn’t you? I was in love with him. He ran off with someone I could never compete with. I had nothing.”
“It’s alright, Mr Stark,” someone says. “No need to panic. You were trying to hurt yourself, that’s all. Would you like something to drink?”
Do you have any fond memories of me? I wouldn't think so. We never did spend much time together. I covered the basics, mainly. And when Jarvis left SI and came to work at home permanently he took over. For which I am eternally grateful. That man loved you, Tony, even then. You were his little man. I am so glad you had him and conversely, he had you.
After, when Natasha has stolen a box of pizza and is eating regally on her throne of pillows, resting her feet in Clint’s lap, Steve rests his head on Tony’s shoulder. Bruce sighs, long-suffering, and turns on the TV.
“Steve says, you’re taking a car,” Tony says, making sure Ty knows that Steve knows he’s there. “Sorry. I know it’s not the style you like.”
“But the same man? And first, he does it to me, to – what, put me off you, maybe. And then, a year later, he shows you that, because?”
“To your long life,” Tony agrees, and decides he probably likes Pierce. He pushes, but know when to back off, and his scent is familiar, calm. He has no reason not to trust him, which as good a reason as any.
There aren’t any. There are lots of his eyes, and hands. A few of his – legs? His head, pillowed on his arms, eyes crinkled, and the slope of his back when he’s lying in bed.
“You want me to knot your ass? Come inside you like that?” Steve’s voice is hard, panting. Briefly, bizarrely, Tony thinks – that must be psychosomatic, right? There’s no way he’s out of breath.
Tony drops to his knees. He’s not even drunk – there’s no excuse to be doing, save for pure attraction.
The look on his face shows that Tony doesn’t agree. “Yeah,” he says dully. “Maybe. Or maybe they all just – ceased to be. Who knows, maybe they’re the lucky ones, they get to bail and now we have to – “
He pulls Tony’s shirt off his head; he gets thrown around a bit in the tussle, letting Steve slam him back against the glass. He seems to take him, all of him: Tony knows he’s a catch. It’s gratifying to see Steve lick his lower lip, eyes hungry.
“I have — I have flowers in the car.” Peter blurts. “Aunt May said I should bring you flowers or something, you know, like get well soon — “
Tony momentarily recoils. And then he barks a laugh. “Weird?” He snorts, loosening his grip in his moment of humour, letting Steve pull the bottle away without much fight. “You think high-functioning alcoholism is weird?”
“Yes,” he near hisses in response “yes, Tony, don’t you understand? I have Bucky, and Bucky is safe, and that’s all I wanted. That’s all I wanted for him. But I never stopped loving you, and I never stopped – hoping. I never…” Steve trails off. He pauses, collects himself; clears his throat.
Tony thinks, or tries to, while Pierce fetches a medical kit. Heightens what’s already there. Steve hadn’t meant to hurt him; he’d been afraid, unaware. He’d thought he was protecting him from a threat that only he could see. He’d saved omegas from alphas trying to take them against their will.
Tony nods, processing this. “Okay,” he says. “Well, that makes sense I guess. That’s better, than knowing — I don’t know,” Tony laughs slightly “that she had just — left, or something. That would suck. So I guess — Christmas here then?”
The curling, wiry hairs of his groin are tickling Tony’s nose as he pushes in so deeply Tony feels the bulge in his throat; he can’t breathe. He can, but – he can’t. He wants to beg so fucking bad.
“Fury would thank me,” Steve says dismissively, eyes zeroing in on Tony’s groin. “You need to be taken down a few notches.”
if that doesn’t hit every single masochistic button Tony has. He takes away his fingers and rests them on the ground, leaning his weight on his hands and sucking the tip of Steve cock. He takes him down in one, feels him at the back of his throat, almost – almost – enough to trigger his gag reflex.
But he’s not afraid. There’s no risk. The only risk is the one he gives himself; it’s as if he knows, if he walks up those stairs, and leaves this building –
“The thing is, Steve, it’s mostly all made-up,” Tony tells him, brutally. “Seriously. Sure, there’s plenty of Darwinist explanations for why everything is the way it is, but maybe it just
He deposits a plastic baggy with a small metal tube on top of the desk. Tony frowns. “Can I touch it?”
Still. He figures he owes Pierce a favour, what with his poor show after the helicarrier debacle. He’s wearing a new pair of panties beneath his neatly-pressed pants, a rose-pink he thinks Steve will appreciate when he takes them off tonight. Preferably, with his teeth.
Not the whole truth. Tony had told him plenty. Even when Steve felt he couldn’t bear to hear it anymore, Tony kept telling him, because it was his way of baring it all.
Tony draws it with steaming water and bubbles and some kind of lavender essential oil he finds under the sink. The tub is so wide and deep it can easily accommodate the two of them. He watches Steve strip off in the mirror; the slope of his back, the curve of his waist, the broadness of his shoulders.
He finds his way back to the bed, pushes himself up, wincing. He sees that his belly is a mass of dark blues, purples and blacks, heavily bruised. The pain is ridiculous. He wraps himself in a fur, covers himself as best he can from Diana’s wandering eyes.
And Tony doesn’t care. Steve pulls away, lightly thumbs his lower lip. “I’ve got to do the rounds,” he says, “I want you naked and in bed by the time I get there.”
"I'm sorry." He says again "Steve? Did you hear? Please, it was a stupid -- stupid idea. I didn't mean -- didn't want -- " Steve realises that every second he's sat thinking, Tony's pleas have grown more fervent. "I can still be good." He says "I can make it, just make it better." He's squirming slightly, pushing forward, trying to seek Steve out.
And what. Have some low-level beta tech come running, seeing his moon ass bent over a railing, red with Steve’s print? Put in his place, is what they would say, probably.
Steve reads the news over his shoulder. “Huh,” he says, shaking his head. “I guess he’s going to be keeping his hands to himself from now on.”
You had a sister. When your sister was born, Tony, I was happy. I was so happy to have a child. And I think, when she died, all the love I could give a child went with her. Your father took a turn for the worse, after that. He drank more. You were a miracle that was not supposed to happen.
He shivers, lets Steve kiss his skin. He sucks at the sensitive area behind his ear, ignoring his nape but caressing his throat with his hand. “You have such a beautiful neck,” he breathes, letting his teeth ghost over Tony’s earlobe.
Steve seems to realise he’s chosen his path and now he’ll need to follow it through. “I just mean, that a lot of the things you talk about are objectively wrong, yet when you talk about them, you make them sound subjectively right.”
It does, eventually. Tony had almost fallen asleep there, in the steam, and the warmth of the steam. “Tony,” Steve is saying, distantly, softly. “Wake up, sweetheart.”
“In – in-between,” Steve stumbles, slightly. “We would – you were on and off, in-between. But never – Jesus, Pepper, never when – “
It takes an hour. The food is cold. Tony feels so full he can barely stand. “There’s a fire in the living room,” she says “you can sit there if you like.”
Okay, so I'm not entirely sure how long this is going to be. I've been writing it as I go along so I've never really had a definitive plan. I have a rough sketch of how the rescue mission is going to but I just don't know how many chapters it will take.
Steve’s eyes glaze, distant. “You talk in your sleep, you know. I heard you last week. You were moaning like a two-bit whore, but I don’t joke about it.”
“To someone. Like, with Pepper. I loved her, but… I didn’t think we could last. And I was too scared to commit. So we broke apart. Like that. And when you’re talking to that person, all you can think is, I love you, I really fucking love you, but I couldn’t bear to lose you. And probability tells me we’re going to break up eventually so… better just rip off the bandaid.”
“Pierce wasn’t keen either, he’s just a pragmatist.” Tony thinks about waking up on his leather couch the next day with only foggy memory of what came before. “We spoke, after.”
“But you’re there,” Steve chokes. “You’re there and I’m here and — and I don’t know how long I have left. I want to be happy, and I want to be with you. I want to — “
“No. I get people begging my ear all the time, although they’re usually less – “ Tony looks him, up and down, “
Tony spits in the doctor’s face. He throws the pens across the room. He kicks the table. The doctor takes notes.
Steve’s pupils are blown. He tips his head to the side, uncomprehending. Tony realises, this isn’t Steve. The anger has swallowed him up, burrowed into his head, and now – now –
The man leans over him to grab something, salt or sauce or whatever, and Tony reels back, blinking rapidly. Sam Wilson raises an eyebrow, but he smiles gently, in a friendly way, rests a hand on his shoulder and asks ‘are you alright?’
Steve is pulling off his fishnet sweater, unbuttoning the leather pants. “C’mon,” he urges gently, “let’s get some proper clothes.”
Pierce gives a great sigh. He pinches the bridge of his nose. “Well alright then,” he says, resigned. “This is a pity. We could have done great things together.”
After, when Loki is locked somewhere in the bowels of the ship, and Tony is definitely alive, and the portal that was in the sky is gone, shut, finished, they’re standing on the brig, looking out at the clouds.
Now, though, Tony’s fingers grip his shirt, tighten so hard the buttons pop, and he can feel his hands shaking through the flimsy material. “You see?” He’s hissing “You see? I knew I wasn’t ready, I knew it. Look at what they do to me, Steve, look at what the meds are doing. Can’t you see? Can’t you see what happens to me when I take them?” He holds up the back of his hand, spotted with four red scars, perfectly circular and evenly spaced. “That isn’t normal,” he spits “this isn’t normal.”
“We understood each other,” Pepper says. “How else do you spend twenty years with a man, if you don’t understand them?”
He drinks from the bathroom tap like a dog and splashes cool water on his face. Dries it with a towel. It’s still too warm.
“And why can’t you live your life? Because you’re going to see me again one day, no doubt about that. When you know the time is right, the time will be right. One day, Steve, you’ll — need to give up. And you will. Your body will make that decision for you. It made it for me.”
He grips Tony’s wrist, hard, unyielding, tsks. “You’ll have to try better than that, Stark,” he grits out, squeezing and squeezing.
“I love money,” Ty reasons. “I love sex. You had both, in spades. I would have been a good husband, Tony.”
“I don’t mean anything by it,” Pierce says gently. “Just that – there are hidden depths. Those drugs, the one that Rogers was dosed with? It only heightens what’s already there, Tony. Just… think about that.”
He can feel Natasha’s smirk even before she brushes her hip up against his, shimmying him out of the way of the cookie jar. “He’s passed out, you know.”
I saw cruelness in the way you screamed at me, Tony. Do you understand your father’s rage? When you screamed, I saw it in you. You would of hurt me if you could. Could you understand that your father, so long beaten down by others around him, jaded, with a dream that was snatched from under his feet, could you understand why he would feel the way you did when we took Jarvis from you? How it could lead him to be so cruel?
For the video game he bought her and wraps her arms around his neck. She’s tugged away by her mother. Tony thinks, she looks unhappy. Pierce’s daughter, he means. She looks sad.
“It didn’t work. I ran out. Then he stabbed me. Thought I was gone, for sure, he – said he knew me. ‘Stark’, he said. That he knew me, you know? And then he put his hand on my head – “
He trusts him. He must. Pierce gently presses him back against the couch, head lolling down; he pinches his cheeks between his thumb and fingers. “Do you trust me?” He asks again. “It’s important to me that you answer, Tony.”
But sometimes Tony’s mind will slip, and the doctor’s will convince him that they’re not evil, that actually he’s in a hospital and he’s sick. Tony will cry then. “Sick?” He’ll ask “I’m not — I’m not sick, I’m not — “
“You’re so eager to please, do you know that? I don’t think you do, really. You’re not aware of the extent that you do it. Sure, this helped,” and Pierce sprays his nose, so he wrinkles it and groans, “but it only heightens what’s already there. The rest was all you. Really, I should be thanking Howard. He really bred you right.”
Hand in his hair, bending him, face on the ground. Steve at his back, hot, heavy; Tony can smell him now, thick, all alpha and raw lust. He can hear the slick sound of Steve taking himself in hand, groaning at the feel, while Tony squirms on the floor, nails clawing.

Tony sounds tired, now. He shuts his eyes. “But, uh,” he frowns, smacking his lips. “I suppose, seeing as this is it, and – and I’m getting sleepy, I think I should say… we had some good times, huh? That little motel, outside Albany. You had to a shirt from the 7/11, remember that? The one with the bird on it.” Tony snorts, smiles. “You looked so fucking stupid.”
Steve straightens. “You always tell yourself you’re in control. But Killian came here tonight, for you, to further his own agenda. And for some reason – and I don’t know why, because I know you’re not stupid, but I do know you’re vulnerable – you’re going to play right into his hands. Well, good luck to you, Stark. Don’t come crawling back to me after it’s all said and done, I’m finished.”
There’s a rolling cheer, a ripple of laughter and delighted screams. Tony frowns, buries his head in Steve’s neck; the light is too bright. Someone is pulling off his shoe – who is pulling off his shoe, if he’s in Steve’s arms? He cracks open his eyes, he can’t make out their faces. Blurred. Blur of pink skin and light hair. All of their hands.
"Yeah." Tony exhales. "It's fine. Just -- " he shrugs off the robe "hold me, tonight. I'll be okay."
But Gus shakes his head. “My name is Gustav,” he says “not Gus, I was, back then I was pretentious, and I thought, I thought ‘Gustas sounded cool.”
After, there is a gathering. The tower hasn’t been occupied by them in so long. Once, they all stayed here, lived here. Before Wanda, before Bucky, in a temporal vacuum, the good days. The days when he and Tony would share the same bed, rise together in the mornings, join back at night. The days where they were all united in the joint concern of erasing HYDRA from the world, the days where Tony and he would go on trips to Europe dressed in civilian clothes, on the pretence of a mission to find Bucky, to gather intel, but really they would walk along rivers and eat at country kitchens and smoke on balconies while people younger than them walked on the streets below, alive and happy.
Steve grunts, accepting. Tony chose his words carefully, appealed to Steve’s hind-brain: thank you, alpha, for protecting the pack. You did the right thing, alpha. Listen to me talk so softly and gently and sweetly to you, alpha, so you know that I respect your choice.
So he lets it ring out, once, twice, three times. He figures none of those people would ever be so persistent, and reluctantly, he answers. “Hello?” The voice says, down the line.
Steve turns to Tony. “You sure?” He asks, almost cautiously hopeful. “We can’t bring him back if we don’t like him.” And by that, he clearly means, if you don’t take care of him and leave him to starve while you lie in bed.
Now, he’s lost a lot of weight. Steve can see his collarbones jutting out from his chest, the ridges of his spine. His hair is longer, softer, lightly curled around his sallow cheeks without any product to smooth it away. Steve never realised that Tony was naturally quite this pale, pasty; did he always have a tan? Was he always in the sun? Now, Tony appears translucent, you can see the green-blue of his veins. It makes Steve anxious for a second, like this new lines are just maps for Tony to follow the next time he is trusted with a razor.
Tony smiles, traces his finger up and down Steve’s forearm. “Hah. Because I realised, actually, you don’t remind me of anyone. You’re not really the type of guy I go for.”
“I don’t think it’s changed that much since my time. I don’t know many other omegas that have a job like you, but I bet if they do, they have someone looking out for them.”
Tony, for his part, keeps up the charade. He’ll make sure his breathing stays slow and measured, and that he keeps his limbs loose. Steve seems to believe it, or at the very least, pretends he does.
Overcome? The first voice spits Look at her! She’s wearing this month’s fashions, she’s had hair dyed, she’s at college! She hasn’t overcome anything, she’s played the game, she’s played everyone, picked from obscurity because she’s a fucking nazi! Don’t you dare feel sorry for her, she despises you!
There are a few other people milling around, laying flowers, saying prayers. Tony pulls his beanie hat down firm over his head, keeps his eyes trained on the ground. He moves quickly, keeping his pace firm. Last year, when he came here, he’d had a driver with him. And there had been press following him, wanting to get his reaction. And they had played the clip over and over on the news that night, talking about how Barnes had killed his parents and what this meant for the Avenger’s amnesty.
Strangely, he doesn’t think about the contracts, or the things he told him. He doesn’t think about the things he did to him, either, because that’s no use now. But he wonders what makes a man that way. To put your child in those situations, for your own gain, or worse. Tony couldn’t do that. He’d rather never have children, ever, than have to put one of them in harm’s way.
Someone holds a glass of water in his line of vision. Natasha. “Here,” she says, “you should drink.”
‘I was’ what? Assaulted? No. Tortured? No. Shown a photo? It doesn’t quite seem to explain the severity of his response.
“He was there,” Steve finds himself speaking up. “I saw him. It’s dangerous for him to even show his face.”
“Rabid. Hard, maybe. I never used to look for the worst in people, always, but this new world is difficult. People don’t say what they mean, and when they do, it’s rarely kind. I want – all I need is home, you know? If I just had somewhere…”
It’s not your fault. It is nothing you have done. I am just a sick woman. Genuinely sick and it hurts to write and I’m sorry.
“Dance for us, Tony,” they laugh, and stand him up, all their fingers stroking as they leave him. He puts out his hands to balance himself, stumbles; his legs aren’t steady, his vertigo is so bad he doesn’t know what is up and what is down. He doesn’t know why he’s standing. He remembers: fear, and braces his arms to fire his repulsors, but there’s no burn, no acrid stench, and he turns to look at his palms. They’re bare. He’s bare. He realises, he’s almost naked.
Tony doesn’t, really. He thinks Steve might have tried to take him to see Rhodey, and Tony might have — sounded off, a little, in the back of the car. “But I was in New York today. I was actually in the city.”
“Cold is fine,” Tony dismisses, because there’s now a pit in his stomach, “cold is good. Pizza is perfect.”
The kid is crying, but he’s got a hand gripped around Pepper’s wrist, and she’s screaming. It’s wordless, agony, sound. To lose a husband.
The hands slide along the outside of his thigh. They snap the lace of the garter against his skin. They hike his panties up his hips. “You do who this wear for?” Someone asks him. “Wear did us for this?”
“I graduated early, and I didn’t really have friends. Steve, you’re overthinking it,” Tony soothes. “Maybe this is what we’re talking about, right? You’re getting your head into the wrong place again. Relax. I’m here for you, not the other way around.”
Bruce and Natasha are talking. Imagine, they still have each other. What luck, what joy. Who does Tony have? What’s left?
And Steve would bury his brow into Tony’s forearm, his shoulder. “Jesus I miss him,” he would breathe “you have no idea, you have no fucking idea Tony, what I would do. You don’t know, you don’t know what I’d do to have all that back.”
“I’m sorry,” Wanda says quietly. “I should have known, I – I’ll eat later. I’m sorry.” She gets up to move, to run, and Natasha takes her arm and pulls her back, forces her into the chair opposite Tony.
Tony grasps her arm. “No,” he blurts. “No. It’s so good to see you. It’s so — I don’t have anyone, not from the old days. Everyone’s gone. You’re gone, Rhodey’s gone — sometimes, you know, people like Wilson and Romanoff visit, but it’s not — it’s not — “
Which he is, obviously. Completely and utterly. Never quite something he learnt how to do. Still needs Jarvis to prompt him when he’s being strange. Or rude. Mostly rude. Turns out, for most people, strange and rude are actually synonymous.
“Well we have to stand up to the truth eventually,” the nurse sighs dramatically. “Jim, can I get you another pillow?”
Whatever is left of them, no doubt. Steve doesn’t hold out hope. It could be all of Rocket’s team, it could be none of them. It could be one of theirs.
Tony frowns; his phone is buzzing on the bedside table. “You – you keep at it, sport,” he says, reaching for it. Unknown number. Calling at 2AM on a Sunday. Tony doesn’t just
Steve keeps tugging him back and Tony pulls against him, feet slipping in the mud beneath the water. “Let me go,” he manages “let me go, I need to be there.”
That’s just the concussion talking, the second voice sighs. And that might be true. Tony’s head is still ringing from where he tried to end it against the wall of his nice bedroom two nights ago. It could also be the drugs they’ve plied him with. But that’s not the point: he has a theory.
Hand on his shoulder. Tony seizes. Thor is standing, hands by his head, non-threatening. “Apologies,” he says. “I thought we should talk.”
“I mean,” he coughs, delirious with blood loss and heat, he grabs at his side “M’ not, anymore.” He shakes his head “I’m not German.” He says forcefully “I didn't live there. I never thought Hitler was worth it.”
he thinks, furiously. He tries to push back against the weight of him, but Steve won’t have it; “Bad boy,” he chides, laughing at him, and then reaching his hands forward to hook his fingers in Tony’s cheeks.
“If you can’t sleep, you should come and sit,” Natasha calls, patting her sleeping bag. “We’re talking.”
“I want to,” Tony says, leaning back into his arms. He twists his neck, kisses Steve’s chin. “I’m sorry I was angry earlier. I don’t like people looking at my history.”
“Tony,” he agrees. “Tony. Here,” he inches closer, “you want to scent me, sweetheart? You can, if you want, I don’t mind.”
“I couldn’t stay,” Steve croaks, pulling back. “I just wanted… I found this.” He holds out the box, with the helmet and the photos and the letters. “You should have it, she should…”
A long pause. “I would not lie to you,” Thor says gravely. “There would be ways. Death could be consulted — oh, don’t look at me like that, it is complicated, didn’t I tell you? A bargain could be struck, I could rewrite Stark’s fate. But I cannot promise the man I brought back… I cannot promise he would be the same.”
Sarah then looks overwhelmingly sad, pitying, and scared all at once. “Let me check the phone, Tony.”
Steve might be angry, Tony thinks, lethargic. He might be disgusted. But at least Tony would hear his voice.
“You made him happy,” she soothes. “And any time where he’s happy – give him a future he deserves. It’s too late for us here, but maybe…” her eyes drift to where Morgan is playing, oblivious, with the holograms on her father’s work-station.
But she doesn’t. And the days start to get colder and colder. Tony’s morning walks now take place in the dark, but he doesn’t mind. It’s always so silent. His breath will fog the air. The orange lights which illuminate the grounds send spiralling shadows, and he’s warm in his coat.
“I imagine it’s been designed to – get people like you to let your guard down,” Fury says, pointedly.
“I think we should end this,” Steve tells him. “It’s not easy. It’s not fair of me to expect things of you that you don’t want or can’t do, and – I don’t want us to resent each other, Tony.” His voice is so soft. He sounds like he wants to cry.
Steve’s talking to someone, now. Two men and a woman, they’ve captured him into their conversation. He’s a party trick for them, Tony thinks. He knows how that feels – people still treat him like a freak.
No one ever uses that word, Tony thinks mildly. They probably should, because then he could get used it, and he wouldn’t get that awful buzzing in his ears when it’s brought up. “What about it?” He asks, mildly.
But God, Sarah would be sad. And Rhodey… Rhodey would always blame himself. Is that fair? Tony feels like he’s going through motions. The urge to die is lessening even as he contemplates it. Why? Why does he need to die? To avoid doing something he doesn’t want to do? Who the fuck tries to kill themselves because they’ve just come into billions of dollars?
Tony, stop. You’re allowed to have friends. You’re allowed to have friends who aren’t Steve. Look, Sarah likes you. She does like us, Tony. Why else would she want to go for a walk? You think she does that with all her patients?
him. His body, his mind, every part of him, to get what they want. Tony doesn’t want to be instrumental. He just wants to exist as an end in himself.
Steve is momentarily elated at Tony’s easy capitulation. He calls down, and within ten minutes Natasha arrives with two burgers without buns, a side of salad, and some soda. She carefully sets the tray down on the side table and picks up the old, untouched, stale sandwiches. She puts a straw in the drink so Tony won’t have to lift it with his shaky hands, and she’s cut the meat into small cubes so he won’t have to. She helps prop Tony up on pillows, saying nothing, not even making small conversation, but showing her ease and forgiveness, her own repentance, in the gentle way she smoothes the blanket over his lap, places the tray carefully on his knees, and brushes hair that has stuck to his cheek behind his ear.
Tony sighs. “Very little upsets me, Commander. I just – hope that he’s, uh.” He clears his throat. “Working for people who have his interests at heart. I wouldn’t want him… put in harm’s way.”
“What’s the harm?” Steve asks, gently. “You’re among friends. We’ve all suffered, we all – understand. You won’t be judged here.”
Steve grips his wrists, holds them down on the floor, nose nestled between his ass-cheeks, mouthing at his balls. “Oh, fuck,” Tony groans, twitches away, gets held firm. “Steve – maybe now is the best time to mention, there’s a room full of – oh. Oh, oh, oh. Oh, okay,” he finds himself nodding, hopelessly, pushing himself down against the feel of Steve’s tongue, “thank you, okay. This is fine, this is good, just – don’t stop.”
“You… gonna let me go?” There’s an instinctual, hind part of Tony’s brain that is flaring mild panic signals.
She’s the right mix of chirpy and reserved. She talks, which means Tony doesn’t have to, and if that makes him comfortable then, well, that’s best. Tony keeps a wide berth from the rest of the team; upon meeting Bucky in the hallway, his response is to look the other way. Steve doesn’t mind, because for all intents and purposes, Tony is getting better. He wakes in the mornings to walk Mosely, long, meandering things, which – while always in view of the compound – he’s allowed to take alone, trusted. Sometimes, he’ll discuss whatever he’s reading with Natasha, tentative at first, and then long talks which digress into heated argument. His moods appear to balance out. He even puts on weight.
The sharp movement sends him reeling, the whole world spinning. It's like, it's like vertigo, or when you hand upside down and get up too fast. He's twirling around and it's making him sick.
Some time passes. Tony pats Steve’s back, rubs his shoulder, heads back to his car. He drives away. His tracks are quickly covered by the snow.
Steve’s still asleep. Steve can’t be woken. Trying to push Steve off of him is like trying to move a brick wall. He moans, says something that’s slurred, and closes his arms around Tony’s waist.
But then, when Tony was scarred and charred and lying in a hospital bed in a foreign country, Steve hadn’t balked, had he? He’d sat there with him, and held his hand, even when he’d spat at him, and threatened him, and screamed curses about his lineage.
Tony drags a shaky hand across his mouth, wipes an errant strand of drool. “Yes,” he says, blinking up at him, shocked but not exploring the docility with which he’d replied.
“I didn’t feel like I was being hurt,” Tony says honestly. “After Christmas – there was nothing at all. And we had been so
The man mumbles something about a wife, about prior engagements. He pushes back his chair, stands abruptly. Steve shrugs, easy. “Must have got spooked,” he smiles around the cigarette. “Excuse me, gentlemen.”
Bruce sniffs slightly. Steve thinks he might be crying. “It was intentional,” he mutters, “it must have been. Tony knew cars, he knows how engines work, he wouldn’t — “
There’s brief silence, the sound of fabric. Then, skin on skin. Steve grunts. “You going to call me Sir, Tony?”
Tony had nodded, stared blankly, and in his head run back the days to better times, when Steve would hold him close.
He braces his hand on Steve’s shoulder, but Steve just catches his wrist, pulls it away; he’s aware, as always, that he
so yes. as per usual, thoughts are greatly appreciated, they're pretty much the only thing that makes me write. or at least the only reason i post. if you're enjoying this, pls let know!
He can’t breathe. His lungs are compressed against Steve’s body, his stomach has nowhere to go. The light from the arc reactor is shrouded completely. “Rogers,” he wheezes, panicky, and so, so awake. “Rogers, I can’t – wake up. Wake up, you’re hurting me.”
He gasps. “Yes, I am,” he agrees, licking his lower lip, “I am, very, very bad Steve. I’ve been very bad, without you. I’ve done lots of b-bad – “
He thinks, he can remember what happened. Pierce’s face had been close. Crouched by the bed. Tony had already taken off his clothes, desperate bitch that he is. He’d been saying something, voice kind, soft. Tony remembers, distinctly, the feel of his lips when he leaned up to kiss him. He remembers,
“I wish…” Tony sighs. “I wish you’d made different choices, Steve. I just can’t help but shake the feeling, I wouldn’t be here if you had. I’d be at home, or in a queen-size at the St. Regis. God, do you remember that? Best birthday ever. Next time -- "
“I hope,” Pierce murmurs, “that he won’t be late.” Tony wonders what he’ll do to him if Steve is late, or if Steve does not come. He doesn’t want to be scared, but he is – a mindless kind of fear, simple, an aversion to pain, a dread in his stomach.
“Right. So – ” Tony pulls his hands out from under the water, shakes them dry. “I’m sitting at that table, and I’m kind of having that moment. Where I think – ” Tony’s voice cracks, and he clears his throat. “I mean. I was sitting opposite Captain America. Do you know what that’s like?”
"Oh." Tony says. He stares at his arm. Why is there a drip in his arm? Fuck, did he hurt himself? Where's Steve? It's cold, in here.
It’s hard to think of anything at all, save for the cock in his ass. “Knot me,” he moans, “oh fuck, knot me, Captain.”
And he needs Steve. Steve's warmth, now, his smell; coffee and vanilla and something else. Something Tony can't place. Something Steve-like. He needs all this and more. He needs to drift. He needs to sleep.
He presses forward, just slightly – eyes shut, nose close the skin of Pierce’s jaw. Sandalwood. Sandalwood and – his dad’s aftershave, still. Tony is sitting on his dad’s lap, in his study. The floors have just been waxed clean, lemon. And his dad is showing him how to shine a shoe, bristles and polish.
“You can’t let this sit. Can I be honest with you? I know you don’t want it. That you can’t take it. But Tony, we’ve reached a point where you can’t keep blocking yourself out from the world anymore. Now, you can take this money, give a few scripted interviews, shake a few hands, and then move out to Alaska and never talk to anyone again and that’s
Tony feels him swelling, pushing past his lips; his mouth stretches to accommodate, but his jaw – it
“But not all omegas are rich,” Steve reasons. “I knew prostitutes, Tony. They weren’t being snapped up.”
“And my face,” Gus croaks “look what she’s done to my face. My ear. Tony destroyed her, Captain, and I can guarantee that she has worse planned.”
Holding out the bait. Steve snatches. “Sit with me,” he says, like it’s his decision. He clears off his sketchbook, a couple of pillows, pats the couch. “I was wondering about that, what happened, the other day. In the stairwell,” he clarifies, as if it needed to be clarified.
And so I started drinking more. I know I drink. I know it's a problem. I know I can't sit here and criticise Howard when I'm just as bad. And above all, Tony, I hope you don't too. I hope you never, ever become a drinker. It's in your blood, insanity's in your blood. Tony, if you're reading this, please never forget: with your genes and your money, you have every chance to become a monster. Do not let that happen.
Steve offers to drive him to the mansion. Tony doesn’t respond. He just upends his chest of drawers into a suitcase, throws in his laptop, gives back Steve’s sweaters. He drives away, and doesn’t take Steve’s calls.
He’s only been out of the hospital a few days. The first week, maybe two, he was so out of it – could barely string a sentence together, and still too ill to be moved. He’d had Steve. Steve had stayed, for all of it, even though Tony will admit he wasn’t the most appreciative. He had been angry, the times he hadn’t been dribbling; the pain made him tetchy, and he was still drinking his meals. It hurt too much to stretch the skin on his jaw talking, and eating. So mostly he’d let Steve read to him, while he stared at the ceiling, fluorescent lights blurring until he slipped away.
Tony goes silent for a while, and Steve is stroking his hair, so he thinks that’s the end of the matter. But then, clearly frustrated, Tony sits up. “Look,” he says, “I know he was there tonight.”
Thor doesn’t sound angry. There’s no tell-tale ozone. He just sighs heavily. “You’re old,” he says “but still very young. I was like you once, Steven. Had you twenty more years under your belt, I don’t doubt you and Stark would have seen eye to eye quite happily.”
When drunk, Tony could go one of two ways: he could be your best friend, or your worst enemy. Steve learnt early to tell the two apart, to predict who he was getting before Tony even took a sip. If Tony arrived at his doorstep eyes shuttered, disheveled, shoulders tense and — most likely — briefcase in hand, Steve knew to silently pass him a shot, get it over with, like ripping off a bandaid.
Tony leans into it. Pierce’s eyes are shut. He wraps his right hand in Pierce’s hair, slides them there, lovingly, a caress, the same way he touches Steve. And he curls his left hand, wrist broken,  around the lip of the decanter, heavy crystal.
Steve puts an arm around Tony’s belly, so he can lean against it, and then puts two fingers down Tony’s throat. It’s not sexy. Gently, he coaxes him to throw up into the toilet bowl, pushes his hair back from his head, and then passes him a glass of water.
(On a side note, you may wonder how I’ve felt about this all these years. The truth is, Tony, I stick to my religion, at it’s basis although I can no longer say I believe in a God. And I know you ignored most of my conversion attempts, but the Catholic church, at it’s core, believes in peace. I can tell you honestly that I abhor war, but appreciate what your father was trying to do)
Tony tries to twist his neck in the direction of the voice. In front of him, blurry: men, and some women. Sitting on couches, coffee table. Everything sort of blurs into peach, peach and gold with some red. All their skin is peach. Their hairs are blonde and brown and white. Richards doesn’t sit with them; he’s all alone, in his chair, glass with ice. Tony recoils, rubs his eyes, he –
But Steve had found him, later that evening after the crowds had gone. He was sitting at the indoor pool, pants rolled up and suit jacket slung over his shoulder, swishing his feet in the water. “Hi.” He’d said simply, not looking up.
Steve nods. “You couldn’t tell,” he says, putting his hand in his pocket. He pulls out the cigarettes, jerks his chin. “Want one?”
Gus rolls his eyes. “I was,” inhale, exhale “going to,” he keeps breathing, heavy, “ask if you could maybe get my cigarettes,” another breath “from my back pocket?”
Gus coughs, a wrenching thing, and he gasps in pain, clasps a hand to his chest. He nods, though. “I had a wife,” he sucks in a deep breath, presses back against the wall “A daughter. A son.”
There’s old film, and some new pieces, too. Steve had wondered where his drawing had gone, his little monkey on the wire. Tony must have put it here for safe-keeping after he – left. After they fought. There are some of Steve’s books, too. He flicks through, sees the old sketches of Natasha, of Vision, of Tony. “He kept them,” he croaks, thumbing the pages. “He cared.”
"It's not about me not wanting to, you know. It's not just that I don't want to, to spank you," Steve winces over the words "it's just, Tony, honey, you have, you have problems, you have your own problems, and it's my job to -- "
Steve looks at him, more serious. “But that’s not your type,” he says, “is it? I thought you just – that was a power thing, an influence thing.”
“I’ll talk to him,” Tony says dismissively. He clears his throat, realising he probably looks a little too eager. “I’ll talk to him,” he repeats, slowly. “It’ll be fine.”
“Here,” Fury says, “if we could – maybe, the alpha’s should stay in this room.” He clearly unhappy, taking Tony’s shoulders, pushing him through the door into the observation room.
“I figured,” he says, as levelly as he can, probably. “Still. There’s a difference between liking it rough and – Natasha told me she saw you come in earlier. And now you’re drinking.”
It smells. The old bandage is sticky with blood and pus and secretions. It’s hideous. He’s hideous. Steve doesn’t lie and say, ‘no’, or ‘you’re beautiful’; he says: “For now.”
Tony hits the wall with an ‘oof’, trapped, secure and snug against Steve’s chest. Back safe, Steve warm and smelling like sex and alpha, big and broad
“I believe you,” Steve says, and Tony feels relieved. Steve believes him. There won’t be any trips to psychs who peer into his head, and they won’t put him on some kind of watch, or send him to rehab. It was just a mistake, and Steve believes it.
“Gone?” The man breathes, sitting up, pushing himself against the wall. “To earth? You think he’s still there, are you stupid? He did it. He clicked his fingers, he got what he wanted. He’s not on earth, he could be anywhere – “
“Steve,” Tony soothes, “Steve Rogers, it’s okay. Here,” he rests his hands on Steve’s cheeks, wipes his tears. “You’re safe now, aren’t you Steve? Safe right now, in this bed.”
“No! No, Jim, no, never like that. I don’t know what’s wrong, it’s — honestly it’s unlike him. I promise, these sort of episodes are so rare…”
and the adrenalin kicks him back up again until he gives up in frustration, sits up, rubs at his eyes.
The kid draws the back of his hand across his eyes. “It’s not fair,” he breathes, “it’s not fair, not for him.”
Tony sobs. “I had to do it. I don’t want to do it. Sometimes it hurts so bad – like a knife. I wish I didn’t have to. I wish I was alpha, or beta. No one’s going to look at me anymore, not at all. They don’t listen to me because I’m me, it’s because I’m pretty, it’s always been that way. I don’t want – I’m – “
He feels his fingers curling around the crumpled photograph, pulling it free from his jacket pocket. He doesn’t want to see it again, so he shuts his eyes, holds it out. He doesn’t have the energy to speak. Steve takes it from his hand.
“Believe me,” he’s saying, looking genuinely pained, “I don’t want to have this conversation any more than you do.”
Which is when he becomes aware of a soft moan. Steve turns, spins rapidly, neck cracking with the force of it but can’t find anyone, he is alone.
“Steve would be here,” Tony whispers. “He would be here. Anyone would be here, to find me, save me, but they haven’t come yet. Why?”
In the weeks running up to his death, Tony grew increasingly morbid. “I keep dreaming about a black dog,” he’d say. “You know what that means, Steve?”
Eventually: “What is this,” Steve asks. His voice is level. Calm, almost. Which feel unbearably dangerous. He seems to realise that Tony can’t possibly answer, so instead he asks, “is this from a contract?”
“Good, Steve,” he tells him, carefully sitting himself on his waist, stroking his shoulders, his scrunched face, pained. “You just lie here, okay? Let me do it, Steve, because it’s going to help. This’ll help you, darling.”
“This is my advice,” Tony says, probably too harshly. “Use T’challa. I can’t help you. I don’t have the mental capacity or will. I can’t — face that world anymore, understand, kid? Do you get it?”
Tony winces. “Probably, yeah. I admire your guts, though. Not many people would buy me a drink under his nose.”
And Tony sighs, then, releases something Steve didn’t realise he was carrying. “Did he – did he say anything? About me? Or about – any of it?”
Tony wails, defeated. He lets himself slump onto the floor, it’s not like he’s got a chance anymore.
“50% chance either way,” Peter reasons. “Even if I’d stayed on earth and gone on the fieldtrip, I’d still be dust – “
And it’s better, gone. It’ll grow back. It doesn’t matter. It feels good to just take the whole thing off, giggling. He hopes it disgusts them all. He hopes when people see him, they recoil and think,
Tony frowns, picks apart the contents of the package. “I didn’t know you had gags in the thirties,” he swallows, keeping his voice even.
She tells them, again, in no uncertain terms, that Tony is here, that the only reason she brought him to Earth, was because the Sorcerer Supreme was under the impression that only he was necessary. That’s all the knows; that’s all Strange said. But as time goes on, it becomes apparent that Tony left a bit of himself out there, on that rock of planet. He’s not all there. He’s fragmented, pierced, shattered glass. Or rather: they’re all shattered glass, splintered. Tony’s just broken, pieces missing.
“Peachy,” Steve spits. “And you know what, Tony? I’m not clever. I’m not some rich, educated, suave motherfucker, with a fancy degree in a made up specialism, and if that’s what you want – fine, by all means, take that. But don’t string me along,” he cries, shaking his head, “don’t – don’t invite me here, and then leave me, like I’m disposable, like I don’t matter, because
His smile is cold. “Because he stole it,” he agrees, pulling Tony’s shirt and vest down over his shoulders, baring his chest. It’s cold in the stairwell, near freezing, in fact.
fucking my neighbour. I don’t even look at my neighbour. C’mon, she’s beta, Tony. I can’t do that, you know I can’t.”
“I don’t. I just know that you’re not going to let a few puritans undermine your initiative to spite me.”
It’s a metal thing, ugly. Not the kind that you see in the softcore porn he sometimes watches, with the sweet, breathy omegas will big red balls in their mouths. This is the kind of thing you might put on someone if you wanted to torture them, maybe by slowly extracting each of their teeth. Four prongs, two on each side to hold the mouth wide. Adjustable, in case you want it extra freaky.
"Perfect." He murmurs, and Tony makes a soft noise, a sigh. "You like that?" Steve grins, smoothing his hands over Tony's ribs, bringing his deft fingers up to play with his nipples. "You like it when I touch you?"
“I’d like to see results by the end of the week. Tell Rogers I have a job for him. Tell him why he should accept.”
“You got rid of it,” Tony says quietly. See? The first voice hisses, he wanted to get rid of you! He is desperate to get rid of you! They all are! They’re all too civil to say it, Tony, but they want us gone! Why are you forcing yourself to stay, no one wants you, you don’t even want you, why don’t –
He lets go of Tony’s hair. He can’t hold himself up. He pitches forward into Pierce’s shoulder, smears drool against his crisp white shirt. “There there,” he soothes, stroking his hair. “Shh. It hurts, doesn’t it? Being so open. Like a wound.”
Pressing Tony forward, pushing at his back with a hand, so his chest is near Steve’s face. “This is impressive, though,” he admits, stroking a palm over the reactor. “I don’t even want to know how deep it goes. I figure – it must have hurt, to put it in.”
Steve moans again. Tony thinks he might be crying, but he can’t tell, because there’s blood rushing in his ears. “Jarvis,” he croaks, and then, “Steve, please.”
His apartment is warm. Tony’s left the lights on for him, and there’s a traybake wrapped in foil waiting for him in the oven. Thoughtful, although Steve’s not hungry. The door the bedroom is slightly askew; near enough silent, he slides through and peels off his damp coat, slings it over the chair to Tony’s vanity.
“For the record, that whole – pack, feral, fuck-it-out shtick doesn’t fly so much anymore. But I’m, uh,” Tony’s breath is heavy, “willing to let it slide. This once.”
“Within limits. I can – push him,” Tony admits, reluctantly. “Probably. So long as he feels he’s in control.”
But scenting Pierce, the panic that should accompany the memory never comes. He mumbles. “Hmm?” Pierce prompts.
“You must have imagined it.” Tony narrows his eyes, comically quizzical. “I don’t know, maybe it was your subconscious speaking.”
“You can talk in your sleep, you know,” they tell him. But Tony’s eyes are already getting heavy. The cold water from the towel drips down either side of his temples. Delicate, and soothing.
So it continues this way for a while. Steve is told it’s a month, but for all he knows it could be more. Or less, even.
The doctor springs into life. “We can do that! We can get Mosely, Tony, would you like that? Like I said, aid dogs are a common part of — “
He kisses him, quick, unflinching. If Pierce is startled, he only shows it by curling his hands in the front of Tony’s shirt. Tony, understand, is so good at this; they
The man shrugs, nods at the bartender when he slides over their drinks. “Espionage,” he says, with a flourish, downing his in one. “War. Whatever it is they do.”
“You,” Peter says again, and he lunges; Steve holds him back, fingers digging into his arms – he’s strong, usually strong, almost… almost unbearably. “You! You fucking – like a
“It’s — poisoned,” Tony says, lacklustrely, because it suddenly sounds ridiculous even to his ears. “I don’t know what they’re trying to feed me.”
It sets a strange tension Tony has been carrying with him at ease. Peter’s fine. He’s got the team. And the team — doesn’t need Tony anymore, because it has Peter.
Why did Steve make him do this? Why did he make him do this, why has he made him come down here, they all hate him, hate him, hate him, Wanda smiles gently and she’s laughing at him, they’re all laughing at him, he’s going to scream, he’s going to scream at all of them, he wasn’t ready for this he isn’t ready, why did Steve have to make him he was always making him why couldn’t he just –
“Mmm,” Tony agrees, listlessly. He’s thinking, disobeying Ty was fine in the moment, but what next? He still has that footage. He can be impulsive – it was one of his least favourite things about him, the way he would just
“Do you want him?” Richards blurts. “You can have him. We can settle this the old way, if that’s what you want – reparations, you can use him, just please,
“It’s fine!” Tony bites out, kneeling, trying to scrape the glass back together. “It’s fine, it’s fine, it’s fine. I’ll just,” he laughs “had an accident, so – I’ll fix it, you, you go and deal with Nat – Natasha, I mean, you – ”
He flags down a cab, bundles Tony into the back. He meets the driver’s eyes in the rearview mirror. What is he looking at, Tony wonders? The disfigured throat, scarred, not-worth-bearing, no one wants to see that ugly thing bent back over pillows, or the smeared make-up, the too-red lipstick drawn over his lips instead of on them? The thin fish-net thing he’s wearing over bare skin, his unwashed hair, racoon-eyes and sweaty skin. “What are you looking at?” Tony spits, “Take a picture, it’ll last longer.”
“Right. Until it’s been eradicated, so.” He half shrugs, spreads some peanut butter on a slice of toast.
“Don’t you hear me? It still can. Tony let’s go now. Let’s move away. What’s holding us back? We’re free men, we don’t have to — “
There’s something thrown in his face, freezing, dumped over his head. Ice slips down his chest, burning cold liquor. The smell of it – he feels violently sick, he doesn’t know why. They laugh. “Go on, then,
Steve sighs, rolls his head to the side. He is thirsty, he is hungry. He doesn’t have time for this.
He’s later than usual. Their meetings don’t normally run this long. In the meantime, Tony has drunk. Has drunk?
“That fucking mouth, huh.” Ty says, thumbing his lower lip. “It was good, getting some face time with the big-wigs today. I always you knew would come in handy.”
Fury is sitting at an old, circular table. There’s some paper wedged under a leg. And there are coffee stains on the wood. He has one arm slung over the back of his chair. In his other, he’s holding an orange.
“It was very thoughtless,” Tony agrees, sweetly. “But I accept your reparation, gladly. See? There we go. No need to fight.”
Rogers doesn’t smile. Does he ever smile? Briefly, Tony thinks he’s going to let go of his wrist, but he doesn’t; he lowers it, uses it to tug Tony closer. “What about now?” He asks, quietly. “Do I seem ‘pushable’ now?”
“Right,” Tony agrees evasively, because they both know that’s just a front. “Well – thanks, anyway. I didn’t ask for it, or want it, but thanks.”
“We were,” Dalcher says. She wears her hair clipped back in low bun – Tony used to be so fascinated by her hair, the way it feathered on her shoulders. “Briefly,” she adds.
“He would rather remain private. But he came to me, said there were grounds for reimbursement if you sued. I told him I didn’t think that was likely. Was I right to think that?”
Tony had made pancakes. Apologised, and said he wasn't used to sharing a command. Steve had agreed, said he shouldn’t have reacted the way he had, and the whole time all he could think about was the way Tony had throbbed in his hand and the way his neck is still bruised with the marks of his teeth.
He runs through a checklist. Steve is safe, sleeping soundly. Carefully, he crawls across the bed. Outside, in the kitchen, Nick is snoring contentedly.
Tony clears his throat. "Gus." He says "You were an ass. But you tried your best. And... maybe there was some good inside you, somewhere." He thinks "And I'm sorry Lana couldn't be here. You should know that at least someone loved you, at the end."
“Of course not,” Steve crows, “you’re the full package. Alphas just quake as you walk by, right? They’re
Tony really does want to start crying then, because at least he has a home to go to. He may not own it, and he may not ever have the money to buy it back, and sure the things within it are currently held in this strange quasi-half his, half the State’s, vacuum, but his mom’s picture won’t be gone, the oil family portrait will still hang over the fireplace, all his dad’s work and writings will still be hidden in the basement. He thinks T’challa will let him have it, and it’s all he needs. He doesn’t need ten houses and fifty sports cars, all he needs is a home to go back to.
“It seemed like a good idea at the time,” Pierce shrugs. “He wasn’t HYDRA, if that’s what you’re wondering. Although, neither was I, back then,” he muses. “Different time, I suppose. I wanted different things.”
Steve shrugs a shoulder, wraps one arm around Tony’s waist, hitches him close. Reflexively, Tony puts his hands between them, but then – shudders. Steve is walking him back against the bar. “We’ll see about that,” he says.
This time, when he approaches, he doesn’t speak; he’s holding out a handkerchief, monogrammed, which is a stupid detail to notice at a time like this. “Here,” he says, gently. “Don’t worry. The hallway is blocked off. Take your time, From Stark.”
Steve blinks. "I -- " he says "I do. I do trust you, of course I do. Some things, though, some things aren't... meant for subs to handle." He says, delicately. "Not because you can't!" He adds quickly "Just because -- I want to take care of you. It's better when I care for you. I feel better, that way."
Tony lets his head fall back, lets him snuffle along his throat. “That’s it,” he murmurs, eyes half-lidded. “Steady, Steve. I’m – I’m – “ he fists his hand in Steve’s hair just to feel him, “I’m here for you, darling. All for you.”
And Tony continues to sleep, all the way through lunch, right up until dinner. When he finally wakes, his sandwich is stale, the parka rucked up to his hip, skin flushed and hair greasy. He drags the back of his hand over his face, sits up, smacking his lips the exact same way he always used to after a particularly long snooze. His cheeks have more colour, Steve thinks, although that could be wishful thinking. “What time?” He croaks.
Steve sits, lets a nurse unstrap his suit, drip antiseptic across his wounds, stitch the worst. “Thank you,” she tells him, as if he’s done something worth thanking.
Tony jerks awake. He’s moaning; he’s still moaning when he wakes up, and for a few seconds he can’t work out who in the room is making the tortured, dog-in-pain sound. “No,” he croaks, swearing it. “I won’t let you go! I won’t let you – I won’t! I won’t!”
Pierce looks at him, strangely. “You,” he says, voice soft, confused, like he doesn’t understand how Tony didn’t reach that conclusion.
Pepper’s eyes are glossy. “Well, thank you,” she says, clearing her throat, taking the box from his hands, “but I really insist you should stay for dinner.”
He sits him up, tells him to breathe in and out. Tony shakes his head; he doesn’t want to breathe. He wants to hyperventilate until his lungs can’t contract or expand, until he’s wheezing, choking, gone –
Tony drops the glass onto the carpet, unthinking. "Sorry." He says. "That was stupid. Let me get a towel -- "
After building work was finished, and Tony officially moved in, he and Steve would come out here to sit, sometimes. Tony would bring his work, which was always so all-consuming, and Steve might paint, or, increasingly, bring work of his own. They’d pack a lunch. It was always pleasant. Tony thinks Steve is having the same thoughts as him but he doesn’t want to mention it. What he does want to do, though, is jump in. He wants to get his feet wet and swim. He wants to douse himself in the clear water surrounded by trees and red leaves and baptise himself, be reborn.
Tony shivers, slightly. Shuts his eyes, swallows. “That’s not true,” he says, dragging them open, slow and languorous. “I’m not cruel.”
“Good,” Tony says succinctly, and then, because it’s nagging at him, “by the way, sometimes it’s just easier to allow yourself to be touched. Even if they hurt you. Especially if you’re getting something in return.”
And Tony laughs at that, feels himself smiling. “I guess that’s true,” he says, “you know I’m a stubborn bitch.”
“I don’t,” Tony hears himself agreeing, softly, “and it’s a hard thing. Thank you, for doing it. For putting yourself through those things, for the good of the rest of us.”
“He tells me everything,” Tony says, blasé. “I think I should – call a cab, you know? Maybe pick up the car tomorrow, or send someone to… was that punch spiked or what?”
it. Tony always took up space; his voice preceded him, his thoughts too big for the mortal coil. To sit in a room, on a planet, in a universe where he no longer exists –
He must see the look in Tony’s eyes, because he stops. “Maybe, that’s for another day, huh?” He smiles, wearily. He searches Tony’s face; whatever he finds must comfort him, because he starts to ease down beneath the sheets. “C’mon, sweetheart,” he exhales, “c’mere. That’s it, on my left – I’m not sore there, you won’t hurt me.”
I am including this letter as a part of my will. Which, generally speaking, means that if you are reading this I am dead.
Pierce raises an eyebrow. “If you insist,” he says, in a way that means he’s wrong. “You might think I’m being – forward. Sorry, if I am. You grow pretty accustomed to these kind of talks when you work in this area as long as I do. You’d be surprised how many men we’ve let go because they couldn’t separate the personal from the public.”
