Steve felt the hairs on the back of his neck stand up on end just thinking about him. He’d been in his and Sam’s unit for a mission in Afghanistan, brought in through Special Ops to act as tactical back-up for an extraction of military intel from a small village in the desert. Steve had hated Rumlow immediately, he was savage and brutal and had no regard of civilian life. He was one of the few guys Steve guessed had joined the army because he got paid to shoot people rather than to serve his country. He was proved right during that mission together when Rumlow shot 17 civilians in order to clear them a path to get the intel back to base rather than try an alternative longer route.
Steve was sure he’d come soon if Tony didn’t, his body was insistently rutting against the mattress as Tony fucked his mouth and he wasn’t sure whether it was Tony shaking or him anymore. Tony’s heels were going to leave bruises on his shoulder blades as he dug them in, cock hitting the back of Steve’s throat again.
Of course, it wasn’t Tony. He didn’t want Tony to message him. He needed Tony to ignore it so Steve could be done with this whole infatuation.
“It’s not about you.” Natasha told him over her shoulder, “Their fight.”
“We want to stay together. We’re not signing them without Steve.”
Rhodey was having none of it, “Don’t even try it. The Captain? Are you serious? You know what’s he’s done? He’s a cop killer, Tony.”
“I know you can hear me!” Clint continued to shout, eyes on the two-way mirror, “I know you’re watching.”
“So, what’s the plan here?” Tony asked, testing the give on his restraints, “You keep me here, rough me up a bit and tell The Captain you have me? Because I have to say that isn’t going to be a great plan for you.”
“That won’t work, everyone saw him return after he arrested you.” Fury replied.
Tony didn’t follow him. Steve wondered whether it was because he was finally seeing him for what he actually was, or he was realising how screwed he was to have chosen Steve in the first place. Perhaps this was it, the moment Tony walked out the door and didn’t come back.
"You aren't going to like this," Steve started, hands in his pockets so they couldn't see him shaking, "I need you to listen before you interrupt. It's important you understand the full threat we're facing here before you weigh in."
Tony took up the right end of the couch, Thor sat next to him and gave him a smile and a pat on the back in greeting. Bruce was in the arm chair, a mug in his hands that if Tony had to guess was the only thing keeping him awake right now. He looked tired, wrecked. Had he been volunteering at the clinic today? Bucky sat on the edge of the arm of Bruce’s chair, arms crossed. He was the only one who didn’t look happy to see Tony but he wasn’t quite scowling yet so Tony would take that as a win. Sam and Clint were the only ones missing and Tony wondered where they were, what was more important than finding out how to free Steve?
Tony pulled back; pupils blown. He kept his eyes locked on Steve’s as he slid his hand down to cup his growing erection through his pants, “I guess that means we’ll just have to be quiet.” He responded cheekily.
Steve could feel his cock grow harder at the lines of Tony’s body pressing against his, he could feel Tony’s own hard cock through his jeans. He wanted this as well, he had from the moment Steve had stepped into the garage.
“Sam told me you left the bar with that mechanic last night,” Bucky replied, “Doesn’t explain why you didn’t come home though.”
“They used a hacksaw.” Bruce told him, pulling more gauze and vials from his bag, “Sam, morphine. Yellow label, 5mg in the syringe.”
“This isn’t what fuck buddies do.” Steve reminded him.
He was on top of Steve before Steve could get his bearings, smashing a fist into Steve’s face with a brutality that Steve knew was from his army days. A blinding rage that guided all his movements. Steve needed to gain the upper hand and fast.
Tony woke up first, to the smell of sex and sunrise. He shuffled lazily, cocooned in Steve’s warmth as he laid against his side. The sheets had slipped down to their waists and despite the December weather and the fact they were both naked - having ditched their shirts in the middle of the night - Tony wasn’t cold. He was thirsty though.
The sea of eyes around him were still confused, all except Natasha. Steve saw her eyes soften for a fraction of a second. She understood.
Steve shook his head, “We don’t have time for this. We’re not at a high school sleepover.”
This was good, they were communicating at least and that meant maybe they stood a chance of working out whatever was going on between them.
"No, chances are they'd split everyone up. Less of a threat that way but we can work around that. Give it some time, wait for the dust to settle and in a year or two come back together in a new city." Steve replied.
She lays her hand on his shoulder. "You know I love you. You're one of the best people I've ever met, and I want you to be happy. But you're not thinking about this from his point of view and you need to."
After a moment Steve says, "All right," and leads him over to the general store, since he's pretty sure that'll be the most distracting place.
"And if I never learn?" Tony says quietly. "If nothing I cook is ever edible, and I never want to do anything but laze about in the shade all day and let you do all the work?"
Tony exhales shakily.
There's such a morass of conflicting feelings and urges swirling inside Steve's head that he isn't even able to fully parse what Tony's saying. What does get through to him makes him feel like an utter failure, though hell if he'd be able to explain why.
It strikes Steve in the gut, the desperate longing for Mr Jarvis to stay. He's a good man and the gods can see how very much he cares for Tony, and how well he takes care of him. Steve wants to be able to ask him how to make Tony happy. Once he leaves, Steve will be the only other person on this mountain Tony knows. Steve wants Mr Jarvis to
He looks at the clock again. It'll start getting light in about an hour, likely. That ought to be long enough.
For a while they stay that way, warm and drowsy and content, shifting every now and then to get a bit more comfortable, a bit more close to each other.
were to give
Reading this back to myself, I can understand why it's confusing. Why did I advertise for an omega if I don't need help with the farm? That's where the root of some of my own confusion comes from as well, I think. I must've had a reason to advertise, which means there was something I wanted or expected from whoever answered. If I'd just met you the normal way and started courting you, it would be so much easier to understand when I say I don't expect anything from you at all.
With every piece of my broken heart,
Out from the shadows and into the sunlight steps the beautiful man.
Steve wakes the next day hazy with anticipation. He tumbles out of bed, washes and dresses before he's even fully awake, he's so eager to get downstairs and so hopeful that Tony will be there.
The sun sets not too long after Tony finishes his letter to them, and Tony follows Steve up to their room. To their bed.
"What?" Tony squawks after what looks like a few failed attempts.
well: he somehow managed to stop thinking about this whole mess with Tony long enough to nearly traipse up to the house completely naked. He ducks against the wall of the barn, even though there's no way Tony'd be able to see him from the house or the yard, heart beating wildly and face heating with shame. He looks down at his clothes in his arms. The jeans will be far too difficult to pull on over his still-wet skin, and he has to wear the boots the rest of the day no matter what and doesn't want them damp.
"That's
It's an overcast day, gray and rainy, though thankfully the rain is light enough that Steve's not worried about flooding. He and Tony have been inside all day, quietly working on separate things but existing in each other's space.
"I'll do
"You taste so sweet," Steve whispers back, because he does. "So sweet, Tony."
did what you want change? What did I do? What do I need to avoid to keep it from changing
Tony laughs again, falls back a little, and Steve rises up on his right arm enough to free his left hand. He traces the outline of Tony's smile with his fingertips, Tony playfully following, then drags his fingers down the hollow of Tony's throat, marveling at the smooth, soft skin. He flattens his palm and draws it reverently down Tony's chest, enthralled by Tony's muscles twitching beneath him, nearly undone by the way Tony gasps and hides his face but flinches forward when Steve presses the heel of his hand against Tony's nipple.
Mr Jarvis goes first, which surprises Steve; he'd assumed Mr Jarvis would help Tony up. But a split second later Steve realizes this means Mr Jarvis will be sitting
happy? Ever?"
Steve hums. "M'gonna anyway."
No. Steve doesn't want to wait. Steve wants to pick Tony up and march into town and roust Thor from his bed and get married right this very second.
"No it's not."
Tony still doesn't say anything, but his look of flat disbelief speaks enough on its own.
Steve looks at this perfect stranger sitting in the armchair on the other side of the fire, and thinks about waking in the dead of night from a dream he doesn't want to remember and writing with shaking hands "My best friend died in the mountains because I couldn't save him" and feels more flayed open than he ever has before, knowing that this man read those words and it turns out Steve doesn't know him at all.
"Anything," Steve says when Tony trails off. "Anything you want. Anything at all."
"Yeah," Tony says. "The vote was split on which one of them should get to have me. Zeke's father wanted me to marry him, my father wanted me to marry Ty, my mother wanted to figure out which of them had more money, the whole thing was a mess. Well. Behind closed doors it was a mess. As far as anyone else was concerned, though, it was the romance of the year."
"Maybe we should go," Steve starts, "we can come back tomorrow or –"
I've been thinking about how to say this for hours, and the best I can do is tell the truth, and the truth is what I want changed. What I wanted when I took out the advertisement and what I want now are different. It's as simple as that. I took the advertisement because, quite honestly, I was lonely. And I'm doing well for myself, but it's
"Oh god no," Tony laughs. "I didn't get it either, at first. But finally he said don't run away. Run
Tony does look at him now, all huge liquid eyes and downturned mouth.
So they get back, and eat dinner, and retire to the pair of armchairs by the fire ostensibly to read, and as the day drags on and the shadows lengthen Tony gets – well he can't get more quiet, since it's not like he can speak less than not at all, but – it's like everything
Then Tony says, "When you lifted the trunk, did you notice I started to get hard?"
"No problem, man. And remember what I said about the party."
It's the work of but a moment to secure the Star, but even so by the time he does Tony's already out of the buggy. He's standing right beside it, ignoring Steve and Mr Jarvis both, with his hands clenched together in front of him and bouncing on the front of his feet. He looks like he's trying to take off running but some invisible force is holding the back of his pants. But... he's looking at the house? And... not quite smiling, perhaps, but
They wake in the pale morning - not together but not
"But you don't
think that horseback hand-stands are necessary for survival out here? What if all he knows of the west is what they write in those horrid pulp novels? What if he thinks that if he doesn't darn your socks you won't force him to, but you'll get someone else to do it instead and resent him for it?"
If anything Tony looks closer to the verge of tears than before. Steve can see half a million replies flit across his face before he settles on one. His tone and expression completely at odds with the flippancy of the words Tony says, "I hope you're telling me the truth about that, because I want to do exactly what we just did and nothing else forever."
Tony's sprawled back, arms out, hair a mess and dark with sweat. His eyes are closed, lashes clumped together, mouth slack - he's still panting, and looks like he's ready to fall asleep.
Steve pushes his face into the slick, intoxicating skin in front of him. Finally able to reach, he kisses the beginning of the swell of Tony's ass - that perfect,
Yes, Steve decides as he drifts off to sleep just before dawn, Tony really is one of the bravest people he's ever known.
Steve doesn't really believe him, but he looks closer and sees that Tony's smiling, now, soft and sad and hopeful all at once. Or maybe Steve just can't see well through the darkness.
"Mister Rogers," Mr Jarvis says, setting his cup down and fixing Steve with a hard look. Steve is definitely not imagining the glare. "Anthony is an unusual young man. He's not like most other young men, or most other omegas. He's not like most other
Tony's moving against him, hands sliding and clutching, hips pulling back and arms pulling their chests together, like he's trying to get closer and doesn't know how to do anything but try to get away instead.
of them? He's left just standing there, not even able to respond or try to smooth things over, because he just doesn't
Tony must feel the way he tenses because he says, "I'm not going to break, you know."
That night when they go upstairs Tony follows Steve into his room without a word. The bed is neatly made, Tony and Steve's pillows beside each other as if they always have been. Neither of them hesitate to get under the covers, this time, and once more Steve falls asleep without realizing it. This happens every night for a week, this strange phenomena of Tony following him to bed and neither of them mentioning it, and for a week Steve's sleep is peaceful.
The room is yours. Any of the rooms are yours. We can even trade if you like; the one I have now is bigger than the one you're in. It's yours for as long as you want it. It's yours for the rest of your life, till the end of time, and I will never, ever make any presumptions upon it.
"You're not a hermit." Clint waves an imperious hand. "You live in town and everything."
Steve hadn't wanted Tony to have to do a single thing – not just today but for a long while yet, not till he gets settled and decides what he wanted to do – and had expected to not want to spend much time on supper, so all he has to do is heat up food he's already made. He is, of course, embarrassed by this too, as all he has to offer is a hearty stew and thick bread. He'd thought – well. Clearly he'd thought a lot of things that weren't going to come true.

He goes down the stairs and intends to just grab a hunk of bread to eat on the way when he spots an envelope on the table. His heart leaps in his chest, his mind immediately screaming LETTER FROM TONY! TODAY IS THE BEST DAY OF THIS WHOLE WEEK!!
here. Steve must have missed him somehow. Perhaps Tony disembarked further down the train? Except the only other place to exit the train is straight out the back of the caboose, and why would Tony have done that? Unless – oh
Then he gathers his bag and boards the train and doesn't look back. Steve and Tony stay on the platform until the train rounds the first curve and is lost to sight. And then Tony and Steve climb into the buggy again and away they go. Alone.
"What're you doing?" Tony mumbles.
"Just the once every day," Steve says, confused.
"What'd they tell you, sweetheart?" Steve rubs his thumb softly against Tony's temple.
"Steve!" Tony shouts on the top of his lungs. His fingers twist in Steve's hair, but he doesn't pull Steve off - he pulls Steve forward and bucks his hips, pushing his delicious cock further into Steve's fervent mouth, and Steve holds his breath and does his best to cover his teeth and sucks Tony as hard as he can.
to be inside an omega, and I always thought there was something, something
brings to mind, especially with the memory of Steve's adorable blush just from hearing Tony say the word 'sex,' is enough to keep Tony awake for a long, long time.
Steve's been out in rain that soaked through his clothes before, but this is something else. He's been thrown fully-clothed into deep rivers and come out less wet than this. Even his saddle is wet beneath him, which is its own special hell all on its own.
Clint shrugs. "Who do you think's gonna do something? You planning on knocking over the store, Sif?"
The sound of his voice knocks Steve out of his head. He realizes that Tony's standing perfectly still, too, and rigidly straight, his eyes wide and frightened.
Steve says, a gut-punched noise, and Tony wraps his arms tight around Steve's head and pulls him down and
He nearly gallops home – would gallop, except that'd be unfair to Star, and Steve can use all the time he can get to better plan this out – so he contents himself with a slow trot.
If you don't have someone you'd be comfortable writing to, please consider writing a letter or a holiday card for the Rainbow Cards Project. RCP sends letters and cards from queer people to our queer brothers, sisters, and siblings who are alone, to remind all of us that in our queer family we're here for each other.
It's raining. The words aren't adequate for what's happening, the same way it isn't adequate to call the night sky kind of big, but nevertheless those are the only words Steve has: it's raining.
She gives him a hard look. "I can tell you how to find this out, but it will not be easy. You will have to do things that are very, very difficult for you. I know you, Steve, and this will not be easy for you."
That afternoon there's a knock on the door and Tony nearly jumps out of his skin.
"An alpha named Ty, too. Tiberius Stone. I'd known Zeke my whole life – our fathers were business partners, so we were practically raised together. And Ty was new in town, swept in from the Continent and decided to marry me."
But Tony's smiling now, small and unsure but genuine. "I know what you mean, Steve," he says softly. "Let's go," and he doesn't finish the sentence but he motions to Steve's room and Steve nods.
After a moment her lips quirk in a tiny smile. She leans up on tiptoes  and kisses his cheek. "You're a good man, Steven Rogers. Now go make sure your husband knows that, too."
This one time, gods, this one time Rhodey came over. We were, what, maybe nine? Ten? Howard spent the whole time embarrassing me. Telling Rhodey all these terrible things about me - all things that were true but secret, you know? I still wet the bed. I'd cry if someone even looked at me funny. I couldn't go to school with the other kids because I was too stupid. Why would anyone want to be friends with someone as pathetic as me? And I couldn't even say anything, because I'd
"Ana?" Maybe she was the person Tony was truly in love with?
For some reason, though, Clint makes a fool of neither himself nor Steve. He simply tips his hat as he passes by the buggy and Steve raises his hand in greeting.
Steve is so bad at this. He is
But then I got here and now...
He's surprised to find the kitchen occupied not by Tony, but by Mr Jarvis. He's more surprised to find a hot pot of coffee waiting and, when he looks around as he pours himself a cup, the room seems to have been tidied. Cityfolk make no kind of sense.
The closer they get to the house the more Steve wishes he could just skip the next hour or two of his life. If wishes were horses, though.
And the image

When Steve does take a tray up that evening he knocks and simultaneously opens his mouth to say he'll leave the tray on the floor outside the door, but then the door is flung open so quickly Steve nearly jumps.
"I'm not going anywhere," Steve says. "I'll still be here. But I'm used to sleeping on the floor. It'll be fine."
When Tony releases him with a wet sound it's Steve's turn to lie there and pant, staring down at Tony in wonder.
in person. Not that it's a bad thing! If anything, in person he's even more enchanting. Just... In all his letters, Tony was so curious. About everything. Steve told him about so many things, about his friends and the house and the surrounding environs and Tony seemed so excited. He'd asked questions and follow-up questions and he was interested in Steve himself, too; managed to get Steve to tell him things Steve hasn't told anyone. Even over letters he managed to take Steve by surprise and get him to say things he didn't mean to say. And now –
Steve, though, wonderful Steve sees him staring at the writing desk and wringing his hands and after a few moments of confusion his face lights with understanding. He really is quite smart; Tony's not sure why Steve never brags about it or anything. But Steve doesn't even say anything; all he does is smile at Tony and kiss his cheek, then go get his whittling and bring it to the table. He turns his chair, though, so that it's facing away with the back pressed against the table, then he settles in with his work.
it can be very difficult to get to know him, but doing so will allow you to get to know one of the most amazing people to ever live.
Steve shoots to his feet, part of him wanting grab Tony and shield him, part of him wanting to go fight whoever's at the door. He looks at Tony and Tony's eyes are wide, his feet planted like he's bracing for something. Steve catches his eye and motions to the stairs. Tony gives him a grateful look and bolts.
Steve came when they had sex this morning, or said he did, but Tony missed the whole thing. Literally all of it. It's not just that he doesn't know what Steve's face looked like, he also doesn't know what his cock does, or if he shakes or goes still, or how far down the blush goes, or what noises he makes -
At last Steve can't take it anymore, and the moment it's plausible he says, "Well. Guess I'll turn in, then."
There's the sound of Tony's quiet footsteps on the stairs, and Steve hastily sniffs and wipes at his eyes, starting guiltily like he's been caught doing something wrong.
Tony did indeed take off at least his shirt, but he's under the covers. He's not actually clutching them to his chin but he's clearly not entirely comfortable, so when Tony reaches for him and pulls him in Steve goes at angle, wrapping his arms around Tony but keeping his hips firmly away from him. He's leaning on his right elbow, his arm beneath Tony, Tony's own arms around Steve's shoulders, Steve's left hand rubbing up and down Tony's arm.
She hasn't even made it over to them before Darcy comes barreling out of the back room. "
"Of course, I mean," Steve starts, realizing how stupid he sounds, "obviously I don't know exactly what it's like for you. I've never been in this situation before, and how coming here affected both of us is different, so. I don't know exactly what it's like for you. But I. Know a bit."
he say? "If you'd just," and he holds his hand out to the buggy to indicate they should climb up.
Then Tony doesn't want to know.
Steve looks around, too, can't help it; looks around like he's never seen the room before, despite having built it with his own two hands. Sees it, again, through the eyes of wealthy city folk.
Before meeting you - No, even before that. Prior to leaving New York, I suppose, I had a very clear picture of what a good husband and a good alpha would be, and you only fulfilled that fantasy some of the time. The rest of the time you were like nothing I'd ever hoped for, like nothing I ever dared dream. I wanted so badly to trust you, Steve, but the more sure of you I became the more I doubted myself. And, to be honest, the more selfish I became, too. The more you gave me the more I wanted.
Steve swallowed dryly. "I'm gonna go home and finish all this." He gestured around the pile of paper on his desk. He quickly jammed most of it into his bag and fled his office.
Peter glanced up at him sheepishly, Steve gave him a suspicious look. The older man almost groaned as the small brunette turned on his superpower,
At the time he had also considered the added bonus of hiding from the judgemental eyes of their neighbours.  But right now he couldn't help but wince at the worry at the back of his head, for he meant anything to Steve or was the blond just sowing some wild oats.
The boys groaned on witnessing the scene. Peter sprinted over to them, his heart still squeezing with fear on seeing the broken window pane.
. It did not take his neighbour even a minute to type back,
Tony felt his heart flutter. "Yeah?"
"I don't know when you are gonna get this inside your wonderfully thick head but--" Tony slid over so that he was sitting on Steve's lap. He leaned forward, tangling his arms around the blond's long neck. He let out a satisfied hum on inhaling Steve's musky scent. He whispered into his ear, "It's me, you and Peter."
. He ran a hand through his hair and inhaled sharply.
Tony turned around to glare at the dirty blond who was still in the middle of a fit of giggles. He sighed and turned to the women again.
"Oh. I just thought, maybe you wanted to look at these pictures…" He muttered pointing his thumb to the battered album lying open on the desk.
"Oh you like that, Joe?"
Tony let out a humorless laugh not saying anything. Peter glanced up when the silence got too heavy. He squeezed Tony's hand on staring at the photo with a pained expression in his rheumy brown eyes.
"You look amazing." Steve gestured to Tony awkwardly.
Tony walked over to the guest room and knocked at the door nervously. After a small pause, Natasha answered him "Come on in, Tony."
The whole neighbourhood had been shown up. Well everyone except his closest neighbour. The only times Tony saw the man was when he came home from his early morning jogs or late night shifts. Which was completely fine with Tony as long as the man didn't develop new hobbies like arson or vandalism.
"Holy shit…" He mumbled under his breath as he stared at the cover of the book. It was painted by hand and quite professionally too. Tony ran his hand along the cover, showing a small brunette with a tiara on her head.
Steve turned around and felt a smile tug at the corners of his lips on seeing a little boy and father walking up to the house.
Peter stayed silent as he was dragged over to a small group of boys. He stood awkwardly as Johnny started to introduce him. Peter felt himself wilt as the others stared at him.
Johnny just gave him a wide grin and dragged him out of the house. The older blond shouted, waving to a group of boys, "Tommy! Billy! Harley!"
"Stark, go over to Steve's right now!" Tony blinked in surprise at the harsh favour of Barnes' words. Tony and the other man did bicker every once in a while but it was over silky matters like lack of taste in movies and the latter's old fashioned ways. For all he acted like a macho, big brother who would kill Tony with a shovel if he hurt Steve, he was actually pretty cool with Tony. Which was why Tony was confused about Barnes growling at him presently
"Peter, I really hope you will come over to my house. You can have fun with my brother Johnny," She told him kindly.
"It's not me, Mrs.Storm! I promise!" Peter pleaded, feeling his eyes burn with tears. What would his daddy think if Mrs. Storm said that he had been naughty?
He flipped through the pages carefully and he had to admit, it was one of the most beautiful picture books he had ever seen. The only question was why would someone just give away such an expensive book. Sighing, Tony dropped down to the couch and the book on the table. He was about to slip into his bedroom when he saw the message inscribed on the book with a pen.
over the blond's head. Oh. Steve crying made a lot more sense now. "Hence, the crying." He muttered.
Steve smiled at the carpet, fiddling with his fingers. "Just hope I won't mess things up..."
"This must be your son!" Susan said, crouching down to meet Peter's gaze with her own. Peter, who had been fantasizing about meeting their neighbors till the moment, darted to hide behind Tony's leg.
She shook her head, "He's not big on cooperation. He talks to no one, doesn't come for community events… The only time I see him is at five in the morning when he comes back from his daily jogging session."
"I thought your ma was going to cry with me," Steve smiled softly as he put the stack of assignments back on the desk.
Peter glanced at Johnny who was looking at Harry with a helpless stare as he patiently listened to his fears. The tiny brunet swallowed and slowly made his way over to the house. Peter had seen a nice man over there yesterday, so maybe he would help him get Harry's ball back.
"What are you doing to him?" The boy demanded, crossing his arms on his chest.
"Soon, bubba," Tony planted a kiss on his cheek. Peter wiggled in his arms and glanced up at Tony sleepily. He furrowed his eyebrows at him as if he was deep in thought. Tony couldn't help but be surprised when his six-year-old son let out a loud gasp.
The blond shrugged. "Peter's dad, right?"
Mrs.Storm's eyes softened a little as she stared at Peter. She hid her face in her hands for a moment and took a shaky breath. She looked up at Peter with a shaky smile. "I know, sweetheart. Why don't you boys go play outside?"
"Where are your friends?" Steve asked, wrapping an arm around the little boy's shoulder. He blinked in surprise on seeing Peter scrunching his face in disgust. "Johnny and Harry are playing baseball again."
From what Tony could figure, this poo poo person did not fall under the ugly category. Definitely not, if the scarlet shade on Sue's cheeks were anything to believe.
"Then get it yourself!" Flash snapped, crossing his arms on his chest.
book.
"Yes. But you would have to squint," Sue told him in a voice that made Tony want to lean in. He looked at her with a confused expression on his face.
"Yes but not on my birthday, Rhodes." Tony rolled his eyes at the soldier. Tony really loved Rhodey, he loved him like a brother. But sometimes the man could get overbearing. Currently, he was insisting that he wanted to give Steve the shovel talk even though he knew it's his birthday.
Nibbling on his lip, he texted back,
"Hi. It's me, Tony." He whispered, feeling his heart break on seeing Steve's puffy, red rimmed eyes. Steve stared at him, his eyes still looking lost.
Inhaling sharply, he smiled to himself. They had things to discuss about but that didn't mean their love was any less true. Nodding to himself, he twisted the doorknob next to him. Tony froze to the ground on entering the room. It felt like he had entered another universe, a universe filled with unicorns and fairies. The room was starkly different from the rest of the house with walls covered in bright print paint, plush toys scattered around and fairy lights adorning the walls. Tony stumbled over and sat down at the edge of the bed.
"No, it's okay Steve, really. I don't--"
Tony stared out the window for a moment,  a mischievous smirk playing on his lips. He ducked his head and typed a few raunchy messages to send Steve. It was extremely fun to send his boyfriend explicit stuff, considering that the twenty eight year old man got flustered like a teenager after reading them.
Tony glanced down at his sleepy son as he tucked him into his bed. Even though he was bursting to do a full scale interrogation, he reigned himself in. He had decided earlier that he would question his little boy after he had fulfilled the necessary amount of sleeping hours. Tony gave him another chaste kiss on the forehead. He shrugged on seeing that Peter still had the book tucked inside his arms. Tony gently pried the book away from his arm and walked out of Peter's room.
Tony stopped rambling on hearing a grunt, he glanced down to see Steve looking at him with a painful look on his face. "
The brunet swallowed, "Yep."
"Maybe we can finish the drawing. You don't hafta…" Peter mumbled, a pout playing on his lips.
"I assume you like our new house?" Tony asked.
The boy let out a shriek of giggles on hearing something his father said. Steve felt his heart clench painfully on hearing the little kid's laughter.
"I don't know what you're talking about… But my boyfriend is a sexy, artist professor who loves me and my son. He also has a heart of gold. Did I already say that? I don--"
"It wasn't me..." Johnny grumbled all the while he threw his arm around Peter's shoulder.
Tony waited for an answer patiently as Steve shuffled around trying to get comfortable. He held back a smile as the blonde rested his wet cheek against his neck, burying his face into his shoulder. He almost thought that Steve had dozed off until Steve leaned into his ear and whispered, "Okay…"
"Peter!"
"You wanna know what's the matter boy?"
Tony sucked in a breath feeling his heart pound against his ribs. It was exhilarating. It felt like pure bliss to finally get the elephant off his chest. He moved away from the desk to get his jacket And snapped, "Just because I'm silent doesn't mean I can't bite back."
"But listen-" Rhodey started to argue again. Tony sighed, dropping the key lime pie on the counter and walked over to grip Rhodey's shoulder lightly. "No, you need to listen, Rhodey. The last months haven't been easy on me or Steve. Especially in Steve's case. He deserves to have a good day. So, please don't spoil it for him."
Peter glanced up at him, his eyes round with surprise. Steve raised an eyebrow as the kid stared at him for a long moment. Peter nodded.
Tony couldn't help but chuckle as he walked into the Storm's living room. Peter was sprawled out on the couch, clinging to Johnny like a koala bear. Sue went over and pried Johnny away, making her brother whine.
Steve gulped hard hitting the send button. He was flirting with Tony. God, it had been almost a decade since he flirted with someone. His nerves were spiking with fear. But deep inside, even he had to admit it felt good.
Steve returned it quickly and went inside, locking the door tightly. He leant back and chewed on his lips as he glanced at the room next to him. He lingered for a few moments before deciding to go in.
Peter nodded and pointed to the upstairs window. Tony shrugged, feeling his chest slowly fill with worry. Was Steve having a bad day? Why was he hiding in his room at his birthday party?
Tony fell silent, knowing that Steve wasn't finished. He wasn't an idiot; he had noticed the use of past tense too. Tony glanced up to see Steve staring at the burning candle as if it had personally wronged him.
"Daddy, my book!" Peter cried out, a sheen of tears already forming in his eyes. Tony quickly gave Sue a plea of help. Thankfully, Sue, bless her soul, started to search around the room.
Steve stepped away from his bike and jogged over to his front porch. He stopped trying to find the key to the door on hearing unfamiliar voices. Right, new neighbours.
"Shall we?"
Steve whimpered into the pillow feeling a deep wound throb inside his chest.
Peter perked up with that and walked away from his leg, even if he still had an ironclad grip on his father's slacks. He glanced up at Sue with a shy smile on his lips. "Really?"
Tony simply shook his head, "Nuh uh, It's definitely not me who does not understand."
Steve was halfway done with the buttons of his shirt when he heard Bucky speaking with someone. He cursed under his breath on hearing Tony's voice. The blond quickly popped his head out the door and snapped, "Buck, I swear,  I'll throw you out of the window if you give him the second degree,"
"Tony?"
Tony held onto Steve's arm as the blond gave him a desperate look before dissolving into a sob. The younger man shook his head, "Get them out! Get them out. They're gonna get crushed! I'm  begging you…"
"Ah, yes. Plucky Barnes," Tony smirked at Bucky.
Tony was pissed. He had to sit through hours of press and then endure another lesson from Obie about being calm towards intrusive questions. You would think that's the worst part of his day, but, no. Apparently, his hermit of a neighbor was now gifting Peter expensive books. Tony appreciated the thought but it would be better if he knew the man wasn't a pedophile or kidnapper or something. He had gone over to confront him but once again the house was locked shut and his motorcycle was missing.
Tony glanced up at Obie and felt his guilt ease on seeing the anger ebb away from the man's face. He gave him a shaky smile, "See, we can work everything out…"
"Because- Because you deserve better Tony." Steve muttered, stabbing his thumbs into his eyes to stop the tears, Tony guessed.
Bucky dropped down on his table clumsily and let out a scoff, "Remember when Becs ate your painting?"
Tony let out a pained groan as he climbed out of the car; he may be getting slightly old to drive for hours straight.
and the other looked like he could be a double for Captain America.
Steve smirked, trying not to look like a fool by jumping at his offer. "Probably."
"I saw him with Bucky," Sarah told him with a kind smile. He beamed at her gratefully and skipped out to the garden. Sure enough Peter was there with Bucky. The brunet was tossing Peter into the air, making the boy dissolve into shrieks of laughter.
"I was so scared…" He muttered. To his surprise, Tony chuckled. "Believe me, we were too."
"Hello?" He squeaked out, knocking his small fists against the door. Nobody answered his call just like the first time he had visited the place with his father.
"Well, I thought it would be kind of unbecoming to pick food off my beard at dinner," He told Bucky with a small smile
Tony was almost out of the door but he suddenly stopped. He gripped the door knob thinking to himself for a moment. He turned back to face Obie, who to his pleasure was looking a bit pale. He smiled at the man sweetly. "And I don't know if you have seen the exact substance of my old man's will but Stark Industries belongs to me. Entirely. I decide everything from the brand of toiletries to who pulls the big guns here."
"No, Tony. Listen." Tony pursed his lips, feeling his heart flutter as Steve took Tony's hands in his own. It was probably stupid, but suddenly, his head went blank. The only thing he could think about was how warm Steve's hands were.
Tony grimaced, slowly turning over to Sunset. The beautiful brunette bit her crimson stained lips and winked at him. Fighting off the urge to roll his eyes, Tony asked, "So... a PR stunt?"
Tony jumped out of his skin on hearing Natasha's voice, suddenly remembering why he had stepped inside the room. Glancing around once more he quickly fled and opened a few more rooms until he reached Steve's. The blond's room was nothing like the other, it was military clean and extremely impersonal. Well, except for another framed picture of his family on the dresser. Sighing, Tony moved to open the drawer to get a shirt and get the hell out of the room.
Tony's lips were soft, warm and felt like a salve against all the wounds festering inside him. Steve let out a growl as Tony pulled away from him, feeling a twinge of sadness Tony's warm body moved away from him.
"Some people collect stamps, some collect paintings, and I collect cars," Tony chimed in, as if he had read Steve's mind.
"Hello, Steve!" Jane says as soon as soon as they enter. If Steve thinks she smiles when she saw him, it's nothing to the way her face lights up when she sees Tony.
Tony smiles at him but doesn't say anything. Mr Jarvis side-eyes him so severely Steve resolves to keep his mouth shut for the rest of the drive. He has no idea what he did to garner such a reaction.
big and strong. He keeps his back straight and his gait loose and rolling, and tries not to make it terrible obvious he's flexing his arms. When he steals a glance at Tony, he thinks Tony's looking at his arms and shoulders. Steve tries not to grin as he leads them across the platform.
Tony sets his jaw, eyes glittering, and raises his chin like he expects - he doesn't expect Steve to actually hit him, but he does expect a verbal slap.
After he knows not how long Steve's shaking, and not from holding himself up on his arms. "You too?" Steve says, breathless. "Please?"
is spotless; Steve's been a nervous wreck ever since Tony said yes, and for the last few days he's been cleaning like a madman, just for something to do with his hands, just because he'd wanted everything to be absolutely perfect for Tony.
Putting it all down in words (well, in euphemisms and allusions, but close enough) makes it so much more real, and so much more open to scrutiny. Suddenly Tony's looking at this not through his own eyes, but through theirs; picking it apart from every angle to see where the sharp edges are.
"So," Tony says, trying to sound conversational but voice muffled as he burrows into Steve's shoulder, "I'm considering rescinding your permission to ever
After a little while, though, despite their best efforts they're both nodding off. Steve laughs into Tony's mouth, shuffling them around so they can lie down next to each other comfortably, and laughs harder when Tony makes an affronted noise and glares at him sleepily. But as soon as Steve leans in to him again Tony rests a hand on the side of his face, drawing him forward for more kisses, both of them tangled together warm and content and kiss each other to sleep.
Mr Jarvis sighs, and Steve gets the distinct impression he's trying not to roll his eyes. Then he looks at Steve, lips pursed, clearly weighing every possible nuance of everything that could possibly happen in either scenario. For no reason Steve suddenly wonders if Mr Jarvis used to be a soldier.
think a good, a good marriage is, and you don't know what
We do have things to fall back on. No one today is in exactly the same situation that Tony was, no matter how similar a lot of it might be, because we have organizations and laws and people who don't know us but will still help. The situation may seem hopeless now, but you'll never know how much hope there truly is unless you ask.
Into Tony's chest Steve says, "Tony
"Before we go," Steve says, suddenly hesitant again. He hates talking about things like this. Uncomfortable things like speaking up when someone's being cruel or disrespectful he can do all day, but social niceties or customs or things that might inconvenience someone else – those things he hates talking about with a passion.
Dear Tony,
"Shouldn't I be trying to impress you?" Tony says, but he's still smiling. "Making it seem like I'm self-reliant enough to be a good partner, and not a weak, hysterical omega?"
"There you go," Tony says, and kisses his forehead. "I'm right here. You're here. It's all right."
"All right," Steve says. "Hope you like it. If there's anything you'd like to change or if you want seconds just let me know." Tony frowns at him and Steve smiles and turns to go downstairs.
The fire is burning cheerfully in the grate. Tony was, indeed, curled up beneath a blanket in the armchair with a book. But there's also a pile of pillows and blankets in front of the hearth, and there's a chair and some things Steve can't quite distinguish rigged up next to the fire with what looks like every towel they own draped over it. Something in the air smells absolutely delicious.
"I'll also let you know," Steve says, "that this town is – We're all friends here. And I've a strong notion we're a good deal less formal than they are back East. There won't be no tongues wagging if we go to the house first. Though, to be honest," Steve says with a smile, "there's like to be more talk if I
I'm sorry it's taking so long for me to trust you. I do trust you, Steve, I do. I don't mean to be the way I am. I trust you but I don't
"N-No," Steve chokes, "it was real, it was
Neither of them say anything when they pull up in front of the post office first. By the time Steve has Star tied to the hitching-post Tony's already gone inside and is coming back out, and when he catches Steve's look he shakes his head. Steve wants to put a hand to Tony's shoulder, but he won't touch Tony without explicit permission. Tony sees his hands flexing and smiles up at him, touching Steve's arm just barely with his fingertips, and Steve reflexively smiles back. Feeling lighter despite how worried he still is about Mr Jarvis and Mrs Ana Steve says, "We should start at the sheriff’s."
"No you don't," Tony says firmly, pressing down on his shoulder. "I fed and watered the stock and let them out. After the night you had you deserve a little actual rest. So you just stay where you are until you very well feel like getting up."
A little while later Sam just
He doesn't let himself think about it too much; if he writes something foolish or stupid or embarrassing or untrue he can just re-write it. Better to get everything down now while he's thinking about it.
Mr Rogers, what do you want? Just tell me what you want. You don't have to try to convince me or manipulate me or trick me any more, all right? I'm spun about enough. You've won. Congratulations. Just tell me what you want and leave me the hell alone.
It seems to take years, but at last Tony and Steve are both standing in Steve's room, on opposite sides of the bed, Tony clutching his pillow in front of him like a shield.
downpour – Tony might be about. There'll be a fire lit for sure, and he keeps envisioning Tony curled up in one of the armchairs in front of it, warm and toasty-dry, with a book or maybe the one letter from Jarvis he likes to read and re-read. Maybe he'll even be extra sweet and have the kettle near the flames to keep it warm for Steve. There won't be any supper, of course, since neither of them know what time Steve will finally get home; Steve had made sure to warn Tony he'd likely be out quite late.
Steve laughs. And to think just twelve hours ago he thought he'd never laugh again. "Something less than that, I think."
"All right sounds good thanks for dinner!" Tony closes the door in Steve's face and Steve walks away smiling.
This information is met with deep deliberation from both Mr Jarvis and Tony. Steve realizes they're probably trying to decide what train Mr Jarvis will return on; whether they'll be able to hold the wedding tomorrow before the train comes, or if Mr Jarvis would have to wait till the next day to go back.
been more difficult or painful than it is now. Especially when Tony tugs on Steve's elbow, and as soon as he turns Tony dumps a bundle of too-heavy towels into Steve's arms, and he realizes Tony even thought to heat some bricks for Steve to put at the end of his bed.
“You’re being modest.” Tony groaned.
“I cant.” He admitted with a smile. “Alright I guess it’s my turn. Like I said earlier, I grew up in several group homes. And I didn’t watch too many game shows because there was one TV that only had VHS and we only had tapes that people donated.”
. You know the one I told you about. Steven.” Tony cut in.
“Ah! No backsies, mister, why, you scared?” He mimicked childishly and ripped his shirt off over his head, dropping it the ground with ease. Steve tried not to look, although his already hard pink nipples were eye level.
“ATLEAST NOT FOR FREE!” Clint’s drunken voice somehow managed to reach the stage, earning a middle finger from Rhodey.
Steve forgot that he had to speak.
For a split second he thought Tony was hugging him.
Still, the times he was with Tony, when the third party would go to the bathroom or get a drink, a new and unsteady friction had clouded the air, as if the presence of another person was just what both of them needed to get in the way of it.
“Hey, that’s not true. Why are you friends with Tony?”
. But I’m not. It’s… Refreshing, to say the least.” His words trailed off, flowing away and trickling down, he edged closer to Steve, perhaps for warmth, maybe for comfort.
“I said I was sorry like a million times... please?”
Out of all the times he’d kissed Tony. It was the first time that Tony kissed him.
“Do you wanna sit?” He asked cautiously and gestured to one of the few empty tables.
“Awww you guys are so cute.” Clint mocked in a sing-song tone, Natasha bopped him over the head with a cardboard coaster.
“Well yeah it’s a little too late to back out now.” Tony said sarcastically, mostly because he was a little absent at the time, sarcasm seemed to be his default at times.
“Tony.” Firmer, softer, trying to win back at least a glance from him. He did, his lips twisting and convulsing in frustration, like they were struggling not to say what he wanted to say.
“Okay – Wait. Can I talk to you? It’s cool if you’re busy.” Steve turned around from the pile of thin pillows and blankets he had been shoving his face into. Figuring if he were to successfully ‘move on’ from a relationship he never had he should probably take some initiative and maybe not let all of his friendships degrade in front of him.
He placed himself in front of the table, leaning his back against it gently - one, so he looked more relaxed and two, because he didn’t want this girl who was obviously much cooler than him think he was Buckys weird friend who drew strangers in bars.
“I… Tony I think you’re great. Well more than great. I haven’t met anyone like you and I don’t think I ever will. I knew that the first time I ever saw you. It was like everything I thought I knew about myself just disappeared and I didn’t remember what my life was like before I met you or I didn’t want to remember. And God I wish I could think of a word for it because I’d be doing you am injustice to just say I like you. I wish it was that simple but really, I’d do
“Tony?”
“That’s what you said after you persuaded me to come on a double date with this girl you were chasing and her friend - remember the one with the giant mole on her nose - and then you ditched us and left me alone with her.”
“Who’s gonna hold my hair back when I’m throwing up now?” Bucky half smiled, standing up to walk over to his old friend.
“Didn’t realise I was being interrogated here.” He said promptly.
Tony waved his hands around uncomfortably, speaking in a sarcastic tone that was so rehearsed he must have practised it a hundred times. “Yeah, that’s all a little too
“Steve, I… I…”
Steve modded again feverishly, his fingers grazing against the bottom of Tonys shirt, dipping into the slit in the middle and sliding open one button.
Thankfully, to his relief, Tony either got distracted or didn’t want to hear Steves answer, speeding ahead of him towards a figure shrouded in blankets and sweaters upon sweaters, a shopping cart beside him loaded with various bits and bobs, a very old looking antique lamp too.
“Well you stopped.”
Steve just smiled, glad that he was sat with Tony instead of her. Not for any malicious reason. But because really, he only wanted to be with him and no one else.
“Then go ahead.” Taking a deep breath, trying to relax for him.
It was comfort to a sickening and sad degree, that was all. He was too inebriated to know if that meant it was right or not.
Tony’s door was slightly ajar, and he pin-pointed the sound coming from inside.
There was a clanging of metal from behind him, he turned towards it in enough time to swipe his thoughtful thumb away from his lip.
“Pretty sure that was a given.” He said with a friendly smile.
Feeling a sudden burst of adrenaline and productivity from his and Bucky’s make-up session he decided not to lie on his bed listening to playlists he imagined Tony might make for him and feeling sorry for himself and clean his area of the room. Most of the time Steve operated like a soldier, making his bed every morning, not leaving a single crease on the bed or a sock on the floor, but his recent escapades had turned him into a bit of a slob.
“Shitty parents put you there?”
A quiet crowd of mock boo’s started and Tony laughed a little to himself.
Steve would be lying if he said he hadn’t been scared too.
Tony couldn’t breathe, and the pages began to fall damp beneath him, he had to cover his mouth to stifle some sobs as if he had to hide them although he was all alone. He kept turning the pages, hundreds of detailed or rough drawings until he reached the final one.
“Ah, I’ll keep that in mind.” He said with slightly too much grovel in his voice, it wasn’t meant for Tony, not really, he had an undeniable way of being able to tease and prod and tire and somehow still manage to lure you in, crave to be adored by him yet he was far from sycophantic. Attention-seeking however? maybe. “Tony, can I ask you something?”
Tony scoffed, but as more light began to pour into the room, and the inside of the sheets reflected red onto both of them in their secluded haven in the sheets, he could see that he was really smiling again. If only, he could be like that all the time, and they could stay under the sheets all the time and Tony wouldn’t go back to his boyfriend.
“Yeah, guys are your thing. I’ll stick to girls that are way out of my league.”
He expected her to just keep walking with her coffee, instead she stopped beside him, letting another tired student pass by her after receiving their iced-whatever from the equally tired barista.
“Cool.” Tony bit his lip unsurely, and Steve thought he was the awkward one. His eyes darted back and forth for a second before he turned, finally to go back inside, but slowly, so Steve would follow.
And at the bottom of it, he didn’t know anything about Tony. He knew rumours about ‘life of the party’ Tony ‘fucking’ Stark who could down 8 Fireballs and then ‘hack’ into the MIT school records just so he could change this kids (who had apparently said something racially insensitive to Rhodey) last name from Broderick to
“Yes.”
There was a problem, right about now, however. And that was that, yes this video is hot, and kind of scary, it just wasn’t doing it for him in the way he thought it would.
“Tadpoles. Lots of them.” Squatting by the water, wrapping an arm around his knees and pointing to faint black trickles in the water. He’d never have seen them if not for Tony. “I had to get away from everyone… Tadpoles do that too, sometimes they even eat each other.”
Tony nodded, “You still haven’t found Loki’s killer?”
Steve’s eyes darted around Tony’s condo, “They have Tony.”
Steve tried to give him a reassuring smile, crouching down so not to appear too imposing, “I’m here, sweetheart. You’re okay.”
This wasn't going to be pretty.
Another buzz from his phone was enough to make his decision. He threw his shirt over his head hastily and went to pick up his leather jacket, hand digging into the pocket to retrieve the phone.
“What’s the message?”
Tony slid into the backseat with the smile of someone who had done their job perfectly.
Deep down, Steve knew it didn’t really matter. He could overrule them if he needed to as their leader. He could say really it was none of their business because Tony was with him and not them, but he wanted them to like him. He wanted them to see why Steve liked him. He wanted the approval of his family if they were really going to do this.
The last Friday of every third month Steve’s gang, The Avengers, would meet Hydra in a mutual location to make sure territories were being honoured and business was on track. They didn’t like each other but they both operated out of Brooklyn and Steve didn’t like anyone on his patch. Steve hated these talks of politics but he understood their importance. Phillips had always told him, ‘Listen to them talk and they’ll give more away then they realise. That’s the stuff you can use.’ But that had been years ago, a time when Steve had stood off to the side as business was discussed rather than front and centre. But it was his gang now, his family, and he was responsible for making sure the terms of the fragile peace with Hydra were being honoured.
Tony sighed; how could this man be so infuriating?
Steve sighed, “Because he can’t be found here. He needs to be found at the shipment yard, along with something on his person that proves he was Hydra.”
“Immunity. The whole family. A chance at being together. You said it yourself, give it a year or two in protective custody and we cut loose to find each other again. It could work. New start. New city.” Natasha mused, “Everything you said you wanted for us two nights ago.”
Steve shook his hair out, combing a hand through it, “Can you tell the others I have a meeting later; I might not be back for dinner.”
“What’s Hydra doing in a nice place like this?” Steve called out after scanning the car park to make sure they were alone, “Isn’t the gutter more your scene?”
Steve shushed him, “Don’t try to talk, it’s going to be okay.”
The King of Brooklyn without a Kingdom. The Captain without a team. Then, he wouldn’t be either of those things anymore if he signed those papers. But Steve Rogers had died in a desert on foreign soil so he would he be then?
Tony had him trapped in the V of his hips; legs wrapped around Steve’s waist as their cocks rubbed together lazily. Tony’s hands were in his hair again, a favourite spot it seemed, and Steve could only growl in response.
“Give me a week and we’ll spar like old times. I’ll show you slow.” Steve grumbled.
Tony cut him off with a kiss, short and a little clumsy but it calmed Steve down enough that his legs stopped moving and his body didn’t feel like a powder keg, “Kill him.” Tony told him softly as he pulled back, “Kill him and come back to me.”
Thor nodded, “It makes sense if he truly craves the power of ruling a city, Captain. Bombs would made him invincible.”
Tony let him go, a million questions burning on the back of his throat. Clearly, there was more to Steve than everyone else knew. A side to The Captain that wasn’t all blood and death and business. A side that Tony had gotten a glimpse of when they first kissed, when they had slept together.
Thor looked at Natasha, “Would that work?”
He never missed a meeting with Hydra or a direct order from Steve. Clint was as loyal as they came and it pricked at Steve’s skin that he wasn’t here. It felt like he was operating on less than full capacity. Without his eyes in the sky Steve was at a slight disadvantage. As long as Sitwell didn’t learn that he’d be able to bluff through this meeting and then he’d find Clint and tear him a new one for flaking out.
Steve sighed, “It won’t stop Ross. He has my name now. It’s only a matter of time before he confirms it’s the right one.”
Their onlookers seemed to grow uncomfortable and quickly disappeared, leaving the two friends to their privacy.
“You sent a mob boss to do a cop’s work because you couldn’t get it done yourself. What did you think I was going to do?” Steve asked with a scowl, “He wouldn’t have stopped. We both know it. I’m not saying it was right but I’m not sorry either.”
"And you really think we'd win it any other way but together?" She questioned, giving him one last squeeze before releasing him, "You're so loved, Steve. I wish you believed you deserved it."
Ross’ face grew redder, “You think I lost. Your boyfriend is sitting in cuffs right now, he’s going away for the rest of his life.”
“Sorry, I’m being rude. Do you want to do it?” Rumlow offered, “He betrayed you after all.”
Steve nodded eagerly as Tony bit his own lip. He slipped his own shirt over his head as if to show Tony he was committing to this and then Tony was drawing him back into the circle of his thighs, hands grabbing at Steve’s sides as their lips fused together once more.
“Steve, bad idea. We can’t kill him.” Bucky warned him, “I want to, believe me but if you kill him then you’ll be the cop killer that Rumlow is making you out to be.”
“Steve, what’s happening?” Sam asked, voice soft and cautious.
“We’re going to fix this, okay?” Steve promised, “You’re safe. Can you stand up with me?”
Steve felt his fingers smoothing out the edge of the tape on his side, “I’m sorry Rumlow took you.”
“Did you mean it? Yes or no.” He surprised himself with the volume of his own voice but held firm.
So, that was it. He wanted to make sure Steve didn’t have something up his sleeve to get himself off the hook for this. A written confession would make a trial very easy and assure Ross the conviction he needed from The Captain. It was smart.
Bucky's eyes were scanning the warehouse, "I haven't seen him but he has to be in there. Rumlow was here earlier, left with a couple of guys just before I called you. If we're doing this, we gotta do it now."
“You’ll kill me anyway,” Was the reply, “The Captain doesn’t leave loose ends.”
“I’m ready.” Tony gasped, “Please.”
Steve’s eyes narrowed, “I know. It’s sitting at the bottom of the Hudson River. Is this the part where you arrest me, Fury? Because I have to tell you that isn’t going to work out for everyone.”
By the time he was out and ready to leave the apartment he felt better. He hadn’t thought about Steve in at least an hour, okay only once in the shower but it wasn’t his fault. His mind was a damn traitor. He shrugged on his jacket, texted Peter to say he was on his way in and he was off.
Tony’s hands started on the buttons of Steve’s shirt, opening each one slowly to expose a new piece of skin to him. Tony’s mouth followed his fingers, lips grazed over Steve’s warm skin, over each valley and peak of his chest and abs. Steve was tense underneath him, not used to having all this attention on him without being able to give back. That was good, Tony wanted him to focus on this feeling.
“If you wanted me to trust you then you should have told me the plan from the beginning.” Bucky replied.
The news was reporting the start of a turf war for Brooklyn, speculating the rise of The Captain’s enemies to fill his vacate seat. Steve couldn’t have predicted this, Tony knew, this random attack where Clint and Sam just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. Rumlow saw it as The Avengers declaring war, even without their Captain. He was coming for them all now.
23 names left on the list and that was a lot more manageable, it allowed Steve to take a gulp of his drink and scan the names left on his screen. He stopped short at one name, just over halfway down the list. It was a name he recognised, a name he remembered. A man he once knew.
Steve nodded, “Okay.”
He had plans for now.
Steve hummed, pulling away when he felt Tony’s arousal pressing against him in the circle of his thighs. Tony was half-hard, and his legs weren’t letting Steve move far. Tony’s lips moved down to Steve’s jaw, mapping out the smooth skin that was sensitive to his touch. Steve shuddered, feeling his own arousal at their position flood through him suddenly. Tony’s lips travelled further, sucking at his pulse point until Steve let out a quiet groan.
She let a small smile tug at the corner of her mouth, “So have you.”
“Howard likes a lot of money.” Tony replied, crouching down to the nearest box and assessing the situation with his eyes.
“There won’t be a next time if you don’t let me help you.” Tony argued.
Yes. Yes. Yes.
Steve’s hands pulled out of Tony’s jeans long enough to flick the button open and get the zip down before diving right back in, fingers moving into his boxers to cup him without the barrier. Tony’s whole body tensed at the move before he fumbled with Steve’s jeans, getting the button and fly out of the way so he could have better access.
Tony looks up and Steve looks down at him, and that's it.
Don't let the stars get in your eyes
"What did you want?" It's the obvious thing to ask. Nevertheless, he thinks he hears Tony let out a sigh that might be relief.
"But, but you say right here..."
? Something pretty to put in the house to play with or ignore as it suits him?
And here I go, making this entire letter about me. I'm trying to stop being so selfish, I really am.
good, to give him the chance to just get lost in something that feels wonderful -
He drifts, and it feels like spinning. Tony comes back to bed and tugs on Steve until he's wrapped around him, face pressed to Tony's warmth and arms around him. Without meaning to and without realizing it's going to happen, Steve sleeps.

Tony sets his jaw. "They told me that alphas couldn't, that they

"What makes you think there's anything wrong in the first place?" Tony demands, then bites his lip, realizing his mistake.
disappointed himself – he doesn't feel like the man beside him is a stranger, anymore, and he's no longer subconsciously waiting for letters from his Tony.
I got your letter.

"Steve?" Tony says. When Steve hums he says, "Blanket permission. All right? I'm giving you blanket permission to touch me."
After a moment Steve can't help it and he says, "Tony? I don't – I don't ever want to be like them, or to treat you like they did. I'll never do it on purpose, but if I do it accidentally, please tell someone. It doesn't have to be me, but tell
Tony comes around in front of him and sees Steve pawing ineffectually at the buttons to his shirt. His eyebrow and the corner of his mouth quirk charmingly, and he holds his hands up and catches Steve's eye. Steve lets his hands fall to his sides and Tony makes quick work of his shirt. Honestly Steve wishes it took him longer to unbutton it, untuck it from his pants and slide it from his shoulders. Steve feels cold but doesn't realize how frozen and prickly his skin is until he can barely feel the brush of Tony's fingers, needle-sharp points of heat that are gone before he can really feel them.
"Yeah," Sam says, still snickering. "That party Clint's planning and pretending is not for your and Tony's wedding? I am here to warn you it is definitely for your and Tony's wedding, so the both of you had better be prepared to be the center of attention."
Tony doesn't react. His expression doesn't change, and his eyes don't leave Steve's face. After a moment the lack of reaction gets to Steve and he smiles awkwardly, then shuffles off to actually move the table. Tony just lets him and still doesn't move, doesn't even turn his head to watch.
unless that's -"
Steve hangs his head and tries not to sigh, not wanting Tony to hear him. "Goodbye, Tony," he says. "I'll be back this afternoon."
"All right, first of all," Steve says, and he knows he sounds on the verge of terse but he's so determined to keep Tony safe he's falling into military habits, "if it
She shrugs again. "Probably you will. But what's the point of being married if you can't seem foolish around your husband every now and again? Besides, wouldn't it put
"But I don't
he rich before he married Steve? No one has clothes of the quality or quantity that Tony does who doesn't have money. So why would Tony be used to sleeping somewhere worse than a wooden floor?
Steve makes a pained noise, his hips jerking forward and his cock twitching in a valiant but pointless attempt to come again. Tony laughs breathlessly. "Come on Steve," he whispers, and bites Steve's chin. Steve's cock tries yet again. "Let me help."
Tony smirks, then shifts to get his arms under Steve's so he can slide his palms down Steve's back and get two handfuls of Steve's ass.
The thought that anything at all might change any of him, the thought of him becoming even a little bit less relaxed or aroused or happy, is
Before Steve can figure out what he's doing Mr Jarvis magics up breakfast and whisks it upstairs to tony, so Steve goes and hitches up the buggy and then ducks upstairs as well to wash and dress. He goes back downstairs to check Star one last time, and as he comes back inside Tony walks down the stairs into the kitchen. Steve's breath stops in his throat. He's in a rich black suit, and his hair is slicked back, and he's obviously put so much effort into his appearance, and it's because he's on his way to marry
Mr Rogers,
Mr Jarvis and Mrs Ana are safe and Tony's so relieved he's overwhelmed and is reaching out to Steve like it's nothing and Steve's life is perfect.
"Jarvis may have stopped me from making my life even worse, but it was Ana who really saved me."
"Bruce!" Tony says, rushing over. Yesterday Bruce had joined them just a little while before Steve and Tony ended up leaving, but even in just those few minutes Tony found a way to become fast friends with the most reclusive person in town.
Tony's breath is coming very quick, sounding almost panicked, and Steve looks up to find Tony staring at him, wide-eyed and surprised. He doesn't move, but his hands are gripping the sheets so tight they're white. Steve opens his mouth to ask, but when his lips part Tony's cock twitches. Steve stares at it, can't help himself, Tony's pretty cock pink and wet, nestled in thick dark curls. Steve licks his lips and Tony's hips twitch. Steve's mouth floods with longing, and he can't keep himself away; nuzzles at Tony's cock and presses his cheek to Tony's hair.
"Do you know, Mister Rogers," Mr Jarvis says, interrupting Steve's staring for the second time in less than two minutes, "where we might find a few people to carry Anthony's trunk?"
At least neither of them makes any snide comments about the food once they sit down to supper, and neither of them turns up their noses at it. The meal passes in perfect silence. After supper Steve cleans up by himself; even though Tony and Mr Jarvis both offer to help, Steve insists. Mr Jarvis, in particular, looks supremely uncomfortable with this, but as always Steve's at a loss to explain why.
“Perhaps but now I know you’re involved with The Captain I think there is another role you can play in our organisation.” Rumlow sneered.
“What’s their play?”
“Well, at least you understand why I left.” Tony nodded, shoving the rag into his pocket again.
“You’re getting slow, Captain.” Thor jested from the front seat.
“If only you had this much fight in Afghanistan.” Rumlow spat out as Steve smashed his head back down again, “You might not have ended up in the desert.”
“Normally yes, but right now with The Avengers having been pulled in off the streets? Everyone in a gang is scared and murder-happy tonight. Ross went to the docks, made threats Hydra didn’t like now Rumlow is gone about taking over, they killed him and left his body there.” Steve replied, “We’ll have an alibi as we’ve all been in police custody since Ross brought us in.”
“Is that what happened with Bennett?” Fury asked.
They’d be okay.
“Rogers!” Natasha called out, firm and level.
His whole body was shaking as Steve gripped him tightly with one hand on his hip, pulling away from his neck long enough to reach up to cup Tony’s jaw, moving his head down so their foreheads were pressed together.
“Maybe… yeah, I think so.” Tony replied and he could already see the hurt and disappointment on Rhodey’s face, “Hey, listen, I’m still me okay. I’m just trying to help here. This turf war, it’s going to get ugly fast and I need you to believe me when I say he’s the only one who can stop it now.”
He was met with silence rather than the uproar he was expecting, and he wasn’t sure that was any better. Where were the shouts of him losing his mind? The yells that he was an idiot and Tony was a civilian?
To Rhodey’s grace he allowed Tony two days, although Tony suspected that was only because he was suddenly called into work the morning after their impromptu movie night with a phone call. Tony had tried to ask what was wrong but Rhodey had shrugged his shoulders into his jacket, gave Tony another hug and told him he’d be back soon.
He approached slowly; gun raised as he clicked the safety off. He needed to be ready just in case.
“You need to learn to let go sometimes, darling.” Tony replied, “You’ll always too tense.”
Bucky chuckled, “Is that an order? Are you giving me orders now?” He shook his head with a smile, “Damn, Steve. I almost feel sorry for you. You’ve got a spitfire here.”
Steve planned to draw it out though, he’d never get enough of having Tony like this. He was riding himself on Steve’s cock, rising up before slowly sinking back down to grind against him before repeating the move. They were so close they were sharing the same air, every little noise Tony made was Steve’s to cherish.
That would be enough.
Thor took a sip before speaking, “I fear so. Whoever has taken over clearly want to send a message to you.”
Whilst the nightmares and panic attacks were the most obvious sign that Tony wasn’t coping with everything he’d been through in recent weeks, they weren’t the only sign. Steve would pick up on the little things he was sure Tony thought no one noticed but he did. He knew Tony, completely, body and soul and he would always notice. It was there, written in the way Tony would wince slightly whenever Natasha was twirling a knife in her hands at the kitchen table. It was there in the way the blood drained from his face when Sam had cut his hand open at the bar and needed stitches, coming home with a blood-stained shirt that forced Tony to look anywhere but in that direction. It was there in the way Tony watched him sometimes, when he thought that Steve wasn’t looking, with a disbelief that Steve was there, loving and protecting him after everything he’d done.
He did moan when Tony finally released him, a knot in his stomach that burned for him to continue.
“Sounds like Steve.” Natasha sighed, “We’ve got cops on our payroll. Apparently, Ross hasn’t even interviewed him yet. He’s waiting for something. Trying to break him before he puts him in an interview room. I don’t know.”
Tony frowned, “Aren’t I?”
Steve wanted to run, he wanted to explain all the reasons why he couldn’t have this. Instead he answered, “Yes.”
“So that’s it? You think he makes me weak?” Steve asked.
Tony ground his hips back against Steve, “So we don’t need one. I want to feel you.”
The calm moment in the cold was disturbed by the sound of Steve’s phone. The muffled ringtone blaring in his pocket against the silence of the night. The sound bounced off the steel craters as he dug it out and frowned at the unknown number flashing on the screen.
“Hi son,” Howard greeted, the words sounding awkward and clunky out of his mouth.
He could smell Tony on him, the sharp tang of engine oil, something sweeter like unroasted coffee beans and a musky smell. Sandalwood maybe, or something equally earthy. It was fogging up his mind. Steve needed to be clear on this. Bucky was right, whatever Hydra was planning, it would need all of Steve’s focus to beat it and he would beat it.
Steve flicked open the bottle of lube, pouring some onto his fingers, “Can’t a man do both?”
Steve kissed him again, “Do you have a suit?”
“To build the Jericho.” Rumlow explained, “Everything you need according to your father’s designs. If you need anything else, we can get it.”
Tony puffed out a sigh of relief, “You’re the best, you know that?” He dug his fingers into Steve’s thigh again, “Honestly, having two home bases is exhausting.”
“Could you swing the immunity?”
“Everyone’s got a name.” The Mechanic quipped back, eyes on the bike.
“I know you’re Hydra.” Tony told him, “I know this is a set up.”
“Tones, what happened?” Rhodey reached out to touch him but Tony scooted back quickly, scuttling across the small floor space until his back hit the wall and he couldn’t go any further, his eyes never leaving Ross.
Steve pulled a knife out of his boot, “Will this do?” He asked offering it out to Tony.
Steve shook his head gently, offering Tony his own bloodstained hand, red from Rumlow’s blood dried to his skin, “I already have blood on me.” Steve replied.
It was another week before Steve got the call from Fury that said he was off house arrest and was expected to be at the station on Monday bright and early to start work. Steve had felt a freedom in his bones and had a list in his head of all the places he wanted to take Tony now this mess was over.
Well, everyone except Steve but he didn’t deserve one. He, much like Rumlow, deserved everything that was coming to them and Brooklyn would heal like a scab once they were gone until they were forgotten about. Two men who once owned a city that fought back. It might even be poetic one day.
Fury eyed him closely, “I see that. What’s with the firepower?”
Tony groaned, “Fuck Steve, don’t talk about family when I’m turned on.”
“It hardly matters now.” Steve replied.
Steve smiled then, because it was so Bucky, it was so them. He had forgotten how much he missed that.
Natasha nodded, “What are you going to do?”
“No, it’s my job to protect you. I promised your mom I would. I did in Afghanistan. I did on the streets. I will now.” Bucky replied, “I can’t lose you too.”
“Hey,” Tony nudged him with a hand, “You’re still alive down there right?”
Steve Rogers was many things. He was loyal, he was a fighter, a survivor. He was stubborn and resilient, and he never walked away from a fight. Even if he knew it was one he might lose.
“So am I.” Tony replied, “Family later.”
“I can barely afford Peter.” Tony replied, “The business is good, but we’re still paying off loans to get it up and running. Next year we’ll be in the green on those and I’ll have the wiggle room to take on another full timer but right now it wouldn’t be a wise decision.”
Tony mewled at the feeling, muscles contracting and relaxing around Steve’s finger as Tony pushed back into him. Steve started to work his finger in and out of Tony’s hole, pushing a little further each time at a slow and steady pace that had Tony writhing against his hand. Steve slipped in a second finger, breathing heavily at the feeling of Tony gripping him tightly. Steve pushed his fingers in deeper, listening to the sounds he wrung out of Tony and watching the way he shivered against him, his breath fogging up the polished wood of Steve’s desk.
“You’ll have your life.”
Tony wasn’t about to draw this out though and his hands were yanking at Steve’s jeans and belt with a fierceness that had Steve standing up and trying to help him before he ripped something. Tony shoved Steve’s jeans down his legs, not bothering to get rid of the belt in his haste and then he was pushing Steve back against the desk, dropping to his knees right there in front of him so he could get his mouth on Steve’s cock.
Steve nodded, “I know. It’s okay. It’s over.” He promised, “Take my hand, okay? We’ll fix it together.”
He needed to destroy it. It was the only way to get Tony to stop fighting.
“Is that right?” Steve quirked an eyebrow. The wind had picked up and he could feel his hair brushing again his forehead.
“Is he fucking you?” Howard asked next, the words bitter in his mouth.
He was slamming into Tony now, working him hard and fast as his pleasure mounted. Steve grabbed at Tony’s leg, moving it from his waist to hook it over his upper arm instead, the angle opened Tony up wide and allowed him to reach his prostate on every thrust.
He kept his eyes on Tony for as long as he could, hoping he conveyed strength and hope and trust. Tony looked frantic and worried.
There was something about having him like this, under the haze of sleep in the early morning chill that was so domestic it made Steve want to shy away from it. He wasn’t used to it, having the luxury of taking his time with his lover. Tony however was seemingly impatient, his cock shiny with precome as his chest fell again.
Tony leaned in closer to him, closing the distance between them until they were sharing the same air, “I would have almost been turned on it if wasn’t for the fact that orange get up did nothing for your ass.”
Tony moved his head away and Rumlow let him go, heading towards the door. He picked up his paper on the way out, “Tomorrow, Mr Stark. Think on your choices wisely.”
Tony bucked against him, throwing a leg over Steve’s side to draw him closer. He broke their kiss to pant against Steve’s cheek, hands holding him in a vice grip as Steve hit his prostrate again. He worked Tony’s body relentlessly, feeling his pants dampen his cheek and vibrate through his ear. He felt his fingers digging deeper into his shoulders and his body start to shudder towards release also involuntary.
Tony leans over for the condom and the bottle of lube, sliding the condom over Steve’s length in a move that is somewhat intimate and makes Steve want to blush for some reason. Tony seems to have no such sensibilities because then he is squeezing lube into his palm and slicking up Steve’s cock like he’s part of a car engine.
Steve gave him a watery smile, “They’re smarter than I am.”
Steve got the message and sped up, he could practically feel Tony humming with pleasure and he knew his own was building fast. That pull in his stomach was there and the noises Tony was making wasn’t doing anything to help him draw this out. He rocked his hips against Tony’s, pushing himself deeper inside of him to hit against his prostate.
“It’s okay, I had backup.” His eyes drifted down to Tony for a moment, “We have just started a war though.”
“And your dad did nothing?” Steve asked, trying to keep the venom out of his voice.
Tony was preening at the words Steve said so he knew they were working. Tony took one hand off his stomach, moving it to push his fingers against his own hole. Steve bit the inside of his cheek to keep him from moaning as Tony slipped a finger inside himself. He didn’t have any lube so Steve knew it would be a difficult process, but Tony was moaning loudly as he worked his finger in and out of his heat and all Steve could do was watch.
“Tony…”
“Thank you, Fury.”
He clicked the button and held the phone out between him and Bucky like an offering. Bucky stepped closer as if to hear better.
“Fuck,” Tony called out as Steve drew out and slammed back in, “You feel so good.”
Tony was so hopeful and committed to making this plan work. To saving Steve. He really didn’t deserve him. This whirlwind of a man that had breezed into Steve’s life and somehow made himself at home there. Steve could feel the spike of guilt in his gut. This plan wouldn’t work, Ross would see through it in a second. The idea of proving Steve Rogers really did die in the desert and setting someone else up to be The Captain. Fury had worked it out, Ross would as well. It was only a matter of time and Steve couldn’t risk it. He had to protect Tony from him and this life before it came down around their heads.
“That doesn’t mean he didn’t leave again; someone needs to take his car as well. Ditch it down by the docks. It needs to look like he went back there for something and got caught by a rogue Hydra member who deemed him a traitor. It needs to look like a gang crime.”
“I’ll take my chances.”
Tony read it twice and then swore under his breath. This wasn’t good. He could feel it making the hairs on the back of his neck standing up on end. He was out of his seat before he even replied.
Oh God.
“And what about me?” Tony asked, “Was hurting me really worth all this?”
“Instinct?” Tony echoed, the silky material of Steve’s bowtie loose and hanging down either side of his neck for Tony to grab in either hand, “A possessive instinct? You were claiming me, weren’t you? Telling Hammer and everyone else there tonight that I was with you.”
Steve pushed the tip into Tony’s warmth, feeling him tense against him, “Tony…”
Clint rubbed his palms together, trying to get himself warm, “Well, if this guy is dumb enough to take on the King of Brooklyn then he deserves everything we’re going to give him.
Tony wiggled his feet, “I think you broke me. I can’t feel my legs.”
Fury paused and dropped his voice lower, “Your call burned down a shipment yard and killed over twenty people.”
Something Steve knew only too well.
When they made it back to Steve’s place, he led Tony straight to his room. He had been quite on the drive home, his mind focused on Rumlow. Rumlow knew who Steve was. He’d come for him. It would be all over.
Howard seemed to admit defeat then, shoulders sagging a fraction like he was no longer preparing himself for battle, “I need your help.”
Steve blanched, did he just? What that an offer at sex? Steve wanted to stride over there and pin Tony to the nearest wall but he also knew what a terrible idea that would be. He knew nothing about the man and he definitely couldn’t allow him to spend the night here, in Steve’s bed, and put the family at risk. Why was he even considering this?
“You really need me to answer?” She asked with a raised eyebrow, “You deserve something good Steve, if you trust him then I trust him. Yes.”
“Of course, he’s got a doctor on the payroll.” Tony muttered although Bruce heard it.
Steve held his breath as he waited for Bucky’s reply, “I’m not taking it out on anyone. You’re being ridiculous.”
Didn’t he want this?
Steve couldn’t have Tony in his space and not get closer, it was like finding water in the desert and not running to it. He approached cautiously, not wanting to startle the mechanic who was crouched down, focused on his work.
Tony smiled then, leaning down to give Steve a quick kiss before pulling back. His fingers left Steve’s hand, tugging at the loose bow tie around Steve’s neck until he got the material free.
“Yes.” Tony answered instantly, so sure of himself as those deep brown eyes poured into Steve’s and his hands pushed Steve’s jeans down his legs.
Tony smiled gently, “Mechanic, remember? Injuries are part of the job.”
Steve’s lips moved down, paying particular attention to Tony’s collarbone, licking the dips of his skin before moving further down his chest. Tony stirred, gave a sharp intake of breath but slept on. He was safe, Steve knew, and content with having Steve close to him. Steve stopped when he reached Tony’s stomach, eyes peering up at him gently before shifting down the bed and pulling the sheet down with him as he went.
Rhodey sensed where this story was going, “What did the son of a bitch do?” He was checking Tony for injuries like it was second nature, “I’ll kill him.”
Tony nodded, “We’ve met before actually, he’s given my father a few research grants for the company in the past.”
How long had he been standing there? Long enough to see him meet with Fury, that was for sure.
“Yes, you can.” Steve swallowed dryly, “Touch yourself for me. The way I would touch you. Spread yourself open, nice and wide. You’re going to cum for me, Tony and then I’m going to fuck you, so I need you prepared for me.”
Steve was coming for him.
Tony fluttered his lashes and smirked at him, “I shrunk it in the wash, but I love this t-shirt.” He shrugged, “You don’t like it?”
Steve let out a laugh, “You weren’t complaining a second ago.”
“Because you were trying to survive.”
If it meant they were safe.
Steve lined himself up as Tony brought his legs up again, feeling Steve’s tip pushing against him. Steve slid in slowly, inch by torturous inch as Tony expanded around him until he was fully seated inside of him. Steve barely had time to catch his breath before Tony was wrapping his legs back around Steve’s hips and pressing them together as tightly as possible.
Tony shook his head, “I’d rather work as a mechanic then wake up every morning and question whether I still have a soul.”
He released the dusty bud, dragging his mouth back up towards Tony’s throat, sucking a mark into his skin just above the collarbone. Tony preened, pulling at Steve’s hair and rocking his hips a little bit firmer against Steve’s stomach.
Steve stood there awkwardly, hands in his pockets and an easy smile on his face. Peter slide past him to get to the door, “If you hurt him…”
Steve needed to deal with this and quickly.
“Best wake up call ever.” Tony breathed out, “Definitely need to make that a regular thing.”
Steve sighed, turning around to face his best friend, “I took the night off, I needed to let off some steam.”
Tony played his part perfectly, never pretending to be the doting son but giving Howard a final send off after a cruel ending as a mark of respect for the legacy he left behind. The legacy that now belonged to Tony.
Tony could feel the bile rising in his throat, Rumlow didn’t even look fazed by the threats. It was another day at the office for him, just like it would be for Steve. For a split second, Tony wished Steve was coming for him. He wished he had the protection of a man like that when there was shit like Rumlow roaming the streets.
There was a large dent in the car door on the passenger side, something rusted and flaky against the paintwork.
Tony sighed, he knew this was coming, “Remember that guy I told you about, the one that didn’t work out?”
Steve nodded, “I know who I am and what I’ve done to get here. I’ll live with it but they shouldn’t have to.”
Tony leaned to the side, one hand reaching up to run along Steve’s smooth jawline before bringing his head down for a kiss. Steve obliged, teasing and playfully kissing Tony before rubbing his cheek along his lips for good measure, “I love this too.” Tony said softly, brown eyes warm with affection.
The last guy standing had a gun held in a shaky hand and he had the good sense to raise it as Steve stalked towards him, closing the gap like a hunter approaching his prey.
“It doesn’t mean he returns those feelings.”
Everyone wins but Tony, Steve thought bitterly.
He continued downwards, licking a line from the bottom of Steve’s belly button to the edge of his smart black dress pants. His mouth latched on to the soft skin there, near his hip and Tony worked on sucking a mark against it.
One bullet left. Three guys to go.
“You can’t leave, man.” Sam replied, “The only reason we’d made it through all of this is with your help. You’re part of the family, right Cap?”
Steve couldn’t help the smirk on his face as he reached out to grab Tony and pull him forward. Their mouths met in a teasing dance, Steve’s fingers burning into the fabric at Tony’s hips as he opened up Tony’s mouth and slid his tongue in. Tony’s hands were on his neck, threading into his hair as he tried to get closer, every line of his body melting into Steve’s.
Steve frowned slightly, brows furrowing together as his hands came up to rest of Tony’s waist, “Instinct?” He offered with a small smile.
Natasha was waiting for him at the front door, clearly she had been watching for his arrival. Tony gave her a small wave as he made his way to her. Was this his life now? Meeting with gang members, being an active member. A part of him wondered whether it was smart to accept Natasha’s offer or whether he should have simply walked away when Steve gave him that out. The thought of Steve in a cold grey cell just didn’t sit right with him, Tony knew he couldn’t leave Steve there, not even to save his own skin. It went against everything he knew about survival but here he was, greeting Natasha and slipping into the warmth of Steve’s family home to help a man who didn’t even want him anymore.
Natasha seemed to sense the shift in Tony’s resolve and quickly moved on, “Okay, you get in to see Steve. You disable the cameras. Then what? No way to get you both out of there without Ross issuing a warrant for your arrest as well.”
Rumlow had all the cards and he knew it. Steve had his family and even that wasn’t enough. He couldn’t save them. He couldn’t save any of them.
Thor went right, hammer swinging easily in his hand as he let out a low whistle. He was drawing the enemy to him, Steve knew. Thor always did like an audience when he used his hammer, a taste of what was to come. Steve continued straight ahead, following the corridor as it bent this way and that. Rumlow was here somewhere and Steve knew he wouldn’t be hiding.
“I told you, I don’t want to make weapons. I don’t want to sell weapons. I don’t want any part of your legacy if it gets people killed.” Tony insisted, he was gripping his keys so tightly into his palm that he could feel the metal cutting into his skin.
“Tony…”
As soon as light flooded the room, Steve knew he wouldn’t find Tony anywhere.
Tony shrugged. "I guess? I mean I saw a few kiddie cycles on the way here."
Obie grinned, much to Tony's annoyance and clapped his hands, "Tony, you won't believe what Miss. Bain told me."
The blond bit his lip as Tony walked up to his car. It was one of those flashy sports cars that Steve and Bucky used to drool over when they were teenagers.  He couldn't help but raise an appreciative eyebrow on seeing the four wheeler, although he could not help but wonder how useful it would be for a single father like Tony.
Tony shook his head with a fond smile as he scooped his son into his arms. He aimed his big brown eyes at him, accompanied with a huge pout. Tony chuckled and placed a kiss on the little boy's temple, "Can that wait till we settle in, your Highness?"
Tony stared at him for a moment, wondering if the man had talked about his loss to someone. It didn't seem like he had. Deciding that it was a talk for another day, he quickly changed the topic, "Did I tell you that Peter threw a tantrum because he wanted to join us on the date?"
Steve smiled at his simple request and said, "Bring your sketchpad over."
Steve sighed on seeing the neighborhood kids running away. They had probably sent their ball crashing in through the downstairs window. He already had enough unclaimed balls to start a mini-league. For some unfathomable reason, none of the children had the idea of asking for their balls back.
He choked out a chuckle as Tony pulled away but saved himself of the humiliation by slipping out, "Flattery will only get you so far, Mr. Stark."
Peter turned around the same time that Johnny threw the remote into his lap. Mrs. Storm was glaring at them angrily. She looked almost as angry as his daddy had looked the time he had found out that his babysitter had pinched him.
Tony felt his palms sweat as he walked into the restaurant with Steve. It may have been his anxiety, but it felt like their date night was already taking a big dip. Steve had been silent on their drive, answering Tony's questions with nods or curt answers.
"Don't run!" Steve called after him uselessly and settled back near the table where he and Peter usually worked.
"I know Buck…" He sighed, sliding his fingers under his glass to rub at his eyes.
Steve nodded in understanding. He had dreaded playing around as a child too. It wasn't that he enjoyed playing sports, it was just extremely humiliating when you fell over and had to use your inhaler all the time.
Tony raised a confused look on hearing her words. Why was this grown woman inviting his son to play with her brother?
Slowly, Tony opened the door and let himself inside. He bit his lip on seeing Steve sitting on the edge of his bed, his glasses askew. His newly shaved and smooth skin, blotchy and red from crying.
"Do you?" Steve growled springing up from his chair.
"Steve!" Tony shouted, feeling awkward as his voice reverberated through the empty hall. He waited for a few moments and was almost ready to turn around when he heard a loud crash from above the stairs. Tony had expected many things to happen but what he hadn't expected was to see tumble down the floor.
Shaking his head, Steve walked out of the room, slowly making his way downstairs. The blond stopped to a halt on hearing noises. Pursing his lips he walked over quietly to catch the intruder red handed. Steve blinked on seeing the person sitting inside his living room. He watched silently as the little boy thumbed through the pages of the
He stabbed his thumb into his eyes trying to regain his lost confidence. Shuddering, he slowly started to tuck his shirt inside. Running a hand through his golden mane, Steve wished himself luck one last time before he walked out to Tony.
Steve just rolled his eyes. He wasn't hiding himself. It was just that he no longer had the interest to show himself to people.
He glanced at Bucky who shared his worried look. Sighing, Tony quickly walked back inside, rushing to reach his lover. Tony stopped behind Steve's bedroom door on hearing a sob. He let out a small sigh, poking the pad of his fingers into his eyes.
"Peter, I know after your Papa was gone... I was more of a burden than any help.. Im-"
Steve took his arm away from his face and heaved himself up into a sitting position with a groan as he heard a ping. He searched around for his glasses blinking like a blind owl and reached for his phone. The blond smiled on seeing a message from Tony.
"Hence, the crying." Steve repeated beside him, his voice still hoarse from crying.
"What's up dad?"
Tony turned around to see a lovely young woman standing behind them with a kind smile on her lips. He politely reciprocated her smile, "We just thought we should introduce ourselves. We're new here."
"So, where do you work?"
Peter didn't think his daddy would allow him to watch this. The six-year-old felt a shiver run through his spine as he caught another glimpse of the screen. The man was trying to take off the lady's shirt. Why was he trying to do that? Peter would never try to do that.
He quickly composed himself and crouched down, wrapping his hand over the kid's shoulder blades, "Hey, hey. It's okay, little man. I know you just wanted to get your ball back."
Tony gave him another wink, his thick, dark eyelashes sweeping against his high cheekbones. Steve smiled at him before he remembered with a flinch that they had done the whole performance with Bucky and Natasha as the audience.
Steve turned around upon hearing a sharp voice. He shrugged on seeing a blond boy, maybe a few years older than Peter, glaring daggers at him.
"Can I get my ball?" He asked again. Peter moved closer to the door, it was slightly open. He felt his chest swell with relief on seeing Harry's ball lying near the window in the hall.
Obie stared at him coldly, he said, "You better hope so, Tony. You know SI comes before anything else."
"Bucky" Steve snapped, his heart skipping a beat at the fear of losing Tony because of a lame joke. Tony, however, seemed to take it in spirit. He let out a howl of laughter, "Oh, don't be like that sweetheart,"
"I didn't do it! Peter did!" Johnny cried out without even batting an eyelash. Peter gawked at the older boy, feeling wounded at the utter betrayal. He didn't even want to watch this. He had asked Johnny if they could just watch Power Rangers.
Right. Steve used to be a father. Tony glanced at the photo frame in front of him. The picture was the exact stereotype for a happy young family. Steve had his arms around an attractive brunette with ruby red lips. Both of them were beaming at the camera with an adorable little girl in their arms. The next photo was of a mussy haired sleepy looking Steve giggling happily as his daughter beamed sprawling out on his chest.
The boy was a little ball of energy just like his Mia Rose. He was bouncing on his heels as he threw questions at his father. Steve fondly saw that the father was answering each and every question patiently, his eyes twinkling with love everytime he looked at his son.
"What the hell…" he muttered with a smile and walked over to the table, kneeling down so he was in level with Tony.
"Steve!"
Tony let out a gasp as Steve crashed his lips onto his. The blond cradled his free hand and whispered back,
Peter kicked the dirt and turned around to glance around. There weren't many balls to catch, and Peter was starting to get bored. He walked away to the cracked concrete, smiling as he saw a bellflower. He quickly plucked it out, admiring its beauty. The boy only jolted back on hearing someone scream his name.
Tony flinched, feeling hurt swell in his chest. He let out a hollow laugh, "Humour me here but why would I leave?"
"We sure do, bubba," Tony chuckled.
Steve stood still as Tony walked away, his chest burning with a kind of fire he had never felt. He didn't know if he had been so passionate about someone in his life. Ever. Swallowing the brunt of feelings, he walked inside the house and moved to his bedroom. He flopped onto his bed and let out a cry as something stabbed his back.
"Here you go, bud," He muttered, handing over the book, fighting the urge to take it back. Peter beamed at him and ran off towards his friend. Steve leaned back against the wall and watched with a hollow feeling in his chest as the two boys rushed away bickering with each other.
Steve felt bile surge up his throat, the lighthearted feeling quickly leaving him as he recognized the book. He let out a small croak as his eyes travelled through it's hand painted leaves.
"Have you seen Peter?" He asked Sarah and Natasha, while Clint cried out in the background.
"Come on, Steve. It's family night. Come over," Bucky pleaded, desperation clear in his voice.
"The matter is that since you fled to the suburbs with your little brat, our PR is suffering. People want to see SI's face boy. They want to see you!" The older man snarled, baring his crooked teeth menacingly.
Tony felt his heart skip as his eyes tripped over the piano they had installed in the living room. It had been his mother's moving gift for them. He hadn't played the piano since he was a teenager. Tony had quit playing after he had leaped into the world of science. He had never been brave enough to play a piano since then. The brunet let out a sigh and ran his finger along the keys. Taking a sharp inhale, he pressed on the keys just as Jarvis had taught him all those years ago.
Sighing, he threw his phone on the couch and slipped his fingers under his glasses to rub at his eyes. He sure hoped Tony wouldn't stop talking to him. Since the last few weeks teaching Peter art and talking to Tony every now and then was the only highlight in his joke of a life.
God, he remembered it as if it was yesterday. He had been playing with his lego set when a harried Tony had whisked him away. Pleading for him to just get into the car without asking questions. They had reached the New York Presbyterian to see Natasha sitting in a cold hospital chair with her head in her hands, her dark blue uniform coated with blood and shoulders hunched in complete defeat.
The cafe was a lot more busy than Tony would have liked but it wasn't surprising considering it was lunch time. Tony stole one of the last seats available before he could be whisked away to the waiting room by one of the waitresses.
Tony rose up from his chair, feeling years of resentment swell inside his chest. He wanted to speak now for every time Obadiah had bad mouthed his son, every time he had bad mouthed his lover, every time he had made him feel as if he wouldn't be nothing without his brain. He was slowly starting to realize he had been an idiot to let it all  go thinking that the other man really cared about him and Peter deep inside.
"Maybe I'll invite my new friends over!" Peter said, his eyes twinkling with hope and excitement.
Steve knew Bucky was just trying to protect him like he always did. But he needed to understand that sometimes there wasn't anything he could do. He would never know how Steve felt, unless he went through it and the blond hoped to God, no one would ever have to go through what he did.
"Is this your book, Peter?" Sue came over with a colorful book in her hand. Tony blinked as Peter snatched the book and held it close to his chest. He had never seen the book in his life, and it didn't seem like Sue knew the book either. Strangers were giving his son gifts? Tony felt his heart stutter at the mere thought. He couldn't stop worrying about it as he made his way into their house with Peter in his arms.
Peter nodded, the smile leaving his face to be replaced with a thoughtful look. He craned his neck to glance around the street. "Do you think there will be other kids?"
"Nobody lives here?" Tony interrupted, pointing to the house behind them. The house looked remarkably well kept for a house that was abandoned. The bushes were trimmed, the grass was green and the house was freshly painted without a single chip.
Steve chuckled, feeling his heart swell with fondness as he looked at the indignant six- year-old sitting next to him. He clapped him on the back, "Sure is little man. Anyway I can help?"
Tony grinned, he didn't miss the amused look Sunset sent him or the way Obie's face hardened, a dangerous glint forming in his rheumy grey eyes. Obie started "Boy-"
To his surprise, the older man let out a small purr. He leant over to Steve, batting his eyelashes flirtily before he muttered, "And you look ravishing, Mr. Rogers."
Tony flinched, feeling the hair on his back stand up as Obie pounced onto him, making the paperweight crash down to the floor loudly. The brunet swallowed dryly, "Affirmative."
The brunet glanced up on hearing Steve's voice. He shrugged on seeing that the man was eyeing him carefully, his azure blue eyes tinged with sadness.
"We should probably do this again," Tony added.
Peter quickly climbed up the stairs to meet his father. Peter wished Tony would come down stairs more often. He came down sometimes to play with Joey and talk to MJ and him. But mostly the brunet kept to himself. It really hurt Peter to see his dad who had been larger than life become this shell of a man he used to be.
Steve's eyes met with his own for a moment and to Tony's horror the man flinched like he had been struck across the face. He quickly turned to Natasha for help, she gave him a deadpan look and mouthed
Steve seemed tense even when they sat down, making Tony's insecurities crawl out of their cave. It wasn't like it hadn't crossed his mind before that Steve was an extremely young, handsome and successful man who could have anyone he wanted, while Tony was… He was a forty-year-old single father. He knew he wasn't ugly, but he wasn't the man he was ten years earlier either.
The younger brunet opened his mouth to decline politely but when he glanced into his father's eyes. He faltered. There was a softness and hope to Tony's wrinkled face that he hadn't seen in a long time. Somehow Peter felt that if he declined the offer he would regret it later.
"What you need to understand is that Stark Industries will always come second to me. I don't care if it's my father's blood and sweat--" He waved Obie's words away-- "Peter will always come first. My family will always be my first priority. So, don't expect me to stay silent when you treat him or Steve like dirt."
"Anything for you, beloved," Tony chirped, winking at him.
"Oh no, it went into the ghost house!" Billy cried, fear evident on his face.
Steve nodded, "Me too."
"You're alright
"What's wrong with Steve?" He croaked out.
"Hi," Steve breathed out.
"I'm not judging you Steve. Everybody processes grief differently. I just want you to know that it's okay to look for help. We're here for you. Okay?"
"But that's my brand new ball! Daddy's gonna kill me if I go home without it," Harry told them, his lips wobbling with fear.
Bucky continued to sulk in the corner. Natasha gave him a slap on the back and walked over to hug Tony. Apparently, the redhead had already met him at a community event that the Osborns had hosted. It wasn't even a surprise that he hadn't been invited. Steve had turned down his neighbor's invitations to bond so many times that he was sure that they just pretended he didn't exist now.
Steve almost threw himself out of his chair on hearing a loud crash. He glanced around frantically as his heart pounded against his chest. He had been grading paper sleepily when he had heard the intruding sound. Heaving himself up with great difficulty, he moved over to the window.
The brunet felt his heart clench on seeing Steve's red-rimmed eyes. Tony knew death was an inevitable force of nature, fashioned to balance out the universe. But, having to see your own child getting snatched away by it was the sort of pain that Tony never wanted to experience.
Bucky cursed under his breath colourfully and walked out the door, announcing " Let me go fucking call Erik."
The other man put the book down and glanced up to May and to Tony's deepest shock it was his neighbour, the wanted recluse. He watched with an open mouth as Aunt May chatted with the man, a smile that she usually stored away for Peter adorning her face. Seeing the affection on the old woman's face, anyone who didn't know May would think she was talking to her son.
Finishing a quick lunch of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, Tony and Peter scavenged through their pantry to find something for their neighbors. After finding the tin of expensive cookies Pepper had gifted them earlier, they claimed themselves to be successful and marched outside.
"I'm sorry,  mister. I didn't- Harry- the ball!" He squeaked out painfully, the words turning into sobs. Steve stood dumbstruck as the boy cried, which only made him sob harder.
Peter felt his eyes burn with tears. He knew exactly what Tony was talking about. A few years after Steve passed, Tony had slowly  developed alzheimers. It was fine because Peter was old enough to take care of him. But it was still painful to the day to tell his father every day that Steve had passed away years ago. And it was even more painful to see Tony lose himself every single time he realised the love of his life was no more.
Steve shook his head slowly. Bucky dropped back into his seat, the hope in his face draining quickly. Steve swallowed dryly. He hated disappointing Bucky, but he couldn't bring himself up to do it. None of them understood. Not Bucky, nor Rebecca, nor Mama Barnes. They failed to understand that Steve could no longer be the sunny, bright eyed kid he used to be anymore.
Tony was about to ring the bell again when another voice interrupted them, "You probably shouldn't waste your time."
"What's wrong?" Tony asked him warily.
Steve gently opened his hand and offered him a piece of paper. Tony glanced up at him confused. The blond gave him a nervous smile and muttered, "Open it."
Some of his students were even passionate about the subject. He still remembered the day Kamala wrote extra pages for her essay; the girl had even added extra information she had procured from field research. It was one of the proudest days of Steve's short life as a teacher.
"Steve, Steve… sweetheart…" Tony pried the other man away from and took his face in his hand, gently pushing the blond locks away from his eyes.
"Steve. I know what you went through. I--."
"Yep." Tony confirmed.
The woman flashed a grin at him, showcasing all of her pearly whites and dropped down to the chair next to him gracefully. She extended her hand, "Sunset Bain. I'm sure you must have heard of Baintronics."
"Yeah, Peter doesn't do well with new people."
The genius hid a smile on seeing the fear on Rhdoey's fear.  He didn't have anything to fear according to Tony. He had stolen a glance at the drawing Peter had made last week titled
Tony shook his head, dismissing the thought quickly. If he had just wanted to sow some wild oats he wouldn't have spent time getting acquainted with his son. He wouldn't have set aside his precious time to babysit Peter. He wouldn't keep telling him that he and Peter were the biggest blessing in his life.
"Dad, you called?" He asked, poking his head inside.
“Tony... why are you with him?”
. Steve thought. Sitting upright in his chair to at least try and pretend he was more engaged.
Steve sighed, peering around the overly purple and yellow kitchen and swiping the condensation off of his beer bottle with his thumb.
There was a high in the air when the couple of them arrived back to Tony’s apartment, dancing through the streets hand in hand, it felt impossibly magical.  There was something undeniably beautiful about watching Tony unwind when he was away from everyone else, and Steve must have accidentally thought out loud because Tony was looking at him with a crooked grin while his jeans were halfway down his knees.
“Yeah.” Tony replied immediately. “Just, you know, you and your ex, seeing you together, that didn’t make me nervous if that’s what you’re asking. That is what you’re asking isn’t it?” He was talking very fast.
In the humid of the apartment, he could feel Tonys breath on his skin, on his lips, it was hot, his lips were parted - so plump and pink. Steve knew he was staring, but it was okay.
He caught a glimpse of the skin below Tony’s chin as he grazed past him, as tentative as the night he first touched him, his body slightly shy around him, unwilling to release the tension in his muscles. The way his dark hair curled behind his ears, all too familiar and all too lovely for him. He walked away and didn’t look back, not that he was expecting him too, leaving Steve to stand there with nothing, only to admire the curls behind his ears.
Steve wasn’t sure of what to say. Or do. All of his senses probably stopped ‘sensing’ as his brain failed to communicate with the rest of his body,
“If it’s any consolation…” Steve began. “I think she really, really likes you, Buck.”
All of their friends had, ultimately, unfollowed Ty after the incident. But Steve (using the self-told excuse that he
He didn’t really remember his father. He tried to, and his mother would always show him photos and talk about how brave and sometimes prideful he was. The problem was that, because he grew up without his father, he had nothing to compare him to, nothing to be grateful for or nothing to be resentful toward. But he missed his mom. Whenever Tony talked about his mom, he always sounded like he was describing the world, rich in life and beautiful, aged now but full of love and knowledge if you went looking for it. Steve always listened more intently than Tony thought he was, because he missed that feeling of having someone who loved you relentlessly and unconditionally, and that you would love the same way.
“Stop with the questions! Ugh. No, no, no, yes, no, no. So it’s never going to happen. He made that… as clear as anything.”
“I almost died.”
Steve was glad to know he still had his family.
“Good thing I’m not trying to impress you then isn’t it?”
“Yeah, who, then?”
It made his blood boil.
. “Well I’m no expert. But -“
Silent. Steve was silent. Tony had told him practically everything he’d ever wanted to hear and he couldn’t utter a word, just staring at him wide eyed listening to the rapid beating of his and his own heart.
“No – I’m serious.”
“Tonys fine. I don’t like or dislike Tony. He’s okay. He’s a little obnoxious, talks a lot. He’s okay. Can’t you just do it later?”
“Steve. Tell us about yourself.” Natasha tilted her head, hair falling over her shoulder and slinking over her fishnet shirt as she did.
“Tony.” Steve just said simply, getting a half-hearted glare back.
“Well, we aren’t together so what does it matter.” His voice became distant, his eyes roaming over open and proud couples as he sipped from his glass of water.
“I thought you said you weren’t very punk rock?”
Taking a deep breath, trying not to be too obvious of his own anxiety, he looked down at Tonys wide, dark, expectant eyes, and down his neck. There was traces of bruises under his jaw, yellow stains marking him as someone else’s and a chain looped around his neck, a small ‘O’ at the base of his adam’s apple - somewhat disturbing under the circumstances.
“Hey, hey guy -“ Steve wavered the man in the truck over, seeing concern and confusion show on his face, he felt kind of bad for him. “He has a problem - problems with his lungs. I need a hand, you know, help?”
“Hmmm… Well, I’ve always wanted to go to D.C...”
“But…” His increasingly drunk mouth wandered. “It feels so good to let it go.” Thinking back to the woods, giving it up, all of himself, all of his control and restraint. All for him. Only for him.
“At-least that’s only sometimes - and you don’t know how much of a sucker I am for backhanded compliments.” Twirling around Steve but making sure to leave a sizeable distance after his reaction to the contact. Worry immediately set in him, would Tony avoid any physically contact with him altogether just because of a flinch? It seemed excessive, but he could see it through Tony’s seemingly casual exterior.
But he woke up alone.
. Tony was looking up at him, and he was looking back, pressing his thumb against his lip as he swiped it across. His finger tugged on his lip as he pulled. If anyone saw them, they’d probably be as confused as Tony looked, perplexed squinting and scattered breaths.
don’t tell anyone about that.”
“I don’t know, shut up. Maybe I don’t wanna be mean to you.”
“Yes. For real.” Tony repeated, looking more serious.
- he reminded himself.
for me, so.” Even Tony seemed to notice it. “But… Um… I wouldn’t say no to the movies or, whatever.”
Tony looked up at him, those big glowing eyes seemed to burn into Steve’s skin even fiercer in the light, his smile which was a delight to see, he’d missed it.
Steve decided that he liked rock music.
“But then you might not have gotten this grant.” He smiled. “Yeah, I, uh… I think I understand that now. Thank you, Sharon. Really.”
They fell asleep there, Tony’s head on his chest, messy hair entwined with a coupe stray leaves and dirt, the two of them barely clothed under a make-shift blanket made out of shirts, sweaters and pants.  It was the most contenting, and destructive thing he’d ever done.
“No. Why would I want to do that?” The way Tony looked into him with his intrusively interrogating dark brown eyes made him hot in his sweater, the way his shoulder grazed into his chest as he walked past him not helping. “Do you ever think about what people would say about you if you went missing?”
“Nice one. No, no I haven’t.”
“Fine.” He finally managed. “A little cold never bothered me.”
Neither of them knew if they’d really end up going through with it, whether they were just high off each other and making stupid decisions. Steve asked Tony what about his friends and he said:
“That’s Rhodey, and no, I promise that nickname has nothing to do with him being in a band.”
There was a silence, Steve accidentally shared some shifty eye contact with Thor and averted his gaze to the top of Buckys head. He needed to wash his hair.
Sounds of rustling and bumping began from behind the door, causing everyone to fall out, sharing concerned looks - as though they had any right to it, all looking guilty above anything.
Tearing the headphone jack out and playing some music from his phone, vowing to try and get him out of this Tony shaped hole he’d dug himself into.
Not this time.
“Oh, hi.” Steve smiled back, a little surprised at her presence and how overall calm she was about seeing him.
Everything.
being an addict. Did you stop having an eating disorder?”
He smirked in a monotonous tone, and then looked over to a plush seat in the corner of the room where a slender boy with dark brown curls sat alone, but not unhappily. Steve noticed that Tony was very forthright, maybe he just didn’t care about being too personal, or too impersonal, or he just didn’t know any better, his sarcasm did just as intended, make people uncomfortable or distracted them from what he was truly thinking - his eyes seemed to tell a different story to his lips.
“I really fucking love game shows. Like, The Price Is Right, Match Game, Pyramid. My all time favourite is Jeopardy. Trebek is the coolest guy in the world and I wanna meet him.”
“Hell yes!”
No amount of Steve’s
Maybe it was because the commentator had called the bands name out, so they all had to get on stage. He watched him while he sat behind the drums, obviously pretending like he had as much to set up as Rhodey, Clint and Natasha, a blank, oddly neutral face.
“I really don’t like whatever music you like.”
“O- Stop.” Nervous laughter creeped out of him again. “But you were good...”
- He really was.
“There’s no better way to get to know me than this.”
“Well thank you.” Then he pointed to Steves fist with the end of his cigarette. “Who are they for? Promise I won’t tell.”
“No.” Tony replied, with complete certainty. “I don’t think he’d very much like me anyway. Hasn’t exactly done me any favours. Hello Brian.”
“Well, we sleep two feet apart so it would be kind of hard not to.” He smiled.
He looked at her with a clenched jaw. Tense. Nervous. He looked as though he might burst into tears at any moment. But he didn’t.
“Oh yeah it’s not my business, not like you two are… Making out for anyone to walk in and see. Like,
“I know so. I think you’re both scared but you really like each other so just… go for it. Sorry, I’m really in no position to be giving you advice right now.”
Steve looked to see Bucky and Nat leaving the kitchen, they were laughing, she reached up and stroked her fingers through his hair as they  walked, their inaudible conversation filling him with warmth, and dread. If he wanted to be with someone - a boy - or flirt with - a boy - he couldn’t be like that, not in public public, people would look down on it, perhaps that’s why he felt so comfortably uncomfortable around Tony and his friends, because they didn’t seem to care when Tony and Ty practically groped one another so casually. But Steve cared, about that, but not because it grossed him out.
“We’re getting there. You know, we have a lot more in common than you think.” He leaned in as if he needed to be quiet, but the music must’ve muted him to the others anyway, glancing over to her and Bruce, having a less enthusiastic conversation seemingly. “What’s that you’re drinking? That’s a disaster cocktail.”
“So…”
“I’ve never tried it.”
“Oh.”
“Classy.” Ty directed at Rhodey more than anyone for some reason.
“No I don’t.” He replied snappily. Which was proceeded by a blush.
They were alike in that way, Tony and Natasha, wearing unreadable expressions as they both prepared for whatever was about to happen.
“Tony. Time to start boxing everything up.”
She chuckled, well, it was more like a passive “HmHm” behind her closed mouth, which was just at the right time for Steve’s name to be called and he could pick up his latte. Tony drank his black, but Steve hadn’t developed the taste for that just yet.
