“Until next time, Steve Rogers,” Tony murmured, placing one last kiss to his mouth and then lingering, just for a moment, until finally turning around. He glanced over the window and waved, and Steve saw his friends stare back, open-mouthed.
But it was already going, losing its centre of balance and toppling. It was headed right in Tony’s direction, and even if the man moved right now there would be a chance it’d hit him. Steve didn’t know how many volts were running through it, but he figured it would be enough to do damage. Potentially a lot of it. Which, obviously, Steve was not going to let happen.
Steve dived to the left, avoiding a shot and then stabbing the razor-corner of his shield into the body that had been charging toward the both of them. “Maybe try dancing off with him,” he quipped through a feral grin, “you said that worked last time.”
“Uh-“ Tony blinked, opening and shutting his mouth, “well, I didn’t really… I was sort of preoccupied, Steve-“
“What? Then why the hell do you always change the subject or get distracted or leave whenever I try-“ Steve made a wavy gesture with his hands, “-y’know, going further?”
“Hey Tony,” he said as the other boy was about to call off, “I, uh… I really love you. Like. A lot.”
“You should invest in a personal helper,” Steve said, getting to his feet with a sigh as Tony smiled at him, “or robots. You can make those, right? You created JARVIS,” he reached over and snagged the tool from the desk, before turning back around and tapping Tony over the back of the head with it.
“Yeah, you’re going to the hospital,” Tony nodded slowly and then pulled out his phone. “It’s fifteen minutes away. I’ll drive.”
So much had been lost that he wasn’t even sure he could feel anything any more. It was all just… empty.
Steve just choked a little bit, nodding. Like this, he could see where Tony got his reputation from. He knew this game. He had Steve pinned up against the door, kissing him within an inch of his life like it was the simplest thing to do in the world, cocky grin on his face as his hands curled firmly around the back of Steve's thighs. At this, there was no doubt- Tony Stark was a pro.
“Tony?” Steve asked, and he blinked, pulling himself out of his own head as he smiled and chucked the little sleepsuit in Steve’s direction.
"You think I'm fucking around?" Tony took another step forward and the crowd followed, desperate for a fight, "stay away. That's all I'm gonna say. If I hear another story from him about y-"
Tony ground his teeth at Rhodey’s purposeful obtuseness and resisted the urge to say something along the lines of
It had been two weeks since their last session together. He knew that she kept him on close watch, and last time they’d spoken, they’d been talking about some pretty serious stuff. His social worker was coming around in a few weeks to check up on him and see how he was settling into his new place, so she’d been doing the usual evaluation shit. Steve didn’t think it helped much, personally, but people always told him it did, so he was sticking it out for now.
They drove over to SHIELD in silence; Natasha simply staring straight ahead of her, face blank, mind clearly working over everything Steve had told her and processing every bit of information. Steve didn’t try and converse with her. There was nothing else to say. He’d told her, she’d agreed to come to SHIELD with him. The ball was in her park now.
Beside him, Steve stilled, and Tony pressed the phone to his ear while Clint started to speak. “You gotta get back to the tower right now, both of you,” he said, before adding on to the end, “it’s Peter.”
Steve just clenched his jaw. “Not enough, obviously. Still beat my ass. Tony said he would find ‘em, but… I don’t know if he will, now.” He couldn’t help but throw Bucky a slightly bitter look at that. Goddamn idiot had put his foot in it as always, and ruined everything with Tony. Not to mention the chance of him finding the fuckers that took his stuff.
And now there was that God-awful video to contest with, too. They’d been working all day, but they still hadn’t found a source. It was fucking infuriating- the person responsible deserved to be brought to justice over it. Doing something like that was completely sick— and dear god, Tony had looked so young in the video, too, Steve wasn’t even sure whether he’d been legal at the time. The thought made him shudder violently. If it felt bad for him, God only knew how Tony was dealing with it.
Steve wiped the tears from his eyes and willed himself to stop shaking, instead reaching out blindly for Tony, draping his body across the back of the other man and wrapping his hands around Tony’s waist. He breathed, and breathed, and breathed again, trying to ground himself to where he was. What he now knew, with absolute certainty. He wasn't sure why and he didn't know how, but he was sure of it all the same.
Steve didn’t really know. They lived wildly different lives. “My mom would’a killed me if I’d missed school like that.”
“Good,” he answered swiftly, “you’re cleverer than he’ll ever be, anyway. If anyone can do it, it's you.”
“Why’d you come get me,” Tony asked as he slipped into the inconspicuous black car Steve had driven up in.
“What happened with Obadiah?” He asked in order to try and steer away from the dangerous emotions that were coming up to the surface, “I never—I never asked.” He remembered, vaguely, that Tony had been dealing with issues at work back then, but he’d been away so much that he’d never really talked about it. And by the way Tony’s face fell, it clearly wasn’t good.
Someone strong grabbed his arms and yanked him back, and he struggled against the grip. “Get off me!” He screamed, kicking out wildly, “get the fuck off me!”
“Sir, if the Captain really has done this much damage, then there is a chance that something has happened which prevents him from even knowing the difference between you and HYDRA—”
Mrs Wilson looked over to him, glancing down at her phone and seeing Tony’s contact. Her lips pursed, just a little. “So I take it that Tony boy was involved too?” She asked.
“I’m not- I’m not ‘going for him’,” Steve rolled his eyes and tried not to blush. Bucky wasn’t wrong- getting caught up in something like that would be like walking out into a hurricane- “I was just interested. And now I know, see? The cat is satisfied, and is not going to dig any further.”
He didn’t watch Steve shut his eyes and choke back on a sob, whispering the same words, over and over again.
Before he was even aware that he was moving, his feet were flying through the workshop and running over to the main conference room where he knew at least a few of the Avengers must be. He needed them all to see this, just so he could confirm that he hadn’t actually gone insane. Of course, most of them were in there, as they always were, still trying to bring some order to a world that had fallen into total chaos. He could see Carol and Thor standing together through the glass windows, pointing at a holographic image while they talked to the rest of the team. Carol clocked him first, her brow creasing in confusion just for a second before Steve hurtled through the doors so hard that it came straight off its hinges. He grabbed it hastily before it could hurt anyone and rested it back against the wall before slamming the disused helmet onto the table, its beep emanating through the room.
And honestly, no, Steve didn’t- he had the feeling those huge blue eyes could tear Steve’s entire heart out if used for evil purposes. So in the end, he just huffed loudly and marched past Tony, chin high and resolutely facing the stairs, rather than Tony’s giggling face. “Let’s go then, ass.”
“You’ve been under the influence of a foreign mind control,” she explained, leaning forward and pursing her lips, “Bruce worked it out yesterday and told us as soon as he could. There was a… a device, used by the race of aliens who’d tried to launch an attack on Earth a few weeks ago, you remember? We’re not sure of the specifics yet, but you were the one who initially pulled it out of the ship’s hull after Tony told us it would break the psychic link between the armies. We think… we think that something must have happened to link you and the device before it was shut off.” She bit her lip and looked him in the eye sombrely. “How much do you remember, Steve?”
“Four bars, promise,” he said, “I’ve got our bags packed and ready, we can go whenever you say the word.”
Ty flailed, grabbing Steve’s throat and squeezing. He barely even felt it, yanking himself out of the grip and then ducking in, using his height to strike a blow straight into Ty’s kidneys. Someone tugged him backward—Ty’s friend, he assumed—and a fist landed in his face, sending his vision spinning. Steve turned to them, ready to hit them too, but then suddenly there was a blur of green jacket and curly brown hair, and the boy went sprawling, one furious Bruce Banner straddling his midsection. Steve saw his friend’s face; teeth bared, such a look of intense rage on his face that Steve almost felt sorry for the guy underneath him. Almost.
Tony looked behind him to his friend and raised an eyebrow. “Better hope Principal Fury hasn’t got his eye on the parking lot when you roll up with Steve.”
With a sigh, he palmed a hand across his face and then opened up his phone. He was bored and tired and lonely, and as much as the little gremlin in his brain told him to shut himself off from the world and deal with all his shit alone, the other voice- the one that sounded suspiciously like his boyfriend- was louder, and it told him to do… well, the opposite.
“Wha’ddya lookin’ at,” Steve asked, eyes still on the road as a small smile cracked his lips. Tony just leaned back in his seat, popping a chip into his mouth and raising his eyebrows.
The man sighed, pulling Tony into his arms and rolling his knees up so they were pressed against the back of Tony’s own. His nosed along Tony’s spine, kissing his shoulder. “Okay, maybe you do. But don’t you think it’ll be easier to deal with when you’re not running on half an hour of sleep and the adrenaline sourced from a day of panic-attacks?”
“Okay, okay, sorry,” he muttered, placing a placating kiss against the nearby skin, “but seriously—there a reason? Not that there has to be. M’just curious.”
He took a taxi home, unwilling to risk driving through New York while he was so tired. The guy tried to chat with him, and Tony could admit he was probably less than polite to the poor driver, but he gave him a hundred-dollar tip when he stepped out back home twenty minutes later, so he figured they were even.
Later that night, long after Peter had drifted off to sleep and the rest of the team had parted ways to their own quarters, Steve and Tony lay together in bed, curled into one another and talking idly as they waited for the lethargy to take hold. This was secretly the favourite part of Tony’s day. That bit, right at the end, when it was just them. When they whispered overly truthful things to one another in the almost-asleep haze of night, fingers running feather-soft over the familiar divots and muscles. When Steve’s voice started to croak with over-use, and all that Tony could see of him was the fuzzy silhouette, the occasional glisten as the last few particles of light hit those blue eyes of his. It was like nothing else in the world, in the universe, even existed in those moments. This was just him and Steve, his whole existence narrowed down to the face two inches away from his.
“Hey Tony,” Steve said, turning to the other boy with a smile, “I think you should have that arm-wrestle with Sam now. I’m feeling in the mood to watch him get shown up.”
“Yeah,” she told them, “I, uh- don’t have an excuse. I just don’t want to have him in my room tonight.” And then she turned tail and swiftly walked away, not looking behind her as she hopped into the elevator. Tony and Steve looked at one another, faces creasing.
Steve nodded, falling into step with Tony and remaining silent through the walk down. His gaze was sharp, lost deep in thought, and Tony knew he was doing the same. Peter’s little trick had just changed everything, although the baby was completely oblivious to it. They couldn’t just hand him over to any normal old social services now, could they? It was… different, when a kid had powers like that. Tony hadn’t been lying about the horror stories- some parents brought them home just so they could try and train it out of them, or put them up for illegal fighting rings, or do God knows what. Of course, that was if he even ended up getting adopted at all. Sure, babies were the most popular choice amongst adoptive parents, but a baby that was enhanced? Those very rarely even got considered. People didn’t want to deal with the hassle.
“Well, you’ve done your part now, haven’t you agent Rogers?” He asked. “You got on your knees for him just like Fury asked, and the rest was easy. Now let the
Steve didn’t budge. “I am quite frankly so far away from bothered by that fact. You’re exhausted, and seeing as you woke me up at some goddamn ridiculous hour, I am too.”
Cass stepped forward again, but this time instead of continuing the fight, he passed Tony completely, nodding over to someone behind him. Tony looked, watching as the fifth and final Enhanced rounded the corner and sprinted straight past all of them. He got back to his feet and raised the repulsors, knowing that he no longer had his targeting system thanks to the lack of helmet, but figuring he was a good enough shot to get a hit nonetheless. Now they were getting further away, firing shots would be easier. As cool as Iron Man was, he tended to work far better in open space.
This pause was long, stagnant. Steve told his arm to extend, stretch out, grab one of his sweaters from the closet. The arm managed to perform the task almost perfectly.
“I’m not going anywhere,” Tony told him smoothly, fingers stroking Steve’s floppy hair out of his face, “I’m sorry I said those things and then left you to stew over them. I should have been more considerate. I know today was hard. It’s okay now though, Steve, I promise, I’m fine.”
Tony stared at him, mouth falling open as Steve hummed something Tony had never heard before, with words that sounded like complete gibberish. Tony knew a lot of languages, but never in his life had he come across anything like what Steve was saying. His voice was soft and wavering, not particularly great, but he could carry a tune.
“In two seconds, you’re not gonna be far behind him, Cap.” Natasha stuck her finger up at him, but after a second of Steve staring her down, she sullenly got into position. “Thor?”
planning something.” Steve grinned smugly, because he may have been the paragon of virtue and icon of America when he was on the clock, but off-duty he was nothing more than an irritating asshole.
Stark said, already thinking ahead, up to the next crisis. Steve had to admire him for that. It must be completely fucking exhausting, always preparing for another catastrophe. He wasn’t even sure if Tony could help it. It was just who he was. A futurist.
The haze of unhappiness lingered around him as he dragged himself through his night-time routine, reminded of Peter’s presence at pretty much every turn. It was amazing how much stuff they’d managed to accumulate over such a short period of time, really. Toys and clothes and little shoes just sprayed liberally over what had used to just be Steve and Tony’s room. Everything had been ordered and neat and adult. This was a mess.
The next message he got was just a close-up of Nat’s middle finger, and he rolled his eyes fondly. Hey, at least they amused themselves. He didn’t particularly fancy third wheeling on them though, thinking about it- those two were notoriously bad at reigning in their PDA.
“Don’t even bother,” Steve spat, “God, I feel fucking humiliated. Can’t you just stick to one person in your relationship, Tony? Is it that hard?”
, the voice in his head shouted, but he swallowed that down too, shoved it under his ribcage where it couldn’t escape. He was looking at a fanatic, a murderer. He was looking at a man who’d killed and stolen and burned buildings to the ground for his own agendas.
“JARVIS, eject.” Steve’s voice was loud in Tony’s ears, jarring. His hands vanished, and Tony felt the constraints of the armour peel away from his back, his chest, his arms. Hands grabbed him, yanked him down the corridor. Someone was shouting ‘RUN’. It sounded like Natasha.
But he didn’t live with his mom. And he couldn’t extend an invitation to a place that didn’t even belong to his name.
One that was made infinitely worse by the knowledge that his best friend had been the one to kill Tony’s parents.
“Steve… he did not,” Natasha commented, a little of her Russian lilt slipping into her voice as she spoke. Her eyes were glued with a wild intensity to the TV screen, where what looked to be a Spanish version of Peppa Pig was playing. “Kept asking for you. Mаленький ребенок.”
The boy hovered awkwardly for a moment, and Steve looked at him hard; too thin and too bitter and too old for what he should have been. Just another causality of reality. Thor opened his mouth, the first syllables of his brother’s name falling off his tongue, but Loki decided at that moment that he had said too much, because he did what he always did best, apparently, and marched out of the room without looking back.
With a roll of his eyes and groan, Tony dropped the tweezers and stuck his head out of the door. “If this is just your way of trying to coerce me into helping you, then you’re shit outta lu-
Tony had been busying himself with picking at a thread on the bedsheet, but when Steve finished, he paused and looked up. Swallowed. “Steve,” he said gently, “you’re… I don’t think you’re gonna be able to just walk out of those doors, you know.”
But Tony’s brain was fast; it was his goddamn curse sometimes, but it meant he could connect dots pretty quickly, and in the space of a few seconds he was meticulously breaking down all the events over the past few weeks, working out the source, finding the root of the problem in the same space of time as it would take a person to click their fingers.
She sighed a bit, but her smile was genuine when she turned to him. “He’s better when he’s with you, you know.”
Tony turned slowly to him, watching Thor grab a loaf of bread and then pull out a handful of slices, starting to chew on them absently. Tony briefly took a moment to process the fact that he was watching a Norse God who was wearing nothing except his underwear as he ate plain slices of bread and held a small superhuman baby in one meaty arm. It was certainly not a statement he’d ever thought he’d be making. “Thor, are you trying to tell me that you speak Baby now?”
Tony winked and then slipped off- and a second later Steve watched the door at the front of class open, Tony’s head poking out. A few of the kids looked up, but he shot them all a sharp look and put a finger to his lips, and they quickly put their heads back down again. Steve just leaned back in his chair and folded his arms, watching the idiot as he looked at the teacher in the other corner and then quickly slipped in as inconspicuously as possible.
“That’s the goal, Precious,” he winked and then posed briefly, watching the way Steve’s eyebrows rose in appreciation. “Don’t worry though, you’re the only one that gets to taste.”
“I’m gonna be good for you too, you know,” he mumbled sleepily, pressing his lips into Tony’s shoulder, “promise.”
After a final round of call, Steve spotted him. Knelt in the snow, someone else tucked up in his arms. Her red hair was covered with snow, and Steve felt his heart drop. He lowered his gun and raced forward, calling out their names. Rhodey saw him and instinctively raised his own weapon a fraction before he recognised Steve. “Oh thank God,” the man said, “took you long enough.”
With the grace of a ballet dancer, Tony watched as Steve slid into the driver’s seat and pouted, thinking it over for a second. “All parents are like that in the beginning,” he settled with, shrugging his shoulders, “we’re no different.”
Everyone nodded. It was a sound call, and Thor promptly followed the order, signing off in order to instead get in touch with the other two men. The thought of leaving Peter alone when half the city appeared to be under siege was not something that sat well with Tony at all, but he knew that they needed all hands on deck if it was AIM
“Not until later,” Tony waved a hand nonchalantly, “and it was only because he walked in and smelt it. By that time, I was long gone, and I’d wiped any evidence of Pepper being there from the scene of the crime at all, so-“
“There’s your chance,” Steve whispered into his hair, smug, “leave if you want. But you won’t. I know you won’t. So don’t lie to me, Tony, because I don’t appreciate it.”
He saw Captain Marvel rushing toward the van as fast as she could and prayed she’d make it, certain that nothing on heaven or earth could stop her travel. And he was right; no one could catch her. But Thanos was smart, and not ready to give up. With a howl of rage and fury, the Titan hurled his massive weapon across the sky, and Steve could only watch on helplessly from afar as the van exploded into a thousand fragments; the portal into the quantum realm completely annihilated.
“You’re really… you’re sure?” He croaked in the end, finally turning his gaze back to Steve and eyeing him almost warily. “Steve, I know… are you really certain you want your first time to be with m-“
“HEADS UP!” Came a shout as soon as the elevator doors opened to let the two of them into the penthouse, and Steve blinked in surprise, watching a whole box of cereal fly across the kitchen and land in Thor’s lap. Thor gave Clint a thumbs up in thanks, and then dug his hand inside, taking a large handful of Honey-Nut Cheerios and pushing them all into his mouth. Natasha, who was curled up on the kitchen counter like a kitten and scrolling through her phone, caught sight of the two of them first. Her smile was warm.
The video cut off, and Tony shut his eyes tightly, taking a few steadying breaths. He made the decision right there and then that he was going to torch that entire fucking facility to the ground. How sick… how
Steve watched him hurry off suddenly, and pressed his tongue to the roof of his mouth as he reeled back the small question in the back of his mind as to why he wanted to get rid of them so badly. Before they’d been dating he’d seen Tony walk around with what was quite frankly way worse covering his neck.
he’d heard her say that to him many times, before. He knows she asked for it there just for his benefit. There was more to it, though- more to the saying she’d whispered to him on his bad days, when he’d been too sick to stand and too sad to care.
“Tony,” Steve reached forward and took the hand that Tony was fisting into his own hair, gently prying off the fingers before he could hurt himself, “Tony, sweetheart, calm down. Just breathe. It’s okay now. It’s done. Everything is fine.”
Once in Steve’s room, it seemed Steve lost all energy he had been clinging on to, because he pretty much collapsed on to the bed, lying spread-eagle across it, face buried in the pillows.
Running a hand through his hair, he lost himself in the doodles for a while. Just rough sketches- Bucky and Natasha curled around one another,  the Icecream parlour Steve had taken Tony to that one time, the view out of his window. They weren’t any good, of course- he never really had been, but it still soothed him anyway. It was nice to let his emotions flow out from his head into his fingers, shaky and rough and his.
Steve woke slowly, as he always did. His hands had torn the sheets in half easily. He could taste the blood at the back of his throat.
There was a moment where Bucky hovered on the other side, but after a few seconds it seemed he’d finished giving himself a pep-talk because Steve heard his hand go to the lock. When he pulled open the door, Steve glared at him.
you sack of shit, if you’ve hurt him to get information, if you’ve touched a hair on his head, I’m gonna
. It wasn’t fair, and it wasn’t pleasant, but whatever feelings Steve had on the matter weren’t important. Tony had become someone Steve no longer knew. He couldn’t stand by and let him get away with this.
“Just… just smile. I really need to see you smile right now,” Steve told him, his voice horribly fragile in the quiet room.
was irrelevant. So was the rest of the team. He’d survived plenty of these days before they’d come along, and he’d damn well do the same now.
But there was a jacket in his laundry basket covered in Tony’s blood. His DNA was under Steve’s fingernails, from where his hands had pressed hopelessly into the hole in his lover’s head. He couldn’t look down at them, because it would make him vomit. Nothing else mattered except those facts; the simple things that made up a bleak, dark picture of what life was going to become for him. Nauseating. Horrific. Susan Storm could be terrified of him, and she could try and kill him if she wished, and Steve wouldn’t care, because this whole world was wrong now, and so Steve needed to set it right, using whatever force necessary. At some point during sitting in the bathroom and walking out of the door of the tower, he had irreversibly made up his mind. He would not stop now.
Tony rolled his eyes and opened his mouth, undoubtedly to brush it off, but Steve didn’t let him. “You pulled me out of my office and you put me on a plane and told me to trust you. Then you took me to see Niagara Falls.” He smiled at the memory and watched Tony do the same in front of him, both of them remembering the cool spray from the truly beautiful view and the way they’d held one another as they stared at the sight for what seemed like eternity. It was a day that Steve knew he’d never forget, and had made him happier than he’d ever been able to expect, especially considering the week he’d had.
Tony’s eyes went huge, and his breath stuttered to a complete halt halfway through his drag. With a focused intensity, Steve raised a hand and plucked the cigarette out of his mouth slowly, then placed his other hand against Tony’s jaw, tilting his head upward.
“Tony,” Natasha’s voice called out to him, and he felt his leg as it was shifted again, the tearing sound of a blade cutting through the material of his trousers. The pain was fading now, which was probably not a good sign at all, because that meant he was already losing consciousness. “Tony, bite down on this.” She held a leather belt—Rhodey’s, probably—to his mouth, and Tony took it between his teeth dutifully.
Steve could feel himself smiling adoringly over at him, but he didn’t even care. Not even when Bucky smacked him across the back of the head and called him a sap.
“I know where to find you,” Steve finished with a small smile, nodding his head. “Yeah, I know Sam. Thank you.”
Steve noticed Tony’s breath catching every time his fingers brushed against his face. He didn’t say anything, though. Just tucked it away and saved it like it was precious.
- he comes home, I know that he won’t bother telling me where he’s been, or apologising for any of it. He thinks I only care because it’s what my parents asked me to do.” Thor grimaced, wiping a hurried hand across his face and then turning to Steve. “Truth is, if I called them right now and told them Loki was dead, they’d wait until their precious business deal had gone through before coming home. It was never
Those thoughts only remained on his mind for the first few minutes of arriving. Being the Director of an organisation like SHIELD meant you tended not to be able to dwell on one particular thing at once- not when there would undoubtedly be at least five crises happening at any moment, somewhere in the damn world. He considered briefly about taking a vacation. The Maldives, maybe. Maria had been there once. She had said they were very serene.
Steve considered it, glancing once more over to the cows. “Yeah, actually-- you know what, I think I can manage,” he agreed hastily in the end, winding his hands around Tony’s neck so he could pull him back down with a laugh and a happy sigh.
with fury as he hurdled the couch like it wasn’t even there. Tony yelled and took off after him, but he knew it would be no use- Steve was faster and stronger than him anyway.
“Thank you, Steve,” she said earnestly, which just confused him even further, “that… tells us a lot, actually. We didn’t mean to offend you, but we wanted to check.” Her face fell a little, revealing something harder when she added: “People tend to have ulterior motives when it comes to Tony. We’re almost all he has- we have to look out for him.”
In answer, Steve threw down a letter Natasha had written up earlier at her apartment. “That’s a letter from Tony Stark’s lawyer,” he said sharply, for once in his life the lies falling easily off his tongue, “you know—one of the eleven that he has on his roster, with more successful cases between them than the rest of all US attorneys combined? We don’t know how Stark managed to get a message through to them, but he did, and now they’re demanding we allow them to represent him unless we want them suing us for breaching about a dozen different human rights laws. We’ve got mere hours to get a confession out of him before they can arrive and run rings round us. So I suggest you let me through, unless you want the downfall of SHIELD itself to be on your conscience.”
Their legs were touching as they both sat, and as Tony gradually became more comfortable and sunk lower into the cushions, more and more of him ended up pressed into Steve. By the end of the movie, their legs were tangled together, with Tony leaning almost subconsciously into Steve’s side; one arm propped on the back of the couch and the other twirling a breadstick between his fingers.
“If you say so,” Steve shrugged, following Tony as he walked out of the door. In the kitchen they saw Sam busy making dinner, and he and Tony said their goodbyes to one another happily, with Sam promising to return the favor of homework help whenever he needed it. Tony smiled genuinely, like there would ever be a moment in which he would ever need homework help, and then turned to the front door.
There were some snorts from the group of people, and Ty rolled his eyes, stepping forward to pat Thor on the shoulder fondly. Steve wondered if he caught the look of disdain cross Thor’s face as he did so. “Oh God, you need to relax about the smoking thing. Your brother was telling me all about what a nag you were just this morning. Honestly, I think a cigarette now and then would be good for you, buddy.”
he shrugged. “Eh- it was okay. Boring, as usual; they gave us a test, I aced it, again, as usual,” Peter explained, carefully avoiding the fact that they’d been learning about The Battle of New York in lesson that day. He knew it was a touchy subject for his dad, and he didn’t want to risk upsetting him.
“Have a good day, boys,” she stopped to kiss both of them on the cheek, then wiped the lipstick mark off with a thumb and a small laugh, “stay out of trouble, eat your greens- and Sam, take out of the trash this morning, it’s your turn.”
Steve nodded, eyes clenched tight as he swallowed. Tony was here. He was underneath Steve’s fingers, alive, breathing, warm. It wasn’t real, and he knew that.
Tony shrugged nonchalantly, before a hand delved into his seemingly bottomless jacket-pocket. A moment later, he’d pulled out a box and was tossing it over to the girl, who caught it in surprise. “There you go. One pack as promised. I’ll see y-“
He wandered back downstairs, footsteps echoing through the empty halls as he made his way back to the kitchen. It still smelled acutely of burning, and it was only once Tony got to the kitchen table that he realised the lamb casserole dish had scorched the wooden surface underneath it. Tony shut his eyes and tried desperately not to think of the way his parents would react to that. He didn’t have the energy to worry about it, not with everything else going on. Every time his mind strayed to Steve and how he was going to end things, Tony forced himself back to the coding, the website construction, the contents that he had planned. He was going to make it fucking perfect, and people were going to sit up and take notice of it. It would be great. And hell, Tony had no friends anyway, so it wasn’t like getting any hate online was going to faze him. He had nothing to lose. Except possibly his home, if Howard caught wind of it.
“Stark’s helped me out of a few tricky situations before,” Steve heard Loki say quietly, and turned his head to look at the other boy. His jaw was tight, eyes glassy. “Sometimes, when I was… when I didn’t want to get Thor involved, but I needed to be picked up… Tony would always come. And he’d never mention it later. Probably to save Thor’s feelings as opposed to mine, but still.” He glanced at Steve. “And, I mean, more than once he’s been around to stop me from doing dumb shit. Again, more for Thor’s benefit—”
There was a nervous knocking, and Steve ceased his ceiling-staring in order to sit up on the bed and throw a slipper against the door as a warning. “Go away, Sam,” he called out, looking at the shadow under the crack of his door as it hovered uncertainly outside.
“Steve, Steve, slow down.” Tony sounded concerned now, even through the speaker, “what’s the emergency?”
“I am going to get more supplies,” Steve declared suddenly, attempting to divert his own attention away from all the increasingly dirty thoughts he was having about the oblivious person lying next to him, “I will see you all in approximately thirty seconds.”
Tony said something, but it was white noise to Steve, and he’d marched out of the room before any of it could sink in anyway.
Tony had nodded, letting the hope sit comfortably in his stomach and keep him from doing something terrible, like crying. Ever since then, he’d been sat on his hospital bed looking through all the notes and scans and weird neuroscience terminology, and simply trying to make sense of it all.
There was a glint in Tony’s eye as he leaned back and studied Steve. “Good mood, hmm? That sounds… unfamiliar. What, pray tell, caused this phenomenon?”
Tony Tony Tony Tony, why did it always come back to him? Steve could barely go a day without something happening that involved that stupid boy.
He stopped, squinting up at the two towering figures on his doorstep. One was James- wait, Rhodey, that’s what Tony had called him- and another was… unknown.
Steve pulled an apologetic face before he slowly pulled away and stood up from the couch. He shot Tony one last smile, and Tony gave him a little wave as he shut the door behind him and followed Thor out to his car. The both of them were quiet- uncharacteristically so. They were shaken by the events of the last 24 hours, and it had taken a toll. Steve was exhausted, and he figured Thor wasn’t faring much better either. Coffee could only do so much, after all.
Tony made an unimpressed noise in the back of his throat and quickly pulled Steve in again, kissing him soundly on the mouth.”Please don’t be,” he said honestly, “just… let it out. You went through some shit today. It’s okay. I won’t hold it against you.”
So, once he’d gotten some of the chores for the day done, he grabbed his sketchbook and a couple of pencils, and then made his way down to Tony’s lab. The doors slid open for him fluidly, and it took a moment or two for him to locate the other man in the mess that was his workshop. Eventually however, he spotted two sneakers poking out from underneath a huge device that was emanating a low humming frequency into the room, and Steve cocked his head at it curiously as he took it in. This was obviously Tony’s big project, then.
With an irritated sigh, he pressed his glasses further up onto his nose and then rolled back over to the desk. Just as he reached out for his mug of coffee, JARVIS spoke up again: “Decryption complete, Sir.”
He leaned up, kissing Tony’s forehead. “But whatever you do, you have me. And if anyone could pull it off, I know it’s you. You’re the smartest guy I know. You’re resourceful. You have contacts and friends everywhere. You could make it. I absolutely believe that.”
“Fair,” Bucky said with a shrug, turning back to him, “so you’re worried about what to get him, huh?”
Steve just blinked a few times, until a second later JARVIS finished: “Ah- Sir has also not quite completed my personality parameters yet. That was a joke, Mr Rogers. I apologize. Sir is still in the process of smoothing out any bugs.”
Tony waited for the telltale crackle, but nothing came. A second later, JARVIS’ apologetic tones spoke up. “It appears Collins has taken the night off, Sir.”
“I never implied that you were,” Steve’s voice remained gentle and Tony heard the rustle of material, like Steve was crouching down, getting to Tony’s level, “I’m just reminding you where you are. With me. In the tower in New York.”
Steve shot him a look. “Hah. Unfortunately for me, I was born with two left feet. Ballet career doesn’t seem like quite my thing,” he answered with a shrug, knowing his cheeks were probably bright red by that point.
That was how Steve’s dreams stuck with him. Not in the sights, but the sounds. The sensations. The taste of blood on the back of his throat that just never seemed to shift, even when it wasn’t really there at all.
Steve, bless him, didn’t even pause for a moment, muttering “If we keep it up, we get to kiss eachother into the next year,” into Tony’s jaw.
He saw Natasha look to Bruce. Felt Rhodey as he positioned Tony’s head so that it was laying in his lap. His best friend stroked the sweaty hair from out of his face and smiled down at him, but when he turned his gaze to Bruce, the expression fell. They said something to one another that Tony didn’t catch, but then Natasha’s gentle hand on his cheek drew his attention back to her. He figured that was so he didn’t watch Bruce go to collect the flat blade that they had searing over the stove.
The silence filled the room straight up, the holograph of Tony sitting staring at his knees being the only thing visible in Steve’s whole world. He wished… shit, he wished for so many things. A second try. Some more time. A two-way video, so Steve could talk back. He got none of that, though, and wishing would only make all this worse.
“Shush,” Steve told him, as if that were some sort of answer, “it’s my turn to fix you up now. You just-“
Tony steeled himself as he grabbed Steve’s hand and stopped it from plunging straight into his face. This was not going to be pleasant. In fact, he was getting a rather uncomfortable sense of déjà vu from this shit, which wasn’t fun. But this time, Tony wasn’t reacting on an emotional level. And he had to admit, that changed the game a little.
“Because then I’ll have to fuck you again, and I want to go to sleep,” Steve explained, and Tony watched him with a smile on his face that he couldn’t for the life of him turn off. He felt happier than he ever had before in his life. This was insane. Steve
His Pops sighed again, and kissed the top of his head. “Your Dad drives me up the wall. And I do the same to him. Like I said, he’s so different to me in so many ways, it’s bound to come out sometimes. And when we have jobs like the ones we do-” Steve paused, and it looked like it pained him to say it. “I will sometimes make mistakes. Do things I shouldn’t do and put myself in danger when it could be avoided. And your Dad will do stupid stuff too, that makes me angry at him. Very angry. Angry enough to have us both refusing to speak to one another and acting like we’re in fourth grade again.”
He felt like he was dreaming. Some sort of warped nightmare, where he lost Tony in the worst way possible, and then got him back, only to have him taken away again.
Steve grabbed him by the waist before he could kick at Ty’s stomach and pulled him back forcibly. Steve didn’t weigh much, but he knew how to work his angles and made sure to throw Tony over his hipbone, pushing him backward and sending him away. Clint and Sam and Nat, who had suddenly joined the front of the crowd, all grabbed him before he could try and go back for round two, and they shoved him away and out of sight of Ty. Steve glanced down at the boy on the floor, now just beginning to sit up with rapid blinks, blood spewing from his nose and pooling in his hands. He locked eyes with Steve, just for a second, and the hatred that was in his eyes in that moment almost made Steve want to look away. Almost.
“There have barely been more than five consecutive minutes of you talking to me where you haven’t dropped in a ‘husband’ somewhere, Tony. I can’t imagine how it must be for the team to go through this, every day,” Pepper told him, placing a hand on Thor’s shoulder supportively as he looked on sadly, shaking his head a little.
, it was Steve’s goddamn curse. A hundred years of being alive and less than half of that spent actually living, you’d have thought he’d have learned by now to stop waiting around for things to happen and just go after them himself.
Peggy patted Steve’s shoulder and grinned. “Change his mind, Steven,” she asked him sweetly, and Steve set his eyes on Tony, whose smile dropped comically off his face as he shook his head and raised a hand of warning.
‘Can I come in’ he mouthed, gesturing to the door and then raising his eyebrows in question. Steve spluttered, flailing his hands toward the teacher, who was busy… fiddling with a Rubix cube on her desk, right-
It was almost like looking in a mirror, except every section of skin was painted in a different shard of colour. Backing on to a black canvas, he saw himself laughing, all natural teeth and crinkly eyes, a look of outright adoration in his eyes as he stared upward at something out of the frame- probably Steve- no one else could make him look that way.
He looked down at Peter quietly, watching the boy tap against each little cartoon duck that he could see on his sleepsuit. It was an hour or so until their decided ‘bedtime’, but Peter already seemed kind of sleepy, his eyes drooping every now and then as he laid his head heavily into Tony’s shoulder. He was so… innocent. The world, with all its cruelty, hadn’t managed to touch him yet. Even though he’d undoubtedly had a loveless first six months of his life, he was still a happy little boy.
Tony is the type of person to not sleep for 20+hours and be found in hysterics because he's built a perpetual motion machine that keeps a slinky going
Steve shut his eyes and let his head loll forward onto the desk, counting seconds in his head. To the left of him, someone was tapping incessantly, and he was about three seconds away from standing up and snapping whatever was making the noise, be it pencils or fingers.
“Famous last words,” Steve muttered, and Tony winked at him again, careless and free as he spun into the corridor and skipped over the floorboards. He was in a remarkably good mood- had been pretty much all day, actually- it was nice. Steve loved seeing him happy. His whole demeanor changed; he seemed so much lighter.
What the hell? Tony had planned this for months and months, trying to visualise how it would all pan out, but this had definitely not been what he’d expected. In fact, he’d barely even expected Steve to say yes at all.
“I’ll tell Happy to remain on standby,” Tony added, “he’ll drive up to the tower and take Peter from Bruce if he needs to suit up and join us.”
Tony, for the first time, smiled. Soft and small, he looked over to Steve and squeezed their hands together gently, before the smile faded once more and he turned into Steve, thumb tracing almost imperceptibly soft underneath Steve’s eye. “I promise I’m gonna make this right,” he said, “I’m not… I know you think I’m ashamed of you, that I don’t want to be seen with you, but I’ll fix that, I will, I’m going to-“
He and Bucky had gone up the Empire State Building once, when they’d both been younger. Back then, Steve had been impressed- he’d felt like the tallest man in the world, looking down on the buildings and seeing the tops of them for the first time in his life.
“Ugh, it’s been a long day,” Tony let his head drop backward, leaning into Steve’s shoulder as his back pressed up against that truly magnificent chest, “I don’t ever want to look at another circuit ever again.”
Tony waved a hand carelessly, not taking his eyes off Steve. "I'll fall magically ill, come on, this is more important."
It rang in his head like a bell as he stared and tried to make his brain start working again. Maybe it had been the joint efforts of both Jane and Jan earlier, but… he could see it. He could see the way Tony was looking at him and as much as it confused him, he knew that wasn’t how you looked at someone you were friends with. You just didn’t.
It was ridiculous! Especially when Tony could choose from anyone- he already apparently had an on-off thing with that Ty guy… Steve wasn’t…
. Remember? The big ceremony in Monaco that got crashed by mutant frogs? Then we went on our honeymoon to London and you fell into the Thames trying to take a picture of me. Ring any bells?”
He sighed in despair. They wouldn’t change their minds, and he wasn’t in a fit enough state to argue with them about it. Their conversation alone had already sapped him of energy. The pain in his periphery kept becoming more and more prominent, and soon it would take over.
Someone put their hand on his shoulder, and he followed the limb until he found Bruce’s face. “What we do now is we support him,” he said, turning to the rest of the table, “in any way we can. He needs us now, more than ever. You know what he’s like… if we’re not there to catch him—”
He pulled out his phone and rubbed his eyes, sending off a text to Tony. The response he got was almost immediate.
Tony looked at him for a moment as if he were holding back a soft smile, but he managed to disguise it with an exaggerated roll of his eyes and a huff as his head dropped back into Steve’s chest defeatedly. “Don’t make this all romantic,” he mumbled, “I was trying to be Extra.”
Bucky's face fell, and he turned to her quickly. "Please don't steal my girlfriend away from me," he whined, getting to his knees in front of her and then just batting Steve away when his foot poked at his shoulder.
Steve opened his mouth, but Tony just shook his head and started walking. “He has a tendency to hold grudges and he likes to hang out with his shit buddies by the bus stop you take- you are getting a lift back with me.”
Peter frowned. That sounded nice. He hadn’t thought they were still going to be nice to each other, after all this. It was odd.
“I could—what if I’m just overreacting?” He wasn’t stupid. He knew he had a strange obsession with listening and hearing Steve’s heartbeat, especially as of late. Yeah, maybe ten years ago he wouldn’t have thought twice about going in all guns blazing, but things were different now. He was less impulsive, a little more level-headed. He knew waltzing into Steve’s high-risk mission without forewarning had the potential to go disastrously if he misjudged.
“Gonna have to settle for sharpening your knives and looking a bit more threatening whenever someone looks in my direction, sweetheart,” Tony told him, voice slurred from the exhaustion that was already pulling him back under.
“That hurts,” Clint said, and Tony opened his mouth to add in when suddenly another muffled set of footsteps sounded down the hall, and Clint’s eyes widened. “Fuck,
Peter would be fine. He’d be safe and happy, and no one would hurt him once Tony got to the bottom of exactly who was behind all this.
“Stay with Tony,” Rhodey told Bruce, squaring his shoulders and then grabbing one of the spears Natasha had spent hours crafting. Tony watched Natasha move as well, picking up her knife and turning to Rhodey.
“It’s not-“ and Steve hated this, hated how every single time they went through the same conversation, over and over like a broken fucking record. He’d wanted to tell Tony that he wasn’t angry because he’d disobeyed, he was angry because Tony had gone in there and taken down the main router and then
Steve smiled with full cheeks and pressed another kiss to Tony’s face, even when the man yelled and smacked him away. “Ew,
He let his mind wander freely as his bus got closer and closer to home, thinking over all the events of the day. His clothes were still wet and he was still horribly cold, but something seemed to have settle inside him a little all the same. Maybe seeing his mom had been a good idea after all.
“No, I’m just calling you delusional,” Ty hissed, pushing forward once more, “you don’t know what you’re fucking doing. When are you going to give this shit up? We’ve all been patient, we’ve all let you work through this- this stupid thing you have going on with Rogers and all his
Silently, Tony followed along as Steve led them both back down the street the way they’d come. He was surprisingly steady on his feet, which was lucky- Steve doubted whether or not he’d have been strong enough to take Tony’s weight had he fallen over.
Steve didn’t say anything to that, and Tony just clenched his jaw and looked down at his hand, sat protectively over the thrum of Steve’s heart. That hadn’t been there, last time Tony had felt it. It had been gone, missing, close to never coming back again.
He huffed a little, turning his head behind him and wondering briefly if Heather was still there with Tony. Whether they were still talking together, or she’d given up and walked away. He hoped for the latter.
“Sir, on any other occasion I would agree with you. But you have no idea the damage that Stone has done.”
Tony looked down at him, and then turned back to Bucky. “Five minutes. Then you can come back and mother hen the both of us to your heart’s content,” he told him.
He shut his eyes, trying to compose himself a little. He’d already known—whether Tony blamed him or not, the crux of the matter was that Steve had caused this. Steve had catalysed all these events.
Tony gave a tiny shrug, tearing off another small chunk of toast. His face was empty. “Dunno,” he said, “probably. Got nowhere else to go.”
Tony, still not really awake, just sighed and then pushed his head into Steve again, pulling the blanket up a little further around him. “Mmm.”
"nuh uh," Tony shook his head vehemently, glancing down once more as the baby stirred a little bit, "she left him here, in the cold, out in the streets of fucking New York. She's not getting him back now."
“Oh, yeah, sure, ‘cause that’s gonna be an even match—” but Steve was already hopping down the stairs, pulling Tony along with him. “—God, you’re not thinking of going full-speed with me still attached to you, right, because you’re just gonna end up dragging your boyfriend along in the dirt. Or pulling my arm off.”
He gasped, lungs failing to do their job effectively enough as he struggled to find air- but Steve was still there, rubbing his shoulders and gently coaxing the life back into his body, bit by painful bit, each second broken by the sound of steve’s voice, explaining his day so far and somehow making it into a great adventure, when Tony knew it was really quite dull.
Sam folded his arms and walked back to them slowly, before landing right behind Steve. “Is there a problem here?”  He asked warily.
Down the line, Tony made a humming sound. Steve thought he was smiling. “yeah, I know what you mean, Steve,” he responded, voice soft.
But then the man nudged him gently in his side, and he had no choice but to turn and face him, slow and nervous. When he did catch sight of Steve, however, he was certainly not expecting what he saw.
“Tony?” He blinked and turned back to Steve, who was now looking slightly wary. Tony realised it had been a few seconds since he’d said a word. “If… if this isn’t the right time, or you’re not… I mean that’s fine too—”
“I love you,” Steve said again, and Tony giggled when Steve broke away to plant a gentle kiss against the tip of his nose, “I’ll keep saying that. Every day, if I have to.”
“You shouldn’t know my name. It’s supposed to be classified. That is, unless you’ve been peeking into private SHIELD files. But why would a reclusive billionaire want to be doing that, huh?”
“I love you too,” Tony responded, the words having no difficulty slipping off his tongue. He’d used to think it was so much harder than that, but it just wasn’t. Steve said it so much, so easily, at such otherwise meaningless points, that Tony had come almost to expect it. It was just a fact of his life. He was Iron Man. He was Tony Stark. He loved Steve, and Steve loved him, and said so whenever the thought came into his head.
, but at least this was going to be fixable. At least HYDRA hadn’t—they hadn’t done something irreversible. They hadn’t taken him from Tony completely.
“Well it’s gonna have to wait, Steve, it’s not fucking important,” Tony snapped at him, combing his fingers through his hair and straightening it up.
Paul nodded. The smile on his face let Steve know he didn’t believe it for a second, but had decided not to push. “Well, if ever you need anything-“
“—God, you’re lucky I’m around.” Steve turned rapidly, spotting Thor’s brother leaning in the threshold of the apartment. He was holding a plastic bag, and as he walked in, he dumped the contents on the table to reveal a bunch of first aid materials, including, thankfully, butterfly bandages. “Seeing as I was already apparently acting as chauffeur, I thought I’d stop by CVS for a soda to keep me going.” He rattled a half-empty can in the air, then shrugged over to the other materials on the coffee table. “They were more of an afterthought.”
Tony shot him a look. It was a very judgemental thing. “You’re really serious about this, aren’t you?”
Steve paused, and he looked almost wistful as he glanced over to the mug in between Tony’s fingers and shook his head. “Doesn’t affect me anyway. Keep your bitter mud, Shellhead, I’ll stick to orange juice.”
He took a deep breath, pushed everything he was feeling back down into the little pit of despair it had come from, and pressed frantically at the intercom a dozen times in order to convey his apparent distress. It took a few seconds for anything to happen, and in the meantime, Steve looked warily around him, noting the security camera at the corner of the gate. Then-
Steve narrowed his eyes incredulously and tried to keep up with the half of the conversation he’d walked into. “What are you… wait- why the fuck d’you think I’m dating Bucky?”
he could, he just had to- bend? Twist? Unwilling to move any further up into the air, he tucked his knees up and then rolled his body back around, seeing if it would change his direction, and then grinning in satisfaction when it did. He stopped flying upward for a second, hovering in midair.
He landed smoothly right outside the door, slowing his descent to the point where he didn’t even make a noise as he touched down. The door was passcode encrypted, but Tony was Tony, and it didn’t stay that way for long. “Can we get a signal here, J?”
, that couldn’t be true. He wouldn’t. “I don’t understand,” he said to her, face blank and slack, “why did I- what-”
They broke away, looking at one another slightly disbelievingly for a second. Then they laughed- loud and surprised as both of them nodded their heads at one another. Tony grabbed Steve’s hand and then leaned in again, kissing Steve hard and happily, and Steve wrapped his arm around Tony’s waist, pulling him in closer.
But then Steve leaned in again. He kissed Tony’s nose, of all places. “I have very positive thoughts on that matter, actually,” he admitted, before his eyes flashed with seriousness and he looked deeply into Tony’s eyes. “I thought… I thought that I might lose you out there,” he admitted, and under the table he found Tony’s hand, lying flat on the hospital bed. He squeezed tight. “You were so pale and—and Helen Cho is a miracle worker, but it was touch and go for a little while, and… yeah. The point is, I don’t think I should waste any more time hiding the fact that I’m pretty damn in love with you.”
Steve nodded, tapping his comm. “Thor? I need you on the outside, keeping them away from civvy buildings.” Tony heard Thor’s confirmation through his own comm as he approached the large metal skeleton of the SHIELD compound. He quickly switched back to Steve’s comm. “We need to find out what they want.”
“Come on, Steve Rogers,” he said warmly in the end, tugging at Steve’s hand and pulling him forward, “I think, just out of principle, that we shouldn’t spend another second in school grounds. It’s a natural depressant. I think we can do that enough on our own as it is, yeah?”
“To be fair,” and this time it was Thor leaning over to speak to Tony, one eyebrow raised mischievously, “I’m pretty sure you embarrassed yourself far more than you embarrassed Steve.”
about it, and it wasn’t fair, and I’m just…” he shook his head softly and leaned onto his knees, eyes on the floor. “I’m just sorry, Tony. You never deserved that.”
Under the table, someone nudged his leg. He kicked out randomly and then heard Clint wince in front of him. “We are going to keep doing this until you just give in and let me pay the bill, Tony-“
“He’s just doing it to get a rise out of you, Steve,” he muttered next to Steve’s ear, eyeing up Zeke with distaste while the boy just laughed at them both, “believe me, he’s not worth that. Just leave it.”
Steve didn’t respond for a beat. He looked up to the roof instead, and usually it would be an indication that he was about to speak to JARVIS, but he didn’t. Tony got the feeling he was thinking of the little baby boy that was currently sleeping soundly in their room, tucked up under a soft blankey and wrapped in a sleepsuit covered with little toy ducks.
“Ha ha,” Steve slumped forward and let his forehead rest on the desk again, sighing loudly, “you know just how to charm a boy, don’t you?”
“You’re only saying that because you’re too dense to see beyond that tiny box your mind is thinking in!” The boy- Reed- yelled back, watching Tony with folded arms as he started scribbling out yet another formula over the board, wiping off one of Reed’s as he did so and then ducking from the angry swipe he got in response. “You are far too cynical, Stark, and your view of the world is entirely human-centric, you believe that everything we think is already correct-“
The gym teacher sat him down on one of the chairs outside the Principal’s office before opening the office door and stepping inside, presumably to explain to Principal Fury what had just happened. One by one all the rest of his friends were put into seats too. They all sat in a row, blood trickling from various injuries. Steve felt bad, but he hadn’t even noticed any of them had even gotten involved. “You shouldn’t have jumped in,” he said shortly, “I had it.”
Steve nipped Tony’s skin again with his teeth in chastisement and then groaned petulantly, looking up at Tony with a truly adorable pout. He harrumphed and set his chin down against Tony’s reactor, the simple glance turning into a melancholic & longing gaze as he pulled out the full power of his dumb puppy eyes.
Smiling, he opened the letter and pulled out its contents. There were three slips, the same as everyone else, and Steve had bordered them with little cartoon drawings of the whole team. It looked adorable, and Tony grinned up at Steve, grabbing him by the collar and pulling him down for a kiss before he continued.
A second later, he stopped thinking completely as everything blanked out and left his mind thankfully empty of all thoughts and feelings. The next thing he recognised again when the world slowly shifted back into focus was the sound of Clint’s incessant voice drilling a painful thump into his brain, and he winced at the grating noise. He wasn’t sure how much time had passed, but if Clint had managed to find him, then it must have at least been a minute or two.
But Bruce had only shrugged non-committedly. “I- I don’t know,” he’d admitted, “I should think so. Whatever they were doing with you, it wouldn’t have been for a long enough time to stick. We’ve studied what happened with Bucky and his conditioning- not even seventy years managed to remove his past life completely. If we’re using him as our reference, then hopefully this should fade. But I don’t know, Tony. All of this is hypothetical.”
Peter babbled then, apparently agreeing. They both huffed in amusement, glancing between one another and the baby in the middle of them. Tony sighed. “We should probably talk to the team,” he said in the end, getting to his feet, “this is somewhat of a development. I’m guessing that they’ll want to hear it. JARVIS, wake ‘em all up and tell them to meet us in the kitchen, will you?”
Tony had still been there when Howard had arrived back home. And Ty hadn’t wasted any time. Tony had been wrong- or at least, Tony had been lying when he’d told Steve that Howard wouldn’t ever find out.
Tony tried to glare at them, but his vision was too fuzzy and his head too heavy to hold up. He groaned, biting down on his lip when a fresh wave of agony rolled through him. This was fucking
“What sort of assistance?” Steve said slowly, beginning to stand, “is it something that would be better suited for, say, the fire department?”
Tony just pulled a face at him. “Because I don’t want them to kill any more innocent fucking people, Steve, why do you think?”
Bruce looked pained. “He was hit in the leg by shrapnel,” he explained, “it punctured his artery. We had to cauterise the wound when we got here or he would’ve died, but I don’t think he’s responded well to it. He’s feverish, sick. I’m not sure how much longer he can hold out.”
After the shoes had been removed and placed neatly against the couch, he spared one last longing glance over to Tony and then straightened up and checked his watch.
for me,” he explained reassuringly, “it’s you. Whatever we do will be good. It’ll be amazing. And we don’t have to—”
It was a Sunday. He wasn’t exactly going to be doing anything worthwhile today anyway. And he was tired.
, dammit- on any other occasion, Tony would have been absolutely fine. Maybe it would have spooked him a bit, okay, but not this. Not the full-bodied shaking, eyes wide in terror, breath coming in too short to catch sort of panic that he was currently feeling. It was like…
“Steve,” he responded with, sticking out a hand, “it’s nice to finally meet you,” he said through a smile.
“No, nothing dumb, I promise,” Steve hurried to confirm as he shook his head, “I’m just… wondering what you’ve gotten Natasha for Christmas?”
you’re not sleeping at night, you’re all jittery and stuff- I feel like you’re possessed by a demon or someth-”
The bell rang for last period and he was one of the first to slip out, going as inconspicuously as he could to avoid potential conversation. He wasn’t really sure why. Perhaps some sort of self-sabotaging thing, because really, more than anything he just wished he had someone to talk to right now. Someone to see him and just… care.
- be with someone who thinks hitting their partner is fucking okay. I won’t stay. You can’t make me stay.”
“Perfect,” Tony nodded, “I’m fucking starving. Let’s get brunch.” He let go of Steve’s hands and turned around, fingers fiddling with his hair, “just give me five minutes to clean up first. Although…” A small grin flashed across his face as he twisted his neck, looking back, “-before any of that-“
He had to move, but he couldn’t. His limbs wouldn’t listen. He wanted Tony, but he couldn’t get him, he was too far away, too angry, and for good fucking reason. Steve didn’t deserve him. Steve never had. And who knew? Maybe Tony
Steve looked at him. Under his jacket was a switch-blade that he kept for emergencies. He could whip that out and end this right now. Sure, JARVIS would probably never let him leave the room and starve him to death in this Fort Knox of a house, but at least it would stop Iron Man in his tracks.
There was the sound of ambulances, distant in the air. People were crying. He could see them in his periphery. Across the street, it was silent. Pressed up against his chest, Tony was silent too.
Five minutes and one floor later, Tony was glaring at him with more anger in his face than there had been when he’d found out Steve had sold him out. “I’d rather die,” he declared, “Steve, you cannot be serious.”
There was a moment of silence in the kitchen, nothing other than the faint sounds of Peppa Pig in the background as everyone stewed on his statement. It was Steve who got to it first. “Xavier,” he said, blinking in realisation, “of course. He’d know what to do about this, right?”
“Oh, that reminds me,” Darcy turned to Steve, who jerked his head back up and tried to recall what had just been said, “someone told me that you’ve gotten on the wrong side of Tiberius Stone. What did you do, dude? That’s dangerous territory to walk over.”
Tony took a moment of silence, and then sighed. “I’m trying really hard to think of a dirty response to that, but nothing’s coming.”
Steve glowered at Tony, who just smiled innocently back and threw on his spare coat. Fucking idiot looked great in denim, too. Fuck him double.
Tony laughed, and the sound felt so damn relieving in his ears that Steve couldn’t help but laugh too, rocking Tony sideways and kissing up his neck, savoring the sensation of the pulse beneath his lips. Tony moved his head until he could kiss Steve properly, and they stayed like that for a while, just allowing themselves the reprieve of one another. Steve refused to think of any more what-if’s. That way would lead only to madness.
Steve sunk slowly to his haunches, locking his elbows against his knees and then pressing the heels of his hands into his eye sockets hard enough that his vision went spotty.
He was overthinking it. Steve hadn’t meant it like that. Obviously, he had a point. Tony couldn’t fight like Natasha or shoot like Clint or strangle people with his metal arm like Bucky. Without the suit, he wasn’t a hero. Not that Steve had been implying that, either. Probably.
“Hey, uh,” he cut in on Tony’s sentence, shaking his head jerkily and then glancing at him for a moment before looking down at his feet again, “it’s fine. I have to head home anyway, I feel kinda… yeah. Anyway. You go, uh, catch up with your friends. It’s fine.”
“You thought wrong. I loathe to say this, Rogers, but get some clothes on.” Tony rolled off him and then grabbed Steve’s shirt from the floor, tossing it over.
They smiled at eachother, and Steve realised he probably had to start heading somewhere, but found himself somewhat unwilling to remove his eyes from Tony. That smile was fucking hypnotising. It was just…
Steve wanted to say- but he knew it would come out wrong; debating something whilst hungover was never a good idea. Sam meant well. “It’s alright,” Steve told him instead, running a hand down his face, “listen, I was just…somewhere I shouldn’t have been. I didn’t like it. Tony took me home.”
Fifteen minutes later and Steve came with a bitten-off moan, biting down against Tony’s shoulder gently. A few seconds after that, Tony did too, and when he opened his eyes again Steve was smiling at him, all gentle and soft and normal. His face was still pale and sickly. But Tony knew better than to ask now. “You look adorable when you come,” Steve murmured, kissing Tony messily, “have I told you that?”
He kept watching as Tony slowly slid his hand up to Steve’s face, fingers brushing across his lip in a feather-light caress that was barely even there at all.
Steve ground his teeth together and watched Brock’s head turn to the mirror, staring daggers at where Steve was stood by the audio stand. Steve, however, was not perturbed “Rumlow, your presence is required elsewhere. Fury’s asking for a brief. I’ll talk to Mr. Stark.”
, he thought to himself as darkness started to creep into his vision. Steve was still yelling at him but Tony couldn’t hear any more, or see. Everything just buzzed. He wondered if his heart was broken too. His brain. That certainly seemed broken.
“Uh oh,” he muttered, blinking rapidly as the girl grabbed his hands and started jumping up and down again.
When Steve looked at him in shock, Bucky just huffed, looking over to the house with a soft smile on my face. “Dude, we’re both broke as shit. I just spent all my money on a car and Tash steals breakfasts bars from the corner store so that she isn’t going hungry until dinner.”
“You scared me out of my mind, Tony,” he said in the end, voice quiet, and Tony’s heart sank. Oh. It was gonna be one of
“Certainly, Sir,” JARVIS responded easily, and by the time he and Peter arrived in the bathroom, bubbly water was already starting to fill up the bath. Tony placed Peter down on the bath mat and then hastily cleared away his stray bits of shaving equipment, lest the little terror got his hands on a razor-blade. During his short stay, they’d all pretty much worked out that any available object within touching distance was fair game to Peter, and anything that could feasibly fit would most likely end up in his mouth. He watched Peter out of the corner of his eyes as he cleaned it all away, smirking when the boy simply looked down at the mat in fascination, fingers trailing over the little bobbles. He was a cute kid; Tony dare even say cuter than average- the boy’s eyes were totally enrapturing, huge and as blue as the sky up above, and the hair atop his head was fluffy and soft, emanating that Unique Baby Smell that Tony could just bury his face in and smell for days.
“More of what?” Steve asked, before the penny dropped and his face paled even further. “More kids,” he responded to his own question, voice dull, expression horrified.
Tony’s voice filtered through his head, the memory of one of their first civil conversations straight after the battle of New York. Tony had always made sure to remind him of that. He’d always believed it—hell, on more than one occasion he’d called Steve a truly abysmal soldier, which, frankly, was true. Steve viewed rules more like guidelines and he didn’t care for the orders of men who’d never even seen a battle before. The only reason he hadn’t been discharged at all was because of his title as Captain America.
Tony raised his eyebrows and laughed. “How high is your IQ Doctor Banner? Learn to. I’m not going near the kid until it’s my turn to change the thing, which it is not.”
he feel? He couldn’t really describe it. Like floating on a cloud, high above everything else that mattered. God. Tony was… Tony had given him his voicemail back, and he’d run Steve over to a corner of God only knows where in New York to watch the sun set, and he’d kissed Steve like he was the only important thing in the world-
She chastised, turning to him sharply. He shut his mouth immediately, shame burning in his gut. He was yelling at Mrs. Wilson- God, what was
“Yeah,” Steve smiled and pulled out a bag of rice from the top shelf, “it was wonderful, thank you. Were things alright over here while we were gone?”
He debated begging. Debated a lot of things, in those few seconds. The woman was glaring at him as if she held all the cards- which, he figured, she did- and Steve looked down at the floor as he swallowed and licked his tongue over cracked lips.
“Yes, well then I’ll remind him, won’t I,” Tony snapped, turning the corner in the stairwell and then swallowing when another mound of bodies came into view. He paused for a moment, and then bit his lip. “But to be safe… Primary user override: Anthony Edward Stark. Disable all external command features. Disable User Captain Steve Rogers. Disable all external access codes. Complete Lockdown mode, J.”
“See, the best thing is that I have no idea whether he’s joking or he really is just that whipped,” Clint perked up at Steve’s other side, looking between them both, “also, if I give you ten bucks would you beat up people for me too?”
“Wha’ddya think?” Bucky bounced up and down on the weirdly coloured seats and turned to him expectantly, “cool, huh?”
“Tony,” this time it was Steve’s turn to lean up and lay a hand over his mouth to quiet his train of thought, but this time, he didn’t pull his hand away once Tony was quiet. Instead, he slid it around, gentle and soft, to the back of Tony’s neck. His muscles ached in protest, but that was not even close to being on the radar of his concerns just then.
He smiled, glancing back to Steve and then picking up the Christmas cracker between them. “I suppose I ruined the surprise with my delirious pain-babbling,” he began clumsily, suddenly realising that he’d just kissed Steve, and Steve knew exactly what Tony wanted, and he was trying to play that off but he was pretty sure Steve could see him blustering, because Steve was good at reading him, always had been. “But for the sake of showbiz, let’s pretend you don’t know what goodies are inside this otherwise innocuous Christmas cracker.”
Tony raised an eyebrow, him and Steve sharing another look before Tony turned back to Thor. “It’s fiancé now, actually,” he declared nonchalantly, and Steve squeezed his hip as the happiness flowed through him. God—Fiancé. That is what Tony was to him and what he was to Tony.
“Tony,” Steve rolled his eyes and reached for his shirt, throwing it over his head and fitting his arms through the sleeves, “I am
Steve rolled his eyes. Now that he’d managed to relax a little again, the lethargy was returning to him once more. The mission that day had been exhausting, and usually Steve slept for hours after them in order to pull his energy reserves back up to normal. The damn nightmare had messed with his routine though, and now the tiredness was hitting him in waves once more.
Bucky whispered, and he sounded so sad, Steve looked up to him despite himself. “He’s okay, Stevie. Tony’s okay. Look- Thor’s got him, they’re coming up, right now.”
“It doesn’t sound like a whim to me,” Steve said gently, “it sounds like Scott just proved you could do it and survive.”
With a sigh, Steve let his head drop into Peggy’s shoulder. She mirrored the action, resting her cheek on his hair.
Steve—if this was Steve, of course—had just killed what looked to be nearly fifty men. Without a single weapon.
Tony could still feel Steve’s gaze on him, and when he looked over, for some reason Steve’s eyes were pained. Tony felt his heart sink a little at the sight- he hadn’t meant to make this into A Thing. Now Steve probably felt sorry for him or something, dammit. He blinked quickly and hoisted Peter to eye-level, observing him clinically. “We haven’t bathed him yet, have we?” He asked, “we should probably do that. Babies need baths. I’ll go and—do that. Now. Cool.”
“He’s alive,” Carol shouted, and Steve was so grateful for her that he would’ve gotten down on his knees and kissed her feet, “but he needs help, and fast.”
be, anyone else who I would chose to spend the rest of my life with. Ever. I love him more today than I did yesterday, and tomorrow I will love him more than I did today, because he’s an idiot and he’s difficult and he’s an asshole and I am completely, utterly devoted to him.”
That, of all the questions Steve had thrown at him, seemed to be the one to stump Tony. He stopped moving, except for his eyes which flickered a little manically around everywhere except Steve. In the end, he just shrugged and looked at his feet as they dragged back and forth across the floor. "It's... it's a nice name," he said, voice quieter than it had been before. "I don't know- it's been a while since someone introduced themselves so... properly to me before. I thought it was funny."
Sam made a humming noise and looked over to Steve with a smug grin on his face that said ‘ha, you listened to my advice’. Darcy just looked a little surprised, before grinning.
to be more careful,” he’d settled on in the end, keeping his voice as level and calm as he could and trying not to think about the panicked way that he’d heard Tony call out for backup, call out for Steve without even realising it. “I know that you say you do the math, you calculate the risk, but one day the odds will not be in your favour and you won’t make it out, Tony, do you fucking get that? Or are you just too fucking dense to realise you’re not
And now he was here. At Tony’s house. About to see him again a year after breaking up, and intending to lie blatantly throughout the whole night, while also seducing him into giving Steve the information he wanted.
"Hey hey hey, why the frog-marching?" Tony glanced behind him and spotted Clint, looking rather confused as Steve pushed him into the room firmly. When he set his eyes on Tony and the kid, he frowned. "You're up early," he said.
Steve shut his eyes and contemplated just making a break for it out of the window, but he knew it was a futile effort. She’d no doubt be waiting for him when he got down. Peggy was insufferable like that.
Thor just laughed. “Yeah. Loki.” He shook his head and finally looked up, into the sky where the rain was just beginning to let up a little. “My own little brother, gone past a point where I have a clue about what to do with him. I don’t even
Steve breathed out softly, crowding over Tony as he rose to his knees, taking Tony’s face in his hands and kissing him gently, so very gently.
“I know, I know!” Tony sat up suddenly and then shuffled around, crossing his legs and leaning forward on his elbows as his fingers interlocked underneath his chin. He looked up at Steve with his stupid puppy eyes, and Steve just rolled his own when Tony started to pout. “It’s all a part of my charm.”
Steve snorted, and then copied the action, feeling the whiskey slide smoothly down his throat. Tony always got the best stuff. “Fair enough,” he said, and then grinned as the taste sparked a memory. “Hey, remember when Bucky drank your whole bottle of Jack Daniels and then decided he was going to try out naked acrobatics on the streets of New York?”
"Do something," he looked at Steve in the end, his face leaving no room for excuses, "you're Captain America, you survived fifty years in the Arctic, nothing can defeat you. Please, for the love of God,
Steve watched him go, something heavy settling in his gut in a way that it hadn’t in so long now. It was his fight response waking up, his battle mode coming back to him. He wished it wouldn’t. Wished that he could just stay here and pretend he’d never heard Natasha’s words. But that wasn’t a decision he’d be able to make in good conscience—not when he knew that there could be a solution out there. Even if it was just the tiniest of chances…
Bruce looked at him dryly, and then without speaking, lifted his hands and made a length of approximately 8 inches between them. “That’s why.”
“I’m not finished,” Pops interrupted, and Peter could see the tiny little smile his Pops was wearing out of the corner of his eye. “He managed to make me rethink all those preconceived ideas in the space of 24 hours. Every last one of them. He went through a portal and saved New York and I felt like an ass, because I’d told him that was the last thing he would ever do, and that he wasn’t a hero.” Pops laughed, and it sounded fond. “God, Pete, if there was one thing on this world that I could possibly have gotten more wrong, I’d love to hear it.”
, obviously, but… I’m just confused, that’s all.” He shrugged in defeat, looking over to his friends with a weary smile and then chucking a pillow at Clint. “Also, if you imply my boyfriend is a slut again I’m gonna kick your ass, Barton.”
But Steve just held onto his hand tighter and then shook his head vehemently, his face sad and pained. “I promise,” he whispered, “I’m not going anywhere.”
There was silence; Steve, Rhodey and Carol stood together by the side of the road and then the rest of his friends at the foot of the house. Steve could barely even believe what had happened- couldn’t understand why Bucky had acted like such a fucking idiot.
Steve nodded slowly. “Yeah,” he breathed “yeah, I know. I love you. I love you so much. I wouldn’t… I was going to tell them what they wanted. About Bucky. To stop them.” He looked down in shame, the heavy guilt curling tight in his gut. “I wouldn’t have been able to… I’m sorry, I’m just-”
His eyes burned and his muscles jumped with energy—he didn’t want to stop, there was too much; rage, too much
Tony threw himself forward- sudden and jerky, not bothering to land back on deck with the grace of before. Steve was already moving forward, but Tony looked up, hand moving, telling him to stop.
So I wanted to write a bit of Tony's non-okayness (Because It's me ofc I wanna do that lmao) So I thought I'd write this fill. Cue Tony being a bit of an idiot with substance abuse, icecream not-really-but-maybe-sort-of-dates, and of course, Steve being...well, Steve.
, really. It was kinda transfixing to watch him like that; so alive and so tuned in to everything and nothing at the same time. The logical part of Steve wondered how the hell it was only him and a sparse few other who ever got to see that side of him.
He didn’t even know how to say it. How to put it into words, how it had all felt, going back there. It felt like he and Tony were just living in a never-ending cycle, always finishing in a Siberian tundra, fighting one another. Steve just couldn’t stop fucking hurting him, not matter how hard he tried.
His past version—the one who he had been before everything had gone wrong—would live on. No one would need to mourn him. The universe would right itself, and Steve would simply blink out of existence like he had never been there at all. A glitch. Wrong connection, temporary interference, whatever. It didn’t matter.
“Tony?” Steve asked, and oh, Tony was in front of him. He hadn’t even realised he’d been walking. “Are you okay? You look—”
Steve rolled his eyes and scoffed down some more of his food as Tony and Clint continued to chat over his shoulders. Eventually the two boys seemed to come to some sort of agreement about one punch from Tony being equal to three donuts bought for him or something, and Steve tried to ignore them as they shook hands over his head, holding out the hope that Tony was simply joking and wouldn’t
He frowned, turning his head to the source of the noise, and found it belonged to none other than Troy or Chad or Jace or whatever the guy was called who’d grabbed his bag earlier that week. He seemed slightly nervous as he walked over to Steve and Natasha. His buddy wasn’t with him, but Steve’s was, which was certainly comforting.
of it any more, he just didn’t want to deal with it, that was all. He couldn’t afford to argue with Steve just then, when he knew that it was only a single thread that was still connecting Steve to him in the first place. Every time Tony looked at him, it was clear Steve wanted to run, and Tony couldn’t lose him over this. Not now. They’d gotten through the worst part, and now they just needed to stick with it until they came out the other side.
“I could,” Tony answered as he hobbled along with Steve, “but this whole building is lined with transmission blocking equipment. I looked at the blueprints to this place a few months ago; there’s an electromagnetic system running through the walls in this place, and all your tech runs on a closed system within the building. The transponders in my arm can’t pick up a signal because your stupid SHIELD equipment keeps scrambling it. You must fucking hate working here- no internet, seriously? Why do that to yourself?” Tony turned to Steve as he began to lead them through the corridors, face pulled tight. “But I’m digressing. Do you have a plan?”
He grinned to himself, falling into step beside Tony and then feeling the now-familiar electricity as their shoulder brushed at each stride. Tony turned his head, looking over to him and opening his mouth to say something.
“They’re here,” Bruce declared, and Tony watched his two friends scramble to their feet and nod to each other.
“Hmm,” he breathed, lips brushing Steve’s messily for another second before he stood straight again, removing his mouth from where Steve could reach, “I should keep you down here with me all the time if this is what happens.”
Below him, Tony stirred, his senses catching on to the sound of movement in the room. Steve just watched as the boy’s eyes fluttered open, taking Steve in with a blink of surprise. “Steve?” He croaked, “what are y-“
His face dropped like a stone. The hand on Tony’s back snapped away like he was burning and he opened his mouth quickly, eyes wide, a little bit horrified, like a rabbit caught in the biggest brightest headlight you could think of.
, because the last thing he remembered was telling Tony to stay away, then lunging… lunging with the intent to kill.
Bucky laughed, which prompted a slap from Peggy who was sat on the floor by his feet giving him a pedicure. “Don’t
than a genius. His brain worked at speeds Formula One cars couldn’t hope to reach, and that had been what had caught Steve’s eye, right from the very beginning. He’d always loved the smartasses. That was what Peggy had always said anyway, starting all the way back when they’d been kids in highschool and Steve had been crushing on Eric Challis, the boy sat in front of him in math who’d always gotten straight A’s in his tests.
And maybe Steve would be okay with that. Maybe steve would be happy with whatever Tony could give him.
Tony chuckled softly, and his hand came to rest at the base of Steve’s neck, curling the little hairs that lay there. “I’m sorry too,” he admitted, “I should have warned you. I just… God, I just wanted to expose you to as little of that part of my life as possible. Thought I’d never need to warn you about it, because you’d just never interact with them. This was a dumb thing to think. I’m sorry for hurting you.”
Steve threw himself at Tony almost hard enough to send them both off balance and rolling back down the roof. As it was, Tony just about managed to keep them steady as Steve wrapped his arms impossibly tightly around Tony’s shoulders, burying his head into the juncture of his neck and clenching his eyes shut as he felt his breath hitch.
Steve doesn’t even hesitate before he’s crawling into his bed with Tony, arms pulling Tony in closer until his face is buried in Steve’s shoulder and his arms are tucked up against his chest.
Tony continued to look concerned, but in the end he just sighed and then nodded. “Right,” he said with a sigh, “fine, let’s go. Just don’t fall off.”
Steve laughed loudly and yanked his other slipper off in order to throw that one too. “Tell him he can go fuck himself, fuckhead!” he yelled.
Fucking Christ, there was probably an entire hospital tucked away in there anyway. Maybe that had been the plan all along.
“Mr. Rogers,” and suddenly JARVIS’s voice was quiet, more serious, and Steve turned back to the ceiling immediately, “a word of advice, if I may?”
They retreated into the living room, Bucky flicking on the TV and pulling up Brooklyn Nine-Nine whilst Steve iced the swelling with his bag of peas, but the background noise did little to soothe his anxieties, and his fingers spent the entire period just tapping nervously against the couch, no matter how many times Bucky told him to cut it out and try to relax.
He was selfish and foolish and he just wanted everything. But he’d settle for anything- anything at all that Tony was willing to give. That wonderful, broken boy.
“May I add,” JARVIS said hurriedly, and Steve got the feeling if he’d had eyes, Steve would be getting a death-stare off him right about now,  “that it was simply one of those ‘good-natured ribbings’; like what we had discussed earlier this morning-“
Tony paused, and then shuffled sideways a bit, jerking his head. “Then practise,” he said with a nonchalant shrug, “Pete still needs his hair washing.”
The flight was only half an hour, but the wait was excruciatingly long. Every second felt stretched into a sperate hour of its own, with Tony spinning a dozen scenarios in his head throughout the whole journey, none of them good. He knew he had to keep his head on straight, knew that letting his emotions get the better of him was not something he could afford to do, but it was fucking hard. God,
“We discovered Peter’s got a different enhancement,” Steve told him eventually, and that made Tony look up at him in surprise. He had to say, that hadn’t been how he’d expected this conversation to begin.
“The Wilsons are out,” Steve told him, opening the door quickly and then pushing Tony in, “we’re all good.”
“Don’t scream, please, or you’re gonna make me cry,” Bucky hurried to say, eyes widening as Steve gasped.
Steve’s lifted a hand to try and block, but he was just a second too slow and his head snapped sideways with a jerk as Tony’s knuckles rapped across it, eyes going wide as if somewhat surprised. A moment later, finally giving up the fight, they rolled backward and Steve went limp under Tony’s grip with a small exhale of air.
“Just take me to the jello, Soldier,” Tony muttered, flipping Bruce the bird behind Steve’s back, “then we can go make a nest or whatever your hind brain wants to do next.”
They messed about for a few more minutes in a way that only the worst kind of cringey couples could do, but Tony didn’t even care. Not one bit. He kissed Steve whenever the opportunity arose, and said ‘I love you’ about seventy times, and never even let go of him for more than a few seconds. By the time they were both ready to fall asleep, Tony was exhausted from the sheer deluge of happiness alone. He was still wearing Steve’s shirt, with Steve forsaking clothes altogether, and the two of them were facing one another, nose to nose in the bed.
It was impossible. Steve’s reflexes were too fast- he never ever dropped anything. He just didn’t. It didn’t happen.
Tony clicked his fingers over to the elevator. “Talk about my age again and consider yourself evicted from this tower.”
Curious fingers reached up and brushed lightly across the casing in front of him, which, in hindsight, was probably not the wisest decision. He hadn’t considered the fact that they may have implemented some defence protocols before abandoning it to Captain America and the SHIELD team, and so as soon as his skin touched down against the metal, he felt the reaction occur instantly. Agonising pain lanced up his body in a rapid-fire motion, his muscles spasming against their will as thousands of volts of electricity coursed through his body and sent him flying across the room. He felt the prickle up and down his skin as he flew through the air, the unfortunately familiar sensation of a dozen little needles stabbing into each section of skin, but a second or so later the pain drifted just out of his reach, and as his body slammed up against the wall on the other side of the room, he felt himself slip into a state of half-unconsciousness. The floor was cold where he fell, and his body jerked and twitched uselessly, small gasps choking their way up his throat. He knew if it had been any normal man, a current of that intensity would have killed them immediately.
“It was hardly my name,” Bruce rolled his eyes and leaned back on his chair, “more like a gargle that started with a ‘B’.”
Tony hadn’t been so lucky, Steve found out when he awoke. Tony was baseline human, but his saving grace had been the suit, which again, had absorbed as much of the power as it could and then expended it before it could cause damage. There had still been a massive concentration of heat and power though, and most of it had been centred around Tony’s arm.
“I need you,” Howard snapped quickly, and he stepped forward again, coming closer and closer to Steve’s face, “gotta meet with a client. I’m not in a… they’ll want you more. Guy looks kinda queer anyway, so you’ll fit right in.”
“I can see why Tony loves you so much,” he said through a smile, before turning his head back to the little path they’d come down, “hey, I’m kinda hungry. We should get food after this.”
He could hear the wracking shudders of his own chest as it rattled against Steve’s; feel the shaking of his fingers as they curled into the fabric around Steve’s shoulders so hard that his knuckles turned white.
Steve looked pained, and his fingers tightened around Tony’s. “I don’t want to break up with you,” he said firmly. “We had an argument. I got angry. But I don’t want to break up with you, okay? Absolutely not.” He licked his lips and looked down for a brief moment. “I shouldn’t have left you to stew in it. I shouldn’t have stormed off like that, and I’m sorry.”
Rather than even bother answering, Tony just rolled his eyes and then pressed a delicate kiss into Steve’s cheek, rubbing their faces together lightly as he did so. Steve couldn’t help but gravitate back toward Tony’s touch, warm and real and there. “Don’t be stupid,” Tony told him softly, knocking his forehead against Steve’s, “I’m tired of being pissed-off. Now I just wanna be with you. That sound okay?” He leaned back and glanced at the bed, a pained look crossing his face when he saw the mess Steve had made of the bed.
been struggling, not at all, and that was the issue here. Out of the corner of his eye, he could see that Peter was leaning sideways in Thor’s arms, trying to grab Tony’s shirtsleeves. Thor shifted him away carefully, but Peter was not impressed by that and started to whimper, arms extended, asking for Tony. Because that was who wanted to hold him.
They’re just fine with that. In fact, life could throw pretty much anything at them, and they’d probably do alright with it.
off me,” Steve growled, yanking away as hard as he could against their hands as they tried to shove him backward. It wasn’t much use though- two versus one, and Steve wasn’t exactly fighting material, no matter how many times he managed to get into them.
He looked out of the window into the halls, mind drifting as it usually did when he was stuck in a classroom for too long. He thought about his art for a moment- allowed himself the guilty fantasy of one day having his own work up there, just like Tony had told him. If life wasn’t so fucking difficult to get a foothold on, and he had enough money to spare, he’d probably have tried to become an artist. He did love it, after all, and his mom had always been so supportive of the dream, no matter how silly it had been.
“Nuh uh,” Steve rocked them gently back and forth as he shook his head, “No covert cows, no aliens. Just us. Having some fun.”
“Mr. Rogers?” Came a quiet voice from beside him, and Steve promptly did a massive and violent spasm on the desk, scattering a bunch of papers as he shifted.
“I thought I’d lost you,” Steve whispered, eyes shutting in horror once more. “I thought I’d let you fall-”
Tony simply sighed, and then let his own head flop down on the pillow. “Remind me never to let any of you drink again,” he muttered as he closed his own eyes, “you quite clearly cannot be trusted.”
“Alright,” Rhodey clapped his hands, game-face on, “come on team—let’s go get my best friend back home.”
Tony huffed and nodded his head. “Yeah, he threw a spoon at me yesterday and then guffawed like he was about to attempt world domination. Little kid’s an asshole.”
“-then we stand a chance of getting an opening, yes,” Fury finished with another enthusiastic nod. He walked to Steve’s side and leaned against the desk, looking sideways at him. “He wouldn’t expect you. Last time you spoke, you were still under contract with the Army, and since we recruited you your records have been wiped clean. He doesn’t know you’re with us. He’d trust you. Your relationship ended on amicable terms, correct?”
Tony thought back to a few weeks ago, when they’d been fighting said aliens. “They were the ones who smelled all weird, weren’t they?” he asked with  a frown, and Bruce nodded his confirmation. “Ew. Didn’t like those guys.”
How the goddamn hell Tony had managed to make someone like Steve Rogers fall for him, he had no idea. “I love you too,” Tony replied earnestly, fingers fiddling nervously with Steve’s collar, “I’m sorry that I’m such a mess. I’ll try and be better in future.”
Tony let out an audible breath and then shoved him in annoyance, looking at Steve with a mixture of relief and irritation. “Oh my God, you bastard, I thought I’d ruined everyth-“
“Yeah, never better, Rogers,” he said, beginning to turn back away, “go back to class, alright? It’s all good. We’re cool. You did me a favor with Zeke a few days ago, I returned it. Now we’re even, yeah?”
He could hear them just the way Tony had spoken them, with the same inflections, the same pitch. Gift of the serum.
He thought it over for a few seconds. Then decided. “We’re splitting up,” he said, straightening his back, “I’ll stay up here. You and Thor get down to call for help.” At the look on their faces, he acknowledged that he was going to have to justify this, and so he raised his hands before either of them could interject. “Look, I’m not hurt, I have heightened senses, and I can hold my own. You’re right that we need backup for this, but if there’s even a chance that we can find them quickly then I can’t pass on it.”
When he bent down to curl a hand around the wipe, Steve noticed the back of his neck had turned red.
“We have the advantage of darkness,” she said, “we’ll keep quiet and we’ll pick them off before they can even reach the cabin.”
Steve smiled reassuringly, opening up his good hand and then finding Tony’s own, squeezing tight. “Sorry,” he whispered, “but I wasn’t gonna let it hit you, Tony. Anyway-
“When you say ‘you’ will make it, do you actually mean ‘google’ will make it and you will still end up getting it wrong anyway?” Steve responded, following him through into the kitchen with a tired smile on his face. Tony’s hoodie was warm from his body heat and smelled like Tony did, and it felt so nice that Steve couldn’t even complain about being coddled.
“This is for the best,” Tony said throatily, nodding his head once. Steve stilled, and then leaned away with the smallest of sighs, teeth tugging on his bottom lip as he watched Tony. “You should set some boundaries too, Steve. It’s the sensible thing to do.”
JARVIS paused for a moment. “This bag had already been packed for months, in case a situation such as this ever occurred.”
“I know,” Tony said quietly, looking away, “doesn’t mean I don’t know that it’s true.” He was quiet for a moment, before admitting, “I don’t think I’m okay, Steve. At all.”
His phone rang, finally, an hour later. Steve pulled it up to his ear as soon as he saw the contact name, breathing in a sigh of relief. “Tony,” he greeted, “you okay? How was detention?”
Tony’s jaw clenched, realising that Steve was actually considering this. “One in a million chance,” he said, “absolutely no scientific evidence that any of us could replicate that. Steve, you cannot be serious here. No. No, we’re not doing it.” He stood up from the sofa abruptly, Steve following him swiftly.
Steve looked between his friend and the soaking wet, muddy grave. “It’s fine, you’ll get filthy and your clothes are-“
be making all these connections.” Tony waved a hand jerkily, wondering why the hell he was getting so upset about this, but unwilling to stop himself either. He needed to get it out. It needed to be said.
Tony stopped again, and Steve knew what was coming next. The fall from grace- the descent into madness that inevitably came whenever you lost someone. He swallowed heavily and tilted his head, kissing Tony’s shoulder in the best offer of support he could manage. There was no way to make this any easier except showing he was there, really.
Pushing back experimentally, Steve traced the lines of Tony’s lip with his tongue and leaned onto his tiptoes, head tilting to the side as he stepped as far into Tony’s space as he could manage. It pulled a soft moan from the back of Tony’s throat, which of course just made everything more frantic and heated in Steve’s quickly-deteriorating thought process. He couldn’t stop his hands sweeping across Tony’s shoulders, his back, curling around his hips and taking in as much of him as he could manage as Tony breathed in sharply and then pushed again, until the back of Steve’s legs hit the desk with a sharp thud.
“Steve,” Tony laughed a little, stopping by the passenger seat of his car, “believe me, you do not know the half of what I think of you.”
The comment was a throwaway, and Tony was already moving across the room and grabbing his coat like what he’d just said hadn’t even held any weight.
“If I may,” JARVIS interjected, his voice sombre, “your funds may not be sufficient enough to pay for both accommodation and necessities, and considering you have not finished your full-time education, finding work may prove difficult.”
adventurous, I’ll get myself arrested. Finding a thrill wherever you can, right?” He shrugged, picking at a seam on his jeans. “It’s not really living. It’s just temporarily stopping me from dying, I guess. But it works, and I don’t- well, I
“Just tired,” he said with a smile before Steve could even bother to ask him what was wrong, “sorry, I’ll just… I’ll see you all back home, yeah? Have fun.”
“Yes,” the scientist breathed in the end, and something big and cavernous burst open in Steve’s chest at the confirmation, “you could… you’d eliminate the double-crossing of timelines. But Steve, you can’t do that. You would cease to exist—”
“Don’t think about it, sweetheart,” Tony told him soothingly, rocking them both back and forth in a constant motion, “just don’t think about it. Not right now. I’m sorry that I scared you. I’m sorry I didn’t realize that was where you were coming from after, either. I’m a bit of an asshole, if you hadn’t noticed- tend to get a little self centred if I’m left to my own devices.” He laughed lightly and then cupped his hand around the back of Steve’s sweaty neck, his grip firm and grounding. “But I’m here now, alright? And I’m not leaving. I promise.”
Clint just snorted. “Of course you can. Give him your Tony-Face, maybe promise him a blowie, and he’ll be right over-“
"Okay, so I'm not the only one who's seeing this, right?" Clint blurted, pointing a finger at the small mass cradled in Tony's arms, "there is definitely a baby person there."
“He does,” she told him, and her voice was uncharacteristically gentle, “as soon as we told him what had happened, he wanted to see you. To check on you.”
Steve was half inclined to disagree- to let him stay and see if he was half as big as he thought he was- but as soon as he opened his mouth Tony glared at him fiercely, and so Steve shut his mouth with a small click and a heavy breath.
He had Steve, and he loved Steve, and he was never going to stop that, and everything else could be worked out.
“You do that,” Steve muttered to no one in particular, kicking a stray sock across the room and then throwing himself back down face-first onto the bed.
“What was yours?” Steve asked, if only to waste a bit more time- he really wasn’t in the mood to be yelled at- he’d got enough of that at his old school.
His mind drifted to the left hand curled against Tony’s waist and the ring finger attached to it, empty and bare. That wasn’t right. Tony needed to fix that, at some point. Then everything really would be perfect.
Steve paused at that, and Tony looked at him warily, wondering if that was too far. He and Steve had been officially dating for a month and four days now, which wasn’t a lot, in normal standards. But neither of them had ever actually been in a relationship before, and- well. Tony wasn’t lying. He
Steve knew that the look on his face gave away his excitement at that prospect. It was a little known fact that Tony was actually a highly skilled musician as well as inventor, and the first time Steve had become aware of said fact (Monday morning on the 14
Down below, curled up in a ball near his feet and surrounded by a veritable nest of pillows, Bruce simply punched him on the back of the knee and then rolled over, hand reaching out blindly for his phone, which Thor slid away every time his fingers got close. Steve watched the interaction in amusement for a few minutes, and then laughed when Bruce finally opened his eyes and saw what Thor was doing, which, of course, resulted in a (short) wrestling match that had Thor sitting on the other boy less than three seconds later.
She raised her eyebrows and then her hands followed in a show of surrender. “Alright, alright- my lips remain firmly shut.”
Steve swallowed, and Tony turned to him properly, frown marking his forehead for the dozenth time. He sighed. “Steve, seriously- if you’d rather I just call you a cab, that’s f-”
Cameras were down, but JARVIS could still read the heat signatures as they got closer. There was one significantly hotter than the others, which Tony was going to go ahead and presume was the Pyro. The other signatures that were above average had to be the other Enhanced. There were four of them.
Once the ice had melted and Tony had managed to rationalise the situation a little better in his head, Steve took his hand and led Tony back to the bedroom where they fucked, Steve keeping it soft and gentle like it was an apology. Still, though, Tony couldn’t say he was feeling particularly into it. But he didn’t really want to say no- especially not when he was in such a vulnerable position. Steve didn’t really
He stared in bafflement. “I- I guess we’d go fifty-fifty? Or I pay for it when I take him out, he pays when he takes m-“
Steve chuckled beside him. What with him being a literal giant, his position was even more uncomfortable than Tony’s- not that he seemed to care. “It depends what we’re going for. You can play the long game, try and win but risk facing boredom. Or you can live fast and lose quick by constantly moving hiding spots. More thrilling, but riskier.”
“What, boyfriends?” Tony asked, eyes beginning to get a little wider with every confused blink, “I… yeah, that’s what I was… oh, do you- is that
Bruce bit his lip and looked away, and Steve knew what that meant. He didn’t know what Steve should do either. “You should just… go in and see him, for now,” he said quietly, “but prepare yourself, okay? Steve, we all know it wasn’t your fault, but… it doesn’t look good. He’s been through a lot.”
Silence filled the room, Steve looking at Tony in horror, Tony staring right back, mouth pursed into a thin line. His hands were fisted on the table, knuckles white, straining. “Course, the media saw me flying in and out, saw the explosion, put two and two together,” he continued after a moment, sniffing briefly and shrugging a shoulder, “I became the world’s number one bad-guy, and my image was forever tainted. Worked better that way, though. Easier to excuse my seemingly random attacks on government facilities.” He raised an eyebrow to Steve, waving the hand shackled to the table. “Believe me?” He asked.
He remembered Tony’s eyes when he’d told Steve that if he hit him, he would leave. He remembered the despair when Steve had gone and broken his rib anyway. The numb way Tony had greeted him the next morning, quiet and defeated and nothing like the man Tony Stark usually was.
Another long silence stretched between all of them. Steve took Tony’s hand—shaking, again—and held on tight, feeling the other boy squeeze back just as hard.
, Steve. So if you’re not one of them, which I hope to God you’re not, then please, watch your back. They’re planning something. Something b—”
“I’ve never seen so much effort put into a blanket fort before,” Steve said, awed. The biggest fort he’d made had been using the furniture in his living room, and he’d been seven. It had consisted of one blanket and a handful of pillows. “How did you make the blankets keep their shape?”
He shut his mouth after that, unwilling to say more. Nothing else was left to be said, anyway. He knew what he’d done. Tony knew what he’d done. And no words could make that go away. It had been a breach of trust on the most intimate of levels. Steve had used him like he meant nothing; a means to an end. In truth, Tony was so, so far from that. But Tony had no reason to believe any of Steve’s truths anymore.
“Scan is complete,” JARVIS called out immediately, and Steve jerked again, “Mr Rogers is suffering from a minor concussion, one broken rib, and multiple abrasions to his midsection. No fatal damage. Recovery time: 2 months.”
Steve made a noise of discontent into Tony’s hair as Peter started to babble and bang his rattle in the cot, and Tony was quick to follow, blinking awake with a look of mild disgust on his face as his gaze fell upon the time. “I hate mornings,” he said dejectedly, sinking back into Steve’s arms, “how long do you think it’ll be before he starts crying?”
“You do realise that we can’t just keep him here, right?” Natasha asked, leaning forward, “we don’t have another choice. Social services are trained to deal with this-“
“I’m afraid we have evidence to suggest that the child is still in the building,” Michael informed them, stepping forward again. Surreptitiously, Tony placed his hand on Steve’s back and held him in place, stopping him from immediately responding and marching up to meet the other man. Steve swallowed, but then consciously relaxed at Tony’s touch.
Everything was okay. Steve was Steve again, and any lingering second’s worth of fear Tony was still harbouring whenever the other man walked into a room alone with him was going to go away once they
“You keep saying he does it all for Thor’s benefit,” Steve told him somewhat coldly, “but then also seem adamant that Thor doesn’t care about you. So either Tony gives a shit or Thor does, yet you’re convinced it’s neither.”
He shook himself, concentrating on the task at hand as Tony began to explain over Steve’s shoulder. He saw those pesky hands start up; rising from his lap to begin waving around, and on instinct, Steve grabbed for them- he needed to ice the red knuckles.
There was a short pause, and then Ty laughed. He took another step forward. “I think I’m starting to get really sick of you. Walking around here like you fucking own the place, taking Tony away from us and trying to keep him all to yourself. Acting like you care about him for anything other than the same reasons anyone else does.”
The door slammed open beneath them and they heard Clint scream “NOT ME, PLEASE, STEVE AND TONY ARE IN THE VENTS, GET THEM INSTEAD!”
But never say Tony couldn’t rise to the challenge. He knew how to work a crowd- even a preteen one, thank you very much.
Silence fell. Distantly, Steve heard the clock ticking—eleven minutes past eleven. He thought about wishing. But his mind was too full, and the idea didn’t settle.
Steve pouted, looking up at Tony and then scowling. “I thought I won that argument,” he said moodily.
Nothing particularly shocking, if he was being honest. In some way or another, Tony was always at least partially exhausted, if not physically, then certainly mentally. He had a busy life. He was an Avenger. These things were to be expected. But he hadn’t really been sleeping too great as of late, and after two weeks of unrestful nights, it was starting to take a toll on him.
“Steve, that’s great! What is it you’re drawing- you said you’d used to just do still life and your friends, yes? Are you back to that? I bet Bucky was happy to become a model again.”
“It’s very misleading hair! Too- too blonde. And perfect.” Tony’s nose wrinkled a little, and Steve sat up indignantly, running a hand self-consciously through the too-long strands that fell limply over his forehead. It had dried funny, and he could feel the stupid kinks that had formed in the process, making him look like an idiot, no doubt-
They ate their breakfast Slash lunch together with the team amicably, Tony tracing absent patterns into Steve’s hand whilst he chewed inattentively at his toast, and Steve reading the day’s paper. They were the only pair still in their pajamas, having decided there was no need for them to change out of them that day, and Steve grinned fondly every time he glanced sideways and saw the little cartoon shields that were dotted all over Tony’s oversized sweatshirt. Tony had admitted to him once, that he’d used to have a Captain America shield tattooed on his hip when he’d been younger- a drunken dare from Rhodey that he’d never bothered to remove until Steve had actually been pulled out of the ice. Steve mourned at the fact he’d never been able to see it for himself- he was man enough to admit that the sight of Tony wearing something of
He resisted the urge to breathe out in relief, instead just pursing his mouth and thanking his lucky stars that the words were still there. That Steve still felt that way about him, even when Tony had let him down.
“Right. But you look tired, Steve, are you sure that’s a good idea? You should be well rested if we’re going out to fight again.”
Steve should have made him leave. Should have tried harder to get him to just go. Fuck, he should never have gotten confrontational with Stone in the fucking first place, he’d
Another brittle laugh, and then, “You ask me to ‘tell me you need me’, but I don’t. i don’t need you. In the same way heroin addicts don’t need another fix, or I don’t need a coffee in the morning. I don’t fucking ‘need’ you- but I sure as hell wouldn’t know how to survive without you.”
He wasn’t sure what stopped him, really. Maybe it was because Thor was looking at him as if he just needed someone to talk to, about anything at all. Maybe because Thor had helped Steve before even knowing him, at a party full of people that were more worth his time than Steve had been. Maybe it was just because Thor was a friend, and Steve really didn’t want to have to deal with this on his own right now.
“I am, yes. Because there is not a lot I can’t do when I put my mind to it, and Tony Stark, I would move heaven and Earth to make sure you never suffered like that. Never again.”
“I… assume it is something to do with him being unsure of the nature or boundaries within your relationship, after everything that happened.”
“People say it’s super haunted,” Tony explained as they walked through the musty corridors; Steve looking around in a mix of awe and curiosity as he stared at the place, “it hasn’t been lived in for like, 70 years. Abandoned in the war, I think. The haunting stuff’s bull, though,” he added helpfully, “I’ve been here in the witching hour. No ghosts as far as I could tell. But if it stops people buying the place, it’s fine by me.”
Tony stopped at the door of the living room. He looked down and smiled. “Perks of being a billionaire, Rogers,” he said softly; the same thing he’d said that night at the party, when he’d clicked a finger and cleared a room- everyone seemed to caught up in the dollar signs that surrounded him, it was actually…
“We’ve got a situation,” Fury said immediately, the tone of his voice implying something serious, “Barnes checked in with us last night. Says he had an altercation with another of HYDRA’s assets while he was on a stakeout in Prague.”
Tony looked away, shaking his head. “I tried. I didn’t… there were just so many other things going on in my head and I wanted to go back and find you, and I was- I was on edge from what had just happened, and I couldn’t focus and so I had to make Howard step back in and take it while I left.” Tony laughed humourlessly. “He’s gonna fucking kill me for that later.”
Except, well- Bruce could probably do all this and more. There were some incredible minds over at SHIELD, too, despite what Tony said- he’d heard of a team called Fitzsimmons and knew they were some of the brightest minds of the century. And Hank Pym, that guy was affiliated with SHIELD too- if the Avengers needed to, they could probably convince him to come in.
Tony huffed, laying his head back down on the bed. “They’ve taken Iron Man away from me,” he said, swallowing down the lump in his throat and smiling, “they fucking…I can’t even
“There’s nothing solid yet,” Fury told him tersely, “he’s too smart to leave a trail. But the whispers alone are enough to warrant a search, at the very least. Even without Iron Man as his excuse—buying weapons-grade plutonium? Hiring out mercenaries with known kill-counts?” The Director’s face managed to look sympathetic for a second as he watched Steve. “There’s something dirty going on, Rogers. Whatever you knew of Tony before… he’s changed. Something’s gone wrong.”
There was a crackling noise, and then Thor’s booming voice came over the intercom. “Steve!” He cheered, whilst a few other voices joined in the chorus. “Come on up, I’m on the top floor.”
, Steve,” he said placatingly, “I don’t usually get drunk enough at those sorts of things to be vulnerable anymore, and I can always call the suit. You don’t need to worry. But I promise I’ll call next time, okay?”
Except maybe Peter. Tony should probably stay close to him for a little while, if only to stop AIM from getting their filthy hands on him.
Ty shook his head and then pushed himself off the wall, marching over to Steve with his whole body tensed up and his arm rising into an arc. Steve stepped forward too- if Ty wanted to fight, then they could fight, Steve wasn’t fucking bothered. He could give as good as he got, thank you very much, and that was what he fully intended to do as he raised his own arm and then reeled it back, preparing to swing.
something. It doesn’t have to be expensive. Get him something related to an inside joke, or something that you know is important to him. It don’t gotta be no diamond ring. Tony doesn’t give a shit about that and you know it.”
“Mr. Rogers, we’ve arrived at the scene,” JARVIS’ voice alerted him, and Steve looked up, craning his head to see the ground below from the window in the cockpit of Tony’s strange futuristic jet. He spotted Tony almost immediately; a red and gold haze whizzing through the air, trying to land a hit on a silver, humanoid robot about five times’ Iron Man’s size. The thing seemed to be protected by some sort of energy barrier, however, and Tony wasn’t getting through to it. Steve grabbed the controls and then did a quick circle of the scene, checking for remaining civilians. It seemed fairly empty, but a fair few of the buildings in the area had already been levelled. Who knew how many had gotten lost under the rubble?
Steve turned and looked at him from over his shoulder, watching Tony’s eyes begin to slide shut as his head fell back onto the pillow.
Tony looked panicked as he flicked his eyes around the room, landing on Steve just for a moment before slipping away immediately. “I- I- uh-“
Steve followed Reed as the man guided him back into the elevator he had come from. “Go back to bed, love,” Richards murmured quietly to his wife as they moved past her.
“Do you want to come to my birthday party?” Steve asked. Well- blurted, really- it wasn’t the most graceful of propositions.
and Steve had been sat on the couch sketching and now- now Tony couldn’t feel him breathe. His heart wasn’t beating.
No, no. They still had time. They still had… it’d be fine. Tony was thin, he was injured, but he’d be okay. He could walk through hell and be okay, that was just who Tony was. Steve nodded to himself, and maybe everyone else thought that was finally some sort of acknowledgement that Tony might not be coming home, but they were wrong. It was Steve promising himself that he
“Six months, if my memory serves correctly,” one of the seemingly older guys said, looking at Tony with a grin as he patted him fondly on the back, “it was near the New Year, when all our families got together for that retreat, right? Nice to see you, Tones. You’ve dropped off the radar a bit recently- we were getting worried.”
it hit him one day like a freight train. Like a brick wall. Like… like a very heavy thing, hitting him very very hard.
Zeke just laughed, but the way he folded his arms defensively and backed up a few steps showed the truth. He quite obviously didn't fancy the thought of that. "The day I'll be scared of some worthless, drugged-up whore is the day hell freezes over," he spat, before turning on his heel and shoving through the crowd.
Tony grinned and then leaned forward to access the bag of onions in the cupboard underneath where he was sat. He waved them around. “You’ll have to work for them,” he informed the other boy, winking when Steve cocked his head, “and I warn you; don’t get side-tracked nearly as easy as—”
Peter stared vacantly up at Clint for a moment, before reaching out and grabbing his nose with an intrigued ‘phlrb’ sound. Tony just sighed fondly and turned back to his coffee. Clint sure loved to exaggerate, but most likely it was just one of Petey’s little sounds that he’d decided was definite proof that Peter was—
, God, you whisk me off to Ohio when I’m upset and you chop wood with your shirt off just ‘cause you know I like it, and it’s been years now but I just—every day you do something that’ll surprise me, that’ll make me laugh. I fall more and more in love with every moment.” He chuckled and then tipped his head forward, burying it into Steve’s shoulder. “That was horrendously sappy, I know, but it needed to be said.”
But then Tony had turned around, looking at Steve intently as his hands rose and gently framed the sides of the helmet. Softly, Steve watched him through the tinted visor as Tony lifted it off his head. He blinked from the sunlight that hit him, before focusing back in on Tony. Now holding the helmet in between two hands, he was looking a little spaced out- eyes focused somewhere near Steve’s mouth.
Steve shook his head. “Tony, this is—fuck, this is so classified, just me being here is probably putting you in danger—I just, you were the closest person to Nevada that I could trust, and I—”
“Oh, come on, I built her from scratch, she won’t crash.” Tony laughed sheepishly and then pouted at Steve when he just pushed him again, not exactly getting him very far considering he weighed about half of what Tony did, but still- it was the sentiment that counted. “I’m sorry. I promise I’ll wear it next time I ride.”
“Who was the man,” Steve heard himself asking, his voice flat, “the man who killed him- what was his motive?”
“How is this the right call- what if he comes back up there and sees I’m missing and then completely breaks down, huh? I have to go b-“
They both laughed a little, looking at one another and shrugging. “He’s not far off, really,” Rhodey admitted with a shrug, “we can accept making a few enemies if it means there’s one less asshole poking around in Tony’s life.”
“Well,” Clint said, breaking the heavy silence as he hopped onto the counter and wiped the blood off his face, “I take it social services are out now, then?”
"Shut up, that's the name he was given by his original owners," Steve snapped before he could finish, "we didn't see it until the blankets came off."
But here, all there was was Steve, his nose brushing Tony’s, his hand splayed across Tony’s back, looking down at him with a bitten lip and a vulnerable expression on his achingly perfect face.
Tony glared at him, the theme-song of My Little Pony starting up again in the background. Tony was breathing heavily, mouth open like he was going to say something. But it wouldn’t come, and so he settled for looking away and stepping back. “I’m gonna go put Maria to bed,” he said blankly, clearly finished with this conversation as he turned away, “don’t wait up for me.”
Tony couldn’t help it; he burst into laughter, looking between Steve’s incredulous expression and Peter’s delighted one. They were probably gonna pay for this tomorrow when Peter was cranky for the whole day, but in that moment, he couldn’t care less. Peter was
They shared dessert, obviously, seeing as that was the one meal they could agree on. Warm chocolate fudge brownie and salted caramel ice-cream, because Steve had a sweet-tooth a mile wide and Tony just liked listening to the noises he made when he took the first mouthful. Positively sinful.
"Well, I'm sure if you asked Clint nicely-" Steve began innocently, looking over to Bucky and then laughing just before he got a faceful of couch cushion in retaliation.
“Leave your face like that for too long and it’ll stick,” someone said in front of him, and he glanced up with a weary smile at Steve as the man slipped in through the door.
“Can I stay here for a bit,” Steve asked mutely, standing tense in front of him. Tony frowned, sitting up a little and then extending a hand automatically. Steve took it, ridiculously grateful for the contact of warm skin against warm skin.
They both got ready quickly- or at least, as quickly as they could manage whilst in the company of one another and wearing minimal amounts of clothes. So all things considered, an hour was pretty good.
All three of their friends just stared at them blankly for a moment. “Huh?” Bruce blurted, “for real?” When they both nodded at him, he blinked rapidly before breaking out into a fond little smile. “Damn, guys, that’s great. I’m really happy for you.”
He considered the night ahead of them, free for the first time in what felt like decades. No getting soaked from bath-time or spending an hour just trying to put a baby down to sleep. No bickering over who had to get up and take the morning shift while the other slept in. No, tonight, the rest of the team were in charge of the night-shift, leaving Steve and Tony in blissful peace.
He paused, looking over to the man as he sat on the chair and pointedly kept his eyes on the others. They all glanced somewhat smugly to eachother, but began to rise all the same. “Yeah, yeah, we’ll give you some space,” Bucky said with an exaggerated wink. “We just wanted to be there when you woke up, so we could set that dumb head’a yours straight. Now we done that, we’re probably gonna go back home for the night. That okay?” He asked, and when Tony nodded, Bucky clapped him delicately on his good shoulder and smiled, leaning down a little. “Tell him to stop rambling if he starts going off on a tangent, and don’t let him change the subject,” he whispered into Tony’s ear, which Steve obviously heard but chose to ignore. Tony just looked at him curiously, head cocked as Bucky saluted and strolled out of the door. The rest of the team followed with goodbye pats and kisses to the forehead, until it was just Steve and Tony, alone in the room.
“I don’t think you’re crazy, Steve,” Tony assured, him, fingers working on the knots in Steve’s shoulders as he spoke. “Why were you able to sleep last night, then? What changed?”
. He was self-aware enough to know that that was not what the team wanted to hear, and would probably only make them more intent on staying.
then proceeded to ignore him for what Tony had declared ‘the rest of the night’ but was actually ‘until I got bored waiting’- which turned out to be four minutes.
Anyway, they noticed it immediately. Natasha just raised an eyebrow, but Clint was an asshole, so Clint wolf-whistled and jostled Steve’s shoulder, making him turn from where he was busily preparing his breakfast in order to look in their direction. Tony, still pretty much sleepwalking at that point, just tried to zoom in on the coffee and direct his body toward it. He doesn’t notice everyone staring, or Steve’s progressively reddening cheeks.
Steve looked down at their hands, watching Tony lift away and brush his fingertips over the back of Steve’s palm, trailing over his knuckles, joints- carefully stroking around Steve’s ring finger, just for a second before sliding away again. They both smiled, lost in the thoughts of a million different things.
He jumped, turning to look at the voice that spoke from somewhere behind him. It took him a moment to process the face, but he got there in the end. “Doctor Cho,” he said dumbly, before the sudden deluge of memories came back to him. “The Avengers,” he breathed out, eyes widening and heart beginning to race, “are they—”
Steve burst out laughing and wrapped his arms around Tony’s lower back, leaning up to kiss his nose. “I would last two minutes and then break everything you own out of boredom, sweetheart, you know me.”
Steve had no idea what Tony was saying, except that there was a please in there at the end, and so just kissed his cheek comfortingly and squeezed his knee. “Just give us a minute, let us get your shoulder sorted, ‘kay?” Thor settled his big hands around Tony’s bicep and scapula, and Tony’s head tilted toward them nervously. Steve curled his hand around Tony’s jaw and tipped him back toward Steve, smiling at him with feigned confidence. “Hey. Look at me for a second. Don’t concentrate on Thor right now, just look at me.”
Fair point. Tony rolled his eyes and then bent down, hands going under those fat little arms as he lifted Peter up and then raised his eyebrows at the boy. "You know how much work I got done today?" He asked solemnly, giving the baby his most disappointed look as he made a circle with his fingers. "Zero. Nothing. That's your fault, you good-for-nothing vagabond."
He took a breath, steadied himself. Reached for the coffee pot and then grabbed the bottle of whiskey that he always kept next to it, because if he couldn’t treat himself today, when the hell could he?
“What did he even do to piss his dad off so much?” The dark haired boy asked after a few seconds of silence. “He’s been caught doing some pretty fucked up stuff and gotten away with it without… this happening.”
He spent the rest of the journey up to the communal floor arguing with JARVIS over the nutritional values of said hot-pockets, eventually appeasing the AI when he begrudgingly agreed to eat a piece of real fruit alongside his late-afternoon snack. Tony admitted that the guy might have a point. Tomorrow was training exercise day, which meant he should probably carb-load or something, in order to make sure he didn’t suffer cardiac arrest when Steve decided to make him run a marathon in the armour or whatever it was that sadist had planned.
Tony paused, and then just shrugged, looking down at his screen. His shoulders were a little tense though. “That’s… just what everyone else says. Said. Whatever-“
Tony’s hand found Steve’s free one. Steve gripped it tight. He couldn’t decide which one of them was shaking- probably both.
. He hadn’t been paying too much attention to the dates when Tony had spoken about it- too busy having a little crisis over the fact that Tony had pretty much asked him out to notice the when and where of it all.
“Can we reverse it?” He’d asked, pretending as if his voice hadn’t been wavering with each word. “Please tell me I can get it all back, Bruce.”
“I’m not going to go and jump off a god damn bridge,” Steve growled, and his fist bent the doorknob as it curled tighter and tighter, “I need fresh air, and I need— I need to be alone.
Rhodey’s eyes were serious as he turned to Steve again. They looked at each other for a moment, and then Steve nodded once. He felt like some sort of mantle had just been unconsciously passed to him. “I promise,” he said firmly, which seemed to be good enough for Rhodey, because his shoulders dropped a little bit and he relaxed, turning away once more with a wave of his hand. Steve watched him all the way to his car before closing the door in front of him and then just sighing tiredly.
He didn’t even want to know what Steve must have been thinking of him, in that moment. Of all the things that the team had gone through- Natasha in the Red Room, Bruce running from the whole world for years, Steve having lived through
“Tony!” He called out to the figure as he wandered down the corridors and tapped a knuckle against each locker. “Tony, wait up!”
There was a short silence, the three men all staring at one another. Steve swallowed down the panic and tried to focus, but all he could see was the way Tony had looked when he’d gone down earlier in the fight. He’d been too far away and Steve had been too preoccupied with fending off three different attackers, and so he hadn’t even been able to call out to him. He could only watch, horror-stricken as the bomb had gone off, and then listen to Tony’s following scream.
Maybe Tony had lost the human version of Jarvis in that car crash. But he’d put a new soul into that machine in front of them, and now the essence of what had made that man so amazing lived on through the machine.
Everyone gravitated toward the table, where a holographic screen popped up, showing a rather graphic image of what was a very dead woman, two gunshots to her chest, sat splayed out in a pool of her own blood in a bathroom. Tony winced. “Who is this?”
DUM-E beeped curiously at him as he threw himself angrily onto his desk chair and switched on his computer. At one point, he’d tried taking the stuff out of the trash, and Tony had had to yell at him. He’d apologised a few seconds later, but now DUM-E seemed to be rolling around the room a little more cautiously. Tony knew he was going to have to give the bot a good oiling before he stopped being sulky.
Steve just laughed and rolled his eyes, sinking back into the couch. “Yeah,” he mumbled, “you do that.”
But Tony didn’t respond, just hopped off the bed and then hunkered down, opening the suitcase that they hadn’t bothered to unpack yet. He shuffled around for a minute while Steve watched him with one cracked-open eye, until he eventually found what he was looking for and held it up triumphantly, looking at Steve with a big smile on his face. Steve sat up and watched Tony trek across the room, where he put his sobriety coin carefully back in its box on their dresser. Then, when he crawled back into a bed a few moments after, Steve made sure to squeeze him just a little bit tighter as his arms wrapped around the other man once more.
Steve laughed, tilting his head down and then kissing Tony’s cheek. “Reminds me of someone,” he said in amusement, and Tony made an offended noise in the back of his throat.
“NO!” Everyone yelled again, and Tony laughed, fingers dancing over the smooth gold band that circled his finger.
Without waiting another second, Steve got slowly to his feet and made his way to the door. Just as his hand curled around the handle, however, it was pulled open for him, and Steve looked on in surprise at Sam’s impatient face as he was tugged from the living room and then pushed through corridor hurriedly, until landing his feet on the other side of the room to Tony.
Pops laughed again, and let go to ruffle his hair, a twinkle in his eye. “You asked for it, Pete- we’re gonna be the old folks who yell at pesky teens from their porch. We’ll still be making out in public places when both of us are wrinkly and ancient, and everyone will think we’re cute old people who prove that love last foreverrrr-”
Tony hummed. So that was adhesive abilities and now superstrength too. He wondered what else the kid was hiding up his sleeve. “Why was he hitting you in the first place? Thought Thor might have calmed him down by now.”
Steve just stared at her, breath coming short. He must have looked unhinged, stood there in his sweatpants and loose shirt stained with flecks of his blood, the shattered remains of the ground-level window of the Baxter Building behind him. He wondered if she was scared.
. Gone. Steve could deal with his own shit alone, obviously, despite the fact that it was Steve who was stranded in Tony’s fucking house for five fucking hours.
Tony at least had the decency to look a little sheepish. “I may have been…slightly presumptuous, yes, but in all fairness, this is barely even illegal. No one’s even been in the house for years except me.”
ready, but they just kept missing their shot. It was difficult to get an empty house, difficult to find the time, and it definitely seemed like Steve was waiting for Tony to make the first move for whatever reason, so it was also a question of Tony trying to get up the courage to take that step. Which was admittedly a little easier said than done. Although Tony had often been propositioned at various events and shows for StarkIndustries, he’d always ended up saying no, and it wasn’t like you got much action when you were homeschooled, so he’d never actually had sex with anyone before. But he knew that Steve had, and that it’d been with a variety of Unhumans who had various…
It was soft and silent and perfect, and Steve let his spare hand trail aimlessly over the soft curls of Tony’s hair as they lay there on the thick grass in the dead of night. Honestly, they probably needed to talk about a few things that had changed tonight.
He looked down just as Tony walked back into the main corridor, shoving his arm through the sleeve of his standard leather jacket. Again, Steve briefly cursed the unfairness of the world, because Tony’s hair hadn’t been touched since coming out of the shower and yet it seemed to have dried perfectly, as always. Maybe he was just biased, though- it was difficult to tell these days.
“I didn’t mean to get so angry,” Steve told him softly, a thumb brushing across Tony’s cheek, “I just... I worry. You’re out there and you’re drunk, and you have a lot of enemies-”
“Shut the fuck up, Tony,I’m not in the mood, just… shut up,” Steve hissed,fingers tapping constantly against the counter, fast and erratic and completely unlike him.
“I’m still mad at you, by the way,” Dad said, but there wasn’t any heat to it, and he smiled a little as Pops looked rather sheepish and nodded. “I do like the thought of us being gross old people who make out in front of everyone, though.”
Here, now, he didn’t have time for the self-deprecation. He looked at the large machine in front of him and quietly analysed it, mentally broke it down, figured out how to get it to work. He knew that there were about ten other people on the planet capable of that. One of them was quietly unconscious about fifteen feet behind him. It ultimately wasn’t that hard, however. There was a pad on the side of the metal frame, and a screen directly above. Date, time, coordinates. The Tescillians were a diverse race, and so after a few minutes Steve located the microphone that processed his speech and consequently began translating all the numerals and letters into English. After a brief search on his phone, he found the coordinates of the street.
He took a deep breath, and then when that failed to calm him, he settled with grabbing the nearest mug and throwing it across the room, trying to expel all his anger out in the shards that flew out from impact. “Steve. I love you more than I ever thought I could ever love anything or anyone, and I will for the rest of my life. And I fucking
Thor saw him as he began moving through the room. “Thank God,” he said with a choked-off noise in the back of his throat, turning back to the couch and smiling, “hey Tony, Steve’s here now.”
Tony swallowed, feeling something sting the back of his eyes as he looked out of the window. He shrugged. “I’m really not,” he muttered, “you’ve got Rhodey for missions. SHIELD labs for designs. The Tower is yours- you all own equal shares. I… God, I’m just a fucking asshole.” He laughed miserably, feeling a lump form in his throat as his breath caught. “What the hell would you even want me to stay around for, let’s be honest. I’m stubborn and rude and I don’t know how to maintain any of my fucking relationships.”
He stared up at the ceiling, and couldn’t help but be glad about it, in a roundabout sort of way. Yeah, he was going to hate himself in the morning- but damn, did it make a nice change from doing nothing all day and then heading to bed at six.
Tony considered carrying on the bickering for a little while longer, but Steve’s mouth was right there, soft and gorgeous, and as much as he loved listening to Steve talk, he much preferred feeling Steve kiss him. So he just shrugged, muttered, “Guilty,” and then wound his hand around the back of Steve’s neck to pull him in again.
“Get a room!” Peggy yelled, whilst Tony got a pillow in the back of the head from Peggy. Steve was half tempted to take Tony and do exactly that, but Tony broke off before he could suggest it, and threw the pillow right back in Peggy’s face, which of course, ended up in full-scale war.
He raised his hands in surrender, and then caught Bucky's eyes again just before hearing his best friend mutter a quick "yet," and then scramble to his feet quickly before Peggy could take a swipe at him. Steve just watched them both in amusement as she chased him around the living room for a second, and then tackled him to the floor as soon as she had him in her sights. He winced on Bucky's behalf- when Peggy went in, she didn't go in soft.
