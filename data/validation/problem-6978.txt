Maybe when that happened he would stop the stupid, childish, desperate hope that Captain America would find something about him to like.
STAR didn't have any trouble keeping up though. She butted into the conversation with ease, earning a bigger smile from Winter. When she came to hover in front of the man's face, he lifted one hand and offered it to her in invitation. With an unbearably smug air - Shellhead had liked her first and now Winter did too - she took it and landed delicately on his palm.
drunk when I finished Dum-E, to the point where I hardly remember doing it, and when I was working on U I had a minor coke problem, and Butterfingers is the most normal of any of them and he's still always stealing shit so clearly I fucked up somehow. But you don't... you treat them like, you know. People. Really excitable and possibly dumb people, but still. You talk
"I certainly don't think so. If you had given them each their own floor," she added, making Tony's cheeks burn as he silently vowed to
, and he was so sincere and earnest that it kind of hurt. People did not get like that over him, not really. But Captain America was. Howard's long-lost friend and hero, the one who could never, ever find a single redeeming quality in someone like Tony, seemed like maybe he wanted to be friends.
And Steve...God, Steve. The blond always seemed to be touching him now that they both knew it was allowed. Sometimes he wanted to just sink into his arms and bask in the warmth of the man forever. But was it really affection, or was Steve just as touch-starved as Tony sometimes got? He'd had almost a century of going without any contact at all - sure he'd been frozen, but it still counted. Probably. And he was weird about who was allowed to touch him in non-battle situations. Tony and the other Avengers were fine, but once he'd clocked a SHIELD agent for grabbing his arm without warning. So it was more than possible that he wasn't really... well. That he was just getting what he needed where he could. Maybe the fact that Steve was getting so much of that from Tony didn't mean anything at all.
dead unless someone wanted to send Howard into a spiral of rage and grief - had been an intrinsic part of young Tony's life. When it wasn't Howard telling the stories it was Aunt Peggy or one of the Howling Commandos. Even Jarvis knew every one and repeated them over and over. When he was a kid, back before he had understood it all, Tony had begged for those stories, had
"Pops? Breathe." A steadying hand rested between his shoulder blades, and Harley's concerned eyes were suddenly in front of his."This ain't a bad thing! Nobody's mad or nothin', okay? I just... I just figured one of ya should know."
"It means that because your dumb butt was too busy wallowing and getting a new boyfriend to call, I had to take drastic action."
He didn't look up to read the room because he could feel the weight of their disapproval and judgement settling on his shoulders. Pepper and Tiny Adorable Steve especially would be frustrated, but what else was he supposed to
"I know. But you get the cutest little crinkle around your eyes when you don't know if you're irritated or amused by me."
"Permission to fly in the suit without getting the Air Force called on me. Same for Harley if he wants to hang there with us."
"Yeah well. There isn't anyone more qualified unless you're hiding someone in one of those big purses you like to tote around on the weekends that you think no one knows about, so--"
"Tried ta be. For your sake, mostly. I left ya - had ta try'n make it worth it. Don't think it really was."
was ready to enact justice until he was strong enough to do it for himself. Pepper's hand found it's way between his shoulder blades, warm and strong, and it helped calm his breathing and steady his heart. None of them would let him get hurt again, and he had the sneaking suspicion that if he even so much as hinted that he wanted them... the Defenders would be down here within heartbeats.
Then I refuse to further discuss Ultron with you. If you have genuine questions about SI's work to protect our planet--
little thread, but there's another one where you decided not to show up and another one where FRIDAY didn't even ask you to meet me and one where I didn't mess everything
Steve gave him a warm, sweet smile before tucking his face against his neck. "I am home, ya goof. You're here, ain't ya?"
"This ain't your world!" Steve burst out, red-faced from embarrassment at being caught out. "And we didn't want ya worryin' over somethin' ya couldn't change--"
He didn’t wait for an answer and deftly evaded Probably-Nathan’s arm when it shot out to try and stop them. His arm stayed around Tony while he led them away to the bar, hand wrapped around Tony’s hip in a tighter hold than usual. They’d walked like that often, but he had never felt any real intent behind the gesture. Now it felt like Steve was claiming him in front of everyone, and wow did he need to calm the fuck down.
“You’re a good friend.” Steve’s breath was still fluttering over his ear, and fuck - did the blond not realize how close he was? He couldn’t know what that was doing to Tony or he’d yank back in disgust, so he needed to get his damned libido under control.
"Months." He couldn't help but start laughing which put a pleased light in Tony's eyes. A few moments later he pressed his mouth to Steve's in a clinging kiss before settling that dark head of hair on his shoulder again. "You think I'm kidding, which is adorable."
"Hey," the Captain greeted softly, awkward and handsome in a way only he seemed to be able to manage. "JARVIS said you guys were up here."
"Mm-hmm." After a second, her head turned Tony's way and he was stupidly relieved that she was talking to him again. She had stopped responding about half an hour before he and Steve had left for the compound. "We left Dum-E and U behind. JARVIS is looking after them," and that only hurt about half as much as the first time he'd realized Shellhead still had his JARVIS. "They're safer there for now."
Before they could cement their banter with a kiss, a hoarse but pained shout reminded him that there were still other people in the room. Even a short time ago he never would have believed he could tune out Rogers so easily... but then whenever he really let himself focus on Steve, that attention was pretty damn all-encompassing. Soon after STAR came zooming their way, the spirals she was making through the air holding a distinctively smug and sassy edge. Given her temper, earlier words and the way her weapons were powered down for the first time since the arrival of the rogues, Tony could only surmise that she'd managed to get a shot in at Rogers. He loved her for it, and even Steve's attempt to scowl looked more like a grin.
. His lover had gone into defensive mode just as fast though, one arm now protecting Tony’s head and all his muscles tensed in case he needed to fight.
"I can feel you seething," his lover murmured against his collar bone. "And while I find it sexy I'm not up to sexing you up just yet so if you could tone it down that'd be great. Hmmm... can't wait until we can do that again. Gotta learn you all over again, Tiny Muscley Steve."
you don't even have one for MIT? You'd be a legacy, kid, and I know Peter's there too but it isn't like you guys are still fighting all the time. ... actually, I don't recognize any of these schools. Harley. Why aren't you angling for any of the big names?"
“Yeah. I know. Stick close anyway? One scotch and one water,” he added to the bartender that had finally been able to turn their way. It was good that he wasn’t looking down anymore, that his attention had shifted. Tony’s mouth was hanging open again, and he could feel how wide his eyes were. This was a whole new level of protectiveness, and once again there was a vague hope taking form inside of him.
"We can only hope. I fear that if he does not find some measure of who he was soon my father will choose to confine him in prison instead of his rooms. Loki does not do well in small spaces where it is easy to become bored."
He still didn’t know why everyone tried to drag him into the middle of their dinner fights. Sometimes he missed how simple everything had been before the Avengers had moved into his tower. But Bruce and Thor were engaged in a pretty passionate debate about the merits of various companions, Clint was keeping up a hilarious if slightly negative running commentary of the episodes, and Nat looked deeply engrossed and entirely comfortable from where she was sitting with her bare feet shoved under Thor’s thigh.
During the war he had lost men - not any of the Howlies, but they didn't always work alone. Soldiers had been lost on his watch and he had taken each death harder than he probably should have. Then he'd won the battle against Hydra only to lose everything else. Sometimes he still heard Peggy's voice his ear, choked with emotion, as they pretended he would show up for their dance. Of all the things he had missed, of all the chances he'd lost because he'd gone into the ice, that one would always cut the deepest. He'd lost a life with her, one where they could have been happy together, had children and a house - all the things that little Stevie Rogers had always known he would never get. Losing Peggy had cost him all of that, and sometimes he thought that maybe he mourned that lost life more than he did her.
"Being late would be really hard," Peter pointed out even as he grabbed zip-up hoodies for both him and Harley. "We can pretty much fine-tune our arrival now--"
Clint didn't rear back when Tony clapped his hands onto the archer's cheeks, which was... kind of nice. It was nicer still when Clint wrapped gentle, calloused fingers around his wrists and squeezed. A smile was tugging at his lips and there was none of the hardness that used to live in his eyes present. Clint was his friend, he realized suddenly. They weren't just teammates anymore.
He never got to know the end of the sentence, because all of a sudden the door flung open. Immediately he entered fight or flight mode and hated himself for it, shrinking back against his
"Captain? If you'll just step inside, Sir is waiting for you. And may I say that you look rather dashing."
It still wasn't nice of Clint to laugh and mess up Tony's hair. "Uh-huh. Sure. That's why I'm spanking you so hard. Whatever you say man. Also, if this is you trying to aim repulsers, I've gotta talk to Fury and get you in for some remedial target practice."
"Don't look like your archer right now." Sulking was childish and wouldn't change anything, but it was really hard not to pout. "Looks like he might be someone else's."
Brucie still turned a little green every time he entered the room, so Tony knew he was in for a lecture from his science bro later. Mostly because he could actually understand the x-rays that had gotten thrown up. He would know exactly how not fine Tony sometimes was after battles.
When the wait had finally been over, Harley and Winter had been the ones to pick the pair up and carry them to the infirmary. He had been busy trying to hold the rest of them together, because even Rogers had looked wrecked as he watched Tony from afar. Only Wanda appeared mostly unaffected, though she did seem genuine in her attempts to console Vision.
Steve's lips were warm and dry against his own and quickly opened to swallow the rest of his nervous babble. Strong, slender fingers gripped his jaw to hold him in place, while the man's other hand twisted in his shirt. In a few short steps - stumbling on his part, purposeful on Steve's - he felt the edge of one of the workbenches digging into his upper thighs. The other man's mouth never left his for more than a heartbeat the whole time, not even when one of the blond's arms swept out to clear the surface behind him.
God, it felt like he was flying. Tony's attention always made him feel a little high, like that first full breath he'd taken after the serum. He was sure he looked like a twit with the way he was smiling hard enough that his cheeks hurt, but he just couldn't help it. Clint was still grumbling as he navigated the menus, which was kind of the icing on the cake. Nobody got to make Tony pout that way, not even if it was in fun.
"Uh-huh. Sure it would." He finished the last of his stretches, sighing happily at the light pull in his muscles. It had been a good match, and it was just so nice to be able to let go. "You ever thought mebbe they'd be happier fawnin' over the real you?"
The thought let Steve curl up to Tony, who was already snoring the way he swore he  always swore he didn't. After one last sigh and squirm, he let himself follow suit and a comforting, restful blackness soon swallowed him.
At least they were in a remote part of the compound, where the only people in the rooms surrounding them were their human sons, Rhodey, Pepper and - now - the Defenders. The former Rogues were several buildings away, as were newer teammates they weren't completely sure about.
"Sometimes. For a week or two, and that only when ya feel like ya have to. Your floor of the tower is empty more often than not these days. It's where I go to make out with my dates, pops," the kid added flatly when he tried to lodge another protest. "That's how often you aren't there."
"True, but I would hate to disappoint all my admirers. I must prove worthy of their adoration! How disheartened they would be if I were unable to measure up to their vision of me. It would be enough to make me weep, friend Steven, if they turned from me."
with him. Sure it was sweet and all, but it had just been another reminder that he was on the verge of falling apart. He really, really wanted to be able to have sex with Steve when both of them were completely healthy. They'd never had that, and he was pretty damn sure it was going to be fantastic.
"Excuse you? You are the special-ist, and not in a bad way or in a professional way because it kind of sounds like I'm calling you
“You were so amazing during that last fight,” the redhead who had plastered herself to his side breathed.
Harley guided Peter through inputting the 'coordinates', which made Tony realize that his spider-son had never done so before. The mechanism was another largely unnecessary action to the actual travel. It
So he'd taken away the oh-so patriotic color palette and allowed himself the guilty pleasure of choosing hot rod red and gold. Because Steve wasn't quite as... flashy as he was, he had tried to tone it down a little. Most of Steve's suit was actually black, but Iron Man's colors did stand out in bold relief against that. Just in case anyone missed that connection, he'd stamped the image of an arc reactor over the heart. Because he was not only a sap but a predictable one, he'd also made sure it was outlined in that same bright blue.
That was a talk he had to give himself several times as he headed down for the workshop. He was just glad Clint had swung by to grab Rosie and left already by the time he came out of his bedroom. When he had looked in the mirror he was worried and hopeful and confused as fuck to his own eyes; Clint absolutely would have noticed all those things. He would have noticed and either started teasing or gotten all sweetly, annoyingly concerned and butted in. It was better that he didn't run into anyone on the way down to the workshop.
side in that... but he was so glad they were both there. The only thing that could make it better would be having Rhodey and Viz there too instead of them being at the compound, but he knew at least one of them would be high-tailing it back now that he'd sent his message.
Piercing through the thing's thick hide would take too long, but thankfully the Nightmare Beast was extremely vocal in its annoyance and pain. It roared again when Rhodey managed to slice through the two tentacles holding Harley, and they all saw where the beast kept its mouth. Without needing to talk about it further, the three of them went at it with a will, he and Shellhead shooting at the thing while STAR moved ever closer, looking for her chance.
had been the one to cause Tony to look like that, had managed to make the fella he mooned over that happy.
"I will do that Sir, on behalf of both of you. Also, I feel it might be prudent to remind you about the gift--"
All of their clothing was rough with visible fraying, the weapons not designed by him worn and sometimes ill repaired. Rogers had the shadow of stubble on cheeks gaunter than he remembered and darker shadows still in those blue eyes. As Sam offered the man a hand up, Tony decided that the hero from all of his father's stories seemed... smaller, somehow, than he once had been. Like maybe, just maybe, he wasn't riding this storm out as easily as he might like people to think.
They will remain anonymous, Ms. Potts. Suffice to say there are concerns. I've been brought in to try and get to the bottom of this and I was assured of your cooperation. Do I need to initiate more formal proceedings?
In the ensuing skirmish where Loki called up a magical version of the sticky substance that was arc reactor blue, Steve vowed that he would never lose touch with his crazy, amazing friends ever again.
The noise cut as soon as he rapped his knuckles against the door. When it was flung open by a frazzled Harley, he knew his guess had been correct. "Next time put 'Carry on My Wayward Son' on," he advised while ruffling the teen's hair. "Sounds enough like his stuff in spots that it's a good compromise."
That was probably from fury and humiliation as much as from lack of oxygen. It was fucking beautiful.
He had to keep watching them, couldn't look away as they curled into each other, until Steve was tucked under Tony's chin. Then they went still again, but it was more natural now, like they really were only sleeping. It felt like they were there, in the room, instead of like their souls were so far away they were out of reach.
. Spider-Man was there before the villain could evade the attacks and get to the chick with the spear and began to web the guy up. Perfect.
"I can't," he said, staring down at his bottle. "I... there's... I've got this plan. I don't... I don't want to spook him or make him feel like me bein' his friend was just me tryin' to... if he never wanted anything else, I'd be honored to be his friend. I don't want him to think--"
"Hmmm... guess that's true," Cap acknowledged with a little nod of his head. "And I did come down to ask if you wanted to mebbe go grab a bite at one of the food trucks nearby. So I guess my clock's gonna run out a little faster than yours." Tony's brain had ground to a halt, because what the fuck? Captain America had popped down to ask him to dinner? A friend-dinner, obviously, but still. They did not do dinners. Shit, Cap said he'd gotten there a while ago, and he had
"No flirtin' Starry Skies" he teased as she preened in Winter's palm. "Pep'll get jealous'n sad." STAR just blew a raspberry in his direction which drew forth a sound an awful lot like a chuckle from the Winter Soldier. "Pegs told me ya went out on the town the other day. They drag ya ta The Vortex?"
"Are you two done being gross? Because I for one would like to shoot someone until they dissolve into bloody chunks."
The part of him that knew Howard had been right about him wanted to flee. He wasn't good enough for Captain America and he sure as hell wasn't good enough for plain, wonderful Steve Rogers either. Tony knew that he should probably pack his bags and get the heck out of dodge for at least a few weeks. At the very least he should go back to being standoffish so that Steve wouldn't be fooled into making the gigantic mistake that was dating Tony Stark.
"You do the same, alright? I might not be ready to visit-visit, but I'll totally come kick some ass with you if you need it."
Winter was already striding for the door in a rolling gait Steve had to admit was definitely a murder strut. STAR was enthusing about the 'toys' Tony had made with him in mind. It was nice to see the guy so eager. If he were being honest, he'd sort of expected a blank-faced man with zero personality. That had been wrong of him, and he was glad for the chance to get to know this new version of his friend and brother.
"All-a that stuff is..." he stopped and considered, then shrugged a shoulder. "Way above my pay level ta be honest. Not much good at that kinda thinkin'. Battle strategy and such is more my area, but it could be your friend Ned is right. Maybe he ain't, I dunno. I'm actually from... well. A whole other world. Shellhead and Lokes were always talkin' about some kind-a multiverse or somethin'? Anyway. My world is really close ta bein' just like this one, but they ain't the same. Came here ta be with Tony and I'm real glad I did. But no, I ain't... 'Cap'."
be enough... but maybe they had the chance to be more too. Either was fine, because Tony was finally calling him
On the other hand, he really didn't think they could afford to leave the rogue Avengers out of any world saving antics in the future. The optics of it alone could put another nail in the Avengers coffin. As much as he didn't
Soul was certain of what that choice would be regardless. No Stone wanted to be captured and bent to another's will. They were their own masters; there was no one left who was worthy of wielding them the way Thanos and so many longed to.
Rosie's bottom had started to wag along with her tail when she heard Clint's name and by the time JARVIS said 'walk' her whole body was squirming with joy. Steve knew when he was beat - even a trip down to the workshop to see her metal brothers wasn't as fun as taking a walk with Clint. He was her favorite human to traipse around the city with and even her pop and her ma didn't come close to getting that level of excitement out of her.
The hug lingered a little longer, and then as soon as Shellhead pulled back he was replaced by Jan. He hadn't gotten to know her very well, but she seemed like exactly the kind of spastic ball of energy he would appreciate. Next time, he promised himself. Next time he'd make sure to hang with her and the kids. Peggy wasn't a hugger, but she did buss him on the cheek and did the same to Steve once he'd finished saying goodbye to Shellhead. STAR didn't leave her shoulder until the Defenders were ready to step into the light and go home.
I wish I could explain to you exactly how a completely different, pocket-sized Steve Rogers came to be sitting in the living room across from me, but I can't. Tony tried to explain it in more detail to me, but it only made my head hurt. What I DO understand is that there are multiple universes (who knew?) and one of them gave us Steve Brian... who was also Captain America where he's from. As soon as I mentioned that, he blushed again and looked down at the floor.
Steve  was quiet for a minute, eyes searching his like he'd be able to read his mind. "It ain't all... but I can stop pushin' if ya want. I'll stop askin' and just kiss ya silly before we put ya in that hospital gown that gives too many people too nice-a view, one that only I oughta get ta see."
Suddenly a corner of the workshop Steve hadn't seen in a while lit up and his jaw promptly dropped. There in front of him was a beautiful motorcycle that Tony had clearly poured his heart and soul into. It was sleek, painted a navy blue that almost seemed to ripple in the light shining down on it. When he got closer, he could see that there was a subtle, desaturated portion of the stars and stripes painted on both sides that you could only see in the right light. Not only was it a gorgeous machine, that beautifully understated paint job felt far more fitting than the more cartoonish color pallet SHIELD was always trying to force him into.
"Not qualified and not interested," Steve himself interrupted, looking alarmed as he dropped his arms and backed away from Pepper. "I didn't mind so much helpin' ta lead the Defenders 'cause of circumstances and how well we worked together'n all, but... sorry. Not interested and not just 'cause this ain't my world. Rhodey's a good choice, if ya ask me, and it'd be even better if ya found someone ta co-lead. Me'n Shellhead always worked well together."
, and he hoped like hell another one of his kids wasn't about to form a crush on one of his friends. Especially since Loki lived so far away.
"You got it, Iron Mom. So will you protect me from wrath coming for me on the red white and blue wings of an eagle? Please? Hawks don't do so well against eagles."
Everything around him was a blur - he knew it was happening and he was at least partly aware of it, but... it was so far away. He could still only feel STAR's grip on his ear and the wild beating in his chest, and there was a growing roar in his ears... and where was Tony?
Actually, that last one... that was a ball that should be in Rhodey's court, so he pulled out his cell phone and tapped out a quick message to the man so he could decide what to do. It was kind of nice not to have to make that call. Maybe he could get used to not having to make all the hard decisions on his own.
This is soooo late, I apologize profusely. Next chapter is going up too though, and the next two will be up by the end of the week!
His eyes met Primrose's and she made a soft 'whuff' before hiding her nose against his stomach and then promptly sneezing. Everyone was a damned critic, it seemed. He couldn't be mad at her though, just gave her one of the butt scratches that she lived for as he pondered J's suggestion.
"Any acceptable prank, Captain. I remember that at least. I shall tell Sir you will be arriving...?"
He got the uncomfortable feeling that Bruce was talking about a lot more than just the whole tea drinking thing. Usually he would be hot-footing it out of the room, because emotions gave him hives. But his science bro was smiling a soft, gentle smile that showed just a hint of dimple and crinkled around his eyes. It was probably the happiest, the brightest, he had ever seen the guy look - positive reinforcement had to be given. High-tailing it wouldn't give Bruce any incentive to keep smiling like that. Sacrifices to his own comfort had to be made.
It took another day and a half before both Tony Starks could be convinced to talk to each other. Tony was nervous and - Steve thought - maybe a little jealous, so he would flit out of the room as quick as possible if Shellhead entered. For his part, Shellhead was still terrified that he'd never measure up to Tony, so he would only stay in the same room if Loki was there to snuggle him and whisper sweet words into his ear. It was a ridiculous mess, and he had enough of it fairly quickly.
"I was." The man gave him a smile that looked tired and worn. He was leaning heavily against the door frame with a case of beer in one hand. Later Steve knew he would be delighted by the fact that Rhodes' own pajama shirt was emblazoned with Black Widow's symbol and that his flannel pants were dotted with tiny hammers, bows, shields and arc reactors. It was just that he recognized Tony's hand in the outfit, which at the moment only tugged painfully at his heart. "He finally talked himself to sleep about twenty minutes ago. I was gonna try to do the same without the talking, and then..."
And so when the Titan called to Power and Reality, when he tried to turn them against their fellow Stones... they balked. They fought the control he had taken for granted, leaving his attacks weak. Pitiful, really, so insignificant that Soul could bat them aside with one calloused, mortal hand. The skin blistered, but that didn't matter - what mattered was that Thanos was sweating, and that he was staring at the gauntlet as though at a betrayer.
Steve didn't begrudge him that, but seeing the way they were on now... it was just a reminder of how things had been between them. Of the strained silences and the way he'd been denied entry so often, of all the times he'd come down to find the dimmers on and heard JARVIS' gentle 'Sir is busy' to turn him away.
“Not again. No way. Come on - I wanna watch a movie.” Just like that, Nat and Clint were glaring at each other again, because nothing about dinner time could come easily. He guessed that made it even more telling that they all chose to do it anyway.
"Since you managed to get tricked by Loki into letting this... this clone live with you I'm gonna have to disagree! And it's kind of low of you to want me to be like that Tony - at my weakest. It's just sad and insulting that you would want me like this so you can
"You don't have to!" Ca... Steve hurried to say, cheeks flushing darker as both his hands lifted into the air. "It's just... I know we got off on the wrong foot Tony, and I'm real sorry about that even if you usually won't let me say it. Things being sideways in my head was no excuse for the way I acted back then, and I hope you--"
"See you for dinner? I'll cook." After a sound of agreement and a brief kiss, Steve left the room as well. Tony found himself staring at the spot where the Defenders had disappeared. He didn't like the way it had felt, saying goodbye like that. Thinking of all the times that Tiny Adorable Steve had done it was beyond unacceptable... and he needed to find a way to fix it. So as soon as he finished Pep and Steve's new super-selves, he was going to figure out the problem of his
Tony always said that JARVIS didn't live in the ceiling, but he didn't know where else to look. Besides, the look Tony got on his face was both adorable and only playfully angry so he'd do it even if he did know where the cameras actually were. The AI never seemed to mind after all.
“I’ll clean up the mess, Tony.” To add to that easy agreement Steve headed for the workshop’s shower, Dum-E gazing after him with anxious whistles. “It’s okay buddy. Go get your extinguisher. I’ll get ya cleaned up quick and then you can go find my pencils.”
Even the murder twins could probably use a safe place away from SHIELD to relax. Captain America would be living somewhere that actually encouraged him to
“No. That shit smells disgusting and I don’t care that you only get it on one pizza. It stinks up the whole tower.”
Hypothetically, of course," he interrupted, already planning an alibi and fully intending to feign ignorance about where the arrows had come from.
he needed to do that - but he was rooted in place. At least that way he could see the way all three humans winced a little, expressions souring.
"Pretty much the best. Anyway I... after you all imprisoned me in medical for no reason--" Steve growled before he could stop himself and wasn't quite as amused when he felt another laugh against his neck. "Sorry. It was then that I realized I'd been being kind of oblivious. I can't believe it took me so long--"
"Easy, sweetheart," he whispered as he tried not to be furious at the teen who'd caused the bout of coughing. "Just breathe... there we go." When he dared look over at Harley the anger in him softened again at the lost, helpless look in his eyes. He'd never stopped crying, Steve realized, and there were bruises under his eyes that were almost a match for Tony's. The kid looked pale and was trembling to boot, lower lip caught between his teeth like maybe he was trying to hold in a sob. "Come here son-- Harley. C'mon over so Tony can apologize proper ta ya without shoutin'."
at the time of the delivery he would have made a different call," she continued, voice sharp and decisive as a whip crack. "But in my position as his proxy, I consulted with FRIDAY and determined a course of action that was most beneficial to his health and well-being."
) and Bruce had finally started accepting Tony's stupid nicknames and casual touches. Watching Bruce relax - blossom, even - had given Tony an idea.
Seeing Tony surrounded by people who really cared about him, eyes alight with laughter was good enough in that moment. Knowing his fella was alive and safe meant even more. They were going to be okay, he decided with a smile when Tony chucked one of his many pillows at Rhodey's face. Things would be challenging and he still owed Rogers at least one punch to the jaw, but... they were all going to be alright.
He sort of liked Lady and Primrose - she was a dignified, polite little thing even as she explored her new home and dealt with her injuries. For some reason he kept coming back to the name Beacon too, but he just wasn't sure. He needed some help but only really wanted it from one person.
"Even before we were in the room with the staff I was acting like a jerk, Tony. I just..." Tony was kind of fascinated by how easily Steve seemed to blush. Maybe when you were pale like that it didn't even mean anything and he shouldn't read into it, but... it was really something to watch happen. "Things were sideways in my head, and I didn't... I didn't even really wanna be... and you're so much, Tony - in a good way, honest, but I wasn't ready for anything good. That's no excuse and my ma would tan my hide for being so rude and never apologizin' proper. None of that was really about you, Tony. I was being an ass and then I didn't know how..."
"Do you wish to go elsewhere?" Thor's whisper was pitched so only he would hear it; the way the god let his voice boom and carry really was an act. "We could go to your quarters so I can marvel over your artistry, perhaps."
Tony considered the lingering taste in his mouth - it really wasn't bad. Sure it wasn't something he’d want to drink everyday and he was definitely going to have to make some coffee once he hit the workshop, but still. A second sip cemented that fact so he waved Bruce off.
It was harder to do than it should have been, mostly because Steve chose that moment to let his arm drop from his shoulders to wrap around his waist instead. That was a pretty common gesture between them now that they were people that hugged. Tony just wondered why Steve didn’t realize how couple-y it made them look. There had been entire tabloid issues devoted to their non-existent romance partially because of that snug hold.
"Sure do." She was watching him with those huge eyes of hers again, and a suddenly-quiet Tappy was watching him with eyes just as big. It would take a monster not to be affected, but he still briefly focused his attention on Tony. His genius looked both exasperated and amused, which he understood. It was impulsive and a little crazy, but Doreen
When I asked if he was Steve Rogers, the two of them shared a look that I honestly couldn't interpret. "I... am. Kinda." Steve finally told me. "But not the one you're thinking of. There was some kind of--"
"And if words fail? You have all made Rogers sound like some sort of guard dog - if I'm going to try to help Bucky I'll have to go through him. I am willing to do so." Another slow shrug that emphasized muscles a lot of people on the internet seemed to drool over. "How that happens is up to him."
Not when he was such a fuck-up and not when he had problems demonstrating his own fondness for people in a socially acceptable manner. He'd sort of figured that he was lucky as hell to have the few people that he did, and even if he didn't deserve them he loved him with all the strength his broken heart could muster. With them it had become easy, second nature - he knew when they were showing that they cared.
"Never had any complaints." That got a laugh, and then a comfortable silence fell between them. He threw the ball for Dum-E a few more times in between doodling - Tony had given him an idea. Nat's birthday was coming up, and she'd probably love a picture of her and Clint as the 'Murder Twins' with the rest of the Avengers as their 'Murder Squad'. It would tickle that dark sense of humor she had, especially if he could get his pencils and paper to behave enough to turn his ideas into some sort of comic.
"Hey mister. Got the stuff you wanted." Steve looked up to find the boy he'd given a fifty to standing a few feet away, two blue plastic bags swinging from one wrist. "That thing gonna bite if I get close? Rabies isn't how I wanna die."
doin' it to defend his honor," he said before he stuck his tongue out at the archer. "He'd do just fine on his own."
It is over! A bittersweet thing to say, as I've loved spending time in this universe even if I was often slow on updating. <3
"I ain't destitute ya know. Rosie always knew I'd be back, so she took my Army money ta invest and it grew from there. I'm not your kind-a rich, but I ain't hurtin' either - I can afford ta buy us somethin'. And your money wouldn't do no good there anyway."
Next two chapters might go up Tuesday morning instead of Monday night, depending on my internet situation! They's written, just not edited or coded.
"Sorry. It's just... why now? It's not even the first time I almost died, which would make it a little easier to swallow. So help me understand? Please? Because I'm floundering here, Pep."
1 - Next chapter is mostly written, just working out a few kinks, so it'll be up at some point on Saturday, I think.
like he's supposed to. We'll come home tomorrow and it'll be a family day. For now? Stop fussin' over us and get him back to the tower."
"Yeah. So you need to figure out if you're good with living here, and if you are? You gotta tell him that. Because--"
Which didn't stop him from absolutely spoiling Brian, the spitting image of Winter, right alongside his sister. 'Uncle Shellhead' doted on them endlessly, while Lokes looked on with a smile.
"I would have," Steve admitted while popping the top off of two bottles. He didn't like the taste of beer in modern times very much, but he still liked to drink socially. Well, not when he was Captain America - his super-self didn't drink. Plain old Steve Rogers was the one who sipped a cold brew from time to time with his buddies. "I always cave if he cries."
It wasn't until he was seated next to an equally zoned-out Tony, both of them eating their stew, that he realized there were other people on their floor too. Peggy was there, talking with Fri about where 'everyone' could sleep. Jan and Hank were huddled together on one of the couches, Clint perched on the coffee table in front of them and all three looking at... something? A schematic maybe? As he chewed on the meat and potatoes in his last bite, he scanned the room again and found Natalia ensconced in one corner, looking over a truly frightening arsenal of weaponry. They were all dressed for combat, his exhausted brain finally registered. They'd... come to fight?
Lokes was a bastard who wouldn't let anyone talk about what the hell was going on until the dishes were done. Then the little drama queen had made them all coffee before ushering them into the living room to sit. Shellhead commandeered a loveseat for the two of them, Winter made himself at home on one of the overstuffed armchairs, and he and Steve snuggled up under a blanket on the couch. It would have been downright domestic if he weren't ready to fucking
"And so you do not get to send him mail not even a week later." Despite not raising her voice, Pepper spoke over the soldier with ease. The face Rogers was making every time she called him 'Mister' was priceless and he wanted a fucking picture of it. "Perhaps if Mister Stark hadn't been in
Harley was angling for a golden apple from Thor, since his Captain Marvel looked to be pretty much immortal. Tony was pretty sure that he'd get it.
"It better fucking not be," the other Tony said, breaking away from where he and Loki had been saying goodbye to the metal boys. "We've got communication devices, you asshole. I want to hear from you hourly."
"Can't tell you, 'cause Steve'll take them and ruin the rest of the mission." Winter just nodded solemnly while Steve began to think about where the hell the pens could be. Pepper was ready to pull her hair out and Harley and Peter were both convinced it was the other one who'd done it. The tower was on the brink of prank warfare, and he had a feeling that was exactly what his troll of a daughter was counting on.
Though that was what ended up on the screen. Steve had campaigned even harder for that choice than Tony had and seemed smugly pleased with his victory from the love seat they were sharing.
"And you started with me?" he demanded, though it didn't come out as forcefully as he would have liked. "Fucking Christ, kid. I don't know if I'm about to have a heart attack or a panic attack. Fuck."
His AI's silence took on a pissy note that Tony knew was probably Not Good, but the circuitry he was working on was way more important than placating JARVIS. His music was still going strong after all, so it couldn't be that bad. If his Black Sabbath cut out then he knew there was real trouble. Until that happened he planned to keep putting the design from R&D through its paces. If it worked, if it could really prolong the life of Lithium-air batteries reliably... well. He would turn his own genius toward solving the short-circuiting problem and bam! The world would be one step closer to clean energy for all.
"Hey bud," he murmured, other hand still dancing over the paper as ideas flowed. "Do me a favor? Lemme know if your da heads this way, will ya?" Clearly understanding that this was a secret request, the 'bot's answer was a very muted whistle. With him on guard, Steve relaxed his own and let himself fall into the very important list he was making.
"Ya both are gonna spend the whole next visit in the workshop," Steve complained despite the grin he was wearing from ear to ear. "Won't even see ya at all, will I Shellhead?"
He couldn't give that  knowledge the time and weight it deserved though. He'd invent something nifty later to mark the occasion. First he had to make sure the canary wouldn't start squawking.
"I mean, I probably shouldn't tell you too much about where I come from," he told me when I started asking, looking sheepish. "Couple of people have said I could break the universe if I do. They were probably only teasing, but I don't wanna take the chance."
"Is that... supposed ta make me feel better? 'Cause I gotta say it doesn't. Ya can't shoot him Winter."
"Aww, c'mon. It wasn't that bad. It was just..." he trailed off, swallowed hard - fuck, fuck, fuck, Tony had probably scarred him for life - then shifted his shoulders uncomfortably. "Just dancing, is all. I didn't know that, uh. You could dance. Like that. It was...." Cap searched for a word, then swallowed again. "New," he finally managed, voice sounding a bit choked.
“To make sure you heard my side of the story. If you hear his first you’ll just side with him, but if you hear what
more disturbing in Tony's opinion. It was a threesome full of danger, snark and a fierce kind of love. Lokes stole apples for the mortals almost immediately, delighted with the way it lit up his counterpart's eyes. Shellhead was less impressed, at least until Peggy had a baby with bright, mischievous green eyes and named her Antonia. After that he made more of an effort to get along with Winter, though they would never be friends.
I find it extremely generous. FRIDAY and I have worked to create an informational packet that should answer many of the more basic questions. Your superiors in the Committee could have provided you with the same, but as you seem reluctant to actually ask them for it I took the liberty. Have your people look through it and explain it to you, because I have far more pressing matters to attend to. When you have questions that won't make a mockery of this process I invite you to call and make another appointment. I have a feeling it will be a smoother and far more productive meeting. And Mr. Poppleton?
"Very wrong." Winter gave him a wolf's smile before turning his attention back to STAR. "But I will not prove that to her in the presence of a lady." With those words, the little ball of anxiety that had carved out a space in his chest finally began to uncurl and relax. If the other man was starting to warm up to STAR already, maybe they had a chance. Maybe this wouldn't be a disaster, and maybe, just maybe, they could learn how to be friends again.
He couldn't help but sigh as he looked over at the reason she'd asked the question. Tony - it was always Tony - and Clint were playing some video game that involved shooting at each other. Steve wasn't sure which one it was, because they all looked the same to him. He liked the more stylized stuff, like Mario and Spyro; he always knew what he was playing. His teammates were happy with the ones that were supposed to be all 'realistic' though, and Tony and Clint seemed to be having a good time. A really good time, one that involved leaning heavily against each other while they trash talked. Sometimes they'd throw elbows or sling an arm around each other's shoulders. Every time he won a round. Clint would press a smacking kiss to Tony's cheek and Steve knew Tony was only pretending to hate it. They were close and comfortable with each other, seemed to be constantly touching, and if he didn't know better he would absolutely think they were going steady.
When it comes to battles, yes. I don't know if you realize this, Mr. Poppleton, but there is more to the Avengers than simply punching bad guys. Mr. Stark has always been heavily involved in making gear for the Avengers--
Even with all he had lost, with everything he kept losing, Steve had never imagined that losing Tony could be anything but temporary. Iron Man was Earth's mightiest defender, the smartest and bravest man he had ever known. There was no way he could ever be taken down in battle; he couldn't imagine a time when there wasn't a red and gold streak protecting the Avengers and the world.
"And oh boy are we going to read you the riot act." Before Shellhead could get too worked up, Lokes shot him a look that shut him up. Tony blinked at them both, looked around at the other Defenders, then turned his attention to Steve.
a mean old witch. Nobody should be tryin' ta kill Tappy or say that ya ain't allowed ta be friends with him."
"He's... overbearin', that's for sure. Does seem ta care about Bucky, just doesn't seem ta understand that what he's doin' ain't workin'. Puttin' Bucky in the same team as him was probably a mistake, but I think Carol and Rhodey just didn't know what else ta do. Bucky asked for it'n nobody else really wanted him. It's sad."
. "Captain Marvel, don't let up on her - I'm coming in to help. Fri, forget the fucked up pooches for a second and lock in on the chick."
He had been hearing stories about Captain America even longer - hell, to hear everyone tell it, his very first word had been 'Captain'. A garbled infant's version of it anyway. Tony had no doubt believing that it was the closest Howard had ever come to approving of him. The missing soldier - not dead,
squeezed back, sending him another warm smile as he did. The kids moved to stand behind them, and just before it was too late STAR swooped into the room, toting a heavy-looking bag bigger than she was. She landed on his shoulder with a few feigned pants of exertion... and then they were moving.
"You heard the woman. Get her an opening. Rhodey! See if you can free my kid while we start Operation Jonah and the Whale."
Rogers' eyes were flicking between Winter's multiple piercings with a scandalized look on his face. Steve was probably enjoying it way too much, especially as he could see the emotion slowly morphing to outrage.
"It..." He fought the need to immediately deny, looking out over the land that they owned. Miss Margaret had found them a great spot, nestled in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains. What he called the Rocky Mountains anyway. He refused to remember what it was called in Steve's universe because he liked the way Miss Margaret's lips pursed in annoyance and Winter's eyes crinkled with laughter whenever he used 'Rocky Mountains' instead.
He couldn't help but stand when he heard someone approaching. He'd never taken a dame to a dance, not for real, but he guessed this was probably close to what Peter'd felt when he'd picked up that Liz girl for Homecoming. Should he have brought flowers? No, that would be weird. Very weird and also likely to give Winter the wrong idea. Flowers were definitely not called for except that they would give him something to fuss with other than his sleeves.
"Just like Peter," Harley mumbled into his shoulder, holding on a little tighter. "It'd be a start, right? Hero-in-training."
Peter had slunk in not too long after Laney had fallen asleep, his shoulders hunched like he thought Harley would turn him away. He'd rolled his eyes even though his brother couldn't see it and lifted the covers in invitation. Peter had accepted immediately and laid down on Laney's other side, snuggling in with a quiet sigh. Harley had managed to stay in the bed for probably an hour longer before he had slipped into his chair to start his quiet vigil. Laney had grumbled a little in her sleep, then turned and latched on to Peter... who Harley was pretty sure was still wide-awake and staring at the ceiling.
"The park is a great place for Tappy ta live, but I think maybe for little girls it ain't the best."
Steve was sitting all the way across the room. He'd been by himself until Nat came in and sat on the table instead of the chair next to him. It had been long enough since she'd spoken that she probably already knew the answer; she had reached out to start running her fingers through his hair, nails dragging over his scalp in a comforting dance.
? Let them hover around outside until someone noticed they were there? Engage lethal countermeasures to keep them away? Alert the UN?
Demon-dogs howled and screeched when the missiles exploded inside the first vessel. It also seemed to set off a chain reaction of other, smaller explosions; Tony probably could have gotten away with using lasers instead of a unibeam. But the beam was way more awesome, so he activated it and flew around the petal in a tight, slow spiral; the alien metal was tougher than anything he had access to on earth, but it still buckled under his beam after a few moments of resistance.
. "I ain't ready to walk away from that. Mom and Laney are fine with it, so long as I visit often," he added quickly, knowing that was Tony's biggest protest. He had no interest in stealing the kid away from his mom, after all. That had always been his biggest hangup, and now-- "I'd be going away for school anyway, pops. And I'm at the compound almost full time right now anyway--"
, and he would never get used to it enough to take it for granted. And he'd been having a hell of a lot of fun putting together a new superhero self for Steve - the thought of getting to do the same for Pepper had part of him eager to grab a pencil or hologram and dive right on in.
Thor in particular seemed charmed. He'd also been ready to go on quest of blood vengeance against her former owner, whoever that was. It had taken a lot of talking to convince him to let it go and focus on giving her a good home in the moment. Besides, he knew that Nat and Clint were making quiet inquiries of their own. Whatever they did to whoever it was would be a lot nastier than anything Thor could come up with. It'd have a nice, vicious twist of poetic justice too, which he sort of approved of but also never wanted to know about.
"We couldn't keep Harley, Peter or Fri out of the fight," Tony continued quietly, grief and anxiety both welling up in his throat. He'd
"Thanks," he muttered before dragging Clint towards the elevator. Tony didn't want to do this awkward turtle dance, not when it hurt his heart just a little bit. He'd rather be drinking and swapping stories with Clint.
"Don't you dare you spoilsport. I designed your code, J. A few keystrokes and all you're good for is being Siri's sidekick."
"This is your home, Steve. You don't have to ask if you can get a pet. Hawkass does, but that's only because he'd try to come home with a tiger or something just to piss me off. The rest of you are allowed all the furry or scaly companions you want." Tony edged a little further into the room, though he stayed with his back against the wall and a gulf between him and the dog. "The vet says she wasn't hurt as badly as she looked."
"Because we don't care a bit about any of those people." Now the demigod's voice was pure acid as he sneered at Steve. "And we have no right to stand at your side either. Thank you, Steven, for your words of wisdom. Thank you for sparing us--"
The plans to abduct Stark were extremely worrying and may require a harsher punishment than Captain Danvers is permitted to hand down. All information, including a recording of the incident, has been forwarded to the Accords Committee. It is expected that they will convene a hearing and Rogers will face additional reprimands. Stark has been given cursory details of the situation so that he is armed with the knowledge to keep himself safe.
Rhodey and Carol were the ones standing nearest to the point of landing, both standing with their arms across their chest. His sourbear's jaw had developed a tic early that morning, it was set so tight, but he was there. He was there even though he'd voted 'no', ready to do what had to be done. The rest of the New Avengers were arrayed behind them, not a single one looking pleased to be there.
He gave the question a little more thought - was he okay? Eventually he shrugged and gave another little sigh, eyes still fixed on the guy who'd stolen his heart.
"Moron." He made a noncommittal noise that earned a snort from Winter before the man slung an arm around his shoulders. The feeling was one that was finally familiar again, but not so much so that he didn't still revel in it. Leaning hard against his friend, he sighed quietly.
"Sure." Steve's easy agreement was just shy of patronizing, and from his bright grin he knew it too. After smacking a loud kiss to his cheek the blond left to grab the presents. There were quite a few of them, so he might have to draft Harley and Peter into gift-carrying duty as well. Just as long as they didn't shake any of the boxes - a couple of them had very delicate equipment in them. Getting presents for another him had been nice. He mostly knew what Shellhead liked, and he didn't need to worry about any of his choices being 'too much'.
"Go ta the workshop'n play with the numbers, yeah? I'm gonna go play with that metal clay stuff ya bought me."
"Good call Shellhead. Just... keep shooting it to keep it distracted and stay out of its reach." STAR was still in there, still moving and talking and she didn't sound alarmed. Hopefully he hadn't sent her into a pit of acid, because he'd never forgive himself if he had. "We've got to give her some time to work."
Thanos had... summoned? Transfigured? Pushing down the need to understand, Tony turned so he could fly backwards and keep his eye on the Nightmare Beast. Its tentacles had a much longer reach than he would have expected, coiling before lashing out and forcing him to dance out of their way. Rhodey and Harley both had flown in to engage it alongside him. Harley was the one to flank it and fire first, drawing nothing more than an outraged roar that sent a shiver through the metal of Tony's armor. A simple reactor blast wasn't enough to penetrate the thing's defenses, and Tony was worried that they might have to get creative.
The flight home was an exercise in endurance for both of them. It took everything he had not to curl up in Tony's lap and just fall asleep there. All that really stopped him in the end was knowing that Tony was just as tired and was still managing to fly them home. If the tower had been any further away it would have been a problem; even the half-hour it took them was a struggle.
"Ooh! I do that sometimes too!" STAR launched herself off Winter's hand and began to circle his head, dipping one arm down and then the other as she did. Winter was watching her with another one of those little smiles, and his girl was a gift. "Yesterday my mission was to steal all the pens on the common floor without anyone noticing."
Miss Margaret - because anything was better than adding 'Other' in front of every name in his head - had decided to brave their larger pile. She'd set up shop on the other side of Steve, her shoes gone the same way as Pep's. Pretty soon she had Laney at her feet, clever fingers doing and undoing a series of intricate braids with Alicia watching that more than the movie. Their metal sons were being kept occupied by STAR and Jan, who were using them as perches interchangeably. The tiny terrors were equally giggly and apt to fly around the room at a moment's notice with the boys 'chasing' after them.
"Hey doll," he started one morning two weeks after his return. Harley was with Tony and all the 'bots were off in another room making a surprise for their pops. That meant he was alone with Fri and could start getting all the answers that would let him move forward. "Can I talk ta ya for a bit?"
Now Winter was staring, and soon everyone else was too... at least everyone who wasn't staring at Steve, who was floating in the air wreathed in green and blue flames. His left eye was a piercing green while the right was a frozen blue, and the power that hung around him should have made Thanos tremble.
Maverick - who I now knew was 'Steve' - came in shortly after. I don't know what I was expecting when it came to him, but I almost had a heart-attack when we came face-to-face. I was absolutely sure Steve Rogers had entered the room, somehow shrunk down into a pocket sized version. Maverick has always looked smaller than the other heroes on the field, but he only just comes up to my shoulder in person.
"Okay. How about this. I'll make you a suit, because I have had dreams about that and I am not passing up the chance to turn that into a reality. We'll... look. There's time before we have to deal with the next crisis with world-ending possibilities. Probably. So for now let's just... agree to disagree. I'll focus on getting the two of you fighting-fit for now, and on helping vet some new Avengers with Rhodey and Viz. I've got to work on the Accords - not for them, but for all of us. It's still the best option on the table for oversight and we need the goodwill fixing them will bring now more than ever. But I won't... I'll stop looking for loopholes and shit, okay? I won't put any more energy into bringing them home until I've got you two squared away and we have a bigger team. Then we'll all talk about it. Roundtable, democratic discussion. Well, the final decision would come down to the leader of the Avengers, but if I know my Rhodey-bear--"
Harley and Peter were just as amazing, and they stepped up to take care of the things their metal siblings couldn't. Mostly that meant Avengers business, because neither he nor Tony were remotely ready to return to those duties. Steve didn't know that he ever would be. Something in him had changed, or shifted, or broken maybe, because he was just so
?" That was so insulting, and so rude, and so very very hurtful... and Cap had started to laugh so that was fine. He could handle Pep being mean if it meant he got to watch a full-body laugh roll through that powerful frame.
"We thought it was better to let you sleep," Lokes commented without even looking over his shoulder. "Agent Carter was in charge of making sure none of the others ran amok in the meantime."
"Seriously? Harls, that's... why is there not anything for Yale or Harvard in here? Even with the two years off you had the grades, and
Fear immediately swamped him, vision tunneling in on the Witch as sweat gathered at his temples. He fumbled for the amulet the Other Strange had given him, trying to take some comfort from it. It was hard though - the thing had never been tested against this Wanda, and she was so fucking strong--
He couldn't help but start to laugh, a real one this time with shoulder action and everything. Nat looked like the cat who'd gotten into the cream when he peeked up, her mouth curved into a barely-there smile. She ruffled his hair one last time and slipped from the table; he mourned the loss of both her company and the way she'd been petting him. The look she gave him while crossing to the couch was very much 'double-dog dare ya', and the skinny kid from Brooklyn had
He could be so strangely, beautifully sweet; Steve was never sure if he loved or hated how few people seemed to understand that. As much as he liked being one of the privileged few to see that side of him clearly, he also sort of wanted to crow about every amazing trait of Tony's so the whole world would know how damned perfect he was.
"It sounds like a challenge, so yeah. I'll work on the project solo, then when we come to visit me and me can get it up and running."
, like he was the last bit of toothpaste in a nearly empty tube. Just before he threw up... it was over.
passed on one of those. So up he got to pad after her, doing his best not to gulp when she plopped down next to Clint.
Tony didn't let JARVIS interrupt his concentration, just kept right on working. His AI was probably just going to tell him something he already knew - like how it had been two days since he'd slept in a bed or that he was an hour overdue for a smoothie fix. None of it mattered as much as the numbers coming together in beautiful symmetry under his fingers. Math taking physical shape was probably the sexiest thing in existence. Why more young people weren't interested in engineering - which also included a gorgeous infusion of science - he didn't know. Probably their education was lacking. He should look into making more donations to STEM programs…
He had been losing things since before he was born, and he'd always managed to weather the storm. Most things he could still lose and eventually be okay.
bottle of scotch - that had a place of pride in their living room - but it was the same brand. He knew that Tony was about to pour himself a glass that he wouldn't drink, that he'd just stare into for hours if he was allowed to do it.
"Earth to Tony? You've got that gross look on your face again, the one that means you're thinking about Steve. You're
Tony had been all set to disappear into the workshop once everyone broke up for the night. Thankfully he'd managed to catch his lover in the elevator. Once he'd tangled their fingers together and squeezed gently, the other man had given an exaggerated sigh and asked Fri to take them to their floor instead. The silence between them was more tense than it ever had been before. He worried that maybe even if he didn't go visit Bucky right away that they had been hurt by this.
The laugh he let out was raw enough that it scraped his throat, sending a shudder of pain down his spine. Of
"Did you..." Tony sounded disbelieving, blinking several times with wide eyes. He was probably 'blue-screening' as he put it at J's gumption. "Did you already tell everyone?"
He wasn’t going to press his fucking luck though. Not when he had Steve as a friend, not now that the Avengers were getting close to feeling like a family. He already had more than he’d ever thought he would ever have. It was enough that Steve felt comfortable enough with him to be singing some stupid love song from the forties wildly off-key just a few short steps away.
The ‘bot gave a single beep before heading off to do just that. Tony didn’t watch him though - his eyes were caught on Steve, who was in the process of pulling off his shirt. The sight should be illegal with all those rippling muscles and the almost invisible dusting of freckles Tony probably shouldn’t know covered his shoulders. Just before he vanished into the tiny room where he’d be able to get clean Steve reached for the waistband of his basketball shorts. Quickly he turned back to his work and tried to ignore the way his cheeks were feeling a little bit warmer.
"In a couple of weeks. I told her. We'll be ready for her teeth then. I hope so anyway, because even if we definitely just saved half the universe she isn't going to hold back. She's got questions about why the shields over Shenzhen failed so quickly, and she's also curious about why we don't regularly ask your friends from the Defenders to help during more challenging fights if it might save the lives of citizens."
I feel super bad about how long it took to finish this commission, but I very much enjoyed writing it!! I love fluffy-ness with a touch of angst, and I like when I don't have to include a lot of plot because I'm bad at it. XD So thanks very much to the awesome lady who commissioned this and let me run with the prompt she gave me! <3
"Whoa!" That was Cap interrupting before he could, and he sound just a little outraged. "Tony ain't... I'm not a prisoner, JARVIS. Tell Ms. Potts I'm just fine and she doesn't need to worry, will ya?"
He lost Tony more than he lost anyone, and it hurt like hell every time. The man was in high demand though, and he had a company to run so he couldn't say anything. Steve kept every plea to stay locked behind his teeth and he sent Tony off to other countries with a smile. He pretended it didn't kill something in him to watch the genius climb into an airplane with a jaunty wave. He never gave in to the insane, insulting way he wanted to forbid Tony from flying off into battle where Steve couldn't fully have his back. And he watched without complaint whenever Tony vanished into the crowd at parties with some pretty young thing on his arm - they were only ever going to dance or talk shop but it still…
Despite the words, he hadn't seen the powerful horse kick Rogers tried to deliver coming. Steve didn't have that problem. He didn't have any trouble evading it, darting in even closer to the other man and lashing out with the heel of his hand. That blow landed solidly in the center of Rogers' chest and sent him staggering back several steps.
"Holy shit. We live here and we didn't even know." Because now that he thought about it, most of their stuff had migrated to their 'vacation' house. When they visited the tower it was just that - a visit. They never went back for long stretches of time, usually only for a couple of days while they took care of some kind of business. Most of the time Rhodey, Pep and their human kids came to them, not the other way around. He hadn't even known Harley had been
The Vision joined them only a few moments later, worry a little alien on his face but there nonetheless. It was quite a nice little family reunion, and Steve only wished his fella wasn't in pain through so much of it. By the time Pepper and Rhodey joined them they had all been in bed all day - even Harley's mother and adorable little sister had come to join the impromptu gathering. There were snacks and everything. Maybe it would have been better if it could have happened on the common floor, but... it was enough.
all fired up and ready to go kick ass. Maybe part of him would enjoy that - enjoy it a whole fucking lot, actually - but more than that... he just wanted Steve to
He hesitated at the door to go inside though. The dimmers were on - Tony had another name for it, the way the walls of glass looking into the workshop went dark. It was a fancy word that Steve had deliberately forgotten every time he heard it just because he loved the fondly exasperated lecture he got for saying 'dimmer switch'
His human boys continued to bicker all the way down to the elevator. Steve was waiting in front of it, carefully slipping the last of the gifts into the crazy bag of his that should not fucking exist and had the nerve to do so anyway. Harley and Peter didn't stop once all the way to the floor that had become the official landing zone - it would have given him a headache if it wasn't so clearly a sibling thing. Their squabbles tended to warm his heart more than anything else. Steve seemed to agree, because he was smiling at the pair of them from where he was tucked against Tony's side.
He had Pep, Rhodey and JARVIS, after all, who had been his friends even when he hadn't deserved any. There was Bruce to science with, who made him try strange teas and teased him gently about his addiction to coffee. Nat had apologized for everything that had happened while he was dying - Tony believed and forgave her. Now her threats were more fond than anything, and he'd even caught her almost-smiling at his sarcastic movie commentary more than a few times. He had Clint to snark with during their more boring meetings and who would happily engage in mini food fights with Tony. The archer was also teaching him how to shoot a bow and arrow which was pretty awesome. The resident 'God of Thunder' was a bit more of a mystery, but Tony was learning that he wasn't as ignorant as he led people to believe. Technology on Earth was hard for him to grasp because it was so
"Because she's a bloodthirsty savage. All-a the rest of 'em are with Alicia'n Pepper is stayin' with us. That okay?"
"I am," Tony said slowly. "Really close. If I put my nose to the grindstone I could have it done in a few days. The notes Shellhead gave me during his last visit were a great jumping off point. But where would we stay where nobody would get huffy about their place being invaded by AIs?"
"Perish the thought! I must maintain my godly visage. It is the only thing I possess in this entire realm."
in a way he just couldn't be, for years. Over and over he'd given Rogers his way, let the man's intentions make up for the way his actions were so often lacking. He'd swallowed the disregard, the casual, maybe unintentional cruelty and mistrust because it was Steve Rogers - Captain America for Christ's sake. Tony had been so sure that he was the one lacking that he hadn't been able to see what was going so horribly wrong on the team. He'd forgotten where the best of intentions led, and he'd done it because of that fucking voice coupled with that earnest look on the man's face.
"Right. Promised my Spider-kid we'd have a day of science and exploration together. I think that mostly means she's going to drag me to a couple different museums and then force me to buy her lunch."
Harley liked to be the sole holder of his attention, but it was rare for the teen to actually ask to see him alone. As soon as he'd agreed the kid had dragged him into an empty conference room and began to pace. His beloved hat was in his hands, and as he walked he bent the cap this way and that, putting it on and taking it off just as quick to run a hand through his curls. It was clear the kid was agitated but not worried... so Tony figured it was best to let him speak in his own time.
how many epic pranks I'm going to be able to pull off at SHIELD?" The way Clint started to cackle probably should have been worrying, but instead Tony felt a manic grin stretch over his own lips. "Those baby agents aren't going to know what hit them. Oh man. This is gonna be so good. Do you think I could get Fury's office? Getting around Hill won't be easy, but it might be worth it to try... hey, could you stick a timer or something on some of these? If three of them were to go off in, say, the training room during drills for the higher ups--"
is what he meant. He was pretty sure the man had caught that less than subtle probe because he brought Tony's fingertips to his mouth and gave them a light kiss.
It was sort of a weird relationship to watch, but only because they had known Carol as Captain Marvel first. Their lives were rife with little things like that though, so they mostly shrugged and went with the flow. The relationship the Loki from his universe had struck up with both Winter and Peggy was
“Worry wart.” Steve just shrugged at the teasing accusation, giving him another squeeze. He was tempted to deliver another kiss - a friend kiss! - but settled for patting the blond’s chest instead. “Okay. Let’s feed me so I can drink and woo the mayor, who is not so happy with the way those buildings got damaged while we were fighting the Wrecking Crew.” They both winced at the memory and the scathing interview that had been circulating on the news since the battle.
"This," he started, relishing in the long pause afterward. "Is Rescue. You can change the name later if you really want, but I think it fits. You, Ms. Pepper Potts, have this annoying habit of saving me even when I don't want you to. You've been running my life for years, and you've always been good at swooping in and saving the day when I need it most. I know why you're doing this, and it isn't because you want to finally let everyone know how much of a badass you are under that sensible, non-nonsense attitude of yours." She laughed again with tears in her eyes, and when she put one hand to her mouth, he took hold of the other. "Rescue is sleeker and a lot more agile than Iron Man ever was. She's made for speed, not strength. I knew you wouldn't want to be a tank. A lot of what you've got access to are weapons to stun and distract... but you've also got what you need to take people out if you need to. You're gonna have to work with me a little though. I want you to be able to use your own personal fire power while you're in her, but it's gonna require some tweaking."
He could feel Winter processing that, mulling the memory over to try and find its truth. It was nice to know his friend felt comfortable taking that time, that he didn't feel the need to either pretend the memory was there immediately or get defensive. At first Winter had treated every mention of a shared memory like an accusation. Now they could actually talk about the past and it was fine, as long as he didn't expect more than Winter could give.
," Peter complained while they all headed down the hall to the elevator. "He isn't there now, so how could your weird GPS thingy have any idea where he 'should' be in that universe?"
"I want ya ta come on over ta the tower soon as ya feel ready, Peter Parker," he said as the kid got ready to go home and finish up his homework. "I'll talk ta Tony, find out why the hell he's bein' this way, so just get your butt ta the tower and I'm sure it'll all work out just fine."
how to respond before Tony was barreling forward. "I'm sure they'd love to meet your team. I've been working on a more portable version of their charging stations - little bastards love their 'beds' but this is more practical - and I could probably have them finished tonight. So I can do that while you pack a bag, and I'm sure your friends would rather leave early tomorrow instead of hanging around here, so I could have breakfast catered if you want? That way you don't have to cook right before the big trip. And--"
"Why don't you go ahead and ask Clint ta come get her. Never gonna get her to settle now that she heard he might take her out."
There was no 'Ultron Experiment'. Ultron was originally conceived of as a peace keeping initiative--
"They oughta be together." Harley's voice was gravel-rough, and his eyes red-rimmed and puffy. Kid had been a rock, but every day that his dads didn't wake up got a little harder on him. He'd been spending most of his time with Winter, who was looking equally ragged at the seams despite his general stoicism. Shellhead and Pepper were among the most visibly inconsolable, while everyone else was just... getting on as best they could, sharing shifts in the infirmary. "We didn't put 'em in the same bed since they were hurt, but if... if they're okay then we... we should..."
Clint answered after the first ring and seemed thrilled with the latest favor he'd be doing for Steve. He'd be there within half and hour and then they could get the poor girl home to be taken care of. The man also promised to warn Tony and get him to have a vet come to the tower pronto.
Also, on Thursday I got up enough courage to ask someone out for the first time in my 31 years of existence, and they said no, so. Instead of finishing up the editing that night when I was free I had to eat some ice cream, cry, and hope that I didn't make the guy feel so awkward he stops volunteering at the place where we met. ;.;
Thor was laying it on even thicker than usual, and Steve knew it was for his benefit. It was sweet, and the closest thing he had to family aside from Nat and the solyanka soup she made him whenever she thought his depression was getting the best of him. It had been so long since he’d had family, and he was starting to think he deserved to have one again. Maybe it was alright if he didn't cling to Bucky's memory quite so hard. Maybe he wasn't a terrible person if he tried to let his brother go so his memory could rest in peace.
didn't like when people insisted he was the same guy who'd fallen off that train. "He bled out until there was nothing left, and Hydra and the Red Room worked together to shove a monster under his skin instead. I am not," here Winter sneered, finally gracing Rogers with a single look. "
is that?" His platypus sounded strangled, and Tony didn't blame him even a little bit. Whatever Thanos had summoned to harass him was a thing of nightmares. Bigger than him by half, the pure white of its hide broken up by vivid spots of color that mimicked poisonous animals in their world. It was all teeth and spikes and
"Pfft. I can lift anything you can. Might have to put the suit on first, but that's not cheating it's playing smart. And no. Just..."
Mostly he feared that maybe he'd get back to his own world and then not be able to return home. He was also worried that Tony might misunderstand, that he might think Steve wanted to go back for keeps. He was even a little afraid that he might steal Tony and their family and just not let them come back and to hell with what happened to this place…
was leaning.” Out of the corner of his eye he saw Clint dodge a kick from Natasha, who hissed something at him in Russian. Bewildered by the byplay he looked to Steve… who was slowly but steadily turning pink.
Tony turned on his heel, fury and hurt radiating from him in waves as he paced. Part of him hated that he'd had to confront Tony about this, because it was so clearly part of everything that had led up to him being abandoned in Siberia. It was all wrapped up in layers of self-loathing, betrayal and pain. It was... it was a lot to handle, and poor Peter Parker had been unlucky enough to be caught up in that toxic mixture as it all imploded. None of this was really about the teen who was Spider-Man.
"So don't," Tony muttered against his mouth before sighing and pulling away. "What is it Fri-baby? What new disaster is about to fuck everything up?" The man sounded so tired, so resigned. He had no idea what was going on but he already wanted to kick the snot out of whoever was causing Fri to sound both hesitant and amused.
"Trust me, we were all scared. With the older Avengers maybe they weren't afraid of... of getting hurt, but..." Harley paused and tried to pull his thoughts together, wanting to get this right for Peter. He was the big brother - he
The machines he was hooked up to didn't appreciate the way his heart was pounding, and they'd given a few warning beeps already. Thankfully they weren't set up to alert Rhodey or Pep first for small jumps anymore. Fri got the initial reports of any small periods of hinky readings and if Steve was really back then she would know exactly why it was happening. She wouldn't get worried unless it lasted for more than a few minutes. If Steve was... if he was really there, Fri was definitely going to get worried. They might have a doctor walk in on their morning kiss, but that would be fine because it meant Steve was there.
"Where are you going?" Captain America was frowning again. Tony already missed the smile and hated himself a little for being the one to take it away.
The two looked at each other, grinned, then shrugged in unison. "No promises," they chorused. It was creepy and wonderful, because there was the shield and Tony was
It was impossible though, and Steve gave up the effort before long. Before they all had moved into the tower even, back when Tony had been hanging out at SHIELD. Watching the billionaire try not to belly ache about the facilities and the tech had been hilarious. He also spent most of their 'movie days' watching Tony instead of the screen. Training with Iron Man was as amazing as it was frustrating. His mind took turns Steve could never hope to predict, which was fine except for the way Tony usually forgot to tell the rest of them the  new plan. When the two of them were in sync with each other, it was dazzling, one of the most exhilarating things Steve had experienced. When they
The New Avengers are rumored to be courting superheroes from international locations, but for now the details are scarce. It is assumed that recruitment will remain active, as there are always new individuals developing or being discovered as having abilities that are 'super'.
"You aren't the boss of me you low-rent Tony Stark, so shut the hell up. Why the hell would you care about Bucky Barnes after what he
"Maybe. An' hey - once this happens I'll actually get ta touch it proper again. Get ta touch ya all over actually, for as long as I want without the risk of ya fallin' asleep halfway through." That was definitely one of the perks and he couldn't deny he was looking forward to it. They'd managed to get around his injuries a little, and fuck had it chafed to watch Steve be so damn
Our planet is hardly more than an infant compared to many others out there in the universe. Our weapons have been vastly inferior, we fight amongst ourselves incessantly, our space programs are often disjointed and underfunded. We have almost no real defense against invasion, Mr. Poppleton. Before now Asgard's protection kept us safe from those who would have taken advantage of our weakness to exploit our resources. That is no longer an option. We need to be ready to stand up for ourselves, and that is precisely what Mr. Stark and the others have been working towards. For you to insinuate he is attempting to recreate Ultron is offensive in the extreme.
Steve acknowledged him with a gentle squeeze, but his expression was still stone and his eyes still shooting death-beams Maybe-Debbie’s way.
"Hey Winter? Don't... don't go throwin' yourself outta any trains in this fight. I don't wanna lose ya like that again. So if anyone's gotta--"
"You're still grounded if'n ya say that again. I'll talk ta your ma about it, ya see if I don't. Shouldn't be usin' such language durin' official Avengers business."
"I'm not here to reassure. I'm here to make sure he doesn't panic and stab you." STAR growled at that, then zipped over to Natalia and tried to singe her ear. The super spy dodged, of course, and the wall ended up with a tiny streak of black instead. "Calm down, little firecracker. I'm sure it won't come to that."
and it was like a Lovecraftian nightmare. Had this sand and glitter between my... uh. You probably don't want to hear that part of the story."
"You heard him Stevie." And yeah, there was a gentler strength to this world's version. Steve wondered who he would be if he ever let himself get out from under the shadow of Rogers' expectations. "I... there's things I... you shouldn't have to hear it, punk, but there's things I need to say. So just... I'll be back later, you hear? So don't do anything stupid until I get back."
"No, it's because you showed me the next evolution of the design just after you brought your family to invade my tower. Just because someone is hurt doesn't mean they can't pay attention - remember that, Harls, might save your life someday - and so this is a ploy. A complete and total attempt to get my attention all to yourself and let me tell you something. I wholeheartedly approve of the result, but you don't need to pretend you need help for that to happen, got it? You never need a flimsy excuse to get me to come hang out with you, okay? People with weird connections don't need excuses. All you need to say is 'Tony, I want to spend some time with you'."
Steve was in love with him, he realized with sudden, startling clarity as the blond walked away. That was why the Man With a Plan was so fine with them being called 'mom' and 'dad'. He called the ‘bots his kids not because he was messing with Tony but because that was what he wanted them to be. Fuck, he was a moron. The signs were all over the place, and all the couple-y things had not actually been friend-things. Steve had been trying to woo him, so slowly and carefully that Tony hadn't noticed.
"Prob'ly." Fingers twisted in his shirt, tugging him impossibly closer as a laugh got huffed out against his skin. "So yeah, Tony. I feel that way about you. It's always been you and I hate that I messed up so bad when we first met that you don't think I could--"
Still. The comparative lack of people was nice. It let him stand outside without anyone stopping to ask if he was alright or to make idle chatter. Sometimes a fellow just needed some fresh air and a bit of room to breathe. With Thanos due to arrive within the next couple of days, he wanted to take every chance he could to take in the night sky. Tony had seen terrors up there, he knew, and now he had a small idea what that had been like. At least for him the beauty of the stars was still stronger than his fear of what was hiding in the dark between them.
He was supposed to be the Man With a Plan; it was time to stop mooning and get to work. There wasn't any reason he couldn't try his hand at wooing Tony. It would take a while maybe, because he couldn't do this wrong. If he lost what they had now, if he drove Tony away and they went back to barely speaking... God, that would just kill him. He didn't mind going slow if it meant he got it
"Yeah. Back when... well. Back before Erskine and the serum I was just skinny little Stevie Rogers. Mebbe my ma and Buck never minded huggin'n stuff, but nobody else ever wanted to, you know? Everyone knew I was sickly'n mebbe no one wanted to get attached. Then the whole world was at war,
One is that I totally get that the MCU Clint Barton is derived from the character as written in 'The Ultimates' run... but I don't like him so much. XD I like the 'Avengers Assemble'/'Hawkeye' Clint Barton, so that's the characterization I'm going with.
The frustration had drained from Steve's voice, leaving him sounding tired and sad. Tony never imagined him sad. Maybe - just maybe - it was safe to believe and open his eyes. Maybe this time his heart wouldn't break all over again.
Briefly the thought of a teen already carrying the title of hero niggled at his mind, but he quickly brushed that away. He'd gotten Underoos hurt, dragged him into a battle he'd never needed to be part of. Peter Parker had been better off without him and he didn't need Tony to keep poking his nose into his life. It was... it was better this way.
That was the day I knew Soul was right. I did not think I would ever choose one who wasn't the Sorcerer Supreme, but you proved me wrong. You are what I need to stop what is happening.
This chapter was SUPPOSED to be the fight against Thanos, but with what's going on in my country right now I am struggling very hard with action scenes. Writing violence in this moment feels wrong and puts me in a bad place. I've been trying since last week to get the fight done, and the attempts left me drained, sad, and with a handful of words each time that were never very good.
“Sure as shit do. But I don’t wanna… can we not talk about that? Gets me all heated’n ready ta punch someone, which is not… Christ I just wanna cuddle ya until we fall asleep again. I missed ya so much.” Now Steve’s voice sounded choked and it was enough to bring a round of tears to his eyes. “Every damn day. It was like I had a big hole inside’n even the good days hurt because ya weren’t there for ‘em. I was better off than ya were because I had people there that I could really trust, but it never… it was never enough. Not really. So I just—“
"Anyway the food is mostly done so he's plating it and he'll bring it in for both of you. I think he's nervous about meeting Steve here. I don't know why since even with the muscles he's not exactly intimidating."
"I know." He sounded close to tears to his own ears, shit. Brushing off her hand as politely as he could, he scrubbed at his face. Helplessness wasn't a feeling he was used to. This was like Afghanistan all over again, except even back then he could keep
would be coming to stay at least once a month or so. Tony was thinking of clearing out enough space to add a small second house for those who ended up visiting for longer than a few days.
"I can have you outta here in like, under a minute," Harley said quietly. "And if I think you're going into a panic attack, I
Part of him wanted to ask, to see if this constant feeling of possibility was just him. The sensible part, the part that had been drilled extensively over the years in his faults and fuck-ups, knew better. He'd rather wonder than lose what they had to awkwardness and hurt feelings.
Loki's fight with the Hulk had left his living room in less than pristine condition, but his bar had been untouched. Tony had been staring at a glass of whiskey for over an hour, reliving the fight on the Helicarrier over and over. It was supposed to have been caused by Loki's staff, by whatever the hell kind of bullshit magic powered it, but Tony knew better. He remembered the derision in Captain America's eyes and the sneer on his lips. He had countless memories of Howard telling him how little Captain America would think of him, and Howard had been right. Loki's staff had just brought it all to the surface sooner than might have happened otherwise. Captain America was never going to be a fan, and it was probably better this way. At least this way he hadn't had time to
To be as involved as he wanted to be, he needed information. If he was going to be a useful support to Tony then he needed to understand the context of it all. He'd already done it once in his lifetime - he was eager to do another deep dive into the history of the future. For all of that... he needed FRIDAY.
So of course it was during Katy Perry's masterpiece entitled 'Firework' that he turned - with a very impressive flip of imaginary hair - and came face to face with Captain freaking America.
"No, ya bloodthirsty thing. Gotta see if they'll listen ta sense and clear out on their own. Might still happen. What about it Rogers? Ya gonna walk away with your goons, or are me'n Starlight here gonna escort ya out?"
"Gwen Stacey. She's a good kid, mostly. Gets way too much shit from the media, but Pepper says I'm not allowed to lay waste to any more newspapers."
Unfortunately, we didn't have all day to sit and chat. Steve and Tony have taken in several teens and a few younger children, and they had plans with 'the kids' later. I've been invited back another time, and I look forward to the chance to get to really prepare for an interview knowing who Maverick is. Before I left, I couldn't help but bring up one last thing.
"Tell that to the fangirl who has both a taser and the will to fucking shock whoever the hell she meets. Have you ever been tased Steve? Because it sucks. Hard. Harder than I did in college, which--"
"My middle name is Brian," Steve offered with a smile while snuggling up to Tony. They're a good looking couple, I have to admit. He and Ms. Potts always made a splash, but somehow the two of them just look more... right. I'll let you judge that for yourselves, of course. I probably creeped them out with how much I was staring, but you can come to your decision using the pictures provided, including a couple candids available exclusively on our website.
"When Winghead is done with his primping we'll all talk about it," Shellhead grumbled against Lokes' shoulder. "Don't want to fight about it more than once." That was fair, Tony guessed. "How's the arm?"
Nearly three dozen orbs swarmed the chick with the spear, all guided by FRIDAY and capable of destroying a small army all on their own. It was too damn bad that the Black Order's army seemed
Despite all his bravado and the security of having people who loved him ready to fight at his side, he still winced when the elevator doors slid open. Rogers strode out first - of course he did - with a gun in one hand and that patriotic jaw set in a hard line that almost sent him into a flashback. He could have happily gone the rest of his life never seeing that expression ever again. At least he didn't have to spend too long taking in the details, because Nat - Natasha - exited on Rogers' heels. She
"You would never sent them without you unless things were dire," Lokes interjected when Shellhead couldn't seem to make himself continue. "We thought we might arrive to find you dead."
Not only did the tentacles have reach, they also held an unholy amount of strength that defied physics. He hadn't quite managed to get out of the way, and even the sloppy hit was enough to send him careening through the air. "Boss, I'm detecting a hairline frac--"
Tony Stark did not blush just because there was a naked guy a few feet away. Close enough to still hear talking to Dum-E even over the water and his ‘bot’s complaints. Steve was naked and close enough that Tony could see, if he wanted. Could touch if Steve would let him.
So he guessed Harley was right. There was something important he needed to start work on. Thanks to Rogers and his bestest friend, a slew of vulnerabilities had been brought to his attention that he needed to start fixing. Then there were the Accords to remake and new Avengers to recruit, because their little playground brawl had in no way stopped or slowed down the threat that was descending on them from space. And as much getting back in the game terrified him, he knew he was going to do it anyway.
"I keep thinkin' maybe it'll get easier," Steve murmured back, head on his shoulder. "Never does. But this time it's not forever."
"So I'll see you the time after that, maybe. I'll get to work on a better communication device too. I have some ideas that I'll flesh out. Me and me and maybe Loki can tinker out the bugs next time.
"Sirs?" Warmth flooded him at the thought of JARVIS giving him the same title as Tony. It was sort of like already being married. God, Tony wanted to get married within a year and he could hardly process the fact that he was getting what he'd wanted for so, so long.
"Dunno what you're sayin' exactly but I know you're callin' me names." The further he walked from the elevator with Winter's help, the more he tuned in to his surroundings. Lokes was in his kitchen, dishing out some kind of stew that smelled better than every delicious thing he'd ever eaten. Shellhead was easing Tony forward the same way Winter had him, and STAR was anxiously fluttering between them both, silent and worried and probably a touch angry.
Steve hadn’t left his side for longer than an hour since he’d been brought in. Tony strongly suspected he was using his old SHIELD quarters to shower and take the brief Nat-mandated breaks from his vigil. He had woken up in the night to see the blond sleeping in the uncomfortable hospital chair and more than once opened his eyes to find the man clutching his hand with a pensive look on his face. It was sweet, but also guilt-inducing to the extreme.
“That hurts pops, it really does,” Clint drawled while settling his chin on Tony’s shoulder. “He’s hurting my feelings, Iron Mom.” Tony didn’t roll his eyes through sheer force of will, fingers briefly stopping their dance over a set of schematics so he could pat the man on the head.
"But if... look. If Thanos gets all-a them Stones... we still don't know nothin' about the Soul Stone. If he's got that one too then he's gonna be a tough sonuvabitch ta beat. We might lose. If he gets them, if that plan-a his goes right... Winter, he wants ta get rid of half of all life. That's crazy and I hope we can stop it, but if'n we can't... if I'm part of that half I need ya ta do somethin' for me.."
Tony couldn't respond, partly because he didn't know how. The other reason was the lump of emotion that had lodged in his throat while his heart beat wildly in his chest. Steve searched his eyes  for a moment that seemed to stretch on forever before offering another little smile.
Natalia had been the one to ask him not to learn the language. He would have done it essentially to spy on their conversations, she pointed out, which was both a terrible motive and an invasion of privacy. Still, while he didn't know the meanings of most words he had begun to get an ear for them; it was fascinating to hear both the similarities and the differences between their voices. Winter's voice was a little harsher, but Bucky's was gaining strength while staying mellow. Bucky's words were rounder, just a little softer around the edges, while Winter tended to spit out his consonants like a challenge to the world. Their dialects didn't seem to quite match up either, or at least it didn't sound like it, but they were communicating nevertheless.
, they were going to have to sacrifice one of the civilian areas under attack to get another team to the compound to assist them.
"Yeah." The more the thought about it the more he warmed to the idea. "We could take the bots'n Starry Skies with us for sure, and didn't ya say that ya were close ta figurin' out a way ta transport Fri too?"
"First of all, the look on my face is not 'gross', it's the one you get when you love someone very much and you should only hope to be so lucky when you finally grow up. Also? You absolutely don't need help with that design, my budding little engineering genius. How do I know this, you ask?"
Steve paid fierce attention as Fri began to talk, taking in all the visuals she was throwing up. Things were similar to what he'd known in his own world - eerily similar - but there were enough differences that he could easily be thrown for a loop. So he didn't rush Fri forward, didn't give up and walk away when he realized just what he'd signed himself up for.
"Deckin' me out in your colors," Steve purred, prowling even closer. "Makin' sure everyone knows I'm yours... you claimin' me sweetheart?"
His mind was more than made up by the time Peter came back with a huge smile and more yogurt than was probably good for a person. The kid still looked ridiculous in his too-fancy, trying too hard outfit, but it was endearing rather than laughable now. It was a good thing he'd managed to keep from laughing, because he had a feeling the kid got laughed at enough. Probably would have ruined any chance they had at bonding if he'd reacted that same way.
His Tiny Adorable Steve was busy with Natalia and Peggy fighting the enraged glaive guy; spear girl was nowhere to be seen, which, well. Was probably fueling his rage. Though he tried not to get too distracted by that smaller-scale skirmish, it was
Those first two months of being a team had been... challenging. Without a common enemy it was hard to get every Avenger on the same page. Even being in the same room for longer than five minutes without any bloodshed had been a victory some days. There had been quite a few personality clashes, misunderstandings and glaring at first. The more time they spent together though, the more they relaxed. Fury was keeping them out of small-league fights for the moment and had even stopped giving Nat and Clint field missions - he wanted them all to be focused on building a team. A
Maybe his surprise wasn’t… well. He didn’t want to know what Steve thought about it until it was finished. His secret needed to be protected!
"Nah. Was just hugging. No matter what Howard told ya, I like hugs." He gave Tony a squeeze to emphasize the point, because he was pretty sure he was dreaming anyways - might as well take advantage of it. There was no way Tony Stark had been hugging him so long, no way that he was really cuddling against his chest while holding tight to his t-shirt. It was happening though, and he was both the happiest he'd ever been and nearabout nervous enough to pee his pants. If he fucked this up... "You can always ask for a hug, Tony."
"You said he was tortured and all'n that's why did it, so it’s understandable he’s having trouble. I guess mebbe he won't ever be like he was. It'll prolly get better though. With time."
Thor squeezed his shoulders, which was the only reason Steve realized he had come to a complete stop right outside the elevator. He glanced up at the god and found empathy in his expression. Every damn Avenger knew how he pined after Tony, who remained completely oblivious to the way Steve watched him.
They all wandered off, and Steve was pleased as punch when Tony walked with him to the elevator. Sure they were arguing over why Rainbow Road was awful - Tony didn't like how slippery it was while he was convinced that it took longer than usual to get put back on it after you went over the side - but they were both still grinning. It was such a good 'argument' that Tony even came all the way up to his floor and kept him in the elevator for a few more minutes.
Now if he could just forget the way Steve had said ‘our kids’ as easily as he breathed everything could get back to normal.
He had tried really, really hard not to let bitterness and fury taint the title. Going by Peter's widening eyes he hadn't quite managed.
"Better than repulsers, hammers, arrows and shields at least. Our insurance probably wouldn't cover that."
And honestly, Tony didn't talk much for the rest of the interview. He seemed happy to just be there, always touching Steve in some small way. They looked at each other like there was no one else in the room sometimes, and it felt unbearably private and intimate. The two of them are absolutely a couple, and I think those few news outlets still denying and demonizing said relationship might want to accept it and move on. Sitting there, watching them, it felt like one of the immutable laws of the universe: the sun rises in the east, the moon orbits the earth, and Tony Stark and Steve Brian Rogers are in love.
"Pfft. Never, ever believe that he's dead. Not without definitive proof, and even then you should be on the lookout."
had really come back to him? Well. The universe could suck it, because he was going to grab on tight and never, ever let go. Being alone was not an option if Steve hadn't made the smart choice to stay the hell away.
He still took the pills, stretched as best he could and gently worked his left arm a little. It was fucked, had been since Leipzig, and no amount of tinkering by Doctor Cho had taken the intermittent ache away. She just kept telling him he was lucky the fingers on that hand were still so dexterous.
He sighed quietly and for a split second wished his Tiny Adorable Steve wasn't so damn observant. But then... hadn't he spent most of his life wishing more people could see through the mask that was 'Tony
"Nat is kinda my go-to agony aunt for this. I think she might kill you if I talked to you instead of her. Or even just to you once in a while when she was off doing something else."
"You're a good kid." Harley's cheeks pinked, but the young man didn't even try to dodge the hug Steve wrapped him up in, just returned it with equal strength. "We did somethin' right with ya. I'll drag your pops home and we'll see ya tomorrow."
I'm sure. However, I suspect that if you look them over you will find that most if not all of them involve questioning the motives or actions of Mr. Stark. I have given you those answers already, and if you require more than I suggest you meet with Mr. Stark himself. Do you have any remaining questions about SI's role in the current endeavor? Substantive questions, if you please. This has been enough of a waste of my time, so I don't wish to prolong it dealing with petty minutiae that could be dealt with via written questions and answers.
Besides. Too much space and alone time to think probably wasn't good for any of the Avengers. They all had enough issues to make a fleet of psychiatrists as rich as he was.
"I never considered it might be Loki behind your appearance," Natasha answered, making a hysterical laugh start to bubble up his throat. She was so right, just not in the way she thought she was, and fuck they were a mess. "I let it go before and ignored how convenient it was that you showed up just when he was most vulnerable. I should have looked closer."
“If it means nobody else boxes you in the way they did I’m in. We need to get you some more of those little sandwiches first though. You didn’t get to finish your last plate before Senator What’s-his-name got to you.”
In a joint statement, the co-leaders of the New Avengers (Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes AKA War Machine and Captain Carol Danvers AKA Captain Marvel) have announced the lineup of the New Avengers Initiative. "The actions of a few former colleagues have damaged our reputation and standing in the international community," Rhodes said when pressed. "This new incarnation of the initiative aims to correct that." Captain Danvers added: "Working within the bounds of the Accords we can and will make a positive difference without violating the sovereign rights of those countries willing to accept our help."
"I think I fell asleep on the Quinjet. This isn't the weirdest dream I've had after a fight. I hope you took over flying before I conked out completely. And that you aren't asleep too. Fri could probably land the Quinjet alright, but I'd rather one of us was conscious for it."
"Yeah. Hey Underoos? Get over here, see if you can't wrap glaive guy up. Make it hard for him to get to his girlfriend."
defended just to come and coddle him and Steve. It was stupid and reckless, and if it was Lokes cooking breakfast they were all in for a treat. The demigod was an amazing cook, so he'd totally eat before he sent them all packing.
he was being an ass but stopping didn't feel like an option. Since Steve had come back he'd wanted so badly to believe it was forever, that he would be allowed to keep this. Finding out he couldn't
He never would have asked, and he still wasn't sure it was the best move - Steve's world needed the Defenders just as much as this one needed the Avengers. But they had offered, and there was no way Shellhead, Winter or any of the others were going to budge. Knowing that there were more than half a dozen extra fighters at the ready to defeat Thanos was almost enough to let him believe they could win.
- someone who isn't even old enough to drive without someone with a license in the passenger seat, no less - decided that all of you should live here. One of my most important duties is making sure you have a space of your own to work. I mean, you won't have all of the bells and whistles, or at least not the more dangerous ones. For that kind of stuff you'll have to work with me or someone else. You look surprised. Is it a good surprise? If you'd rather share with me--"
was feeling and it wouldn't be anything good. He needed to... Tony had to know that this wasn't enough to make him
Maybe Thanos only had two Stones to their three, but his gauntlet gave him a level of control and finesse that only Strange could match. Thanos could wield them at the same time, while they had split their forces to try and divide the Titan's attention and keep him from being able to get all three Stones in one fell swoop. Maybe their strategy had worked in the beginning, but they also only had a handful of fighter compared to Thanos' seeming thousands. Thanos could afford to use his forces as canon fodder; losing even one Avenger or Defender brought them closer to defeat.
"Wise decision." She pressed a kiss to his cheek before ruffling his hair, then left the workshop with the steady sound of her heels hitting the floor a familiar comfort to his ears. Tony couldn't ever properly say how much he loved her, just like his feelings for Rhodey, JARVIS and his boys would be impossible to articulate. Maybe someday he'd be able to say the same for Bruce, Nat, Clint and Thor.
Hell, with Rhodes there Tony hadn't even realized he was in the room. All of his focus was on his best friend who was more like a brother, and Steve knew he shouldn't be jealous. They almost never saw each other in person and they had been friends for decades - if Buck hadn't fallen and he hadn't gone into the ice, Steve thought they would have ended up that way too. So turning green with envy over the way Tony was draped over Rhodes' back made him a complete ass. Wishing Rhodes was far, far away so Steve didn't have to watch Tony crawl into his lap during movies was even worse. Hating the fact that Tony was hardly going to look at him for the length of Rhodes' visit was unworthy of him, and his ma would give him an earful over such shameful feelings if she could see him now.
"You're a dork, cookie crumble." It was impossible not to blush whenever he heard that stupid nickname so he didn't even try. He tried to ignore the way Tony chuckled, the sound shivering pleasantly along his spine. "So... we have a dog. If you come home with a baby next time we are going to have words."
"Just because I didn't ever go steady with anyone doesn't mean I'm a damn virgin. Just never met anyone worth committin' to. Well, Peggy was, but we didn't get there in time. Don't know why everyone today thinks nobody was havin' sex back then. We just weren't as loud about it."
"Let's get you home, princess. It looks like you aren't hurt too bad, but I didn't want to put a leash on that awful collar of yours. Cuttin' that off first thing, I promise. I'm gonna call a car-- no, I'm gonna call Clint. Animals all seem to love him, so hopefully you won't run scared once he pulls up. I think Happy might scare ya away even if he's a big softy, yes he is. Clint'll know what to do'n then we'll get you home. Christ, I can't wait to introduce you to Tony. He's gonna love you, I just know it. And I'm sure you'll love him too. He's awful easy to love. Just you wait and see. It might be weird, living with us Avengers, but I'll make sure you're taken care of, don't you worry."
"Prob'ly a good idea. All-a our girls on one team? We'd be doomed. Wouldn't abandon ya ta join 'em, but yeah. We'd lose." Tony sniffed a dismissal at the notion even if he agreed with it. Pep opened her mouth and he was quick to head her off by clearing his throat.
If Tony was ready to cuddle the fuck out of him, Steve was fully prepared to plan the shit out of their future.
It was so close to feeling like real friendship, like family. He just wished Howard Stark wasn't still half-alive in his head, jeering and reminding him of how pathetic he was. It would be easier to believe it was all real if he didn't have a voice in his ear that pointed out all the ways it could be a lie.
"Nah. Give it here - match is about to start'n I'm gonna lose for sure without it." He wanted that stupid dirty rag more than he'd wanted just about anything since he'd woken up and lost everything. Tony wavered for a second but ended up handing it over. Feeling brave, Steve closed his fingers over Tony's while their gazes locked. For a heartbeat it felt like a moment, like maybe Tony was going to understand how gone he was. Instead he chuckled a little and pulled his hand away, leaving Steve holding the cloth. Disappointed and upset at himself for it, he tucked the thing into the collar of his shirt so that a corner of it was visible.
But Tony was a different story. There was no way he'd let himself rest easy at the compound, not with Wanda's magic still fresh in his mind. If he wanted his lover to fall into an actual sleep, one that was healing instead of draining Tony further, he needed to get his guy home.
Funnily enough, it was the continued reminders that Captain America would find him weak and fragile that hurt him more. Hearing over and over how much his childhood hero wouldn't be able to stand the sight of him didn't make it any easier to swallow. It always burned going down, as harsh as the glass of whiskey Howard had thrust into his hand when he was twelve along with a demand to stop being so goddamn sensitive and be a man instead.
Despite fears that the falling out - dubbed the 'Civil War' by some - between the old Avengers team would leave Earth defenseless, the new team is ready and willing to take up the mantle. The Accords Committee members that have given statements are pleased with the way the members are coming together. "We are in good hands," said one member on the condition of anonymity. "Colonel Rhodes and Captain Danvers both have steady hands and a refreshing willingness to work with the Accords instead of against them. I firmly believe that the mistakes of the past can be avoided, and that the accountability and oversight we provide is a key element of that."
The gym Tony had put together was a goddamn delight, and not only because Steve was sweet on the fella who'd supplied it. There was the expected stuff, sure. Weights and a sparring area and punching bags, but it all had a twist that was patently Tony Stark. Some of it was even robots, which was probably his favorite part. Well, unless he or Thor broke one of them on accident, because Tony would mourn and fuss over each piece of tech like it was one of his kids. Steve knew they weren't, that they didn't think or feel the same way as JARVIS, Dum-E, U and Butterfingers did. Tony still loved them though, so he did his best not to be
Something in Rogers melted, and for a second Steve understood why Tony had been so desperate to call the man a friend. For just a few moments he could see why Bucky would want to stick to Rogers' side, and he finally knew why the Avengers had been willing to follow him into both battle and ruin.
"Bucky would never." Rogers was rejoining the conversation with narrowed eyes, lips pressed into a thin line before he continued. "I don't know how things went so wrong in that other world that you would suggest something like that. Did they remove your programming? Do you even remember who you are? You’re Bucky--"
Tony was careful not to let himself hope his childhood hero would come along. Careful to the point where he didn't even look at the guy, actually. He felt Captain America's steady gaze on him though, and he was pretty sure the man looked between him and Clint a few times.
"Tony? Think ya could maybe tell me what you're actually talking about?" As much as he loved hearing Tony ramble, he really, really wanted to know what the present was. Besides, his fella would probably be happier if he saved the really long rambles for when he was going over the features of... whatever it was.
Also will be getting back to the schedule that I promised. So there'll be a chapter every week on Sunday until I finally wrap this up.
Loki scoffed, but his lips were pulled up in a tiny smile. Maybe not everyone would notice it, but he'd gotten used to looking for those tiny signs of happiness. "I don't believe in such drivel, Steven. You should know that."
"Pegs," Steve said immediately, a smile tugging at his lips despite everything. "She's gonna want ta punch me for not visitin' before now."
Nah. Steve had known he'd never have any of it, and he'd been mostly okay with that. It had been a little harder to come to terms with the way he sometimes thought he wouldn't mind coming home to another
"Sounds good." Sounded almost like a date, really, but it couldn't be. Not with the way Tony had been so strange around him lately. Not with how he'd avoided him for that past few days. It was just a friendly movie between friends, so he absolutely should not try to sneak a few kisses once they were snuggled together on the couch.
"Pops, I'm gonna need you to breathe," Harley urged in his ear, cutting through some of the fear and hurt swirling inside of him. "If you can't do that I'm getting you out of here."
Dimly he heard Rhodey order Harley off the field to replace his suit; further away still was the panicked revelation that Gamora and Drax were both out of commission and being taken to the infirmary. They were losing bodies too quickly, with too little to show for it. If they couldn't change the lay of the land
As he thought about it more, there was a tightness in his chest. The world began to tunnel in around him, and the sounds of the forest warped into something almost unrecognizable when they hit his ears. Was he going to pass out? It kind of felt like he might pass out, and he wasn't even sure why--
"I know. Lemme see if I can't toss 'em out on their keisters, okay? And if I can't we got a couple-a folks up in the penthouse who'd love ta help."
He tried to figure out why the fuck at least half of the Defenders core team was loitering in the tower while they ate, but Lokes kept fending them off. Steve didn't seem to notice, probably because he was basking in the glow of having Shellhead and Winter sitting at the same table and breaking bread. It was a pretty new development, and the pair were still stiff and painfully polite to each other.
"No problem. Good luck." As soon as Steve had hold of the bag, the teen was gone - he thought maybe his helper was actually scared of them, which made his willingness to run the errand even nicer. The bag with the brush and shampoo he set off to one side and hoped he would need later. The other bag had two different kinds of treats in it, and he studied them before choosing the jerky.
"I was at the same briefing as you were, Rogers." Shellhead's tone hadn't been exactly friendly, but everyone ignored that in favor of focusing on the task at hand. "Don't need you hovering either babe. I've got Punisher, be back after the drop." Lokes peeled away reluctantly, returning to his position circling Vision and Wanda where he did his best to keep the prowling forces of Thanos at bay.
"Hell yes." The shorter man caged him in, then climbed up over top of him. He was pressed down until his back was flat against the workbench and his hands tangled in those soft blond locks. Steve's hips rolled in a way that made his eyes roll back in his head. "Fuuuuck..."
"Not as good as you," he pointed out while fighting a blush. "He loves you, ya know. I'm just entertainin', not anything real special to him."
"Hey," he interrupted, stepping back to look Harley in the eye. "It doesn't matter that I didn't think Rogers would hurt him or that I didn't know we were playing for keeps. I put him in the ring with dangerous people, and that's on me. I'm the adult, and I made a bad call. I have to live with that, and I'm going to make damn sure it never happens again."
Thanks go to Arboreal for the idea, and for letting me run with it once it was given. <3 I appreciate the patience and understanding!!
, I've read almost all of her papers. Got an A on the last report I did with them as a basis. There's been speculation that she has a fully operational Cradle for years, but no one's been able to... Did you get to see it? You have to tell me everything, Steve. Everything."
Rhodey pulled away from circling above the Tesseract and joined him on a flight path to the petals of death. One of them seemed to have fully unloaded it's cargo of raging beasts, and two more only had a couple of the monsters trickling out. In unspoken agreement he and Rhodey ignored them and went for the three petals still disgorging small armies onto the battlefield. If they could cut that flow off, the tide of the fight could be turned and maybe they could win even without a last minute arrival from the Benatar. Though he was still kind of hoping that might happen, no matter how annoying Quill was.
Tony was a little older and had a few more wrinkles, a few strands of silver in his dark hair. Shellhead's dimples were less pronounced and his overly complicated goatee was a little rougher around the edges. Their scars were a little different, but they were both wearing ridiculous shirts and ripped jeans. Their facial expressions were such a close match, and God did he love them both even if it was in a different way for each.
"Not really - it's just not something I do in front of other people. Ever. Well, Rhodey's the exception, obviously, and I buy massive amounts of shoes to keep Pep quiet about anything she stumbles upon me doing down here." Which was money well fucking spent and much more likely to work than a standard issue NDA. "J probably has videos for his blackmail folder - yeah, don't think I don't know about that or about how Rhodey got those photos of me, you traitor - but honestly this is peanuts compared to everything else he has. But you? Uh-uh. Oh no. You don't get to leave this room until you gimme some dirt on you so that we're even."
Eventually they called it a draw when Thor and Bruce joined them. Mario Kart was rolled out instead, but they only got through a few tracks before Thor cracked one of the controllers in his excitement. That was their cue to separate until dinner - it was Thursday, which meant after that they would throw on a movie that Thor picked. Tony had snickered like a child while laying out that rule, the god smiled indulgently at him the whole time.
"FRIDAY was right - you do sound like him. Not the accent or anything 'cause he doesn't have one, but the rest of it. You sound just like Cap. I mean, I didn't talk to him long because, you know, we were on opposite sides, but still. Are you sure you aren't him?"
I know, Little Mechanic. You know me but you do not remember. You were even more of a child when I touched your life and made you mine.
You still feel loyalty to your old boss and I can understand that. We're only trying to get to the truth here, Ms. Potts.
He grinned in answer and caught up to the god, both of them heading for the elevator. "How's things at home?" It was always a risky question, but he tried to ask it regularly. Thor's heavy sigh was answer enough, but he didn't mind when a muscled arm draped over his shoulders. Steve thought he was probably one of the only mortals that could support Thor's full weight and the god took regular advantage of that. It was actually kind of nice, having him lean so heavily against his side. Sometimes it felt like Buck was back, at least in spirit even if Steve would never--
Matt thought the whole thing was hilarious but still wouldn't let the Avengers set foot in Hell's Kitchen.
. He was going to have to check in with his lover later. "Neither of you Steves is invited." He turned on his heel and made to leave the room, though he did wait in the doorway for Bucky to join him. When Rogers - who still seemed on the verge of blowing a gasket - tried to follow first, Bucky settled a hand on his arm.
"If I hadn't been here at the beginning I would be nervous to meet Steve too. He's so important to Boss, after all." Besides that his and Vision's relationship was already a little strained and strange. Of course the man born of JARVIS would be nervous about a new variable being introduced to their balancing act. They were still so careful around each other as they navigated being family.
"So I was gonna give this back to Steve, but I have a new plan." Tony looked intrigued while Shellhead reached for the pouch that looked suspiciously like a fanny pack on his waist. "Loki made this for me - it isn't as cool as  the one Strange gave to Steve, but it does the job."
"I'd kill myself before takin' advantage-a him that way," Steve told him, doing his best to stay calm and in control. If they both lost their cool it would only end in blood.
"Yes!" Jan's little fist pump was adorable, and he couldn't help but 'awww' when each of his human boys got both a fist bump and a ruffle to their hair. She was definitely the favorite aunt - Pep was going to be so peeved.
Looking back, Tony could admit that he had been lonely. Not to anyone else or even out loud, but at least to himself he acknowledged it. He hadn't had an abundance of friends, and most of his 'peers' had been at least seven or eight years older than him. It hadn't fostered a lot of healthy relationships, which was why Rhodey was something of a miracle. Jarvis had been more than a miracle - Jarvis had fucking
"Sorry. Almost. You got me flowers," he added by way of explanation. "I saw 'em and I... I just... I knew. Had ta kiss you then." Something almost like sorrow passed over Tony's face and he couldn't help the wounded sound that punched out of his throat. He hated when the genius looked sad, especially when it was his fault that it had happened. Tony should never be sad, especially not now that they'd just started. "I'd love to hear your speech, sweetheart. Sorry I ruined--"
"I know. But this is what I wanna do. This is what feels right ta me. So. Ya gonna fight me on this, or are we gonna put our heads together and figure out how to break this to da?"
"Everyone?" Peter sounded doubtful, and suddenly he knew what their da and pops meant when they said that sometimes he and Peter sounded so
as he gasped for air, now complete with a worried frown and a new water bottle at the ready for when his cough finally subsided.
Steve's mind stumbled over the question - Russian was harder than he had thought when he'd asked Nat to teach him. He still loved it though, even when she spent hours refusing to speak English to him. The language was completely new, with no real associations to anything in his past. Sure he'd heard it a few times at the front, but not often. Hearing it from Nat's lips never sent him back, never had his brain making connections that threw his thoughts into a downward spiral.
