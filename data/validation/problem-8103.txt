“Would it be enough for a start that I enjoy it? Obviously I want it to be the both of us, but if you’re feeling uncomfortable, maybe we should try to, you know, just concentrate on me for a start”, Tony suggests, hoping he doesn’t come off as selfish because that’s really not what it’s about, but finding a way to get Steve to relax. He kisses Steve’s jaw, lowering his voice a little. ”Then, if you feel like it, I’ll gladly shower you with attention.”
”I don’t see your point”, he mumbles against Tony’s skin.
He leans to press his lips against Steve’s cheek.
It’s an absurd thing to have to contemplate at the door of death. Steve has no desire to risk having a god/human hybrid, never mind the mess it would mean between him and Tony if Tony does come back. Tony would understand, though, Steve knows it. Of course he would. But would Steve still be enough for him barren, unable to have more children?
Steve’s too exhausted for anger. Besides, he knows Thor’s just disappointed in himself. Too exhausted for compassion either, Steve just pulls the door shut after him without answering.
”I’m sorry. I wish there was something I could do.”
Tony snorts. Steve has realised that Tony isn’t driving towards home a while ago. He doesn’t really care – he had wanted to go home, but right now he feels like he could sit in the car for hours, not talking, just driving around. It’s just good to be near Tony, even if he is still a little pissed.
“Myself”, Steve tells him, and he’s not trying to be Captain Obvious here, he just simply doesn’t know what else to say. ”I don’t know whether I like it or not. I don’t hate it.”
Steve’s not sure how and if this is going to work. He’s friendly with Thor, would call the man his friend  even, but definitely not like he’s – was – friends with Bucky or even Sam. Thor has always felt too different from them to get close to, too distant and busy with the problems of his own world. It isn’t like Steve is the easiest person to really get to know himself.
He swallows tightly.
It sounds exactly like something a person trying to gently break up with someone would start with, and Steve’s heart skips a beat, his throat feeling tight. When Tony doesn’t immediately continue, Steve cannot take the silence.
“Yes, princess.”
Tony growls quietly around his bite, and Steve is hard-coded to show submission. He goes limp like a puppet cut from its strings, a surge of satisfaction filling his mind. Tony brings a hand up to pet his hair as he then lets go, licking the mark he’s left before kissing it. The mark won’t stay for long, a perk of the serum Steve has had to learn to live with, but the purpose, the mixing of their scents, is fulfilled nevertheless.
”I know it does. Been trying to air it, even asked Nat yesterday whether it still smells. She said she couldn’t smell anything.”
“Pretty”, Tony observed, looking at Steve displayed on the desk. He took the Vaseline jar and scooped a generous amount of it onto his fingers.
“Whatever you want, sir.”
It seemed Steve had gained a bit more control of his limbs after his orgasm, because his nails found Tony’s back and started to scrape it demandingly, making Tony realize that his thrusts had halted. Although it was sweet that Steve had climaxed, it alone didn’t mean much during heat for his satisfaction. He needed to be knotted, as the scratches forming on Tony’s skin made evident, and Tony obediently picked up a pace again.
”Will do, boss.”
”I want only you to see, Tony.”
His baby. His perfect, innocent child had been taken away from him, and when Thor had gently touched his shoulder Steve had flinched and then screamed until his lungs gave out. Eventually, Nat and Thor had walked him out of the battlefield.
Later that night, Tony leaves the lab after the day and finds Steve already in their quarters – well, his quarters now dubbed theirs –, sitting on the bed in his thoughts. They’re almost finished with the gauntlet, and he tells Steve that. Steve nods, then sighs quietly as Tony sits beside him.
”Would you get on the floor for me?”
Steve expects to get another hit onto his ass or thighs, but Tony moves to his side and the whip lands on Steve’s arm instead, making him whine painfully. A few more slashes follow the first, and it stings so nastily that Steve’s arm almost escapes the whip against his will.
”Do you want to feel that, honey? Feel my cum filling you?” Tony keeps going, because it seems to be working. It’s working on Tony himself, honestly, his cock starting to beg for attention between his legs.
”Tell me. What can I do?”
”Yeah, well…” Tony rubs his face. He’s not ready to talk about it. ”How are you holding up?”
Steve’s condition gnaws at him, too. Tony had managed to say the right things when Steve had told him about the sickness, to say that they’d sort it out somehow, but he can only wish he was really that confident. The situation is terrifying. How can he be strong enough for Steve when he’s so afraid, so wrapped up in his own misery?
”Was that too much?” he asked, a studying, slightly concerned look in his eyes.
Steve was never easy to handle. Not that Tony has ever seen omegas as something that needed to be handled, but it was just a fact that not many alphas would have tolerated his nature. What kind of an omega got up to an alpha’s face in an argument, challenging him to ”go for a few rounds”? It was beyond imagination, yet that’s exactly what Steve had done. Sure, he’d been influenced by the Scepter like they all had, but Tony had never witnessed anything like it nevertheless.
But because Tony doesn’t, after a few weeks Steve decides to confront the elephant in the room himself. Tony’s at his place and they are currently watching a game of football after having some lazy afternoon fun on the sofa, when Steve turns his eyes nervously on Tony.
“I… I don’t know, sir”, he mutters lamely in the end.
Steve looks at Emmett.
”I feel obliged to remind you again of how admirable of an achievement you’re throwing away, boss”, FRIDAY tries. ”It has been one-hundred-and-”
”Is he – is he okay?” Tony asks from Happy as Steve tries to remember how to breathe.
When Steve doesn’t answer, Tony leans down and nuzzles his hair.
Steve wondered if his own, not-that-secret itch to sometimes utter ”daddy” in bed to Tony had started from all of the times he’d heard Tony call himself that to his robots. It certainly hadn’t helped.
”You know how they say that omegas will always listen to their alpha’s authority in the end? In my life that is also called bullshit.”
”Steve, I understand, it was my mistake”, Bucky tries, but Steve ignores him. Tony’s eyes are challenging him, and a part of him is satisfied that he’s managed to rile Tony up.
Steve looked at Tony and he was breathtakingly beautiful, lips parted into the moans pushing out of him and his expression openly vulnerable from pleasure. Steve felt a warm jolt in his abdomen, a hum pushing out of him, too.
”Well, good.” Steve kept his voice neutral. “Have you had time to look at my headphones?” he asked. “I mean, it’ll take your engineering genius ass five minutes.”
Tony crosses his arms.
He then lowered his weight onto his elbow, wringing his hand so that he was able to push it into Tony’s hair. He pulled it gently to get Tony to expose his neck and leaned to whisper into his ear as he quickened his pace.
"He said middle-class??" Tony had a hand to his chest. "I'm insulted, offended, hurt even."
Valentine's Day is coming up.
When Mary didn't answer, he looked over to see her hand over his mouth, but her eyes were sparkling. "That's because those were his first steps, Tony."
Meg got up, nodding to Steve, and letting her hand rest gently on his arm before going for the nursery. Steve looked at Bucky and they heard the door close. The brunette stood up to face Steve, but was able to keep the couch between them at least.
"He scares the hell out of me," Tony admitted quietly, looking down at the floor. "Scares me cause, well, I like it. Damned fool makes me happy, like, really happy."
“Thanks,” he gave her a nod, before turning back towards Steve. The blonde got up from his seat, giving a polite nod to Dr Cavanaugh, and slipping his arm around Tony’s waist. He pressed a little closer to Steve, and there was a sense of calmness around him. Steve really hated that they’d have to break that when they got back home.
If the results were positive,... Well, he wasn't actually sure. They would probably try to pay her off, enough money both Mother and baby would be set for a good many years. He was 27, the CEO of a Weapons Manufacturing Company, he traveled when he wasn't out on his own, he spent long hours in his workshop at home, and in the R&D labs at the office, and just generally wasn't responsible enough for a child. Also, two hours was not enough to make a life decision, while nursing a hangover.
"To tear us apart," Steve said, like it was the simplest answer in the world.
"-kick-butt Boba Fett!" The older boy amended his words, but never stopped the play fight.
, girl. He reached down, paused for half a second, then picked her up. Tiny fingers wrapped around his thumb and he sucked in a breath. Tony was suddenly leaning in towards Steve's ear. "Peter did the same thing to me," he said softly.
“You want to drive one of my babies that isn’t the SUV or towncar?” Tony pushed out his lower lip. “Baby, I love you, but I think we’re gonna have to re-evaluate how much I love my cars. There might be graphs and pie charts involved.” Steve rolled his eyes and shook his head, then motioned towards a couple cars.
"What if I can't do it?" Tony whispered. "I can barely talk to you or Mary, hell even Jarvis, about what happened. I don't know if I could open up to some stranger. Everyone knows who I am."
"I should be asking you that," Tony shot back, leaning back a little to make sure she wasn't injured. "Who just runs into a dangerous situation like that." Mary raised an eyebrow, mouth open about to say something before Tony stopped her. "That isn't already involved in said situation."
“I can’t say I wouldn’t agree with that,” Julie answered back, briefly running her fingers across Wade’s head. She was about to head for Wade’s bedroom when Steve shook his head a little. She frowned, then nodded as understanding dawned on her face. Julie instead moved towards the door to her bedroom and Steve followed.
Tony gasped. “You’re eating donuts without me??”
"Look at you! You made it over to me!" Tony blew a raspberry on Peter's cheek and set him in his lap. "Mary, why didn't you tell me he had learned to walk?" He was secretly keeping a folder on his private server at home of all of Peter's firsts. It was something that Jarvis had suggested.
"He seems to be taking to it very well," Steve commented.
"Stop on up on your break, snag some food," Tony told him as he took a step back away from the desk.
"I think world shaping situations have a tendency to make someone feel that way," Tony commented. "I didn't find out much where I was, a few comments in passing, but what exactly happened to SHIELD?" He knew what he read from Howard's journal, but he was hoping that maybe Steve would tell him something different.
Vee did not like Obadiah Stane. More than she disliked Howard. Howard of course thought nothing of it, knowing how particular the Eevee was when it came to people. She didn’t snub Maria, tolerated her, but never sought her out. She did like Jarvis and his wife Ana though. That was probably because of the way that they treated Tony, how they practically raised him better than his actual parents. When Ana died, Vee mourned with Tony and Jarvis, and when Jarvis died when Tony just a teenager.
"So just another quiet night of controlled chaos?" Tony knew there was a reason he put this man in this building. He liked him.
He finally decided one a non-plaid, blue button up, slipping a black sport jacket on over it, paired with some khakis. He would have rather worn his leather jacket, but he doubt that would look good. Steve stepped out of his room and saw Tony coming out of Phil's room, already changed, and Steve couldn't help but appreciate how much the man could clean up. He of course had seen him on TV and online in suits, but he had gotten used to the casual t-shirt and jeans Tony in person. Tony was wearing a white buttons down, the sleeves rolled up to his elbows, black waistcoat with red accents, and some kind of multicolored tie underneath, paired with black suit pants. His hair had been styled, and his beard was trimmed, and he looked impeccable, even not in the full suit.
"Stark, how much do these kids know about Star Wars??" Sam couldn't help it, he had to know about the geek fest going on.
"Because I know you, Tony, sometimes I know you better than you know yourself." Bruce took a sip of his tea. "So, before you think that you're robbing the cradle, or whatever, really think about what it is you want. If you want to start something with Steve, that's fine, and if you want to move slow, that's okay, too. Think about what you want in the future, then decide if that's something you think you could give him, and yourself."
"And what exactly are you going to do when they move?" She pursed her lips a little. "Are you going to stay here, and-"
Tony grinned and pat Steve’s chest a couple times. “Now go out there and gain your dignity back, because you just saw your daughter take her first steps.” Coulson threw the ball to Bucky and Steve ran over, kissing Jamie’s head, then Peter’s, and ruffling Wade’s hair before going back to the court.
Steve lifted his eyes to glance at Tony, then back down to the tablet. Tony wasn't going to push, he was too tired to figure it out if Steve wasn't going to-
"Yeah, she's pretty awesome." Wade nodded, then flopped back on the bed as well in an impressive spin. He tucked his hands behind his head.
“Tony.” Tony grunted a little. “Tony, look at me.” Steve physically turned Tony’s head to look at him. He could see the pronounced circles under his eyes, pale and turning purple. He frowned a little sadly; Tony was back to avoiding sleep.
"Just a little bit more," Tony told him, pulling him up to his lap, wrapping him up in a hug. Peter wiggled a little, but he didn't fight to get away. "We'll still have boy time, and we'll still hang out in the workshop. That won't change." Tony bit his lip a little. "Maybe one day, she'll be like a little sister?" Peter whipped his head around to look at Tony with what should have been an adorable frown, but it was there, the wrinkle between his eyes. "Yeah, you're right, one thing at a time." He kissed Peter's head, holding onto him. "It's just going to be some adjustments, that's all."
"Potts!" Mary stood up quickly, looking up when she heard Tony's voice, slipping the ear piece in.
(See the end of the chapter for
"That's information that I don't feel like-"
He had told Wade that his Mom had to go somewhere else to get some medicine, that she hadn't been able to get to Jackson. Tony wasn't sure if Wade had been close to Jackson or not, and didn't really feel that he should be the one to tell him he was dead. Tony glanced in the mirror to check on Wade every so often, watching the boy continue the came on the tablet.
“Uhhhhhhh,” Peter let his mouth hang open for a few seconds. “Looks! Mostly. Both. Both is good,” he nodded.
Steve pushed himself up from the couch, putting the tablet down on the coffee table, and following Tony. "Pool noodles?"
"You'd better think we're dangerous," Mary said to him. "We're gathering out lost Sister into the Sisterhood." Tony took a step back from her. "When is Pepper coming back to New York?"
"They have a name then?" Steve asked, but Tony shook his head.
. He knew that Steve was gesturing at their own outfits though.
"Waiting for mission details," he answered her, rolling his left shoulder a little, the gears whirring in the arm. "Confirm target, Colonel Michael Wilson?"
"I'll be nice and give you two reason." George held up one finger. "The police would take too long to get here-"
(See the end of the chapter for
"They'd take the children, use them, train them," Bucky argued. "She really could have picked anyone better to date." Steve snorted softly, nodding.
The phone rang through the workshop until Mary picked up. "Tony?"
"And you weren't around when he eventually married, and had a son," Mary countered. "That Howard was older, and had seen more, then when you knew him." Mary stepped closer to Steve, and it was clear now why she was trusted to be Steve's Handler. It didn't matter that she was several inches shorter than Steve, she held herself better than several Generals that Steve had known in the Army. "If you read the files, then you know that Tony was also only Fourteen years old when he lost his parents, so I'm not sure what exactly you and Tony would be reminiscing about. Tony was born thirty years after you went down in the ice. Had knowing who Tony was had become necessary information for you to know, then I would have told you." Mary met Steve's narrowed gaze with her own.
” Tony frowned. That voice was familiar, but different from the one he had heard. “
"I found a tickle spot," Steve said, pressing his lips to the side of her neck and blowing a raspberry. She squealed and kicked her legs, and now Steve was laughing with her. "Look at that face!" He leaned in to do it again, but her hands were pushing at his face, still giggling though. Tony was holding his phone up, recording now. "You don't want that?" He blew a little raspberry on her hand and she was pulling them back with renewed laughter.
He had seen the boys off with their books, Jamie against his hip, before heading back to the bedroom. Steve held onto her with one arm, his other hand holding onto a little container of crackers that she was still snacking on. She made a little noise when she saw Tony, looking over towards him. “’addy,” she mumbled, looking up at Steve. The blonde smiled at her and nodded.
"Well, Mom's tend to know best," Tony said with a nod. "Wanna know what I think?" Wade shrugged a little, but kept looking at Tony. "I think that you've got like, way too much energy. I got that sometimes. So you just have to find different ways to burn it off, and you've got like no fear, I swear."
"It's all ill-timed don't you think?" Tony turned his head to look at her. "Just after, whatever the hell we all went through, and I'm not exactly the most stable person in the world. There's a reason that I've been single for so long."
========
“Good, because I already have a bag packed for you, and there’s a car waiting, and the jet is all ready to take off.” Steve grinned at Tony’s slightly impressed look. “I’m learning quickly how to utilize what’s available. I happen to be dating this guy who has a private jet, and more than one house. Seems to me that there is no use in ignoring it, so I’ll use it.”
Tony pulled off his sunglasses and met the man’s eyes in front of him. The bags under his eyes were starting to become noticeable from the lack of sleep that Tony was getting thanks to the nightmares. “Something happened last year, during the battle. I really don’t know how to explain it, but something happened when I was alone with Loki. He claims that he was under the control of some other being, out there, in space.”
"She did a lot." Tony pulled away from her slowly. "A lot of other horrible things happened, like finding out that my father helped usher in Hydra, and was conditioning me to be Mr Fix-It for the Winter Soldier." Tony moved away from the wall before she could say anything. "There are probably a lot of things that need my attention, but I need to make sure that those I love are safe. Peter, and now Jamie, I need to keep them safe from those that want to hurt me, that would try to use them against me."
"You said he was in the military."
“It would not be in your best interests,” Loki simply said. “I have been here for a while, peaceful existing, breaking my own mental chains.”
“But this won’t hurt me,” Tony rasped out. That’s all he wanted, wanted to not hurt anymore.
"Okay!" Peter said with a grin, hopping up to his feet. Tony chuckled and pulled out two red clip-on ties. He passed one to Steve and they put them on the boys. "I have taken two wily, scrappy, little boys, and I've turned them into handsome little men!"
"A couple weeks after he was born," Tony answered. Rhodey was trying to figure out just how long Tony knew about this, and how long he had been keeping it a secret. "No one else knows about him, or his mom," Tony prompted. "Not even Pepper or Happy. Well, technically Pepper knows, but she doesn't know that the paternity test was positive. Not the point I was trying to make, but-"
“I appreciate it,” Bucky told him, standing up. “Well, your other kid is asleep, but that one is all you, Stevie. She’s stubborn, and even looking at the stars won’t make her fall asleep.”
She trilled again in approval at the nickname. “Vee! Vee!” Tony giggled a little, wiping any remaining tears from his eyes, and started to pet her with both hands.
"When I want something bad enough." Tony leaned his head forward, but Steve twisted his head, foreheads still together. "We aren't in the gym."
"There's no room for common sense in science," Tony threw back jovially. He took a breath and let his serious tone take over. "I really need your help, here, Bruce." Tony pulled out a small silver device from his pocket. He placed his thumb over the little groove and a little needle shot out, taking a sample of his blood. "I think that I may be in over my head, and I'm running out of time." Tony sucked on his thumb and watched the small screen light up with results. "51% Toxicity"
“And the Winter Soldier?” Clint asked, sharps eyes trained on Bucky.
"I haven't spent time with Peter in a little bit, should be fun." Mary smiled at her boyfriend, leaning over to kiss him quickly.
"Not yet, but they're getting close," Coulson said. "They've pegged the bike at least, and I think you're underestimating the intensity of an online obsession."
"No, no," Tony shook his head. "I found the information, then Natasha and Clint came up with the plan."
“You know Miss Sarah, too?” Wade asked when they reached the car, Bucky opening the backdoor for them. He looked at the older boy, then nodded once. “Do you like her?”
“Yay!” Jamie lifted her arms in success and Tony winked at her as he stood up with her in his arms. She giggled and grinned.
“They finished about an hour ago,” Bruce told him. “I was going to have Jarvis let you know when you got back.”
“I think that you should have gotten this thing to go,” Tony murmured, twirling the knotted stem between his fingers.
Tony tilted his head a little. "You don't wanna spend the weekend at my place?"
"Shouldn't you be greeting the arriving guests?" Rachel asked with a raised eyebrow.
"Hey!" Tony shouted, aiming his hand up as the man turned around. "I'm over here." The whining charge of the repulsor was the only warning the man had before Tony shot. And apparently the only one he needed. The man used the whip to deflect the shot, but Tony fired again. To the same result. A whip wrapped around Tony's wrist, then his neck, and threw him to the ground.
Also, I try to plan out the chapters before I write them, give a vague outline of what scenes I want to happen, and I was going to get to the beginning of Iron Man 2 in this chapter, but Captain Rogers had different plans for me when he bust on the scene. I hope everyone likes this chapter, this is the start of that slow build tag. I do hope that some of the cliche things, that all you lovelies see coming, are handled in a way that at least you enjoy.
"Don't waste it. Don't waste your life." Yinsen looked into Tony's eyes. "Get back to your son." Tony stayed with him, until he took his last breath. Tony turned his head to the exit to the cave, face set, determination, and revenge, coursing through his veins. He was going to end this.
“A menace!” Tony accused.
Steve took a breath, watching him leave. "Romanoff, call Coulson."
"I don't have anything for that." Mary smirked a little, looking over at them. "I think maybe, you have to give it a hug."
“We’re just that good,” Steve said with a chuckle. “Also, most visits are done while you and Peter are in class, or otherwise occupied. I’ve brought Jamie with us before.”
Unbeta'd, and Marvel owns more of this than me.
"What the hell is going on in here?" Steve asked, but no one moved.
"I'm not sleepy, Mama," Peter claimed, wiggling around in her arms until she was forced to put him down, still holding onto his hand.
“We get to stay in the Pirates room??” Peter said in an awed hush. “That is so awesome!” As the door swung open Peter was the first one inside. Tony smiled at Steve and let him walk in next.
"They played you as a puppet," Steve said gently. "Pulled all your strings. And she's right, you can't take all that blame. They tortured you, Buck. For Seventy years, they tortured you, and tried to make you forget, and for fuck's sake, they froze you." Bucky looked at him, watching Steve lose his calm exterior but keeping his voice down. "But, they underestimated you. They did big time. You didn't forget, not really, you never really lost who you were. If you had, you wouldn't be standing here in front of me, wouldn't be in this Tower. They had to keep trying to make you forget, because you just wouldn't submit, not all the way."
Bruce was humming, getting up from his seat and going over to the sink. "If you'll excuse me, I'm going to check on the two little troublemakers, then go out to the gardens." He left with a small smile on his face, empty tea cup washed out, humming softly. Steve blinked a little. He wanted to talk to Tony.
“I am not, and it could be dangerous,” Steve tried to argue. “They’re still young, and Peter’s small-“
“It’s like your old workshop!” Peter smiled then reached out to take the box. “I like it.” Tony chuckled and kissed his cheek, standing back up. “Alright kiddo, we’ve got some dinner reservations to get too, then the next Star Wars movie.” Peter straightened up and turned to hustle towards the checkout, making Tony laugh.
"Have you been good for Mr Stark, baby?" Julie asked Wade, messing with a little cowlick on the top of his head.
“Eighty-third is Steve’s old floor, right?” Tony asked, moving the live footage to the corner and taking a moment of when the projectile hit the glass, zooming in. Jarvis answered in the affirmative. They had been staying on Steve’s floor until a few weeks ago, the last of the furniture arriving, and most of the painting done. Steve was still working on some murals for the kids rooms, but those he didn’t need empty space for.
"Tony! Wait-"
"Almost Petey," Tony told him, keeping the tears out of his voice. Peter was perceptive. "Mr Steve is probably gonna be closer to come get you out, okay? So when he's there, you listen to what he says. I'm stopping the bad guys, so no one will hurt you, or Mama, again. Okay?"
"Hi Mama! Hi Granma!" Peter greeted happily, running over. Rachel turned to hug Peter, smiling, moving out of the way a little and Mary got up. "Whoa. You look really pretty, Mama."
"One for Mr Steve and me?" Tony nodded, running his hands through his hair.
“Oh, Buck-lerone.” Meg snorted at Tony’s newest nickname. The name earned two confused looks.
“I have too many ideas,” Steve corrected. “All those visits to museums and libraries with the boys gives me time to see all the opportunities for date ideas.” Tony’s hands were rubbing gently against his arms, as if trying to warm him up. Steve didn’t stop him, afraid that it might make him think about how cold he had been in the nightmare. “I have to make it special though, so I have to parse the ideas down.”
”The sole
Steve nods tensely. Well, he
”Not good enough”, Tony says, pulling his finger halfway out. ”Will you, or won’t you?”
”I’ll carry you.”
”Then shave it tomorrow. Or don’t. I literally just said that I don’t care. Can’t we just go back to bed for now?”
”Take him, too”, he says, opening his eyes and offering the baby from his arms. He doesn’t really want to give the baby away, but he’s afraid of falling asleep and failing to support him.
Pepper comes and gives him a hug, then looks at him in that supportive way of hers that would be annoying coming from anyone else.
He stares at Tony, his face unreadable, until Tony becomes too ashamed to answer his gaze anymore and drops his eyes to his hands that have unconsciously started to rip the bottle’s etiquette.
Giving in, Nat texts Rhodey and soon Steve’s holding Emmett in his arms. It soothes him, but only a little.
”A barren omega you can’t even knot?” Steve’s tone isn’t accusatory, but Tony still feels a sting in his chest. Once again, he wishes he could’ve been there for Steve.
Steve doesn’t know where Tony is. Strange hasn’t returned either, and Steve has no idea what has happened after they left Earth, no idea if Tony’s still alive or not. The bond hasn’t helped Steve even though he has tried until his head’s begun to ache. If Tony’s still out there somewhere, he’s too far for the emphatic connection to work. It’s a fifty-fifty chance, really, and there’s nothing that Steve can do besides hoping that someone will find Tony alive and bring him home.
could’ve guessed he’s the bossy house-omega?” Tony points out to Peter. The teenager knows better than to react with anything but an awkward smile.
”Yeah, eventually. Emmy was stubborn as always, of course”, Steve chats back, thankful for the mild conversation start. He leans his hip against Tony’s desk.
He doesn’t have too much experience of toys, but it’s hardly rocket science, and it doesn’t take long for him to find himself fucking the toy into his hole in abandon.
”Are you set on making this hard for us in more than one way?” he asks once he’s found his good side again.
”Don’t wake him up, Tony”, Steve’s voice tells him quietly from the bed. His back is turned so that Tony can’t see anything but the blonde of his hair, his figure unmoving.
”I- I don’t- I don’t want to break- break the bond”, Steve begins to pour out between his sobs. ”I never- I never should’ve said that-”
Steve doesn’t know what’s going on, but it’s obviously serious. Captain America comes back to him in a blink of an eye, but not quite as quickly as Iron Man comes to Tony.
”All good?” he asks, just because he is Tony, not really any real concern in his voice.
He could’ve gone with them. But no, he has to sit on his arse while others go find the bastard that has killed his child. Just because Steve says so, because Rhodey says so, because Bruce says so, because Natasha says so, because even Thor and Nebula say so. The raccoon doesn’t even know Tony but even he says so. What is he, a child?
Tony’s fingers pressed hard into Steve’s skin as he began to finally thrust without restraint, his mouth watering at the wet, slapping sounds it produced.
Steve gets to feed the babies before they’re taken away for washing. Tony is welcomed to assist the midwife in the task, and Steve watches him from the bed, a tired smile on his face. Tony’s found his voice again, and he’s showering the little ones with words of endearment, his hands impossibly gentle as he cleans them.
”, Steve says softly.
”I’m sorry if that’s an odd thing to ask”, Nat continues when Steve’s caught swallowing down his tears. ”I manage okay as long as I keep doing something, but when I lie alone –”
After he was tired from painkillers and could hardly speak comprehensibly. Always, always finding the love and strength to say these things.
He should go to bed. He wants to go to bed; to hold Steve and breathe in his comforting scent in silence. So that’s what Tony decides to do, presuming Steve doesn’t kick him out of the bedroom for his recent achievements.
”Steve”, Tony repeated, frustrated.
Surely he can’t accuse someone of rape if he’s the one forcing himself on them.
Nat pads around the bed and Steve closes his eyes again. He hears Nat take her shoes and some clothing off, then feels the bed dip slightly under her weight. It’s not completely unfamiliar, since they’ve shared a bed a couple of times before on missions. On those occasions she hasn’t pressed her back against Steve’s for comfort.
Getting right back up, he pads silently past the twins and to the hallway, finding the package where the babysitter left it in the morning. It’s quite big, but thin, and not very heavy. Carefully, Steve rips the brown packing material open and pulls out a picture. There are colourful faces on a white background, and on the top left corner there’s a text: “Love”. The bottom left corner has the text “forever changes”. It takes a couple of seconds for Steve to realise that it’s a vinyl record – he didn’t remember right away that the album, which he very well recognises now, had a cover like this.
Time seems to slow down, like the universe itself is trying to draw out the inevitable. But it can’t stop Thanos, just like none of them could, and Thanos snaps his fingers.
”No – wait, is that Bruce?”
”Tony”, he says, his tone needy for more. It’s always hard to resist Steve’s begging, but right now Tony finds it especially difficult. He decides to see if he can use it.
Steve gave him a little laugh, then moved to kiss him. His erection, still restrained by his boxers, poked Tony’s own as he pressed his body close, and Tony pushed against it, grunting. Steve took the cue and shuffled out of his only piece of clothing, kissing Tony again as he lubed himself up. He rolled Tony to his side effortlessly, coaxing his leg out of the way and pushed the head of his cock inside.
”But I do. And it’s not just me, it’s everyone around you, and even those far away. You care
nearly fifty. Second of all,
Hearing this, Steve’s pretty sure he can feel his cock escape the tiny underwear he’s wearing, finally growing too large for it. But he uses all of his might to ignore it, tries to relax like Tony has told him to.
He wonders about the curse. What has actually been done to him? He thinks about asking Thor but decides against it for now. What he needs is that shower and something to eat, and to see Emmett. The rest he can worry about later.
”Hugs”, he prompts, and both of the kids come wrap their arms around him.
He’d made sure Tony’s helmet was closed and hit his chest with electricity to practically force his heart to keep going. Everything had gone white for a blink, and then Tony had fallen into his arms.
The shout takes all that’s left in him, and he can only hope that it’s enough.
”Hello”, Tony says huskily, grinding his cock against Steve’s lightly.
”Yeah, sure.”
Steve felt himself blush at the compliment a little, and he was about to return it when Tony pushed two fingers inside of him.
Steve looks at them helplessly. It’s relieving to see Kieran in Tony’s arms, but it’s also a reminder of how big of a failure he himself is. His lower lip quivers as he thinks of how disappointed Tony must be in him.
”Steve.”
It’s exactly what Steve’s planning to do anyway, but Tony’s plea still sends a wave of pleasure down his spine.
When Steve begins to open Tony’s fly, he’s silent and careful like he’s doing something sacred. Tony itches to still his omega’s unsteady hands and take over, but he lets Steve finish the job, stroking his hair as he watches him do it.
Tony grips his hair roughly and Steve lets out a noise before Tony’s tongue slips into his mouth, his finger rocking harder inside.
He lets go of Tony’s wrists to coax his shirt properly off. He wrings it, turning it into a makeshift tie and tightens it around Tony’s wrists so firmly that Tony gasps a little. His eyes are wide, his mouth hanging open as he tries to bring his lips back to Steve’s who pulls away, sitting up as much as possible without hitting his head to the roof. The car’s definitely quite a cramped space for a spontaneous fuck, but something about it makes Steve wild. It’s an intoxicating break from their day to day life, a little rebellion against it. Instead of being on their way home like they should, they’re about to fuck at a parking lot and Steve feels no sting in his conscience. Tony certainly doesn’t seem to mind.
She succeeds to calm him down enough that he somehow gets through ‘til it’s Friday again. Tony’s been away for a whole week when Steve gets out of the car in front of the therapist’s building, waving his hand at Happy, and goes in. He treks the stairs to the fourth floor and opens the door to find Tony sitting in the waiting room.
”I won’t”, Tony promises, going ahead and beginning to massage Steve’s perineum, teasing. He feels some slick sticking to his fingertips, but there isn’t much. ”Okay?”
We (they) did it guys, yay!
Tony can hear Steve’s self-confidence cracking in his voice. He lets go of Steve’s cock and pushes Steve off of him gently, making him lie down next to him.
When Nat’s gone, he decides to take a shower. His head feels temporarily a little clearer after concentrating on the contract, and it seems wise to wash up now since it might take until the end of the heat before he manages to do that again. Normally when he’s in heat, Tony takes him to a bath and spoils him, washes his hair and massages him.
”So. Thanks for that”, Steve says between his sobs, shaking in Tony’s arms.
Though it wears him out, Steve lets Tony have his distractive bullshit, because Tony’s right; Steve does know that Tony does this when he’s not comfortable with his emotions.
will be perfect for our children. That’s a promise, Steve”, Tony says one night after they’ve made love.
”Bruce”, Steve mutters quietly, making the man aware of him. He rushes to the bedside.
”I thought about how I’d never hear you tell me you love me again.”
”Good”, he whispers, staring straight into Steve’s eyes. Steve’s eyelashes flutter and Tony thinks it looks magnificent.
He feels the bed shift as Tony lies down with a sigh. Steve expects him to turn off the light and simply go to sleep, but the light stays on. He’s relieved – he’s not looking forward to another night of staying up alone in the darkness with his thoughts.
”I –” Tony starts, breathless. ”I want to be inside of you every day for the rest of my life.”
Tony is still a little out of it, but he seems to sense the possessiveness Steve feels, because he takes Steve’s hand affirmatively, caressing the pulse point in his wrist tenderly. He inhales sharply as Steve keeps desperately clenching around his sensitive cock.
Steve turns to look at him, and Bucky pulls him into a hug.
Tony answers with a pleased hum. After a few more idle minutes, he lifts himself up, pulling carefully out of Steve.
”Ohhh fuck, oh god”, he slurred, falling back to the nonsense. Tony swore his groin area had detached and went to heaven, except his whole body was all lit up nerves, the pleasure almost overwhelming.
Steve raised his eyebrows, but he wasn’t entirely surprised to hear Tony say that. Whenever there was a problem, Tony’s insecurities were almost always a good place to look for the root of it. Steve also knew better than to start fussing about them. He kissed the line of Tony’s jaw, under his ear.
Tony is still awake, and he smiles at Steve languorously as Steve approaches the bed. Steve lies down next to him and surprises him by kissing him eagerly. Tony hums, wrapping his hand around Steve’s neck, pulling him down with him.
”For example, there’s a thing like ’fashionably late’, which you and Mr. Hood here are unfamiliar with.”
They kiss, both humming into it.
His cock was still in Steve’s mouth, and the combination was mind-blowing. Tony couldn’t stop himself from pushing against the pressure, his mouth opened wide as he tried to remember how to breathe. Steve sucked him dedicatedly, tapping his finger against his prostate, sometimes rolling the tip of his finger around, and Tony was melting. It was
”Am I supposed to be insulted, flattered or embarrassed?” he had asked, chuckling a little as he bit into his food.
”Just a little while longer.”
”Steve”, he called softly, although it took all of his effort to not just go entirely feral himself. Had Steve been easier for him to manhandle, he would’ve already simply flipped them over and begun to nail him into the mattress. ”Sweetheart.”
Other people visit Tony, of course, and Steve welcomes that. It’s good for Tony to hear familiar voices, and Steve himself tries to talk to him as much as he can. Not just because he wants to help Tony recover, but also because he hopes that it reaches Tony on some level even if it won’t wake him up. He wants Tony to know that they are safe now.
No giving orders, no constant alertness, no shouting, no chaos. Just peace.
”What’s wrong?” he asks, alarmed, checking the twins and then turning back to Steve.
They fight back and forth for a bit more, until Steve catches a glimpse of himself in the mirror and freezes. He looks awful. There are bags under his eyes, and indeed, his pale and thinned face is framed by a hideous, unkempt beard.
”You don’t have to take part in it”, Tony offers, realising what a stupid thing it is to say the moment it leaves his lips.
"You don't want him to, do you?" Mary asked, and Tony shook his head. "Why, Tony?"
Tony lightly tapped the edge of the small envelope against the counter of the bar. It was starting to get dark outside, and he could see the fat, soft, snowflakes outside the windows. Downstairs, Peter was probably ecstatic about the snowfall. He and Mary had agreed that Peter would open presents with him on Christmas Day. Since her parents now lived with them, they'd be having Christmas Eve on their floor.
“Are you trying to set me up for failure?” Steve tried to pout at him, but then Jamie’s little hands were pulling on his bottom lip. Tony had to cover his mouth before laughing loudly.
"Partial lockdown, Captain Rogers," the AI responded. "Security teams are still sweeping through a five block radius, while three guards at placed at each entrance and exit to the building. The building is restricted to employees only, with ID Badges only, and all appointments have been canceled."
"I meant what decade," she said with a chuckle. "But it's nice to know how long you have under your belt. Have you never listened to music before that?"
"Did little hands take Mom's phone?" Tony asked, a fond little smile on his face as he went back to his project. He never got the hang of doing the baby talk thing, but Peter never seemed to mind, and Mary didn't care, as long as Tony never showed up with alcohol on his person, or inside of him. She said no swearing once he was old enough to start repeating words. Tony had made no promises. "You know, I'm okay with this, because I think Mom was trying to yell at me about getting you a new place. And let me tell you, Petey, this new place is nice, and you'll have your own room." He always referred to Mary as Mom, but never to himself as Dad. He was just the guy who showed up a couple times a month, that's all, he wasn't a Dad.
"Come on! I think you and him would get along fantastically," Steve told her. They had the personalities where they would instantly clash, but it would make things interesting, so they would probably be instant friends.
“Obviously, Meg started the series over for you to watch, because that’s an old episode that I know she would have seen,” Tony tried to piece out.
Tony watched the egg, waiting until the shell finally broke away. There was a little Flareon, just like the others, but she was smaller than the others. Vee was there, licking her head a couple of times before Tony reached forward, gently picking her up. “Hello, Ruby.”
He rubbed his face, still feeling utterly exhausted. Steve had been right, eventually his body would become too tired, and he would sleep without any dreams. He hoped. Putting his arm over his face, he rested his eyes for just a second. He had gone over the wording for the press releases, signed the papers for the restraining order on George, and worked on a way to contain Loki so that Thor could move him over to the Manor today, and away from SHIELD.
Tony started shaking his head. "Not here, we can talk about the mean and nasty stuff they did later. Not here." Natasha helped him back up into his seat before heading back to the cockpit. Steve had shifted and wrapped an arm around Tony's shoulders, pulling him in and kissing his head. Steve's arm was doing its best to tuck him against Steve's body, and Tony found his face closer to the still awake baby in Steve's other arm. They locked eyes and suddenly she was moving her hand forward and patting Tony's nose twice. "She's going to be just like you, Rogers."
"All the pairs are here in front of us," Mary said and waved her hand over the tray table.
"Yeah, well, the sacrifices we all have to make sometimes," Tony muttered. "If I wasn't so sure that they wanted to make an army of my suits, I would have done this sooner.. I just want to see my son, again." Rhodey wrapped his arm around Tony's shoulders now. "Phone calls just aren't cutting it, anymore. And I keep running into The Neighbor whenever I go stalk the playground."
"Not yet," she shook her head. "The buildings they operate out of are owned by dummy corporations, but Coulson is tracking down all known names now." Steve nodded and glanced out the front of the jet.
"Is Tony going to get sick?"
“Speaking of anniversaries,” Steve mumbled happily.
“Mary is a respectable woman,” Pepper argued.
"I could say the same," Tony countered.
"Remember the giant arc reactor that Howard had built in the California HQ?" Tony had known Bruce since he was just a teen, first meeting him when he was an intern at Stark Industries.
birthday, and the pillow that looked like the classic shield that Ana had hand-sewn. This was the real stuff, the stuff that didn’t go down with the Captain on his last mission.
“I miss playing with the grown-ups,” Tony said, walking over to Steve, Mary next to him. “Well, grown-ups that aren’t in costume.”
Mary watched him, then pulled out her phone again. She really didn't want to send this text, but it wasn't really a choice now; this was her job. 'Gonna be late, something came up at work.'
When Steve pulled into a parking spot and shut off his motorcycle, he was aware of muffled music coming from nearby. When he looked next to him he saw someone sitting in their car, an older model, bright red, convertible car with a black-top, with their music playing loudly. Steve blinked, not quite sure what he was witnessing. There was a young woman with what looked like pink hair, sitting in the car, singing almost as loudly with the music, her upper body seeming to be moving with the music. He couldn't help but stare as she was, what he could only think to call it, dancing. It was like nothing he had ever seen before, and he had seen Peter dancing to some of his favorite cartoons before.
"Daddy!!" Tony turned and Peter slammed into him, arms wrapping around, sending him back down to the ground, landing on his back. He puffed out some air, but wrapped his arms around Peter tightly.
"You could always send a text message," Bruce said from his seat, and Tony groaned, flopping down onto the couch.
"His name is Wade," Steve muttered, leaning back against the couch. He was more tired than he thought if three people had been able to startle him like that. "Peter is down with Tony in the workshop, Wade. Why don't you go find them."
This worked differently though, as Jarvis informed him that system power was now at Four Hundred percent capacity. Tony smirked a little. "How 'bout that." Tony powered everything up, shooting both hand repulsors at the man, and a unibeam shot. It threw him back and Tony didn't waste any time in following him, slamming him through the tree completely.
"Dr Banner is making some tea in the kitchen, Captain." Steve nodded and headed for the kitchen.
“Eeeeeeveeeee!! Veeee!” Steve didn’t stop the sob that escaped him as Evelyn ran over to him, jumping into his arms. He held onto her, letting her check him over. “Eevee, Eevee, vee, Eevee.” She licked all over his face, pressing her paws to wherever she could reach.
Tony bit his bottom lip for a second, and looked at Jamie as he fingers curled over a couple of his. “You know what,…. I kind of do too.”
“What if they come back? They’re not going to stop searching for this place, just because they can’t get access to my head anymore.” He looked over at her. His brain was in full activity mode. The only other person he talked to like this, about this subject, was Jarvis. It almost felt good to get it off his chest, and he knew that even if Danielle wouldn’t understand the science behind it all, she wouldn't judge him. “I know what’s out there, I’ve seen it. Took a bomb straight up into space to meet them, and then played an unwilling host to them for more than a year after that. There has to be a way to be ready for them. I know that we’re not going to be able to hold them back.”
Steve looked back at all the cases, the lights reflecting off the glass. "I would appreciate it if you could keep this all safe for me, Tony." Steve looked back at the genius with a smile. "You and Peter seem to know exactly what to do with it. I think I'll hold onto this, though." He gripped Bucky's tags.
"What was I thinking?" Tony raised an eyebrow, detecting humorous amounts of sass from his AI. "You're usually so discreet."
"Okay, say it again," Yinsen prompted Tony as he suited up. They checked the gloves, the jacket, before bolting on the chest and arm pieces.
"That would be preferable. If you do that, then I'll actually get close to your again," the blonde said, pulling a pout from Tony. "That's a no go, Tony. That's gross, no matter what way you spin it, and I'm staying here, playing the dutiful Uncle."
"You haven't forgotten Friday night, have you?" She asked. Jarvis brought up a small calendar in front of Tony, but he swiped it away before Bruce could look at it.
Peter looked down at her hands, then up to her face. He leaned in a little closer to her face. "He was my Daddy first," Peter told the little girl. Tony was about to open his mouth, but Steve held his hand a little, watching Peter intently. "You're lucky, cause he's one of the best around, but just remember, he's mine first." One of Jamie's hand rested on Peter's nose and he was wrinkling his face and pulling away.
“So everything had to be planned carefully,” Steve finished.
Tony flushed the toilet and pushed himself up, carefully, and waiting for his feet to be able to hold him up with having to think about it. Jarvis opened every door that he could along the way, So Tony could keep pulling himself along the wall, pausing when he felt that he might be getting too dizzy, or that his stomach might try to rebel again.
"I'm not a lab experiment," Meg said, but she was smiling. Tony was starting to like her if she thought that it would be fun.
"Tony, the board has rights, too," Obie tried to argue. "They's making the case, that you and your new direction, isn't in the company's best interest."
“But the pancakes are divine, Mary,” Steve said, turning big blue eyes in her direction. “I look forward to these at every birthday.”
"I'm going to go down, highly anticipating the arrival of our darling son!" Tony called to her, heading for the elevator. "You are allowed to join me, if you stop talking about my relationship."
“You probably still will!” Tony called as Steve went into the bathroom to get changed, causing Tony to pout. “These clothes were made here, official Disney sewing team, the same clothes that are worn.”
"Still doesn't-" Jamie started to softly giggle and Steve was able to pull the spoon back. "Oh, I see. How old do you think she is?"
“One step ahead,” Mary moved quickly.
“Tony-“ He shushed her and took a step closer to the living room. There were two heads sitting on the couch. He recognized them both.
He sniffs his tears away, meeting Steve’s concerned eyes.
”Then slick” – slap! – ”for” – slap! – ”me” – slap! Tony’s voice is growly, an alpha’s voice, and it shakes Steve’s core, his body submitting to it. He feels liquid run down his thigh and almost bursts into tears out of relief.
”That’s understandable. So, what made you change your mind?”
”What the –”
”My heat should start in a couple of weeks, and I was wondering how you want to handle it, if I should get away for it, or…”
Tony finds the blanket he’d used when he’d slept in the car from the backseat and settles it over them. They lie silently, surprisingly comfortable on their narrow car seat bed. When the knot starts to come down, Tony props himself up enough to check the time from the front panel.
Disappointment hits Steve as he begins to wait for his punishment. Maybe he could do this if he wasn’t a super sensitive freak. Although, then he’d be the little, ugly runt he used to –
It’s silent for a moment, Bucky leaving it up to Steve to decide whether he wants to continue or not.
Loving Tony was one of those things.
As Tony’s mouth found Steve’s neck he could feel him shiver, and the way he exposed his neck pliantly was breathtaking. Breathtaking, and all for Tony. His cock was slipping in and out of Steve smoothly, Steve’s slick wetting his balls and even thighs as he kept fucking him sweetly, slow enough to relish it all.
The therapist also tells him that beating himself up about it isn’t productive. Steve understands that, sure, one didn’t have to have a psychology degree to get that, but it’s easier said than done.
Tony follows him instantly, probably guessing the reaction his words have triggered. Steve registers him coming after him, but begins to just pull the drawers open frantically, looking for his razor. How doesn’t he even know where it is?
”More?” Tony stops to ask, and Steve couldn’t explain what is it that makes him nod in affirmation. But no one's asking him to explain.
”Take good care of oma”, Steve hears Kieran whisper into Tony’s ear as they hug, and Tony chokes out a little laugh, sharing a look with Steve over Kieran’s shoulder. The boys know about Steve’s enhanced senses, but they still don’t often quite grasp what it means when it comes to their own volume of speech. Which is rather convenient, of course.
”I’m sorry”, Steve says quickly, hardly audible, his body still shaking. ”I’ll- I’ll calm down.”
”No”, Tony says again, and his legs seem to start giving out. Steve supports his weight.
Rather hastily, Steve then pulled out, let Tony’s leg go and took his own aching cock into hand. With only a couple of tugs he pushed himself over the edge, spilling onto the alpha’s stomach and pressing his face to his neck as he groaned brokenly.
With a small, comforted smile, Steve leaned down to kiss Tony. The alpha tasted like toothpaste and home, and Steve began moving his hips as his tongue brushed against Tony’s.
”I know”, Tony stopped him, gently pulling Steve’s arms back to the mattress and trapping his wrists against it. He pushed himself up to see Steve’s face.
“Good”, Tony approves, his breath warm against Steve’s ear. “Look at those baby blue eyes. Do they look innocent to you?”
”, he says so ardently that Tony almost laughs at its adorableness. Now Steve smiles a little at himself, but his eyes stay candid. His cheeks have a rosy colour on them, his lips a little bit apart as Tony keeps pushing noises out him. ”Tony”, he pleads when Tony gives him another lopsided smile, like he’s afraid that Tony doesn’t understand the depth of his sentiment.
”I can try something”, he says, then. Steve can hardly blink as a response. Something
”Just thinking about Peter”, he’d admitted.
Months go by. When they’d finally begun to get enough from making up for the lost time, Steve’s heat had started and made them bound to the bed for days again. To say that those days had been intense would be an understatement. Something that had started as a lust ridden utterance from Tony before the heat, had turned into a serious conversation and finally manifested into reality during Steve’s heat. That something had definitely added a whole new level to the experience, as if all that they’d been through wouldn’t have been enough to make them hungry and desperate for each other to the point of Tony not eating for two days and Steve not washing for four.
Bucky can’t claim that he really understands. After all, he’s an alpha himself, and currently a one very distant with his sexuality at that. The Soldier wasn’t a sexual being, and Bucky’s still got a long way to go to find all aspects of himself again. What he can remember now from when he last was himself, though, is the unimpressed, almost disgusted looks Steve used to give to the alphas that tried to get his attention.
”Uh-oh”, Tony says, tossing the corset away.
”Easy to be nice to someone so likable”, he answers. ”It’s nice of
. It’s not like Tony’s out of the loop in any way, but Steve is simply unmatched when it comes to things like these. And although his enhanced memory surely helps, it’s not just that; Steve’s constantly tuned in to make sure he doesn’t miss a thing.
”I stopped counting the Iron Man costumes somewhere around forty.”
Steve did remember that Peter Parker was coming to their house today, he did. He remembered it in the morning when he got up early with the twins, allowing Tony to get some peace and quiet for a couple more hours of sleep. He remembered it later when Tony came to remind him of it as he was sitting on the sofa reading news, sipping coffee and watching the twins.
He took the lube and lifted himself up to sit, coaxing Tony more onto his stomach. It’d be easier to make Tony ready like this.
So he talks, in a quiet voice and with his face hidden, but still. He talks about his insecurities, about the pangs of jealousy. Tony listens to all of it patiently, even though most of it is not news to him, his thumb rubbing Steve’s stiff shoulder.
Steve stroked Tony’s prostate with his fingers for a few times more before pulling them out, and saw how Tony bit his lip to suppress a whimper.
He can feel his own orgasm drawing near, and he reaches down to touch Steve’s cock.
is some sort of a god himself, because how else would he have the right to something this heavenly? Tony runs his hands down Steve’s waist, his mouth parting as he watches Steve’s back muscles move, feels how he pushes his ass back in sync with Tony’s slow thrusts.
”Steve.” Tony’s eyes are so pleading and Steve wants to just lose himself into them. He doesn’t let go of Tony’s eyes as he dips his fingers between his own wet thighs. ”Please, honey, I need – ah –”
Steve would give anything to have Tony tossing and turning beside him now. He knows he shouldn’t torture himself like this, shouldn’t allow every little thing to remind him of Tony all the time, but he can’t help it. His body aches to hold Tony in its embrace, his heart longs to hear his voice and see his clever smirk.
”Usually an omega’s mind protects them from going into heat too soon after they’ve lost their alpha”, the doctor explains to him. ”But this happens sometimes. In some rare cases, heat can be a way for an omega’s body to react to the grief. It’s been interpreted as a way for the traumatized mind to try to get the lost mate back with the strong scent of heat. It’s sometimes called a mourning heat.”
Steve looks up to meet his eyes, nodding. He’s not entirely sorry himself, and Tony can probably pick that up from his expression.
Tony had promised to never leave him.
”You…” he starts, unsure of what he’s even trying to say.
”They got Strange. Listen, honey, I need to ask you a favour. Find Vision and destroy the mind stone.”
”It’s okay”, Tony says, apparently sensing his distress. Steve lifts his face to get a confirmation for the soft tone from his face, but snorts when he sees Tony’s chin smeared with white. Tony grins wearily as Steve licks it off. Careful not to pull the knot, Steve shifts his weight off of Tony and beside him, allowing Tony to wrap his arm back around him.
Tony didn’t as much as stir when Steve then settled back onto the bed and pulled him gently but firmly into his embrace. He made sure that Tony was comfortably covered under the blanket from his toes to his shoulders before pressing his nose into Tony’s nape.
”Always have been.”
”That’s it”, Tony says, his hands slowly moving lower, pressing those sweet spots that send signals all the way down to Steve’s toes. ”Just relax, baby. When I’m finished you’ll be nothing but a rag doll. Then” – his thumb brushes under the line of the skirt like on accident – ”and only then, I will slip my cock under that skirt and fuck you like the sweet slut you are.”
”Honeyy”, Tony whispers at the sight of him, louder than he thinks.
Steve’s eyes fall back to the baby in his arms. They both have Tony’s dark hair.
He takes Emmett and rushes downstairs, and when he comes by Nat on her way to see what’s happening, he pushes Emmett into her arms and runs.
Looking at him, Tony felt like Steve was flawless. All muscle yet somehow so soft. His cheeks when he smiled – or moaned in bliss, his jawline under Tony’s lips when he brought his hot breath to it, his hair between Tony’s fingers when he stroked or pulled it; they were soft and Tony would never get enough of it. He wanted to live in that softness, to bury himself into it, to feel nothing but that with all of him. Tony was certain that no other omega could ever feel this soft under his own, sometimes tiring weight. For Tony, Steve was like a safe-haven where to fall with his needs and troubles and then rise back up from as someone strong again. And although they supported each other in every way possible, often it didn’t take anything more than this. Often, it was just this that Tony needed; to be inside of Steve and get in touch with his basic instincts.
His words are cut by a loud, crashing sound of the TV hitting the floor. Tony didn’t throw it, just flipped it over like he’d heard enough. Steve stares at Tony, disbelief on his face.
Steve doesn’t have to say more than that. In one swift movement, Tony has pushed him onto his stomach again and taken a firm grip of his hips, pulling him to his knees. Steve takes a ragged breath, his body ready, so ready for anything Tony will give him. He can feel Tony’s breath on his skin, where the skirt hides the parts of Steve that yearn to be touched the most. Then the skirt is lifted up, and Steve trembles with anticipation, hardly able to contain himself. Tony touches him, and Steve almost pulls away just because he’s so on the edge. But Tony forces his hips to their place, ghosting the cleft of his ass with a finger.
by your mating scent?”
If it would’ve been possible to snort and groan simultaneously, Steve would have done that.
”It’s made clear that touching you, even if you ask for it, is not allowed, so they better not or they’ll be looking at a rape charge”, Nat says, her voice grave.
He enters the dim bedroom, a little unsure of how he should be moving. He’s not going to swing his ass around femininely, but he tries to avoid the most obvious ”the man in control” posture too.
Tony studies him, reaching to stroke his hair, and Steve closes his eyes, unable to bear the empathy on Tony’s face.
It feels wrong on so many levels. It feels wrong to indulge in something so carnal so soon after his loss. Feels wrong to be alone. Wrong for his body to act this way when Tony’s not here.
”Have I told you that I love your cock?”
”Tony”, Steve says tiredly. He’s not angry, he just doesn’t want to go to it. He shifts his face so that he can see Tony, his finger coming up to trail lines around the bruise on his collarbone. Tony’s still combing his hair with his fingers.
“Think you’re gonna come just from my cock?” Tony asks. He’s starting to sound rather breathless, too, his hips snapping more and more demandingly against Steve’s ass on every thrust and producing lewd, wet sounds in the process. Steve nods enthusiastically at his question, already knowing that there’s no doubt whether he’s going to come or not. He’s so close, each hit of Tony’s cock against his prostate already setting his nerves on fire, making his thoughts turn into complete mush.
Ashamed, Steve drops his eyes down to his own hands.
Steve showed a little grin at him.
”That makes me so wet”, he says, and if he’d say it any quieter, it couldn’t be classified as said aloud at all. But Tony hears him, his wrists twitching in their ties reflexively before he gets a hold of himself again. He could slip out of them easily if he wanted to; it’s a matter of self-discipline.
”Tony”, Steve grunts.
But he’s not back to normal. The doctor comes to see him again. He tries hard not to chide Steve when he hears what he’s allowed to be done to himself, but Steve can see that the man’s exasperated underneath. It’s understandable, he guesses. Steve and physicians rarely have seemed to agree on the best course of action when it has come to his health.
”Tell me, omega”, Tony begins. There are times when getting called ”omega” by one’s alpha is a good thing. This is not one of those times. ”Why is it that you talk about you losing my trust, yet it seems that it’s you who still doesn’t trust me?”
Steve nods with a small tremor, kissing Tony’s temple, and Tony spits onto his hand unceremoniously, wiping it onto their cocks for lubrication before resuming his strokes. He starts kissing Steve’s neck, teasing the skin with his teeth but not biting down, and he can feel Steve tensing, feel him yearn for the bite. But Tony keeps his kisses soft and his strokes feverish until Steve is trembling and whimpers needily.
There's no reassuring telepathy this evening. Tony still shows up for the dinner the next day, and so does Steve. They don’t talk about it.
“One”, Steve says after Tony’s palm lands on his flesh. He’s still gripping Steve’s corset, holding him in place, and Steve’s body sort of wants to struggle against it. Wants, but doesn’t. Tony’s palm hits him again.
”So”, Steve continued, his lips travelling down Tony’s throat. ”I’d very much like to call you daddy right now, but if you’ve decided that you’re not comfortable with it anymore –”
”See, that’s a good answer”, Tony had answered amicably. ”You pick”, he had added, his voice getting that note that Steve hadn’t been able to stop himself from interpreting as flirtatious lately. This was when Bruce had seen his cue to leave.
”You know already, don’t you?”
Tony forgives himself the slight wave of relief that washes over him. He pulls Steve’s hand into his, and Steve entangles their fingers, leaning his head against Tony’s shoulder.
”I’m right here.”
in his mind. He rode his orgasm shakily until his knot filled fully, not allowing him much movement anymore. After that he collapsed on top of Steve like a wet rag.
Steve is left to hold his weight on his own as Tony gets up to fetch the lube from the bed. Although Tony had only held his weight partly, it’s still uncomfortable after all that his body has endured tonight, and Steve could cry from happiness as he sees Tony snag a pillow with him too. He sets the pillow in front of Steve and Steve looks at him gratefully.
him smirk.
”I mean it. Let’s fuck”, Tony said, sounding a little more articulate now.
The caller on the line seemed to follow Tony well enough, and after a couple of clarifying questions he thanked Tony ”for his time, sir”, and Steve wanted to call Tony sir too more than anything else in the world at that moment.
”Go ahead, honey”, he says, slowing down a bit and making it easier for Steve to talk.
has to tell him, because Tony is out there somewhere and Steve needs to protect him –
Steve rolls his eyes as he turns to go but doesn’t manage to suppress his snigger as he hears Tony start talking to Kieran in a Batman-like voice.
Steve swallows, a horrible weight landing on his chest. It’s stupid and selfish, but he feels so vulnerable. The thought of Tony not managing to knot him sweeps the rest of his crumbling self-esteem to the gutter.
Then Tony begins to move, and since he’s tied, Steve can’t really do much besides trying to make his mouth the best place for a cock to slide into. Tony cups his jaw, going slow at first, his lips slightly parted as he watches his cock move in and out of Steve’s mouth. Then he catches Steve’s eyes and Steve’s heart skips a beat at how soft the expression on his face is. Steve would give anything to always have Tony look at him like that, and his own eyes light up in such obvious worship that Tony chuckles a little, almost like he’s embarrassed.
”Thor?”
He lets Steve cry for a while, before he nuzzles his face against his temple.
“Permission to talk, sir”, Steve manages on his second try, and Tony studies him for a few seconds before he answers.
”Where were you?”
”Hmm.” Steve reaches to free Tony’s wrists, the shirt falling somewhere between the seats. Tony instantly buries his hands into Steve’s hair, pulling him into a kiss. Steve kisses him back, but bites Tony’s tongue before parting from him. Tony lets out a little whine in surprise.
Steve can’t be bothered to delve deeper into the thought of sex, though, the losses of today too heavy in his mind. He peels his suit off, switching to casual clothes, and tries not to think about Kieran when he turns his attention to Emmett.
”Oops”, came Steve’s voice. “Clearly underestimated the power needed for that.”
Tony straddles his back, and the warmth of his thighs feels like safety against Steve’s skin, and when Tony leans down and tastes Steve’s neck it’s even better.
Tony was right. When Steve lifts his face he can see that his eyes are red, the tears hardly dried on his cheeks.
A low, rumbling sound of his own left Tony, making Steve go back to whining instantly.
are perfect”, Steve tells him, leaning his forehead to Tony’s shoulder, slowing down a little. Tony moans as Steve bites his collarbone, and he means to be gentle, but gets so caught in it that when he lifts his face there’s a mark the colour of a plum on Tony’s skin.
“Thank you, sir”, he says, feeling a tad out of it.
Obediently, he added more lube before sliding two fingers back in. Tony sighed blissfully, his ass clenching a little around Steve’s fingers.
about sex, and as Steve’s experience in the subject is still based on stories heard in the foxhole and Google, Tony makes it clear that there’s no need for them to rush into it. Eventually, the time comes for that, too, and afterwards Steve knows that he isn’t going to regret it for a second. Few things in life are perfect, but that first time with Tony is damn close to that.
Even without a perfect memory, Steve knows he’d remember it clearly. By that time, he’d grown nearly obsessed about the idea of having a child. He’d been so afraid that they’d failed to conceive.
Steve sighs, regretting his words. He tries to calm down.
”Yeah, I think you’ve mentioned it.”
Of course Tony would say something like that, Steve thinks. But it doesn’t change the fact that Steve’s broken, ruined, damaged goods. He’s already always been a compromise as an omega, and now he’s hardly an omega at all anymore. Tony’ll stay with him out of responsibility and for Emmett, but it will never be the same. If Steve doesn’t recover, it would be better for Tony to leave him. Most likely, since Tony wouldn’t do it, Steve would have to leave Tony himself to give his alpha a chance for something normal, with someone whole.
”Are we?”
”So, Tony – may I call you Tony?” she starts.
A little slowly, Steve did respond to the kiss, and Tony’s hips faltered as his tongue pressed against Steve’s, allowing him a pure contact with all of the little messages Steve’s body was sending to him with pheromones. Yours, they said, lighting up all of Tony’s nerves.
He’ll never see Tony again. He’ll never hold his hand and look into his beautiful eyes as they lose themselves into each other. He’ll never feel Tony’s beard scratching his skin as Tony kisses his neck and wraps his arm around him. He’ll never hear the softness in Tony’s voice as he whispers ”I love you” to his ear. He’ll never press his ear against Tony’s chest and listen to his heartbeat as he falls asleep.
There’s no forcing the thought away. He tries, but there’s a full alarm inside his head, and he can’t shake the image of Steve, afraid and alone, needing him, his omega, abandoned, how could Tony, how could he, he should go there, he should find him, he –
”Thanks”, he answers with a laugh. ”I don’t think I’ve ever been called that before.”
“You took them to see Aunt Peggy?” Tony asked, tilting his head a little.
"I know!" Tony put on a grin, giving a wave as Natasha pulled Clint from the room. Tony sat down on the arm of the couch. "The boys are dressed, your bride is nearly ready, and I've just sent the greeters out to get the guests herded."
In DC he had a lot of time to think about Tony, to think about what they had started out as, (barely even friends), and what they were now. Steve couldn't see himself without Tony, now, but they had to talk about a few things. Spending that time in DC, the new information about Hydra and SHIELD, about who they could trust. He rolled his neck a few times and slipped on his shirt before leaving the bathroom. Tony was still on the bed, lying on his side this time. He looked up and smiled at Steve, then waved him over.
"Hello," Tony greet with a smile. The joy in the pool room had become a little infectious. "Tony Stark's Water World at your service, how can I help you?"
“Peggy!” Steve called as a flush crawled over his cheeks. Amethyst nodded, purring to accent it.
"What was supposed to go into the Tower?" Steve asked as he started to hand some of Peter's clothes to Tony.
"Yeah," Tony said, moving forward. The oven timer dinged, and Steve moved towards the oven, putting the frosting down on the counter. He passed by Tony and their arms brushed accidentally, but both men paused for a second, looking at each with only a couple of inches between them. Steve swore he saw Tony's eyes widen through the lenses, his eyes looking familiar, but Tony moved first, moving away.
He pulled out his ear buds, taking a moment to frown and untangle them, again, and opened his playlist on his phone before starting his motorcycle. Steve had filled it with a lot of his guilty pleasure songs that only Mary knew about, (and she hadn't let him live down his choices yet), but this time when he pressed play he frowned when a song he didn't remember adding started to play. The screen lit up and he smiled gently, thinking that Peter must have added the song to his computer as some point.
”Uncle Bucky and Aunt Nat will pick you up after school”, he rehearses with them. ”You’ll behave, right? And that goes for when you see Peter and the others on Saturday, too.”
Steve takes her hand as the ship jumps, and Thor starts singing drunkenly in the back of the ship. Rhodey tells him to shut up, and surprisingly, Thor does. Steve didn’t particularly enjoy the singing either, but he still can’t help feeling sorry for Thor. It’s his way of dealing with this.
After he leaves Tony shouting his name after him, Steve goes to bed and buries himself under the covers. He doesn’t cry, the only thing he feels being anger.
Although things looked relatively positive now, it hadn’t been the case at all times during the past two months. When Tony’d regained consciousness, he had had to stay on the ventilator for a couple of days more as his lungs had fought to start working on their own. On two occasions he’d started to pull the tube in his sleep and woken himself up, and it had been one of the hardest things in Steve’s life to restrain Tony’s hands as he’d waited for a nurse to come give Tony a sedative. The way Tony had stared at him in panic, unable to comprehend his soothing words and explanations for why he was keeping him from freeing himself from the uncomfortable tube. Steve hadn’t slept for more than three hours in total during the days they’d been weaning Tony off the ventilator.
”Yes, you like daddy pounding into you while he takes work calls”, Tony distracted him with a straight face.
The sound that leaves Tony is something between a gasp and a groan. Steve begins to move his hips tenderly, his teeth marking Tony for himself – his alpha, so handsome and powerful, so gentle and loving and his only. Tony’s moans fill his ears, he can hear his blood running fast, feel his cock pulsing inside of him as he starts to move his hips a little faster –
”No”, Tony answered, swallowing and smiling with unfocused eyes. ”Just get your dick inside me, please.”
”You’re an amazing man, Tony Stark”, he whispers. ”Please try to get some rest.”
”Steve.” Tony opened his eyes. ”We’re okay.”
”We’ll equip them with a panic button”, Nat says. ”Me and Rhodey won’t be far, and Rhodey at least can overpower you in the suit.” She looks at Steve. ”But I don’t think you need to worry about that. You’ve got strong morales, Steve.”
And there’s no reasoning with that. Steve’s broken expression arrests Tony’s heart, and he knows he isn’t going to say no to him. Even if what he’s asking for might be unsafe, might hurt Steve in a way that Tony isn’t comfortable with. Steve would make him fetch the moon and stars if he’d ask him like that.
Steve frowns. ”You thought you wouldn’t knot.”
Steve’s breath ripples in the air between them as he nods and then swallows.
“Come here”, he orders.
Steve twitches, looking up from the fire his gaze has been lost into for minutes. It’s a beautiful night in Wakanda, and Bucky delights in the peace around them, the clear night sky that allows him to see all of the stars where they have been since him and Steve were children.
”Heats like these are aggressive and can be very traumatic. You’ll need to be looked after.”
”Promise.”
”Please”, Tony begs again. Loving the needy look on his face, Steve hums adoringly and leans down to plant kisses on Tony’s shoulder and collarbones. He admires the line of Tony’s jawbone, nudging his jaw up gently with the tip of his nose. It’s dim in the car, but Steve can see the slight grey mixed in his beard, his heart fluttering.
Steve supposes that he is meant to see it in the mirror, but he doesn’t. All he sees is his reddened, tear-stained face, and if it makes him feel anything it is shame. There’s no reason to feel that either, though, and deep inside he knows it.
”GET. OUT.” His voice has gone low enough to be a growl, to be threatening. An alpha talking to an omega in public like that would get arrested very quickly. Tony’s never used that tone with anyone, let alone his own omega – the days of alphas keeping their omegas in order like that were long gone. But he needs for Steve to get out of his sight before he’ll do something much worse than turn into a caveman.
Steve still has his shirt on, but Tony can’t spare any thought to that – Steve spreads his legs wide open and Tony doesn’t even hear the possessive sound that escapes him now.
”I missed you so much”, Steve whispers between silent sobs and groans, his nails scraping Tony’s back. It’s easy for Tony to feel his pain because he feels the same, his chest aching from longing even though Steve is right there now.
He’s pleasantly surprised when he hears Steve’s moan turn into a growl of his own. Omegas rarely let out such noises except when they feel extremely possessive, and Steve swallows the sound as soon as he realises he’s making it.
”I’m not letting you go alone –”
And then Tony’s coming, groaning loudly as Steve milks him through his orgasm. Bliss fills Steve’s mind as he feels the fluid filling him, warm and
”The alternative being growing roots to that bed, I’m quite okay with it”, he mutters. ”Hi, Pep.”
”A man just walked out of an glowing circle to our back yard. Do you know him?”
”Amazing”, Steve says earnestly, his voice a little slurry. ”I feel amazing. Seriously, thank you, Tony.”
”Sit in my lap”, he says, and Tony’s heart flutters at his playful tone. It sounds so carefree compared to what it was like just a couple of minutes ago, and Tony eagerly obeys, sitting on top of Steve’s hips and pressing a quick kiss onto his lips.
”Are you done?” Steve goes on. He knows that he’s making a scene when everyone else is trying their best, but the taste of venom is too sweet in his mouth. At least he’s being seen.
Bucky shoots Steve a small grin, then gives Tony an amicable look.
”It must be difficult for you to be left behind”, Pepper observes, reading his thoughts.
“I’m not innocent, sir.” Tony can’t possibly think that about him.
After all, what use was there for Steve to be worthy of the power if he couldn’t use it to save what mattered to him the most?
Tony stares at him, a range of emotions flicking over his features, and watching it makes Steve feel the whole extent of his own disappointment. He is so disappointed in himself, in all of them, even Tony, for letting all of those who died, all of those who mourn, down like this. For letting his son down like this. He rubs his face, feeling the shame and grief trying to force their way into his eyes.
”You’re so pretty, baby”, Tony told him, his voice beginning to grow breathy too. ”So good, clench that hole for daddy.”
There was a scream in his ears, forcing him to close his eyes tightly.
"We'll have to check her over," Tony continued, changing the subject, feeling a panic attack buzzing at the edge of his eyes. Steve didn't saying about it, but the concern written in his eyes was plain to see. "They only had me working on their Serum, and I've given all that Bruce. Right before you attacked the base, that was the first time I saw her, so I don't know if they've done anything else. Also, cloning is still a fairly vague scientific field, with not one accepted way of handling it, not that AIM or Hydra would follow those guidelines anyway."
"If you put on your bracelet, I can wake you before a nightmare sets in." Tony had created a bracelet tied to Jarvis, one that could sense when his body was entering different states of sleep, and tracked his vitals. In extreme situations, the bracelet could emit a small shock to the wrist, enough to break deep sleep. It allowed Tony to get some sleep, but try to avoid most of the nightmares he still had.
Turning his attention back to Rachel, Steve put his hands on the front of his belt. "Ma'am, I understand that you are upset about Mary, I am as well. I worked very close with her, and I helped watch Peter. But, I would ask that you not turn that anger towards Tony."
Up the elevator to the fifth floor, Tony nodded to the nurses at their station, and put his hands on top of Wade's head, steering him down the hall and around the corner. Julie's door was closed, and Tony knocked twice before pushing it open.
“One day, you might find yourself in a house,” Steve said, looking at him briefly, before looking back down at Jamie. “Not a mansion, or a Penthouse a thousand feet from the ground.”
"Tony, what are you talking about?" Bruce went over to where Tony was searching through all the stuff they had dug out of the crates. He found the first slot of the old Expo model from the 70's. "Slow down Tony, you used a lot of reactor power with that opening."
Steve was sitting close to the kid, hand on his shoulder, giving it a little squeeze. “I just,” Wade pressed his lips together a little. “I don’t feel bad.” He looked over at Steve. “I don’t feel bad at all for being responsible for his death. For killing him. Does that make me a bad person?”
"I didn't tell him anything," Tony grumbled, looking back down at his phone. "Like I said, I went on three dates with the guy, and it was a mistake. He wanted the prestige of saying that he slept with Tony Stark, and when I didn't give that to him, he got mad." Tony sighed, swiped the video away. As he did his phone rang, Pepper's picture popping up on screen.
"Sorry," the younger man said. They sat there silently for several minutes, Tony trying to push all his emotions back down where they belonged, and Steve standing vigilant by the car. There was another breeze through the garage, and Steve tapped Tony's knee. "I think their Arbiter is here."
"The world hasn't changed a bit," Steve bit out as Thor and Natasha walked through the door. Another SHIELD agent that was lying to him.
Steve nudged Tony's shoulder towards the exit, Jamie's head laying down on his own shoulder now. "I don't know what's going on anymore," Tony moaned a bit, rubbing his face when they were out in the hallway. "Jarvis?"
If this one would be as large as either of the others, then Tony couldn’t release the pokemon down in the lab. He set the pokeball down on the ground and quickly climbed back up the chair to arrange everything back in its place in the case, then close the door. He picked the pokeball back up, cradling it in his arms, and hurrying back upstairs. He was out the garden side door and over to the largest part of the yard.
"Ah, well," Tony shrugged a little, putting his hands in his pockets. "The jet was in California, and the pilot hasn't been flying Pepper very often, so I wanted to give him a job." He knew that the pilot, and co-pilot, both had families, and while they did make a salary, Tony liked to give them bonuses for last minute flights. Such as this one. "I hope you don't mind, but I moved your lodgings from the hotel that Mary told you about, to the Manor. Peter and Mary are coming over tonight, and Peter's going to spend the night, so I thought it would be a nice surprise for him."
Tony put all available power into the thrusters, already taking off another two minutes of his flight time. "Tony, you should head to DC, I can find people in Baltimore," Mary told him over the comms.
It was taking a long time.
"May I help you two?" Steve asked them after several seconds of silence.
"Well, no, but that's just something that would be expected of me," Tony argued weakly.
"And that's what you need to go and introduce," Bruce insisted. "I can work with Jarvis here, and we make all the necessary calculations, and see what actually needs to be done."
When they got to the hospital Tony slipped on his ball cap and sunglasses, grabbed Wade's backpack, and took Wade's hand as they walked into the hospital. Wade looked at the hospital, looking to see how high up it went, and how many buildings there were. The doors opened for them and Tony went up to the front desk to check in. Tony had requested that Julie come to this hospital because visitors were required to check in, and Tony had handled the privacy of her visitors list himself. Just in case.
Steve watched Peter as he showed him how to make a folder on the desktop for all his images that he kept downloading. Steve tried not to think about how a five-year-old was showing how to use a computer. There was a knock at the door, and Steve got up, ruffling Peter's hair, and went over, looking through the peephole. He blinked seeing a man with a familiar Captain America ball cap a goatee, and sunglasses on. Tony.
Tony blinked a little. He hadn't thought of that. "He needed Tony to finish the Serum first, to do the tests," Bruce spoke up. "Don't mess with the only one who's able to figure it out, until you know you don't need them anymore."
"Of course, Sir."
The sound of smacking skin had caught Steve’s attention, and that’s when he saw Tony. Almost vibrating on the couch. Loki looked over at him, slowly standing up to move away from Tony. He wasn’t spooked, but the look in his eyes said that he didn’t want to take the risk of a bomb going off in his face. And that’s what Tony looked like. Steve started to step closer, as did Rhodey, but Bruce had put a hand on Rhodey’s arm to stop him, shaking his head a little.
“Well, my next choice would have been Reed Richards.”
"We need your help," Coulson said, holding out a SHIELD tablet to him. Tony looked at him, then took it.
“I have near perfect recollection, Tony,” Steve said with a fond little smile. Of course he knew how long it had been since Tony had visited his therapist. But since it was still under a two month period he hadn’t felt a need to start pestering Tony about scheduling another visit. Maybe now, though, would be a perfect time to get him back down there. Maybe it would help Tony get some sleep. “I think that it wouldn’t be a bad idea to go see Danielle. In fact, I think that the workshop should remain locked until you do go see her.”
"You're telling me," Tony said, snorting softly.
"He cooks with one arm??" Tony turned to look at her.
Steve crouched down, bending his knees, so that he was eye level with Peter, and put out his hand. "It's a pleasure to meet you as well, Peter." Steve smiled at the boy, and he got a little smile back, Peter sticking his hand out without hesitation, and shaking Steve's hand, waving it up and down with exaggeration.Steve chuckled, and that caused Peter to giggle, knowing that his action was silly.
"Means that you and I can work on a way to counter-act the serum," Tony said, turning to look at him. "We already know the ground work."
"I'm so sorry, buddy, I'm sorry." Tony rubbed his back, running his other hand through the little boys hair. "I tried to get back to you sooner."
"Later, I want you to explain to me the details of subtractive sculpture," Tony said as he walked into the living room, Steve close on his heels. "I mean, I have an idea, but I want to know materials and tools involved."
"She'll be doing that pretty quick, won't she?" He moved her carefully onto her back, taking the stuff that Tony gave him to help with the diaper change.
"Looks like it's boy shaped," Mary said from the kitchen.
Seriously, everyone is awesome! Your comments make my day when I read them! I read each one, and I'm gong to try and start responding to everyone as well.
"We might finally be getting somewhere," Steve agreed. "I'm getting real tired of this dragging out, putting more people at risk." He leaned against Tony's shoulder, both skimming through the information.
"I'm working on that, actually," Tony said. It wasn't just the earth that the arc reactor was dangerous for. "There was the large one back in Malibu, and that generated power, and it was safe enough to be near. And if I can make this in a cave, who's to say that I can't make another one that can generate enough energy to power a building, and eventually a city block in New York, or even an entire city?"
“By strong feeling you mean-“
"I like staying with you," Peter told his Daddy. "I like having everyone close."
Please, continue giving your feedback, it really brings a smile to my face to see your comments, to see the kudos and likes, and bookmarks, and the views. Thank you to Everyone! Enjoy!
"It feels weird," Tony admitted, feeling a bit better as he smelled the pizza int he oven. It had probably been nearly two days since he had eaten actual food, and since he couldn't have any alcohol he would actually need food sustenance. "When he first saw it, he wanted to know if that was a light in my chest, and then he says, 'I like blue.' Rhodey, I like blue," Tony let out a little laugh. "In a fashion only kids can pull off. Sometimes his little finger will tap it, lightly, but he just puts his hand over it, like he's feeling it."
Steve frowned. "That's extortion and blackmail!"
"When he's hovering just above your face, eyes wide open, like he's trying to study you?" Steve said as he walked into the attached bathroom, leaving the door open.
"I'm not brooding," Tony said as they stepped into the elevator. "I'm working, I still have stuff that I need to make for my company." Mary looked at him. "I'm not brooding."
In the end it was decided that Bruce would stay with the Fitzpatrick's to watch Peter and Wade, and Bruce would be able to keep Peter from seeing Loki again when they got back, Tony didn't want another reason for his son to have a nightmare. Clint and Natasha had come in a borrowed vehicle, and they said it would be better for them, plus Tony and Steve, to drive that back to SHIELD, then take a Quinjet back to the mansion. There was enough space to land on the helicopter landing on top of the mansion, even if it would draw a little bit of attention, and the Quinjet would be the easiest way to transport Coulson.
"I have a feeling I know what's going to happen." They could hear the smirk in Pepper's voice. "I'll meet you over there in half an hour."
“Blueberry pancakes are only made on birthdays, no other days,” Mary said seriously.
“You’re not the only one,” Steve said, then dropped a kiss on the side of Tony’s head. “Happy to be in the thick of it with you, though.” Tony hummed happily.
"Completely serious." She tossed him an Andes mint.
"I'm pretty sure they're the same fries, Tony."
"Take it while you can," Tony said as he came back over, dropping a diaper and a onesie in his lap. "She'll wake you up in the middle of the night, and then forget about it when she figures out how to crawl out of a crib."
"That's a low blow, Tony," Mary frowned comically at him. "I'm the mother to your child!"
“Bribes, James, bribes.” She motioned towards the boys that were back to work again. “Now, if you’ll excuse me, I need to work how to dye glass, and entertain the other two babies in this apartment. Sticking you with five kids would probably overload your brain.”
Also, if you go to my Tubmlr page (megaranoelle.tumblr.com) you can catch some behinds the scene stuff about the fic. No spoilers, promise. Maybe you can influence the story.
"Would you be able to shed some light on what happened between Tony and Steve?" She knew it was a long shot, and this was close to an invasion of Tony's privacy "What they talked about, what they did, all that while I was out."
Second before he jumped to his feet, Steve was able to see three people still in the room, and he heard footsteps fading away down some steps. He was in the air, slamming his shield into the back of one of the men and used the momentum to plant both feet on the chest of another. A gun shot flew past him as he landed on his feet, and he threw his shield to make contact with the last man’s stomach and to ricochet back.
“Yes!” Tony turned to face him, putting his hands on Steve’s cheeks. “It’s like a cult, Steven, and there is no fighting it. You don’t want them to turn on you, trust me.”
"Why don't you go get your bookbag, Peter," Steve said before the boy said anything more. Of course, Steve knew what day it was, that's why Mary and Coulson would be gone. He was a little surprised that Tony had volunteered to watch Peter; he would have thought that the man would have his own plans.
Tony hummed and nodded. “He was gonna try and help, and I think he went into my head. Then, like it was all set up, and I was headed back, but something stopped me.” Steve tilted his head a little, looking at Tony curiously. “I don’t know who, or what, but it stopped, him, from finding me again. I, I really can’t explain it too much, Steve, because I’m not sure what I remember or not.” His head was brought to rest against Steve’s chest, fingers carding through his hair and rubbing at his scalp. “There was two much magic around, and then Strange, and Loki, and,” Tony paused, frowning. “There was someone else there. The Maximoff girl?” Tony tried not to tense up when Steve didn’t deny it. “Then there was just, pain. It was all too much noise, too much happening.” Steve kissed his head again.
"You asked me to come over," he told him. "Remember, you called me yesterday and we had this whole conversation. I said that the end of my 72 hour leave was coming up,and then I'd actually have to go back to doing my military job, and you said-"
Eventually, he dozes off just to wake up two hours later as Tony comes in. Steve stares at the wall, the anger having not faded a single bit despite the sleep. It’s almost worse now, when he’s been wrenched back into a living nightmare from the peace of sleep.
”I’m not sure if you think it’s a little rushed, but I’d really like to –”
Without opening his eyes, Steve somewhat complied, lifting his hips shakily. Tony was pretty sure that the only reason Steve managed it at all was because it was familiar, because Tony had done this countless of times before. He did love it when he could tell that his cock was hitting Steve just right.
And it hurts to think about it. It hurts so much, but Steve keeps going stubbornly. His hand works desperately as he imagines Tony filling him, fucking him, whispering lewdly into his ear.
”Steve,” Tony sighs, burying his fingers into Steve’s hair. His voice sounds so hopeful and Steve aches hearing it.
”Just the fact that you know. She knows, Tony. About you leaving. I ended up calling her after a few days, because your ’solution’ wasn’t working so well for me.”
”Come on, I’m sure we’ve got more important things to discuss”, he continues, pulling the door to the conference room open.
Taken care of Steve.
Despite all of his efforts, some paparazzi did manage to snap a photo of him when he was waiting the twins and sell it to the tabloids for an astronomical amount of money. One Tony Stark had paid the paparazzi a visit and told him to give the money off to charity or he’d be fighting with SI lawyers until he, his dead mother and everyone he knew was bankrupt. Still, Steve hadn’t been able to go to the internet for a month without CAPTAIN AMERICA PREGNANT – SEE THE PICTURES slamming to his face.
”Tony”, he whispers brokenly. Hearing this, something gets stuck into Tony’s throat, and he breathes out through his nose heavily.
Despite it having been some time since Steve had last been the one doing the fucking, he did touch Tony’s ass with his fingers fairly often and thus, it wasn’t hard for him to find the spot. Tony let out a small groan and Steve began to roll the tip of his finger around slowly, encouraging more noise out of him.
”But aren’t you… since when has Asgardian biology been like ours?” Thor certainly smells like an alpha, heavily so. But Steve has always thought Asgardians weren’t like them.
He sighs at Bruce’s unrelenting, doubtful expression.
”Yes. Thank you.” The therapist smiles, glancing at Steve quickly before turning his eyes back to Tony. ”I usually start by asking Steve how his week has been, but I’d like to start now by asking the question from you. How has your week been, Tony?”
In the bedroom, he pushes Steve on the bed onto his stomach, not violently but not gently either. Steve’s head is buzzing, the thrill making him feel alive for the first time in a month. This is exactly what he needs – he doesn’t want love or soft touches, he just wants something else than the limbo of numbness and anxiety for a second.
”Tony, you’re in pain, you’re not working, and you are drinking too much –”
”Alpha… Tony… please…”
”Baby”, Steve mumbles affectionately, his voice still a little rough from sleep.
”He was here with Happy and Emmy. I… when I saw what happened to Bucky and the others, I called Happy. He was crying when he answered. I could hear Emmett crying in the background, too, and I… knew.”
Steve huffs, pressing ”send” only leaving a bitter taste into his mouth. Then he hears Kieran coo, and looks at him, rising his eyebrows playfully.
”Well, good”, he says. ”I mean, it must still be pretty intense, right? The smell? It’s a relief that it doesn’t affect you, just, you know… you’re sure it doesn’t smell… bad or something? Disturbing?”
”You don’t know I was gonna ask that.”
”Tony, I trust you with my life. I trust you with our children’s lives. I just have this stubborn fear of you leaving me. I have nightmares about it, all the time. I even get jealous, as ashamed as I am to admit it. And I catch myself testing you – sometimes it’s like I’m challenging you to do it and I can’t seem to stop myself. I keep telling myself that I cannot hold onto anything as good as you forever. It’s a fault in me, not you.”
Tony considers his words carefully. There’s something he’s trying to reach, but he can’t go giving Steve hope when the reality is that he hardly even has straws to grasp, never mind anything you could even remotely call certain. All he has is this stubborn thought that won’t leave him, and his will.
”How would
”Aw, you started without me. Rude”, Tony had said lightly, throwing his jacket onto the empty seat next to Bruce and sitting down to eat.
It’s easy to see Steve’s having a hard time keeping his promise of being honest about the pain, but finally, he relents.
”Should’ve seen me a couple of months ago”, Steve answers, trying to feign a light tone. Bucky’s eyes don’t let up for a second.
Steve wakes up in panic. His heart is racing, and his body aches like he’s having a fever. Nat is standing next to the bed and gripping his shoulder.
“Very funny, honey”, he’d remarked as the door had shut behind him. Steve had followed his brisk footsteps to the kitchen with a slightly troubled expression on his face, but Tony had just smirked at him.
”This is amazing. Really, Tony”, Steve tells him earnestly, and enjoys how Tony’s shoulders relax at his warm tone.
Tony gives himself a few strokes, and Steve watches his motions with hungry eyes, emitting a needy whine. He hopes that Tony doesn’t want him to beg, because he’s not sure if he has it in him to beg. He’s more a puddle than a man at this point.
”I love you too. A thousand times and again, Captain”, he says against it.
Tony knits his brows. ”Hey”, he says. ”Come here.”
The rest of the hour is spent concentrated on the issue of trust, and by the end of the session, Steve feels exhausted. They agree to both be there next week too.
”God, I miss them already”, he confesses after a moment. Tony kisses Steve’s jawline, breathes into his ear in a way that makes Steve’s skin tingle.
actually be enormously worried about.
After he’s done, Steve steps into the shower, his cock hanging heavy between his legs. He washes himself, then just stands under the water stream feeling nauseous. Finally, he relents and takes his cock into his hand, trying to silence his mind. He strokes his cock mechanically in order to relieve himself.
He’s going to have to have find one himself, Steve thinks, as he steps out of the ship not more than thirty minutes later. It feels like they’ve been gone for a long time, but they’d left in the morning and it isn’t even dark yet. Steve eyes the windows of the compound as he walks towards it in the last warm rays of the sun, trying to catch Tony watching them return in one of them. He doesn’t notice him, but some windows catch the sunlight so brightly that Steve can’t be sure if Tony’s in one of them or not.
"You're too good for me, seriously," Tony murmured quietly. "You're also horrible for my ego."
"I honestly can't answers any of those questions, ma'am," Steve said, and Pepper went silent.
"Yes!"
“I would like to see him talk to someone, at some point,” Tony confessed. “Kid keeps a lot inside, and I know what that’s like. I know that he knows that his Mom isn’t getting any better, and whether or not if he actually has dealt with the actions of being the one to pull the trigger on his dad.”
"-what did they need the Iridium for?" Tony heard Bruce as he walked into the room.
Tony knew he had to tell her now, before she went full on mother mode. .... Who was he kidding, it was going to happen after he told her, but better it be that way, than letting her mind come up with every horror imaginable.
Mary let out a sigh and nodded. "He is. And I missed some big signs, Steve" The blonde frowned and leaned forward. "We're going to have a lot of ground work to lay out."
“I’ll be fine,” Tony told him. “Jarvis pick up the readings, so I’m not going to accidentally fly into one.” The ‘Again’ is left unsaid. “I still need to know what exactly it is we’re up against. They seemed to be getting bigger and bigger, and if it gets too much, then it will actually break into the Tower.”
"It's still Valentine's Day, right? I'm not off?" Tony shook his head and Steve look relieved.
“You’re going to run errands?” Steve questioned. Tony’s nose twitched a little in annoyance. “Just checking,” Steve said with a chuckle, giving him a little kiss. “I’m sure there might be, but I’m also sure that it’s not something we absolutely need. I assume that the floor where his party will be is ready?” Tony hummed and nodded. “I don’t think we need much more. Mary and Coulson said they would help out to get the rooms decorated and set up. If you want you can always pick up some more ice cream.”
Tony would have to make sure that Peter ate three meals a day, that he had his snack, and went to bed on time, and took his bath, and brushed his teeth, and make sure that he didn't have nightmares. He have to be in charge of any punishments, of making sure that Peter did his chores. Tony would have to do all of that, and half of that stuff Tony didn't even do himself! He was already turning into Howard.
"Watch out, Cap, someone might think that you were worried about me." Tony smiled a little, patting Steve's arm. Tony felt Steve smile through his hair. "Um, hey, follow me?" Tony asked as he got up off the bed. Steve tilted his head, Tony thinking not unlike a golden retriever, or maybe a labrador. "Just, come on." Tony headed for the elevator, Jarvis bringing it back down for him. Inside Tony hit a button before Steve got on.
“I think you’re a little late,” she said with a breathless chuckle, leaning back a little to cup his cheek with her hand. “Still as handsome as ever.” She smiled when Evelyn pushed her head in between them. “Yes, I see you as well, Evelyn. Decided to leave Anthony at home today, then?” Peggy raised an eyebrow when she felt Steve tense a little, and Evelyn cooed lowly. “I sense a story….”
Steve couldn't stop himself. He surged forward and wrapped his arms around Tony, pulling him into his lap, against his chest. "I won't let that happen," he promised fiercely. "I promised Peter, and I promise you, I won't let anything happen to you."
“What do you see?” Steve whispered against his skin, and Tony’s eyelids fluttered.
"But he'll grow into it," Tony countered. "I'm sure teenagers need lots of room."
“I don’t think you can blame the lessons on this one,” Meg said, leaning back against the counter. “He jumped over the couch, rolled across the floor-“
"No, something must have come up," Tony mumbled, leaning against a counter. "He still had uneasy feelings about some of the missions that SHIELD was sending them on, and he was still pretty upset about the new Helicarriers being housed at the Triskelion." Tony had helped Fury with the designs to upgrade the camouflage tech, and the engines. He switched them over to his repulsor technology so that there was less of a chance of a repeat performance from nearly a year ago. "Something isn't sitting right, Bruce."
“Ah, Jamie!” Steve sat up and took her hands gently. “No, no, baby, we have to keep that on.” She looked at him with big blue eyes. “Nope, that’s the rule, we all have to wear underwear.” Tony coughed into his hand and he looked away. Steve raised an amused eyebrow at him. “Everyone under twenty has to wear underwear, at all times.”
"Wanna feel the Universe again?" Steve said with a slight chuckle.
Steve wasn’t sure if it was Tony’s repairs, or something else that was interfering, but his comm was currently useless. A crashing sound caught his attention and his eyes flickered over to the next house. There was a flurry of movement past a window, and Steve was off like a shot, pulling his shield from his back. He saw some light flickering in the small basement window, and Steve was holding up his shield and curling up to crash through the first floor window.
"Not very high for the first day or two," she said. "We want to get his heart working at normal pace again, but the stress of walking might overdo it right away."
“Steve!” The two men looked over as a red-headed woman walked over to him. “We missed you this week. There’s gonna be a bake-sale next week, and Brenda was hoping to get your name down on the list.” Her eyes slid over to Bucky and her smile perked up a bit more. “Who’s your handsome friend? I hope not your boyfriend?”
“Betrayed!” Tony wailed, making the boys giggle a little, which made Jamie giggle. “I’ve been betrayed!” Steve leaned his head in to whisper in Peter’s ear. Tony yelped and started to wiggle away when Peter started to tickle the back of his neck. “Betrayal!” He laughed and Wade actually cackled before joining in to help Peter. Jamie was pushing herself up, and Steve wrapped an arm around her waist before tickling her secret spot, making her squeal with laughter.
Bucky had clenched his jaw as Steve spoke, listening to what he was saying, and hearing the words start to line up with some of the more recent thoughts he had been having. He woke up every morning, and he wasn't expecting to see one of his Handlers there in front of him, he was getting used to the idea that he woke up on his own volition now. No one was waiting off to the wings to take him back to the Chair, or back to freeze him. He could make his own choices now, and he had help.
"We're all doomed if they ever have to split," Tony told him. Steve just nodded with a grave seriousness. They ate in a comfortable silence for a few minutes, before Tony spoke up again. "Steve." He had said it quietly, but Steve's head shot up when he heard the use of his first name. Tony almost flinched; apparently it had not gone unnoticed that Tony only used his first name when he was being serious. Rhodey would gloat if he ever found out about that. "I have to.... I can't....." Tony let out a soft sigh, then looked into his eyes. "Thank you." There was so much more than he wanted to say, that he needed to say to the blonde, but he physically couldn't get it all out without needing another breathing treatment.
"Because I've done the whole song and dance," Steve lashed out. "I've done the not sleeping, not eating, not
"Agent," Tony responded, watching peter examine the drawing table, then opening all the shelves of the storage compartments right by it.
"That just seems like it be counter-intuitive," Tony said, crossing his arms across his chest a little.
"I didn't actually think she'd name her kids after us, I was just joking around."
“Of course, Sir,” Jarvis said through his watch.
There was a bit of silence in the room, everyone mulling over their options. Except for Tony, he was glaring daggers at Natasha, because he knew what she had decided. "Who would be going to DC, Agent Romanoff?" He was still a little mad about being spied on, too. Sue him.
Tony reached over, poking his cheek as they drove away from the damage, eyes still on the road. "You sense of duty is speaking," he said, "and it's loud." Tony glanced over at him real quick. "I know you want to help, but we just gotta lay low right now. We saved the world, I think that we're allowed to take a little break."
"I'm sorry, you're right," Tony nodded. "You're so smart Petey, remembering all the rules." Peter smiled, turned his little body to kiss Tony's cheek, making the man smile.
As usual, I own not much, Marvel own more, Disney own some, blah blah.
"I keep snapping them in half," Steve said, a little embarrassed. "They weren't exactly meant for a super soldier, so I eventually just got my own box."
"I think I'm rotting from the inside out with all the sweetness," Tony said to them. Steve looked at him with an open face of raw happiness, and Jamie took that moment to press her face to his neck, burring her lips as hard as she could. Steve's eyes widened and he yelped in laughter, trying to tuck his head down. "You have the same tickle spot!"
"Hey, Tony," they could hear the smile in his voice.
Tony looked at Steve as he spoke, a little taken aback if he were honest with himself, and he saw the fire in Steve's eyes, but it was a good thing. But then he saw something else, and it really hit Tony then, Steve was still young, like really young. He had gone into the war barely over Twenty, and that was all he had known after that. Steve was still stuck in a Twenty-Six year old body, never really having grown up, had fun, done everything he should have been doing in his Twenties.
“I’m sure a little exercise wouldn’t hurt, Tony,” Rachel piped up, sharing an identical smirk with her daughter.
Tony knew what Steve was feeling. He would dream about the cave if he got too hot. Jarvis would drop the temperature of his bedrooms to nearly freezing when that would happen, just for a few hours, until Tony could regulate. Tony knew what he had to do.
Unbeta'd as usual, Marvel owns more than me, and the songs are property of their respective artists/movies.
"She used to have pink hair," Steve told him.
“Why’s that, Mister Nineteen-Forties?”
"I don't think that's going to be very difficult for you," Rhodey said, closing the fridge doors to face Tony, a little smile on his face. "Seeing the way that kid is in love with you?" Tony preened a little at the compliment, and the fact. "And how you didn't flinch at the word, Daddy."
"Hello, young Master Peter," Jarvis said as jovially as an AI could. "It is a distinct pleasure to meet you." Peter's eyes widened when Jarvis spoke, and he turned his head around quickly, looking for the person who was talking. "I'm afraid that you won't actually find me, I have no body." Peter looked at Tony with wide eyes.
“Please don’t let her first word be sex,” Steve murmured, only loud enough for Tony and Bucky to hear.
There was a light rumble through the building as Steve burst through the door to the roof, and his breath caught in his throat for a second. Then he was sprinting across the roof, taking the tired looking Tony into his arms. He had been leaning against Thor’s side, Thor supporting most of his weight, but he didn’t look hurt. Tony seemed to sage against Steve once his arm were around him, and he Tony was dropping his head, slotting his face into Steve’s neck against his shoulder.
Mary tilted her head when she heard a sound, like something bumping around a vent. She moved quietly to the side, following the sound, the other agents fanning around the room. She followed the sound over to the computer station, leaning down. It's where the sound stopped. Until she heard, something like, a whimper?
There were a few moments of silence, Rachel reading the info upside down, and both started frowning. "Her parents were Hydra?" Tony nodded. "What about this Aunt?"
Strange cleared his throat a little, a small disapproving frown on his features. “As for the interfering force that both helped and hindered, that is still a complete mystery to me. It’s not like something I’ve ever encountered before, and I can’t seem to find it again. I can tell for a fact that it’s not malevolent, though.”
"Again," she smirked at him.
“Coffee would never try to blackmail me,” Tony murmured as he took a drink. “Coffee would never try to kill me.”
“Actually, Sir,” Jarvis spoke up and Tony’s eye twitched slightly. “These specific frames were the indoor frames. The workshop frames were the two-tone square frames.” Steve smirked a little at him, still not saying anything. He pulled off a piece of bread and handed it over to Jamie when she glanced over at him, and she diligently started to nibble on it. “There were also the two pair of solid color squares frames, one in black, the other in white, that you declared to be used for social events. You also ordered one pair of round rimmed glasses, as you stated, to break up the monotony.”
"Scared that he might lose you," Mary cut him off. Tony opened his mouth, then closed it. "In another universe, maybe he doesn't take the chance. Maybe he doesn't get unthawed from the ice and he loses you before he even gets a chance, or maybe you don't figure out the palladium and he watches you die."
"I already did twelve miles in the gym this morning," Steve informed her and they heard a scoff of disgust.
“I do not fancy being under this beings control again. I did it once and you were the one to deal with the aftermath of that.” Loki lazily circled the two men between them. “And if I were to risk that again, I would not be able too, for your organization has lost the scepter that was originally handed to me. The power that it held was beyond what most humans can comprehend.”
“Bite your tongue!”
Steve rubbed the back of his neck a little. "I've had a lot on my mind today, and I couldn't get to sleep."
"I don't want to wake him up, though," Tony said, looking towards the door to his room.
"Better than brain damage," Tony muttered to himself. He flipped through some vitals, turning his head a little when he heard a knock on his door. The door opened and Steve walked in with a food tray.
“She’s trying to work out why she can’t get to what she wants,” Peter said, looking over at them. “She’ll keep working at it until she figures out the problem.”
"Shower first, kiss after." Steve smiled at him.
"No," Bucky spoke up and Steve whipped his head around. Meg was already getting up to try and stop what they knew Bucky was going to say. "He wanted to hurt your mom." Meg slumped against Bucky's back, hitting his shoulder with her fist. She muttered something that made Bucky frown, not understanding. Steve turned back to look at Wade.
"I didn't get her daughter pregnant," Coulson said, a smile on his face, looking a little smug in Tony's direction. "I don't think I'm going to have the same problems as you."
What was Tony thinking? Oh, getting out of the restaurant, away from Pepper and Natalie Rushman, that was easy. Getting over to the Grand Prix, checking in on Mary and Peter up in one of the VIP boxes? Childs play. Going down to the cars, putting on a Stark racing suit and declaring that he was going to race? Tony was going to blame all that on the palladium. It was obviously making him sick, clouding his judgement.
Tony’s hand shot out to grab at Steve’s arm, Steve’s eyes widening. “Did she-“ Steve whispered and Tony nodded. “She stood up.”
“What are we going to do about the Serum that they’ve already got?” Steve asked, looking between the two scientists. “They might already be using that on people, right?”
“I’m proud, Tony, you’re slowly learning, and I don’t have to tell you anymore.” She grinned and Tony rolled his eyes. “I think you might be my favorite client to work with.”
“So, how much do you want?” Tony asked after a second, sitting on the edge of the chair. Mary blinked then tilted her head a little. “We usually like to keep things like this out of the media, and I don’t think you want the attention, since you came to me first. So, I’m just wondering-“
"Daddy makes the best pasta!" Peter exclaimed happily. "He says it's cause his Mama was, um, tally-on."
"Of course," she said a little too quickly.
Something about Peter had said, about his Dad's schooling, it struck a chord in Steve. It was odd, but it was something he had recently read, wasn't it? Now Steve needed to get back to his apartment. He could just be overreacting, or perhaps there was something about the puzzle of Peter's Dad that was slotting into place.
“Cats are almost like you,” Steve smirked. “You want a
"What are you doing?"
In the end, all Tony had to do was talk Pepper in circles until he sprung it on her that he wanted to make her CEO. She was shocked, he knew she would be, but had accepted. She also managed to get out of him that he had wanted to spend more time with Peter, and she could almost forgive him for selling off their private art collection.
“You didn’t secretly get married while in Disneyland, did you?” Pepper asked, leaning forward.
Tony let out a little hum and nodded, turning back to the tablet. He heard her get in the elevator before he slumped on the couch, putting a hand over his face. He hadn't gotten a good night’s sleep since Steve left again, and Pepper was taking advantage of him not being able to leave the building. He had attended more meetings in the past week then he had in all of January.
"Get her assigned to Pepper if you can't get her reassigned, but tell them I no longer need a PA." Tony walked away from the computer station, over to where Bruce was inspecting the different Iron Man armors on display. He punched in a code and the glass lifted up from all the spots to let him get closer. "speaking of missions, is your Neighbor taking more missions now? Haven't seen him in a while."
Steve ran his hand through Tony’s hair, feeling some of the dust, making his hair feel not as soft as it could be. “I just get concerned. It’s kind of a default setting.” He kissed Tony lightly. “If you don’t want to talk about it with me, I know who you can talk about it with.”
"I do believe that Sir is having a panic attack, and regrettably I am unable to help him." Steve raised his eyebrows a little.
"You missed the ceremony?" Mary asked as Tony worked on his hot rod in the workshop. "Your best friend went to give you an award, and-"
Steve walked into the lab and Saw Bruce standing by the scepter, but Tony was looking at something else. Something that had nothing to do with Loki or the cube. Steve bristled a little with more anger. Did Tony really bring one of his experiments on board? Did he really thing that was more important?
“I have to take a couple of breaks,” Steve confessed. “Lindsay on Fifty-Two makes some amazing donuts on Wednesdays.”
"Not here for food." The man looked up a bit and Tony felt his body tense. "You took all the vials you made?"
"I would kill for a drink or three, don't think that's changed that much," Tony told her.
Tony growled, then screamed as he pulled against the mental restraints. There was crack, a large pop, and he was stumbling forward onto the counter. With a glance back he saw Wanda on her knees, hand to her head. He didn't delay, scooping an arm in to wrap about the baby and the blankets, and held her to his chest as he moved to the other end of the counter to scoop up the vials. Turning in a semi-circle he reached around the grab the journal, and small knife, from the desk and bound out of the room and into the hall.
Steve took a breath and nodded. "Yes, Sir." Maybe he had found a replacement punching bag.
“I wasn’t actually involved in this one,” he told her. “So not many details I can tell you about.”
"Well, I won't give up on us," Steve picked back up in the song, a small smile on his face. "God knows I'm tough enough." He started to sway with Tony in the hallway. "We've got a lot to learn." His hand slid down to Tony's waist.
"That all changed when you literally let Hydra into your bed," Tony commented.
That's when Tony was aware of his own reactions. The tiny little receptors on his fingers could feel Steve's shirt, how it wasn't as soft, how he gripped it tightly in his fist, and how warm Steve's skin was against his palm as the other hand had moved to slip underneath the shirt, pushing down against side. Every twitch of Steve's muscles sent a ripple through his hand, up his arm, and spiderwebbing through his body like electricity.
"I live here, and he's my friend," Meg said looking at Bucky. "I'm not keeping it from him when you come here, so get used to it." Bucky's eyes narrowed a little at her, but not in anger. More annoyance. Sometimes he saw that look on Tony's face when directed at Meg. There was some rustling suddenly from the baby monitor on the coffee table, and some soft cries from one of the twins. "Oh look at that, my
He released one more breath and pushed himself to move. He needed to get Jamie from Julie, needed to check on Peter, who was with Wade. He knew that Phil was with Mary and William at the hospital, and Steve would wait for the word from the Agent before venturing down there. After he lost his own Mother, he knew that sometimes you just needed space, but he still held out hope that the surgery would go well. As Steve moved to the elevators, he was already thinking of ways to triple check the security measures with Jarvis.
"I approve." She nodded. Steve kept smiling and walked back over to Tony as he booked an extra room, throwing his name a bit to make sure it would be ready.
"I'll be right there." Tony flipped the faceplate up, about to take off the helmet, when a rumble on the roof caught his attention. Stane landed and aimed his weapons right at Tony. Tony's eyes widened and the faceplate went back down, moving back to avoid the hit. How had he survived from the fall??
“I should probably eat breakfast,” Steve admitted as he took Tony’s hands, levering himself up as well. Tony leaned up to run his hands through Steve’s hair, and he winced a little. “I didn’t even think about what that looked like. I heard Jamie through the baby monitor and I was rolling out of bed without thinking.”
It was much easier getting the top part of the onesie on, and he snapped up the front, then picked her up again. "That has to be so much warmer, yeah? Doesn't that feel better?"
“I think you don’t get anything unless you’ve earned it,” Bucky barked back, standing behind Steve’s shoulder.
Steve took Tony's hand as he stood back up, balancing Jamie on his hip, and kissed his knuckles. "It's probably just bad timing," Steve told him. "He doesn't know what happened, and he just got back from a vacation."
"Probably two more days at least," Tony said, taking the warm plate from Steve and handing off the next, setting the plate down on the dining table. "We can't keep him forever." He turned and tickled Peter's sides, making the little boy giggle and wiggle.
“I’m Sora!” Peter quickly claimed, turning on the couch to look at them. “From Kingdom Hearts! Wade wants to be Riku.” Steve’s brow drew together in confusion and he looked at Tony.
Tony took the town car that Happy usually drove him around in to Mary's apartment. He had to park on the street and he looked around the neighborhood before he got out of the car. The sun was setting, there were other kids playing on the street, chasing each other around the corner, a couple of dogs barking and following them. It wasn't a busy street, a busy area, but it also didn't scream the safest place for a new, young mother to live with her infant son, alone. This was not what Tony Stark was used to, either.
“Yes, I brought you cake for your birthday, even though I know you don’t like that.” She got up and motioned for him to get up, too. “Come, before Peter just shoves his whole face into it.”
“Is there a limit?” Rachel asked, noticing how he emptied the carafe.
"Did you know, that even celebrities are people, too? I know, it's a shocking misconception, where the general public and news organizations would have us believe that they are akin to Gods!"
“’m here,” Tony said quietly to her. He then wiggled his fingers a little and looked up at Steve.  Steve bit his lip a little, and laid down next to him, taking his hand and wrapping an arm around Tony and Jamie. “’m here,” he repeated.
"And insane," Tony muttered.
“This was your big plan?” Tony huffed out. He could easily overpower the man at just the right angle, he needed to get to the car. Steve was still fighting behind him, unaware of what was happening. They were keeping him well distracted. “Kidnap me and expect me to re-create your flawed research? I don’t think so,” Tony shook his head. “There’s a history of people blowing up when they capture me, you know.”
"Goodbye Meg!" Steve called out, rubbing his forehead with the heel of his hand.
"So, I don't care if Peter wants to stay home for the weekend, but I don't know what your plans are," Mary changed the subject, and Tony swore he heard the little laugh she was trying to keep silent.
“You usually couldn’t care less what they say,” Mary told him. “Anyway, they’re only going to do it because of what happened with SHIELD, so even more reason to ignore them.” Tony shrugged a little.
“Oh, I know you are not about to use the small argument with me,” Bucky said, the Brooklyn boy showing just as Tony predicted he would. Bucky apparently remembered enough about Steve. “How old were you before you were begging for lessons at the boxing gym?”
