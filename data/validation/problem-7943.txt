"Fuck, you really like it, huh? Yeah, why don't we take the edge off before I fuck you silly?" Tony pushed a third finger in, Steve's ass tight around his hand, but wet and ready. "God, you're gorgeous. Hold on to the sheets, I'm gonna make you cum all over yourself, all over that pretty chest, so I can watch all your jizz slide off you, get the bed so dirty while I fuck you."
"Be direct." He heard Nat whisper as she walked by him, on her way out. Once it was just them, it felt like all the air was sucked out of the room. Steve stood up, walking over to Tony, who wasn't showing any emotion, one way or another.
"Steve!" He caught up with him before he was able to make it back to the exit. Steve turned around and looked relieved to see him.
remember that. "I mean, I went up to ask him for the linens that afternoon. He was outside the observation deck on the roof."
"You'll find out soon enough, nosy Nelly." Tony was still looking a little nervous, so Steve resolved to try to ease the conversation into the charity work, if it would make things easier on him.
They spent hours going over everything Tony could think of, any angle the board members might try to use to throw Steve off. Thankfully, the serum made it so that Steve could retain large amounts of information quickly, and Tony was great at explaining complex concepts in a way that made it easy to understand. They reviewed the building specs. Steve learned about power distribution and how integrating the reactor would redirect a lot of the strain from increased usage. They went over the history of US conflict in the Middle East. He taught Steve about his rights as a stockholder, in case they wanted to question his being there. It was well past midnight when they were both exhausted and slouched down, only a few fluffy pillows keeping them up and awake.
up to, and this perfect specimen of a human would not,
Tony got some color back in his face, but his face remained scrunched up in confusion. "Dark....you mean the denim pants." Tony's face lit up, "Oh! Um. No. Don't...don't worry about it. It's not a big deal. There's nothing to hide. It's just...I only asked for pictures so I could make sure they weren't buying you something ridiculous, you know."
"Remember. Worst case scenario, just text me and Ironman can show up in 5 minutes flat, claiming an Avengers emergency."
“Why are you….
"That about wraps it up, unless you plan on doing the splits mid-battle." Tony got down from his spot on the table and over to a screen, now typing away.
Tony was so, so happy. This is what he'd always wanted. Someone who cared, who loved him back, who could make him laugh, who made him feel like the most special guy in the world. And damn, that smile. He'd never grow tired of seeing that smile.
"You don't think Birdbrain's already moved in?" Tony asked as Steve got a wet towel, careful to get it nice and warm before wiping it on Tony's chest.
“CA-196121-SS-18”
"Sort of, yeah." Tony said, "It would be like offering aid to an Italian city right after World war 2. Some racist people with money think they're all terrorists, but they're not."
"Ready to grab dinner then?"
“Jarvis, initiate security protocol!” They both stood, waiting for something to happen, but nothing did. After a few long, tense seconds, Tony pulled up his faceplate with one shaky hand. “Why is my HUD down? Jarvis?! Scan this guy! Who the fuck is he? How did he get in here?”
It definitely wasn't like he was
Steve didn't deserve to be objectified, or drooled over. As much as Tony hated to admit it, his purely aesthetic crush was maybe beginning to develop into something more.
"I'm sure you'd never do anything that would hurt the company."
to be. Maybe the trip wouldn’t be a waste, after all. “It’s me, J. Security code CA-196121-SS-18.”
" Sam clarified.
"I'm over here!" Steve heard a muffled Tony calling from the other side of the lab.
“Probably going on his morning run.” Tony ran to the elevators. “Good to know he’s just as crazy in this universe too. Take me up to the roof. I shouldn’t bump into anyone up there.”
"Shhh...yeah. Feel that, baby? Good, isn't it? God, your hole is really opening up so nicely for me now. I think I can put another finger in right now. You want that, baby?" Tony was holding on to Steve's shoulder as he pushed his hand deeper. Steve was still reeling from the pressure on his sensitive spot, and couldn't answer, pushing his hips down to feel more, his eyes rolling back, mouth agape.
this morning."
"Deal." Tony took Steve's hand and shook it. "Pals."
“H-here…Like...like that time...” Tony tapped himself on his right buttcheek. Steve didn’t know what he meant. What time? It seemed Tony wanted to maybe…be spanked? He smacked him lightly, to test the waters.
was the problem. The barrier that kept Tony from finding peace and happiness in his own home.
Steve's blush was noticeable now, but he seemed to mull it over before giving in.
"That's barely anything!" Steve had never seen a smaller garment, except maybe on the men in the Las Vegas billboards.
Everyone had eyes on Tony then. He blinked and then straightened up and seemed to steel himself for his response.
"It would be an honor!" Thor agreed. "I am no stranger to helping civilizations progress. Why, I recently encountered a giant race of dwarfs in the outermost regions of space, and carried power structures for them as large as your city's buildings!"
"Too stupid?" Bucky stifled a laugh.
- talked myself out of doing anything else about my weird budding feelings for you at the time. And I wouldn’t have ever acted on them. By the same token, my Steve probably only came back to me a few nights later because the kiss weighed on him, he probably mulled it over, and came to the conclusion that being with me was worth a shot. I doubt he would have considered it, or ever made a move if I hadn’t kissed him that night.”
They ended the afternoon with an early dinner at an Italian restaurant near the hotel. It wasn't fancy, in fact the place was a little worn down. The food was good, but not spectacular. However, Steve cherished every moment of it, if only to see the shine in Tony's eyes while he excitedly translated the Italian menu to Steve, recommending certain dishes and telling him all about his mother's Italian heritage. It was while Tony was (incorrectly) reciting the words to an old Italian lullaby his nanny used to sing to him, that Steve thought to himself,
“Nnn...don’ go.” He heard a small voice whimper. Steve immediately abandoned his idea, throwing the stupid pillow out of his way - he needed to get back to his Tony.
just showered again since Dum-E blasted them, after all. But feeling Tony writhe above him, hearing him squeal and moan in ecstasy, was more than enough encouragement.
“You mean you didn’t tell anyone where you went?” Steve gaped. “Tony - you - you could have gotten hurt! You could have been trapped over there, and no one would know where you were! You could have brought over a monster or some evil version of yourself for all you know!”
"Night."
“I don’t…I don’t know.” Steve held on tight. It wasn’t right. It was selfish, to want to keep this Tony here. Finally, after a long, sorrowful squeeze, he let Tony go. The other Steve - the
“He said photons are random.” Steve trekked on, trying to move the conversation forward. “And that is the only change that could have set things apart. It was in 2012, when we-”
Steve realized he wasn’t going to last much longer.
"You?!" Tony's eyes went wide. "No. They're vultures. They'll eat you alive."
They found some of Tony's old, oversized MIT sweaters inside a broom closet in the back of the lab, swapped out their ruined shirts, and put Dum-E back on his charging station lest he try to help out with the cleanup in their absence. The elevator ride to the observatory was silent, but not uncomfortable. As they had done a hundred times before, they grabbed some blankets from the patio chairs on the deck, and sat on the edge of the balcony, overlooking the city.
"You remembered! Strawberries
“I’m so sorry.” Steve pulled him in, and somehow Tony found himself buried in Steve’s chest. His warm, broad, safe....god how could he fall for him all over again?
“Oh, really? Because it sure
"Tony, you should probably leave him alone for a while. He'll get annoyed if you keep sending these messages nonstop."
He'd never done
"Hm?" Steve's heart was racing, had Tony noticed him?
Steve woke up a little late, refreshed, and ready to start the day. Thankfully, he'd decided not to let SHIELD know he was back yet, though he was sure Fury already knew. He'd take another week off work, at least to get readjusted again, now that he had the time.
"Yeah. He was an amazing player too. Rookie of the year, All star player and got MVP too. Basically got them the championship in 55'."
"Mine... Mine... You're
guys!"
"Maybe." Steve mulled it over. "I don't even know how to flirt though."
"Hey, what are you working on?" Steve's heart raced, even after half a day of trying to compose himself, just seeing the handsome engineer in old tattered jeans and an oil stained tee shirt was enough to make him nervous again. Now that he was acutely aware of his feelings for Tony, it was all he could think about.
"Hey," Steve laid on his stomach, stuffing a pillow under his chest so he could comfortably keep the phone propped up in front of him. "Bad day?"
“Holy shit! Was that Christine from WHIH talking to you?” He shoved Steve with his elbow. “I know I’m a married man, but wowza. I could watch
“That has nothing to do with it, Tony.” Pepper answered. “We just weren’t compatible. But you know what? I never, ever felt unloved around you. You know that, right?” Tony gave her a side-eye like he wasn’t believing a word out of her mouth. “I’m serious. Even at our worst, you always put me first. You always put my needs ahead of yours, and that’s why we didn’t work. I needed you to be you, for the sake of the company, for the sake of the world. And I couldn’t be me without hindering that part of you.” Pepper ran her hand through Tony’s hair. He felt his eyes sting a little. “And through it all, I’m still here. I still love you, and you still love me. We’re still friends. And you and Steve used to be such good friends before all this happened. You can still go back to that.”
They kept that up for the rest of the movie, giggling to themselves, sharing cooking videos, then memes, eventually just ignoring the TV altogether in favor of their own separate conversation. Apparently, they lost track of time.
He didn't know if he was murmuring out loud or not, head still spinning with thoughts of Tony, but he needed to come again. The pillow he was hugging last night was squished under his stomach, with one hand he quickly pushed it down, humping up and down into it, his dick, tight against his wet boxers, was fucking between the pillow and his rumpled sheets. It didn't take long. One..two..three more pumps and his cock was pulsing again, squirting through the fabric of his underwear and leaking under the pillow, and onto the bed.
"Hey it's me. Steve. Sorry, don't want to bother but Jarvis said you hadn't eaten. I have some food for you. I can leave it out here if you-"
Steve didn't think his heart could go any faster, but he was wrong. Knowing that Tony was spending his free time working to protect him, to protect all their friends? What an amazing man. He stepped onto the platform, on top of a black pad just like Tony asked.
Steve flopped back and stared up at the ceiling, trying to take in everything Tony had thrown at him today about the tower and the last week in general. His mind jumped back and forth, and he felt his leg start to bounce. He suddenly really didn't feel like sitting still and jumped up.
"Mission failed though," Steve laughed, "They still got me some pretty ridiculous looking stuff. They made me get these 'V-necks'" Steve made an exaggerated V-motion on his chest, getting Tony to smile a bit, "Clint says it's for going to clubs. It's like he's never even met me!" By this time Tony was laughing wholeheartedly, and Steve did a little inner cheer at that. "So are you gonna teach me how to bug Barton with my clubbing pictures or what?"
me. I wish I knew what Other-Tony did, or said to him. You don’t know what it’s like at the tower. He’s so relaxed with everyone else, they’re all best buddies. And me? Steve can’t even be in the same room with me without going completely rigid, like he thinks I’m going to lose it and attack him, or his buddies again. I just feel so...dangerous there. And maybe I still am. So, yes. I’m unloveable.”
"I...suppose." Steve rubbed the back of his neck, hoping his flush wasn't noticeable.
hand is for." He squeezed Steve's fist with the hands on their other side. "You have to watch out for the small cues I give you. It's all about learning my flow, and you adapt to follow. Like when I pull you a little this way-" Tony pulled their hands to the right, and Steve took that to mean he wanted to twist him, so he let himself be led in a circle, and was caught again a moment later. "Perfect! See, you're a natural! You knew exactly what I wanted to do!" Tony praised him.
"Can I help?"
“Stop. Don’t do that.” Steve sternly said.
Anyways, hope y'all liked the short update, I'll have more up soon! Had a bit of writer's block earlier this week but it's getting better.
"15 seconds is a lifetime." Tony muttered under his breath, counting down the seconds. His hands were shaking, Steve surely noticed. Pretending to be friendly with a bunch of armed, confirmed murderers these last two weeks had been easy compared to dancing with the object of all his affections. He tried not to look Steve in the eye as he continued...5...4...3...
"Sorry. I didn't know coffee was your alarm clock."
"Sir? Captain Rogers is once again inquiring if he is able to meet with you."
He made his way behind Williams, who seemed to be the head of the monster. He wanted everyone in the room to see the two opposing views, side by side.
point. Would things be awkward from now on? Would Tony ever trust him again? He just didn’t know how they could keep the team afloat this way.
Tonight...maybe it was the electricity in the air. Maybe Sin City was getting to him. Or maybe his body just needed a hard reset. Whatever it was, he felt his need grow (literally) the longer he laid in bed.
"Yeah." Steve was overwhelmed. He looked around, suddenly nostalgic. Even though it was another stadium, baseball was the same everywhere. He could smell the freshly cut grass, could imagine the fanbase cheering on their team. He saw a couple, decked out in Dodgers gear, taking photos next to statues of players outside the stadium. A young boy ran up to his dad with a baseball from the souvenir store, screaming with glee. Steve looked around, there weren't many people around for a Saturday. "Is there a game today?"
“That’s just it! It wasn’t me. Yes, it was someone with the exact same DNA, same molecular structure, same...everything as me. But it couldn’t possibly have been me. Steve’s never come on to me, and he somehow finds himself in bed with this other guy after 5 minutes?”
"Shit," he really needed to get somewhere with this, so he let out a deep exhale and closed his eyes to clear his mind. He knew what he really wanted. It had been so long since he'd been touched by someone else in more than just a friendly way. He'd never had...well...penetrative sex with anyone, but he remembered the feeling of stolen kisses in changing rooms and fists in his hair when he would get on his knees in the dead of night for lonely soldiers.
He'd leave. But first, he needed to tell Tony he was sorry. For ever coming back.
"Okay. Thank you Jarvis." Steve suddenly remembered that he promised Tony he would follow up with him about learning how to use his phone. He figured that would include texting. So, putting the phone in his pocket, he made his way down to the basement, where Jarvis informed him Tony's lab was located.
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve took the opportunity to stick his tongue down his throat as he thrust forward. Tony moaned into him, and he snapped his hips again, making Tony whine in arousal. Tony’s arms tightened around his neck, he didn’t want their lips to part even for a second. Steve was thrusting into him from both ends, timing his cock and tongue to penetrate Tony at the same time, as deep as he could go.
"This isn't for anything fancy." Steve led them around, looking for something. "It'll be fun, you'll see." Finally, he found it. The men's swimsuit section. "Here!"
“Mmngh…” Steve moaned, bucking his hips up, chasing the friction. He’d never felt like this before - the insatiable need to give himself fully to someone like this. He wanted Tony right now, more than he’d wanted anything in his life. Tony teased him, raising his ass in the air so Steve couldn’t rub against him.
miss you. Every day, I missed you. Not some idea of you. Not Other-Tony.
Monday, after all. The least Steve could do was to run Tony a nice, hot bath, and get his favorite cup of coffee ready. He slowly backed out of Tony’s embrace, replacing himself with a big fluffy pillow to block out the bright light, and was almost able to shuffle off the bed, when an arm shot out and grabbed him.
He supposed he should be grateful - he at least hadn’t been asked to leave the tower yet. Assuming he wouldn’t be kicked to the curb as soon as Tony emerged from wherever he was hiding, he would have to work with the other man again at
Tony. I promise, I’ll even stop reprimanding you. I won’t yell anymore. I’ll leave you alone, if that’s what you want. But we need you here Tony.
"Don't flatter yourself too much. I'm just happy you're feeding me." Steve tried to act cool, but who was he kidding. He'd missed having a friend, having company, missed casual touches and easy conversation. He was ecstatic to see Tony.
from. Every atom, every chemical reaction, every moment in time should be exactly the same. The only difference is that
“Yes I do.” Steve countered. “You’re Tony Stark. I care about you. I just want to make sure my Tony is happy in every universe he’s in.”
Tony. Tony might know what's going on. He didn't seem phased by his episode last night, in fact he seemed to know just what to say to make Steve feel better. Steve quickly jumped in the shower, packed his things and left a huge tip on the nightstand. He stopped by the front desk to apologise once again, then he took his bike and drove for a few minutes, just long enough to pull over somewhere outside town. Then, he called Tony, hoping the man would be up by now.
Steve choked on his coffee. After coughing for a bit, he looked over at Nat, who had on the most serious face.
“Can you and Bucky come back here? After your run?” Steve knew it was selfish, rude even, to kiss and tell. But - these were complicated circumstances, and he could really use the advice of his friends. He knew they wouldn’t judge him too harshly.
"I don't even know what that means."
"It was great. Thank you so much." Steve hesitated when the doors opened to his floor. "Um...well...see you tomorrow. Game and dinner, right?"
"Sir is in his quarters at the end of the hall, the last door to the right." Steve followed the instructions and stopped at the door. Going inside might be too bold. He balanced the tray with one hand and knocked lightly with the other. In response, he heard something fall and some shuffling. Afraid of disturbing something important...or private...he called out through the door.
“That’s the problem.” Steve felt his cheeks heating up. “It...sort of was and wasn’t
Pushing this feeling aside, Steve responded, not wanting to worry Tony.
The illustrations aren't perfect, it's actually much harder to draw naked bods than I thought it would be, but I tried my best, dangit!
"Uggghhh...What the hell." Tony got up and walked back to the elevators. He had no idea what to think anymore. He decided to go get showered and change. Maybe he could distract himself with some bad TV.
“Thank you.” He turned to Tony, hoping to get some sort of response.
“Just want to know how you’re doing is all.” Steve said, completely seriously.
is what SHIELD should have taught me."
the mind reader.” Tony scoffed.
"No." Tony clutched his mug tighter. "No! No. Not weird at all. Why would it be weird? No. Totally fine, I understand. There's nothing to apologize for. It's no big deal between a couple of friends, right?" He put on his best press smile, and seemed to compose himself just fine. Steve was a little relieved that Tony wasn't upset, but also...felt a pang of disappointment. He wasn't sure why. Maybe he'd hoped for some other reaction?
"Why?"
Tony gently set the flowers down on a console next to the door, then turned back and launched himself at Steve. He pulled him in by the collar, their mouths crashing, open and desperate. Tony groaned as he stuck his tongue down Steve's throat, blindly kicking the door closed behind them.
"Sorry guys. They only do dance halls once a week, on Saturdays." Natasha pointed out.
Steve woke up late and feeling groggy. He still had a few loose ends to finish up at SHIELD so he started his day by going into the office. He forced on his best (fake) smile and chatted with the few SHIELD staff he ran into, and they all wished him safe travels on his way out. He stopped at a small bistro, grabbing a late lunch. Everyone inside seemed to be in a great mood, strangers chatting and laughing, and the food was fresh and probably delicious, though he wouldn't know, as he didn't really focus on the taste much while eating it. On his way back to the tower, he picked up a couple things for his trip, some toiletries and a small sketch pad and pencils. The employee at the store was kind and helpful, suggesting specific items and waving him off with a warm "have a great day!" as he left. It should have been a nice, leisurely day - one that usually would have left Steve feeling content, happy even. Instead, it felt like he was just moving on autopilot. He wasn't really registering what he was doing, mostly it felt like he was just waiting for the time when he would be tired enough to be able to go back to sleep.
"Wow. I've got to give your secretary props. She really went all out with the reservation." Tony, who seemed unbothered by the whole thing, was enjoying all the meats and fried snacks that they were offered. Steve would have been mortified at the intimate, surreal atmosphere surrounding them, had he not been having such a good time too.
"Jarvis helped." Steve hadn't turned, putting some finishing touches on Tony's plate. "And the concierge here was kind enough to bring up the ingredients I needed." He triumphantly turned to Tony and slid the plate of pancakes to him, complete with whipped cream, berries and a lit candle on top. "Now make a wish!"
“Tony, I’m not
"Oh! You-should-wear-pants!" Clint tried to formulate his thought, but was struggling to untangle himself from the blankets and couch pillows surrounding him.
“Are we married in this dimension?”
"And it has to be that country?"
"I don't care." Steve smiled, big and bright, just like Nat said. "You might have to teach me though. I don't know how to dance to save my life." Tony seemed convinced then, always up for a challenge, and couldn't help a giddy grin.
"Ew. Fine. But only because you'll hate me for this one." Steve pulled up his pick.
"Isn't he the worst?" Tony leaned on the counter next to Steve, "You have to tell me everything. God, I would've loved to see their faces when they realized you were there."
“What, you read minds now?” Tony grumbled.
Shoot - the other Tony. Friday had been informed to stay out of his way. Hopefully he wouldn’t cause too much trouble over there. But he might appreciate a few notes in return. If Tony knew himself, he’d hate to miss out on some inter-dimensional experiments.
Finally, Tony took Steve's hand, and broke the silence.
“Oh, this is funny to you, Rogers?” Tony tried to remain serious, but Steve was in hysterics now, and Tony’s lips couldn’t help but turn up in delight. Steve was wiping tears from his eyes, and Tony joined in, cackling at hearing Steve let go. They both started coughing when their movement kicked up more dust, and that just made them laugh harder. He hadn’t shared a moment like this - just open and honest laughter - with Steve in a very long time.
Steve had called ahead and made sure that a spread of a little bit of everything would be ready for them. He didn't expect so many different kinds of food though. He marveled at how many colorful dishes sat waiting for them at the restaurant's biggest table.
to win him over by getting a head start on the work the genius was so passionate about. It was just that...well...he was passionate about it too. Helping people, that is. If that just so happened to be an excuse to talk to Tony, to get closer to him, to show that he could keep up intellectually, then that was just an added bonus is all. He breathed out a sigh of relief when the door pad light lit up from red to green upon walking in - he didn't want to imagine being locked away from Tony ever again.
lose you. It was just too much for me to handle. That’s why...I didn’t want you to get too close again. I thought it would only be a matter of time before you'd leave again. That’s why I’ve been pushing you away.”
"Jarvis! Is Tony available to see me by any chance?"
"Alright, yay! Hurray. Good job guys. Let's just not come in tomorrow. Let's just...take a day." Tony wanted to breathe, wanted to make sure he could keep breathing and couldn't stop himself from talking, at himself and at no one in particular. "Have you ever tried shawarma? There's a shawarma joint about two blocks from here. I don't know what it is, but I want to try it." Tony looked over at Steve, who was smiling at him like he'd just made the sun rise. To be fair, he
“Maybe it’s a side effect of Extremis.” She replied, in a serious tone. Tony raised an eyebrow at her until she smiled. “James called from the press conference. Said he was kicking you out and thought you might end up here instead of going home like he told you to.”
“H-HEY!” Sam yelped. Tony had never seen Sam
He was about to ask Jarvis about texting, when the AI made him jump.
universe is left handed, meaning every particle spins in the opposite direction from my right handed universe. And for the most part - that’s been correct. Up until maybe a few years ago. That’s when the divergence happened, and I don’t know why.” He scrubbed his face, and looked up at the confused Steve.
"No! No. I get it. Just like-"
"Yeah, yeah." Tony waved, "but famous spots are for tourists." Right on queue, a couple of waiters brought out an array of salsas and chips, along with a tray of appetizers, a lot of which Steve couldn't recognize. "Now THIS!" Tony gestured to all the food in front of them. "This is good food. Hope you like spicy."
“You’re avoiding my question.” Steve grinned. This Steve was just as infuriating as the one back home too.
"I'm sorry I...I'm not upset with you. I promise. Look, I just came down here to tell you that my...my things are packed Tony. I’m leaving for the compound. I’m so sorry for hurting you. But I’m
feel like I have to walk on eggshells when I'm around you. But it’s not because I'm afraid of you, it's so I don’t scare you away. I just want you to be happy. That's why...if you feel threatened by me, then I need to go, Tony.”
“In th’ mornin’…” Tony murmured as he slipped into a serene sleep. Steve looked around. Well, at least it was a big bed, so he could just shuffle them to the other side and avoid the wet spots. He carefully pushed Tony over, making sure not to wake him. He used one of the rumpled sheets to wipe away any uncomfortable mess leaking out of Tony before settling down himself to get some rest. He figured they would talk in the morning but - how was he supposed to fall back asleep with a beautiful, naked Tony right next to him? Tony must have sensed his trouble, because he groggily reached out for Steve. Steve complied easily, coming closer until he had an arm full of content, napping Tony to hold under his chin.
“What??” Steve stumbled back. “Isn’t...isn’t that a little...soon?” He didn’t want to chase Tony away, Steve Rogers was nothing if not a committed partner, but...surely moving in with Tony in just a week was way too fast, even for him.
“You...uh...you sure about this?” Steve asked again. This was moving fast, like
"I'm pretty sure they know exactly who we are. It's kind of hard to mix up two big celebrities like us, isn't it?" Tony laughed lightheartedly, thankfully taking this very well. "It's probably just the atmosphere of the place, every restaurant has a theme. If you haven't noticed, there's a lot of couples in here, so that's just their shtick. Come on, take a load off. I'm sure the food is worth it. I haven't had Cuban in a long time, and it smells great in here. How'd you find this place?"
“Right. They
Tony laid back and thought about it. He wasn't a stranger to anxiety and panic attacks. Rhodey and Pepper knew about it, and he hated when they would fuss over him, try to over-analyze him or wouldn't leave him alone for days. But he loved knowing that they cared. After years of it, they knew now when it was important to come see Tony in person, but often they would check in with him via calls or text, and that was perfect for Tony. Exactly the right amount of care, without smothering him. He needed to do the same for Steve. As much as he wanted to help, he couldn't take over his life. He'd need to give him space, while still being there for him.
“But everyone-”
studied the supersoldier serum, after all - and thank goodness for that - he wouldn’t have to waste even a second to explain. So he pulled out and flipped Tony around onto his stomach, eager to make him feel good.
“Christine.” Tony’s voice was a godsend. He appeared out of nowhere, prompting the handsy reporter to back away, finally letting go of Steve. The vice around his lungs snapped open, and he could breathe again.
Halfway through the movie, Steve was, predictably, growing bored of the story plot. He turned his attention back to Tony, who was now looking through blueprints for the reactor plant on his screen, tweaking numbers left and right, as if he had a calculator in his head. Steve couldn't help but stare for a minute.
"Thought you might get inspired." Tony walked over to a bench and sat down. "Take all the time you want." Steve smiled and sat next to Tony. Every inch of this place was an artistic gold mine, so he really didn't mind facing the statue of the Drunken Satyr, he felt safe and happy next to Tony. They sat for a while, silent, comfortable with just each other's company - Steve drawing a few statues and flowers while Tony watched. When Steve was satisfied, they moved to another bench, and eventually they'd toured the entire building, and Steve had already filled up half the pages with rough sketches.
"Excuses, excuses." Steve teased.
"You want something in your hungry little mouth don't you? You love sucking on me when you come, don't you baby? Here-" Tony moved one leg up and over, on top of Steve's hip so he could keep his leverage as he fucked Steve's ass with one hand, and placed a couple fingers in Steve's mouth with the other hand. Steve immediately sucked, moaning when he felt the finger pads against his tongue. He loved this, feeling Tony all over him, inside both of his holes. Tony kept up the jackhammer pace, pushing in faster and faster until Steve's cock was leaking. Like a punch to the gut, Steve threw his head back, Tony's fingers slipping out of his mouth, and screamed. He felt so full of pleasure, so full of-
Funny enough, they met in the middle, right on the open dance floor. A slow, but upbeat song came on. Fuck.
At least, that's what Tony kept telling himself as he lugged Steve's bike into his lab and initiated lockdown mode.
"Nothing...You uh, you look...nice....today. Your, um...hair? Yeah, your hair. It looks...nice." Steve was fidgeting with his hands.
“It’s not rocket science, Tony.” Steve responded, and was pleased when Tony broke into a fit of giggles next to him at that. “There’s no right thing to say. I
"Sorry," Tony loudly mock-whispered over to him once he sat down. "Rhodey got to pick the movie today, since he doesn't come by often enough, which is his
The next couple hours were a blast. After looking around the stadium itself, they headed straight to the Club level to look at all the most important gear, jerseys, and home plates from over the years. Tony explained special games to him, and though Steve had missed it all in his years in the ice, he felt happy hearing all about the team's great accomplishments. They went into the clubhouse, where they saw the team's locker room, and got to play in the batting cages for a while. They took some funny photos of each other decked out in player gear, and Steve made Tony bend over in laughter as he picked up an entire kettle bell rack, saying maybe he should be a baseball player too. They went into the field, taking a ball and a couple of mitts from the fan store on the way, and true to his word, Tony played catch with Steve for a while as they talked about the Dodger's record, going into detail on the biggest wins and losses. Tony insisted that Steve take a picture sliding into home base, and Steve tried to pose without getting dirt all over his pants, which wasn't successful but he couldn't have cared less. From there, they eagerly ran to the dugout when a worker came out and announced that he had some hot dogs waiting for them.
"No! It's...there's nothing wrong. Please don't go."
"Anybody can be good. Maybe they need a push in the right direction." Steve pleaded, "Let me try? Didn't you say they have a meeting tomorrow? I can go and try to reason with them."
in front of a bunch of asshole drug peddling murderers who are probably homophobic on top of that."
"Mmmm...why didn't you tell me this place was so good?" Tony teased.
"You don't understand..." Tony threw his face into his hands and groaned. How could he let this happen? He'd gone and ruined the whole weekend, all because he couldn't control himself when it came time to say goodbye.
"Fuck." Steve hadn't moved. "It really would've been something to be there for that, huh?"
“It’s not the military, Pep.” He chuckled. “But...maybe you’re right.”
“Yeah, you
Tony.
“Captain America
looking Captain, wearing a dark five piece suit that hugged in all the right places. He was holding an enormous blooming bouquet of pink and red lilies.
"Hey Steve, we saved you a spot!" Pepper smiled from a recliner, motioning with her head over to the loveseat. Of course the only space left would be next to Tony. Steve made his way over, careful with the bag he was carrying, setting it down right next to his legs on the rug.
“Oh, don’t give me that. You used to talk about him all the time, Tony. Even while we were dating.” Tony visibly cringed at that. “It’s okay.” Pepper chuckled. “I’d have to be blind to miss how much of a crush you had on him, even back then. You guys used to talk all the time, go out to lunch together, hang out together. You were the perfect pair. What about that one time at Clint’s?”
“No.” He plainly answered as he closed his phone screen and pocketed it. He swallowed, the thick lump in his throat felt like it was going to choke him. Steve contemplated how he was going to tell Tony what all had happened last night.
“Tony, what are you talking about?
Soon, Jarvis let him know that Steve was at the door, requesting permission to enter. Tony denied access. He didn't want to argue right now. Steve obviously didn't know what was best for him, so Tony would just have to work even harder to make sure he was safe while he was out gallivanting across the country.
"Stop thinking so loudly, would you?" Steve's beautiful eyes crinkled in amusement. Tony chuckled.
"Shit, hold on, there's a car driving by. Waiting on the street to clear. Just stay on the dance floor a little longer," Nat buzzed in to their ears. "Extraction team will enter in 15 seconds. Can you two be slightly more convincing for that long, please?"
"Steve! Where the hell were you? You missed a crazy game, Ramirez practically handed your guys the big win in the 12th inning! It was amazi- wait who is that behind you?" Clint and Natasha walked in, and the archer just now realized what Nat was already seeing. Tony poked his head up from behind Steve's broad shoulders and smiled.
"Oh god no! I mean, t-thank you ma'am." Steve sputtered out. "It's just, this really isn't my cup of tea. I'll always help in any way I can, but I was just...doing it as a favor."
“No! You know what I mean.” Steve let out a frustrated sound, and Tony smirked, to let him know he was just messing with him. “God you’re so... I’m just-I’m trying to say something meaningful here, Stark.” Steve huffed, but smiled back, and kept going. “You’re unceremoniously, unapologetically honest about yourself, and about everything you do, and I admire that, so much more than you’ll ever know. We all do.
"Sounds like he's either really dense, or wanted to kiss you and chickened out. I'm sure you're making this way bigger in your head than it really is, knucklehead." Tony tried to think back to that moment, but just then his phone dinged.
(See the end of the chapter for
to. For Steve.
Steve nodded.
"Want to dance?" He put down his finished drink and held out a hand to Tony. Tony's smile turned to shock as he turned to look at him.
to try.”
Tony huffed over to the elevator, and as soon as the doors closed, Steve swung around to Natasha.
"I don't want anyone else, baby." Tony let out a tiny whimper at hearing the pet name being used for him. "You know the only reason I let him touch me, was because I thought it was you, right? Since I met you, I haven't wanted anyone else. You're it for me, Tony."
say where he was, Rhodey assured him that he was fine.
"For shame, Cap." Tony wagged his finger at him. "But don't fret. I'll get you connected to the rest of the world in no time. Jarvis? Would you set Steve up with a Stark email and make accounts for a couple major apps - whatever you think he'll like. Set default passwords for now and help him change those once he gets back to his room."
"If it's about meeting people, I know all the right people. I'll introduce you to
“Alright. Let's head out.”
"Oh!" Of course that's what she meant. "Yes. It's great, I really enjoy living there, actually. Having everyone around has been very good for me, I think. Tony hasn't made me uncomfortable at all,"
“Really? That’s great news!” Tony exclaimed. “The Steve over there was so sad, honey! I couldn’t stand it!”
"He's been waiting on
"So some people will try to teach you by counting the beats or telling you where to move your feet. That's a load of crap. Dancing is all about your hips, and the rest will follow. Don't worry about where you step, right now we'll just move backwards and forward like this." Tony placed his hand on top of Steve's, pushing it against his hip. Steve took a deep, slow breath, in and out, sure to keep his groin as far away from Tony as possible. Wow, maybe this was a terrible idea. "You feel that? Just moving with the rhythm, and when my hips sway like that, my torso and legs naturally move with them. Getting it?"
“F-FRIDAY?” Tony looked scared. “What are you...what are you doing in the mainframe?” He turned his rage back to Steve. “What did you do with Jarvis!?”
“That’s not...that was never it Steve.” He said. It looked like he was mustering up all his courage to speak his truth. “I don’t care that you bug me about stuff. In fact - I really...it helps. It keeps me grounded. I like knowing you care.” He took a deep breath. “It’s when you stop. That’s what bothers me. When you forget about me, and go back to your own friends, and your own life. That’s when it hurts.”
"I promise I'll be safe. And I'll send you pictures so you know I'm doing fine." Steve thought back to what Natasha had said. Tony was amazing, doing his best to take care of Steve, even when he would be hundreds of miles away, so the least he could do was to assure him that he would take care of himself.
"Hm.." Natasha drank some of her coffee. "Did you tell him at any point that you like men?"
he could almost hear her say.
“Oh, come on.” Tony puffed his cheeks in annoyance, and Steve laughed, squeezing his shoulder.
"I'm so happy that you're here." He whispered. Tony snored softly in response, and Steve felt more at home than he had in a long, long time. The comfortable new position quickly lulled him back into a deep sleep.
"Sorry. To be honest I've only used it for calling." Steve rubbed the back of his neck. "I did learn how to see my contacts so I can call them without having to punch in their whole phone numbers each time. But that's about it."
"Hear...you." He took a long breath in, and out. He opened his eyes, not sure when exactly he'd closed them. He saw the light again. The little light he'd seen earlier, it was his phone on the stand.
"Thanks by the way. For all this." Tony had crossed his arms and was leaning his chair back, trying to act indifferent. Steve knew better though, his Shellhead was opening up to them, even if it was just a little. He was so proud of the man for accepting the help.
"I know what a TV is, Tony." Steve shook his head, but walked over and sat down anyways. "It's weird though. The TV's here are different than the ones at my old SHIELD apartment. I can't figure out how to switch channels."
Images of their day together flashed in his mind. He loved seeing Steve happy. And yes, maybe it was self-destructive to let himself get so close to someone like this - someone brave and handsome and sweet, funny, sensitive...but Steve deserved the very best. Tony would make sure that Steve was happy as much as possible, even if it was from the sidelines. Tony chuckled to himself, this must be what it's like for Rhodes and Pep. God, it was exhausting. He'd have to remember to get them some 'just because' gift baskets when he got home.
Steve sat, but couldn’t look them in the eye. He shuffled a few boxes of food around in front of him, then took a napkin and cleaned a wet spot on the table. He sighed as he struggled to figure out where to begin.
It was obvious to him, since his trip, that he craved touch. At first, he thought it was a side effect of missing his friends. Bucky used to touch him a lot. Whether it was hugs, or an arm over his shoulders during casual conversation, or even just squishing up against the other Commandos in a tiny bar or on a plane headed to the Western front. Now though, he realized he had friends who touched him just as much. Natasha would always find a reason to stay nearby, sometimes patting him on the arm for a job well done, or leaning back to back after sparring. Clint liked to roughhouse, often fighting others for the TV remote, gladly trying to put Steve in a headlock, even if he knew he didn't stand a chance. Thor would hug. A LOT. He could lift anyone off their feet and hold them in a bear hug for hours, if you let him. Even Bruce and Pepper, though rarely, reached out once in a while.
"Come on, don't sit babe, you'll get dough all over the couch cushions." Steve was pulling Tony's shirt off, making sure to avoid the new decorations hanging on the penthouse walls; photos of their last month of travel and dates, filled with kisses and big smiles. They had decided to take a few weeks to finish Steve's tour of the country, together.
"Uh." Tony gaped eloquently. It couldn't have been more than half an hour since he'd left the rooftop. Steve held the flowers out to him, and Tony found himself blushing, hard, as he gingerly took them. "For me?" He weakly asked, at a loss for anything else to say.
He'd been on the other side of the room all night, talking to Rhodey. Steve knew this because he couldn't stop himself from glancing over every few minutes. It felt like they caught each other's eye more than a couple times over the course of the evening. Steve wondered if Tony noticed the heavy weight of anticipation in the air too. All of Tony's favorite songs had already played, but he hadn't moved, strange for someone who loved to dance at every opportunity he could get, especially with friends.
, go ask Stark to dance. He's been ogling you practically all night." Sam took the beer out of Steve's hand and patted his shoulder. "You got this."
"You...you really like that, don't you sweetie?" Tony flexed his fingers in Steve's hair, and Steve's cock jolted up again at that.
He looked at his phone and realized it was Sunday anyways. Wow, he'd really lost track of his days. That meant everyone should be in the tower today, usually Sundays was the team's lazy day and no one wanted to go out. He decided to go down to the communal kitchen, sure that someone would be there making breakfast. When he walked out to his living room, he was pleased to find that someone had indeed brought up his things, and so he fetched everyone's presents, hoping to find them all soon and say hi, as he'd gotten in too late yesterday to run into anyone but Tony.
Steve jumped and dropped his phone. Thankfully it landed in a patch of grass, so he picked it up and dusted it off. He was trying to get used to Jarvis. The AI would often help him navigate, and would answer Steve's inquiries for suggestions and recommendations. But when Jarvis spoke unprovoked, it was a little jarring.
Wait. He could find out.
"What do you want, baby? Tell me, I'll do anything." Tony bent over him, whispering into Steve's ear. He shivered, he knew exactly what he wanted.
is everything oka-MMPH!" Steve grabbed the smaller man who had jumped into his arms and was now kissing him passionately. An electric current ran up Steve's spine, and he was kissing back immediately.
"That's too bad." Steve sounded dejected. His face looked like he'd just watched a puppy cry. Well, Tony wouldn't let
"Uh…" Steve looked around, though he didn't know what in the world he was looking for. "I haven't exactly been down here in...a few years."
“Great. Lets do a 20 minute run of all visible light over here. Note a baseline of 0.2.”
"Yes. Pepper will take care of that, mostly, but I'm prepped in case I need to be."
"Is there anyone who would not like to yield their time?" Her icy stare was directed at Williams, who stared right back, but didn't dare speak up.
"Okay." Tony smiled to himself.
? But Natasha said she thinks I have a shot...Wait! Natasha! She said I could ask her for help!
“What are you to Tony? Is he your boyfriend? Your booty call? What? You’re obviously not married to him.”
"Sure. I'll talk to him " Steve decided she was right. It would be a shame to leave without setting things right with his new friend.
“You really are Steve. Or some version of him anyways. Only Stevie could get
"So. What's this I hear about you having a jet in every major city?"
"Is that okay?" Steve looked at Tony, and wasn't sure what exactly he was asking. But Tony was giving him a look like their entire friendship hinged on his response, and Steve knew he wouldn't want Tony any other way.
That's when Tony caressed his back, running feather light fingers over his spine in the most delicate, loving way, and Steve lost it. He groaned loudly into Tony's mouth, cumming hard, desperately even, deep inside him. He saw stars as Tony kept squeezing around him, almost milking him.
Steve cut him off with a bellowing laugh. Tony blinked at him in surprise.
“Aw, I was trying to be quiet. Did I wake you up?”
"Whoa!! You got us box seats to the Mets games?!" Clint's eyes lit up in excitement.
“Did you seriously forget about the press conference today?” Nat carefully hung up the garment bag in his closet. “The tailor was expecting you to pick this up yesterday - you’re lucky I happened to stop by to grab my dress.”
“Uh, yeah.” Steve cleared his throat. He hadn’t listened to anything she’d just said. “That’s...amazing.”
"Ah." Tony took a few chips in his hands, and started waving one to his left. "See down there? Chinatown, right down the street. Right here's a bunch of Mexican and Central American places, and over there to that side, little Tokyo. That's why I love LA, NYC, big cities like that. It's a melting pot." He punctuated his statement my stuffing a couple chips in his mouth. "Not everywhere's like that though." He munched, "But I'll show you a good time today, you won't regret it!"
Steve had never been more glad to sit through an hour long presentation on corporate tax deductions in his life.
“You never
on the floor, is what you were gonna do!” Sam reprimanded him, but opened his mouth when Bucky offered him a potsticker in apology. “You look better.” He said to Steve as he shoved Bucky onto a seat at the table. He motioned for Steve to join them. “What was wrong?”
"Well, how much does old Thunder Thighs there weigh, then?" Clint joined in on the conversation.
Steve thought, "In fact he's been a big help to me. Getting adjusted to the year 2012 and all."
"Looks like you'll have to blast me in the butt then."
“Tony, I’m so sorry that I made you feel this way.” Steve ran a big hand down the back of his neck, and Tony choked out an involuntary sob. It was so warm and wonderful, and he never wanted him to stop. “I’m so sorry for leaving. I
"It's a StarkPhone, you can make calls on it, though it does way more than that. But yes, all yours, Cap. Don't think of losing it either - it's not like the ones you can buy just anywhere. Of course, you'll need to learn how to use it before you leave. Play with it for now, Jarvis will let you know if you're about to accidentally post a nude to Twitter or something. I'll teach you the important stuff next week when the rebuild settles down a little."
Tony eyed him, cautiously. With a light blush on his ears, he swiped away all the other holograms, leaving only the map of Tajikistan behind.
Steve knew about inflation and just how much prices had changed since the 40's, but still. Even looking at the price tags of the clothes at this mall was making him feel guilty, even if Tony was footing the bill. He couldn't imagine how much more clothes might cost somewhere that Tony Stark - billionaire - considered 'real stores.'
It was quiet now. And cold. And the smell of sex was gone.
They stood there for another minute before Steve couldn't take the silence anymore.
"Yeah. Right here."
"It won't be easy..." Tony blushed a bit, enough for Steve to notice. Just then, it clicked. Steve remembered what Pepper told him on their lunch. Tony was used to people letting him down. Used to being forgotten or outright betrayed by friends and colleagues. It would be natural for him to try to protect himself from heartache by buying his way out of problems rather than seeking help from those closest to him. Well, that would change right now.
"So...kids. Is that what you wanted? With Aunt Peggy? Is that what you want now?" Tony asked him during the 7th inning stretch.
the one who finally reached back out to Steve and the others, to ask them to come back, even at the expense of your own pride. None of this would have happened without you. I’m sure he knows that, and appreciates you.”
"Yeah. That's such good news about the vote, I'm happy for you. I'm glad they all did the right thing."
"Someone at SHIELD recommended it..." It technically wasn't a lie. He was mentally kicking himself, he should've checked the place out before letting Natasha convince him to come here. Steve warily sat down, trying to make himself as small as possible so he wouldn't push right up against Tony's side. It would've been cozy, if it wasn't so utterly nerve-racking.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Can't you just show up anyways? It's your company, after all."
"Just let him coddle you. He'll be happy if you just promise to be safe and call once in a while." Natasha pointed out.
By the time he got back to the tower, it was early evening. He'd managed to spend the whole day not really thinking about anything, but now that he was back, he realized that he needed to finish packing, as he was leaving tomorrow morning.
“Nonsense.” Tony waved with one hand as he pushed hangers out of the way with the other. “These contractors are the best. Hand-picked. I wouldn’t be surprised if they’re done by the end of the week.”
He turned to look at Tony, deciding to end this torment once and for all. He started marching right over to the other man. Tony must have noticed, because he handed Rhodes his bottle of water, resolutely matching Steve's stride towards him.
"Mhm. Y-yeah." Steve tried not to look Tony in the eyes. For some reason, it felt like if he looked there, his secret would be out. But looking down wasn't much better. Tony's forearm was rigid, working to balance his weight, muscles flexing and - fuck. Steve felt stupefied, didn't even know where to look or what to say.
but it's just not necessary. I can pay to have it done."
"My song!" He exclaimed, and turned Steve around abruptly to start dancing with him, abandoning their quest for their group altogether. Steve didn't mind. He gladly turned Tony in a spin too, catching him by the hand again, and twisting his hips to the beat.
Steve was really enjoying the atmosphere and time with his friends. Tony didn't mind that he would hang around, asking questions, lingering in his space when conversation was slow, and he liked that most of all. Steve had been considering their relationship...or lack thereof, for the last couple of days. Ever since that morning, waking up in Tony's bed, Steve had a burning need to touch the other man again. He did his best to control himself though, only allowing himself a few small gestures when his desire got too overwhelming. He'd pat Tony on the back, or put a hand on his shoulder, or sit close enough for their thighs to barely touch on the couch. But Steve didn't know how much more he could take, he was aching to hold the other man close again, having gotten a small taste of what that could be like, and not being able to get it out of his head.
"Sit still. You're giving me hives." Tony demanded.
"Let me show you." Steve pulled his phone back to send a picture, and heard Tony's phone buzz on the other end when he got back on the call.
Steve turned around to see Pepper running up to him. He'd spent some time shaking hands with some of the board members after the meeting, sincerely thanking them for their time. His suspicions were correct - some of these people weren't so bad, they had just lost sight of what was important, and needed someone to guilt them into doing the right thing.
how you feel." Steve made a whining sound and slumped down in his seat. "What? Big brave Captain America too scared to talk about feelings?"
"Glad to hear it." Tony scrunched up his nose at the Mets hat. "I could never be a Mets fan. Hey, Birdbrain, heads up!" He yelled right before throwing the other hat at Clint.
“Um, I don’t know if this is related, but Other-Tony mentioned something about infinity stones when he was here. He said we should speak to someone named Dr. Strange on Bleecker Street who could explain it all to us, and could get us in touch with Thor.” Steve went red with embarrassment. “Sheesh. I got so caught up in all the other stuff...I guess I forgot to mention it before. We should head over there right away, Thor might need our help.”
"Of course not, Spangles." Tony smiled, "I'm not entirely useless in the kitchen, I'll have you know."
likes those. I'm putting them in the 'buy' pile."
"Yes Tony, don't worry. I'll settle in. You go keep saving New York." Steve smiled up at the pacing man, tapping away at his phone as always when he suddenly changed course for the door.
"T-tony I don't t-think I'll last m-much..." He trailed off as Tony sucked on the skin right inside his thighs. He kissed, further until he was settled between his legs, then, with a naughty grin, licked a wet stripe right up Steve's twitching cock. He took the head in his mouth, tongue playing with his frenulum. Steve quietly gasped, spreading his legs open wider without even realizing it. Only a moment later, Tony was taking him all the way in, holding his hips down with both hands, that way Steve wouldn't be able to thrust up and Tony could set his own, excruciatingly slow pace. It was too much, Steve was used to cumming twice, sometimes even three times back to back. He usually never spent this much time between orgasms, being slow or thorough. He was so keyed up, he could feel everything like his senses were heightened, every inch of his cock screaming in joy in Tony's warm, wet mouth. Tony slowly circled his cock with his tongue, lapping his way up to the head before sucking him hard, taking him deeper, then pulling back off and starting over. Steve was in euphoria, body writhing in pleasure.
"Earlyyy...." Steve chuckled, yeah. He supposed they did stay up pretty late last night and he was only fine because he didn't need as much sleep, being a supersoldier.
(See the end of the chapter for
mind you, have anything to do with a certain star-spangled supersoldier?” Pepper asked.
A few people looked away. Steve knew that deep down, most people are good. When given the chance and an encouraging environment, most people will make the right choice. This, unfortunately, was an echo chamber. These people were feeding off each other's greed, and saw no other way forward, so it was important to break the cycle now.

“I miss us too.” Tony replied. He waited a moment before continuing. “But you have to hear me out. You’re….you’re

"...okay."
He took his time that day, pulling over often to sketch scenery and admire the views. When he was finally closing in on the city early that afternoon, he hit a wall of traffic. He saw a sign that said 'Big Bear Lake' at the next exit, and decided to veer in that direction. Jarvis said it wasn't too far out of the way, and a good place to have dinner, sketch and spend the night.
music playing now. Were his thoughts somehow manifesting into reality? He looked up and saw a band had set up at the front of the restaurant at some point during their dinner. How had he missed that? They were playing a slow, rhythmic beat filled with guitar notes and drums. It reminded him of the jazz he'd heard in New Orleans but...different. With flowy strings and light percussion instead of woodwind instruments.
he thought.
"I'll miss you." As the words came out, he thought back to the day he left the tower. It didn't hurt this much back then, to say goodbye.
"Sir?" Jarvis spoke, "I just thought you'd like to know that all of Captain Roger's passwords have been updated and saved. He would like for me to relay a thank you once again for your assistance."
They had breakfast, watched TV, and the morning crawled by, with no sign of Tony. Finally, it was time to leave for the last game. Steve was nervously re-reading last night's texts on the couch when Tony walked in.
Tony unbuckled Steve's belt, unpopped his buttons, unzipped his pants torturously slowly. Steve almost regretted wearing so much clothes. At least Tony was letting him caress every inch of his stunning figure in the meantime. Steve relished the feeling of Tony’s warm body under his roaming touch. He hissed when Tony finally pulled his pants down, the cold air hitting him, making his cock leak.
"I'm so tired of doing laundry." Steve grumbled, but picked them both up from the bed, heading to the bathroom to wash up. "Maybe we should go down to my old bed and sleep there tonight."
After a few seconds though, something was off. It was too quiet...he opened his eyes and looked up, Tony staring down at him with a shocked expression, unmoving. He hadn't even taken his fingers out yet.
"Oh." Steve looked down at Tony, who was looking back up at him, resting his head on his hip, having long ago given up on posture. "Guess...we missed the movie huh?" Steve sheepishly gave Tony a lopsided smile.
Steve didn't know what she meant by that, but was too afraid to ask, lest he give himself away.
It seemed Tony let them stay after all, because Natasha only made him go to a few more stores for 'accessories' (he didn't know why he would need more than one pair of sunglasses or
That proved it then. This Other-Tony must be a completely different person. Maybe they

"Yeah. There was...a moment. We were talking about something, I don't really remember what. But he looked out at the sunset and all I could see was the sun shining in his eyes. They were gorgeous. Like specks of gold floating in the ocean." He looked up at Steve again and smiled. "You have the same eyes, you know."

“You were
“That’s not why-”
"Hey, Stark's finally up! You guys ready to go?" Clint announced.
Steve put his phone away. It was still very early in the morning and it was a sure bet that Tony wasn't up yet. He'd been texting photos of his trip to Tony every couple of days. At first, it was just to keep him updated, so he'd know he was safe. But now, he would look forward to talking to someone he knew, even if it was only a couple texts.
“He didn’t always hate me.” Steve thought back to better days. “We used to be really close. And I tried to ask him, to talk to him - but before I could even wake up all the way, he was in my lap and then….it all just happened I guess. I thought we would talk about it in the morning, but that’s when we found out he was...not really Tony.”
"Hey. I was wondering." Tony asked as Steve opened the door for them. "Was this some kind of beta test?"

to get out there, this DJ is on fire and there's no one else here." Tony turned on the charm, batting his eyes with a pout, "Please? Be my dance partner?"
"They hardly qualify as a school." Tony grabbed the shorts. "You get a pass. Only because I'm posting a picture of you on my Instagram for my 1.2 million followers to enjoy." Steve did know all about Tony's MIT pride, and even in the 40's, big colleges had rivalries. So, to his delight, he was excited when Jarvis quietly informed him that MIT's rival university was right here in California, and finding school gear in LA was all too easy. They checked out and went back to their rooms, having way too much fun modeling for Jarvis as he took pictures of them in their new gear. They eventually settled into the hot tub, which was a relaxing way to spend the rest of their morning. As they chatted about nothing, Steve tried to keep his eyes to himself. He'd seen pictures of Tony's reactor in his SHIELD profile, but had never seen it up close. It looked a lot more...alive in person.

about it, almost as if he was showing him off to his friends. Tony went hot with adoration at his dorky boyfriend.
“It’s not a competition.” Steve ran a hand against Tony’s cheek. Tony leaned into it, and smiled up at him.
"Feel bad?" Steve was confused.
"Oh." Steve thought that working on a bike wouldn't warrant privacy, but it was Tony's home after all, so he had a right to privacy anytime he wanted. Or maybe Tony was still upset with him. "Whenever it's next convenient, could you please let him know that I'd like to see him?"
"Hm?" Tony looked at him curiously.
When Laura asked how they slept the next morning at breakfast, Steve cheerfully answered that they'd slept well, while Tony stabbed the sausage on his plate with his fork.
"Tomorrow. Do you have anything planned? I want to return the favor. We'll celebrate your birthday tomorrow, all on me." Steve took both of Tony's hands and turned him so he could look him in the eye. "I won't even wake you up before 11. And there'll be cake. You gotta let me! Please?" He tried his best puppy eyes and Tony laughed, pushing his face away.
The sun was just starting to peek out when he heard the elevator doors open behind him. Shit, who could be up here? They would have to go through the penthouse levels to reach the observatory - so either they had access or Jarvis didn’t feel it was necessary to give him a heads up for some reason.
"Did he now?" Natasha looked at Steve, who was currently staring at Tony again. The shorter man had turned back around, towards the stove, and was stretching an arm up to the top of the upper cabinets, reaching for a big bowl. His apron, tied tightly around his waist, emphasized his curvy figure even more.
"As tacky as this place is," Steve looked over at Tony and smiled, that stunning smile that made Tony's heart skip a beat, and let him know he was just poking fun at him, "It's definitely a step up from SHIELD's apartments. Current mess notwithstanding of course. You sure you won't mind, Tony?"
"If you think that's great," Tony said as he pulled a pile of desserts over to their table. "You should have it straight from the motherland. I'll bring some ingredients back for you when I go. I'm hoping to be just a few hours north of India in a few months, if all goes well with work."
?" Tony hissed at the mic tucked under his collar.
"It's okay. We don't uh...we haven't really talked anything through yet." Tony looked at Steve, and Steve pulled him closer.
Tony.
Steve had never watched baseball like this. The luxury suite was incredible. Full of food, drinks, a full kitchenette, big TV's mounted in every corner so you wouldn't miss a single play. Private bathrooms, large couches and sectionals, it kind of felt like a big living room. One end of the area was facing the field, with an excellent view. It was the bottom of the fourth, and the game hit a lull, Dodgers leading by a wide margin, Steve was relieved, he would've been crushed if the team had played badly his first time watching after coming out of the ice.
"Right. No big deal." He looked down at his watch. It was getting late and he should really head down soon. "So, how do I look?" He turned in a circle, showing Tony his suit. "It's one of the suits Nat helped me get. Is it okay, you think?"
"We'll talk tonight. On our date." He smiled.
He quickly sat up, and then felt light-headed and clutched his temples for a second.
“No. Don’t worry. It won’t hurt.” Tony smiled, staring right through him, considering something for a moment. “You know, you really are just like my Steve. I wonder why everything is so different here. It’s not an anomaly at the atomic level - that’s impossible. Every atom in this dimension is the same as every atom in mine. So that means it’s something else that set everything off course.” He studied Steve’s face thoughtfully. “Tell me, how did you and your Tony meet?”
"No. Absolutely not. He could freak out and never speak to me again!"
They walked up the steps. Tony was waving at the crowd, handsome as always in a dark, perfectly fitted suit. He was smiling - but Steve couldn’t see his eyes behind the dark sunglasses he wore. He wondered what he would see in those eyes if he got the chance. They all started to take their seats - and of course Captain America’s nameplate was next to Ironman’s. Steve’s jaw became tense as Tony made his way over to sit next to him. Tony pulled his chair a few inches away before casually plopping down.
“Maybe in your deluded head.” Bucky picked up the TV remote and started to flip through channels. “From what I’ve seen, you always blow up at each other. I bet if you really tried to be nice for once, he would be nice to you too.”
“Right, ‘Hero’ work. Nice to see you still think so highly of yourself.” Christine replied sarcastically. “Call me, Steve.” She winked and turned away.
"It means," Jarvis said in a mischievous tone, "That weaving in and out of slow or stopped traffic is perfectly acceptable. Please do be careful, Captain."
"You think?"
He slumped down, body heavy, catching his breath. He tried to hold on to the sounds of Tony's voice, the feeling of his body, but that all slipped away, and soon all he had left was a hazy memory of a dream.
a fucking team.”
Steve stared, shocked. "That's only two years after I went down."
They watched some highlight videos on Tony's phone on their way to the next destination. Tony sat close to Steve, his head resting on Steve's shoulder as he clicked through Youtube, watching home run compilations. Steve tried to pay attention to the videos, but this easy companionship with Tony was so warm and distracting. He sat perfectly still, not wanting to break the fragile atmosphere, and tried to keep his eyes on Tony's phone. The ride was over way too soon. When they stopped, they stepped out  next to a hill with stairs. At the top of the stairs, they got to a beautiful building decorated in white marble pillars, a garden surrounding a pool, and Roman statues scattered throughout.
"A list? Sounds ominous."
He'd been to combat strategy meetings during the war that were less tense than this. For the time being, all the yelling wasn't being directed at him, which would be comforting if not for the fact that they were dragging Tony Stark's name through the mud in the process. Williams was the worst of all.
Happy Holidays!
"No!" Tony quickly deflected his fear, "God, no, you aren't going crazy. It happens sometimes to some people. I guess you guys hadn't really diagnosed that kind of stuff back then, or maybe you haven't seen it happen in person before. You've been through a lot recently, Steve. Honestly I'm surprised it hasn't happened to you before."
Tony glared at him, arms crossed and puffing up his chest right back. After a stare-down, Tony finally seemed to have given in.
Tony quietly placed the bag and his phone down, then scrambled over to Steve, throwing both arms around his neck, giving him a big hug. Steve wrapped his arms under Tony's, squeezing back, not caring if anyone saw. He only had a second to turn into Tony's hair and take one deep, intoxicating breath before the other man pulled back, grabbing his phone again, settling back against Steve's arm.
The soldier ran his fingers through his hair, until eventually he went limp next to him. When Tony looked up again, Steve’s eyes were closed, his neck bent uncomfortably to his side, but even so, he was beaming with delight. Tony pulled over a pillow and shoved it under Steve’s weary head, and Steve looked content even when he started to snore softly. Tony’s mind was unusually quiet and calm, so he draped a blanket over them, and fell asleep in Steve’s hold soon after.
"I said, goodnight Tony." Natasha smiled.
Steve waited for Jarvis to answer. It had almost been a full minute, and he was about to ask again, thinking that maybe something was wrong with the AI, when he finally heard back.
Look, there's going to be technical stuff in this chapter, but it's not all that important. It's just to feed into the plot. Again, don't think too hard :)
"Captain Rogers is nothing if not resilient, Sir. I believe he trusts your judgement."
"What the hell is
"The Mets?" Steve gave Tony a curious look while everyone else started clearing their weekend for the outing. "That's the new team around here, isn't it?"
"They're happy to come along. And Fury already approved their time. Plus, he's dedicating a group of SHIELD agents to send with us. I already told you, it's taken care of."
"Are you sure? You don't need to just for me. What if someone recognizes you? You wouldn't be mad if someone took a picture of you dancing with a
“I’m right?” Pepper’s eyebrows shot up.
Sure, he still had a long way to go before finishing the trip he'd planned. Ideally, he wanted to continue up to Canada, and then make his way back down, touring the Northernmost states before ending up back to New York. But he'd set off on this journey because he wanted to find a reason to live. He had friends and a sense of purpose back in 1945. With all that gone, he needed to make his own way in this new world. But he'd been away long enough - he knew where he wanted to be, and knew where his friends and purpose were now.
"Yeah. With the Avengers." Tony nodded, so Steve continued. "Then, after defeating him, we all parted ways for a few months. Tony came back to each of us to ask us to move into the tower, which we did. We stayed there for a few years, mostly working jobs for SHIELD, and-"
"Anyways, he caught me staring. I couldn’t play it off. I just..told him. That his eyes were beautiful. He blushed like you are right now.” He laughed. “And, I just went for it. I don’t know why I did. I must’ve lost it! He didn’t exactly kiss back, but he didn’t pull away either.  Nothing else happened that night. I apologized but he said it was fine. I told him he could stay in my guest bedroom since the bed was already made, if he was comfortable with it, and he did. He got his stuff in the next day, same as you, and moved down to his apartment. But he came back up to my penthouse a few nights later and said he couldn’t sleep. I asked if he wanted to stay in the guest bedroom again, but, well.” Tony waved a hand in the air like that would explain it all. “We ended up sharing my bed instead. Things became serious a few weeks later, and we got married the year after. We’ve been married almost three years now. The penthouse is getting a...another few rooms added, which is why I went straight into your bedroom when I woke up here last night - we’re staying in your old apartment until the contractors finish the additions. This was our first day in your room - I thought I had just forgotten what the room looked like. I hadn’t been down there since before we got married."
It's a rocky road out there, indeed. I hope everyone reading this is safe, and can find a moment to breathe today.
“I can’t believe how irresponsible you’re being right now. You have people living here who-”
Steve let him go, getting back up. He watched as Tony mulled it over, sitting perfectly still. After a minute he was about to ask if everything was okay, when the genius jumped up with wide eyes.
"What the hell" he breathed, and realized he'd made it. Somehow, he was back on solid ground - and alive. "What just happened? Please tell me nobody kissed me."
"Hey." Steve smiled back, probably looking dopey and fucked-out.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Uh...okay. Tomorrow. After the game. Not the rooftop place." Steve lost his nerve, unsure of how to explain that he wanted a date. But he'd at least get to spend some alone time with Tony, so maybe he could work up the courage to say something tomorrow night. He turned his attention back to the game. The Mets hit a home run just then, and Steve felt as crummy as the Dodgers did right at that moment.
Steve walked inside and closed the door behind him, hearing Tony slip out. He got into his own soft, comfortable bed, and fell asleep in a heartbeat.
"I understand, sir."
you have to say, alright?" He poked Tony's arm, which made the smaller man chuckle. "No holding back."
"Like battle. Have to sense what's coming." Steve mumbled to himself. Tony leaned in.
Steve laughed and ducked, hiding his face in Tony's hair. He kissed Tony's head again, like he'd done last night.
“I want you too. I've wanted you longer than I can remember. But...I’m not like him, Steve. I don’t know what Other-Tony said when he was here to make you suddenly like me in that way, but-”
“Ew, no.” Tony scrunched up his face. “I thought I said dark golds and blues only. Lets go talk to her. Who even uses wallpaper anymore?”
"Calm down, Tones. It's not the end of the world."
“Are you just going to sit there and watch me?” He asked, irritated. It was uncomfortable having all of Steve’s undivided attention like this, especially when he couldn't do anything about it.
"All the dances you want." Steve answered. Tony swelled up at that, a radiant smile gracing his beautiful face, and he craned his neck up to give Steve a soft, tender kiss, before putting his hands back into position, letting Steve lead them into the next song.
"Yeah. I was gonna see if the subway team needed any help, but I ran into Miss Potts on the way over." Tony's senses honed in on that. "She's a real nice lady. We met and she told me about some of the stuff SI does, and before I knew it I was back inside the tower. Guess she likes to walk and talk, I didn't even notice." He laughed at himself. "Anyways, she ordered me to take the rest of the afternoon off, and...I don't know her very well but my survival instincts told me it would be dangerous to say no."
Which is why Tony was currently giving Steve the grand tour, finishing it off in the bedroom of his new apartment, just one floor under Tony's own penthouse that was currently getting a new set of windows installed. Seeing how Tony was being so generous and obviously didn't want to talk about their fight, he decided to let it go for now.
Steve blinked.
“But you need to get cleaned up too!” Tony insisted. “Let’s just take a shower. The tub isn’t big enough for the two of us.” Steve blushed at how easily Tony accepted their new routine.
"Oh, um, well we first met in 2012. An alien sorcerer was trying to take over the world."
Steve threw his visor back, zipped open his bag and pulled out his phone just in time to see a message pop up. Tony had sent a selfie of himself sitting across from Pepper in a plane cabin, some bubbly champagne glasses with orange juice sitting between them.
“Hey, J.” Tony started to unzip one of his bags, taking out a few rudimentary objects to use in his observations. “You do have access to the whole tower, right?”
"Oh!" Steve looked at his watch, 11:55am. Shit, he never slept in that long. "I'm so sorry, I'll get out of your hair right now! Let me just change and pack my things-"
"So what am I supposed to do?"
“...Jarvis?” Tony’s eyes widened. So this...was
He was considering where to begin - they had to talk about this, after all. It came out of nowhere. How long, exactly, had Tony felt this way? Why now? Why him? But before he could ask a single question, Tony flopped down and made himself comfortable in the sheets, pulling one of Steve's pillows under his tired head.
"No sweat, Cap." Tony handed Steve his phone back. "I probably fried your brain with all this techno-talk. You should go get some shut-eye."
With a defeated sigh, Steve made his way back to his apartment.
We all hide ourselves Tony, so yes. We’re nothing like you - because you wear your flaws on your sleeve and let the whole world see exactly who you are, exactly what you stand for. Even if you mess up, you take responsibility and then some. You make the world a better place, and no amount of obstacles can stand in your way.”
"Tell me about it."
"Goodnight, Tony."
“Tony!” Steve yelled over the sound of the jet engines and the cheers outside. “Wait! What happened to being in this together?”
“What is it Tony? What do you need?”
"You know, Stark says we should put you in more blues." Natasha said, without looking up from her phone.
“Really?” Tony looked up in surprise. “Well...they’re your best friends. They
“He’s not going anywhere.” Pepper assured him. “And he's so
Tony's blank face stared at the racks. "You...want to go to Venice Beach today?"
“Your boyfriend doesn’t watch you work?” Steve raised an eyebrow.
"Great. So you guys are dating now. Why couldn't this have just been a quick call, again? And where exactly is your boy toy, anyways? He better not walk out of that bedroom naked."
"No! I mean, of course it would be
"Yeah, yeah. Mazel Tov and all that. Does this mean you guys will finally move in together so I can take Steve's floor? Or better yet, you guys should move into Steve's apartment so I can have the penthouse. Hawks need the highest vantage point you know!-OW!" Clint rubbed his arm where Natasha pinched him.
The most unfortunate part was that everyone in the world expected Tony and Steve to be the leaders of this band of superheroes. Skeptical eyes would scrutinize their every move - look for any reason to call the New Hero Deal into doubt. They all had plenty of enemies, and it was crucial that they show a united front. It was hard enough to pretend to be friends, or hell - even amicable co-workers
“Whatcha’ working on, handsome?” He asked, giving his boyfriend a kiss before handing him his mug.
Steve nodded. Made sense so far.
“What are you-” Steve started to ask, but was cut off.
“Great. I’ll be right here to greet him.” Steve smiled as he fixed his hair and sat up just a little straighter. It was disgustingly sweet how excited he was to see the Other-Tony come home.
"We were
the same guy who had a stick up his butt when we first met."
with someone he thought was you!”
have a nice ass, doesn't he?"
"Uh...I actually don't know. He broke my medical scale and my industrial scale. Soo...we know he's at least 5,000 lbs." Bruce scratched his head.
him. In a way they
"Of course Tony." Steve reassured him, but Tony must've still been on edge, because he froze up again at the contact, not taking his eyes off their hands. "I know you're only lookin' out for me."
“Uh...yeah, I guess.” Steve wondered how he knew where to find the spare toothbrushes he kept.
"So why can't you just use my private jets? I've got them in all the major cities you know."
Then, he was fully awake. And realized what just happened.
"Yes. Correct. I mean, you can bulldoze the old containment fences, I guess. We won't need them. But anyways, I wanted to, um...well." Steve wanted to reach over and hold his hand, to give him some much needed moral support. That might freak him out though, especially in front of everyone, so instead he nudged Tony's foot and gave him a big smile and thumbs up when he looked over at him. Tony took a deep breath and continued. "Right. I wanted to thank you guys. For agreeing to help. It's, uh...it's going to be a lot of work though...so you know, just a heads up. I mean if you guys have other commitments I wouldn't mind-"
That's when he heard glass shatter all around him, and felt himself being yanked up. Below him, he saw a dozen of Fury's special ops soldiers barge in through the side windows, and saw Steve jump to the side, on top of the mob boss, pinning him down. When he was finally let go on the roof, he looked over to see Natasha had been the one to pull him up.
"Sir?"
don’t have faith in me, but if you’d trust me for one fucking second, maybe everything wouldn't be so fucked up right now!” Tony shouted.
"Think he'll call that therapist, J?" Tony yawned and pulled the covers up.
"Yeah. Because I'm
“No. He was mad because I..I...may have yelled at him for going to another dimension without telling anyone. I guess I could’ve...asked him to keep me informed in a more civil manner.”
“No! I mean it. I was asleep when he came into my room. He really
Well,
"Why can't you be more sympathetic, Platypus? I'm having an existential crisis over here. Plus you were already nearby."
“Then wake up. You need to finish your research so my Tony can come home already.” Steve finally let go of him and stood up, extending an open hand to him.
Tony thought back to all the times he’d put the lab on lockdown in the last few weeks, probably shunning any opportunity for anyone to come see him, talk to him, show him that they were his friends.
Natasha was currently torturing Tony as he sat in a meeting room. She wouldn't stop sending delicious photos of Steve in clothes that looked like they were painted on his skin. Since this whole 'get Steve's wardrobe updated' operation had been his idea, Tony sent a over few suggestions.
“Is that your portal there?” Steve asked when the air next to Tony started buzzing with energy. A small hole in the fabric of space and time started to give off heat, and expand.
Fuck, he wished he knew what Other-Tony had said to make Steve let his guard down.
"Oh yeah? How long exactly?" Tony wiggled his eyebrows. Steve thought back.
"I'm just saying. If you're gonna do this whole 'exposure therapy' thing - just don't be surprised if the feelings don't go away. And don't be mad at me when I come back to say 'I told you so' when he finally makes a move on you."
"Oh! Sorry Steve. I guess you haven't learned about texting yet. It's like calling, but you only send words or pictures. Take a look." Natasha offered him her phone. Steve saw a string of messages between herself and 'Tony Stark' labeled clearly at the top. He moved the screen down and saw pictures of himself between messages that included written text and little cartoon illustrations. It seemed straightforward enough, so he made a mental note to ask Jarvis to teach him about texting once they got back home.
"That's only for board members and shareholders."
"Uh, yeah." Steve wanted, more than anything, to stay with Tony, to joke around and have a good time. But he didn't trust himself not to do something stupid right now. He needed some time to clear his head, and more importantly, shake off all this built up lust. "I was going to, but I just remembered, Fury wanted to talk about bringing me back into the office, so I thought I'd go see him today."  It was only a half-lie. He really did mean to meet with Fury soon. Might as well do that today.
“That.” Steve pointed, and quickly put his hand back up when Tony shook his repulsor at him in response. “Tony, he...he always raises his other eyebrow at me. And his lips, they...they lean a little to the right, not the left like yours do. FRIDAY, what’s going on? Who is this?” Steve shakily asked.
"Oh they'll be fine with it." Tony smiled, "Now go get changed, I'll order a bunch of pizza for everyone, we can make popcorn, put on your comfiest PJ's - oh!" He stepped out of Steve's slippers, handing them over. "Sorry. Sort of commandeered these today. Here ya go. See you back here later?"
"So." Steve didn't know what to say, now that it was just the two of them. Things didn't seem so complicated before. Now, he was struggling to find the words. He didn't want to burden Tony with another problem, but he knew he should tell Tony about the...incident. Otherwise, it would be weird, right? He was sure it wasn't exactly normal for friends to sleep cuddled up like that. It might upset Tony, but he knew that keeping it a secret would be worse.
"You know..." He grinned smugly. "I happen to have access to the main stage. Security will let us through, we could go take a look if you want."
Steve gasped a long breath. A voice. This one he could understand. His vision, which was blurry and dark a second ago, began to focus on a light nearby.
Just a little something I whipped up last night instead of sleeping, at the end there, to kind of show how I envisioned them at the restaurant in their tiny little booth :)
It was so confusing. Sometimes, it seemed that Steve would relax into, even enjoy physical contact. Other times, it seemed to spook him.
"Okay.." Steve crossed his arms and leaned on a work bench. "Explain it to me now, then."
"Well, I'm sure you'll have a good time anyways. It's a beautiful place to be." Tony replied.
“We could always just...go back to that.” Tony casually suggested, like the solution could be as simple as that.
Tony momentarily forgot - he forgot why he was mad, forgot that he wasn’t good enough, forgot that he must’ve looked like hell right now. All he knew was Steve’s worried eyes looking right through him. He found himself inching closer. It looked like - maybe - Steve was leaning in too. Even through his tears, he could see those ocean blue orbs moving towards him, could feel the strong, sturdy arms engulfing him, could hear the increasingly annoying alarms overhead.
They took turns bashing Tony Stark, calling him every name in the book. Accusing him of treason. Saying he was gullible, arrogant, had grandiose delusions. It felt like an eternity of torture passed before Steve finally had the floor. He was fuming. He stood up, knowing it would catch everyone's attention, crossing his arms and eyeing the suddenly alert group. He heard a quiet
“Uh...I didn’t really have much.” Steve looked over Tony’s shoulder to see what he was searching for. It’s not like he brought more than a couple duffel bags back from Wakanda last week. The movers had arranged his things from the compound before he’d even arrived, and everything else had been here exactly as he’d left it all those years ago.
“Really?” Tony asked through doe eyes as he gave Steve another good, long stroke. “No other versions of me?”
“Good. Because we’ve been wanting to watch this new show called Westworld, but Romanoff won’t let us until
"But... Thor's going back to Asgard soon. And Bruce, he has work going on here and it's such a long flight."

to stay put whether it wants to or not."
"Well, just a couple," Steve realized that maybe it could have been an invasion of privacy to look through private messages between people. "All I saw were a couple pictures of myself and you said you didn't like my pants. I didn't see anything...er..... incriminating...or embarrassing if that's what you're worried about."
“Called it.” Unaffected, Bucky went back to his food. Sam rolled his eyes and turned his concern back toward Steve.
"I yield."
"I'll bet it can be. You should ask him. I'm sure he'd tell you just how hard it was for him." Pepper said wisely. Tony thought about it. It struck him, just then, that he hadn't told Steve about Other-Steve kissing him. Not that it compared to what Steve had done anyways. It was completely disproportionate. He hadn't even had the time to say anything, really. I mean, it's not even relevant at this point...
"Welcome to Dodger Stadium!" Tony announced, grabbing Steve's hand and pulling him out of the car. "Home of the Dodgers since 1962. But I'm sure you knew that."
“Alright, alright.” Tony gave in. “Let’s go see this doctor. He better not be an M.D. I’m too sleepy to defend myself from needles right now.”
"Ah, hah. Yeah." Steve let out a hollow laugh, picking up the utensil and composing himself. A man-date? That was probably just another way of saying two pals hanging out. Yesterday hadn't been a real date, of course. But wow did that get his heart pumping. They had a nice breakfast, chatting about the others back in New York, Tony catching Steve up on how everyone was doing. When they were done eating, Steve looked at his watch and sighed, not even 9 AM yet. He looked out towards the living room, considering his options, and then got to work. He was the man with a plan, after all.
“And I’m learning about this just now...why?” Tony seemed to relax a bit.
"Sir?"
With Steve, he wouldn’t have to choose. He would never need to put Steve over himself, because choosing Steve
“M..More.” He demanded, and Steve pushed in deeper. “More!” He whined, so Steve slowly sheathed himself further to his pleas, until he was all the way in. Tony panted heavily next to his ear, arms fully encasing his neck now, hanging onto him for dear life. Tony's cock, trapped between them, was fully leaking now, drops of pre-cum rolling down his stomach, tickling his skin, dripping onto the sheets. Tony’s gaze was unfocused, all he knew right now was the feeling of Steve’s fat cock inside him.
Steve sat back down. Pepper, ever so politely, flipped to the next page of her packet.
want to dance?" He asked, eyes flicking back and forward from Steve's face to his outstretched hand.
“Oh- good.” Tony changed course, relieved to hear the news. He didn’t think he could do this at the office anyways. He knew he looked like a wreck right now - and he didn’t want anyone else to see that.
"Moving on then. Mr. John Donne-"
"Yes."
"Well, it's not actually a date-" Steve tried to explain but was interrupted by a suddenly very alert Clint.
It was a really nice laundry room. Well, it helped that it was built by a genius billionaire who employed the best interior designers in New York, and was overlooking half the city from 90 floors up. But Steve was just happy that the washing machine worked great, and that he had a big sectional to lay on while he waited. Sure, he could go watch some TV or try to go back to sleep, but he had so many thoughts running through his mind, and he couldn't keep trying to outrun them.
Bruce was generous enough to let Steve help make dinner, even if it
He was about to start packing everything back up, when the hologram display caught his eye. It was a long note. Longer than it should be considering it wasn't that many items in the package. He started to read through it.
for advice about it.” She ruffled his hair. “Would you stop sulking for one minute and realize that he’s trying for you? He doesn’t want to start another fight. He wants to be your friend again.”
"Giant dwarfs?" Clint scoffed. "Ooookay. I want to be the first one there, though. You gotta send me first. I've always wanted to use a bulldozer! Please tell me there's something to wreck!"
“I wonder what Happy’s up to. He might like some company.” Tony pondered out loud.
“So, in this universe, the photons from the sun that day hit your eye in a bad way. The ones in my universe hit your eyes in a good way.” He paused. “Well, um, good for me, anyways. And that changed the course of our histories.”
"That's not what aunt Pegs said..." Tony mumbled angrily under his breath, but Steve heard it loud and clear, and that really set him off.
you are, Sunshine.” Tony grinned, spreading his legs open for him. “You finally woke up.”
“No, no. You’re right.” Tony crossed his arms. “That’s on me. I shouldn’t have butted in. Cap’s a grown man. He can fuck whoever he wants. It’s not like it would be the first time he falls for a complete stranger.”
Steve woke with a startled snort at a dip on the other side of his bed. He flailed his arms, throwing off his blanket, and shifted to push himself up - raising his hands in the defensive position.
"Hey Steve! Need any help?" Bruce cheerfully walked into the kitchen.
“Hey, man.” Sam started, but Clint continued.
“Then….why?” Tony questioned, still in disbelief. “Why would you...with
"Read this." Tony threw a hologram at Steve and failed to stifle a big yawn. "Explains corporate charitable contributions...itemizing deductions...wake me up when you're done." Tony shuffled down, turning away and was snoring a second later. Steve smiled to himself and tried to read the article. God, it was so boring. Something about percentage limits on foreign charity...publication #529...click on the link labeled I.R.S 23-678...Steve had done so well keeping up with everything until now, but this legal stuff was incredibly mundane. He closed his eyes. Maybe if he rested for just a minute, he could keep going.
“Too much?” He asked, pulling back slightly.
"You wanna check on me?" It seemed almost too good to be true. Steve was planning on going to Los Angeles anyways. Seeing someone who cared enough to check in on him would definitely be a huge bonus, with the way he'd been feeling lately.
In the end, he just gave up. His internal battle had made Tony anxious, and he didn't want to worry the man. When he placed his head on Steve's shoulder, he simply gave in, just melting into the comfort. All his problems seemed so far away suddenly, it was easy to forget everything else when he was right next to Tony. Maybe someday, when Steve was brave enough, these touches would really mean something. But today, Steve was just content to be right here, with the man he admired so much, that made him so happy.
pants more often.
"Not the money-maker!" Tony shielded Steve's backside from an imaginary foe, making them both laugh. "I'll just make sure you can't watch next season's Iron Chef."
Clint thought it would be hilarious to give Tony and Steve the smallest bed in the house to share. They would've protested - but shut right up when Nat gave them a death glare.
"Huh?" Steve looked around. He didn't
"That's quite an assumption to make." Pepper pursed her lips.
me. I'm
a little odd. Stark has been avoiding you since you moved in, and you didn’t find it weird that he was suddenly being so nice to you?”
"I've never done anything like this before, I don't know."
"Uh, yes? I mean, there was a weird period at first where it was a little awkward, we all had to learn to live together, but we became pretty good friends for a while, there."
“Go back?”
"Oh...should we...should we go?" Tony must have seen it too.
"Huh?" Steve's heart skipped a beat, making him lose focus, and his character on the screen was knocked out a second later by Tony.
“Looking back, I would have done it all differently. I’d have told you everything sooner.” Steve said.
Steve looked up at the Liberty Bell in front of him and snapped a picture. After a minute, he figured out how to send it to Tony.
Now, in the harsh daylight, Steve loaded up his bike, yearning for the day he could go back to the tower and be there for the other man. It seemed like Tony was having a hard time with work lately, and Steve hated being so far away, not able to do much of anything. Speeding onto the road, he considered what he could get for Tony in the next town to cheer him up. Maybe a postcard? Apparently, anything could be sent through mail very quickly nowadays. He'd have to think of the perfect gift. He pondered it while listening to the music Tony loaded up for him, humming along to the catchy rock tunes that the man seemed to prefer. A couple hours later, as he was coming up on the Golden Gate Bridge, he realized - why was he even still here?
"It's the least I could do, seeing how you finally got yourself some new clothes." Tony said, and Steve outright laughed at that. As if
The whole 'didn't realize the other was leaning in for a kiss' trope is totally real. I should know: it happened to me and my husband right before we started dating 🤣🤣 that night ended so weird and I didn't know why until weeks later when he finally told me he'd gone in for a kiss and I misread that. (He thought that night was a date, I thought it was just two good buddies hanging out. Yes-I'm dense.)
“You’re….still here.” Tony flatly observed. Steve felt that burn again. The burn he tended to feel when Tony opened his mouth around him lately. It hurt - it was a wish that things could be better again, but knowing they were only going to get worse every time he allowed Tony to get to him. And Tony
“Mmmph!” He could hear Tony’s muffled protest into a pillow. “No! Harder! You know I can take it!” Steve wasn’t sure he’d ever….spanked Tony before. Well - there was that one time - the first time they trained in combat together at the SHIELD gym - before Steve had even moved into the Tower. It was the day Tony had come to ask him to move in, actually. It had been a good workout, much to Steve’s surprise. He didn’t know back then that Tony could move so...gracefully outside the suit. He’d smacked Tony on the bottom goodnaturedly afterwards with a “good job, Tones.” Tony had stiffened up, muttering a thanks and quickly changing the subject back to his moving arrangement, so Steve thought he’d been uncomfortable with it and never did it again. Apparently though, Tony still remembered that day, and wanted some more.
Tony felt himself flush, and turned back to the TV, trying to keep cool. "Gladly."
"It's quite a lot for just a couple nights, isn't it?" Steve felt a little guilty at all the extravagance.
“Oh, really?” Tony bit out, “It sure didn’t seem that way when you found out Bucky was alive. You hid things from me, left me out, when I would
“Heh, you’re so cute when you’re out of it.” Tony smiled up at him. A sympathetic smile. Something Steve rarely ever saw on Tony anymore. Not for him, at least.
“I just showered you stupid piece of junk!” Tony pouted from the floor, throwing a fit.
“No.” Pepper answered flatly.
"Wash my hair?" Tony asked sweetly as they stepped into the hot spray, and Steve obliged right away. Tony knew that Steve liked to touch, couldn't stay away, really. So he would offer up any opportunity for his boyfriend to get his hands on him. Steve happily lathered up Tony's scalp, then soaped up his hands, working down the other man's body, scrubbing every muscle, and Tony did the same for him. When they were finally clean, Tony pushed up against Steve's chest, pulling him down for a kiss, moaning into his mouth, their wet hard dicks sliding against each other. Tony pulled back and was about to get on his knees when Steve held him up by the arms.

my Sunshine. My muse, my reason for still living in this century. You make me so happy, happier than I ever knew I could be, and I want that for
“You didn’t do anything, idiot.” Natasha pulled him off by the ear.
Tony was transfixed, it was like an out of body experience, seeing this in full HD, but not remembering a moment of it. He could almost imagine what it would feel like, to be held like that by Steve, but by some sick, twisted turn of fate, he would never really know. The footage sped through about an hour, then slowed when Steve was roused again. This time, the soldier seemed to pull Tony closer.
"Idiots." Tony smiled at Steve, who was looking much better now. They sat in silence, Steve calming down little by little. He felt so safe with Tony. Wished he could somehow pay everything back. He didn't have a whole lot of money, or much of anything really. But he wanted to thank Tony somehow for being here, for being an anchor for him in this new and scary world.
“Infinity Stones, huh?” Tony wearily took a sip of his cocoa. “Sounds like some comic book stuff to me.”
“It’s no wonder I was so disoriented last night when I woke up here. Everything's different.” Tony said as he guided Steve into the lab. "Do you know where he set up the interdimensional portal?"
“Jarvis - please let your Tony know that he needs to depolarize the lab and the observatory. Thanks for all your help, old pal.” Tony spoke, trying not to croak.
"You don't have to compromise. You could do both, be a parent and a superhero. I know personally, I'll spend the next few years working on a way to defend Earth - especially after seeing what's out there. It will definitely take up a lot of my time and energy once I get started. But...I think if I had a kid, I could make it happen. I'd do anything to protect them, and they would only motivate me to work harder. You'd probably be the same way. Plus, you told me the other day that I should trust you when it comes to these guys." Tony pointed at the rest of the team, who were currently seeing how many chicken nuggets they could fit in Thor's mouth at once. "Which is...hard to say the least. But I do. I trust you guys completely. If I can do that, even with my...past, so can you. Plus, you're so smart, more than you give yourself credit for. You've already learned so much, more than most people have bothered to learn in this day and age, anyways. And even though you had no reason to believe me on the helicarrier, when I said something was up with SHIELD, you took the initiative to find out the facts for yourself. Things might change, but morals don't. I think you'll do fine, as a parent, and a partner, and a superhero, and you'll be able to find someone that you can trust in too."
Steve thought as he made him come apart under him. And Tony - God he was so pliant, letting Steve touch him anywhere he wanted, letting himself be groped like this, and clearly enjoying every second of it. Steve’s hands roamed, stroking his perfect ass, gripping his gorgeous hips. The more he pounded into him, the more incoherent Tony became, clutching the sheets, muttering to himself. Soon, Tony was saying something to him that he could barely make out.
"Pepper is CEO, and she's on my side. But we can't do it without majority vote from the board." Tony frowned as he stuck a fork into his strawberry shortcake. No one should be this upset while eating cake, Steve thought, and vowed to himself that he would help Tony in any way possible.
“I expect you to woo me tomorrow.” He teased as he stood up.
Tony was light-headed, the feeling of Steve’s cock filling him up, his tongue fucking into his mouth, his own cock squeezed between them, leaking cum making it wet and slippery. He’d never felt so wanted, so full of love and so full of Steve.
"Couldn't hurt." She sat across from him in her recliner. "So you're going to have to tell him,
"Mister Rogers, we had no idea-" Fucking Williams again. Steve saw a flash of red before sucking in a sharp breath and interrupting.
"I...suppose that would make sense." Tony rubbed his beard, thinking it over. "I thought he might've had a thing for you."
said it was okay to do so. Only because
“You are NOT Steve!” Tony shouted at him. “You think I don’t know my own husband!?” Steve gawked, speechless, when he heard a female voice from the speakers above him.
? We don't
"So what brings you down here?" Tony asked, still typing, not looking away from his screen. "Sorry, didn't mean to monopolize your afternoon."
(See the end of the chapter for
The same spot where - a lifetime ago - they used to meet. It was a perfect afternoon - the sky was clear, the buildings under them just barely turning their lights on as the sun edged closer to the horizon.
“You know. Awkward. Weird. Sexual tension?” Steve just stared right back at him. “You...you haven’t told him what happened?”
"FRI?" He questioned. FRIDAY never let anyone get all the way to the door without announcing their arrival.
." A hand shot up to Steve's hair, pulling back so he could see his face. "Fuck me. Bedroom. Now." Tony groaned, voice low and gravely with desire, before attacking Steve’s neck, leaving a trail of hickeys in his wake. Steve looked around at their surroundings - he'd been in here before, but he didn't know where Tony's bedroom was. Tony got impatient and pulled on his hair again.
“You put yourself down.” Steve sighed. “And you make me out to be this perfect being. I’m not, Tony. I’m far from perfect.”
“You horndog.” Steve chuckled and pulled his face up, giving him a long, forgiving kiss. “It’s okay baby, I accidentally kissed the other-you here. Probably would’ve done the same thing if he hadn’t stopped me, you know I can’t go a whole day without you.” He squeezed Tony’s ass, making the smaller man giggle. “Good to know I like you in that universe too. Other-you sure likes Steve.”
Steve watched as three little dots kept appearing and disappearing at the bottom of his screen. Tony was obviously having a hard time typing out whatever he wanted to say. Steve was about to tell him to just ask tomorrow, when he finally got a new message.
"Goodnight, Tony." Steve watched as the elevator doors closed and listened to the hum of the machinery as it was pulled away. He went to bed, wondering if he should have been more direct with Tony earlier, when he asked him to dinner. Maybe he just didn't see him like that? Steve was pretty sure that Tony was interested in men. True, maybe the papers nowadays exaggerated their headlines, but he was under the impression that Tony's bisexuality was public knowledge.
The thought of being Tony’s hit him like a punch in the gut, and he came, hard. He pumped up into Tony’s mouth, his hips seizing up uncontrollably. Tony's eyes rolled up, watching as Steve came undone. He forced Steve’s cock deeper still, his nose buried into the short patch of hair he kept trimmed, tickling him a bit. When Steve’s cock stopped throbbing in his mouth, Tony finally pulled back, coughed up a bit of spunk, and wiped his mouth through a satisfied grin. Steve was laying on his back, a faraway look on his face, his mind blank for once as he came down from his high. He felt Tony tenderly run his hands up and down his thighs.
"A favor to Tony?"
in charge. Maybe we can discuss it over dinner sometime?”
"That's a rude question, who else would it be?" Tony wrapped his arms and legs around Steve like an octopus, laughing at Clint's gagging noises.
"It's for you!" Tony held up the glove for Steve to see. "I was going to spend the rest of the week fighting the board's vote, but since I don't have to anymore, I have a lot of free time to finally upgrade everyone's gear, starting with you. These gloves will work like your bike's bag; magnetic strips and clamps to make it easier to recall the shield during battle. You're right on time, actually. Go stand over there on that pad."
"It certainly is." Steve knocked his shoulder. "You don't need to be modest on my account. You really have been nothing if not an amazing friend to me, you know."
Steve grinned in his helmet, the AI clearly had his back. He followed the instructions Jarvis gave him, shooting down the freeway between cars, hoping his supersoldier reflexes were still top notch. Finally, he made it to the address. It was...an interesting location. He parked in front of the restaurant, small and colorful. It was packed with people, and no one was speaking English. It kind of reminded him of the tiny trattorias in Italy, where no one had a sense of personal space, but it was charming.
Steve was NOT ready to face the 21st century.
"Who's that?"
Tony's plane was waiting, so Steve parked right under the entrance ramp. They both got off the bike, and the air was thick and hard to breathe in. Steve tried not to look completely distraught when he turned Tony around to unclip the helmet, pulling it up and off. Before he knew what he was doing, his hand was in Tony's hair, his fingers running through the soft, fluffy mane, smoothing out the helmet hair. Steve knew he should pull away, but he let himself feel close to the scientist just one more time.
"Oh she's just about the only good soul in there." Tony flashed a grin, "I'm surprised she let you get away though. I'm sure she would've loved to see you outside that suit."
"Sorry, we probably should have talked about it first." He zipped himself up and stood, slapping away Tony's hand when he reached for help getting up, opting to pick up the man instead, bridal style. Tony squealed in delight, throwing his hands around Steve's neck.
“You were only gone a few hours.” Steve laughed. “But I missed you too. Did you have fun over there?”
"Oh." Steve blushed.
"Ha!" Tony was game. "Then you'll have to do better than that, because I already have a pair of those at home!" Steve blushed, but was happy that Tony seemed to get into the spirit of things. They both looked for the most ridiculous outfit they could find, giggling like little kids as they ran through the aisles.
"Great." Tony deadpanned. He wondered if he could go back down to the bar and ask the rattled bartender for a stiff drink.
"Hey." Tony looked up at him, smiling.
"There you go. Good job, Stevie. Just keep breathing for a bit. Just focus on me, okay?"
“I just missed you, is all.” Tony purred, as he boldly climbed on Steve’s lap, wrapping his arms around his neck. Steve leaned against the headboard, his cock quickly woke up too, taking great interest in the direction of this conversation.
like you’re up.” Tony chuckled, squeezing his arm playfully.
busy with work and just didn't have time to talk. But whatever the case, at least he knew that Tony really did care. Steve went into his room and finished all his packing that night, before falling into a dreamless sleep.
"Oh! I've never seen a mojito like this! Look, rose petals!" Tony held up his glass, delighted at the pretty pink drink. He was right, Steve looked down as his glass, green mint and limes floating next to bright red petals, which gave the liquid a light pink hue. Steve had to admit, it was tasty, if not completely, obviously sensual. They weren't offered menus. Instead, like silent ninjas, the waiters consistently brought out their food and drinks - apparently Natasha had planned their whole meal for them. All the other patrons were taking their time eating and drinking, it seemed like no one had left the establishment since they walked in. Actually, the whole restaurant seemed to be moving in slow motion, even the waiters weren't in any rush, giving the impression that they could take all the time they wanted in here tonight.
“Take off your suit.” He demanded as he pulled Steve’s shoes off. Steve had barely finished unbuttoning his shirt when he saw Tony pull the rest of his clothes off without haste. God, he was gorgeous. And all his.
"FUCK." Tony buried his face in his hands, letting out an angry groan, "NO! Everything before THIS elemental version of the reactor is obsolete. We have to try something else." Tony rubbed his fists into his eyes, frustrated. Steve couldn't help it, he reached out and put a comforting hand on his shoulder. Tony jerked his head back up at the touch, seemingly having forgotten already that Steve was there. He looked over, lost and confused.
"Pineapple lime margaritas!" Tony proudly declared as he carefully set both ginormous drinks down. "I know the serum means you can't get drunk, but that doesn't mean your taste buds don't work, right?"
"You don't have to worry." She said as she sat in the loveseat on the other side of the table. "No one's gonna take your boyfriend's spot."
Steve was so elated. Quickly, he texted back.
“Well, that’s good isn’t it? I know you two haven’t been on the best of terms since you got back, but you’ve liked him since forever. This should be great news. So why are you so bummed, and what do you mean ‘kind of’?” Sam asked.
“You’re
He pulled his legs up and buried his face in his knees, now sobbing uncontrollably. Tony just held him. What could he say? They sat there, Tony rubbing Steve's back as he cried, and eventually the soldier was tired out and pulled his face back up. Tony stood up with a quiet 'be right back' and walked to his bedroom. He returned with a box of tissues and a big blanket, offering the box to Steve as he wrapped them both up. He pulled Steve back into his arms and Steve went willingly, resting his head on Tony again. Steve's shivers stopped, and his breath hitched just a few more times before he broke the silence.
"I'm so sorry Tony." Steve pleaded.
Steve nodded, catching his breath as if he'd just run a marathon for fun in the time they were apart. He pulled himself together and stood up straight, his hands forming fists at his side, knuckles white with tension.
been a little hard on him.” Tony thought back to all the times he hid from Steve around the tower the last few weeks. Had he overreacted? Maybe if he'd given Steve a chance to talk, he'd have found out that he wasn't picking a fight after all. “I was just afraid that if we talked again, he’d remember why we stopped being friends in the first place, and change his mind. Leave again.”
to a man before. He’d never done much with men, or women, or anyone in general to be honest. But it couldn't be much different from doing it to himself, right? Plus, he didn't want to look like he didn't know what he was doing, not in front of Tony. So he took the bottle and wrapped his arms around Tony, squirting some lube onto his fingers, and gripped Tony closer with his other hand. He reached down, slowly, and let his wet fingers rest on Tony’s hole for a moment. When Tony squirmed back, pleading for more, he found the courage to push through the tight ring, and he couldn’t believe how easily his finger slipped in.
“Fine.” Tony yawned as he took the hand, and let Steve pull him up. “Help me calibrate the electron beam, then.”
Steve didn't really want to. But Tony was making him feel better, so he did it anyways. He took a little sip from the bottle, coughing when it hit his dry throat, then another little sip. It helped his head hurt less, when did his head start hurting? He finished the bottle and looked at the phone again.
"It's okay." Tony said in an uncharacteristically soothing tone. "Let's get you upstairs." They silently made their way inside and into the elevator. Steve guessed someone would bring his bags up and put away his bike. Tony held on to Steve's arm the entire way up, likely making sure he wouldn't nod off again and fall over. Steve could've gotten up on his own, but didn't want Tony to pull away, so instead he closed his eyes and leaned against the wall, letting the other man dote on him. All too soon, they were in front of his bedroom door.
"I...I realized that I didn't…I didn't give you a goodnight kiss." He fumbled out, hanging his head in shame, like it was the most unforgivable sin on earth. "And that's not a very nice thing for a boyfriend to do so…" He peeked up through his lashes at Tony, giving him a questioning look through his raised brow, asking for permission.
He could. He got comfortable on his side, he could only see Tony's face on the screen, Jarvis probably just had a screen in front of Tony while he worked. But it was exactly what he needed.
that they got to see a genuine Nat smile.
"No." He deflated, suddenly ashamed of his outburst. "You're right. He just...gets to me sometimes."
“Uh, hey how about you guys talk about this later-” Sam tried to intervene, but Steve wanted an answer right now. He held up a hand to Sam and asked again.
"He is not my soldier." Steve cut him off again. "He is a colleague, a teammate and a friend. But he is not a soldier. And although every person in this room who lives in Manhattan owes their lives to the man, this is not about Mr. Stark. I am here to defend the reactor plant project, not him."
So he spent the next day taking in the sights and looking for the perfect gift for everybody. It was easy to get the rest of the Avengers done - he got Nat a bracelet he knew she'd been eyeing when she took him shopping. Clint got a complete LEGO set of himself that had just been released. He didn't know when Thor or Bruce's birthdays were, but didn't want them to feel left out, so he got Bruce a nice and intricate tea collection he found, and figured Thor would be happy with a little replica of his hammer that served as a bottle opener.
" Tony was pacing at this point, looking a little manic.
"Nope. No way. Not happening." Steve waved the orange trunks with 'CALTECH BEAVERS' printed on the side.
Don't think too hard about the physics of it and you'll be fine :)
, Stevie. Don’t tease me, honey.”
"Is that what you want?" Tony playfully slid his legs over to Steve's and rubbed his shin with his shoe under the table.
Tony jumped up, scrambling halfway to the elevator when he remembered Rhodey was sitting right there. He timidly turned around and gave Rhodey a crooked smile.
"T....T'ny?" Steve was hoarse for some reason. His throat was as dry as a desert, but focusing on that sensation helped, somehow, even if it hurt a little.
Tony POV
"Of course." Steve knew the detrimental effects of war all too well. He'd met plenty of Italians and Germans alike who were good people during the war, trying to save as many people as possible. That didn't stop a lot of Americans from treating some Europeans and most Asian people as enemies, even those who weren't even Japanese, or even Japanese people who were clearly American citizens and had nothing to do with the war. "But don't you have SI buildings over there that aren't a security issue?"
“I...I love you too.” He whispered. Tony smiled sadly at him before walking up to the machine panels. He quickly checked the screens again, scribbling something in one of the notebooks before giving Steve a thumbs up, and stepping up to the frame. In the empty cavity, a dark opening appeared.
He’ll know I want him...like that.” Steve groaned.
When they got back to the tower, Steve thanked them again, then made a bee-line straight for his room. He wanted to relax after spending all day in the hustle and bustle of crowds. When he got to his apartment, he found all his new clothes already hung up for him. Disappointed that he wouldn't have the mindless task of arranging his closet to preoccupy himself with, he walked back to his bed and laid back. It wasn't late enough for bed, but he didn't really have anything else to do that day. He asked Jarvis to let him know when Tony was back from work, so he could thank him for the clothes. Minutes passed. Sighing, Steve looked around the still unfamiliar room for something to do.
“No.” Steve stopped him. He tried to ignore the overwhelming sensation of Tony's hand in his. “I’ve wanted you since way before that.” He felt Tony's shoulders tense up against him. “I liked you long before this whole mess. I only have eyes for you, Tony.” Steve could hear the fabric of his sweater shuffle as Tony turned his face into his neck, and felt a puff of uneven breath on his skin. A hot teardrop ran down his collarbone. He rubbed Tony’s arm gently, soothing him. “But you're right. I haven't been good at showing you that. But that will all change from now on, okay? I'll show you, every day, how much I want you. How much I need you." Tony swallowed hard against his chest. "You wanna know what Other-Tony said to me when he got here?”
He tried to reason with himself. Tony is just that kind of person, and likely brings it out in those around him. He likes to hug and pull you by the hand and poke you. He doesn't mean anything by it, that's just how he is. So he resolved to try to just enjoy his time with his friend and shove down these weird clingy feelings that were creeping up.
I don’t want to miss out on that. I know why Other-Tony called Steve his Sunshine now. Because that’s what you are to me.
“The way he talked about Other-me...it was unreal. He went on and on about how kind Tony was, and thoughtful and loving and I thought...I thought it really sounded like the universe screwed up. Like that Other Tony belonged here, with the rest of you, not me. I’m none of those things, Steve. You probably couldn't tell me about Bucky because I wasn't transparent with you either, why would you trust me with that? I
To his surprise, everyone agreed. Even Thor was excited to have a place to stay when he came back to visit his 'Midgardian companions.'
"...A-arrow? Does someone need Hawkeye?"
“Woe is you.” Bucky pushed Steve’s legs off the sofa and sat next to him. “You guys made up. He wouldn’t be putting in all this effort to fix the team by your side if he didn’t care at least a little. Just be nice to him for a change.”
person.
"I'll need to print some paperwork before we head out. Let's meet at the SI entrance in 30 minutes, Steve? We can head over together."
“Guys, stop it!” Steve warned, but Tony cut him off.
"You caught me." Steve smiled back, today wasn't a total wash after all. Tony really knew how to make him let go.
“Is that what Steve told you?”
dance!" Tony laughed. "You said you weren't good at dancing! I
"Yeah. I'm just working on some SI stuff right now. I'll talk while I work, so you know I'm here. You know I do that all the time anyways." He winked at Steve. Steve tried to smile back, but ended up just grimacing and shivering a little.
The correct Tony is back
It was Natasha. Tony shifted a little so Steve wouldn't see the conversation, and texted back.
“You’re wrong. They love
Steve." Tony chanted as he drove his cock in and out, barely pulling back a few inches before slamming in again. Steve loved being completely filled, felt shots of pleasure every time Tony pounded all the way in. It was like he was being split in half, in the best way possible. He loved being Tony's.
"Thanks?" Tony didn't know what to say to that. Now Steve was reaching at straws to compliment him for some reason? Did Steve like him? No, of course not. The most likely explanation was that Steve somehow found out about Tony's feelings, and was trying to find a way of letting him down gently. Shit, how could he have known? Well, it was obvious. Tony practically threw himself at Steve every chance he got. Hell, he burrowed himself into the man's broad, chiseled chest even in his sleep. How could Steve
"Yeah."
In the coming days and weeks, Steve saw Tony open up more and more. He was so unbelievably proud, it felt like his heart was going to explode at seeing Tony so happy, with his friends, with him, with life in general. It’s what he’d always wanted. When he met Tony that first day on the helicarrier, all he’d seen then was a lonely man, overcompensating, quick to analyze everything and everyone, his defenses always up. Even then, being his friend was never enough. Steve wanted to get through to him. But he made so many mistakes along the way, thinking he could outsmart Tony, or trick him, or change their circumstances in his favor, when all that planning and lying was never even necessary. All he needed after all, was to be honest with Tony, and the rest fell into place, like it was meant to be.
He hadn’t realized that he was hugging Tony so close until he felt soft pecks on his moist temples. Tony, the sweetheart, was giving him little kisses to bring him back down.
“Hey, chill man. Just slow down and speak up. You said something about another universe? What are you talking about?” Sam asked.
"Nah." Steve sighed. "Think I'll stay the night, I want to see Hoover Dam tomorrow."
There were glimmering lights strung up everywhere, the tree was magnificent, its soft endearing glow washing over the small group in Tony's penthouse.
"Well, technically in some hotel rooms for a couple days." He corrected, looking around at the destruction that was once his penthouse. "Just while I tidy up. I figure we might be needed around here, and it would good to be all in one place, don't you think?"
They did not greet him with open arms when they returned. He hadn’t expected it. Not really. But it would’ve been nice to talk about it, at least.  After all, he
"Sure, if everyone doesn't mind."
“Y’re not goin'?” Tony’s big, sleepy doe eyes looked up at him.

he thought to himself. "The project stands on its own merits, and should be carried out regardless of who proposed it."
"Of course, Steve. Grab some more of those blankets and lay down, will ya? You can still see me right?"
"I can't believe he has to work with those people." Steve frowned. "They were saying such horrible things about him. It was very hard to sit through."
"Yeah...." Tony breathed.
“Are you seriously trying to go back there without telling us again?” Steve got that little crease over his eye, the one that formed on his stupid, perfect brow every time he got upset. Shit, Tony had fucked up again.
"Huh?" Steve snorted and blinked his eyes open, they were already outside the tower. He'd fallen over onto Tony's shoulder at some point, snoring on the poor guy. "Shit, sorry about that. Guess I'm more tired than I thought."
"Deal."
“No - it’s fucking
"You'll stay on the phone?" He whispered.

"No! I need to pee!" Tony giggled, trying to push himself away. After another second of forced snuggling, Steve mercifully let go, and Tony wiggled out of his embrace. It felt so right, so domestic. Steve almost fell back asleep to this thought when he heard a thump and a pained "Ow!"
At first, he didn't even recognize it was him. There were a few tourists around, so he thought it might be one of them. But after a few seconds, he realized that he hadn't heard his own ringtone in over a month! Not even glancing at who was calling, he quickly picked up.
It felt as natural as breathing, and he knew he never wanted to go without it again, never wanted to belong to anyone else.
“Oh, right. Good luck. He looked relaxed out there. I’m sure he’d be open to talking to you. Just keep it civil, man.” Sam gave him a pat and they went their separate ways. Steve knew better, though. Tony was anything but relaxed. Those who knew him well would see it right away - Steve could see if even from here. He was letting some politician talk his ear off. He wasn’t as touchy-feely as usual, keeping his hands in his pockets instead. He still hadn't taken off his sunglasses, and Tony only did that when he wanted to hide something.
“I see, Sir.” Jarvis answered. “I had assumed that my surveillance malfunctioned when you seemed to be asleep at your workbench one moment, then awake and suited up in the next moment.”
"Uh...okay? Guess J's sleepy too. Night, Winghead."
, Cap. About half a dozen times today.  Let bygones be bygones and move on. In fact, here's the deal. You'll stay here as long as you want - BUT you can't bring up our little spat ever again under this roof. My roof, my rules and all that. Are we good?"
." Natasha held up a hand to herself, and duh. Of course Nat would figure it out right away, she's a spy, and a great one at that, and could probably read a closed book from a mile away. "Tony isn't going to assume anything like that. You do realize he thinks you're straight as an arrow, right?"
“...and I don’t even use that stupid lounge anymore anyways. We have the one downstairs! We could just covert that into a gym for you so you don’t have to go all the way to the second floor.” Tony blabbered on excitedly.
"I don't know. I mean, I was his prized experiment, maybe that's why?"
Good thing this hotel had self service laundry.
"Oh, hey Steve! Do you like men? I'm sure
"Really?" Steve got up after him, chasing him to the elevators. "We haven't even had cake yet."
a kind, thoughtful, loving person. I’ve
"Really?" Steve brightened up.
"I'll just hide the coffee machine for a week." Tony pouted, and Steve held out a hand. "So, we'll watch out for each other?"
"Sir?" Jarvis prompted.
"I wouldn't be so tired if your guys had let me rest on the plane, Shellhead." Steve liked their banter, wished it was a more regular occurrence in his life.
"That's right, Steve. It's me. Tony. Take your time, hun. There's no rush."
to say was that this is a marvel of structural ingenuity." He spread his arms out.
" Pepper smiled. "Why don't you tell him something actually useful, like how to catch a ride around town?"
"Ugh. Who can eat this early." Tony set down his mug and slipped on Steve's fluffy slippers by the door. "Don't feel like going up to get mine." He explained.
"M'Kay, remember to see me next week about that phone!" Just like that, he was gone. Steve couldn't help but picture Tony as a little tornado, always on the move.
And please don't worry! Things will start to turn around next chapter!
"Aaaahhmm!" Tony moaned when he stuffed a couple of small cubes in his mouth. "Try this. It's little Cubanos. I'm coming back here for these alone." Tony held up the tiny sandwich in front of Steve's face, and instinctively, Steve opened his mouth. He was pleasantly surprised when Tony leaned in close, gently setting it on his tongue before pulling back. It was literally just a ham and cheese sandwich in cube form, honestly a little pretentious, and altogether good, but not showstopping. But wow, when he looked at Tony, smiling up at him with excited anticipation, it tasted like heaven on earth. He'd probably eat anything out of Tony's hands.
“M’not gonna…l-last-” Tony tried to articulate, but Steve could tell his brain was fuzzy and clouded.
"Has Tony, you know.." he wasn't sure how to ask, "is...has he had a chance to maybe see me yet?"
TW: Steve has an anxiety attack.
to hang out with you. And I want to see you off. It has nothing to do with feeling bad. What happened to being pals?"
“Everything’s going up to the penthouse.” Tony said as if it was no big deal.
man, looking so peaceful, so content.
“It’s not a big deal Ton-” Steve turned back, and they both saw each other, covered in white, sticky powder.
“Please, Steve! S-stop! I’m gonna….” Tony choked out, squeezing the base of his cock, face twisted and straining. Steve finally stopped, and looked up from between his legs, innocently tilting his head to the side with a dopey smile, proud of himself for making Tony go wild with pleasure. Tony grumbled at him. “Menace. You’re a fucking menace.” He stuck out his other hand, offering the small bottle, and Steve took the lube. “If you don’t get inside me before I pop, I’ll be very upset with you.” Tony warned.
His mind swirled with ideas, and he couldn’t contain himself any longer. He decided to call it a night - he’d go get cleaned up and probably stay up late overthinking every angle of this date - but it would all be worth it if he could get another kiss tomorrow night.
to him?” Bucky snickered.
"And the security protocols? We changed them last night you know, after we introduced the idea of the Avengers and SHIELD-"
"Think I feel better now."
He opened his eyes and stretched, better wake up soon. He'd probably have a long morning of talking to do with Tony, though it didn't seem dreadful at all after last night. Actually, he was really looking forward to it. Tony was like a whole new person right now. So different from the cold acquaintance he'd been around the last few weeks. He thought he’d have to get used to how distant Tony had become. Then again, they hadn’t spent any time alone in so long. Maybe this was how Tony could really be around him. He hoped they would talk things out peacefully for once, and maybe this sweet new Tony would be here to stay.
When he got to the lab's entrance though, he found that he couldn't see through the glass panes like last time. He tried to go up to the door to open it, but the light on the panel remained red.
“What the hell is an Ultron? No, I don’t know any Ultron. You’re gonna need to start making a whole lot more sense real quick, bud. Where is my Steve?” Tony pushed Steve back.
"Right. Pepper. I called
"That's enough!" Steve boomed, loud enough to make everyone, even Bruce, look up in surprise. "I'm a grown man and I've been in this century long enough to know how to take care of myself. I'm not an idiot. You can't stop me from going." He stomped over, right in Tony's face, challenging him to say otherwise.
“You’re not unloveable, Tony.” Pepper put her ice cream down too. “You just...you give and receive love in your own special way.”
Steve didn’t even have a second to process his grief when he heard Tony’s voice again.
"Sure, you could say that. Pretend you're fighting these guys." Steve was then covered in a red light, glowing all around him. He figured that was the scanner, and told himself he'd better focus on sparring these aliens and
"Hey Rhodes? Can I borrow you a minute?" Pepper smiled at the Colonel, raising her eyebrows towards the pair currently giggling to themselves about the shocked looks Steve got at the meeting.
"Ah.." he tried to keep quiet, a leftover habit from being in the Army. Sometimes though, when he was really worked up, he couldn't help but let a moan slip by. After squirting some lotion on, he wrapped his fingers around the base and gave himself a few slow pulls.
Steve didn’t make a move to stop him.
Giddy with anticipation, Tony cleaned up and took a seat at his bar (hot chocolate in hand, no liquor tonight; he needed all his wits if he was going to come up with the best first date ever) when he heard a knock at the door.
"Well have a good night!" Steve settled back and put his arms on either side of him, behind the couch. Tony could practically feel the heat radiating next to him, it seemed closer than usual. He wished one of those strong arms would slide up and over him. Wondered how good all that muscle would feel around his shoulders. He could smell Steve's body wash, it was warm and inviting. He must have zoned out, because next thing he knew, Natasha's face was right in front of his.
And since when did Tony Fucking Stark want to talk about things, anyways? It was easier for them to settle in, and pretend nothing happened. It was easier to keep to themselves, to give him a nod or a friendly greeting in passing. It was easier for Tony too. And soon enough, it was easier to just avoid them altogether.
“Good, and everyone in the tower is asleep right now?” He wouldn’t want to run into anyone else, especially when he didn’t know how they might react to seeing a Tony from another dimension.
how much of a dick he is! You
“Yeah. To how things used to be. You know, start over.” Tony got that gleam in his eye, the one that appeared whenever he found a new, world-changing project to work on. “We could do a complete overhaul, rewrite the system, wipe the RAM. Burn it all to the ground and rebuild it from scratch! Brand new coding, brand new software.” Steve didn’t exactly know what he was talking about, but as Tony waved his hands above his head, Steve imagined that the genius could see everything, every aspect of their relationship, in front of him, as if his eyes were the holograms in his lab, as if he could see the future as clearly as he could see the sunset across the bay.
Steve laughed, and hopped on his bike, strapping on his helmet as he kicked his bike to life. "See you soon, Stark."
“Nope. You’re just predictable.” Pepper smirked. “He said I should tell you to go home.”
belts) then they were finally free to go. They dropped off all of Steve's bags with the driver from SI, who let them know he would have it all taken to the tower and would be back before they finished their early dinner. While they ate, Natasha and Clint explained how to match his clothes, accessorize and layer. Steve thanked them for spending the day with him. As annoying as the whole ordeal had seemed at the time, he really did appreciate that they took the time to help him with all this. Now he wouldn't need to worry about whether he was sticking out like a sore thumb next time he went out. (But really, who was he kidding? When did he ever go out?)
"Oops! Sorry." Tony picked up Steve's things and placed them on the kitchen island. "Come on! Sit! I just got back, I've decided we need to celebrate so I'm making you breakfast. Though it's a little late, were you finally able to sleep in for once?"
be wrong. This is not a mirror universe at all. I must’ve ended up in some kind of backwards parallel universe or something. None of this makes sense.” Tony staggered into a chair and pulled out a stack of papers, flipping back through his notes. Steve sat in the chair next to him and stared. “Um...can I help you?”
“Maybe.” Steve said. “But we would’ve worked it out, eventually, right?” He gave Tony a small smile. “We always do.”
"And when I'm gross and sick?" Tony quizzed him.
"Now give me a real kiss too." Tony laughed along with him, and they lazily made out for a bit. Soon, though, Steve was starting to feel the cold, hard floor under them, and it couldn't be comfortable for Tony either.
right now, not tearing the leaders apart over something so
“Why? What’s happening next week?” Steve was getting a little anxious now, following close behind.
"Mhm. Wow." He responded on auto-pilot, having lost track of the conversation again, when suddenly he noticed a handsome super-solider walk in. He looked lost, taking in his strange surroundings. "Oh, I'm sorry. My friend just arrived, I'll talk to you later?" Tony excused himself and quickly made his way to Steve.
"Tony..." Steve was on edge again. "Have you been drinking?"
“Sorry…” He lamely apologized, wondering if he was already supposed to know this, somehow. Tony seemed to forgive him immediately though, which was a surprising change of pace.
Steve did that. It helped. It was easier to move his legs, and soon he found his way to the bed. The covers were strewn all over, he grabbed the closest one and draped it on his shoulders, sitting, facing the phone. He opened his eyes again (when did he keep closing them?) and saw a worried looking Tony on his screen.
Or maybe Tony didn't want something serious with a man? He did say he wanted kids, after all. Though, Steve figured that Tony would agree that adoption was a wonderful way to become a parent too. Maybe he just didn't want to date a teammate? Great, I should've thought of that before just putting myself out there. He didn't even seem to notice though. What if he's just not interested in
"Just like you said. To go to Tajikistan with us. You know - to help with construction and setting up security and stuff." Steve was confused. Isn't this what they had been planning for the last couple of days?
"Yep. Jarvis, free up my afternoon tomorrow, would ya?"
"Not much. I remember SHIELD was taking forever to release my things, so I had to borrow some blankets and pillows from Tony that first night. But it was no big deal, they shipped everything over the next day."
As soon as they stepped into the quinjet though, he was bombarded by Clint.
They were sitting only inches from each other, but to Steve, the gap felt a mile wide. He looked down to the city streets, the countless cars driving by in the distance - everyone heading home, to be with their families. And here he was, with Tony, with
"Goodnight, Sunshine." Steve murmured, clearly already drowsy. Tony snuggled into him.
"Did...did you mean that?" He quietly asked. Steve wondered what he could be talking about when he suddenly realized that he might have .. no, DEFINITELY had said what he was thinking out loud at the end there in the heat of it all. He was mortified, but he
Tony told him once, a long time ago, before their first big press conference, that they were in this together. They were still just getting to know each other, but Steve trusted him completely. Tony would love to grab Steve by the arm and drag him around an event like this one - making silly inside jokes in front of the press just to get Steve to laugh. Whispering juicy gossip about the celebrities in attendance into Steve's ear if he was ever nervous about meeting them. Drowning his drink in a second and asking Steve to go get him another when he could tell Steve was getting uncomfortable in a situation - just to give him an out. Little things like that would put Steve at ease.
He sped up the footage, the screen showing that they slept on separate sides of the bed most of the night. In the early hours of the morning, Tony must have gotten cold, because he turned over, probably looking for a blanket, and found Steve's warm body instead. He watched himself scoot closer to Steve, and saw the other man stir in his sleep, turn towards Tony, and reach out, grabbing the smaller man and pulling him into his chest, wrapping him up in a bear hug.
Sending love <3
"Tony-" No. Be direct! Like Nat said. "
Steve chuckled. He turned the helmet over in his hands. Had Tony stayed up all night making this for him? He tried it on, and it was a perfect fit. Comfortable and lightweight, but it felt durable. He pulled it off and looked at Tony, who was staring up at him in wonder...or maybe exhaustion.
It was mid afternoon, while he was sketching the buildings in the French Quarter, that he finally heard back from Tony.
"Boyfriends?" Tony bluntly asked.
“It’s all there. Math is good. This is a mirror universe. The
“Is that what Steve said?”
"Tony..."
“Good. You don’t sleep enough.” Steve started working out a knot on his shoulder. It felt
"Eh. You sure?" Tony looked up, "Usually people can't wait to get rid of me. I've been talking your ear off for the last two hours."
Just then, Jarvis interrupted.
"Shit - Oh,
“You know, when we were in Wakanda, Natasha and Clint were the only ones who would come back to the US regularly.” Tony gave him a curious look. “Spies. They go in and out as they please. Anyways, they would check up on you all the time, and you never even noticed. Not because I asked them to, just because they wanted to make sure you were doing alright without us. Clint had to stop Natasha from reaching out to you a couple times, even. She really hated having to leave you behind.”
woke up 70 years from now and didn't have anyone to help you, Pep? I've gotta at least give him some guidance."
“Guess I changed the locks, huh?” Tony chuckled. Of course his Jarvis would make a Star Wars reference at him. “What date is it?”
"Then he said he would miss me, I said I'd miss him too. His hand was still in my hair. He was like, holding the back of my neck..." Tony reached back and touched the same spot with one hand, remembering the sensation. "And it just felt right, so I closed my eyes and leaned in, but next thing I know we're hugging and then, that's that. He pulled away and then I just left."
"Our snacks are ready! Race you!" Tony immediately regretted saying that when Steve flew past him, and by the time he made it to the dugout lounge, Steve already had half a hot dog stuffed in his face, laughing at Tony who wheezed his way over.
When they got home, it was well past midnight, they were all tired and decided to head straight away to bed. They piled up into the cramped elevator, Clint was still a little drunk, laughing as he pressed all the buttons on the wall panel, earning him a knock on the back of the head from Natasha. Thankfully, Jarvis knew not to make a stop at every floor in the building on the way up. They said their goodnights, leaving the elevator one by one, until finally it was just Tony and Steve left.
"That's not it at all." Steve reached out and placed his hand on Tony's knee, "You're my friend. I
“I can go back-to-back.” Steve gasped out, needing release soon. Thoughts of Tony so willing and eager for him were overwhelming. “Please.” He begged.
, in case these scanners could pick up his...excitement around Tony.
"You didn't see him before the whole Accords thing." Sam interjected. "He used to look at Steve like he hung the moon and the stars himself. Steve refused to notice."
"Sure, go ahead and give him access to the lab too, I'm pulling up his biometrics now. Don't forget to tell him that he should absolutely avoid taco Tuesdays downstairs, no matter what birdbrain says." Tony was telling Jarvis as he opened the door to his car, Pepper waiting in the backseat for him.
"Hey. Stop that." Steve firmly cut him off. "You are not going to apologise for
With great effort, Steve forced his eyes open, pulling his head back. A sleeping Tony snorted and huddled closer, back into his neck. Steve blinked. His arms were wrapped around the smaller man, one hand in his hair, the other around his waist, gripping his side softly.
"Captain? Sir would like to inform you that he's getting ready and will meet you for an early lunch in Chinatown in about an hour. Shall I reroute you?"
Steve was trying to process everything. Tony thought they were married for some reason. He didn’t remember Ultron, he thought Jarvis was still in charge of the Tower. He looked at Tony very carefully, and started to notice some oddities of his own.
"It's my...." Tony was about to wave him off when his eyes made it over to Steve, then went blank. "...pleasure." He coughed a bit before straightening up and looking away. "Em. You know. I might've been mistaken. About those pants."
Steve shot him a smirk. “You could just ask
first.”
So yeah. Like he said, confusing. He really didn't know what could be going on.
"Steve! Wait up!"
“Nah, I’ll wait for him.”
After their morning soak, they were famished. Thanks to Steve's careful planning this morning though, the hotel had a car ready and waiting for them downstairs, and they quickly got to their first destination. When Tony saw where the car stopped, he was excited.
"Thank you."
Okay, now that you've read this chapter - is it weird that I keep changing character perspectives halfway through my chapters? I feel like I want to shove all their wonderful happy thoughts onto the page lol! Next chapter might be full of changing POV's so I'm just checking that it's not too confusing 😅
"Yeah. I see you."
When he threw himself back onto his bed, he grabbed a pillow and held it close. The bed was big and empty tonight.
normal in a relationship too?
Tony took his hand and they started to weave through the masses, when a song Tony recognized came on.
was doing
trying. But Steve was going non-stop. Pretty much all his free time was spent working with the construction crews to get Manhattan back in order. He'd stop here and there to chat with the team on his way out, but Tony wondered if he'd taken any time since Loki's encounter to just relax.
